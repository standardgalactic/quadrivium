Getting Around Quickly 
This Quick Start Guide is meant to be just that‚Äîa tool that can help you jump right in 
and find information in this book, as well as learn the basics of how to get around and 
enjoy your iPod touch right away. 
We‚Äôll start with the nuts and bolts in our ‚ÄúLearning Your Way Around‚Äù section, which 
covers what all the keys, buttons, switches, and symbols mean and do on your iPod 
touch. In this section, you‚Äôll see some handy features such as multitasking by double-
clicking the Home button. You‚Äôll also learn how to interact with the menus, submenus, 
and set switches‚Äîtasks that are required in almost every application on your iPod 
touch. You‚Äôll also find out how to read your connectivity status and what to do when you 
travel on an airplane. 
TIP: Check out Chapter 2: ‚ÄúTyping, Copy, and Search‚Äù for great typing tips and more. 
In the ‚ÄúTouch Screen Basics‚Äù section, we will help you learn how to touch, swipe, flick, 
zoom, and more. 
Later, in the ‚ÄúApp Reference Tables,‚Äù section, we‚Äôve organized the app icons into 
general categories, so you can quickly browse through the icons and jump to a section 
in the book to learn more about the app a particular icon represents. This guide also 
includes several handy tables designed to help you get up and running with your iPod 
touch quickly: 
 Get Started (Table 2) 
 Stay Organized (Table 3) 
 Be Entertained (Table 4) 
 Stay Informed (Table 5) 
 Network Socially (Table 6) 
 Be Productive (Table 7) 
Let‚Äôs get started!

Learning Your Way Around 
To help you get comfortable with your iPod touch, we will start with the basics‚Äîwhat 
the buttons, keys, and switches do‚Äîand then move onto how you start apps and 
navigate the menus. Probably the most important status indicator on your iPod touch, 
besides the battery, is the one that shows network status in the upper-left corner. 
Understanding what these status icons do is crucial to getting the most out of your iPod 
touch. 
Keys, Buttons, and Switches 
Figure 1 shows all the things you can do with the buttons, keys, switches, and ports on 
your iPod touch. Go ahead and try out a few things to see what happens. Swipe left to 
search, swipe right to see more icons, try double-clicking the Home button to bring up 
the multitasking Fast App Switcher bar, and then press and hold the Power/Sleep key 
to power your device on or off. Have some fun getting acquainted with your device.

Switching Apps (AKA Multitasking) 
One of the nice features on your iPod touch is the ability to multitask or jump between 
applications (see Figure 2). 
Double-click the Home button to bring up the Fast App Switcher bar in the bottom of 
the screen. Next, swipe right to see more icons and tap any icon of any app you want to 
start. If you don‚Äôt see the icon you want, then single-click the Home button to see the 
entire Home screen. Repeat these steps to jump back to the app you just left. The nice 
thing is that the app you just jumped from is always shown as the first app on the Fast 
App Switcher bar.

Music Controls and Portrait Screen Rotation Lock 
You will see a few more icons if you swipe from left to right in the Fast App Switcher 
bar. You can lock the screen rotation by tapping the leftmost icon, and the middle 
buttons control the currently playing music or video. The last icon on the right will start 
your Music app (see Figure 3). 
 
Figure 3. The Screen Rotation Lock button, Music app controls, and Music icon in the Fast App Switcher bar 
Starting Apps and Using Soft Keys 
Some apps have soft keys at the bottom of the screen, such as the Music app shown in 
Figure 4. 
To see and use the soft keys in the Music app, you must have some content (e.g., 
music, videos, and podcasts) on your iPod touch. See Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync  with iCloud. 
iTunes and More‚Äù for help with syncing your music, videos, and more to your iPod 
touch. Follow these steps to launch the Music app and become familiar with using the 
soft keys to get around: 
1. Tap the Music icon to start the Music app. 
2. Touch the Songs soft key at the bottom to view your albums. 
3. Touch the Playlists soft key to view a list of your artists. 
4. Try all the soft keys in Music. 
5. In some apps, such as the Music app, you will see the More soft key in 
the lower-right corner. Tap this key to see additional soft keys or even 
rearrange your soft keys.

TIP: You know which soft key is selected because it is highlighted‚Äîusually with a color. The 
other soft keys are gray, but can still be touched. 
  
Figure 4. Working with soft keys in apps
Menus, Submenus, and Switches 
Once you are in an app, you can select any menu item by simply touching it. Using the 
Settings app as an example, tap Sounds, and then tap Ringtone, as shown in Figure 5. 
Submenus are any menus below the main menu. 
TIP: You know there is a submenu or another screen if you see the Greater Than symbol next to 
the menu item (>). 
How do you get back to the previous screen or menu? Tap the button in the top of the 
menu. If you‚Äôre in the Ringtone screen, for example, you simply touch the Sounds 
button. 
You‚Äôll see a number of switches on the iPod touch, such as the one next to Airplane 
Mode shown in Figure 5. To set a switch (e.g., change the switch from OFF to ON), just 
touch it or slide it.

Reading the Connectivity Status Icons 
Most of the functions on your iPod touch work only when you are connected to the 
Internet (e.g., Mail, your Safari browser, the App Store, and the iTunes app), so you 
need to know when you‚Äôre connected. Understanding how to read the status bar can 
save you time and frustration: 
Wi-Fi Network Signal Strength (1-3 symbols):  
 Strong 
   Weak 
   Off 
 Radio Off ‚Äì Airplane Mode 
 
You can tell whether you are connected to a network, as well as the general speed of 
the connection, by looking at the left end of your iPod touch‚Äôs Top status bar. Table 1 
shows typical examples of what you might see on this status bar.

Flying on an Airplane‚ÄîAirplane Mode 
Often when you are flying on an airplane, the flight crew will ask you to turn off all 
portable electronic devices for takeoff and landing. Then, when you get to altitude, they 
will say ‚Äúall approved electronic devices‚Äù can be turned back on. 
TIP: Check out the ‚ÄúInternational Travel‚Äù section of Chapter 4: ‚ÄúConnect to the Network‚Äù for 
many money saving tips you can take advantage of when you travel overseas with your iPod 
touch.

Touch Screen Basics 
In this section, we will describe how to interact with the iPod touch‚Äôs touch screen. 
Touch Screen Gestures 
The iPod touch has an amazingly sensitive and intuitive touch screen. Apple‚Äîrenowned 
for making its iPad, iPhone, and iPod devices easy-to-use‚Äîhas come up with an 
excellent, even higher resolution, highly responsive touch screen. 
If you are used to a physical keyboard and a trackball or trackpad, or even an iPod‚Äôs 
intuitive scroll wheel, then this touch screen will take a little effort to master. With a little 
practice, though, you‚Äôll soon become comfortable interacting with your iPod touch. 

QUICK START GUIDE 
11 
You can do almost anything on your iPod touch by using a combination of the following: 
 Touch screen ‚Äúgestures‚Äù 
 Touching icons or soft keys on the screen 
 Clicking the Home button at the bottom 
The following sections describe the various gestures you can use on your iPod touch. 
Tapping and Flicking 
To start an app, confirm a selection, select a menu item, or select an answer, 
simply tap the screen. To move quickly through contacts, lists, and the music 
library in List mode, flick from side to side or up and down to scroll through 
items. Figure 6 shows both of these gestures.

You can have lots of fun with your iPod touch; Table 4 shows you how. For example, 
you can use your iPod touch to buy or rent movies, check out free Internet radio with 
Pandora, or buy a book and enjoy it in a whole new way using iBooks. If you already 
use a Kindle, you can sync all your Kindle books to your iPod touch and enjoy them right 
away. You can also choose from hundreds of thousands of apps from the App Store to 
make your iPod touch even more amazing, fun, and useful. You can also rent a movie 
from Netflix or iTunes, downloading it immediately for later viewing (say on an airplane or 
train).

FaceTime video chat app on your iPod touch!  
With your iPod touch, you can view your photos and interact with them using intuitive 
touch-screen gestures. You can pinch, zoom, rotate, and email your photos‚Äîall by 
using simple gestures. 
Interact with your content like never before. Use Newsstand to organize and view your 
newspapers and magazines.  News web sites and web sites look and read like never 
before due to the incredibly clear and crisp retina display. Flip through stories, videos, 
and pictures, and interact with your news. 
For the first time, really feel as though you are reading a book when you read on an 
electronic device. Pages turn slowly or quickly (you can even see the words on the back 
of the pages when you turn them). 
Manage your media library like never before. The iTunes app features a beautiful 
interface, letting you choose music, watch videos, organize playlists, and more‚Äîall in an 
effortless and fun way on the iPod touch‚Äôs high definition display.

quality movies and TV shows right on your iPod touch. 
Update your Facebook status and receive push alerts‚Äîall on your iPod touch. 
 

INTRODUCTION 
26 
Stay connected to the web and your email with the built-in Wi-Fi connection. All the 
latest high-speed protocols are supported, so you can always be in touch and get the 
latest content. The iPod touch also includes a larger keyboard to type out emails and 
notes when you use the device in Landscape mode. 
Getting the Most out of iPod touch Made Simple, 
iOS 5 Edition 
Read this book cover-to-cover if you choose, but you can also peruse it in a modular 
fashion, by chapter or topic. Maybe you just want to check out the App Store app, try 
iBooks, set up with your email or contacts, or just load up your device with music. You 
can do all this and much more with our book. 
You will soon realize that your iPod touch is a very powerful device. There are, however, 
many secrets ‚Äúlocked‚Äù inside, which we help you ‚Äúunlock‚Äù throughout this book. 
Take your time‚Äîthis book can help you understand how to best use, work, and have 
fun with your new device. Think back to when you tried to use your first Windows or 
Mac computer. It took a little while to get familiar with how to do things. It‚Äôs the same 
with the iPod touch. Use this book to help you get up to speed and learn all the best tips 
and tricks more quickly. 
Also remember that devices this powerful are not always easy to grasp‚Äîat first. 
You will get the most out of your device if you can read a section and then try out what 
you read. We all know that reading and then doing an activity gives us a much higher 
retention rate than simply reading alone. 
So, in order to learn and remember what you learn, we recommend the following: 
Read a little, try a little on your iPod touch, and repeat! 
How This Book Is Organized 
Knowing how this book is organized will help you quickly locate things that are 
important to you. Here we show you the main organization of this book. Remember to 
take advantage of our abridged table of contents, detailed table of contents, and our 
comprehensive index. All of these elements can help you quickly pinpoint items of 
interest to you.

Chapter 
Getting Started 
In this chapter, we will take you on a step-by-step tour of your new iPod touch and 
everything you get in the box. We will also look at the ins and outs of charging it and 
how to make your battery last longer. In order to get started with your iPod touch, you 
need to connect it to iTunes to get it activated and registered. In our ‚ÄúiPod touch 
Basics‚Äùsection at the end of this chapter, we will show you the basics of how to 
maneuver on your iPod touch, so you can get up and running quickly. 
Getting to Know Your iPod touch 
In this section, we will show you how to use everything you get in the box with your iPod 
touch. We also give you some iPod touch battery and charging tips, talk about how to 
determine if your iPod touch is already activated, and discuss the Slide to Unlock 
feature. 
What Is Included in the Box 
The box your iPod touch comes in may seem skimpy if you‚Äôre new to iPod touchs. 
However, it does contain everything you need to get started and enjoy your iPod 
touch‚Äîexcept for a good manual, which is why we wrote this book! Here is what your 
box contains: 
 iPod touch: On the very top, as soon as you open it, you will see your 
new iPod touch. 
 Paper folder: Under the plastic holder for the iPod touch, you will find 
a paper folder that contains the following: 
 Finger Tips: A 4.5‚Äù x 2.5‚Äù small fold-out booklet with 19 panels 
of basic information about your iPod touch. 
 iPod touch Product Information Guide: A 4.5‚Äù x 2.5‚Äù booklet 
with font that is way too small to read. This book contains all the 
legal terms, conditions, warnings, and disclaimers related to your 
iPod touch.

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
32 
 Apple Logo Stickers: Two of those nice white Apple logos that 
you sometimes see on car windows. Enjoy! 
In the bottom of the box, you will find the items shown in Figure 1‚Äì1: a headset, and a 
USB cable. 
Figure 1‚Äì1. The headset and USB to Dock cable in the bottom of your iPod touch‚Äôs box 
iPod touch Headset 
The headset consists of two white 
earphones for listening to music, 
videos, or FaceTime calls, as well as a 
small controller attached to the wire of 
the right earphone. Plug this into the 
hole on the top-left edge of your iPod 
touch. Make sure you insert it all the 
way‚Äîit can be a little tough to press 
in. 
As the image here shows, the controller 
has Plus (+) and Minus (-) keys, as well 
as a Center button. You can increase 
or decrease volume with the (+) and (-) 
keys and use the Center button to 
answer or hang up FaceTime calls. 
NOTE: You can move between songs with two or three clicks of the Center button. Double-click 
to go to the next track. Triple-click to go to the previous track. 
The included headset also contains a small microphone for FaceTime calls.

USB to Dock Cable 
The USB to dock cable connects your iPod touch to your computer; it also doubles as 
your power cable. 
Wall Plug Adapter 
The wall plug adapter has a USB socket on one end and a plug on the other end that 
you insert into an electrical socket. Just connect the USB cable to your iPod touch and 
the other end to a wall plug to charge your iPod touch from the wall. 
Charging Your iPod touch and Battery Life Tips 
Your iPod touch may already have some battery life, but you might want to charge it 
completely, so you can enjoy uninterrupted hours of use after you get it set up. This 
charging time will give you a chance to check out the rest of this chapter, install or 
update the iTunes app, or check out all the cool iPod touch apps available (see 
Chapter 22: ‚ÄúThe Amazing App Store‚Äù). 
Charging from a Power Outlet  
The fastest way to charge your 
iPod touch is to plug it directly into 
a wall outlet. You use the same 
USB connection cable you use to 
connect your iPod touch to your 
computer. Plug the wide end of the 
cable into the port at the bottom of 
your iPod touch (next to the Home 
button) and the end of the USB 
cable into the wall plug adapter. 
You can purchase these plug 
adapters for about US $10.   
 
 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
34 
You can tell your iPod touch is charging by looking 
at the screen. You will see a lightning bolt or plug 
icon inside the battery indicator in the upper-right 
corner. 
The Main Battery icon will show your charge level. 
The image to the right shows a charging iPod touch 
with an almost full battery. 
TIP: Some newer cars have built-in power outlets 
(just like in your home) that you can use to plug in 
your iPod touch power cord. Some also have a dock 
option that allows you to control the iPod app from 
your car radio headset. These outlets are sometimes 
buried in the middle console behind the front seat. 
 
Charging from Your Computer 
You can also charge your iPod touch when you plug it into your computer, albeit a little 
more slowly than when you connect it directly to a wall charger. 
TIP: Try using different USB ports on your computer. Some USB ports share a bus and draw less 
power, while others have their own bus and draw more power. 
For optimal charging, you should have your computer plugged into the wall outlet. If 
your computer is not connected to the wall outlet, your iPod touch will charge, but at a 
slower rate. Keep in mind that, if your laptop computer goes to sleep or you close the 
screen, your iPod touch will stop charging. 
Charging from Other Accessories 
Some accessories designed to work with your iPod touch will also charge it. The most 
common of these are iPod touch/iPod music docks. These are speaker systems that 
you plug into your iPod touch to listen to music. The only time your iPod touch will not 
charge is when you see the following warning message on your screen: ‚ÄúCharging is not 
supported with this accessory.‚Äù This occurs on older accessories or those not designed 
specifically for your iPod touch.

TIP: A Case and External Battery Combined 
Some cases actually have external batteries built into the case. There are several manufacturers 
available. One provider, mophie (www.mophie.com), has such cases for the iPod touch. 
Expected Battery Life 
Apple says the iPod touch with its bigger battery and advanced technology should last 
longer than previous models of the iPod touch (see Table 1‚Äì1). 
Table 1‚Äì1. Battery Life Specifications from Apple 
Video Playback 
7 hours of video playback 
Audio Playback 
40 hours of audio playback 
These battery life durations are in ideal conditions with a new, fully charged battery. You 
will notice that, over time, your actual battery life will diminish.

Battery and Charging Tips 
The key question is this: how do you get the most out of your battery life and make sure 
your iPod touch is charged and ready for you when you need it? In this section, we will 
cover a few tips to help you accomplish this. 
Getting More Out of Each Charge 
To extend your battery life, try some of the following tips: 
 Lower your screen brightness: Tap Settings > Brightness, and then use the 
slider bar to lower your brightness to a level less than halfway across that still 
works for you. 
 Turn off Location Services: If you don‚Äôt need your actual location to be 
transmitted to your apps, you can turn this off. Tap Settings > Location 
Services, and then set Location Services to OFF. If you go into an app that 
wants your location, you will be reminded to turn it back on. 
 Set a Shorter Auto-Lock: This feature shortens the time your iPod touch takes 
to enter Sleep mode (i.e., turn off the screen) when it‚Äôs not being used. 
Shortening this time can help save your battery life. To do this, tap Settings > 
General > Auto-Lock, and then set Auto-Lock to as short a value as 
possible‚Äîyou can set it to as short as 1 minute if you like. 
 Turn off push email and push notifications. 
You can learn more battery life tips by visiting the Apple web site at 
www.apple.com/batteries/iPod touch.html. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
36 
Making the Battery Last Longer 
The iPod touch uses a rechargeable battery that has a limited number of cycles during 
its useful life; in other words, it will gradually lose its ability to maintain a charge over 
time. You can extend the life of your iPod touch battery by making sure you run it down 
completely at least once a month. The rechargeable battery will last longer if you do this. 
Finding More Places to Charge Your iPod touch 
No matter what you do, you will want to find more places and more ways to charge your 
iPod touch if you really use it a lot. Besides using your power cord or connecting your 
iPod touch to your computer, you can take advantage of the charging tips described in 
Table 1‚Äì2. 
Table 1‚Äì2. Other Places and Ways to Charge Your iPod touch 
Airport Charging 
Station 
Today most airports have wall sockets available where you 
can top off your iPod touch while you are waiting for your 
flight. Some airports have labeled charging stations, while 
others simply have wall sockets that may even be hidden 
behind chairs or other objects. You may have to do a bit of 
hunting to beat out all those other power-hungry travelers! 
External Battery Pack 
This accessory allows you to extend the life of your iPod touch 
battery by five times or more. You can buy such an item for 
about US $40‚Äì65. Do a web search for ‚Äúexternal iPod touch 
battery‚Äù to find all the latest and greatest options. 
Car Charger 
If you are using your iPod touch heavily during the day, you 
may want to invest in a car charger or another way to give 
your iPod touch a little more juice in the middle of a long day. 
These chargers plug directly into the cigarette lighter socket 
in your car. These run about US $15‚Äì25. 
Car Power Inverter 
If you are taking a long car trip, you can buy a power inverter 
to convert your 12V car outlets into a power outlet where you 
can plug in your iPod touch charger. Do a web search for 
‚Äúpower inverter for cars‚Äù to find many options for under US 
$50. This is a small price to pay for hours of enjoyment on 
your iPod touch! 
Charge in Other 
Accessories 
As mentioned earlier, you can also charge your iPod touch 
by docking it in many accessories designed to do other 
things, such as play your music over speakers. You need to 
look for the Plug or Lightning Bolt icons to make sure your 
iPod touch is charging in these accessories. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
37 
Setting up Your iPod touch 
At this point, you know some of the basics about your iPod touch and how to get the 
most out of your battery. Now you are ready to start enjoying it! Setting up your iPod 
touch is the next step. 
Knowing If You Need to Set Up Your iPod touch 
If you see a Welcome screen on your iPod touch, you will need to set up your iPod 
touch before you can use it. With iOS 5, you can set up your iPod touch in a couple of 
ways. First, you can do so with over-the-air (OTA) using your Wi-Fi network and iCloud. 
Or, you can plug your iPod touch into your PC using the USB dock cable and activate it 
with the iTunes service. 
If this is your first iPod touch or you want to set it up as a new iPod touch, you probably 
want to use iCloud OTA. 
If you are upgrading from a previous iPod touch model, you probably want to restore 
from a backup using the iTunes service. 
Setting up Your iPod touch Over-the-Air Using iCloud 
With iOS 5, Apple has finally cut the iTunes cord. This means you no longer need to 
connect your iPod touch to your PC to activate it or set it up. Instead, you can activate it 
directly from your iPod touch OTA using Apple‚Äôs new iCloud service. 
NOTE: During the initial set up process, you will be able to connect to any available Wi-Fi network 
which will be needed to set up your iPod touch OTA using iCloud. If your home, work, or school Wi-Fi 
network isn‚Äôt available, and you don‚Äôt have a public access point like Starbucks handy, then you will 
need to activate your iPod touch later. (You could choose to set up your iPod touch via iTunes on your 
PC instead; however, you will still need Internet access to connect to Apple‚Äôs activation servers.) 
Follow these steps to set up your iPod touch with iCloud, as shown in the Welcome 
screen pictured earlier: 
1. Swipe to set up by touching the Arrow button and pulling it across the screen in 
the direction indicated. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
38 
2. Choose the language you want to use with 
your iPod touch. Apple will present you with 
the most common options based on where 
you bought your iPod touch; however, you can 
also tap the Down Arrow for more language 
choices. 
3. When you‚Äôve chosen your preferred language, 
tap the blue Next button at the top right of the 
screen. 
4. Choose your Country or Region. Again, Apple 
will provide you with a default choice based on 
where you bought your iPod touch; however, 
you can tap Show More... to expand the list. 
Tap the blue Next button to continue. 
5. Decide if you would like to enable or disable Location Services, and then tap the 
blue Next button to continue. 
NOTE: Location Services use cell-tower triangulation, and Wi-Fi router mapping to determine the 
approximate location of your iPod touch. This feature is used for check-in games (like 
Foursquare), social networks (like Facebook), geo-tagging (in the Camera app), and utilities (like 
Find my iPod touch). Unless you have a particular need to globally disable all location services, 
you probably want to turn on the Location Services feature right now. You can selectively disable 
or enable these services later in the Settings app (e.g., turn off your Camera app‚Äôs geo-tagging, 
but leave on Find my touch). 
6. Choose your Wi-Fi network, enter your network password, and then tap the blue 
Next button to continue. 
7. Your iPod touch will now connect to Apple for activation. This can take a few 
seconds or up to a few minutes, depending on how fast your connection is and 
how busy Apple‚Äôs servers are. 
8. Once activation is complete, you‚Äôll be given the option to set up your iPod touch 
as a new iPod touch, restore it from an iCloud backup, or restore it from iTunes. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
39 
Setting up a New iPod touch Using iCloud 
If this is your first iPod touch‚Äîor if you simply want a clean, fresh start‚Äîchoose Set up 
as a new iPod touch. 
TIP: Restoring from backups‚Äîespecially from backups of different devices (e.g., restoring an 
iPod touch from an iPad backup)‚Äîcan sometimes lead to problems like more frequent app 
crashes or lower battery life. If you‚Äôre experiencing problems after restoring from a previous 
backup, you might want to try setting your iPod touch up as a new iPod touch. You‚Äôll have to redo 
all your settings and accounts from scratch, and you‚Äôll lose any saved app and game data; 
however, it‚Äôs sometimes your only option if your iPod touch is no longer stable enough for 
everyday use. 
To set up your iPod touch as a new iPod touch, you‚Äôll either need to sign in with an 
existing Apple ID or create a new, free Apple ID. Apple IDs can be any of the following: 
 iTunes ID: This is the e-mail address and password you use to log into 
iTunes and buy music, TV shows, movies, App Store apps and games, 
and iBooks. 
 Free Apple ID: This is the e-mail address and password you use to 
log into Find my iPod touch, FaceTime, Game Center, iCloud, or any 
other recent, free Apple service. This can also be the same ID you use 
to shop at the online Apple Store. 
NOTE: If you‚Äôve been using Apple products and services for a while, it‚Äôs not uncommon for one 
person to have multiple Apple IDs. For example, you might have an iTunes ID and old MobileMe 
account and an Apple Store ID. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, Apple doesn‚Äôt allow IDs to be 
combined, so you‚Äôll have to choose which one you want to use with iCloud.  
If you have an old MobileMe account, Apple will migrate it to iCloud for you. Visit 
http://www.me.com/move to begin the process  
Otherwise, the authors recommend you use your iTunes ID because it will have all your music, 
media, app, and games purchases tied to it, and you‚Äôll be able to use iCloud‚Äôs re-download 
feature to easily restore these purchases to your new devices now and in the future. 
If you have an Apple ID, log in with it now, accept the terms and conditions, and then 
skip ahead to the ‚ÄúConfiguring iCloud Options‚Äù section. If you don‚Äôt have an Apple ID, 
create one now. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
40 
Creating a Free Apple ID 
If you‚Äôve never used iTunes and don‚Äôt have an Apple ID, then you‚Äôll need to create one. 
This can be done quickly, right on your iPod touch: 
1. Tap Create a new Apple ID. 
2. Enter your birthday by spinning the Year, 
Month, and Day rollers to represent the 
proper date, and then tap the blue Next 
button. 
3. Enter your first and last name in the 
appropriate fields, then tap the blue Next 
button. 
4. Choose whether you want to use an existing 
 e-mail address (e.g., a Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo!, or personal e-mail address) or 
create a new iCloud e-mail address (@me.com). If you don‚Äôt want to be bothered 
remembering a new e-mail address, you‚Äôll probably want to use an existing one. If 
you like keeping your e-mail separate, then you‚Äôll probably want to create a new 
one. 
5.  If you‚Äôre creating a new iCloud @me.com address, enter your password and click 
Verify. Your password must be ‚Äústrong‚Äù; that is, it must contain uppercase and 
lowercase letters, at least one number, and be at least eight characters long. 
6. Pick a Security Info question. This is something that should be easy for you to 
remember, but difficult for anyone else to guess easily (which means no one else 
should be able to find the answer just by looking at your blog or Facebook, 
Google, Yahoo!, or other online profile page). 
7. Choose whether you want to receive e-mail updates from Apple at this new 
address. If not, set this option to OFF. 
8. You‚Äôll need to accept the Terms and Conditions twice, first by tapping the blue 
Agree button at the bottom left, and then by tapping the translucent Agree button 
when the pop-up confirmation appears. Again, it might take a few moments to 
verify. 
9. Apple will then set up your new Apple ID. This can take a few moments. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
41 
Configuring iCloud Options 
Once you‚Äôve logged in with your Apple ID, it‚Äôs time to configure your iCloud settings: 
1. If you want to use the Set Up iCloud feature‚Äî
and we recommend you do this because it‚Äôs 
free and provides a host of useful backup and 
syncing features‚Äîthen leave the iCloud option 
set to ON and tap the blue Next button. 
2. Choose whether you want to use the iCloud 
Backup service to wirelessly back up your iPod 
touch over-the-air to Apple‚Äôs data center or to 
your computer over USB with iTunes. Again, 
we recommend using setting iCloud to ON 
because it‚Äôs automatic, and you won‚Äôt have to 
remember to do it. 
3. The Find my iPod touch service is a free part of iCloud that shows you the 
approximate location of your iPod touch (you‚Äôll be able to tell whether it‚Äôs at your 
house or at the office, but not the specific room), make it ring so you can find it 
even if it‚Äôs fallen under the car seat or behind the sofa, or even wipe out all your 
personal data if it‚Äôs lost or stolen. If you want to use this feature, leave this option 
set to ON. 
4. That‚Äôs it! Your iPod TOUCH is now set up, and you can start using it. 
Restoring Your iPod touch Using iCloud 
If you‚Äôve previously used iCloud to back up your iPod touch, you can restore from that 
backup over-the-air right from your device: 
1. Tap Restore from iCloud backup. 
2. Enter your iCloud Apple ID e-mail address and password. 
3. Select which backup you‚Äôd like to restore from. Typically, this will be the most 
recent backup available. 
4. Your iPod touch will reboot, download the backup, and restart. This process can 
take a few minutes, especially if you have a lot of data to restore. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
42 
5. Once your iPod touch has been restored, your apps will begin to download and 
install. iCloud can download and install multiple apps at once, and you can use 
your iPod touch while the restore process is going on. 
Setting up Your iPod touch Using iTunes 
If you don‚Äôt want to use iCloud or you have a previous iTunes back up you‚Äôd like to 
restore from, then you can still set up your iPod touch over USB with your PC. 
If you do not have iTunes loaded on your computer, then open a web browser and go to 
www.itunes.com/download. Download the software from the link provided. 
If you already have iTunes installed on your computer, you should check to see if an 
updated version is available. Version 10.5 was the latest version at the time of 
publishing. Follow these steps to update your version of iTunes: 
1. Start the iTunes app. 
2. If you are a Windows user, select Help from the menu, and then Check for 
Updates. 
3. If you are a Mac user, select iTunes from the menu, and then Check for 
Updates. 
4. If an update is available, then follow the instructions to update iTunes.

Restoring Your iPod touch From a Previous Backup  
The first time you connect your new iPod touch to iTunes, you will see the screen shown 
in Figure 1‚Äì2. 
 
Figure 1‚Äì2. Welcome to your iPod screen 
CAUTION: We have heard of people experiencing problems (e.g., lock-ups and lower battery life) 
when they restore a backup from a non-iPod touch (i.e., an iPad or iPod touch) to the iPod touch. 
Also, selecting Restore assumes you have first made a backup of your old device; otherwise, 
there is no information to restore to your new iPod touch. 
Do the following to restore from the backup of another iPod touch or device:

2. Select the particular backup file from the drop-down menu. 
3. Click the Continue button to restore data to your iPod touch from the 
backup file. You are now done with the initial setup of your iPod touch. 
NOTE: You will still have to sync any apps, games, music, and other media you want to use on 
your new iPod touch. 
Maintaining Your iPod touch 
Now that you have set up your iPod touch with iTunes, you will want to know how to 
safely clean the screen and keep it protected with various cases. 
Cleaning Your iPod touch Screen 
After using your iPod touch a little while, you will see that your fingers (or other fingers 
besides yours) have left smudges and oil on the formerly pristine screen. You will want 
to know how to safely clean the screen. One way to keep the screen cleaner throughout

the day is to place a protective screen cover on the iPod touch, which may also have the 
added benefit of cutting down on glare (discussed in the next section). 
We also recommend the following steps: 
1. Turn off your iPod touch by pressing and holding the Sleep/Power key on the top 
edge, and then use the slider to turn it off. 
2. Remove any cables, such as the USB sync cable. 
3. Rub the screen with a dry, soft, lint-free cloth (like a cloth supplied to clean 
eyeglasses or something similar). 
4. If the dry cloth does not work, then try adding a very little bit of water to dampen 
the cloth. If you use a damp cloth, try not to get any water in the openings. 
5. Another option is the iKlear screen cleaner from Klear Screen.  This product works 
on your iPod touch and other devices such as your computer, laptop or iPad 
screen. 
CAUTION: Never use household cleaners, abrasive cleaners such as SoftScrub, or ammonia-
based cleaners such as Windex, alcohol, aerosol sprays, or solvents. 
Cases and Protective Covers for Your iPod touch 
Once you have your iPod touch in your hands, you will notice how beautifully it is 
constructed. You will also notice that it can be fairly slippery, rock around a bit, or have 
the back get scratched when you are typing on it. 
We recommend buying a protective case for your iPod touch. Average cases run about 
US $10‚Äì40, and fancy leather cases can cost US $100 or more. Spending a little to 
protect your iPod touch, which costs $200 or more, makes good sense. 
Where to Buy Your Covers 
You can purchase an iPod touch protective cover at any of the following locations: 
 Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) 
 The Apple Accessory Store (http://store.apple.com) 
 iLounge (http://ilounge.pricegrabber.com) 
You might also do a web search for ‚ÄúiPod touch cases‚Äù or ‚ÄúiPod touch protective 
covers.‚Äù 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
46 
TIP: You may be able to use a case designed for another type of device or smartphone for your 
iPod touch. If you go this route to save some money, just make sure your iPod touch fits securely 
in the case or cover you choose. 
What to Buy... 
The following sections list some types of cases available for your iPod touch and the 
price ranges you can expect to pay. 
Rubber / Silicone Cases ($10‚Äì30) 
Rubber and silicone cases provide a cushioned grip, absorb iPod touch bumps and 
bruises, and isolate the edges of the iPod touch from your fingers. 
Pros: These cases are inexpensive, colorful, and comfortable to hold.  
Cons: They are not as professional as a leather case. 
Combined Cases with External Battery Packs ($50-80) 
Cases combined with external battery packs serve a couple purposes: they combine the 
protective features of a hard shell case with a rechargeable external battery pack. 
Manufacturers such as Mophie and Case-Mate are busy working on iPod touch versions 
of their cases; with some luck, they will be available by the time you read this book. 
Pros: These cases protect your iPod touch and provide a tremendous boost in your 
battery life‚Äîin some cases, they boost battery life by more than 50%. 
Cons: They add weight and bulk to the iPod touch. 
Waterproof Cases ($10‚Äì40) 
Waterproof cases protect for your iPod touch from water, allowing you to safely use the 
device in the rain, at the pool, at the beach, on a boat, and so on. 
Pros: These cases provide good protection from various sources of water. 
Cons: They can make the touch screen harder to use, and they usually do not protect 
from drops or bumps. 
4

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
47 
Hard Plastic / Metal Case ($20‚Äì40) 
Hard plastic and metal cases provide solid protection against scratches, bumps, and 
short drops. 
Pros: These cases provide superior protection for your iPod touch. 
Cons: They add some bulk and weight. Also, you may need to remove such cases when 
charging your iPod touch, or it might overheat. 
Leather or Special Cases ($50‚Äì100+) 
Leather and other special cases provide more of a luxury feel and protect the iPod 
touch. 
Pros: These cases add a touch of luxury to your iPod touch, while also protecting the 
front and back of the device. 
Cons: They are more expensive and add bulk and weight. 
Screen Protectors ($5‚Äì40) 
Screen and back glass protectors help you protect the screen and back of the iPod 
touch from scratches. 
Pros: These cases help prolong the life of your iPod touch by protecting it against 
scratches; most such cases also decrease screen glare. 
Cons: Some of these cases may increase glare or affect the touch sensitivity of the 
screen. 
iPod touch Basics 
Now that you have your iPod touch charged, with a clean screen, and decked out with a 
new protective case‚Äîlet‚Äôs look at some of the basics for getting around its software. 
Powering On/Off and Sleep/Wake 
To power on your iPod touch, press and hold the Power/Sleep button on the top edge 
of the iPod touch for a few seconds. Simply tapping this button quickly won‚Äôt power on 
the iPod touch if it is completely off‚Äîin that case, you need to hold the button until you 
see the iPod touch power on. 
When you are no longer using your iPod touch, you have two options: you can either put 
it into Sleep mode or turn it off completely (see Figure 1-4). 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
48 
 
Figure 1‚Äì4. Using the Power/Sleep and Home buttons on your iPod touch. 
The advantage of Sleep mode is this: when you want to use your iPod touch again, 
simply tap the Power/Sleep button or the Home button to bring your iPod touch back 
awake. If you want to maximize your battery or if you know you won‚Äôt be using your iPod 
touch for quite some time‚Äîsay when you go to sleep‚Äîyou should turn it off completely. 
The way to do this is to press and hold the Power/Sleep button until you see the Slide 
to Power Off bar appear. Just slide the bar to the right and the iPod touch will power 
off. 
Assistive Touch Accessibility  
As part of its excellent Accessibility features, Apple includes the Assistive Touch feature 
for people with special physical or motor skills needs. These include touch screen 
versions of the hardware buttons, as well as common and custom gestures. 
Follow these steps to enable the Assistive Touch feature:

NOTE: Assistive Touch also allows for 
sophisticated gestures, including custom gestures. 
 
Slide to Unlock and Quick Camera and Media Access  
Once your iPod touch has been activated, you will see the Slide to Unlock screen, as 
shown in Figure 1‚Äì5.  
Double-click the Home button to see media control when you have music playing and, 
more importantly, get instant access to your camera for those times when you want to 
grab a quick picture.  Tap the camera icon next to the slider at the bottom. 
To get into your iPod touch, touch your finger to the screen and follow the path of the 
arrow to move the Slide to Unlock button to the right.  Once you do that, you will see 
your Home screen.

rest of the icons can move back and forth in pages. You can learn how to move your 
favorite icons into the Bottom Dock in the ‚ÄúMoving Icons‚Äù section of Chapter 6: "Icons and 
Folders." 
 
  
  
 
Figure 1‚Äì5. Slide to Unlock, Quick Camera and Media Access and your Home screen. 
Moving Around Inside Apps and Your Settings Screens 
Getting around the screens inside the apps on your iPod touch is as simple as tapping 
the screen: 
1. Tap the Settings icon to start the Settings app. 
2. Touch General to see General settings. 
3. Touch Network to see Network settings. 
4. You can toggle any switch by tapping it. For example, touching the OFF switch 
next to Data Roaming will toggle it to ON. 
5. To go back a level in the screens, touch the button in the upper-left corner. In this 
case, you would touch the General button to leave the Network Settings screen. 
The Home Button 
 
The button you will use most often is your Home button.  This button 
will initiate everything you do with your iPod touch. If your iPod touch 
is sleeping, press the Home button once to wake up your iPod touch 
(assuming it is in Sleep mode).

Pressing the Home button will also take you out of any application program and bring 
you back to your Home screen. 
Access the Fast App Switcher by Double-Clicking the Home 
Button 
Accessing the Fast App Switcher is as simple as double-clicking the Home button. 
1. While in any app or from the Home 
screen, double-click the Home 
button . 
2. The screen will slide up and you will 
see a small bar of icons appear in 
the bottom row. These represent the 
apps that you have started since 
you powered on your iPod touch. 
3. Tap any icon to switch back to that 
app. 
4. Swipe your finger to the left to see 
more apps.  
5. Swipe your finger to the right to see 
the orientation lock and media 
controls.  
6. Swipe your finger to the right again 
to see the volume control and 
AirPlay button. 
 
 
 
Follow these steps to access the Fast App Switcher from a given app: 
Volume Keys  
On the upper-left side of the iPod touch (see Figure 1‚Äì5), you can see some simple 
Volume Up/Volume Down keys that you will find very handy. 
Adjusting Playback or iPod touch Voice Volume 
You can use the Volume keys to raise or lower your iPod touch‚Äôs volume when you are 
listening to music or a video, enjoying other content, or even on a FaceTime call. When 
listening to music or a video, you can also use the on-screen slider bar to adjust volume 
(see Figure 1‚Äì6). 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
52 
Figure 1‚Äì6. Adjusting the volume on your iPod touch  
TIP: When you‚Äôre in the Camera app, the Volume Up button becomes a camera shutter, 
allowing you to quickly snap a picture. 
Locking Your Screen in Portrait (Vertical) Orientation 
If you tilt your iPod touch on its side, you will notice that its screen rotates to Horizontal 
(Landscape) orientation in some apps. You might want this behavior, so you can see the 
larger Landscape keyboard for typing. However, there may be times when you don‚Äôt 
want your screen to rotate from Portrait orientation when you turn your iPod touch on its 
side. For these occasions, you can lock the screen in Portrait orientation. 
1. Double-click the Home button. 
2. Swipe left to right to see the media and screen lock controls. 
3. Touch the Portrait Orientation Lock button in the icon on the left. 
4. To disable the lock, tap the same button again. 
TIP: The orientation lock feature can be a great way to read iBooks in bed. If you prefer the 
larger page view in Portrait mode, enable the Portrait Orientation Lock feature. This way, when 
you set your iPod touch on your lap or hold it almost flat, the screen will not accidentally rotate to 
Landscape mode. For more information, check out Chapter 12: ‚ÄúiBooks and e-Books.‚Äù

Adjusting or Disabling the Auto-Lock Time-Out Feature 
You will notice that your iPod touch will auto-lock and go into Sleep mode (i.e., the 
screen will go blank) after a short amount of time. You can change how long it takes 
your iPod touch to enter Sleep mode or even disable this feature altogether inside the 
Settings app. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Touch the Settings icon from your Home screen. 
2. Touch General. 
3. Touch Auto-Lock. 
4. You will see your current sleep interval setting next to the Auto-Lock option on 
this page. The default setting is that the iPod touch locks after three minutes of 
sitting idle (to save battery life). You can set this interval to 1 Minute, 2 Minutes, 3 
Minutes, 4 Minutes, 5 Minutes, or Never. 
5. Touch the desired setting to select it‚Äîyou know it‚Äôs 
selected when you see a checkmark next to it. 
6. Finally, touch the General button in the upper-left 
corner to get back to the General screen. You 
should now see your change reflected next to the 
Auto-Lock setting. 
BATTERY LIFE TIP: 
Setting the Auto-Lock 
feature to a shorter 
interval (e.g., 1 
Minute) will help you 
save battery life. 
Adjusting the Date, Time, Time Zone, and 24-Hour Format 
Usually, the date and time is either set for you or adjusts when you connect your iPod 
touch to your computer; you can learn more about this in in Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync with 
iCloud, iPod touch and More.‚Äù However, you can manually adjust your date and time 
quite easily. You may want to do this when you are traveling with your iPod touch and 
need to adjust the time zone when you land. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Touch the Settings icon. 
2. Touch General. 
3. Scroll down and touch Date & Time to see the Date & Time settings screen. 
4. If you prefer to see 09:30 and 14:30 
instead of 9:30 AM and 2:30 PM, 
respectively, then tap the 24-Hour Time 
option to set its switch to ON.  
 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
54 
5. To set the date and time manually, you 
have to turn off the automatic time 
setting feature. Tap the switch next to 
Set Automatically to set this option to 
OFF. 
 
 
6. To set your time zone, tap Time Zone 
and type in the name of a major city in 
your time zone. The iPod touch will show 
you matching city names as you type. 
7. When you see the correct city in your 
time zone, tap it to select it. In the image 
here, we typed the first few letters of 
‚ÄúChicago‚Äù until we saw it appear. Next, 
we tapped Chicago, U.S.A. to select it. 
8. After selecting the city, you are brought 
back to the main Date & Time screen 
with your selected city shown next to the 
Time Zone option. 
 
9. Tap Set Date & Time to adjust your date 
and time.  
 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
55 
10. On this screen you can set the date and 
time. To adjust the date, tap the Date 
button shown at the top of the screen. 
11. To adjust the time, tap the Time button 
shown at the top of the screen. 
12. You can then adjusting the date and time 
by touching and sliding the Date and 
Time wheels up or down, as shown in 
the image here. 
13. When you are done, tap the Date & Time 
button in the upper-left corner. 
 
Adjusting the Brightness 
Your iPod touch has an Auto-Brightness control available; this feature is turned on by 
default. This feature uses the built-in light sensor to adjust the brightness of the screen. 
When it is darker outside or at night, then the Auto-Brightness control will dim the 
screen. When it is bright and sunny, the screen will be automatically brightened, so it is 
easier to read. Generally, we advise that you keep this feature set to ON. 
If you want to adjust the brightness, use the controls in your Settings app. Follow these 
steps to do so: 
1. From your Home screen, touch the 
Settings icon. 
2. Touch Brightness and move the 
slider control to adjust the 
brightness. 
3. Click the switch next to Auto-
Brightness to toggle it ON or OFF. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
56 
TIP: Setting the Brightness option to a lower value will help you save battery life. A little less 
than halfway across seems to work fine. 
Notifications 
New to iOS 5, the Notification Center introduces a better, less obtrusive, less interruptive 
way to organize and handle all the FaceTime, e-mail, iMessage, Twitter, Facebook, 
calendar, and other alert messages you receive during the day. 
Notifications can appear in several ways: 
 As Lock screen info, so you can glance at important alerts without 
having to unlock your iPod touch. (This option does sacrifice some 
privacy.) 
 As in-app notifications, which display as brief, rotating alerts across 
the top of the screen whenever a new message is received. 
 In the Notification Center pull-down menu, which you can access 
with a single swipe anywhere, at any time, when your iPod touch is 
unlocked. 
If you‚Äôve had an iPod touch before or used an iPad or iPod touch prior to iOS 5, then 
Notification Center adds to the previous options of sound, number badges, and pop-up 
alerts. Because they‚Äôre non-interruptive, alerts won‚Äôt stop your game of Angry Birds or 
the e-mail message you‚Äôre composing, forcing you to dismiss or open them before you 
can continue playing or writing. However, you still have the option to handle things you 
absolutely don‚Äôt want to miss, such as alarms. 
Lock Screen Info 
Notifications on the Lock screen are displayed in two different ways: as a popup with 
the single, newest notification and as a pull-down list of all recent notifications. 
If you receive a single notification while your iPod touch is locked, the screen will turn 
on, and it will appear in a black box in the center of your Lock screen. It will also show 
an icon on the left that represents the app associated with that type of notification. For 
example, an e-mail message will show the Mail app icon to the left; an iMessage will 
show the Messages icon; a missed FaceTime call will show the FaceTime icon; a 
Facebook notice will show the Facebook icon; and so on. There are several things you 
can do from here: 
 Ignore the notification. This will cause your alert to fade away, and 
your iPod touch‚Äôs screen will go back to sleep. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
57 
 Grab the handle (the three gray lines right 
below the time and date) and drag it down to 
see a list of all the notifications you‚Äôve 
received since the last time you unlocked 
your iPod touch. The list will be sorted by 
notification type, so all e-mail messages will 
be grouped together, as will all calendar events, all missed FaceTime 
calls, and so on. To the left of each notification, you will also see the 
appropriate icon for each alert. 
NOTE: If you don‚Äôt see the handle, it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt have any recent notifications. 
 From either the single notification box or the 
list, tap the icon to the left of the notification 
and Slide to Read (or listen) to the 
notification, just as you would normally Slide 
to Unlock your iPod touch. In most cases, 
you‚Äôll be taken straight to the appropriate app 
with the full notification displayed. For 
example, touching the Mail app icon and 
sliding it will unlock your iPod touch, switch 
to the Mail app, and load up the e-mail you 
just received. 
 
NOTE: A few notifications‚Äîsuch as alarms and system messages like iTunes sync failures‚Äîmight 
also show you a button to the left of the notification, such as Snooze for the alarm or OK for the sync 
failure. Tap the button to delay or dismiss the notification. 
 
TIP: If you‚Äôre concerned about privacy and don‚Äôt like the idea of anyone being able to see your 
personal e-mails, texts, and other messages or alerts on your Lock screen, then you can turn them 
off in the Settings app (see the ‚ÄúConfiguring Notification Center‚Äù section later in this chapter). 
In-App Notifications 
When your iPod touch is unlocked and you‚Äôre busy 
using it, a new notification that comes in will animate 
briefly at the top part of the screen, and then rotate 
down to display the notification. This will happen no 
matter where you are, from the Home screen, to the built-in Messages app, to your 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
58 
favorite video game. The notification covers only a few pixels at the very top, so it 
shouldn‚Äôt get in the way of what you‚Äôre doing (or playing). There are two things you can 
do with an in-app notification: 
 Ignore it and it will rotate back up and disappear. (Don‚Äôt worry: You 
can see the notification again by clicking the Notification Center pull-
down menu, as described later in this chapter.) 
 Tap the notification and you‚Äôll be taken straight to the associated app 
to see the full message. For example, it will take you to the Mail app to 
read an e-mail or the Messages app to reply to an iMessage. 
The Notification Center 
Any time your iPod touch is unlocked, you can swipe 
down from the very top of the screen to pull down the 
Notification Center options. Notification Center 
combines a very limited number of widgets (two at 
the time of writing) and a list of notifications similar to 
what you see on the Lock screen. 
To get rid of Notification Center, swipe back up from 
the bottom of the screen. 
The two widgets available at the time of writing are 
Weather and Stocks: 
 The Weather widget displays the local weather for an area (if location-
based weather is enabled) or whatever city you have set as first in the 
built-in Weather app (if location-based weather is turned off or 
unavailable). It also shows the high, low, and current temperature for 
the day. Tapping anywhere on the widget will take you to the Weather 
app. 
 The Stocks widget shows a ticker of the stocks you follow, along with 
their recent market cap and an arrow showing recent losses or gains. 
The ticker will contain all stocks you currently have set up in the built-
in Stocks app. Tapping anywhere on the widget will take you to the 
Stocks app. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
59 
Notification Center listings are available for the following apps and services: 
 Calendar 
 Reminders 
 Messages (iMessage) 
 Mail 
 Game Center 
 Any additional apps or services you install that use notifications (e.g., 
social networks like Twitter, breaking news apps like CNN, and task 
managers like OmniFocus) 
The notification list is divided by app, with a header 
bar for each app. On the left of the header bar is the app icon, followed by the app 
name. At the right of the header bar, you can see an X icon. Tapping the X icon clears all 
notifications for that app. For example, tapping the X to the right of the Mail icon will 
clear all e-mail notifications; however, this won‚Äôt clear any other notifications. 
Below a header, you will see all current (unread) 
notifications for that app, along with the time they 
were received, who they came from (if applicable) 
and a preview of their contents. For example, you might see a list of recent Facebook 
messages or Game Center challenges. Tapping anywhere on any of the notifications in 
the list will switch you to the associated app and show you the full message. 
Configuring Notification Center 
Notification Center can be easily configured via the Settings app: 
1. Tap the Settings app icon on the Home screen. 
2. Tap Notifications. 
Notification Center can organize notifications By 
Time (widgets on top, then in order of the most 
recent notifications), or you can organize them 
Manually. Follow these steps to manually reorganize 
your notifications: 
1. Under Sort Apps, tap Manually. 
2. At the top right of the screen, tap the Edit 
button. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
60 
3. Handles in the form of three gray, horizontal stripes will appear to the right of each 
app. Grab the handles and drag the apps up or down to put them in the order you 
like best. 
4. When you‚Äôve got all the apps in just the order 
you want them, tap the blue Done button at the 
top right of the screen. 
To show or hide the Weather or Stock widget, tap 
either widget to toggle it ON or OFF, as desired. 
To choose how the notification lists work, follow these 
steps: 
1. Tap the app you want to edit (e.g., Mail).  
2. Switch the Notification Center toggle to OFF 
to remove the app from Notification Center 
completely. Toggle it to ON to put it back. 
3. Choose to Show the number of notifications you prefer in the list. At the time of 
writing, the choices were limited to 1 Unread Item, 5 Unread Items, and 10 
Unread Items. 
4. Choose the Alert Style of the in-app notification you‚Äôd prefer.  
a. None means you‚Äôll never see an alert.  
b. Banner means you‚Äôll get the subtle, animated notification at the 
top of the screen that won‚Äôt interrupt you. This option lets you 
ignore the notification, if you so desire, which is useful for most 
communication notifications like e-mail, iMessage, Facebook, and 
so on. 
c. Alert means you‚Äôll get a pop-up box that you can‚Äôt ignore. You will 
either have to manually dismiss it or act on it right away. This is 
useful for alarms, appointments, and other urgent matters. 
You can also set several other options related to notifications: 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
61 
 Badge App Icon: This option adds a little 
red circle to the top right of Home screen 
icons. This red circle indicates how many 
unread notifications each app contains. 
For example, the number 10 on the Mail 
icon means you have 10 unread e-mail 
messages waiting for you. You can toggle 
this feature to OFF if you would rather not 
see them or to ON if you want them 
displayed. 
 
 Sounds: This option lets you turn audio alerts for incoming 
notifications on or off. If a notification is urgent, like iMessage, you 
might want to keep sounds toggled ON. 
 Show Preview: This option adds the first few lines of a message 
associated with a notification, so you can get the gist of it at a glance. 
This feature enables you to see a notification‚Äôs contents without sliding 
to tap through to the app, so you can read the whole thing. If privacy is 
more of a concern, you might want to toggle this feature to OFF. 
 View in Lock Screen: This option allows you to turn notifications on 
or off from the Lock screen. Again, if privacy is an issue, you might 
want to toggle this feature to OFF. 
NOTE: Not all apps have the same options in Notification Center. For example, some may offer 
sound alerts, while others do not. 
When you turn off notifications for a specific app, it gets put in a separate list under 
Settings called Not in Notification Center. This lets you easily see which apps are‚Äîand 
aren‚Äôt‚Äîsending you notifications. 

CHAPTER 1:  Getting Started 
62 
Accessibility Options For Notification Center 
Apple provides various Accessibility options for people with special visual or hearing 
needs, including Custom Vibrations and LED Flash for Alerts. 
Follow these steps to enable Accessibility 
options for Notifications: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General. 
3. Tap Accessibility near the bottom 
of the page. 
4. Toggle Custom Vibrations to ON
to assign unique vibration patterns 
to your Contacts (patterns can be 
created in the Sound Preferences). 
5. Toggle LED Flash for Alerts to ON
to make the camera flash go off 
when a notification comes in.

Chapter 
Typing, Copy, and Search 
In this chapter, we will show you some good ways to type on your iPod touch and save 
valuable time when doing so. Along the way, we‚Äôll show you how to use the Portrait 
(vertical/smaller) and Landscape (horizontal/larger) keyboards. We will also teach you 
how to select different language keyboards, how to type symbols, and other tips. 
Later in this chapter, we will tell you about the Spotlight search and the Copy and Paste 
function. The Copy and Paste function will save you lots of time, as well as increase your 
accuracy when working with your iPod touch. 
Typing on Your iPod touch 
You will quickly find two on-screen keyboards on your iPod touch: the smaller Portrait 
keyboard that‚Äôs visible when you hold your iPod touch in a vertical orientation and the 
larger Landscape keyboard that‚Äôs visible when you hold the iPod touch in a horizontal 
orientation. The nice thing is that you can choose whichever keyboard works best for 
you.

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
64 
Typing on the Screen with Two Thumbs 
You will find when you first start 
out with your iPod touch that you 
can most easily type with one 
finger‚Äîusually your index 
finger‚Äîwhile holding the iPod 
touch with the other hand. 
After a little while, you should be 
able to experiment with thumb 
typing. Once you practice a little, 
typing with two thumbs instead of 
a single finger will really boost your 
speed. Just be patient: it does 
take practice to become proficient 
typing quickly with your two 
thumbs. 
You will actually notice after a 
while that the keyboard touch 
sensitivity assumes you are typing 
with two thumbs. What this 
means is that the letters on the 
left side of your keyboard are 
meant to be pressed on their left 
side, and the keys on the right are 
meant to be pressed on their right 
side. 
Simply turning the iPod touch 
sideways in many apps will cause 
the keyboard to change to the 
larger Landscape keyboard, 
which makes it easier to type. 
 
 
 
 
TIP: If you have larger hands and find typing on the smaller, vertical keyboard challenging, then 
flip your iPod touch on its side to get the larger, Landscape keyboard. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
65 
Type Quick Phrases with Shortcuts
One nice feature on your iPod touch is the ability to set up shortcuts for typing common 
phrases or even a few sentences like directions to your home or office. 
TIP: Use Shortcuts to save time when typing common phrases on your iPod touch.  You can even 
use Shortcuts to type a few sentences like steps to get to your home or something you type 
frequently. 
Access shortcuts in the Settings app. Tap 
the Settings icon, then General, then 
Keyboard and swipe to the bottom of the 
screen to see available Shortcuts. 
Apple has supplied you with an example 
shortcut for "omw."  When you type omw 
on your iPod touch, you will see that the 
pop-up shows the phrase "On my way!" 
 
Tap Add New Shortcut to create a new 
one. 
 
Type the Phrase which will replace the 
shortcut, then type the Shortcut itself.  In 
this example, we want a shortcut to type 
directions to our home.  So our Shortcut 
is "dirh" and the Phrase is step by step 
directions to get to our house.  Save your 
new shortcut and give it a try. 
 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
66 
Saving Time with Auto-Correction 
After you have been typing for a while, you will begin to notice a little pop-up window 
directly below some of the words you are typing‚Äîthis feature is called Auto-Correction. 
Any Shortcuts that you have defined will also appear as the pop-up suggestion. 
NOTE: If you never see the Auto-
Correction pop-up window, then you will 
have to enable the Auto-Correction 
feature by going into your Settings app > 
General > Keyboard, and then setting 
Auto-Correction to ON. 
 
 
You can save yourself time when you see the correct word guessed by just pressing the 
Space key at the bottom of the keyboard; doing so will select that word. 
In the next example, we start typing the word ‚Äúespecially‚Äù; and when we get to the ‚Äúc‚Äù in 
the word, the correct word appears below in a pop-up window. To select it, we simply 
press the Space key at the bottom (see Figure 2‚Äì1). 
 
Figure 2‚Äì1. Using Auto-Correction and suggested words 
Your first inclination might be to tap the pop-up word, but that simply erases the 
suggested word from the screen. It is ultimately faster to keep typing or press the Space 
Notice pop-up 
suggestions as you 
type. 
Press the Space 
key to accept the 
suggestion. 
Tap the X to 
remove the 
suggested word. 
After pressing the 
Space key, the 
word is inserted. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
67 
key when you see the correct word pop up. In most situations, the word will either be 
correct or will become correct as you keep typing‚Äîand this means less finger travel in 
the long run. 
TIP: The Auto-Correction feature also looks through your Contacts list to make suggestions. For 
example, if Martin Trautschold were in your Contacts list, you would see ‚ÄúTrautschold‚Äù come up 
as an Auto-Correction suggestion after typing ‚ÄúTrauts.‚Äù 
After you learn to use the Space key, you will see that this pop-up guessing can be 
quite a time saver. After all, you were going to have to type a space at the end of the 
word, anyway.   
Sometimes you accidentally accept an incorrect Auto-Correction word; in this case, you 
simply need to press the Backspace key. 
  Doing so will make a pop-up 
window appear that contains the original word before the Auto-Correction feature 
changed it. You will also see other suggested replacements (see Figure 2‚Äì2). 
 
 
Figure 2‚Äì2. Dealing with Auto-Correction words that are not correct 
TIP: With Auto-Correction, you can save time by avoiding typing the apostrophe in many 
common contractions, such as ‚Äúwont‚Äù and ‚Äúcant.‚Äù Auto-Correction will show you a little pop-up 
window with the contraction spelled correctly; all you need to do to select the highlighted 
correction is press the Space key. 
Pressing the Space key 
will select the Auto-
Correction pop-up word. 
Press the Backspace 
key, then tap the pop-
up to change the word 
back. 
Notice the word is 
changed back to what 
you originally typed. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
68 
With some words, you have to add an extra character for the Auto-Correction feature to 
figure out what you mean: 
 Type ‚ÄúWeree‚Äù to get ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre.‚Äù 
 Type ‚ÄúWelll‚Äù to get ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll.‚Äù  
 
 
 
Hearing Auto-Correction Words Out Loud 
You can set your iPod touch to speak the Auto-text and Auto-Correction words as they 
appear. This might help you to select the correct word. Follow these steps to enable this 
type of speaking: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General. 
3. Tap Accessibility near the bottom of the page (you need to swipe down). 
4. Set the switch next to Speak Auto-text to ON. 
After you enable this feature, you will hear the Auto-Correction word that pops up 
spoken aloud as you are typing. If you agree with the word you hear, press the Space 
key to accept it; otherwise, keep typing. This can save you some time from looking up 
from the keyboard. 
Spell Checker 
Working together with the Auto-Correction feature is your built-in iPod touch Spell 
Checker. Most of the time, your misspelled words will be caught and corrected 
automatically by Auto-Correction. Other times, a word will not be corrected, but it is still 
misspelled. You will see any words that the iPod touch thinks are misspelled underlined 
with a red dotted line, as shown in Figure 2‚Äì3. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
69 
 
Figure 2‚Äì3. Using the built-in Spell Checker feature 
TIP: If your Spell Checker has too many incorrect words, then you can give it a fresh start by 
clearing out all the custom words. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. 
Tap your Settings icon. 
2. 
Tap General. 
3. 
Tap Reset near the bottom. 
4. Tap Reset Keyboard Dictionary. 
5. Tap Reset Dictionary to confirm. 
Following the preceding steps will clear out all custom words that have been added to your iPod 
touch‚Äôs dictionary. 
Accessibility Options 
There are a number of useful features on the iPod touch to help with accessibility. For 
example, the VoiceOver option will read various things displayed on the screen to you. It 
will tell you what elements you tap, what buttons are selected, and all the options 
available. It will read entire screens of text, as well. If you like to see things larger, you 
can also turn on the Zoom option, as described in the ‚ÄúUsing Zoom to Magnify the 
Entire Screen‚Äù section later in this chapter. 
Getting Your iPod touch to Speak To You (VoiceOver) 
One cool iPod touch feature is the VoiceOver option. Turning this on will make your iPod 
touch speak anything displayed on the screen. You can even get it to read to you from 
any e-mail, text document, or even an iBook page. 
Misspelled words 
are underlined in 
red. 
Tap the word to 
see correction 
options. 
The word you 
select is shown. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
70 
TIP: Use your headphones when the VoiceOver option is set to ON and you are in a public place; 
this will help you hear what is said more easily, but avoid bothering others. 
Follow these steps to enable the VoiceOver feature: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General. 
3. Tap Accessibility near the bottom of the 
page. 
4. Tap VoiceOver. 
5. Set the VoiceOver switch to ON. 
CAUTION: As shown on the screen to the right, 
the VoiceOver gestures are different from the 
normal gestures. Tap the Practice VoiceOver 
Gestures button to get used to them. 
 
 
Here are some additional tips for using the 
VoiceOver feature: 
 Scroll down the VoiceOver screen to see 
more settings. 
 Adjust whether or not hints are spoken by 
changing the setting for the Speak Hints 
option. 
 When you type with VoiceOver, by default 
every character you type will be spoken. 
You can change this by tapping Typing 
Feedback. On the next screen, you can 
set this option to Characters, Words, 
Characters and Words, or Nothing. 
 Adjust the Speaking Rate by sliding the 
bar beneath this option. 
 Adjust whether Phonetics and Pitch 
Change are used by setting the switches. 
 
 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
71 
To have an entire page read to you in the Notes or iBooks app, you need to 
simultaneously tap the bottom and top of the block of text on the screen. If you tap in 
the text with one finger, only a single line is read to you.   
Speak Selection and Speak Auto-text 
The Speak Selection feature is similar to 
VoiceOver, but it ties into the Copy and 
Paste feature, adding a Speak option to 
the selected text pop-up menu. The Speak 
Auto-text feature will say out loud any text 
that is automatically capitalized or 
corrected by the spelling dictionary. 
With the Speak Selection feature, you can 
adjust the Speaking Rate using the same 
type of slider that the VoiceOver feature 
uses. The Speak Auto-text option can only 
be toggled ON or OFF. 
 
 
Using AssistiveTouch 
If you have difficulty touching the screen or have a special accessory that helps you with 
the touch screen, you will want to turn on AssistiveTouch.  You do this in the same 
Accessibility section of Settings.     
Once you turn it on, you will see a small 
white circle in the lower right corner of 
your screen.  Tap the small circle to 
bring up the AssistiveTouch menu. 
 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
72 
Assistive touch will allow you to do the 
following:  
 Tap Gestures, to simulate, 2, 3, 4 
or 5 finger gestures. 

Tap Favorites to access your 
custom gestures. 

Tap Device to access common 
device commands such as screen 
rotation, mute, volume, shake and 
lock screen. 

Tap the Home icon to simulate 
actually clicking the Home button. 
You can even set up custom gestures to 
access from the Favorites menu.  
Tap Create New Gesture, then use your 
fingers to make an on-screen gesture by 
moving your fingers on the screen.  You 
will see white lines follow the location of 
your finger tips. 
Then, tap the Stop button.   
Press Play to see if your gesture is correct 
and finally, tap Save at the top and give 
your new gesture a name. 
You will then see your new gesture appear 
in the Favorites menu in AssistiveTouch. 
Using Zoom to Magnify the Entire Screen 
You may want to turn on the Zoom feature if you find the text, icons, buttons, or 
anything else on the screen a little too hard to see. With the Zoom feature turned on, you 
can zoom the entire screen to almost twice its normal size‚Äîeverything is much easier to 
read. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
73 
NOTE: You cannot use VoiceOver and Zoom at the same time; you need to choose one or the 
other. Instead of magnifying the entire screen, you can also increase just the font sizes for your 
major apps using the Large Text feature. We will show you how in the ‚ÄúUse Larger Text Size for 
Easier Reading‚Äù section. 
Follow these steps to enable the Zoom feature: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General. 
3. Tap Accessibility near the bottom of the 
page. 
4. Tap Zoom. 
5. Set the switch next to Zoom to ON. 
Similar to VoiceOver, Zoom uses three-fingered 
gestures. Make sure to study these before you 
leave this screen. 
 
 
White on Black 
If the contrast and colors on your screen are difficult to see, then you might want to set 
the White on Black setting to ON. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Go to the Accessibility screen in the Settings app, as shown previously. 
2. Set the White on Black switch to ON. With this option set to ON, everything that 
was light on the screen becomes black, and everything that was dark or black 
becomes white. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
74 
Use Larger Text Size for Easier Reading  
You can really expand the size of your fonts in the Contacts, Mail, Messages, and 
Notes apps by using the Large Text feature. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General. 
3. Tap Accessibility near the bottom of the 
page (you need to swipe down). 
4. Tap Large Text. You will then see a 
screen of font size options: Off, 20pt 
text, 24pt text, 32pt text, 40pt text, 48pt 
text, and 56pt text. Tap the size you 
want to use. The image shown to the 
right uses the 48pt font. 
5. Tap the Accessibility button in the 
upper-left corner to return to the previous 
screen, then tap the Home button to exit 
Settings. 
 
 
 
Triple-Click Home Button Options 
You can set a triple-click of the Home button to do various things related to 
accessibility. Follow these steps to adjust these options: 
1. Go to the Accessibility screen in the Settings app, as shown previously. 
2. Tap Triple-click the Home Button near the bottom of the page. 
3. Choose from Off, Toggle VoiceOver, Toggle White on Black, or Ask. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
75 
Using the Magnifying Glass for Editing Text or 
Placing the Cursor 
How many times have you been typing something and wanted to move the cursor 
precisely between two words or letters? 
This can be hard to do until you figure out the Magnifying Glass trick. What you do is 
this: Touch and hold your finger on the place where you want the cursor (see Figure 2‚Äì
4). After a second or two, you will see the Magnifying Glass icon appear. Then, as you 
hold your finger on the screen, slide it around to position the cursor. When you let go, 
you will see the Copy and Paste pop-up menu, but you can ignore it. 
  
 
Figure 2‚Äì4. Touch and hold the screen to see the Magnifying Glass icon and place the cursor. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
76 
Typing Numbers and Symbols 
How do you type a number or a symbol using the iPod touch‚Äôs on-screen keyboard? 
When you are typing, tap the 123 key in the lower-left corner to see numbers and common 
symbols such as $ ! ~ & = # . _ - +. If you need more symbols, from the Numbers 
keyboard tap the #+= key just above the ABC key in the lower-left corner (see Figure 2‚Äì5). 
  
 
 
Figure 2‚Äì5. Switching between the Letters, Numbers, and Symbols keyboards 
TIP: After you type a number or symbol, notice that the Numbers keyboard will stay active until 
you either hit the Space key or press the key for another keyboard, such as the ABC key for the 
Letters keyboard. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
77 
Touch and Slide Trick 
One cool technique that you can apply in various areas is the touch-and-slide trick. We‚Äôll 
cover what this is and how you can take advantage of it in the next couple of sections. 
Typing Uppercase Letters 
To type uppercase letters, you would 
normally press the Shift key, and then 
press the desired letter. 
The faster way to type single uppercase 
letters and symbols that require the Shift 
key is to press the Shift key, keep your 
finger on the keyboard, slide over to the 
key you want, and then release. 
For example, to type an uppercase ‚ÄúD,‚Äù 
press the right Shift key, then slide over to 
the D key and release. 
 
Rapidly Typing a Single Number 
If you have to type just a single number, then press the 123 key and slide your finger up 
to the number. However, to type several numbers in a row, it‚Äôs best to press the 123 
key, let go, and then press each number. 
Touch Shi 
and slide 
to the 
leer.

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
78 
Press and Hold Keyboard Shortcut for Typing Symbols and 
More 
You might wonder how you can type symbols not 
shown on the keyboard. 
TIP: You can type more symbols than are shown 
on the screen. 
All you do is press and hold a letter, number, or 
symbol that is related to the symbol you want. 
For example, if you want to type the YEN 
symbol (¬•), you press and hold the $ key until 
you see the other options. Next, slide up your 
finger to highlight the YEN symbol, and then let 
go.
 
This tip also works with the .com key in the Safari 
web browser and when typing e-mail addresses 
by pressing and holding the Period (.) key. You 
can get additional web site suffixes by pressing 
and holding the .com or Period keys. 
  
 
The preceding figure shows the .co, uk, .ie, .de, .ca, and .eu keys. These keys are not 
displayed on the standard US keyboard, but they are present in this case because we 
have installed additional international keyboards. You will learn how to enable 
international keyboards in the ‚ÄúTyping in Other Languages‚ÄîInternational Keyboards‚Äù 
section later in this chapter. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
79 
TIP: A Few More Useful but Hidden Symbols 
There is a good bullet point character on the Symbols keyboard just above the Backspace key. 
You can also get a degree symbol if you press and hold the Zero key (0). Also, you can press and 
hold the ? and ! keys to get their inverted Spanish cousins. 
Caps Lock 
You double-press the Shift key to turn on the Caps Lock feature. You know it‚Äôs turned 
on when the Shift key turns blue. 
 
To turn off Caps Lock, simply press the Shift key 
 again. 
Quickly Selecting and Deleting or Changing Text 
You may need to quickly change or delete some text you are typing. Follow these steps 
to do so: 
1. Select a part of the text you want to 
change or delete by double-tapping 
it.  
 
 
2. Adjust the selection by dragging the 
blue handles. 
 
3. To erase the selected text, press the 
Backspace key. 
 
 
 
4. To replace the text, simply start typing. The text will be instantly replaced by the 
letters you type.

Keyboard Options and Settings 
There are a few keyboard options to make typing on 
your iPod touch easier. These keyboard options are 
located in the General tab of your Settings app. Follow 
these steps to access them: 
1. Tap the Settings icon.
2. Tap General.
3. Swipe up, then tap Keyboard near the bottom of 
the page.
Setting Auto-Correction to ON or OFF 
As noted earlier in this chapter, the Auto-Correction feature will use the iPod touch‚Äôs 
built-in dictionary to automatically make changes to commonly misspelled words. You 
need to make sure it is ON if you want this feature to work. (This is the default setting.) 
Auto-Capitalization 
When you start a new sentence, words will 
automatically be capitalized if the Auto-
Capitalization option is set to ON. 
This feature will also correctly capitalize common 
proper nouns. For example, if you type ‚ÄúNew york,‚Äù 
then you will be prompted to change it to ‚ÄúNew 
York‚Äù‚Äîagain, just pressing the Space key will 
implement the correction. If you backspace over a 
capital letter, the iPod touch will assume the new 
letter you type should be capitalized, as well. This 
feature is also set to ON by default.
 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
81 
Enabling Caps Lock 
Sometimes you may want to type only capital letters; to do so, simply double-tap the 
Caps key. 
This feature is set to OFF by default. 
The ‚Äú.‚Äù Shortcut 
If you double-press the Space key, it will automatically put in a period at the end of a 
sentence; this feature is set to ON by default. 
Typing in Other Languages‚ÄîInternational 
Keyboards 
At the time of writing, the iPod touch enables you to type in more than a dozen different 
languages, including everything from Dutch to Spanish. Some of the Asian languages, 
such as Japanese and Chinese, offer two or three keyboards for different typing 
methods. 
Adding a New International Keyboard 
Follow these steps to enable various language keyboards: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General.  
3. Tap Keyboard near the bottom of the page. 
4. Tap International Keyboards. 
5. Tap Add New Keyboard. 
6. Tap any keyboard or language listed to add it. You will now see the keyboard 
appear on the list of available keyboards. 
7. There is a good bullet point character on the Symbols keyboard just above the 
Backspace key. You can also get a degree symbol if you press and hold the 
Zero key (0). Also, you can press and hold the ? and ! keys to get their inverted 
Spanish cousins. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
82 
TIP: iOS 5 includes a built ‚Äìin Emoji keyboard. Emoji 
is an extensive collection of Japanese symbols, 
including various smiley and frowny faces, holiday 
images, buildings and vehicles, and much more. 
While their meanings are more specific in Japan, 
people around the world have begun using them in 
SMS, Twitter, and other online messaging services.  
The Emoji keyboard can be added in Settings just like 
any other keyboard. 
Editing, Re-Ordering, or Deleting Keyboards 
You may want to adjust options for a keyboard, re-order how the keyboards appear in a 
list, or simply remove a keyboard that you no longer use. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Follow Steps 1‚Äì4 under the ‚ÄúAdding a New International Keyboard‚Äù section earlier 
in this chapter; this will let you view the list of international keyboards. 
2. To adjust options for a specific keyboard, tap it in the list of keyboards. In our 
example, we tapped French (Canada). 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
83 
3. Change the Software Keyboard 
Layout by tapping the choice in that 
section. 
4. Adjust the Hardware Keyboard 
Layout by tapping a choice in that 
section. 
5. Tap the Keyboards button in the 
upper-left corner to save your 
choices and return to the list of 
keyboards. 
 
6. To re-order or delete a keyboard, tap the Edit button in the upper-right corner. 
7. To change the order of keyboards, touch and drag the right edge of the 
keyboard with the three gray bars up or down. 
 
8. To delete a keyboard, tap the 
Red Minus Sign so it swings to 
the vertical position, then tap 
Delete. 
9. To finish editing your keyboards, 
tap the Done button in the 
upper-right corner. 
 
 
You will notice a little Globe key appears when you install at least one international 
keyboard. Press the Globe key to cycle between all the languages. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
84 
TIP: You can press and hold the Globe 
key to see a list of available keyboards. 
This will enable you to quickly select the 
keyboard you wish to use. If 
 
Japanese, Chinese, and some other languages provide several keyboard options to 
meet your typing preferences. 
In some of the languages (such as Japanese), you will see the letters typed change into 
characters, or you can draw the characters yourself. You may also see a row of other 
character combinations above the keyboard. When you see the combination you want, 
tap it. 
Copy and Paste 
The Copy and Paste feature is very useful for saving time and increasing your typing 
accuracy. You can use this feature to take text from your e-mail (such as meeting 
details) and paste it into your calendar. Or you may want to simply copy an e-mail 
address from one place in a form into another to save yourself the time required to 
retype it. (We show you this technique in the ‚ÄúSetup Exchange/Google Account‚Äù section 
of Chapter 4: ‚ÄúOther Ways to Sync.‚Äù) There are many places to use Copy and Paste; the 
more comfortable you are with it, the more you will use it. You can even copy text or 
images from your Safari web browser and paste them into a Notes or Mail message. 
Selecting Text by Double-Tapping It 
If you are reading or typing text, you can double-tap it to start selecting some text to 
copy. This works well in the Mail, Messages, and Notes apps. 
You will see a box with blue dots 
(handles) at opposite corners. 
 
 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
85 
Just drag the handles to select 
the text you wish to highlight and 
copy. 
 
 
TIP: If you want to select all the text, tap 
the cursor or double-tap the screen 
above or below the text. This will display 
a pop-up window that shows you Select 
and Select All options. Tap Select to 
select a word or tap Select All to 
highlight all the text. 
 
Selecting Text with Two-Finger Touch 
The other way to select text requires that you touch the screen simultaneously with two 
fingers. This seems to work best if you are holding your iPod touch with one hand and 
use your thumb and forefinger from your other hand to touch the screen. You can also 
set the iPod touch down on the table and touch the screen with a finger from both 
hands. Follow these steps to use this approach: 
1. Touch the screen simultaneously at the beginning and end of the text you want to 
select. Don‚Äôt worry if you cannot get the selection exactly on the first touch. 
2. After the two-finger touch, use the blue handles to drag the beginning and end of 
the selection to the correct positions. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
86 
Selecting a Web Site or Other Non-Editable Text with Touch 
and Hold 
In the Safari web browser and other places where you 
cannot edit the text, hold your finger on some text and 
the paragraph will become highlighted with handles at 
each of the corners. 
Next, drag the handles if you want to select even 
more text. 
NOTE: If you drag smaller than a paragraph, the 
selector will switch to fine-text mode and give you 
the blue handles on both ends of the selection to pick 
just the characters or words you want. If you drag 
your finger beyond a paragraph, you get the gross-
text selector, which you can drag up or down to 
select whole reams of text and graphics. 
 
Cut or Copy the Text 
Once you have highlighted the 
text that you wish to copy, just 
touch the Copy tab at the top of 
the screen. The tab will turn blue, 
indicating that the text is on the 
clipboard. 
NOTE: If you have previously 
cut or copied text, then you 
will also see the Paste option, 
as shown to the right. 
 
 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
87 
App Switching and Multitasking 
After you copy text, you may want to paste it into another app. For example, you might 
want to copy some text from Safari and paste it into Notes or a Mail message. The 
easiest way to jump between apps is to use the App Switcher app. Follow these steps 
to paste text from one app into another: 
1. Copy or cut your text. 
2. Double-tap the Home button to bring up the App Switcher app on the bottom of 
your screen  
3. If you just left an app running in the background, you will be able to find it in the 
App Switcher bar. 
4. Swipe right or left to find the app you want and tap it. 
5. If you don‚Äôt see the app you want in the App Switcher bar, then tap the Home 
button and start it from the Home screen. 
6. Now, paste the text by pressing and holding the screen, and then selecting Paste 
from the pop-up window. 
7. Double-tap the Home button again and tap the app you just left to jump back to it. 
Pasting the Text 
Pasting the text into the same app is easy. For example, simply follow these steps to 
paste the text into the same Notes or Mail message: 
1. Use your finger to move the cursor to where you want to paste the text. 
Remember the Magnifying Glass trick we showed earlier in this chapter; this can 
help you position the cursor.
2. Once you let go of the screen, you should see a pop-up window asking whether 
you to Select, Select All, or Paste.
3. If you don‚Äôt see this pop-up window, then double-tap the screen.
4. Select Paste to paste your selection.

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
88 
Shake to Undo  
One of the great features of the iPod touch is the 
ability to undo typing, copy and pasting.  
All you have to do is shake the iPod touch after the 
paste. A new pop-up window will appear that gives 
you the option to undo what you have just done.  
Tap Undo Typing or Undo Paste to correct the 
mistake. 
TIP: Delete Text Quickly 
If you ever want to delete a number of lines of text, a paragraph, or even all the text you just 
typed quickly with only one or two taps, this tip is for you. First, use the techniques described 
previously to select the text you want to delete. Next, simply press the Delete key 
 in the 
lower-left corner of the keyboard to delete all the selected text. 
Finding Things with Spotlight Search 
The Spotlight Search is a great feature on your iPod touch that helps you find 
information. This is a proprietary search method from Apple for performing a global 
search on your iPod touch. You can use this feature to search for a name, event, or 
subject. 
The concept is simple. Let‚Äôs say you are looking for something related to Martin. You 
cannot remember if it was an e-mail, a document in Notes, or a Calendar event; 
however, you do know it was related to Martin. 
This is the perfect time to use the Spotlight Search feature to find everything related to 
Martin on your iPod touch. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
89 
Activating Spotlight Search 
First, you need to bring up the Spotlight 
Search page, which resides to the left of 
the first page of the Home screen. 
 
On the left side of the first circle 
(indicating the first page of your Home 
screen), you can see a very small 
Magnifying Glass icon. 
Swipe your finger from left to right on the 
first page of icons to see the Spotlight 
Search page. You can also press the 
Home button from your first screen of 
Icons to see this same search page. 
Follow these steps to perform a search 
with this feature: 
1. On the Spotlight Search page, type in one or more words as your search 
parameters.  
2. Tap the Search button in the lower-right corner to execute your search. 
TIP: If you are looking for a person, type his full name to more accurately find items from only 
that person (for example, ‚ÄúMartin Trautschold‚Äù). This will eliminate any other Martins who might 
be in your iPod touch, enabling you to find items only related to Martin Trautschold. 
3. In the search result, you‚Äôll see all e-mails, appointments, meeting invitations, and 
contact information the search finds. Swipe down to see more results. 
4. Tap one of the results in the list to view its contents. 
Your search results stay there until you clear them. This means you can return to the 
Spotlight Search page to view your prior search results simply by swiping to the right 
from your Home screen. 
To clear the Search field, just touch the X in the Search bar. To exit the Spotlight 
Search page, just press the Home key or swipe to the left. 

CHAPTER 2:  Typing, Copy, and Search 
90 
Searching the Web or Wikipedia 
After you perform a Spotlight Search, you will see two options beneath your results: 
Search Web and Search Wikipedia. 
Tap either of these options to execute your search on the Web or in Wikipedia. 
Customizing Spotlight Search 
You can customize your Spotlight Search by removing certain apps or types of data 
from the search. You can even change the order in which each type of data is searched. 
This might be useful if you want to search only your Contacts and Mail messages‚Äîand 
nothing else. Or, if you know that you always want to search Mail first, then Calendar, 
and then Music‚Äîyou could set those items in the proper order. Follow these steps to 
do so: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General. 
3. Tap Spotlight Search. 
4. To change the order of the items 
searched, touch and drag the 
right edge of the item with the 
three gray bars up or down. 
5. To remove a specific item from 
the search, tap it to remove the 
Checkmark icon next to it. 
Unchecked items are not 
searched by Spotlight Search. 
6. Tap the General button in the 
upper-left corner to return to the 
Settings app.

Chapter 
Sync with iCloud, iTunes, 
and More 
In this chapter, we will show you how to set up or adjust your storage and push your 
information to Apple‚Äôs new iCloud service, as well as how to synchronize information 
between your iPod touch and your Windows or Mac computer using iTunes. 
With iCloud, you can wirelessly sync your mail, contacts, calendars, reminders, 
bookmarks, notes, photos, and documents and data, as well as back up your iPod 
touch wirelessly over-the-air (OTA). With iTunes, you can sync or transfer contacts, 
calendar, notes, apps, music, videos, iBooks, documents, and picture libraries, as well 
as back up your iPod touch. 
And, because nothing ever works right all the time, we‚Äôll show you a few simple 
troubleshooting tips. Finally, we‚Äôll show you how to check for updates and install 
updated operating system software for your iPod touch. 
iCloud 
iCloud is free, easy to set up, and easy to use. In most cases, it is the best way to sync 
your personal information, music, TV shows (U.S. only), and apps. It is also the best way 
to handle backups and to restore your phone. Unless you have very specific reasons not 
to, we highly recommend using iCloud for most of your syncing needs, but the iTunes 
app for anything iCloud doesn‚Äôt yet handle (like movies). 
iCloud also lets you re-download previous iTunes, iBookstore, and App Store 
purchases, but your iCloud ID can also be used with iMessage, FaceTime, and other 
free Apple services. 
3 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
92 
NOTE: Apple is very careful not to use the word sync when it comes to iCloud. Instead, it says 
store and push. The difference is largely technical and has to do with how Apple is moving your 
data around. 
The important thing to remember is that, when you change something on your iPod touch, Apple 
copies the change to its servers and then sends copies back down to all your other iCloud-
enabled iOS devices, as well as to your Windows or Mac PC. 
Setting up iCloud 
In Chapter 1: ‚ÄúGetting Started,‚Äù we showed you how 
to enable iCloud while setting up your new iPod touch 
or restoring from a previous iCloud backup. Once 
iCloud is enabled, you can easily turn various services 
on or off. 
Start by launching the Settings app and scrolling 
down to iCloud. 
Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, 
Bookmarks, Notes, and Find my iPod can easily be 
toggled to ON or OFF directly from this screen. 
For the Photo Stream option, you need to tap the 
tab first to get to the On/Off toggle. 
NOTE: At the time of writing, Photo Stream is an all-or-nothing service. If Photo Stream is turned 
on, Apple will keep 1000 of your most recent photos for up to 30 days on its servers, copying 
them to your iPad, Apple TV, Mac, or Windows PC. Anything logged into iCloud will get a copy of 
your Photo Stream. If you take photos of a sensitive or personal nature, you might want to set the 
Photo Stream option to Off. 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
93 
Likewise, you can tap Documents and Data to 
toggle this option ON or OFF.  
 
Managing iCloud Storage and Backup 
iCloud comes with 5GB of free storage. Music from 
iTunes, apps, iBooks, and your Photo Stream don‚Äôt 
count against your 5GB, so most people will still have 
plenty of space left over for app data, documents, 
and backups. 
To check your iCloud Storage, scroll down to the 
bottom and tap Storage and Backup. 
The Storage section shows you Total Storage, or 
the full size of your iCloud account; and Available 
Storage shows how much total storage you have left. 
At the bottom of the screen, you can toggle iCloud 
Backup to ON or OFF. 
NOTE: For most users, most of the time, we strongly 
recommend the iCloud Backup option be toggled to 
ON and left that way. 
You can tap the Back Up Now button if you ever 
need to back up your iPod touch immediately. You 
might do this if you want to reinstall your iPod touch, 
switch to a replacement or new iPod touch, or intend 
to go on a trip and want to make sure your phone is 
backed up before you leave. 
 
 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
94 
To see how your iCloud storage is being used, tap 
Manage Storage. 
 
 
 
At the top of the Manage Storage screen, you‚Äôll see 
a list of devices currently backed up to iCloud. This 
will include your iPod touch and any other iOS 
devices you might own, like an iPad or iPod touch. 
Tap the device you want to look at and you‚Äôll be 
taken to the Info screen, which shows when your 
Latest Backup took place and the Backup Size. 
 
 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
95 
The Backup Options section lets you individually 
toggle different types of backups on or off , including 
the Camera Roll and any apps you might have 
installed that sync their settings or data with iCloud. 
This section also tells you how much storage each 
app is using. 
Initially, you‚Äôll only see a few apps. Tap See All Apps 
for the full list. Setting an app to OFF means you‚Äôll 
save on storage space, but your data will no longer 
be synced between your iOS devices, nor will it be 
restored if you ever reinstall your device or the app. 
 
 
TIP: Your iPod touch‚Äôs big, 8 megapixel, 1080p camera means that backing up the Camera Roll 
can quickly eat up a lot of storage, especially if you have only the free 5GB plan. The Photo 
Stream feature already backs up your photos; if backing up your video isn‚Äôt a concern, then you 
can toggle Camera Roll backups to OFF to save space. 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
96 
Buying More iCloud Storage 
You might find yourself constantly running out of 
iCloud storage, decide you want to start backing up 
more photos and videos, or discover you need to 
back up multiple iOS devices. If so, you can buy 
more iCloud Storage from Apple. 
Simply tap any of the Buy More Storage buttons 
peppered throughout the iCloud‚Äôs Settings 
screens. At the time of writing, additional iCloud 
storage costs were as follows: 
 10GB for US $20/year 
 20GB for US $40/year 
 50GB for US $100/year 
  
 
iTunes in the Cloud 
iCloud also includes the iTunes in the Cloud feature, which lets you re-download 
previously purchased apps. In some countries, it even lets you re-download iBooks, 
music, and even TV shows. This means you can download them to your iPod touch 
whenever you like, delete them when you no longer need them, and then re-download 
them again when you want them back. 
To learn more about re-downloading files from iTunes, see Chapter 21: ‚ÄúiTunes on Your 
Device,‚Äù Chapter 22: ‚ÄúThe Amazing App Store,‚Äù and Chapter 12: ‚ÄúiBooks and E-Books.‚Äù  
You can also set up your iPod touch to automatically download any new apps, iBooks, 
subscription Newsstand issues, music, and TV shows purchased on any device or 
computer associated with your iTunes account. If you buy a new song on your PC or a 
new app on your iPod touch, then that song or app will immediately download and show 
up on your iPod touch, as well. 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
97 
Follow these steps to turn on automatic 
downloads: 
1. Launch Settings. 
2. Tap Store. 
3. Toggle Music, Apps, and Books to 
ON. 
 
iCloud on the Computer 
iCloud doesn‚Äôt just sync your information between your iPod touch and Apple‚Äôs servers 
or between your iOS devices. It can also sync information between your iPod touch and 
your Windows or Mac PC. 
If you‚Äôre a Windows user, you can turn syncing on or off for several apps and services in 
the iCloud Control Panel for Windows (see Figure 3‚Äì1). Apps and services you can 
sync with include Mail, Contacts, Calendars & Tasks, and Reminders, among others. 
 
Figure 3‚Äì1. iCloud Control Panel for Windows 
If you‚Äôre a Mac OS X user, you can turn these options on or off in the OS X 7.2 Lion 
iCloud Systems Settings panel (see Figure 3‚Äì2).

Syncing with iTunes 
There are a few things you need before you can start using iTunes to sync. In the 
upcoming sections, we will cover the prerequisites and answer a few common questions 
about the reasons to use iTunes. We will also help you understand what happens if you 
own another Apple device, such as an iPhone or iPad, and start syncing with your iPod 
touch. 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
99 
Prerequisites  
There are just a few things you need to do before you sync your iPod touch with iTunes: 
TIP: If you followed all the steps in Chapter 1: ‚ÄúGetting Started,‚Äù chances are you‚Äôve already 
completed the steps listed below and the initial sync of your contacts, calendar, bookmarks, 
notes, and email accounts to your iPod touch. If so, you may want to skip ahead to the ‚ÄúApps: 
Sync and Manage Them‚Äù section later in this chapter. 
1. Make sure you‚Äôve installed version 10.5 or higher of the iTunes app on your 
computer. For help with installing or updating iTunes, see Chapter 21: ‚ÄúiTunes on 
Your Device.‚Äù 
2. Make sure you have your iTunes account ID handy. This is the email address and 
password you use to buy music, apps, and other content from iTunes. 
3. Get the white sync cable that came with your iPod touch. One end plugs into the 
bottom of your iPod touch near the Home button, and the other plugs into the 
USB port on your computer. 
Syncing iTunes with an iPhone or iPad and Your iPod 
touch? 
You might wonder whether you can sync iTunes with multiple devices, such as your 
iPhone or iPad and your iPod touch. Yes, you can! As long as you are syncing to the 
same computer, you can sync several Apple devices (Apple says up to five, but we‚Äôve 
heard of people syncing more) to the same iTunes account on a single computer. 
CAUTION: You can‚Äôt sync the same iPod touch, iPad, or iPhone to two different computers. If you 
attempt to do this, you‚Äôll see a message like this: ‚ÄúWould you like to wipe this device (iPod touch, 
iPad, iPhone) and resync the new library?‚Äù If you answer Yes, any music and videos on the 
device will be erased. 
There Are Other Sync Methods‚ÄîShould I Use iTunes? 
iCloud is both free and the easiest way to keep your iPod touch in sync with your other 
devices, while iTunes is there to help you with large files, movies, and other content that 
iCloud doesn‚Äôt yet handle. You can also use other approaches to synchronize certain 
data, such as your personal information and email (including Exchange/Google). Keep in 
mind, however, that even if you choose one of these other approaches, you‚Äôll still need 
to use iCloud and/or iTunes to accomplish the following: 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
100 
 Back up and restore files and data on your iPod touch 
 Update the iPod touch operating system software 
 Sync and manage your applications (apps) 
 Sync your music library and playlists 
 Sync movies, TV shows, podcasts, and iTunes U content  
 Sync books 
 Sync photos 
Table 3‚Äì1 summarizes your synchronization options. What method you choose to use 
for synchronization should be driven by where you currently store your email, contacts, 
and calendar; your environment; and whether you want to have a wireless sync. 
NOTE: Some environments let you wirelessly sync your contacts and calendars to your iPod 
touch.

Set Up Your iTunes Sync 
Next, we will show you all the steps for using the iTunes app to perform both automated 
syncs and manual transfers of information to your iPod touch. 
The iPod touch Summary Screen 
The iPod touch‚Äôs Summary tab in iTunes is where you see and update your version of 
your iPod touch operating system software. It also contains an important switch related 
to syncing music, video, and other content. This tab is also where you can choose to 
automatically open iTunes (to sync) whenever you connect your iPod touch to your 
computer. 
Once you connect your iPod touch to your computer, you can see important 
information, like your iPod touch‚Äôs memory capacity, installed software version, and 
serial number (see Figure 3‚Äì4). You can also check for updates to the software version, 
restore data to your iPod touch, and choose from the several options available on this 
screen. 
In particular, you can decide whether you want to Manually manage music and videos
using the checkbox at the bottom of this screen. 
Figure 3‚Äì4. The iPod touch‚Äôs Summary screen in iTunes 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
103 
Follow these steps to see the Summary screen: 
1. Start the iTunes software on your computer. 
2. Connect your iPod touch to your computer with the white USB cable 
supplied with the device. Plug one end into the bottom of the iPod touch 
near the Home button and the other end into a USB port on your 
computer. 
3. If you‚Äôve successfully connected your iPod touch, you should see your 
iPod touch listed under DEVICES in the left nav bar. 
4. Click your iPod touch in the left nav bar, and then click the Summary 
tab on the top-left edge of the main window. 
5. If you want to be able to drag and drop music and videos onto your 
iPod touch, check the box next to Manually manage music and 
videos. 
6. If you want to have iTunes open and sync your iPod touch automatically 
whenever you connect it to your computer, check the box next to Open 
iTunes when this iPod touch is connected. 
TIP: Note that the iTunes software might not be installed on your primary computer (the one you 
use for syncing). For example, it might be installed on a second computer that you use for 
charging your iPod touch. If so, you should check the box next to Manually manage music and 
videos and uncheck the box next to Open iTunes when this iPod touch is connected. 
Getting to the Sync Setup Screen (Info Tab) 
Let‚Äôs assume you want to get to the Info tab, which is the setup screen for syncing your 
contacts, calendar, email, and so forth. To do so, you follow the same steps described 
previously for getting to the Summary screen, except now you click the Info tab at the 
top to see the Contacts (and other sync settings) in the main iTunes window (see 
Figure 3‚Äì5). 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
104 
 
 
Figure 3‚Äì5. The iTunes‚Äô Info tab, where you set up contacts, calendar, bookmarks, and more 
NOTE: If you are already set up to sync 
your information using iCloud, you will see 
this warning and not be able to use 
iTunes, because iCloud already is syncing 
your information.  If you see this warning, 
then you can skip syncing Mail, Contacts 
and Calendars using iTunes. 
 
Sync Your Contacts 
Let‚Äôs start by setting up syncing for your contacts. The first step is to choose a service 
to sync with. To do so, check the box next to Sync Contacts with and adjust the pull-
down menu to the software or service where your contacts are stored. At publication 
time, you have several syncing options on a Windows computer: Outlook, Google 
Contacts, Windows Contacts, and the Yahoo! Address Book.

105 
CAUTION: Whenever you switch between a software or service (called the sync provider) in 
these sync settings screens, it affects every one of the mobile devices connected to your iTunes 
account. For example, if you sync contacts to your iPad or iPod touch, these changes will also 
affect MobileMe. You will be changing the way contacts sync for any other devices connected to 
your iTunes account. 
. 
Syncing with Google Contacts 
If you select Google Contacts, you‚Äôll be prompted to enter your Google ID and 
password. 
To change your Google ID or password, click the Configure button next to the Sync 
Contacts with option you saw at the top of this section. 
Syncing with the Yahoo! Address Book 
If you select Yahoo! Contacts, you‚Äôll be prompted to enter your Yahoo! ID and 
password. 
To change your Yahoo! ID or password, click the Configure button next to the Sync 
Contacts with option you saw at the top of this section. 
NOTE: The options you see in this and other drop-down boxes on the Info tab will vary slightly, 
depending on the software installed on your computer. For example, on a Mac the contacts sync 
does not have a drop-down list; instead the other services, such as Google Contacts and Yahoo!, 
are shown as separate checkboxes. 
Once you select a service or app to sync with, you‚Äôre ready to follow through on syncing 
your contacts: 
1. Select which contacts you will sync with from either of these options: 
a. All Contacts: Sync all contacts in your address book (this is the 
default).  

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
106 
b. Selected Groups: Sync contacts only within specific groups that 
you check in the window below. 
2. You will see a checkbox that says Add contacts created outside of 
groups on this iPod touch to (select a group from the drop-down list). 
This option lets you specify a new group for any new contacts you add 
on your iPod touch that you don‚Äôt explicitly assign to a group. 
3. Scroll down the page to continue setting up your calendar, email, and 
more. 
4. If you don‚Äôt want to set up anything else for syncing, click the Apply 
button in the lower-right corner of the iTunes screen to start the sync. 
NOTE: Depending on how many contacts you have, the initial sync could take longer than 10 
minutes, and may even require 30 or more minutes. So you may want to do this sync when you 
can let your iPod touch sit for as long as it takes (e.g., during lunch or after dinner). 
Syncing Your Calendar 
Syncing your calendar is similar to syncing your contacts. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Within the same Info tab, scroll down to see the calendar sync set up. 
2. Check the box next to Sync Calendars with and adjust the pull-down 
menu to the software or service that stores your calendars. This might 
be Outlook or another application on a Windows computer, and iCal on 
a Mac. 
3. Select either of these options: 
a. All Calendars: Syncs all calendars (this is the default).  
b. Selected Calendars: Syncs only calendars you‚Äôve checked in the 
window below. 
4. If you want to save space on your iPod touch, click the checkbox next 
to Do not sync events older than 30 days. You can adjust the days up 
or down to fit your needs. 
5. Scroll down the page to continue setting up email accounts, bookmarks 
and more. 
6. If you don‚Äôt want to set up anything else for syncing, click the Apply 
button in the lower-right corner of the iTunes screen to start the sync. 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
107 
Syncing Email Accounts 
Scroll down the page to sync email account settings. 
NOTE: After syncing the email account settings to your iPod touch, you‚Äôll still have to enter your 
password for each email account in Settings ‚úû Mail, Contacts, Calendar. You have to do this 
only once on your iPod touch for each account. 
Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Scroll down below the Calendar settings on the same Info tab in 
iTunes to see the Mail account settings. 
2. Check the box next to Sync Mail Accounts from and adjust the pull-
down menu to the software or service that stores your email (see Figure 
3‚Äì6). This might be Outlook on a Windows computer, or Entourage or 
Mail on a Mac. 
 
 
Figure 3‚Äì6. Setting up email accounts to sync 
3. Scroll down the page to continue setting up bookmarks, notes, and 
more. 
4. If you do not want to set anything else up for sync, then click the Apply 
button in the lower-right corner of the iTunes screen to start the sync. 

CHAPTER 3:  Sync with iCloud, iTunes, and More 
108 
Syncing Bookmarks and Notes 
One great feature of the iTunes sync is that you can sync the browser bookmarks from 
your computer to your iPod touch. This allows you to start browsing on your iPod touch 
with all your favorite sites immediately. You can also sync your notes from your 
computer to your iPod touch and keep them up-to-date in both places using iTunes. 
NOTE: At the time of writing, iTunes supports only two web browsers for synchronization: 
Microsoft Internet Explorer and Apple Safari. If you use Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, 
you can still sync your bookmarks, but you‚Äôll have to install free bookmark syncing software 
(such as xmarks from www.xmarks.com) to sync from Firefox or Chrome to Safari or Explorer. 
Once you install this software, you can sync your browser bookmarks in a simple, two-step 
process. Firefox‚Äôs Home app is a nice option for syncing bookmarks for Firefox users (visit 
http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/firefox-home/id380366933?mt=8 for more 
information). 
Syncing Your iPod touch with iTunes 
The syncing process is normally automatic when you plug in your iPod touch to your 
computer‚Äôs USB port. The only exception is if you have disabled the automatic sync 
feature. 
Sync Apps in iTunes 
Follow these steps to sync and manage apps with the iTunes app: 
1. As you did to set up the sync previously, connect your iPod touch to 
your computer, start iTunes, and click your iPod touch in the left nav 
bar. 
2. Click the Apps tab on the top of the main window. 
3. Click the checkbox next to Sync Apps to see all apps stored on your 
iPod touch and your Home screens, as shown in Figure 3‚Äì7.

 Delete a folder: Remove all apps from that folder (drag them out) and 
it will disappear. 
Removing or Reinstalling Apps 
To remove an app from your iPod touch, simply uncheck the box next to it and confirm 
your selection. 
TIP: Even if you delete an app from your iPod touch, you can still reinstall that app by rechecking 
the box next to it, as long as you have chosen to sync apps. The app will be reloaded onto your 
iPod touch during the next sync. 
Syncing Media and More 
Now let‚Äôs look at how to set up an automatic sync for music, movies, iBooks, iTunes U 
content, and more. 
CAUTION: Make sure you‚Äôre logged into iTunes with the same iTunes account you want to use 
on your iPod touch as Digital Rights Management (DRM)-protected content (e.g., music, videos, 
and so on). Your content won‚Äôt sync unless both accounts match. You can log out and log into

Updating Your iPod touch Operating System 
With iOS 5 you can now update your iPod touch operating system on-device. There are 
faster, more efficient update methods for doing this, and we recommend you use them 
whenever possible. If you need to re-install the entire OS, however, or want to upgrade 
via iTunes instead, this section will explain how to do so. 
NOTE: Do this update when you won‚Äôt mind being without your iPod touch for 30 minutes or 
more, depending on the amount of information on your iPod touch and the speed of your 
computer and Internet connection. 
Normally, iTunes will automatically check for updates on a set schedule, about every 
two weeks. If no update is found, iTunes will tell you when it will check for another

is available and ask if you would like to update. Click Yes or Update to do so. 
8. iTunes will take you through a few screens that describe the update and 
ask you to agree to the software license. If you agree, click Next and 
Agree to download the latest iOS software from Apple. This will take 
about five to ten minutes. 
TIP: We show you all the screens you might see in this update process in the ‚ÄúReinstalling the 
iPod touch Operating System‚Äù section of Chapter 25: ‚ÄúTroubleshooting.‚Äù 
9. Next, iTunes will back up your iPod touch, a process that might take ten 
minutes or more if your iPod touch is filled with data. 
10. Now the new iOS will be installed, and your iPod touch will be erased.

Chapter 
Connect to the Network 
We live in a connected world. Wireless Internet (Wi-Fi) access has become the rule, not 
the exception‚Äîand chances are you‚Äôre already using Wi-Fi at your home or office. Now 
you can use it to connect your iPod touch to the Internet.  
In this chapter, we‚Äôll show you all the ways to get connected or disconnected from 
virtually any form of Wi-Fi network, whether open or secure. If you work at an 
organization with a VPN (Virtual Private Network), we will show you how to get 
connected to that network. 
What Can I Do When I‚Äôm Connected to a Wi-Fi Network? 
Here are some of the things you can do when connected to a Wi-Fi network: 
 Access and download apps (programs) from the App Store. 
 Access and download music, videos, podcasts, and more from the 
iTunes app on your iPod touch. 
 Browse the web using Safari. 
 Send and receive email messages. 
 Use social networking sites that require an Internet connection like 
Facebook, Twitter, and so on. 
 Play games that use a live Internet connection. 
 Do anything else that requires an Internet connection. 
NOTE: iPod touch has support for the faster, longer range 802.11n standard. However, it only 
supports 802.11n on the more crowded 2.4 MHz band, not the less crowded 5 MHz band. If you 
want to use iPod touch with your 802.11n Wi-Fi router, make sure it‚Äôs either a dual-band router 
or set the router to 2.4 MHz.

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
126 
Connecting to a Wi-Fi Network 
To set up your Wi-Fi connection, follow 
these steps: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap Wi-Fi near the top. 
3. Make sure the Wi-Fi switch is set 
to ON. If it is currently OFF, then 
tap it to turn it ON. 
4. Once Wi-Fi is ON, the iPod touch 
will automatically start looking for 
wireless networks. 
5. The list of accessible networks is 
shown below the Choose a 
Network... option. This 
screenshot shows that we have 
one network available. 
 
6. To connect to any network listed, just touch the network name. If the 
network is unsecure (does not have a Lock icon), you will be connected 
automatically. 
Connecting at a Public Wi-Fi Hotspot with Web Login 
In some locations where they offer free Wi-Fi networks, such as coffee shops, hotels, or 
restaurants; you will see a pop-up window appear as soon as your iPod touch comes 
into contact with the network. In these cases, simply tap the network name. You may be 
brought to a Safari browser screen to complete your login to the network: 
1. If you see a pop-up window similar 
to the one shown, tap the network 
name you wish to join. In the case 
to the right, we tap the Panera 
network. 
 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
127 
2. In some cases, you may see a 
Safari window pop up, which can 
be quite confusing because it is so 
small on your iPod touch‚Äôs screen. 
You need to use the double-tap or 
pinch-open gesture (see the Quick 
Start Guide for help) to zoom in on 
the Web page. You are looking for 
a button that says Login, Agree, or 
something similar. Tap that button 
to complete the connection. 
 
NOTE: Some places, like coffee shops, use a web-based login instead of a username/password 
screen. In those cases, when you click the network (or try to use Safari), your iPod touch will 
open a browser screen, and you‚Äôll see the web page along with your login options. 
Secure Wi-Fi Networks‚ÄîEntering a Password  
Some Wi-Fi networks require a password to 
connect. This is set when the network administrator 
creates the wireless network. You will have to know 
the exact password, including whether it is case-
sensitive. 
If the network does require a password, then you will 
be taken to the Enter Password screen. Type the 
password exactly as given to you and press the 
Enter key on the on-screen keyboard (which is now 
labeled Join). 
On the Network screen, you‚Äôll see a Checkmark 
icon showing that you are connected to the network. 
  
 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
128 
TIP: You can paste into the password dialog; so for longer, random passwords, you can transfer 
them to your iPod touch (in an email message) and just copy and paste them. Just remember to 
delete the email immediately afterwards, so you can keep things secure. Tap and hold the 
password in the mail message, select it, and then tap Copy. In the Wi-Fi network Password 
field, tap and then select Paste. 
    
. 
Switching to a Different Wi-Fi Network 
At times you may want to change your active Wi-Fi network. This might occur if you are 
in a hotel, apartment, or other place where the network selected by the iPod touch is not 
the strongest network, or you want to use a secure network instead of an unsecure one. 
To switch from the currently selected Wi-Fi network, tap the Settings icon, touch Wi-Fi, 
and then touch the name of the Wi-Fi network you want to join. If that network requires a 
password, you‚Äôll need to enter it to join. 
Once you type the correct password (or if you touched an open network), your iPod 
touch will join that network. 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
129 
Verifying Your Wi-Fi Connection  
It is easy to see if you are connected to a network 
(and which one) by looking next to the Wi-Fi setting 
in your main Settings screen. Follow these steps to 
check your Wi-Fi connection status: 
1. Tap your Settings icon. 
2. Look next to the Wi-Fi option at the 
top: 
 If you see Not Connected, you do 
not have an active Wi-Fi 
connection.  
 If you see some other name, such 
as Panera, then you are connected 
to that Wi-Fi network.
Advanced Wi-Fi Options (Hidden or Undiscoverable 
Networks) 
Sometimes you may not be able to see the network you want to join because the name 
has been hidden (the SSID is not being broadcast) by the network administrator. Next, you 
will learn how to join such networks on your iPod touch. Once you have joined such a 
network, you will join that network automatically the next time you come into contact with 
it‚Äîwith no prompt from your iPod touch. You can also tell your iPod touch to ask every 
time it joins a network; we will show you how to do that, as well. Sometimes you may want 
to erase or forget a network. For example, perhaps you were at a one-time convention and 
want to get rid of the associated network‚Äîyou‚Äôll learn how to do that, too. 
Why Can‚Äôt I See the Wi-Fi Network I Want to Join? 
Sometimes, for security reasons, people don‚Äôt make their networks discoverable (they 
hide the network name, called the SSID), and you have to manually enter the name and 
security options to connect to it. 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
130 
As you can see, your list of available 
networks includes Other.  
1. Tap the Other button, and you can 
manually enter the name of a 
network you would like to join. 
 
 
2. Type in the Wi-Fi network Name. 
3. Tap the Security tab. 
 
4. Choose which type of security is 
being used on that network. If you 
are unsure, you‚Äôll need to find out 
from the network administrator. 
When you have the information you need, 
enter it along with the proper password, 
and this new network will be saved to your 
network list for future access. 
 
 
Reconnecting to Previously Joined Wi-Fi Networks 
The nice thing about the iPod touch is that, when you return to an area with a Wi-Fi 
network you previously joined (whether it was an open or a secure, password-protected, 
network), your iPod touch will automatically join the network again without asking you 
first. However, you can turn off this automatic-joining feature, as described in the next 
section. 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
131 
The Ask to Join Networks Main Switch 
There is a main Ask to Join Networks switch, which is set to ON by default. Known 
networks are joined automatically, but this only takes effect if no known networks are 
available. With this switch set to ON, you will be asked to join visible Wi-Fi networks. If 
networks are available that are not known to you, you will be asked before being 
connected. 
If the switch is set to OFF, you will have to manually 
join unknown networks. 
Why might you want to turn off this feature? 
Doing so could be a good security measure if, for 
example, you don‚Äôt want your kids to be able to join 
a wireless network on the iPod touch without your 
knowledge. 
It can also be annoying if your iPod touch is 
continuously popping up the Join Network 
connector screen in areas where you don‚Äôt want to 
join Wi-Fi, such as when traveling through a place 
with many hotspots.
 
Ask to Join and Ask to Login Switch on Each Network 
Sometimes, you may find that a particular 
Wi-Fi network has additional switches that 
override the main Ask to Join Networks 
switch. Tap the little blue Arrow icon 
 next to the network name to see 
details about this Wi-Fi network. Auto-
Join and Auto-Login are set to ON by 
default. 
To disable Auto-Join or Auto-Login, tap 
each switch to set it to OFF. 
 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
132 
Forget (or Erase) a Network 
If you find that you no longer want to connect to
a network on your list, you can Forget it‚Äîi.e., 
take it off your list of networks. Follow these 
steps to do so: 
1.
Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap Wi-Fi to see your list of networks. 
3. Tap the small blue Arrow 
 next to 
the network you want to forget in order to
see the screen shown here. 
4. Tap Forget this Network at the top of 
the screen. 
5.
You will be prompted with a warning. 
Just touch Forget and the network will 
no longer show up on your list. 
Flying on an Airplane: Airplane Mode 
Often when you are flying on an airplane, the flight crew will ask you to turn off all 
portable electronic devices for takeoff and landing. Then, when you get to a certain 
altitude, the crew will say that ‚Äúall approved electronic devices‚Äù can be turned back on. 
If you need to turn off your iPod touch completely, press and hold the Power button on 
the top-right edge, and then Slide to Power Off with your finger. 
Since the iPod touch is a Wi-Fi only device, why would you want or need to go into 
Airplane Mode or turn off Wi-Fi? The iPod touch has other radios as well, like Bluetooth, 
and Airplane mode is a quick way to turn everything off at once. 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
133 
Also, if you're low on battery life and don't need internet access, turning off Wi-Fi or 
going into Airplane Mode Is a quick way to stretch out your remaining battery life as 
much as possible. 
In order to enable Airplane Mode, follow 
these steps: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Set the switch next to Airplane 
Mode in the top of the left column 
to ON. 
3. Notice that the Wi-Fi is 
automatically turned OFF. 
TIP: Some airlines have in-flight Wi-Fi 
networks. On those flights, you may 
want to turn your Wi-Fi back ON at the 
appropriate time. 
 
You can turn your Wi-Fi connection OFF or ON by following these steps: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap Wi-Fi near the top of the 
screen. 
3. To enable the Wi-Fi connections, 
set the switch next to Wi-Fi in the 
top of the page to ON. 
4. To disable Wi-Fi, set the same 
switch to OFF. 
5. Select the Wi-Fi network and follow 
the steps given by the flight 
attendant to get connected. 
 
 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
134 
VPN: Virtual Private Network 
Your organization may have what is called a VPN, or Virtual Private Network. A VPN 
allows you to securely connect your iPod touch, laptop, or other device to the corporate 
network. 
Getting Connected 
In order to get connected, you need to determine the type of VPN and specific login 
instructions from your organization‚Äôs help desk or network administrator. Then, you will 
type these login details into the VPN area in the Settings app on your iPod touch. 
TIP: You can probably save yourself a call to the help desk and skip Step 1 if you have already 
set up your computer to connect to the VPN. This is because your iPod touch will most likely use 
the same VPN login credentials as your computer. 
Step 1: Contact Your Organization‚Äôs Help Desk 
You need to ask your help desk or VPN administrator for the details about how to log 
into the VPN. Your iPod touch can currently connect with the following types of VPNs: 
L2TP, PPTP, and IPSec (Cisco). You also need to know if your VPN uses a Proxy and 
whether the configuration is manual or automatic. 
Step 2: Set Up the VPN Connection on Your iPod touch 
Armed with the login instructions and type of VPN connection, you are ready to connect 
with your iPod touch: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General.  
3. Tap Network. 
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the 
screen and tap VPN. 
 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
135 
5. On the VPN screen, tap the switch 
next to the VPN option to set it to ON. 
You should then be taken to the Add 
Configuration screen. If not, then tap 
Add VPN Configuration at the bottom 
to set up a new VPN connection. 
 
6. The Add Configuration screen is 
where you set up your VPN login 
details, using the information from your 
help desk or VPN administrator. 
7. If your VPN is an L2TP type, then you 
would use the screen shown here. 
Scroll to the bottom and enter the 
Proxy information as required. 
 
 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
136 
8. If your VPN is a PPTP type, then you 
would tap PPTP at the top and use the 
screen shown here. Scroll to the 
bottom and enter the Proxy 
information as required. 
 
 
9. If your VPN is an IPSec (Cisco) type, 
then you would tap IPSec and use the 
screen shown here. Scroll to the 
bottom and enter the Proxy 
information as required. 
10. When you are done with your setup, 
tap the Save button in the upper-right 
corner. 
11. If you have trouble logging in, make 
sure you are in a strong wireless 
coverage area and verify you have 
typed all your login credentials 
correctly. It can be difficult when 
passwords disappear as you type 
them. You may want to try re-typing 
passwords and server information 
before calling the help desk. 
 

CHAPTER 4:  Connect to the Network 
137 
Knowing When You Are Connected to a VPN Network 
You will see a small VPN icon 
 just to the right of your network connection 
status display. You will know that you are securely connected to the VPN network only 
when you see this icon. 
Switching VPN Networks 
You may have several VPN networks to which you need to connect. You can select 
between different VPN configurations on your iPod touch by following these steps: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General. 
3. Tap Network. 
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and tap VPN. 
5. On the VPN screen, tap a different VPN configuration to connect to it. 
Don‚Äôt tap the blue Circle icon with the > symbol, unless you want to 
change the login settings for that network.

Chapter 
AirPlay and Bluetooth 
In this chapter, we will show you how to connect your iPod touch with any AirPlay‚Äì or 
Bluetooth‚Äìcompatible device, whether it‚Äôs an Apple TV, stereo speakers, or a wireless 
headset. 
Understanding AirPlay 
AirPlay is Apple‚Äôs proprietary video and audio streaming protocol. AirPlay 
works over your local home, school, or office Wi-Fi network. Before you can 
use AirPlay with the iPod touch, you have to make sure all your devices are 
connected to the same Wi-Fi network. 
 
AirPlay Devices That Work with the iPod touch 
At the time of writing, only the 2010 model Apple TV supports AirPlay video streaming. 
With it, you can stream content right from your iPod touch to your big screen TV to 
share with business colleagues, friends, and family alike. 
Apple‚Äôs AirPort Express Wi-Fi router has an audio out jack that can be connected to 
speakers for AirPlay audio. Various third-party accessory makers are also introducing 
AirPlay‚Äìcompatible speakers. With AirPlay, you can remotely control the playback and 
volume right from your iPod touch. 
Setting Up and Using AirPlay 
AirPlay is built right into the iPod touch. As long as all your devices are connected to the 
same Wi-Fi network, no additional setup is needed. 
5 

CHAPTER 5:  AirPlay and Bluetooth 
140 
Several of the built-in iPod touch apps support 
AirPlay, including Videos, Music, and YouTube. 
Several App Store apps that use Apple‚Äôs default 
media player (e.g., Air Video) also support 
AirPlay. Follow these steps to use AirPlay from 
an app that supports the feature: 
1. Tap the blue AirPlay icon at the lower-
right corner of the screen. 
2. Choose from the list of available devices 
for streaming your music. 
3. To switch the video or music back to your 
iPod touch, just tap the AirPlay icon again 
and choose iPod touch from the list. 
NOTE: The AirPlay icon will bring up a list of both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connected devices. See 
the next section for more on Bluetooth. 
You can select Apple TV by tapping it. Now your music or video will now start to play 
from the selected AirPlay device. You can verify this by touching the AirPlay icon on the 
screen once more. You should see a Checkmark icon next to the new AirPlay Stereo 
Bluetooth device, and you should hear your music coming from that sound source, as 
well. 
TIP: To save battery life on your iPod touch, turn off the screen by pressing the Sleep button 
while streaming AirPlay content to another device. Your music or video will continue to play, but 
you won‚Äôt be wasting battery life by keeping your screen lit. 

CHAPTER 5:  AirPlay and Bluetooth 
141 
AirPlay Mirroring 
The current iPod touch does more than let you 
stream video or music from your iPod touch to 
an Apple TV; it also lets you share the screen of 
any app‚Äîfrom a business presentation at work, 
to a board game with the family, to a video call 
with distant relatives. Being able to take 
Keynote or Infinity Blade or FaceTime from 
the small iPod touch screen to a giant television 
set really transforms what was an intimate 
personal experience into a fun social activity. 
Follow these steps to use the AirPlay Mirroring 
feature: 
4. Tap the app you want to mirror. For this 
example, we‚Äôre using Infinity Blade. 
5. Once the app has launched, double-click 
the Home button to bring up the Fast 
App Switcher. 
6. Swipe from left to right to get to the 
audio/video controls. (They‚Äôre all the way 
at the end, so keep swiping until you 
can‚Äôt swipe any more.) 
7. Tap the AirPlay button to bring up the 
list of AirPlay‚Äìenabled devices on your 
Wi-Fi network. 
8. Select Apple TV.  
9. Toggle the Airplay Mirroring switch to 
ON. 
10. Click the Home button again to return to 
your app. 
11. You should now see Infinity Blade on 
the big screen. Let ‚Äôem have it! 
To stop AirPlay Mirroring, repeat the same 
procedure and choose iPod touch from the 
device list. 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 5:  AirPlay and Bluetooth 
142 
Understanding Bluetooth 
Apple‚Äôs latest iPod touch supports Bluetooth 4.0, which includes traditional Bluetooth 
functionality, along with more advanced high speed and low power capabilities. This 
means you can talk or listen to music with better quality for longer than ever before. 
Thanks to the technology known as A2DP, you can also stream your music to a 
Bluetooth‚Äìcapable stereo device, including many newer automotive stereos and car kits. 
NOTE: You must have a third-party Bluetooth‚Äìcapable adapter or Bluetooth‚Äìcapable stereo to 
stream your music via Bluetooth technology. 
Understanding Bluetooth 
Bluetooth allows your iPod touch to communicate with things wirelessly. 
Bluetooth is a small radio that transmits from each device. Before you can 
use a peripheral with the iPod touch, you have to pair that device with your 
iPod touch. Many Bluetooth devices can be used up to 30 feet away from 
the iPod touch. 
 
Bluetooth Devices that Work with the iPod touch 
Among other things, the iPod touch works with Bluetooth headphones, Bluetooth stereo 
systems and adapters, Bluetooth keyboards, Bluetooth car stereo systems, Bluetooth 
headsets, and hands-free devices. The iPod touch supports A2DP, which is known as 
Stereo Bluetooth; and AVRCP, which allows you to remotely control playback and 
volume. 
Pairing with a Bluetooth Device 
Your primary uses for Bluetooth might be with Bluetooth headphones or Bluetooth 
stereo adapters . Any Bluetooth headphones should work well with your iPod touch. To 
start using any Bluetooth device, you need to first pair (connect) it with your iPod touch. 

CHAPTER 5:  AirPlay and Bluetooth 
143 
Turning On Bluetooth  
The first step to using Bluetooth is to turn 
the Bluetooth radio on. Follow these steps
to do so: 
1. Tap your Settings app. 
2. Then, tap General. 
3. Tap Bluetooth. By default, 
Bluetooth is initially set to Off on 
the iPod touch. Tap the switch to 
move it to the On position. 
   
TIP: Bluetooth is an added drain on 
your battery. If you don‚Äôt plan on using 
Bluetooth for a period of time, think 
about setting the switch back to Off.
  
Pairing with a Headset or Any Bluetooth Device 
As soon as you turn Bluetooth on, the iPod touch will begin to search for any nearby 
Bluetooth devices, such as a Bluetooth headset or stereo adapter (see Figure 5‚Äì1). For 
the iPod touch to find your Bluetooth headset, you need to put that device into pairing 
mode. Read the instructions that came with your headset carefully‚Äîusually there is a 
combination of buttons to push to achieve this. 
TIP: Some headsets require you to press and hold a button for five seconds until you see a series 
of flashing blue or red/blue lights. Some accessories, such as the Apple wireless Bluetooth 
keyboard, automatically start up in pairing mode. 

CHAPTER 5:  AirPlay and Bluetooth 
144 
Once the iPod touch detects the Bluetooth device, it will attempt to automatically pair 
with it. If pairing takes place automatically, there is nothing more for you to do. 
 
Figure 5‚Äì1. Bluetooth device discovered, but not yet paired 
NOTE: Some Bluetooth devices (e.g., a headset) may ask you to enter a series of numbers (a 
passkey) on the keyboard itself (see Figure 5‚Äì2). 
 
Figure 5‚Äì2. Type in the four-digit passkey when prompted during the pairing process. 
Type in the four-digit 
PIN code provided by 
the headset 
manufacturer. 

CHAPTER 5:  AirPlay and Bluetooth 
145 
Newer headsets‚Äîlike the Aliph Jawbone ICON 
used here‚Äîwill automatically pair with your 
iPod touch. Simply put the headset into pairing 
mode and set your iPod touch‚Äôs Bluetooth 
option to ON‚Äîthat‚Äôs all you have to do! 
Pairing will be automatic and you should never 
have to re-pair the headset again.
Bluetooth Stereo (A2DP)  
 
One of the great features of today‚Äôs advanced Bluetooth technology is the 
ability to stream your music without wires via Bluetooth. The fancy name 
for this technology is A2DP, but it is more simply known as Stereo 
Bluetooth. 
Connecting to a Stereo Bluetooth Device 
The first step to using Stereo Bluetooth is 
to connect to a Stereo Bluetooth‚Äìcapable 
device. This can be a car stereo with this 
technology built in or a pair of Bluetooth 
headphones or speakers. 
Begin by putting the Bluetooth device into 
pairing mode per the manufacturer‚Äôs 
instructions, and then go to the Bluetooth 
setting page from the Settings icon, as 
shown earlier in the chapter. 
Once connected, you will see the new 
Stereo Bluetooth device listed under your 
Bluetooth devices. Sometimes you will see 
the name or part of the name; other times 
you will simply see ‚ÄúHeadset.‚Äù Tap the 
Arrow icon to the right of the device and 
you will see the actual name of the device 
next to the Bluetooth tab in the next 
screen, as shown here. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 5:  AirPlay and Bluetooth 
146 
Next, tap your Music app and start any 
song, playlist, podcast, or video music 
library. 
Follow these steps to choose your audio 
output device: 
4. Tap the blue AirPlay icon in the 
lower-right corner of the screen. 
5. Choose from the list of available 
devices for streaming your music. 
6. To switch the music back to your 
iPod touch, just tap the AirPlay icon 
again and choose iPod touch from 
the list. 
 
 
 
NOTE: The AirPlay icon will bring up a list of both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connected audio devices, 
such as Apple TV or AirPort Express connected speakers. You can choose from either one. 
We selected the Jawbone JAMBOX by tapping it. Now, your music will now start to play 
from the selected Bluetooth device. You can verify this by touching the AirPlay icon on 
the screen once more. You should see a Checkmark icon next to the new Stereo 
Bluetooth device, and you should hear your music coming from that sound source, as 
well. 
Disconnecting or Forgetting a Bluetooth Device 
Sometimes, you might want to disconnect a Bluetooth device from your iPod touch. This 
is easy to do. Enter the Bluetooth settings, as you did earlier in this chapter. Next, touch 
the device you want to disconnect to bring up the next screen, tap the Forget this 
Device button, and then confirm your choice. 
This will delete the Bluetooth profile from the iPod touch (see Figure 5‚Äì5). 
NOTE: Bluetooth has a range of only about 30 feet. If you are not near a Bluetooth device, then you 
should turn off Bluetooth. You can always turn it back on when you are actually ready to use it.

Chapter 
Icons and Folders 
Your new iPod touch is very customizable. In this chapter, we will show you how to 
move icons around and put your favorite icons just where you want them. You‚Äôve got 
up to 11 pages of icons to work with, and you can adjust the look and feel of those 
pages so they reflect your tastes. 
Like a Mac computer or an iPad, the iPod touch has a Bottom Dock where you can put 
the icons for your favorite apps. iPod touchs come with four standard icons in the 
Bottom Dock. You can replace the default icons with the icons for your favorite apps, so 
they are always available at the bottom of your screen. You can even move an entire 
folder of apps to the Bottom Dock. 
TIP: You can also move or delete icons using the iTunes app on your computer. Check out 
Chapter 21:‚ÄúiTunes on Your Device‚Äù for more information. 
6 

CHAPTER 6:  Icons and Folders 
150 
Moving Icons to the Bottom Dock 
When you turn your iPod touch on, you‚Äôll notice 
four icons locked to the Bottom Dock. 
Suppose you decide you want to exchange one or 
more of these icons for apps you use more often. 
Fortunately, moving icons to and from the Bottom 
Dock is easy. 
Starting the Move 
Press the Home button to get to your Home screen. Now touch and hold any icon on 
the Home screen for a couple of seconds. You‚Äôll notice that all the icons start to shake. 
Just try moving a couple of icons around at first. You‚Äôll see that when you move an icon 
down, the other icons in the row move to make space for it. 
Once you have a feel for how the icons move, you are ready to replace one of the 
Bottom Dock icons. While the icons are shaking, take the icon you wish to replace from 
the Bottom Dock and move it up to an area covered by other icons. (If you move it to an 
empty area, it will simply jump back to the Bottom Dock). 
NOTE: You can have up to four icons in the Bottom Dock; so if you already have four icons there, 
you will have to remove one to replace it with a new one. 
For example, suppose you wanted to put the Music and Instagram icons on the 
Bottom Dock.  First, you need to clear two open space by dragging off two of the icons 
from the Bottom Dock, as shown in Figure 6-1. 

CHAPTER 6:  Icons and Folders 
151 
   
 
Figure 6‚Äì1. Swapping icons in the Bottom Dock 
Next, locate your Skype icon and move it down to the Bottom Dock. As you‚Äôll see, the 
icon becomes semi-transparent until you actually set it into place. 
When you are sure that you have the icons just where you want them, simply press the 
Home button once and the icons will lock into place. At this point, you have the 
Instagram and Music icon in the Bottom Dock, where you can quickly access them 
anytime. 
Moving Icons to a Different Home Page 
iPod touchs can hold 16 icons on a page (not including the dock). You can navigate 
through these pages by swiping (right to left) on your Home screen. With all the cool 
apps available, it is not uncommon to have five, six, or even more pages of icons. You 
can have up to 11 pages filled with icons, if you feel adventurous! 
NOTE: You can also navigate to new pages by swiping from left to right on any screen except the 
Home screen. On the Home screen, swiping left to right takes you to Spotlight Search; see 
Chapter 2: ‚ÄúTyping, Copy, and Search‚Äù for more information. 
You may have an icon that you rarely use on your first page, so you want to move it way 
off to the last page. Or you may want to move an icon you often use from the last of the 
pages to the first page. Both tasks are very easy to do; indeed, it‚Äôs very much like 
moving icons to the Bottom Dock: 
1. Touch and hold any icon to initiate the moving process.

2. Touch and hold the icon you wish to move. For example, let‚Äôs assume 
you want to move the iBooks icon to the first page (see Figure 6‚Äì2). 
 
Figure 6‚Äì2. Moving icons from one page to another 
3. Now drag and drop the icon onto another page. To do this, touch and 
hold the iBooks icon and drag it to the left. You will see all of your 
pages of icons move by. When you get to the first page, just release the 
icon, and it is now placed at the very beginning. 
4. Press the Home key to complete the move and stop the icons from 
shaking. 
Deleting Icons 
Be careful‚Äîit is as easy to delete an icon as it is to move it. And when you delete an 
icon on the iPod touch, you are actually deleting the program it represents. This means 
you won‚Äôt be able to use the program again without reinstalling or redownloading it. 
Depending on your Application Sync settings in the iTunes app, the program may still 
reside in your Applications folder in iTunes. In that case, you would be able to reinstall 
the deleted app simply by checking that application in the list of apps to sync in iTunes. 
Touch & 
Slide 
Once you get the icon 
to the correct page 
and location, just let 
go, then‚Ä¶ 
‚Ä¶ Then, touch and slide 
the icon you want to 
move to another scr een. 
First, touch and hold any 
icon until you see all 
icons start to shake‚Ä¶ 
‚Ä¶ Press the Home Button to 
complete the move (Stop the 
Icons from shaking). 

CHAPTER 6:  Icons and Folders 
153 
As Figure 6‚Äì3 shows, the process to delete an icon is similar to the process for moving 
it. Touch and hold any icon to initiate the deletion process. Just as before, touching and 
holding makes the icons shake and allows you to move or delete them. 
NOTE: You may delete only programs you have downloaded to your iPod touch; the preinstalled 
icons and their associated programs can‚Äôt be deleted. You can tell which programs can be 
deleted because the icons for apps that can be deleted contain a small black x in the upper-left 
corner. 
Just tap the x on the icon you‚Äôd like to delete. You will be prompted to either Delete the 
icon or Cancel the delete request. If you touch Delete, the icon and its related app will 
be removed from your iPod touch. 
NOTE: If you delete an icon such as a game where your progress has been tracked and saved, 
your progress will be erased when you delete that game.

Resetting All Your Icon Locations (Factory Defaults) 
Occasionally, you might want to go back to the original, factory default icon settings. 
This might be the case when you‚Äôve moved too many new icons to your first page and 
want to see all the basic icons again. 
To do this, touch the Settings icon. Next, 
touch General, finally, scroll all the way to 
the bottom to touch Reset. 
NOTE: Built-in apps will be restored to the same order they were in when Apple shipped the iPod 
touch. 
On the Reset screen, touch Reset Home 
Screen Layout near the bottom. Now all 
your icons will be returned to their original 
settings. 
CAUTION: Be careful you don‚Äôt touch one 
of the other Reset options, as you can 
inadvertently erase your entire iPod touch 
if you touch the wrong button. If you do, 
you‚Äôll have to restore data from your 
iTunes backup. 

CHAPTER 6:  Icons and Folders 
155 
Working with Folders 
Your iPod touch lets you organize your 
apps into folders. When you download 
new apps, they take up a spot on your 
Home page. Once you download many 
apps, it can become hard to find apps and 
keep them organized.  
Using folders will allow you to keep your 
games, your productivity apps, and other 
like-functioning apps together in folders. 
Each folder can hold up to 12 apps‚Äî
which can really help you organize your 
iPod touch! 
 
 
Creating the Folder 
Creating folders is intuitive and fun: 
1. Hold down an app until all the apps start shaking (as you did before in the 
‚ÄúMoving Icons‚Äù section). 
2. Drag an app onto another like-functioning app. For example, drag one 
productivity app onto another similar app. The iPod touch will initially create a 
name for the folder. 
3. In this example, we dragged all three of the Apple productivity apps (Numbers, 
Keynote and Pages) on top of one another, and the iPod touch created a folder 
called "Productivity."  
4. You can edit the folder name by touching the Name field and typing a new name. 
(see Figure 6‚Äì4). 
5. Press the Home button to set the new folder name. 
6. Press the Home button again to return to the Home screen. At this point, you will 
see the new folder with its new name. 

CHAPTER 6:  Icons and Folders 
156 
NOTE: You can place up to 12 app icons in a given folder. If you try to put more than that in a 
folder, you will see the new icon continually being ‚Äúpushed‚Äù out of the folder. This animation 
indicates that the folder is full. 
   
 
Figure 6‚Äì4. Moving icons to create a folder and renaming it. 
Moving Folders 
Just like apps, folders can also be moved from one Home page to another: 
1. Press and hold a folder until the folder and icons on the Home screen start to 
shake. 
2. Touch and hold the folder and drag it to your preferred spot on the screen (or to 
another Home screen), and then let go. 
3. When you have the folder in the spot you desire, just press the Home button to 
complete the move. 
TIP: You can even move a folder down to the Bottom Dock if you like. This is a very handy way of 
having lots of apps right at your fingertips (see Figure 6‚Äì5).

Chapter 
Multitasking 
In this chapter, we will describe how to multitask and jump between apps on your iPod 
touch. Multitasking means you can leave one app running in the background while you 
do something else, such as stream Internet radio, listen to turn-by-turn directions, or 
take Skype calls. 
Fast App Switching 
The Fast App Switcher enables you to leave many of your apps running in the 
background. It also lets you switch from the current app to another without stopping the 
app you‚Äôre currently using. 
You might wonder when it might make sense to use the Fast App Switcher. Here are a 
few scenarios when you might want to consider using multitasking on your iPod touch: 
 Copy and paste from one app (Mail) to another (Calendar). 
 Reply to an iMessage while playing a game, and then jump back into 
that game without missing a beat. 
 Continue listening to Internet radio (such as Pandora or Slacker) while 
checking your email or browsing the Web. 
 Forego waiting for photos to upload to Facebook or Flikr; your photos 
can be running in the background while you go and do other things on 
your iPod touch. 
 Use Skype to call people‚Äînow you can leave it running in the 
background to receive incoming calls (this was not possible before). 
7 

CHAPTER 7:  Multitasking 
160 
Jumping Between Apps 
In order to multitask, you need to bring up the Fast 
App Switcher bar at the bottom of the screen. 
1. From any app or even the Home 
screen, double-click the Home 
button to bring up the Fast App 
Switcher bar at the bottom of your 
screen. 
 
 
 
 
2. All open apps will be shown on the Fast App 
Switcher bar. 
3. Swipe right or left to find the app 
you want and tap it. 
4. If you don‚Äôt see the app you want on 
the Fast App Switcher bar, then 
press the Home button and start it 
from the Home screen. 
5. Double-click the Home button again 
and tap the app you just left to jump 
back to it. 
 
 
Killing Apps from the Fast App Switcher Bar 
Your iPod touch will automatically manage its memory, leaving apps open that are doing 
useful things like streaming music, and putting apps that aren‚Äôt doing anything to 
‚Äúsleep,‚Äù so they don‚Äôt waste memory or processor cycles. Sometimes, however, a rogue 
process can cause an app not to close properly; at other times, you might want to make 
certain a GPS or VoIP app closes early to save battery power. In those cases, you can 
use the Fast App Switcher to manually kill apps. 
Built-in apps like Mail and Messages will immediately restart, so you don‚Äôt miss any 
important messages. Apps and games from the App Store will stay closed until the next 
time you tap their icons to launch them. Follow these steps to kill an app from the Fast 
App Switcher bar: 

CHAPTER 7:  Multitasking 
161 
1. Double-click the Home button to 
bring up the Fast App Switcher bar. 
2. Press and hold any icon in the Fast 
App Switcher bar until they all 
shake. You will notice that a red 
Circle icon with a minus sign 
appears in the upper-left corner of 
each app icon. 
3. Tap a red Circle icon 
 to 
completely close the app. 
4. Keep tapping the red Circle icons to 
close as many apps as you want. 
 
Media Controls and the Screen Portrait Orientation Lock 
Swiping from left to right on the Fast App Switcher bar will bring up the media controls 
and the Portrait Orientation Lock icon. Follow these steps to access these controls 
and use the Portrait Orientation Lock feature: 
1. From any app or even the Home screen, 
double-tap the Home button to bring up the 
Fast App Switcher bar at the bottom of 
your screen.  
2. Swipe left to right to see the media controls 
and the Portrait Orientation Lock icon. 
3. Tap the Portrait Orientation Lock icon to 
lock the screen in Portrait (i.e., vertical) 
orientation. Your iPod touch will maintain 
this orientation even if you turn it on its side. 
You know the iPod touch is locked when 
you see a Lock icon inside the button and 
another Lock icon in the top status bar.  
 
4. The name of the currently playing media is 
listed at the bottom of the screen. 
 

CHAPTER 7:  Multitasking 
162 
5. You can also use the Previous Track, 
Play/Pause, and Next Track buttons in the 
middle. If you hold down Previous Track or 
Next Track button, it becomes the Rewind 
or Fast Forward button, respectively. 
6. Or, you can tap the App icon to jump to the 
last app that was playing music on your iPod 
touch. 
Volume Controls and AirPlay 
If you keep swiping as far left as possible on Fast App Switcher bar, you‚Äôll find the 
volume controls and the AirPlay button. Follow these steps to manipulate these 
controls: 
1. From any app or even the Home 
screen, double-tap the Home button 
to bring up the Fast App Switcher 
at the bottom of your screen. 
2. Swipe left to right, past the media 
controls, until you get to the volume 
controls and the AirPlay button. 
3. Tap the AirPlay button to beam your 
iPod touch audio to AirPlay 
compatible speakers, your video to 
Apple TV, or to mirror your apps on 
the Apple TV. 
4. Slide the Volume control left to 
reduce the volume; slide it to the 
right to increase it.

Chapter 
Personalize and Secure  
In this chapter, you will learn several easy ways to personalize your iPod touch. You will 
also learn how to protect your iPod touch with passcode security. We‚Äôll show you where 
you can download free wallpaper to change the look of your Lock and Home screens. 
We‚Äôll also show you how to personalize the sounds your iPod touch makes by adjusting 
when and what sound you hear for various activities. Many aspects of the iPod touch 
can be fine-tuned to meet your needs and tastes, so you can give your iPod touch a 
more personal look and feel. 
Changing Your Lock Screen and Home Screen 
Wallpapers 
There are actually two screens you can personalize on your iPod touch by changing the 
wallpaper. 
The Lock screen appears when you first turn on your iPod touch or wake it up. The 
wallpaper for this screen image is shown behind the Slide to Unlock slider bar. 
The Home screen features all of your icons. You can see the wallpaper behind the 
icons. You can use the wallpaper pictures that come with the iPod touch, or you can use 
your own images. 
TIP: You may want the wallpaper for your Lock screen to be less personal than your Home 
screen wallpaper. For example, you might choose to put a generic landscape image on your 
Lock screen and a picture of a loved one on your Home screen. Also, you might want to choose 
a Home screen wallpaper that is less busy, so it does not clash with the icons.

Using Any Photo As Wallpaper 
The second way to change your wallpaper is to view any picture in your Photos 
collection and select it as your wallpaper. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Tap the Photos icon to get started. To learn more about working with photos, 
check out Chapter 19: ‚ÄúWorking with Photos.‚Äù 
2. Touch the photo album you want to look through to find your wallpaper.  
3. When you find a photo you want to use, touch it and it will open on your screen. 
4. The thumbnail you tap will fill the screen. If this is the image you want to use, tap 
the Set as icon 
 on the lower-left corner of the screen.  
 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
167 
5. Tap Use As Wallpaper 
6. To move, scale, and set an image 
as your Home or Lock screen 
wallpaper, follow Steps 7-9 from 
the previous section. If you decide 
you‚Äôd rather use a different 
picture, choose Cancel and pick a 
different one. 
 
Downloading Great Wallpaper from Free Apps 
Go to the App Store and do a search for ‚Äúbackgrounds‚Äù or ‚Äúwallpapers‚Äù (see Chapter 
22: ‚ÄúThe Amazing App Store‚Äù for more information on this). You‚Äôll find a number of free 
and low-cost apps designed specifically for your iPod touch. In this section, we will 
highlight one app of many in this genre called Pimp Your Screen from Apalon. This app 
has hundreds of beautiful background images you can download for your iPod touch 
and was currently just $0.99 as of publishing time. 
NOTE: With Pimp Your Screen, as with most wallpaper apps, you will need a live Internet 
connection. 
Using the Wallpaper App 
After you install Pimp Your Screen, you‚Äôre ready to get started: 
1. Tap the Pimp Your Screen icon to start the app. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
168 
2. The app's home screen has a number of categories to choose from: App Shelves 
(shelves to hold your apps - sort of like iBooks or Newsstand), Neon Combos 
(neon backgrounds), Home Screens (nice looking home screens), Icon Skins 
(create backgrounds to highlight your icons).  Then you can create your own 
personalized Lock and Home screen using the bottom two options; Lock Screen 
Maker and Home Screen Maker as shown in Figure 8‚Äì2.  
  
 
Figure 8‚Äì2. Using the Pimp Your Screen app.  
3. After touching any category, you can swipe left or right to view more wallpaper 
image options. To save the wallpaper in your Camera Roll album, the Save 
button in the middle of the bottom of the image.  
4. If you don‚Äôt like the image, click the Home button in the lower-left corner to get 
back to the Home screen menu. 
Using Your Newly Saved Wallpaper 
Once you‚Äôve chosen a wallpaper image and saved it to your iPod touch, you need to 
select it using the steps described in the ‚ÄúChanging Wallpaper from Your Settings App‚Äù 
section earlier in this chapter. 
Remember that the downloaded wallpaper will be in the Camera Roll album. After you 
tap Camera Roll to open it, you‚Äôll need to flick all the way to the bottom to see your 
recent entries. 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure

Adjusting Sounds on Your iPod touch 
You can fine-tune your iPod touch so that it does or does not make sounds when 
certain events happen, such as an incoming message, a new email,  calendar alert -- 
even the ringtone for a FaceTime call! You can also customize what happens when you 
send mail or type on the keyboard. 
Follow these steps to adjust the sounds played on your iPod touch: 
1. Tap your Settings icon. 
2. Tap Sounds. 
3. To adjust the volume of the 
ringtone and other alerts, move the 
slider bar just below Ringer and 
Alerts. 
4. To change your iPod touch‚Äôs 
ringtone or text tone; the sound 
played when you receive a new 
mail, tweet, calendar alert, or 
reminder alert; or the sound played 
when a sent mail completes‚Äîtap 
the item you wish to change. 
 
  

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
170 
5. This screen lets you select a new 
ringtone. Tap any ringtone to play 
it and select it. (You can tell 
whether a ringtone is selected by 
the checkmark next to its name. 
Bell Tower is selected in the 
image to the right.) 
6. If none of the tones available 
appeal to you, you can click Buy 
More Tones and be taken to the 
iTunes Tones Store, where you 
can purchase some of your 
favorite songs as tones. 
7. When you are done, tap the 
Sounds button in the upper-left 
corner. 
8. Use the same steps to change the 
sound you hear for a text tone, 
new mail, tweet, and so on. 
 
 
9. In all sound categories except 
Ringtone, you can turn off the 
sound played by selecting the 
None entry at the top of the list. 
 
10. Lock Sounds and Keyboard 
Clicks can be adjusted by tapping 
the switches to set them to ON or 
OFF. When done, press the Home 
button to exit. 
 
TIP: On a related note, you can lock the maximum volume playable from the Music app. Do so 
by going into Settings > Music > Volume Limit > Lock Volume Limit. We show you how to do 
this in Chapter 11: ‚ÄúPlaying Music.‚Äù 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
171 
Keyboard Options 
You can fine-tune your keyboard by selecting various languages and changing settings 
like Auto-Correction and Auto-Capitalization. You can even have your iPod touch 
speak the auto-correction suggestions to you as you type. See Chapter 2: ‚ÄúTyping, 
Copy and Search‚Äù for a description of the various keyboard options and how to use 
them. 
Securing Your iPod touch with a Passcode 
Your iPod touch can hold a great deal of valuable information. This is especially true if 
you use it to save information like the Social Security numbers and birth dates of your 
family members. It‚Äôs a good idea to make sure that anyone who picks up your iPod 
touch can‚Äôt access all that information. Also, if your children are like ours, they‚Äôll 
probably pick up your cool iPod touch and start surfing the Web or playing a game. You 
might want to enable some security restrictions to keep them safe. 
Setting a Simple Four-Digit Passcode 
On your iPod touch, you have the option of setting a four-digit passcode that prevents 
unauthorized access to your iPod touch and your information. If the wrong passcode is 
entered, however, even you won‚Äôt be able to access your information, so it is a good 
idea to use a code you‚Äôll remember easily. 
Follow these steps to set a passcode to lock your iPod touch: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap General. 
3. Scroll down and tap Passcode 
Lock. 
4. Tap Turn Passcode On to set a 
passcode. 
 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
172 
5. The default passcode is a simple 
four-digit passcode. Use the 
keyboard to enter a four-digit code. 
You will then be prompted to enter 
your code once more. 
 
 
Setting a More Complex Password 
If you prefer to have a password that is 
more complicated than just four digits, you 
can do so by setting the Simple 
Passcode option on the Passcode Lock 
screen to OFF. 
You will then be able to enter a new 
passcode with letters, numbers, and even 
symbols. 
CAUTION: Be careful! If you forget your 
passcode, you cannot unlock your iPod 
touch. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
173 
Adjusting Your Passcode Options 
Once you have set your passcode, you will 
be presented with a few options: 
 Turn Passcode Off 
 Change Passcode 
 Require Passcode (Immediately, 
After 1 Minute, After 5 Minutes, 
After 15 Minutes, After 1 Hour) 
 Simple Passcode (ON = four 
digits; OFF = any letters, numbers, 
or symbols) 
 Erase Data (ON = erase all data 
after ten incorrect password 
attempts; OFF = do not erase 
data) 
CAUTION: You may want to set Erase 
Data to OFF if you have young children 
who like to bang away at the security to 
unlock the keyboard when it comes out of 
Sleep mode. Otherwise, you may end up 
with your iPod touch being erased 
frequently. 
 
   
 
 
NOTE: Setting a shorter time for 
Require Passcode is more secure. 
Setting the time as Immediately‚Äî
the default‚Äîis most secure. 
However, using the setting of 1 
Minute may save you the headache 
of retyping your passcode if you 
accidentally lock your iPod touch.
Setting Restrictions 
You might decide you don‚Äôt want your kids listening to explicit lyrics in the music on 
your iPod touch. You may also want to block them from visiting YouTube or any other 
web site. Setting such restrictions is quite easy on your iPod touch. 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
174 
Restricting Apps 
Follow these steps to restrict access to content on 
your iPod touch: 
1. Tap General in your Settings app. 
2. Scroll down the page and tap 
Restrictions. 
3. Tap the Enable Restrictions button. 
 
 
4. You will now be prompted to enter a 
Restrictions Passcode‚Äîjust pick a 
four-digit code you will remember. 
NOTE: This Restrictions Passcode is a separate 
passcode from your main iPod touch passcode. You 
can certainly set it to be the same, which will make it 
easier to remember. However, this could be 
problematic if you let your family know the main 
passcode, but do not want them adjusting the 
restrictions. You will need to enter this Restrictions 
Passcode to turn off restrictions later. 
 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
175 
Notice that you can adjust whether to allow certain 
apps or actions to function. For example, the screen 
shot to the right lets you adjust restrictions for the 
following apps: Safari, YouTube, Camera, FaceTime, 
iTunes, and Ping. This screen also lets you restrict 
access to Installing Apps or Deleting Apps. Finally, 
you can restrict the ability to make changes to 
Location and Accounts. 
In all cases, OFF = restricted. 
You might think that ON means something is 
restricted, but it is the opposite. In order to disable or 
restrict something, you need to touch the slider next 
to it and change it to OFF. If you notice the word 
Allow above all the options, then it makes sense. 
NOTE: The icons for any apps you restrict will 
disappear. So if you were to restrict access to 
YouTube, the App Store, and the FaceTime apps; 
then the YouTube and App Store icons would 
disappear from the Home screen, and your iPod 
touch‚Äôs FaceTime icon would also be removed. 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
176 
Allowing Changes 
Sometimes you don‚Äôt want to turn off access to an app 
completely, but simply stop anyone from making 
unintended changes. For example, the Location option 
comes with a lot of privacy concerns, so you may want 
to exercise more granular control over which apps and 
functions have access to it. Follow these steps to 
adjust restrictions for the Location option: 
1. Go to the Restrictions screen, as described 
in the previous section. 
2. Scroll down to the bottom to see all of the 
Allow Changes settings. 
3. Tap Location. 
4. Tap Allow Changes to make changes to 
Location Settings.  
5. Toggle Location Services to OFF to 
completely prevent your iPod touch from 
using your location. (Note that this may 
greatly reduce the convenience of apps like 
Google Maps and prevent turn-by-turn 
navigation apps from working at all.) 
6. Toggle to OFF any individual apps that you 
don‚Äôt want tracking your location. (For 
example, set Location Services for your 
Camera app to OFF to prevent GPS 
coordinates from being included on pictures 
you intend to share publicly on the Internet.) 
7. Tap System Services to change the Location 
permissions for built-in processes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
177 
8. If there are any system services that you don‚Äôt 
want to use location data, then toggle them to 
OFF. Options include Cell Network Search, 
Compass Calibration, Diagnostics & 
Usage, Location-Based iAds, Setting Time 
Zone, and Traffic. 
9. Tap Location at the top left to go back when 
you‚Äôre done. 
10. If you want to prevent any future changes to 
Location Services, tap Don‚Äôt Allow 
Changes. 
11. Tap Restrictions to go back when you‚Äôre 
done. 
12. Tap Accounts and tap Don‚Äôt Allow Changes 
to prevent any future changes to your Mail, 
Calendar, and Contact accounts. 
13. Tap Restrictions to go back when you‚Äôre 
done. 
 

CHAPTER 8:  Personalize and Secure 
178 
Restricting Content 
In addition to setting restrictions for apps, you can set restrictions for content that can 
be downloaded and viewed on your iPod touch. Follow these steps if you might give 
your iPod touch to a child, and you don‚Äôt want her to have the ability to download music 
with explicit lyrics or watch movies with adult content: 
1. Go to the Restrictions screen, as 
described in the previous section.  
2. Scroll down to the bottom to see all of 
the Allowed Content settings. 
3. To restrict content purchased while 
inside an app, set In-App Purchases to

Chapter 
Using iMessage 
iMessage is Apple‚Äôs new service that does exactly the same thing as 
SMS and MMS on phones, but works over Wi-Fi networks and only 
with other iOS 5 devices (like iPod touches, iPhones and iPads). 
iMessage  can be found in your iPod touch‚Äôs Messages app. In this 
chapter, you will learn how to use iMessage to send a text message 
from your Contacts app and a picture message from your Photos 
app. 
Enabling iMessage and Adjusting Settings 
Setting up the iMessage service is similar to setting up FaceTime: 
9 

CHAPTER 9:  Using iMessage 
182 
1. Launch Settings. 
2. Tap Messages. 
3. Toggle iMessages to ON 
4. Then you may be asked for your 
iMessage password‚Äîthis is simply 
your Apple iTunes password. 
TIP: If you get stuck in the Waiting for 
activation message as shown here, then 
try re-booting your device as shown in 
Chapter 25: Troubleshooting
Once you‚Äôve enabled the iMessages 
option, your email address will be 
registered with the iMessage service. 
 
 
If you tap the Receive At near the bottom 
of the iMessage settings screen, you will 
see a screen similar to this one. 
 
On this screen, you can adjust which email 
address is associated with your iMessage 
and add new email addresses. 
 
Composing Messages 
Composing a iMessage is much like sending an e-mail or SMS text message on a 
phone. The beauty of an iMessage is that it arrives on any iOS 5 device, and it is quite 
simple to reply to. 

CHAPTER 9:  Using iMessage 
183 
Composing a Message from the Messages App 
There are a couple of ways to start your Messages app. The easiest is to just 
tap the Messages icon on the Home screen.

When you first start the Messages app, you most likely won‚Äôt have any messages, so 
the screen will be blank. Once you get started with iMessaging, you will have a list of 
messages and current ‚Äúopen‚Äù discussions with your contacts. Follow these steps to 
send a message: 
 
1. Touch the Compose icon in the top-right 
corner of the screen. 
2. The cursor will immediately go to the To: 
line. You can start typing the name of your 
contact, or you can just touch the Plus (+) 
button and search or scroll through your 
contacts. 
3.  
                  
4. When you find the contact you wish to use, touch the person‚Äôs name and it will 
appear in the To: line 
5. When you are ready to type the message, 
touch anywhere in the box in the middle of 
the screen (next to the Send button). 
6. The keyboard will be displayed. Just type 
in your message and touch Send when 
you are done. 
NOTE: A character counter will appear if you have 
enabled it in Settings > Messages. 
 

CHAPTER 9:  Using iMessage 
184 
TIP: If you prefer, you can use the larger landscape keyboard for sending messages. It can be 
easier to type with the larger keys, especially when your fingers are a little larger or it is hard to 
see the smaller keys. 
Options After Sending a Message 
Once you send the message, the window changes 
to a threaded discussion window between you and 
your contact. The message that you sent appears 
in a blue bubble. When your contact replies, his 
message will appear on the opposite side of the 
screen in a gray bubble. 
To leave the Compose screen, tap Messages in 
the upper-left corner or click the Home button to 
go back to your Home screen. 
NOTE: If the message fails to send, you‚Äôll see an 
exclamation mark beside it. You‚Äôll also see a Red 
Exclamation Point icon in the upper-right corner of 
the icon for the Messages app. 
If this happens, you can send 
another message, just as you did 
before. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 9:  Using iMessage 
185 
Composing a Message from Contacts 
You also have the ability to start the message to any contact in your iPod touch. Follow 
these steps to do so: 
1.
Find the contact you wish to message by 
searching or scrolling through Contacts. 
2.
At the very bottom of the contact info, you 
will see a box that says Send Message. Just 
touch that box and you will be prompted to 
choose which number or email address to 
use (if you have more than one number or 
email address listed for the contact). 
3.
Choose the preferred number or email 
address and follow the steps listed 
previously. 
NOTE: Remember that you can only send iMessages to anemail address associated with an 
Apple ID being used with an iOS 5 device. 
Replying to a Message 
When a message is received, your iPod touch will play 
an indicator tone, vibrate, or both‚Äîdepending on your 
settings. Also, an indicator will appear in Notification 
Center at the top of the screen, giving you the option 
of replying right away. 
When you see and/or hear the indicator, just tap the 
notification to go to the Messages app and type your 
response, as shown previously. 
If you miss the notification or want to reply later, just 
pull down the Notification Center list from the top, 
and then tap the message you want to reply to. 

CHAPTER 9:  Using iMessage 
186 
NOTE: If your screen is locked, you will see the 
message as either a popup or as part of the Lock 
screen list. Just slide the Messages icon to unlock and 
you‚Äôll be taken to the message. 
 
 
Viewing Stored Messages 
Once you begin a few threaded messages, they 
will be stored in the Messages app. Touch the 
Messages icon and you can scroll through your 
message threads.  
To continue a conversation with someone, just 
touch the desired thread and it will open up, 
showing you the back and forth of all past 
messages. Touch the text box, type in your 
message, and then touch the Send button to 
continue the conversation. 

CHAPTER 9:  Using iMessage

Message Tone and Sound Options 
Your iPod touch lets you dictate how it will react when a message comes in. Follow 
these steps to choose your preferred reaction: 
1. Start your Settings app, scroll to Sounds, and 
tap the Sounds tab. 
2. If you have the Vibrate feature set to ON in the 
Sounds menu, you will also receive a vibration 
when a message comes in. 
3. Scroll down a bit further and you will see a tab 
that says Text Tone. Tap this and you can 
choose the tone for the SMS message. You are 
limited to the choices offered (usually six), or you 
can choose None. 
4. Choose your preferred sound for an SMS 
message 
notification and then touch the Sounds 
 
button in the top-left corner to set your  
selection. 

CHAPTER 9:  Using iMessage 
188 
Multimedia iMessaging  
The Messages app gives iPod touch users the tools required to send and receive MMS-
like messages‚Äîincluding picture messages and video messages.. These messages 
appear right in the messaging window, just like your text iMessages. 
NOTE: You can send image, video, location (from maps), audio (from the Voice Memo app), and 
vCard (from the Contacts app) files from the Messages app.

the blue Send button. 
If you already have a threaded discussion with 
that particular contact, then his picture will show 
up in the midst of that threaded discussion. 
NOTE: You can continue to exchange images 
and text in the midst of a threaded discussion. 
And you can always scroll through to see the 
entire discussion‚Äîpictures and all! 

CHAPTER 9:  Using iMessage 
191 
Choosing a Picture or Video from Photos to Send via 
Messages 
The second way to send a picture or video message is to just go straight to your Photos 
app and choose a picture. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Start your Photos app and navigate 
through your pictures and videos as 
described in Chapter 19: ‚ÄúWorking with 
Photos.‚Äù 
2. To send just one picture or video, touch 
the picture or video you wish to send 
and then touch the Send icon in the 
lower-left corner. 
 
3. You will now see Message as the second option. Choose Message and the 
photo will load into the bubble, just as it did previously in the Messages app.

                    Chapter 
Video Messaging and 
Skype 
Your iPod touch brings many new capabilities to your life, some of which seemed like 
science fiction just a few years ago. For example, video calling is now not only possible, 
but extremely easy to use with the new FaceTime feature. As long as you and your 
caller are on an iPod touch and you‚Äôre both on a Wi-Fi network, you can have unlimited 
video calls. In this chapter, we will show you how to enable and use FaceTime, as well 
as how to start having fun with this great new feature. 
Making calls over Wi-Fi is also possible with Skype, the popular video calling and chat 
program that many of us use on our computers. We will also show you how to use the 
Skype app. 
Speaking of video, your iPod touch is a very capable video recorder. You can record 
and export HD video up to 720p. You can then publish that video straight to YouTube or 
iCloud, or even send it to an email recipient. We will also show you how to shoot and 
quickly ‚Äútrim‚Äù your videos, as well as upload them. 
Video Calling 
For many years, we have watched TV episodes and movies debut future technology like 
this. For example, many of these episodes and movies show people talking on small, 
portable phones and having video conversations. Even The Jetsons cartoon in the 
1970s had this as a future concept. 
The iPod touch makes that future thinking a reality today. There are a few apps that 
enable you to make video calls on your iPod touch using the front-facing camera. At this 
time, only one app allows you to use both the front-facing camera and the rear camera: 
FaceTime. 
10 

CHAPTER 10:  Video Messaging and Skype 
194 
Connecting to a Bluetooth Headset or Car Stereo 
You can also connect to a Bluetooth headset or Bluetooth car stereo system to place 
and receive the audio of FaceTime or other calling services such as Skype. We show 
you the detailed steps in Chapter 5: ‚ÄúAirPlay and Bluetooth.‚Äù 
Video Calling with FaceTime 
FaceTime is the proprietary app highlighted in many Apple commercials for the iPod 
touch. Essentially, FaceTime is free-over-Wi-Fi calling that allows you to see the caller 
on the other end of the conversation through the iPod touch‚Äôs front-facing camera. 
NOTE: For now FaceTime is only available for video calls between recent iOS devices like the 
iPod touch 4, iPod touch 4S, iPad 2, and iPod touch 4 as well as Mac computers.  
Enabling FaceTime Calling and Adding Emails 
When you first use your device, FaceTime may not yet be enabled. To enable the iPod 
touch to receive and make FaceTime calls, follow these steps: 
1. Start your Settings app.  
2. Tap FaceTime. 
3. Toggle the FaceTime switch to the ON 
position. 
 
You may be asked to sign in with your Apple 
ID.  
Your default email address associated with 
your Apple ID will also be the email address 
that people can call you on using FaceTime 
from their other iOS devices. 
 

CHAPTER 10:  Video Messaging and Skype 
195 
You can also add a new email address to be 
used with FaceTime by tapping Add Another 
Email.  Type your new email address then 
you will receive a verification email from 
Apple asking you to click a link to associate 
the new email address with FaceTime (and 
your Apple ID) before you can use this email 
with FaceTime. 
Once the new email address is verified, you 
will see the tag change from Verifying to 
Email. 
Caller ID 
Once you add a new email address, a Caller 
ID tab will appear below the email addresses 
on this same screen.  Tap Caller ID to 
choose which email address to show people 
when you call them with FaceTime. 

CHAPTER 10:  Video Messaging and Skype 
196 
Different FaceTime Views 
Along the bottom of the FaceTime app, you will see three icons along the bottom of your 
FaceTime screen for Favorites, Recents, Contacts as shown in Figure 10‚Äì1. 
 
Figure 10‚Äì1. Use soft keys to see different FaceTime screens (Favorites, Recents and Contacts) 
Using Favorites 
Your Favorites are people you call with FaceTime frequently. You can think of 
Favorites as your speed dial list. 
Adding New Favorites 
It is easy to add new favorites to your list from your Contacts list. Follow these steps to 
do so: 
TIP: You can also add a Favorite from your Recents screen in FaceTime. In Recents, tap the 
blue Arrow icon 
 and, on the next screen, scroll to the bottom of the Info page and tap 
Add to Favorites. 
4. Tap the FaceTime icon to start it up. 
5. Touch the Favorites icon in the bottom row of soft keys.

7. Tap the Plus button 
 in the 
upper-right corner to add a new 
entry. Your contact directory will 
open. 
 
8. Swipe up or down to locate a 
contact. Tap any contact to select it. 
TIP: To search for your contacts by name, 
tap the very top of the screen just under 
the time. This will bring up the Search 
window, where you can type a few letters 
to find people. Remember that you can 
view different contact groups by tapping 
the Groups button in the upper-left 
corner. 
 
 

CHAPTER 10:  Video Messaging and Skype 
198 
9. If an entry has more than one phone 
number or email address, you will 
need to select one of them as your 
favorite entry. 
10. After tapping an email address or 
phone number for the contact, You 
are returned to your list of 
Favorites, where you‚Äôll see the new 
person you just added.  
 
 
Organizing Your Favorites 
As with other lists on your iPod touch, you can re-order your Favorites list and remove 
entries. 
1. View your Favorites list as you did 
previously. 
2. Tap the Edit button in the upper-

4. To delete an entry, tap the red 
Circle icon to the left of the entry to 
make it turn vertical. 
5. Tap the Delete button. 
6. When you are done re-ordering and 
deleting entries, tap the Done 
button in the upper-left corner. 
 
Using Recents  
Using your Recents is similar to looking at your call log on your mobile 
phone. 
When you touch the Recents icon, a list of all your recent FaceTime 
calls will be displayed. You can touch the All or Missed button at the 
top to narrow down the list (see Figure 10‚Äì2).

screen: Create New Contact and Add to Existing 
Contact. 
Tap Create New Contact to create a new contact 
from this phone number. 
Tap Add to Existing Contact to add this phone 
number to one of your existing contacts. 
Placing Calls from Contacts 
One of the great things about having all your contact information in your iPod touch is

Making Phone Calls and More with Skype 
Social networking is all about keeping in 
touch with our friends, colleagues, and 
family. Passive communication through sites 
such as www.facebook.com and Google+ is 
nice, but sometimes there is just no 
substitute for hearing someone‚Äôs voice.

Amazingly, you can make phone and video calls 
using the Skype app from any iPod touch. Calls to 
other Skype users anywhere in the world are free. 
A nice thing about the Skype service is that it 
works on computers and many mobile devices, 
including the iPod touch 4S, older iPod touchs, 
iPads and iPod touches, some BlackBerry 
smartphones, and other mobile devices. You will 
be charged for calls to mobile phones and land 
lines, but the rates are reasonable. 
NOTE: The Skype app can run in the background, 
so you can answer incoming Skype calls at any 
time (note that this usually leads to faster battery 
drain). 
Downloading Skype to Your iPod touch

you can have Skype running in the background and still be able to receive a Skype call 
when it comes in. You can even, in theory, be on a voice call and then answer your 
Skype call! 
TIP: If you don‚Äôt want to leave Skype running in the background, but still want to call someone 
whom you know uses Skype on her iPod touch, just send her a quick email or give her a quick 
call to alert her to the fact you would like to talk to her using the Skype app. 
Buying Skype Credits or a Monthly Subscription 
Skype-to-Skype calls are free. However, if you want to call people on their land lines or 
mobile phones from the Skype app, then you will need to purchase Skype Credits or 
purchase a monthly subscription plan. If you try to purchase the credits or subscription 
from within the Skype app, it will take you to the Skype web site. For this reason, we 
recommend using Safari on your iPod touch or using your computer‚Äôs web browser to 
purchase these credits. 
TIP: You may want to start with a limited amount of Skype Credits to try out the service before 
you sign up for a subscription plan. Subscription plans are the way to go if you plan on using 
Skype a lot for non-Skype callers (e.g., regular landlines and mobile phones). 
Follow these steps to use Safari to buy Skype Credits: 
1. Tap the Safari icon. 
2. Type www.skype.com in the top address bar and tap Go. 
3. Tap the Sign In link at the top of the page. 
4. Enter your Skype Name and Password, and then tap Sign me in.

5. If you are not already on your Account screen, tap the Account tab in 
the right end of the Top Nav Bar. 
6. At this point, you can choose to buy credits or a subscription: 
d. Tap the Buy pre-pay credit button to purchase a fixed amount of 
credits. 
e. Tap the Get a subscription button to buy a monthly subscription 
account. 
7. Finally, complete the payment instructions for either type of purchase. 
Chatting with Skype 
In addition to making phone calls, you can also chat via text with other Skype users 
from your iPod touch. Starting a chat is very similar to starting a call; follow these steps 
to do so: 
1. If you are not already in Skype, tap the Skype icon. 
2. Tap the Contacts soft key 
at the bottom. 
3. Tap All Contacts to see 
all your contacts. 
4. Tap the name of the 
contact you wish to chat 
with. 
5. Tap the Chat button. 
 
 

CHAPTER 10:  Video Messaging and Skype 
211 
6. Type your chat text and press the 
Send button. Your chat will appear 
in the top of the screen. 
 
 
Adding Skype to Your Computer 
You can use the Skype app on your computer, as well. We will show you how this works 
next. You can also use Skype to make video calls on your computer if you also have a 
web cam hooked up. 
NOTE: When you call from your computer to an iPod touch, you will not be able to do a video call. 
To create a Skype account and download Skype software for your computer, follow 
these steps: 
1. Open a web browser on your computer. 
2. Go to: www.skype.com. 
3. Click the Join link at the top of the page. 
4. Create your account by completing all required information and clicking 
the Continue button. Notice that you only have to enter information in 
the required fields, which are denoted with an asterisk. For example, 
you do not need to enter your gender, birthdate, or mobile phone 
number. 
5. You are now done with the account setup process. Next, you are 
presented with the option of buying Skype Credits; however, this is not 
required for the free Skype-to-Skype phone calls, video calls, or chats. 
TIP: You only need to pay for Skype if you want to call someone who is not using Skype. For 
example, calls to phones on land lines or mobile phones (not using Skype) will cost you. At the 
time of writing, pay-as-you-go rates were about US 2.1 cents; monthly subscriptions ranged 
from about US $3 - $14 for various calling plans. 

CHAPTER 10:  Video Messaging and Skype 
212 
6. Next, click the Get Skype link in the Top Nav Bar of the site to download 
Skype to your computer. 
7. Click the Get Skype for Windows button or the Get Skype for Mac 
button. 
8. Follow the instructions to install the software.  
9. Once the software is installed, launch it and log in using your Skype 
account. 
10. You are ready to initiate (or receive) phone calls, video calls, and chats 
to anyone else using Skype, including all your friends with Skype on 
their iPod touchs. 
Video Recording  
In addition to letting you make video calls and chat, the iPod touch lets you make full-
featured videos using the built-in video recorder. You can use your iPod touch to shoot 
HD video in 1080p and then upload this video to Facebook, YouTube, or MobileMe. You 
can also send your videos via MMS or email. 
NOTE: When you share a video, it will be compressed, so the quality will no longer be 1080pp. 
Next, we will show you how to record video and trim your video right on your iPod 
touch. You will also learn how to produce a high quality, high definition video right on 
your iPod touch. 
Starting the Video Recorder  
The software for the video recorder is actually part of the Camera app (see Figure 10‚Äì6). 
Follow these steps to use the built-in video recorder: 
1. Start up the Camera app Move the slider in the lower-right corner from the 
Camera icon to the Video Recorder icon. 
2. Tap the Camera Switch button at the top right to alternate between the rear-
facing and front-facing cameras. 
3. Try to keep the iPod touch steady as you record your scene. 
4. Tap the Stop button when you are done recording.

Focusing the Video 
The iPod touch can adjust the focus of the video based on the subject. Follow these 
steps to take advantage of this feature: 
1. To focus on something in the foreground of the video, tap the screen in the 
foreground. This brings up a small box to show the area of focus. 
2. To switch the focus to a subject in the background, tap another part of the 
screen. The box will temporarily display the new area of focus. 
Trimming the Video 
The iPod touch allows you to perform edits on your video right on the iPod touch. Once 
the video has been recorded and you press the Stop button, the video immediately goes 
into your Camera Roll. 
Tap the small image of the video in the lower-left corner to bring up the video. At the top 
of the screen, you will see a timeline with all the frames of your video at the top of the 
screen (see Figure 10‚Äì7). Follow these steps to edit your just-recorded video: 
1. Drag either end of the timeline and you will see that the video goes into Trim 
mode. 
2. Drag the ends of the video on either end until it is the length you desire.

                     Chapter 
Playing Music 
In this chapter we show you how to turn your iPod touch into a terrific music player. 
Since the iPod touch comes from Apple‚Äîwhich popularized the now famous iPod 
electronic music player‚Äîyou'd expect it to have some great capabilities, and it does. 
We'll show you how to play and organize the music you buy from iTunes or sync from 
your computer, how to view playlists in a variety of ways, and how to quickly find songs. 
You'll learn how to use the Genius feature to have the iPod touch locate and group 
similar songs in your library‚Äîsort of like a radio station that plays only music you like. 
TIP: Learn how to buy music and use Ping (social networking for music lovers) right on your iPod 
touch in Chapter 21: ‚ÄúiTunes on Your Device.‚Äù  
And you'll see how to stream music using an app called Pandora. With Pandora, you 
can select from a number of Internet radio stations, or create your own by typing in your 
favorite artist‚Äôs name, and it's all free.  
Your iPod touch as a Music Player 
Your iPod touch is probably one of the best music players on the market today. The 
touch screen makes it easy to interact with and manage your music, playlists, cover art, 
and the organization of your music library. You can even connect your iPod touch to 
your home or car stereo via Bluetooth, so you can listen to beautiful stereo sound from 
your iPod touch! 
TIP: Check out Chapter 5: ‚ÄúAirPlay and Bluetooth‚Äù to learn how to hook up your iPod touch to 
your Bluetooth stereo speakers or car stereo. 
Whether you use the built-in Music app or an Internet radio app like Pandora, you'll find 
you have unprecedented control over your music on the iPod touch.

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
216 
The Music App 
Most music is handled through the Music app‚Äîthe icon is on 
the Home screen, usually in the bottom dock of icons, the last 
one on the right. 
NOTE: For all you readers familiar with the iPod touch before iOS 
5, yes, the music playing app was called the iPod app.  Now is is 
simply the Music app.  
Touch the Music icon and, as Figure 12‚Äì1 shows, you‚Äôll see five soft keys across the 
bottom: 
 Playlists lets you see synced playlists from your computer, as well as 
playlists created on the iPod touch. 
 Artists lets you see an alphabetical list of artists (searchable like your 
Address Book). 
 Songs lets you see an alphabetical list of songs (also searchable). 
 Videos lets you see a   list of videos (also searchable). 
 More lets you see audiobooks, compilations, composers, genres, 
iTunes U, and podcasts. 
Editing the Soft Keys 
One very cool feature on the iPod touch is that you can edit the soft keys at the bottom 
of the Music app and really customize it to fit your needs and tastes. To do so, first 
touch the More button. 
Then touch the Edit button at the top left of the screen. 
 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
217 
The screen changes to 
show the various icons 
that can be dragged 
down to the bottom dock. 
 
 
                                                       Figure 12‚Äì2. Change the soft keys in the Music app.                                      
Let‚Äôs say you want to replace the Albums icon with the one for Audiobooks. Just touch 
and hold the Audiobooks icon and drag it to where the Albums icon is on the bottom 
dock.  When you get there, release the icon and the Audiobooks icon will now reside 
where the Album icon used to be.  You can do this with any of the icons on this 
Configure screen.  When you are finished, touch the  Done  button at the top right of 
the screen. 
TIP: You can also reorder the icons across the bottom by dragging and dropping them back and 
forth along the soft key row. 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
218 
Playlists View  
NOTE: A playlist is a list of songs you 
create and can include any genre, 
artist, year of recording, or collection 
of songs that interest you. 
Many people group together music of a 
particular genre, like classical or rock. 
Others may create playlists with fast beat 
music and call it workout or running 
music. You can use playlists to organize 
your music just about any way you want. 
You can create playlists in iTunes on 
your computer and then sync to your 
iPod touch (see the iTunes Guide), or you 
can create a playlist right on your iPod 
touch as we describe in the next section. 
Once you‚Äôve synced a playlist to your 
iPod touch or created one on your iPod 
touch, it shows up on the left-hand side 
of the Music screen, under Library. 
If you have several playlists listed along 
the left side, just touch the name of the 
one you want to listen to. 
 
NOTE: You can edit the contents of some of 
your playlists on your iPod touch. However, 
you can‚Äôt edit Genius playlists on the iPod 
touch itself.   
Creating Playlists on the iPod touch 
The iPod touch lets you create unique playlists that can be edited and synced with your 
computer. Let‚Äôs say you want to add a new selection of music to your iPod touch 
playlist. Just create the playlist as we show below and add songs. You can change the 
playlist whenever you want, removing old songs and adding new ones‚Äîit couldn‚Äôt be 
easier! 
To create a new playlist on the iPod touch, 
touch the Add Playlist tab under Genius 
Playlist. 
 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
219 
Give your playlist a unique name (we‚Äôll call 
this one ‚ÄúBike-riding music‚Äù), then touch 
Save. 
 
 
Now you'll see the Songs screen. Touch the name of any song you want to add to the 
new playlist.  
You know a song is selected and will be added to the playlist when it turns gray. 
NOTE: Don‚Äôt get frustrated trying to remove or deselect a song you tapped by mistake. You can‚Äôt 
remove or deselect songs on this screen; you have to click Done, then remove them on the next 
screen, as we describe.  
Select Done at the top right and the playlist contents will be displayed.  
Searching for Music 
Almost every view from your Music app 
(Playlists, Artists, Songs, etc.) has a search 
window at the top of the screen.  
If you don‚Äôt see the search window, tap 
the time at the top to instantly make it 
visible. 
Tap once in the search window and type a 
few letters of the name of an artist, album, 
playlist, or song to instantly see a list of all 
matching items. This is the best way to 
quickly find something to listen to or watch 
on your iPod touch. 
 
 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
220 
Changing the View in the Music app 
The Music app is very flexible when it comes to ways of displaying and categorizing 
your music. Sometimes, you might want to look at your songs listed by the artist. At 
other times, you might prefer seeing a particular album or song. The iPod touch lets you 
easily change the view to help manage and play just the music you want at a given 
moment. 
In your Music app, you have the following views: 
 Artists View - shows you a listing of all your music arranged by artist. 
 Songs View - shows all your music listed by name of each song. 
 Albums View - shows all music arranged by album name. 
 Genres View - shows all music arranged by type or genre. 
 Composers View - shows music arranged by composer name. 
 Audiobooks  - shows all your audiobooks. 
 Compilations - shows all compilations. 
 ITunes U - shows all iTunes U content. 
 Podcasts - shows all your podcasts. 
Viewing Songs in an Album 
When you‚Äôre in Albums view, just touch an album cover or name and the screen will 
slide, showing you the songs on that album (see Figure 12‚Äì3).  
TIP: When you start playing an album, the album cover may expand to fill the screen. Tap the 
screen once to bring up (or hide) the controls at the top and bottom. You can use these controls 
to manage the song and screen as we describe below.  
To see the songs on an album that is 
playing, tap the List button and the album 
cover and the cover will turn over, 
revealing all the songs on that album. The 
song that is playing will have a small blue 
arrow next to it.

music by album, touching Next moves you to the next song on the album. Touching the 
Previous Song button does the reverse. 
NOTE: If you‚Äôre at the beginning of a song, Previous takes you to the preceding song. If the song 
is already playing, Previous goes to the beginning of the current song (and a second tap would 
take you to the previous song). 
Adjusting the Volume  
There are two ways to adjust the volume on your 
iPod touch: using the external Volume buttons or 
using the Volume Slider control on the screen.  
The external Volume buttons are on the upper left 
side of the device. Press the Volume Up key (the 
top button) or the Volume Down key to raise or 
lower the volume. You‚Äôll see the Volume Slider 
control move as you adjust the volume. You can 
also just touch and hold the Volume Slider key to 
adjust the volume. 
TIP: To quickly mute the sound, press and hold the 
Volume Down key and the volume eventually 
reduces to zero.

Double-Click the Home Button for Media Controls 
You can play your music while you are doing other things on your iPod touch, like 
reading and responding to e-mail, browsing the Web, or playing a game. With the iPod 
touch‚Äôs new multitasking function, a quick double-tap to the Home button on the 
bottom, followed by a swipe to the right, will bring up the ‚Äúnow playing‚Äù media controls 
in the multitasking window. The controls allow you to skip to the previous song, pause 
or play the current song, skip to the next song, or go directly to the app playing the 
song. 
NOTE: The widgets show whatever app last played audio or video, so if Pandora was last, you‚Äôll 
see that instead of Music, and the widgets will control Pandora instead, same with Videos, 
YouTube, etc. 
TIP: If you hold down the Previous Song control, the song will rewind; if you hold down the Next
Song control, it will fast forward. 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
226 
Repeating, Shuffling, Moving around in a Song 
In play mode, you can activate additional 
controls by tapping the screen anywhere on 
the album cover. You‚Äôll then see an additional 
slider (the scrubber bar) at the top, along with 
the symbols for Repeat, Shuffle, and Genius.

the top controls twice until you see it turn blue and display a 1.
 
To repeat all songs in the playlist, song list, or album, touch the Repeat icon 
until it turns blue (and does not display a 1).
 
To turn off the Repeat feature, press the icon until it turns white again. 
 
Shuffle  
If you are listening to a playlist or album or any other category or list of music, 
you might decide you don‚Äôt want to listen to the songs in order. You can touch 
the Shuffle symbol so the music will play in random order. You know Shuffle 
is turned on when the icon is blue, and off when it is white.
 
Shake to Shuffle 
The Shake to Shuffle feature was 
introduced in the last iPod touch.  So, to 
turn on Shuffle mode, all you have to do to 
change songs is simply give your iPod 
touch a shake, then shake it again.  Every 
time you shake your iPod touch, you'll skip 
to the next randomly selected song in the 
list. 

TIP: If you plan on dancing while holding 
your iPod touch, turn off Shake to 
Shuffle!

1. Tap the Settings icon.  
2. Scroll down and touch the Music icon.   
3.  Move the Shake to Shuffle switch to ON or OFF. 
Now Playing 
Sometimes you‚Äôre having so much fun exploring your 
options for playlists or albums that you get deeply buried in 
a menu‚Äîthen find yourself just wanting to get back to the 
song you‚Äôre listening to. Fortunately, this is always very easy 
to do‚Äîyou can just touch the Now Playing icon at the top 
right of most of the music screens. 
Viewing Other Songs on the Album 
You may decide you want to listen to another song from the same album rather than 
going to the next song in the playlist or genre list. 
In the upper-right corner of the Now Playing screen, you‚Äôll see a small 
button with three lines on it. 
 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
229 
Tap that button and the view switches 
to a small image of the album cover. 
The screen now displays all the songs 
on that album. 
Touch another song on the list and that 
song will begin to play.  
NOTE: If you were in the middle of a 
playlist or a Genius Playlist and you jump 
to another song from an album, you won‚Äôt 
be taken back to that playlist. To return to 
that playlist, you‚Äôll need to either go back 
to your playlist library or tap Genius to 
make a new Genius Playlist.
Adjusting Music Settings  
There are several settings you can adjust to 
tweak music-playing on your iPod touch. You‚Äôll 
find these in the Settings menu. Just tap the 
Settings icon on your Home screen. 
In the middle of the Settings screen, touch the 
Music tab to go to the settings screen for 
Music. You'll find six settings you can adjust 
on this screen: Shake to Shuffle, Sound 
Check, EQ, Volume Limit, Lyrics & Podcast 
Info and Groupe By Album Artist. 
You'll also find the login area for Home 
Sharing, which lets you stream music from 
iTunes on your Windows or Mac PC.
Tap album icon 
to switch back 
to album cover. 
Touch any other 
song to start 
playing it. 
Blue triangle 
shows currently 
playing song. 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
230 
Using Sound Check (Auto Volume Adjust) 
Because songs are recorded at different 
volumes, sometimes during playback a 
particular song may sound quite loud 
compared to another. Sound Check can 
eliminate this. If Sound Check is set to 
ON, all your songs will play at roughly 
the same volume.
 
EQ (Sound Equalizer Setting) 
Sound equalization is very personal and subjective. 
Some people like to hear more bass in their music, 
some like more treble, and some like more of an 
exaggerated mid-range. Whatever your music tastes, 
there is an EQ setting for you.  
NOTE: Using the EQ setting can diminish battery 
capacity somewhat. 
Just touch the EQ tab and then select either the type 
of music you most often listen to or a specific option 
to boost treble or bass. Experiment, have fun, and 
find the setting that‚Äôs perfect for you. 
  

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
231 
Volume Limit (Safely Listen to Music at a Reasonable 
Level) 
This is a great way for parents to control the 
volume on their kids‚Äô iPod touchs. It is also a 
good way to make sure you don‚Äôt listen too 
loudly through headphones so you don‚Äôt 
damage your ears. You just move the slider to 
a volume limit and then lock that limit. 
 
To lock the volume limit, touch the Lock Volume Limit button and enter a 4-digit 
passcode. You will be prompted to enter your passcode once more and the volume limit 
will then be locked. 
Using Home Sharing 
If you're like us, you probably have far 
more music on your big computer hard 
drive than you can fit on your iPod touch. 
With iPod touch and Home Sharing, 
that's not a problem.  
 
 
As long as you're on the same Wi-Fi 
network as your computer, you can 
stream anything from your desktop 
iTunes library straight to your iPod touch. 
To enable Home Sharing, make sure 
your computer Is logged into Home 
Sharing with your iTunes email address 
and password, then log into Home 
Sharing on your iPod touch with the 
same account. 
Once you're logged in, you'll be able to 
choose between your local (iPod touch) 
and remote (desktop iTunes) libraries. 
Here's how: 
 



CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
232 
1. Launch the Music app
2. Tap the More tab at the bottom 
right
3. Tap the Shared tab at the bottom 
of the list. (If you don't see a 
Shared tab, double check to 
make sure both your iPod touch 
and computer are both logged into 
Home Sharing using the same 
iTunes account)
4. Choose the name of your desktop 
machine from the Shared list, in 
this example that's MacPro. (You 
can share more than one iTunes 
library so you may have several to 
choose from.)
Your iPod touch library will disappear 
and you'll see your desktop iTunes 
library instead. It will look exactly the 
same as your iPod touch library, only the 
content will be different. 
To switch back to your iPod touch 
library, just repeat the same process but 
choose iPod touch from the Shared list 
instead.

Showing Media Controls When Your iPod touch is Locked 
You may want to get to your media controls 
even if your iPod touch is locked. Here's 
how: Just double-click the Home button 
and the controls for adjusting the audio 
show up on the top of the locked screen. 
There's no reason to unlock the screen and 
then go to the Music program to find the 
controls. 
 
In the image to the right, notice that the 
screen is still locked‚Äîyet the music 
controls are now visible along the top. You 
can pause, skip, go to a previous song, or 
adjust the volume without actually 
unlocking the iPod touch. 
NOTE: You‚Äôll only see these controls if 
there is audio playing. 
        
 
Listening to Free Internet Radio (Pandora) 
While your iPod touch gives you unprecedented control over your personal music 
library, there may be times when you want to just ‚Äúmix it up‚Äù and listen to some other 
music.  
TIP: A basic Pandora account is free and can save you considerable money compared with 
buying lots of new songs from iTunes.  
Pandora grew out of the Music Genome Project. This was a huge undertaking. A large 
team of musical analysts looked at just about every song ever recorded and then 
developed a complex algorithm of attributes to associate with each song. 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
234 
NOTE: There are an ever-increasing amount of ‚Äúinternet radio‚Äù or subscription music style apps 
now available including the popular Slacker Personal Radio, Spotify, Rdio, Last.fm, and 
others. Please also note that Pandora is a US-only application and Slacker available is only in the 
US and Canada. Spotfly is available in the US and Europe, and many others vary by region as 
well. Hopefully, more options will begin to pop up for international users. 
Getting Started with Pandora 
With Pandora you can design your own unique radio stations built around artists you 
like. Best of all, it is completely free! 
Start by downloading the Pandora app 
from the App Store. Just go to the App 
Store and search for Pandora. 
Now just touch the Pandora icon to start. 
 
 
The first time you start Pandora, you‚Äôll be 
asked to either create an account or to 
sign in if you already have an account. 
Just fill in the appropriate information‚Äîan 
email address and a password are 
required‚Äîand you can start designing 
your own music listening experience. 
 
 
Pandora is also available for your Windows 
or Mac computer and for most 
smartphone platforms. If you already have 
a Pandora account, all you have to do is 
sign in.  
 
 
TIP: Remember that you can move apps into folders. As you can see in Figure 12‚Äì7, we‚Äôve put 
three Music apps, including Pandora, into one folder named Music.  See more about using 
folders in Chapter 6: ‚ÄúIcons and Folders.‚Äù  

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
235 
Figure 12‚Äì7. Put like Music apps, such as Pandora, into one folder for easy retrieval.  
Pandora‚Äôs Main Screen 
Your stations are listed down the screen 
with the QuickMix at the top. Tap any 
station and it will begin to play. Usually, 
the first song will be from the actual artist 
chosen and the next songs will be from 
similar artists.  
 
 
Once you select a station, the music begins to play. You'll see the current song 
displayed, along with album art‚Äîvery much like when you play a song using the Music 
app.  
You'll also see a small Now Playing icon in the upper right corner‚Äîvery much like the 
Now Playing icon in the Music app. 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
236 
Touch the Detail view 
 icon in the upper right corner, just like the one you find in the 
Music app, and you‚Äôll see a nice bio of the artist, which changes with each new song. 
(See Figure 12-8).  
   
 
Figure 12‚Äì8. Pandora's Album cover view and the Detail view. 
Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down in Pandora 
If you like a particular song, touch the 
thumbs-up icon and you‚Äôll hear more from 
that artist. 
Conversely, if you don‚Äôt like an artist on 
this station, touch the thumbs-down icon 
and you won‚Äôt hear that artist again. 
If you like, you can pause a song and 
come back later, or skip to the next 
selection in your station.  
 
     
 
NOTE: With a free Pandora account, you 
are limited in the number of skips per 
hour you can make. Also, you‚Äôll 
occasionally hear advertising. To get rid of 
these annoyances, you can upgrade to a 
paid ‚ÄúPandora One‚Äù account as we show 
you below. 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
237 
Pandora‚Äôs Menu 
Between the two thumbs is a Menu button 
which looks like a triangle 
. Touch this and you 
can bookmark the artist or song, go to 
iTunes to buy music from this artist, or 
email the station to someone in your 
Contacts. 
 
 
Creating a New Station in Pandora 
Creating a new station couldn‚Äôt be easier.  
If you are listening to a station, press the 
back arrow in the upper left corner to 
return to the Pandora main screen.  Then 
tap the New Station button along the 
bottom row. Type in the name of an artist, 
song, or composer.  
When you find what you are looking for, 
touch the selection and Pandora will 
immediately start to build a station around 
your choice. 
You can also touch Genre and build a 
station around a particular genre of music. 
 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
238 
You‚Äôll then see the new station listed with 
your other stations.  
You can build up to 100 stations in 
Pandora.  
TIP: You can organize your stations by 
pressing the By Date or ABC buttons at 
the top of the screen. 
 
Adjusting Pandora‚Äôs Settings‚ÄîYour Account, Upgrading, 
and More 
You can sign out of your Pandora account, adjust the audio quality, and even upgrade 
to Pandora One (which removes advertising) by tapping the settings icon in the lower 
right corner of the screen. (See Figure 12‚Äì9.) 
 
Figure 12‚Äì9. Setting options in Pandora 

CHAPTER 11:  Playing Music 
239 
To sign out, tap the Sign Out button. 
To adjust the sound quality, move the switch under Cell Network Audio Quality either 
ON or OFF. When you are on a cellular network, setting this off is probably better, 
otherwise you may hear more skips and pauses in the playback.  
When you are on a strong Wi-Fi connection, you can set this to ON for better quality. 
See our ‚ÄúConnect to the Netowrk‚Äù chapter to learn more.  
To save your battery life, you should set the Auto-Lock to ON, which is the default. If 
you want the force the screen to stay lit, then switch this to OFF. 
To remove all advertising, tap the Upgrade to Pandora One button. A web browser 
window will open and you‚Äôll be take to Pandora‚Äôs web site to enter your credit card 
information. As of publishing time, the annual account cost is $36.00, but that may be 
different by the time you read this book.

                    Chapter 
iBooks and E-Books 
In this chapter, we will show you how to use your iPod touch for a good book-reading 
experience. For example, we will cover iBooks, including how to buy and download 
them, as well as how to find some great free classic books. We will also show you other 
e-book reading options that use the third-party Kindle and Kobo (formerly Shortcovers) 
readers on your iPod touch. 
The iPod touch can use Apple‚Äôs proprietary e-book reader, iBooks. In 
this chapter, we will show you how to download the iBooks app, how 
to shop for books in the iBooks Store, and how to read both PDF files 
(Adobe PDF format) and iBooks as well as take advantage of all the 
iBooks features. 
With iBooks, you can interact with books and PDF files like never 
before. Pages turn like a real book; and you can adjust font sizes, 
look up words in the built-in dictionary, and search through your text. 
In the App Store, you can also find apps for Amazon‚Äôs Kindle reader, a Barnes and 
Noble reader, the Stanza reader, and the Kobo reader. Both the Kindle and Kobo 
readers offer a great reading experience on the iPod touch.

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
242 
Downloading iBooks 
Search the App Store for ‚ÄúiBooks‚Äù or 
‚ÄúApple.‚Äù You will find the iBooks app 
among the selections listed. 
NOTE: On a brand new iPod touch, you 
should get a notice asking: ‚ÄúDo you want 
to download iBooks now?‚Äù 
If you don‚Äôt see this notice right away, tap 
the App Store app and the notice should 
pop up. 
Select the iBooks app and touch the Free 
button to download. 
Select Install and iBooks will be 
downloaded and installed on the iPod 
touch. 
 
The iBooks Store 
Before you can start enjoying your reading experience, you need to load up your iBooks 
library with titles. Fortunately, many books can be found for free in the iBooks store, 
including the near complete Gutenberg Collection of classics and public domain titles. 
NOTE: Paid iBooks content is not available in all countries. However, free content is available 
everywhere, including the Project Guttenberg collection of classic, public domain literature. 
Just touch the Store button in the upper-
right corner of your bookshelf, and you will 
be taken to the iBooks Store. 
 
 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
243 
The iBooks Store is arranged much like the 
App Store. There is a Categories button in 
the top left, opposite the Library button. 
Touch this to see all the available 
categories from which you can choose 
your books. 
Featured books are highlighted on the 
front page of the store, with New and 
Notable titles displayed for browsing. 
At the bottom of the store are five soft 
keys: Featured, Charts, Browse, Search, 
and Purchases. 
 
Touch the Charts button 
 to see 
all the top charts and New York Times 
bestselling books. Touch the Purchases  
button to see all the books you have 
purchased or downloaded for your library. 
 
 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
244 
Purchasing a book is much like 
purchasing an app. Touch a book title 
that interests you and browse the 
description and customer reviews. 
When you are ready to purchase the 
title, touch the Price button. 
 
 
NOTE: Many titles have a sample download. It is a great idea to check this sample out if you are 
not sure that you want to purchase the book. If you download a sample, and you can always 
purchase the full book from within that sample. 
Once you decide to download a sample or 
purchase a title, iBooks switches to the 
Bookshelf view, and you can see the book 
being deposited onto your bookshelf. Your 
book is now available for reading.

Using the Search Button 
Just like iTunes and the App Store, the 
iBooks Store gives you a Search window 
in which you can type virtually any phrase. 
You can search for an author, title, or 
series. Just touch Search at the bottom of 
the screen, and the on-screen keyboard 
pops up. Type in an author, title, series, or 
genre of book, and then press the Search 
button. 
You will see suggestions pop up that 
match your search; just touch the 
appropriate suggestion to go to that title. 
 
 
TIP: Do a search for ‚ÄúProject Gutenberg‚Äù to see thousands of free, public domain titles. 
Switching Collections (Books, PDFs, More) 
Your iBooks app has multiple collections 
of books or PDF files (Adobe PDF format 
reader).   
You can easily switch collections between 
these two and add new collections by 
tapping the Collections button at the 
middle of the top of the library.   
This button will show you the currently 
visible collection.  In this image, Books is 
the currently collection.  Tap the Books 
button to see the available collections.

created by using the buttons at the 
bottom.  
Reading PDFs 
Switch collections to view your PDFs 
collection as shown above. 
Tap any book to open it up and start 
reading.  All the same navigation features 
work as described in the "Reading iBooks" 
section.   
One difference is that you will see 
thumbnail images of the pages of the PDF 
file at the bottom of the page.  Tap any 
thumbnail to jump to that page.  Drag your 
finger back and forth along the thumbnail 
Images to jump to a specific page. 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
247 
Reading iBooks 
Touch any title in your library to open it for 
reading. The book will open to the very 
first page, which is often the title page or 
other front matter in the book. 
 
 
In the upper-left corner, next to the Library 
button, you can see a Table of Contents 
button. To jump to the table of contents, 
either touch the Table of Contents button 
or simply turn the pages to advance to the 
table of contents. 
You can turn pages in one of three ways. 
First, you can touch the right-hand side of 
the page to turn to the next page. Second, 
you can slowly touch and hold the screen 
on the right edge of the page; and, while 
continuing to touch the screen, gently and 
slowly move your finger to the left. 
 
 
TIP: If you move your finger very slowly you can actually see the words on the back of the page 
as you ‚Äúturn‚Äù it‚Äîa very cool visual effect. 
The last way to turn pages is to use the 
slider at the bottom of the page. As you 
slowly slide from left to right, you will see 
the page number on top of the slider. 
Release the slider and you can advance to 
that particular page number. 
 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
248 
Customizing Your Reading Experience: Brightness, Fonts, 
and Font Sizes 
In the upper center of the book, there are three icons available: Brightness, Size, and 
Search. These options help to make your reading experience much more immersive. 
Touch the Brightness icon and you can 
adjust the brightness of the book. 
If you are reading in bed in a very dark 
room, you might want to dim the tablet by 
sliding the Brightness slider all the way to 
the left. If you are out in the sunlight, you 
may need to slide it all the way to the right. 
However, you should keep in mind that 
high screen brightness consumes more 
battery power than most other features, so 
turn this feature back down when you 
don‚Äôt need your screen to be so bright 
anymore. 
 
 
NOTE: The preceding tip adjusts the brightness only within iBooks. To adjust the global 
brightness of the iPod touch, use the Settings app (go to the Settings icon > Brightness & 
Wallpaper). 
The Font Size and Type icon lets you 
adjust font values to suit your preferences. 
Do this to Increase the Font Size: 
Tap the large A icon multiple times. 
Do this to Decrease the Font Size: 
Tap the small a icon multiple times. 
At the time of writing, there are six 
available font styles‚Äîbut there may well 
be more fonts available when you read this 
book. 
Have fun and try out some of the various 
fonts. The default selection is the Palatino 
font, but all of the fonts look great, and a 
larger font size can make a difference for 
 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
249 
some. The goal is to adjust the font size so 
the text is as comfortable and easy to read 
as possible. 
Grow Your Vocabulary Using the Built-In Dictionary 
iBooks contains a very powerful built-in dictionary, which can be quite helpful when you 
run across a word that is new or unfamiliar. 
NOTE: The first time you attempt to use the dictionary, your iPod touch will need to download it. 
Follow the on-screen prompts to download the dictionary. 
Accessing the dictionary could not be 
easier. Just touch and hold any word in 
the book. A pop-up will appear with 
various options that let you highlight a 
word, create a note, or search for other 
occurrences of this particular word. 
 
 
 
Touch Dictionary and a pronunciation and definition of the word will be displayed. 
Touch Done to leave the dictionary and go back to your book. 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
250 
Setting an In-Page Bookmark 
To view your bookmarks, just 
touch the Table of Contents 
icon at the top left of the 
screen (next to the Library 
icon), and then touch 
Bookmarks. Touch the 
bookmark highlighted and you 
will jump to that section in |the 
book. 
 
 
TIP: You do not need to set a bookmark every time you leave iBooks. The app will automatically 
remember where you stop reading in a book. This holds true no matter how many books you open 
and read, so can always return to exactly where you stopped reading in a given book. The iBooks 
app will also sync with the version of iBooks on your iPad, so you can move back and forth 
between devices and keep your place in a given book. 
Using Highlighting and Notes 
There are some very nice ‚Äúadded touches‚Äù to the iBooks app. For example, there may 
be times that you want to highlight a particular word to come back to at another time. 
And there may be other times you want to leave yourself a note in the margin. 
Both of these things are very easy to do in iBooks. 
Highlighting Text 
Follow these steps to highlight 
text in the iBooks app: 
1. Touch and hold any word 
to bring up the menu 
options. 
2. Choose Highlight from the 
menu options. 
 
 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
251 
3. To remove the highlight, 
tap the word and then 
select Remove Highlight. 
Changing the color of a highlight 
is as simple as following these 
steps: 
1. Tap the highlighted word. 
2. Choose Colors from the 
menu. 
3. Choose a new color. 
 
Adding Notes 
It‚Äôs also easy to add a note in the margin in iBooks: 
1. Touch and hold any word, as you did previously. 
2. Choose Note from the menu. 
3. Type in your note and then touch Done. The note now appears on the side of the 
page in the margin (see Figure 13‚Äì1). 
TIP: Your notes will also appear under your bookmarks on the title page. Just touch the Title 
Page button and then touch Bookmarks. You can find the notes you write at the bottom of the 
page.  
You can change the color of notes the same way you change the color of highlights!

Figure 13‚Äì1. Using the Notes feature in iBooks 
Using Search 
iBooks contains a powerful search feature 
built right in. Just touch the Search icon, 
and (as in other programs on the iPod 
touch) the built-in keyboard will pop up. 
Type in the word or phrase you are 
searching for and you will see a list of 
chapters where that word occurs. 
Just touch the selection desired and you 
will jump to that section in the book. You 
also have the option of jumping right to 
Google or Wikipedia by touching the 
appropriate buttons at the bottom of the 
Search window. 
NOTE: Using the Wikipedia or Google 
search will take you out of iBooks and 
launch Safari.

Moving and Deleting Books 
Deleting books from your iBooks library is very similar to deleting applications from the 
iPod touch. You can delete or move iBooks by tapping the Edit button in the Library 
view. 
top-left corner. 
 
Once you touch the Edit button, you will 
notice a small black ‚Äúx‚Äù in the upper-left 
corner of each book. 
 
 
Just touch the ‚Äúx‚Äù and you will be 
prompted to delete the book. Once you 
touch Delete, the book will disappear from 
the shelf. 
 
 
Other E-Book Readers: Kindle and Kobo 
As we have noted, the iBooks app offers 
an unparalleled e-book reading 
experience. However, there are other e-
book reader apps available for the iPod 
touch that are worth checking out. 
 
 
Many users already have a Kindle and 
have invested in a Kindle library. Others 
use the Kobo e-reader software (formerly 
called Shortcovers) and have invested in 
a library of books for that platform. 
 
 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
254 
Fortunately, both e-book platforms have apps in the iPod touch App Store. When either 
program is downloaded and installed, you can sign in and read your complete library for 
its respective platform on your iPod touch. 
NOTE: No matter which of these other e-readers you choose, you can always just ‚Äúsign in,‚Äù see 
your complete library, and pick up just where you left off in your last book‚Äîeven if you started 
reading on a different device. 
Download E-Reader Apps 
It‚Äôs a trivial matter to download alternative e-reader apps. Simply go to the App Store, 
touch Categories, and then touch Books. In this section, you will find the Kindle and 
Kobo apps. Both are free apps, so just touch the Free button to begin downloading one 
of them. 
TIP: It is usually faster to search by the name of the app if you know which one you are looking 
for. 
Once your desired e-reader software is installed, touch the app‚Äôs icon to start it. 
The Kindle Reader 
Amazon‚Äôs Kindle reader is the world‚Äôs most popular e-reader. Millions of people have 
Kindle books, and the Kindle app allows you to read your Kindle books on your iPod 
touch. 
The iPod touch and iPad versions of the Kindle app have just been updated to support audio and 
video, making these versions even more advanced than the one found on the Kindle hardware 
itself. 
TIP: If you use a Kindle device, don‚Äôt worry about signing in from your iPod touch. You can have 
several devices tied to a single account. You will be able to enjoy all the books you‚Äôve purchased 
for your Kindle right on the Kindle app on the iPod touch. 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
255 
To use the Kindle app on your iPod touch, 
just touch its icon and either sign in to your 
Kindle account or create a new account 
with a user name and password. 
 
 
Once you sign in, you will see your Kindle 
books on the Home page. You can touch 
a book to start reading it. 
 
 
NOTE: In order to buy or download new books, you need to go to www.amazon.com in the Safari 
web browser. Once you‚Äôve bought or downloaded a new book to your account, it will appear in the 
Kindle app. 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
256 
To read a Kindle book, touch its cover and 
it will open. 
To see the options for reading, just touch 
the screen and they will be shown along 
the bottom row of icons. 
You can add a bookmark by touching the 
Plus (+) button. Once the bookmark is set, 
the Plus (+) button turns into to a Minus (-) 
button. 
You can go to the cover, table of contents, 
or beginning of the book (or specify any 
other location in the book) by touching the 
Book button. 
The font, as well as the color of the page, 
can be adjusted. One very interesting 
feature is the ability to change the page to 
Black‚Äîwhich is great when reading at 
night. 
To advance pages, either swipe from right to left or touch the right side of the page. To 
go back a page, just swipe from left to right or touch the left side of the page. 
Tap the screen and a slider appears at the bottom; you can move this to advance to any 
page in the book. 
To return to your list of books, just touch the Home button. 

CHAPTER 12:  iBooks and E-Books 
257 
The Kobo Reader 
Like the Kindle reader, the Kobo reader 
begins by asking you to sign into your existing 
Kobo Books account. All of your existing Kobo 
Books will then be available for reading. 
Kobo‚Äôs Shelf view uses a bookshelf metaphor, 
similar to the one used by iBooks. Tap the 
book cover for whichever book you wish to 
open. 
Or, you can touch the List tab to see your 
books organized in a List view. 
 
 
 
Open any book, and you will see two buttons 
along the top of the Kobo reader: I‚Äôm Reading 
and Settings. 
Touching the I‚Äôm Reading button places a 
bookmark where you left off in the book and 
returns the screen to your Shelf view. 
 
Touching the Settings button will display a 
series of buttons along the bottom of the 
screen for viewing bookmarks, seeing 
information about the book, and adjusting the 
page transition style and font. Under those 
buttons are four icons: Font, Brightness, 
Screen Lock, and Nighttime Reading. Touch 
any of these buttons to make adjustments to 
your viewing experience. 
 
To advance pages in the Kobo reader, touch the right side of the page. To go back a 
page, just touch the left side of the page. You can also use the slider at the bottom to 
advance through the pages.

                    Chapter 
Newsstand and More 
In the last chapter, we spoke about how the iPod touch has revolutionized the world of 
reading with iBooks. Not only is the iPod touch unparalleled for reading e-books, it‚Äôs 
Newsstand folder is unequaled in dealing with new media such as online newspapers 
and magazines. Plus, the App Store makes it easy to find comic books readers, PDF 
readers, and more. The iPod touch is even set to revitalize the comic book industry with 
comic books that look beautiful and are amazingly interactive. 
In this chapter, we‚Äôll explore how to enjoy new media using the iPod touch‚Äôs vivid screen 
and terrific touch interface. 
Newsstand 
The Newsstand is a special folder on your iPod 
touch‚Äôs Home screen that looks like a bookshelf 
and collects and organizes all your magazine and 
newspaper apps. This folder does not behave like 
a regular iPod touch folder. If a magazine or 
newspaper app supports Newsstand, then it will 
show you the latest cover art or front page for 
that periodical sitting on the shelf, rather than the 
Newsstand Folder icon (you will also see this 
cover or front page in the Fast App Switcher). 
If the magazine or newspaper app offers 
subscriptions and you‚Äôre a subscriber, then 
Newsstand apps can also automatically 
download the latest issues overnight, so you have 
something new to read when you open it in the 
morning. 
 
 
13 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More 
260 
The Newsstand folder also has a Store button that takes you to a special section of the 
App Store. This section lists all the magazine and newspaper apps that currently support 
Newsstand. 
Other than the special presentation and ability to download new issues automatically, a 
Newsstand app otherwise functions just like any other app. 
NOTE: It‚Äôs up to each magazine and newspaper app to add Newsstand support. At the time of 
writing, many but not all magazine apps have added Newsstand support. If an app doesn‚Äôt 
support Newsstand, it will download to the Home screen and behave just like any regular, non-
Newsstand app. 
Also, magazine and newspaper selection can vary greatly by country. Use the Store button in 
Newsstand to see the latest selection in your area. 
Buying and Subscribing to Periodicals  
The newspaper and magazine apps in Newsstand 
are typically free; however, they also typically come 
with very little or even no content built in. To get the 
content, you need to either buy individual issues or 
subscribe to a number of issues. 
Buying issues is handled like any other in-app 
purchase. Typically, you‚Äôll be shown a list of recent 
issues with the cover art on the left and a content 
blurb on the right, along with the price of the issue. 
Tap the price and you‚Äôll be asked for your iTunes 
password to confirm the purchase. Once you 
confirm a purchase, your issue will begin to 
download. 
Subscribing to newspapers and magazines is 
handled like a special in-app purchase that lasts for 
a specified period of time. For example, you can 
often purchase a year‚Äôs worth of newspapers for a 
set price. Some newspapers and magazines offer 
different subscription length options, such as three 
years, six months, and so on. Some also offer 
bundles that include both the print and digital 
editions. Make sure you read your options carefully 
and figure out which one provides you with the 
greatest value. 
You might wonder what you do if you‚Äôve bought a 
 
 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More 
261 
subscription or an individual issue, and you need to 
re-install the app that displays the content. If that 
happens, you can simply re-install the app and then 
restore your subscription or re-download any 
individual issues you‚Äôve previously purchased. In 
other words, the process of restoring content in 
Newsstand apps is identical to that of restoring 
content for any other in-app purchase. 
 
 
Newspapers 
Remember the days when newspapers were delivered to the house? Invariably, if there 
was one puddle in the sidewalk, that was where the newspaper landed! You took it out 
of that plastic bag, shook it off, and tried to make out what was in the section that got 
soaked. 
Well, those days may be gone forever. You now have the opportunity to interact with the 
news and even get your paper delivered every day‚Äîbut to your iPod touch instead of 
your driveway. 
Many newspapers and news sites are developing apps for the iPod touch, with new 
apps seeming to appear every day. Some of these apps provide a level of free content, 
but require you to create an account or subscribe to get more. Others apps provide 
content only with a subscription. 
NOTE: If you already subscribe to the print edition of your local newspaper, it might provide you 
with discounted or even free access to its iPod touch app. Be sure to read any registration or 
subscription offers carefully to see if you qualify. 
Many newspapers also have dedicated web sites. Some are optimized for the iPod touch and 
Safari, while others offer a full web experience. Some require registration or a paid subscription 
to view the paper‚Äôs full content. 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More 
262 
Let‚Äôs take a quick look at The New York Times, one of largest newspapers in the U.S., 
and see how that paper has revolutionized reading the news on the iPod touch. 
The New York Times app 
The New York Times provides various apps, both free and paid, to bring you the news 
on the iPod touch. 
The New York Times offers a slimmed-
down version of the paper in its free iPod 
touch app. 
There are four soft keys at the bottom of 
the page: Top News, Most E-Mailed, 
Favorites and Sections. Each section 
carries a sampling of stories from those 
sections in the current day‚Äôs paper. 
Touching Sections shows you tabs for all 
sections of the New York Times. 
 
Navigating The New York Times app is as simple as touching an article and scrolling 
through the story. While reading a story, just touch the center of the screen and the soft 
keys on the top and bottom will appear. 
To go back to the Home page, touch the Latest News button in the upper left-hand corner. 
NOTE: If you were in another section‚Äîsay Technology‚Äîthe button in the upper-left corner 
would  
say Technology. 
 
To email an article, just touch the Share icon in the lower-left corner. This button is only 
available when you are inside an article, not on the Home page. 
Touch the icon and you can send the article via email, copy the link, or Twitter. 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More 
263 
Moving Through and Enjoying Content 
After you play for a while with different newspaper apps, you‚Äôll begin to realize that there 
is no real standard for navigating newspaper content. This means you‚Äôll need to become 
familiar with each app‚Äôs own way of navigating articles, as well as how to return to the 
main screen. Here‚Äôs a short guide for generally navigating these types of apps: 
 Showing or Hiding Control buttons or Captions: Tapping the screen 
once usually shows hidden controls or picture captions. You can tap 
the screen again to re-hide these elements. 
 Getting to the Details of an Article: Usually, you scroll through the 
articles, just as you would on a web page. 
 Viewing a Video: Typically, you just tap a video to start playing it. See 
Chapter 14: ‚ÄúViewing Videos‚Äù to learn how to navigate videos on the 
iPod touch. 
 Expanding a Video or Image Size: You can try pinching open in the 
video or image and then double-tapping it. You can also look for an 
Expand button or try rotating to Landscape mode. 
 Reducing a Video or Image Size: You can try pinching closed inside 
the video or image to reduce the size of a video. You can also look for 
a Close or Minimize button or try rotating back to Portrait mode. 
 Sharing an Article: Sending an article link via email‚Äîor sharing it over 
a social network like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn‚Äîis a common 
feature. Look for an Action or Share button. 
 Adjusting Font Sizes: Many newspaper apps have a button or 
settings option for increasing or decreasing the default font size to 
make the content easier to read. 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More

Magazines 
It is no secret that both newspapers and magazines have suffered declines in readership 
over the last few years. The iPod touch offers a totally new way of reading magazines 
that might just give the industry the boost it needs. 
Pictures are incredibly clear and brilliant in magazines on the iPod touch. Navigation is 
usually easy, and stories seem to come to life, much more so than in their print 
counterparts. Add video and sound integration right into the magazine, and you can see 
how the iPod touch truly enhances the magazine reading experience. 
Some magazines, such as TIME Magazine, include links to live or frequently updated 
content. These links might be called Newsfeeds, Live Editions, or Updates. Check for 
them in any magazine you purchase‚Äîthese links will help you access the most up-to-
date information. 
TIP: Make sure to check the user ratings for a magazine or other app before you purchase it. 
Doing so may save you some money or grief! 
The App Store has a couple different kinds of magazine apps. First, you can find apps 
that let you purchase individual magazines or view limited content from a given 
magazine for free. Second, you can find magazine readers that provide samples of many 
magazines; these allow you to subscribe to weekly or monthly delivery of a given 
magazine. 
If you browse in the App Store by 
Categories ‚û§ Newsstand, then tap Top 
Free a the top, you can check out all the 
free magazines and newspapers. 
 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More 
265 
The Zinio Magazine App‚ÄîA Sampler 
The Zinio app takes a unique approach. This app is free in the App Store, and it gives 
you the ability to subscribe to hundreds of magazine titles. Reading magainzes in Zinio 
requires a few simple steps: 
1. Log into the Zinio app (You can 
create a free account). 
2. View and download free samples 
in the My Library section or click 
the Shop button at the bottom to 
purchase magazines. 
3. Some magazines may be giving away full, 
free issues. Just look in the My Library 
section to see what is available. 
 
 
There are many popular magazines you can 
choose from. The categories cover everything 
from art to sports and more. Prices vary, but 
often you can buy either a single issue or a 
yearly subscription. 
For example, the latest issue of Popular 
Mechanics was US $1.99 on Zinio, and a 
yearly subscription was US $7.99. 
Some of the subscriptions make great sense. 
A single issue of Bike Magazine was US $4.99 
at the time of writing, while a yearly 
subscription was only US $9.00. 
A closer look revealed that there were more 
than 16 cycling magazines you could 
subscribe to at the time of writing. 
 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More

Comic Books 
One genre of ‚Äúnew media‚Äù poised for a comeback with the advent of the iPod touch is 
the comic book. The iPod touch, with its high-definition screen and powerful processor, 
makes the pages of comic books come alive. 
There are already a few comic book apps available, including one from the famous 
Marvel Comics. DC Comics has just launched its app, as well. This app was created by 
the same people who make the Marvel app. 
To locate the Marvel Comics app in the App 
Store, go to Categories and then Books. The 
app is free, and you can purchase comic books 
from inside the app. 
At the bottom of the Home screen, you‚Äôll see five 
buttons: My Comics, Featured, Free, Top 25, 
and Browse. Purchases you make will be under 
the My Comics heading. 
The App Store gives you the opportunity to 
download both free comics and individual issues 
for sale. Most sell for $1.99 per issue. 
Each tab takes you to a new list of comics to 
browse, much like the iTunes store. 
Touch the Browse button to browse by Series, 
Creator, Genre, Rating, Storylines/Arcs, or 
Release Date. Or you can type in a search to find 
a particular comic. 
 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More 
267 
You can read a comic book in one of two 
ways. First, you can swipe through the 
pages and read one page after another. 
Second, you can double-tap a frame to 
Zoom in, and then tap the screen to 
advance to the next frame in the comic 
strip. From there, you can just swipe from 
right to left to advance a frame; or, if you 
want to go back, swipe from left to right. 
To return to the Home screen or to see the 
onscreen options, just tap the center of the 
screen. You‚Äôll see a Settings button in the 
top-left corner. Touch this and you can 
Jump to the First Page, Browse to a 
Page, or go to the Settings menu. 
NOTE: The makers of this app, ComiXology, also make the app that contains the Marvel comics, 
as well as a bunch of others, including DC, Archie, Image, and Top Cow.

The iPod touch as a PDF Reader 
There are several programs available that turn the iPod touch into a very capable PDF 
viewing program. For example, you can also read PDF files in the iBooks app. However, 
another great PDF reader is called GoodReader for iPhone.  (Yes - It says "for iPhone," 
but you can use this just fine on your iPod touch). 
NOTE: Chapter 16: ‚ÄúCommunicate with Email‚Äù showed you how to open attachments, including 
PDF files. One great benefit of the GoodReader app is that it lets you use Wi-Fi to transfer large 
PDF files. 
You can find the GoodReader for iPhone 
app in the Productivity section of the App 
Store. At the time of writing, this app costs 
US $4.99.   
NOTE: iBooks can also read PDF files 
that are emailed as attachments. If 
iBooks is installed, just choose Open in 
iBooks when opening a PDF. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More 
269 
Transferring Files to your iPod touch 
One of the great things about the GoodReader for iPhone app is that you can use it to 
wirelessly transfer large files from your Mac or PC to the iPod touch for viewing in the 
GoodReader app. You can also use GoodReader for document sharing in iTunes, as 
discussed in Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync with iCloud, iTunes, and More. ‚Äù Follow these steps to 
transfer a file with GoodReader: 
1. Touch the small Wi-Fi icon at the bottom left of the screen, 
 and the Wi-Fi Transfer Utility pops up. You are 
prompted either to type in an IP address into your browser or a Bonjour 
address if you use the Bonjour service. 
2. Type the address shown in the window from GoodReader into a web 
browser on your computer. Now you can make your computer act as a 
server. You‚Äôll see that your computer and iPod touch are now 
connected.  You might bookmark this page on your browser, however, 
beware because it can change if you re-start your wireless network 
router and your iPod touch gets a different wireless network address. 
3. Click the Choose File button in the web browser on your computer to 
locate a file to upload to your iPod touch. 
4. Once you‚Äôve selected the file, click Upload Selected File and the file 
will be automatically transferred to your iPod touch. 
How is this useful? Well, for one of the authors (Gary), the iPod touch has become a 
repository for more than 100 pieces of piano sheet music. This means no more 
downloading PDF files, printing them out, putting them into binders, and then trying to 
remember which song is in which binder. Now, all his music is catalogued on the iPod 
touch. All he has to do is put the iPod touch on the piano, and he has access to all his 
music in one place. 
NOTE: GoodReader can even unzip files you receive as email attachments. 

CHAPTER 13:  Newsstand and More 
270 
Navigating the GoodReader PDF viewer is 
quite easy. This app is more sensitive than 
others, so tap the center of the screen quickly 
to bring up the onscreen controls. You can 
then go to your library or touch the Turn Page 
icon to turn the page. 
The easiest way to move through pages is to 
touch the lower-right side of the screen to 
advance a page, or touch the upper-left side of 
the screen to go back a page. This becomes 
quite natural after a while. 
You can also flick up or down to turn pages. 
To go to another PDF file or another piece of 
sheet music, just touch the center of the iPod 
touch quickly and touch the My Documents 
button in the upper-left corner. 
 
Connecting to Google Docs and other Servers with 
GoodReader 
You can also connect to Google Docs and other servers with GoodReader. Follow 
these steps to do so: 
1. In the Web Downloads tab, choose Connect to Servers. 
2. Select Google Docs. (You can select a number of different servers: mail 
servers, MobileMe iDisk, Public iDisk, Dropbox, box.net, 
FilesAnywhere.com, MyDisk.se, WebDAV Server, and FTP Servers.) 
3. Enter your Google Docs username and password to log in. 
4. Once you‚Äôve made the connection, a new Google Docs Server icon will 
appear under the Connect to Server tab on the right side of the page. 
5. Tap the new Google tab to connect to the server (an Internet 
connection is required). 
6. Now you‚Äôll see a list of all the documents you have stored on Google 
Docs. Tap any document and select the file type to download it. 
Usually, PDF works well for this. (Google docs can do a Save As..., and 
PDF files are easier to work with.) 
Once the file is downloaded, it will appear on the left side of GoodReader; you can 
simply touch it to open it.

                     Chapter 
Viewing Videos 
The iPod touch gives you an amazing platform to enjoy videos, TV shows and movies. 
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the various video-viewing applications available. 
In this chapter, we will show you how you can watch movies, TV shows, podcasts, and 
music videos on your iPod touch. 
You can buy or download many videos for free from the iTunes store or iTunes 
University. You can also link your iPod touch to your Netflix account (and most likely 
other video rental services soon), allowing you to watch streaming TV shows and 
movies. 
With your iPod touch, you can also watch YouTube videos and videos from the Web on 
your Safari browser and through various apps from the App Store. 
NOTE: At the time of publishing, the Netflix app was only available in the U.S. and Canada. We 
hope similar apps will make their way to the broader international market. 
Your iPod touch as a Video Player 
The iPod touch is more than a capable music player; it is also a fantastic portable video-
playing system. Its widescreen, fast processor, incredible pixel density, and great 
operating system make watching anything from music videos to TV shows and full-
length motion pictures a real joy. The size of the iPod touch is perfect for sitting back in 
a chair or watching on an airplane. It is also great for the kids in the back seat of long 
car trips. The near 10-hour battery life means you can even go on a coast-to-coast flight 
and not run out of power! You can also buy a ‚Äúpower inverter‚Äù for your car to keep the 
iPod touch charged even longer (see the ‚ÄúCharging Your iPod touch and Battery Tips‚Äù 
section in Chapter 1: ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù).

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
272 
Loading Videos onto Your iPod touch 
You can load videos on your iPod touch just like your music by using the iTunes app on 
your computer or right from the iTunes app on your iPod touch. 
If you purchase or rent videos from iTunes on your computer, then you will manually or 
automatically sync these videos to your iPod touch. 
Watching Videos on the iPod touch 
To watch videos, simply tap your Videos app. 
NOTE: You can also watch videos from the YouTube app, the Safari 
app, and other video-related apps you load from the App Store. 
      
Video Categories  
Each section of the Videos app under the Video 
tab in the iPod app is separated by horizontal bars 
with one of several possible category names inside 
the bar: Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, and Music 
Videos. The first category is the Movies section; 
these will be visible if you have movies loaded on 
the iPod touch. 
You may see more or fewer categories depending 
on the types of videos you have loaded on your 
iPod touch. If you have only Movies and iTunes U 
videos, then you will see only those two category 
buttons. Just scroll up or down to show the 
corresponding videos in that category. 
 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
273 
Searching for Videos  
If you have a lot of videos, and other content 
loaded on your iPod touch and want to find a 
particular video, you can do it by following these 
steps: 
1. Tap the time at the very top of your screen 
to jump to the search box. 
 
 
2. Type a few letters or a word or two of the 
title of the video. 
3. In this example we typed "email" to find 
any videos related to using email on our 
iPod touch.  Up popped a video tutorial 
showing how to work with email 
attachments from one of the author's web 
sites: www.MadeSimpleLearining.com. 
4. Tap any video that appears in the search 
results to start playing it.  
Playing a Movie 
Just tap the movie you wish to watch and it will begin to play. Most videos take 
advantage of the relatively large screen real estate of the iPod touch by playing in 
Widescreen (i.e., Landscape) mode. Just turn your iPod touch on its side to watch them. 
A video will begin playing automatically. When it first starts, there are no menus, 
controls, or anything else on the screen, except for the video. 
You can tap anywhere on the screen to make the control bars and other options 
become visible. Most options in the Videos app are very similar to those in the Music 
app Tap the Play/Pause button and the video will pause. Tap the Play/Pause button 
again and the video will resume playing. 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
274 
Fast-Forward or Rewind the Video 
On either side of the Play/Pause button are the usual Fast-Forward and Rewind 
buttons. To jump to the next chapter-specific part of the video, just touch and hold the 
Fast-Forward button (to the right of Play/Pause). When you get to the desired spot, 
release the button and the video will begin playing normally. 
After pressing Pause to stop the video, you can press and hold the Fast-Forward or 
Rewind buttons to do slow motion forward or backward.  The fun thing is that you can 
hear the audio slowed down as well. 
To rewind to the beginning of the video, tap the Rewind button. To rewind to a specific 
part or location, touch and hold as you did while you were fast forwarding the video. 
NOTE: If this is a full-length movie with several chapters, tapping either Reverse or  
Fast-Forward will move either back or ahead one chapter. 
Using the Time Scrubber Bar 
At the top of the video screen is a 
slider that lets you scrub through 
the elapsed time of the video. If 
you know exactly (or 
approximately) which point in the 
video you wish to watch, just hold 
the slider bar and then drag it to 
that location. Some people find 
this to be a little more exact than 
holding down the Fast-Forward 
or Rewind buttons. 
 
 
TIP: Drag your finger down to move the slider control more slowly.  

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
275 
Changing the Size of the Video (Widescreen vs. Full Screen) 
Most of your videos will play in widescreen format. However, if you have a video that 
was not converted for your iPod touch or is not optimized for your screen resolution, you 
can touch the Expand button, which is to the right of the upper Status bar. 
You will notice that there are two arrows on the button. If 
you are in Full Screen mode, the arrows point in, toward 
each other. If you are in Widescreen mode, the arrows point 
outward. 
 
If a widescreen movie is not taking up the full screen of the iPod touch, touching this 
button will zoom in a bit. Touching it again will zoom back out. 
NOTE: You can also simply double-tap the screen to zoom in and fill the screen. Be aware that, 
just like on your widescreen TV, trying to force a non-widescreen video into Widescreen mode 
can sometimes cause you to lose part of the picture. 
Using AirPlay 
Apple‚Äôs AirPlay mirroring feature lets you beam your video to an 
Apple TV, so you can enjoy it on your big screen TV. Just tap the 
AirPlay button on the bottom right and select Apple TV as your 
output destination. After a few moments, your iPod touch screen 
will go dark and your video will start to play on your big screen 
TV, right where you left off. 
 
To return the video to your iPod 
touch, tap AirPlay again and 
choose iPod touch as the 
destination. 
 
 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
276 
TIP: If you don‚Äôt have or want an Apple TV, you have a couple other ways to watch your movies. 
For example, you can purchase a VGA or HDMI adapter to plug your iPod touch into a VGA 
computer monitor or HDTV. 
VGA supports video only, requires that the app support this feature, and it isn‚Äôt usually 
compatible with DRM. HDMI supports video and audio, and it also requires that the app support 
that feature. However, it‚Äôs also HDCP-compliant, so it will work with DRM content like iTunes 
videos. 
Apple also makes component video cables that are DRM-compliant and work with most TVs. 
See the ‚ÄúAccessories‚Äù section of the Quick Start Guide for more information. 
Using the Chapters Feature 
Most full-length movies purchased from the iTunes store‚Äîand some that are converted 
for the iPod touch‚Äîwill give you a Chapters feature. Watching one of these on your iPod 
touch is very much like watching a DVD on your home TV. 
Just bring up the controls for the video by tapping the screen, and 
then select Chapters. 
 
This will bring you back to the main page for the movie. 
Tap the Chapters button in the upper-right corner, and then scroll 
through to find and then touch the chapter you wish to watch. 
 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
277 
Viewing the Chapters  
You can scroll through or flick through
quickly to locate the scene or chapter 
that you wish to watch. 
You will also notice that, to the far 
right of each chapter, is the exact 
time (relative to the start of the movie)
that the chapter begins. 
In addition to the chapter menu mentioned previously, you can also quickly advance to 
the previous or next chapter in a movie by tapping the Rewind or Fast-Forward button. 
One tap moves you one chapter in either direction. 
NOTE: The Chapters feature usually works only with movies that are purchased from the iTunes 
store. Movies that are converted and loaded onto your iPod touch usually will not have chapters. 
Watching a TV Show 
The iPod touch is great for watching your favorite TV shows. You can purchase TV 
shows from the iTunes store, and you can download sample shows from some iPod 
touch apps, such as the Hulu Plus app. 
Just scroll down to the TV Shows
category separator to see the shows you 
have downloaded on your iPod touch. 
Scroll through your available shows and 
touch Play. The video controls work just 
like the controls for watching a movie. 
NOTE: At the time of writing, iTunes in the 
Cloud allows users in the U.S. to re-
download previously purchased TV shows 
directly onto their iPod touch (see Chapter 
21: ‚ÄúiTunes on Your Device‚Äù for more 
information). 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
278 
Watching Podcasts 
We normally think of podcasts as 
being audio-only broadcasts that you 
can download using iTunes. Video 
podcasts are now quite prevalent and 
can be found on any number of sites, 
including many public broadcasting 
web sites. They can also be found in 
the iTunes U section of iTunes; this 
section lists university podcasts and 
other, related information. 
 
Here‚Äôs an interesting iTunes U story from Gary Mazo: 
‚ÄúRecently, I was browsing the iTunes U section inside the iTunes app on the 
iPod touch with my son, who was just accepted to CalTech. We were wondering 
about the housing situation and, lo and behold, we found a video podcast 
showing a tour of the CalTech dorms. We downloaded it, and the podcast went 
right into the podcast directory for future viewing. We were able to do a 
complete virtual tour of the housing without flying out there from the East 
Coast.‚Äù 
Watching Music Videos 
Music videos are available for your iPod touch from a number of sources. Often, if you 
buy a ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù album from iTunes, it will include a music video or two. You can also 
purchase music videos from the iTunes store, and many record companies and 
recording artists make them available for free on their web sites. 
Music videos will automatically get sorted 
into the Music Videos section of your 
Videos app. 
The Music Videos are usually located right 
under TV Shows in the Videos list. The 
controls work just as they do in all other 
video applications. 
 
      
 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
279 
Video Options  
As in your music player, there are a few options 
that you can adjust for the video player. These 
options are accessed through the Settings icon 
from your Home screen. 
Tap the Settings icon, scroll down to tap Video 
to see the available options. 
Here you can also set your Home Sharing 
settings to be able to watch videos that are 
stored on your computer's iTunes library right 
from your iPod touch. 
The Start Playing Option 
Sometimes, you will have to stop watching a 
particular video. This option lets you decide what 
to do the next time you want to watch that video. 
Your options are either to watch the video from the 
beginning or to watch from where you left off. Just 
select the option that you prefer and that will be 
the action your iPod touch takes from now on. 
 
Closed Captioning 
If your video has closed captioning capabilities, setting the Closed Captioning switch to 
ON will let you see closed captioning on your screen. 
Deleting Videos 
To delete a video (to save space on your iPod touch), just scroll up or down and select 
the video to delete.. 
NOTE: If you‚Äôre syncing videos from iTunes, make sure to uncheck the video you‚Äôre deleting from 
there as well; otherwise, iTunes just might sync it right back to your iPod touch on the next sync! 
Just touch and swipe to the right on a video you wish to delete. As when deleting an 
email, a red Delete button will appear in the top-left corner. Touch the Delete button 
and you will be prompted to delete the video. 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
280 
Finally, touch the Delete button and the video will be deleted from your system. 
NOTE: This process deletes the video only from your iPod touch‚Äîa copy will still remain in your 
video library in iTunes, assuming that you have synced with your computer after purchasing the 
video. You can load it back onto your iPod touch at a later time, if you so desire. However, if you 
delete a rented movie from the iPod touch, it will be deleted permanently! 
YouTube on your iPod touch  
Watching YouTube videos is certainly one of the most 
popular things for people to do on their computers these 
days. Now YouTube is as close to you as your iPod touch. 
You can see the YouTube icon on your Home screen. Just 
touch this icon to be taken to the YouTube app. 
 
 
Searching for YouTube Videos 
When you first start YouTube, you usually see 
the Featured videos on YouTube that day. 
Just scroll through the video choices as you do 
in other apps. 
 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
281 
Using the Bottom Icons 
Along the bottom of the YouTube app are five icons: Featured, Most Viewed, Search, 
Favorites, and More. Each option is fairly self-explanatory. 
 
To see the videos that YouTube is featuring that day, touch the Featured icon. To see 
those videos that are most-viewed online, touch the Most Viewed icon. 
After you watch a particular video, you will 
have the option to set it as a favorite on 
YouTube for easy retrieval later. If you have 
set bookmarks, they will appear when you 
tap the Favorites icon. 
 
You can also search the huge library of 
YouTube videos. Tap the Search box (as in 
other apps discussed previously), and the 
keyboard will pop up. Type in a phrase, 
topic, or even the name of a video. 
In this example, I am looking for the newest 
Made Simple Learning video tutorial‚Äîso I 
just type in ‚ÄúMade Simple Learning‚Äù to see a 
list of such videos. 
When I find a video I want to watch, I can 
touch it to see more information. I can even 
rate the video by touching it during playback 
and selecting a rating. 
 
Playing Videos 
Once you have made your choice, tap the video you want to watch. Your iPod touch will 
begin playing the YouTube video in Portrait or Landscape mode. To force Portrait mode, 
just turn the iPod touch so that the screen orientation is vertical. 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos

Video Controls 
Once the video begins to play, the on-screen controls disappear, so you see only the 
video. To stop, pause, or activate any other options while the video is playing, just tap 
the screen. 
The on-screen options are very similar to what you see when watching any other video. 
To fast-forward through the video 
(in Landscape mode), touch and 
hold the Fast-Forward arrow. To 
quickly move in reverse, touch and 
hold the Reverse arrow. To 
advance to the next video in the 
YouTube list, tap the Fast-
Forward/Next arrow. To watch the 
previous video in the list, tap the 
Reverse/Back arrow. 
 
 
To set a video as a favorite, tap 
the leftmost icon: Favorites. 
 
To beam the video to your Apple 
TV, tap the AirPlay button.  
 
 
To Add to Favorites, Email or Tweet 
the video, tap the Share icon and you 
can do any of these options. 

CHAPTER 14:  Viewing Videos 
283 
Checking and Clearing your History 
 
Touch More and then History, and your recently 
viewed videos will appear. 
If you want to clear your history, just touch the 
Clear button in the upper-right corner and confirm 
with the button at the bottom. 
To watch a video from your history, just touch it 
and it will start to play.

                     Chapter 
Safari Web Browser 
Now, we‚Äôll take you through one of the most fun things to do on your iPod touch: surfing 
the Web. You may have heard that web surfing on the iPod touch is a more intimate 
experience than ever before‚Äîand we agree! We‚Äôll show you how to touch, zoom 
around, and interact with the Web like never before with Safari on your iPod touch. 
You‚Äôll learn how to set and use bookmarks, quickly find things with the search engine, 
open and switch between multiple browser windows, and even easily copy text and 
graphics from web pages. 
Web Browsing on the iPod touch 
You can browse the Web to your heart‚Äôs content via Wi-Fi. Like its larger cousin, the 
iPad, your iPod touch has what many feel is the most capable mobile browsing 
experience available today. Web pages look very much like web pages on your 
computer. With the iPod touch‚Äôs ability to zoom in, you don‚Äôt even have to worry about 
the smaller screen size inhibiting your web browsing experience. In short, web browsing 
is a much more satisfying experience on the iPod touch. 
You can choose to browse in Portrait or Landscape mode, depending on your 
preference. Quickly zoom in on a video by double-tapping it or pinching open on it‚Äîthe 
same motions you use to zoom in on text and graphics.

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
286 
Why Do Some Videos and Sites Not Appear? (Flash Player Required) 
 
Some web sites are designed with Adobe Flash Player; but at the time of writing, Apple has 
made the decision not to support this app. If you tap a video and the video does not play‚Äîor you 
see something like ‚ÄúFlash Plugin Required,‚Äù ‚ÄúDownload the Latest Flash Plugin to view this 
video,‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdobe Flash Required to view this site‚Äù‚Äîthen you will not be able to view the video 
or web page. Fortunately, an increasing number of sites are starting to use HTML5 video instead 
of Flash, including YouTube, Vimeo, TED, the New York Times, and Time magazine, all of which 
will play on your iPod touch. 
One way around this limitation: Some alternative browsers on the App Store (e.g., Skyfire) 
render Flash videos on their own servers and send HTML5 video to the iPod touch instead. 
An Internet Connection Is Required 
You do need a live Internet connection on your iPod touch to browse the Web (check 
out Chapter 4: ‚ÄúConnect to the Network‚Äù to learn more). 
Launching the Web Browser 
You should find the Safari (web browser) app on your Home screen. 
Usually, the Safari icon is in the Bottom Dock. 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
287 
Touch the Safari icon and you may be taken to 
the browser‚Äôs Home page. This could be 
Apple‚Äôs iPod touch page. 
Just turn your iPod touch on its side to see the 
same page in the wider Landscape mode. As 
you find web sites you like, you can set 
bookmarks to easily jump to these sites. We will 
show you how to do this later in this chapter.
Layout of the Safari Web Browser Screen 
As you look at your screen, notice that the 
Address bar is in the upper left of the 
screen. This bar displays the current web 
address.  
If you are viewing a web page with suitable 
text content, you will notice the Reader 
button appear in the address bar.  Tap 
Reader to see the web content in an easy-
to-read format.  Check out more on this in 
the "Safari Reader" section in this chapter. 
The Search window is to the right of the 
Address bar. By default, this is set to 
Google search, but you can change it to 
another search engine if you want. 
At the bottom of the screen are five icons: 
Back, Forward, Action, Bookmarks, and 
Pages view. 
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
288 
Typing a Web Address 
The first thing you‚Äôll want to learn is how to get to your favorite web pages. Just like on 
your computer, you type in the web address (URL) into the browser. Follow these steps 
to enter a web address in Safari: 
1.
To start, tap the Address bar at the top of the browser. You see the 
keyboard appear and the window for the Address bar expand. 
2.
If there is already an address in the window and you want to erase it, 
press the 
 at the right end of the bar. 
3.
Start typing your web address (you don‚Äôt need the ‚Äúwww.‚Äù). 
4.
When you start typing, you may see suggestions appear below the 
Address bar; just tap any of those suggestions to go to that page. The 
suggestions are very complete because they are pulled from your 
browsing history, bookmarks, the web address (URL), and web page 
titles. 
5.
Remember the .com key at the bottom of the page. If you press and 
hold it, you will see .edu, .org, and other common domain types. 
6.
When you are finished typing, tap the Go key to go to that page. 
TIP: Don‚Äôt type the ‚Äúwww.‚Äù because it‚Äôs not necessary. Remember to use the colon, forward 
slash, underscore, dot, and .com keys at the bottom to save time. 
TIP: Press and hold the .com key to see all the options: .org, .edu, .net, .de, and so on. 
Moving Backward or Forward Through Open Web Pages 
Now that you know how to enter web addresses, you‚Äôll probably be jumping to various 
web sites. The Forward and Back arrows 
 at the bottom of the screen 
make it very easy to go to recently visited pages in either direction. If the Back arrow is 
grayed out, this chapter‚Äôs ‚ÄúUsing the Open Pages Button‚Äù section can help you figure 
out why. 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
289 
Let‚Äôs say you were looking at the news on the New York Times web site, and you 
jumped to ESPN to check sports scores. To go back to the New York Times page, just 
tap the Back arrow. To return to the ESPN site again, touch the Forward arrow. 
Using the Open Pages Button 
Sometimes, when you click a link, the web page you were viewing moves to the 
background and a new window pops up with new content (e.g., another web page or a 
video). You will see the page you were on move to the background and a new page 
being opened. In such cases, the Back arrow in the new browser window will not work. 
Instead, you have to tap the Open 
Pages icon 
 in the lower-
right corner to see a list of open 
web pages, and then tap the one 
you want. In the example shown 
here, we touched a link that 
opened a new browser window. 
The only way to get back to the 
old one was to tap the Open 
Pages icon and select the desired 
page. 
 
Zooming In and Out in Web Pages 
Zooming in and out of web pages is very easy on the iPod touch. There are two primary 
ways of zooming‚Äîdouble-tapping and pinching. 
Double-tapping 
If you tap twice on a column in a web page, the page will zoom in on that particular 
column. This lets you home in on exactly the right place on the web page, which is very 
helpful for pages that aren‚Äôt formatted for a mobile screen. 
To zoom out, just double-tap once more (you can see how this looks in the ‚ÄúQuick Start 
Guide‚Äù at the beginning of this book). 
Pinching 
This technique lets you zoom in on a particular section of a page. It takes a little bit of 
practice, but it will soon become second nature. Check out the ‚ÄúQuick Start Guide‚Äù to 
see how this looks. 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
290 
Place your thumb and forefinger close together at the section of the web page you wish 
to zoom in on. Slowly pinch out, separating your fingers. You will see the web page 
zoom in. It takes a couple of seconds for the web page to focus, but it will zoom in and 
be very clear in a short while. 
To zoom out to where you were before, just start with your fingers apart and move them 
slowly together; the page will zoom out to its original size. 
Activating Links from Web Pages 
When you‚Äôre surfing the Web, often you‚Äôll come across a link that will take you to 
another web site. Because Safari is a full-function browser, you simply touch the link to 
jump to a new page. 
Working with Safari Bookmarks 
As soon as you start browsing a bit on your iPod touch, you will want to quickly access 
your favorite web sites. One good way to do this is to add bookmarks for one-tap 
access to web sites. 
TIP: You can sync your bookmarks from your computer‚Äôs web browser (Safari or Internet 
Explorer only) using iCloud over the air or the iTunes app on your computer. Check out Chapter 
3: ‚ÄúSync with iCloud, iTunes and More‚Äù for more details. 
Adding a New Bookmark 
Adding new bookmarks on your iPod touch takes just a few taps: 
1. To add a new bookmark for the web page you are currently viewing, tap 
the Action button 
 at the bottom of the screen. 
2. Choose Add Bookmark.
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
291 
3. We recommend that you edit the 
bookmark name to something short and 
recognizable. 
4. Tap Bookmarks if you want to change 
the folder where your bookmark is stored. 
5. When you‚Äôre finished, tap the Save 
button.
 
Using Bookmarks and History 
Once you have set a few bookmarks, it is easy to view and work with them. In the same 
area, you can also see and use your web browsing history. A very useful tool on your 
iPod touch is the ability to browse the web from your History, just as you would on a 
computer. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Tap the Bookmarks icon 
 at the 
bottom of the page.
2. Swipe up or down to view all your 
bookmarks. 
3. Tap any bookmark to jump to that 
web page. 
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
292 
4. Tap the History folder to 
view your recent history of 
visited web pages.
5. Notice that, at the bottom of the list, 
you see additional folders for Earlier 
Today and previous days. 
6. Tap any history item to go to that web 
page. 
TIP: To clear your history, tap the Clear 
button in the lower-left corner. You can also 
clear your history, cookies, and cache in the 
Settings app. Tap Settings; tap Safari; 
scroll to the bottom; and then tap Clear 
History, Clear Cookies, or Clear Cache. 
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
293 
Managing Your Bookmarks 
It is very easy to accumulate quite a collection of bookmarks because setting them up is 
so easy. However, you may find you no longer need a particular bookmark, or you may 
want to organize them by adding new folders. 
As with other lists on your iPod touch, you can reorder your Bookmarks list and remove 
entries. Follow these steps to do so: 
1. View your Bookmarks list as you did 
previously. 
2. Tap the Edit button in the lower-left 
corner. 
3. To reorder the entries, touch and drag the 
right edge with the three gray bars up or 
down the list. In this case, we are 
dragging the bookmark to the iPad Made 
Simple book page on Amazon.com up to 
the top. 
4. To create a new folder for bookmarks, 
tap the New Folder button in the lower-
right corner. 
5. To delete a bookmark, tap the red Circle 
icon to the left of the entry to make it turn 
vertical. 
6. Tap the Delete button. 
7. When you are finished reordering and 
deleting entries, tap the Done button in 
the upper-left corner. 
8. To edit a bookmark name, folder, or web 
address, tap the bookmark name itself. 
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
294 
9. Now you can make any adjustments to 
the name, web address, or folder. 
10. To change the folder where the bookmark 
is stored, tap the button below the web 
address. In this image, it says 
Bookmarks; but on your iPod touch, it 
may be different. This bookmark points to 
the iPad Made Simple page on 
Amazon.com. 
11. Tap Done when you‚Äôre finished. 
 
 
 
Reading List 
Reading List is a special type of bookmark that lets you quickly save a web article, so 
you can read it later at your leisure. The Reading List feature can sync via iCloud, so it‚Äôs 
a great way to quickly mark articles on Safari on your home or work Mac or Windows 
PC to read on your iPod touch or iPad while traveling. You can also use this feature to 
save a bookmark on your iPod touch to read more comfortably when you get back to 
your iPad or PC. 
Follow these steps to use the Reading List feature: 
1. Go to the article you want to save in Safari. 
2. Tap the Action button 
 at the bottom middle of the page. 
3. Tap Add to Reading List. 
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
295 
Follow these steps to view a Reading List article later: 
1. Tap the Bookmark button 
 at the 
bottom right of the page. 
2. Tap the Glasses icon for the 
Reading List option. (If you don‚Äôt 
see the Glasses icon, you might be 
inside a Bookmarks folder. Just tap 
the Arrow icon at the top left to back 
out of the folder or folders you‚Äôre in 
until the Arrow disappears, and you 
can see the Glasses icon.) 
 
3. To see everything in your Reading 
List, tap the All tab at the top left. 
To see only the articles you haven‚Äôt 
read yet, tap the Unread tab at the 
top right. 
4. Tap the article you want to read. 
 
 
Finally, follow these steps to delete an 
article from Reading List: 
1. Swipe from left to right across the 
article you‚Äôd like to remove from 
Reading List. 
2. Tap the red Delete button. 
 
Safari Reader 
Safari‚Äôs Reader feature allows you to enjoy an article on the web as a clean, clear page 
of nicely sized text, without the distraction of busy layouts or ads. 
NOTE: While Safari does an excellent job detecting most web page articles because of the white 
variety of content and formatting, it might occasionally miss one. If you don‚Äôt see the Reader 
button, it means Safari couldn‚Äôt detect the article. 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
296 
Follow these steps to activate this feature: 
1. Go to the article you want to read. 
2. Tap the Reader button on the right side of the 
URL field, see Figure 16-1. 
 
3. Tap the Font Size button to make the type 
bigger or smaller. 
 
 
  
  
 
Figure 15-1. The same web page in standard view (left image) and Reader View (right two images). 
TIP: If you find yourself wishing you could get the functionality of both Reading List and 
Reader‚Äîalong with other features like browser access, social sharing, and more‚Äîthen check 
out App Store apps like Instapaper. 
Safari Browsing Tips and Tricks 
Now that you know the basics of how to get around, we will cover a few useful tips and 
tricks for making web browsing more enjoyable and faster on your iPod touch. 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
297 
Jumping to the Top of the Web Page 
Sometimes, web pages can be quite long, which can make scrolling back to the top of 
the page a bit laborious. One easy trick is to tap the gray title bar of the web page; you‚Äôll 
automatically jump to the top of the page. 
Emailing or Tweeting a Web Page 
Sometimes while browsing, you find a page so compelling you just have to share it with 
a friend or colleague. Tap the Action button 
 in the middle of the bottom bar, and 
then select Mail Link to this Page to create an email message with a link that you can 
send. Select Tweet to create a new Twitter message with a link you can share, as 
shown in Figure 15-2. 
 
 
 
Figure 15‚Äì2. Using the Action button to do various functions with a Safari web page. 
Printing a Web Page 
With the iPod touch, you can easily print any web page you come across to any AirPrint 
compatible printer over your local Wi-Fi network. Tap the Action button 
 and then 
select Print.  

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
298 
Watching Videos in Safari 
You will often see videos on web sites. And you will be able to play many‚Äîbut not all‚Äî
of these videos. For example, videos formatted with Adobe Flash will not be playable 
on your iPod touch (see our note at the beginning of this chapter). 
When you tap the Play button, you will be taken 
out of Safari into the iPod video player. 
You can then turn your iPod touch on its side to 
view the video in Landscape, or wide-screen, 
mode. 
Tap the screen to bring up the player controls if 
they have disappeared. 
When you are finished watching the video and 
want to return to the web page, tap the Done
button in the upper-left corner. 
TIP: Check out the video player tips and tricks 
in Chapter 14: ‚ÄúViewing Videos.‚Äù 
Saving or Copying Text and Graphics 
From time to time, you may see text or a graphic you want to copy from a web site. We 
tell you briefly how to do this in this section; however, to see how to get this done in 
more depth, including how to use the Cut and Paste functions, please see the ‚ÄúCopy 
and Paste‚Äù section in Chapter 2: ‚ÄúTyping, Copy and Search.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a quick synopsis of 
how to copy text or a graphic from a web page: 

To copy a single word, touch and hold the word until you see it 
highlighted and the Copy button appears. Next, tap Copy. 

To copy a few words or entire paragraph, touch and hold a word until 
it is highlighted. Next, drag the blue dots left or right to select more 
text. You can flick up or down to select an entire paragraph. Finally, 
tap Copy. 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
299 
TIP: Selecting a single word puts the copy feature in word-selection mode, where you can drag 
to increase or decrease the number of words selected. If you go past a single paragraph, it will 
typically switch to element-selection mode where, instead of corners, you get edges that you can 
drag out to select multiple paragraphs, images, and so on. 
 To save or copy a graphic, touch and hold the picture or image until 
you see the pop-up asking if you would like to save or copy the image. 
Saving Time with AutoFill 
The AutoFill feature gives you a great way to save time typing your personal information, 
including usernames and passwords on web sites. The AutoFill tool can remember and 
fill in information required in web forms. You will save a lot of time by enabling AutoFill. 
Check out the steps we show you later in this chapter in the ‚ÄúEnabling AutoFill‚Äù section 
to set up AutoFill to work on your iPod touch. 
Once you enable the AutoFill option, just go to any web page that has a field to fill out. 
As soon as you touch the field, the keyboard will come up at the bottom of the screen. 
At the top of the keyboard, you will see a small button that says AutoFill. Touch it and 
the web form should be filled out automatically. 
CAUTION: Having your name and password entered automatically means that anyone who picks 
up your iPod touch will be able to access your personal sites and information. You may want to 
enable passcode security, as explained in Chapter : ‚ÄúPersonalize and Secure.‚Äù 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
300 
Entering Usernames and Passwords 
The first time you go to a web site where 
you have to enter a username and 
password, type them in and press Submit 
or Enter. At that time, AutoFill will ask if 
you want your iPod touch to remember 
them. 
Tap Yes if you want them to be 
remembered and automatically entered the 
next time you visit the site. 
 
 
The next time you visit this login page, 
your username and password will be 
automatically filled in. 
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
301 
For Personal Information 
There are many times on the Web where you have to enter your name, email address, 
home address, and more. With AutoFill set up and tied to your contact record on the 
iPod touch, filling in these forms just takes a single tap of your finger. 
You will go to many sites with web forms 
that need to be completed. For example, 
check out this example of a web form on 
www.madesimplelearning.com for free iPod 
touch tips. It would take a while to 
manually type your email address, first 
name, and last name. 
 
As soon as you tap the first field‚ÄîEmail, 
in this case‚Äîyou see the AutoFill bar 
appear just above your keyboard. 
Tap the AutoFill button, and your email 
address and name are immediately filled in 
from your contact record. 
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
302 
Adding a Web Page Icon to Your Home Screen 
If you love a web site or page, it‚Äôs very easy to add it as an icon to your Home screen. 
That way, you can instantly access the web page without going through Safari‚Äôs 
bookmark selection process. You‚Äôll save lots of steps by putting the icon on your Home 
screen. This is especially good for quickly launching web apps (e.g., Gmail from Google 
or web-based games). 
Follow these steps to add a web app‚Äôs 
icon: 
1. Tap the Action button 
 at the 
bottom of the browser. 
2. Tap Add to Home Screen. 
3. Adjust the name to shorten it to ten 
or fewer characters; you should do 
this because there‚Äôs not much room 
for the icon‚Äôs name on your Home 
screen. 
4. Tap the Add button in the upper-
right corner. 
 
 
 
Adjusting the Safari Browser Settings 
As with other settings we‚Äôve adjusted so 
far, the settings for Safari are found in the 
Settings app.  
1. To access settings for Safari, tap 
the Settings icon.
2. Tap Safari.
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
303 
Changing the Search Engine  
By default, the search engine for the Safari 
browser is Google. To change this to Yahoo or 
Bing, touch the Search Engine button and then 
choose the new search engine. 
 
 
Enabling AutoFill 
As we showed you earlier in this chapter, AutoFill is a convenient way to have Safari 
automatically fill out web page forms that ask for your name, address, phone number, or 
even username and password. It can save you a tremendous amount of time typing and 
retyping your name and other information. 
To enable the AutoFill option, follow these steps: 
1. From the Safari menu in the Settings 
app, tap AutoFill. 
 
2. Set the switch next to Names & 
Passwords to ON. 
3. Set the switch next to Use Contact 
Info to ON. 
 
 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
304 
4. After setting Use Contact Info to ON, 
you will be brought to your Contacts 
list to select a contact to use. 
5. Swipe up and down to find someone 
or double-tap the top bar that says 
Contacts to bring up the Search 
window. 
6. Once you find the contact you want to 
use, tap it to be returned to Safari‚Äôs 
Settings screen. 
 
 
Adjusting Privacy Options 
Turning on the Private Browsing option 
means that no information, history, or 
cookies will be stored when you visit web 
sites. If you‚Äôre concerned about other 
people knowing which web sites you visit or 
about the web sites you visit tracking you, 
then you should toggle Private Browing to 
the ON position. 
You can also Clear History and Clear 
Cookies and Data options. 
TIP: If you notice your web browsing get slow or sluggish‚Äîor if Safari is crashing on you 
frequently‚Äîthen try clearing both your History and Cookies and Data by tapping them and 
confirming your choices. 

CHAPTER 15:  Safari Web Browser 
305 
Adjusting Security Options 
Under the Security heading, the Fraud 
Warning, JavaScript, and Block Pop-ups 
options should be set to ON by default. 
You can modify any of these settings by 
sliding a given switch to OFF. 
NOTE: Many popular sites like Facebook 
require JavaScript to be ON. 
 
Tap the Accept Cookies button to 
adjust your browser‚Äôs ability to accept 
cookies to Always, Never, or From 
visited. We recommend keeping it as 
From visited. If you make it Never, 
some web sites will not work properly.

                      Chapter 
Communicate with Email 
In this chapter, we will explore the world of email in the Mail 
app on your iPod touch. You will learn how to set up multiple 
email accounts, check out all the various reading options, open 
attachments, and clean up your inbox. 
 
 
And for cases when your email is not working quite right, you will learn some good 
troubleshooting tips to help you get back up and running. 
Getting Started with Mail 
Setting up email on your iPod touch is fairly simple. Probably the fastest way to get your 
email up and running is to set up your accounts directly on the iPod touch. We show you 
how using the Mail, Contacts and Calendar account setup screens in this section. You 
could also copy these account settings using a screen in the iTunes app on your 
computer. You do need a network connection to get email up and running. 
A Network Connection Is Required 
Mobile email is certainly all the rage today. You can view, read, and compose replies to 
emails already synced to your iPod touch without a network connection; however, you will 
need to have network connectivity to send and/or receive email from your iPod touch. 
Check out Chapter 4: ‚ÄúConnect to the Network‚Äù to learn more. Also, check out the 
‚ÄúReading the Top Connectivity Status Icons‚Äù section in the Quick Start Guide in Part I. 
16 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
308 
TIP: If you are taking a trip, simply download all your email before you get on the airplane; this 
lets you read, reply, and compose your messages while offline. All emails will be sent after you 
land and re-establish your connection to the Internet. 
Setting up Email on the iPod touch 
As mentioned a moment ago, you have two options for setting up your email accounts 
on the iPod touch: 
1. Set up your email accounts directly on the iPod touch. 
2. Use iTunes to sync email account settings. 
The first option, setting up your email accounts directly on the iPod touch, works best if 
you want a special setup on your iPod touch, such as Gmail over Exchange. This is also 
a good approach if you don‚Äôt use an email program on your Windows or Mac PC. 
If you have a lot of POP3 or IMAP accounts already set up on your Windows or Mac 
computer, you can also choose to sync them over your USB dock cable via iTunes. 
Entering Passwords for Email Accounts 
In Chapter 3, we showed you how to sync your email account settings to your iPod 
touch. After this sync completes, you should be able to view all of the email accounts on 
your iPod touch by opening the Settings app. All you will need to do is enter the 
password for each account. 
To enter your password for each synced email account, follow these steps: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Tap the Mail, Contacts, and Calendars option. 
3. Under Accounts, you should see all your synced email accounts listed. 
4. Tap any listed email account, type its password, and click Done. 
5. If all the information is entered correctly, checkmarks will appear and 
you‚Äôre account will be enabled. 
6. Repeat for all listed email accounts.

Adding a New Email Account on the iPod touch 
To add a new email account on your iPod touch, follow
these steps: 
1.
Tap the Settings icon. 
2.
Tap the Mail, Contacts, and 
Calendars option. 
3.
Tap Add Account below your email 
accounts. 
If you have no accounts set up, you will only see 
the Add Account option. 
TIP: To edit any email account, just touch that account. 
4.
Choose which type of email account to 
add on this screen: 

Choose iCloud if you use this service. 

Choose Microsoft Exchange if you use 
a Microsoft Exchange email server. 

You should also choose Microsoft 
Exchange if you use Google Calendar 
and Google Contacts to store your 
personal information, and you want to 
wirelessly sync them to your iPod touch. 
NOTE: We show you how to set up both Google/Microsoft 
Exchange and iCloud in Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync with iCloud, 
iTunes and More.‚Äù 

Choose Gmail if you use Google for your 
email, but you do not (or do not want to) 
wirelessly sync email with your Google 
Contacts. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
310 
 Choose Yahoo!, AOL, or WindowsLive 
Hotmail if you use those services. 
 Choose Other if none of the above apply, 
and you want to sync a standard POP or 
IMAP email account. Finally, choose Add 
Mail Account from the next screen. 
5. Type your name as you would like others to see 
it when they receive mail from you into the 
Name field. 
6. Next, add the appropriate information into the 
Address, Password, and Description fields. 
7. Tap the Next button in the upper-right corner. 
Specifying Incoming and Outgoing Servers 
Sometimes, the iPod touch will not be able to automatically set up your email account. 
In these cases, you will need to type in a few more settings manually to enable your 
email account. 
TIP: You may be able to find the settings for your email provider by doing a web search for your 
email provider‚Äôs name and email settings. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
311 
If the iPod touch is unable to log into your server 
with only your email address and password, then 
you will see a screen similar to this one. 
Under Incoming Mail Server, type the appropriate 
information into the Host Name, User Name, and 
Password fields. Usually, your incoming mail server 
is something like mail.name_of_your_isp.com. 
To adjust the name of your outgoing server, tap 
Outgoing Mail Server. You can adjust the outgoing 
mail server on the following screen. These server 
names usually look like either 
smtp.name_of_your_isp.com or 
mail.name_of_your_isp.com. 
You can try to leave the Server Name and 
Password fields blank. If that doesn‚Äôt work, you can 
always go back and change them. 
 
 
You may be asked if you want to use SSL (secure socket layer), a type of outgoing mail 
security that may be required by your email provider. If you don‚Äôt know whether you 
need SSL, just check the mail settings with your email provider. 
TIP: The authors recommend that you use SSL security whenever possible. If you do not use 
SSL, then your login credentials, messages, and any private information are sent in plain text 
(unencrypted), leaving them open to snoopers. 
Verifying that Your Account Is Set Up 
Once all the information is entered, the iPod touch 
will attempt to configure your email account. You 
may get an error message; if that happens, you 
need to review the information you input.

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
312 
If you are taken to the screen that shows all your 
email accounts, look for the new account name. 
If you see it, your account was set up correctly.
 
Fixing the Cannot Get Mail Error 
You will need to enter your password if 
you tap Mail icon and you receive an error 
that says ‚ÄúCannot Get Mail‚ÄîNo password 
provided for (your account).‚Äù 
Review this chapter‚Äôs ‚ÄúEnter Passwords 
for E-Mail Accounts Synced from iTunes‚Äù 
section for help with this issue. 
 
 
The Mailboxes Screen‚ÄîInboxes and Accounts 
The top-level screen is your Mailboxes screen. You can always get to it by tapping the 
button in the upper-left corner. Keep tapping this upper-left button until you see no 
more buttons. When that happens, you are in the Mailboxes screen. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
313 
From the Mailboxes screen, you can access 
the following items: 
 The unified inbox: Access this by 
tapping All inboxes. 
 The inbox for each individual 
account: Access this by tapping that 
email account name in the Inboxes 
section. 
 
 
 The folders for each email account 
in the Accounts section: Access 
these by tapping the account name to 
see all folders. 
 
 
Adding or Editing Email Folders or Mailboxes 
With iOS 5, you can now add or edit email folders right on your iPod touch if you are 
using an iCloud-synced mail account or your mail server supports this feature.  Say, you 
wanted to change a mail folder name or add a new mail folder to better organize your 
messages inbox.  One example might be to create a new folder called "Requires 
Attention" and put all those emails that you cannot get to right now, but need to make 
sure you address later when you back at your desk.  To add or edit a mailbox on your 
device, follow these steps: 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
314 
1. From the Mailboxes screen scroll 
to the bottom and tap any of your 
email accounts listed under 
Accounts. 
 
2. In this example, we will edit the 
iCloud account mailboxes.  On this 
screen tap Edit in the upper right. 
 
3. Then, you can do the following: 
 Tap the New Mailbox at 
the bottom to create a 
new mailbox. 
 Tap any mailbox folder 
to edit the name or 
delete it. 
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
315 
Inbox, Flagged (Marked) and Threaded Messages 
You will notice that any unread 
messages are marked with a 
blue dot 
 to the left of the 
message. 
You will also notice that some 
messages show a number and a 
right-facing arrow (>) to the right 
of the message, like this: 
. 
This shows that there are three  
related messages (replies and 
forwards) to the message 
shown. 
 
Messages that are marked have a little flag to the left of them like this: 
 
Tap any message to open it. The only time it will not open is if there are related 
messages. In that case, you will first see a screen with all the related messages. Tap any 
of those messages to open and view it. 
To leave the Inbox view, tap the button in the upper-left corner. 
You can tell which email account you are viewing by looking at the button in the upper-
left corner: 
 If the button says Mailboxes, you know you are looking at all your 
inboxes together. 
 If the button says an account name, such as iCloud or Exchange, 
then you know you are only looking at the inbox for that account. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
316 
Move, Delete, or Mark (Flag)Multiple Messages 
If you want to move or delete several messages at 
once, you can do so from the Inbox screen.  
Follow these steps to delete multiple messages at 
once: 
1. Tap the Edit button in the upper-right 
corner while you are viewing an Inbox 
screen. 
2. Tap to select the desired messages; a red 
Checkmark icon next to a message 
indicates it is selected. 
3. To delete the messages, tap the Delete 
button at the bottom. 
4. To move the messages to another folder, 
tap the Move button and select the folder. 
5. To Mark a message with a Flag or as 
Unread, tap the Mark button. Unread will 
put the blue dot back next to the message.  
If you flag a message you will see a little 
flag appear next to it like this: 
 
 
Viewing an Individual Message 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
317 
When you tap a message from the Inbox screen, you see the Main message view. You 
can look at messages in both portrait and landscape modes, see Figure 16‚Äì1. Portrait 
mode will typically display more text. Landscape mode will typically let you enjoy bigger 
text and images. 
  
 
Figure 16‚Äì1. Viewing email messages in portrait and landscape modes. 
TIP: If you are setting your iPod touch down on a desk or holding it in your lap, then you may 
want to use the Portrait Lock icon to lock your view in Portrait (vertical) mode. This will prevent 
the image from flipping around unnecessarily. To lock the view, follow these steps: 
1.  Double-tap the Home button and swipe left to right. 
2.  Tap the Portrait Lock button to lock the screen in Portrait mode. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
318 
Composing and Sending Emails 
To launch the email program, tap the Mail icon on your Home screen. 
TIP: If you left the Mail app while viewing a particular email, list of folders, or an account, then 
you will be returned directly to that same location when you return to the Mail app. 
If you are going into your email for the first time, you may see an empty inbox. Hit the 
Refresh button 
 in the lower-left corner of the window to retrieve the latest email. 
The iPod touch will begin to check for new mail and then display the number of new 
messages for each account. 
Composing a New Email Message 
When you start the Mail program, your first 
screen should be your Accounts screen. At 
the bottom-right corner of the screen, you 
will see the Compose icon. Touch the 
Compose icon to start creating a new 
message. 
 
Addressing Your Message‚ÄîChoose the Recipients 
You have a few options for selecting 
recipients, depending on whether the 
person is in your Contacts list on your 
iPod touch: 
Option 1: Type a few letters of someone‚Äôs 
first name; hit the Space key, and then 
type a few letters of that person‚Äôs last 
name. The person‚Äôs name should appear 
in the list; tap that person‚Äôs name to select 
that contact. 
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
319 
Option 2: Type an email address. Notice 
the @ and Period (.) keys on the bottom, 
which help your typing. 
TIP: Press and hold the period key to see 
.com, .edu, .org, and other email domain 
name suffixes. 
Option 3: Hit the Plus Sign (+)
 to 
view your entire Contacts list and search 
or select a name from it. 
If you want to use a different contact 
group, tap the Groups button in the upper-
left corner. 
Double-tap Contacts at the top of the 
screen to see the Search window. Next, 
type a few letters to search for your 
contact.  
Deleting a Recipient 
If you need to delete a name from the recipient list (To:, Cc:, or Bcc:), tap the name to 
select it 
and hit the Backspace key.  
 
TIP: If you want to delete the last recipient you typed (and the cursor is sitting next to that name), 
hit the Delete key once to highlight the name and hit it a second time to delete it.

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
320 
Adding a CC or BCC Recipient 
  To add a carbon copy (Cc:) 
or blind carbon copy (Bcc:) recipient, you 
need to tap the Cc: or Bcc: field just under 
the To: field at the top of the email 
message. Doing so opens up the tapped 
field. 
 
Moving Recipients 
If you originally add a recipient as the To: 
field, but change your mind and decide 
you‚Äôd rather add her to a Cc: or Bcc: field 
(or vice versa), then simply tap and hold 
the recipient‚Äôs name and drag it to the 
preferred field. 
 
 
 
Changing the Email Account to Send From 
If you have more than one email account set up, 
the iPod touch will use whichever account is set 
as the default account. (This is set in Settings > 
Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Default Account 
at the bottom of the Mail section.) 
Follow these steps to change the email account 
you send from: 
1. Tap an email‚Äôs From: field to highlight it. 
2. Tap the From: field again to see a list of 
your accounts in a scroll wheel at the 
bottom of the screen. 
3. Scroll up or down, and then tap a new 
email account to select it. 
4. Tap the Subject field to finish changing 
the email address you send from. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
321 
Typing Your Subject 
Now you need to enter a subject for your email. 
Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Touch the Subject: line and enter text 
for the Subject: field of the email. 
2. Press the Return key or tap the Body 
section of the email to move the cursor 
to the Body section. 
 
Typing Your Message 
Now that the cursor is in the Body section of the email (under the subject line), you can 
start typing your email message. 
CAUTION: There is only one email signature on your iPod touch, which gets automatically 
applied to each message you send from your iPod touch‚Äîeven if you have multiple email 
accounts set up. So, be careful if you are running two different businesses or don‚Äôt want your 
personal email signature to go to all your business contacts. It‚Äôs probably best to make your 
email signature fairly generic. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
322 
Formatting Text, Defining Words, Quoting Text and More 
You can tap any text to highlight it, use the blue 
handles to expand the selection.  Then using the 
popup menu above the selection, you can do any 
of the following: 
 Tap Cut, Copy or Paste to perform 
those functions. 
 Tap Suggest if the word is underlined 
and you want to correct the spelling. 
 Tap the triangle at the right edge to 
see more options. 
 
 Tap B / U to adjust formatting to Bold,

The default email signature is shown in the image to the right: Sent from my iPod 
touch. 
TIP: You can change this signature to be anything you want; see the ‚ÄúChanging Your E-Mail 
Signature‚Äù section later in this chapter to learn how to change your e-mail signature. 
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
323 
Keyboard Options 
While you are typing, remember you have two keyboard options: the smaller Portrait 
(vertical) keyboard and the larger Landscape (horizontal) keyboard, see Figure 17-2. 
    
 
Figure 16‚Äì2.  Turn your device on its side to get the larger landscape keyboard.  
TIP: If you have larger hands, it might be easier to type when the keyboard is larger. Once you get 
the hang of typing on the larger keyboard with two hands, you will find that it is much faster than 
typing with one finger. See Chapter 2: ‚ÄúTypingCopyand Search‚Äù for more typing tips. 
Auto-Correction and Auto-Capitalization 
As you type, you will notice that some words will be auto-capitalized and automatically 
corrected. Red underlined words are flagged as misspelled by the spelling checker. See 
Chapter 2: ‚ÄúTyping, Copy and Search‚Äù to learn how these all functions work; this 
chapter also provides some additional typing tips. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
324 
Send Your Email 
Once you have typed your message, tap the blue Send button in the top-
right corner. 
Your email will be sent, and you should hear the iPod touch‚Äôs sent mail 
sound, which confirms that your email was sent. You can learn how to 
enable or disable this sound in the ‚ÄúAdjusting Sounds on your iPod 
touch‚Äù section of Chapter 8: ‚ÄúPersonalize and Secure.‚Äù

earlier. 
2. Press the Cancel button in the upper-
left corner. 
3. Select the Save Draft button at the 
bottom of the screen. 
 
 
Later, when you want to locate and send your draft message, follow these steps: 
1. Open the Drafts folder in the email account from which you composed 
this message. See the ‚ÄúMoving Around in Mail Folders‚Äù section earlier in 
this chapter for help getting into the Drafts folder. 
2. Tap the email message in the Drafts folder to open it. 
3. Tap anywhere in the message to edit it. 
4. Tap the Send button. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
325 
Checking Sent Messages 
Follow these steps to confirm that the email was sent 
correctly: 
1. Tap the Email account name button 
in the upper-left corner to see the mail 
folders for the account you just used to 
send your message. 
2. Tap the Sent folder. 
3. Verify that that the top email you see in 
the list is the one you just composed 
and sent. 
 
 
NOTE: You will only see the Sent and Trash folders if you have actually sent or deleted email 
from that account on the iPod touch. If your email account is an IMAP account, you may see 
many folders other than those described in this chapter. 
Reading and Replying to Mail 
Follow these steps to read your email: 
1. Navigate to the inbox of the email account you want to view using the 
steps described earlier in this chapter. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
326

message. 
4. Flick your finger up or 
down in the inbox to 
scroll through your 
messages. 
5. When you are reading a 
message, swipe up or 
down to scroll through it. 
 
Marking Messages as Unread or Flagged 
If you read a message but want to make sure you 
can quickly find it again later, you can choose to 
click either Mark as Unread or Flag, so it gets your 
attention later. 
Follow these steps to Mark a message: 
1. Tap the word Mark located to the right of 
the time and date. 
2. Choose Flag or Mark as Unread from the 
slide up menu. 
A message you Flag will have a small red Flag icon 
to the left of the Mark text. A message you Mark as

Mark text. 
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
327 
To Unmark a message:  
1. Tap the word Mark located to the right of the 
time and date 
2. Choose Unflag or Mark as Read from the 
slide up menu. 
 
 
Zooming In or Out 
As when browsing the Web, you can zoom in to see your email in larger text. You can 
also double-tap, just as you do on the Web; and you can also Pinch to zoom in or out 
(see the ‚ÄúZooming‚Äù section in the Quick Start Guide in Part 1 of this book for more 
information on these features). 
Email Attachments 
Some email attachments are opened automatically by the iPod touch, so you don‚Äôt even 
notice that they were attachments. Examples of these include Adobe‚Äôs portable 
document format (PDF) files (used by Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader, among other 
apps) and some types of image, video, and audio files. You may also receive documents 
as attachments, such as Apple‚Äôs Pages, Numbers, and Keynote files; or Microsoft‚Äôs 
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. You will need to open these manually. 
Knowing When You Have an Attachment 
Any email with an attachment will have a 
little Paperclip icon next to the sender‚Äôs 
name, as shown to the right. When you 
see that icon, you know you have an 
attachment. 
 
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
328 
Receiving an Auto-Open Attachment 
Some types of email attachments, like 
images, Quicktime movies, and single-
page PDF files are usually opened and 
displayed and displayed for you inline in 
the mail message.  
 
TIP: If you want to save or copy an auto-opened attachment, simply press and hold it until you 
see the pop-up window. At this point, you can select Copy or Save Image. When you save an 
image, it will be placed in your Photos app in the Camera Roll album. 
Opening Email Attachments 
Instead of immediately opening in the body of the email as we just described, other 
types of attachments‚Äîsuch as spreadsheets, word processing documents, and 
presentation files‚Äîwill need to be opened manually. 
Tap for Quick Look Mode 
Follow these steps to open attachments in Quick Look mode: 
1. Open the message with an attachment, as shown in Figure 16‚Äì3. 
2. Quickly tap the attachment to instantly open it in Quick Look mode. 
3. You can navigate around the document. Remember you can zoom in or 
out and swipe up or down.

see tabs across the top. Touch another tab to open that spreadsheet. 
5.
When you are done looking at the attachment, tap the document once 
to bring up the controls, and then tap Done in the upper-left corner. 
6.
If you have apps installed that can open the type of attachment you are 
viewing (in this case, a spreadsheet), then you will see an Open In
button in the upper-right corner. Tap the Open In button to open this file 
in another app. 
    
Figure 16‚Äì3. Viewing email attachments in Quick Look mode. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
330 
Opening Docs in Other Apps 
You may want to open an attachment in another application. For example, you might 
want to open a spreadsheet in Numbers, a PDF file in iBooks, Stanza, or GoodReader. 
Follow these steps to do so: 
1. Open the email message. 
2. Press and hold the 
attachment until you see 
the pop-up window. 
3. Select the Open In‚Ä¶ or 
Open in "Numbers" 
option.  You may see 
specific apps listed after 
Open In as Numbers is 
shown here when the 
format of the attachment 
matches apps on your 
device. 
 
 
4. Select the application you 
would like to use from the 
list. 
5. Finally, you can edit the 
document, save it, and 
email it back to the 
sender. 
 
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
331 
Viewing a Video Attachment 
You may receive a video as an attachment to an email. Certain types of videos can be 
viewed on your iPod touch (see the ‚ÄúSupported E-Mail Attachment Types‚Äù section later 
in this chapter for a list of supported video formats). Follow these steps to open a video

book‚Äôs authors) that shows you how to 
use your iPod touch. Check out some free 
sample tutorials at 
www.madesimplelearning.com, 
Martin's web site. 
 
Opening and Viewing Compressed .zip Files 
Your iPod touch will not be able to open and view a compressed file in .zip format 
unless you install an app such as GoodReader. At the time of publishing, GoodReader 
was still a free app and well worth installing. 
TIP: Learn how to install and use GoodReader it in Chapter 1: ‚ÄúNewsstandand More.‚Äù 
Follow these steps to open a .zip file in the program: 
1. Install the free GoodReader app from the App Store. 
2. Open up the email message with the .zip file attachment. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
332 
3. Touch and hold the .zip attachment 
until you see a pop-up at the bottom 
with a button that says: Open in 
"GoodReader." Tap that button to 
open the .zip file in GoodReader. 
 
 
4. GoodReader should now open, and 
your .zip file should be at the top of 
the list of files. To open or 
decompress the .zip file, tap it and 
select the Unzip button. 
 
 
5. Now you should see the 
uncompressed file‚Äîin this case, an 
Adobe .pdf file in the list of files 
above the .zip file. 
6. Tap that uncompressed file to view it. 
 
7. When you are done reading the attachment, double-click your Home 
button and tap the Mail icon to return to your reading your email. 
Supported Email Attachment Types 
Your iPod touch supports the following file types as attachments: 
 .doc and .docx (Microsoft Word documents) 
 .htm and .html (web pages) 
 .key (a Keynote presentation document) 
 .numbers (an Apple Numbers spreadsheet document) 
 .pages (an Apple Pages document) 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
333 
 .pdf (Adobe‚Äôs portable document format, used by programs such as 
Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader) 
 .ppt and .pptx (Microsoft PowerPoint presentation documents) 
 .txt (a text file) 
 .vcf (a contact file) 
 .xls and .xlsx (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet documents) 
 .mp3 and .mov (audio and video formats) 
 .zip (compressed files): These are only readable if you have an app 
installed that can read them, such as GoodReader‚Äîsee the ‚ÄúOpening 
and Viewing Compressed .zip Files‚Äù section earlier in this chapter. 
Replying, Forwarding, or Deleting a Message 
At the bottom of your email 
reading pane is a toolbar. 
From this toolbar, you can move 
the message to a different mailbox 
or folder; delete it; or reply, reply 
all, or forward it.
 
 
Touch the small Arrow icon 
 to 
see these option buttons appear: Reply, 
Reply All, and Forward. 
NOTE: The Reply All button appears only 
if there was more than one recipient for 
the email message.
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
334 
Replying to an Email 
You will probably use the Reply command most frequently. Follow these steps to 
respond to an email on your iPod touch: 
1. Touch the Reply button. 
You will see that the original sender is 
now listed as the recipient in the To: 
line of the email. The subject will 
automatically state: ‚ÄúRe: (Original 
subject line).‚Äù 
2. Type your response. 
3. When you are done, just 
touch the blue Send button at 
the top-right corner of the 
screen. 
 
Using Reply All 
Using the Reply All option is just like using the Reply function, except that all of the 
original recipients of the email and the original sender are placed in the address lines. 
The original sender will be in the To: line, while all other recipients of the original email 
will be listed on the Cc: line. You will only see the Reply All option if more than one 
person received the original email. 
CAUTION: Be careful when you use Reply All. This can be dangerous if some of the recipients 
are not shown on the original email because they stretch off the edge of the screen. If you do use 
Reply All, then make sure you check the To: and Cc: lists to make sure everyone should be 
receiving your reply. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email

Using the Forward Button 
Sometimes, you get an email that you want to send to someone else. The Forward 
command will let you do that (see the ‚ÄúE-Mail Attachments‚Äù section in this chapter for 
more about working with attachments). 
NOTE: You need to forward attachments to send them to others. If you want to send someone an 
attachment from an email you receive, you must choose the Forward option. (Note that choosing 
the Reply and Reply All options will not include the original email attachment(s) in your outgoing 
message.) 
When you touch the Forward button, you may be prompted to address whether you 
want to Include or Don‚Äôt Include the attachments from the original message. 
At this point, you follow the same steps described previously to type your message, add 
addressees, and send it. 
Cleaning up and Organizing Your Inbox 
As you get more comfortable with your iPod touch as an email device, you will 
increasingly find yourself using the Mail program. It will eventually become necessary to 
occasionally do some email housecleaning. You can delete or move email messages 
easily on your iPod touch. 
Deleting a Single Message 
To delete a single message from your inbox, 
follow these steps: 
1. Swipe right or left on a message in the 
inbox to bring up the Delete button. 
2. Tap Delete to remove the message. 
 
 
DeletingMoving or Marking Several Messages
We showed you earlier in this chapter how to get this done in the ‚ÄúMove, Delete, or Mark 
(Flag) Multiple Messages‚Äù section. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
336 
Deleting from the Message Viewing Screen 
The Message viewing screen includes another way to delete messages. Open any 
message to read it and tap the Trash Can icon 
 in the middle of the bottom of 
the screen. You will see the email shrink and fly into the Trash Can, so it can be deleted. 
TIP: You can use the Settings app to make your iPod touch ask you before deleting email. To do 
so, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars and set the switch next to Ask Before Deleting to Yes. 
You can organize your mail by moving it into other folders. Email messages can be 
moved out of your inbox for storage or for reading at another time. 
NOTE: If you are using iCloud or another supported email server, you can create, rename or 
delete mail folders right on your device, see section ‚ÄúAdding or Editing Email Folders or 
Mailboxes‚Äù earlier in this chapter.  If this does not work for you, then, you need to set them up in 
your main email account and sync them to your iPod touch. We will show you how to do this in 
this chapter‚Äôs ‚ÄúFine Tune Your E-Mail Settings‚Äù section. 
Moving an Email to a Folder While Viewing It 
Sometimes, you may want to organize your email for easy retrieval later. For example, 
you might receive an email about an upcoming trip and want to move it to the Travel 
folder. Sometimes you receive emails that require attention later, in which case you can 
move them to the Requires Attention folder. This can help you remember to work on 
such emails later. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
337 
Follow these steps to move an email 
message: 
1. Open the email message. 
2. Tap the Move icon in the upper-right 
corner. 
3. Choose a new folder, and the 
message will be moved out of the 
current inbox. 
 
 
Copy and Paste from an Email 
Here are a few tips to select text or pictures and copy them from an email message: 
 Double-tap text to select a word, then drag 
the blue handles up or down to adjust the 
selection. Next, select Copy. 
 
 Press and hold text, and then choose Select 
or Select All. 
 
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
338 
 Press and hold an image, and then select 
Save Image or Copy. 
 
 
For a more complete description, please check out the ‚ÄúCopy and Paste‚Äù section in 
Chapter 2: ‚ÄúTyping, Copy and Search.‚Äù 
Searching for Email Messages 
The iPod touch has some good built-in search functionality to help you find your emails. 
You can search your inbox by the From:, To:, Subject, or All fields. This helps you filter 
your inbox, so you can find exactly what you are searching for. 
Activating Email Search
It‚Äôs easy to initiate an email search. Begin by navigating to the inbox of the account you 
wish to search. If you scroll up to the top, you will now see the familiar Search bar at the 
top of your inbox. 
If your email account supports the feature, you can also search the server for email 
messages. At the time of writing, a few of the supported types of searchable email 
accounts include Exchange, iCloud (formerly called MobileMe), and Gmail IMAP. 
Follow these steps to search through your email on a server: 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
339 
1.
Tap the Search bar to see a new 
menu of soft keys under the 
Search bar. 
2.
Type the text you wish to search 
for. 
3.
Tap one of the tabs under the 
Search window: 
a.
From: Searches only the 
sender‚Äôs email addresses. 
b.
To: Searches only the 
recipients‚Äô email addresses. 
c.
Subject: Searches only 
message Subject fields. 
d.
All: Searches every part of 
the message. 
For example, assume that we want to search an 
inbox for an email from ‚ÄúMartin.‚Äù We would type 
Martin‚Äôs name into the Search box and then 
touch From. The inbox would then be filtered to 
show only the emails from Martin. 
Fine Tuning Your Email Settings 
You can fine-tune the email accounts on your iPod touch with the myriad options 
available in the Settings app. Follow these steps to change these settings: tap the 
Settings icon, then tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars.  The sections that follow explain the 
adjustments you can make. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
340 
Automatically Retrieve Email (Fetch New Data) 
In addition to the options under Advanced, you can use the Email settings to configure 
how often your email is fetched or pulled to your iPod touch. By default, your iPod touch 
automatically receives mail or other contact or calendar updates when they are 
‚Äúpushed‚Äù from the server. 
You can adjust this setting by taking the following 
steps: 
1. Tap the Settings app. 
2. Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars. 
3. Tap Fetch New Data under the email 
accounts listed. 
 
4. Set Push to ON (default) to automatically 
have the server push data. Set it to OFF to 
conserve your battery life. 
5. Adjust the timing schedule to pull data 
from the server. This is how frequently 
applications should pull new data from the 
server. 
NOTE: If you set this option to Every 15 Minutes, 
you will receive more frequent updates; however, 
this option sacrifices battery life compared to a 
setting of Hourly or Manually. 
 
 
Having automatic retrieval is very handy if you just want to turn on your iPod touch and 
see that you have messages; otherwise, you need to remember to check. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
341 
Advanced Push Options 
At the bottom of the Fetch New Data 
screen, below the Hourly and Manually 
settings, you can touch the Advanced 
button to see a new screen with all your 
email accounts listed. 
Tap any email account to adjust its 
settings. 
 
 
 
Most accounts can be Fetched on the 
schedule you set or set to Manual. The 
Manual option requires that you retrieve 
data using the Update button. This 
screen gives you the ability to adjust 
Fetch, Manual, or even Push settings 
for each account you have set up. 
 
 
Adjusting Your Mail Settings 
Under the Accounts section, you can see all the email settings listed under Mail. The 
Default settings may work well for you; but if you need to adjust any of these, you can 
follow these steps: 
Show: This sets how many emails are 
pulled from the server. You can specify 
anywhere from 50 to 1,000 messages (the 
default is 50 recent messages). 
Preview: This option lets you set how many
lines of text in addition to the Subject are 
shown in the inbox Preview. You can adjus
this value from None to 5 Lines (the default
is 2 Lines). 
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
342 
Minimum Font Size: This is the default 
font size shown when opening an email 
the first time. It is also smallest font size 
that you are allowed to zoom out to 
when viewing an email. Your options are 
Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, 
and Giant (the default is Medium). 
TIP: You can expand the font size further in 
the Accessibility area of settings.  Check out 
Chapter 2: "Typing, Copy and Search" for 
more details. 
Show To/Cc Label: With this option ON, 
you will see a small To or Cc label in your 
inbox before the subject. This label shows 
which field your address was placed in (the 
default state of this option is OFF). 
Ask Before Deleting: Turn this option ON 
to be asked every time you try to delete a 
message (the default is OFF). 
 
Load Remote Images: This option allows 
your iPod touch to load all the graphics 
(remote images) that are placed in some 
email messages (the default value for this 
option is ON). 
Organize by Thread: This option groups 
related emails together. It shows only one 
message, with a number next to it. That 
number indicates how many related emails 
exist. This feature gives you a good way to 
keep all discussions together in one place 
(the default value of this option is ON). 
 
 
Always Bcc Myself: This option sends a 
blind carbon copy (Bcc:) of every email 
you send from your iPod touch to your 
email account (the default value of this 
option is OFF). 
 
This shows 
Organize by 
Thread is On. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
343 
Changing Your Email Signature 
By default, emails you send will say ‚ÄúSent from my iPod touch.‚Äù Follow these steps to 
change the Signature line of the email: 
 
 
1. Tap the Signature tab and type in the new 
email signature you want at the bottom of 
emails sent from your iPod touch. 
2. When you are done editing the Signature 
field, tap the Mail, Contacts... button in the 
upper-left corner. This will return you to the 
Mail settings screen. 
 
 
Changing Your Default Mail Account (Sent From) 
If you have multiple email accounts set up on your iPod touch, you should set one of 
them‚Äîusually, the one you use most‚Äîas your Default Account. When you select 
Compose from the Email screen, the default account is always chosen. Follow these 
steps to change the email account you send from by default: 
 
 
1. Tap the Default Account option, and you will 
see a list of all your email accounts. 
2. Tap the email account you wish to use as your 
Default Account choice. 
3. When you are done, touch the Mail, 
Contacts... button to return to the Mail settings 
menu. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
344 
Toggling Sounds for Receiving and Sending Email 
You may notice a little sound effect every time you 
send or receive email. What you hear is the default 
setting on your iPod touch. 
If you want to disable this or change it, you do so 
in the Settings program: 
1. Tap your Settings icon. 
2. Tap Sounds. 
3. You will see various switches to turn 
sound effects on or off. Tap New Mail 
and Sent Mail to select your mail tone 
options. 
 
Advanced Email Options 
NOTE: Email accounts set up as Exchange, 
IMAP, or iCloud will not have this 
Advanced email settings screen. This only 
applies to POP3 email accounts. 
To get to the Advanced options for each 
email account, follow these steps: 
1. Touch the Settings icon. 
2. Touch Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars. 
3. Touch an email address listed 
under Accounts. 
 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
345 
4. At the bottom of the mail settings 
pop-up window, tap the 
Advanced button to bring up the 
Advanced dialog. 
 
 
Removing Email Messages from Your iPod touch After 
Deletion 
You can select how frequently you want email 
removed completely from your iPod touch once it is 
deleted. 
Touch the Remove tab and select the option that is 
best for you; the default setting is Never.
Using SSL and Authentication 
The SSL and Authentication features were discussed previously; however, this screen 
gives you another location to access these features for a particular email account. 
Deleting from Server 
You can configure your iPod touch to handle the deletion of messages from your email 
server. Usually, this setting is left at Never, and this function is handled on your main 
computer. If you use your iPod touch as your main email device, however, you might 
want to handle that feature from the iPod touch itself. Follow these steps to remove 
deleted emails on the server from your iPod touch. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
346 
1. Touch the Delete from Server tab to 
select the feature that best suits your 
needs: Never, Seven Days, or When 
removed from inbox. 
2. The default setting is Never. If you want 
to choose Seven Days; that option 
should give you enough time to check 
email on your computer, as well as your 
iPod touch, and then decide what to 
keep and what to get rid of. 
Changing the Incoming Server Port 
As you did with the Outgoing Server Port earlier, you can change the Incoming Server 
Port if you are having trouble receiving email. It is very rare that your troubles will be 
related to the port you receive mail on; consequently, you will rarely need to change this 
number. If your email service provider gives you a different number, just touch the 
numbers and input a new port. The value for an Incoming Server Port is usually 995, 
993, or 110; however, the port value could also be another number. 
Troubleshooting Email Problems 
Usually, your email works flawlessly on your iPod touch. However, sometimes your email 
may not work as flawlessly as you would hope. This could be due to a server issue, a 
network connectivity issue, or an email service provider requirement that isn‚Äôt being met. 
More often than not, there is a simple setting that needs to be adjusted or a password 
that needs to be re-entered. 
If you try out some of the troubleshooting tips that follow and your email is still not 
working, then your email server may just be down temporarily. Check with your email 
service provider to make sure your mail server is up and running; you might also check 
whether your provider has made any recent changes that would affect your settings. 
TIP: If the tips that follow do not solve the problem, please check out Chapter 25: 
‚ÄúTroubleshooting‚Äù for more helpful tips and resources. 

CHAPTER 16:  Communicate with Email 
347 
E-Mail Isn‚Äôt Being Received or Sent 
If you can‚Äôt send or receive email, your first step should be to verify that you are 
connected to the Internet. Check this by looking at your network connectivity symbols in 
the upper-left corner of your Home screen (see Chapter 4: "Connect to the Network" for 
details). 
Sometimes, you need to adjust the outgoing port for email to be sent properly. Do so by 
following these steps: 
1. Tap Settings. 
2. Touch Mail, Contacts and Calendars. 
3. Touch your email account that is having trouble sending messages 
under Accounts. 
4. Touch SMTP and verify that your outgoing mail server is set correctly; 
also check that it is set to ON. 
5. Touch Outgoing Mail Server at the top and verify all the settings, such 
as Host Name, User Name, Password, SSL, Authentication, and 
Server Port. You might also try 587, 995, or 110 for the Server Port 
value; sometimes that helps. 
6. Click Done and the email account name in the upper-left corner to 
return to the Email settings screen for this account. 
7. Scroll down to the bottom and touch Advanced. 
8. You can also try a different port setting for the server port on this 
screen, such as 587, 995, or 110. If those values don‚Äôt work, contact 
your email service provider to get a different port number and verify your 
settings.

                    Chapter 
Contacts and Notes 
Your iPod touch gives you immediate access to all your important information. Just like 
your computer, your iPod touch can store thousands of contacts for easy retrieval. In 
this chapter, we‚Äôll show you how to add new contact, customize your contacts by 
adding new fields, organize your contacts with groups, quickly search or scroll through 
contacts, and even see a contact‚Äôs location with the iPod touch‚Äôs Maps app. We will 
also show you how to customize the Contacts view so it is sorted and displayed just the 
way you like it. Finally, we will cover a few troubleshooting tips that will save you some 
time when you run into difficulties. 
We will also give you an overview of the Notes app, which you can use to write notes, 
make grocery lists, and make lists of movies you‚Äôd like to watch or books you‚Äôd like to 
read. We will show you how to organize and email notes to yourself or others. Ideally, 
we hope that Notes will become so easy on the iPod touch that you can eventually get 
rid of most, if not all, of your paper sticky notes! 
What is also great is that you can use iCloud to wirelessly synchronize, share and back 
up your contacts and notes.  So you never have to worry about losing your important 
information or whether or not you have the latest information on your device or 
computer. 
Loading Your Contacts onto the iPod touch 
Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync with iCloud, iTunes and More‚Äù covered how to load your contacts onto 
the iPod touch using the iTunes app on your Mac or Windows computer. You can also 
load contacts onto your iPod touch using the Google Sync or iCloud services. 
TIP: You can add new contact entries from email messages you receive. Learn how in  
Chapter 16: ‚ÄúCommunicate with Email.‚Äù 
17 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
350 
When Is Your Contact List Most Useful? 
The Contacts app is most useful when two things are true: 
1. You have many names and addresses in it. 
2. You can easily find what you need. 
Improving Your Contact List 
We have a couple of basic rules that can help you make your contact list on your iPod 
touch more useful: 
Rule 1: Add anything and everything to your contacts. 
You never know when you might need that obscure restaurant name, plumber‚Äôs 
number, and so on. 
Rule 2: As you add entries, make sure you think about how to find them in the 
future (first name, last name, company). 
We have many tips and tricks in this chapter to help you enter names, so you 
can find them instantly when you need them. 
TIP: Here‚Äôs a good way to find restaurants. Whenever you enter a restaurant into your contacts 
list, make sure to put the word ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù into the company name field, even if it‚Äôs not part of 
the name. When you type the letters ‚Äúrest,‚Äù then you should instantly find all your restaurants! 
Adding a New Contact on Your iPod touch  
You can always add your contacts right on your iPod touch. This is 
handy when you‚Äôre away from your computer‚Äîbut have your iPod 
touch‚Äîand need to add someone to your contacts. It‚Äôs very easy to 
do; the next section will show you how. 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
351 
Start the Contacts App 
From your Home screen, touch the Contacts icon 
and you‚Äôll see the All Contacts list. Tap the Plus Sign 
button (+) in the upper-right corner to add a new 
contact, as shown in Figure 17‚Äì1. 
 
     
 
Figure 17‚Äì1. Entering a new contact name 
Tap each field to enter the new contact‚Äôs first name, last name and Company name.  
TIP: Keep in mind that the contacts search feature uses first, last, and company names. When 
you add or edit contacts, adding a special word to the company name can help you find a 
particular contact later. For example, adding the words ‚ÄúCece friend‚Äù to the Company field can 
help you find all of Cece‚Äôs friends quickly using the search feature. 
Under the First Last button are fields for mobile phone, email, ringtone, text tone, 
home page, add new address and add field.  Under that, you can Link contacts 
together.  

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
352 
Adding a New Phone Number 
 
Tap the Phone button and use the Numbers 
keyboard to input the phone number. 
TIP: Don‚Äôt worry about parentheses, dashes, 
or dots‚Äîthe iPod touch will put the number 
into the correct format. Just type the digits of 
the area code and number. If you know the 
country code, it‚Äôs a good idea to put that in, as 
well.
Next, choose which type of phone number 
this is‚Äîmobile, home, work, or other. There 
are nine fields you can choose from, and 
there‚Äôs also a Custom field if you find none of 
the built-in fields apply. 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
353 
Adding Email Addresses
 
Touch the Email tab and enter the email 
address for your contact. You can also 
touch the tab to the left of the email 
address and select whether this is a home, 
work, or other email address. 
After you add one address, you will see 
another field appear to add more email 
addresses. 
Custom Ringtone or Text Tone 
 
Touch the ringtone or text tone tabs to 
select a custom ringtone (for FaceTime) or 
text tone (for iMessage) when this person 
calls or sends you a text message.  
Entering Web Site Addresses 
 
You will also see a home page field in which 
you can enter the address of your contact‚Äôs 
web site or even multiple web sites. 
NOTE: If you used iCloud to sync your 
contacts, iCloud may automatically look for a 
Facebook home page to integrate into the 
contact info.

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
354 
Adding the Street Address 
 
Below the home field are the fields for adding 
the address. Input the Street, City, State, and 
Zip Code. You can also specify the Country 
and whether this is a home or work address. 
 
Adding New Fields 
 
 
Tap the Add Field tab and select any of the 
suggested fields to add it to that particular 
contact (see Figure 17‚Äì2).  
    
 
Figure 17‚Äì2. New fields available to add to your Contact entry 
 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
355 
When you touch Birthday, you‚Äôre presented with a 
wheel. You can turn the wheel to the corresponding 
date to add the birthday to the contact information. 
When you are finished, just touch the Done button 
in the upper-right corner of the New Contact form. 
 
 
TIP: Suppose you meet someone at the bus stop‚Äîsomeone you want to remember. Of course, 
you should enter your new friend‚Äôs first and last names (if you know them); however, you should 
also enter the words ‚Äúbus stop‚Äù in the Company name field. Then, when you type the letters 
‚Äúbus‚Äù or ‚Äústop,‚Äù you should instantly find everyone you‚Äôve met at the bus stop, even if you can‚Äôt 
remember their names! 
Adding a Photo to Contacts 
You may want to associate a photo with a contact. 
From the New Contact screen we‚Äôve been working 
in, simply touch the Add Photo button next to the 
First Last tab. 
If you are changing a photo when you are in ‚Äúedit 
contact‚Äù mode, you‚Äôll see edit at the bottom of the 
existing photo. 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
356 
After you touch the add photo button, you‚Äôll see that 
you can do the following: 
 Take Photo 
 Choose Photo 
 
If there‚Äôs a photo already in place, you can also do 
these things: 
 Edit Photo 
 Delete Photo 
  
To choose an existing photo, select the photo album 
where the picture is located and touch the 
corresponding tab. When you see the picture you 
want to use, just touch it. 
You‚Äôll notice that the top and bottom of the photo 
become grayed out and that you can manipulate the 
picture by moving it, pinching to zoom in or out, and 
then arranging it in the Picture window. 
Once the picture is sitting where you want it, just 
touch the Choose button in the lower-right corner 
and that picture will be set for the contact. 
 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
357 
TIP: If you just moved into a new neighborhood, it can be quite daunting to remember everyone‚Äôs 
name. Therefore, it‚Äôs good practice to add the word ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù into the Company name field for 
every neighbor you meet. To instantly call up all your neighbors, simply type the letters ‚Äúneigh‚Äù 
to find everyone you‚Äôve met! 
Searching Your Contacts 
Let‚Äôs say you need to find a specific phone number or email address. Just touch your 
Contacts icon as you did previously, and you‚Äôll see a Search box at the top of your All 
Contacts list (see Figure 17‚Äì3). 
TIP: If you are somewhere in the middle or bottom of your Contacts list, you can quickly jump to 
the top of the Contacts screen and see this Search window by tapping the time at the very top 
of your iPod touch. 
 
Figure 17‚Äì3. The contacts Search box 
To find a contact, enter the first few letters of any 
of these three searchable fields: 
 First Name 
 Last Name  
 Nickname 
 Company Name 
The iPod touch begins to filter immediately and 
displays only those contacts that match the 
letters typed. 
TIP: To further narrow the search, hit the Space 
key and type a few more letters.


CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
358 
When you see the correct name, just touch it and that individual‚Äôs contact information 
will appear. 
Quickly Jump to a Letter by Tapping and Sliding on the 
Alphabet 
If you hold your finger on the alphabet on the left edge of the screen and drag it up or 
down, you can jump to that letter. 
Search by Flicking 
If you don‚Äôt want to manually input letters, you can just move your finger and flick from 
the bottom up, and you‚Äôll see your contacts move quickly on the screen. Just continue 
to flick or scroll until you see the name you want. Tap a name and the contact 
information for that person will appear. 
Search Using Groups 
If you have your contacts sorted by groups on 
your PC or Mac and you sync your iPod touch 
with your computer or over the air using iCloud 
then those groups will be synced to your iPod 
touch. When you start your Contacts app, you 
will see Groups at the top. Under the Groups 
heading, you will see All Contacts. 
Choose All Contacts to search all the available 
contact information on the iPod touch. 
If you have multiple accounts synced, you will 
see a tab for each individual account and one 
for All Contacts at the top. 
This example shows two groups‚Äîone is from a 
Microsoft Exchange account (i.e., a company 
email account), and one is from a group of 
iCloudontacts. 
If you have an Exchange ActiveSync account 
and your company has enabled it, your 
Exchange Global Address List shows up here, 
under Groups, as well. You can search to find 
anyone in your company there. 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
359 
NOTE: You can‚Äôt create groups in the Contacts app on the iPod touch‚Äîthey must be created on 
your computer or synced when you add contact accounts to your iPod touch. 
Adding Contacts from Email Messages 
Often you‚Äôll receive an email message and realize that the contact is not in your address 
book. Adding a new contact from an email message is easy. 
Open the email message from the contact you‚Äôd 
like to add to your Contacts list. Next, in the 
email message‚Äôs From field, just touch the 
name of the sender next to the From: tag. 
If the sender is not in your address book, you‚Äôll 
be taken to a screen that lets you choose 
whether to add that email address to an existing 
contact or to create a new one. 
     
If you select Create a New Contact, you‚Äôll be 
taken to the same New Contact screen we saw 
earlier (see Figure 17‚Äì1). 
But suppose this is someone‚Äôs personal email 
address, and you already have an entry for that 
person with a work email address. In that case, 
you would select Add to Existing Contact and 
choose the correct person. Next, you‚Äôd give this 
email address a new tag‚Äîpersonal, in this case. 
  

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
360 
Linking a Contact to Another App 
You might have contact information for the sender of the email message in another app 
on the iPod touch. The iPod touch makes it easy to link these contacts together. 
For example, assume Steve, the sender of the email message, is in a list of your 
LinkedIn contacts, but not a contact on your iPod touch, for some reason. Here is how 
you can link his contact information in your iPod touch to the information you have in the 
LinkedIn app: 
1.
Add him to your contacts, as shown previously.

Figure 17‚Äì4. Linking a new contact in an email message to an existing social networking contact 
TIP: Learning the names of the parents of a school-age child‚Äôs friends can be fairly challenging. 
In the First field, however, you can add, not just the name of your child‚Äôs friend, but also the 
names of the child‚Äôs parents (e.g., First: Samantha (Mom: Susan, Dad: Ron)). Next, in the 
Company field, add the name of your child and ‚Äúschool friend‚Äù (e.g., Cece school friend). Now, 
just typing your child‚Äôs name in the Search box of your All Contacts list instantly finds every 
person you ever met at your child‚Äôs school. Now you can say, without missing a beat: ‚ÄúHello, 
Susan, great to see you again!‚Äù Try your best to covertly look up the name.

Sending a Picture to a Contact 
If you want to send a picture to a contact, then you will need to do that from the Photos 
app (see Chapter 19: ‚ÄúWorking with Photos‚Äù). 
Sending an Email Message from Contacts 
Many of the core apps (e.g., Contacts, Mail, and Messages) are fully integrated, so one 
app can easily trigger another. If you want to send an email message to one of your 
contacts, simply open the contact and tap the email address. The Mail app will launch, 
and you can compose and send an email message to this person. 
Start your Contacts app by touching the Contacts icon. Either search or flick through 
your contacts until you find the contact you need. 
 
In the contact information, touch the email address of the contact you‚Äôd like to use. 
You‚Äôll see that the Mail program launches 
automatically with the contact‚Äôs name in the To: 
field of the email message. Finally, type and 
send the message. 
 
Showing Your Contacts Addresses on the Map 
One of the great things about the iPod touch is its integration with Google Maps. This is 
very evident in the Contacts app. Let‚Äôs say you want to map the home or work address 
of any contact in your address book. In the old days (pre-iPod touch), you‚Äôd have to use 
Google, MapQuest, or some other program, and then laboriously retype or copy and 
paste the address information. This is very time-consuming‚Äîbut you don‚Äôt have to do 
this on the iPod touch. 
Simply open the contact as you did earlier. 
This time, touch the address at the bottom 
of the contact information. 
           
 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
363 
Your Maps app (which is powered by Google 
Maps) immediately loads and drops a Push-Pin 
icon at the exact location of the contact. The 
contact‚Äôs name will appear above the Push-Pin.
 
 
Touch the tab on the top of the Push-Pin to get to 
the Info screen. 
Now you can select Directions To Here or 
Directions From Here. 
Next, type the correct start or end address and 
touch the Route button in the lower-right corner. If 
you decide you don‚Äôt want the directions, just tap 
the Clear button in the top left. 
What if you had just typed the address in your 
Maps app, instead of clicking from your contact 
list? In that case, you might want to touch Add to 
Contacts to add this address. 
 
TIP: To return to your contact information, tap the Map button, exit Maps, and then start up 
Contacts. You can also use multi-tasking (see Chapter 7: ‚ÄúMultitasking‚Äù) by double-clicking the 
Home button and choosing the Contacts app. 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
364 
Changing Your Contact Sort and Display Order 
Like other settings, the Contact app‚Äôs options are accessible via the Settings icon. 
Touch the Settings icon, scroll down to Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and then touch the 
tab. 
Next, scroll down until you see Contacts 
and the two options underneath it. To 
change the sort order, touch the Sort 
Order tab and select whether you want 
your contacts sorted by first name or last 
name. 
  
 
You may want to change how your 
contacts are displayed. Here‚Äôs where you 
get it done; you can choose First, Last or 
Last, First. Tap the Display Order tab 
and choose whether you want your 
contact displayed in first name or last 
name order. Tap the Mail, Contacts... 
button in the upper-left corner to save 
your settings changes. 
  
 
Searching for Global Address List (GAL) Contacts 
If you have an Exchange account configured, you 
should have an option for a Global Address List. This 
gives you access to your Global Address List if you are 
connected to your organization‚Äôs server. 
Open your Contacts app and look under Exchange for 
a tab that says Exchange Global Address List. 
 
Contacts Troubleshooting 
Sometimes, your Contacts app might not work the way you expect. (If you don‚Äôt see all 
your contacts, review the steps in the Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync with iCloud, iTunes and More‚Äù 
for information on how to sync with your address book application.) Make sure you have 
selected All Groups in the settings of the iTunes app. 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
365 
TIP: If you are syncing with another contact application, such as Contacts in Gmail, then make 
sure you select the option closest to All Contacts, rather than a subset like a particular group. 
When Global Address List Contacts Don‚Äôt Show Up (For 
Microsoft Exchange Users) 
Sometimes contacts in the Global Address List won‚Äôt show up on your iPod touch. If this 
occurs, begin by making sure you are connected to a Wi-Fi or 3G cellular data network. 
Next, check your Exchange settings and verify you have the correct server and login 
information. To do so, tap the Settings button, and then scroll to and touch Mail, 
Contacts and Calendar. Find your Exchange account on the list and touch it to look at 
the settings. You may need to contact technical support at your organization to make 
sure your Exchange settings are correct. 
The Notes App 
If you are like many people, your desk is filled with little yellow sticky notes‚Äînotes to do 
everything imaginable. Even with our computers, we still tend to leave these little notes 
as reminders. One of the great things about the iPod touch is that you can write your 
notes on familiar yellow notepaper, and then keep them neatly organized and sorted. 
You can even email them to yourself or someone else to make sure that the information 
is not forgotten. You can also backup your notes using iTunes and, if you choose, sync 
notes to your computer or other web sites such as Google. 
TIP: The Notes app that comes with the iPod touch is pretty basic and utilitarian. If 
you need a more robust notes application that can sort, categorize, import items 
(PDF, Word, and so on), have folders, search, and more, you should check out the 
App Store on your iPod touch. Do a search for ‚Äúnotes,‚Äù and you will find at least a 
dozen notes-related apps ranging from free to $0.99 and up. 
The Notes app on the iPod touch gives you a convenient place to keep 
your notes and simple ‚Äúto-do‚Äù lists. You can also keep simple lists, such 
as a grocery list, or a list for other stores, such as a hardware or pet store. 
If you have your iPod touch with you, you can add items to these lists as 
soon as they occur to you, and they can be accessed and edited at any 
time. 
 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
366 
Sync Notes 
You can sync notes between iOS devices like iPod touch and IPad, or with your 
computer or other web site using the methods we show you in Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync with 
iCloud, iTunes and More.‚Äù  The nice thing about syncing notes is that you can add a 
note on your computer and have it just ‚Äúappear‚Äù on your iPod touch. Then when you are 
out and about, you can edit that note and have it synced back to your computer. No 
more re-typing or remembering things. You always have your iPod touch with you, so 
taking notes anywhere, anytime, can be a great way never to forget anything important.  
Getting Started with Notes 
Like all other apps, simply tap the Notes icon to start it After 
starting the Notes app, you see what looks like a typical 
yellow note pad. 
 
Multiple Notes Accounts 
If you happen to be syncing over iCloud, Exchange, or at least one IMAP email account 
and your computer using iTunes, then you will see that your notes from each of these 
accounts are kept separate. This is very much like how your contacts are kept in 
separate groups by email account and how your calendars are kept separate by email 
account. 
In order to see multiple notes accounts, 
you have to set a switch in the account 
setup screen. 
When you setup your IMAP email account, 
in Settings ‚û§ Mail, Contacts, Calendars, 
you will see options to turn Notes syncing 
on or off. In order to see these notes 
accounts, you have to set the Notes 
switch to On, as shown for this Gmail 
account. 
 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
367 
To view the various notes accounts, tap 
the Accounts button in the upper left 
corner of the Notes app. 
 
Then, on the next screen, you can tap 
selections to view All Notes, or your notes 
for each account. In this image, the Gmail 
or MobileMe account are options. 
Notes you add to an individual account will 
be kept with that account. For example, If 
you add notes to Gmail, then those would 
show up only on your Gmail account. 
 
How Are My Notes Sorted? 
You see that all notes are listed in reverse chronological order, with the most recently 
edited notes at the top and the oldest at the bottom.  
The date that is shown is the last time and date that the particular note was edited, not 
when it was first created. So you will notice the order of your notes moving around on 
the screen. 
This sorting can be a good thing because your most recent (or frequently edited) notes 
will be right at the top. 
TIP: If you want  to keep track of your to-do lists, you can use the built in reminders app on your 
iPod touch, If you want something more powerful, check out Things, Appigo Todo, or 
OmniFocus in the App Store. 
 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
368 
Adding a New Note 
To start a new note, tap the plus sign 
 in the upper right-hand corner. 
The notepad is blank, and the 
keyboard pops up for you to 
begin typing.  
TIP: You can turn your iPod 
touch on its side to see the 
larger, landscape keyboard. 
 
 
 
 
Adding a Title to the Note 
The first few words you type before you hit 
the Return key will become the title of the 
note. So think about what you want as the 
title, and type that first. In the image shown, 
Grocery list becomes the title of the note. 
Put a new item on each line, and tap the 
Return key to go to the next line. 
When you are done, touch the Notes button 
in the top left-hand corner to return to the 
main Notes screen. 
 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
369 
Viewing or Editing Your Notes 
Your notes appear in the list as tabs to 
touch. Touch the name of the note you 
wish to view or edit. The contents of the 
note are then displayed. 
You can scroll in Notes as you do in any 
program. You will notice that the date and 
time the note was last edited appear in the 
upper right-hand corner. 
When you are done reading the note, just 
touch the Notes button in the top left-
hand corner to return to the main Notes 
screen. 
To advance through multiple notes, just 
touch the arrows at the bottom of the 
screen. Touch the Forward 
 arrow. 
The page turns, and you can see the next 
note. To go back, just hit the Back 
 
arrow. 
 
 
Deleting Notes 
To delete a note, swipe your finger on the note from 
left to right on the list and tap Delete. 
Or, if you are viewing the note, then tap the Trash 
Can icon 
 at the bottom. The iPod touch 
prompts you to delete the note or cancel. 
 

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
370 
Emailing or Printing a Note 
One of the Notes app‚Äôs convenient features is the 
ability to email or print a note. Let‚Äôs say you wrote a 
grocery note and wanted to email it to your spouse, 
or you made a list of gift ideas and want to hand them 
out. To email or print a note, just tap the Action 
button icon 
 at the bottom of the screen. 
Data Detectors - Cool Things With Underlined Words
If you type in the words "tomorrow 
morning" in a note and save it.  The next 
time you open that note, you will see that 
the words have been underlined.  If you 
tap and hold the underlined words, you will 
see a button asking if you want to Create 
Event.  Tap the button to create a new 
calendar event for tomorrow morning.  

CHAPTER 17:  Contacts and Notes 
371 
TIP: Whenever date and time words are underlined, the iPod touch recognizes them as potential 
calendar events.  This works in notes, email messages and other places on your iPod touch. The 
iPod touch also has other ‚Äúdata detectors‚Äù, for example it can recognize phone numbers, web 
site addresses, and even tracking numbers for packages.

                     Chapter 
Calendar and Reminders 
The iPod touch makes the old calendar that used to hang on the fridge obsolete. In this 
chapter, we will show you how to utilize the Calendar app of the iPod touch to its full 
potential. For example, we will show you how to schedule appointments, manage 
multiple calendars, change views on your calendar, and even how to deal with meeting 
invitations. 
In iOS 5, Apple has added the Reminders app for easy management of all your tasks 
and to-do lists. 
NOTE: For most of this chapter, we will talk about syncing your iPod touch calendar with another 
calendar because it is nice to have your calendar accessible on your iPod touch and in other 
places. If you choose, you can also use your iPod touch in a standalone mode, where you do not 
sync to any other calendar. In the latter case, all the steps we describe for events, viewing, and 
managing events still apply equally to you. It is critical, however, that you use the iCloud or 
iTunes automatic backup feature to save a copy of your calendar, just in case something 
happens to your iPod touch. 
Managing Your Busy Life on Your iPod touch 
The Calendar and Reminders apps provide powerful, easy-to-use functionality that 
helps you manage your appointments, keep track of what you have to do, set reminder 
alarms, and even create and respond to meeting invitations (for Exchange and iCloud 
users).

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
374 
Syncing or Sharing Your Calendar and Reminders 
If you maintain a calendar or task list on 
your computer, or a calendar on a web site 
such as iCloud or Google Calendar, then 
you can synchronize or share that data 
with your iPod touch either by using the 
iTunes app and your sync cable or by 
setting up a wireless synchronization (see 
Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync iCloud, iTunes, and 
More‚Äù for information on syncing). 
 
After you set up the calendar and task syncing, all of your computer calendar 
appointments and to-do lists will be synced with your iPod touch calendar automatically, 
based on your sync settings (see Figure 18‚Äì1). 
If you use iTunes to sync with your calendar (e.g., Microsoft Outlook or Apple‚Äôs iCal), 
your appointments and tasks will be transferred or synced every time you connect your 
iPod touch to your computer. 
If you use another method to sync (e.g., iCloud, Exchange, or similar), this sync is 
wireless and automatic, and it will most likely happen without you having to do anything 
after the initial setup process.

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
375 
Today‚Äôs Day and Date Shown on the Calendar Icon 
The Calendar icon is usually right on your iPod touch‚Äôs Home screen. 
You will quickly notice that your Calendar icon changes to show 
today‚Äôs date and the day of the week. The icon to the right shows that it 
is a Friday, the 16th day of the month. 
 
 
TIP: If you use your iPod touch‚Äôs Calendar app often, you might want to think about pinning or 
moving it to the Bottom dock; you learned how to do this in the section on docking icons in 
Chapter 6: ‚ÄúIcons and Folders.‚Äù 
Viewing Your Appointments and Getting Around in 
Calendar 
The default view for the Calendar app shows your Day view. This view shows you at a 
glance any upcoming appointments for your day. Appointments are shown in your 
calendar. If you happen to have multiple calendars set up on your computer, such as 
Work and Home, then appointments from the different calendars will display as different 
colors on your iPod touch‚Äôs calendar. 
You can manipulate the calendar in various ways: 
 Move a day at a time: If you tap the triangles next to today‚Äôs date at 
the top, you move forward or backward a day. 
TIP: Touch and hold the triangles next to the date to advance quickly through days. 
 Change views: Tap the List, Day, and Month buttons at the bottom 
to change the view. 
 Jump to today: Tap the Today button at the bottom-left corner. 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
376 
The Four Calendar Views 
Your Calendar app comes with four views. Day, List, Week, and Month are all available 
in Portrait orientation; and you can switch between views by tapping the name of the 
view at the bottom of the screen. Week view is only available in Landscape orientation, 
and you can switch to it by turning your iPod touch sideways. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of 
the four views: 
 Day view: When you start the 
iPod touch‚Äôs Calendar app, the 
default view is usually the Day 
view. This allows you to quickly 
see everything you have 
scheduled for the day. You can 
find buttons to change the view 
at the bottom of the Calendar 
app. 
To move from one day to the 
next, simply swipe from right to 
left. To move back a day, swipe 
from left to right. 
 
 
 
 
 List view (also known as Agenda 
view): Tap the List button at the 
bottom, and you can see a list of 
your appointments. 
Depending on how much you 
have scheduled, you could see 
the next day or even the next 
week‚Äôs worth of scheduled 
events. 
Swipe up or down to see more 
events. 
 
 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
377 
 Month view: Tap the Month button 
at the bottom, and you can see a 
layout of the full month. Days with 
appointments have a small dot in 
them. Dots for the current day will 
show up highlighted in blue. 
TIP: To return to the Today view, just touch the Today 
button at the bottom left. 
 
                 
 
Go to the next month: Tap the 
triangle to the right of the month 
shown at the top. 
Go to the previous month: Tap the 
triangle to the left of the month. 
 
 Week view: Turn you iPod 
touch sideways to landscape 
orientation to access the 
week view. 
 Swipe left or right to see 
more days. 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
378 
Working with Several Calendars 
The Calendar app lets you view and work with more than one calendar. The number of 
calendars you see depends on how many you are syncing. For example, you may have  
iCloud or Google Calendar syncing for home and Exchange for work,  
To view just one calendar at a time, 
tap the Calendars button at the top 
and select only the calendar you wish 
to see. 
 
 
When you set up your Sync settings, you were able 
to specify which calendars you wanted to sync with 
your iPod touch. You can customize your calendar 
further by following these instructions: 
 Changing the colors:  If you 
don't like the color of a calendar 
on your iPod touch, it's easy to 
change: 
 Tap on the Calendars button at the top
right 
 Tap on the Edit button at the top right. 
 Tap on the calendar you want to chang
 You'll be presented with a list of color 
choices. Tap the one you want are you
new color will be set. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
379 
 
 Adding a new calendar: If you 
are using iCloud to sync, you will 
be able to add a new calendar on 
your iPod touch: 
a. Tap Calendars at the top-
right.  
b. Tap Edit at the top-right. 
c. Scroll down and tap Add 
Calendar‚Ä¶ in the iCloud 
section 
d. Enter a name and choose a 
color for your new calendar, 
and you're done! 
 
 
Adding New Calendar Events 
You can easily add new events or appointments right on your iPod touch. These new 
events and appointments will be synced (or shared with) your computer the next time a 
sync takes place. 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
380 
Adding a New Appointment 
Your instinct will most likely be to try to touch the 
screen at a particular time to set an appointment; 
and with iOS 5, you can finally do just that! 
 
 
To add a new calendar event from any Calendar 
view, follow these steps. 
1. Tap and hold your finger on the 
screen at the place where you 
want the appointment until a new 
colored bubble appears. (You can 
also still tap the + icon at the 
upper-right corner of the screen to 
add a new event. 
 
2. On the Add Event screen, touch 
the box marked Title & Location. 
 
Type in a title for the event and the location 
(optional). For example, you might type 
‚ÄúMeet with Martin‚Äù as the title and input the 
location as ‚ÄúOffice.‚Äù Or, you might choose to 
type ‚ÄúLunch with Martin‚Äù and then choose a 
very expensive restaurant in New York City. 
3. Touch the blue Done button in the 
upper-right corner to return to the 
Add Event screen.

4.
Touch the Starts or Ends tab to 
adjust the event timing. To change 
the start time, touch the Starts
field to highlight it in blue. Next, 
move the rotating dials at the 
bottom to reflect the correct date 
and start time of the appointment. 
5.
Alternatively, you can set an all-
day event by touching the switch 
next to All-day to set it to ON. 
NOTE: You will see a tab labeled Invitees after the Repeat tab only if your event is set up on an 
Exchange/Google or iCloud calendar.  
Recurring Events 
Some of your appointments happen every 
day, week, or month at the same time. Follow 
these steps if you are scheduling a recurring 
appointment: 
1.
Touch the Repeat tab and then 
select the interval of time for the 
recurring appointment from the list. 
2.
Touch Done to return to the 
main Event screen. 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
382 
3. If you set a Repeat meeting, then 
you will also have to say when the 
repeating event ends. Tap the End 
Repeat button to set this. 
4. You can select Repeat 
Forever or set a date. 
5. Tap Done when finished. 
 
Calendar Alerts 
You can have your iPod touch 4 give you an 
audible reminder, or alert, about an upcoming 
appointment. Alerts can help you keep from 
forgetting an important event. Follow these 
steps to create an alert: 
1. Touch the Alert tab and then select 
the option for a reminder alarm. You 
can have no alarm (None) at all or set 
a reminder that ranges from At time of 
event all the way to 2 days before the 
event, depending on what works best 
for you. 
2. Touch Done to get back to the main 
Event screen. 
 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
383 
Second Alert 
NOTE: You will see a Second Alert option if the 
calendar you are using is synced using iTunes or 
iCloud. However, you will not see a second alert if your 
event is tied to a Google Calendar synced using the 
Exchange setting. 
In most cases, you will see a tab for a Second Alert 
option once you set your first Alert option. You can set 
this second alert to another time before or after the first 
alert. Some people find a second alert very helpful for 
remembering critical events or appointments. 
TIP: Here‚Äôs a practical example that illustrates when you might want to set up two calendar alerts. 
If your child has a doctor or dentist appointment, then you might want to set the first event to go 
off the night before. This will remind you to write a note to the school and give it to your child. 
You can then set the second event for 45 minutes prior to the appointment time. This will leave 
you enough time to pick up your child from school and get to the appointment. 
Choosing a Calendar 
 
 
If you use more than one calendar, tap on the 
Calendar tab to change the calendar to which 
your new event is assigned.  
Touch the Calendar button in the upper- left 
corner to see all your calendars. 
Tap the calendar you want to use for this 
particular event. Usually, the calendar selected by 
default is the one you selected the last time you 
used your iPod touch to schedule an event. 
     

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
384 
Availability 
You can also let others know about your 
availability during the scheduled event. You can 
choose your availability from the following options: 
Busy (default), Free, Tentative, or Out of Office.  
(Tentative and Out of Office only appear when you 
sync an account with the Exchange setting.) 
NOTE: You will only see the Availability or Invitees 
fields if the calendar you are using for this event is 
synced with the iCloud, Exchange, or 
Exchange/Google settings, and each provides 
slightly different options. If you are synced with 
iCloud, you will also see a URLfield where you can 
add a website address for later reference.

Using Copy and Paste Between the Email and 
Calendar Apps 
The iPod touch software‚Äôs new Fast App Switcher means you can now easily jump 
between your Email and your Calendar programs to copy and paste information. This 
information could be anything, ranging from critical notes you need at your fingertips for 
a meeting to driving directions. Follow these steps to copy and paste information

10. Tap Paste. 
 
11. Now you should see the text you 
copied and pasted into the Notes 
field. 
12. Tap Done to save your changes.

Editing Appointments 
Sometimes, the details of an appointment 
may change and need to be adjusted. 
Fortunately, it‚Äôs easy to revise an 
appointment on your iPod touch. If all you 
want to do is change the time, you can 
simply move it on the screen. 
1. Touch and hold your finger 
down on the appointment 
you want to change.  
2. Drag the appointment to 
its new time slot. 
If you need to change the time more 
drastically than touch-and-drag allows, or 
if you need to change other fields, you can 
also use the Edit button.  
3. Tap the appointment that 
you want to change. 
4. Tap the Edit button in the 
upper-right corner to see 
the Edit screen that shows 
the appointment details. 
5. Touch the tab in the field you need 
to adjust, just like you did when 
creating the event. For example, you 
can change the time of this 
appointment by touching the Starts 
or Ends tab, and then adjusting the 
event‚Äôs starting or ending time. 
 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
388 
Editing a Repeating Event 
You edit a recurring or repeating event in 
exactly the same manner as any other 
event. The only difference is that you will 
be asked a question after you finish editing 
the event. You need to answer this 
question and tap the Done button. 
Tap Save for this event only if you want 
to make changes to only this instance of 
the repeating event. 
Tap Save for future events if you want to 
make changes to all instances of this 
repeating event. 
 
Switching an Event to a Different Calendar 
If you mistakenly set up an event on the wrong calendar, then go ahead and tap the 
Calendar button to change the calendar. Next, select one of the different calendars you 
have synced to your iPod touch. 
NOTE: Different fields may appear or disappear, depending on the calendar you choose to use. 
If you change your event from a calendar synced using iTunes to one synced with Exchange, 
then you will see the Second Alert field disappear. Also, you will see two new fields appear with 
an Exchange, Google, or iCloud calendar: Invitees and Availability. 
Deleting an Event 
Notice that, at the bottom of the Edit 
screen, you also have the option to delete 
this event. Simply touch the Delete Event 
button at the bottom of the screen to do 
so. 
 
Meeting Invitations 
For those who use Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Outlook, or iCloud regularly, meeting 
invitations become a way of life. You receive a meeting invitation in your email, you 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
389 
accept the invitation, and then the appointment gets automatically placed in your 
calendar. 
On your iPod touch, you will see that invitations you accept are placed into your 
calendar immediately. 
If you touch the meeting invitation in your 
calendar, you can see all the details that you 
need: the dial in number, the meeting ID, and 
any other details that might be included in the 
invitation.
Calendar Options 
There are only a few options to adjust in your Calendar app; 
you can find these in the Settings app. Follow these steps to 
adjust these options: 
1. Tap Settings from your Home screen. 
2. Scroll down to Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars and tap it. 
3. Scroll down to Calendars (it‚Äôs at 
the very bottom!) to see a few 
options.  
4. The first option is a simple switch 
that notifies you about New 
Invitation Alerts. If you receive 
any meeting invitations, it is good 
to keep this option set to the 
default ON position. 
5. Next, you may see the Sync option if you sync your Calendar program 
using Exchange or iCloud. You can adjust the setting to sync events to 
2 Weeks Back, 1 Month Back, 3 Months Back, 6 Months Back, or to 
show all All Events. 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
390 
6. Next, you can choose your time zone. 
This setting should reflect your Home 
settings from when you set up your iPod 
touch. If you are traveling and want to 
adjust your appointments for a different 
time zone, you can change the Time 
Zone value to whatever city you prefer. 
7. Default alert times can be set for 
birthdays, events, and all-day events. 
Events contain the usual options while 
birthdays and all-day events allow for 
the day of the event, 1 day before, or 2 
days before (all at 9am), or 1 week 
before. 
 
Changing the Default Calendar 
We mentioned earlier that you can have multiple 
calendars displayed on your iPod touch. The 
Default Calendar screen allows you to choose 
which calendar will be your default calendar. 
Specifying a calendar as the default means that, 
when you go to schedule a new appointment, 
this calendar will be selected by default. 
If you wish to use a different calendar‚Äîsay, your 
Work calendar‚Äîthen you can change that when 
you actually set the appointment, as shown 
earlier in this chapter. 
   
Reminders 
Reminders is a new app in iOS 5 that lets you simply and easily keep track of the things 
you need to get done and the dates and times you need to get them done by. You can 
think of this app as Apple‚Äôs answer to task or to-do lists. 
Reminder Views 
Your Reminders app has three main views: List, Date, and Month. What follows is a 
quick overview of these views. 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
391 
List is the default view for Reminders and shows 
you at a glance all the tasks you need to 
accomplish. 
NOTE: The default List view for iCloud accounts 
is called Reminders. The default List view for 
Microsoft Exchange accounts is called Tasks. 
If you have multiple lists, you can move between 
them by swiping from right to left, just as when 
moving between the different app pages on your 
iPod touch‚Äôs Home screen. 
Swipe from left to right to see a list of your 
Completed tasks. 
Date view lets you see your reminders on the day 
they‚Äôre due. You can easily swipe from one day to
the next; you can also scroll along the Date slider 
at the bottom. Follow these steps to change the 
date shown: 

Go to the next day: Swipe from 
right to left. 

Go to the previous day: Swipe 
from left to right. 

Go to Completed Task list: 
Swipe from left to right from the 
current day.

button 
 at the top left of the Date 
view. This will show you a layout of the full 
month. Days with reminders due are 
colored red. 
TIP: To return to the Today view, just 
touch the Today button at the top right. 
 
                 
 
Follow these steps to move back and forth 
between months: 
 Go to the next month: 
Scroll down. 
 Go to the previous 
month: Scroll up. 
 
 
Adding a New Reminder 
To add a new task from any List view, follow these 
steps: 
1. Tap the first blank line at the end of your 
current list. 
2. Type in a title for your task. 
3. When you‚Äôre finished, tap the black Done 
button on the top right. 
NOTE: You can also tap the Add button to create a 
new task.

Setting Due Dates 
The Reminders app includes standard due dates you 
can set for your reminders. When a task reaches its 
due date, you‚Äôll receive a popup notification to remind 
you about it. 
Follow these steps to set a Remind Me date: 
1. Tap Remind Me. 
2. To set a due date, toggle the On a Day option

brands, or anything else that could be helpful. 
 
 
Changing Lists 
Each reminder belongs to a list. You can have work 
lists, home lists, vacation lists, shopping lists‚Äî
anything you like. The Details page will show the 
name of the list currently associated with your new 
task. Follow these steps to change your current list: 
1. Tap the current list name. 
2. Tap the list you want to change to. 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
396 
Completing Reminders 
It‚Äôs incredibly easy to mark a reminder as 
Completed. Simply tap the box 
immediately to the left of the reminder‚Äôs 
title and a Checkmark icon will appear. 
That will move the reminder from its 
current list to the special Completed list, 
so you can go back and refer to it later, if 
necessary. 
If you make a mistake, just tap the box 
again to remove the Checkmark icon and 
return the reminder to its previous status. If 
the task has already been moved to the 
Completed list, swipe left until you get to 
the Completed list and then tap the box to 
uncheck it and move the reminder back to 
its previous list. 
 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
397 
Editing Reminders 
Sometimes, the details of a task may 
change and need to be adjusted. Luckily, 
changing any reminder is as simple as 
following these steps: 
1. Tap the reminder that you 
want to change. 
2. Tap the tabs on the Details 
page and adjust the 
details, just as you do 
when setting up a new 
task. 

 
Deleting a Reminder 
Notice that, at the bottom of the Details 
screen, you also have the option to delete 
a task. Simply tap the Delete button at the 
bottom of the screen to do so. 
 

CHAPTER 18:  Calendar and Reminders 
398 
Adding a New List 
The Reminders app lets you have multiple lists, which is handy for keeping your tasks 
organized. For example, you can make a new list to help you pack for an upcoming trip 
or shop for an upcoming birthday. 
You can create a new list for either iCloud Reminders or Exchange Tasks accounts, or 
local lists On my iPod touch. Follow these steps to create a new list: 
1. Tap the Lists button 
 on the top left 
of the screen.

Back, 1 Month Back, 3 Months Back, 6 Months Back, or to show All 
Reminders. 
Changing the Default List 
We mentioned earlier that you can have multiple 
lists displayed on your iPod touch. The Default 
List screen allows you to choose which list will 
be your default list. 
Specifying a list as the default means that, when 
you go to create a new reminder, it will be 
assigned to the specified list by default.

                     Chapter 
Working with Photos 
While previous versions of the iPod touch have included a rear-facing camera, the latest 
iPod touch comes with not one, but two cameras: an 960 x 720 pixel camera on the back; 
and a VGA (640 x 480 pixel) camera on the front for video chats and self-portraits. You can 
learn more about using the front-facing camera in the FaceTime app in Chapter 10: 
‚ÄúVideo Messaging and Skype.‚Äù 
Viewing and sharing your pictures on the iPod touch is truly a joy, due in large part to its 
beautiful high-resolution screen. In this chapter, we will discuss the many ways to get 
pictures onto your iPod touch. We will also show you how you to use the touch screen to 
navigate through your pictures, as well as how to zoom in and out and manipulate your 
photos. 
TIP: Did you know you can take a picture of the entire screen of your iPod touch by pressing two 
keys simultaneously? This is great to show someone a cool app or to prove that you got the high 
score on Tetris! 
Here‚Äôs how to get it done: press both the Home button and the On/Off/Sleep key on the top-right 
edge (you can press one key, hold it, and then press the other). This is a little tricky and takes 
some practice.  If you have done this correctly, the screen should flash, and you‚Äôll hear a camera 
sound. The screen capture you have taken will be in your Camera Roll album in the Photos app. 
Taking Photos Quickly 
Apple has recently added some great shortcuts to help you take photos more quickly 
and more conveniently. If your child is in the middle of an especially adorable or 
memorable moment, if you come across a rare bird in the woods, or if you need to grab 
a fast photo of something suspicious in your neighborhood, then you can use one of the 
following techniques to snap a picture quickly: 
19 

CHAPTER 19: Working with Photos 
402 

Double-click the Home button to bring up a Camera icon right on the 
Lock screen. Tapping the Camera icon will take you right to the 
Camera app, ready to take a photo. This means you no longer need to 
unlock your iPod touch, swipe to find the Camera app, and then wait 
for it to launch. 

Use the Volume Up hardware button to snap your photo. Rather than 
trying to hit the camera software button on the screen, you can use 
something more tactile and similar to traditional camera controls. 

Take multiple pictures. Apple claims it has gotten the time it takes to 
shoot the first photo down to a remarkable 1.1 seconds; however, the 
second photo‚Äîand every photo thereafter‚Äînow takes only 0.5 
seconds. This is especially handy for sports or any other fast-moving 
activity.  Just keep pressing the volume up key as fast as you can. 

Auto-focus and face detection mean snapshots of your friends and 
family automatically come out sharper and with better exposure. 
Using the Camera App 
The Camera app should be on your Home page‚Äî
usually on the first screen at the top. If you don‚Äôt 
see it, then swipe left or right until you find it. 

Touch the Camera icon and the shutter of the 
camera opens with an animation on your screen. 
Once the shutter opens, you will find controls 
along the top to set the Flash to On, Off, or Auto; 
Options to set the Grid overlay and HDR (high 
dynamic range) to On or Off; and a toggle to 
switch between the front-facing and rear-facing 
cameras. Along the bottom, you‚Äôll find a thumbnail 
to take you to the Camera Roll album, the Camera
button to take a picture, and a slider to switch 
between Still Photography and Video Recording 
modes. 


CHAPTER 19:  Working with Photos 
403 
TIP: You can also take a picture or start a video recording by pressing the Volume Up hardware 
button. 
Geo-Tagging 
Geo-tagging is a feature that puts your geographic approximate coordinates into the 
picture file. The iPod touch uses the Wi-Fi signal to help determine it‚Äôs approximate 
location.  If you upload your pictures to programs like Flickr, the coordinates of your 
picture can be used by your friends to locate you and locate the site where the picture 
was taken. 
NOTE: For Mac users, iPhoto uses geo-tagging to put photos into the Places category of iPhoto. 
If you have Location Services set to ON when you start the camera (see Chapter 1: 
‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù), you will be asked if it is OK to use your current location. 
To double-check this setting, do the following: 
1. Start your Settings app. 
2. Go to General. 
3. Touch Location Services. You will 
see a screen like the one here. 
4. Make sure the switch next to Camera 
is toggled to ON. 
 
 

CHAPTER 19: Working with Photos 
404 
Taking a Picture 
Taking a picture is as simple as pointing and shooting, but there are some adjustments 
that you can make if you choose. 
Once your camera is on, center your subject in 
the screen of your iPod touch. 
When you are ready to take a picture, just touch 
the Camera button along the bottom or press 
the Volume Up hardware button (the one with 
the + on it) on the side of your iPod touch. You 
will hear a shutter sound, and the screen will 
show an animation indicating that the picture is 
being taken. 
Once the picture is taken, it will drop down into 
the window in the lower-left corner. Touch that 
small thumbnail, and the Camera Roll album of 
your Photos app will load. 
 


Using the Zoom 
The iPod touch includes a 5x digital zoom.. 
NOTE: A digital zoom is never as clear as an analog zoom, so be aware that picture quality is 
usually degraded slightly when using the zoom. 
To use the zoom, just touch the screen 
with two fingers and pinch to zoom in or 
out. The further you spread your fingers 
apart, the further you will zoom out. 
Once the zoom begins, a Zoom slider 
will also appear to help you change the 
zoom level. 
 

CHAPTER 19:  Working with Photos 
405 
Camera Options 
To help you take better pictures, Apple has 
built in Grid lines. 
The Grid option overlays two horizontal 
and two vertical lines over the screen. This 
can help you properly compose your 
shots. It can also help you make sure 
faces and eyes look great for portraits, 
items look great for still life images, and 
the scenery is balanced for landscapes. 
 
 
 
Switching Cameras 
As mentioned previously, the iPod touch 
comes with two cameras: an 8.0 
megapixel camera on the back for most 
photography and a VGA camera (640 x 
480) on the front for self-portraits or for use 
in FaceTime video calls (see Chapter 10: 
‚ÄúVideo Messaging and Skype‚Äù). 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 19: Working with Photos 
406 
To switch between the cameras, do the following: 
1. Touch the Switch Camera icon from the Camera app. 
2. Wait for the camera to switch to the front-facing camera and line up the shot. 
3. Touch the Switch Camera icon again to switch back to the standard camera. 
TIP: Because of the placement of the front-facing camera, faces can look somewhat distorted. 
Try moving your face back a bit and adjusting the camera angle to get a better image. 
Viewing Pictures You Have Taken 
Your iPod touch will store pictures you take on the 
iPod touch in what is called your Camera Roll. You can 
access the Camera Roll from inside both the Camera 
and Photos apps. In the Camera app, touch the 
Pictures icon in the bottom-left corner of the Camera 
screen. 

Once you touch a picture to view, you can 
swipe through your pictures to see all the 
pictures in the Camera Roll. 

 To get back to the 
Camera Roll, press the Camera Roll button 
in the upper-left corner. 

 To take another picture, 
touch the Done button in the upper-right 
corner. 


CHAPTER 19:  Working with Photos

3. If you like the results, tap the Apply button at the top left. 
4. If you don‚Äôt like the results, tap each red eye again to remove the reduction. 
5. Tap Cancel to exit this mode. 

CHAPTER 19: Working with Photos 
408 
Finally, follow these steps to crop a photo: 
1. Tap the Crop 
 button on the bottom right. A nine section grid will appear 
over the photo. 
2. Touch an edge or corner of the grid and drag to make the crop area taller, shorter,

Getting Photos onto Your iPod touch 
You have many options for loading photos onto your device: 
 Sync using iCloud or iTunes: Probably the simplest way to load 
photos onto your iPod touch is to use iCloud or iTunes to sync photos 
from your computer (see Figure 19‚Äì1). We describe this in detail in 
Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync with iCloud, iTunes and More.‚Äù 
 Receive as email attachments: While this is not useful for large 
numbers of pictures, it works well for one or even a few photos. Check 
out Chapter 16: ‚ÄúCommunicate with Email‚Äù for more details about how 
to save attachments. (Once saved, these images show up in the 
Camera Roll album.) 
 Save images from the Web: Sometimes you‚Äôll see a great image on a 
web site. Press and hold it to see the pop-up menu, and then select 
Save Image. (Like other saved images, these end up in the Camera 
Roll album.) 
 Download images from within an app: A good example of this is the 
wallpaper image shown in Chapter 8: ‚ÄúPersonalize and Secure.‚Äù 
 Sync with iPhoto (for Mac users): If you use a Mac computer, your 
iPod touch will most likely sync automatically with iPhoto. Here are a 
few steps to get the sync feature in iPhoto up and running: 
1. Connect your iPod touch and start the iTunes app. 
2. Go to the Photo tab along the top row of Sync Options. 
3. Choose the Albums, Events, Faces, or Places you want to keep in sync 
with the iPod touch.

 Drag and drop (for Windows users): Once you connect your iPod 
touch to your Windows computer, it will appear in Windows Explorer 
as a portable device, as shown in Figure 19‚Äì2. Follow these steps to 
drag and drop photos between your iPod touch and computer: 
1. Double-click the iPod touch image under Portable Devices to 
open it. 
2. Double-click Internal Storage to open it. 
3. Double-click DCIM to open it. 
4. Next, you may see one or more folders with strange names like: 
823WGTMA, 860OKMZO, and 965YOKDJ.  Try double-clicking to 
open each one.  One of these will have the photos or videos you 
seek.

Viewing Your Photos 
Now that your photos are on your iPod touch, you have a few very cool ways to look 
through them and show them to others. 
Launching from the Photos Icon 
If you like using your Photos app, you might want to 
place its icon in your Bottom Dock for easy access if 
it‚Äôs not already there (see Chapter 6: ‚ÄúIcons and 
Folders‚Äù). 
To get started with photos, touch the Photos icon. 
The first screen shows your photo albums, which were 
created when you set up your iPod touch and synced 
with iCloud or iTunes. In Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync with iCloud, 
iTunes and More,‚Äù we showed you how to choose 
which photos to sync with your iPod touch. As you 
make changes to the library on your computer, they will
be automatically updated on your iPod touch. 
If you‚Äôre using iCloud‚Äôs Photo Stream feature, this is 
also where you‚Äôll find your Photo Stream images.

Working with Individual Pictures 
Once you locate the picture you want to view, just 
tap it. The picture then loads onto the screen. 
NOTE: Your pictures will not usually take up the full 
screen on your iPod touch if they were shot in 
Landscape mode. 
 
TIP: The picture here was shot in Landscape mode; 
to see it in full screen, simply turn your iPod touch 
on its side or double-tap it. 
 

CHAPTER 19:  Working with Photos 
415 
Moving Between Pictures 
The swipe gesture is used to move from one 
picture to the next. Just swipe your finger left or 
right across the screen, and you can move 
through your pictures. 
TIP: Drag your finger slowly to move more 
gradually through the picture library.
When you reach the end of an album, just tap the 
screen once and you‚Äôll see a tab in the upper-left 
corner that has the name of the photo album. 
Touch that tab and you‚Äôll return to the thumbnail 
page of that particular album. 
 
To get back to your main photo album page, 
touch the button that says Albums in the top-left 
corner. 
 
Zooming in and out of Pictures 
As described in the ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù section of the book, there are two ways to zoom in 
and out of pictures on your iPod touch: double-tapping and pinching. 
Swipe 
To view 
next 
picture.

CHAPTER 19: Working with Photos 
416 
Double-Tapping 
As the name implies, double-tapping is a quick double-tap on the screen to zoom in on 
the picture (see Figure 19‚Äì3). You will zoom in on the spot where you double-tap. To 
zoom out, just double-tap once more. 
See Chapter 1: ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù for more information on double-tapping. 
 
Figure 19‚Äì3. Double-tapping a picture to zoom in on it 
Pinching 
Also as described in Chapter 1: ‚ÄúGetting Started,‚Äù pinching is a much more precise form 
of zooming in. While double-tapping zooms in or out only to one set level, pinching really 
allows you to zoom in or out just a little bit or quite a lot. 
To pinch, hold your thumb and forefinger close together and then slowly (while touching 
the screen) separate them, making the picture larger. To zoom out, start with your 
thumb and forefinger apart and move them together. 
NOTE: Once you have activated the zoom using either method, you will not be able to swipe 
easily through your pictures until you return the picture to its standard size.

Viewing a Slideshow 
You can view the pictures in your photo album as a slideshow if you so 
desire. Just tap the screen once to bring up the on-screen soft keys. In 
the center, you will see a Slideshow Play button‚Äîtouch it once to start 
the slideshow. You can start the slideshow from any picture you are 
viewing.  
 
Selecting Photos in the Settings app lets you adjust how long each picture remains on 
the screen and other settings such as Repeat and Shuffle (see Figure 19‚Äì4). To end the 
slideshow, just tap the screen.

Using a Picture As Your iPod touch Wallpaper 
We show you how to select and use a picture as your iPod touch wallpaper (and other 
wallpaper options) in Chapter 8: ‚ÄúPersonalize and Secure.‚Äù 
NOTE: You can have different pictures for your Home screen and Lock screen, or you can use 
the same picture for both. 
Emailing or Tweeting a Picture 
As long as you have an active Internet connection (see Chapter 4: 
‚ÄúConnect to the Network‚Äù), you can send any picture in your photo 
collection via email or post it to Twitter. Tap the Options button on 
the thumbnail bar‚Äîthis is the button furthest to the left on the 
bottom row of soft keys. If you don‚Äôt see the icons, tap the screen 
once. 
 
To mail the picture, choose the Email Photo option and the Mail app will automatically 
launch. 
Tap the To field as you did in Chapter 16: ‚ÄúCommunicate with Email,‚Äù and then select 
the contact to receive the picture. Tap the blue Plus Sign (+) button to add a contact. 
Type in a subject and a message, and then touch 
Send in the upper-right corner‚Äîthat‚Äôs all there is 
to it.

Share, Copy, Print, or Delete Several Pictures at 
Once 
If you have several pictures you want to email, message, copy, print, or delete at the 
same time, you can do so from the thumbnail view: 
1. Tap the Action button at the bottom 
left. 
 
 
1. Tap the pictures you want to select. 
2. If you tap a picture by accident, just 
tap it again to deselect it.  
3. Choose an action from the bottom 
of the screen: Share (email, 
message, or print), Copy, Add To (a 
different photo album), or Delete. 
 
 
NOTE: The Copy function allows you to copy and paste multiple pictures into an email message or 
other app. Share renames the image to photo.png, while copy-and-paste adds .png to the DCIM 
folder file name. 
At the time of publishing, you could not share more than one video, nor could you share more 
than five pictures. This may change in future iterations of the software. 

CHAPTER 19: Working with Photos 
420 
Assigning a Picture to a Contact 
Chapter 17: ‚ÄúContacts and Notes‚Äù shows you how to add a picture when editing a 
contact. You can also find a picture you like and assign it to a contact. Begin by finding 
the photo you want to use. 
As you did when setting the wallpaper and emailing a photo, tap the Action 
button‚Äîthe one furthest to the right of the upper row of soft keys. If you 
don‚Äôt see the icons, tap the screen once. 
 
When you touch the Action button, you‚Äôll see a 
drop-down list of choices: Email Photo, 
Message, Assign to Contact, Use as 
Wallpaper, Tweet, and Print. 
Touch the Assign to Contact button. 
 

CHAPTER 19:  Working with Photos 
421 
You will see your contacts on the screen. You can 
either perform a search using the Search bar at 
the top or just scroll through your contacts. 
Once you find the contact that you would like to 
add as a recipient to the picture, touch that name. 
You will then see the Move and Scale screen. 
Tap and drag the picture to move it; use pinch to 
zoom in or out. 
When you have this set just how you want it, 
touch the Set Photo button to assign the picture 
to that contact. 
                 
 
Type a few letters 
of the first, last or 
company name‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ then tap 
to select the 
Contact.
Drag to 
Move and
Pinch to 
Zoom
‚Ä¶ then tap 
here

CHAPTER 19: Working with Photos 
422 
NOTE: You will return to your Photo Library, not to the contact. If you want to double-check that 
the picture was set to your contact, then exit the Photo app, start the Contact app, and search 
for that contact. 
Viewing a Photo on Your Apple TV 
Chapter 5: ‚ÄúAirPlay and Bluetooth‚Äù shows 
you how to use Apple‚Äôs AirPlay feature to 
stream videos from your iPod touch to 
your Apple TV over your local Wi-Fi 
network. Apple has built the same 
functionality into the Photos app, so you 
can easily beam your pictures to your big 
screen TV. 
Follow these steps to send your photos to 
your Apple TV: 
1.
Tap the AirPlay button. 
2.
Choose Apple TV from the source 
list. 
To move to the next photo, simply swipe 
from right to left, just as you would to 
switch photos on your iPod touch. To 
move to the previous photo, swipe back 
from left to right. 
To go back to viewing photos on your iPod 
touch, tap the AirPlay button again and 
choose iPod touch from the source list. 

CHAPTER 19:  Working with Photos 
423 
Deleting a Picture 
You might wonder why you can‚Äôt delete some pictures from your iPod touch (the Trash 
Can icon is missing). 
For example, you‚Äôll notice that the Trash 
Can icon is not visible for any photo that 
is synced from iTunes. You can delete 
such pictures only from your computer 
library. The next time you sync your iPod 
touch, they will be deleted. 
 
When you are looking through pictures in your Saved Photos (this folder is not synced 
with iTunes, but is instead comprised of pictures you save from email messages or 
download from the Web), then you‚Äôll see the Trash Can icon in the bottom icon bar. 
This Trash Can icon does not appear when you are viewing pictures from your Photos 
Library or other synced albums. 
If you don‚Äôt see the bottom row of icons, tap the 
photo once to activate them, and then tap the Trash 
Can icon. You will be prompted with the option to 
delete the picture. 
Touch Delete Photo and the picture will be deleted 
from your iPod touch. 
Trash Can Icon 
is Only Visible 
in ‚ÄúCamera
Roll.‚Äù

Downloading Pictures from Web Sites 
We have shown you how you can transfer pictures from your computer to your iPod 
touch and save them from email messages. You can also download and save pictures 
right from the Web onto your iPod touch. 
CAUTION: We strongly encourage you to respect image copyright laws as you download and 
save images from the Web. Unless the web site indicates an image is free, you should check 
with the web site owner before downloading and saving any pictures. 
Finding a Picture to Download 
The iPod touch makes it easy to copy and save 
images from web sites. This can be handy when 
you are looking for a new image to use as 
wallpaper on your iPod touch. 
First, tap the Safari web browser icon and type a 
search for iPod touch wallpaper to locate a few 
sites that might have some interesting 
possibilities. (See Chapter 15: ‚ÄúSafari Web 
Browser‚Äù for help with this topic.) 
Once you find a picture you want to download and save, tap and hold it to bring up a new 
menu of options that includes Save Image (among others), as shown in Figure 19‚Äì5. 
Choose this option to save the picture in your Saved Photos album.

Maps 
Mapping on your iPod touch is very convenient and pretty amazing. As we explore the 
power of the Maps app in this chapter, you‚Äôll see how to find your location on a map 
and get directions to just about anywhere. You‚Äôll also learn how to switch between the 
Standard, Satellite, and Hybrid views. You‚Äôll also see how, if you need to find the best 
route to somewhere, you can check out the traffic using the Show Traffic button in 
Maps options. If you want to find the closest pizza restaurant, golf course, or hotel to 
your destination, that‚Äôs easy, too. And you can use Google‚Äôs Street View right from your 
iPod touch to help you get to your destination. It is easy to add an address you have 
mapped to your contacts.  
Getting Started with Maps 
The beauty of the iPod touch is that its apps are designed to work with 
one another. You‚Äôve already seen how your contacts are linked to the 
Maps app; just look back at Chapter 17: ‚ÄúContacts and Notes.‚Äù 
The Maps app is powered by Google Maps, the leader in mobile mapping technology. 
Maps lets you locate your position, get directions, search for things nearby, see traffic, 
and much more. 
Simply touch the Maps icon to get started.   
NOTE: You need to be connected to a Wi-Fi network in order for Maps to work.

CHAPTER 20:  Maps 
428 
Determining Your Location (the Blue Dot) 
When you start the Maps app, you can 
have it begin at your current location. 
Follow these steps to use your current 
location as the default starting location: 
1. Tap the small blue Arrow icon at 
the lower-left corner. 
 
2. Maps will ask to use your current 
location‚Äîtouch OK or Don‚Äôt 
Allow. 
We suggest choosing OK, which 
makes it much easier to find 
directions from or to your current 
location. 
 
 
Changing Your Map Views 
The default view for Maps is the Standard view, a basic map that shows a generic 
background overlaid with street names. Maps can also show you a Satellite view or a 
combination of the Satellite and Standard views called Hybrid. Finally, the List view is 
handy if you‚Äôve searched for something that provided multiple results, like local coffee 
shops. It is also handy if you‚Äôve asked for directions to a location. You can switch 
among all the views by following these steps: 
1. Tap the turned-up edge of the map in the lower-right corner. 
2. The corner of the map turns up to reveal buttons for views, traffic, pins, 
and more. 
Find my 
Current 
Location
If you see a circle 
around the dot, 
then your location 
is approximate.
The ‚ÄúBlue 
Dot‚Äù = Your 
Location

CHAPTER 20:  Maps 
429 
3. Tap the view you‚Äôd like to switch to (see Figure 20‚Äì1): 
 Standard is a regular map with street names. 
 Satellite is a satellite picture with no street names. 
 Hybrid is a combination of the Satellite and Standard views; 
that is, a Satellite view with street names. 
 List is available only when your search produces multiple results 
(like ‚ÄúStarbucks‚Äù) or you‚Äôve asked for directions. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 20‚Äì1. Various views available in the Maps app: From upper left: Standard, Satellite, Hybrid and List. 

CHAPTER 20:  Maps 
430 
Checking Traffic 
Not only does your Maps app tell you how to get 
somewhere, but it can also check traffic along the 
way. This feature is supported only in the United 
States for now. Follow these steps to check the 
traffic for a given route: 
1. Tap the lower-right corner of the 
map to see the options. 
2. Tap Show Traffic. 
On a highway, if there is a traffic situation, you 
usually see yellow lights instead of green ones. 
Sometimes, the yellow lights might be flashing to 
alert you to traffic delays. 
You may even see Construction Worker icons to 
indicate construction zones. 
Maps uses color on major streets and highways to 
indicate the speed that traffic is moving at: 
 Green = 50 MPH or more 
 Yellow = 25‚Äì50 MPH 
 Red = Less than 25 MPH 
 Gray (or no color) = No traffic data 
currently available 

CHAPTER 20:  Maps 
431 
Searching for Anything  
Because Maps is tied to Google Maps, you can search for and find just about anything: 
a specific address, type of business, city, or other point of interest, as shown in Figure 
20‚Äì2. Follow these steps to search for a specific location: 
1. Touch the Search bar in the top-right corner of the screen. 
2. Type in the address, point 
of interest, or town and 
state you would like to 
map on your iPod touch. 
 
Google Maps Search Tips 
You can enter just about anything in the Search bar, including the following: 
 First name, last name, or company name (to match your Contacts list) 
 123 Main Street, City (some or all of a street address) 
 Orlando Airport (to find an airport) 
 Plumber, painter, or roofer (any part of a business name or trade) 
 Golf courses + city (to find local golf courses) 
 Movies + city or ZIP/postal code (to find local movie theaters) 
 Pizza 32174 (to search for local pizza restaurants in ZIP code 32174) 
 95014 (the ZIP code for Apple Computer‚Äôs headquarters in California, 
United States) 
 Apress

To use numbers, tap the 123 key on the keyboard. For letters, tap the ABC key to switch 
back to a letter keyboard. 
Mapping Options 
Now that your address is on the Maps screen, follow these steps to access the available 
options: 
1. Touch the blue Arrow icon 
 next to the address to see some of 
these options. 
2. If you have mapped one of your contacts, you‚Äôll see the contact details, 
as shown in Figure 20‚Äì3. Maps will also pull up contact information for 
specific searches. You can also get directions, share a location, or add 
a location as a bookmark. 
NOTE: You can also tap and hold the address to bring up the Copy pop-up menu. 
Type a name, address or 
search (e.g. ‚Äúpizza 32174‚Äù) 
Tap to select matching 
names that appear.
Or, tap ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù to 
start the search.

Working with Bookmarks 
Bookmarks in Maps work much as they do in Safari. A bookmark simply creates a 
record of places you‚Äôve visited or mapped and want to remember in the future. It is 
always easier to look at a bookmark than to perform a new search. 
Adding a New Bookmark 
Bookmarking a location is a great way to simplify finding a place again: 
1.
Map a location, as shown in Figure 20‚Äì4. 
2.
Touch the blue Information icon next to the address. 
3.
Touch Add to Bookmarks. 
Tap the Arrow for 
more options.

4. Edit the bookmark name to make is short and recognizable‚Äîin this 
case, we edited the address to simply say Gloria‚Äôs Store. 
5. When you are done, just touch Save in the top-right corner. 
TIP: You can search for bookmark names just as you search for names in Contacts.

Accessing and Editing Your Bookmarks 
To view your bookmarks, follow these steps: 
1. Tap the Bookmarks icon next to the 
Search window in the top row. 
2. Tap any bookmark to immediately jump 
to it. 
3. Tap the Edit button at the top of the 
bookmarks to edit or delete your 
bookmarks. 
a. To reorder the bookmarks, touch 
and drag the right edge of each 
bookmark up or down. 
b. To edit the name of a bookmark, 
touch it and retype the name. After 
editing the name, touch the 
Bookmarks button in the top left 
to get back to your list of 
bookmarks. 
c. To delete a bookmark, swipe to the 
left or right on the bookmark, and 
then tap the Delete button. 
4. Tap the Done button when you are 
finished editing your bookmarks. 
 
Adding a Mapped Location to Contacts 
It is easy to add a location you mapped to your Contacts list: 
1. Map an address. 
2. Tap the Arrow/Information icon. 
3. Tap Add to Contacts.  
 
4. Tap either Create a New Contact or Add to Existing Contact. 

CHAPTER 20:  Maps 
436 
5. If you choose Add to Existing Contact, you can then scroll through or 
search your contacts and select a name. The address will automatically 
be added to that contact. 
Searching for Establishments Near You 
Follow these steps to search for establishments 
around your current location: 
1. Map a location on the map or 
use the blue dot for your current 
location. 
2. Tap the Search window. Let‚Äôs 
say you want to search for the 
closest pizza restaurants, so you 
type ‚Äúpizza.‚Äù This will map all 
local pizza restaurants. 
 
3. Notice that each mapped location may have a Street View icon on the 
left and an Information icon on the right. 
4. You can double-tap to zoom in, or pinch the screen open or closed to 
zoom in or out. 
5. Just as with any mapped location, touching the blue Information icon 
brings up all the details, including the pizza restaurant‚Äôs phone number, 
address, and web site as shown in Figure 20‚Äì5. 
6. If you want directions to the restaurant, just touch Directions to Here, 
and a route is instantly calculated.

Dropping a Pin 
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre looking at the map, and you find something you‚Äôd like to set either as a 
bookmark or as a destination. 
In this example, we are zooming in and looking around the greater Boston area. We 
stumble upon Fenway Park and decide it would be great to add it to our bookmarks, so 
we drop a pin on it. Follow these steps to drop a pin on a map: 
1. Map a location or move the map to a 
location where you‚Äôd like to drop the pin. 
2. Tap the lower-right corner of the map.  
 
3. Tap Drop Pin. You can also simply touch 
and hold a location on the map to drop 
the pin. 
4. Now, drag the pin around the map by 
touching and holding it.  
 
5. To remove a dropped pin or do 
other things, tap the blue Arrow 
icon 
 next to the pop-up 
above the pin.  If the pop-up went 
away, tap the pin to bring It back. 
 

CHAPTER 20:  Maps 
439 
6. From the Info screen, you can get 
directions, Remove Pin, Add to 
Contacts, Share Location, or 
Add to Bookmarks. 
 
TIP: Finding the Street Address of any Location on the Map 
When you drop a pin, Google Maps will show you the actual street address. This is very handy if 
you find a location by looking at the Satellite or Hybrid view, but need to get the actual street 
address. 
Dropping a pin is also a great way to keep track of where you parked, which is especially helpful 
in an unfamiliar location. 
Using Street View 
Google Street View (see Figure 20‚Äì6) is a really fun feature in Maps on the iPod touch. 
Google has been hard at work photographing just about every address across the 
United States and elsewhere. The pictures are then fed into its database, and that‚Äôs 
what shows up when you want to see a picture of your destination or waypoint. 
NOTE: Google Street View is in a small number of countries now: much of North America, 
western Europe, Australia, and now South Africa. 
If there is a Street View available, you will 
see a small orange Person icon to the left 
of the address or bookmark on the map. 
 

CHAPTER 20:  Maps 
440 
In this example, we wanted to check the Street View of the store of Gloria, Gary‚Äôs wife, 
on Cape Cod: 
1. To map the address, we tapped the work address under Gloria‚Äôs name 
on our Contacts list. We could have mapped it by typing an address into 
the Search window, by searching for a type of business, or by touching 
the address in the Contacts app. 
2. The Street View icon is shown to the left of Gloria‚Äôs name. 
3. We tapped the icon to immediately shift to a Street View of the address. 
What is very cool is that we can navigate around the screen in a 360-
degree rotation by swiping left, right, or even up or down, looking at the 
places next to and across the street from our destination. 
4. To return to the map, we just touched the lower-right corner of the screen. 
 
Figure 20‚Äì6. Using Google Street View 
Getting Directions 
One of the most useful functions of the Maps app is that you can easily find directions 
to or from any location. Let‚Äôs say we want to get directions from our current location 
(Gloria‚Äôs store) to Fenway Park in Boston. 
Touch to Rotate 
Map. Tap to 
Return to Map  
View.

CHAPTER 20:  Maps 
441 
Tap the Current Location Button First 
To find directions to or from your current location, you don‚Äôt have to waste time typing 
your current address‚Äîthe iPod touch will assume you want directions from where you 
are unless you specify otherwise. You may need to tap the Location button a few times 
until you see the blue dot on the screen. 
Now you can do one of two things: 
 Tap the Directions button at the bottom. 
 Touch the blue Arrow as we did previously, and then select 
Directions from Here (see Figure 20‚Äì7).

Choosing Start or End Location 
Follow these steps to select a Start or End location and 
then choose a suggested route: 
1. Touch the blue Arrow icon above the pin. 
2. Tap Directions From Here. 
3. Tap the Bookmarks button 
4. Tap Bookmarks, Recents, or Contacts to 
find your destination. In this case, we tapped 
Bookmarks and then Fenway Park. 
NOTE: As soon as you touch the Directions From Here 
button, your recent searches will be automatically 
displayed (see Figure 20‚Äì5). You can also touch the 
Destination box and type in a destination. 
 
 
5. After you select your destination, the 
routing screen takes you to an 
overview screen. In our case, we see 
the routing screen to get from Apple's 
1 Infinite Loop headquarters to the 
Palo Alto Apple Store. 
6. A green pushpin is dropped at the start 
location, and a red one is dropped at 
the end location‚ÄîFenway Park, in our 
example. 
7. A bright blue line will connect the two 
pins, showing you the route. If there is 
more than one route, others will be 
indicated in light blue. 
8. Tap a gray route to select it. Once it‚Äôs 
selected, it will turn bright blue, and 
any other routes will fade to light blue.

Looking at the Route 
Before you start the trip, you will see a 
Start button in the upper-right corner of 
the screen. Tap the Start button, and the 
routing directions begin. The Start button 
changes to Arrow buttons that allow you 
to move between the steps in the trip. 
As Figure 20‚Äì8 shows, you can look at the route either as a path on the map or as a list.

You can also tap the Page Curl button on the 
bottom-right, then the List 
 button, 
which will show detailed step-by-step directions. 
Switching Between Routes 
As noted in Steps 6 and 7 of the preceding example, 
if more than one route is available, the Maps app will 
mark its best recommendation with a bright blue line 
and flag it as Route 1. If other routes are also 
available, Maps will mark them with a light blue line. 
Tapping a gray line will turn it bright blue and flag it 
with its corresponding number‚ÄîRoute 2, for 
example. 
If you know from recent experience that construction or something else is making Route 
1 less than desirable, or you need to stop somewhere on the way that‚Äôs off the 
recommended Route 1, then switching to a different route is a great option.

Switching Between Driving, Transit, and Walking 
Directions 
Before you start your directions, you can choose whether you are driving, using public 
transportation, or walking by tapping the icons on the left side of the blue bar at the top 
of the directions screen, as shown in Figure 21‚Äì9.

Reversing the Route 
To reverse the route, touch the Reverse 
 button, which is at the top, between

on your own or if your route uses lots of one-way streets.

Maps Options 
 
Currently, the only setting that affects your Maps 
app is Location Services, which is critical for 
determining your current location. Follow these 
steps to adjust the settings for the Maps app: 
1. Touch the Settings icon. 
2. Tap Location Services.  
3. Make sure the Location Services switch to 
the ON position, so that Maps can 
approximate your location. 
NOTE: Keeping the Location Services switch 
ON will reduce battery life by a small amount. If 
you never use Maps or care about your location, 
then set it to OFF to save your battery life.

                    Chapter 
iTunes on Your Device 
In this chapter, you will learn how to locate, buy, and download media using the iTunes 
app right on your iPod touch. With iTunes, you will be able to download music, movies, 
TV shows, podcasts, and audiobooks. You will also learn about free educational content 
from leading universities from the iTunes U section on iTunes, as well as how to redeem 
iTunes gift cards. 
Some of us still remember going to the record store when that new single or album 
came out. It was an exciting feeling to look at all the music we wanted, browsing first 
through all the vinyl albums, then tapes, and, finally, CDs. 
Those days are long gone with the iPod touch. Music, movies, TV shows, and more are 
available right from the iPod touch itself. 
iTunes is a music, video, TV, podcast, and more store. Virtually every type of media you 
can consume on your iPod touch is available for purchase or rent (and often for free) 
right from the iTunes store. 
Getting Started with iTunes  
Earlier in this book, we showed you how to get your music from iTunes on your 
computer into your iPod touch (see Chapter 3: "Sync With iCloud, iTunes, and More"). 
One of the great things about iTunes is that the store makes it very easy to buy or obtain 
music, videos, podcasts, and audiobooks, and then use them within minutes right on 
your iPod touch. 
The iPod touch allows you to access the iTunes site (the mobile version) right on your 
device. After you purchase or request free items, they will be downloaded to your Music 
or Videos app on the iPod touch.  If you have have iCloud and have turned on automatic 
downloads, any music you buy will automatically be downloaded to your other iOS 
devices and iTunes on your PC. Movies will transfer the next time you sync with your 
desktop ITunes library.

CHAPTER 21: iTunes on Your Device 
448 
A Network Connection Is Required 
You do need an active Internet connection in order to access the iTunes store. Check 
out Chapter 4: "Connect to the Network" to learn more about this. 
Starting iTunes 
When you first received your iPod touch, iTunes was one of the icons on 
the first Home screen page. Touch the iTunes icon, and you will be taken 
to the mobile version of the iTunes Store. 
NOTE: The iTunes app changes frequently. Since the iTunes app is really a web site, it is likely 
to change somewhat between the time we wrote this book and when you are looking at it on 
your iPod touch. Some of the screen images or buttons may look slightly different than the ones 
shown in this book. 
Also, iTunes content can vary considerably from country to country. Depending on where you 
live, you might not have access to movies, TV shows, or other media. However, Apple continues 
to add iTunes content to more and more regions, so be sure to check back occasionally. 
Navigating iTunes 
The iTunes app uses icons similar to other 
programs on the iPod touch, so getting 
around is quite easy. There are three 
buttons at the top and five soft keys at the 
bottom to help you.  You can customize 
these soft keys and we show you how In 
the next section.. Notice in the image to 
the right the soft keys at the bottom. 
Scrolling in iTunes is just like scrolling in 
any other program; move your finger up or 
down to look at the selections available. 
 
 

CHAPTER 21:  iTunes on Your Device 
449 
Customizing iTunes Soft Keys  
It‚Äôs simple to customize the soft keys 
shown at the bottom of the iTunes screen.  
Tap the More soft key in the lower left 
corner.  Then tap Edit in the upper right 
corner.   
 
Now, you can change the soft keys by 
dragging and dropping any of the icons 
from the top down onto the soft key 
toolbar at the bottom.  Any item you drop 
will replace the icon that was currently 
there. 
Tap Done to complete the changes and 
return to iTunes. 
 

CHAPTER 21: iTunes on Your Device 
450 
Finding Music with New Releases, Top Tens, and 
Genres 
Along the top of the screen of the iTunes music store are three buttons: Featured, Top 
Charts, and Genius. By default, you are shown the Featured selections when you start 
iTunes. 
Top Tens: The Popular Stuff 
If you like to know what is popular in a particular 
category, you will want to browse the categories 
under Top Tens. Tap Top Tens at the top, and 
then tap a category or genre to see what is popular 
in that category. 
CAUTION: Items in the Top Tens categories are 
selling well, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they will 
necessarily appeal to you. Always preview an item 
and check out its reviews before you pay for it. 
 
Genres: Types of Music 
Touch the Genres button to browse music based 
on a genre. This is particularly helpful if you have a 
favorite type of music and would like to browse 
just that category. 
There is an extensive list of genres to browse; just 
scroll down the list as you would in any other iPod 
touch app. 
 
Go ahead and browse through the music until you see something that you would like to 
preview or buy. 

CHAPTER 21:  iTunes on Your Device 
451 
Browsing for Videos (Movies) 
Touch the Movies, TV Shows, or Movie 
Videos buttons on the top to browse all 
the video-related items. 
 
     
You can also use your finger to scroll all 
the way to the bottom of the page to 
check out the links there, including these 
links in particular: 
 Top Tens 
 Genres 
 
TIP: At the very bottom of most pages, 
you can also Redeem a gift card or log out 
of your Apple ID and log into another 
Apple ID account.  This is useful if 
someone (maybe your children) has 
changed the Apple ID and you want to get 
back to yours. 
 

CHAPTER 21: iTunes on Your Device 
452 
Tap any movie or video to see more details or 
preview the selection. You have the option to 
rent or buy some movies and TV shows: 
 Rentals: Some movies are 
available for rent for a set 
number of days. Click this 
button to rent a title. 
NOTE: The rental period in the US is 24 hours, 
and the rental period in Canada is 48 hours. 
The rental periods for other countries may vary 
slightly. 
 Buy: Clicking this button 
allows you to purchase and 
own the movie or TV show 
forever. 
Finding TV Shows 
When you‚Äôre done checking out the movies, tap 
the TV Shows button at the top to see what is 
available from your favorite shows. 
 
   
 
When you tap a TV series, you will see the individual episodes available. Tap any 
episode to check out the 30-second preview (see Chapter 14: "Viewing Videos" for more 
on watching videos). When you‚Äôre finished with the preview, tap the Done button. 

CHAPTER 21:  iTunes on Your Device 
453 
When you are ready, you can buy an individual episode or the entire TV series. Many, 
but not all, TV series allow you to purchase individual episodes as shown in Figure 21‚Äì1. 
For example, you might want to get your fix of Modern Family and see the pilot episode 
that you missed. You can do this quickly and easily on your iPod touch. 
Figure 21‚Äì1. Buying a TV season or episode 
NOTE: There is also a Free TV Episode category, where you can get samples and bonus content. 
Audiobooks in iTunes 
Audiobooks are a great way to enjoy books without having to read them. Some of the 
narrators are so fun to listen to that it is almost like watching a movie. For example, the 
narrator of the Harry Potter series can do dozens of truly amazing voices. We 
recommend that you try out an audiobook on your iPod touch; audiobooks are 
especially great when you are on an airplane and want to escape from the rest of the 
passengers, but don‚Äôt want to have the light on. 
TIP: If you‚Äôre a big audiobook listener, getting an Audible.com subscription can get you the same 
content at cheaper prices. 
Tap any episode to see

If you are an audiobook aficionado, be sure to 
check out the Audiobooks section in iTunes. 
You can click the one of the top three buttons to 
browse the following areas in Audiobooks: 
 Featured 
 Top Tens 
 Categories 
iTunes U: Great Educational Content 
If you like educational content, then check out the 
iTunes U section.You will be able to see whether 
your university, college, or school has its own 
section. 
One good example we discovered in just a few minutes of browsing was a panel 
discussion with three Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economists moderated by Paul Solman (the 
economic correspondent for the PBS News Hour). You can find the podcast by 
navigating through the following menus: iTunes U > Universities & Colleges > Boston 
University > BUNIVERSE - Business > Audio. Like much of the content in iTunes U, this 
podcast is free! 
If you are in a location with a good wireless signal, you can tap the title of the audio or 
video item, and then listen to or watch it streaming. If your signal gets interrupted, 
however, you will lose your place in the video. There are many advantages to actually 
downloading the file (if possible) for later viewing, not least of which is that you get more 
control over the video-watching experience. 

CHAPTER 21:  iTunes on Your Device 
455 
Download for Offline Viewing 
If you know you are going to be out of wireless coverage for a while, such as on an 
airplane or in the subway, you will want to download the content for later offline viewing 
or listening. Tap the Free button to change it to a Download button, and then tap it 
again. You can then monitor the download progress (some larger videos may take ten 
minutes or more to complete) by tapping the Downloads button at the bottom right of 
the screen. When the download is complete, the item will show up in the correct area of 
your Music or Videos app. 
Searching iTunes 
Sometimes you have a good idea of what you want, but you are unsure where it is 
located or perhaps you don‚Äôt feel like browsing or navigating all the menus. The Search 
tool is for you. 
In the top-right corner of the iTunes app (as in 
virtually every other iPod touch app), you have a 
Search window. 
Touch Search, and the Search window and the 
on-device keyboard will pop up. Once you start 
typing, the iPod touch will begin to match your 
entry with possibilities. 
Type in the artist, song name, video name, podcast name, or album you are searching 
for, and the iPod touch will display detailed matches. You can be as general or as 
specific as you like. If you are just looking to browse all particular songs by an artist, 
type the artist‚Äôs name. If you want a specific song or album, enter the full name of the 
song or album. 
When you locate the song or album name, simply touch it and you will be taken to the 
purchase page. 
Tap here, then 
type the Artist, 
Song, Movie 
or Show you 
are looking for. 
Touch the correct 
Artist, Album, etc. 

CHAPTER 21: iTunes on Your Device 
456 
Purchasing or Renting Music, Videos, Podcasts, and 
More 
Once you locate a song, video, TV show, or album, you can touch the Buy or (if you see 
it) Rent button. This will cause your media to start downloading. (If the content is free, 
then you will see the Free button, which turns into a Download button when you tap it.) 
We suggest you view or listen to the preview, as well as check out the customer reviews 
first, unless you are absolutely sure you want to purchase the item. 
NOTE: You can also purchase tones for your iPod touch from the iTunes store.  
Previewing Music 
Touch either the title of the song or its track 
number to the left of the song title; this will flip 
over the album cover and launch the preview 
window. 
You will hear a representative clip of 90 seconds 
of the song. 
Touch the Stop button and the track number will 
again be displayed. 
Touch the song 
track number 
preview it. 
Touch here to stop 

CHAPTER 21:  iTunes on Your Device 
457 
Check Out Customer Reviews 
Many items in iTunes offer customer 
reviews. The reviews range from a low 
of one star to a high of five stars. 
CAUTION: Be aware that the reviews 
can have explicit language. Many of 
the reviews are clean; however, 
some do contain explicit language 
that may not be caught by the iTunes 
store right away. 
Reading the reviews can give you a 
fairly good idea of whether you would 
like to buy the item. 
 
Previewing a Video, TV Show, or Music Video 
Pretty much everything on iTunes offers 
a preview. Sometimes you will see a 
Preview button, as with music videos 
and movies. TV shows are a little 
different; you tap the episode title in 
order to see the 30-second preview. 
We highly recommend checking out the 
reviews, as well as trying the preview 
before purchasing items on iTunes. 
Typical movie previews or trailers will be 
longer than 30 seconds. Some are two 
and a half minutes or longer.

Purchasing a Song, Video, or Other Item 
Once you are sure you want to purchase a 
song, video, or other item, follow these steps 
to buy it: 
1. Touch the Price button of the song 
or the Buy button. 
2. The button will change and turn 
into a green Buy Now, Buy Song, 
Buy Single, or Buy Album button. 
3. Tap the Buy button. 
 
4. You will see an animated icon 
jump into the shopping cart. 
Type in your iTunes 
password and touch OK to 
complete the sale. 
 
Tap the More button, then tap Downloads  to 
see the download progress for each song on 
the album. 
The song or album will then become part of 
your music library, and it will be synced with 
your computer the next time you connect 
your iPod touch to iTunes on your computer.  
Note: iCloud will do this sync automatically. 
After the download is complete, you will see 
the new song, audiobook, podcast, or iTunes 
U podcast inside the correct category within 
your Music app. 
NOTE: Purchased videos and iTunes U videos 
go into the Videos app on your iPod touch 
and podcasts will show up in the Music app. 
 

CHAPTER 21:  iTunes on Your Device

Podcasts in iTunes 
Podcasts are usually a series of audio segments; these 
may be updated frequently (such as hourly news reports 
from National Public Radio) or not updated at all (such 
as a recording of a one-time lecture on a particular 
topic). 
 
You can click the top three buttons to browse the 
podcast categories in iTunes: 
 What‚Äôs Hot 
 Top Tens 
 Categories 
Downloading a Podcast 
Podcasts are available in video and audio varieties. When you locate a podcast, just 
touch the title of the podcast (see Figure 21‚Äì2). Luckily, most podcasts are free. If it is 
free, you will see a Free button instead of the typical Buy button.

When you touch the button, it turns into a green Download 
button. Touch Download and an animated icon jumps into your 
Downloads icon at the bottom bar of soft keys. A small number 
displayed in red reflects the number of files downloading. 
 
The Download Icon: Stopping and Deleting Downloads 
As you download items, they appear in your 
Downloads screen. This behavior is just like 
the behavior of the iTunes app on your 
computer. 
You can tap the More soft key and then tap 
the Downloads tab to see the progress of 
all your downloads. 
Where the Downloads Go 
 
You can see all of your downloads in either your Music or Videos apps by clicking the 
More icon, which shows your downloads organized by category. In other words, if you 
download a podcast, you will need to go into your Music app, touch More, and then the 
Podcasts tab to see the downloaded podcast. 
Sometimes, you decide that you do not want the all downloads you selected. If you want 
to stop a download and delete it, swipe your finger over the download to bring up the 
Delete button, and then tap Delete (see Figure 21‚Äì3).

Redeeming an iTunes Gift Card 
One of the cool things about the iTunes app on your iPod touch is that, just as with the 
iTunes app on your computer, you can redeem a gift card and receive credit in your 
iTunes account for your purchases. 
At the bottom of the iTunes screen, you should see the Redeem button (see Figure 21‚Äì4).

Ping 
Ping is Apple‚Äôs social network for music. 
You can access it by tapping the Ping 
button at the bottom center of the tab bar. 
With Ping, you can see what music is 
being bought and commented on by the 
artists and people you follow, and your 
followers can see the music you buy and 
comment on. Ping also lets you tweet out 
your purchases. 
 
 
There are three sections in Ping: 
 Activity: Shows you all the purchases and comments made by the 
people you follow. You can view either All activity, Artists activity only, 
or People (non-artists) only. 
 People: Gives you a list of all the other Ping users you Follow; a list of 
Ping users that Follow you; and lists of Featured, Recommended 
Artists, and Recommended People that Ping thinks you might like to 
follow. 
 My Profile: Shows you all of your own recent activity and gives you 
access to My Info, which displays your profile information and album 
art from music you like. 
NOTE: At the time of this writing, Ping has not gained significant popularity. If you‚Äôre a huge music 
fan, and you and your friends buy a lot of music from iTunes, then we certainly recommend you at 
least try it out. However, you might also find more established (if more generic) social networks like 
Twitter and Facebook more to your liking.

The Amazing App Store 
You have just seen how easy it is download music, videos, and 
podcasts from iTunes right to your iPod touch. You have also seen 
how easy it is to download iBooks from the iBooks store. 
It is just as easy to download new applications from Apple‚Äôs amazing
App Store. Apps are available for just about any function you can 
think of: games, productivity tools, social networking, and anything 
else you can imagine. As the advertising says, There‚Äôs an app for 
that. 
In this chapter, you will learn how to navigate the App Store, as well 
as how to search for and download apps. You will also learn how to 
maintain and update your apps once they are downloaded onto your 
iPod touch. 
Learning More About Apps and the App Store 
In this chapter, we will focus on accessing the App Store directly from your iPod touch. 
However, you should remember that you can also shop at the App Store using the 
iTunes program on your Mac or PC (see Figure 22‚Äì1).

In a very short amount of time, the App Store has exploded in popularity. There are apps 
for just about anything you can imagine. These apps are available at all price levels; in 
many cases, the apps are even free! 
Where to Find Apps News and Reviews 
You can find reviews for many apps in the App Store itself, and we recommend that you 
check out the App Store reviews. However, sometimes you will probably want more 
information from expert reviewers. If so, blogs are a great place to find news and 
reviews for particular apps or content. 
Here is a list of Apple iPhone- and iPod-related blogs with reviews of apps:

App Store Basics 
With a little time, you should find the App Store to be quite intuitive to navigate. We‚Äôll 
cover some of the basics for getting the most out of the App Store, so that your 
experience will be as enjoyable and productive as possible. 
NOTE: App availability varies by country. Some apps are only available in some countries, and 
some countries may not have certain games sections due to local ratings laws. 
A Network Connection Is Required 
After you set up your App Store (iTunes) account, you still need to have the right 
network connectivity to access the App Store and download apps. Check out Chapter 4: 
‚ÄúConnect to the Network‚Äù to learn how to tell whether you are connected. 
Starting the App Store 
The App Store icon should be on your first page of icons on 
the Home screen. Tap the icon to launch the App Store app. 
 
 
The App Store Home Page 
We‚Äôll look at several parts of the App Store‚Äôs Home page: the top bar, middle content, 
and the bottom soft keys. 
We‚Äôll look at the top bar first. At the top of the page shown in Figure 22‚Äì2, you will see 
three buttons: New, What‚Äôs Hot, and Genius. Tap any of these to change the view. 
TIP: Genius is a feature that suggests apps you might like based on apps you have already 
downloaded and installed on your iPod touch. It can be quite a nice way to filter through the 
hundreds of thousands of apps to find the ones that might interest you. 
The middle of the page is your main content area. This main content area shows you a 
list of apps or the details of a specific app that you are viewing. You can swipe up or 
down to view more apps in a list or details for a specific app. You can also swipe left or 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store

right when viewing screen shots. On the Featured apps page, you will notice that there 
are a few large icons at the top. Clicking these icons will show you either types of apps 
or individual apps. Below the larger icons (you have to swipe down), you will see a 
number of featured apps. 
The bottom of the App Store‚Äôs Home page has five soft key buttons: 
 Featured: Shows apps that have been highlighted by the App Store or 
by the app developers. 
 Categories: Shows a list of categories used to organize the apps, so 
you can browse by category. 
 Top 25: Shows top selling or top downloaded apps. 
 Search: Finds an app using entered search terms. 
 Updates: Lets you update any apps you have installed, and 
redownload any apps you‚Äôve already acquired. 
You can tell that Figure 22‚Äì2 is showing Featured apps because the Featured soft key 
is highlighted on the bottom row of soft keys. Scrolling is handled the same way as in 
other programs‚Äîjust move your finger up and down to scroll through the page.

You can also Tell a Friend or Report a Problem using the buttons at the bottom of the 
screen.

Viewing the New Apps 
The default view in the App Store shows new and featured apps. This is the view shown 
back in Figure 22‚Äì2. You can tell that this view shows new featured apps because the 
Featured soft key 
 is highlighted at the bottom of the screen, and the New 
button 
 at the top of the page is pressed. 
Viewing What‚Äôs Hot 
Touch the What‚Äôs Hot button at the top of 
the screen, and the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù apps in the 
store will be shown on the screen. Again, 
just scroll through the hottest apps to see if 
something catches your eye. 
NOTE: The fact that an app is in the 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Hot‚Äù category does not 
necessarily mean you will also believe it 
is useful or fun. Check out the app 
descriptions and reviews carefully before 
you purchase anything. 
 
 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store

Genius 
The third button at the top of the Featured 
apps section takes you to the Genius 
feature. This feature works like the 
identically named feature in the iTunes 
app that plays music on your computer. 
For example, it displays apps you might 
like based on apps you already have 
installed on your iPod touch. 
NOTE: The first time you use the Genius 
feature, you will have to accept the 
terms and conditions presented before 
the feature will be enabled. 
   
 
Based On 
Notice that there is a Based on (app 
name) label above each app. This label 
shows you that the suggested app was 
based on a specific app you‚Äôve installed on 
your iPod touch. For example, the CBS 
Radio suggestion was based on the fact 
that Pandora Radio is installed. We didn‚Äôt 
know about CBS Radio, but maybe we‚Äôll 
give it a try based on this recommendation. 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store

Swipe to Remove 
If you do not like a Genius suggestion, then 
you can swipe left or right on it to bring up 
the Delete button, just as you would to 
remove email or other items from lists on 
your iPod touch. Tap the Delete button to 
remove that app from the list. 
 
 
 
Disable Genius Feature 
To disable the Genius feature, you need to 
go into your App Store settings (see the 
‚ÄúApp Store Settings‚Äù section later in this 
chapter to learn how to disable this 
feature). 
 
 
 
Categories 
 
Sometimes, all the choices presented can be a bit 
overwhelming. If you have a sense of what type of app you are 
looking for, touch the Categories button along the bottom row 
of soft keys (see Figure 23‚Äì4). 
The current categories available are shown in Table 23‚Äì1.

Looking at the Top 25 Charts 
 
 
Touch the Top Charts soft key along the bottom row, 
and the App Store will change the view again. This 
time, you will see the top 25 paid, free, and top-
grossing apps. Just touch one of the Top Paid, Top 
Free, or Top Grossing buttons at the top to switch 
between the views. 
NOTE: The Top Grossing category refers to the highest 
money-making apps, which is sales volume times selling 
price. This view will help more expensive apps get up higher 
in the charts. For example, a US $4.99 app that sells 10,000 
units will rank much higher on the Top Grossing chart than 
a US $0.99 app that sells the same number of units.

Searching for an App 
Let‚Äôs say you have a specific idea of the type of 
app you want to find. Touch the Search soft key 
and type in either the name of the program or the 
type of program. 
So, if you are looking for an app to help you with 
rowing, just type in ‚Äúrowing‚Äù to see what comes 
up. 
You may see some suggested search terms 
appear; tap these to narrow your search. 
Tapping Rowing Stats in the suggested search 
terms yields only one result. 
We want to see all the rowing-related apps, so we
tap in the Search bar and use the Backspace key
to erase the word ‚Äústats.‚Äù Next, we tap the Search
button in the lower-right corner to see a broader 
list of rowing-related results. 
TIP: If you row on the water (instead of 
only on a rowing machine), you might 
want to check out SpeedCoach Mobile, 
which sells for $64.99. There is also a free 
(at the time of writing) alternative called 
iRowPro. 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store 
474 
Downloading an App 
Once you find the app you are looking for, you can download it right to your iPod touch, 
as shown in Figure 22‚Äì5. 
After locating the app you want to buy, 
notice the small button that says either 
Free or $0.99 (or whatever the price is). 
Just touch that button, and it will change 
to say Install if it is a free program or Buy 
Now if it is a paid program. 
 
     
  
     
 
Figure 22‚Äì5. Buying an app or downloading a free app 
Once you have read the reviews and the app description (and perhaps visited the 
developer support site), go ahead and download or purchase the app. Once you tap the 
Download App button, you will be prompted to input your iTunes password. 
Input your password and tap OK; the app will be downloaded to your iPod touch. 
Giving an App as a Gift 
Down near the bottom of the details screen for each app, you will see a Gift This App 
button which you can use to give the app as a gift to anyone via email.  Here's how to 
do it. 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store 
475 
1. Bring up the details on the app you 
want to gift.  Swipe all the way to 
the bottom of the page and tap 
Gift This App. 
 
 
2. Log In to your iTunes account to see 
the next page. 
3. Verify that the person who is 
receiving the gift has a device that 
meets the requirements shown. 
 
 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store 
476 
4. Type Your Name, the Recipient's 
Name and Email.  Then scroll down 
and type a personal message.  
Gifted apps are sent by email. 
5. Tap Next. 
 
 
6. In the final screen, you can verify 
everything looks correct, your 
message, the recipient's email. 
7. To complete the gift and have the 
email sent to the recipient, tap Buy 
Gift at the bottom.   
 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store 
477 
Finding Free or Discounted Apps 
After browsing around, you will notice a couple of things about the App Store. First, 
there are lots of free apps. Sometimes, these are great applications. Other times, they 
are not so useful‚Äîbut they can still be fun! 
Second, you will notice that there will be sales for some of the apps, while other apps 
will become less expensive over time. If you have a favorite app and it costs $6.99 
today, you might see its price decrease if you wait a few weeks or a month before 
buying it. 
Redeeming Gift Cards or iTunes Codes 
You can redeem gift cards or iTunes codes 
by swiping all the way to the bottom of 
most pages in the App Store. 
At the bottom, tap the Redeem button. 
 
 
Enter your code on the next screen.  (You 
may have to scratch off something from 
the back of the gift card to see the code.) 
Tap the Redeem button. 
 
Maintaining and Updating Your Apps 
Often, developers will update their apps for the iPod touch. You 
don‚Äôt need to use your computer to perform the update‚Äîyou 
can do it right on your iPod touch. 
You can even tell if you have updates, and how many, by looking 
at the App Store icon. The one shown here has five app updates 
available for you to download. 
 
 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store 
478 
Once you enter the App Store, tap the 
right-most icon on the bottom row. This is 
the Updates icon. 
 
 
If you have apps with updates available, 
there will be a small number indicated in 
red. This number corresponds to the 
number of apps with updates. 
When you tap the Update button, the iPod 
touch shows you which apps have 
updates. 
 
To get your updates, you could touch an 
individual app. However, it is easier to 
touch the Update All button 
 in the upper-right corner 
to have all your apps updated at once. The 
iPod touch will leave the App Store, and 
you can see the progress of the updates in 
the little status bars. All apps updating will 
have icons that look grayed out. 
Some status messages will show Waiting, 
while others will show Loading or 
Installing. When the update is complete, 
all your icons will return to their normal 
colors. 
 
NOTE: You will need to relaunch the App Store app to get back in. The update process takes you 
completely out of the store. 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store 
479 
Redownloading Apps 
Once you‚Äôve downloaded an app, whether free or paid, you can download it again as 
often as you like at no additional charge. For example, assume you buy an app to take 
with you on vacation. Once you‚Äôve finished your trip, you can safely delete it and then 
download it again the next time you travel. This can help keep your Home screen clean 
and help prevent you from running out of storage on your iPod touch. 
To get a list of apps you‚Äôve previously bought or 
downloaded, tap the Update button and then tap 
the Purchased tab at the very top of the screen. 
 
 
Inside the Purchased section, you have a choice 
of two views. First, you can view a list of all the 
apps you‚Äôve ever bought or downloaded. 
Alternatively, you can view a list of apps that 
aren‚Äôt currently installed on your iPod touch. 
NOTE: Are you seeing apps listed that you don‚Äôt 
remember buying or downloading? If so, this 
might be because you downloaded apps on your 
iPhone, purchased universal apps on your iPad, or 
you shared your iTunes account with a spouse or 
family member who has downloaded apps to their 
device(s). 
 

CHAPTER 22:  The Amazing App Store

Automatic Downloads 
The iCloud online service lets you set up your 
iPod touch so it automatically downloads and 
installs any apps you purchase through iTunes on 
your Windows or Mac PC‚Äîor even on another 
iOS device, such as your iPad. 
Follow these steps to turn on Automatic 
Downloads: 
1. Tap the Settings icon. 
2. Scroll down and tap Store. 
3. Toggle Automatic Downloads for Apps to 
ON. 
 
If you no longer wish to download apps automatically, simply toggle Automatic 
Downloads for Apps back to OFF. 
Other App Store Settings 
Inside the settings for the App Store app, you can also check which account is logged 
into the store, log out, turn off the Genius feature, view your iTunes account, and work 
with your newsletter subscriptions. 
TIP: If you want to prevent someone from buying apps on your iPod touch using your iTunes 
account, you need to sign out of iTunes using the steps described next. 
Follow these steps to change the other settings for the App Store app: 
1. Note that you can see the account you are logged in with at the top of this screen. 
2. Tap Sign Out if you wish to log out of the iTunes service. For example, you might 
to give your iPod touch to someone you don‚Äôt using your phone to buy apps with 
your iTunes account.

                  Chapter 
Games and Fun 
Your iPod touch excels at many things. It is a multimedia workhorse, and it can keep 
track of your busy life. Your iPod touch particularly excels in two areas: as a gaming 
device and for displaying apps that take advantage of its beautiful, high-resolution touch 
screen and powerful graphical processor. You can even find versions of popular games 
for the device that you might expect to find only on dedicated gaming consoles. 
The iPod touch brings many advantages to portable gaming: the high definition (HD) 
screen delivers realistic visuals; the high quality audio provides great sound effects; and 
the gyroscope and the accelerometer allow you to interact with your games in a way 
that many PCs and dedicated gaming consoles (outside of the Wii) don‚Äôt. For example, 
in racing games, the last feature lets you steer your car by turning the iPod touch as you 
hold it. 
With AirPlay Mirroring, you can even beam your game to an Apple TV on the same Wi-Fi 
network and play on your big screen television. 
The iPod touch is also great for lots of other fun stuff such as following your local 
baseball team and even using the iPod touch as a musical instrument with great apps 
like Ocarina (which we will show you later in the chapter). 
Using the iPod touch As a Gaming Device 
The iPod touch includes a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope, which is essentially a 
device that detects movement (acceleration) and tilt. 
Combine the accelerometer with a fantastic screen, lots of memory, and a fast 
processor, and you have the makings of a great gaming platform. With literally 
thousands of gaming titles to choose from, you can play virtually any type of game you 
wish on your iPod touch. 
With multitasking, you can even take a phone call and come back to the exact place you 
left off. 
 
23 

CHAPTER 23:  Games and Fun 
484 
NOTE: Some games require that you have an active network connection to engage in multiplayer 
games. 
With the iPod touch, you can play a 
driving game and use the iPod 
touch itself to steer. You do this 
simply by turning the device. You 
can touch the iPod touch to brake 
or tilt it forward to accelerate.  
This game is so realistic that it 
might make you car sick! 
Real Racing also has a nice Party 
Play feature, where you can race 
against your friends - give it a try! 
Or, you can try a fishing game, 
where you case and reel in fish 
from the perspective of being on a 
boat!

CHAPTER 23:  Games and Fun 
485 
If music/rhythm games are your 
thing, then you will find many 
such programs in the App Store 
such as Rock Band. There are 
also fantastic fighting games like 
Infinity Blade, which is powered 
by the Epic Unreal 3 Engine; first-
person shooters (FPS) like Call of 
Duty: Zombies; and some of the 
most popular casual games on 
the planet, such as Angry Birds. 
 
 
The iPod touch also has a very fast processor and a sophisticated graphics chip. 
Bundling these together with the accelerometer gives you a very capable gaming device. 
Acquiring Games and Other Fun Apps 
As is the case for all iPod touch apps, games can be found at the App Store (see 
Figure 23‚Äì1). You can get them either through the iTunes app on your computer or 
through the device‚Äôs App Store app. 
     
 
Figure 23‚Äì1. The layout of the App Store‚Äôs Games section 

CHAPTER 23:  Games and Fun

To get a game, fire up the App Store app, as you 
did in the previous chapter. Next, use the 
Categories icon to go to the Games tab. You will 
also find many games in the Featured section of the 
App store, as well as in the New and Notable 
section. Figure 23‚Äì2 shows the app purchase page 
for a game available for the iPod touch.

Reading Reviews Before You Buy 
Many of the games have user reviews that 
are worth perusing. Sometimes, you can 
get a good sense of the game before you 
buy it. If you find a game that looks 
interesting, don‚Äôt be afraid to do a simple 
Google search to see whether any 
mainstream media outlets have performed 
a full review. 
 
 
Looking for Free Trials or Lite Versions 
Increasingly,  game developers are giving users free 
trials of their games to see if they like them before they 
buy. You will find many games have both a Lite version 
and a Full version in the App Store. 
Some ‚Äúfree‚Äù games are supported by the inclusion of 
ads within the game. Other games are free to start, but 
require in-app purchases for continued play or 
additional features. 
 
Being Careful When You Play 
You might use the iPod touch to cast your line in a fishing game, as you would in real 
life. You can also move around a bit in driving and first-person shooter games. The 
point: Be mindful of your surroundings as you play! For example, make sure you have a 
good grip on your device, so it doesn‚Äôt slip out of your hand; we recommend a good 
silicone case to help with this. 
CAUTION: Games such as Real Racing can be quite addictive! 

CHAPTER 23:  Games and Fun 
488 
Two-Player Games 
The iPod touch really opens up the 
possibility for two-player gaming. In this 
example, we are playing checkers against 
one another, using the iPod touch as a 
game board. 
You can find similar two-person gaming 
apps for other board games, such as 
chess, Monopoly, and Uno.. 
 
 
Online and Wireless Games 
The iPod touch also allows online and 
wireless, peer-to-peer gaming (if the 
game supports it). Many new games are 
incorporating this technology. In 
Scrabble, for example, you can play 
against multiple players on their own 
devices. You can even use the iPod 
touch as your game board and up to 
four individual iPod touchs as wireless 
‚Äúracks‚Äù to hold the letters of all the 
players. Just flick the letters off the rack, 
and they go onto the board‚Äîvery cool! 
In this example, I selected Online from 
the Real Racing menu. I now have the 
option to either play against another 
opponent through Wi-Fi or to join an 
online league race. 
 

CHAPTER 23:  Games and Fun 
489 
NOTE: If you just want to play against a friend who is nearby, select Wi-Fi mode for multiplayer 
games. If you just want to play against new people, try going online for a league race or game. 
Other Fun Stuff: Baseball  
There are many great apps that can provide 
you with endless hours of entertainment on the 
iPod touch. Since the iPod touch was released 
on opening day of the Major League Baseball 
season, it is appropriate to highlight an app 
that was honored as the first ‚ÄúApp of the 
Week‚Äù in the iPod touch App Store. 
At Bat 2010 for iPod touch is a US $14.99 
application that is well worth the entry fee for 
any baseball fan. It also highlights the iPod 
touch‚Äôs capabilities. 
 
 
The main view of the app changes, based on whether there are baseball games 
currently being played. When you first register the app, you pick your favorite team. The 
favorite team on the iPod touch in this example is set to the Red Sox. So, if this team is 
playing, then the view automatically goes to that team‚Äôs game first. If the team is not 
playing, then it displays a recap of the team‚Äôs previous game. Alternatively, it might list 
the details of the team‚Äôs next game. 
 
The main view during game time shows a batter at the plate. This batter represents the 
real batter. Batters will switch sides of the plate, depending on whether the batter 
currently up hits from the left or right side of the plate. The current pitch count is shown 
above the plate, and the score is displayed at the top of the screen. 

CHAPTER 23:  Games and Fun 
490 
When you see a player at the plate or on 
base, you can touch the player‚Äôs image to 
bring up his baseball card and view his 
stats. 
 
 
TIP: You can even allow notifications to be sent when something newsworthy occurs related to 
your favorite team. To do this, touch the Information icon and set Notifications to ON. 
AirPlay Mirroring 
The latest iPod touch comes with the ability to not 
only stream video or music from your iPod touch 
to an Apple TV, but also to share the screen of any 
app, including games. This lets you and your entire 
family watch and enjoy the game on the big screen 
while using your iPod touch as the controller. It 
can be especially effective with board games and 
multiplayer games where the whole family or group 
can sit around and play together. 
Follow these steps to use the AirPlay Mirroring 
feature: 
1. Tap the app you want to mirror. For this 
example, we‚Äôre using Infinity Blade. 
2. Once the app has launched, double-click 
the Home button to bring up the Fast App 
Switcher. 
 

CHAPTER 23:  Games and Fun 
491 
3. Swipe from left to right to get to the 
audio/video controls. (They‚Äôre all the way at 
the end, so keep swiping until you can‚Äôt 
swipe any more.) 
4. Tap the AirPlay icon to bring up the list of 
AirPlay‚Äìenabled devices on your Wi-Fi 
network. 
5. Select Apple TV. 
6. Click the Home button again to return to 
your app. 
7. You should now see Infinity Blade on the big 
screen. Let ‚Äôem have it! 
To stop AirPlay Mirroring, repeat the same 
procedure and choose iPod touch from the device 
list. 
 
 
NOTE: Some games allow you to do multiplayer AirPlay Mirroring, like Real Racing 2‚Äôs Party Play 
feature where up to 4 people can use their iPod touchs or iPads to race against each other on the 
same big screen TV.

Social Networking 
Some of the most popular places to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù these days are those sites that are often 
called social networking sites‚Äîplaces that allow you to create your own page and 
connect with friends and family to see what is going in their lives. Some of the biggest 
web sites for social networking are Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. 
In this chapter, we will show you how to access these sites. You will learn how to update 
your status, tweet, and keep track of those who are both important or simply of interest 
to you. 
Facebook 
Facebook was founded in February of 2004. Since that time, it has served as the 
premier site for users to connect, re-connect, and share information with friends, co-
workers, and family. Today, over 800 million people use Facebook as their primary 
source of ‚Äúcatching up‚Äù with the people who matter most to them. 
NOTE: You cannot play Facebook games inside the Facebook app or via the Facebook.com web 
site on your iPod touch. This may disappoint you if you are a big Facebook game player; however, 
you can often get the same games (e.g., FarmVille) from the App Store, and then connect them to 
your Facebook computer version to keep your place. 
On your iPod touch, you have three primary ways of accessing your 
Facebook page at the time of publishing: 
1. Use Safari to go to the standard (full) web site: 
www.facebook.com. 
2. Use Safari to go to the mobile site: 
http://touch.facebook.com. 
3. Use the iPod touch Facebook app. 
 
 
24 

CHAPTER 24:  Social Networking 
494 
NOTE: The iPod touch version of the Facebook app is a bit more limited than the full web site, 
but it is much easier to navigate. 
Different Ways to Connect to Facebook 
You can access Facebook by using its iPod touch-specific app or using one of the two 
previously mentioned Facebook web sites in your Safari browser. We will focus on the 
Facebook app for the iPod touch for the duration of this chapter. 
Downloading and Installing the Facebook App 
In order to find the app, use the Search feature in 
the App Store and simply type in ‚ÄúFacebook.‚Äù 
You can also go to the Social Networking 
category in the App Store and find the official 
Facebook app, as well as many other Facebook-
related apps. 
NOTE: Some of the apps may look like ‚Äúofficial‚Äù 
Facebook apps, and they do cost money. 
However, the only ‚Äúofficial‚Äù app is the iPhone/iPod 
app shown to the right. 
In order to connect to your account on Facebook, you will need to 
locate the icon you just installed and click it. We use the example of 
Facebook here, but the process is very similar for the rest of the 
apps. 
Once Facebook is successfully downloaded, the icon should look 
something like this.

Facebook App Basics 
Once Facebook is downloaded and installed, 
the first thing you will see is the Login screen. 
Input your account information‚Äîyour email 
address and password.
After you log in the first time, you will see a 
Push Notifications warning message. 
Click OK if you want to allow these messages, 
which can be pokes from other Facebook 
friends, notes, status update notifications, and 
more. 
Once you log in, you will see the Facebook

9. Set View in Lock Screen to get notification 
info even when your iPod touch is locked. 
TIP: The Facebook app will bring in Facebook 
profile pictures to your Contacts list. This can be 
quite humorous, depending on the pictures. 
However, it can also upload your own, non-
Facebook contacts‚Äô information to Facebook‚Äôs 
servers, which might raise privacy concerns for you, 
your family, and friends. 
 
LinkedIn 
LinkedIn has core functionality very similar to Facebook, but it tends to be focused on 
business and career interests. This is in contrast to Facebook, which is focused more on 
personal friends and games. With LinkedIn, you can connect and re-connect with 
current and past business associates, send messages, see what people are up to, have 
discussions, and more. 
At the time of publishing, the status of LinkedIn was very similar to Facebook. You can 
go to the regular LinkedIn site on the Safari browser, or you can download the LinkedIn 
app for the iPod touch. 
Which is better? We liked the LinkedIn app for the iPod touch slightly better than the full 
LinkedIn.com site in Safari. It was easier to navigate using the LinkedIn app with the 
large buttons, but you could see more on the screen in the Safari version. We 
recommend giving both options a try and seeing which you like better‚Äîit is really a 
matter of personal preference. 
Downloading the LinkedIn App 
The process for downloading the LinkedIn 
app is similar to the process for 
downloading the Facebook app. Start the 
App Store app on your iPod touch, type 
‚ÄúLinkedIn‚Äù into the Search window, and 
then locate the app. The LinkedIn app is 
free, so tap the FREE button to install it. 
 

CHAPTER 24:  Social Networking 
501 
Logging In to LinkedIn App 
Once the app is installed, click the 
LinkedIn icon and enter your login 
information. 
 
 
Navigating Around the LinkedIn App 
LinkedIn has a zone-based navigation 
system. Tap any stack to move to that 
zone, and then tap the LinkedIn logo at 
the top to return to the Home screen. 
 
 

CHAPTER 24:  Social Networking 
502 
Communicating with LinkedIn Connections 
One of the things you will most likely do 
the most with the LinkedIn app is 
communicate with your connections. The 
easiest way to do that is to follow these 
steps: 
 
 
1. From the Home page, tap the You stack at the top right. 
2. Tap the Connections button midway down the screen. 
3. Scroll through your connections or tap the Magnifying Glass search icon and 
type in a connection name in the Search box. 
4. Tap the connection you are looking for. 
5. Tap the Mail icon to send him a message. 
Twitter 
Twitter was started in 2006. Twitter is essentially an SMS (text message)‚Äìbased social 
networking site. It is often referred to as a micro-blogging site, and it is a place where 
the famous and not-so-famous can share what‚Äôs on their mind. The catch is that you 
have only 140 characters to get your point across. 
With Twitter, you subscribe to follow someone who tweets messages. You might also 
find that people will start to follow you. If you want to follow us, we are @garymadesimple 
on Twitter. 

CHAPTER 24:  Social Networking 
503 
Setting up Twitter 
1. With iOS 5, the Twitter app is built right into 
your iPod touch. This means that the app lets 
you share content like pictures and posts 
from within other apps, like Photos. Follow 
these steps to set up Twitter: 
2. Tap the Settings app. 
3. Scroll down and tap Twitter. 
4. If Twitter for the iPod touch isn‚Äôt already 
installed on your iPod touch, tap the Install 
button to the right of the Twitter icon. (If 
Twitter for the iPod touch is already installed, 
the Install button will be grayed out.) 
5. Tap User Name and enter your Twitter 
@username. 
6. Tap Password and enter your Twitter 
password. 
7. Tap the Sign In button.  
8. If you don‚Äôt have a Twitter account, tap the 
Create New Account button at the bottom 
of the screen and fill in the form to get one. 
 

CHAPTER 24:  Social Networking 
504 
9. Once you‚Äôre logged in, tap Account to 
change your options. 
10. If you want your friends to be able to find you 
on Twitter based on your email address, 
toggle Find me by Email to ON. 
11. If you want your location to be recorded 
every time you tweet from within an app, 
toggle Tweet Location to ON. 
 
 
NOTE: If you tweet your location, potentially anyone on Twitter could find out where you are‚Äî
including the fact that you‚Äôre not at home or work. If privacy is a concern, toggle Tweet Location 
to OFF. 
Using Twitter 
The official Twitter app takes a streamlined approach to using Twitter. The Home 
screen shows you the tweets from those you are following, and the full message is 
nice and large. 
Along the bottom are five icons, the first being the main Twitter feed. The other icons 
are Mentions, Direct Messages, Search, and the More button, which takes you to 
your Profile, Favorites, Drafts, Lists, and Accounts and Settings. 
The Compose Tweet icon is in the top-left corner (see Figure 24‚Äì1).

The iPod touch is usually highly reliable. Occasionally, as with your computer or any 
complicated electronic device, you might have to reset the device or troubleshoot a 
problem. In this chapter, we will give you some useful tools to help get your iPod touch 
back up and running as quickly as possible. We will start with some basic quick 
troubleshooting and move onto more in-depth problems and resolutions in the 
‚ÄúAdvanced Troubleshooting‚Äù section. 
We will also cover some other odds and ends related to your iPod touch and give you a 
list of resources where you can find help for your iPod touch. 
Basic Troubleshooting 
We will begin by covering a few basic tips and tricks to get your iPod touch back up and 
running. when something goes wrong. 
What to Do If the iPod touch Stops Responding 
Sometimes, your iPod touch won‚Äôt respond to your touch‚Äîit simply 
freezes in the middle of a program. If this happens, try these steps to 
see whether the iPod touch will start responding (see Figure 25‚Äì1): 
1. Click the Home button once to see whether that 
exits the app to the Home screen.

2. 
If a particular app is causing trouble, 
try double-clicking the Home button 
to open the App Switcher bar. Next, 
press and hold any icon in the App 
Switcher bar until they all shake and 
a red Circle icon with a minus sign 
appears in the upper-left corner of the 
app icon. 
3. 
Tap the red Circle icon to close the 
app. 
 
4. If the iPod touch continues to be unresponsive, try pressing the 
Sleep/Power key until you see Slide to Power Off. 
5. Press and hold the Home button until you return to the Home screen‚Äî
this should quit the program. 
6. Make sure your iPod touch isn‚Äôt running out of power. Try plugging it in 
or attaching it to your computer (if it‚Äôs plugged in) to see whether it will 
start to respond. 
7. If holding the Home button doesn‚Äôt work, you will need to try to turn off 
your iPod touch by pressing and holding the Power/Sleep button for 
three to four seconds. 
8. Next, slide the Slide to Power Off slider at the top of the screen. If you 
cannot power off the iPod touch, then you will need to reset the iPod 
touch. Skip ahead to the next section to learn how. 
9. After you power off the iPod touch, wait a minute or so, and then turn on 
the iPod touch by holding the same Power button for a few seconds. 
10. You should see the Apple logo appear on the screen. Wait until the iPod 
touch starts up, and you should be able to access your programs and 
data.

No Sound in Music, Video, Alerts or Ringer 
Few things are more frustrating than missing FaceTime calls, hoping to listen to music or 
watch a video, only to find that no sound comes out of the iPod touch. Usually, there is 
an easy fix for this problem: 
1. If you are not hearing any alerts, then check to make sure your Mute 
switch on the upper left edge of your device is not turned on.  You know 
the Mute switch is set to on when it's switched toward the back of your 
device and you see a little orange color next to the switch.  Make sure 
the Mute switch is pushed toward the front of your device, which is the 
off position. 
2. Check the volume by using the Volume Up key in the upper-left edge of 
your iPod touch. You might have accidentally lowered the volume all the 
way or muted it. 
3. If you are using wired headphones from the headphone jack, unplug 
your headphones, and then put them back in. Sometimes, the headset 
jack isn‚Äôt connected well. 
4. Follow these steps if you are using wireless Bluetooth headphones or a 
Bluetooth stereo setup: 
a. Check the volume setting (if available on the headphones or 
stereo). 
b. Check to make sure the Bluetooth device is connected. Tap the 
Settings icon, tap General, and then tap Bluetooth. Make sure 
you see your device listed and that its status is Connected. If it is 
not connected, then tap it and follow the directions to pair it with 
the iPod touch. 
NOTE: Sometimes you may actually be connected to a Bluetooth device and not know it. If you 
are connected to a Bluetooth Stereo device, no sound will come out of the actual iPod touch. 
5. Make sure the song or video is not in Pause mode. 
6. Open the iPod touch music or video controls. Double-clicking the Home button 
should open the App Switcher bar. Swipe from left to right to see your media 
controls. 
7. Swipe one more time to the right to see the volume controls. Verify that the song 
is not paused and that the volume is not turned down all the way. 

CHAPTER 25:  Troubleshooting 
515 
8. Finally, check the Settings icon to see whether you (or someone else) 
has set the Volume Limit on the iPod touch: 
a. Tap the Settings icon. 
b. Swipe down the page and tap Music. 
c. See whether Volume Limit is On. 
d. Tap Volume Limit to check the setting level. If the limit is 
unlocked, simply slide the volume to a higher level. 
e. If it is locked, you need to unlock it first by tapping the Unlock 
Volume Limit button and entering the four-digit code. 
If none of these steps helps, check out the ‚ÄúAdditional Troubleshooting and Help 
Resources‚Äù section later in this chapter. If that doesn‚Äôt help, then try to restore your iPod 
touch from a backup file using the steps in the ‚ÄúRestore Your iPod touch from a 
Backup‚Äù section in the chapter. Finally, if that does not help, then contact the store or 
business that sold you your iPod touch for assistance. 
If You Can‚Äôt Make Purchases from iTunes or the App Store 
You have this cool new device, so you decide to visit the iTunes Store or the App Store. 
But what if you receive an error message, or you are not allowed to make a purchase? 
Try these steps if this happens to you: 
1. Both stores require an active Internet connection. Make sure you have 
either a Wi-Fi connection or a cellular data connection. For assistance, 
check out Chapter 4: ‚ÄúConnect to the Network.‚Äù 
2. Verify you have an active iTunes account. 
Advanced Troubleshooting 
Thus far we‚Äôve covered the basic troubleshooting steps on your iPod touch. In the 
upcoming sections, we will delve into some more advanced troubleshooting steps. 
When Your iPod touch Does Not Show Up in iTunes 
Occasionally, your iPod touch may not be recognized by the iTunes app when you 
connect your iPod touch to your PC or Mac. Consequently, your iPod touch will not 
appear in the left nav bar. 

CHAPTER 25:  Troubleshooting 
516 
After you connect your iPod touch to your computer, you should see it listed in the left 
nav bar under DEVICES. There are a few steps you can take to try and get the iTunes
app to recognize your iPod touch: 
1.
Check the battery charge of the iPod touch by looking at the battery 
level in the top right of the Home screen. If you have let the battery run 
too far down, the iTunes app won‚Äôt see it until the level of the battery 
rises a bit. 
2.
If the battery is charged, try connecting the iPod touch to a different 
USB port on your computer. Sometimes, if you have always used one 
USB port for the iPod touch and switch it to another port, the computer 
won‚Äôt see it. 
3.
If this still does not fix the problem, try disconnecting the iPod touch 
and restarting the computer. 
4.
Next, reconnect the iPod touch to the USB port. 
5.
If the iTunes app still doesn‚Äôt see your iPod touch, then download the 
latest update to iTunes, or completely uninstall and reinstall the iTunes
app on the computer. If you choose this option, make sure that you 
back up all the information in iTunes first. 
6.
You also might want to try another sync cable, it could be possible that 
your USB sync cable is defective. 
Synchronization Problems 
Sometimes, you might encounter errors when synchronizing your iPod touch with your 
computer (PC or Mac). How you address the problem depends on your sync method. 
Using iTunes to Sync 
If you are using iTunes to sync your personal information, then follow these steps to 
resolve synchronization problems: 
1.
First, follow all the steps we outlined in the ‚ÄúiPod touch Does Not Show 
Up in iTunes‚Äù section of this chapter. 
2.
If the iPod touch still will not sync, but you can see it in the left nav bar 
of your iTunes app, go back to Chapter 3: ‚ÄúSync with iCloud, iTunes, 
and More‚Äù and review your sync settings very carefully. 

CHAPTER 25:  Troubleshooting 
517 
Using Apple‚Äôs iCloud or Microsoft Exchange to Sync 
If you are using the iCloud service or Microsoft Exchange method to sync your email 
and personal information, then follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve 
synchronization problems: 
1. Both iCloud and Exchange sync require a wireless Internet data 
connection in order to sync your email and personal information. Verify 
that you have a live data connection by checking Table 1 in the Quick 
Start Guide‚Äôs ‚ÄúReading the Connectivity Status Icons‚Äù section. 
2. If you do not have a wireless data signal, then verify your Wi-Fi 
connection is set up correctly (see Chapter 4: ‚ÄúConnect to the 
Network‚Äù). 
3. After you have verified your connection, you need to check that your sync 
settings are correct on your computer and iPod touch (see Chapter 3). 
TIP: Sometimes your problem can be as simple as a changed password. If this is the case, then 
make sure to correct your password on your iPod touch for your sync settings. These are found 
by tapping your Settings icon, then tapping Mail, Contacts and Calendars. Finally, tap the 
account name and adjust the password. 
Reinstalling the iPod touch Operating System (with or 
Without a Restore) 
Sometimes, you might have to do a clean install of your iPod touch operating system to 
get your iPod touch back up and running smoothly. If an update is currently available, 
then this process will also result in upgrading your iPod touch software. 
TIP: This process is virtually identical to the process of updating your iPod touch with a new 
version of the operating system. 
During this process, you will have three choices: 
 If you want to return the iPod touch to its normal state with all your 
data, you will have to use the Restore function in the iTunes app. 
 If you plan on getting a clean start and tying the iPod touch to an 
iTunes account, then you will need to use the Setup a new iPod 
touch function at the end of this process. 

CHAPTER 25:  Troubleshooting 
518 
 If you plan on giving away or selling your iPod touch, then you will 
simply need to eject the iPod touch from iTunes at the end of this 
process (before doing a restore or new setup). 
CAUTION: This restore process will wipe your iPod touch totally clean. You will need to 
resynchronize and reinstall all of your apps and enter your account information, such as your 
email accounts. This process could take 30 minutes or longer, depending on how much 
information you have synced to your iPod touch. 
To reinstall the iPod touch operating system software with the option of restoring data to 
your iPod touch from a previous backup, follow these steps: 
1. Connect your iPod touch to your computer and load the iTunes app. 
2. Click your iPod touch in the DEVICES category in the left nav bar. 
3. Click Summary in the top nav bar. 
4. You will see the Summary screen with all the information about your 
iPod touch. Click the Restore button in the middle screen, as shown 
here (see Figure 25‚Äì3). 
   
 
Figure 25‚Äì3. Connecting your iPod touch and clicking the Restore button in the Summary screen 

CHAPTER 25:  Troubleshooting 
519 
5. Now you may be asked whether you want to back up your iPod touch, if 
so, click Back Up just to be safe. 
6. On the next screen, you are warned that all data will be erased. Click 
Restore or Restore and Update to continue (see Figure 25‚Äì4). 
 
 
Figure 25‚Äì4. Backing up your iPod touch in iTunes before a restore 
7. You will see an iPod touch Software Update screen. Click Next > to continue. 
8.  Next, you will see the Software License Agreement screen. Click Agree to 
continue and start the process. 
9. iTunes will download the latest iPod touch software, back up and sync your iPod 
touch, and then reinstall the iPod touch software. This process completely erases 
all data and restores your iPod touch to its original, ‚Äúclean‚Äù state. You will see 
status messages at the top of iTunes. 
10. After the backup and sync, your iPod touch screen will go black. Next, the Apple 
logo will appear, and you will see a status bar under the logo. Finally, a small pop-
up window will appear in iTunes to tell you the update process is complete. Click 
OK to go to the Set Up Your iPod touch screen. You will have a couple options 
at this point: 
a. If you want to keep your iPod touch clean (i.e., without any of your personal 
data), then select the top option, Set up as a new iPod touch. You might 
want to use this option if you are setting up this iPod touch for someone 
else (you will need her Apple ID and password). 
b. If you are giving away or selling your iPod touch, simply click the Eject icon 
next to the iPod touch, and you‚Äôre done (see Figure 25‚Äì5). 
 
 
Figure 25‚Äì5. Ejecting the iPod touch from iTunes 

CHAPTER 25:  Troubleshooting 
520 
c. Select Restore from the backup of: and verify that the pull-down 
menu is set to the correct device.  
11. Finally, click Continue. 
12. If you chose to restore, then after a little while you will see a Restore in 
Progress screen on your iPod touch and a status window in iTunes that 
says, ‚ÄúRestoring iPod touch from backup‚Ä¶‚Äù This status window will 
also show a time estimate. 
13. Next, you will see a little pop-up window saying, ‚ÄúThe settings for your 
iPod touch have been restored.‚Äù In a few seconds, you will see your 
iPod touch appear in the left nav bar under DEVICES in iTunes. 
a. If you sync your information with iTunes, all data will be synced now. 
b. If you use iCloud, Exchange, or another sync process, you will 
probably have to reenter passwords on your iPod touch to get 
those sync processes back up and running. 
Additional Troubleshooting and Help Resources 
Sometimes you may encounter a particular issue or question that you cannot find an 
answer to in this book. In the following sections, we will provide some good resources 
that you can access from the iPod touch and from your computer‚Äôs web browser. The 
iPod touch‚Äôs on-device user guide is easy to navigate and can quickly provide you with 
the information you seek. The Apple knowledgebase is helpful if you are facing a 
troubleshooting problem that is proving especially difficult to resolve. The iPhone/iPod 
touch-related web blogs and forums are also good places to locate answers and even 
ask unique questions you might be facing. 
On-Device iPod touch User Guide 
Follow these steps to access the on-device iPod touch user guide: 
1. Open your Safari web browser to view the online user guide for your 
iPod touch. 
2. Tap the Bookmarks button 
 in the bottom row of icons. 
3. Swipe to the bottom of the list and tap iPod touch User Guide. 
If you don‚Äôt see that bookmark, then type this URL into Safari‚Äôs Address bar on your 
iPod touch: http://help.apple.com/ipodtouch. 

CHAPTER 25:  Troubleshooting 
521 
TIP: To view the manual in PDF format from your computer, go to 
http://support.apple.com/manuals/ipodtouch/. 
Once you get to the user guide on your iPod touch, you should see a screen similar to 
the one shown in Figure 25‚Äì6. 
The nice thing is that you already know how to navigate the guide. Tap any topic to see 
more information about a topic‚Äîeither another list of subtopics or more detailed 
information. 
Read the topic or tap another link to learn more. 
You can tap the button on the top right corner of the screen to back out one level.

iPod touch-Related Blogs 
One of the great things about owning an iPod touch is that you immediately join in the 
worldwide camaraderie of iPod touch owners. 
Many iPod touch owners would be classified as enthusiasts and are part of any number 
of iPod touch user groups. These user groups, along with various forums and web sites, 
serve as a great resource for iPod touch users. 
Many of these resources are available right from your iPod touch, and others are web 
sites that you might want to visit on your computer. 
Sometimes you might want to connect with other iPhone and iPod touch enthusiasts, 
ask a technical question, or keep up with the latest and greatest rumors. The blogs are a 
great place to do that. 
Here are a few popular iPod touch (and iPhone or iPad) blogs: 
 www.tipb.com 
 www.iphonefreak.com 
 www.gizmodo.com (iPod touch section) 
TIP: Before you post a new question on any of these blogs, please do a search on the blog to 
make sure your question has not already been asked and answered. Also, make sure you are 
posting your question on the right section (e.g., iPod touch) of the blog. Otherwise, you may incur 
the wrath of the community for not doing your homework first! 
You can also do a web search for ‚ÄúiPod touch blogs‚Äù or ‚ÄúiPod touch news and reviews‚Äù 
to locate more blogs.
