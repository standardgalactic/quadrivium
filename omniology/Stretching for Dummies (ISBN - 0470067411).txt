Dedication
To my newborn daughter Sofia Rose (who arrived on the first deadline of this book), her new
big sister Bella, and my husband Bobby . . . you are my world. And to the many readers who
purchase this book because they need a good stretch — I hope you get one!
Author’s Acknowledgments
Stretching For Dummies is my third book, and once again I have to thank Rob Dyer at Wiley
for encouraging me to write in the first place. I certainly couldn’t have done it without his
guidance. My literary agent, Danielle Egan-Miller, also deserves big thanks for pushing me to
write this book, knowing that the birth of my second daughter was on the horizon (she’s a
mom, too, and knows how hard it is to multitask). That being said, I have to give special
thanks to Madeleine Lewis for all her help . . . I couldn’t have done it without her. 
Writing a book such as this requires a lot of teamwork, so I’d like to thank the entire staff
at Wiley, including Kristin DeMint, my project editor, who was very enthusiastic with the
material and really made the book flow. Lindsay Lefevere, acquisitions editor, who couldn’t
believe there wasn’t a For Dummies book on stretching and called me on Stacy Kennedy’s
suggestion. Copy editor, Carrie Burchfield, for making my sentences flow smoothly, and
photo editor Carmen Krikorian, who once again helped me produce such fantastic photos.
The photographer, Tilden Patterson (who also had a new baby a few weeks after me),
deserves a big thanks for making everybody look so good and for shooting 165 stretches in
one day! You’re awesome, Tilden . . . And special thanks from Madeleine Lewis to Dr. Jerry
Hizon MD, FAAFP, and to Denise Klatte, MPT, for sharing their knowledge and perspective.

Stretching For Dummies 

Introduction
S
tretching is a hot topic these days — just take a look when you attend any sporting
event and you can see multitudes of athletes doing side bends or stretching out their
calves or some other body part. Yes, stretching is good for your body, plus it helps prevent
injuries and manage day-to-day stress!
But what is stretching? Well, it really is best described as any movement that increases your
range of motion and tests your individual ﬂexibility. So for example, stretching can be as
easy as turning your head from side to side or just touching your toes. In fact, some people
call stretching ﬂexibility training because you do just that — train your muscles to be more
ﬂexible through the use of simple movements.
Just think of all the little ways in your daily life that ﬂexibility comes in handy: backing your
car out of the driveway or reaching for something on the top shelf or bending over to tie your
shoe! For those reasons (and many more), stretching keeps your muscles long and pliable
and enhances your life to keep your movements pain free forever (or as long as possible).
About This Book
This book introduces you to various stretch exercises for everyone — no matter what your
age or lifestyle. The chapters in this book can help you develop a regular, everyday stretch
routine or just discover a few new moves to keep you feeling great! The stretches consist of
yoga stretches, children stretches, sports stretches, and more. You also discover how to
prevent workout boredom by adding a few new props, such as a foam roller, a strap, a
block, or my personal favorite, the exercise ball. In addition, I cover simple stretches you
can do at work and on the go or even when you’re simply sitting around.
This book also contains comprehensive stretching sections for special circumstances: preg-
nancy, lower back pain, and even aches and pains. Whatever your interest or age, you’re
sure to get a good stretch and have some fun doing it! Here’s a sampling of some of the
questions that you can ﬁnd answers to:
 How long should I hold a stretch?
 What muscles am I using when I stretch a particular body part?
 Are you supposed to wear shoes when you stretch?
 What kind of changes can I expect to see in my body from stretching?
 How many days a week should I stretch?
 Is it safe to stretch during pregnancy?
 What are the best stretch exercises I can do for back pain?
 Can kids stretch too?
 Can I stretch out my core?
 Is it safe for senior citizens to stretch?
 Are there stretches I can do for menstrual cramps?
 Will the stretches be challenging enough for me if I’m already in shape?
 Are there stretches that can help relieve headaches?

Conventions Used in This Book
This book focuses on stretching in different situations while emphasizing safety and proper
body alignment. Make sure to read the step-by-step instructions located next to the photo
illustrations before you try out any of the stretches. By following that guideline, your
stretches will be easier and safer.
Also keep in mind that most of the stretch illustrations are shown in two stages, labeled with
the ﬁgure number and also with a and b, which demonstrate the beginning and end of poses.
Here are a few additional conventions:
 I use italics to point out any new terms or bits of jargon you should know.
 Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to help them stand out.
 The numbered sets of instructions for the stretches and the keywords in lists appear in
boldface.
What You’re Not to Read
Although I feel that all the information in this book is important, the sidebars that appear in
the gray boxes don’t contain information that you absolutely need to know in order to get a
good stretch. However, these sidebars do contain great tips and information about your
health, so I encourage you to read them at some point.
Foolish Assumptions
This book, like all For Dummies books, has a friendly and approachable tone that assumes
you don’t know a whole lot about stretching — not that you’re an actual dummy! I also make
a few other assumptions about you, the reader:
 You’re interested in stretching and want to make it part of your daily life.
 You don’t have much experience with stretching.
 You’re ready, willing, and able to ﬁnd out more about stretching and how to do the
stretches in this book.
If this sounds like you, then you’ve come to the right place!
How This Book Is Organized
Stretching For Dummies is divided into ﬁve different parts, each one with a unique focus.
You can go directly to whichever part interests you the most or start at the beginning of the
book to gather some information and a checklist of what you need to know before beginning
each stretching chapter. In the following sections, I outline the different parts and what you
can ﬁnd in them.

Stretching For Dummies 

Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s 
of Letting Loose and Snapping Back
If you’re new to stretching, Part I is a great section for you to read ﬁrst. Part I covers all the
important issues you want (and need) to know before you begin your stretch program:
 Who should stretch?
 How often you should stretch?
 What test stretches help you ﬁnd your own individual ﬂexibility?
 What props you can use when you stretch?
 What are the beneﬁts of stretching?
In Part I, I also offer a worksheet (in Chapter 3) to help you determine your ﬂexibility and
chart your progress as you move through your stretching program.
Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes:
Targeting Specific Areas
Part II is organized in a very logical manner — Chapter 4 starts off with a series of upper
body stretches, and then the chapters progress with stretch series that are illustrated for
various individual body parts. Finally, Chapter 8 ﬁnishes with a total body workout to
stretch your entire body.
Because I believe you should work out in a progressive manner (either from the top of the
body moving downward or from the bottom of the body and working upward), I strongly
encourage starting with the upper body in Chapter 4 and progressing through the chapters
until you reach Chapter 8. These chapters concentrate ﬁrst on the upper body, the core, the
lower back, and ﬁnally your lower body.
Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind:
Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs
Part III shows you a variety of stretches that you can adapt to your individual lifestyle. This
part of the book may be the most useful part if you have an issue with stretching during the
workday or if you have a particular sport you do and want to add a few new moves.
In Chapter 9, I tell you how to stretch in bed before getting up in the morning and offer you
a few stretches you can do before turning in for the night. These stretches really get your
day going and then help you wind down and get a good night’s sleep. Chapter 11 contains a
basic warm-up and cool-down routine that can be added to any workout or used alone. You
also ﬁnd a few stretches for tension headaches in Chapter 10. Chapter 12 contains stretches
for various sports that you may be involved in.

Introduction

Part IV: Getting Limber As You Live: 
Stretches for Various Life Stages
Part IV is a fantastic section that focuses on stretching during the special circumstances in
your life. If you’re pregnant, check out Chapter 13. This chapter contains photo illustrations
of stretches and strengthening exercises that help prepare you for that big day.
Chapter 14 is a fun-ﬁlled chapter for stretching for kids. Whether your little ones are 4 years
old (like my daughter Bella in the photos) or 14, they can do these simple and easy move-
ments at home with their friends or brothers and sisters.
The last chapter of Part IV is Chapter 15. The chapter focuses on stretching for seniors. The
exercises are both fun and practical and should keep you strong and ﬂexible for years
to come.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In every For Dummies book, you ﬁnd The Part of Tens. Part V contains two chapters of top-
ten lists of fun facts about the different ways you can stretch and what you can use to
enhance your workout. Chapter 16 lists ten common aches and pains and tells you how
stretching can help get rid of them. And in Chapter 17, I offer ten things you can ﬁnd around
the house to use as stretching accessories. Can you believe a ﬁreplace tool is one of them?
Icons Used in This Book
As you ﬂip through this book, you see a lot of different graphics in the margins. Those pics
are called icons, and they give you useful information along the way. Reading the info in
these icons before you try the actual stretches is helpful because many of them suggest
easier or better ways of performing each one.
Here’s a list of icons used in this book:
The tip icon gives you useful information that (hopefully) makes your life easier as it relates
to stretching and ﬂexibility. I may point you to a speciﬁc chapter or resource or provide
hints to modify an exercise to change the level of difﬁculty.
As you may have guessed, this icon points out really important information that you need
to keep in mind. Very valuable information comes with these icons, so don’t skip ’em!
The warning icon highlights information that keeps you from hurting yourself. You
should read the information next to this icon before you attempt each stretch. You’ll be
glad you did!

Stretching For Dummies 

Where to Go from Here
Stretching For Dummies is a reference guide for beginners and an introduction to performing
stretches. You can start reading at the very beginning of this book to gather a little informa-
tion ﬁrst, or you can dive right in and tear out the yellow Cheat Sheet in the front of this
book to take it with you as you’re running out the door to a stretch class.
If you’re not sure where you want to start, I suggest browsing through the table of contents
to get a sense of exactly what this book covers and what topics interest you. You may ﬁnd
that you already know the basics but have always wanted to know how to use a stretching
strap, so you can immediately ﬂip to that chapter (which is Chapter 3).
If you fall into one of the special circumstances groups, you may want to go directly to that
section to ﬁnd which chapter covers your special needs. (Part IV is the section in question.)
If you’re like me, you may just want to go directly to the workout chapters that pertain to
you to ﬁgure out some new moves.
And if you already know a lot about stretching and just want to brush up on your technique
a bit, you can turn to the index to ﬁnd out which information pertains to you. No matter
where you choose to start, it’s great that you’re here. Enjoy the journey to your new body!

In this part . . .
I
know that you know stretching is good for you, but in
Chapter 1, I cover why stretching is so good for you, and
I answer all your stretching questions: When do I stretch?
Why should I stretch? And how do I stretch? I also get into
the science of stretching, which can lend some insight into
what’s happening inside your muscles as they stretch.
Chapter 2 includes everything you need to know to get
started stretching, including what props you might want
to use and how much space you need. I also give you the
basics of a safe stretching program, including exactly how
each stretch should feel.
And finally, in Chapter 3, I show you how to test your pre-
sent level of flexibility, so you can figure out your starting
point for your new stretching program. I even help you
understand what flexibility is and talk about what you can
change (and what you can’t).

tretching is a powerful tool that you can always have access to and only requires a few
simple movements (kind of like having your own ruby slippers). And the results can
certainly be just like magic: new ease of movement, an increase in your physical capabili-
ties, and deep composure that requires you to do nothing more than breathe.
Many of you may have been taught to fear and dread stretching by overbearing PE teachers
who forced you to touch your toes. But the ideas and techniques I describe in this book
were never heard in your parents’ PE class (or mine for that matter). This training is a
kinder, gentler form of ﬂexibility based on hard science and decades of practical experience.
And the key insight is that stretching is not supposed to hurt!
If this book has one mission, it’s to demonstrate that stretching is easy and simple, or in
other words, stretching is your friend. All the amazing beneﬁts of stretching can be yours
anywhere, anytime, without spending a dime (other than buying this book, of course).
And it’s really just as easy as clicking your heels like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz!
The Why’s of Stretching
Go ahead — ask your doctor, your trainer, your physical therapist, or your chiropractor
whether you should stretch. Get ready to hear the exact same answer from all of them: a
resounding yes. Even though they don’t make a dime giving such advice, why would all
these professionals so enthusiastically recommend stretching? The long list of amazing
answers follows in this section.
You stand taller, look thinner, 
and your body works its best
Correct posture not only makes you look taller and thinner, but also it allows your body to
perform the way it was meant to. What’s more, good posture aids dramatically in facilitating
free and effective breathing.

The main enemy of good posture however is tight muscles! Stretching can help you correct
muscular imbalances that lead to incorrect skeletal alignment. One cause of this kind of
imbalance is using one side of your body more than the other. Times that you may do this
include
 Carrying your toddler on the same side of your body
 Carrying your briefcase in the same hand everyday
 Wearing your shoulder bag on the same shoulder
 Sleeping on the same side
 Using the same shoulder to cradle the phone while you’re talking
 Using the same arm to put around your sweetie on a date
Such chronic imbalances can rob you of energy and efﬁciency in movement, or even result
in back pain. So switch it up, and stretch regularly to help balance out these bad habits.
Also be sure to stand up straight!
You can twist farther and feel looser
Over time, muscles naturally tend to shorten and become tight. So as you age, your ability
to fully utilize movement in your body becomes compromised. Think about it: If a muscle is
already in a chronically shortened state, then it can never attain its full power potential
when you try to contract it because it’s already semicontracted. A tight muscle limits your
range of motion, and you can easily hurt yourself.
A few words to live by: Don’t eat seafood in a month without an “R” in it, let sleeping dogs
lie, and a tight muscle is a weak muscle. Ignore any of these time-tested maxims at your
peril, and chances are, one way or another, you’re going to get bitten.
Stretching increases your ability to function daily — called functional ﬂexibility. This ﬂexibil-
ity helps dramatically increase the range of motion in your joints, which enhances your
performance in your chosen sport and helps in your everyday life by making it possible for
you to reach higher or lower, bend farther, and reduce nagging aches and pains from tight,
tense muscles.
Lack of functional ﬂexibility can make small everyday movements annoying and even
painful.
You help nip injuries in the bud
Numerous studies claim that stretching exercises increase ﬂexibility and decrease the
severity of injuries and the time it takes to recover from an injury. Stretching can actually
reduce the chance of being injured in the ﬁrst place, too!
Stretching reduces muscle sprain or joint strain in case of accidental overstretching of 
muscles or joints when engaging in sports or other physical activities. In short, although
nothing can prevent injury completely, stretching can be a very low-cost, long-term insur-
ance policy for your body — whether you engage in sports or not.

Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s of Letting Loose and Snapping Back 

You keep stress from getting the best of you
Stress is a part of life! Some stress (even a little) is good because it can spur you on to take
action and achieve great things. But too much stress can actually threaten your health and
well being, resulting in depression, anxiety, and memory loss.
Stretching can be therapeutic for many people as one way to relieve stress. (You may
already have an entire arsenal of things you do to relieve stress.) Of course, stretching can
help individual muscles release and relax, but the deep, regular breathing that’s so impor-
tant to effective stretching can also oxygenate your blood and reduce overall stress and
anxiety. What’s more, the slow, meticulous movements in a good ﬂexibility program can pro-
vide a meditative effect. And focusing intensely on the muscles you’re stretching can help
clear your mind of distractions. In the end, stretching can help make you more ﬂexible,
inside and out.
You keep your muscles from feeling achy
Current research suggests that stretching can reduce that post-exercise tight, tender feeling
called delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). For decades many people thought this achy
feeling was the result of lactic acid buildup in the tissues of your muscles. But it turns out
they were wrong because lactic acid is a normal byproduct, resulting from the chemical
reaction of muscle contraction during exercise.
So now cutting-edge thinking attributes this discomfort to tiny tears in muscle ﬁbers caused
by the requirements of unfamiliar training (also known as eccentric movements). By ensur-
ing that your muscles are elastic and you have full range of motion in your joints, stretching
protects you from sustaining the microscopic injuries caused by newly intense levels of
exercise.
Stretching also decreases tension in your muscles and joints. Persistent muscle tightness
can take a toll on your body by choking off blood ﬂow to the muscles, which can result in
raised blood pressure. This tightness can also decrease oxygen and nutrients in the muscle
tissues, which in turn can cause the buildup of toxic waste products in the cells. The end
result is persistent fatigue, as well as aches and pains in your tense muscles.
What’s more, if a muscle stays partially contracted for an abnormally long time, the muscle
can actually begin to shorten, which decreases range of motion and weakens the muscle,
creating tightness and making the muscle less effective. A perpetually contracted muscle
requires more energy to move than a relaxed muscle, so you wind up wasting energy with
every movement.
So start a regular stretching program today to help reduce tension and tenderness in your
muscles; the exercise can actually elevate the level of your overall health. Pretty amazing
just from bending over and touching your toes!
The FAQs When It Comes to Stretching
Who, what, where, when, and why should you stretch? These questions are a few of the
ones that you ﬁnd answers to in the following sections.
11
Chapter 1: Here a Stretch, There a Stretch, Everywhere a Stretch, Stretch

When should I stretch?
Many trainers tell you to stretch either ﬁrst thing in the morning or at the end of the day —
or both. However, the rule of thumb is that you may stretch any time as long as your muscles
are ﬁrst warmed up (which means you’ve done at least ﬁve minutes of walking, hiking, biking,
swimming, or calisthenics such as jumping jacks). Warming up your body properly allows
you to gradually increase your circulation and get your blood ﬂowing, which in turn makes
you more ﬂexible.
Picking a time that’s just right for you, on the other hand, is an entirely different problem.
And trying to force yourself into a schedule that doesn’t really work certainly won’t help
you to stick with any ﬂexibility program. So it’s best to ﬁnd a time of day that’s most con-
venient for you and make that your special time for stretching . . . your body will thank you
for the regular routine, and you’ll soon see results.
How often should I stretch a particular muscle?
To increase ﬂexibility in a muscle, generally you should stretch that muscle at least once a
day. Elite athletes stretch even more than that — two to three times a day. But being realis-
tic, the majority of people aren’t professional athletes (and aren’t getting paid the big bucks
to stay stretched and ﬁt), so ﬁnding the time to stretch that much can be difﬁcult.
If you want to increase your present level of ﬂexibility, engage in a focused ﬂexibility pro-
gram every other day to give your body a chance to rest and rejuvenate in between
sessions. And when this pace of stretching becomes comfortable for you, maintain your
new range of motion by stretching four to ﬁve times a week.
How long should I hold each stretch?
Studies demonstrate that the optimum effectiveness of a stretching exercise is reached after
holding that stretch for approximately 30 seconds. If you stretch less, you don’t really give
your muscles time to fully lengthen and adapt to the exercise; stretching longer hasn’t been
proven to provide any additional beneﬁts either. So stick with the 30-second rule, which
equates to four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
12
Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s of Letting Loose and Snapping Back 
For the scientist in you
If the doctor or scientist inside you is dying to know how
the muscles technically work, here’s the breakdown on
the way your body makes the majority of its movements:
 A primary muscle (the agonist) is assisted by one or
more secondary muscles (the synergists);
 Together they stretch the opposing muscle (the
antagonist).
For example, when you bend your knee, the muscles on
the back of your leg, including your hamstring (the ago-
nist) and your gastrocnemius (your calf — the synergist)
contract, which in turn stretches the quadriceps (the
antagonist). Another example would be during a biceps
curl: The biceps is the agonist, and the triceps is the
antagonist . . . Got it?

How intense should the stretch be?
A stretch should feel no more than slightly uncomfortable. When you reach the point of
resistance in your muscle, hold that stretch. In a few more days of stretching that muscle,
you’ll be able to comfortably move past that point.
When it comes to stretching, the old cliché “no pain, no gain” is dead wrong. In fact, pain is
the most precise indicator of a stretch that has gone too far, either in degree or in duration.
If you’re stretching to the point where your muscle sizzles inside, or is quivering, or you
actually ﬁnd that you’re becoming less ﬂexible, back off. If you force a stretch, the strain can
only set you back further than you were when you started.
Should I see a doctor before I begin
a stretching program?
You should always consult a physician before embarking on any new ﬁtness program —
even a seemingly low-impact program such as stretching. And speaking to your healthcare
professional is crucial before undertaking a regular ﬂexibility program if you have arthritis,
osteoporosis, or an injury that hasn’t healed completely.
Try the stretches in Chapter 16, which are speciﬁcally for common aches and pains. And
your doctor can advise you about speciﬁc stretches to focus on or to avoid and can help
customize a stretching program to help meet your unique needs.
Should I stretch my muscles 
in a particular sequence?
After stretching a particular muscle group, you want to move on to a completely different
muscle group so you don’t overly fatigue that one group. The following list is my suggestion
of the order in which to stretch your muscles:
1. Back (see Chapters 4 and 6)
2. Sides (see Chapters 5 and 8)
3. Neck (see Chapters 4 and 8)
4. Forearm and wrists (see Chapters 4, 8, 10, and 12)
5. Triceps (see Chapters 4, 8, and 12)
6. Chest (see Chapters 4, 8, 10, and 12)

Chapter 1: Here a Stretch, There a Stretch, Everywhere a Stretch, Stretch

Of course you can stretch one, some, or a handful of these areas, and if you stretch slowly
and with control, you still receive all the beneﬁts stretching has to offer. The model of the
steps above is just one (really good) example of a progressive, complementary, full-body
routine.
Differentiating between Two 
Types of Stretches
Stretching always bears the same concepts: to lengthen muscles and improve the range of
motion in joints. But just like ice cream, stretching comes in different ﬂavors. The two main
categories of stretching techniques are dynamic stretches and static stretches. Dynamic
stretches involve movement, whereas static stretches are held steadily. Because both of these
techniques have different beneﬁts and advantages, I cover both in this book.
Static stretches
Static stretching involves stretching to the farthest point you comfortably can and then
holding the stretch (usually for 30 seconds). This technique is used primarily throughout
this book for two reasons:
 They’re the simplest and easiest form of stretching to master and perform correctly, so
they’re excellent for anyone new to ﬂexibility training.
 The simplicity of the movements and the slow and gentle pace allow for mindful relax-
ation of the entire body.
Holding a comfortable position for 30 seconds or so allows your muscles to actually become
accustomed to being stretched, which reduces your stretch reﬂex — a natural mechanism
whereby a muscle under stress automatically contracts to protect itself. A gentle static
stretch overcomes this natural defense mechanism and allows your muscles to efﬁciently
relax and let go.
In the interests of full disclosure, static stretching can be further divided into two different
types: static-passive and static-active.
 Static-passive stretches are stretches in which you assume a position and hold it for an
extended period of time, using an external force such as your hands or strap or some
type of stationary support such as a chair or a dancer’s barre. Because this type of
stretch is so accessible and straightforward, I choose to recommend it in this book.
 Static-active stretches are more advanced positions in which you stretch one muscle by
contracting the opposing muscle (for example, stretching your hamstring by holding
your extended leg as high off the ground as you can).
Although this stretching technique is highly effective when it comes to improving
sports performance (see Chapter 12 for sports-speciﬁc stretches), it requires a more
advanced level of strength and balance, which usually comes after a few months of rou-
tine stretching sessions.

Dynamic stretches
Simply put, dynamic stretching is a stretching technique that involves movement. When per-
forming a dynamic stretch you simply use the weight of a portion of your body, such as a
limb, to help overcome inertia in a tight muscle. You gently control the twisting of your
torso or the swinging of your arms or legs in a movement that approaches the limit of your
range of motion. The key word in that last sentence is control — dynamic stretches shouldn’t
be executed by bouncing or jerking. Think of your twisting or swinging motions as purpose-
ful movements, almost like choreography.
A dynamic stretch that’s being repeatedly forced beyond a comfortable range of motion is
called a ballistic stretch. Ballistic stretching can be painful, counterproductive, and even
cause injury. Bent over toe touching with a bouncing movement is a good example and is
usually used by athletes who want to increase their range of motion. This type of stretching
isn’t used in this book.
Dynamic stretches should also develop progressively. Start moving through the stretch
slowly and with a small range of motion. Gradually increase the range of motion until, even-
tually, after 8 to 12 repetitions, the move has reached its full range of motion and maximum
controlled pace.
When One Just Ain’t Enough: 
Stretching with a Partner
A helpful, caring partner can be the ultimate stretching prop (for more info on props, see
Chapter 3). A partner can
 Gently urge you deeper into a position than you may be able to do yourself
 Help you get far more out of your ﬂexibility routine than you may be able to on
your own
Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages:
 Your partner can’t feel what you feel every moment.
 Your partner can’t respond to your discomfort as quickly as you may like.
 Your partner may force you into a deeper position than you’re ready for.
 Your partner can move you too quickly, which can initiate the stretch reﬂex (see “Static
stretches” earlier in the chapter for more info on the stretch reﬂex).
These instances can be a source of accidental injury, so maintain consistent communication
with your partner to avoid uncomfortable situations.
In addition, using a partner is ideal for two types of stretches: isometric stretching and PNF
stretching. Although I don’t describe any of these types of exercises in this book, more
advanced exercisers can adapt these techniques to the stretches I describe for beginners.
Check out the next sections for the lowdown on these types of partner stretches.

Chapter 1: Here a Stretch, There a Stretch, Everywhere a Stretch, Stretch

Isometric stretching
Isometric stretching is a type of static stretch in which you tense a muscle in order to reduce
tension in it. Sounds counterintuitive, doesn’t it? Think of it as stretching in reverse.
The word isometric is comprised of the preﬁx “iso” (same) with “metric” (distance), indicat-
ing that in this type of exercise the length of the muscle doesn’t change as a result of the
ﬂexing of a joint.
One of the best ways to perform an isometric stretch is to have a partner apply resistance
against the muscle you want to stretch. For example, have a partner hold your extended leg
up while you try to push it back down to the ground. Tensing your hamstring against that
resistance actually reduces tension in the hamstring muscle. Plus, an extra added bonus of
this type of stretching is that you can actually increase strength (a little) in the muscles you
contract.
Static-isometric-static stretching
Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching is a big, fat phrase that means a
static stretch, followed by an isometric stretch, followed by a deeper static stretch. In fact,
PNF isn’t really a type of stretch at all; it’s more properly a stretching technique.
After comfortably holding a static stretch, your partner can add resistance to create an iso-
metric stretch (see preceding section). The big payoff comes when the isometric stretch is
released, and then after 10 to 15 seconds, your partner helps you move even deeper into
the stretch than you were in the initial passive stretch. This addition is only made possible
because of the concentrated stretch provided by the isometric stretch. But the end result is
a more thorough stretch than you would ever have been able to achieve on your own.
I don’t recommend PNF stretching (or isometric stretching for that matter) for children or
anyone who may still be growing. Also, this type of stretch shouldn’t be performed on a
given muscle group more than once a day, or ideally, once per 36-hour period.
The Science of Stretching
This entire book is based on the miraculous capability of our bodies to adapt to the physi-
cal demands placed on them. Before you can use stretching to your beneﬁt, you need to
understand how it works, how it nurtures you, and how to maintain your body through
stretching. No machine created has the awesome regenerative capability of the human
body, so it’s up to you to ﬁgure out how to properly take care of yourself and use stretching
in that process.
What happens inside my muscles 
when I stretch them?
Visualizing and knowing what your body is doing while you’re stretching is just as impor-
tant as visualizing and knowing what muscle you’re using when you’re lifting weights
(see Chapter 3 on testing your ﬂexibility). So begins your science lesson for today . . . 
and, if you’re anything like me, you have little interest in science, so I’ll try to be brief and
get right to the point!

Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s of Letting Loose and Snapping Back 

The stretching of a muscle begins with the most elementary unit in the muscle ﬁber —
the sarcomere. As the sarcomere is stretched, the overlap of the myoﬁlaments decreases,
allowing the muscle ﬁber to elongate (Whew! Now that’s a mouthful). At that point, the 
surrounding connective tissue gives way to the force of your stretch and it also stretches.
In other words, the greater number of myoﬁlaments you can stretch, the greater ﬂexibility
you have in the muscle.
What is flexibility?
Flexibility is the extent to which your body is able to bend — without breaking or injury.
So when you get right down to it, ﬂexibility is a function of the number of muscle ﬁbers
you have been able to coerce into lengthening and the number of them you can keep
lengthened.
Flexibility occurs when an electrical signal transmits from a nerve into the muscle ﬁbers
and stimulates the ﬂow of calcium, causing the sarcomere to shorten, which generates
force. When billions of sarcomeres in the muscle shorten all at once, the result is a total and
complete contraction of the entire muscle ﬁber. Think of muscle ﬁbers as being digital —
they’re either contracted or they’re not. On/Off. But if there’s no such thing as a partially
contracted muscle ﬁber, how does the force of a muscle contraction vary in strength from
strong to weak? Strength is a function of total muscle ﬁbers involved — the greater the
demand, the larger number of muscle ﬁbers recruited to do the work.
Likewise, the length of the stretched muscle depends on the number of stretched ﬁbers,
which means that the more precise and thorough your stretching movements are — the
more ﬁbers you can involve — the greater beneﬁt you receive from them.
How can I keep my muscles and joints stretched?
If you don’t take your ﬂexibility for granted, you can keep your muscle and joints stretched.
Muscles are naturally inclined to contract for their own protection, so the only way to keep
them elongated, and to keep your connective tissue lengthened, is to regularly stretch them.
Remember, when it comes to stretching, the old saying “use it or lose it” truly applies.

In This Chapter

 Personalizing your stretches with props
 Knowing how to stay injury free
 Getting the most out of your stretching program through proper form
 Taking a minute to relax
T
he more you know about your body, the more power you have to improve your ﬂexibility.
I’m not saying you have to take a course in kinesiology or know where all 650 muscles in
your body attach (whew!), but a quick refresher course in the major muscle groups of your
body may help you identify if the stretch is coming from the right place and also help you
understand why you feel the stretch as you move through the exercises.
Even though you’re getting this lesson as the ﬁrst step in ﬂexibility training, before you start
stretching you should look at the anatomy drawings in Chapters 4–7. They provide a visual
reference of the origin (where the muscle starts) and the insertion (where the muscle attaches)
of the major muscles. These pictures help you understand why placing your body in a cer-
tain position stretches certain muscles and how to stretch those muscles most effectively.
After you have a general knowledge of the muscles in your body, you’re one step closer to a
more ﬂexible you!
Getting Your Stretch On: The 
How To’s of Stretching
Even if you consider stretching simple and easy, you have to give yourself every advantage
to make your stretching experience successful. The following sections give you a wealth of
knowledge and tips to ensure that your ﬂexibility program is totally tight . . . I mean, you
know, very effective.
Creating space fit for stretching
One of the most fundamental and most often overlooked aspects of ﬂexibility training
(as with most workout programs) is commitment, and true commitment is reﬂected both
externally — by creating a speciﬁc, special place to stretch — and internally — getting 
yourself into the right frame of mind.
If you’ve ever been to a yoga class, you know what I mean by getting in the right frame of
mind (an open neat space with soft, serene music and a teacher who whispers). All these
external and internal factors add up to a better stretching experience, so you can look for-
ward to your next stretching session even more.

Organizing your surroundings
Here are a few things you can do to keep your space (external factor) uncluttered:
 Establish a space large enough to extend your body fully. You may have to move
some of the furniture around you, but there’s nothing more annoying than having to
move things while you’re stretching. Get it taken care of ahead of time and you won’t
have to deal with the interruption while you’re stretching.
 Make the room warm. An ideal stretching room is a warm room because your muscles
respond more to stretching when they’re warm. So don’t crank up the air conditioner
just because you hate to sweat.
Because stretching can’t be hurried or rushed, you have to move slowly and deliberately.
Such an attitude should also be reﬂected in your mental approach (next section).
Collecting your thoughts
Here are a few things you can do to keep your mind (internal factor) uncluttered:
 Relaxing music: You can buy instrumental or relaxation CDs that deﬁnitely allow you
to unwind more easily and help you have a great mind/body experience.
 Planning ahead: Make sure that your workout isn’t interrupted. Turn off the phone,
put your Blackberry where you can’t see it, and tell your kids you’ve moved away to
join the circus. (Okay, maybe not the last one. Just say interruptions are for emergen-
cies only!)
Getting dressed
Unlike in packed, sweaty group exercise classes, the optimum outﬁt for stretching isn’t one
that makes you look good, it’s one that makes you feel good. And what I ﬁnd makes me feel
good is clothes that don’t get in the way. Always wear comfortable clothing that doesn’t
bind or restrict your movement but that still enables you to see your body so you can tell
what you’re actually doing.
Ballet dancers wear leotards and tights so they can see if their back is arched or straight
and the same principle applies for stretching . . . you have to be able to see what your body
is doing so you can focus on speciﬁc muscles. Therefore, I ﬁnd a tank top and a pair of
tights or a nice ﬁtting T-shirt with shorts works best when I’m stretching.
Give Yourself Props! How to 
Personalize Each Stretch
A prop isn’t just part of a movie set anymore. A prop can be used for stretching and is some-
thing such as a strap, a towel, a chair, or a block that you can use to make a stretch more
comfortable, accessible, and even more effective (see Chapter 17 for more prop ideas).
Props have a wide variety of beneﬁts:
 Beginners and the less ﬂexible can use them to perform a stretch that they may other-
wise not be able to manage.
 By providing support and reducing tension, props can help you position your body
more correctly, which not only helps make your stretches as deep and effective as pos-
sible but also helps decrease the chance of injury.
 For more experienced exercisers, props allow you to deepen and intensify the stretch.
20
Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s of Letting Loose and Snapping Back 

I recommend using props for any stretch that you want to help make more comfortable,
well balanced, and tension free. The next sections include some of my favorite props that
enhance your stretching experience. You can also ﬁnd more props in Chapter 17. The props
in that chapter are handy things that you should have lying around the house!
Strap or towel
A stretching strap is a length of slightly elastic material that you can use to increase your
reach. Many brands have several loops in which you can place your hands or feet to cus-
tomize the strap to your height and ﬂexibility. This elasticity helps increase your chance of
achieving a comfortable, passive static stretch for a variety of muscles. No matter what the
stretch, a strap can also help keep your upper back relaxed, which keeps your spine in neu-
tral position and avoids scrunching or rounding of your back.
A yoga strap is another prop that you can use and it’s usually made of cotton and comes in
6- or 8-foot lengths. Yoga straps typically don’t have the loops usually found on stretching
straps. Instead, a yoga strap has a buckle that allows you to create a loop in one end of the
strap. The 6-foot strap will probably be long enough for most of you, but if you’re over 6 feet
tall, you may want to try the 8-foot length. These straps are easy to ﬁnd on the Internet or at
a local yoga center.
A towel isn’t as customizable as a stretching strap or a yoga strap, but it’s a great substitute
if neither of the straps is available or if you simply don’t want to spend the money. A hand
towel is a little small, so use a gym towel or small bath towel to have plenty of length to
work with. But if you plan on making stretching a permanent part of your ﬁtness routine
(which I highly recommend), purchase a strap of your own. It’s a small investment of less
than ten bucks, and you won’t regret it.
Blocks
Using a yoga block under your buttocks, feet, or hands helps you maintain proper body
alignment during stretches so you can focus on deepening your stretch without pain. The
cost of one block is usually around $10, and you can ﬁnd blocks at most yoga studios or
your local superstore.
If you love to shop online, hop on the Internet and type in yoga props and choose from the
nearly one million sites that pop up.
Also, if you don’t want to invest in a block just yet, I bet you have a phone book sitting
around the house. Even sitting on a folded towel helps give you the lift off the ﬂoor.
Chair
A chair can add stability to standing stretches and can also help you get into stretches that
require stress-free support of your torso. A chair is particularly useful for seniors or anyone
with mobility issues. It’s also one of the best props to help a sedentary person get started
with a ﬂexibility program. For stretches that use a chair, check out Chapter 8 for total body
workouts, Chapter 10 for stretches during the workday, and Chapter 15 — stretches for 
seniors.
Make sure to use a sturdy chair without arms or wheels and that’s not too cushy.

Chapter 2: Preparing for a More Flexible You

Swiss ball
No, the Swiss ball isn’t a ball of cheese. It’s similar to the chair, but it allows you to get into
some stretches more comfortably than if you had to lie down on the ﬂoor. Lying with your
tummy on the ball is great for stretching out your lower back, and using the Swiss ball to
replace your chair at work helps you strengthen your core as you stretch out your legs and
back. For another example of a ball stretch, check out the chest stretch in Chapter 14.
If you’ve never used a stretching ball before or if you just want some stretches that use the
Swiss ball, check out another book I wrote: Exercise Balls For Dummies (Wiley).
Foam roller
The foam roller is a lightweight cylinder that comes in many different sizes. When stretch-
ing, you can use the foam roller as a prop to make positions more comfortable by
supporting your back or other body parts, thereby allowing you to keep good form and
proper alignment.
Physical therapists and private trainers use this prop to improve balance, body awareness,
and ﬂexibility in their patients. But what really makes the foam roller unique from other
props is that you can actually use it to release muscular tension and pain.
Imagine a rubber band that has a knot in it — no matter how much you stretch that rubber
band you’ll never get rid of the knot. Everyone gets a muscle with a knot (localized tightness
often caused by tension or overuse) and sometimes stretching isn’t enough. That’s where
the foam roller comes in handy.
By positioning your body to slowly roll on the foam roller you can actually release the knots
in your muscles. Here’s a great example of how you use a foam roller to release tension in
your back:
1. Lie on the ﬂoor with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle and your feet ﬂat on the
ﬂoor.
2. Flatten your back by pressing your back into the ﬂoor and gently contracting your
abdominal muscles and buttocks without raising your ribcage.
3. Repeat the same ﬂat back position with a foam roller.
• Lie on the roller with hips and knees ﬂexed and feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
• Keep your back ﬂat and in contact with the roam roller.
4. Add a few movements to your stable core position by slowly rolling your body back
and forth while the foam roller is pressing into your back.
5. To strengthen your core, raise one leg while maintaining a neutral spine and lower
the leg and raise the other leg.
Alternate raising and lowering your legs, making sure to keep your back in contact with
the foam roller at all times.
The cost of a foam roller is about $25 — a heck of a lot cheaper than a massage or a visit to
your chiropractor!

Refraining from Hurting Yourself
Some of the key points to stretching are to stay relaxed and comfortable and to enjoy your-
self. But you also need to follow a few simple guidelines before you stretch. These strategies
and techniques ensure that you take care of your body, prevent injuries, and get the most
out of your ﬂexibility training.
Warm-up
The number-one rule with stretching is to warm up before you stretch! Many people
think that stretching and warming up are synonymous, but stretching involves length-
ening your muscles, while warming up means that you’re elevating your core body
temperature.
A muscle can’t stretch properly if it’s cold. Elevating your body temperature makes the
process of extending and lengthening your muscles and the connective tissue around your
muscles easier. These lengthenings and extensions reduce the chances of injury caused by
stretching and actually increase the effectiveness of the stretch.
Here are some simple ﬁve-minute exercises to get those muscles warmed up:
 Performing jumping jacks
 Jumping rope
 Jogging in place
 Swimming laps
 Dancing around to your favorite song
I know this section probably shattered your conception of warming up, but now that you
know the truth (that stretching and warming up describe two completely different
processes), remember this: You can warm up without stretching, but you should never
stretch without warming up.
For more information on how to integrate stretches into your warm-up, check out
Chapter 11.
Go slowly
If stretching had a theme song it would be “The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin’ Groovy)” by
Simon and Garfunkel. You may know the words:
Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feelin’ groovy
23
Chapter 2: Preparing for a More Flexible You

When you stretch you should move slowly; breathe and hold the stretch for at least 30 sec-
onds. At ﬁrst you may actually need to watch a clock to know how long 30 seconds is, but as
you get more comfortable with stretching and more in tune with your body, you instinctively
know how long to hold the stretch. For me, it’s about four or ﬁve deep breaths. Keep your
mind focused on the stretch and on breathing slowly and deeply. Don’t think about all the
things you have to do today or what you’re going to cook for dinner, just stay focused on
going slow and feelin’ groovy!
To help prevent injuries, start each stretch in what I call the comfort zone — the point in the
stretch where you just begin to feel mild tension in the muscle. Start out by stretching for
30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths before trying a second repetition. As you
increase repetitions, it helps if you imagine every exhale you take as allowing you to move
an inch deeper into the stretch. Believe it or not, the slower you go in the beginning, the
more quickly you’ll see results! See “Progress through the stretch” later in this chapter for
more info on the progression.
Don’t bounce
The second crucial guideline to keep in mind is no bouncing! Bouncing during your stretch-
ing actually causes damage to the muscle. Stretching a muscle quickly or forcefully makes
your body kick into a natural protective mechanism called the stretch reﬂex — a nerve
response to stress that tells the muscle to contract to protect itself. In other words, 
bouncing to help your muscles relax and let go can actually cause them to contract and
get tighter.
And what’s more, every time you forcefully bounce while in a stretch you actually create
microscopic tears in the muscle ﬁbers. You may feel like bouncing increases your ﬂexibility
immediately, but that’s only because you have damaged the muscle. In the end, your body
heals those little tears with scar tissue, which actually decreases your long-term ﬂexibility,
because scar tissue is far less ﬂexible than muscle.
Progress through the stretch
I like to think of each stretch progressing through three different stages:
1. Comfort zone: The ﬁrst 10 to 15 seconds
This term describes the initial period of the stretch where you ﬁnd a comfortable posi-
tion, give yourself a body check, and make sure your alignment is good. You should
also feel a mild tension in the muscle group that you’re stretching.
2. Relaxation zone: The next 5 to 15 seconds
This period in the stretch focuses on your breathing and relaxation — letting stress
and tension melt away from both your body and mind. You may feel the stretch deepen
slightly.
3. Deep stretch zone: The last 5 to 10 seconds
You’ve now held the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds. Your body is relaxed, and you know
that you’re in correct position because you feel a slight tension precisely in the
intended area. Remember you want to feel slight discomfort, not pain!
24
Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s of Letting Loose and Snapping Back 

All the stretches in this book should be approached in the progressive fashion above. Never
try to begin a stretch fully extended. Take your time and slowly and gradually move deeper
with each breath, allowing the muscle to relax and giving your body the time to produce the
correct neuromuscular response.
Remember to breathe
You may think that I am silly for telling you to breathe, but trust me; during a stretch 
(especially a hard one) you focus so hard that you forget to breathe and you tend to hold
your breath instead. The only way to stretch a muscle fully is to relax and practice slow,
rhythmic breathing. To simplify things, try to remember to exhale so your body automati-
cally inhales. Don’t make it any more complicated than that for right now. See “The Art of
Breathing Correctly” later in this chapter for more information.
Know your limits
Stretching can help you understand both your possibilities and your limits. Stretching is
supposed to be energizing and relaxing, not painful. Never do anything that hurts! You may
not believe it right now, but ﬂexibility training should not be painful. In fact, if you feel pain
of any kind, let up on the stretch immediately.
Not everyone is able to do the perfect splits, and you don’t need to. Stretching isn’t a com-
petition; it’s about determining your current level of ﬂexibility, whatever that may be, and
improving on that foundation. Different people begin with different foundations. What matters
most is that you’re able to make yourself more ﬂexible than you were. This increased ﬂexibil-
ity can help improve your performance in your favorite sports and activities, and, by making
movement more ﬂuid, easy, and graceful, help enhance the overall quality of your life.
Maintaining Proper Body Alignment
Proper body alignment is your guarantee that you’re getting the most out of your stretches.
Why? Because when you maintain proper body alignment — back straight, shoulders down,
chest lifted, abs tight — you optimize the mechanics of your body so your stretches are
properly anchored and the muscle you’re focusing on is fully lengthened. You also won’t
unintentionally put stress and strain on other parts of your body, which can be counterproduc-
tive to what you’re trying to achieve. Pay attention to what every part of your body is doing.
Several studies suggest that a relationship exists between ﬂexibility and posture.
Researchers have found that imbalances in muscular development or tension can con-
tribute to poor posture. For example, tight hamstrings can cause the pelvis to tilt up
unnaturally, which can reduce the lumbar curve, exaggerate the thoracic curve, and 
possibly cause low back pain. This section explains how stretching can have a positive
effect on posture and how proper posture can have a positive effect on stretching.
You may notice that one side of your body is more ﬂexible than the other. This imbalance is
very common, so don’t worry about it — and be sure to not go easy on the side that is less
ﬂexible. Really focus and try to increase your range of motion until both sides are even.
25
Chapter 2: Preparing for a More Flexible You

Don’t slouch (Darn it — Mom’s right again)
Poor posture, or slouching, is unattractive, and it can lead to poor breathing, upper back
tension, and inefﬁcient movement. One common cause of slouching is shortened chest mus-
cles and weak upper back muscles. The imbalance of the two pulls the shoulders forward.
The solution: stretching your chest and strengthening your back, which you ﬁnd out how to
do in Chapters 4 and 8. And in the meantime, try to be aware of your posture and make sure
that you stand erect and sit up straight.
Introducing the neutral spine
Throughout this book I remind you to ﬁnd or maintain neutral spine. You may be wondering
what the heck that means but just remember you have a natural curve in your back when
you relax. So I’m making sure that you don’t exaggerate or minimize the way your spine is
naturally shaped.
Your spine has four natural curves:
1. The cervical (the curve in your neck)
2. The thoracic (the slightly rounded shape in your upper back)
3. The lumbar (the sway of your lower back)
4. The sacrum (the tilt of your pelvic region)
In ﬂexibility training, neutral spine has three positions: lying on your back, sitting, and
standing. Start each stretch in neutral spine because incorrect spinal position not only
diminishes the effectiveness of the stretch but also promotes muscular imbalance and bad
posture. Every time you start in correct alignment you retrain your muscles to properly sup-
port your spine.
Although exercising is excellent therapy for your spine, many people make simple but cru-
cial mistakes in the position of their spine while exercising. These mistakes can place a
great deal of stress on the spine. Some of the most common are
 Decreasing the curve in the lower back by “tucking” the pelvis under
 Excessively arching the back by tilting the pelvis backward
 Exaggerating the thoracic curve by rounding the shoulders forward and tightening the
shoulder muscles
 Lifting and opening the rib cage while reaching overhead
 Forgetting that the neck is actually part of your spine
 Letting the chin drop down or the head jut forward
Positioning your pelvis
The area of the pelvis is the main hinge between the torso and the lower body, so correct
positioning of the pelvis is crucial for lower body stretches involving the hips, thighs, and
buttocks. Because these large muscles are all attached in one way or another to the pelvis,
incorrect positioning of the pelvis can cause these lower body stretches to be inefﬁcient or
even actually counterproductive.
26
Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s of Letting Loose and Snapping Back 

To ﬁnd the proper pelvic position that you should maintain while you’re stretching, try
standing in front of a mirror and turning sideways. Stand up tall so your body is in a straight
line from head to toe. This position is the correct position you want to have in your pelvis.
You don’t want to do the following:
 Tilt your pelvis forward — described as “tucking your pelvis under”
 Arch your back and let your buttocks stick out
The Art of Breathing Correctly
Believe it or not, you breathe in and out more than 20,000 times a day, and yet, most of the
time you do it incorrectly. I can hear you asking, “How is it possible to breathe wrong? Air
goes in; air goes out. How can something so simple be any more complicated?” Well, due to
poor posture or lack of body awareness, you end up using the wrong muscles to breathe.
The end result is shallow, ineffective breathing that robs you of all the full beneﬁts of your
breath. Poor posture — with a rounded back, dropped shoulders, and a forward head —
reduces the ability of the diaphragm to contract and the ribs to expand to their full potential.
The lung itself has no muscles, so it’s totally dependent on the muscles around it to create
the respiratory process of inhaling and exhaling. This can happen two ways: by using the
muscles that lift and lower the ribcage or by using the muscles of the diaphragm.
Unfortunately, most people use the shoulder and chest muscles to facilitate the respiratory
process of inhaling and exhaling. Although these muscles are large and powerful, breathing
isn’t really what they were designed for. Instead, the primary location of the movement of
respiration should be the diaphragm, which only has one function: breathing.
Here are some healthy breathing tips that you can ﬁnd an example of in Chapter 8:
 Inhale through your nose, ﬁlling your chest with air and letting your belly expand. This
technique allows your nose to ﬁlter and warm the air before your body uses it.
 Make sure that your shoulders stay relaxed and don’t raise up around your ears when
you’re breathing.
 Exhale through your mouth, consciously using your deep abdominal muscles and
diaphragm to push the air out (belly will deﬂate).
Just remember, to get all these wonderful beneﬁts, you need to breathe the way your body
was designed — from your core.
Relaxing and Letting Go
One of the most important beneﬁts of stretching is its ability to promote relaxation not only
of your body but also of your mind and spirit. The slow, methodical movements in a good
ﬂexibility program provide gentle movements as you position your body for the next
stretch, followed by periods of quiet stillness as you hold the stretch. Concentrated focus
on the muscles you’re stretching helps block out other stress-inducing thoughts (you know,
those thoughts of your schedule, your ﬁnances, your kids, and so on). In this way, stretch-
ing can not only lengthen your muscles but also expand your mental horizon.
27
Chapter 2: Preparing for a More Flexible You

When you stretch, keep the following in mind:
 You should feel slight tension in the muscle that you intend to stretch. This tension
should deﬁnitely not cross the line into pain or discomfort.
 You should feel a stretch only in the intended muscle, never in a joint. Pain in your
joints signals irritation in the joint, so you deﬁnitely want to let up if that happens.
 Your body should be in a position that’s relaxed and totally tension free. If your body
feels awkward or tense, modify the stretch, or use a prop such as a strap or block 
(covered earlier in this chapter) so you can focus on the intended muscle.
 Stretching should be a positive experience, not a form of self-torture.
Throughout this book I give you several different stretches for each muscle group. If one
doesn’t seem to ﬁt your body, try one that feels more comfortable.

Chapter 3
Testing Your Flexibility to Establish 
Your Stretching Routine
In This Chapter
 Understanding what factors affect your ﬂexibility
 Determining your own ﬂexibility through self-testing
 Recording your results and tracking your improvements
S
ome people are fast runners; some people are good singers; some people are ﬂexible —
and some people aren’t. But when it comes to ﬂexibility, it’s really a question of degrees.
While it’s important to have a healthy range of motion in all your muscles and joints just to
live a balanced, healthy, injury-free life, being superﬂexible is really only necessary if you’re
a professional dancer or gymnast (so don’t get discouraged if you can’t put your foot
behind your head!). This chapter is designed to help you determine how ﬂexible you really
are and which areas of your body need the most attention so you can become as ﬂexible as
can be.
Coming to Terms with the Factors of Flexibility
Before you can set a reasonable goal, you need to understand what’s achievable and what
isn’t. Everyone can’t get a job with the Cirque du Soleil or do the splits, but not everyone
should for the simple reason that not every body is designed to bend that way.
Several factors determine your ﬂexibility, and you can change some of those factors and
some you can’t. But before you can work on making improvements in your ﬂexible status,
you have to be realistic. In the following sections, I present several areas of the body that
you can improve on. Take a look at the factors in each category to see what differences you
can make in your body with ﬂexibility. And then check out the things that you can’t change.
What you can change
Flexibility is the ability of your body to move through the required range of motion to 
perform the activity at hand. But what happens if you don’t have ﬂexibility in your body?
You may be uncoordinated or tense, but here are some factors you can positively alter in
your life to get the most out of your ﬂexibility training:
 Muscle tension: If a muscle is tense or in a state of contraction then it can’t increase in
ﬂexibility. It’s important to be in a state of relaxation to get the full beneﬁts of stretch-
ing (see Chapter 2 for tips on relaxing).

 Lack of coordination and body awareness: Lack of coordination can limit your ability
to stretch the targeted muscle, therefore diminishing the effectiveness of the stretch.
You have to pay attention to what’s happening to your muscles as you stretch and you
have to be mindful of your movement, all the while continually improving your form.
 Lifestyle: Eat right, exercise regularly, and adhere to your ﬂexibility training. Practice
makes perfect, and that advice applies to becoming more ﬂexible, too.
 Warming up: You need to make sure to warm up your muscles before you stretch.
When a muscle and the connective tissue around that muscle are warm they stretch
more easily and with less resistance — and you get more beneﬁt from your stretching
routines. Check out Chapter 11 for some ways to warm up properly.
 Your attitude: You’ll never see your best results without a positive attitude. Of course
that philosophy applies to more in life than just stretching, but focus on ﬂexibility
training for now.
What you can’t change
To avoid any unrealistic expectations, remember that there are some physical factors that
everyone has in common that simply can’t be changed. Yes, genetics do play a big part in
individual ﬂexibility, so I guess it’s okay to blame your family for this one . . . sorry mom!
 Your gender: Research indicates that, in general, women are more ﬂexible than men.
One reason could be because of bone structure because, for example, women usually
have broader and shallower hips, which give them a potential for greater range of
motion in the pelvic area.
 Your age: The aging process diminishes normal muscle function, including strength,
endurance, and ﬂexibility. Lost muscle mass is replaced with fat and collagen. Collagen
is the main component in connective tissue and is highly inﬂexible. Although aging is,
of course, inevitable, you can greatly slow down this process with your lifestyle
choices, such as eating right, exercising, and stretching regularly!
 Elasticity of connective tissue in muscles or joints: Don’t think of ﬂexibility in terms of
your whole body; think in terms of the range of motion of each joint. And each of the
joints in your body is made up of bones, muscles, and three types of connective tissue:
• Tendons: Tendons connect muscle to bone, and they drag the bone along when
the muscle moves. Firm, strong tendons are a good thing because without them
your muscles would be inefﬁcient and unstable. You don’t focus on stretching the
tendons in this book.
• Ligaments: Ligaments connect bone to bone (such as the bones in your knees
and in your elbows) and play a large role in the stability of a joint and how much
range of motion is possible in that joint. Because you don’t want wiggly knees or
elbows, you don’t want to stretch your ligaments, either.
• Fascia: This tissue is the rest of the connective tissue in your body. You can ﬁnd
fascia under the skin, deep in your body surrounding your organs and within your
muscles, holding the ﬁbers of the muscle together in a compact, efﬁcient bunch.
As much as 30 percent of a muscle is fascia, but the precise percentage is deter-
mined solely by genetics, so the amount of fascia in your muscles can play a large
role in how tight or ﬂexible your muscles can be. If you were born with a high per-
centage of fascia in your muscles, chances are you will be less ﬂexible overall.
 Your bone and joint structure limitations: You can thank Mom and Dad for your bone
structure. Plain and simple, some people’s joints allow more range of motion than
others. Get over it. Just like your childhood.

Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s of Letting Loose and Snapping Back 

Testing Yourself Before (and While,
and After) You Go Gumby-Like
The very best motivation to stick with an exercise program is seeing results, which is why
I’ve developed the ﬂexibility self-test I include in the next section. The test helps you accom-
plish two important goals:
 Indicates where you’re tight and where your imbalances may be so you know where
to focus your stretching program: For example, by doing this self-test, you may dis-
cover that your quadriceps (muscles in the front of your thigh) are tight but you have
a healthy range of motion in your hamstrings (muscles in the back of your thigh).
Eventually this imbalance between these two opposing muscle groups may lead to an
injury. Thanks to this self-test you now have the information to prevent that from hap-
pening by putting more time and effort into stretching your quadriceps and less on
your hamstrings.
Another common imbalance that leads to injury or postural problems is being tighter
on one side of your body than the other. That’s why in this self-test you document your
range of motion on both the right and left sides of your body. If you were to discover
that your left shoulder has more range of motion than your right shoulder, you can put
a little more time into stretching your right shoulder.
 Records and tracks your increases in ﬂexibility over time: The only way to tell
how far you’ve come is to know precisely where you started. And the only way to
know how far you’ve gotten is to measure your progress regularly. Performing this 
self-test before you begin your ﬂexibility training gives you a good idea of your initial
ﬂexibility level.
Measure yourself every six weeks to see how well you’re doing. And nothing breeds
success like success. The more you ﬁnd yourself improving, the more motivated you
will be to keep up the good work!
Developing increased ﬂexibility doesn’t happen overnight. You need to set realistic goals,
and start with easy exercises before moving on to more advanced ones. Testing is for
recording progress, not for competing. No two people are alike. Some people may see
results more quickly and dramatically than others, but as long as you’re seeing improve-
ment and enjoying yourself, you have a much better chance of making stretching a lifelong
program.
The self-test takes about 20 minutes to complete, so make sure to have enough time to com-
plete the test. As you test yourself more often and get more familiar with the stretches, the
time will decrease. To get started, you need the following:
 Comfortable, loose ﬁtting clothes
 Mat or carpeted ﬂoor — you need a space large enough to lie down comfortably
 Firm chair or exercise bench
 Stretching table or your bed
 Flexibility Evaluation Worksheet (included at the end of this chapter)
 Pen or pencil
 A towel or stretching strap — for a more detailed description of what type of strap,
check out Chapter 2
31
Chapter 3: Testing Your Flexibility to Establish Your Stretching Routine

If you’re really dedicated to increasing your ﬂexibility and you have made a commitment to
stick with your stretching program, I suggest investing a few dollars and purchasing your
own stretching strap — it will be well worth the money. Until then, just use a small bath
towel or gym towel.
Putting Your Legs Where Your Head 
Is . . . Not: The Flexibility Self-Test
Performing a stretch that involves more than one muscle group makes it difﬁcult to deter-
mine which muscle is tight or which ones cause limited range of motion. For example, you
may have heard of the “sit and reach” test — where you sit on the ﬂoor with your legs
straight out in front of you, and you bend forward while someone measures with a ruler
how far you can reach toward your toes (you may have done this test in high school; it’s a
popular test on Fitness Day). Even though this test is common for ﬂexibility, I’m not a big
fan of it because it gives you very little information — it tells you if your muscles are tight or
not, but it doesn’t tell you which muscles; is it your lower back, your hamstrings, or your
calves that are tight? Who knows?
So my test is different. My stretch test isolates individual muscles to give you the most
useful information possible to design your own customized stretching program. At ﬁrst, the
following sections of stretches may seem like a lot, but unfortunately there’s no such thing
as just a few moves to determine ﬂexibility.
After you completed the self-test, you know exactly what muscles in your body need the
most attention. At that point, you can head to the chapter in this book that contains speciﬁc
stretches for the areas you want to work and then choose the exercise(s) that feels most
comfortable for your body.
Also, you may notice that most of the stretches test both the right and left sides of your
body. It’s not uncommon to have one side more ﬂexible than the other, which creates an
imbalance, but it’s important to try to get both sides of your body equal in ﬂexibility for
symmetry, balance, and injury prevention, and this test helps you achieve that goal.
Before you start, I want to give you a few pointers:
 You get better results if you warm up before you attempt these tests. You can head to
Chapter 11 for some simple warm-up exercises. I recommend doing the same warm-up
routine every time you do this stretch test — that way you get more consistent and
accurate results.
 When you retest to check your progress, make sure that you always test in similar situ-
ations: time of day, amount of warm-up, workout schedule, and so on.
 In the section “Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet,” I include a worksheet for record-
ing your performance on each of the stretches in this chapter. Each stretch isolates a
speciﬁc area.
As you perform the stretch, imagine a large clock around you with the center of the
clock pinned to the axis of the stretch. For instance, when standing up and twisting, the
clock would be on the ground, directly beneath the centerline of your body — the axis
around which you are stretching. Midnight would be looking straight ahead. If you’re
sitting on the ground leaning forward, the clock would be centered on your hip, the
axis of your stretch. Midnight would be when you’re sitting up straight.
32
Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s of Letting Loose and Snapping Back 

 Because this is only an assessment, not an attempt to increase your range of motion,
don’t hold the stretches for an extended period of time. Just get into the correct posi-
tion, inhale deeply and as you exhale make a note of your position as it corresponds to
the hands on a clock, and write in down on your worksheet.
Let the testing begin!
Neck
The chin-to-chest neck stretch gives you an idea of how tight the muscles are in your neck.
To test the muscles in this area, stretch following the steps below:
1. Sit up tall in a chair with your back straight, arms at your sides, and your shoulders
down.
Don’t round your back forward.
2. Inhale and as you exhale drop your chin down toward your chest, as shown in
Figure 3-1.
3. Make a note on your Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet at what place on the clock
face the top of your head points.
Imagine that the clock face is centered on the outside of your shoulder.
• 1:00 is tight.
• 2:00 is a healthy range of motion.
• 3:00 is very ﬂexible.

Chapter 3: Testing Your Flexibility to Establish Your Stretching Routine

Shoulders
This simple movement can tell you a lot about the range of motion in your shoulders. To do
this test stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with your back straight, your abdominals lifted, your shoulders down,
and your arms to your side.
2. Inhale and as you exhale lift your right arm straight forward, moving it as far over-
head as you can (Figure 3-2).
Remember to keep your shoulders down and don’t let your back arch. Stop moving if
you feel pain in your shoulder.
3. Make a note on your Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet at what place on the clock
face your hand points.
• 10:00 is tight.
• 12:00 is a healthy range of motion.
• 1:00 is very ﬂexible.
4. Repeat this stretch with your left arm and mark your results on the worksheet.
• 2:00 is tight.
• 12:00 is a healthy range of motion.
• 11:00 is very ﬂexible.

Chest
To test the ﬂexibility of your chest, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with your back straight, your abdominals lifted, your shoulders down,
and your arms at your sides.
2. Inhale and bring your arms straight out in front of you at chest height.
3. Exhale and open your arms to the side (palms facing forward) as far as you can
without arching your back (see Figure 3-3).
Keep your shoulder blades down and stable.
4. Make a note on your worksheet at what place on the clock your hands point.
• 10:00 and 2:00 are tight.
• 9:00 and 3:00 are a healthy range of motion.
• 8:00 and 4:00 are very ﬂexible.
Trunk
A healthy back has a balanced range of motion in four directions: forward, side, rotation,
and back. Isolating the muscles of your trunk can be difﬁcult because many muscles are
involved in the complex movement of your spine; therefore, there are four test stretches in
this section to measure the range of motion in your trunk as a whole.
Figure 3-3:

ity test for

35
Chapter 3: Testing Your Flexibility to Establish Your Stretching Routine

Seated rotation
To do this test stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit up tall in a chair with your back straight, your abdominals lifted, and your shoul-
ders down.
2. Place your left arm on the outside of your right thigh and your right hand on the
back seat of your chair.
This position helps you turn your upper body at the waist in the next step.
3. Inhale and as you exhale twist at your waist as if you were trying to look behind you.
This position is shown in Figure 3-4. Remember to keep both shoulders down and to
look out in front of you, not at the ﬂoor.
4. Make a note on the Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet at what place on the clock
your chest faces.
• 1:00 is tight.
• 2:00 is a healthy range of motion.
• 3:00 is very ﬂexible.
5. Repeat this stretch by rotating to your left side and record the results on your 
worksheet.
• 11:00 is tight.
• 10:00 is a healthy range of motion.
• 9:00 is very ﬂexible.

Standing side bend
To do this test stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your back straight, abdominals lifted, and
your shoulders down.
2. Place your right hand overhead and your left arm to your side (see Figure 3-5a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale bend to the left side, reaching the ﬁngers on your left
hand down the side of your leg (Figure 3-5b).
Try to keep your shoulders and hips facing the front, avoiding even the slightest 
rotation in the spine.
4. Make a note on the Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet at what place on the clock
face the top of your head points to.
• 1:00 is tight
• 2:00 is healthy range of motion
• 3:00 is very ﬂexible
5. Repeat this stretch on your other side (to stretch the left side).
• 11:00 is tight
• 10:00 is healthy range of motion
• 9:00 is very ﬂexible

Seated forward bend
A tight upper or lower back limits your range of motion. To do this test stretch, follow these
steps:
1. Sit on a chair with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor (see Figure 3-6a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale round forward a far as you comfortably can, bending at
your hips (Figure 3-6b).
3. Make a note on the Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet at what place on the clock
face the back of your head points to.
• 1:00 is tight.
• 2:00 is healthy range of motion.
• 3:00 is very ﬂexible.
Standing back extension
You may have tight abdominals if this stretch is difﬁcult. To do this test stretch, follow these
steps:
1. Stand up tall with your back straight, your abdominals lifted, and your shoulders
down with your arms to your sides and your feet apart.
2. Inhale and as you exhale move your shoulders back, lifting your chest and eyes
toward the ceiling without compressing your lower back.
Think of keeping your spine long. Figure 3-7 shows you how to keep from compressing
your back. You can also put your hands on your lower back for support.
3. Make a note on your worksheet at what point on the clock your head stops moving.
Between 12:00 and 11:00 is tight.
Between 11:00 and 10:00 is a healthy range of motion.
Between 10:00 and 9:00 is very ﬂexible.

Quadriceps
This stretch tests the ﬂexibility in your quadriceps (front of your thighs). Knowing where
your tightness lies allows you to focus on stretches that improve your range of motion in
this muscle group.
To stretch your quads, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall and place your left hand on a stable surface.
Your surface can be a chair, wall, doorway, or fence — anything that’s sturdy and helps
you keep your balance in the next steps.
2. Inhale and lift your right foot behind you and grab hold of your ankle or the top of
your foot with your right hand (see Figure 3-8).
3. Exhale and gently move your knee back, trying to line it up next to your left knee.
Don’t force your heel to touch your right buttocks.
4. Make a note on your Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet at what place on the clock
your knee points.
8:00 is very tight.
7:00 is tight.
6:00 is good ﬂexibility.
5. Repeat this stretch on your left side.

Chapter 3: Testing Your Flexibility to Establish Your Stretching Routine

Hamstrings
To do this test stretch, you need a towel or stretching strap. For more information about what
type of strap to use check out Chapter 2 and read the discussion on props. Then follow
these steps:
1. Lie down on the ﬂoor with your legs straight out in front of you and your arms to
your sides.
2. Bring your right foot toward your chest and wrap a strap or towel around the arch
of your foot (see Figure 3-9).
3. Inhale and as you exhale extend your right leg toward the ceiling, as shown in
Figure 3-9.
Try to keep your right leg as straight as possible and your hips on the ﬂoor. If it’s more
comfortable for you, you can bend your left leg so that your foot is on the ﬂoor but it’s
important to try to keep your right leg straight, even if it is not straight up to the ceil-
ing. Remember, you are only evaluating your ﬂexibility, so it’s okay if your leg does not
go very high. Keep working at it and stretch regularly and you’ll soon see improvement.
4. Make a note on your worksheet at what point your foot stops.
10:00 is tight.
12:00 is a healthy range of motion.
1:00 is very ﬂexible.
5. Repeat this stretch with your left leg and record those results on your worksheet, too.
Groin
Groin pulls are often related to improper stretching or tight adductors, and this test reﬂects
your ﬂexibility in your adductors (inner thigh muscles).

Part I: The Why’s, Where’s, When’s, and How’s of Letting Loose and Snapping Back 

This area is often tighter in men than in women because women usually have broader and
shallower hips, which give them a potential for greater range of motion in this area.
To do this test stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie down on the ﬂoor with your legs straight out in front of you and your arms to
your sides.
2. Inhale and as you exhale move your legs out to the side as far as you comfortably can.
Remember when you were little and you used to make snow angels? You move your
legs out like you were making an angel but without moving your arms. See Figure 3-10
for additional help.
3. Make a note on your worksheet at what place on the clock your feet point.
7:00 and 5:00 are tight.
8:00 and 4:00 are healthy range of motion.
9:00 and 3:00 are very ﬂexible.

Buttocks
To do this test stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit up tall in a chair with your back straight, your abdominals lifted, and your shoul-
ders down.
2. Place your left ankle on your right quad just above your knee and gently press your
knee toward the ﬂoor with your left hand as you bend forward at the hip and tilt
your pelvis back.
Check out Figure 3-11 if you need help visualizing this stretch. Remember to keep your
opposite hip on the seat of your chair and your back straight. Look out at the ﬂoor in
front of you, not at your feet.
3. Make a note at what place on the clock face your knee stops moving.
1:00 is tight.
2:00 is a healthy range of motion.
3:00 is very ﬂexible.
4. Repeat this stretch with your right leg.
11:00 is tight.
10:00 is a healthy range of motion.
9:00 is very ﬂexible.

Calves
Having tight calf muscles can affect not only your range of motion in your ankle but also
your walking and running strides. If your calf muscles are tight and you can’t get full range
of motion in your ankles with this test stretch, then this lack of motion may have a negative
effect on your form, in your hip, during walking and running. This imbalance may eventually
lead to chronic pain or injury to your knees, hips, or even lower back.
Pay close attention to this area if you wear high heels all day. Stretching this area can help
you keep your ankles, feet, and hips in balance.
To do this test stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your right leg straight out in front of you and your left leg bent
so the bottom of your left foot rests against the inside thigh of your right leg.
2. Wrap a towel or stretching strap around the ball of your right foot and gently pull
your foot toward you so your toes move toward your knee.
Look at Figure 3-12 if you need help. For more information about what type of strap to
use, check out Chapter 2 and read the discussion on props. Also make sure to keep your
back straight; don’t lean forward at your hip. Try to move only your ankle and foot.
3. Make a note on your Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet at what place on the clock
your toes point.
1:00 is tight.
12:00 is a healthy range of motion.
11:00 is very ﬂexible.

Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet
To test your ﬂexibility and record where you are now and your progress as you go along,
you need to perform the test stretches in this chapter. When you ﬁnish each test stretch,
record your progress in the Clock Position column in the evaluation sheet in Table 3-1.
The description column should be used to record any information you want to note about
the stretch such as level of difﬁculty or any discomforts you may feel.
Don’t forget to make several photocopies of the worksheet in Table 3-1 so you can repeat
these stretches and record your results about every six weeks. Over time you’ll see how
much you’ve improved. You’ll not only feel better, but also you’ll have proof that you’re get-
ting more ﬂexible.

N
o matter where you’re tight, you can find a stretch
that’s right for you in this part because I cover
stretches for every muscle in your body. I show you
stretches for your neck, shoulders, chest, upper back, and
arms (all parts collectively known as the upper body) in
Chapter 4. Then in Chapter 5, you get a run down on some
functional stretches that keep your core (your center) flex-
ible and strong. In Chapter 6, you stretch your lower back,
and finally in Chapter 7, you discover stretches for your
legs, hips, and buttocks that you just can’t live without!

S
tarting at the top is a good way to begin your focus for stretching the upper body
because most people (including me) hold a lot of tension in the upper body. After all,
the upper body is primarily made up of the neck, shoulders, and upper back. And what a
powerful combination!
My dance teacher used to tell me to keep my shoulders down — I loved to bring them up
around my ears whenever I got stressed. Those good old shoulders would ﬂoat upward
leaving me with one heck of a neckache and a tight, pinched feeling between my shoulder
blades. Many people have a habit of tensing their upper body when they get stressed out,
which in turn, makes the muscles in the lower body overcompensate and work harder than
they really need to (leading to a backache!). And that’s why this chapter is so important.
In this chapter I break down the muscles of the upper body into sections: neck, shoulders,
upper back, chest, and arms. Each section gives you a few stretches that target that speciﬁc
area. Pick the stretch that feels best on your body. As you get more ﬂexible and comfortable
with stretching, try some of the other stretches for variety to keep your program interesting
and, dare I say, fun?
Before You Move, Contemplate 
Upper Body Anatomy
I always ﬁnd it useful to know exactly what muscle I’m working so I can really focus on that
area. To get the most out of your stretches, ﬁrst locate the muscle that you’re stretching by
taking a look at the anatomy drawing in Figure 4-1. This picture gives you a visual reference
of where the muscle is located and where it attaches so you can stretch it more effectively.
Having this visual helps you achieve a mind/body connection. By this, I mean that your
mind is aware of what your body is doing. When you perform a stretch, picture the muscle
from the drawing in your mind and feel it in your body.

What a Pain in the Neck! Stretches 
to Keep Your Head Held High
For most people, the neck is a lightning rod for stress. Trafﬁc, job issues, cranky children —
it’s amazing that the tension created by frustrations such as these are stored in that tiny
little area above your shoulders and below your head. The movement of the head and neck
is very complex and involves many muscles working together. To keep it simple, focus on
four of those muscles: Upper trapezius (truh-pee-zee-uhs), sternocleidomastoid (stur-noh-
klahy-duh-mas-toid), scalenes (skey-leens), and levator scapula (li-vey-ter skap-yuh-luh).
These are the muscles that, when not taken care of, literally become a pain in the neck.
Regularly stretching the muscles of your neck can reduce pain and tightness that if left
unchecked can lead to headaches, chronic stiffness, limited range of motion, and even
carpal tunnel syndrome. The stretches in this section may even prevent pain altogether.
Lateral head tilt
The lateral head tilt stretches the muscles that run along the sides of your neck: anterior,
middle, and posterior scalenes. These muscles attach to the upper rib cage, so to get an
effective stretch, you have to anchor your shoulder blades down as you tilt your head to
the side.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
Sternocleidomastoid
Pectoralis
major
Bicep
Pectoralis minor
(beneath pectoralis
major)
Flexor
muscles
of the
wrist
Note: Sternocleidomastoid muscle has 2 parts as indicated.
Deltoid

1. Inhale as you lift your shoulders up to your ears with your arms straight down at
your sides.
2. Exhale and lower your shoulders and anchor your shoulder blades in place to pro-
vide a ﬁrm foundation for the stretch.
3. Tilt your head to the left side, moving your left ear toward your left shoulder (see
Figure 4-2), being very careful not to lift your right shoulder.
Imagine that you’re holding a very heavy book in your hand as you tilt your head to the
opposite side. This thought may help you keep your right shoulder down and allow
you to feel the stretch more.
4. Hold the stretch for two or three deep breaths and then lift your head back to
center.
5. Inhale as you lift your shoulders again; exhale as you lower your shoulders.
6. Repeat the stretch on the right side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do be aware of your muscles in your upper back holding your shoulder down.
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do sit or stand up tall as you hold the stretch.
 Don’t tilt from your waist.
 Don’t let your opposite shoulder lift as you tilt your head.

Neck rotation with tilt
Doing this stretch can be effective for immediate pain control and also, if done consistently,
can actually help prevent pain in the future because it targets the trapezius — the main cul-
prit in stress headaches!
This stretch can be done sitting or standing, but just remember that to effectively stretch
this area you must anchor your shoulder blades or keep them still to provide a solid founda-
tion for the stretch.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Find a stable, ﬂat chair that you can sit comfortably in and position yourself in an
upright, military-type posture.
2. Slowly rotate your head to the right approximately 45 degrees and slowly lean for-
ward and drop your head slightly (see Figure 4-3).
You should begin to feel tension build lightly over the right shoulder and neck.
3. Hold this position, maintaining the light to medium stretch for at least one full
minute.
4. Repeat on the other side by simply reversing the above instructions.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do hold your shoulders down while you tilt your head to the side.
 Do sit up or stand up tall as you hold the stretch.
 Don’t let your shoulders round forward as you drop your head.
 Don’t yank or force the stretch.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

Neck rotation
The primary muscle that turns your head side to side is your sternocleidomastoid. No, you
don’t have to know how to spell it, but take a look at Figure 4-1 to see where it’s located. It’s
important to keep ﬂexibility in this area because many of the movements in life require you
to turn your head. Every time you look over your shoulder, you use this muscle.
Perform the following steps for this exercise:
1. Inhale and make sure that your shoulders are down, chest is lifted, and abdominals
are in.
2. As you exhale, slowly turn your head to the right (see Figure 4-4).
3. Find a focal point to stare at and hold this position for ﬁve seconds.
4. Inhale and release back to center.
5. As you exhale, turn your head again in the same direction and ﬁnd another focal
point a little farther than the ﬁrst.
6. Hold this stretch for ﬁve seconds and release back to center.
7. Repeat the series, looking in the other direction.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do anchor your shoulders so they face forward. You don’t want your shoulders to
move as you turn your head.
 Do sit up or stand up tall as you hold the stretch.
 Don’t yank or force the stretch or you’ll do more harm than good; because these muscles
work so hard all day holding your head up, they’re delicately balanced and easily injured.

The Hot Seat for Tension: Getting 
Your Shoulders to Chill Out
The main focus when stretching the shoulder is the deltoid muscle — the muscle that runs
over the outside of your shoulder. When you think about the deltoid, remember that it’s
really three muscles in one: front, middle, and back (refer to Figure 4-1). So to truly stretch
your shoulder, you need to stretch all three parts of the deltoid. (Don’t worry; I show you
how in the following sections.)
In addition to the deltoid muscle, a collection of small but extremely important muscles and
tendons deep within the shoulder joint is called the rotator cuff. Because a strong and ﬂexi-
ble rotator cuff is essential for an effective throwing motion, keeping this area in tiptop
shape is the key point for baseball pitchers. Check out the following stretches to help you
keep alive your dream of having a major league pitching career (or perhaps just to play
catch with your grandkids without pain).

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 
Relieving headaches
Statistics show that over 90 percent of people have a
headache at some time in their life, which, amazingly,
means that a lucky 10 percent of people never have a
headache. But a headache can happen at any time, any-
where, and can deﬁnitely ruin your day. And even though
headaches are common, most people don’t have any
idea where a headache comes from.
Tension headaches are by far the most common form of
headaches and can be due to stress, which causes you to
clench or strain the muscles of your face, neck, jaw, and/or
shoulders. When these muscles are tight they can compress
the nerves that lead to your scalp, causing a tight, squeez-
ing sensation in your head. Fatigue, lack of sleep, or even
sleep disorders can also result in this type of headache.
Posture also plays a key role in many tension head-
aches. Many of the positions we habitually put ourselves
in tighten neck and back muscles. Try to avoid constantly
tilting your head to one side (a problem for frequent
phone users). Be aware of your posture as you sit at your
desk, drive your car, stand in line at the grocery store, or
carry a bag or purse.
Migraines are generally less common headaches but
more severe. Although stress can be a major trigger for
migraine headache, migraines and cluster headaches
are regarded as primarily vascular in nature, and not
necessarily the result of muscle tightness. What triggers
a migraine headache in one person may have no effect
in someone else, including hormone ﬂuctuations, smok-
ing, chocolate, and even the weather.
When it comes to relieving the pain of occasional tension
headaches, thousands of people turn to over-the-counter
drugs such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen, which
can be very effective. In addition, some proven-effective
natural remedies include
 Ice packs
 A warm shower or bath
 Massaging the neck and shoulders
 Aerobic exercise (to promote the release of endor-
phins and relax tight muscles)
 Eating regularly
 Sex
 A glass of wine
Treatment for recurrent tension headaches, however, is
another story. A frequently throbbing head is your body’s
way of telling you that something signiﬁcant is out of bal-
ance in your life. Stress is an unavoidable part of modern
life, but by far the best course of action to combat stress-
related tension headaches is prevention. Although such
natural remedies as a visit to a chiropractor, acupressure,
acupuncture, and even hypnosis can help with recurring
tension headaches, several well-regarded studies have
concluded that stress management skills and relaxation
training can reduce chronic headache for 50 to 70 percent
of patients. Techniques such as deep breathing, medita-
tion, and most important of all, stretching, can trigger the
relaxation response, which can lower blood pressure,
reduce pulse rates, and release muscle tension. Regular
stretching keeps you calm and ﬂexible, and it can help
reduce headache frequency and intensity.

Middle of shoulder stretch
If you want to know what your deltoid muscle does, just lift your arm in any direction. Try
moving your arm forward or back, overhead, in a circular motion, or just straight up and
down. None of these movements is possible without your deltoid doing most of the work.
Because your deltoids are so active and used in almost every movement that involves your
arms, they’re contracted constantly throughout your day. This constant tension creates
tightness in your shoulders, which is all the more reason to stretch this area daily.
The following stretch is speciﬁcally for the middle part of your deltoid. This stretch can be
done sitting, standing, or lying down. Just make sure to maintain good posture so you feel
the full effectiveness of the stretch.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit up straight with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and your abdominals lifted.
2. Lift your right arm across your chest and hook the left arm under your right arm
(see Figure 4-5a).
If your shoulders are extremely stiff or tight and you ﬁnd it difﬁcult to hook your arm
underneath your other arm, try the stretch lying on your back. Just drape your arm
across your body and let gravity do the work. You may ﬁnd it more comfortable.
3. Now, gently lower your right shoulder so it’s even with your left shoulder (see
Figure 4-5b).
4. Inhale and as you exhale use your left arm to gently pull your right arm across
your body.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
6. Repeat the stretch with the left arm.

Chapter 4: Taking It from the Top: Upper Body Stretches

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do progress through the stretch gradually.
 Do sit up or stand up tall as you hold the stretch.
 Don’t let your shoulder lift or kink your neck.
 Don’t pull too forcefully.
Back of shoulder stretch
This stretch is speciﬁcally for the back part of your deltoid and can be performed either sit-
ting or standing. Just remember to keep your core stable and supported.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit or stand up straight with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and contract your abdominals.
2. Place your right arm straight out in front of you so it’s level with your chest.
3. Bend your elbow so your hand moves upward and is level with your chin.
4. Bring your left arm under your right and intertwine your forearms with your palms
facing out (see Figure 4-6a).
Don’t worry if you can’t get your arms completely intertwined. Just cross your arms at
your elbows and lift. As you get more ﬂexible, you may notice a greater range of motion.
5. Inhale and as you exhale, lift both elbows about an inch (see Figure 4-6b).
6. Hold for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
7. Repeat this stretch with your right arm under your left.

Don’t worry if you can’t get your arms completely intertwined. Just cross your arms at your
elbows and lift. As you get more ﬂexible, you may notice a greater range of motion.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do progress through the stretch gradually.
 Do sit up tall as you hold the stretch.
 Don’t let your shoulder lift and don’t kink your neck.
Shoulder rotation stretch
You’ll feel this stretch all around your shoulders because it targets the smaller, deeper muscles
known as your rotator cuff and the front part of your deltoid known as the anterior deltoid. You
need a stretching strap (see Chapter 2 for more details about straps) or towel for this stretch.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up very tall with your feet about hip-width apart.
2. Grab each end of your towel or strap with your palms down and resting in front of
your thighs (see Figure 4-7a).
3. Straighten your arms and inhale as you raise your arms overhead (see Figure 4-7b).
4. Exhale and take your arms farther behind your head without arching your back.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or for four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.

Chapter 4: Taking It from the Top: Upper Body Stretches

If you’re having trouble keeping your back straight, check out the lying arm circles stretch
from Chapter 8. That exercise may help remind your body of how to keep your core stable
as you move your shoulders.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your arms symmetrical as you hold the stretch.
 Do progress through the stretch gradually and slowly.
 Do stand up tall as you hold the stretch.
 Don’t twist to either side.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.
Stretches for Carrying Someone on Your Lats
The main muscles in your upper back are the latissimus dorsi (pronounced luh-tis-uh-muhs
dawr-sahy and commonly known as the lats, trapezius, or traps) and the rhomboids, which
unfortunately don’t have a catchy nickname. These muscles play an important role in stabi-
lizing your spine, moving your arms, and maintaining good posture. The following upper
back stretches involve all these muscles on both sides of the body.
Lat stretch on all fours
This position is a great stretch for your latissimus dorsi — the largest muscle in your back.
Even though this muscle is located on your back, it attaches to your arm; therefore, you
need to reach with your arms to fully stretch this muscle. Also, your lats attach to your
lower back, so tightness in this muscle can create pain and imbalance in your lower back.
As you reach in this stretch, you feel your muscles stretch on each side of your back.
When doing this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Begin with your knees and your hands on the ﬂoor (you may want to use an exer-
cise mat to cushion your hands and knees).
2. Exhale and reach your arms straight forward and lower your chest toward the ﬂoor,
keeping your hips higher than your shoulders (see Figure 4-8a).
3. Inhale, exhale, and move your shoulders and arms toward the right as far as you
can reach and still keep your hips anchored to the ground (see Figure 4-8b).
4. Hold for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths and then move back to center
position.
5. Repeat the same stretch but reach to the left instead.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do feel a slight arch in your back.
 Do press your chest toward the ﬂoor and keep your hips high.
 Do progress through the stretch gradually and slowly.
56
Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

 Don’t round your back.
 Don’t move your hips.
Supported upper back stretch
What I like about the supported upper back stretch is that you don’t have to get down on
the ﬂoor to do it. It’s easy to do at the gym, at home, or outdoors. Just ﬁnd a sturdy support
that is about hip height. Be creative — if you’re outdoors, use the back of a park bench or
even a tree. If you’re at the gym, you probably can ﬁnd a ballet barre, a ledge, or a railing.
And if you’re at home, use the kitchen counter or table.

Chapter 4: Taking It from the Top: Upper Body Stretches
Modify the supported upper back stretch
Try out the following tips to modify the supported upper
back stretch (shown in Figure 4-9):
 If you have tight hamstrings and feel pain in the back
of your thighs, bend your knees slightly during the
stretch. This adaptation helps relieve the tension in
the back of your thighs so you can focus on stretch-
ing your upper back. After you ﬁnish this stretch you
may want to read Chapter 7, where I give you many
stretches for your unhappy hamstrings.
To make this a more warm-up type stretch, try doing
this stretch in a more rhythmic movement of slightly
arching and rounding your back, moving with each
breath.
 As you hold the stretch, try dropping one shoulder a
little lower than the other. This version can help
deepen the stretch on the side of your back with the
lowered shoulder.

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet about hip-width apart and place your hands on a sturdy surface
for support.
2. Move your feet back far enough so you can extend your arms as you move your
chest toward the ﬂoor (see Figure 4-9).
3. Exhale and get a deep stretch by pressing your chest toward the ﬂoor and your hips
toward the ceiling so you have a slight arch in your back.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your neck in line with the rest of your spine.
 Do use your breath to relax into the stretch.
 Don’t drop your chin to your chest.
 Don’t round your spine.
Seated upper back stretch
This stretch targets the smaller muscles in your upper back — speciﬁcally the rhomboids —
and you should feel this stretch between your shoulder blades. It’s important to keep this
muscle group strong and ﬂexible because the rhomboids play an important role in good
posture.
Figure 4-9:
Supported

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

Ironically, for many people, their rhomboids are weak and overstretched. If you ﬁnd that
your shoulders roll forward when you stand or sit, you probably need to focus on strength-
ening these upper back muscles. To ﬁnd out more about strengthening this area, consult a
private trainer or a book on weight training such as Weight Training For Dummies, 3rd
Edition, by Shirley Archer (Wiley).
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your knees slightly bent and your arms crossed behind your
knees (see Figure 4-10a).
2. Inhale as you lean forward, letting your chest rest on your thighs.
3. As you exhale, round your back and pull away from your knees, but be sure that
your arms are locked under your knees (see Figure 4-10b).
4. Hold this position for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do feel your shoulder blades move away from each other.
 Do tilt your pelvis under.
 Don’t tense up your shoulders.
 Don’t hold your breath.
Both Sexes, Take Care! The 
Kneeling Chest Stretch
The ofﬁcial names for the muscles of your chest are pectoralis major and pectoralis minor —
more commonly known as the pecs (pectoralis is pronounced pek-tuh-ral-is). Whether you
exercise regularly or you’re a perfect couch potato, if you don’t stretch these muscles regu-
larly, they can tighten and shorten, which cause your shoulders to round forward.
Most people already have weak upper back muscles, and this constant pulling from tight
pecs weakens your back muscles even further, creating even more of an imbalance between
your chest and upper back muscles. The end result is rounded shoulders and poor posture
(and your mother shouting at you to stop slouching!).

Chapter 4: Taking It from the Top: Upper Body Stretches

The following stretch is designed to help increase the range of motion in your shoulders by
lengthening and stretching the pectoralis major. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Kneel on a carpeted ﬂoor or mat with your forearms crossed and resting on the seat
of a sturdy chair (see Figure 4-11a).
2. Breathe in and as you exhale let your head and chest sink below the chair seat (see
Figure 4-11b).
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and feel your shoulders and upper chest stretch,
while you use deep breathing to help you sink gradually deeper into the stretch.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do start the stretch in the comfort zone and gradually progress into a deep stretch.
 Do avoid arching or rounding your back.
 Don’t allow your pelvis to tilt back or tuck under.
Making Wiggly Muscles Firm: Stretches 
for the Dreaded Upper Arm
If you’re a woman of a certain age, you may have been led to believe that, like death and
taxes, ﬂabby upper arms are inevitable at some point. Well, I’m here to tell you that doesn’t
have to be the case. Upper arm development and deﬁnition are a big goal for both men and
women. Men love to show off their “guns” and women are constantly looking for the solu-
tion for their ﬂabby upper arms. With the focus on toning this area, remember it’s just as
important to stretch and lengthen these muscles too. By lengthening the muscles on the
front and back of the upper arm, stretching can aid in bringing ﬁrmness and deﬁnition to
this area by allowing the muscles to respond more effectively to toning exercises.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

Biceps and triceps are the two main muscles of your upper arm. The biceps (your “guns”)
are in the front of your upper arm. Contracting your biceps muscles bends your elbow.
Your triceps are smaller and a little better hidden in the back of your upper arm. Contracting
your triceps straightens your elbow. With that in mind, to stretch your biceps you need to
straighten your elbow and to stretch your triceps you need to bend your elbow.
Back of the arms stretch
It’s no secret that doing push-ups will work the muscles of your chest. But did you know
that when you do a push-up it also works your triceps? That’s because your triceps help
your chest muscles when you push something away.
This traditional stretch for the back of your upper arm can be done sitting or standing.
Another good triceps stretch is patting yourself on the back when you’re ﬁnished!
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Raise one arm overhead and bend your arm at the elbow so your ﬁngers are reach-
ing down your spine and your elbow is pointing upward.
2. Place your other hand on your raised elbow and as you exhale gently press your
elbow back so your ﬁngers reach farther down your spine (see Figure 4-12).
If reaching overhead is awkward or uncomfortable, try the stretch with your raised
elbow against a wall, and use the wall to apply the pressure to your elbow.
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
4. Repeat this stretch with your other arm.
Figure 4-12:
Back of
the arms

61
Chapter 4: Taking It from the Top: Upper Body Stretches

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your eyes looking forward.
 Do keep your back straight and deepen the stretch by moving your elbow back, not by
moving your rib cage forward.
 Do try to walk your ﬁnger tips farther down your back.
 Don’t arch your back.
 Don’t force or bounce the stretch.
Triceps stretch with towel or strap
When you’re doing the triceps stretch, remember to maintain good posture throughout the
exercise. You may sit or stand during this stretch, and you need a towel, so go grab one
now. Using the towel helps people who are very tight in the shoulders because the towel
allows you to focus on your triceps without feeling discomfort in your shoulders.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Place your towel or strap in your left hand and lift it over your shoulder.
2. With your right hand, reach behind your back and grab the other end of the towel
(see Figure 4-13).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, gently pull down on the towel with your right hand.
4. With each exhale try to increase the stretch by pulling down on the towel a little
more with your right hand.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
6. Repeat this stretch with your right arm.
You can get a stretch in your shoulder at the same time if you walk your lower hand up the
towel as you gently pull down on the towel, as if you were trying to get your two hands to
touch.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your back straight and your abdominals in.
 Do relax as you hold the stretch.
 Do keep your eyes forward and your shoulder blades down.
 Don’t hold your breath.
 Don’t bounce the stretch or yank on the towel too forcefully.
 Don’t tuck your chin down to your chest.
Standing biceps stretch
This upper arm stretch is great for your biceps because you don’t need props. No need to
wait until after your workout to perform this stretch. Try doing it right after you complete
your biceps curls during your upper body workout.
62
Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms extended to the
side, palms facing forward — about shoulder height (see Figure 4-14a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale rotate your thumbs downward and back (see Figure 4-14b).
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and release.

 Do stay relaxed.
 Do keep your shoulders down and chest lifted.
 Do look forward through the entire stretch.
 Don’t let your shoulders round.
 Don’t drop your head forward.

People who work with their hands (including people who work on a computer a lot) know
all about the danger of strain or overuse. Many ofﬁce workers, in fact, suffer from chronic
hand pain and can even have carpal tunnel syndrome, which is a painful condition that
occurs when a key nerve that runs from your forearm to your hand gets squeezed or
pinched.
The repetitive motion of racquet sports can also create tension in the wrists and forearms.
Taking a few minutes a day to stretch your wrists may be just what you need to prevent
future chronic pain in your hands and wrists. The following stretches can be done any time
and any place, and especially at work whenever you feel you need a break.
Wrist stretch on hands and knees
Keeping the muscles of the wrists and forearms ﬂexible is extremely important in the preven-
tion of repetitive motion injuries such as tennis elbow or carpal tunnel syndrome. If these
areas are tight, the muscles and tendons can be forced beyond their natural range of move-
ment. If you have or think you may have carpal tunnel syndrome, you may want to skip this
stretch.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Kneel on all fours with most of your weight on your knees.
2. Turn the wrist of your left hand so your ﬁngers point toward your knees and your
palm is toward the ﬂoor (see Figure 4-15a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale gently lower the palm of your hand to the ﬂoor as you shift
your hips toward your heels.
You should feel the stretch in the palm of your hand and forearm.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
5. Release the stretch and lift your left hand off the ﬂoor and turn your wrist so the
back of your hand is now on the ﬂoor with your ﬁngers toward your knees (see
Figure 4-15b).
6. Inhale and as you exhale gently move your wrist toward the ﬂoor and your hips
toward your heels.

7. Hold for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
8. Repeat these two stretches on your other wrist.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulder blades down and your body weight shifting toward your heels.
 Don’t put all your weight on the wrist that you’re stretching.
 Don’t bounce in the stretch.
Standing open-arm wrist stretch
You’ll feel this stretch in your forearms, wrists, and the palms of your hands. It is very
subtle, so you need to focus to really feel the stretch. Also, keep in mind that you can do
this stretch standing or sitting, whichever is more comfortable for you. Just remember that
if you round your shoulders forward, you probably won’t feel the full effect of the stretch —
so keep those shoulders back.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your back straight and your chest lifted.
2. Extend your arms to the side — no higher than shoulder height — with palms facing
forward (see Figure 4-16a).
3. Open your hands as wide as you can with your ﬁngers reaching long and apart.
4. Bend your wrists toward the back wall, and then move your arms back an inch or
two (see Figure 4-16b).
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.

Keep reminding yourself to keep your hands wide open; otherwise, your hands start to relax
and the stretch isn’t as effective.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulder blades down.
 Do keep your arms extended.
 Don’t bend your elbows.
 Don’t slouch.

Chapter 5
Centering on the Core: 
Stretches for Your Middle
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with the muscles of your core
 Discovering what core muscles do
 Creating some functional stretches for your core
 Discovering the best static and dynamic stretches for your core
Your core is made up of the muscles of your back, abs, hips, and even your chest
(see Figure 5-1). Because these core muscles all work together to support your
spine, they’re the foundation of all movement in your body for not only sports but also
for daily life. Whether you play tennis or just reach for something on the top shelf in
your kitchen, the movement actually begins with your core muscles, not with your arms.
All your muscles are connected to each other, so it seems logical that they have an 
effect on each other. In other words, being tight in one area or muscle can limit your 
movement and cause you to overcompensate with other muscles. (Remember that 
old song: “Your foot bone’s connected to your ankle bone; your ankle bone’s connected to
your shin bone . . . “? That’s the principle here.) This whole process can be the start of
improper movement patterns, which may lead to injuries and painful complications.
It’s because of this threat of injury that core training has become so popular. But it’s not
enough just to strengthen these muscles; you need to lengthen them as well to maintain a
healthy range of motion.
All the stretches in this chapter are what I call integrated stretches, meaning you stretch 
several muscles at the same time. The ﬁrst series of stretches are functional stretches,
which mimic normal activities. These exercises are also known as dynamic, active stretches
(discussed in more detail in Chapter 1). The second series of stretches are called static
stretches and target the abdominals, back, and waist to help improve range of motion.
The combination of these stretches helps create a strong and ﬂexible core.

Active Stretches as Part of the Day-to-Day
Functional stretches mimic life. Reaching, twisting, and bending are everyday movements,
which require many muscles to work together at the same time. These stretches are called
active, dynamic stretches in which you move through the stretch and do several repetitions,
but you don’t necessarily have to hold the stretch for the full 30 seconds.
A great additional beneﬁt of these functional core stretches is that you actually strengthen
your muscles as you stretch and lengthen them. A ﬁtness daily double!
Step back with overhead reach
This abdominal stretch is for the muscles that run along the front of your torso. Feel this
stretch in your hip ﬂexor, abdominals, and chest. A couple of important points to focus on
during this stretch include the following:
 To really feel a deeper stretch in your hip ﬂexor, tuck your pelvis under as you
step back.
 Think of your spine as lengthening, not shortening, so the focus is on the front of your
torso and not your lower back.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your feet together, your abdominals and chest lifted, your shoulders
back, and your shoulder blades down (see Figure 5-2a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, lunge back with your left leg and reach your left arm over
your head (see Figure 5-2b).
3. Hold this position for three deep breaths.
4. Inhale and bring your foot and arm back to starting position.

5. Repeat this exercise with your right leg and arm.
6. Repeat this stretch for six to eight repetitions, alternating sides (as in Step 5).
When you feel you’re ready to add a repetition or two, try doing two sets of six to eight
repetitions.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your spine long, even as you reach up and back down.
 Do keep the motion slow and ﬂuid and use your abdominals to slow that 
motion down.
 Do use your upper back muscles to keep your shoulder blade down as you reach 
overhead.
 Don’t compress your lower back as you reach up.
 Don’t twist or reach to the side.
Alternating side reach with hip stretch
This reach-and-stretch exercise is for the muscles that run along the outside of your hip,
and the movements help your abdominals and your back. This stretch is a great daily
stretch to keep you sitting tall and exercise good posture.

Chapter 5: Centering on the Core: Stretches for Your Middle

Perform this stretch by following the steps below:
1. Stand up tall with your feet together, your abdominals and chest lifted, your shoul-
ders back, and your shoulder blades down (see Figure 5-3a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, step out to the side with your right leg (side lunge), reach-
ing your right arm overhead in the opposite direction (see Figure 5-3b).
The farther out you step to the side, the more you feel a stretch in your inner
thigh, too.
3. Hold the stretch for one deep breath.
4. Inhale and bring your body back to the starting position.
5. Repeat the steps on the left side.
6. Repeat this stretch for six to eight repetitions, alternating sides (as in Step 5).
When you feel you’re ready to add a repetition or two, try doing two sets of six to eight
repetitions.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your stationary leg straight so you feel the stretch in your inner thigh.
 Don’t twist or rotate your hips.
 Don’t bend forward as you lunge to the side.

The chop
The chop, so named because of its similar move as in chopping wood, is the king of all func-
tional stretches because it stretches your buttocks, back, abs, and chest all at the same
time. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with your feet hip-width apart and your arms at your sides.
2. Bend your knees and pivot on your left big toe as you lift your left heel.
Your right foot remains on the ground and should be facing forward (see Figure 5-4a).
3. Twist your hips to the right and reach both of your arms down and behind you.
4. Hold the position for one deep breath.
5. Come back to center and continue to turn your hips as you reach both arms over-
head to the left (see Figure 5-4b).
6. Hold this position for one deep breath.
You should feel the stretch in your right hip ﬂexor, obliques, and chest.
7. Repeat the stretch from right to left for six to eight repetitions and then work your
way up to two sets of eight repetitions as you feel more comfortable.
To protect your back and spine, your hips should move with you and not remain forward
throughout the moves.

Chapter 5: Centering on the Core: Stretches for Your Middle

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do inhale as you reach up and exhale as you bring your arms back down.
 Do lengthen your spine throughout the movement.
 Do hold your abdominals tight to protect your back.
 Don’t arch or compress your lower back.
 Don’t let your knees bow in or collapse inward.
 Don’t swing or create too much momentum; keep the movement ﬂuid and under control.
Static Stretches for Your Core
The next three exercises are static stretches that help increase your range of motion
throughout your core. Stretching the abdominals protects the back and prevents injury
and vice versa.
With static stretches for your core (and for any other stretch for that matter), take the time
to slow down and focus on holding the stretch because it strengthens the muscles you’re
working.
Pilates is a great example of static stretching because it involves holding a series of move-
ments as you slow down and focus your breathing on each exercise. Check out Pilates For
Dummies by Ellie Herman (Wiley) for some great workouts with static stretches.
Back extension (for your abdominals — go figure)
You see people every day who walk through life with rounded backs. You may even have
this issue yourself. The back extension stretch is here to help you! This stretch is techni-
cally for the abdominals, but it’s also great for the back muscles because it moves your
spine in the opposite direction, giving the muscles a workout and increasing the mobility of
your spine.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your belly and prop yourself up with your elbows.
Your elbows should be directly under your shoulders. Make sure that you lift yourself
up out of your shoulders so that you aren’t sinking into your shoulder blades.
2. Inhale and as you exhale, lengthen your spine and lift your chest as if you were
going to move forward (see Figure 5-5).
While performing this stretch, imagine that you’re trying to move forward but your
elbows and hips are glued to the ﬂoor and the space between each vertebra is increas-
ing, lengthening your spine.
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
You should feel this stretch in your abdominals.
4. Repeat the stretch for six to eight repetitions or whatever feels most comfortable
to you.
72
Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your neck long and in line with the rest of your spine.
 Do pull your belly in toward your spine.
 Don’t compress your lower back.
 Don’t lift your chest toward the ceiling; think of your chest moving forward and up.
Lying spinal rotation
The lying spinal rotation is a good stretch to do when you want to stretch several muscles
at once. In this stretch, you feel your back, oblique, neck, and chest muscles all stretch at
the same time.
This stretch may be a bit uncomfortable at ﬁrst, so always begin the stretch in your comfort
zone for the ﬁrst 10 to 15 seconds of the stretch, and then gradually increase the resistance
of the stretch for the remainder. Never stretch beyond your pain threshold. Beginning slowly
gives your muscles a chance to release and loosen up before you try to deepen the stretch.
If at any time during this stretch you feel stress and tightness in your back instead of relax-
ation and lengthening, try keeping both knees bent or placing a block or folded towel under
your knee.
This stretch involves the following steps:
1. Lie on your back with both legs extended and both arms extended out from your
sides.
2. Inhale and raise your left knee to your chest; slowly cross your knee over your body
to the right (see Figure 5-6). 
3. Turn your head to the left or opposite direction as you relax into the stretch.
Make sure to keep both arms and shoulder blades on the ﬂoor during this stretch. 
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds; release the stretch, and repeat on the other side.
This stretch can also stretch your neck, so to do this, look toward your extended arm as
you hold the stretch.

Chapter 5: Centering on the Core: Stretches for Your Middle

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe regularly as you hold the stretch.
 Do progress through the stretch gradually.
 Don’t arch your back.
 Don’t force your knee to the ﬂoor; it’s better to keep your shoulder blades on the ﬂoor
than to get your knee to touch the ﬂoor.
Spinal rotation for back and buttocks
A traditional stretch exists to stretch your buttocks, but by adding a spinal rotation to this
buttocks stretch, you can stretch your back and buttocks at the same time. The two-in-one
stretch can save you time and stretch your muscles more functionally.
A normal function of your daily routine — like bending down and reaching across to pick
something up — requires the muscles of your hip to stretch at the same time as the lats on
the other side of your back. Stretching this area keeps you ﬂexible.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with your right foot and right shoulder next to a chair, wall, fence, or
other supportive surface for balance.
2. Lift your left foot and place your left ankle on the top of your right thigh.
3. Inhale and as you exhale, bend your right knee and hinge or bend forward at your
hips slightly so your hips move backward, similar to a squat (see Figure 5-7a for an
example).
4. To deepen the stretch, grab hold of the chair or other supportive surface with both
hands (see Figure 5-7b).
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
6. Repeat the steps on the other side.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe regularly throughout the stretch.
 Do tilt your pelvis back to feel a deeper stretch in your buttocks.
 Don’t let your knee jut forward; it should stay directly above your ankle. Feel your
weight mostly in your heel, not in your toes or the ball of your foot.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.

Soothing Your Lower Back 
without Paying for a Massage
In This Chapter
 Discovering the basic anatomy of the lower back
 Focusing on preventing lower back pain
 Practicing stretches for a healthy lower back
 Releasing tension in your lower back
A
ccording to U.S.News & World Report, four out of ﬁve adults experience signiﬁcant low
back pain at some point in their lives. In addition, back pain is the second most fre-
quent problem that people see their doctor about. For most people under the age of 60,
backaches are primarily the result of tight muscles, which create pain that’s sudden and
short lived — so the good news is that, in most cases, the pain resolves quickly and without
intensive therapy or surgery.
However, lower back pain can be a sign of a serious medical condition, so if you have
chronic pain in your back, or have currently been experiencing pain in your back for more
than three consecutive days, see a doctor before engaging in any of the stretches in this
chapter.
In this chapter, I include a routine you can do when you feel general tightness in your lower
back, plus I show you some great stretches to do when your back is healthy and you want
to keep it that way.
Traveling Around the Lower Back
The ﬁve vertebrae that make up the lower back region are called the lumbar vertebrae, and
they carry the weight of your entire upper body, as well as turn, twist, and bend. Beneath
the lumbar vertebrae are nine fused vertebrae that together make up the sacrum (the rear
wall of the pelvis) and the end of the spine, or the coccyx. But these vertebra don’t stand up
straight all by themselves.
The spine is stabilized primarily by a large muscle group that runs on either side of the spine,
known as the erector spinae (shown in Figure 6-1), and by your abdominals. Because no
other muscles in your body are capable of such a wide range of movements while support-
ing such a large weight, they’re uniquely susceptible to tension and strain.
The function of all these structures is to maintain good posture (see Figure 6-1). However, as
a result of improper movement, muscular imbalance, poor alignment, and/or injury, over
time the structures that help maintain ﬂuid movement in your back, such as the interverte-
bral discs (the soft cartilage between the vertebrae) can begin to be compromised. Because

ﬂexibility training can help keep your muscles well balanced and your skeleton properly
aligned, stretching is a crucial component of a lifelong commitment to a pain-free and
healthy back.
An Ounce of Prevention Is Worth 
a Pound of Pain-Free Mobility
I divide the stretches for your lower back into two sections:
 The ﬁrst includes general stretches to help improve the range of motion and ﬂexibility
in your lower back, which can prevent pain and injury to this high-stress area.
 The second section is designed for anyone currently experiencing pain in your lower
back. These gentle stretches focus on not only the low back muscles but also sur-
rounding muscles that may be tight and causing low back pain. If you already have the
green light from your healthcare professional to try stretching, skip the ﬁrst section
and go directly to the second one.
Seated forward bend
You should feel this stretch along the length of your entire back — speciﬁcally the erector
spinae. You may hold tension in your upper back and some in your lower back, and because
this stretch involves the entire back, it can really help you ﬁnd where you hold tension in
your back. For example, if you ﬁnd that your upper back is tense, that means you hold ten-
sion primarily in your rhomboid and trapezious muscles. If your lower back is tense, it’s
probably your erector spinae that’s tight. Either way, this stretch not only helps you increase
flexibility in your back, but also it can provide a long-term prescription for back health.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on a chair with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and your abdominal muscles pulled in.
To help you ﬁnd and control your abdominals, imagine a string attached to your 
bellybutton. The string pulls back so your bellybutton moves toward your spine.
Keep that string tight and your bellybutton pulled in throughout the entire exercise
(see Figure 6-2a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, bend forward at the hips as far as you can comfortably
stretch, letting your arms hang down toward the ground (see Figure 6-2b).
3. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
4. Place your hands on your thighs and slowly roll up one vertebra at a time until you
come back to a sitting position.
To feel a little more stretch in your lats and the middle of your back, after you perform
Steps 1 and 2, try to twist your spine slightly so both arms move toward the outside of
your right leg. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then repeat on your left side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do start the motion from your hips, not from your back.
 Do start the stretch in your comfort zone, gradually stretching farther with each
breath.
 Don’t move or wiggle your legs or knees — your lower body should remain still.
 Don’t hold tension in your shoulders.

Chapter 6: Soothing Your Lower Back without Paying for a Massage

Standing forward bend
This stretch feels great if your back is tired, especially if you’ve been standing for a long
time. When you stand for an extended period of time, the muscles of your back and ham-
strings (the back of your thighs) tend to tighten up, creating stiffness and tension in the
muscles. The ﬁrst phase of this stretch targets the muscles of your back, speciﬁcally your
erector spinae, and the second phase targets your back and hamstrings.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Begin standing with your feet about hip-width apart and your toes facing forward.
2. Exhale and bend forward from your hips and knees until your chest rests on your
quads and you can place your hands ﬂat on the ﬂoor in front of you.
Try to keep your hands close to your feet, and your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor (see Figure 6-3a).
3. Hold this position for 30 seconds.
To make sure that the muscles in your neck and shoulders are relaxed, gently shake
your head from side to side as if you were saying “no.” Remember to breathe as you
hold this position.
4. Exhale and slowly begin straightening your legs until you feel tension in the back of
your thighs (see Figure 6-3b).
Your hands are still ﬂat on the ﬂoor in front of you.
5. Release the stretch by inhaling, bending your knees again, and resting your torso
back on your thighs for the length of two deep breaths.
6. Exhale, release your hands from the ﬂoor, and slowly begin to roll up, really focus-
ing on stacking your vertebrae — one at a time — until you’re standing tall.
If your back and hamstrings are tight, you may need to place your hands on a yoga block or
thick book to keep you from having to bend all the way down to the ﬂoor. This assistance
allows you to stretch the appropriate muscles without overextending and perhaps causing
pain. It’s also is a great way to gradually increase your ﬂexibility without overstretching in
the beginning.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your hands ﬂat on the ﬂoor in front of you and your neck relaxed.
 Do pull your abdominals in tight when you begin to roll up.
 Don’t tense or tighten your shoulders and/or neck.
Standing pelvic tilts
The standing pelvic tilt helps relieve tightness in your lower back and enhances mobility in
the muscles around your pelvis. These muscles include your lower erector spinae, your
lower abdominals, and your hip ﬂexors. To see an illustration of where these muscles
attach, check out Chapters 5 and 7.
Done properly, the standing pelvic tilt can help improve your sense of body awareness,
which results in better posture and less back pain. This stretch requires the use of a wall.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Place your back against a wall and walk your feet away from the wall until you can
bend your knees so you’re in a slight squat.
Your back will slide down a few inches as you walk your feet away from the wall. That’s
okay. Just make sure that you keep your shoulders and hips against the wall the entire
time. Notice that there’s a slight space between your lower back and the wall. This
space is created by the natural curve of your spine.
2. Rest your hands on your thighs just above your knees.
3. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale, slowly tilt your pelvis forward until you
feel your lower back against the wall (see Figure 6-4).

Chapter 6: Soothing Your Lower Back without Paying for a Massage

Imagine that you have two ﬂashlights attached to the front of your hipbones. When you
tilt your pelvis, the two beams of light should point slightly upward.
4. Inhale again and release the stretch by moving your pelvis back to the starting 
position.
As the natural curve of your lower back returns, your lower back will move away from
the wall.
5. Exhale and tilt your pelvis again.
Repeat the pelvic tilt and release sequence eight to ten times or as many times as feels
good to your lower back.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do hold your abdominals tight. To do so, think of your bellybutton being pulled back
toward your spine.
 Don’t try to move your upper body; the movement is in your pelvis.
 Don’t straighten your knees because that decreases the range of motion in your
pelvis and makes the stretch less effective. Keep your legs in a slight squat position
the entire time.
Shoulder stand with knees bent
If you’re looking for an exercise for your back that’s a bit more advanced, this stretch is for
you. I wouldn’t try this stretch if you’re a beginner because it requires a bit of strength to be
able to hold the position, as well as a good sense of body awareness that only comes with
experience. With that said, it’s a great stretch for your entire back and neck, focusing espe-
cially on lengthening the erector spinae to prevent tightness and injury.
Don’t try this stretch if you’re new to exercise or stretching. This stretch is advanced and
sometimes controversial, so be sure to follow the steps exactly. Avoid rolling too far back
so your body weight isn’t supported only by your neck. The small vertebrae in your neck
weren’t made to support the weight of your entire body, so don’t risk any strain or injury to
your neck.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie ﬂat on your back on your exercise mat or carpeted ﬂoor.
2. Bend your knees and pull them all the way up to your chest.
3. Rest your arms at your sides with your palms facing down (see Figure 6-5a).
4. Inhale and as you exhale, press against the ﬂoor with your hands, pull in your
abdominals, and lift your hips off the ﬂoor so your knees move toward your 
forehead.
5. Lift your hips until your body weight is supported on your shoulder blades (see
Figure 6-5b).
6. Place your palms against the back of your hips to support the weight of your hips.
7. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, and then slowly roll your body down one vertebra
at a time, using your abdominals to control the movement.
82
Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch include the following:
 Do support your back with your hands as you hold the stretch.
 Do keep your abdominals tight throughout the entire stretch.
 Do keep your shoulder blades on the ﬂoor.
 Don’t excessively ﬂex your neck or bring your chin toward your chest.
Opposite arm and leg extension
This stretch help trains all the muscles of your trunk to work together properly to provide
stability and balance, while at the same time enhancing ﬂexibility of your erector spinae and
abdominals. Remember, keeping your back strong and ﬂexible is the best prevention against
low back problems. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Get on the ﬂoor on your hands and knees and lift your abdominals as if your belly-
button is lifting toward your spine, while still maintaining neutral spine.
Basically, neutral spine is just maintaining the natural curves of your back (not exces-
sively arched or rounded). For more information about neutral spine, see Chapter 2.
Make sure to keep your shoulders relaxed, as shown in Figure 6-6a.
2. At the same time, extend your right arm and your left leg out straight from your
body and hold them out about six inches off the ﬂoor (see Figure 6-6b).
Imagine that strings are attached to your hand and foot and that the strings are gently
pulling your arm and leg away from each other, not up. You want to have the sensation
of lengthening your spine, not shortening or compressing it.
3. Hold the stretch for ﬁve to eight seconds, breathing comfortably and normally.
4. Lower your arm and leg and return to hands and knees on the ﬂoor.
5. Check to make sure you’re still lifting your abdominals, keeping your bellybutton
close to your spine and repeat the same exercise with your left arm and right leg.
6. Repeat the exercise six or seven more times on each side.

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your hips and shoulders level. If your hip of the extended leg is higher than
your other hip it may be difﬁcult to keep your balance.
 Do keep your abdominals tight. Lax abdominals may place undue stress on your lower
back muscles. Your goal is to train your abdominals and back muscles to work together
to support your spine.
 Don’t arch your back.
 Don’t lift your foot or hand above your hip or shoulder.
Releasing Tension in Your Achy, Breaky Back
The stretches in this section are designed for people who have pain in their lower back as
a result of muscle tension. The following ﬁve exercises are designed to relieve stress and
release muscle tightness in this area.

Alternating knee hugs
This exercise is a rhythmic stretch designed to help you gently stretch your lower back and
hamstrings while loosening the hip joint. It’s an easy way to slowly get your lower back to
release and let go.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
2. Inhale deeply and as you exhale, bring your right knee up toward your c
hest, placing your hands behind the knee for guidance and assistance (see
Figure 6-7).
Don’t hold your kneecap — this can cause pressure on and pain in your knee joint.
3. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.
4. Lower your leg back to the beginning position and repeat the stretch with your
left leg.
5. Alternate right and left leg stretches for eight to ten repetitions keeping the move-
ment slow and controlled.
Try this exercise while lying in bed. If your back is so sore that you can’t get up and down
from the ﬂoor, the bed makes a nice substitute for the ﬂoor.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do exhale as you bring your knee forward.
 Do keep your neck and shoulders relaxed.
 Don’t bring your knee so far toward your chest that the movement causes your hips to
lift off the ﬂoor.

Mini back massage
This stretch is my all-time favorite stretch for my lower back. Because your back is against
the ﬂoor during this exercise, your back muscles don’t have to work to hold you upright
and can now completely relax and let go.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie ﬂat on your back and bring both knees toward your chest, placing your hands
under each knee for support (see Figure 6-8a).
2. Breathe deeply and slowly rock side to side, feeling the ﬂoor against the right and
left side of your lower back.
This movement should give your lower back a gentle massage. Hug your knees for an
extra stretch as you rock side to side (see Figure 6-8b).
3. As you rock, hold the stretch for 30 to 60 seconds, depending on your level of 
comfort.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 
The tennis ball massage
Sometimes muscles that have been very tight for a long
period of time can actually lose the ability to relax on their
own, resulting in persistent muscle and skeletal imbalance,
nerve impingement, and most likely, chronic pain. When
that happens, the only thing that can really help the muscle
let go is focused massage. Unfortunately, for most people
a good massage is a luxury of both time and money. But
don’t despair — one of the most effective methods I’ve
found to apply pinpoint massage on chronically tight and
painful muscles is both quick and inexpensive. All you
need is a tennis ball and an open space on the ﬂoor.
Two techniques are useful and both are simple. Here’s
the ﬁrst one:
1. Place a tennis ball on a clean, ﬂat place on the ﬂoor,
and lie down with the ball directly beneath your tight
muscle.
2. Lie there and breathe deeply, using your own body
weight to apply pressure to the muscle while the
increased amount of oxygen in your blood helps to
initiate the relaxation response and to wash through
the tight muscle and remove toxins.
The second goes like this:
1. Place a tennis ball on a clean, ﬂat place on the ﬂoor,
and lie down with the ball directly beneath your tight
muscle.
2. Move slowly back and forth, gently rolling the tennis
ball all around the affected area to mimic the motion
of a ﬁrm, steady massage.
Do this for approximately 30 seconds, and then roll
off the tight area to give it a rest.
3. Repeat until you feel the muscle relax.
I do want to give you two precautions with this massage
technique:
 Don’t overdo it. Let the muscle relax slowly and grad-
ually. It may take repeated attempts over several
days to get severely tight muscles to stop clenching
and let go. Aggressive massage can actually bruise
the muscle, which just makes things worse and
keeps you from addressing your fundamental muscle
tension for several days until you heal.
 Never place the ball directly beneath your spine. Your
spine is made of bones, and bones won’t stretch.
They can bruise, though, and be pushed out of align-
ment, which again will only make things worse.
As a program of preventive treatment, keep a tennis ball
handy, and stretch out on the ﬂoor whenever you feel
tightness building up. These measures will keep you out
of the doctor’s ofﬁce and make your next massage all
about indulgence, not pain management.

If for any reason it’s uncomfortable to get to the ﬂoor, you can still do this stretch in bed.
You won’t feel the massage as strongly, but you will still get a nice gentle stretch for your
sore back.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do breath slowly and rhythmically.
 Do grasp your knees with both hands and pull them into your chest for a deeper
stretch.
 Don’t rock your hips so far to each side that you loose your balance. Your knees should
only move a few inches in each direction and your hips should never leave the ﬂoor.
Lying buttocks and hip stretch, legs crossed
I’ve included this stretch for your buttocks because oftentimes low back pain can actually
be caused by a tight muscle that affects the low back area. Tight muscles that affect your
back include calves, hamstrings, buttocks, and hip ﬂexors. If these muscles are tight they
can pull on surrounding muscles, causing your lower back to overcompensate, creating
poor posture and muscular imbalance.
This speciﬁc stretch targets your piriformis, which is a muscle in your buttocks that when
tight can pinch your sciatic nerve, causing pain. Because all your muscles attach to each
other and affect each other, maintaining ﬂexibility in all the areas surrounding your lower
back can go a long way toward ﬁghting low back pain.

Chapter 6: Soothing Your Lower Back without Paying for a Massage

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
You can perform this stretch lying in bed if it is more comfortable for you.
2. Place the outside of your right ankle on top of your left thigh, just above your knee.
3. Raise your left foot off the ﬂoor, inhale, and as you exhale, gently pull your left knee
closer to your chest with your hands.
Don’t forget to interlock your ﬁngers behind your left knee for support (see Figure 6-9a).
If it’s uncomfortable to interlock your hands behind your knee, try wrapping a small
hand towel around the back of your thigh and use that to gently pull your leg toward
your chest.
4. With your right elbow, gently press your right knee away from you (see Figure 6-9b).
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, gradually deepening the stretch with every 
exhalation.
6. Repeat the stretch by switching legs.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulder blades down and your upper body relaxed.
 Do be patient and let the stretch deepen with each breath.
 Don’t lift your hips off the ﬂoor or lean to one side.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.

The cow and the cat
This yoga-based move got its name from imagining what an old cow and an angry cat look
like. Not only does this move help make your back feel better, but also it improves the range
of motion in your spine, enhances strength and coordination of the muscles around your
spine, and improves muscle awareness in your entire back — all factors that make your
lower back feel better and stay healthy.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Get on the ﬂoor on your hands and knees with your hands directly under your
shoulders and your knees directly under your hips.
2. Lay the tops of your feet on the ﬂoor and point your toes back.
3. Inhale and arch your back, lifting your tailbone and eyes toward the ceiling (see
Figure 6-10a).
4. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, release the position back to neutral spine, and
then inhale again.
5. Exhale and contract your abdominals, rounding your back like an angry cat (see
Figure 6-10b).
6. Hold this position for a few seconds and then release back to neutral spine.
7. Repeat this stretch four to six times.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do pull your bellybutton toward your spine.
 Do keep the movement in your pelvis and lower back, not in your shoulders.
 Don’t tense up your shoulders and neck.
 Don’t overextend your neck while doing the old cow position.
Hip flexor stretch on one knee
Because your hip ﬂexor muscles run across the front of your hip and attach to your lower
back, tight hip ﬂexor muscles may be a hidden source of lower back tension. This stretch
helps lengthen the iliopsoas (il-ee-oh-so-as) and relaxes your lower back.

Chapter 6: Soothing Your Lower Back without Paying for a Massage

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Kneel on your left knee.
2. Bend your right knee, and place your right foot ﬂat on the ﬂoor (see Figure 6-11).
Make sure your abdominals are pulled in, chest is lifted, and your shoulder blades are
down. Check to see if your shoulders are directly above your hips. Maintaining good
posture with your upper body allows you to correctly stretch without straining.

A little TLC for your back
According to the American Academy of Orthopedic
Surgeons (AAOS), four out of ﬁve adults experience sig-
niﬁcant low back pain sometime during their life.
Work-related back injuries are the nation’s number-one
occupational hazard, but you can suffer back pain from
activities at home and at play, too. The AAOS has devel-
oped the following tips to help reduce the risk of back
pain when lifting and moving any kind of heavy weight:
 When standing, spread your feet shoulder-width
apart to give yourself a solid base of support and
then slightly bend your knees.
 Tighten your stomach muscles before lifting.
 Position the person or object close to your body
before lifting.
 Lift with your leg muscles. Never lift an object by
keeping your legs stiff, while bending over it.
 Avoid twisting your body; instead, point your toes in
the direction you want to move and pivot in that
direction.
 When placing an object on a high shelf, move close
to the shelf.
 During lifting movements, maintain the natural curve
of your spine; don’t bend at your waist.
 Do not try to lift something that is too heavy by your-
self or that is an awkward shape. Get help.
For more information, check out the AAOS Web site
at www.aaos.org.

3. Inhale and as you exhale, squeeze your buttocks and tilt your pelvis forward so that
the front of your hipbones tilt slightly upward.
You should feel this stretch in the front part of your right hip.
4. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 3, bending the left leg and kneeling on the right knee.
If this stretch is uncomfortable on the knee supporting your weight, try placing a
folded towel or pillow under your knee as a cushion.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe rhythmically and deeply throughout the stretch.
 Do keep your shoulders directly over your hips so the front of your hip is lengthened,
not shortened.
 Do focus on squeezing your buttocks and tilting your pelvis forward.
 Don’t hinge forward at your hips.
 Don’t arch your back.

Chapter 7
From Your Knickers to Your Kickers:
Stretches for your Bottom Half
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with the muscles of your lower body
 Loosening up your hips and buttocks
 Stretching your thighs
 Performing lower leg stretches
 Taking care of your feet and ankles
T
he muscles of your lower body — your hips, buttocks, thighs, calves, ankles, and feet —
all work together like the many different instruments in an orchestra. When they’re all
doing their part, they make beautiful music together, but when one of them is out of tune,
the entire performance suffers.
Tightness in the lower body can be the hidden culprit in a wide variety of ailments that, at
ﬁrst glance, you may not blame them for. Poor posture, disorders of the back such as lordo-
sis (swayback) or scoliosis (lateral curvature of the spine), indigestion, headaches, and
even difﬁculty breathing can all be caused to one degree or another by imbalances in the
lower body due to muscle tension and tightness.
For yet another example, a runner with tight hamstrings can have a shortened stride due to
the tightness. A shortened stride means more steps, which means expending more energy,
which means energy wasted. It also means more impact, which can lead to more injuries.
But stretching can stop this cycle of doom, once and for all.
In this chapter, I break down the muscles of the lower body into sections: hips and buttocks,
hamstrings, quadriceps, groin and inner thigh, lower leg, and feet and ankles. Each section
gives you a variety of stretches for that particular area. Experiment with each stretch to see
which stretches suit your body best.
Throughout the following stretches for your hips, buttocks, and thighs, be aware of the
position of your pelvis (see Figure 7-1). All these muscles are attached to your pelvis in one
way or another, and if your pelvis isn’t correctly positioned, you can diminish the effective-
ness of these stretches. To improve your body awareness in this area, try doing the pelvic
tilts I describe in Chapter 8.

Behind the Scenes: Hips and Buttocks
What does an athlete who never stretches and a dedicated couch potato have in common?
If you said they both really need to read this book, you’re right! But another answer is that
even though one is actually an athlete, they both probably have tight hip ﬂexors.
To enhance your wealth of knowledge about your body, here are a few terms to tuck away
regarding the hip and buttocks muscles and their functional roles (no, not the role of sway-
ing to and fro to attract that special someone’s attention):
 Hip ﬂexors: These muscles are also known as the iliopsoas (il-ee-oh-so-as) and are made
up of three muscles — the psoas (so-as) major, psoas minor, and iliacus (il-ee-ah-kus)
that run across the front of the hip and pass through the pelvis, attaching to your
lower back area. They work together to ﬂex the hips and rotate the lower spine.
This area can get very tight because it gets a lot of use. The hip ﬂexors are the muscles
that lift your knee or move your leg forward is such movements as going up stairs,
walking, running, or just about anything that has to do with forward motion. Ironically,
these muscles can also get tight and shorten if you sit all day. And, because this muscle
group attaches to your lower back area, if it is tight it can cause lower back pain.
 Glutes: One of the primary muscles of the buttocks; “glutes” is slang that collectively
refers to the three muscles in the buttocks:
• Gluteus maximus: The largest and most superﬁcial muscle in your buttocks, the
maximus is responsible for hip extension, and it also helps rotate the hip outward.
• Gluteus medius: This muscle is the mid-size glute, and its function is to move
your leg to the side (abduction of your hip joint). It also helps rotate your thigh
inward and outward.
• Gluteus minimus: The smallest and deepest of the glutes. It also functions as a
hip abductor and rotates the thigh inward and outward.
 Piriformis: The piriformis (peer-i-for-mus) plays an important role in stabilizing the
spine, working together with the iliopsoas to create pelvic balance.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

If either the iliopsoas or the piriformis is excessively tight or weak, you can experience low
back pain or other postural problems. That’s why it’s important to balance the strength and
ﬂexibility of the iliopsoas muscle (front of the hip) with the strength and ﬂexibility of the
glutes and piriformis (buttocks).
The following stretches give you several options to stretch the entire hip and buttocks area.
Runner’s lunge
The runner’s lunge is one of the best stretches for everyone, not just runners. The stretch
targets your iliopsoas. Because of the importance of these muscles to your back health and
overall leg health, no matter what, stretching this area is a must.
If this stretch is uncomfortable for you to get into, try doing it with your back leg extended
on an exercise bench and your front foot on the ﬂoor.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Begin standing with your legs spread about two feet apart with the right foot in
front of you and the left foot behind you (see Figure 7-2a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, bend both knees until you can place both hands on the
ﬂoor directly behind your right heel.
3. Slide your left leg back far enough so you can lower your knee to the ﬂoor without
putting weight on your kneecap (see Figure 7-2b).
4. Inhale again and as you exhale gently press the front of the hip of your left leg
toward the ﬂoor.
5. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
6. Repeat the same stretch on the right side.

Chapter 7: From Your Knickers to Your Kickers: Stretches for Your Bottom Half

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your chest lifted and your shoulder blades down.
 Do keep your front knee at a right angle and directly over your front heel.
 Do progress through the stretch gradually and slowly.
 Don’t jut your front knee forward — if your front knee is moving forward, you could be
putting undue strain on your knee.
 Don’t put your weight on the kneecap of the leg behind you. Instead, your weight
should be supported on the softer part of your leg just above your kneecap.
Lying buttocks stretch with foot 
to opposite shoulder
This lying buttocks stretch speciﬁcally targets your gluteus maximus. To do this stretch,
follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your legs straight out in front of you.
2. Bring your right knee toward your chest, keeping your left leg straight.
3. With your right hand, hold your knee (on top of the knee) and grab your right ankle
with your left hand.
4. Inhale and as you exhale pull your foot toward your opposite shoulder and your
knee toward the midline of your body (see Figure 7-3).
Make sure to keep your shoulders and head on the ﬂoor.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve deep breaths.
6. Repeat the stretch on your left side.
This stretch can also be done sitting with your back against a wall, but remember to keep
your back upright and your opposite leg straight.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulders and head on the ﬂoor.
 Do breathe throughout the stretch.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

 Do progress through the stretch gradually and slowly.
 Don’t pull on your foot only; this places undue stress on your knee.
 Don’t tuck your pelvis under — think of tilting your tailbone toward the ﬂoor.
Buttocks stretch
Believe it or not, nine muscles make up the buttocks area. And, believe it or not, this lying
hip and buttocks stretch lengthens them all — even the smaller, deeper muscles.
If your buttocks is tight, speciﬁcally your piriformis muscle, it can pinch your sciatic nerve
and cause pain similar to sciatica. This stretch speciﬁcally targets the piriformis.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
2. Lift your right foot and place the outside of your right ankle on your left thigh, just
above your knee.
3. Raise your left foot off the ﬂoor, inhale, and as you exhale, gently pull your left knee
closer to your chest with your hands (see Figure 7-4a).
Don’t forget to interlock your ﬁngers behind your left knee for support. If it’s uncom-
fortable to interlock your hands behind your knee, try wrapping a small hand towel
around the back of your thigh and use that to gently pull your leg toward your chest.
4. With your right elbow, gently press your right knee away from you (see Figure 7-4b).
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, gradually deepening the stretch with every 
exhalation.
6. Repeat the stretch by switching legs.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulder blades down and your upper body relaxed.
 Do be patient and let the stretch deepen with each breath.
 Don’t lift your hips off the ﬂoor or lean to one side.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.

Seated external rotator stretch
Dancers love this stretch because it targets the muscles that outwardly rotate the hips and
thighs — your gluteus medius and gluteus minimus (muscles that get used a lot if you’re a
ballet dancer). As an added bonus, you get a nice stretch in your core muscles, too.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your right leg straight in front of you and your left foot crossed
over your right thigh.
2. As you inhale, pull your left knee toward your chest with your right hand and sit up
very straight as if a string was attached to the top of your head, lengthening your
spine (see Figure 7-5a).
3. As you exhale, look over your left shoulder, rotating your spine and tilting your
pelvis back (see Figure 7-5b).
4. Hold the stretch for about 30 seconds, deepening the stretch with every breath.
Feel this stretch in your buttocks and pay close attention to the position of your pelvis.
Imagine a string attached to your tailbone pulling your tailbone toward the back wall.
5. Switch sides and repeat the same stretch on your other leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do bring your knee close to your chest before you twist.
 Do look over your shoulder so you lengthen your neck muscles as well.
 Do sit up straight to lengthen your spine before you rotate.
 Don’t tuck your pelvis under or round your back.
Tight End: Back of the Thigh
Three primary muscles bend your knee and extend your hip: the biceps femoris (fem-er-is),
the semitendinosus (semi-ten-duh-no-sis), and the semimembranosus (semi-mem-bruh-no-sis).
Together, these three muscles are collectively known as your hamstrings. All of them are
found next to each other in the back of your thigh.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

Because you use your hamstrings for just about every movement your legs make, an injury
to this area takes a long time to heal, and these muscles are easy to reinjure. A pulled ham-
string can sideline you for a long time — just ask any professional athlete what a “pain in
the butt” it is! So it’s important to do all you can to avoid a strain or pull in this area.
A hamstring pull — a strain injury caused by a violent overextension or rapid contraction of
the muscle — could be caused by an imbalance of strength between your hamstrings and
your quadriceps or because of an imbalance of strength between your right and left leg.
But in most cases the cause of the injury is a fundamental lack of ﬂexibility. Keeping your
hamstrings ﬂexible is your best defense against this type of injury. So get stretching!
Lying leg extension
The lying leg extension is one of the easiest positions in which to isolate your hamstrings
without having any other muscles pulling or straining. If you know you have tight ham-
strings, I recommend using a towel or stretching strap (as I mention in Chapter 2) to help
keep your upper body relaxed and tension free.
If your hamstrings are extremely tight, you may ﬁnd it more comfortable to do this stretch
lying in a doorway with one leg on the ﬂoor and the other leg extended and resting against
the doorjamb. As you get more ﬂexible, your hips will get closer to the wall.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and close to your buttocks.
2. Lift your right leg and extend it upward (see Figure 7-6a).
3. Place one hand behind your thigh and one hand behind your knee or calf.
Try to keep your leg straight but remember to stay in your comfort zone.
4. Inhale and as you exhale gently pull your leg closer toward your shoulders (see
Figure 7-6b).
Remember to keep your shoulders on the ground. Feel the stretch deepen with every
exhale until you’ve reached the deepest point of the stretch.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
6. Repeat the stretch on your other leg.

Chapter 7: From Your Knickers to Your Kickers: Stretches for Your Bottom Half

Your goal is to feel the stretch in the back of your thigh, not to get your knee to your nose.
It’s important to anchor your hips to the ﬂoor, not to tuck your pelvis under or round your
back. Don’t worry about how far down your leg gets; just feel the stretch in your hamstring.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do progress through the stretch gradually.
 Do lie comfortably on the ﬂoor with your arms and shoulders relaxed.
 Don’t tuck your hips under or lift them off the ﬂoor.
 Don’t bend your knee.
Standing stretch with foot on chair
If getting on the ground is uncomfortable or inconvenient for you, try out this hamstring
stretch. You can use a chair or bench or even a fence if you’ve just ﬁnished running out-
doors. Just make sure that where you place your foot is no higher than your hips.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up straight with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and your abdominals lifted.
2. Lift your right leg and rest it on a chair or bench straight in front of you.
Keep your hips squared to the front and both legs straight (see Figure 7-7a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, lean forward from your hips and feel the stretch deepen
in the back of your thigh (see Figure 7-7b).
Avoid rounding or bending your back.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
5. Repeat this stretch on the other leg.

One trick I use to get a muscle group to relax is to contract the opposing muscle group.
Try contracting your quadriceps (the muscles in the front of your thigh) while you stretch
your hamstrings (the back of your thigh). This can help relax your hamstrings while you
hold this stretch, and if your hamstrings are relaxed you get a deeper stretch.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do progress through the stretch gradually.
 Do tilt your pelvis back, not under.
 Don’t round or bend at your waist; hinge at the hips and keep your back straight.
Modified hurdler stretch
You may remember the hurdler stretch from PE class, sitting on the grass with your bent
knee twisted behind you. Fitness folks now know that that extreme position can put a lot of
stress on your knee. I hope you ﬁnd this modiﬁcation more comfortable and less risky. You
also get the added beneﬁt of stretching your back and calf muscles, too.
This stretch is more comfortable and effective to perform by using the aid of a towel or
stretching strap (see Chapter 2 for more details on straps).
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your right leg straight out in front of you, your left leg bent
inward at a comfortable angle, and your arms to your sides (see Figure 7-8a).
2. As you exhale, hinge forward at the hip, keeping your right leg straight and your
foot relaxed.
3. Reach forward toward your toes as far as you can without bending your knee.
If your right knee begins to bend or your upper back begins to tighten and get tense, you
have gone too far. See Figure 7-8b for a visual of this stretching motion. You can also imag-
ine your tailbone moving toward the back of the room and your heel reaching toward the
front of the room. This visualization should help you lengthen the back of your leg from
both directions. Your tailbone should be reaching back as you hinge forward at the hips.
4. Breathe deeply and hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
Deepen the stretch with each breath by tilting your pelvis back, lifting your chest, and
ﬂexing your foot so your toes are moving toward your shoulders.
5. Switch sides and repeat the same stretch on your other leg.

Chapter 7: From Your Knickers to Your Kickers: Stretches for Your Bottom Half

If you have trouble keeping your shoulders and neck relaxed, try hooking a towel or 
stretching strap (described in Chapter 2) around the ball of your foot and then gently
pulling on the ends of the towel/strap. Don’t get discouraged if your chest is nowhere near
your leg. As long as you’re feeling a good deep stretch in the back of your thigh, you’re
doing great!
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do gently hinge forward at your hips with your eyes looking forward.
 Do keep your knee straight, and try to keep the back of your knee on the ﬂoor.
 Do keep your back straight, not rounded, and don’t tense your shoulders.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.
 Don’t look down at your knee; look at the ﬂoor in front of your toes.
Forward Thinking: Front of Thighs
The front of your thigh is a group of four muscles that work together known as the quadri-
ceps (called quads for short): the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and the
vastus intermedius. Their main function is to extend your knee, so that means that they get
used a lot. If these muscles get excessively tight, they can pull unevenly on your knee joint,
which can cause knee pain. The stretches in this section show you how to stretch and
lengthen your quads.
Ankle to buttocks, on your side
Give yourself a kick in the buttocks (literally) with this quad stretch. Okay, it’s really not
that hard. This stretch has you lying on your side, and contains two unique features: It’s one
of the most accessible quad stretches to get into, and after you’re in it, proper form is easy
to maintain. I recommend this stretch if you’re new to stretching.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Start by lying on your right side with your knees bent close to your chest.
2. Rest your right arm comfortably in a bent position underneath your head (to sup-
port your head) — see Figure 7-9a.
3. Grab the top of your left foot and gently pull your ankle back toward your buttocks
(see Figure 7-9b).
You should feel the stretch in the front of your thigh. If you squeeze your buttocks,
you can increase the stretch, but don’t let your hips roll back. Always keep your hips
stacked on top of each other, and focus on bringing the knee back. Don’t force your
heel toward your buttocks, which can put undue pressure on your knee joint.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, and then repeat the stretch with your right leg and
lying on your left side.
102
Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do squeeze your buttocks and slightly tuck your pelvis under to deepen the stretch.
 Do keep your bottom knee bent for balance.
 Don’t jam your heel toward your buttocks.
 Don’t hold your breath.
 Don’t lift the knee — try to keep your inner thighs touching each other.
Heel to buttocks, facedown
If your quads are stiff or sore after a workout, try this stretch as a cool-down to further
stretch and relax your muscles.

Chapter 7: From Your Knickers to Your Kickers: Stretches for Your Bottom Half

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on the ﬂoor, facedown with both legs straight out behind your body and your
left hand at your side.
2. Make a ﬁst with your right hand and rest your forehead on your ﬁst.
3. Bend your left knee and raise your heel toward your buttocks.
4. Reach back with your left hand and grab the top of your left foot and hold the foot
in place (see Figure 7-10).
If you have difﬁculty reaching the top of your foot, grab the back of your heel, ankle, or
even the hem of your pant leg. But don’t pull down on your foot. Instead, just rest your
foot in your hand as you focus on pressing your hip to the ﬂoor. This should keep the
stretch in your quads, not in your knee joint.
5. Inhale and as you exhale squeeze your buttocks and gently press your hip toward
the ﬂoor.
Avoid letting your left knee move out to the side as you reach for it with your left hand.
Try to keep your knees as close together as you can; this position avoids misalignment,
which can cause stress to your knee joint.
6. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
7. Repeat Steps 1 through 6 with your right leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your head down and resting on your ﬁst.
 Do breathe to relax into the stretch.
 Do keep your knees together and squeeze your buttocks.
 Do focus on pressing your hip toward the ﬂoor.
 Don’t focus on bringing your foot to your buttocks.
Standing stretch, knee toward buttocks
This stretch is a great standing stretch that targets your quads. Because this stretch is done
standing, it’s probably the most practical and convenient stretch to do after you’ve been
exercising outdoors because you won’t need to lie down on the wet grass or muddy ground.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

1. Stand up tall and place your right hand on a stable surface.
The surface can be a chair, wall, doorway, or fence — anything that’s sturdy and helps
you keep your balance during this stretch.
2. Inhale and lift your left knee toward the sky and grab hold of your left ankle (or top
of your foot) with your left hand (see Figure 7-11a).
3. Exhale and slowly lower your left knee and gently move your left foot toward your
left buttocks (see Figure 7-11b).
Try to keep the inside of your thighs touching and focus on moving your knee back,
not forcing your foot to touch your buttocks. To really feel this stretch correctly, try to
tuck your pelvis under and think about your tailbone moving toward the ﬂoor.
4. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or about four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
5. Repeat the stretch with the right leg.
To make this exercise one for balance as well, try to let go of the stable surface and see if
you can hold your balance as you continue to stretch your quadriceps.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do stand up tall with your chest lifted, abs in, and shoulder blades down to help you
feel the stretch correctly and practice good posture, too!
 Do tilt your pelvis under.
 Don’t put undue stress on your knee by forcing your foot to touch your buttocks.
 Don’t let your knee move to the side; keep the insides of your legs touching.

Chapter 7: From Your Knickers to Your Kickers: Stretches for Your Bottom Half

Becoming Master of Your Inner Thighs
Five muscles make up the area commonly known as the groin. These muscles are the adduc-
tor longus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, gracilis, and pectineus. To simplify things,
just call them your adductors or inner thigh muscles. Like your hamstrings, these muscles
are involved in almost every movement of your legs, and if they’re tight, they may be prone
to injuries, which are awkward to treat. Your best bet to avoid this difﬁcult and painful situa-
tion is not only to keep these muscles strong but also to stretch them regularly.
Standing groin stretch
Your adductors are the muscles that run along your inner thighs and groin. Although there
are many different ways to stretch your adductors, this stretch is probably the easiest way
to stretch your entire groin area without tensing your neck, shoulders, and back.
Grab a chair for this exercise — and make sure that the chair is sturdy and stable. No rolling
ofﬁce chairs for this stretch!
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand next to a chair and raise your leg that’s closest to the chair to place your foot
on the seat of the chair.
Make sure to keep your hips and shoulders facing forward, as shown in Figure 7-12a.
2. Exhale slowly as you bend forward and lower your hands toward the ﬂoor.
Check out Figure 7-12b for the visualization of this stretch. Let gravity do the work —
you shouldn’t have to. If you feel too much strain, place one hand on the seat of the
chair to give you a little more control over the stretch.
3. Gradually deepen the stretch with every exhale as you hold this stretch for 30 seconds.
Shake your head “no” to make sure that you aren’t holding tension in your neck.
4. Roll up slowly and repeat the stretch with your other leg.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do tilt your pelvis back so you feel the stretch a little deeper in your groin.
 Don’t rush!
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch because those motions can cause the muscles to
tighten up rather than relax and lengthen.
Seated straddle stretch
Even though this is a common stretch, because of the complexity of all the muscles
involved it’s not an easy stretch to do properly. Your hamstrings, back, and inner thighs
must all work together to perform this stretch with good form. If any of these areas are tight
the effectiveness of the stretch can be compromised.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your legs straight and your feet as far apart as possible.
2. Place your hands behind your hips and sit up very tall.
Keeping your hands behind your hips helps you keep your spine lifted and straight,
allowing you to stretch your back, inner thighs, and hamstrings without creating ten-
sion in your shoulders and upper back.
3. Move your hips forward an inch or two until you feel the stretch along both inner
thighs (see Figure 7-13a).
4. Inhale, and as you exhale, lean slightly forward, tilting your pelvis back (see
Figure 7-13b).
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
If keeping your back straight and your hips tilted back is difﬁcult, try performing this
stretch while sitting on a pillow or folded towel or blanket. By raising your hips off the
ﬂoor, some stress on your hamstrings will ease, allowing you to focus on your inner 
thighs.
a

stretch.
107
Chapter 7: From Your Knickers to Your Kickers: Stretches for Your Bottom Half

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your knees and toes facing upward toward the ceiling.
 Do tilt your pelvis back as you lift your chest.
 Do breathe deeply through the entire stretch.
 Don’t place your hands in front of you unless you can keep them there without round-
ing your spine or tucking your pelvis under.
 Don’t bounce this stretch.
Putting Your Best Foot (And 
Lower Leg) Forward
Your lower leg is basically made up of the area between your knee and ankle — speciﬁcally
your calf and shin. Many little muscles make up your calf, but the two muscles I 
think you should be aware of are your gastrocnemius (gas-trok-nee-mee-uhs) and your 
soleus (soh-lee-uhs). The gastrocnemius pretty much deﬁnes your calf and the soleus is the
smaller muscle under your gastrocnemius). These two muscles do most of the work of point-
ing your foot downward, including pushing off when you walk, run, or jump. Because these
muscles attach to your heel with your Achilles tendon, if these muscles are excessively
tight, they can put undue stress on your Achilles tendon, and you know what happened
to Achilles!
Standing calf stretch
Wearing high heels and standing for long periods of time can tighten and shorten your calf
muscles, which over time can actually cause lower back pain. This stretch helps keep you
limber if you’re one of the many who wear heels regularly or stand all day. Try to ﬁnd a
moment several times during the day to stretch your calves (if you’re wearing heels, take
them off ﬁrst!).
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Face a wall or sturdy surface and stand one foot away with your feet together.
2. Lean forward and place your hands directly on the wall in front of you.
3. Move your left foot back as far as you can while still keeping your heel on the ﬂoor.
4. Bend the right knee slightly but keep the left knee straight.
Try to keep your toes pointing directly forward in line with your heel. The more you
turn your toes outward, the less effective the stretch for your calf.
5. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently press your hips forward, keeping
your left heel on the ground (see Figure 7-14a).
6. Hold the stretch for several deep breaths and then slightly bend your left knee with-
out lifting your heel off the ﬂoor (see Figure 7-14b).
By bending your knee you stretch an additional muscle in your calf, which is important
for ankle ﬂexibility.
7. Repeat this stretch with your right leg.
108
Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your toes and heel in line.
 Do keep your heel on the ﬂoor.
 Do breathe deeply and rhythmically throughout the stretch.
 Don’t round your back — keep your neck, shoulders, back, hips, and rear leg in
one line.
Achilles tendon stretch on one knee
One of the more common severe injuries of the weekend warrior is a torn or ruptured
Achilles tendon. This type of injury can only be treated with surgery and/or prolonged
immobilization in a cast. Trust me; neither option is any fun at all. Keeping this area ﬂexible
and strong is a good preventive approach to keep the injuries and the doctors away. (Who
needs apples? Just stretch!)
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Kneel on one knee with your hips back on your heel and your other foot ﬂat on the
ﬂoor next to your knee (see Figure 7-15a).
2. Place your hands on the ﬂoor in front of you and inhale; as you exhale shift your
body weight forward, keeping your heel on the ﬂoor as you lean forward (see
Figure 7-15b).
You should feel the stretch in your Achilles tendon in your front leg.
4. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
5. Repeat this stretch on your other leg.

Chapter 7: From Your Knickers to Your Kickers: Stretches for Your Bottom Half

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your eyes looking down toward your ﬁngers.
 Do keep your weight moving forward past your toes.
 Do keep your hips over your back foot.
 Don’t lift your back heel off the ﬂoor.
 Don’t force or bounce the stretch.
Kneeling shin stretch
Probably the most common injury to your shin area is called shin splints. Shin splints
happen for many reasons: overuse, working out on a hard surface, fallen arches in your feet,
and even lack of ﬂexibility. Try this next stretch to keep this area lengthened and ﬂexible.
Skip this stretch if you have bad knees because the exercise may be uncomfortable for you.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Kneel on a carpeted ﬂoor or mat with your toes pointed backward.
2. Lower your hips and sit on top of your heels (see Figure 7-16a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale grab the top of your left foot and gently pull it toward your
buttocks (see Figure 7-16b).
4. You should feel this stretch in your left shin.

5. Hold the stretch for a few seconds and release.
6. Repeat this stretch a few more times on your left side and then switch sides, repeat-
ing the stretch an equal number of times on the right.
If this position is uncomfortable or creates pain in your knees because of lack of range of
motion, try rolling a towel and placing it behind your knees and under your buttocks. Also,
make sure you’re on a comfortable mat or carpet while performing this stretch.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do sit on your heels.
 Do lift your abdominals while you lift your foot and maintain the natural curve of your
spine.
 Don’t allow your buttocks to sit on the ﬂoor between your heels — it creates stress on
your knees.
On your hands and knees: Bottom of foot stretch
Flexible and limber feet and ankles can absorb the pounding of walking, running, and jump-
ing more efﬁciently than if your feet and ankles are tight and rigid. This stretch targets the
muscles that run along the entire bottom of your feet. It doesn’t beat a foot massage, but if
you’re prone to cramping in your feet you should do this stretch every day.

Chapter 7: From Your Knickers to Your Kickers: Stretches for Your Bottom Half

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Begin with your hands and knees on the ﬂoor (all-fours position).
2. Flex your feet so your toes are moving toward your knees (see Figure 7-17a).
3. Inhale and gently move your hips back and down toward your heels and move your
heels up, toward your hips (see Figure 7-17b).
You should feel this stretch on the bottom of your feet.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds by using deep breathing to help you sink gradually
deeper into the stretch.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do move your hips back toward your heels.
 Do focus on lifting your heels as you gently press the balls of your feet toward the ﬂoor.
 Do lift your bellybutton toward your spine.
 Don’t hold your breath.
Lying ankle circles
This exercise is designed to loosen up the muscles around your ankles and to increase cir-
culation in your feet and lower legs. To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your left leg straight out in front of you and your right knee
lifted toward your chest.
2. Inhale, and as you exhale, circle your right ankle clockwise four to eight times.
3. Reverse the circle counterclockwise for four to eight rotations (see Figure 7-18).
If it’s more comfortable, bend your opposite knee while you circle your ankle.

Chapter 7: From Your Knickers to Your Kickers: Stretches for Your Bottom Half
In case you always wanted to do the splits
Two kinds of splits — forward splits and straddle or side
splits — are both considered advanced stretches
because they require extreme ﬂexibility in your ham-
strings, hip ﬂexors, quads, and adductors. Keep in mind
that doing the splits isn’t necessary for everyday life.
Gymnasts, cheerleaders, dancers, and advanced ath-
letes in martial arts or ﬁgure skating are really the only
ones who need that much ﬂexibility. If your goal is to feel
better and move more freely, then just stick to the exer-
cises in this chapter.
Is trying to do a split a good idea or a bad idea? For gen-
erations, many have regarded achieving a perfect split
as the height of ﬂexibility, but because of its allure, it has
enticed many people unprepared for the demands of the
stretch into an uncomfortable and possibly harmful posi-
tion. Perhaps the real question isn’t whether to attempt
the stretch, but why? To do the splits properly requires a
real investment of time and discipline, and if you’re not
performing in Cirque du Soleil, it might not be worth the
payoff. Nevertheless, if doing the splits is something
you’ve always wanted to do, follow these guidelines:
1. Warm up!
2. Perform individual stretches for your hamstrings,
quads, and inner thighs (see examples in this chapter).
Make sure these areas are warm and limber before
you make your ﬁrst attempt.
3. Begin kneeling on one leg and place your opposite
foot out in front of you ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
4. Slowly slide the knee beneath you backward as far
as you can.
Notice that your front leg gradually extends. Find your
comfort zone and stay there for a few deep breaths.
5. Inhale and as you exhale, see if you can move the knee
back a little farther and take the stretch a little deeper.
6. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then release the
stretch by coming back to the starting position.
7. Try the stretch again and repeat two or three times —
each time trying to go a little deeper and getting
your legs straighter.
Don’t expect to be able to do a perfect split right away.
It will take weeks of slowly and progressively increasing
your range of motion in the split position. As with any
stretch, perform this one slowly and carefully and pay
attention to form. In a perfect split, both legs must be
straight, both hips must face forward, and the buttock of
your front leg should be on the ﬂoor. You probably won’t
get it the ﬁrst time you try, but you can gradually get a
little farther every day. Don’t be discouraged.
It’s really fun to do something you thought was impossi-
ble, and many of you may think it’s impossible to do a
perfect split. But you never know until you try.

Total-Body Stretch Routines
In This Chapter
 Practicing deep breathing exercises
 Performing a ten-minute, total-body routine, using basic stretch exercises
 Adding additional stretches when you have more time
I
n this chapter I’ve designed a total-body stretching routine that helps teach you body
awareness and presents a selection of basic, effective stretches for the entire body in the
most accessible, comfortable position possible. The sense of body awareness you develop
in this total-body series stays with you always.
If you’re just starting a stretching program and this chapter is your ﬁrst stop, be patient and
give yourself time to work up slowly (which means only do what feels comfortable to you).
The single most important thing you need to keep in mind when beginning a stretching pro-
gram is to be patient. Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither were your muscles — relaxing
your tight muscles and getting comfortable with stretching takes longer than a day.
Getting to Your Whole Body in Just Ten Minutes
The total-body routine in this section progresses through three stages:
 Breathing is the most fundamental of all stretching techniques. Breathing helps your
muscles relax, which makes your stretches more effective. If your body has any ten-
sion, then your muscles won’t stretch to their full potential.
 Correct body alignment is important for good posture and to prevent injury. The total-
body routine helps you ﬁnd and maintain a neutral spine (keeping your hips, buttocks,
and back all in one straight line) to assist in proper alignment. This stretching routine
also helps you strengthen your shoulders and upper back so you can stand up tall and
proud.
 Stretching all the major muscle groups leads to whole-body wellness, and this routine
helps you slowly progress through a sequence of stretches designed to concentrate on
all those major muscle groups — from your top to the bottom. Just start at the begin-
ning of this routine and work your way through each stretch as prescribed below.
Each stage above is a building block. For instance, after you master the proper technique
for breathing, you then use your breath to relax so you can focus on enhanced body aware-
ness throughout the following stretches.
In addition, this total-body routine is full of ACD stretches — Anyone-Can-Do stretches (or
at least that’s what I call them). This sequence of stretches gently allows you to increase
your awareness of your body and the way it feels, while helping you get more comfortable
with the basic stretches.

Follow this ten-minute routine every day, and on days you have a little extra time, add the
last set of ten stretches, under “When You Just Can’t Get Enough: Ten More Minutes of
Stretching,” later in this chapter, for a comprehensive 20-minute routine.
Deep breathing exercise
The purpose of this simple breathing exercise is to focus on your breathing so when you
actually do start stretching, you relax and your muscles are tension free.
If you close your eyes during this exercise you may have more luck clearing your mind of
other thoughts. Now is not the time to think about what you’re having for lunch or whom
you may have forgotten to call. This time is for thinking only about your body, your breath-
ing, and your movement.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back on the ﬂoor with your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
Take a moment to feel neutral spine — the natural curve of your back as you lie on the
ﬂoor.
2. Place your hands on your lower abdomen (see Figure 8-1), and inhale deeply
through your nose and feel your rib cage expand as you ﬁll your lungs with air.
3. As you exhale, push the air out through your nose or mouth.
Feel your rib cage shrink back to its original size.
4. Repeat this exercise ﬁve times.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your lower back on the ﬂoor during this exercise.
 Do keep your body relaxed and free of tension.
 Don’t forget to feel your rib cage with your hands as it expands and shrinks.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

Lying pelvic tilts
This exercise is designed to help you discover body awareness in the hip and pelvis area —
which is responsible for many everyday movements like climbing stairs and maintaining
your balance. And this stretch not only warms up the muscles around the pelvic girdle but
also helps you ﬁnd and maintain neutral spine.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. On a comfortable surface such as a carpeted ﬂoor or a stretching mat, lie on your
back with your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor or mat.
2. Inhale deeply and as you exhale, tip your pelvis upward so you feel your lower back
gently pressing against the ﬂoor (see Figure 8-2a).
Keep your upper body relaxed and tension free. Focus on moving only your pelvis.
3. Release back to neutral spine (see Figure 8-2b).
4. Repeat this exercise eight to ten times.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your upper back on the ﬂoor.
 Do keep your neck and shoulders relaxed.
 Don’t squeeze your buttocks when you tilt.

Chapter 8: Total-Body Stretch Routines

Lying arm circles
The purpose of this exercise is to teach you how to increase body awareness by stabilizing
your shoulder girdle (the area surrounding the shoulder) and maintaining neutral spine
when you move your arms. This stretch also warms up your shoulders and prepares you for
the upper body stretches to come.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor with your arms
at your sides.
2. Take a deep breath and lift your arms above you on the ﬂoor (see Figure 8-3a).
3. As you exhale, lower your arms back to your sides in a circular pattern as if you
were lying in the snow and making a snow angel (see Figure 8-3b).
4. Repeat this exercise eight to ten times.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your neck long and relaxed.
 Do keep your shoulder blades down as you lift your arms overhead.
 Don’t arch your back or move your rib cage as you lift your arms.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

Lying spinal rotation with bent knees
I love this exercise because it’s one of the simplest ways to increase or maintain range of
motion in the trunk, hips, and buttocks areas. Flexibility in these areas is crucial for func-
tional ﬁtness — being in shape for everyday life!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back and bring your knees to your chest and extend your arms out from
your sides (see Figure 8-4a).
2. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale, slowly lower your legs to one side until
they reach the ﬂoor, keeping your arms ﬂat on the ﬂoor (see in Figure 8-4b).
Be sure to keep the opposite shoulder blade and your head on the ﬂoor.
3. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds, taking several deep breaths as you relax into
the stretch.
4. Slowly lift your knees back to center and repeat the same stretch on the other side.
Do’s and don’ts for this exercise include the following:
 Do keep your shoulders down and relaxed.
 Don’t hold your breath.

Chapter 8: Total-Body Stretch Routines

Lying neck stretch
This simple stretch is one of the easiest ways to help relieve tension in your neck and 
shoulders.
You need to be very gentle with this stretch — deﬁnitely no forcing the stretch or yanking
on your neck.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
2. Interlock your ﬁngers behind your head (see Figure 8-5a).
3. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale, slowly lift your head with your hands,
bringing your chin toward your chest (see Figure 8-5b).
Be sure to keep both shoulder blades on the ﬂoor and lift only your neck. Because of
where the muscles of your upper back and neck are attached, you diminish the effec-
tiveness of this stretch if you lift your shoulder blades off the ﬂoor.
4. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds, taking several deep breaths as you relax into
the stretch.
5. Release the stretch and lower your head back to the ﬂoor.
6. Repeat this stretch two to three times.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
 Do keep your shoulder blades anchored to the ﬂoor and only lift your head.
 Don’t put too much pressure on your neck with your hands; they should only nudge
your head forward.
 Don’t hold your breath.
Standing hamstring stretch with chair
You feel this stretch in the back of your thighs, which are commonly called your hamstrings.
This area is tight for a lot of people, so if you’re one of these folks, take your time and really
relax into the stretch. Go grab a sturdy chair for this exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet about hip-width apart and your hands on the seat of the sturdy
chair in front of you.
2. Inhale deeply, and hinge from the hips, lowering your upper body toward the chair
(see Figure 8-6a).
3. Inhale again and as you exhale, try to lower your body even more by bending your
elbows (see Figure 8-6b).
As you become more ﬂexible, try to lower your elbows to the seat of the chair.
4. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.
You feel a deeper stretch behind your thighs and in the back of your knees if you keep
your back ﬂat and tilt your pelvis toward the ceiling.
5. Bend your knees and roll your upper body up to a standing position.

Chapter 8: Total-Body Stretch Routines

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do remember to take several deep breaths during the 30 seconds.
 Do keep your knees straight.
 Don’t round your back.
 Don’t tuck your hips under.
Standing inner thigh stretch with chair
Although you can stretch your inner thigh area in many different ways, this stretch is proba-
bly the easiest way to stretch your groin area without tensing your neck, shoulders, and back.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand next to a chair.
2. Raise your leg that’s closest to the chair and place your foot on the seat of the chair.
Make sure to keep your hips and shoulders facing forward, as shown in Figure 8-7a.
3. Exhale slowly as you bend forward and lower your hands toward the ﬂoor.
Check out Figure 8-7b for the visualization of this stretch. Let gravity do the work for
you. If you feel too much strain, place one hand on the seat of the chair to give you a
little more control over the stretch.
4. Gradually deepen the stretch with every exhale as you hold this stretch for 30 seconds.
Shake your head “no” to make sure that you aren’t holding tension in your neck.
5. Roll up slowly and repeat the stretch with your other leg.
Never bounce or force the stretch. This actually can cause the muscles to tighten rather
than relax and lengthen.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do tilt your pelvis back so you feel the stretch a little deeper in your groin.
 Do keep your arms and shoulders relaxed and just let gravity gently deepen the
stretch.
 Do keep your standing leg straight.
 Don’t rush!
Standing quad stretch with support
The front of your thigh is made up of four muscles known as the quadriceps. You probably
know them as the “quads.” To stretch these muscles, which are important for climbing
stairs and lifting heavy things, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with your right hand on a sturdy chair or wall.
2. Bend your left knee and raise your heel toward your buttocks.
3. Reach with your left hand and grab hold of your heel (see Figure 8-8a).
4. Inhale deeply and as you exhale, slowly lower your bent knee until it is even or side
by side with your other knee (see Figure 8-8b).
Try to keep the inside of your thighs touching and focus on moving your knee back,
not forcing your foot to touch your buttocks. To really feel this stretch correctly, try to
tuck your pelvis under and think about your tailbone moving toward the ﬂoor.
5. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or about four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
6. Repeat the same stretch on your right leg.
To make this stretch more challenging, let go of the chair or wall and you’ll be improving
your balance while you stretch your quads.

Chapter 8: Total-Body Stretch Routines

A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do stand up tall with good posture.
 Do keep your standing knee slightly bent
 Don’t compress your knee by pulling your heel to your buttock.
 Don’t pull your heel to the outside of your hip.
Standing chest stretch
This simple chest stretch can be done anywhere and should be done several times a day,
especially if you ﬁnd yourself sitting a lot. It helps keep your chest muscles from tightening
up and can prevent that hunched-over look.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall and clasp your hands together by your buttocks and behind your back
(see Figure 8-9a).
If you have difﬁculty getting your hands together behind your back, try holding the end
of a small towel in each hand.
2. Take a deep breath and as you exhale, gently straighten your arms and lift your
hands up toward the ceiling and away from your back (see Figure 8-9b).
Lift as high as you can while still standing tall. Be sure not to bend over.
3. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.

 Do keep your knees slightly bent.
 Don’t tense or lift your shoulders.
 Don’t hold your breath.
When You Just Can’t Get Enough: 
Ten More Minutes of Stretching
When you get comfortable with the stretches in the previous sections and you have a little
more time, try adding on a few more stretches from this section to make a comprehensive
20-minute routine.
Seated buttocks and hip stretch
This stretch can be done in different positions, but I think it’s best that you sit for this
stretch. It’s the most comfortable way to stretch this area and the easiest position to get
into if your muscles are very tight.
This stretch is a good one to try if you have sciatic pain. I talk more about sciatic pain in
Chapter 6 and 7.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on a chair with one leg crossed over the other and let your ankle rest on your
thigh.
2. Place your elbow on the inside of your knee and inhale.
3. As you exhale, lean forward, lengthen your spine, and tilt your pelvis back (see
Figure 8-10).
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, gradually deepening the stretch on every exhale.
5. Repeat the stretch on the other side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulder blades down.
 Do keep your chest lifted.
 Do be patient and let the stretch deepen with each breath.
 Don’t lift one hip or lean to one side.
 Don’t bounce or jerk.
125
Chapter 8: Total-Body Stretch Routines

Seated foot and ankle stretches
These next three stretches are for the muscles that surround your ankle and foot.
It’s not a bad idea to do ankle circles in both directions several times during the day (see
Chapter 7 for an ankle circle exercise). Whether you sit all day or stand all day, this stretch
brings better circulation and warmth to your ankles and feet and keeps this area ﬂexible. If
the muscles around your ankles are inﬂexible, you’re at a higher risk of injuring your ankle.
To do these stretches, follow these steps:
1. Sit up very tall in a chair with your left leg crossed over your right knee and your
ankle resting on your thigh.
2. Hold on to the top of your foot with your right hand and your ankle with your
left hand.
3. Gently pull back on your foot (kind of like pointing your toes).
See Figure 8-11a. You should feel the stretch in the top of your foot.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then release.
5. Now, grab your toes with your left hand and your heel with your right hand and
gradually pull your toes back toward your shin.
See Figure 8-11b. You should feel this stretch in the bottom of your foot.
6. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and then release.
7. Grab your ankle with your left hand and reach your right hand underneath your
foot and grab hold of the top of your foot.

8. Gently pull your foot toward the ceiling, and turn it as if you were looking for some-
thing on the bottom of your foot.
See Figure 8-11c. You should feel the stretch on the outside of your ankle.
9. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then release.
10. Repeat the same stretches on your right foot and ankle.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your chest lifted and your spine very tall.
 Do relax and breathe.
 Don’t lift one hip or lean to one side.
 Don’t force or pulse the stretches.
Seated triceps stretch with side reach
You feel this stretch in the back of your upper arms and mid-back too. To do this stretch,
follow these steps:
1. Sit up very tall with your right arm overhead and elbow bent behind you so the tips
of your ﬁngers are touching the back of your shoulder.
2. Place your left hand on your raised elbow (see Figure 8-12a).
3. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale begin to gently pull your right elbow
behind your head, reaching your right ﬁngers down your back toward your spine
(see Figure 8-12b).
4. Take another deep breath in and as you exhale, lean to the left as far as feels com-
fortable, being careful not to twist.
5. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and then come back to center and gently
release your arm.
6. Give your arms a little shake and repeat the stretch with the left arm.

Chapter 8: Total-Body Stretch Routines

A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do sit up tall with good posture.
 Do keep your shoulders facing the front.
 Don’t tense or lift your shoulders.
 Don’t hold your breath.
 Don’t arch your back or open your rib cage.
 Don’t jam or force your elbow back.
Seated lateral shoulder stretch
This stretch is for the middle part of your deltoid muscle. If you’re wondering if you even
have a deltoid, the answer is yes — it’s the muscle that runs across the front, middle, and
back of your shoulder.
To do this stretch, shown in Figure 8-13, follow the steps below:
1. Sit up very tall and raise your right elbow to shoulder height and place your right
hand on your left shoulder.
2. Place your left hand on your right elbow and as you exhale, gently pull your elbow
toward your left shoulder.
3. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and then repeat the steps with your left arm.
If you want to try a slightly different version of the same stretch, try keeping your arm
straight, rather than bending at the elbow, as you reach across your body.

 Do keep your shoulder blade down.
 Don’t twist at the waist.
 Don’t tense or lift your shoulders.
 Don’t hold your breath.
 Don’t jam or force your elbow back.
Seated forward bend
You should feel this stretch along your spine and throughout your entire back. By hinging at
your hips, you release any tension in your back muscles and help stretch out the vertebrae
in your spine.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on a chair with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and your tummy pulled in or abdomi-
nals tight (see Figure 8-14a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, bend forward at the hips as far as you can comfortably
stretch, letting your arms hang down toward the ground (see Figure 8-14b).
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
4. Slowly roll back up, stacking one vertebra on top of the other until you’re sitting
up tall.

Chapter 8: Total-Body Stretch Routines

A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do start the motion from your hips, not from your back.
 Do start the stretch in the comfort zone, gradually getting deeper with each breath.
 Don’t hold your breath.
 Don’t force the stretch.
 Don’t hold tension in your shoulders.
Standing wrist stretch
This stretch increases and maintains ﬂexibility in your wrists and forearms. To do this
stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart.
2. Hold your arms straight and lift them slightly out in front of your body, your hands
at about the level of your hips, palms facing each other (see Figure 8-15a).
3. As you exhale, rotate your thumbs downward as if you were turning two knob han-
dles (see Figure 8-15b).
4. Continue rotating as far as you can for about 30 seconds.
It may be more comfortable for you to hold this stretch for a few seconds and then repeat
several times instead of just holding for the full 30 seconds.

 Don’t tense or lift your shoulders.
 Don’t hold your breath.
 Don’t lock your elbows.
Standing forearm stretch
This stretch helps combat the discomfort caused by repetitive stress injuries like carpal
tunnel syndrome. You should feel this stretch throughout your forearms and wrists.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with the palm of one hand against the ﬁngers of the other hand.
Keep your elbows lifted toward the ceiling.
2. Inhale and as you exhale gently press the heel of your hand against your ﬁngers
(see Figure 8-16).
3. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.
4. Repeat on the other hand.

If this stretch is more comfortable to hold for a few seconds and then repeat several times
instead of just holding for the full 30 seconds, that’s okay. Do what makes you comfortable.
Stretching shouldn’t be painful!
A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do stand up tall with good posture.
 Don’t tense or lift your shoulders.
 Don’t hold your breath.
 Don’t let your elbows drop.
Standing side reach
Finishing this routine with a good side reach gets you geared up for more complex, inte-
grated stretches that you do later on. You feel this stretch in your shoulder, back, abs, and
even the top part of your hip.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up very tall with your feet apart and toes forward.
2. Reach your left arm directly overhead, using the muscles in your upper back to
keep your shoulder blade down.

Part II: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: Targeting Speciﬁc Areas 

3. Inhale and as you exhale, bend to the right and reach with your left arm up and out
and away from your body.
Make sure to keep your hips and legs anchored to the ﬂoor. Rest your right hand on
your right thigh for extra support (see Figure 8-17).
4. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
5. Repeat the stretch on your other side.
If you notice tension in your shoulders, just keep your elbow bent instead of reaching with a
straight arm.
A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do bend only to the side — no twisting or arching your back.
 Do keep your shoulder blades down.
 Do open up your chest, keeping your shoulders and hips facing forward.
 Do breathe through the stretch.
 Don’t hold the stretch if you feel tension or pain.
 Don’t arch your back or bend forward.
 Don’t twist.
 Don’t lift your opposite heel; keep both feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.

From the Daily Grind to
Ways to Unwind: Routines 
to Fit Your Life and Needs

In this part . . .
I
give you specific stretches for specific situations.
For instance, in Chapter 9, you find three routines for
three different times of the day. For the morning, I recom-
mend my AM routine. For the afternoon, I clue you in to
some wonderful stretches that can be a great alternative
to a cup of coffee. And finally the chapter ends with a
quiet and calming PM routine to help you unwind and
relax after a busy and hectic day (and help you get some
sleep, I hope!). 
In Chapter 10, you discover stretch routines to help you
make it through your workday. If you’ve been cooped up
on an airplane, trapped in a car, or chained to your desk,
this chapter is for you. These stretches help get you up
and out of your seat to aid circulation and prevent muscle
tension. If for some reason you need to remain seated all
day (for instance, you have a stickler for a boss), I provide
a routine that you can do in your chair.  
Chapter 11 features routines for warming up and cooling
down. And finally, Chapter 12 is geared for the weekend
warrior, featuring specific stretches for specific sports to
help improve your performance and enhance your range
of motion.

When the Cock Crows and the Evening
Wind Blows: AM/PM Stretch Routines
In This Chapter
 Practicing morning moves to start your day off right
 Getting your afternoon energy boost
 Incorporating a bedtime routine to release tension from the day
I
t’s true that stretching ﬁrst thing in the morning can wake you up and get you energized,
while stretching at the end of the day helps you relax and wind down. And there are 
speciﬁc stretches that I recommend in this chapter for the morning and for the evening.
However, the key ingredient in making any stretching program work is its intention.
Stretching in the morning gives you time to feel your body waking up and to focus on your
day; stretching in the evening allows you to concentrate on yourself and gently work out
your tensions from the day. In both instances, stretching is a tool that allows you to take
care of yourself in the way you need most — at that moment.
Nothing is going to make you younger, but stretching deﬁnitely makes you feel younger!
The best way to get that youthful feeling is to stretch every day. Ideally you should be able
to ﬁnd structured time for your ﬂexibility training, such as stretching after your workout or
taking yoga or stretching classes regularly. But that’s not always possible, so on days when
life gets in the way, you have to grab a moment for yourself here and there. First thing in the
morning or the last thing at night are perfect times to steal a little interlude for yourself.
Remember, it’s the little things in life that matter, and doing a little something every day
goes a long way toward keeping your body ﬂexible, pain free, and feeling young.
In this chapter, you get a terriﬁc series of stretches to help release any built-up tension in
your lower back muscles and loosen up your upper body. I also give you a series of energizing
stretches to help get you going right around midday when everyone can use a pick-me-up
(and I’m not talking coffee, either!).
A Good Excuse to Stay in Bed: 
Stretches to Start the Day
I’m not promising if you do these next few stretches every day before you get out of bed
that you’ll bounce out of bed like my 4-year-old Bella does every morning (yikes!), but I do
promise you less morning stiffness and that your blood will actually be pumping before you
have that ﬁrst cup of coffee.
Most of the stretches in the AM routine are to be done before you get out of bed. The goal of
these stretches is to loosen up your joints and get your muscles lengthened after moving so
little for so long while sleeping. Make sure to keep your copy of this book on your nightstand
(or under your pillow)!

Supine alternating knee to chest
This exercise is designed to help you slowly begin to stretch your lower back and ham-
strings while loosening the muscles around your hips.
First thing in the morning your joints are stiff and your muscles are tight, so make sure that
you do this stretch gently and progressively, rhythmically and slowly. The last thing you
want to do as soon as you wake up is tear your muscle ﬁbers and cause aches and pains.
Doing this exercise ﬁrst with both knees bent allows a little more time for your back to
warm up properly.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the bed.
2. Inhale deeply and as you exhale, lift your left knee toward your chest, using your
hands for guidance (see Figure 9-1).
Don’t hold the top of your kneecap. This can cause pressure on your knee joint.
Instead, place your hands under your knee as you guide your knee forward.
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths and then release.
4. Lower your leg back to the beginning position and repeat on your right leg.
5. Alternate left and right legs for eight to ten repetitions and then extend both legs
straight.
6. Keeping your left leg straight, bring your right knee toward your chest, using your
hands for guidance (see Figure 9-2).
Try to bring your knee a little closer to your chest than when you had both knees bent
at the beginning of this stretch. Remember not to hold the top of your kneecap.
Instead, place your hands under your knee as you guide your knee forward.
7. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
8. Lower your knee back to the extended position and repeat on your left leg.
9. Repeat this exercise for eight to ten repetitions.

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

 Do exhale as you bring your knee forward.
 Do keep your neck and shoulders relaxed.
 Don’t bring your knee so far forward that it causes your hips to lift off your bed.
 Don’t hold the top of your kneecap.
Both knees to chest
This stretch is my all-time favorite for my lower back. The movements are gentle and
simple, so I think it’s the perfect way to wake up my lower back. I hope you think so, too!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the bed.
2. Bring both knees toward your chest, placing your hands under each knee for support.
Breathe deeply. See Figure 9-3 for placement of your knees and hands. Everyone has
different body types. To make this stretch comfortable, you may have to adjust where
you put your knees. Some people will be more comfortable with their knees wide; some
people might feel the stretch more with their knees closer to their chest. Move your
knees around a little to ﬁnd the spot that’s most comfortable for you and allows you to
breathe easily.
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.

Chapter 9: When the Cock Crows and the Evening Wind Blows: AM/PM Stretch Routines

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do breath slowly and rhythmically.
 Do keep your hands under your knees to prevent any undue pressure on your knees.
 Don’t lift your hips off the bed; try to maintain neutral spine.
If your lower back is fairly ﬂexible, deepen the stretch by clasping your hands together in
front of your shins (see Figure 9-4).
Spinal rotation with bent knees
This exercise lengthens and stretches the muscles of your back and abdominals. Use a pillow
to soften the stretch for the morning. This stretch is great to get you ready for your day!
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the bed.
2. Bring both knees toward your chest, placing your hands under each knee for support.
3. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, release your hands from your knees and
slowly lower your legs to one side.
4. Extend the arm on the opposite side straight out to your side (see Figure 9-5).
5. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, taking several deep breaths as you relax into the
stretch.
6. Slowly lift your knees back to center and repeat the same stretch on the other side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your knees at a right angle.
 Do keep your shoulders down and relaxed.
 Don’t hold your breath.

Total body stretch
When you wake up in the morning, do you stretch your body either before you get up or
after you stand up? Sometimes, nothing feels better than stretching out those sleepy mus-
cles! This stretch may be common sense, but most people need a good reminder of how to
stretch the whole body correctly and most effectively. Note: Breathing is key.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your arms extended over your head.
2. Inhale deeply and stretch your arms and your legs as far as you can in opposite
directions (see Figure 9-6).
3. As you exhale, release the stretch and relax your whole body.
4. Repeat this exercise three or four times, each time trying to reach and stretch a
little farther.
Pull your bellybutton toward your spine as you stretch and lengthen.
5. After a few repetitions, try reaching one side at a time.
As you inhale, reach and stretch your right side only. Exhale and relax; repeat on your
left side.

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do point your toes and lengthen your legs as you reach.
 Don’t arch your back.
 Don’t hold your breath.
A Midafternoon Pick-Me-Up
There’s no getting around the fact that three in the afternoon is a low point in most people’s
day. You’re running out of energy and ﬁghting off sleep. So the next time you feel like taking
a siesta or making an afternoon run for an emergency cappuccino, try an energizing stretch
instead!
Overhead forward arm swings
A very important part of overall ﬁtness is being able to maintain your balance. Not only will
this rhythmic full-body stretch wake you up, energize you, and lengthen your spine, but also
it can help improve your balance, which means less accidents throughout the day when
you’re climbing stairs or carrying groceries or your kids.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your feet together and your arms to your sides.
2. Inhale and reach your arms overhead, while raising your heels off the ﬂoor so you
balance on the balls of your feet (see Figure 9-7a).
Hold the pose for a count of three as you maintain your balance.
3. As you exhale, let your arms swing down as you bend your knees and shift your
weight to your heels (see Figure 9-7b).
4. Use the momentum of your arms to swing your arms back up overhead and balance
again.
If you’re having trouble balancing at the top of this exercise, check to make sure that
your abdominals are pulled in and your shoulders are pressed down.
5. Exhale and lower again.
6. Repeat this exercise ﬁve times.
On the last one, hold the balance for as long as you can.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your abdominals lifted.
 Do keep your shoulder blades down, especially when you raise your arms overhead.
 Do think of your spine getting longer each time you reach up.
 Don’t let your belly stick out or compress your lower back.
 Don’t hold your arms up behind your shoulders.

Standing spinal twist with overhead reach
This stretch gets circulation back into your spine, especially if you’ve been inactive for a
while. It’s the perfect stretch to get you moving again.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your feet apart, your abs and chest lifted, your shoulders back and
down, and your arms to your sides (see Figure 9-8a).
Keep your feet wide and your knees bent. This position keeps your center of gravity
low and makes it easier to keep your upper body relaxed.
2. Inhale and as you exhale, bend your knees and pivot on your left big toe, turning
your hips and shoulders to the right as you reach your left arm overhead (see
Figure 9-8b).
3. Repeat on the left side (see Figure 9-8c).
4. Repeat the stretch for 16 to 20 repetitions, keeping your movement controlled and
relaxed.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your knees bent at all times.
 Do keep your abdominals lifted.
 Do turn your hips all the way to the side.
 Don’t force or jerk the movement — it should ﬂow from side to side.
 Don’t lock your knees.

Lengthening back extension
The purpose of this stretch is to bring circulation to the muscles along your spine. 
If you have poor posture, or you’ve been sitting for an extended period of time, you 
probably have been rounding your back and slouching, which zaps your body of energy.
This stretch straightens and lengthens your spine, which is great for improving mobility of
your back.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your belly with your palms on the ﬂoor next to your chest with your elbows
bent and your legs straight and together.
Make sure to keep your neck in line with the rest of your spine (see Figure 9-9a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, lengthen your spine, lift your chest, and begin to
straighten your elbows as you push up with your arms (see Figure 9-9b).
Keep your elbows close to your sides and squeeze your buttocks tightly to prevent
undo compression of your spine. Imagine the space between each vertebra increasing,
lengthening your spine.
3. Hold the stretch for a few seconds (or as long as it’s comfortable) and then slowly
lower your body down to the starting position.
4. Repeat two or three more times.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your neck long and in line with the rest of your spine.
 Do keep your shoulder blades down.
 Do pull your belly in toward your spine.
 Do squeeze your buttocks tightly to prevent pressure in your lower back.
 Don’t compress your lower back.

Winding Down before Heading for Dreamland
If you have a difﬁcult time unwinding before bed (and who doesn’t?), a few stretches may be
just the thing for you. Try these next few stretches after you’re ready for bed.
Standing calf stretch
This stretch is great for anyone who has to stand for extended periods of time at work
during the day. Stretching your calf muscles before bed helps prevent leg cramps that can
happen during the night.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Face your bed, and stand an inch or two away from your bed with your feet together.
2. Bend forward and place your hands directly in front of you on your bed.

3. Move your left foot back (about the distance of shoulder-width apart), keeping your
foot as ﬂat as possible on the ﬂoor.
4. Bend the right knee slightly, but keep the left knee straight.
Try to keep your toes pointing directly forward in line with your heel. The more you
turn your toes outward, the less effective the stretch for your calf will be.
5. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently press your hips forward, keeping
your left heel on the ground (see Figure 9-10).
6. Hold the stretch for several deep breaths.
7. Slightly bend your left knee without lifting your heel off the ﬂoor.
By bending your knee you stretch an additional muscle in your calf, which is important
for ankle ﬂexibility.
8. Repeat this stretch on your right leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your toes and heel in line.
 Do keep your heel on the ﬂoor.
 Do breathe deeply and rhythmically throughout the stretch.
 Don’t round your back. Try to keep your back straight and press your hips forward.
Lying hip opener
Now it’s time to get in bed. This stretch opens up your hips, which is great for a better
night’s sleep because your tight groin muscles loosen up.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and the soles of your feet touching each
other (see Figure 9-11).
Make sure that your feet are at a comfortable distance from your hips. If your back is
arching, your feet are probably too close to your hips.
2. Inhale deeply and as you exhale, relax your legs and let gravity gently pull your
knees toward the bed.
Everybody is different, and your knees may not move too close to the bed. As long as
you feel a gentle stretch along the inner thighs, and no pain in your lower back, you’re
doing ﬁne.
3. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do remember to take several deep breaths during the 30 seconds.
 Don’t bounce your knees downward or try to force your knees toward the bed.
 Don’t arch your back.

Massaging your dogs when they start barkin’
Very few things in life are more relaxing then a foot mas-
sage. Unfortunately, you may not have a licensed
masseuse at your beck and call, so you have to take
things into your own hands.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Sit comfortably on the side of your bed and wiggle
your toes and circle your ankles a few times.
This action increases circulation and helps relax the
muscles of your ankles and feet.
2. Place your right ankle on your left thigh.
3. Place your thumbs on the pads of your toes and
make circular motions, using medium pressure.
4. After circling a few times on each toe, move down
to the root or base of your toes, continually apply-
ing medium pressure with each circular motion.
5. Continue the circular motion across the width of the
ball of your foot.
6. Move down in a zigzag pattern across the entire
length of your foot.
Try to massage every spot of the sole of your foot,
from your toes to your heel.
7. End by gently stroking the sole of your foot from top
to bottom.
8. Repeat the massage on your left foot.
You may need to use a little more pressure around your
heel and ankle. If your feet need a little extra attention,
try doing the foot and ankle stretches in Chapter 8.

Lying stretch to take a load 
off neck and shoulders
This stretch focuses on your neck and shoulders and helps relieve any stress you may have
accumulated over the day. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back in your bed with your knees bent and feet ﬂat on your bed.
2. Place your hands on the back of your head and point your elbows toward the ceiling.
3. Exhale and slowly lift your head while keeping your shoulder blades on your bed
(see Figure 9-12).
You should feel this stretch in the back of your neck and shoulders.
4. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and then release by slowly lowering your head back
to your pillow.
5. Repeat this stretch a few times or whatever feels most comfortable to you.
Never bounce or force this stretch. Be careful not to jam your chin into your chest, which
could cause you to overstretch your neck muscles.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do hold your hands at the base of your head and top of your neck.
 Do keep your body relaxed and your shoulders down.
 Don’t lift your shoulder blades off the bed.
 Don’t hold your breath!
Lying buttocks and hip stretch with legs crossed
This stretch is really good to do if you’ve been sitting all day and feel tight in your lower
body and legs. I also love this stretch for stretching out the lower back by bringing in your
knees toward your chest.
Figure 9-12:

der stretch.
148
Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back in your bed with your knees bent and feet ﬂat on your bed.
2. Lift your left foot and place the outside of your left ankle on your right thigh, just
above your knee.
3. Raise your right foot off the bed and bring your knee toward your chest (see
Figure 9-13a).
4. Interlock your ﬁngers behind your knee.
5. Inhale and as you exhale, gently pull your right knee closer to your chest with your
hands.
6. With your left elbow, gently press your left knee away from you (see Figure 9-13b).
7. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, gradually deepening the stretch with every exhale.
8. Repeat the stretch with your right foot on your left thigh.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulder blades down and your upper body relaxed.
 Do be patient and let the stretch deepen with each breath.
 Don’t lift your hips off the bed or lean to one side.

Chapter 10
Stretching Out the Workday: 
Stretches for Work and for the Road
In This Chapter
 Stretching as part of your work and travel day
 Performing stretches while sitting at your desk
 Stretching on the move
Your bodies weren’t designed to sit for hours at a time. Do you think the cave men
would’ve survived if they had sat still all day? No, they would’ve been a buffet lunch
for some hungry T-Rex. But nowadays, no one has to run from giant carnivores every day.
As a matter of fact, in the last 50 years, our lifestyles have changed so dramatically that
we’ve developed an entirely new set of problems because of it: stress headaches, low back
pain, muscular tightness and imbalance, repetitive stress injuries, such as carpal tunnel syn-
drome, and the special selection of aches and pains brought on by the ordeal of modern
travel.
This chapter is composed of two sections — one that shows you exercises to do away from
your desk (or conﬁned space) to combat the constricting effects of sitting for long periods
of time and another series of stretches for when you must stay sitting. Either way, these
exercises go a long way toward helping your work and travel lives evolve into healthier,
more comfortable forms of existence.
Get Off Your Buttocks!
Whether you’re a student, a traveler, a computer jockey, or couch potato, there comes a
time when you tend to sit for way too long. Sitting too long on a regular basis can, over time,
shorten your hip ﬂexors and the muscles in your hamstrings, chest, and back, resulting in
uncomfortable muscle tension.
Experts recommend getting up out of your chair a couple of times an hour, or more speciﬁ-
cally, taking 3- to 5-minute breaks every 20 to 40 minutes. Whenever you get up from your
desk at work, or if you get a chance to stretch your legs during a plane ﬂight, choose from
the following selections of stretching exercises to help lengthen your muscles, reduce stress
and tension, and get your blood pumping again — and in turn, sitting still will feel a lot less
like hard work.

Standing chest stretch
This simple chest stretch should be done several times a day, especially if you ﬁnd yourself
sitting a lot. The stretch can actually be done anywhere, and it helps keep your chest mus-
cles from tightening and shortening, which prevents that hunched-over look.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall and clasp your hands together behind your back just above your tail-
bone (see Figure 10-1a).
If you have difﬁculty getting your hands together behind your back, try holding the end
of a small towel in each hand.
2. Take a deep breath and as you exhale, keep your arms straight and gently lift your
hands toward the ceiling away from your back (see Figure 10-1b).
Lift your arms as high as you can while standing straight and avoiding bending forward.
3. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.
A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do stand up tall with good posture.
 Do keep your knees slightly bent.
 Don’t tense or lift your shoulders.

Standing abdominal stretch
After sitting for an extended period of time, the muscles in your abdomen and chest can
become shortened and your back rounded. To counterbalance these effects, this stretches
your chest and abdomen in the exact opposite direction, and it feels great!
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent.
2. Place your hands on the lowest part of your back, right where your buttocks meets
your lower back, with your ﬁngers pointed downward (see Figure 10-2a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, squeeze your buttocks (to prevent compression in your
lower back), lean back, and slightly push your hips forward (see Figure 10-2b).
4. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and then come back to upright position.
5. Perform this exercise twice.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do squeeze your shoulder blades together as you lean back.
 Do lift your chin so your neck stays in line with the rest of your spine.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch, which puts stress on your lower back.

Chapter 10: Stretching Out the Workday: Stretches for Work and for the Road

Standing side reach with legs crossed
After sitting for a long time, your sides get all scrunched together, so nothing can feel better
than a good side reach. Feel this stretch along your rib cage and shoulders as you bring
oxygen to your entire body.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your arms at your sides.
2. Cross your left leg over your right leg, keeping both feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor (see
Figure 10-3a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, lean to the left and reach your left arm toward the ﬂoor
(see Figure 10-3b).
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then come back to starting position.
5. Cross your right leg over your left leg, keeping both feet on the ﬂoor and repeat the
stretch leaning to the right.
If you ﬁnd it uncomfortable or awkward to cross your legs, try moving your front leg forward
an inch or two. If it’s still awkward, or you have trouble balancing, simply perform this stretch
with your legs uncrossed and your feet together.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your hips facing forward.
 Do keep your arms to your sides.
 Don’t bounce or twist.
 Don’t hold your breath, but instead breathe regularly.

Standing hamstring and calf stretch
Two areas that can get tight after sitting for a long time are the back of your thighs and your
calves. This one stretch can get both areas at the same time. To perform this exercise, follow
these steps:
1. Stand tall with both feet together and your arms at your sides.
2. Step out with your left leg, keeping your back heel on the ﬂoor and your front toes
pointing toward the ceiling.
3. Bend your right knee slightly and inhale.
4. As you exhale, hinge at your hips and tilt your pelvis back, placing both your hands
just above your bent knee (see Figure 10-4).
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and make sure to keep your spine lengthened, your
chest lifted, and your tailbone reaching toward the wall behind you.
6. Repeat the stretch on the other side.
If you’re not feeling the stretch in your calf, try to ﬂex your foot more (lift your toes more
toward the ceiling). If you’re not feeling the stretch in your hamstrings, try tilting your
pelvis back farther and lengthening your back more if you can.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do breathe slowly and rhythmically.
 Do keep most of your weight on your bent leg.
 Don’t round your back or drop your chest too far toward your bent leg.

Standing hip flexor stretch
This stretch targets your hip ﬂexors with pinpoint accuracy and, as an added bonus, can
even tone your thighs and buttocks! To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Start in a forward lunge position with both knees bent and your arms at your sides.
Make sure your feet are far enough apart so when you bend your knees your front knee
doesn’t jut forward past your toes.
2. Inhale and as you exhale, squeeze your buttocks and tilt your pelvis under so your
hipbones point upward and your tailbone points downward (see Figure 10-5).
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then sink your hips down toward the ﬂoor to
lower your body another inch or two.
4. Hold this lowered position for another 30 seconds, breathing comfortably and 
normally.
5. Release the stretch and bring your feet together.
6. Repeat the stretch on your other leg.
If you have trouble keeping your balance, move your back leg out to the side an inch or two.
This adjustment gives you a wider base of support. Make sure your abdominals are tight
and pulled in.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your buttocks squeezed and your pelvis tucked under.
 Do keep your toes pointed forward.
 Do stabilize your spine by keeping your back straight and your abdominals lifted.
 Don’t bend your knees more than 90 degrees or let your front knee jut forward.
These positions place stress on your knees.

Stretches for the Professional Desk Jockey
This section gives you a few stretches to do when you can’t get away from your desk. Doing
these stretches several times during the day can help energize you and keep those aches
and pains away.
Shoulders and neck stretch with circles
This stretch is designed to release the tension that can build up in your neck and shoulders
after sitting with poor posture for too long. The shoulder circles relax your shoulders and
get you sitting up tall again, while the neck stretch lengthens and relaxes the muscles in
your neck. This stretch is a great if you’re prone to rounded shoulders.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Sit tall in your chair with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor, your abdominals lifted, and
your hands at your sides.
2. Slowly rotate your shoulders forward, up, back, and down as if you were drawing a
circle with your shoulders (see Figure 10-6a).
Breathe deeply as you repeat this motion four to six times.
3. At the end of the last repetition, hold your shoulders down and back.
4. Tilt your head to the left, moving your left ear toward your left shoulder.
Make sure you keep your right shoulder down (see Figure 10-6b).
5. Slowly roll your head toward your chest, drawing a half circle with your chin.
Continue the motion until you tilt your head all the way across toward the right shoul-
der. Bring your head back to the upright position and relax.
6. Repeat on the other side.

Chapter 10: Stretching Out the Workday: Stretches for Work and for the Road

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your posture tall and abdominals lifted.
 Do keep your shoulder blades down as you perform the shoulder circles.
 Don’t raise one shoulder while you’re performing the neck stretch. Make sure to keep
both of your shoulders level at all times.
Chest stretch
If you sit for a long time, this stretch is one of the most effective ones to counteract the
rounded shoulders and rounded back that can form over time (when you hover over that
keyboard).
Your chest muscles tend to tighten with bad posture, which can pull your shoulders for-
ward even more. This stretch helps stretch out those worn-out muscles and get you sitting
tall again. To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Sit tall with both your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and your back ﬂat against the back of
your chair.
2. Clasp your hands together behind your head (see Figure 10-7a) and inhale.
3. As you exhale, gently press your elbows back, squeeze your shoulder blades
together, and lift your chin and chest toward the ceiling (see Figure 10-7b).
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then release back to starting position.
5. Repeat this stretch several times each hour of sitting still or at least a few times a day.

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do breathe slowly and rhythmically.
 Do keep your chest lifted and your abdominals tight.
 Don’t compress or arch your lower back.
Seated spinal rotation
Have you ever been so focused on what you’re working on at your desk that you forget there
is a world going on around you? Well, this stretch not only relieves tension in your hips and
back, but also it’s a good excuse to look up and see what’s going on in the outside world.
To do this stretch follow these steps:
1. Sit up tall in a chair with your left leg crossed over your right, your abdominals
lifted, and your shoulders down (see Figure 10-8a).
If it’s uncomfortable to cross your legs, do this stretch with both feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
2. Cross your right arm over your body so your forearm rests on your left thigh, and
place your left hand on the back of the seat of your chair.
3. Inhale and as you exhale, twist at your waist and look back over your left shoulder.
Look over your shoulder as if you were trying to look behind you (see Figure 10-8b).
Remember to keep your shoulders down and your gaze level.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, gently pressing your right forearm against your left
leg as you deepen the stretch.
5. Release the stretch and repeat on the other side by crossing your right leg over your
left and twisting to the right.

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do sit up tall — no slouching.
 Do keep your hips facing forward.
 Don’t tense up your shoulders and neck.
Seated forward bend
You should feel this stretch along the back of your legs or hamstrings. By hinging at your
hips and using the weight of your upper body, you also get a good stretch in your lower
back. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on a chair with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and your abdominals tight (see
Figure 10-9a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, bend forward at the hips as far as you can comfortably
stretch, letting your arms and head hang down toward the ground (see Figure 10-9b).
3. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
4. Slowly roll back up, stacking one vertebra on top of the other until you’re sitting
up tall.
A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do feel this stretch in the back of your legs.
 Do gradually deepen the stretch with each breath.
 Don’t force the stretch.

Wrist and forearm stretch
This stretch can help combat the discomfort caused by repetitive stress injuries like carpal
tunnel syndrome. You should feel this stretch throughout your forearms and wrists.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit up straight in your chair with the palm of one hand touching the ﬁngers of the
other hand.
Point your ﬁngers upward and keep your elbows lifting toward the ceiling (see
Figure 10-10).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, gently press the heel of your hand against your ﬁngers.
3. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and repeat on the other side.
A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do sit up tall with good posture.
 Don’t tense or lift your shoulders.
 Don’t hold your breath.
 Don’t let your elbows drop.

Seated ankle circles
As you get older you naturally lose range of motion in your joints, but particularly in the
ankle joint. Ankle circles help increase range of motion in the joint, and they also make walk-
ing feel much more comfortable. So go ahead take your shoes off.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Sit up tall with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
2. Place your hands under your right knee and clasp them together.
3. Use your hands to lift your knee, lifting your foot a few inches off the ﬂoor.
4. Inhale and as you exhale, circle your ankle eight times inward and then eight times
outward (see Figure 10-11).
5. Repeat this stretch on your other ankle.
Imagine there’s a pencil attached to your big toe and you’re trying to draw the largest circle
you can. Go slow enough so you draw a perfectly round circle.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do sit up tall with your back straight.
 Do support the weight of your leg with your hands.
 Don’t rush the movement.

Stress! How it affects you and your body
Excess stress can lower your immune system, make you
depressed, and make you sick, but according to Pamela
Peeke, MD, MPH, too much stress can also make you fat!
How? Stress activates the “ﬂight-or-ﬁght” response, a
physiological reaction designed to help your body react
decisively in an emergency. When confronted with a per-
ceived threat, your brain commands your adrenal glands
to dump a large amount of the stress hormone cortisol
into your bloodstream. One of the functions of cortisol is
to quickly release energy stored in fat cells. Your mus-
cles use the energy to help avert the emergency. The
problem is that, even after the emergency is over, the
level of cortisol in your bloodstream remains elevated to
help encourage you to restock your stores of fat.
In addition, stressed-out women who carry weight in
their abdominal area secrete signiﬁcantly more cortisol
than women who don’t have excess fat around their
waistline, according to a study from the University of
California at San Francisco. And since abdominal fat
tissue has up to four times the number of receptors for
cortisol as does fat elsewhere in the body, the cells in
this area are the most likely to store fat as a result of cor-
tisol. Unfortunately, this excess tummy doesn’t just spill
over the top of your low-rise jeans; it’s an indicator of
increased risk for stroke and heart disease, two major
killers of women over 50 years old.
What’s the solution? When it comes to reducing stress,
experts consistently point to regular exercise, which can
also help combat cardiovascular disease. And there’s
nothing more effective to help you reduce the muscle
tension brought on by excess stress than a good, invig-
orating stretch.

Basic Warm-Up and Cool-Down 
Stretch Routines
In This Chapter
 Discovering why and how to warm up your body and prepare it for your workout
 Checking out some warm-up routines
 Understand why cooling down is as important as warming up
 Performing some cool-down routines
P
rofessional athletes, Olympic athletes, even college and high-school athletes all warm
up and cool down before they practice or play. And you can take it from me that they
wouldn’t waste their time and effort to do so if it didn’t pay off. In fact, a virtual mountain of
research supports their experience: Warming up and cooling down enhances performance
and reduces injury.
Proper stretching is one of the key components of a good warm-up and cool-down. This chap-
ter takes these two important components and shows you how to get the best warm-up and
cool-down possible for your workout.
Easing into Your Workout
So what exactly happens to your body as you increase your core temperature and prepare
your muscles for exercise (warm-up!)? The following sections shed some light on why warm-
ing up is so important.
The big deal about warming up
In case you’re wondering, here’s what happens to your body when you warm up:
 Bloodﬂow through your muscles increases, which enhances the delivery of oxygen
from your blood, and the speed of your nerve impulses increases. Both of these factors
make your muscles work better.
 Your heart rate increases, which primes your cardiovascular system to handle the
increased load from your workout.
 Your body and tissue temperature gently increase, which helps prevent injury by
slowly increasing your body’s core temperature, which allows your blood pressure to
stay regulated.

 Muscular tension decreases, and your connective tissue has an enhanced ability to
lengthen, which in turn enhances your performance and decreases the likelihood of
injury.
 You slowly and gently ease into the right frame of mind for the exertion of a good work-
out. This mindset prevents you from getting tired out or overdoing it if you start out
exercising too vigorously.
Here’s what may happen if you don’t warm up:
 You may pull a muscle if you start stretching out “cold” and no blood or oxygen is cir-
culating and ﬂowing to the area.
 You may become short of breath or dizzy from your heart rate increasing too quickly.
 You may cause injury to a joint from launching into quick movements without ﬁrst
loosening up the surrounding tissue.
When you try to save ﬁve minutes before you exercise and skip your warm-up, you can pull
a muscle. If that happens, you can’t exercise at all for two weeks while you heal (and limp
around, sleep badly, and generally live with the pain). Five minutes versus two weeks — do
the math. I’m no math major, but even I can see that warming up before you work out makes
more sense than not doing so.
Making stretching a part of your warm-up
Like a good play or movie, a good warm-up has three acts or phases. These three phases are
important because, ﬁrst, they mimic the movements you’ll be doing in a slower, less vigor-
ous fashion to help prevent injury. Second, the dynamic moves allow you to increase your
range of motion. And ﬁnally, the static stretching phase helps you increase muscle length,
which results in increased ﬂexibility.
In this case, the three acts are as follows:
1. The rehearsal phase: In this phase, you should perform moves that mimic what your
workout will be. For example:
• If you’re going jogging, start with a very light trot or walk.
• If you’re going to play tennis, spend a few minutes volleying the ball back and
forth.
• If you’re taking an aerobics class, spend a few minutes doing light choreography.
2. The dynamic stretching phase: This phase refers to general, full-body moves that
aren’t directly related to your intended activity. Such moves should be large range-of-
motion moves, traveling through all three planes of motion. They should be dynamic in
nature, ﬂuid, and rhythmic.
3. The multijoint static stretching phase: After a few minutes of mimicking your workout,
and then going through some integrated, dynamic stretches, your body will be warm
enough to perform a few multimuscle static stretches to introduce length to the mus-
cles and mobility to the joints.
Never start your warm-up with static stretches. Always take a few minutes to perform the
rehearsal moves and the general dynamic stretches before moving into the ﬁnal static
phase.
166
Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

Keep in mind that the goal of stretching in the warm-up isn’t speciﬁcally to increase 
ﬂexibility — it’s to generally warm up the body and introduce the range of motion that the
upcoming workout requires of your muscles. Therefore, don’t hold the stretches in the
warm-up for as long as you do in the cool-down, and never leave your comfort zone.
A Great Routine to Warm Your Body
The moves you perform in the rehearsal phase of your warm-up are up to you and should
closely mimic the moves you make in your sport or workout. After you complete the
rehearsal phase of your warm-up, move into dynamic stretches and then static stretches.
This section gives you some of my favorite dynamic and static stretches for warm-up.
Dynamic stretches for the warm-up
The purpose of dynamic stretches is to warm your muscles and loosen your joints. This sec-
tion provides you with three functional, dynamic stretches to do before any workout.
They add on to the work you accomplish in the rehearsal phase of your warm-up by 
continuing to warm up your entire body, introducing range of motion to your joints, and
lengthening your muscles.
Alternating knee lifts
Alternating knee lifts are meant to not only warm up your entire body but also to give you a
great dynamic stretch in your hips, buttocks, thighs, and lower back.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your feet together and your hands to your side.
2. Inhale and as you exhale, lift your left knee toward your chest (see Figure 11-1a).
3. Grab underneath your knee with both hands to lift your leg a little higher.
Actively use your hands to lift your knee as close to your chest as possible. Lifting your
knee a tiny bit higher stretches your buttocks and hamstrings a lot more.
4. Lower your leg down to starting position and repeat the exercise on your other leg
(see Figure 11-1b).
5. Repeat the stretch for 16 to 20 repetitions.
167
Chapter 11: Basic Warm-Up and Cool-Down Stretch Routines
Practicing your balancing act
For what it’s worth, my personal preference is to include
one or two balance exercises at the end of your warm-
up and cool-down (I include one such exercise at the
end of the warm-up routine). The warm-up can create
internal heat and mental focus. The cool-down can be a
bridge between the workout and slow stretches.
Balance is like everything else — either use it or lose it!

For a simple variation, lift your knees to the side rather than forward. As you become more
advanced, try to raise up on the toes of the foot on the ﬂoor.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do stand up tall and bring your knee to your chest, not your chest to your knee.
 Do exhale every time you lift your knee.
 Do keep your chest lifted and shoulder blades down.
 Don’t grab the top of your kneecap.
 Don’t tilt your pelvis under.
 Don’t yank or forcefully pull on your knee — the movement should be smooth.
Torso twists
This stretch warms up your whole body, as well as stretches your abs, back, and shoulders.
It also prepares your body for any twisting or reaching that many sports and activities
require.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your feet apart, your abs and chest lifted, your shoulders back and
down, and your hands clasped together at chest level (see Figure 11-2a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, bend your knees and pivot on your left big toe, turning
your hips and shoulders to the right (see Figure 11-2b).
Keep your feet wide and your knees bent. This stance keeps your center of gravity low
and makes keeping your upper body relaxed easier.
3. Repeat on the left side (see Figure 11-2c).
4. Repeat the stretch for 16 to 20 repetitions, keeping your arms and shoulders relaxed
so that the momentum of hips moves your elbows behind you.

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your knees bent at all times.
 Do keep your abdominals lifted.
 Don’t force or jerk the movement, because the movement should ﬂow from side
to side.
 Don’t lock your knees or keep your hips facing the front.
The chop
The chop, which is so named because it sort of looks like the move a person makes when
chopping wood, is the king of all functional stretches because it stretches your buttocks,
back, abs, and chest all at the same time. This stretch also prepares your body for any twist-
ing, reaching, or bending you may be doing in your workout.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with your feet hip-width apart and your arms at your sides.
2. Bend your knees and pivot on your left big toe as you lift your left heel.
Your right foot remains on the ground and faces forward (see Figure 11-3a).
3. Twist your hips to the right and reach both of your arms down and behind you.
4. Hold the position for one long, deep breath.
5. Come back to center and continue to turn your hips as you reach both arms over-
head to the left (see Figure 11-3b).
6. Hold this position for one long, deep breath.
You should feel the stretch in your right hip ﬂexor, obliques, and chest.
7. Repeat the stretch from right to left for six to eight repetitions, and as you get
stronger, work your way up to two sets of eight repetitions.
To protect your back and spine, your hips should move with you and not remain forward
throughout the moves.

Chapter 11: Basic Warm-Up and Cool-Down Stretch Routines

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do inhale as you reach up, and exhale as you bring your arm back down.
 Do lengthen your spine throughout the movement.
 Do hold your abdominals tight to protect your back.
 Don’t arch or compress your lower back.
 Don’t let your knees bow in or collapse inward.
 Don’t swing or create too much momentum; keep the movement ﬂuid and under 
control.
Static stretches for the warm-up
The next three exercises are static stretches to introduce the range of motion that your
muscles and joints are doing in the workout.
Remember, the stretches in a warm-up are to just introduce range of motion, not to increase
ﬂexibility. Therefore, you won’t hold these stretches for as long as you would after your
workout.
Standing calf and hip flexor stretch
Stretching the calf and the hip ﬂexor together is valuable because they affect each other. If
your calf is tight, it may limit the movement in your hip ﬂexor. If your hip ﬂexor is tight, then
it may limit your range of motion in your calf.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
a

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

1. Stand tall with your left foot back far enough to still keep your heel on the ground
(see Figure 11-4a).
2. Bend your right knee and reach your left arm overhead as you press your hip for-
ward (see Figure 11-4b).
3. Squeeze your buttocks to feel the stretch a little deeper in your hip ﬂexor and calf.
As you stretch your arm overhead and press your hip forward, you should feel as if
your spine is lengthening, not shortening or compressing.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then repeat on your other leg.
To make this stretch more dynamic, alternate it with the hamstring/back stretch in Figure 11-5
later in the chapter.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do reach up and back, not just back.
 Do work on getting your heel to stay on the ground.
 Don’t arch your back.
 Don’t relax your abdominal muscles — keep your bellybutton toward your spine.
Hamstring and back stretch
You should feel this stretch throughout your entire backside — heel, calf, hamstring, lower
back, and lats. Try not to tighten your shoulders and round your back during this stretch.
Stay in your comfort zone during this stretch. Remember that you’re introducing range of
motion, not trying to increase your overall ﬂexibility.

Chapter 11: Basic Warm-Up and Cool-Down Stretch Routines

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet in a wide stance about hip-width apart.
2. Extend your left leg so your heel on your right leg remains on the ﬂoor and your
toes on the left leg are lifted toward the ceiling.
3. Bend your right knee as you slowly press your hips back (see Figure 11-5a).
4. Reach your right hand toward your left toes or the outside of your left leg (see
Figure 11-5b.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then repeat on the other side.
To make this stretch more dynamic, alternate it with the standing calf and hip ﬂexor stretch
in Figure 11-4.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do tilt your pelvis back.
 Do try to keep your back ﬂat.
 Do keep your foot ﬂexed and your toes pointed up.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.
 Don’t tighten up your shoulders or round your back.
Standing groin and inner thigh stretch
This stretch is for the muscles that run along your inner thigh and also the muscles in your
torso that rotate your spine. This stretch also builds strength in your thighs and creates
heat in your body so your muscles are nice and warm for a productive, pain-free workout.

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet in a wide stance with your toes pointing out.
2. Bend your knees and slowly lean forward until your elbows can rest just inside your
knees (see Figure 11-6a).
3. Gently press your right elbow against the inside of your right knee as you lower
your right shoulder and rotate your spine to the left, looking over your left shoulder
(see Figure 11-6b).
Turning your head stretches your neck muscles at the same time other muscles are
stretching during this exercise.
4. Lower your hips another inch and tilt your pelvis back.
Lowering your hips deepens the stretch in your groin. Think of reaching your tailbone
to the ceiling as you tilt your pelvis back.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds and then repeat the stretch on the other side.
To make this stretch more dynamic, alternate from side to side several times without hold-
ing the stretch.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do press the knee away with your elbow.
 Do tilt your pelvis back.
 Don’t hold your breath.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.

Chapter 11: Basic Warm-Up and Cool-Down Stretch Routines

Standing balance with a twist
Adding a little balance work to your warm-up can raise your internal temperature and
improve your balance. Try this exercise before your next workout.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your feet together and your arms at your side.
2. Shift your weight to your right leg only.
3. Bend your left knee slightly and lift your foot off the ﬂoor so all your weight is on
your right leg (see Figure 11-7a).
4. Inhale and as you exhale, raise your elbows and cross your arms in front of your
chest.
5. Twist to your left, hold for a few seconds, and return back to front position (see
Figure 11-7b).
Don’t attempt the twist until you’re stable on one foot. If you’re wobbly, use a chair or
barre to help with your stability. Don’t be afraid of a little wobble; it’s how you test
your limits and improve your balance.
6. Repeat this exercise three more times and then repeat four repetitions on the
other side.
To make this exercise more challenging, try standing on a bosu — a balance board — while
performing this exercise. You can ﬁnd a bosu at pretty much any sporting goods store.

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do exhale every time you twist.
 Do keep your hips level with each other. If one hip is higher than the other, holding
your balance becomes difﬁcult.
 Do hold your abdominals tight and your shoulder blades down.
 Don’t lift your foot too high — only a couple of inches off the ﬂoor.
Moving Out of Your Exercise Session: 
Why and How to Cool Down
A cool-down refers to a group of moves or stretches performed after exercise and before
rest. This time is perfect to work on increasing ﬂexibility because the temperature of your
muscles and connective tissue is highest, which means that these structures are now at
their most ﬂexible.
The type of stretches most appropriate for the cool-down is static stretches. Static stretches
help relax your muscles by lengthening them. They can also aid in reducing after-exercise
muscle soreness by helping to work lactic acid out of your muscles. In addition, a nice quiet
period of gentle movement and rest can be the perfect ending to a great workout.
Why cool down? During a strenuous workout, your body goes through a number of stressful
processes. Here are a few reasons why a good cool-down is so important:
 To promote recovery and return the body to its state before exercise.
 To prevent damage to the muscle ﬁbers, tendons, and ligaments.
 To prevent the build up of lactic acid and other waste products within your body.
 To reduce soreness by keeping the blood from “pooling” or staying in the muscle.
Instead, the blood gets pushed back to the heart.
Basic Cool-Down Routine
This routine is designed to stretch your body from head to toe after your workout. You can
do this cool-down at the gym or at home, and most of the stretches are done on the ﬂoor, so
grab a mat or ﬁnd a carpeted space to make sure that you’re comfortable.
I suggest that you remove your shoes to make yourself more comfortable before beginning
this cool-down. Drinking water also keeps you from getting dehydrated and replaces the lost
ﬂuids from your sweat during your workout. Aim for 8 to 16 ounces of water to help you
recover and reduce muscle soreness. Also have a towel or strap handy for some of these
stretches.
175
Chapter 11: Basic Warm-Up and Cool-Down Stretch Routines

Seated side reach
This cool-down routine focuses on your waist and stretches out the obliques — the muscles
that run down the side of your body. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your legs crossed in front of you.
2. Reach your left arm directly overhead, using the muscles in your upper back to
keep your shoulder blade down and chest lifted.
This position keeps space between your shoulder and ear (see Figure 11-8a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, bend at the waist to the right and reach with your left arm
overhead, keeping your hip anchored to the ﬂoor.
Rest your right hand on the ﬂoor for extra support (see Figure 11-8b). Think of both
sides of your waist lifting and lengthening up and over.
4. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
Try to deepen the stretch with every breath.
5. Repeat this stretch on your other side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your hip anchored to the ﬂoor.
 Do breathe and slowly deepen the stretch.
 Do keep your chest and shoulders facing forward.
 Don’t bend forward or arch your back.
 Don’t hold your breath.

Seated back and neck stretch
The best part about this stretch is that you’ll feel it not only in your hips but also along your
entire back and up through your neck. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your legs crossed in front of you and your hands on the ﬂoor in
front of your legs (see Figure 11-9a).
If you feel pain in your hips or knees while sitting on the ﬂoor, raise your hips off the
ﬂoor by sitting on a pillow, folded blanket, step, or bosu.
2. Inhale and as you exhale bend forward at your hips and use your hands and arms
for support.
With each breath, deepen the stretch by gently reaching forward with your arms (see
Figure 11-9b).
3. Hold the position in Step 2 and drop your chin toward your chest.
4. Shake your head “no” to release muscle tension in your neck.
5. Tilt your head to the right and hold the stretch for a few deep breaths.
6. Tilt your head to the left and hold the stretch for a few deep breaths.
7. Release the neck stretch and slowly sit up.
Don’t always do this stretch with the same leg crossed on top; sometimes have your right
leg on top and sometimes have your left leg crossed on top. This variation keeps the stretch
balanced for both hips.

Chapter 11: Basic Warm-Up and Cool-Down Stretch Routines

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do initiate the movement from your hips, not from your upper back.
 Do keep your chin down as you tilt to the side.
 Don’t tense or tighten your shoulders or back.
Butterfly stretch
This stretch is for the muscles that run along your inner thigh and groin. To do this stretch,
follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your back straight, your abdominals in, and the soles of your
feet touching each other.
It’s important to keep your back straight during this stretch because rounding your
back places undue pressure on your lower back and spine. Sit up tall and think of your
chest lifting forward as you tilt your pelvis back.
2. Place your hands on your ankles and bring your feet as close to your groin as you
can (see Figure 11-10a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, gently press down on the inside of your knees with your
elbows (see Figure 11-10b).
4. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
With each breath, try to get your knees closer to the ﬂoor.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do lengthen your spine as you lean forward from the hips.

 Do keep your neck in line with the rest of your spine. You should be looking at the ﬂoor
in front of you, not at your feet.
 Don’t round your back or tighten your shoulders.
 Don’t bounce your knees toward the ﬂoor — be patient and hold the stretch.
Seated hamstring stretch
Most people ﬁnd it more comfortable and effective to perform this stretch with the aid of a
towel or strap. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your right leg straight out in front of you and your left leg bent
at a comfortable angle (see Figure 11-11a).
2. As you exhale, hinge forward at the hip, keeping your leg straight and your foot
ﬂexed (see Figure 11-11b).
Pay close attention to the position of your pelvis. Your tailbone should be reaching
back as you hinge forward at the hips. Don’t get discouraged if your chest is nowhere
near your leg. As long as you’re feeling a good deep stretch in the back of your thigh,
you’re doing great!
3. Breathe deeply and hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
Deepen the stretch with each breath by tilting your pelvis back, lifting your chest, and
ﬂexing your foot forward.
4. Repeat the same stretch on your left leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do gently pull your foot toward your body with the towel or strap.
 Do keep your knee straight, and try to keep the back of your knee on the ﬂoor.
 Do keep your back straight, not rounded or tensed in your shoulders.
 Don’t force the stretch or pull too hard on the towel.
 Don’t look down at your knees; look at the ﬂoor in front of your toes.

Chapter 11: Basic Warm-Up and Cool-Down Stretch Routines

Seated twist with one leg extended
This stretch gives you a rotational stretch for your core and a stretch in your buttocks at
the same time. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your right leg straight in front of you, your left foot crossed
over your right thigh, and your hands on the ﬂoor behind you (see Figure 11-12a).
2. As you inhale, bring your right knee toward your chest and sit up very straight,
lengthening your spine (see Figure 11-12b).
3. As you exhale, look over your left shoulder, rotate your spine, and tilt your
pelvis back.
Pay close attention to the position of your pelvis. If you avoid tucking your pelvis
under, and you really think about your tailbone reaching for the wall behind you, then
you stretch your abs and back, but you also feel a stretch deep in your buttocks.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, deepening the stretch with every breath.
5. Switch sides and repeat the same stretch on your other leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do bring your knee close to your chest before you twist.
 Do look over your shoulder to lengthen your neck muscles, too.
 Do lengthen your spine before you rotate.
 Don’t tuck your pelvis under or round your back.
Seated straddle stretch
This stretch integrates many muscle groups — inner thigh, back, hamstrings — into one
stretch. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your legs straight, your feet as far apart as possible, and your
hands behind your hips; sit up very tall (see Figure 11-13a).
Keeping your hands behind your hips helps you keep your spine lifted and straight.
This position allows you to stretch your back, inner thighs, and hamstrings without
creating tension in your shoulders and upper back.

2. Move your hips forward an inch or two until you feel the stretch along both inner
thighs.
3. Inhale and as you exhale lean slightly forward, tilting your pelvis back (see
Figure 11-13b).
Your hands are behind your hips in this step, but if you want to add a variation 
and you’re ﬂexible enough to bring your hands in front of you without rounding 
your back, you can deepen the stretch by reaching forward as far as you can.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
Your goal isn’t to get your chest to the ﬂoor; it’s to feel a stretch in your inner thighs with-
out your pelvis tucking under or your back rounding or your knees rolling inward. Even
though this stretch is common, it can still be difﬁcult because of all the muscles involved.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your knees and toes facing upward toward the ceiling.
 Do tilt your pelvis back as you lift your chest.
 Do breathe deeply through the entire stretch.
 Do progress slowly through this stretch, spending 15 seconds or so in the comfort
zone.
 Don’t place your hands in front of you unless you can keep them there without round-
ing your spine or tucking your pelvis under.
 Don’t bounce this stretch.

Side lying quad stretch
This quad stretch is one of the easiest stretches to get into and maintain proper form. You
should feel this stretch in your back, obliques, neck, and chest all at the same time.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your right side with your knees bent close to your chest, and let your head
rest on your right arm (see Figure 11-14a).
2. Grab the top of your left foot and gently move your ankle back toward your but-
tocks (see Figure 11-14b).
Don’t force your heel toward your buttocks. That movement can put pressure on your
knee joint.
3. Squeeze your buttocks to increase the stretch, but don’t let your hips roll back.
Always keep your hips stacked on top of each other and focus on bringing the knee back.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, and then lie on your left side and repeat the stretch
on your other leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do squeeze your buttocks to deepen the stretch.
 Don’t jam your heel toward your buttocks.

This stretch is speciﬁcally for the abdominals, but it’s also great for the back muscles. The
back extension and abdominal stretch increases mobility in your spine and decreases a
rounded back.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your belly, supporting your upper body with your elbows directly under your
shoulders.
2. Lift up out of your shoulders so you aren’t sinking into your shoulder blades.
3. Inhale and as you exhale, lengthen your spine and lift your chest as if you were
going to move forward (see Figure 11-15).
Imagine you’re trying to move forward, but your elbows and hips are glued to the ﬂoor.
And visualize the space between each vertebra as increasing, lengthening your spine.
You should feel this stretch in your abdominals.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your neck long and in line with the rest of your spine.
 Do keep your shoulder blades down.
 Do pull your belly toward your spine.
 Don’t compress your lower back.
 Don’t think of lifting your chest toward the ceiling; think of your chest pressing up
toward the ceiling.

Wrist stretch on all fours
This stretch is my favorite for the wrist and forearm areas; if you have carpal tunnel syn-
drome, though, you should skip this one. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Kneel on all fours with most of your weight on your knees.
2. Place your left hand palm down, ﬁngers facing back toward your knee (see
ﬁgure 11-16a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, gently shift your body weight toward your shoulders.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
Feel the stretch in the palm of your right hand and forearm.
5. Release the stretch and place the back of your hand on the ﬂoor with your ﬁngers
toward your knee (see Figure 11-16b).
6. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
7. Repeat these two stretches on your other wrist.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulder blades down and your body weight shifted toward your heels.
 Don’t put all your weight on the wrist being stretched.
 Don’t bounce during the stretch.
Hip flexor stretch on one knee
The beneﬁt of this stretch is that it can target your hip ﬂexor — a very difﬁcult muscle to
isolate but one that’s important to stretch because it’s responsible for how you walk and all
lower body movement.
If this kneeling stretch is uncomfortable on your knees, try placing a folded towel or pillow
under your knee for cushion.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:

1. Kneel on one knee, place your other foot ﬂat on the ﬂoor in front of you with your
knee bent, and make sure you maintain good posture with your upper body.
Make sure that the back foot and leg aren’t turned in. You’ll feel the stretch a little more
in your hip ﬂexor if your foot is directly behind your hip.
2. Inhale and as you exhale, squeeze your buttocks and tilt your pelvis under (see
Figure 11-17).
Feel the front part of your hip lengthen. If you don’t feel the stretch, you may have to
squeeze your buttocks and tuck your pelvis a little more.
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
4. Repeat on the other side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe throughout the stretch.
 Do keep your chest lifted and shoulders back.
 Do keep your shoulders directly over your hips — you want to lengthen the front of
your hip, not shorten it.
 Don’t hinge forward at your hip.
 Don’t arch your back; just focus on squeezing your buttocks and tucking your pelvis
under.

My Favorite Stretches 
for Speciﬁc Sports
In This Chapter
 Recognizing your ﬂexibility as an athlete
 Knowing how to stretch for certain sports
T
hink for a moment about an unbelievable catch in baseball or football or an amazing
return in tennis. All these feats require a combination of power, agility, and coordina-
tion. And yet if athletes didn’t have the ﬂexibility to reach and stretch their bodies that last
little bit, they never would’ve been able to make the play. And what’s more, if they weren’t
extremely limber, reaching to the utmost limit would most likely cause an injury.
Whether you’re a professional athlete or an aging weekend warrior, anyone who engages in
a sport can beneﬁt from stretching — the key to not only enhanced performance but also to
long-term, injury-free fun.
I chose the stretches in this chapter to address the speciﬁc movements required in a given
sport, but it’s not enough to only stretch one area of the body. Along with the two stretches
I show you for each sport, your overall ﬂexibility program should include stretches for your
neck, shoulders, back, buttocks, hip ﬂexors, thighs, and lower legs. Check out Chapter 8 and
Chapter 11 for examples of total body stretch routines you can do regularly.
Guidelines You Don’t Want to Skip
No matter what sport you engage in, you want to improve your athletic performance and
decrease your risk of injury. So check out the following list for some basic ﬂexibility training
guidelines:
 Warm up. Make sure you warm up before you start to exercise. You need just about 10
to 15 minutes of dynamic stretching that mimics what you’ll later be doing full speed.
Check out Chapter 11 for some examples of dynamic warm-up stretches.
 Drink ﬂuids. Your muscles and joints need ﬂuid to stay ﬂexible and lubricated. So here
are the guidelines:
• If you exercise for less than an hour, water is more than adequate.
• However, if you exercise more than an hour, a sports drink improves endurance,
reaction time, and concentration because carbohydrates are being used by both
the brain and muscle during prolonged exercise.

 Focus on a particular area. Each sport has speciﬁc requirements: A runner needs a
ﬂexible lower body; racquet sports require ﬂexibility in the upper body; and in contact
sports, you need a strong ﬂexible core. To enhance performance and help prevent
injury, focus on the area you use the most.
 Don’t forget the rest of your body. If you’re serious about improving your game
through stretching, you’ll have to engage in a ﬂexibility program that stretches your
entire body two or three days a week. Like everything else in life, you get out of it what
you put into it.
 Cool down. Never forget to cool down after a workout because it allows the blood and
oxygen to return to your heart and muscles instead of “pooling” or staying in your
extremities. After your breathing returns to normal and your heart rate is under
100 beats per minute, your body has cooled down sufﬁciently.
Running and Hiking
When you go for a run or a hike, you use the powerhouse muscles or large muscle groups in
the lower half. These muscles need stretching so they can support all the dynamic move-
ments your body demands. The following two stretches focus on the large, powerful
muscles in the lower body to make sure that your body is as balanced as possible.
Gluteal stretch
One of the main functions of the gluteal muscles of the buttocks is to help fully extend the
hip joint, which is a crucial part of the running motion. This exercise helps ensure that you
get full range of motion in your buttocks muscles, and therefore your hips, which results in
a long, graceful, ﬂuid, powerful running stride.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Get on the ﬂoor on your hands and knees.
2. Bring your left knee forward as far as you can, and rest your knee, shin and foot on
the ﬂoor.
3. Inhale and as you exhale, lower your left buttock to the ground, extending your
right leg behind you and resting the front of your right thigh, kneecap, shin, and
foot on the ﬂoor (see Figure 12-1).
4. Gently push your right hip toward the ﬂoor and hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
To intensify this stretch, try moving your front foot farther away from your hip.
5. Repeat this stretch on your other leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your hips facing front.
 Do support the weight of your upper body on your hands.
 Do lean forward, but don’t arch your back.
 Don’t continue holding the stretch if you feel pain in your front knee.

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

Calf stretch
To make sure you fully address both of the major calf muscles — the gastrocnemius and the
soleus — perform this stretch in both positions: with your leg straight and with your knee
slightly bent.
Always begin the calf stretch in the comfort zone for the ﬁrst 10 to 15 seconds of the
stretch. This period allows your body to get comfortable with the stretch and gives your
muscles a chance to relax and let go before you try to deepen the stretch. For this reason,
I recommend performing this stretch in the warm-up period of your workout.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand with one foot ﬂat on the landing of a step or the top of a curb.
2. Place only the ball of your other foot on the edge of the step, slightly behind the
ﬁrst foot (see Figure 12-2).
3. Slowly let your heel lower below the edge of the step until you feel tension in
your calf.
4. Hold the stretch for 15 seconds as you breathe deeply.
5. Inhale and as you exhale, bend your back knee slightly, keeping your heel reaching
toward the ﬂoor.
This stretch mimics the ankle and calf position during running. Using a step helps
increase the range of motion in your ankle joint. You may need to hold on to a staircase
railing or a sturdy surface nearby to help you keep your balance.
Figure 12-1:
The gluteal
stretch.

Chapter 12: My Favorite Stretches for Speciﬁc Sports

6. Hold the stretch for another 15 to 20 seconds, keeping your shoulders down and
chest lifted.
If you lean forward slightly during the stretch, the stretch will deepen.
7. Repeat this stretch on the other leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do progress through the stretch gradually.
 Do lean forward so you don’t lose your balance.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.
Racquet Sports
If you play racquet sports, you may notice that you generally use one side of your body —
or the dominant arm — more than the other, thus creating an imbalance, or asymmetry,
between your two sides. When training for racquet sports, remember to always strengthen
and stretch both sides equally because an imbalance can lead to injury.
Wrist and forearm stretch
This stretch can help prevent tennis elbow — a painful inﬂammation of the tissue surround-
ing the elbow, caused by strain from playing tennis and other sports and from overuse of
the lower arm muscles — because it lengthens the forearm muscles. You feel this stretch
not only in your forearms but also in your wrists and hands.

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand tall with your back straight and your feet a comfortable distance apart.
2. Relax your shoulders and lift your abdominals.
3. Inhale and extend your right arm forward about shoulder height, palm up.
4. As you exhale, grab the ﬁngers of your right hand with your left hand and gently
pull your ﬁngers back toward your body (see Figure 12-3a).
5. Hold this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds, breathing deeply throughout the stretch.
6. Release the stretch and rotate your palm face down.
7. Inhale and use your left hand to gently pull the tips of your right ﬁngers back
toward your body (see Figure 12-3b).
8. Hold this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds, breathing deeply throughout the stretch.
9. Repeat the stretch on the left arm.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do sit up tall with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
 Do keep your arms extended as you stretch the wrist.
 Do breathe through the stretch.
 Don’t hold the stretch if you feel pain in your wrist joint.

Kneeling chest stretch
The following stretch increases shoulder range of motion by lengthening and stretching the
largest of your chest muscles — the pectoralis major. Perform the following steps for the
kneeling chest stretch:
1. Kneel on a carpeted ﬂoor or mat with your forearms crossed and resting on the seat
of a sturdy chair (see Figure 12-4a).
2. Breathe in and as you exhale let your head and chest sink below the chair (see
Figure 12-4b).
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
You should feel the stretch in your upper chest and use deep breathing to help sink
gradually deeper into the stretch.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do start the stretch in the comfort zone and gradually progress into a deep stretch.
 Do maintain the natural curve of you spine, avoiding arching or rounding your back.
 Do lift your bellybutton toward your spine.
 Don’t allow your pelvis to tilt back or tuck under.
 Don’t do this stretch if it causes shoulder pain.
Basketball
Basketball is truly a total-body sport that requires some very speciﬁc movements to shoot
the ball and move with maximum mobility. The stretches in this section help increase your
overhead reach to snag rebounds and improve the range of motion in your triceps to help
you drain those jump shots.
Step back with overhead reach
This stretch is for the muscles that run along the front of your torso. You should feel this
stretch in your hip ﬂexors, abdominals, and chest. To do this stretch, follow these steps:

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

1. Stand tall with your feet together, your abdominals and chest lifted, your shoulders
back, and your shoulder blades down (see Figure 12-5a).
2. Inhale and as you exhale, lunge back with your left leg and reach your left arm up
and back (see Figure 12-5b).
To feel a deeper stretch in your hip ﬂexor, tuck your pelvis under as you step back.
3. Inhale and bring your foot and arm back to starting position.
4. Repeat this exercise with your right leg and arm.
5. Repeat the stretch six to eight more times.
As you get stronger, work your way up to two sets of eight.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your spine long, even as you reach up and back.
 Don’t twist or reach to the side.
Triceps stretch
This traditional stretch for the back of your upper arm can be done sitting or standing. To
do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall and raise your left arm and bend your elbow so your ﬁngers are reach-
ing down your spine and your elbow is pointing upward (see Figure 12-6a).
2. Place your right hand on your raised elbow, and as you exhale, gently press your
elbow back so your ﬁngers of your left hand reach farther down your spine (see
Figure 12-6b).

3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
4. Repeat this stretch with your right arm.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your eyes looking forward.
 Do keep your back straight and deepen the stretch by moving your elbow back, not by
arching your back.
 Don’t force or bounce the stretch.
Football
Because of the enormous number and ferocity of the collisions that occur regularly in foot-
ball, a strong and ﬂexible neck is essential. Coaches and trainers put a lot of time into
making sure their athletes’ necks are strong and ﬂexible to protect from a severe injury.
Side and back of neck stretch
This stretch is for the muscles that run along the side and back of your neck, down into
your upper back. This stretch can be done sitting or standing, but just remember that to
effectively stretch this area you must anchor your shoulder blades and keep them still to
provide a solid foundation for the stretch.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

1. Sit up tall or stand tall with your shoulders down, chest lifted, and abdominals in.
2. Exhale and slowly lower your chin toward your chest (see Figure 12-7a).
3. Hold this position as you inhale.
4. As you exhale, slowly tilt your head to the left, keeping your chin down (see
Figure 12-7b).
Because the muscles you’re stretching attach to your shoulder girdle, you’ll diminish
the stretch if you raise your shoulders when you tilt your head to the side. Keep your
shoulders down.
5. Inhale again and as you exhale, slightly turn your chin toward your shoulder.
This movement is subtle, but you’ll deﬁnitely feel it in your neck and upper back.
6. Hold the stretch for one or two more deep breaths and then lift your head back to
the center.
7. Inhale and lift your shoulders and then exhale as you lower your shoulders.
8. Repeat the stretch two to three times and then switch sides.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do sit up or stand up tall as you hold the stretch.
 Don’t let your shoulders round forward as you drop your head.
 Don’t yank or force the stretch.

Outer thigh stretch
This stretch is for the hip abductors or outer thigh muscles. Because this outer thigh
muscle plays an important role in stabilizing your knee, excessively tight hip abductors can
cause knee problems because of poor knee alignment. This stretch helps maintain ﬂexibility
in your back and trunk area, as well as increases spinal rotation.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your right leg straight in front of you.
2. Bend your left knee and place your left foot on the ﬂoor on the outside of your right
thigh.
3. Inhale and pull your knee toward your chest with your right arm (see Figure 12-8a).
Make sure to sit up straight, lengthening your spine.
4. As you exhale, look over your left shoulder, rotating your spine and tilting your
pelvis back (see Figure 12-8b).
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, deepening the stretch with every breath.
6. Switch sides and repeat the same stretch on your other leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do bring your knee close to your chest before you twist.
 Do look over your shoulder so you get a lengthening in your neck muscles as well.
 Do sit up straight to lengthen your spine before you rotate.
 Don’t tuck your pelvis under or round your back.
Swimming
Your deltoid muscle is the primary muscle of your shoulder and is crucial for every swim-
ming stroke there is. Flexibility in this muscle goes a long way toward increasing the range
of motion in your stroke and, therefore, your overall speed.
Shoulder stretch with towel or strap
You’ll feel this stretch all around your shoulder but particularly in the front part of your 
deltoid. You need a towel or strap for this stretch — go ahead, run to the closet to get one.
I’ll wait.

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up very tall, feet about hip-width apart, holding both ends of a towel or strap
in front of your thighs (see Figure 12-9a).
2. Inhale, straighten your arms, and raise them overhead (see Figure 12-9b).
3. As you exhale, move your arms farther behind your head but don’t arch your back
(see Figure 12-9c).
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do progress through the stretch slowly and gradually.
 Do stand up tall as you hold the stretch.
 Don’t twist to either side.
Deltoid stretch
Range of motion in the shoulder joint is so important for a swimmer. This stretch can be
done sitting, standing, or lying down.
To achieve the full effectiveness of the stretch, make sure to maintain good posture.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up straight with your feet a comfortable distance apart.
2. Contract and lift your abdominals as you gently pull your shoulder blades down.
3. Lift your right arm across your chest and hook your other arm under your elbow
(see Figure 12-10a).
If your shoulders are extremely stiff or tight and you ﬁnd it difﬁcult to hook your arm
underneath your other arm, try the stretch lying on your back. Just drape your arm
across your body and let gravity do the work. You may ﬁnd it more comfortable.
4. Now, gently lower your right shoulder so it’s even with your left shoulder (see
Figure 12-10b).

5. Inhale and as you exhale, use your left arm to gently pull your right arm across
your body.
6. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do progress through the stretch gradually.
 Don’t pull too forcefully.
Skiing
Skiing requires good coordination, balance, and of course, ﬂexibility to help you move
around those large hills of snow! The looser you are when you ski, the more agile you’ll be
on the slopes.
Standing buttocks stretch
This functional stretch increases your ﬂexibility and strengthens your buttocks muscles
while improving your balance and coordination. Use any sturdy surface such as a wall or
table to help you stabilize during the stretch.

Part III: From the Daily Grind to Ways to Unwind: Routines to Fit Your Life and Needs 

To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with your ski pole or other supportive surface in front of you.
2. Lift your left foot and place it on your right thigh as you slightly bend your
right knee.
3. Inhale and as you exhale, bend your right knee a little deeper and hinge at your
hips so you’re hips move back slightly.
You should be in a position similar to a squat (see Figure 12-11). You should feel this
stretch in your left buttock.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
5. Repeat on the other side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do tilt your pelvis back to feel a deeper stretch in your buttocks.
 Do keep your back straight and your abdominals lifted.
 Don’t let your knee jut forward. Instead, it should stay directly above your ankle.
You should feel your weight mostly in your heel, not in your toes or the ball of
your foot.
 Don’t lean too much on your ski pole — it’s only there to help you maintain your bal-
ance, not to support your body weight.

Lying quad stretch
Skiing really puts a lot of emphasis on your quads. To keep full range of motion in your
quads, perform this stretch regularly in the weeks leading up to ski season.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on the ﬂoor, facedown with both legs straight.
2. Rest your forehead on your right ﬁst and bend your left knee and raise your heel
toward your buttocks.
3. Reach behind you with your left hand and grab the top of your foot and hold your
foot in place.
4. Inhale and as you exhale, squeeze your buttocks and gently press your left hip
toward the ﬂoor (see Figure 12-12).
Avoid letting your knee move sideways; keep your knees as close together as you can.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
6. Repeat the stretch on your right side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your head down, resting on your ﬁst.
 Do use your breath to relax into the stretch.
 Do keep your knees together and squeeze your buttocks.
 Don’t focus on bringing your foot to your buttocks, instead focus on pressing your hip
toward the ﬂoor.
Soccer
Soccer is all about the lower body for both range of motion and endurance. The lower body
stretches in this section can be done at the ﬁeld either before or after your game. Just
remember to warm up properly before performing these stretches. See Chapter 11 for
some warm-up exercises.

Squat stretch for your inner thighs
Mobility and ﬂexibility are important in the lower body when playing soccer. The following
stretch focuses on your groin and inner thigh muscles, as well as your lower back.
Even though the squat can be a very natural and comfortable position, if you experience
any pain in your knees due to injury or tightness, discontinue this stretch.
To do this stretch (shown in Figure 12-13), follow these steps:
1. Begin from a standing position, legs apart and feet slightly turned out.
2. Squat down, placing your hands on the ﬂoor with your elbows inside your knees.
Do keep your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor because that position helps prevent knee strain. If
you can’t keep your feet ﬂat, you may want to try using a 2 x 4 under your heels.
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
4. Gently press your elbows against the inside of your knees to deepen the stretch and
prevent your knees from rolling inward.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep knees over your ankles, avoid letting your knees roll inward.
 Don’t tighten or tense your neck and shoulders.

Seated buttocks stretch
Having ﬂexibility in your buttocks may not equate to acceleration in your mind, but it is a
little-known fact that your powerful speed can derive from the strength of your buttocks
muscles. This stretch helps you get to the ball before the other guy, and look good doing it.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ground with your right leg straight and the outside of your left ankle on
your right thigh, just above your knee.
Place your hands behind you to help support your back (see Figure 12-14a).
2. Inhale and bend your right knee until your right foot is ﬂat on the ground.
3. Exhale and lift your chest forward, straightening your back and tilting your tailbone
toward the ground (see Figure 12-14b).
4. Breathe deeply as you hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
Deepen the stretch with each breath by tilting your pelvis back, lifting your chest, and
pressing your left knee away from your chest.
5. Switch sides and repeat the same stretch on your other leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do gently hinge forward at your hips.
 Do keep your back straight, not rounded or tense in your shoulders.
 Don’t look down at your knee; look at the ﬂoor in front of your toes.
Cycling
Anyone who’s ever ridden a bike knows that the major engine of this sport is the quadri-
ceps muscles. And anyone who’s ever ridden a bike for a long time knows how tight the
back can get due to the bending over for a long time. The following two stretches address
both of these sources of tension.

Supported upper back stretch
Stretching out your tired upper back muscles feels great after a long bike ride.
Make sure to use your bike or any other sturdy support, such as the back of a park 
bench or a tree during this stretch. And make sure you can place your hands about hip
height.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and place your hands on a sturdy surface for
support.
2. Move your feet back far enough so you can extend your arms as you move your
chest toward the ﬂoor (see Figure 12-15).
3. As you exhale, deepen the stretch by pressing your chest toward the ﬂoor and your
hips toward the ceiling so you have a slight arch in your back.
4. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your neck in line with the rest of your spine.
 Don’t drop your chin to your chest.
 Don’t round your spine.

Lunging quad stretch
This stretch targets your quadriceps and hip ﬂexors, which can get very tight in cyclists
because these muscles are a primary part of the power stroke, especially on long rides.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Begin standing, with your legs spread about two feet apart with one foot in front
and one foot behind you.
2. Inhale and as you exhale, bend both knees and lean forward until you can place
both hands on the ﬂoor directly behind your front heel.
3. Slide your back leg back far enough so you can lower your back knee to the ﬂoor
without putting weight on your kneecap (see Figure 12-16a).
4. Inhale again and as you exhale, gently press your hips toward the ﬂoor.
5. Inhale and as you exhale, slowly lift your back foot up and grab hold of it with your
same side hand (see Figure 12-16b).
6. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
7. Repeat the same stretch on the other side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your chest lifted and your shoulder blades down.
 Do keep your front knee at a right angle and directly over your front heel.
 Don’t put your weight on the kneecap of the leg behind you, but instead, your weight
should be supported on the softer part of your leg just above your kneecap.

n this part of the book, you discover that no matter
what stage of life you’re in, stretching can improve your
daily life. Chapter 13 focuses on pregnancy and contains
some of my favorite stretches to help you relax and enjoy
this time in your life (Hey, I’ve had two kids!). Chapter 14
gives you some fun stretches for your kids, no matter what
age they are, and Chapter 15 contains a great stretching
routine designed to address the concerns of anyone over
the age of 60.

 Getting started early to reclaim your body after giving birth
I
f you’re reading this chapter, you may be pregnant or have just given birth (or interested
in the info for someone you know who’s pregnant or had a baby — but know that this
chapter is directed speciﬁcally for mothers to be and new moms). In any case, many dis-
comforts come along with pregnancy and childbirth, and this chapter offers stretching as a
way to help! Whether it’s swollen feet, a burgeoning belly, or lower back pain, this chapter
gives you the best stretching exercises you can do for you and your baby, during pregnancy
and after.
How Stretching Can Help if You’re Pregnant
When you become pregnant, your body’s posture changes in order for the baby to grow,
and so your body can get ready for the birthing process. Increased hormones play a big
part in these structural changes and allow your ligaments to loosen and stretch. You’ll ﬁnd
that some of your muscles tighten while others loosen (my hips got really loose!). As a
result, you need to do ﬂexibility exercises for the muscles that get tight.
If you’re preggers, here’s what stretching can do for you:
 Reduce muscle tension in the lower back due to your growing belly
 Increase range of movement in the joints
 Improve coordination (which you need desperately, thanks to your growing belly)
 Aid in the circulation of all the extra blood you have pumping through your veins to
various parts of the body
 Increase your energy level (a result of increased circulation)
You may be sitting a lot in the late stages of pregnancy, so take the time to stretch out a bit
after you’ve been sitting in a particular position for a long time. I promise that stretching
really helps you keep ﬂexibility in your joints and a bounce in your step! Be good to your
body, and it will be good back.

Stretches for the Pregnant Lady
In this section, I take you through some wonderful pregnancy stretches that help alleviate
back pain from carrying all that extra weight around. The following stretches also help
counter your loss of balance because that weight gain is all out front!
Pelvic circles
This exercise moves, stretches, and loosens up the hips and pelvis. It also helps ease back
pain in late pregnancy and works the glutes and abdominals.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart and maintain a relaxed bend in your knees.
2. Place your hands on your hips (see Figure 13-1a).
3. Slowly circle your pelvis ten times clockwise — as if you were using a Hula-Hoop
(see Figure 13-2b).
4. Repeat the pelvic circle ten times in the opposite direction (counterclockwise).
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep a slight bend in your knees.
 Do place your hands on your hips for balance.

Part IV: Getting Limber as You Live: Stretches for Various Life Stages 
What’s happening to your prenatal body?
Oh, who sings that song . . . ChChChCh Changes? Was it
the Beatles? I forgot (yet another side effect of preg-
nancy). And that’s exactly what’s happening to your body
throughout this miraculous time — many, many changes!
So take a look at the following list to see what’s causing
all these changes and why your body’s working overtime:
 Fluid retention:Four to ﬁve pounds of your weight gain
is from water retention. Your body needs this water to
maintain a balance of nutrients for you and the baby.
 Stored fat: The amount of fat that your body stores
varies from four pounds on up, depending on your
diet. This element is the one thing of your weight gain
that you can control, so eating better (not more)
while you’re pregnant should be your goal.
 Expanding uterus: Your uterus is expanding to make
room for your baby. The uterus weighs two pounds
but don’t worry, it will tighten and move back into
place after the baby is born. In fact, the contractions
you feel for a short time after you give birth help
squeeze out extra ﬂuid and blood and return the
uterus back to its original size.
 Placenta: The placenta accounts for a one and half
pounds of your total weight gain.
 Amniotic ﬂuid: The amniotic ﬂuid, which is the ﬂuid
your baby is contained in, makes up two pounds of
your baby weight. When your “water breaks,” the
amniotic sac of ﬂuid is what’s actually “breaking.”
 Blood volume: Your blood volume increases approx-
imately 40 percent to support your growing baby.
This increase accounts for a total of four pounds.
Keeping yourself moving aids in circulation and
keeps the oxygen ﬂowing to support the extra weight
and the baby within your body.
 Baby: Six to eight pounds go to the baby, although a
lot of women have preemies who weigh around ﬁve
pounds or babies who weigh well over ten pounds.
 Breasts: This tissue accounts for two or more pounds.

 Do breath regularly.
 Don’t circle your pelvis in too big of circles — keep the movement small.
Extended arm pulse for your upper back
This stretch is great to do during your second trimester and can be done in a sitting posi-
tion. The movement targets the entire spine and helps relieve upper back pain caused by
your growing belly and breasts.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the edge of a chair making sure that your feet are ﬂat on the ﬂoor (see
Figure 13-2a).
Keep your back straight and your abdominal muscles tight and pulled in.
2. Extend your arms out to your side at shoulder height with your palms facing forward.
3. Slowly pulse your arms behind you as if you were trying to squeeze your shoulder
blades together (see Figure 13-2b).
4. Repeat ﬁve times, taking a few slow breaths between stretches.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor for balance and support.
 Do keep your tummy tight and pulled in.
 Don’t raise your arms above shoulder level.

The C-shape that targets your total back
This stretch eases back pain and tension by targeting the muscles in your lower back
and stretching out your spine. Be sure to do this stretch whenever you feel lower back 
discomfort.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Stand with your feet hip-distance apart, keeping your knees relaxed (as shown in
Figure 13-3a).
2. Hold on to a door or stationary object for support, and bend your knees and round
your back, tucking your chin toward your chest and tucking your pelvis under (see
Figure 13-3b).
3. Hold this stretch for ten seconds and repeat several times.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercises:
 Do hold on to something for balance during this stretch.
 Do keep your knees slightly bent.
 Don’t forget to tuck your chin toward your chest to stretch the entire back.
Knee raise for your lower back
This stretch helps relieve lower back pain and the added pressure you may be feeling from
weight gain.

Part IV: Getting Limber as You Live: Stretches for Various Life Stages 

You should only do this stretch in your ﬁrst trimester because you have to lie on your back,
which can decrease blood ﬂow to your baby.
You need a towel to do this stretch.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back on a mat on the ﬂoor, on your bed, or on the couch and bend both
knees while keeping your feet ﬂat on the surface you’re lying on (see Figure 13-4a).
2. Bring your right knee toward your chest and place the towel around your right foot.
3. Flex your foot as you gently bring your knee up toward your right shoulder (as
shown in Figure 13-4b).
4. Hold the stretch for a few seconds and then release.
5. Repeat the stretch with your left leg.

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do ﬂex your foot as you loop the towel around it.
 Do pull the towel gently toward your shoulder.
 Don’t forget to breathe through this entire stretch.
Stretches for After the Bun’s out of the Oven
Because of all the changes that occurred during labor and delivery, it’s going to take a while
before you begin feeling like your old self again. So listen to your body and start exercising
and stretching slowly. After all, you shouldn’t be expected to jump back into the same work-
out you were doing before you gave birth (or became pregnant).
Upper body stretches
Your upper body gets sore and tight from all the burping and bending over you do when
baby arrives (believe me, I just had a baby, and I am sore!). The next two exercises target
the shoulders, arms, and chest while increasing circulation to keep the upper body free
from tension.
Shoulder reach
This stretch helps relax the shoulders and relieve any soreness you may have in the shoul-
der joints. To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Sit in a cross-legged position comfortably on the ﬂoor with your arms stretched out
to the side (see Figure 13-5a).
2. Cross your right arm over your chest and hold it with your left hand (as shown in
Figure 13-5b).
3. Keeping your shoulders relaxed and down, hold the stretch for two breaths and
then switch arms.

 Do keep your back straight and sit tall during this stretch.
 Do inhale as you stretch your arm across your chest.
 Don’t let your shoulders ﬂoat up to your neck — keep them pressed down and relaxed.
Chest opener
This stretch feels really good to do after a long day of being hunched over a crib or chang-
ing table. The movements open the chest and help relax the upper body.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Sit in a comfortable cross-legged position on the ﬂoor.
Be sure to sit up tall and keep your back nice and straight (as shown in Figure 13-6a).
2. Inhale as you clasp your hands behind your neck, opening your chest and expand-
ing your lungs (see Figure 13-6b).
3. Hold the stretch for two breaths and then release.
4. Repeat the movement ﬁve times.
A couple do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do gaze at the ceiling to help relax your neck and shoulders as you clasp your hands
behind your neck and inhale.
 Don’t arch your back; keep the spine tall and straight.
Lower body stretches
Stretching the lower body is extremely important after giving birth because you spend a lot
of time sitting and feeding your baby. Sitting too long can result in tight buttocks muscles
and sore hips. The following stretches help relieve these aches and pains that are so
common in the lower body.

Lying pelvic tilt
This stretch is a great one for improving lower body circulation and relieving pelvic tension.
You can also strengthen the abs, legs, and buttocks with this stretch.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
Your back shouldn’t be arched, as shown in Figure 13-7a.
2. Inhale through your nose, and as you exhale through your mouth gently draw your
abdominal muscles in toward your spine (see Figure 13-7b).
3. Squeeze your buttocks without lifting your hips.
4. Hold for two breaths and then release.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor during this stretch.
 Do keep your back ﬂat on the ﬂoor to keep from arching.
 Don’t forget to keep your hands on your abs to feel your muscles tightening.
Kneeling pelvic tilt
By tilting your pelvis toward your spine during this stretch, you’re strengthening the
abdominal wall as well as stretching out your abdominal muscles. A great stretch for those
underused abs!

Chapter 14
Family Fun: Kid-Friendly Stretches
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the importance of stretching for kids
 Making stretching fun and useful
 Joining in the fun: Stretches you can do together
You might think that because school-age kids’ muscles are still so new and fresh they
would naturally be ﬂexible. But just ask any soccer mom or cheerleading coach and
you’ll ﬁnd that the subject of ﬂexibility and children is often misunderstood.
Although very young kids do in fact have naturally pliable muscles and joints, children
between the ages of 6 and 12 experience bursts of rapid bone growth at a rate that can actu-
ally create tension in the connective tissues that aren’t growing as quickly. These spurts
result in a surprising tightness in their still very young muscles. So don’t be fooled when
you see how ﬂexible young gymnasts are on TV, most kids aren’t that limber.
Research shows that children need stretching for the same reasons adults need stretching:
to help them develop body awareness, increase ﬂexibility, and improve performance in
sports. And no matter what age or level of conditioning your children are at, children will
exercise if it’s presented as play (however if it’s presented to them like broccoli, you can
forget it!). That’s why I’ve tried to make the stretches in this chapter fun and lighthearted
for the little ones, and for the older kids, a little more challenging and useful.
Enticing Children to Get Off Their Tushes
Every advantage you can give your kids, no matter how small, can pay off big in the future.
And when it comes to helping them increase their ﬂexibility, it doesn’t take a lot to get the
job done: A spirited game of Twister may easily do the trick, as does setting limits for the
amount of time your kids sit at the computer or play X-Box. Take a break for a little stretch-
ing, and tell your kiddos that the break will improve their game score — they’ll love it!
Or better yet, buy them a hip dance game like “Dance, Dance Revolution.” It comes with a
dance pad and you actually move your feet, not just your thumbs! Better still, you play it
with them!
If your kids like to plop themselves in front of the TV all day, try to come up with some cre-
ative movements your children can do while watching TV. Here are some prime examples of
TV programming you should use to your advantage:
 Sporting events: If your kids are watching sports and they see someone warming up in
the on-deck circle or on the sideline, point out that every high-level athlete stretches
and warms up before getting in the game. Suggest that they try the same move right
there in your living room. See how they do. Talk about how it feels. Is it easy? Is it hard?
Do they know what muscle they’re stretching? Have them show you a move or stretch
that their coach (if they play sports) has had them do.

Then the next step is for you to get down on the ﬂoor with your little ones and work on
your ﬂexibility as a family! The secret is making it fun, and trust me, the kids will get a
big kick out of watching Mom or Dad trying to do something difﬁcult — it makes you
look surprisingly human. This family time is a good way to exercise your humility and
make you more ﬂexible, too!
 Commercial breaks: While watching their favorite TV show, have your kids stretch
during the commercial breaks. Most commercials are about 30 seconds, which is about
how long you should hold a stretch. Suggest that your children come up with a differ-
ent stretch for each commercial and hold it for the duration of the commercial. See
who can be the most creative!
To get a jump on this situation, it’s important to get kids moving early in their lives. More
important, as parents, you need to be healthy role models so your kids grow up loving to
move. No matter what form of movement you choose to encourage, all that matters is that it
should be fun and playful for younger kids and fun and challenging for older kids.
Keep in mind that you are helping to develop crucial attitudes toward ﬁtness, as well as
sound workout techniques that last them throughout their lives.
Creative Stretches for 4-to-8-Year-Olds
You can’t really expect young kids to hold a hamstring stretch, so you have to do whatever
you can to make stretches in general fun and appealing. That’s why, in this section, I make
the stretches resemble mostly animal movements. At this age, kids love to talk about animals:
what they look like, how they move, and what sounds they make.
But remember to keep your stretches and exercises simple — the less complicated the
better, especially in the 4- to 8-year-old group. Consider the following ideas for your stretch-
ing time:
 Pick a theme such as animals, dinosaurs, or bulldozers and use your imagination to
tell a story about whatever theme you choose.
For example, my child loves animals, so one day we might be a mommy and baby 
grizzly bear and we need to eat. We walk around the room on our hands and feet 
pretending to search for food. Sometimes we ﬁnd food on the ground; sometimes we
have to reach into the trees, and sometimes we reach into the water to catch ﬁsh.
We imagine it is very hot so we move very slowly. After we eat, we are very tired, 
so we stretch before we lie down. On another day we might be giraffes eating the tops
of very tall trees. Whatever the adventure is, we have fun — and the best part is that
we stretch not only our bodies, but also our imaginations!
 Play a game such as “Mother-may-I” or “Hot Potato.”
 Use props such as balls or ribbons on sticks.
For some more good ideas on exercising with your kids, check out the kids’ chapter in
Exercise Balls For Dummies (Wiley) by yours truly or two programs starring Madeleine
Lewis: On the Ball Kit for Ages 3-6 or On the Ball Kit for Ages 7-10 (both distributed by
Gaiam).
For the animal poses in this section, I suggest that you demonstrate them ﬁrst. Making
bizarre animal noises, singing songs, and telling jokes all add to the fun and playful 
atmosphere — there’s no reason to tell your kids that these are really sound and effective
stretching exercises.

Part IV: Getting Limber as You Live: Stretches for Various Life Stages 

Reach for the stars!
Your child will have fun using her imagination for this total body stretch. This exercise
warms up your kids and stretches them out for the routines later in this chapter (it also
helps them count!).
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Have your child stand very tall with her feet together.
2. Explain that there are beautiful stars high above her head and you want her to try
to catch ten of them for you (see Figure 14-1a).
I tell my daughter to catch ten stars and give them to me before we can start to play
games. I ask her to imagine that the stars are very high above her head, so she must
reach as high up as she can. Be sure to encourage your child to reach higher and
higher as she counts to ten.
3. After the stars are collected, ask your child to bring them to you.
Imagine that you see the stars and tell your daughter how beautiful the stars are. If
your child was having fun, ask her to get ten more. Imagine that this time the stars are
all over the room and the kids must run and catch them (see Figure 14-1b).
4. Repeat the stretch two or three times or as long as your kids are having fun!
Use this stretch to reinforce knowledge of shapes and colors as well. Instead of having the
children ﬁnd 10 or 15 stars, have them imagine that they have to reach for different color
stars, and they have to shout out what color they see. Or explain that different shapes are
ﬂoating in the air and that they have to call out what they see.

Chapter 14: Family Fun: Kid-Friendly Stretches

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do make the stretch fun.
 Do encourage the kids to reach as high as they can, even if it means getting way up on
their tiptoes.
 Do use your imagination and act like you see the stars, too!
 Don’t criticize — there is no right or wrong way to do this exercise.
 Don’t take too long to explain; just get them reaching and then you can go into more
detail as they move.
 Don’t rush the kids. If they’re enjoying themselves, let them continue playing and
reaching.
The seal
Most kids have seen a seal show at a marine park or aquarium, or maybe they’ve actually
been lucky enough to see seals in their natural habitat. Either way, use this memory or
image to get the kids to stretch their abdominal muscles and increase ﬂexibility in their
spine.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Have your child lie on his belly.
2. Tell him to raise the upper body up and rest his weight on his elbows.
3. Ask him to clap and make noises like a very happy seal (see Figure 14-2).
Let your child be as loud as he wants, and reinforce making the sounds, because if your
kid is barking, you know he’s not holding his breath, and he’s getting all the oxygen his
muscles need.
4. Continue barking for about ten seconds and then lower down and pretend to be
sleeping seals.
5. Repeat the stretch two or three times or as long as your child’s having fun!

Part IV: Getting Limber as You Live: Stretches for Various Life Stages 

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do make the stretch fun!
 Do encourage the kids to lift as high as they can without lifting their hips off the ﬂoor.
 Don’t criticize.
 Don’t rush — let your kids play as seals as long as they want.
The dinosaur walk
Take your kids back to dinosaur times! Ask them to imagine they are turning into a
Stegosaurus — not only will they have fun, but also they’ll be stretching their calves, 
hamstrings, back, and shoulders all at once. (You may want to show them a picture of a
Stegosaurus so they know what you’re talking about — a quick search on the Internet will
produce all the pictures you need.)
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Have your child start with his hands and feet on the ﬂoor with his bottom up high in
the air (see Figure 14-3).
2. Tell your child to imagine that he’s turning into a very large Stegosaurus, and ask
him to walk slowly forward around the room like a big dinosaur, alternating arms
and legs.
3. Tell your kid to stop because it’s time to take a bite of grass or a drink from a
cool pond.
As he holds this position and acts out a Stegosaurus drinking or eating, he gets a great
stretch without even realizing it.

Chapter 14: Family Fun: Kid-Friendly Stretches

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do use your imagination to really playact with the kids.
 Do slow the children down if they’re walking too fast.
 Do walk around the room and see if you can get the kids to lift their hips a little higher
or lower their heels to the ﬂoor (this tweak helps stretch their calves and hamstrings).
 Don’t criticize or give too many directions — this exercise should be fun.
The flamingo
Just standing on one leg is a fun challenge for any young child. It’s great for their balance
and coordination, and here I show you how to turn a simple trick into a ﬂexibility exercise.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Ask your child if she has seen ﬂamingos at the zoo, and then ask if she remembers if
the ﬂamingos were standing on one leg or two.
Explain that ﬂamingos always stand, and to sleep they stand on one leg.
2. Invite your child to stand on one leg (with the other foot planted on the inside of the
standing leg’s calf) and pretend to be sleeping ﬂamingos (see Figure 14-4).
3. Tell your kid to make snoring sounds as if she were sleeping, and hold the position
for 20 to 30 seconds.
Snoring promotes breathing in a fun way during the exercise, and it may take your
child’s mind off trying to stay balanced.
4. Wake your little ﬂamingo up and have her stand on her other leg and again be a
sleeping, snoring ﬂamingo, repeating Steps 1–3.
Figure 14-4:

challenge.
222
Part IV: Getting Limber as You Live: Stretches for Various Life Stages 

After a few intervals of being a ﬂamingo, your child may be ready for more of a challenge.
Have her hold on to a wall or sturdy chair with one hand while following the steps for the
standing quad stretch in Figure 14-9. This stretch is a little more advanced than just balanc-
ing, and it also stretches the front of the thighs a little deeper.
A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do focus on the fun and let your little ones giggle and wobble.
 Don’t let the child lift her knee so high behind her that it tilts the hip back, making bal-
ancing more difﬁcult.
 Don’t let your child be a slouching ﬂamingo — be a tall, proud ﬂamingo!
Sports Stretches for 9- to 12-Year-Olds
Soccer parents ask me all the time about stretches for their middle-school-age kids. My ﬁrst
reaction is to tell them to have their kids make their beds — leaning out over the mattress to
tuck in the sheets and blanket is a great hamstring stretch and kills two birds with one stone!
But to be honest, the ﬂexibility needs of kids at this age really require more detailed attention.
Not only can older children follow stretching directions similar to the way adults do, but
also their growing bodies have ﬂexibility needs approaching those of adults. For instance,
if a young athlete neglects stretching and has tight hamstrings and/or hip ﬂexors, that con-
dition can lead to lower back pain, just like in adults. And, according to the American
Academy of Pediatrics, stretching before and after sports increases ﬂexibility, enhances 
performance, and most important, helps prevent injuries.
Kids tend to be competitive in everything at this age, so enforce the fact that stretching isn’t
a competition. Your child doesn’t have to do the splits just because the friend next door
does them. Make sure that your child listens to his body and goes slowly. The stretching
program can still be challenging though. Encourage proper form, and try to motivate your
child to stretch regularly by tracking results. When he notices that he can run faster or is
closer to doing the splits or hitting a home run or achieving any other goal, he’ll be more
likely to stick with his program.

Yoga for kids
Imagine that instead of playing softball and basketball
during PE in school, kids were asked to take a stab at
downward dogs and cobra poses (those are yoga
poses). Sounds like a total nonstarter for American kids,
right? (Maybe for kids back in the Dark Ages when the
baby boomers were trudging through snow to school
uphill both ways, but not anymore.)
In a surprising number of schools nationwide, yoga has
begun to make an appearance as an addition to — or in
a growing number of cases, a substitute for — traditional
sports during PE time. Think about it: Yoga requires no
expensive equipment; it’s accessible to both boys and
girls; it requires no large playing ﬁelds to maintain; and the
incidence of injury is low compared to football or soccer.
Documented beneﬁts are surprisingly numerous and
encouraging as well. Across the country teachers,
administrators, and happy parents report calmer, more
focused students, and in cases where the only differ-
ence was the introduction of regular yoga to the
curriculum, measurably higher grades — all as a result
of doing 5,000-year-old stretching moves and lying qui-
etly for a little while. Looks like ‘no pain, no gain’ has
ﬁnally been proven false, once and for all.
A great source of yoga instruction for young ones is any
of the titles in Marsha Wenig’s Yoga for Kids video series
(distributed by Gaiam)

Keep in mind that the attention span of children in this age group is a little shorter than that
of adults. Try to focus on only a few key stretches.
The following stretch routine (all stretches combined make the routine) is designed to
address all major muscles groups, and the workout only takes a few minutes. What’s more,
the following stretches are great for your kids no matter what they do. What really matters
is building body awareness and stretching regularly, which helps your kids now, and also in
the future.
Butterfly stretch
The butterﬂy stretch speciﬁcally targets the inner thigh and groin. This area is important for
kids to stretch because this is a common spot for injuries sustained in active play. I like this
stretch for this age group because not only is it fun, but also it is effective and easy to do.
It’s great in a team sports setting where kids can sit in a circle and face each other and talk
while holding the stretch.
Although this stretch is traditionally called the butterﬂy stretch, kids aren’t supposed to
ﬂap their knees like a butterﬂy — that type of move is called ballistic stretching, (for more
information about the different categories of stretches, see Chapter 1) and you don’t want
them to do that now. Remember, your goal is to improve kids’ ﬂexibility in their inner thigh
area, not rip the muscles off the bone.
To do this exercise, follow these steps:
1. Sit upright on the ﬂoor with your knees bent, the soles of your feet touching, and
your hands on the ﬂoor behind you (see Figure 14-5a).
Placing your buttocks against a wall may help you keep your back straight and prevent
you from rounding your back.
2. Place your hands on your feet or ankles and as you inhale, gently pull them as close
to your groin as you comfortably can.
3. Rest your elbows on your inner thighs, close to your knees.
4. As you exhale, lean forward from your hips (see Figure 14-5b).
Make sure that you keep your back straight and chest lifted. As you lower your chest
toward the ﬂoor, also gently press your knees down with your elbows.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.

Part IV: Getting Limber as You Live: Stretches for Various Life Stages 

A few do’s and don’ts for this exercise:
 Do keep your abdominals lifted.
 Do keep your shoulder blades down to help keep your chest lifted.
 Do think of your spine lengthening, not shortening. Imagine a string attached to the
crown of your head pulling you up and forward.
 Don’t round your back, the movement forward should come from your hips, not your back.
Modified hurdler stretch
Tight hamstrings can have a negative effect on your child’s ability to kick, run, and jump by
reducing their range of motion and exposing them to the risk of injury. So whether your
child plays a team sport or racquet sport, does gymnastics, takes dance classes, or just
likes to run around the playground, having ﬂexibility in the hamstrings is an advantage.
Use a towel with this stretch; it helps you keep your back straight while you lean forward. If
you can keep your back straight, you’ll have a better chance of stretching your hamstrings
(the back of your thighs) without straining your lower back.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the ﬂoor with your right leg straight and your left leg bent so the sole of your
foot is ﬂat against the inside of your right knee.
2. Place a towel around the ball of your right foot and hold on to both ends of the
towel (see Figure 14-6a).
3. As you exhale, hinge forward at the hip and gently pull on the towel to help you
lean forward without rounding your back (see Figure 14-6b).
Imagine your tailbone moving toward the back of the room and the heel of your
straight leg reaching toward the front of the room. This position should lengthen the
back of your leg from both directions. Your tailbone should be reaching back as you
hinge forward at the hips. Remember to keep the knee straight.
4. Breathe deeply as you hold the stretch for 30 seconds.
Deepen the stretch with each breath by tilting your pelvis back, lifting your chest, and
ﬂexing your foot so your toes are moving toward your shoulders.
5. Switch sides and repeat the same stretch on your other leg.
Don’t get discouraged if your chest is nowhere near your leg. As long as you’re feeling a
good deep stretch in the back of your thigh, and you’re keeping your back straight,
then you’re doing great!

Chapter 14: Family Fun: Kid-Friendly Stretches

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do gently hinge forward at your hips.
 Do keep your knee straight, and try to keep the back of your knee on the ﬂoor.
 Do keep your back straight, not rounded or tense in your shoulders.
 Don’t look down at your knee; look at the ﬂoor in front of your toes.
Straddle stretch 
This is my favorite stretch to help you achieve a perfect split!
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit up tall with your hands behind you for support and your legs straight out in front
of you.
2. Open your legs and move your feet away from each other (see Figure 14-7).
You should feel the stretch along your inner thighs.
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or for four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
To deepen the stretch you can place your hands on the inside of your thighs and gently
press your legs a little wider. Also, placing a small rolled towel under your hips can intensify
the stretch.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do progress through the stretch gradually and slowly.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.

Runner’s lunge
The runner’s lunge is one of the best stretches for anyone, not just for a runner. The exercise
targets three small hip muscles, which are called your iliopsoas or hip ﬂexors. This area can
get very tight if you engage in sports, because the hip ﬂexors are the muscles that lift your
knee or move your leg forward, such as kicking or walking or running or just about anything
that has to do with forward motion. Ironically, these muscles can also get tight and shorten
if you’ve been sitting at school all day.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Begin by standing with your feet spread about two feet apart, one foot in front and
one foot behind you.
2. Inhale and as you exhale, bend both knees until you can place both hands on the
ﬂoor directly behind your front heel (see Figure 14-8a).
3. Slide your rear foot back so you can lower your rear knee to the ﬂoor without put-
ting weight on that back knee cap (see Figure 14-8b).
4. Inhale again, and as you exhale, gently press the front of the hip of the back leg
toward the ﬂoor.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
6. Repeat the same stretch on the left side.
If this stretch is uncomfortable for you to get into, try doing it sitting on the edge of an exer-
cise bench to support your body weight with the thigh of the bent leg. Extend your back leg
behind you with the ball of your foot on the ﬂoor.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your chest lifted and your shoulder blades down.
 Do keep your front knee at a right angle directly over your front heel.
 Don’t jut your front knee forward, which places undue strain on your knee.
 Don’t put your weight on the kneecap of the leg behind you — your weight should be
supported on the softer part of your leg just above your kneecap.

Standing quad stretch
This is a great standing stretch that targets your quads (the muscles in the front of your
thigh). This practical and convenient stretch is great to do after you’ve been exercising out-
doors because you stand up to perform it.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall and place your right hand on a stable surface.
This surface can be a chair, wall, doorway, or fence — anything that’s sturdy and helps
you keep your balance as you put your weight on one leg.
2. As you inhale, lift your left knee forward and grab your ankle or top of your foot
with your left hand (see Figure 14-9a).
3. As you exhale, slowly lower your knee until it’s even with the knee of the standing
leg (see Figure 14-9b).
4. Gently support the foot behind you with your hand.
Focus on moving your knee back, not yanking your foot up to touch your buttocks.
Try to keep the inside of your thighs touching. To really feel this stretch correctly, try
to tuck your pelvis under and think about your tailbone moving toward the ﬂoor.
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
Have fun and try to make this a balance exercise as well. As you are holding the
stretch, try to let go of the stable surface and see if you can hold your balance as
you continue to stretch your quadriceps.

Part IV: Getting Limber as You Live: Stretches for Various Life Stages 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do stand up tall with your chest lifted, abs in, and shoulder blades down. This position
helps you feel the stretch correctly and practices good posture!
 Don’t put undue stress on your knee by forcing your foot up to touch your buttocks.
 Don’t let your bent knee move to the side; keep the insides of your legs touching.
Reaching down your back, elbows high
This traditional stretch for the back of your upper arm (your triceps) can be done sitting or
standing. To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall and raise your left arm and bend your elbow so your ﬁngers 
are reaching down your spine and your elbow is pointing upward (see
Figure 14-10a).
2. Place your right hand on your raised elbow, and as you exhale, gently press your
elbow back so your ﬁngers of your left hand reach farther down your spine (see
Figure 14-10b).
3. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
4. Repeat this stretch with your right arm.

Chapter 14: Family Fun: Kid-Friendly Stretches

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your eyes looking forward.
 Do try to walk your ﬁngertips farther down your back.
 Don’t arch your back.
 Don’t force or bounce the stretch.
Shoulder pull
The deltoid muscle is the muscle that wraps around the top of your shoulder joint. You use
it every time you lift your arm, so no matter what sport or activity you engage in, you prob-
ably use this muscle a lot.
Having ﬂexibility in your shoulder helps you swing a baseball bat better, improves your
stroke in tennis, and gives you a more powerful golf swing. This stretch can be done sitting,
standing, or lying down.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand up tall with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and your abdominals lifted.
2. Lift your right arm horizontally across your chest, and hook your left arm outside
your elbow (see Figure 14-11a).
3. Gently lower your right shoulder so it’s even with your left shoulder and use your
left arm to gently pull your right arm across your body (see Figure 14-11b).
5. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.

Part IV: Getting Limber as You Live: Stretches for Various Life Stages 

If your shoulders are extremely stiff or tight and you ﬁnd it difﬁcult to hook your arm over
your other arm, try doing this stretch lying on your back. Just drape your arm across your
body and let gravity do the work. You may ﬁnd it more comfortable.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do progress through the stretch gradually.
 Do stand up or sit up tall as you hold the stretch.
 Don’t let your shoulder lift or kink your neck.
 Don’t pull too forcefully.
Backward arch on a ball
You’ll love this stretch because it’s done on one of those large exercise balls, which adds a
fun element of balance. This stretch is mainly for the muscles of your chest, but it’s also a
great stretch for your abs.
If you have never used an exercise ball before, take a few minutes initially to get used to it.
At ﬁrst it may seem difﬁcult to keep your balance, but you’ll get use to it very fast. If you
still feel wobbly, you can perform this stretch next to a wall or exercise bench.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit upright on the ball.
2. Walk your feet two or three steps forward so you roll down on the ball to the point
where your shoulder blades are supported against the ball and your spine is in neu-
tral position.
3. Interlock your hands behind your head (see Figure 14-12a).
4. Inhale deeply and as you exhale, slowly lower your head toward the ball, letting
your elbows drop toward the sides of the ball (see Figure 14-12b).
You should feel this stretch in the upper chest area.
5. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and then release by lifting your head and walking
your feet back until you’re sitting upright on the ball again.
This stretch may feel so good that you may want to do it again, but you don’t have to.
If you like this stretch, check out other stretches using the ball in my book Exercise Balls For
Dummies (Wiley). It’s full of fun exercises, using a ball to both strengthen and stretch your
entire body.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do relax your neck and shoulders.
 Do keep your shoulder blades on the ball.
 Don’t bounce your elbows up and down.
 Don’t hold your breath!

 Figuring out your exercise limitations
 Stretching to increase your ﬂexibility
I
t’s an unavoidable fact of life that ﬂexibility diminishes with age. Studies paint a pretty
bleak picture: Over time, range of motion decreases in the neck, shoulders, back, hips,
ankles, and wrists. In other words, as you get older you lose range of motion in just about
every movement you make. This loss can affect a wide variety of everyday functions, such
as tying your shoes, reaching for something on the top shelf, or turning around in your car
to back out of the driveway.
Stretching, however, is a simple and powerful weapon to help you ﬁght the debilitating
effect of the passing years. Research has proven that stretching can signiﬁcantly improve
ﬂexibility in the older adult, which means that you don’t have to give in to the increasingly
rust in your joints.
Regular stretching is without a doubt one of the most important things you can do to keep
your body functioning as smoothly as possible. Stretching can’t turn back the clock, but it
can slow it down considerably.
Determining Your Limits and 
Recognizing Changes
People over age 65 represent the most rapidly growing group in the population (welcome,
baby boomers!). But the characteristics of the people in this age group can vary wildly
because of the many different degrees of health and ﬁtness of individuals in this age range.
So it would be incorrect to consider everyone over 65 as one group. Nevertheless, when it
comes to stretching, a couple of age-related factors go across the board:
 Your range of motion is smaller than it used to be. Because age-related changes in
muscle structure can lead to increased muscle stiffness, if you’re just starting a ﬂexibil-
ity program, your range of motion may be quite limited. To help determine your
present range of motion, see the Flexibility Self-Evaluation Worksheet in Chapter 3.
In light of your lessened range of motion, in order not to place too much stress on
already stiff muscles and joints, I recommend holding the stretches in this chapter for a
shorter amount of time than I regularly do, and then repeating the stretch. For exam-
ple, instead of holding a stretch for 30 seconds, hold it for 15 seconds, relax, and then
repeat the stretch. As you get more ﬂexible, you may want to then begin to hold the
stretches for longer; it’s all about listening to your body!

 Maintaining your balance isn’t so easy anymore. For this reason, I added a few props
for the following stretches, such as a chair or wall, to help add stability to each stretch.
 Medical issues are more of a concern. Take into account any preexisting medical
issues you may have, such as osteoporosis or arthritis, and discuss them with your
doctor. One good rule of thumb is that you should always feel better after stretching,
not worse.
A Stretch Routine to Help 
You Maintain Flexibility
The following stretches are speciﬁcally designed to be accessible to anyone — even some-
one with physical limitations due to age or injury. None of these moves requires you to get
down on the ground or to assume complicated positions. This full-body routine is simple
and straightforward and helps increase your range of motion from your head to your toes.
Back and shoulders stretch
Loss of range of motion and ﬂexibility in the shoulders and back can create functional limi-
tations in this area. Performing this stretch every day can help you maintain and even
increase range of motion in your shoulders and back.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand behind a chair and place your hands on the top of the chair.
2. Walk backward until your arms are straight and your knees are slightly bent. Keep
your feet shoulder-width apart (see Figure 15-1a).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, let your chest sink toward the ﬂoor until you feel the
stretch in your shoulders and back.
Keep your head level between your arms. Your eyes should be looking at the ﬂoor, not
at your shoes (see Figure 15-1b).
4. Hold the stretch for a few deep breaths or as long as is comfortable.
5. Walk your feet back toward the chair, slowly rounding your back until you’re upright.
6. Inhale and repeat the stretch one more time.

Part IV: Getting Limber as You Live: Stretches for Various Life Stages 

A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulder blades down and your upper body relaxed.
 Do keep your back straight, not rounded.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch; keep it gentle and slowly progress into a deeper stretch.
Standing side reach with chair for support
Using the back of a chair for support in the standing side reach stretch allows you to deepen
the stretch without risking losing your balance or reaching too far. Feel the stretch in your
shoulders, back, abs, and even the top part of your hip.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Stand with the back of your chair about a foot from your right side.
2. Place your right hand on the top of the back of the chair.
3. Stand with your feet about 12 to 14 inches apart, your knees slightly bent, and your
toes forward (see Figure 15-2a).
4. Inhale and reach your left arm directly overhead with your palm facing inward.
Use the muscles in your upper back to keep your shoulder blade down. This should
keep space between your shoulder and ear.
5. As you exhale, lean to the right, keeping your right hand on the back of the chair for
support and your hip and leg anchored to the ﬂoor (see Figure 15-2b).
6. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
7. Repeat on the other side.
If you notice tension in your shoulders, instead of reaching with a straight arm, keep your
elbow bent. The movement should come from your waist, not your shoulder.
A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do keep your shoulders and hips facing forward and your knees slightly bent.
 Do breathe through the stretch.
 Don’t hold the stretch if you feel tension or pain.

Seated hamstring stretch
The hamstrings (back of the thigh) are one of the tightest muscle groups for most people —
no matter what age you are. That’s why it’s so important to stretch the muscles of the lower
body regularly.
Make sure you’re in a chair without wheels, or else you’ll end up doing a headstand,
whether you like it or not. It’s important that the chair is sturdy and stable.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the edge of the seat of your chair and extend your left leg straight out in front
of you.
2. Flex your foot so your toes are moving toward you (see Figure 15-3a).
3. Keep your opposite leg bent with your foot ﬂat on the ﬂoor and your knee at a 90-
degree angle.
4. Inhale and sit up very straight, lengthening your spine.
5. As you exhale, slowly hinge at your hips and lean forward, tilting your hipbones for-
ward and your tailbone back toward the back of the chair (see Figure 15-3b).
6. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, deepening the stretch with every breath.
7. Switch sides and repeat the same stretch on your other leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do sit on the edge of the chair.
 Do keep your back straight at all times.
 Don’t tuck your pelvis under or sit on the cushy part of your buttocks.

Seated inner thigh and groin stretch
The inner thigh and groin area is often difﬁcult to stretch if you have tight hamstrings
or back muscles. By performing this stretch sitting in a chair, you’ll be able to isolate
the inner thigh more effectively and stretch this area without putting stress or strain on
your back.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit on the edge of your chair with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
2. Separate your knees as far apart as possible and make sure you sit up tall with your
back straight (see Figure 15-4a).
Your toes should be slightly pointing outward.
3. Place your elbows on the inside of your knees and gently push outward as you
exhale (see Figure 15-4b).
4. Hold for about 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
5. Repeat the stretch on your other leg.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do progress through the stretch gradually.
 Do keep your back straight and your shoulder blades down.
 Don’t bounce or force your knees to go wider.

Seated hip flexor and quadriceps stretch
Tight hip ﬂexors are often the cause of lower back pain. This handy stretch can target this
area without even getting out of your chair.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit close to the front edge of the chair and turn your body to face left and hold on to
the back of the chair with your left hand.
2. Reach your right foot back, allowing your right knee to move toward the ﬂoor (see
Figure 15-5a).
3. Tuck your pelvis slightly under by squeezing your buttocks of the back leg (see
Figure 15-5b).
4. Inhale and exhale as you hold for 15 to 30 seconds.
5. Repeat this stretch on the other leg.
Because you’re so close to the edge of the chair it’s important to never let go of the back of
the chair with your hand because you may fall off.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do breathe as you hold the stretch.
 Do hold on to the back of the chair.
 Do turn your body completely to the side.
 Do keep your shoulders directly above your hips.
 Don’t round or bend forward at your waist.

Seated spinal rotation
This stretch is excellent to increase the rotational movement in your spine, which in turn
may help you back out of the driveway easier!
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit up tall on a sturdy chair with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor and close together, knees
at a right angle.
2. Anchor your left hand on the back of the chair as you place your right hand on the
outside of your left thigh (see Figure 15-6).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, twist your torso to the left and look back over your shoulder.
4. Hold the stretch for about ten seconds.
Try to make a mental note of a stationary object you see that’s about at eye level.
5. Release the stretch and come back to center.
6. Inhale again and as you exhale, repeat the stretch on the same side.
Find the same object you were looking at, but this time try to ﬁnd another object that’s
past it.
7. Repeat the stretch series on the opposite side.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
 Do keep your knees and feet together and facing the front.
 Don’t force the stretch or pull too hard on the back of the chair.
 Don’t look down — ﬁnd an object that’s at eye level.

Wrist and forearm stretch
Keeping ﬂexible in your hands and wrists is important because a common attribute of the
aging process is a decrease in grip strength and a loss of small-motor dexterity — both of
which can be helped by this stretch. You’ll feel a stretch in the muscles of your wrists,
hands, and forearm.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit tall in your chair with your back straight and your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
Your shoulders should be relaxed and your abdominals lifted.
2. Inhale and extend your right arm forward about shoulder height with the palm up.
3. As you exhale, grab your ﬁngers with your left hand and gently pull your ﬁngers
back toward your body (see Figure 15-7a).
4. Release the stretch and rotate your arms so the palm of your hand is facing downward.
5. Inhale and use your left hand to gently press your palm toward your body (see
Figure 15-7b).
6. Hold this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds, breathing deeply throughout the stretch.
7. Repeat with the other arm.
A few do’s and don’t for this stretch:
 Do sit up tall with your feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor.
 Do keep your arms extended as you stretch the wrist.
 Don’t bounce or force the stretch.

Seated chest and front of shoulder stretch
Tight chest muscles and weak upper back muscles oftentimes cause excessive rounding of
the shoulders. Try this exercise to stretch out your chest and shoulders.
To do this stretch, follow these steps:
1. Sit up tall on the front edge of a chair.
2. Reach behind your back with both arms and link your forearms (see Figure 15-8).
3. Inhale and as you exhale, squeeze your shoulder blades together.
After several deep breaths, try to deepen the stretch by grabbing your opposite elbow
with your hands (see Figure 15-8).
4. Hold the stretch for about 30 seconds or four to ﬁve slow, deep breaths.
5. Repeat the same stretch with the other hand on top.
If your range of motion is limited in your shoulders, and/or you feel pain or discomfort, try
performing this stretch one arm at a time. Instead of grabbing both elbows at the same time,
reach only one arm across the midline of your back and with your other hand grab hold of
your wrist or forearm.
A few do’s and don’ts for this stretch:
 Do keep your eyes looking forward.
 Do maintain good posture throughout the stretch.
 Don’t let your back arch when you squeeze your shoulder blades together.

Got arthritis?
People used to believe that if they had arthritis they
shouldn’t exercise, but now exercise has become an
important part of treating the disease. Why? Because if
you don’t take care of the muscles that surround the joint,
range of motion will be lost and stiffness and pain increase.
The goal of people with arthritis should be to limit the
progression of the existing damage in the affected joint
or joints, which is most effectively accomplished by
strengthening and stretching the muscles that surround
the joints. The million dollar question, however, is how
much exercise should you do if you’re diagnosed with
arthritis? Generally, if you have a ﬂare-up in a joint, that’s
the time to rest and let your medication do its job. As the
inﬂammation decreases and the pain subsides, you can
gradually return to exercise. The key word is gradually.
If you experience pain, that’s your cue to stop.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he For Dummies crew has a hallowed tradition of
ending each book with a top-ten list, and in this book,
I end with two of them. In Chapter 16, I list ten common
aches and pains that stretching can help minimize or, in
some cases, actually prevent, and in Chapter 17, I show
you ten simple household items that can be great props to
help you get more out of stretching.

Chapter 16
Ten Common Aches and Pains 
and Stretches that Can Help
In this Chapter
 Listening to your body’s pains
 Stretching away the pain
S
tretching can help create a balance between strength and ﬂexibility, between opposing
muscle groups, between your left and right side, and between your mind and body
(that’s what’s meant by “mind, body connection”). Stretching can also help solve many of
the mechanical problems that create discomfort. Think of this balance as an organic pain
reliever, returning your body to its natural, pain-free state.
In this chapter, I cover ten signals from your body that parts of it may be out of balance.
Pain is your body’s way of telling you there’s a problem that needs to be ﬁxed. I suggest
that, in addition to all the tried-and-true methods of pain relief you’re used to — like warm
soaks and ice-cold packs — you consider stretching as a new, powerful tool in your pain
relief arsenal. Instead of reaching for that bottle of anti-inﬂammatory medication ﬁrst to
mask the problem, try a stretch or two.
Stretching is only one tool in the battle against pain, so if any of the conditions in this chap-
ter persist for longer than a couple of days, please consult your healthcare professional.
Bursitis and/or Tendonitis
Overuse injuries such as bursitis and tendonitis are the result of irritation within a joint
(whether from injury or misalignment) that causes inﬂammation. Bursitis is an inﬂammation
of the bursa — a type of connective tissue that cushions tendons and thereby helps prevent
friction between the tendon and the bone.
Bursitis can be caused by repetitive motion, or by compression, such as someone who
sleeps only on one side or wears tight shoes. Tendonitis, which is inﬂammation of the
tendon where the normal smooth gliding motion of the muscle disappears, is caused by
excessive use of a tendon, which can lead to microscopic tears in the collagen that makes
up the tendon. Either of these conditions can produce a painful irritation of the bursa, and
the result is pain and swelling.
The best prevention against these painful conditions is to keep the muscles around your
joints strong and ﬂexible to guard against any irritation occurring in the ﬁrst place.
Exercising at least three times a week helps keep your muscles strong, but you also need
to keep your joints ﬂexible. Gentle stretches keep the muscles stretchy, which can help
keep the pressure and pain away.

Nevertheless, if you’re already in pain, the ﬁrst thing you need to do is rest. Wait a few days;
after the pain goes away, you can safely begin to stretch the affected area.
If you suffer from joint pain as a result of arthritis, see Chapter 15 for some simple stretches
to help ease the pain. The stretches in Chapter 15 are designed for seniors, but if you have
arthritis at any age, those exercises will help relive your pain, too.
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful progressive condition caused by compression of a key
nerve in the wrist. Symptoms usually start gradually with pain, weakness, or numbness in
the hand and wrist and then radiate up the arm. As symptoms worsen, people may feel tin-
gling during the day, and decreased grip strength may make it difﬁcult to form a ﬁst, grasp
small objects, or perform other manual tasks.
If you have a job where you sit at your computer all day or you perform some type of 
repetitive motion with your hands, I suggest the wrist and forearm stretches in Chapter 4.
Perform those exercises several times a day as you take short little breaks from your job.
These stretches can play an important role in preventing carpal tunnel syndrome.
Indigestion
The causes of indigestion are many, but the solutions are few. Stretching can enhance the
digestive process by massaging the intestines and initiating muscular contractions in the
abdominal area, both of which can help move things along in there. Stretching is very effec-
tive in helping to reduce stress, which in turn calms your stomach.
But one cause of indigestion in particular is stress (see Chapter 10 for information on
stress and how it affects your body). Studies have shown that, in men, the “ﬁght-or-ﬂight”
response, instigated by stress, restricts blood ﬂow to the abdomen, reduces the production
of digestive enzymes, and slows the digestive process overall. These conditions result in
bloating, heartburn, and constipation.
Check out the “Stress” section later in this chapter, too.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
The weekend warrior
Many people like to play recreational sports or do home
improvement projects on the weekends. And face it; some-
times the weekend is the only time you have to do it. So
bursitis and tendonitis are common complaints of weekend
warriors because of the repetitive movements involved in
some sports and the lack of strength training and stretch-
ing during the week. The areas that most commonly
become inﬂamed are the shoulders, elbows, knees, hips,
ankles, and heels. If this sounds like something you may be
experiencing, I recommend sport-speciﬁc stretches, such
as those found in Chapter 12. Those stretches help prevent
tightness and keep the muscles around the joints you use
the most ﬂexible, which leads to a reduction in tension on
your tendons from tight muscles and less inﬂamed bursa.
Always stretch at least ﬁve to ten minutes after your activ-
ity,paying speciﬁc attention to the muscles you just worked.

Insomnia
Insomnia is the chronic inability to fall asleep or remain asleep for an adequate length of
time. In many cases, insomnia is a symptom of an underlying health problem, such as
depression, chronic pain, sleep apnea, or other breathing disorders. But more often than
not, insomnia is primarily stress related.
I recommend developing a bedtime ritual that starts with the stretches from Chapter 9 and
that may also include wind-down activities such as reading, talking, or breathing exercises
such as the ones in Chapter 8. These activities in combination can help calm your mind,
relax your muscles, and ease the day’s tension — all allowing you to rest more soundly.
Check out the “Stress” section later in this chapter, too.
Low Back Pain
Whether you’re sedentary or an elite athlete, tight muscles in your hips, thighs, and but-
tocks can affect you and actually put so much strain and stress on your lower back that the
result is lower back pain. One solution that’s been proven to be effective is regular stretching.
Check out Chapter 7 where you’ll ﬁnd a ton of stretches for the hips, thighs, and buttocks,
or if you’re feeling tightness in your lower back, try the routines in Chapter 6. The entire
chapter is dedicated to stretching out your lower back, and I also include a mini back mas-
sage that’s the best for relieving low back tightness.
Never forget — a healthy back is a strong and ﬂexible back.
Menstrual Cramps
One of the most natural, effective methods of relieving menstrual cramps is to ﬁrst apply
heat from either a warm bath or heating pad and then to engage in some mild stretching. I
recommend the stretches I describe in the beginning of Chapter 8. These stretches are very
gentle and focus on the pelvic region. If your period causes pain in your lower back, try
some of the stretches in Chapter 6 that focus speciﬁcally on that area.
Plantar Fasciitis
Plantar fasciitis (plan-tar fash-ee-ahy-tis) is an inﬂammation of a band of ﬁbrous tissue called
the fascia (fash-ee-uh) that runs along the bottom of your foot from the heel to the ball of
the foot, which is the plantar fascia.
If this area is a problem for you, I recommend stretching the plantar fascia, the Achilles tendon,
and all the muscles that attach to the Achilles tendon from the calf — the gastrocnemius and
the soleus. Check out the lower leg stretches in Chapter 7 for some help.
In the case of chronic irritation of this area, seek your doctor’s advice, which most likely
may include rest, ice, anti-inﬂammatory medicine, arch supports, or taping.
247
Chapter 16: Ten Common Aches and Pains and Stretches that Can Help

Sciatica
Sciatica (sigh-at-i-kuh) is pain along the sciatic nerve that’s usually caused by a herniated
disk of the lumbar region of the spine, and that pain is then radiated to the buttocks and to
the back of the thigh. Sometimes sciatica is more broadly deﬁned as pain in the lower back,
buttocks, hips, or adjacent parts.
The sciatic nerve travels just under or even sometimes through the piriformis muscle, a
small muscle way down deep inside the buttocks that helps the thigh rotate outward. If the
piriformis becomes tight, it can irritate or constrict the sciatic nerve, causing symptoms
much like actual sciatica.
My favorite piriformis muscle stretch is in Chapter 9 (lying buttocks and hip stretch). It’s a
heck of a lot cheaper than a visit to the doctor, and it just might do the trick, which means
you never had sciatica in the ﬁrst place. However, if the pain persists for more than four
days, you’ll have to pay a visit to your doctor after all (and probably shell out some bucks).
Stress
If stress is a constant harsh buzz of daily activity, then think of stretching as a slow, quiet
Sunday afternoon you can enjoy any time you like to relieve your stress. The methodical
movements in a good ﬂexibility program — like the stretches in Chapter 10 — provide
simple, easy activities as you position your body for the next stretch. And then the
stretches are followed by periods of quiet stillness as you hold the stretch.
Try concentrating fully on the muscles that you’re stretching. This focus helps block out
any stray, stress-inducing thoughts. Also, the deep, regular breathing that’s so important to
effective stretching helps oxygenate your blood, which produces a reduction in overall
stress and anxiety.
Tension Headaches
Tension headaches are caused by tight, knotted muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and
jaw. These aches tend to occur on both sides of your head and start at the back of your
skull and spread forward. The pain is often dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice.
In addition, your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight and sore. To help relieve tension
headaches with a series of neck stretches, see Chapter 4.
This tightness is often related to stress, depression, or anxiety, but there can be speciﬁc
physiological causes as well:
 Holding your head in one position for a long time — sitting for an extended period in
front of a computer, a microscope, or even a video game
 Poor sleep position
 Overexerting yourself
 Clenching or grinding your teeth
If you tend to get tension headaches, stretching the shoulders and neck helps relax and
relieve the tension in your muscles before they cause the headache, and then you can
attack the pain before it begins. Stretching won’t get your boss off your back, but it can help
you stay relaxed whenever he’s around.

Chapter 17
Ten Surprising Around-the-House
Stretching Accessories
In This Chapter
 Beneﬁts of spontaneous stretching
 Ten household items to help you stretch
E
xperts support the fact that stretching before and after physical exercise is important,
but it’s also extremely helpful to spontaneously stretch throughout the day. Why?
Because stretching this and that, here and there, provides several crucial beneﬁts:
 Energizes you: When you need an energy boost, and there’s no coffee or chocolate in
sight, try a stretch or two to get oxygen to your brain. You’ll feel great, and you’ll skip
the calories!
 Maintains current range of motion: Even though you’re short on time and you missed
your stretch class, performing stretches throughout the day helps maintain the range
of motion in your joints that you’ve worked so hard to achieve.
 Relieves minor aches and pains: Stretching can relieve the stress and tension created
by inactivity or repetitive motion.
So any time can be the right time to stretch when you’re at home. And believe it or not
your home is full of stretching aids that help you stretch out and feel great. This chapter
describes my top-ten stretching props that are commonly found in the average home and
instructions on how to use them. Face it: You’re surrounded. Now you really have no excuse
not to stretch!
A Big, Thick Book
Sit on a big book (about the thickness of the average phone book) instead of on the ﬂoor
when you perform sitting stretches. The book lifts your hips off the ﬂoor just enough to take
away some of the stress and strain of a tight lower back. And when you don’t feel that
strain, you can focus more on stretching your hamstrings or inner thighs without rounding
your back. Try some of the sitting stretches described in Chapter 7 while sitting on a book,
and you should notice how much easier it is to keep your back straight.
After you’ve gotten proﬁcient at stretching your calves, as described in Chapter 7, you can
stand with your heels on the phone book to accentuate the calf stretch.

A Chair
Sitting in a chair too long and too often doesn’t loosen and relax your muscles; it shortens
certain muscles such as your hamstrings, hip ﬂexors, and calves. Nevertheless, a chair can
be a very useful and effective stretching prop. I bet you have a chair in just about every
room of the house, so as a stretching prop, a chair is extremely accessible. Check out
Chapter 10 and Chapter 15 where you use a chair for balance and support with some excel-
lent stretches.
Be careful, especially at work, that the chair you use doesn’t have wheels as many computer
chairs do. You can use any type of chair as long as it’s sturdy and stable.
A Ceiling Beam in Your House or Garage
If you’ve seen Rocky (and who hasn’t?), you know by now that you can hang from an open
beam in your house or garage to stretch out your back. At ﬁrst you may only be able to hold
on for a few seconds, but as your grip gets stronger, you’ll be able to stay on just long
enough to really feel the stretch in your shoulders and back. And every time you do, you’ll
feel like you’re an inch taller.
If you have trouble with this stretch, you may be able to put a chair beneath or beside you
to help you “unload.”
A Sofa
Although most people think of a couch as primarily being a good place for potatoes to grow
roots, believe it or not, your couch can also be a perfect stretching prop because
 It’s comfortable, so it can help you stay relaxed.
 It’s off the ﬂoor, so it’s not awkward to get into a lot of different positions.
 You’re probably sitting on one right now!
Try the AM/PM stretches I describe in Chapter 9, using the couch instead of the bed.
A Desk
At work it’s probably not very professional to put your foot up on your desk, but at home
your desk can be an excellent stretching prop.
If you don’t have a desk handy, you can do this stretch, using your dining room table or
even a hip-high windowsill.
1. Stand in front of your desk and place your right foot on the edge of the desktop.
2. Place your hands on the desk and lean forward so your right knee bends and you
feel the stretch in your hamstring/buttocks of your right leg and your hip ﬂexor of
your left leg.
250
Part V: The Part of Tens 

3. Now step back with your left leg a little from the desk so you can straighten your
right leg.
Feel a great stretch in the back of your right thigh as you inhale deeply and then exhale.
4. Repeat the stretch with the left leg.
A Doorway
I’ve found that a doorway is a great stretching prop because it’s both wonderfully stable
and large enough to have many different applications.
Try this shoulder stretch, using your doorway:
1. Grab onto the molding over the top of the door with your ﬁngertips.
2. Bend your knees slightly but keep your feet on the ﬂoor until you feel a stretch in
your shoulders.
If you’re not tall enough to reach the top of the door, you can use a step stool.
Fireplace Tools
Your ﬁreplace tools don’t have to be only decorative anymore; they can actually be great
stretching props, too. Using the ﬁreplace tools enhances the effectiveness of the stretch
because it adds weight and stability to the movement, allowing you to deepen the stretch,
maintain proper posture, and focus on individual muscles.
Try this out:
1. Pick up either the poker or broom and grab hold of each end with your hands at
chest level.
2. Twist to the right and left ﬁve times each at a slow rhythmic pace to warm up your
torso for more vigorous exercise.
Holding both ends of the poker or broom and then raising it over your head is a great
stretch for your shoulders. Add a side bend and you now have a stretch for your waist, too.
A Towel
Although I highly recommend buying a stretching strap to help you with your ﬂexibility pro-
gram, there’s nothing wrong with using the low-cost option of a bath towel or smaller hand
towel to help you achieve a comfortable stretch. It doesn’t matter whether you’re attempt-
ing a stretch for the upper or the lower body, using a towel to increase your reach makes
the stretch more comfortable. See Chapter 4 or Chapter 7 for a few examples of stretches
you can do with a towel.
251
Chapter 17: Ten Surprising Around-the-House Stretching Accessories

A Porch Step
Every time you walk into your house with tired feet and tight calves from standing all day or
from wearing high heels, you may not realize that you have just walked over the perfect
stretching prop to address your aches and pains. Actually, any step is a great place to stretch
out your calves, whether on your staircase, your porch, or anywhere else in your house.
Here’s how you can use the step to your advantage:
1. Stand on the step with only the ball of your right foot pressed down as your left foot
remains beside it.
Make sure that you hold onto a railing or something stable to keep you from falling
backwards off the step.
2. Inhale and as you exhale, slowly lower your heel until you feel a comfortable
stretch in your calf.
3. Hold the stretch for 10 to 15 seconds.
As you breathe, try to gently drop your heel a little lower until you feel a deeper
stretch in your calf.
4. Repeat the stretch on your other leg.
An excellent variation to help you stretch an even deeper muscle in your calf (the soleus) is
to slightly bend the knee of the leg you’re stretching. You should feel this variation at the
base of your calf.
A Wall
You can use a wall with any stretch that can beneﬁt from ﬁrm, stable support. It’s smooth
and wide, and (I know this sounds a little obvious) adjacent to the ﬂoor. It is precisely the
fact that a wall is adjacent to the ﬂoor that offers you two ﬁrm, stable sources of support.
For instance, the lying straddle stretch described in Chapter 14 allows you to lie on the ﬂoor
while your legs are propped up against the wall. This makes the stretch nearly effortless
because gravity does all the work.
