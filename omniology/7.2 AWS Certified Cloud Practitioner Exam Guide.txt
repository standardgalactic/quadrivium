Exam content 
Response types 
There are two types of questions on the exam:  
 
Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors) 
 
Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options 
Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or 
incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose. 
Distractors are generally plausible responses that match the content area. 
Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes 50 
questions that will affect your score. 
Unscored content 
The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about 
candidate performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these questions for future use as scored 
questions. These unscored questions are not identified on the exam.  
Exam results 
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is a pass or fail exam. The exam is scored against a minimum 
standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines.  
Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum passing score is 700. 
Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether or not you passed. Scaled 
scoring models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty 
levels.  
Your score report may contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. This 
information is intended to provide general feedback about your exam performance. The exam uses a 
compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each 
section. You need to pass only the overall exam. 
Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than others. The 
table contains general information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when 
interpreting section-level feedback.  
Content outline 
This exam guide includes weightings, test domains, and objectives for the exam. It is not a comprehensive 
listing of the content on the exam. However, additional context for each of the objectives is available to 
help guide your preparation for the exam. The following table lists the main content domains and their 
weightings. The table precedes the complete exam content outline, which includes the additional context. 
The percentage in each domain represents only scored content.
