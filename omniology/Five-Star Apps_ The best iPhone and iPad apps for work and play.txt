FIVE-STAR APPS ///

/// INTRODUCTION
What makes a ﬁve-star app? A program 
has to be interesting, even if the task 
it’s performing is routine. When you 
look at a dozen apps that have the same 
informational, utilitarian, or entertain-
ment goal, ﬁve-star apps have that extra 
something special that ﬂoats to the top.
In reading thousands of recommenda-
tions, testing hundreds of apps, and then 
choosing the set that appears in this 
book, I found that the best apps were 
ones that surprised me and charmed 
me, even for ordinary tasks.
A good example is Ocarina, an early 
iPhone app that continues to be a best-
seller more than two years after the 
introduction of the App Store. 
Anyone could have come up with a 
pedestrian ocarina program, in which 
you blow into the microphone to simu-
late breath going into the ancient musi-
cal instrument with onscreen buttons 
controlling ﬁnger positions.
What Ge Wang and his Smule team 
brought to Ocarina was depth, discovery, 
charm, and a community. The more you 
use Ocarina, the better you can become 
at it. Dig at the program and you can set 
a different key or musical mode. Tap a 
global icon and see—and hear!—other 
people playing the program worldwide. 
Go online and ﬁnd transcribed scores in 
Ocarina notation to play yourself. 
It’s not just an app; it’s a small universe.
Not every app is Ocarina, but every pro-
gram in this book has some combination 
of stellar qualities: a high degree of ﬁn-
ish (interface, graphics, and program 
action), utility (at a task, at having fun, 
at facilitating creativity or learning), and 
persistence.
That last point is a key one. For ﬁve-star 
apps, the developer keeps tweaking 
and updating the program to add more 
features and ﬁx things that aren’t right, 
He or she tries to bring to the app more 
of what existing users want, and what 
might make the program more appeal-
ing to new users.
The other aspect of my personal ﬁve-
star apps is that they rarely average 
more than 3½ to 4 stars on Apple’s App 
Store rating system. That struck me 
as odd when I started researching the 
book. Fabulous programs—universally 
well reviewed by magazines and Web 
sites, with great word of mouth, and 
which tested well for me—had a lot of 
“meh” in the reviews.
That’s partly the vagary of reviewers and 
partly an outcome of Apple’s review sys-
tem. Five stars may seem like too many; 
three or four fairer. And, before iOS 4, 
Apple asked for ratings whenever an 
app was deleted, hardly a great time to 
get an opinion. It was also easy to mis-
tap and rate an app with a single star. 
Reviewers also complain after purchase 
about the cost of apps. I used quality, not 
price, as a factor in picking app.
For this book, ﬁve stars are what I give 
all the apps in it using my own personal 
rating system. I hope you’ll agree—and 
tell me about your own ﬁve-star apps.

USING APPS IN IOS ///
xii
/// FIVE-STAR APPS
While using an iPhone, iPad, or iPod 
touch is a thing of simplicity not to be 
rivaled in the history of mankind—
where’s the mild sarcasm font?—it’s 
helpful to know some background infor-
mation about apps in particular and iOS 
in general. Which apps work on which 
devices? What’s this Game Center app 
that’s on my home screen? How do I 
move ﬁles back and forth to a computer? 
And more. Read on!
What’s iOS?
iOS is the operating system that han-
dles all of the interaction and hardware 
control on an iPhone, iPad, and iPod 
touch. iOS was called iPhone OS for 
some time before the iPad was released, 
even though it worked on the iPod touch 
as well.
Apple decided to avoid confusion by 
shortening the name. iOS isn’t an abbre-
viation for anything; it’s just marketing.
At this writing iOS 4.2 is just being 
released for all three kinds of devices.
Compatibility
Not all apps run the same way on all iOS 
devices. Apps have one of three kinds 
of compatibility, which is listed in the 
iTunes Store for every program.
Open http://5str.us/vwx, for instance, 
and look below the price, release date, 
and other information. You’ll see a block 
of text that starts with “Requirements.”
This text is a little confusing, because 
Apple uses so many different versions of 
it. You can rely on the description to tell 
you whether or not an app will work on a 
given iOS device, and the minimum ver-
sion of iOS required.
I made sure every app in this book 
works with iOS 4. Some apps may not 
launch on versions earlier than iOS 4 
because of special features required to 
make the program work.
I use a pair of icons in the book to show 
this compatibility at a glance. The left 
member is larger than its partner to 
the right. The left icon represents an 
iPad; the littler one, an iPhone and iPod 
touch. I mark icons red for not compat-
ible, green for apps designed for a given 
device, and blue for compatible in a spe-
cial mode. Let’s look at each further:
Compatible with iPhone, iPod touch, 
and iPad: These apps are designed for 
the iPhone/iPod touch screen size, but 
will work in a special mode on the iPad. 
The app’s screen is centered on an iPad 
at its iPhone/iPod touch size, but a tap 
of a 2x button in the corner doubles the 
size in both dimensions. It’s not ideal, as 
most graphics become pixillated, and 
taps aren’t captured perfectly in games.
Using Apps in iOS

/// USING APPS IN IOS
Compatible with iPad: Such apps are 
designed for the iPad, and cannot be 
installed on an iPhone or iPad touch. 
Many apps, especially games, come 
in two versions: one designed for the 
iPhone/iPod touch and the other an 
iPad-only version, often with “HD” in its 
name. This compatibility type is often 
described as “iPad only.”
“This app is designed for both iPhone 
and iPad”: A program that takes advan-
tage of both sized displays, showing 
an interface and graphics appropriate 
to the device on which it’s installed. 
Despite saying “iPhone,” such apps also 
work on the iPod touch. This kind of 
compatibility is often called “universal.” 
In the iTunes Store, on the app’s detail 
page, a 
(plus sign) appears next to 
the price and an additional label appears 
below the price as well as the “require-
ments” information even further below.
In some cases, apps have even stricter 
requirements. Some programs will only 
run if the device has a camera built in, 
which means an iPhone or a 4th-genera-
tion iPod touch. And some of those apps 
can’t work with an iPhone older than the 
3GS (2009) model. A few ﬂashlight pro-
grams rely on the LED ﬂash that’s only 
found in the iPhone 4 at this writing.
Other apps need a fast processor to 
carry out their tasks, which means an 
iPad, iPhone 4, or 4th-generation iPod 
touch. These requirements are often 
noted in small type.
I call out exceptions to the compatibility 
guidelines for each app as applicable.
Links & Prices
Next to every app’s name in the book, as 
well as in notes and elsewhere, you will 
see links that look like:
http://5str.us/x2m
These links are shortcuts that I set up 
to take you straight to the destination, 
whether it’s an app or a search result on 
the iTunes Store, or a link elsewhere.
Prices are listed with every app, but 
my experience is that they change con-
stantly for sales and competition.
Background
iOS 4 added the capability for apps to 
keep running in a limited fashion when 
you switched to another program, 
answered a phone call, or pressed the 
home button.
The three main kinds of app-related 
tasks that can be performed in the back-
ground are:
Audio: A music, podcast, or other audio 
playback program can continue to play 
audio.
Location: GPS navigators and other apps 
can continue to update your location 
in their internal map even though they 
can’t display the current position. Voice 
navigation can continue, however, and 
push notiﬁcations if a phone call is un.
VoIP: An in-progress Internet telephone 
call can continue uninterrupted, and 
you can receive calls even when the app 
isn’t in the foreground, or your device’s 
screen is locked. This includes Skype (p. 
106) and Line2 (p. 107).

USING APPS IN IOS ///

/// FIVE-STAR APPS
For apps that offer audio, navigation, 
and VoIP, I explain the speciﬁc back-
ground features supported.
Only iOS devices released starting in 
2009 can let apps use background tasks. 
That’s the iPhone 3GS and 4, the 3rd-
and 4th-generation iPod touch, and all 
iPad models.
Game Center
Game Center for iOS 4.1 appeared as 
this book was in preparation, and many 
of the games and other programs involv-
ing buddy lists still needed to be updated 
to support the new feature when we 
went to press.
Game Center hooks you up with your 
friends. It’s a social network, but unfor-
tunately not linked into Facebook, 
Twitter, or even Apple’s Ping as I write 
this. And you can’t search for friends; 
you have to ask them for their handles. 
These aspects need improvement.
But Game Center is a nifty way to com-
pare scores on leaderboards, and play 
live multiplayer games over the Internet. 
I expect that we’ll see thousands of 
games link in to Game Center, because 
it allows developers to avoid having to 
build their own networks for games.
For games that have components in 
desktop Mac and Windows software, on 
Web sites, and via other mobile plat-
forms, you might see a Game Center 
option and a tie-in to these programs’ 
own networks, too.
Installing Apps
You have two ways to add apps to an iOS 
device: through iTunes and through the 
App Store program on the device.
In either case, you need an iTunes Store 
account, which was also required when 
you set up your iOS device. However, 
you can create a new account for pur-
poses of purchasing and syncing. The 
iTunes account needs to have a payment 
method associated with it, too.
The App Store lists each program’s price 
and download size. Some programs are 
tiny, under a few megabytes; others may 
be as big as 2 gigabytes (GB), like navi-
gation software. 
Apple only lets you download apps up to 
20 megabytes (MB) in size over a 3G net-
work. However, those sub-20 MB chunks 
add up. If you have a limited data plan 
(200 MB), you may want to avoid app 
downloads except while connected to a 
Wi-Fi network.
With every review or software refer-
ence in the book, this book lists a short 
URL. You can type in that URL and be 
redirected to the app in question without 
going through additional steps. You can 
also go to http://5str.us/ and enter the 
short code for the same result. The links 
launch iTunes in Mac OS X or Windows, 
or the App Store app when using iOS’s 
Mobile Safari.

that can get out of hand if you buy a lot 
of apps. (My library now contains hun-
dreds of apps, and I don’t want them on 
every device I own.)
Or, you can select individual apps and 
add them to a given device’s app line-up. 
iTunes also lets you rearrange apps on 
home screens, organize them into fold-
ers, and move ﬁles back and forth for 
certain apps (see iTunes File Sharing.)
With a device plugged in, select it by 
name in the left sidebar under Devices. 
Then click the Apps tab in the main 
iTunes window. With Sync Apps checked 
at the top, you can check or uncheck 
Automatically Sync New Apps to control 
that behavior. 
With that new apps sync box unchecked, 
check the box next to an app in the list 
to add it to the device; or uncheck the 
box to remove it. You can also drag apps 
around the screens, drag apps off the 
screen, or drag apps into a screen. 
Click Sync at the end to match every-
thing up.
App Store App
Instead of using iTunes on a computer, 
you can use the App Store app—prein-
stalled on every iOS device—to purchase 
software so long as you are connected 
to an active network. 
You can follow a link in Mobile Safari, or 
launch the app directly. Tap App Store’s  
Search tab, and type in the name of a 
program you want. Select the app, and 
tap the Free or price button to obtain it; 
the button changes to Install, which you 
tap again to complete the transaction. 
iOS prompts you to enter your iTunes 
Store password.
In-app purchases are add-ons for a 
program that you buy after installing 
the software. These purchases are 
sometimes available within settings; 
other times, a popup window suggests 
you buy something! Add-ons can include 
rocket ships for games, subscriptions 
for services, or a fee to remove adver-
tising, depending on the software. Your 
iTunes Store account is used for these 
purchases.
iTunes on the Desktop
You must pick a single computer to 
which you synchronize your apps, mov-
ies, music, and other media. That copy 
of iTunes is where you will make your 
app purchases. It’s also where apps are 
copied the next time you sync following 
the purchase of programs on an iPhone, 
iPad, or iPod touch.
You can buy or obtain free apps by 
launching iTunes with or without an iOS 
device plugged in. Click the iTunes Store 
item in the left sidebar under the Store 
label. You can use the search ﬁeld in the 
upper-right corner to ﬁnd apps by name, 
or browse by category, featured, and 
best-selling programs.
To buy an app with a fee attached or 
download a free app, click the price 
or the Free App label. If you haven’t 
recently logged in to iTunes, the pro-
gram prompts you for your password.
The app is downloaded into a folder on 
your computer, and is now available 
to sync with any iOS device linked to 
the same iTunes Store account on that 
computer. (An unlimited number of iOS 
devices may link to the same account.)
You can set your iOS device to add any 
new software you purchase, although

Unfortunately, many apps have options 
both within themselves and in the 
Settings app. (The Settings app in some 
of these cases contains just an app reset 
or debugging switch, however.)
Elsewhere. Some apps also hide set-
tings elsewhere, such as an Options but-
ton or other label when you’re starting a 
game or adding an item to a list.
iTunes File 
Sharing
iTunes is more than just a conduit for 
syncing apps and media with an iOS 
device: it can also let you manage which 
ﬁles are associated with apps like 
GoodReader, Air Sharing, ComicZeal, 
and many others.
To add, remove, or download ﬁles this 
way, follow these steps:
1. Connect your mobile device to a com-
puter with iTunes.
2. Launch or switch to iTunes.
The app will now start to download if 
you’re on Wi-Fi, or if it’s under 20 MB 
and you’re connected to 3G on an iPhone 
or 3G iPad. (You can still buy larger apps 
over 3G, but downloads won’t start until 
you’re next connected to Wi-Fi.)
Warning! After you enter your iTunes 
Store password, your iOS device 
remains logged in for several minutes. 
This can be a problem if you hand your 
phone off to someone else, like a child, 
who then proceeds without malice to 
make in-app purchases. Online forums 
are rife with complaints about “free” 
apps that have in-app purchases for 
add-on packs.
You can log out to prevent these pur-
chases. The setting is a bit hidden. From 
the Featured tab, scroll way down to the 
bottom, where  you ﬁnd the Account but-
ton. Tap that button, and tap Sign Out. 
Finding Settings
App settings can be located in one of two 
main places, but are sometimes hidden 
elsewhere. This can be frustrating.
Within the app. Many apps that have 
options to set (such as entering a user 
name and password, or toggling on and 
off background music) use a gear icon to 
provide access. Tap the gear, and then 
change settings.
In the Settings app. Launch the Settings 
app, and swipe downwards. There, you’ll 
ﬁnd all the apps that choose to depend 
on the Settings app for conﬁguration 
options. Tap on an app’s name to make 
changes.

WebDAV File 
Sharing
Several apps use WebDAV to allow 
access to ﬁles and folders by other 
computers and devices connected to the 
same network. Mac OS X and Windows 
have built-in WebDAV access.
WebDAV works over a local network 
to other computers connected to the 
same network. That means that your iOS 
device has to be connected via Wi-Fi to 
a network, and any computer that wants 
to access the device has to be connected 
via Wi-Fi or Ethernet to the same net-
work. WebDAV doesn’t allow your iOS 
device to share its ﬁles over 3G.
To use WebDAV, ﬁrst start the ﬁle-
sharing software on your iOS device in 
whatever app you’re using. Some apps 
keep WebDAV active for as long as the 
program is in the foreground, like Air 
Sharing Pro. Others, like GoodReader, 
require that you tap a button to start 
WebDAV service.
3. Select your device from the Devices 
list in iTunes in the sidebar.
4. Click the Apps tab at top.
5. Scroll down within the tab to File 
Sharing.
At left, the Apps list displays any pro-
grams that can have ﬁles moved in and 
out in this way. Select an app and the 
Documents list at right shows every-
thing stored with that program.
ǩClick Add to select ﬁles from a selec-
tion dialog box. You can also drag ﬁles 
from the desktop into the Documents 
list.
ǩSelect a ﬁle or folder and press Delete 
to remove items.
ǩSelect a ﬁle or folder and click Save To 
to make a copy on your hard drive.
Unfortunately, you can’t navigate down 
through folders in the list to retrieve, 
add, or delete items within them.

The app should show you a numeric 
address or other name by which you 
can access your iOS device. The number 
is typically in the form 10.0.1.25:8080.
You’ll need that number.
WebDAV servers only run as long as the 
program is active. For some apps, you 
tap Close or exit a pop-up or popover 
menu, and that halts the WebDAV server. 
With other apps, exiting the program 
turns off the server.
In any of those cases, however, that 
causes the shared information to 
becomes immediately unavailable. It’s 
best to unmount a volume from a Mac  
or make sure all ﬁle transfers are com-
pleted under Windows before turning off 
the WebDAV server.
Here’s how to connect to your device 
from Mac OS X and Windows.
From a Mac:
1. In the Finder, select Go > Connect 
to Server (Command-K). Enter the 
address in the form:
http://10.0.1.10:8080
substituting whatever address the app 
provides. (The dot and extra number 
mark a “port,” which lets multiple 
servers work on the device at once.)
2. Click OK. 
3. You should be prompted to enter a 
username and password. If you set 
one in the app, enter that information; 
otherwise, just click OK.
The app’s shared ﬁles show up just like 
another hard drive on your Desktop. 
Double-click to open the drive. You 
should be able to copy ﬁles to and from 
the drive and delete ﬁles.
To unmount the drive from your 
Desktop, ﬁrst select it, and then choose 
the File menu’s Eject item.
From Windows (XP, Vista, and 7).
Follow these steps to mount a WebDAV 
server for ﬁle access.
1. Right-click the Computer icon on your 
desktop, and select Map Network 
Drive. (If the computer icon isn’t on 
your desktop, right-click the Windows 
button at the lower left and select 
Windows Explorer.)
2. Click the link at the bottom, “Connect 
to a Web site that you can use to 
store your documents and pictures.” 
The Add Network Location wizard 
launches.
3. Click Next.
4. Click Choose a Custom Network 
Location, then click Next.
5. Enter the address of the app’s 
WebDAV server, such as 
http://10.0.1.25:8080
and click Next. You may need to wait a 
moment for the next step to ﬁnish.
6. Type a name that identiﬁes the app’s 
server, such as iPad server. Click 
Next.
7. Click Finish.

Acknowledgements
I could not have written and produced 
this book without the help and encour-
agement of many others. 
My father, Charles Fleishman, was my 
primary copyeditor, and acted as sense 
checker: he’s a relatively new iPhone 
4 owner and long-time Mac user. Lex 
Friedman, who I met via Twitter through 
colleagues, provided exceptional last-
stage editing and technical review. 
My wife, Lynn Warner, gave me critical 
feedback in planning the book and read 
for sense. My children, Ben and Rex, 
who you will see in photos throughout 
this title, coped with me being less avail-
able for extended periods during part of 
the book’s creation—because I prom-
ised them they would appear in photos 
throughout the book.
In my shared ofﬁce, long-time col-
league Jeff Carlson (himself ﬁnishing 
two books at the same time to my one) 
was a touchstone for sanity and humor. 
Old friend David Blatner helped me put 
InDesign CS5 in its place.
At Peachpit, Tracey Croom kept produc-
tion moving smoothly, while editor Cliff 
Colby was a specialist in the soothing 
and encouraging phone call.
My thanks, also, to the hundreds of peo-
ple who suggested apps for the book and 
took the time to explain why they liked a 
given program.
This book was produced under the inﬂu-
ence of Glenn Gould, The Police, and 
They Might Be Giants.
I love to hear from readers. You can 
email me at glenn@5str.us or follow me 
on twitter @glennf.
A window will open on the desktop with 
the share which works just like any hard 
drive. 
Windows isn’t as concerned about 
unmounting WebDAV volumes, and 
there’s no way to eject or disconnect 
a mounted volume. Just make sure 
you don’t open a ﬁle directly from the 
server’s folder; copy it to your computer 
ﬁrst.
iOS Supported 
File Formats
iOS has a long list of image, audio, docu-
ment, and video ﬁle formats that it can 
read natively—the operating system has 
all the built-in support to display or play 
the ﬁles in the way they were intended. 
Any app that’s written to display docu-
ments or images or play back media 
can use any of those types with no extra 
work by the programmer.
Supported formats include popular for-
mats such as PDF and Microsoft Word, 
but also a number of more obscurely 
named audio and video standards. 
It’s quite hard to know from looking at a 
media ﬁle you want to access—its exten-
sion or other details—whether or not it 
will work under iOS. In the Video section 
of the book, I review two apps that are 
designed to convert and play back just 
about any kind of audio and video ﬁle to 
get around this limitation.
You can ﬁnd a full list of the ﬁle types 
that iOS supports at http://5str.us/ppm;

Audio Playback.

Read and buy ebooks and read PDFs with a booky feel
iBooks is Apple’s entry into the some-
what crowded ebook reader app market. 
Designed ﬁrst for the iPad, and then 
brought over to the iPhone and iPod 
touch, iBooks tries to capture the nature 
of books while making it easy to scan 
through pages, bookmark, make notes, 
and search.
You acquire books in one of three ways. 
First up is Apple’s online iBookstore, 
still rather modest at this writing com-
pared to those offered by Amazon and 
Barnes & Noble. Apple includes free 
books from Project Gutenberg and other 
sources, as well as commercial ﬁction 
and nonﬁction. (The iBookstore is reach-
able only through an iOS device.)
Unprotected EPUB ﬁles can be 
imported, too; EPUB is a publishing-
industry standard for producing books 
that can have fonts and formatting 
resized without losing images attached 
to various parts of the book. EPUB ﬁles 
have to be copied to iBooks via iTunes 
(see p. xv) instead of opened in iOS.
Finally, iBooks can also store and read 
PDF ﬁles, which can be copied over 
from many apps (through the Open With 
option), or managed via iTunes. There 
are better PDF readers than iBooks 
(such as GoodReader and Air Sharing), 
but iBooks does a perfectly good job.
Books and PDFs appear in a faux book-
shelf; the Books/PDFs tabs appear only 
if you have PDFs loaded. Tap a book to 
open it. (If you don’t see a book you’ve 
purchased or obtained at no cost from 
the iBooks store, tap the Store button, 
and then tap the Purchases icon at lower 
right to download missing items.) 
BOOKS ///
2 
/// READING

You can opt to read in either portrait 
or landscape orientation, and the book 
reﬂows for direction. On an iPad, the 
landscape view breaks a book into two 
side-by-side pages.
iBooks lets you change attributes of 
the page, such as the typeface and size. 
You can also adjust brightness directly 
in the app, bookmark pages for later 
reference, highlight ranges of text and 
images, and leave notes in the text.
Books can be searched for keywords; 
the same pane that shows the results 
lets you jump to perform a query at 
Google and Wikipedia for the same 
words in Mobile Safari.
Your iTunes Store account is used to 
manage ownership for books you pur-
chase, but it also handles syncing notes, 
bookmarks, and highlights across all 
your iOS devices with the same account.

This reading app offers superior control over type and page display
I use the various options for changing 
font, color, size, line spacing, and margin 
to create custom themes, making one 
appropriate for wide reading in land-
scape and the other for narrow reading 
in portrait.
The version of the app tested lacks 
annotation, highlight, and bookmark 
syncing between the Nook hardware and 
desktop software. But its better quali-
ties make up for that lack—and I expect 
those features to come, perhaps by the 
time you’re reading this review.
Nook, a mid-2010 replacement for 
Barnes & Noble’s previous Reader pro-
gram, has style and panache. It’s now 
among the best book-reading programs. 
Nook offers the most extensive control 
over display, even allowing you to set an 
inset margin. 
Like all iOS reading programs except 
Apple’s iBooks, Nook doesn’t let you 
shop for reading material within the 
app; you must use Mobile Safari to make 
purchases. Nook has access to a large 
library of both free and paid books.
Once you purchase items, they appear 
on Nook’s main page. Books that aren’t 
stored on the device you’re using have a 
Download label at the bottom; tap, and 
the work is retrieved along with the last-
read position in the book.
Pages can be read in portrait or land-
scape orientation, but the same settings 
aren’t necessarily best for each view.

background color. Page ﬂipping is as 
simple as tapping. You also tap to leave 
notes or create a bookmark for future 
reference. The app continuously reg-
isters your current reading position 
and syncs notes and bookmarks with 
Amazon’s central servers. This allows 
you to pick up where you left off in any 
other Kindle app or device.
Why buy a book you can read in only 
one place? Amazon’s answer is: you 
shouldn’t. The Kindle app is part of an 
ecosystem. Amazon makes the hun-
dreds of thousands of books you can 
buy or get for free from its Kindle Store 
available to the iOS app, as well as to 
Kindle hardware (the smaller-sized 
Kindle and larger Kindle DX), and apps 
for other mobile devices and desktops. 
Because of limits Apple imposes on 
how items are sold within apps, you 
are directed to Amazon’s Web site to 
purchase books or load free books. 
You can send these to speciﬁc Kindle 
apps or hardware; the next time you 
launch Kindle on an iPhone or other 
iOS device the book immediately starts 
downloading.
Reading is a pleasure in the Kindle 
app, which lets you pick among some 
presets for the typeface, font size, and

Reeder 
$2.99* ǩSilvio Rizzi ǩhttp://5str.us/i22
Distraction-free presentation and easy forwarding of feed items
Reeder is a straightforward interface for 
accessing the RSS feeds and other news 
you’ve subscribed to via Google Reader 
(http://5str.us/p72). Google Reader acts 
as a central synchronized repository for 
Reeder and other desktop and mobile 
newsreader programs.
While there are other apps covered in 
this chapter that reformat RSS news-
feeds into something richer, there’s also 
a place for those who want a tool that 
presents that information in the most 
straightforward way. That’s Reeder.
Reeder pulls down updates from Google 
Reader on request. The main inter-
face uses a star, a circle, and a set of 
three horizontal lines to indicate items 
marked as favorites, unread items, and 
all items or feeds. 
I typically ﬁnd myself in the “circle” 
mode, tapping the Unread link at the 
top. This shows me feeds in the order of 
mostly recently received ﬁrst (indicated 
by a clock icon at lower right). Tap the 
feed (signal waves) icon to show unread 
items divvied up by feed instead.
Reeder’s strength, beyond simplicity, is 
in how well it shares what you’re read-
ing. You can share, transfer, or post to 
services or programs like Instapaper, 
Mobile Safari, Delicious, Twitter, email, 
and many more. (Active services can be 
set via the Settings app.)
Reeder works only over Wi-Fi when 
installed unless you change an option in 
Settings > Reeder.

away from a network. Tap the arrow-
in-a-rectangle button at lower right, 
and you can archive the item, move it 
to a folder, and share it through many 
means (email, Tweeting, and so on). You 
can also open the item in an in-app Web 
browser to see the full original HTML 
glory of the page you marked to read.
Instapaper answers the question of 
what to do when you ﬁnd something 
on the Web that you want to remember 
and read later. If I immediately read 
everything I was interested in that was 
forwarded to me, I would never have had 
the time to write this book.
Bookmarks were once the answer, and 
those of you with 100 bookmarks or 
more that you never consult, raise your 
hand? (I’m raising mine.)
Instapaper works on the Web, whether 
in a desktop browser or Mobile Safari, 
by giving you a Read Later bookmark. 
After creating and logging into a free 
account at Instapaper, you install this 
link, and you’re ready to start saving 
links. (The Mobile Safari installation is 
a little involved, but the documentation 
walks you through step by step.)
Whenever you’re on a Web page and tap 
or click Read Later, a little behind-the-
scenes JavaScript copies the URL to 
your Instapaper account. The text of the 
page in a stripped-down format is also 
stored for later viewing.
Launch the Instapaper app and, with 
your account information in place, all 
the articles and pages you’ve marked 
for reading later are synchronized along 
with any folders you’ve made for orga-
nizing pages.
When you select an item to read, you’re

Flipboard

Presentation of feeds, Twitter, Facebook, and more in a magazine-like format
Flipboard takes a small number of 
interesting, regularly updated data 
sources, and presents the results like 
a magazine. The app takes the links, 
photos, and videos of an RSS, Twitter, or 
Facebook feed, and presents them in a 
way that you can’t believe was generated 
entirely without a human being handling 
the layout. It’s an automatic periodical.
You can add prefabricated feeds from 
the list offered by Flipboard, including a 
variety of news, independent, and photo 
sites. You can add feeds from Twitter (by 
name and list) and your Facebook feed. 
Each time you launch the app, a “cover” 
image drawn from a feed ﬁlls the 
screen; these rotate through almost like 
a slideshow if you don’t move on. Swipe 
(or “ﬂip”) from the right edge to the left, 
and the table of contents appears with 
nine squares per page. (Swipe left to add 
items to more pages.) Each item in the 
contents shows an appropriate image, 
again drawn from the newsfeed.
Tap a square, and the RSS items, tweets, 
or Facebook updates are shown at 
varying sizes, depending on length and 
context. Photos and videos are extracted 
from links, and typically shown large. 
Articles linked or in the RSS feed are 
previewed. Tap on any item and get 
more of it, often with a link to load the 
Web page (within the app).
Flipboard transforms the stream of 
undifferentiated updates we receive into 
something beautiful, comprehensible, 
and compact. It’s digestible without 
losing the ﬂavor. It would be nice to 
add any RSS or newsfeed, but there 
is a beneﬁt to the simplicity of choice, 
too. Flipboard isn’t a newsreader; it’s a 
medium.

Times re-envisions the ﬂow of informa-
tion coming from feeds all over the Web 
into something comprehensible and 
attractive.
Times makes newspapers out of RSS 
feeds, even feeds from newspapers. 
Traditional RSS readers—if traditional 
makes sense for a newish technology—
organize the items that come from feeds 
as headlines, in most cases making 
items appear like email subject lines.
Times has a radically different 
approach. Why not make news look like 
news? While the app comes with prefab 
feeds—so that you’re not looking at a 
blank page—you can add feeds from 
any site you want. (There’s no discovery 
process to ﬁnd feeds at this writing, but 
that’s a minor cavil.)
Feeds appear as columns, which you 
can make wider or narrower. The items 
in feeds, including images, can be dis-
played as a series of headlines, as a 
series of images, or various combina-
tions from a set of layout options. The 
app comes with a few categories deﬁned 
at the top, like Technology and Science, 
but it’s easy enough to change those or 
add your own.
You can scroll up and down in columns, 
as well as drag left and right to see 
more columns. Tap an item, and it opens 
in a rolldown frame, approximating a 
newspaper page. 
In landscape view, items may be added 
to a shelf that can be revealed at the 
top of the virtual page as a kind of 
bookmark. You can also choose to view 
items in an in-app browser. Items can be 
shared via email, Twitter, and Facebook.

GoodReader for iPad 
$0.99 ǩGood.iWare ǩhttp://5str.us/jl7
Need to retrieve a ﬁle from somewhere else, store it, and read it?
GoodReader is the missing link in iOS 
ﬁle transfer and management. An iOS 
device can view attachments in email, 
or view many ﬁle formats linked on a 
Web page using Mobile Safari. But iOS 
by itself neither lets you store docu-
ments in a common location nor retrieve 
ﬁles from Internet ﬁle-storage services. 
GoodReader adds all that and more.
On the incoming side, GoodReader can 
connect with many Internet storage 
services using the WebDAV standard. 
It has special entries for Dropbox and 
MobileMe iDisk, as well as prefab set-
tings for several other service provid-
ers. Pictures from the Photo Library 
can also be added. Any ﬁle you retrieve 
is stored locally, but not automatically 
updated if the remote copy changes.
Three in-app purchases, each 99 cents, 
let you add ﬁle-retrieval options: email 
(retrieve messages or attachments), 
FTP (both regular and Secure FTP), and 
Google Docs. (The same is true for the 
iPhone/iPod version of GoodReader.)
Files can be added via iTunes File 
Sharing (see p. xv). You can opt to 
move ﬁles around over a network, too: 
GoodReader has a built-in WebDAV 
server that allows remote access on 
the same Wi-Fi network from Mac OS X, 
Windows, and apps running on other iOS 
devices—including GoodReader.
The WebDAV server lets you copy, 
delete, rename, and add ﬁles to 
GoodReader’s ﬁle storage. (For more 
about using WebDAV, see p. xvi.) The 
WebDAV server can be set up so that 
when someone tries to access ﬁles, 
you’re prompted to accept or reject. (I 
like the enthuastic !!! after Yes.)

GoodReader shines at handling PDFs, 
far better than iOS’s built-in capability. 
GoodReader includes zone-based navi-
gation, where tapping in different areas 
lets you move forward and backward or 
trigger other activities. 
PDFs can be searched, and bookmarks 
and the table of contents used for navi-
gation. You can view annotations made in 
Acrobat or elsewhere, and attach notes 
to PDF pages. A PDF Reﬂow option 
extracts the text of a PDF one page at 
a time for easier onscreen reading. You 
can also copy the text and email it.
The Manage Files feature lets you mark 
ﬁles once they’re stored in GoodReader, 
You can mark a ﬁle as a favorite, open a 
document in another app, rename a ﬁle, 
or create a compressed ZIP archive of 
selected items.
On the reading side, GoodReader can 
handle all the formats built into iOS (see 
complete list on p. xviii), including play-
ing back supported audio and video.

Air Sharing Pro 
$6.99 ǩAvatron Software ǩhttp://5str.us/px5
Store, view, retrieve, delete, print, and email ﬁles remotely or on an iOS device
The problem with mobility is that the ﬁle 
you need is always somewhere else. Air 
Sharing Pro eliminates that issue, and 
offers quite a bit more, too. The program 
has three distinct elements, and each 
can be highly useful.
First, it retrieves ﬁles from wherever 
you’ve put them. The app offers built-in 
support to access a variety of remote 
ﬁle servers and storage systems. This 
includes MobileMe iDisk and Dropbox, 
any server using the WebDAV proto-
col for ﬁle access, and Secure FTP. By 
entering email account login informa-
tion, the program can pull down attach-
ments from mail messages. Air Sharing 
can also use Bonjour networking to ﬁnd 
WebDAV servers on the same Wi-Fi net-
work as your device.
Second, you can view or copy a ﬁle from 
any directory or folder you bring up. PDF 
ﬁles may be searched, and the app lets 
you use PDF thumbnails, bookmarks, 
and table of contents entries to navigate. 
Files can also be sent to printers over 
Wi-Fi. The printers have to offer Bonjour 
network discovery, which most modern 
units have. The print option appears 
when you tap the action button at the 
lower left of a document. Available 
printers are listed. Once you select a 
printer, you can choose a page range, 
and paper type, as well as modify 
printer-speciﬁc options such as paper 
feed and paper type.

/// READING

Third, and ﬁnally, Air Sharing Pro has 
a built-in ﬁle server. That’s right: your 
iOS device can show up on a local Wi-Fi 
network as a server that you or others 
can use (with optional password protec-
tion and encryption) to retrieve, add, or 
exchange ﬁles.
Air Sharing also sports a number of ﬁle-
handling tools in any document view. Tap 
Edit, then select ﬁles, and tap the gear 
icon in the lower right. The app can then 
compress the ﬁles into a ZIP archive, 
rename them, or delete them. But it 
can also copy ﬁles. If you choose copy, 
an icon with a paperclip is shown at the 
upper right. Navigate to any other server 
or the My Documents folder, and you can 
copy ﬁles to that location. You can also 
move ﬁles, which deletes after copy. 
Avatron has a less-featured version of 
Air Sharing that costs $4 less: it omits 
WebDAV, printing, ﬁle, and advanced 
PDF viewing features, but can be 
upgraded in-app to the full Pro ver-
sion. (Avatron has a comparison chart:

Documents To Go Premium 
$16.99 ǩDataViz ǩhttp://5str.us/19b
Edit your Ofﬁce documents wherever they live
stored on the device, DocsToGo retrieves 
it ﬁrst.) You can also create a document 
to get started by tapping the plus-docu-
ment icon in the lower corner of any ﬁle 
location view. 
Tap in the text or cells for a Word or 
Excel doc, and you can start editing. 
The Undo and Redo buttons in the upper 
right help you recover from editing 
mistakes. 
DocsToGo provides more limited options 
for editing PowerPoint presentations, 
and it’s even a little opaque how to get 
started. Tap the up/down arrow icon at 
the bottom of a presentation you’re edit-
ing, and then tap Outline View. This gives 
you access to the outline, but you’re lim-
ited to formatting—such as including a 
bullet list—that’s set in the template for 
each slide.
DocsToGo also works as a hub to col-
lect your data from the various services 
To make an iOS device work for a busi-
ness professional, it needs to be able to 
handle the formats for the universally 
employed word processing, spread-
sheet, and presentation programs from 
Microsoft—the power trio of Word, 
Excel, and PowerPoint.
While any iOS app that views ﬁles can 
show you the contents of those formats, 
few can make any changes to them or 
create new ﬁles in those formats. That’s 
where Documents To Go Premium 
(Ofﬁce Suite) comes in.
The app can create and edit any of those 
formatted ﬁles, as well as view all other 
native iOS formats (see p. xviii). It works 
on the small screen or the iPad, and is 
best used with an external keyboard for 
extended editing or writing.
Select a document from any of the ﬁle 
location tabs, like Local, and it opens 
in an editing window. (If the ﬁle isn’t yet

and servers across which ﬁles might be 
scattered. You can copy ﬁles via iTunes 
directly to the program, and retrieve 
them via the Local tab. Files created 
within DocsToGo are stored in the Local 
tab as well.
A Desktop tab gives you access to ﬁles 
over a local Wi-Fi network to sync with 
folders on local computers; this requires 
installation of a free program for Mac 
OS X and Windows, rather than using 
the standard WebDAV approach found 
in most other reading/editing apps. (The 
desktop program is a bit weak; I like to 
browse folders, and the program was 
rather slow on a Mac.)
The Online view lets you connect to a 
variety of storage services, including 
Google Docs, Dropbox, SugarSync, and 
MobileMe iDisk. This option is excluded 
from the non-premium version, which 
costs $7 less. It’s unlikely you’d want the 
cheaper version, because I can guaran-
tee you’ll want to have remote document 
access for editing and storage.
DocsToGo lets you bring documents 
in and out of other iOS apps: it should 
appear as an option in the Open In menu 
available now in many other programs 
for the formats it supports. And you can 
also—in reverse—have a document in 
DocsToGo open in another app that can 
read the ﬁle’s format.
The app has built-in help (tap More, 
Settings, and then Help; it could use 
help to ﬁnd Help), useful for a program 
with so many options.

Comics 
FREE ǩcomiXology ǩhttp://5str.us/foy
The comic-reading engine powerful enough to leap (and pan) tall panels
The folks at comiXology power iOS 
comic reading with a special force, too 
powerful for one company to control: the 
Comics app. This program is available 
directly from comiXology (at no cost), 
and it’s the same engine that underlies 
the Marvel Comics, DC Comics, and 
Scott Pilgrim apps. 
By registering a comiXology account, 
you can read DC Comics and Scott 
Pilgrim books in the Comics app; Marvel 
has its own registration system. The 
reason to buy in the otherwise identical 
apps is to have access to newer content; 
the Comics app’s store often has a cou-
ple-year lag on what it’s able to offer.
Comics is organized into three simple 
tabs: My Comics, for free and paid com-
ics you’ve downloaded or which are 
available to download on this device; 
Store, which lists free and priced com-
ics; and Settings. The number of free 
comics is quite high, with ﬁrst issues 
special editons to promote a series or 
new release.
Both the My Comics and Store views 
offer a Browse button in the upper right 
that lets you look through your collec-
tion or available books by identiﬁers like 
series and publisher. Comics that you’ve 
bought but aren’t downloaded to this 
device can be retrieved to Comics with 
a single tap on a red starburst. Tapping 
the Read button brings up the book.

a pane, and then you tap or swipe to 
advance. For complicated layouts, the 
reader shows part of the layout at a 
time. Movement from pane to pane can 
involve balletic leaps, along with zooms 
in and out, as you tap to proceed. On an 
iPad, you can also read full screen and 
use pinch and expand gestures to make 
parts more legible or see more at once.

Scott Pilgrim Saves the World became one

ous release of the movie and the sixth 
and ﬁnal book in the series, this app 
appeared. 
Scott Pilgrim lets you purchase the six 
books as in-app items ($6.99 for the 
ﬁrst ﬁve and $11.99 for the ﬁnal volume). 
Once purchased, you can use a comiXol-

ComicZeal 
$7.99 ǩBitolithic ǩhttp://5str.us/qbn
A virtual wallrack for comics
You might miss the feel of paper under 
your ﬁngers as you ﬂip through com-
ics, but there’s also something pleasant 
about having everything neatly at your 
disposal, as with ebooks. ComicZeal is 
a comics reader, handling several popu-
lar formats for packaging digital ﬁles 
into collections, including cbr, cbz, rar, 
zip, and PDF. (ComicZeal also acts as a 
PDF reader for any document, not just 
comics.)
A previous version of ComicZeal in iOS 
3 required Wi-Fi syncing and other fol-
derol to move items around. Now, you 
simply use iTunes File Sharing to copy 
ﬁles over USB (see p. xv). The Open In 
option in iOS 4 is also a conduit. You can 
use Dropbox, or any ﬁle-sharing pro-
gram that opens remote ﬁles, to select 
a supported ﬁle format and then open 
it with ComicZeal. Safari also works: 
punch in a URL there or follow a link and 
ComicZeal should appear as an option to 
open the ﬁle.
Comics can be organized into collections 
or series, and the app is smart enough 
to read consistent ﬁle name patterns 
and drop new entrants into the right 
collection if they’re labeled correctly. 
Collections have a nifty rack icon, too.

Tap the settings icon at top (a wrench) 
to turn on assisted panning, and you’re 
presented with possibly too many other

ComicZeal isn’t trying to let you cus-
tomize the reading experience to your 
precise delight. Set a background behind 
panels, and declutter the top and bottom 
navigation if you choose.
As to for how to ﬁnd comics in these 
formats, look for free and paid sources 
of new comics all via the Web as well 
as an increasingly large horde of public 
domain titles. ComicZeal comes with a 
few, and offers links to download more. 
To read a comic, you tap it, and it ﬁlls the 
screen. You can tap smack-dab in the 
center to toggle top and bottom naviga-
tion. On the bottom, there’s an orienta-
tion lock for portrait or landscape mode. 
This avoids your comics lurching 90 
degrees while you’re reading. Buttons 
let you page back and forth in the book, 
and a slider moves rapidly.
Tap on the left and right sides to move 
back and forth without buttons. Pinch,

borders to zoom from one to the next.

Twitter 
FREE* ǩTwitter ǩhttp://5str.us/fbs
The operators of Twitter offer a strong entrant with a different feel
Should we be surprised that Twitter (the 
company) would release a great Twitter 
app? Not really. But what’s surprising 
about this free entrant into the very 
crowded Twitter program market is how 
different it is from all the others. Even 
more fascinating is how different the 
iPhone/iPod touch version is from the 
iPad version—even though it’s a univer-
sal app. (I prefer the iPad version.)
Both versions let you set up one or 
multiple Twitter accounts to follow the 
newest messages among those you fol-
low, mentions of your Twitter name, and 
direct messages, among other features.
On the iPhone/iPod touch, Twitter works 
rather like many other apps, with sepa-
rate views for accounts broken up by 
tweets, mentions, and direct messages. 
There’s a lot of tapping involved in get-
ting to a conversation thread, but it’s 
workable.
The iPad version, however, truly shines 
in how it manages multiple frames of 
information. At ﬁrst, it looks like just 
a side-by-side view: categories (like 
Timeline and Search) at left, and tweets 
at right. But tap a tweet and the right 
pane slides over and a new pane over-
lays it showing the conversation (if any). 
That new pane that lets you navigate 
among proﬁle information. Tap a URL in 
the timeline or in the proﬁle pane, and a 
Web view slides in from the right.
When you want to dispose of the Web 
view, you give it a push or slide it back 
to the right. You can bring it back by 
swiping or dragging back to the left. The 
same is true of other panes, which snap 
to the right width as needed.
It’s worth considering other Twitter apps 
on the iPhone, but Twitter for iPad has 
the lead on that hardware.

SOCIAL NETWORKING ///

The iPad version uses pop-over dialogs 
to show additional information when you 
tap, but works best in landscape mode, 
where the left side of the screen gives 
you more information than the iPhone 
version can display.
Along with writing tweets, you can take 
a picture or record a video on an iPhone, 
or choose an item from the Photo Lib-
rary. Twitteriﬁc supports several image 
and video hosting services. 
Contrariwise to Twitter’s app, I prefer 
Twitteriﬁc on the iPhone/iPod touch; the 
iPad rendition is too spread out for me.
Twitteriﬁc for Twitter 
FREE* ǩThe Iconfactory ǩ
http://5str.us/s73
Simple display of items from multiple 
Twitter accounts, suited for all devices
Twitteriﬁc was an early and fabulous 
Mac OS X Twitter client, and it’s gone 
through three great overhauls iterations 
under iOS to reach its current form. 
Every good Twitter app has a different 
focus. Twitteriﬁc’s interest is in giving 
you a simpliﬁed and straightforward 
view of your tweets and those that are 
directed at you. 
A main view—All Tweets—shows your 
timeline, highlighting direct messages 
and replies in separate colors to stand 
out. Green shows your own tweets; 
orange, a mention (in which your ID is 
shown); and gray, all other messages.
Tap names to get more details about 
a fellow tweeter, and follow threads.

conversations.

Birdhouse 
$1.99* ǩSandwich Dynamics ǩhttp://5str.us/cza
Compose and reﬁne perfect tweets for later twittering
Birdhouse adds deliberation to Twitter 
by letting you compose and tweak 
tweets without having to post them 
immediately. While some Twitter clients 
now let you stores drafts, too, Birdhouse 
is 100-percent designed around the bon 
mot or clever phrase. That’s why you’ll 
see the Birdhouse client tag attached 
to tweets by many people who are—or 
sound—smart or funny. (Client tags are 
shown in small type on Twitter.com and 
in some other Twitter software.)
Birdhouse has a simple sheet where you 
write a tweet, with a character count 
in the lower right. You can add multiple 
accounts to Birdhouse, and choose from 
which account a tweet posts. You can 
also compose messages ofﬂine when no 
Internet access is available.
Tap the compose icon in the upper right, 
and write away. You can rank your own 
tweet from zero to ﬁve stars at the bot-
tom, which shows up in the summary 
list, to remind yourself how marvelous 
one tweet is compared to another. A star 
tab in the list view lets you sort by star 
ranking.
Publishing and removing a tweet both 
involve deliberation, too. To post a tweet 
to your Twitter timeline, you can Publish, 
but then you have to tap Publish a sec-
ond time to avoid posting prematurely if 
the ﬁrst tap was a mistake. 
Likewise, when you want to remove a 
tweet, you tap Unpublish, and then tap 
that again. Unpublishing a tweet deletes 
it from Twitter and places it back in draft 
status in Birdhouse.

The advantage and disadvantage of this 
mobile app is a lack of extra stuff that 
populates the Web site. You don’t see 
ads (at least as of this writing), and there 
aren’t constant reminders about friends 
you haven’t connected with and sugges-
tions of things, people, and places to 
interact with. 
It’s also missing access to Facebook 
applications. These Web-based apps 
aren’t designed yet to run in the mobile 
world, and some require Flash. But a 
limited universe may be a good thing.
Sure, half a billion people use Facebook, 
but what if you can’t gain access right 
this second? All is lost. No more! 
The ofﬁcial Facebook app is a well-
constructed approach to reading and 
posting updates, viewing photos, and 
staying in touch—without throwing in the 
kitchen sink. It has restraint and utility.
A main screen offers nine links for com-
mon activities, with News Feed at the 
upper left. You can access photos, your 
proﬁle, a list of friends, and more. A 
second page has just a single link, and 
you can add links (tap the + sign) from 
your friends or any Facebook pages 
you’ve liked. 
You can leave comments, “Like” things, 
and check in using Places at locations 
near you. Places ﬁnds the nearest spots 
if you let it use your current position. You 
can also approve friend requests, make 
new ones, and chat.

The app also supports multiple Word-

Pandora

Endless radio stations of your composition with optional ads
Open Pandora and you don’t release all 
the evils of the world—nor a little hope. 
(You don’t turn blue and tall, either.) 
Rather, you unchain an endless number 
of custom streaming radio stations that 
aim to match your likes.
You start by creating an account, which 
gives the ﬁrm some of your demo-
graphic information. Pandora is funded 
by advertising: you’re trading personal 
data for free music.
In the Pandora app, start creating cus-
tom stations. Tap the New Station icon 
at the bottom. In the Artist tab, enter a 
song title, artist name, or composer. The 
Genre tab lets you choose from several 
broad categories.
Pandora uses your selected song, art-
ist, or composer as a jumping off point. 
For instance, I am a fan of the song 
“Die Seeräuber Jenny” (“Pirate Jenny”) 
from The Threepenny Opera. When I tap 
in that song title, Pandora offers me 
several different versions. I select Nina 
Simone’s, and the “Pirate Jenny Radio” 
station that I just crevated starts off by 
playing that artist singing a song from 
Porgy & Bess.
Tap the detail button while a song is 
playing (the bullet list icon in the upper 
right), and the Song tab exposes some 
of the logic that the Pandora system 
used in picking that particular number. 
Pandora uses a system called the Music 
Genome Project that attempts to match 
common elements across songs.
You can try to ﬁne-tune Pandora’s 
results by tapping the thumbs up or 
thumbs down button. This works, but 
only to a certain extent. You can also 
skip a song, but not go back. 
Because Pandora is a streaming ser-
vice, you can run through cellular data 
if you listen to it constantly away from

The list includes both broadcast radio

Manage an active list of music on the ﬂy straight-through or shufﬂed
QUp is an app that, before you use it, 
you don’t know you need it. The program 
provides extremely ﬁne and well-consid-
ered control over creating and managing 
a persistent playlist of music. It ﬁlls in 
missing pieces in the iPod app.
The software is like one super playlist. 
You select music to add from a music 
view that shows your whole audio library 
(podcasts excluded), listing Playlists, 
Albums, Artists, and Songs. The More 
view adds Compilations, Composers, 
and Genres.
From any display, you drill down to 
songs or albums, and can tap a + next to 
Add All Songs (including at the top level 
to add all your music) or tap a + next to 
any individual song. 
Tap Done, and the list is ready to go. The 
play view shows album cover art (where 
available) ﬁlling the screen. If you tap 
that view, the bottom half previews the 
next track with an album cover, the song 
title, its album name, and the artist. 
You can advance back and forth through 
upcoming songs and tap to jump to the 
track you’ve selected. And you can turn 
shufﬂe play on and off as well from this 
view.
Tap the list icon at upper right, and you 
can review and manipulate the songs 
you’ve chosen. Tap a song to move it to 
the top of the queue without interrupt-
ing music that’s playing. Tap the Shufﬂe 
button and you can resort the whole list 
and see the results.
The list view also lets you see a com-
pendium of artists and albums, and 
search among the items in the playlist.
The software’s only substantial miss-
ing feature is the ability to save custom 
QUp playlists you can bring back to play 
again later.

Pass audio from computers running Airfoil to your iOS device
you can still stream without fear of oth-
ers listening in—you may not want them 
to know that you’ve got Depeche Mode 
on inﬁnite shufﬂe—by setting a pass-
word in Settings within the app.
Airfoil Speakers Touch works as a 
perfect complement to remote control 
apps. With Apple’s free Remote app (see 
p. 175), you can control iTunes on the 
same computer that’s streaming audio 
from Airfoil to your iOS device. You can 
also use the app to create remote head-
phones. While watching a video across 
the room shunt the audio to your iOS 
device and plug in earphones.
Think of Airfoil Speakers Touch as 
turning an iOS device into a portable 
speaker. The app works with Rogue 
Amoeba’s Airfoil commercial software 
for Mac OS X and Windows. Airfoil cap-
tures and redirects audio that’s playing 
on a computer to a variety of devices: 
other computers, AirPort Express, 
Apple TV, and mobile hardware running 
this iOS app. 
For Airfoil Speakers Touch to work, your 
iOS device must be on the same Wi-Fi 
network as the computer from which 
you want to stream audio.
Setup is simple. Install Airfoil on a com-
puter on the network, launch the Airfoil 
Speakers Touch app, and select the 
device as a destination from the com-
puter software. Because the app sup-
ports background audio, it continues to 
play music even if you switch to another 
program. If you’re on a shared network,

Ocarina 
$0.99 ǩSmule ǩhttp://5str.us/5dm
Unearthly music by blowing on the microphone
One of the earliest iPhone apps to get 
attention after Apple opened up its 
operating system to outside developers 
was Ocarina from Ge Wang, a Stanford 
University professor. You blow into the 
microphone as if it were a wind instru-
ment—the ancient ocarina, to be exact.
As you blow, you cover or uncover com-
binations of four virtual openings on the 
touch screen. Despite the simplicity of 
the instrument you can play complex 
songs. (It works better without a case, 
which can make it hard to handle the 
phone as an instrument.)
You can tune Ocarina via the app’s set-
tings to other keys and to Greek modes 
like Ionian. (A little joke about the game 
The Legend of Zelda is thrown in with 
Zeldarian being one mode you can 
select.) 
You can opt not to use a mic or head-
set by setting Touch Mode to On. This 
produces all tones at the same volume 
instead of responding to the amount of 
breath. (That’s the only choice for the 
iPod touch.)
All the software from Smule (or 
SonicMule) has a social component as 
well. In Ocarina’s case, you can tap a 
globe icon and hear people playing all 
over the world, some quite expertly. Tap 
the heart icon, and you’ve contributed 
toward a particular player moving into 
Top Melodies as well as adding them to 
your My Loved list.
You might wonder how you teach your-
self to play songs on the Ocarina. The 
answer can be found on SonicMule’s 
Web site, where sheet music uniquely 
transcribed for Ocarina can be found. 
The form takes just a moment to learn.

which requires a free account. 
Smule’s apps are all about sharing, and 
Glee is a worldwide phenomenon. Tap 
a Listen button on the home screen,

of karaoke singing (including showing 
you the lyrics) with tonal correction (and 
optional reverb). Even better: with the 
beneﬁt of anonymity, sing out unselfcon-

judge you.
Conceive of the original Guitar Hero 
mashed up with karaoke, and you’ve ﬁg-
ured out the Glee app from Smule. While 
you sing along with the instrumentals of 
songs culled from the show, starbursts 
explode as you sing. A visual display of 
the relative pitch of the note gives you 
feedback as you ﬁx your pitch.
Miss the notes, and you can opt to have 
your singing auto-tuned electronically 
altered to ﬁt the right note, no matter 
what you sing.
Rack up starbursts (which count as 
points) and compete on a daily basis 
with other Gleekers—fans of the show—
worldwide. Or you can just sing for 
yourself.
Your performance can be recorded, and 
you can listen to yourself. And you can 
send a copy of the song to others via 
email or upload to Facebook, tweet it, or 
post it on MySpace.

Magic Piano 
$0.99 ǩSmule ǩhttp://5str.us/z7s
A piano without keys
Magic Piano is more of an approxima-
tion of the sense of a piano than a literal 
intrepretation. The app allows enjoyable 
exploration of notes and melodies, but 
I wouldn’t recommend you try to play a 
tune. (They all laughed when I sat down 
to play!)
The program features four keyboards, 
all of them a bit strange, but interesting. 
You tap the circular key icon at the upper 
right to cycle through them.
The keyboards are a spiral, a straight 
line (with undulations), a circle, and 
invisible. In each mode, you can tap mul-
tiple keys at the same time to produce 
chords. (An iPad can record up to about 
10 separate ﬁnger taps at once, and 
Magic Piano works with that.)
The spiral and circle modes are just for 
playing around, while you can experi-
ment with real music in the straight 
keyboard. With the circle or straight 
layout, pinch and expand to change the 
number of keys (and their width) shown 
on screen. Swipe left and right to move 
up and down the keyboard.
The menu offers other interesting 
options, like Songbook. The app down-
loads a score for a song you select 
from a modest list, like Pictures at an 
Exhibition. Notes start descending as 
spots of light from top to bottom. Tap the 
spot in the order of descent, and you’re 
playing the song.
When you play, your music is beamed 
out to the rest of the world (using a 
name you enter in Settings). You can lis-
ten in through the World option, or join 
in by tapping Duet. That mode matches 
you up with someone likewise seeking 
a partner. Your respective positions are 
shown on a globe while you play.

Soundrop 
FREE ǩDeveloe ǩhttp://5str.us/ju3
Magical musical effects by drawing lines that act as chords for bouncing balls
Fascinating patterns emerge from 
simple actions. That’s the key to under-
standing (and loving) minimalist music 
from artists like Steven Reich, and the 
key to falling in love with Soundrop.
Soundrop has no goal. Rather, a ball 
drops, and you draw lines. The lines are 
chords; the length affects the tone pro-
duced when the line is hit. Longer lines 
produce deeper notes. 
The balls bounce off the lines with 
some semblance of physics (with very 
low gravity) to produce melodies con-
trolled by changing the angle and length 
of lines. You can produce fast-moving 
cacophonies, or slow, ponderous dirges.
The free version lets you explore simple 
notes. An in-app upgrade adds four ele-
ments: multiple instruments, which you 
assign to different colors used to draw 
lines; physics modiﬁers to change grav-
ity, friction, and bounciness; the ability 
to drop multiple balls at once; and the 
option to save a ”game,” so you can 
restore your melody.
While Soundrop doesn’t have a goal and 
there is no scoring, you strive with the 
app to make interesting music instead of 
noise. Which may be the purpose of life 
itself.

You are a camera. 
Carrying an iPhone or newest iPod touch means 
there’s never a time you aren’t ready to take a 
picture. But is the picture ready for you? In this 
chapter, learn how to make an ordinary photo 
extraordinary, get playful, and view the results.
Photography 

Hipstamatic 
$1.99 ǩSynthetic Infatuation ǩhttp://5str.us/vwx
Use classic camera treatments and effects to punch up standard iPhone pictures
Photographers of any vintage will tell 
you that the ﬁlm is part of what makes 
the picture. So are the lens and the 
camera body. You may frame the shot, 
set the exposure, and choose the right 
time, but photos have always been a 
result of unpredictable outcomes from 
all the factors that go into them.
Hipstamatic tries to put some of those 
combinations under glass by aptly 
mimicking the lens effects of particular 
camera models, the color and develop-
ment peculiarities of particular ﬁlms, 
and the ﬁlter and cast of ﬂashes. 
All pictures are taken with the 
Hipstamatic 150 camera body (a tip of 
the hat to a 30-year-old model), which 
offers three lenses, three ﬁlms, and 
two ﬂash choices. More sets of camera, 
ﬂashes, and ﬁlms can be purchased in-
app for 99¢ each.
When setting up a shot, the app lets 
you choose among the camera options 
you own. Tap the turn-around arrow 
at lower right to make selections. The 
icons along the bottom correspond to 
ﬁlm, ﬂash, and lenses. Tap any of them, 
and you can swipe back and forth among 
what’s available. (It’s also a sales pitch 
for items you don’t own, with access to 
the in-app store from the same view.) 
Tap any specialty item, like a ﬂash, and 
the screen ﬁlls with detailed information 
about what kind of results to expect. Tap 
the turn-around arrow again to return to 
the main camera view and take photos.
You frame pictures in a sort of cleverly 
awkward way: the viewﬁnder only shows 
you part of the image area, which means 
you’re working more roughly, but can 
produce happy accidents. You can turn 
this off and see the entire framed area,

but you may like it better with the view-
ﬁnder cropping; I thought it added ran-
domness. (Launch the Settings app and 
swipe to the Hipstamatic icon.)
From the camera side, swipe the ﬂash 
bottom to “power it up,” and tap the 
big yellow button to take  a picture. A 
Developing label appears for a moment, 
and then you need to wait for the green 
Print Ready light to wink on at the lower 
left. (The verisimilitude may wear thin 
after a few of those.)
Tap the photo square to view pictures, 
which are always framed as squares. 
From the photo view, you can create col-
lections of images (called stacks), which 
can be emailed, or shared on Facebook, 
Flickr, or a Tumblr site. You can also 
order prints in sets of 9 or 27, with any 
quantity for each image.

Panoramatic 360 
$1.99 ǩFloaty ǩhttp://5str.us/pa6
Complex settings reward with well-rendered panoramas and a community
Panoramatic 360 is a bit more compli-
cated to use than two of the panorama 
apps on the following pages, but it pro-
duces more precise results, both to help 
you take the correct overlapping images 
and to create a ﬁnal picture. For those 
who want a high level of control, this app 
is highly recommended.
You start by choosing either a portrait or 
landscape orientation to take photos, or 
pick a photo from your device’s library 
instead.
When working with live images, choose 
the starting place for the panorama and 
take the ﬁrst shot. The app helps align 
subsequent photos, which are added to 
the right. A small overlap is shown from 
the previous photo at the left to assist in 
making a good match. You can turn on 
an audio hinter or a set of gridlines to 
help out.
To keep orientation and alignment for 
any shot (but especially critical for 
360-degree panorama), a circle with two 
dots aids you. A yellow dot shows how 
far out of alignment you are in the circle; 
make small adjustments in position and 
angle until the overlap of the image is 
perfect and the yellow dot is as close to 
on top of the blue dot as possible. 
For either live pictures or those that are 
being built out of your existing photos, 
you can add pictures on either end of the 
panorama in a review mode. When you 
tap Finish, you have basic and advanced 
options for correcting the image. These 
options can be a little involved, and 
experimentation is useful.

for more on WebDAV). You can also con-
tribute panoramas to the app's world-
wide directory, Panoramatic World. (Tap 
a link on the home page to view other 
people's work by name or on a map, and 
rate it, too.)
The Gallery view lets you review your 
stored panoramas, see where they were 
taken on a world map, and manage 
Wi-Fi sharing. 
The built-in help instructions provide 
details about the settings (includ-
ing adjusting exposure and correcting 
for lens distortion), but help can't be 
accessed while you’re adjusting set-
tings. Tap Save Project to save the state 
of your work, read the help, and then 
use the Gallery view’s Drafts section to 
retrieve your project. Now you can test 
results by changing settings and tapping 
Render. Large projects can take a few 
minutes to produce.
The resulting images can be saved in 
the local photo library, emailed (at lower 
resolution), or retrieved over a local net-
work using WebDAV sharing (see p. xvi

Pano 
$2.99 ǩDebacle Software ǩhttp://5str.us/s14
Simple but effective way to create panoramas
Pano has one function: start making a 
panorama, advance to the right to match 
an overlap shown, and tap again. When 
you’re done, tap a checkmark and wait 
from about 20 seconds (for four images) 
to a couple minutes (for a full 360°). The 
results are quite lovely, and automati-
cally saved into the photo roll.
I recommend Pano for users who want 
the least amount of ﬁddling and fuss, 
despite the extra dollar more than 
Panoramatic 360. The less expensive 
program rewards more time spent with 
it; Pano has a very shallow learning 
curve to achieve great results.

360 Panorama doesn’t require align-
ing edges to stitch images together, nor 
does it render in a fancy way. Rather, the 
app works hard at the time it's capturing 
images, which are taken continuously, to 
create a seamless panorama based on 
motion and image analysis. It's awfully 
good for the difﬁcult task at hand.

but are rather lovely in any case. Its big 
advantage is that no tapping is required 
nor any alignment of overlaps.
The results are more impressionistic 
than precise, but the pictures have quite 
a bit of charm. You have more options 
for how pictures are rendered than any 
of the other apps, too.
Tap the Camera icon on the main screen, 
and start slowly moving the camera 
around. When done, tap the Camera 
icon again, and a preview appears in the 
Light Table Collage style. That mode 
imperfectly but attratively overlaps pho-
tos in the rough physical layout in which 
they were taken. Six other styles are 
available, including tiled versions.
You can save the ﬁnal image to the 
Camera Roll, share on Twitter or 
Facebook, or send as email.
Options are few: you can choose to cre-
ate a kind of overhead torus that splays 
out the continuous image as if you were 
ﬂattening a globe (stereographic), or 
have a long strip (equirectangular). 
Images are saved automatically to the

Despite once being chemically scalded 
by an instant photo-strip booth near the 
Eiffel Tower—we came out unscathed, 
fortunately—I still have a soft spot in 
my heart for this antiquated instant 
photography. 
For a handful of quarters, the old booths 
would snap four black-and-white photos 
of you and friends in quick succession 
as you crammed into a small space and 
mugged. A few moments later, a devel-
oped strip pop`ped out the side. (Those 
photostrips are a plot point in the movie 
Amélie.)
IncrediBooth does a marvelous job of 
re-creating the experience of a photo-
booth without your having to carry 
around an inconveniently large object. 
The app uses the front-facing camera of 
an iPhone 4 or newest iPod touch.
There are no options, really. Press the 
button, watch the light blink, and pose, 
pose, pose, pose. 
A moment later 
slide over to 
the output tray, 
and the strip 
plunks down.

With iOS 4, Gorillacam was able to ﬁx 
one small problem in previous releases: 
the app takes longer to save photos than 
Apple’s built-in Camera app, and needed 
extra time to save. If you exited before 
saving, photos could be lost. With iOS 4, 
the app can ask iOS to ﬁnish up what it’s 
doing.
You might note that several of these 
features seem to require a way to keep 
an iPhone or iPod touch still. That’s 
because Joby also sells very nifty cam-
era mounts with ﬂexible legs, includ-
ing one designed for iOS devices: the 
Gorillamobile series (http://5str.us/t5e).
Gorillacam brings several features to 
taking pictures that mimic options on 
a camera. Apple doesn’t include these 
features for simplicity’s sake, but having 
them available (and at no cost) makes an 
iPhone more of a camera.
The app provides an onscreen grid and 
a level bubble to straighten or at least 
frame photos. One option lets you tap 
anywhere to take a picture, instead of 
using just the tiny camera button. You 
can also set a timer, take time-lapse 
pictures, and adjust for camera shake.
One feature I particularly like and use 
regularly is the three-shot burst. Unlike 
the new HDR (high dynamic range) fea-
ture in the iPhone 4 camera system, 
which combines multiple shots at dif-
ferent exposures, the three-shot burst 
takes three pictures as quickly as the 
app can, storing them separately.

CameraBag

Simulate classic camera lenses on and apply effects to your photos
Nostalgia is often tinted, and Camera-
Bag provides the means to evoke it. The 
app can apply effects to a picture taken 
using the iPhone or latest iPod touch’s 
camera; you can also select an image 
from any iOS device’s photo library. You 
choose among ﬁlters, some of which 
also crop the photo.
Some ﬁlters are camera styles, like 
Helga, Lolo, and Plastic (referring to 
a plastic lens). Others apply effects, 
like Fisheye, Infrared, and Mono. 
CameraBag goes even further, with 
effects that ape a particular photo-
graphic feel, such as 1962, 1974, or 
Magazine. You can tap to change ﬁlters, 
or swipe to cycle through them.
CameraBag has you set the resolution of 
the output photo before you save it to the 
device’s library or email the photo. The 
higher the resolution, the longer it takes 
to run the original through the ﬁlter. 
(What it shows onscreen is a preview.)
Why use CameraBag? When you want 
to transform the look of something into 
another era or appearance and want a 
consistent outcome. Other apps offer 
similar features, but focus on variability.
The iPad version (shown above) allows 
you to set border, ﬁlter, and cropping 
separately, and tap a Vary button to 
make random variations in a ﬁlter type.

See through to a photo’s essential nature
Chase Jarvis, a photographer who 
inspires other photographers, released 
Best Camera to allow the small changes 
to pictures that often make photos pop. 
Best Camera has no fancy features. It 
can make images starker by remov-
ing colors or more vivid by enhancing 
saturation. 
After taking a picture in the app or load-
ing one from the Photo Library, swipe 
along the bottom to look through ﬁlters. 
Filters are additive: keep applying them 
to layer effects. Tap the ﬁlter icon in 
the upper right and a display of all the 
applied effects appears at the bottom; 
tap an X to remove a given change. 
The program, which takes its name from 
the motto, “the best camera is the one 
that’s with you,” also hooks into several 
photo-sharing and social-networking 
services. With a single tap, you can 
upload to Flickr, post to Facebook, tweet 
at Twitter, save to your Camera Roll, and 
email the image out—and send a copy to 
Jarvis’s thebestcamera.com site. Photos 
on that site are accessible via the app, 
too, in a nifty photo-reveal interface.
Best Camera may help you become a

Film cameras with plastic lenses

Photogene 
$1.99 ǩOmer Shoor ǩhttp://5str.us/7sd
Sophisticated photo correction in a small package
Photogene is a tool for those with a mild 
to serious interest in image correction. 
The app has features recognizable to 
anyone who has ever needed to use a 
desktop program like Adobe Photoshop 
or Elements for ﬁxing color shift, adjust-
ing white balance, and redistributing 
light and dark through levels.
Start by loading a picture from your 
Photo Library or taking a picture if your 
device has a built-in camera.
Photogene divides its manipulations into 
several categories, some of which are 
corrections, while others are special 
effects or overlays. 
Crop and rotate commands let you take 
a photo and trim it, rotate it, straighten 
it, or ﬂip it. A ﬁlter option lets you 
choose sharpening, a way of improving 
the crispness of a picture when used in 
moderation, or from a number of special 
effects, like turning the image into a 
sepia-toned photo.
The color adjust view offers full-on lev-
els adjustment in which you can change 
the overall distribution of light and dark 
across a photo. It also allows simpler 
contrast/brightness adjustment, which I 
haven’t recommended using since 1991, 
and some color tweaking. 
The symbols and frames views seem 
a bit out of place with this app’s other 
features: you can add cartoon balloons 
or stars, or choose a frame around an 
image. I’d avoid these.
When you’re done adjusting, tap the 
checkmark. You can adjust the dimen-
sions of the resulting photo choosing 
from a list (which shows the widest or 
tallest side) or entering your own value.
The app caters to professionals in the 
Share menu, allowing the inclusion of 
IPTC tagging and an option to include or 
exclude geotagging coordinates.
You can share the photos in several 
ways: via Twitter, Facebook, or Flickr, or 
to an FTP account on a server, as well as 
copying it or emailing the picture.

photos for viewing on an iPad. Where 
Flickpad Pro homes in on sets and con-
tacts, Flickr Studio’s focus is more on 
time and place.
Flickr incorporates quite a bit of infor-
mation about each photo that’s uploaded 
to the service, including geographic 
coordinates if the picture was taken 
with a camera or mobile phone that 
embeds that information. You can also 
add location details from the Flickr Web 
site for photos that lack latitude and 
longitude.
Flickr Studio navigates among all this 
embedded and added information. The 
app’s home page shows a grid of your 
photos (after you log in with an account), 
with callouts showing the dates for each 
batch. Swipe over photos and hold to see 
a larger thumbnail; tap to view the pic-
ture at full size.
Flickr Studio lets you explore quite 
readily, too, with tabs for your contacts’ 
photos, for Flickr’s interesting photos of 
the day, and for pictures available from 
institutions that offer images for viewing 
and describing.
A map mode lets you both explore 
photos around you or anywhere in the 
world. If you’re viewing pictures and 
switch into the map mode—available in 
several places in the app—tiny thumb-
nails cluster around where those photos 
were taken. Tap to view.
Paid Flickr Pro users can view photos at 
the full stored resolution. Like Flickpad 
Pro, Flickr Studio doesn’t upload pic-
tures; they’re all about viewing.

iPad Camera Connection Kit 
$29.00 ǩApple ǩhttp://5str.us/j37
Great tool for bringing pictures directly from a camera into an iPad
The iPad doesn’t have a camera—or at 
least, the models available when I write 
this lack any—but you can still use an 
iPad to view images in the Photos app 
and manipulate them with software cov-
ered earlier in this chapter.
One way to do this is to sync albums, 
places, faces, and other collections 
between iPhoto on a Mac and your iPad. 
But you can also bring images directly 
into the iPad.
Apple offers the Camera Connection Kit 
to import pictures from a digital camera 
or Secure Digital (SD) memory card. The 
kit has two pieces, both of which plug 
into the standard Dock connector at the 
bottom of the iPad. One of the adapt-
ers has a USB jack at the other end; the 
other adapter is an SD card reader with 
a slot for that format of card.
When you plug in an adapter and 
either attach a supported digital cam-
era or plug in an SD card, the Photos 
app launches, and you can choose to 
import some or all of the photos with an 
optional delete of the original. The full-
resolution images are now resident in 
the iPad. You can forward them, upload 
them, and work with them more or less 
like any other image.
Because an iPhone or iPod touch also 
can act like a photo repository when 
either is plugged in via USB, you can 
perform the strange and unnatural act 
of connecting one of these smaller iOS 
devices to an iPad using the kit and 
import photos.
If you’re set up to sync with iPhoto on a 
Mac, the pictures you uploaded should 
be copied over the next time you sync.
With a 3G iPad and an active data plan, 
importing photos via the adapters can 
let you post pictures when you’re away 
from a computer and Wi-Fi network 
access. I’ve posted pictures when on 
trips just for fun.
You might think, “Hey, Apple has just 
given me a USB port! I should plug all 
kinds of things in!” Surprisingly, many 
USB devices can work with an iPad 
without ofﬁcial support. I’ve tested 
keyboards, external mic headsets, and 
speakers, and they all function. I’ve used 
a USB headset to make Skype calls. It’s 
unwieldy, but works.
Apple doesn’t offer a list of support digi-
tal cameras, but it appears that nearly 
all models are supported from major 
manufacturers.

$2.99 ǩDemiforce ǩhttp://5str.us/ppp
Addictive, absorptive game involving lining up the right triangles across three axes
Trism was one of the ﬁrst iPhone break-
out games that everyone was suddenly 
downloading and playing. Its essence is 
simple. You’re presented with a screen 
of equilateral triangles of different col-
ors. You move triangles as a ribbon that 
wraps around the edges either diago-
nally left or right, or horizontally. 
Line up three or more triangles across 
adjacent faces, and they’re removed. As 
in Bejeweled (p. 55), a game to which 
Trism owns more than a glance, assem-
bling a set of more than three triangles 
provides bigger rewards, and certain 
patterns are allotted badges, displayed 
on a trophies page. Matches cascade for 
more points as pieces removed for one 
match slide other sets of three or more 
triangles into new matches.
There are three modes of game play. 
Untimed gameplay is called Inﬁnism and 
a timed mode is Terminism. Challenges 
are inserted, such as a bomb that has to 
be cleared in a set number of moves.
The third mode is more intriguing. 
Syllogism is a set of levels in which you 
slide pieces together in the least num-
ber of moves. Gameplay uses device tilt-
ing to move all the free pieces in a given 
direction at once. Scoring is based on 
least moves to achieve the objective.
You can optionally create an account to 
share scores with a global leaderboard, 
or keep your obsession to yourself.

Bejeweled 2 + Blitz 
$2.99 ǩPopCap ǩhttp://5str.us/37g
The original jewel-dropping mind virus gets even better
In Action and Endless modes, line up 
four jewels and you prime a trigger that 
blows up a number of surrounding jew-
els on the next 3-or-more connection. 
Line up ﬁve jewels and a scintillating 
gem forms that can, when swapped with 
an adjacent jewel, zap all same-colored 
ones on the screen.
Blitz mode gives you one minute to score 
as high as you can. Blitz uses Facebook 
for sharing and connection, and lets you 
check scores against friends, track your 
score performance over the last ﬁve 
weeks, and brag by posting badges.
In Blitz, you can also buy performance-
enhancing extras, like a “mystery gem,” 
ﬁve extra seconds, and so forth.
The Facebook version of this app is tied 
in. If you visit Facebook, you can spin a 
wheel and earn more coins that you can 
spend in the Blitz mode of the app.
If any game is a mind virus, it’s 
Bejeweled. The original incarnation 
dates back to the Palm Pilot, where I 
whiled away many obsessed hours lining 
up and swapping jewels to drop rows. 
Bejeweled 2 + Blitz adds two new game 
modes and a multiplayer option hooked 
up via Facebook.
The point of Bejeweled is simple. Jewels 
drop from the top into a grid. Swap adja-
cent jewels (left/right or top/bottom) to 
get three, four, or ﬁve in a row vertically 
or horizontally. And suddenly it’s three 
hours later.
The original game rewarded you with 
points for lining up three or more 
jewels, and that mode of play is still 
available as Classic. Cascades of three 
jewels—where removing one set of 
three plus triggers removing subse-
quent sets of matched gems—earn even 
greater points.

You receive extra points for all manner 
of activities, from a long shot (a bounce 
across the board that knocks out an 
orange peg), to stylish plays, to dropping 
a ball into a moving pan at the bottom. 
That pan also grants an extra ball, and 
the game sometimes awards you extra 
balls with a special certﬁcate.
You must clear a board of all orange 
pegs before advancing to the next one, 
and clearing all the levels lets you move 
up to new challenges. The game is for 
either solo players, or two in a duel 
mode in which you alternate turns.
There’s no timing involved in the game; 
just judging the right bounce to clear the 
orange pegs.
The makers of Bejeweled, PopCap 
Games, know a lot about how to get you 
addicted. With Peggle, the game trades 
out speed for complexity, which leads to 
compulsion. Your goal is to clear orange 
pegs on a game board. The game space 
has up-down orientation, and balls obey 
gravity. The board is more like pachinko 
than pinball, but has aspects of both. 
The balls are shot from the top using a 
funnel you can aim by tapping. A ﬁne-
tune dial at right lets you adjust the pitch 
in tiny increments. A little set of aiming 
guidelines is painted as you move the 
funnel around to predict where the ball 
will go. One bonus provides exact and 
extended aiming prediction.
Green and purple pegs add special tools 
and bonus points. In a crab level, one 
bonus gives you crab claw paddles at 
either side of the bottom to bounce balls 
back into play.
Starting with a unicon, 10 ”Peggle mas-
ters” move you through 55 levels, offer-
ing advice between turns about clearing 
levels, scoring bonus points, and the zen 
of the game.

The free version (iPad only) provides just 
the ﬁrst several levels before encourag-
ing an upgrade. Ignore the mythology 
and enjoy the sport.
The framing story may seem a bit 
much at times—something to do with a 
wooded kingdom, a map, and amulets—
but the gameplay is quite engrossing. 
Trails lead to a scepter of sorts at the 
center, which can ﬁre gems. A snaking 
path of orbs tries to reach the scepter. 
Shoot out gems to build sets of three or 
more, which then vaporize.
Special enhancements appear, which 
you shoot to claim, when you clear 
out multiple sequences of orbs. For 
instance, knock out three green spheres 
dividing more than three red ones, and 
you get a bonus as the matches cascade 
when sets join up in the gaps.
The higher the level you reach, the more 
amulets you unlock. Amulets add pow-
ers, such as blasting 20 orbs away at 
once. Gameplay increases in speed and 
quantity of orbs as you advance.
The game is reminiscent of Bejeweled 
(p. 55) without being beholden to it. You 
can set different modes of play, which 
make the game harder or easier.

Take off your jacket and jump over objects piling up while grabbing ballons
Tilt, tap, tilt, tilt, tap, tilt, tap tap tap. The 
Incident makes two different game play 
elements collide: simplicity in controls 
with complexity in objects. Your little 
man in a tie, who removes his jacket at 
the game’s outset, has to jump away 
from falling objects, and then on top of 
fallen ones. 
Your goal is climb on ever-higher piles 
without getting smacked in the head too 
much or hit by skull-and-crossbones 
balloons, among other hazards.
Scramble up high enough, and you 
unlock new levels, each of which has 
a distinct background and theme from 
Street and City up to Orbit and Space. (In 
space, no one can hear you jump.)
Get smacked in the head too much, and 
you’re toast, but you get an award based 
on the object that got you. Balloons with 
red crosses renew your vigor, while 
an occasional helmet falls your way to 
guard your noggin.
The objects that fall are hilarious. 
Everything from the everyday (sofas, 
cars, refrigerators, and TV sets) to the 
weird and sublime (René Magritte paint-
ings, pediments from Greek architec-
ture, and blocks of ice with a frozen guy 
inside). If your avatar gets stuck under

Angry Birds HD 
$4.99 ǩClickgamer Technologies ǩhttp://5str.us/ksh
Why can’t angry birds and green, egg-stealing pigs get along?
The number of levels is astounding and 
expands regularly. You receive points 
for what you destroy and for penurious 
use of birds-as-weapons: bonus points 
are awarded for remaining birds. And 
even when you succeed in squashing 
pigs, success is ranked from one to 
three stars by points. This often shows 
you could be slightly more elegant in 
extracting sows’ ears, encouraging you 
to try again.
If  you miss but one 
pig on a level, it’s not 
complete. Worse, the 
pigs smirk at you.
Angry Birds is a silly, silly game involv-
ing ballistics, physics, angry birds, 
and green pigs. But it’s quite fun and 
playable. The premise is ridiculous, 
of course. In a pre-game movie (and 
separately available ﬁlm short), we 
see green pigs steal eggs from a set of 
birds. The birds vow revenge, extracted 
through many scenarios, each of which 
has its own bizarre animated opener.
Each level of Angry Birds comprises 
pigs under increasingly complicated edi-
ﬁces of lumber, glass, stone, and other 
materials, and birds that you slingshot 
in an arc to smash into said ediﬁces to 
crumple them and destroy the pigs. (It’s 
cartoon violence, and isn’t gory.)
The basic red bird ﬂies in a gravita-
tionally accurate arc. As you ascend in 
levels, additional bird types are added 
among the munitions you must deploy, 
including ones that lay bomb-like eggs 
(or egg-like bombs), and a multi-bird 
that splits into three separate projec-
tiles while tapped. Birds appear in a 
(sorry) pecking order: you have to ﬁre 
them in the order they’re queued.

Ramp Champ 
$1.99 ǩThe Iconfactory ǩhttp://5str.us/mz3
It’s like being on a constantly updated boardwalk
Skee ball is such an old-fashioned 
game to have modern appeal. But Ramp 
Champ has combined the silliness of 
rolling a ball to knock down things at the 
far end with the ﬂexibility of the digital 
world. When you get bored with one 
layout or have mastered it, there are 
add-on packs to challenge you with new 
goals and scoring targets.
Ramp Champ comes with several 
themed levels. Each level starts with 
nine balls. Flick the balls so they leap 
up and hit targets. If you’re particularly 
skilled, you can knock down two or more 
ﬁgures at once. A secret pattern of the 
correct items to knock down in each 
level adds more mystery. 
I found in the Trick or Treat add-on pack 
that hitting the pumpkin repeatedly in 
combination with another target was the 
key to one goal. (That level also features 
a guest shot from Iconfactory chief Craig 
Hockenberry in vampire form.)
When you exhaust the balls, the game 
spits out tickets. Earn enough tickets 
and you can redeem them for virtual 
swag. Achievements are also rewarded 
with tiny trophies.
The folks behind Ramp Champ are die-
hard Macheads, which you can tell from 
the Icon Garden level where you knock 
down famous Apple icons.

The game hooks into Facebook to chal-

Doodle Bowling Pro combines the look

with your ﬁnger ﬂicking to hurl the ball. 
You can give the ball some english by 
swiping up or down while it’s in motion. 
The app scores the game like standard

Real Racing

Racing that makes your heart speed up, too
There’s no game I’ve played on an 
iPhone that made my blood race quite as 
much as Real Racing. The app is a full-
body experience, even though you’re just 
tilting your iOS device and occasionally 
tapping on it.
Like all good road rally and racing 
games, you have a clear objective: be 
the fastest around a track. You have 
many choices on your path to racing 
supremecy, however.
The app offers the choice of several 
cars, with more available for unlocking 
as your skill level improves. Each car 
has particular attributes. You can adjust 
the assisted braking for each when you 
select one for a race. (The more assist, 
the less likely you are to spin off the 
track, but the less speed you can gain as 
a result).
To start in the game, you have to com-
plete a qualiﬁer in which you make it 
around a course in a minimum time. 
After that, you tap the Career button 
from the main menu to choose among 
courses. More courses are unlocked the 
longer and better you perform.
By default, you tilt your device to steer 
and tap or press the screen to brake. 
Acceleration automatically increases 
whenever you’re not braking—or haven’t 
just hit a wall or other obstacle. (There 
are no ﬁery explosions. You just have to 
steer yourself back on the track.) You 
can adjust the controls to several other 
settings, depending on what suits you.
The app simulates night and day, with 
sunlight poking you in the eyes during 
daytime races.
Real Racing lets you compete against 
nearby friends over Wi-Fi, or through 
ongoing online leagues you can join.

Orbital 
$2.99 ǩBitforge ǩhttp://5str.us/1mf
Your knowledge of gravity comes in handy with this seemingly simple game
Orbital supposes that gravity warps 
space, and it’s right. A gun of sorts sits 
at the bottom of the screen. Fire a ball 
of light, and, where it slows to a halt, 
it grows into a sphere bounded only by 
other spheres you’ve already created, 
and by the inside borders of the grid. 
Knock another sphere with the new 
comet, and a number in the middle of 
the struck sphere counts down. The 
number indicates how many times a 
sphere must be struck by a projectile 
before disappearing in a blaze of rain-
bow light.
What’s the challenge? Avoid bounce-
back across a line above the gun: stray 
one iota over that line and your game is 
over. The app zooms in dramatically for 
bounces that appear likely to cross.
The game requires patience and obser-
vation. A knowledge of billiards could 
help, as you bank shots.
You earn extra points for bounces that 
careen and take out more than one 
sphere in a shot. Compare points on a 
global leaderboard, and link to Facebook 
to share with friends. The high global 
scores show real dedication to the app.
In Gravity Mode, the grid distorts as you 
add spheres. Gravity pulls your projec-
tile into the orbit of existing bodies, and 
slingshots the shot around. Aim cor-
rectly and you can skip bounces off a 
sphere, killing it with one shot. 
Two other modes let you experiment 
with an Aristotolean universe (Pure 
Mode, in which gravity doesn’t distort 
the grid), and Supernova Mode, where 
you ﬁre a laser to point the direction you 
want a projectile to aim.
A two-player mode allows handing back 
and forth, and setting a best of X games 
to play: 1, 3, or 5. The free version only 
offers gravity mode up to 15 points.

The game’s goal is to keep zombies from

Pole-vaulting zombies run onto the ﬁeld

Fly a helicopter on rescue-and-destroy missions, tilting subtly to control ﬂight 
Chopper 2 is the most beautiful and sub-
tle game I’ve ever played that involves 
my avatar killing people. The controls 
are fantastic, relying on the various sen-
sors on an iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad 
to control the speed, height, and direc-
tion of a helicopter. The program takes 
advantage of the gyroscope included in 
newer iOS devices for ﬁner control.
Your mission is to rescue civilians, 
defend the fellows on your side, kill 
enemy forces with laser-aimed weap-
ons, and avoid hitting birds. 
The tilt controls are very sensitive, but 
you master them over time. When ﬁring 
weapons, the action becomes tricky: you 
must maintain the helicopter’s position 
while tapping to aim and ﬁre.
You work through 12 distinct locations, 
earning points along the way. A lovely 
17-minute soundtrack accompanies the 
adventure.
The developer took the time to add an 
interesting feature—if you own the right 
set of two or more iOS devices. You can 
use an iPhone or iPod touch as a remote 
control for an iPad, iPhone 4, or 4th-
generation iPod touch over Bluetooth or

It’s hard to do justice to the oddness and 
beauty of Osmos, which carries a strong 
whiff of the ineffable, even as you’re 
engaged in the play of the game.
Osmos is a remarkable game. It looks 
and behaves like nothing I’ve seen 
before. It’s compelling and beautiful. I’ll 
try to explain why.
Your avatar in the game is a blue cell 
with a jellyﬁsh-like pattern in the mid-
dle. You grow by absorbing smaller cell-
like objects; the smaller the cell, the 
more blue it is. Larger objects are red, 
and can absorb you.
By tapping in the direction opposite 
where you want to move your globule, 
you emit small or large jets of your 
own substance. But as you emit bits of 
yourself, you shrink; and your jets can 
be absorbed by other cells. There’s a 
ﬁne tradeoff between locomotion and 
extinction.
There are also ”anti-matter” cells (col-
ored green), which destroy an amount 
of red or blue cell components equal to 
themselves. Repulsing cells push back 
against you as you get closer.
Game play is divided at the top level into 
Odyssey and Arcade, although it’s not 
clear what the difference is. Both have 
you achieve particular game goals. 
Odyssey sports level names like 
Nemocyte and Warped Chaos, while 
Arcade shows you a glimpse of the 
starting position. Arcade levels have 
increasing types of difﬁculty unlocked 
as you advance. Some levels start static, 
while others have fast-moving cells 
already bouncing around. You can make

Canabalt 
$2.99 ǩSemi Secret Software ǩhttp://5str.us/nrn
If you don’t jump, you fall. And watch for boxes and explosions
At the end, you die—a metaphor for 
life as a whole, perhaps? Your score is 
simply how far you ran in game meters 
before it was all over.
One could argue that most early arcade 
video games were “leaping” games. Not 
all involved actually jumping, although 
Mario is a prominent example. But the 
notion of moving ever higher was there.
Canabalt has stripped down those game 
elements to a more raw level than an 
arcade game ever dared. You run and 
leap, but mostly run. A tiny mistake, 
and you’re gone. Scores aren’t in points, 
but in persistence. The tip of the hat to 
those old games is obvious, but it’s also 
subtle.
Canabalt is reminiscent of great eight-
bit video games of the Atari era, but with 
the speed and controls of an iPhone. 
Canabalt requires continuous focus; it’s 
not a casual game. The game is played 
entirely as a moving strip of action that 
scrolls from left to right.
You can’t look away for a moment from 
the running man you control. You time 
jumps to leap gaps between one building 
and the next, avoid packing crates, and 
miss being squashed by stuff dropped 
from moving airships. Buildings also 
randomly collapse. Sometimes, you 
must time a leap to smash through a 
window into one ﬂoor of a building.
There’s not much game control, but the 
time you hold down your ﬁnger corre-
sponds roughly to the arc of the jump. 
Need to catch a breath? Tap pause, and 
take ﬁve.
The app sometimes vibrates your phone 
or other device to offer an advance  
warning about planes or rockets. 
The background music can be changed, 
which is good as it becomes relent-
less. Tap in the upper-right corner on 
the main screen to cycle through three 
choices. The app recommends using 
headphones, and so do I: you’ll drive 
everyone around you crazy otherwise.
It’s very, very easy to die in his game, 
making the top scores more remark-
able. 103,285 meters? That could be a 
few days of someone’s time, with the 
pause button pressed between runs.

I was smoked almost immediately, my 
lack of recent chess experience showing 
through. The power formerly reserved 
to desktop computers to perform deep 
analysis for a strong competitor is now 
in the palm of your hand.
Deep Green can play a straightforward 
game right out of the box, as it were. 
Fire up the app (you play white), make 
a move, and the computer responds. 
Tap a piece and then tap its destination, 
or drag a piece to an appropriate (and 
legal) square. It’s all quite intuitive. 
Underneath the game board are ﬁve 
buttons affecting play: new game (you’re 
prompted to resign if a game is under-
way), revert a move (yours or the other 
player’s), replay the last move, suggest 
a move, and view game settings.
Tap the i button, and you can change 
game options, pitting yourself against 
another human, or having two computer 
opponents ﬁght it out. The computer 
logic can be adjusted for how well 
it plays by limiting or expanding the 
amount of time from 1 second up to 30 
seconds. There are also three tiers at 1 
second in which the computer examines 
even fewer potential moves.
For advanced 
players, the 
Setup options 
let you place 
pieces in start-
ing positions on a board to observe or 
play a newspaper, book, or well-known 
game. You can also change castling 
options and other rules. Games can be 
replayed step-by-step on completion. 
(The game has only two missing ele-
ments: allowing multiple active game-
boards, and storing completed games 
for later review.) 
Deep Green Chess’s roots are quite 
deep: the app dates back to the Apple 
Newton.

online (with push notiﬁcations announc-

place using pass-and-play turns.
After a game, you can play the same 
board again (to learn from mistakes), or 
watch a replay to relive your agony.
Affogato maintains its own user regis-
tration system (at this writing), and you 
set up an account with them associated 
with your email addess (not exposed) 
and a username. You can issue chal-
lenges for multiplayer games by picking 
one of your contacts, entering a user-
name, or asking for a random matchup 
against another Strategery user who has 
requested the same.
The most engrossing games often arise 
from exceedingly simple rules, and such 
is the case with Strategery, a name bor-
rowed from a George W. Bush parody by 
WIll Ferrell. Strategery pits you against 
competing empire builders, each with 
territory comprising different-sized 
irregular hexagon shapes.
You ﬁght to win more land by challeng-
ing adjacent property. The greater sum 
of a dice roll by the challenger or chal-
lenged makes the property shift hands. 
As you win more space, you acquire 
more dice (or “armies”) based on your 
continguous territory. 
More dice make it easier to ﬁght other 
competitors—but the dice guarantee 
you can’t be assured of winning. And 
sometimes you don’t want to throw a roll 
because you need a defense in the next 
round, keeping dice in reserve.
Game play can be set at varying levels 
of complexity, from easy to ”brutal,” and 
multiplayer games can be conducted

FlightControl

Act as an air-trafﬁc controller with your ﬁnger
I recall playing air-trafﬁc controller 
(ATC) games when I was kid, using text-
based terminal “graphics” (in which 
nothing used actual images), and later 
with primitive screen displays. Given 
how out-of-date ATC hardware was at 
the time, and still is, the experience was 
similar to the professionals and just as 
stressful.
FlightControl brings the ATC mindset 
without any of the charts, numbers, 
and other data. Planes and other ﬂying 
vehicles come in from the borders of 
the screen, indicated by an a red circled 
exclamation point before they appear.
You swipe a path from the plane or 
helicopter to an allotted landing strip or 
landing pad (which lights up when you 
start to swipe). The path you draw msut 
allow the craft to ply the air while main-
taining a minimum separation distance 
from other trafﬁc. Whew.
The game features ﬁve airport layouts 
and 10 types of aircraft, and the devel-
oper promises more. You can hook up 
to land planes with friends (via Wi-Fi 
or Bluetooth), earn achievements, and 
share results via Game Center. A lead-
erboard shows results from nearby, too, 
if you allow your location to be shared
Some levels are harder than others. 
They aren’t marked as such in the 
iPhone version. I crash planes into each 
other for the water-based aircraft car-
rier time and again.

Cat Physics 
$0.99 ǩDonut Games ǩhttp://5str.us/ubl
Two cats, one ball, and the laws of physics
The game has 50 levels, and scores are 
based on the efﬁciency of your path for 
the ball compared to an optimum route 
known only to the game’s designer. You 
score from one to three stars based on 
points, and can retry levels again and 
again, resetting arrows and other game 
components.
Cat Physics combines two things every-
one loves: cats...and science! Ok, not 
everyone may love science (or cats), but 
if you’re interested in trajectories and 
ballistics and enjoy the whimsy of having 
cats involved, this game is engrossing.
The premise is that two cats, in a cave-
like landscape, are trying to pass a ball 
from one to the other using least dis-
tance to do so. (Some scenarios feature 
more than two cats as well as strange 
outdoor landscapes.)
The cats are typically separated by odd 
gulfs, overhangs, cliffs, and other obsta-
cles. When the ball passes over any of 
a series of arrows scattered around the 
screen, it’s propelled with a bit of thrust 
in the indicated direction. 
Additional manipulators, like a spring-
loaded pusher, appear in some levels. 
Sometimes obstacles are made of glass. 
Two kinds of rotors act to redirect action 
when a ball falls on them.
One particularly interesting challenge 
involves a set of undulating walls; timing 
is critical in those levels.

Combine basic elements into ever more complex forms
Before the modern scientiﬁc method, 
many cultures believed that all material 
things comprised varying proportions of 
fundamental elements, like earth, water, 
ﬁre, and air (and sometimes the inef-
fable aether or ether). Doodle God plays 
off this cultural history by offering you 
the chance to mix and match four start-
ing elements to create (at this writing) 
196 organisms.
You start with basic mixtures. Fire and 
water become lava. Sand and earth 
become clay. And so on. But you soon 
start reaching fascinating patterns, like 
plugging Life and Swamp together to 
get a living, moving creature. Mythical 
creatures can also easily result. I 
crossed ﬁre with a bird and ended up 
with a phoenix; clay plus life brought me 
a golem.
This is no kingdom of life: some combi-
nations are rather bizarre. Fortunately, 
a light bulb button at the bottom gives 
you hints that may lead to the right con-
clusion. I was stumped at one point, until 
I was clued in that I could make coffee 
(seeds plus energy). A set of double light 
bulbs shows you the two categories that 
contain elements that might combine. 
After getting a hint, you have to wait a 
few minutes to get the next one.
You can review a list of combinations 
you’ve made that turned into new ele-
ments. If you’ve connected up with 
Facebook, you can tap a row, and then

It’s the ultimate bar trivia contest played

Questions are divided into easy, moder-

You can use a magnifying glass tool to

3x bonuses in a single row you choose. 
As you answer each question, you see

Slide a block one way, then another. 
The dragon remains trapped. Look at 
the whole pattern to see how one move 
unlocks another, then another. It’s mad-
dening, fascinating and inescapable.
Blue Block is a spatial game with one 
rule and one goal. Blocks from one to 
ﬁve units long in a six-by-six grid may 
slide only in their longest direction: left 
and right, or up and down, and only one 
at a time, even if two blocks could move 
in the same direction. Moving blocks 
in enough ways releases the “dragon’s 
block” which escapes through a gap to 
the right.
Depending on the version you use (free 
or paid), Blue Block has either thou-
sands or tens of thousands of puzzles 
to unlock. After unlocking a puzzle, you 
can return to it to improve the number of 
moves it takes to solve. An iPad version 
(shown at upper right) has beautifully 
rendered game graphics.

For those who prefer the classic wooden 
labyrinth game with no extras, Labyrnth 
meets the mark (below, far right). Its

although it can be turned off for those 
who ﬁnd it distracting.
The game includes over 1,000 levels, but

your phone, start creating a level, and 
download it. (A free version with 10 lev-

Labyrinth 2 HD is perhaps the apotheo-
sis of tilt-and-balance games that mimic 
old-fashioned wooden mazes through 
which you must carefully thread a ball.
The digital advantage is that you can 
have thousands of different designs, and 
features that no wooden game could 
offer. This includes a button that, when 
crossed by the virtual ball, splits it into 
two smaller balls. Magnets, fans, bolts 
blocking entrances (with buttons to roll 
over to release them), and other ele-
ments are scattered throughout.
The gameplay also includes cannons, 
some of which ﬁre balls that destroy 
your metal ones, while others ﬁre shots 
that act as additional elements to avoid 
or bounce off.
If the huge number of levels included 
isn’t enough to challenge you, Illusion

and iPad level editors which you can use 
to create and save your own levels.

Scrabble for iPad 
$9.99 ǩElectronic Arts ǩhttp://5str.us/rj8
A boardgame classic brought with superb extras to the virtual world
Scrabble isn’t one of a kind any more; it 
has competition from other board and 
digital word games. However, it’s an 
original and a classic, and the app ver-
sion is an able conversion.
You can choose from several forms of 
game play, whether in the same room 
or with other players on the Internet. A 
pass-and-play (“Pass’N Play”!) mode 
lets you hand an iOS device around to let 
each person take his or her turn while 
hiding the tile rack from other players.
The app lets you match up with 
Facebook friends after logging into that 
service. You can also join or offer public 
games with other Facebook users look-
ing for a match. A separate Tile Rack 
app for the iPhone or iPod touch (free) 
lets you put an iPad in the middle as the 
game board, using your smaller device 
to handle your game play.
Scrabble manages up to 25 games at a 
time. You can also pit yourself against 
the computer at varying levels of exper-
tise each of which limits the size of the 
word list the computer consults.
A shufﬂe option rotates your letters 
through random combinations, which 
can sometimes stimulate the little grey 
cells to come up with a new idea.
If you need a little help ﬁnding or verify-
ing words, an in-game ofﬁcial dictionary 
lets you type in words to test them (but 
not scan through them), and shows a 
list of all legal two-letter words. A hint 
feature will dig up the best word you can 
play up to four times per game.
After each turn, a board is updated at 
the top of the screen with each round’s 
word and score. It offers a way to ﬁgure 
out how your scorned opponent man-
aged to get 76 points with a three-letter 
play involving Q, Y, and Z.

The game lets you set up an account 
directly with the developer, and ﬁnd 
other registered friends using their 
in-game moniker. You can also con-
tact friends on Twitter and Facebook, 
although you’re not assured they own 
the app. 
If you don’t have pals, buddies, or tweet-
ers ready to play, the Random Opponent 
option tries to match you up with some-
one else who wants a game. 
The folks at Newtoy have a good sense 
of humor: the company released a free 
version of this app called Words with 
Pirates (http://5str.us/rdu) for inter-
national Talk Like a Pirate Day. All the 
words in that version be grrr! and arrr!
Words with Friends lets you play a 
quite familiar word game (cough,
Scrabble, cough) with friends in a 
turn-by-turn approach that allows up to 
20 simultaneous games to be conducted 
over a local network or the Internet. A 
separate chat follows each game, too, to 
let you taunt or whine at your partner.
For players in the same place, you can 
use a pass-and-play mode in which 
turns alternate, and the letter rack 
shows only the current player’s tiles 
during his or her turn. Moves are sig-
naled via push notiﬁcations. 
Perhaps trying to avoid criticism from 
Scrabble’s makers, the board puts 
words score bonuses in different places. 
This takes a little getting used to.
When you place a word and tap Submit, 
you’re blocked if any of the words 
formed aren’t in the standard dictionary.

and you tap the right bit of produce to 
add to your total.
The game can be played in single or

tap to cycle through a potential avatar, 
like a tomato, zucchini, strawberry, or 
onion, and then begin to play. Items

the text, “Pick this one!”
Each time the correct item is chosen, 
the next set that appears includes more 
bits of produce to make it harder to tap 
it the next time. Score too quickly and 
you have a screen of dozens of rotating 
farmers’ market candidates.

Cupcakes takes you through the process 
of making and decorating cupcakes. 
Start by choosing cupcake baking paper, 
followed by batter for a tray of four. 
The cupcakes are baked in an oven for 
the time you choose. Don’t be fooled 
by the “60-minute” timer—60 minutes 
takes about ﬁve seconds. The longer 
you put the cupcakes in for, the darker 
they become. Don’t get burned! (See the 
Cajun-blackened cupcakes above right.)
After baking the cupcakes, you shake 
them out, and then decorate. The num-
ber of decorations possible is quite 
overwhelming. The “overchoice” might 
paralyze some kids—it nearly did me. 
You choose among frosting, toppings, 
branded jelly beans, and candy letters. 
Each of those categories has a huge

spend a good hour just decorating.
Once decorated, a cupcake can be put 
in the fridge as a cupcake copy, shared 
(including the “recipe” for making it), or 
eaten. Complete cupcakes can also be 
emailed as a photo, saved to the Photo 
Library, uploaded to Facebook, or sub-
mitted to a Hall of Fame. The cupcake at 
right was sent to me by my children. 
In the eating stage, you can add a ﬁll-

While solving problems, a work area

There’s also a built-in ”problem solver.” 
This tool walks you through solving an

a problem to its component pieces. 
The app has charm without losing track

Arithmetic drills can be tedious, but 
they remain the foundation of lifelong

MathBoard at least makes them well-
presented, fun challenges. The iPad app 
emulates a chalkboard, which may mys-

The software lets you choose among 
seven operations. They include the 
familiar addition, subtraction, mul-
tiplication, and division. But you and 
your children will be challenged by 
squares, cubes, and square roots. These 
advanced operators stretch the program 
from elementary school to far beyond.
You can set limits to avoid frustration 
or increase the challenge for yourself 
and others. For instance, you can set 
the total number of problems to solve 
in a set, or adjust the range of numbers 
to avoid problems that include values 
that are beyond the mathematical scope 
of the person using the program. A 1st

The Cat in the Hat 
$3.99 ǩOceanhouse Media ǩhttp://5str.us/d2u
The whimsy of the book is preserved for young readers and all listeners
The book’s graphics were scanned at 
extremely high resolution, revealing the 
great art of Ted Geisel, as well as his 
terriﬁc text.
My three year old, Rex, sat next to me, 
transﬁxed. He’d heard The Cat in the 
Hat by Dr. Seuss before, but never quite 
in this format. On the iPad, the book 
was reading to him, zooming in and 
out on the pictures slowly as the story 
unfolded.
He could tap any object on screen, and 
its name would appear in overlaid type 
while the word or words were spoken, 
often in an appropriate character voice. 
A little swipe, and we advanced to the 
next page.
The app can be used more like a book, 
too, in which pictures and words appear, 
and you or your young reader gives voice 
to them. Tap the text in this mode, and 
it’s spoken. Each word turns red as it is 
said aloud.
I commend the less-is-more approach 
of the app developers, similar to some of 
the best “videos” of books where images 
from the story are slowly enlarged and 
then remain static, rather than being full 
of extraneous motion.

Duck Duck Moose makes great apps for 
kids. My favorite—mostly because it’s 
my kids’ favorite—is Itsy Bitsy Spider. 
The app sports beautifully-drawn col-
orful imagery, and it plays the familiar 
song about the indefatigable spider. 
What makes it wonderful is simple: tap 
on anything to make something happen.
Sure, you can (and should) tap on the 
spider itself. That advances it to another 
of the app’s four panels, and sings the 
next line of the song. But tapping every-
where else produces fun outcomes and 
adds to the app’s appeal.
Tap on a window, and a random ani-
mal might ﬂy out, complete with silly 
sound effect. Tap again, and a new one 
appears. As the spider progresses on 
his journey up the waterspout, you’ll 
occasionally encounter colorful eggs. 
Tap them, and they’ll land on the spi-
der’s head. Collect enough and, at the 
apex of his journey, create a rainbow.
These literal Easter eggs are easy 
for children to discover, and mine ﬁg-
ured them out quickly. You can turn a 
caterpillar into a butterﬂy, stack hats 
from ﬂying birds onto the spider’s head, 
and more.
As in most Duck Duck Moose apps, 
you can change the music to a simple 
orchestration or another language. Even 
better, you can record yourself—and 
your kids—singing the tune, too.

A free version features just a small 
handful of puzzles, but is otherwise 
identical.
While Tozzle is an iPhone/iPod touch-
optimized game, it looks just ﬁne 
double-sized on my iPad, like many kids’ 
games.
My kids wake up too early. When daddy’s 
not ready to open his eyes all the way 
and the young ones are clamoring for 
attention, Tozzle can score me an extra 
half hour of shuteye.
The game offers more than 30 colorful 
puzzles. New pieces to ﬁt into the puzzle 
are presented one at a time, and you (or 
more likely, your toddler) simply drags 
the object and drops it into position. 
Every puzzle piece you place triggers a 
silly sound effect or cheer.
If you can’t ﬁgure out where to position a 
tough piece, Tozzle eventually shows an 
arrow to guide you in the right direction.
Puzzles become interactive once you 
solve them: the musical instrument or 
virtual machine you’ve assembled can 
be played or operated.
A cleverly implemented dragging mech-
anism prevents kids from dismissing the 
puzzle they’re working on accidentally. 
That’s not to say one clever youngster 
couldn’t ﬁgure out how to do it—inten-
tionally!—when ready to switch to a new 
puzzle.
The puzzles range in difﬁculty. Easier 
ones feature a few big animal shapes 
or letters, while more complex ones 
require dozens of pieces—some of them 
quite small. The puzzle pieces are per-
fectly suited for kids’ tiny ﬁngers.
As an added bonus, the game should 
boost shape recognition and ﬁne motor 
skills. But the most important part is 
simple: it’s pretty darn fun.

Hulu Plus 
FREE* ǩHulu ǩhttp://5str.us/ﬁt
Network television and more wherever you go
Hulu.com launched with a splash: Get 
broadcast television programs at stan-
dard-deﬁnition quality streamed over 
the Internet to your computer. The cost? 
Watching ads—but not nearly as many 
as on TV. (A Hulu hour has a few min-
utes of ads, which compares to 15–20 for 
cable and broadcast.)
But Hulu had a few weaknesses. New 
shows are broadcast over the airwaves 
(remember those?) at high-deﬁnition 
quality, and similar HD quality shows 
can be downloaded for a price from the 
iTunes Store and other digital stores. 
Further, many programs were available 
only in snippets, and complete episodes 
were only available for a few weeks.
Hulu Plus tries to bridge that gap. For 
$9.99 per month, the service brings 
streaming HD-quality programs for a 
show’s current season and adds com-
plete archived past seasons. You still 
have to watch ads, but that’s part of the 
deal to avoid more complicated, illegal, 
or expensive ways to obtain the same 
programming.
The Hulu Plus universal app is part 
of the service. Subscribers can also 
stream standard and HD video to a 
browser on a Mac or Windows computer.
Your Hulu subscriptions (programs you 
track) and queue (new episodes of those 
programs) are a tap or two away. You 
can browse for programs and add them 
to your queue, as well as browse and 
watch immediately.
Subscriptions are invititation only as I 
write this, but Hulu Plus is expected to 
go into wide release by 2011.

and slowly. There’s no queue manage-
ment or other useful account features. 
The iPod/iPhone ﬂavor isn’t beautiful, 
but organizes results in a simpler and 
faster-to-navigate fashion.
Netﬂix makes the cut because of the 
sheer fun of having its streaming library 
available from any iOS 4 device. The 
company clearly needs to make the iPad 
ﬂavor of the app behave more like an an 
iOS program—but I’d rather have it in 
this form than not at all.
Netﬂix has tens of thousands of mov-
ies and television shows available for 
instant streaming to its subscribers. 
The Netﬂix app brings your account and 
access to any iOS device, so long as a 
network connection is available.
You can see your instant queue, and add 
new items to it, as well as pick up at 
the point you left off in movies that you 
started viewing elsewhere.
The app automatically reduces band-
width use over a 3G network, but you 
can still burn up a considerable amount, 
as much as 250 MB an hour. Over Wi-Fi 
networks, there’s no app-based band-
width limit (watch for speciﬁc hotspot 
or home broadband caps on usage) and 
the quality is generally better, but that 
depends on the Internet connection.
The iPad appearance of this app has the 
worst interface of any included in this 
book. It’s merely the company’s Web 
site, which works in the app erratically

$2.99 ǩinMethod ǩhttp://5str.us/h5r
Stream video from computers on the local network without converting
Air Video has a simple purpose: to give 
you access to video stored on comput-
ers, whether a dedicated home-enter-
tainment system or other computers 
you use for ordinary purposes. Free Mac 
OS X (10.5+) and Windows (XP, Vista, 7) 
server software is available.
Each computer that you set up with 
access software needs to be conﬁgured 
to point to folders containing the video 
you want to watch remotely. 
The server can also be set up to convert 
video to a speciﬁed resolution and qual-
ity, which can reduce or expand band-
width requirements. (Smaller ﬁles will 
stream better, but the video quality will 
be poorer, too.)
In the app, you connect to a server on 
the local network, and can browse 
the folders that were set up on that 
machine. There’s an option in the server 
software to provide access over the 
Internet, too. Watch your 3G bills!
Select a video to play. If it’s in a format 
that iOS can play without conversion, you 
can stream the original ﬁle immediately. 
You can also choose to convert the ﬁle to 
reduce the ﬁle’s size for better use over 
the network.
For other formats, you can choose 
to convert (which puts the ﬁle into a 
queue), or play with live conversion. Live 
conversion quality depends on the ﬁle’s 
original resolution and the power in your 
computer’s processor. A slower machine 
can cause hiccups in playback.

certain video formats, and the rest need 
to be converted, which can be tedious 
and time consuming. ZumoCast’s trans-
coding turns most video formats into 
iOS-compatible streams. 
ZumoCast is divided into Files, Music, 
and Video. The software recognizes 
music and video type and builds a cata-
log from which you can select. Files 
shows the raw contents of the folders on 
a given computer.
The system picks up as much organiza-
tion from the original as it can, showing 
music in albums and videos in folders.
ZumoCast gives you access to all the 
movies and audio you have stored on all 
your computers. One ZumoCast account 
makes this media available to you over a 
local network or the Internet via this app 
or a Web browser.
To make this all work, you start by set-
ting up a free account at ZumoCast. You 
then install a small, free server pack-
age on as many computers you like. The 
software is available for Windows and 
Mac OS X. On each computer enter your 
ZumoCast account information, and use 
a folder organizer to link in your directo-

Messaging & Voice

Skype 
FREE* ǩSkype Software ǩhttp://5str.us/n6v
Free high-quality Internet phone calls and text chat worldwide with no fuss
Skype made its reputation by letting 
people talk to each other at no cost and 
with high voice quality over the Internet 
using its free software. The Skype app 
took a few revisions, along with changes 
to Apple’s iOS, before it brought the 
same level of ease and access to mobile 
devices. A few pieces are still missing.
Skype’s desktop software offers audio, 
video, and text chat between Skype 
users, as well as screen sharing. For 
extra fees, you can place and receive 
calls from the regular phone network, 
have a voicemail box, and send text 
messages worldwide. 
The iOS app incorporates most—but 
not all—of those features: it can handle 
audio calls and audio chat, as well as 
text chat and text messaging. Video and 
screen sharing aren’t available yet. You 
set up features on Skype’s Web site, 
such as an inbound phone number, and 
those features are then available in the 
iOS app. (Text messaging involves a per-
message fee, as in the desktop version.)
Tens of millions of people already use 
Skype, and you can place direct calls 
from this app to them. There’s no calling 
plan required and no per-minute fees.
You can use Skype credits to call regu-
lar phone numbers anywhere in the 
world, which are charged at Skype’s low 
metered rates. If you buy an inbound 
phone number, this app can receive calls 
from the public phone network.
iOS 4 can notify you about incoming calls 
when Skype isn’t active, so long as you 
signed in to Skype the last time you used 
it. You can also exit Skype when a call is 
in progress without losing the call.
Skype includes support for voice and 
text chat over 3G, not just over Wi-Fi. 
Skype audio consumes little bandwidth.

Line2 
FREE* ǩToktumi ǩhttp://5str.us/21e
A replacement for voice calling on an iPhone or any iOS device
a regular cell call comes while you’re 
talking over Line2, you can shunt the 
cell caller to voicemail and resume your 
Line2 conversation. The software works 
over both 3G and Wi-Fi. 3G VoIP is ini-
tially turned off, as you could rack up 
cell data fees on limited plans. 
Toktumi offers text messaging just like 
a cell company. This means no compro-
mises about with which other networks 
you can exchange messages, and no 
charges for such messages.
Calls outside the U.S. and Canada are 
charged at relatively low international 
rates—extremely low compared to the 
ridiculous prices cell carriers levy.
Line2 also lets you use your cellular 
connection to handle its calls when, say, 
the data connection is poor. This keeps 
the cost of international calls low, and 
makes sense on evenings and weekends 
when many cell plans don’t meter voice.
People often complain about the high 
cost of cellular voice and text-messag-
ing plans relative to the cost of data on 
the same plan. And that’s a legitimate 
complaint. Even with the cost of AT&T 
and international carriers’ metered 3G 
service for iPhones and 3G iPads, you 
still pay several cents a minute for cel-
lular calls that would be the equivalent 
of a penny or less for an Internet call.
Toktumi seems to have ﬁgured out 
a middle ground between pure VoIP 
services like Skype and pure calling 
services offered by cell companies. This 
option could save quite a bit without any 
apparent sacriﬁce. 
The ﬁrm’s Line2 app and service pro-
vides unlimited calling and text mes-
saging to U.S. and Canadian numbers, 
as well as voicemail and a variety of call 
features. You get a “real” phone number, 
too, with the state and area you choose.
Line2 works well with the latest iOS 4 
features: even when the program isn’t 
running, incoming calls prompt push 
notiﬁcations you can use to answer. If

BeejiveIM answers the question of how 
to cope with proliferating instant-mes-
saging (IM) software. The app lets you 
enter multiple accounts from any sup-
ported services, which include AIM (AOL 
Instant Messenger)/Apple MobileMe, 
Facebook, Google Talk, Jabber servers, 
MySpace, Windows Live Messenger, and 
Yahoo Messenger.
After setting up accounts, you can log 
in or out of all of them at once, and set 
the same status message across all of 
them. With push notiﬁcations turned on, 
BeejiveIM alerts you to new IMs even if 
it’s not the app you’re running.
Buddies from every service are uniﬁed 
into single entries, even if they have 
multiple accounts at a single chat sys-
tem. Icons next to their names identify 
the instant-message networks to which 
they’re connected. Online status and 
status messages are shown. Group 
chats are supported on several services.
The app makes it easier to switch among 
active chats, send photos (either a pic-
ture you take or an image from your 
library), and record audio. You can even 
tap a mail icon to ship off a transcript of 
the chat to the other party.
BeejiveIM can also use AIM or Yahoo to 
send out text messages (SMS) over the 
cell network.

move the information over. You can also 
include photos, which bumps up data 
usage slightly, but not much. Even with 
a 200 MB per month cellular data plan, 
heavy Textie usage will seem negligible. 
With push notiﬁcation enabled for Textie, 
incoming messages from the program 
pop up on screen just as with a carrier-
backed text message. Textie does not 
have to be running. Messages are 
threaded by sender, too. 
Textie can send outgoing cellular text 
messages at no cost to the sender to 
most U.S. networks due to a quirk in 
how these systems connect; T-Mobile 
and Sprint won’t accept such messages 
at this writing. Recipients can reply.
Carriers charge 1,000 times more than 
their near-nothing costs. Textie turns 
that imbalance around. With little fuss, 
you can shave dollars off your phone bill 
by Textie-ing with your friends.
Textie Messaging bypasses the ridicu-
lous cost of text-messaging systems by 
not using them. Borange has built its 
own server systems that pass messages 
among Textie users, storing and for-
warding them—cheaply for them, and no 
cost at all to you.
Textie is free but sports ads; you can 
pay $1.99 to remove them. The program 
requires you to register phone numbers 
and email addresses you want associ-
ated with your account. Your best bet for 
making Textie useful is to convince oth-
ers you know to also register their com-
mon information.
Textie allows both phone numbers and 
email addresses to be used as the recip-
ient’s destination. When someone wants 
to contact you, they enter either bit of 
data, and if it’s registered with Textie, 
the message uses a few bytes of a 3G 
cellular plan or a Wi-Fi connection to

Google Voice

Google Voice isn’t an app yet, but it’s just as useful
Google Voice isn’t an iOS app—yet. It’s 
a Web app that I include in this book 
for sheer utility, the only one of its kind 
here. Why? Because due to a seemingly 
long-running dispute between Apple 
and Google, an app version of Google 
Voice submitted in 2009 still hasn’t been 
approved (nor has it been rejected) by 
Apple. U.S. government agencies are 
involved in the dispute.
But never mind that: why use Google 
Voice? Because it can let you work 
around the high price of international 
calling and domestic texting. The main 
Web app interface lets you place calls 
through an interesting workaround: you 
dial the number or select it from con-
tacts you’ve deﬁned. Google then sends 
you a text alert to dial one of its num-
bers. Tap Call and that number connects 
you to the other party.
For calls between two end points in the 
U.S., that doesn’t make sense, as you’re 
still using minutes from your voice 
pool. That’s unlike Skype’s or Line2’s 
systems, which create pure data con-
nections over 3G and Wi-Fi. But for 
international calls, Google Voice charges 
low per-minute rates while consuming 
U.S. minutes. (Calling a non-U.S. cell 
number outside of Canada and a few 
other countries, however, is still quite 
expensive on Google, Skype, or anyone.)
You can also send and receive text mes-
sages via Google Voice at no cost. And 
you can access incoming voicemail, 
which is roughly transcribed.
At some point, Google Voice will become 
a ”real boy” and make it into the App 
Store, at which point it will compete 
directly with Skype, Line2, and other 
offerings. For now, the Web app is useful 
if you already use Google Voice to man-
age calls on your desktop.
Note: As the book went to press, Apple 
had approved two third-party Google 
Voice apps that act like souped-up Web 
apps, but were truly standalone pro-
grams. These apps don’t provide VoIP 
calling or other call-around service. Nor 
are they written by Google. By the time 
you read this, a Google-built Google 
Voice app could be available.

Where do you want to go today? And how do you 
plan to get there? Apps that can answer those 
questions form the backbone of the utility of iOS. 
Navigation and travel apps help you ﬁnd your way 
from point A to B to C by car (or see where you’ve 
been en route), and help you travel through the air—
while coping with hassles on the ground.
Travel & Navigation

TomTom U.S.A. 
$39.99 ǩTomTom International ǩhttp://5str.us/zjz
The power of a standalone GPS mostly transferred into iOS
TomTom is one of the giants in naviga-
tion hardware, and it’s brought much of 
what made it a success there to its iOS 
app. Thoughtful changes were required 
to make it work on a smartphone.
Maps are included with the app, which 
boosts the size to over 1.3 GB. Each 
update to maps or program features 
requires a full download. But it’s conve-
nient to have the maps built in: no net-
work connection is required en route.
If you want trafﬁc updates—indis-
pensible information for anyone 
who commutes by car, as far as I’m 
concerned—you buy for a separate 
$19.99-per-year in-app upgrade. 
Updates are sent every three minutes. 
(Trafﬁc does require data access and 
use, but it’s relatively minimal.)
TomTom offers a huge set of options 
for choosing a destination, including a 
Google search, Contacts, entering an 
address, and ﬁnding nearby points of 
interest (POIs), like gas stations, hotels, 
or parks.
Navigation is presented quite well. By 
default, the map uses faux 3D (a ﬂat 2D 
grid tipped to provide the feeling of dis-
tance). You can switch to 2D or see ﬂat 
map representations of your map at any 
time. POIs are shown on the map, but 
you can choose which categories appear, 
including none at all. Spoken directions 
are generally clear, although the app 
really should know how to pronounce 
Los Angeles correctly (with a soft G, not 
the hard G of the Spanish original).
TomTom can work in the background 
under iOS 4 if you answer a call or 
switch to another app. With calls, 
navigation updates appear as on-screen 
push notiﬁcations. With another app, 
instructions are spoken while you’re 
using that foreground program.
GPS NAVIGATION ///
112
/// TRAVEL & NAVIGATION

I pay a lot of consideration to how navi-
gation apps interact with audio playback, 
as I’m often listening to music or a pod-
cast in the car. TomTom lacks a built-
in music player, found in some other 
programs. You can tap a musical note 
icon to pause and play music already 
selected in the iPod or other background 
audio app. Because of TomTom’s iOS 
4 support, however, you can just swap 
to an audio program to make changes 
without interrupting navigation.
The app also allows a separate adjust-
ment to control whether spoken direc-
tions fade back music or audio, reducing 
its volume, or pause playback while 
speaking. You can even adjust the vol-
ume of spoken directions. In other apps 
that lack this control, the navigator voice 
may blare out substantially louder than 
a podcast or music—it’s unnerving. 
The app can be set to speak numbers, 
streets, and trafﬁc messages, or you 
can disable any or all.
The app also works with an external

A different kit is available for 2nd-
generation and later iPod touch models

Clearer maps and better audio control
This app is an excellent alternative to 
TomTom, with different strengths. Its 
key weakness? Navigon lacks robust 
address selection; you can’t select from 
contacts, and address entry can be 
tedious.
But its navigation is top notch. The app 
presents streets and upcoming turns a 
bit better than TomTom, and shows retail 
and other POIs as a cleaner part of the 
landscape.
Navigon shines at audio support, with 
numerous options for controlling the 
interaction of spoken directions and 
music playback, including full iPod con-
trol within the app.

MotionX GPS Drive 
$0.99* ǩMotionX ǩhttp://5str.us/ht5
An inexpensive way to get from point A to B without a loss of quality
to download and cache all the maps 
needed. The developers recommend 
running simulation at two times nor-
mal speed—it can run up to eight times 
faster—to have time to download all the 
necessary map pieces. You can set GPS 
Drive to hold up to 2 GB of cached map 
data, but you have to clear it out through 
an option in settings for fresher results.
MotionX is 99¢ for a 30-day trial of voice 
navigation. All other features remain 
active even if you don’t subscribe. It has 
among the best voice navigation, with 
the clearest tone and best pronoun-
ciation. Voice navigation is linked to an 
account, which can be available to mul-
tiple devices, but only be active on one 
device at a time.
Audio playback support is terriﬁc: a full 
iPod controller is available for select-
ing music and podcasts with options 
just like the iPod app; a mini-controller 
handles playback, shufﬂe, and repeat.
MotionX seems to have a mission to 
charge the least for turn-by-turn GPS 
navigation software of any product on 
the market. Fortunately, the ﬁrm doesn’t 
forego quality in its drive for low cost.
It’s also a useful collection of other 
location and navigation features beyond 
turn-by-turn directions, including com-
pass, position, and nearby search.
You start at the menu, where you can 
tap Search and then one of several icons 
for a quick result. Icons correspond to 
airports, gas stations, food, and parking, 
and there are links for manual entry and 
a search for locations as well. Instead, 
you can tap Go To in the menu, and 
select from over 15 links there, includ-
ing Zip code and Contacts. 
The Position feature reveals your cur-
rent precise coordinates, heading, and 
speed. But it also lets you tap one of 
three buttons to save the position, make 
it your home location (which is often 
a lot of fuss in other apps), or a “Park 
Spot.” That last item adds your position 
to a parking spot list in the Go To menu.
The app doesn’t include maps within 
itself, which makes it a tiny download 
at 11 MB. However, this means all data 
has to be pulled down over the air, and 
that can rack up cellular data bills if you 
travel extensively. Trafﬁc information is 
included, but it’s automatically ﬁgured 
into routes and not displayed as alerts.
The app does offer a simulation mode 
that can be run in advance of a trip

AT&T Navigator

Avoid trafﬁc jams with this constantly updated subscription navigation aid
AT&T Navigator eschews features in 
favor of quality. Some competing naviga-
tion apps have the kitchen sink included, 
with dozens of preferences. But when 
you’re setting up a route and driving, 
simplicity is key.
Choose a destination from your con-
tacts, by address, or by searching for 
business names or types, and go. AT&T 
Navigator is the best app I’ve tried (out 
of 14 that I tested) at consistently ﬁnding 
Contacts addresses, where even Google 
Maps has failed. 
A voice navigation option is fairly 
remarkable but not perfect. You can 
speak street numbers and addresses, 
and the app works hard to match, but 
can’t always get it right. You can also 
speak searches for points of interest, 
like a gas station or coffeeshop.
Trafﬁc is part of the price of the monthly 
or yearly app subscription and is inte-
grated within navigation. As you drive, 
you can tap Summary and select Trafﬁc 
Summary to see what’s ahead, or tap 
Minimize All Delays to reroute around 
jams. A Maps & Trafﬁc view also allows 
you to see current trafﬁc conditions 
wherever you want, and to tap on alerts 
for more details without a route plan.
Directions and other information are 
spoken by a pleasant voice that some-
times sounds a bit spliced together.
Maps and trafﬁc updates download as 
they’re required, and you need a cel-
lular data or Wi-Fi connection to con-
tinue to view navigation if you vary from 
the planned route. This keeps the app 
compact and up to date, but can have an 
impact on your data bill.

Kayak

A shortcut to ﬁnding the best prices for ﬂights, hotels, and more
Kayak keeps it simple despite the pile of 
different features under its hood. While 
the app focuses on price comparison 
for air fares, hotels, and car rentals, it 
also offers plenty of information: air-
port details (via GateGuru, next page), 
ﬂight status, airline fees, bag fees, price 
alerts, currency conversion, and a whole 
lot more.
For starters, you turn to Kayak to save 
money. The free app gives you quick 
access to price results at many different 
travel sites. Those results are organized 
by a travel plan (like a particular set of 
ﬂights) that you use to choose at which 
site to book. That includes Kayak’s own 
booking service, if it’s available for a 
given itinerary. You can also set alerts 
for a ﬂight plan to be notiﬁed if the price 
changes. You can set those updates to 
appear daily or weekly—on screen and/
or via email—and pick a price threshold 
above which you’re notiﬁed.
The app’s Buzz tab lets you see at a 
glance what the current prices are—
best and average—for a route across a 
month. This can help if you are ﬂexible 
about the dates you want to ﬂy.
The app also books hotels and cars, 
letting you specify locations and land-
marks. For hotels, I like the division 
into choice (a combination of value and

Airline terminals seem designed to

GateGuru clears away the mist before

Airports are paired with information 
divided by terminals; if you don’t know

airport’s design, sometimes), tap Entire 
Airport, and then tap Map in the upper 
right corner.
If you pick a speciﬁc terminal, you see

offers from restaurants and clubs. Each 
terminal’s detailed map is available, too. 
ATMs, restaurants, newsstands, bars, 
and other useful points of interest are 
paired with reviews left by GateGuru 
users. The reviews can be helpful in 
guiding you to a decent meal or an ATM

$4.99 ǩZirak ǩhttp://5str.us/iin
If you don’t know where you’ve been, how do you ﬁnd it again?
If you hike, bike, stroll, or even drive 
paths regularly, you might want to stake 
out where you’ve been, and ﬁnd out 
some information about the route, too. 
By foot or bike, tracking a trail lets you 
ﬁgure out distances and elevations for 
training or for tracking improvements.
EasyTrails GPS, which requires an iOS 
device with a GPS receiver, can record 
a track as you traverse it, and provide 
live and archived details. Even its main 
screen is useful after it gets a good GPS 
ﬁx (indicated by the number of green 
bars): the page shows your current alti-
tude, speed, and coordinates.
Tap the Rec (record) button, and the 
app starts tracking points along your 
route. You can tap pause or stop but-
tons along the way, or tap the trash can 
to cancel and delete the current route. 
Information about the track is displayed 
as you go, including the current altitude, 
speed, distance, and time elapsed, as 
well as the average speed underway, 
and the current coordinates. This is use-
ful for exploring a path—and deciding if 
you might be going too far!
Three icons at the bottom provide 
alternate views: a compass shows the 
current heading; charts compare time, 
distance, and altitude; and the Map 
reveals the current route as recorded.

in other apps: you don’t need WebDAV (p.

its own Web server.
The app places conﬁguration options in 
the iOS Settings app; that’s where you 
choose units (feet/inches or meters), 
sound cues (when a GPS signal is lost or 
you’re near a set waypoint), and security 
for Wi-Fi sharing.   
Map view has two other useful options. 
Tap the ﬂag icon and you can add a 
waypoint, a set of coordinates to which 
you attach a name and can add a pho-
tograph. This can be helpful when 
planning a run or trip, and you want to 
associate a place with a mile marker. 
You can also tap the big R button and 
pull up a previous track to follow.
When your route is complete, tap the 
stop button in the Dashboard view, name 
and describe the track (both optional), 
and tap Save. The Tracks tab now shows 
your latest outing. You can review that 
route on a map, and examine charts.
As a long-time cyclist, I appreciate the 
altitude charts that are generated. I’m 
always wondering about the elevation 
of a given ride, wanting to see both how 
hard it was and compare it to other 
rides. Often, these elevation proﬁles are 
found only in guide books. EasyTrails 
shows both the altitude over time and 
over distance.
Runners will like the time over distance 
chart that lets them track their average 
speed at mile marks, as well as eleva-

Reviews by other people of what’s nearby, especially restaurants
Yelp brought peer review of restaurants, 
services, and other kinds of businesses 
to the Web. Previous efforts didn’t seem 
to get large enough numbers to write 
up any but the best-known and largest 
ﬁrms and locations. The Yelp app brings 
its ﬁrst-person insight to iOS, enhanced 
by location awareness.
Yelp’s app is in many ways superior to 
the Web site, which has layers of navi-
gation. The app shows what you need 
to know, stripped down for faster and 
easier searching, display, and reading. 
Tap the Nearby tab, and select the kind 
of business you’re looking for, and a list 
ordered by distance quickly appears.
Because Yelp has evolved into yet-
another-social-networking site, you can 
also use the app to check-in at a loca-
tion, notifying friends (and others, if you 
choose) that you’re there, and achieve 
badges of honor for frequent check-ins. 
A Talk feature lets you have threaded 
discussions with those nearby. 
Having a Yelp account and logging into 
the app gives you access to those fea-
tures, but also lets you bookmark loca-
tions and retrieve business links you’ve 
noted. Yelp thrives on reviews, but you 
can only add “quick tips” via the app; 
reviews can be drafted in the app, but 
must be posted via Yelp.com.
The best and strangest option in Yelp is 
its Monocle mode, found in the Nearby 
tab’s upper-right corner. Monocle puts 
labels on top of a live video display. This 
gives you a special Y-ray vision: reviews 
and other details ﬂoat in virtual space 
as you move around. It’s not perfect, but 
it’s a combination of wayﬁnder and deci-
sion aid.

your location and then ﬁnd restaurants 
near you with tables available that night. 
You can also enter a location and search 
by name. Reserving through OpenTable 
earns points redeemable at any restau-
rant that’s part of the network.
OpenTable works best when you know 
what you want, but not how to get it.
Instead of calling around to a number of 
restaurants to see if you can get a table 
at the time you want, why not consult an 
app that can simply reveal what’s avail-
able near you and when—and book the 
table, to boot. OpenTable’s Web site has 
offered that service for years; the app 
provides a comparable experience.
OpenTable doesn’t include all restau-
rants; only those that use its popular 
reservation system are part of the net-
work. However, that includes many res-
taurants in major metropolitan areas. 
It’s why you likely want Urbanspoon (p. 
124), which links into the Rez system, 
installed on your device as well.
Most restaurants feature a menu (as an 
embedded Web page), reviews from reg-
istered OpenTable diners, and parking 
information.

ing. You can give it permission to use

Where to eat? Spin the wheel
With so many restaurants to choose 
from, perhaps spinning a wheel is the 
best choice when you don’t know where 
to eat. Urbanspoon’s wheel spinner 
spawned a lot of competitors, but its app 
started the trend. 
Three wheels in the Shake tab show 
nearby neighborhoods, cuisine types, 
and price ranges. Shake your device 
around (but hold on tight) or tap 
the Shake button. The wheels spin, 
and where they land, there’s your 
destination.
You can set a lock on one or more of the 
wheels to limit choices. Say you want 
cheap Vietnamese food or an expen-
sive restaurant in the neighborhood 
you’re currently standing in. I once used 
the app to ﬁnd a hot dog restaurant to 
reward one of my children when I was in 
an unfamiliar neighborhood. (Schultzy’s 
in the U District for the win!)
The Rez button, when locked, brings up 
only restaurants that have reservations 
available through the Rez system for 
that evening. (A competing system is 
used by OpenTable, p. 123; you may want 
both apps installed for that reason.)
Tap the resulting restaurant, or use any 
of the other tabs to ﬁnd eating establish-
ments, and the details for that location 
appear. Each restaurant’s page shows a 
host of details, such as links (to a map, 
menu, and restaurant Web site), photos 
uploaded by patrons, a phone number, 
and a list of available reservation times 
for restaurants tied into Rez.
One of the consistently most useful 
items is the percentage, which shows 
the portion of all people who tapped the 
I Like It button rather than I Don’t. The 
total votes are shown, too. This simple 
number corresponds quite well with the 
experiences I’ve had when visiting res-
taurants found through the app. 
RESTAURANTS ///

/// DINING

Beyond the percentage, there are 
also more detailed reviews from print 
media and online critics, as well as 
blog entries referring to the eatery and 
reviews left on Urbanspoon’s Web site or 
via this app.
Friends also ﬁgure into this app. Tie in 
your Facebook account to share recom-
mendations and see what your friends 
say about their dining decisions.
The Nearby map shows restaurants 
ordered by distance from where you’re 
standing, although you can ﬁlter by cui-
sine and sort by name and ranking.
Tap the Scope button while holding 
your device more or less parallel to the 
ground, and a map appears centered on 
your current location with pins repre-
senting nearby restaurants. 
Hold up your device, and iOS switches to 
video. After a moment, you see your sur-
roundings overlaid by circles of varying 
diameters that are physically laid out in 
the direction of restaurants around you; 
the bigger the circle, the greater per-
centage of “I Like It” votes. You can pan 
your device to see more, or tap a circle

Capture snippets, longer text, images, and more, with access from everywhere
Evernote is a way to capture whatever 
you’re trying to keep track of without 
having to ﬁgure out how. When you use 
the ﬁrm’s desktop software for Mac OS 
X or Windows, you can enter notes, snip 
sections of the screen, and grab Web 
pages.
But Evernote is equally useful in iOS; its 
software is also available for all other 
major U.S. smartphone platforms (no 
Nokia Symbian support, in other words). 
The iOS app version lets you create text 
notes, annotate a photo, pull a picture 
from your camera roll, or make a voice 
memo.
Whenever you create any item in 
Evernote on your iOS device, it builds in 
the coordinates of your location (with 
your permission). This allows notes to 
be placed on a map for ﬁnding later. 
In fact, one tip that’s provided with 
the app is to use Evernote as a way 
to remember where you parked your 
car. Snap a picture with your iPhone’s 
camera, and then save that as a note.

Stick a pin in it, virtually speaking
Corkulous simulates a large square 
cork board where you can pin photos, 
notes, to-do items, and tags. The idea 
is to provide the same kind of freeform 
organization a real cork board affords 
for brainstorming and moving items 
around, without the requirement to snip 
out and scrawl on pieces of paper. Best 
of all, you never run out of push pins.
The app provides a blessedly small 
number of choices: tap a ﬁle cabinet 
at the bottom of the screen, and you 
can add labels, sticky notes (which 
can be resized), to-do items that 
can be checked, contacts from your 
address book, and photos. In an Alice 
in Wonderland feel, you can also add 
tiny cork boards. Tap a cork board, and 
you’re nested down a level into a fresh 
board. You can also create new boards 
at the top level of the app: either blank 
or from templates stored within it.
You tap an item to move it, and guides 
appear that help you line up edges with 
existing items on the board. Don’t try 
to be too neat, however; this is just a 
simulation. 
Double tap an item and you can edit its 
contents. For several kinds of notes 
you may change the typeface (from four 
informal faces) and increase type size 
via a slider. Double-tap a contact, and 
you can send him or her email, or switch 
to Safari to visit a Web site. (The full 
contact details are shown.)
Corkboards can be exported in multiple 
ways: via email; to the Photo Library; or 
using iTunes File Sharing (see p. xv) as a 
PDF ﬁle, image, or a special interchange 
format. Files in that format can be used 
with the app on other devices. When 
exporting to iTunes, you can choose 
to export the entire board, the current 
viewed area, or a selection you make by 
dragging a rectangle.

Create a visually connected presentation all with your ﬁngers
OmniGrafﬂe for iPad is a way to create 
freeform and structured drawings that 
represent a ﬂow of ideas. The program 
goes far beyond copying OmniGrafﬂe 
for Mac OS X, although you can edit ﬁles 
in either program no matter which app 
created them.
The app instead is tailored for touch-
based sketching and connection. You 
use OmniGrafﬂe to create a ﬂowchart, 
sketch out a sequence of ideas, or mock 
up what you want on a Web page. It’s a 
blank sheet with formatting.
Create a new document, and tap the 
pencil icon at the upper right. The inter-
face switches from green to brown, 
and tools appear for creating shapes or 
drawing.
Hold down on the square and you can 
draw a rectangle, ellipse, and other 
shapes. Tap the line-in-a-circle, and you 
can draw open lines, or enclose a space 
and it ﬁlls with color. 
OmniGrafﬂe is a star at connecting 
ideas, and the connection tool, when 
selected, lets you draw a smart arrow 
from one shape to another. Move either 
shape and the connection persists; the 
arrow changes its direction as needed.
Switch back to the editing mode, and you 
can tap objects to resize them, insert 
text inside objects or on lines, and move 
connections. You can also add objects 
from a large library of stencils—prefab 
objects of all kinds. This library can be 
extended using desktop OmniGrafﬂe 
stencils imported into the app.
Every element can be individually 
selected in a layers/objects menu. That 
menu also allows the creation and con-
trol of layers.
Documents can be imported and 
exported through iTunes File Sharing. 
You can also email ﬁles in their native 
formats, or as PDFs or PNG images. 
Dropbox support would help this excel-
lent app at managing ﬁles.

Organize your thoughts as a series of nodes of a tree, and turn them into to-do lists
Most of us can’t claim to think perfectly 
in sequence. We have jumbles of ideas 
that we’re trying to sort out. Mind map-
ping is one technique to take related 
ideas and link them together as “leaves 
of a tree.” You start with a top node 
that represents a main concept, and 
“leaf out” with limbs of a tree extending 
out further and further as you develop 
ideas.
MindNode takes this concept to all iOS 
devices, letting you create maps with 
tap-and-type simplicity. Tap a main node 
and then tap a + to add a new subsidiary 
branch. Tap to select and then drag any 
node to move it (and its subsidiaries) to

SimpleNote 
FREE* ǩSimperium ǩhttp://5str.us/884
Take and sync notes wherever, archiving previous versions and sharing them
SimpleNote’s nature is encoded in its 
name. The app and a complementary 
free Web site let you create notes. Notes 
sync between the app and the Web site 
(via a free or premium account) with no 
effort—I watched notes created on the 
Web site appear on in the app seconds 
later and vice-versa. 
Notes can have tags assigned for ﬁlter-
ing, and be pinned to keep them at the 
top of the list after you create newer 
items. Notes can be published with a 
link you share via the maker’s Web site, 
shared with other SimpleNote users, or 
emailed.
While composing or editing notes, you 
can tap the i button at the upper right to 
see the word and character count.  
The service stores previous versions of 
notes (up to 10 for free accounts, 30 for 
premium). Tap the clock icon and you 
can slide back and forth through version 
history. Tap Restore to bring back the 
older version.
The premium option, an in-app upgrade, 
adds an RSS feed, removes ads, and 
allows unlimited use of third-party pro-
grams that rely on SimpleNote storage.

Outliner 
$4.99 ǩCarbonFin ǩhttp://5str.us/dtq
Structured way to create outlines and to-do lists
I was taught how to outline in the 6th 
grade, and recall being amazed: this 
is how someone could write a book, I 
exclaimed. (Warning: no outline was 
harmed in the creation of this book.) 
Outliner from CarbonFin is a solid effort 
to help you take a mishmash of ideas or 
tasks and put them into order.
The app lets you create as many items 
as you need, nested underneath one 
another in any fashion you like. It’s a 
simple matter to tap a reorder icon 
(shown as two double-headed crossed 
arrows) and then drag it where you 
will. The program is clever enough to 
provide the right level of nesting as you 
move around among other items in your 
outline. 
To promote or demote an item at one 
level, select the item, and then tap a 
promote or demote button (left and right 
arrows) to change how deeply in the 
hierarchy the entry is located.
Each item has a headline and an optional 
note, and that note can be quite long. It’s 
the ﬂexibility to write at length that lets 
Outliner transcend being just a list of 
bullet points.
Each item can be identiﬁed as a task or 
not. If a task, the entry has a checkbox. 
For elements that have entries hierar-
chically nested beneath them, a prog-
ress pie chart appears and shows how 
many tasks within have been completed.
A free, optional account allows syncing 
among multiple machines, as well as 
access from the Web site. (One missing 
piece: in the version tested at this writ-
ing, you can’t reset the account on the 
app without reinstalling the software.) 
The Web site also lets you share outlines 
with other people through a published 
URL.
You can email your outlines (as text or 
in the OPML outline format) or access 
them from the Web site.

Can’t remember that actress’ name or every movie she appeared in?
The Internet Movie Database (IMDB) 
dates back to the early days of the 
widespread Internet; it just celebrated 
its 20th anniversary as I ﬁnished this 
book. Its goal then, as now, was to col-
lect every fact about movies, ranging 
from cast and crew to obscure trivia. 
Television was later added into the mix. 
The app brings nearly the whole system 
to the mobile screen.
You can search on any term in IMDB 
from the app’s main page, or use 
Movies, TV, and People buttons to fol-
low links like top-grossing movies, the 
nightly television broadcast schedule by 
show, or actors with a birthday on the 
day you’re checking. You can even get a 
summary—spoilers!—about shows you 
missed the previous few days.
Movie and TV show detail pages are 
a summary of the full site’s informa-
tion, showing cast and crew, and 
votes and reviews (both critics and 
user-submitted). An actor’s page shows 
the movies and TV shows he or she is 
best known for, with a tap to see the full 
ﬁlmography. 
Each production and person page also 
has a link at the bottom to open the full 
IMDB.com Web page within the app.
If you let the app know your location, you 
can view movie showtimes at theaters 
near you, too.

Bing is Microsoft’s answer to Google 
Search, and it’s a pretty good one. Bing’s 
results on the Web are often more ger-
mane, better ﬁltered, and better orga-
nized. While you can use the Settings > 
Safari > Search Engine option to switch 
your Mobile Safari browser from Google 
to either Bing or Yahoo! for search-
ing, the Bing app has a lot to offer as a 
standalone look into search results.
Enter a search term into the main ﬁeld 
in the app, and results for maps, Web 
pages, images, and news appear. Links 
from all four categories (plus sugges-
tions for other searches at the bottom) 
can be viewed in the app. 
The image view is particularly good. It 
shows a screen of thumbnails match-
ing the result. As you swipe downward, 
new thumbnails are loaded row by row 
endlessly (or until there are no more 
matches). Tap for a preview, and tap Full 
Screen for a higher-resolution preview.
The Bing app has evolved, however, 
from a simple search replacement to 
an attempt at encapsulating everything 
you might want to do on the Web or in 
another app. You can ﬁnd travel deals, 
movie times, connect to Facebook 
and Twitter, shop, and get the news 
and weather. It’s ambitious, but well-
presented, and you can simply ignore 
the parts you don’t need.
However, don’t miss the Camera mode 
on the app’s home page (swipe left on 
the list of links at the bottom to ﬁnd the 
Camera label). Tap Camera, and Bing 
automatically scans media or other bar 
codes to bring up matching items; or tap 
when a book or album cover is centered, 
and have Bing ﬁnd an item match and

Delivery Status 
$4.99 ǩJunecloud ǩhttp://5str.us/lda
Track packages’ delivery status
The Internet was supposed to cut down 
on the amount of physical stuff we dealt 
with. Yeah, right. Like many people, I 
have packages in transit all the time 
from Amazon and other e-tailers, 
returns heading back, and repairs 
somewhere in between.
Keeping track of such items requires 
visiting many different Web sites. 
Delivery Status puts your purchases and 
shipments all in one location. The app 
connects to a few dozen postal services, 
delivery companies, and online shops 
(Adobe, Amazon, Apple, and Google 
Checkout) to pull down the latest loca-
tion of a package or envelope.
With online stores, you can plug in your 
username and password along with the 
appropriate order number, and the app 
pulls in details for you. For shippers, you 
enter a tracking number, and the pro-
gram consults the delivery ﬁrm’s Web 
site directly.
The current location of an item can be 
shown on a map, although that’s a little 
bit of eye candy: if I have an Apple prod-
uct that’s in Shengzhen, China, it doesn’t 
help me much to see it on a map. Tap 
View Details Online and an inset Web 
window of a package’s progress is 
pulled from the postal or other service.
Delivery Status works with an optional 
free account for synchronizing your 
package information across devices and 
the Web site. There’s a free Mac OS X 
widget that can also tie into this synced 
delivery data.

Flixster is a one-stop ﬁlm machine,

Each movie has—where available—trail-

My favorite use of Flixster is to ﬁnd

WolframAlpha

Informational queries at your ﬁngertips, no matter how obscure
If you ask WolframAlpha, ”What’s the 
meaning of life,” it tells you the correct 
answer: 42. The company must have a 
fan of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
More seriously, however, you can throw 
a remarkable variety of questions at the 
system, and get structured responses.
WolframAlpha processes questions 
or fragments you ask, and tries to ﬁnd 
data sources that match, including 
comparisons. If you type in ”Seattle 
vs. Bellingham,” the system provides 
square miles, population, unemploy-
ment, and the distance between two 
points. Enter “gold vs. silver,” and the 
periodic table appears plus much more.
For math, the app shines, which is no 
surprise given that Wolfram is the lead-
ing creator of graphical mathematical 
equation software. You can punch in any 
equation, and have the solution neatly 
presented.
This includes such minor esoterica as 
asking for X digits of π or e, but also 
deep differential equations.
While WolframAlpha is free to use at 
the Web site, the format isn’t quite as 
compact as the app, which allows you to 
read results in an easy-to-scan fashion; 
forward answers via email, Twitter, and 
other methods; and run through tutori-
als for using the system.

QuickMark 4 
$0.99 ǩSimpleAct ǩhttp://5str.us/ye7
Snap bar codes and 2D tags and turn them into URLs or text
Have you seen those squares full of 
dots that look like they’re supposed to 
mean something? And have you seen 
more of them lately? Those are 2D (two-
dimensional) bar codes or tags, and 
are increasingly attached to restaurant 
doors, products, and kiosks. They’ve 
even started to show up in ads on cable 
television!
QuickMark 4 can read these codes and 
convert their information into text, which 
is often a URL. You can jump to the URL 
or store it for later. The app can also 
decipher codes that contain plain text, a 
phone number, or other information.
The app supports the two most popular 
kinds of 2D tags: QR Codes and Data 
Matrix. The program can also scan and 
read most 1D barcodes, including those 
used on books and on retail products. 
The app can share information, too, 
using Bluetooth to send decoded tags to 
another device running the same app, or 
via Wi-Fi to a Mac on the same network 
using a simple piece of free software 
provided by the developers.
QuickMark 4 can also generate QR 
Codes from information you provide, 
including one of your contact, a URL, 
or other information that you enter. In a 
bit of the snake eating its own tail, you 
can create a code from a code you just 
scanned for sharing.
BAR CODES ///

For books, the app matches (using loca-
tion with your permission) holdings 
in nearby libraries. You can even tap 
through to the library page for the item.
A bar code is a portal into a wealth of 
information, but it’s often tedious to get 
from the pattern or numbers associated 
with it to results. RedLaser automates 
that process with a single tap required 
to get started.
Find any consumer item with a barcode, 
whether it be a book, a can of chowder, 
or a piece of software. Tap the lightning 
bolt icon and hold the camera lens over 
the barcode. Onscreen alignment bars 
help you orient the code; the bars light 
up green when they are over the right 
place. The app works even with the 1st-
generation iPhone. 
After it extracts the numbers, RedLaser 
searches Google and other sites for 
results. The results are divided by site, 
and include links for purchase. eBay 
bought this app from its original devel-
opers, and naturally eBay and Half.com 
links appear—though neither at the top

because you have to tap through, but it 
provides larger photos, and may appeal 
to people who want to ﬂip back and forth 
more readily.
You can’t underestimate the importance 
of knots, which used to be taught to 
every child in scouting, on a farm, and at 
school. Knots now seem old fashioned 
despite their everyday utility in the home

Animated Knots is a terriﬁc way for 
those with little knot-tying experience to

useful in more than one place.)
Better yet, Animated Knots animates

All the news ﬁts; no print
If you like to read the best newspaper in 
the world, there’s no better place than 
the NYTimes app. The company hasn’t 
made its Web site well suited for mobile 
browsing, but the app provides ready 
access to top stories and makes it easy 
to drill down for more.
The approach is simple: four section 
tabs along the bottom and a More button 
to reach the rest of the virtual paper. 
Tap a tab like Latest, and the news ﬁlls 
the screen as a series of horizontal 
items with blurbs. Tabs reload with any 
newer items; you can tap the reload 
button in the upper right to force this 
behavior if you think the section is out 
of date.
Tap a story, and you’re in an article view, 
which often has a photo at the top. Tap 
in the middle of the page to hide the top 
and bottom navigation, which increase 
the readable area and remove interface 
distraction of buttons. The app works 
equally well in portrait and landscape 
orientations for reading and navigation.
The left/right arrows at the upper right 
on a story page let you move among sto-
ries in the section, while an action but-
ton at lower left passes on the story via 
email, text messaging, or Twitter; you 
can also copy the link from the action 
menu. Tap Save, and the article is stored 
on your device. 
The Times would be wise to link in 
directly with Evernote, Instapaper, and 
others to save links and snippets for 
later reading across the Web and your 
various devices. I don’t mind having ads 
inserted, but I’d rather have more ways 
to remember what I wanted to read.
Your position within a story isn’t cap-
tured; if you exit and return, you have to 
navigate back to where you left off. The 
app would be far better if the last-read 
location were noted, as in the Kindle, 
iBooks, and Nook apps for ebooks.

It sometimes seems like more of an 
experiment than real intent, but it’s a 
delight to read in this format. I highly 
suspect that when the Times starts 
charging for news, you’ll see the iPhone/
iPod touch app and this one merge into 
one with far better ﬂexibility.
For now, one of the highlights of the iPad 
app is watching recent videos from the 
Times extensive documentary opera-
tion. This includes shorts by the popular 
David Pogue, a colleague and the Times’ 
tech columnist, as well as video footage 
from all over the world.
The other bright point is reading in long 
form. Feature articles of many thou-
sands of words are easy to read on the 
iPad over several screens; not so with 
the NYTimes app on its littler brethen.
If you don’t like the four default sec-
tions placed at the bottom of the home 
screen, tap More, and then browse 
through all the other departments at the 
paper. Tap Edit and you can drag new 
sections to the bottom to replace the 
ones that are there. 
More also hides the Search and Saved 
Articles links: swipe to the very bottom 
to ﬁnd them. Via Search, you can ﬁnd 
any article at the paper in the last few 
days. When I conﬁgure the app, I tend to 
move Search to the main page.

while you can, as the New York Times

strikes, and outs. In the main view, you

pitches are thrown, the app shows the

Creativity comes bursting out of us at inconvenient 
moments. That’s why it’s useful to have a mobile 
device capable of letting us express ourselves with 
no intermediation. We can draw on the glass or 
tap our words directly in. The apps in this chapter 
provide a direct conduit for our outpourings.

layers and ﬂatten one layer with the 
next via a tap. Photoshop-like combina-
tion effects, like darken and multipy, are 
available. Varying opacity and effects 
can produce remarkable paintings.
If you want to start with a photo, you can 
tap the photos icon in the upper right 
and select a picture from your Photo 
Library. The image can be scaled and 
rotated before being placed on the page.
Brushes even sneaks in an extra fea-
ture beyond just exporting to the photo 
library or sending via email: you can 
turn the app brieﬂy into a network ﬁle 
server to retrieve ﬁles directly from 
a Mac or Windows computer using 
WebDAV (see p. xvi).
Brushes is a hit with artists, who rely 
on the software to create rich, layered 
paintings along with photographic 
manipulations and overlays. You choose 
from a small array of brushes, which 
are actually a repeated object that you 
can add spacing between, to produce a 
solid line, speckles, and other effects.
Transparency controls for color provide 
a ﬁne adjustment. Overdrawing adds 
additional opacity as with watercolors. 
A brush option lets you choose to let 
speed affect the brush width and opac-
ity. Draw more slowly and a thicker, less 
transparent “paint” layer is applied.
Onscreen controls for bringing up edit-
ing tools are well thought out: a double 
tap in one corner performs an undo; a 
double tap in another lets you change 
the weight of the brush or eraser.
The layers control is superb, allowing 
the ability to create, shufﬂe, and preview

can also import photos into layers.
AutoDesk was an unlikely company to 
offer a painting and drawing program, 
but it was among the ﬁrst to do so for 
the iPad. The ﬁrm is best known for 
CAD/CAM software used by architects, 
industrial engineers, and manufactur-
ers. But SketchBook Pro doesn’t suffer 
from an engineering mindset.
Brushes (previous page) makes virtual 
drawing feel more like the real thing, 
but offers fewer brush types and options 
for variations. If you like to work among 
many different kinds of simulated media, 
SketchBook Pro has a leg up.
The app has an array of 75 brushes, 
pens, sprays, and odd stamps like hands 
and vertebrae. A brush preview shows 
you a stripe of the brush as you adjust 
color, radius, and opacity. 
SketchBook Pro provides solid layer 
control with an opacity slider for cre-
ating overlaid drawings. You can set 
how each layer combines with the ones 
below, and reorder layers by dragging.

throughout this book make that point as 
well. Pages for iPad is designed to work

Mac OS X Pages app, part of iWork.
For the most part, it succeeds after an 
awkward start. The version of Pages 
reviewed for this book was robust 
enough to allow two-way ﬁle transfers 
and create serious documents.
Pages creates both documents and page 
layouts while blurring the line between 
them. You start with a template that 
already has elements in place for a 
given task, like composing a letter on 
letterhead or creating a ﬂyer. The Blank 
template is available, too, for starting

Edit text ﬁles directly from Dropbox
This app tries to be just about the sim-
plest word processor you could use on 
an iOS device. It’s all about the writing.
Files are stored on the hardware only 
temporarily; Dropbox, an Internet-
hosted ﬁle service, acts as the hard 
drive (see p. 171 for more on Dropbox).
You can choose among iOS fonts and 
set the type size, font color, and back-
ground, and that’s nearly all you have 
access to or need. Elements supports 
TextExpander macros (p. 186) for 
quicker entry as well.

Plain Text has even fewer settings than 
Elements. It also taps into Dropbox,

However, Plain Text can work with any 
Dropbox folder chosen when you enter 
your Dropbox account details. Dropbox 
isn’t required, as the app also allows 
ﬁles to be copied in and out via iTunes 
Sharing using USB (see p. xv). 
Plain Text lets you set when changes 
are synced with Dropbox. The default

when the app is launched or exited, 
when you make an edit, and when you 
open a ﬁle or folder.

The Elements 
$13.99 ǩTheodore Gray ǩhttp://5str.us/4p9
There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminum, selenium...and over a hundred more
Science geeks love the periodic table of 
the elements. Some even carry around a 
wallet-sized card in case there’s a sud-
den need to know the atomic weight of 
molybdenum (it’s 42).
What better way to demonstrate the 
range, depth, and capriciousness of the 
universe in which we live? The periodic 
table divides indivisible building blocks 
of existence (let’s ignore quarks and 
gluons for a moment) by how many 
electrons are required to ﬁll a shell, and 
orders them by the number of protons in 
the nucleus (from least to greatest).
Theodore Gray, one of math software 
developer Wolfram Research’s founders, 
has spent an enormous amount of time, 
money, and effort collecting examples of 
every element that’s extant, and docu-
menting them. (Some elements are cre-
ated under high-energy conditions and 
have miniscule lifetimes before breaking 
down. These are obviously a bit hard to 
picture.)
He’s produced books, a Web site, and 
now a glorious app, one of the ﬁrst avail-
able for the iPad when it was released. 
The app shows the periodic table with 
photography, information, and links to 
Wolfram Alpha (see p. 140) for additional 
data lookups.
As a teaching and learning tool, The 
Elements is marvelous, bringing dry 
mechanical facts into sharp color and 
live interaction. 
For each element, you can see a large 
sample—as found in nature or manufac-
tured into a product—of an item contain-
ing the element. That example can be 
swiped and tapped to spin and rotate in 
three dimensions around a single axis. 
The main page reveals a host of infor-
mation at a glance: the position of the 
element on a schematic color-coded 
periodic table at top; the atomic radius 
and organization of electrons in shells;

side-by-side set which can be used with 
stereographic glasses. (Mr. Gray offers 
an inexpensive pair through his site for 
about $8 with shipping within the U.S.)
The app has stolen my heart because 
it opens with a song: 1950s–60s comic 
singer (and Harvard mathematician) Tom 
Lehrer’s ”The Elements,” a rendition 
of all elements known in 1959, sung to 
the tune of a Gilbert and Sullivan song. 
The song is animated with each element 
appearing as Mr. Lehrer sings it.
For young scientists and those young at 
heart, hours can be whiled away exam-
ining the little things that make us up.
the crystal structure (also in rotating 
3D), with a description; and a number 
of statistics to deﬁne the element in 
relationship to the rest of the universe. 
A set of colored lines across the right 
side from top to bottom represent the 
atomic emissions spectrum—the wave-
lengths emitted when an element is 
superheated.
On the detail page for the element, there 
are typically several other examples 
throughout well-written text; each 
of those images may also be rotated.

Star Walk 
$4.99 ǩVito Technology ǩhttp://5str.us/v7v
Take a magic window into the stars with you while you gaze
When sitting outside on a crisp, clear 
night, did you ever wish constellations 
and stars had labels? Star Walk ﬁlls 
that desire for folks like me who know a 
smattering of stars, but can only reliably 
ﬁnd a few. 
The app uses GPS and other positioning 
sensors to provide something like ”aug-
mented reality,” where the world around 
you is annotated with details. (Automatic 
positioning requires a compass sensor, 
which is built into all iPads.)
Hold an iPad up to the sky outside, and 
it’s like you have a true magic window. 
Constellations fade in automatically 
when you pause over a view. Tap any 
star, galaxy, or other feature, and you 
can then tap an information button to 
see a close-up with more detail.
Star Walk also has a remarkable 
fast-forward/rewind mode for moving 
through time as well as space. Tap part 
of the date, like the year, spin the dial by 
ﬂicking up or down, and watch the stars 
move as if you were in an Einsteinian 
inertial frame of reference traveling at 
a fraction below the speed of light. You 
can also move in small increments.
A “local neighborhood” view shows you 
various details about the current phases 
of the moon, when planets appear in the 
sky, and sunrise and sunset.

Solar Walk presents the eight planets 
(sorry, Pluto) in all their glory as they 
revolve around each other, and collec-
tively around the sun. 
The orbits are shown as lines, while the 
planets are outsized in relation to each 
other for better visibility in many views. 
A planet can be rotated by tapping it to 
bring it into full view, and then dragging. 
Tap a planet or any of the major moons 
orbiting Mars and beyond, and then tap 
an i icon, and a variety of detail about the 
heavenly body is shown. This includes 
its measurements to the composition of 
planetary layers to the probe missions 
that visited it. 
A rocket ship button lets you zoom in on 
a planet or moon after tapping it. You 
can rotate the orbs you’re viewing, too, 
to see the current light and dark sides. 
Pinch, zooming, swiping, and dragging 
let you “walk” around the solar system.
As with Star Walk, you can tap a chro-
nometer at the upper right, and use a 
dial to zoom through time while watch-
ing the planets move in relation to one 
another. This can aid in ﬁnding align-
ments or ﬁguring out when a planet will 
be visible in the night sky.

Planets 
FREE ǩQ Continuum ǩhttp://5str.us/hfb
An extraordinary amount of planetary data packed into a free app
The planets whirl around the Earth, and 
ﬁnding their current position can take 
an almanac, a Web site, or a trained eye. 
The Planets app helps you spot the other 
seven spheres through a few different 
aids, as well as view information about 
constellations, the sun, and Earth’s 
moon. (Pluto is dissed in this app as in 
Solar Walk, p. 163.)
Views of planets are divided into several 
tabs. The Visibility tab is the real gem, 
displaying all the planets, the moon, and 
the sun, with their rise and set times, 
and whether they are visible to the 
unaided eye or not. A red vertical marks 
the current time.
 A Sky 2D tab shows the current position 
of the planets and sun in a plane; during 
the day, only the sun is shown. A Sky 3D 
tab can be oriented around your view of 
the horizon, and shows constellations, 
too. You can drag to pan and pinch, and 
expand to see more or focus in.
If you’re exceptionally geeky, a slider 
of labels at the top lets you see the sky 
via X-ray, infrared, radio, hydrogen, and 
microwave telescope data.
The Globes tab adds 3D, rotating low-
resolution versions of the moon and 
eight planets, with an option to set them 
spinning, or pinch to zoom in.

details—the Voyager 1 and 2 probes are 
still going, billions of miles away—or 
hop to the present and see yesterday’s

can tap a ﬁlter button to restrict mis-
sions to speciﬁc areas of study, like the 
moon and Mars. Tabs for images, videos,

Get detailed weather maps, forecasts, and webcam views
WeatherBug relies on tens of thousands 
of weather stations it’s placed around 
the country to provide local weather 
reports and forecasts. These stations 
also let you see the current weather 
conditions through a webcam picture 
and an animation of several pictures 
from the last few hours. (Yes, it’s not so 
useful at night, and a surprising number 
of cameras point at parking lots.)
The app is well designed in both of its 
separate iPhone/iPod touch and iPad 
versions, providing ready access to local 
weather station results, forecasts from 
the National Weather Service, and short 
videos updating current local conditions.
Although you can use WeatherBug solely 
to look up weather on demand, the app 
is most useful when you add locations. 
You can enter a city, state, or zip, and 
then add to a list you can swipe through.
For a given location, you can see cur-
rent conditions, a forecast (by hour or 
for the next seven days), and view maps 
with selectable overlays of temperature, 
radar, and other conditions. You can 
also view a current video report on U.S. 
weather shot like a television weather 
segment.
WeatherBug’s iPad version put all this 
information at a glance; the edition for 
the smaller screen requires a few taps.

Because The Weather Channel produces 
massive amounts of reports every day,

a desktop volume or use WebDAV soft-
ware to access it from any platform. 
The free MobileMe iDisk app provides 
easy access to those ﬁles from an 
iOS device. After logging in with your 
MobileMe user name and password, the 
iDisk ﬁle list lets you navigate among 
folders and select ﬁles to view. (The 
list is the main view on an iPhone/iPod

with an optional expiration date and 
password. Tap the Shared Files icon at 
any time to see what’s shared, make an

The Dropbox app is free, and you can 
use Dropbox to store up to 2 GB of data 
at no cost. You must create an account 
at the Dropbox.com site or via the app 
before you can use the program.
Dropbox also works as the back-end 
storage for many other apps, which can
upload and edit ﬁles stored there. The 
company offers a list of these at https://
www.dropbox.com/apps/list.
Dropbox has become a religion among 
some of us who manage many machines 
and who work with folks all over the 
world. The service synchronizes the 
contents of a folder on your desktop 
(Mac OS X and Windows), and can handle 
any number of nested folders. After you 
make a change to a ﬁle on one computer, 
the changed portions are silently and 
immediately sent to all other machines 
with which you sync. Folders can be 
shared with colleagues, too, making it a 
great tool for project collaboration.
The Dropbox app gives you access to 
your folders and ﬁles stored centrally 
by Dropbox on its servers. You can view, 
but not change or delete, ﬁles and fold-

however, you can create folders and 
upload images and video. Like most 
iOS apps, Dropbox can display any text, 
page-layout, image, or video format that

Stellar app for no-fuss remote computer access
LogMeIn Ignition is part of a family of 
remote-access and screen-sharing pro-
grams from company (named LogMeIn). 
Ignition makes your iOS device a window 
that peers into the screen of a desktop 
system on the same network or else-
where on the Internet. The app lets you 
control the mouse and keyboard, as well 
as pinch, pan, and expand to view the 
remote screen. 
You ﬁrst set up one or more computers 
from the company’s Web site by creating 
an account and downloading software to 
install. LogMeIn supports both Mac OS X 
and Windows. Each computer shows up 
as a named entry in a list on the site; the 
same appears in the app after you log in.
Tap on a computer in the list in the 
app, and LogMeIn creates a securely 
encrypted connection between the iOS 
device and the computer. You can move 
the mouse around, click, and type. A row 
of special icons below the screen display 
lets you switch between left and right 
mouse clicks and type special keys.
Although you can store your LogMeIn 
account password in Ignition, you may 
want to avoid this in case your device 
is stolen. Otherwise, a thief could gain 
access to your computers remotely!

special function keys. Shake your device 
to swap between monitors if the remote

you see within the frame of your device. 
The company doesn’t charge for this 
app, but that’s only when you’re engaged 
in what TeamViewer calls noncommer-
cial use; it relies on the honor system 
for enforcement. Corporate licenses are 
quite expensive, but are priced for each 
active user’s desktop, with no limits on 
many kinds of remote access.
The TeamViewer app works with desk-
top software for Mac OS X, Windows, 
and other platforms to provide remote 
access to a desktop. The desktop 
TeamViewer works as both a server and 
for remote access; the app is for remote 
access only.
You can install TeamViewer on a com-
puter with essentially no conﬁguration, 
which makes it different from LogMeIn 
Ignition (p. 172), which requires an 
account ﬁrst. TeamViewer lets you set 
up an account to create the equivalent of 
buddy lists (it calls buddies “partners”).
With TeamViewer active on at least one 
computer—with or without an account 
set up—you can hook in remotely.
Launch the app and you can start a ses-

tab, enter a code number and ﬁxed 
password set on the desktop software. 
Or you can use the Partner List, where 
you log into a TeamViewer account and 
can see and connect to machines that 
are part of your partner network. Your 
partner list includes computers you’ve 
added to your own account.

$24.99 ǩiTeleport ǩhttp://5str.us/rd8
Access a computer remotely using standard VNC for screen sharing and data entry
iTeleport provides access to the com-
monly used VNC (virtual network com-
puter) standard for remote screen, 
keyboard, and mouse access. VNC 
software is built into Mac OS X, and can 
be obtained at no cost or in commercial 
versions for nearly any computer oper-
ating system even in narrow use. That 
includes Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, 
Unix, and far more.
iTeleport takes an elegant and easy 
approach to making a connection. When 
an iOS device is on the same network as 
computers that use Bonjour (a mostly 
Apple protocol) to show their availabil-
ity, the app lists them in the connection 
view. Other local and remote computers’ 
settings can be entered manually. 
iTeleport includes the critical option to 
layer encryption over its screen-sharing 
sessions, because VNC lacks this kind 
of built-in support. (iTeleport uses 
SSH, which is also available on nearly 
every platform, to create an encryption, 
essentially an unbreakable wrapper 
around your connection.)
The touchscreen on an iOS device con-
trols the cursor on the remote machine. 
Standard pinch and expand gestures 
make the image of the remote screen 
smaller or larger, which is especially 
useful with multiple monitors. (When 
using Apple’s Screen Sharing software, 
more than one monitor can be shared; 
with standard VNC, only the screen with 
the menu bar in Mac OS X can be used.)
Tap in a text ﬁeld that you’re viewing 
remotely, and then tap the keyboard icon 
in the iTeleport overlay. Now you can 
type just as if you were in front of the 
machine.
The company behind the app, also called 
iTeleport, offers free Mac OS X and 
Windows software to enable remote 
access. iTeleport has a central registra-
tion system to aid connecting to comput-
ers behind ﬁrewalls or home gateways 
that otherwise prevent direct access. 
A Gmail account is used as “connective 
tissue” behind the scenes.

Remote 
FREE ǩApple ǩhttp://5str.us/qc5
Makes your mobile device into a remote control for iTunes
enter the code from the iOS screen. The 
devices are now paired. You can pair 
with multiple libraries, but only use one 
at a time.
Remote can now control playback of 
everything in iTunes. Items are orga-
nized much like in the iPod app with-
categories at the bottom. Tap the More 
button, and tap Edit to change any of 
the four buttons that appear in the main 
screen. It’s useful to promote the Search 
bottom to that bottom icon bar.
You can control the playback of audio 
and video from the app, even choosing 
the volume levels of audio coming out 
of AirPlay-connected devices (Apple TV 
and AirPort Express). 
Leaving Remote set to remain connected 
in the background consumes more 
power than letting it disconnect, but it 
means that your library is always avail-
able whenever you wake the device from 
sleep; otherwise, it has to reconnect. 
Remote turns iTunes into an audiovisual 
engine instead of a program you have 
to operate from a computer. In place of 
using a keyboard, mouse, and monitor 
to navigate the program, this stylish and 
free app lets you search, choose play-
lists, and control playback. (It doesn’t 
stream music to your iOS device.)
First, you pair Remote with iTunes. 
Launch Remote on your iOS device. Tap 
Settings, and you can tap Add Library. 
This brings up a screen showing a pass-
code that needs to be entered in a copy 
of iTunes on the same Wi-Fi network.
On the computer you want to pair with

AirMouse Pro 
$1.99 ǩRPA Tech ǩhttp://5str.us/bz4
Have a virtual mouse and keyboard for a computer that has a monitor
In my home, we have a Mac mini act as 
our video streaming, DVD, and music 
hub. It’s plugged into an HDTV set, and 
sits on the top of our television cabinet 
in the back corner. While we can grab a 
keyboard and mouse and plug them in to 
control the mini, that’s a hassle.
Instead, we turn to AirMouse Pro, an 
app that turns an iOS device into a com-
bination of a touch-based trackpad and 
virtual keyboard.
You ﬁrst install free remote access 
software from RPA Tech on any Mac or 
Windows system you want to access. 
The server can be password protected. 
Next, you launch the app and ﬁnd the 
computer you want to control that’s con-
nected to the same local network.
Once connected, the app turns into 
a keyboard and trackpad. The track-
pad ﬁlls half the screen in portrait 
mode. Shake the device or rotate it to 
landscape, and the trackpad ﬁlls the 
whole screen. Buttons below the track-
pad work as expected for left and right 
equivalents. Multitouch gestures, like 
two ﬁngers for scrolling, work ﬁne.
The app also includes advanced features 
that let you use it more like a remote 
control for iTunes and other programs.

VLC Remote 
$4.99 ǩHobbyist Software ǩ
http://5str.us/49h
A nice control for those who rely on VLC
VLC is the universal video format player: 
free, easy to use, and open source. 
However, it’s designed to run on a com-
puter. If you’re using that computer to 
put video onto a monitor or TV set to 
watch from a distance, it can be frus-
trating to manage playback.
VLC Remote pairs with VLC software 
using a bit of separately installed 
Windows or Mac software. The app lets 
you start, stop, and pick a playback spot, 
adjust volume, and manage video play-
lists. The app also sports controls for 
remotely playing DVDs on a computer.
The software lets you browse the com-
puter’s hard drive to pick ﬁles to play 
back. For dedicated VLC users, the app 
is a good counterpart.

Off Remote is a switch for remotely 
changing the active status of a Mac OS 
X or Windows system; some simple 
software needs to be installed on the 
desktop server.
With Off Remote, you can be at the other 
end of the house and turn off a com-
puter. Or restart it, put it to sleep, lock 
it, or log out of the active acount. The 
commands can also be set to occur after 
a chosen period of time.

An iOS device is a Swiss army knife with a 
1,000 empty slots ready for new tools. 
This chapter looks at apps that are useful for 
shopping, calculating, ﬁnding, waking, remembering, 
connecting, displaying, and more.
Utilities

bring back to Mobile Safari or other pro-
grams for login. You can use 1Password 
independent of the corresponding desk-
top software, but it’s much more difﬁcult 
to capture Web logins for later use.
1Password can sync between desktop 
and iOS versions. A release in mid-2010 
added Dropbox support, so all copies of 
the software write changes to the same 
folder, and automatically pick up new 
changes everywhere. Even if you don’t 
otherwise use Dropbox, you can set up 
a free account (up to 2 GB of storage) to 
take advantage of 1Password syncing. 
(See p. 171 for the Dropbox app review.)
If I pick a good password, one that has a 
mix of letters and numbers and doesn’t 
match words in a dictionary, how will I 
remember it? Better yet, why should I 
invent one in the ﬁrst place?
1Password provides a solution to both 
problems. The app is a complement to 
desktop Mac OS X and Windows soft-
ware ($39.95 for one license, $69.95 for 
ﬁve family members, http://5str.us/
qld). The desktop software creates and 
stores passwords for logging in at a Web 
site. When you return to a Web site, the 
software can (with your permission) ﬁll 
in those details for you.
The iOS app can take that data and open 
a Web browser sheet for Web logins, or 
let you copy and paste a password to

Yojimbo 
$9.99 ǩBare Bones ǩhttp://5str.us/yob
Keep your important bits and pieces close and secure while you roam
The Yojimbo app for Mac OS X is where 
everything I need to remember gets 
stuffed. It’s a grab bag for text notes, 
PDF ﬁles, Web links, archived Web 
pages (downloaded and converted to a 
ﬁxed page stored in the Yojimbo data-
base), serial numbers, and images. In 
fact, it’s harder to ﬁgure out what I don’t 
store in the program than what I do.
Whenever I make an online purchase 
that has a ”printer-friendly” link for the 
invoice or receipt, I print it straight to 
Yojimbo, which provides a PDF menu 
add-on for the print dialog box. If I buy 
an item with a serial number, that num-
ber heads right into the program. Any 
item can be secured, too, by clicking an 
Encrypt button.
The Yojimbo desktop program lets you 
tag items with as many tags as you 
invent. You can then create collections 
that are organized by tag or search ﬁlter.  
Yojimbo can sync its database across 
multiple Mac OS X systems using a 
single paid MobileMe account. But there 
had never been an easy or secure way to 
take that data with you on the go.
This app ﬁlls the gap. It automatically 
syncs with Yojimbo 3.0 whenever the 
program is ﬁred up on the same Wi-Fi 
network. You can also tap a refresh but-
ton in the item browsing tab at any time.
The library, collections, and other data 
come right over to the app for access. 
Encrypted items are unlocked using the 
same password you set in the desktop 
software. (I never store my password for 
Yojimbo in the Mac OS X or iOS keychain, 
as that would defeat the purpose of 
encryption if my machine were accessed 
or stolen while I was logged in.)
Because I’m a dedicated Yojimbo user, 
I’m willing to overlook the missing ability 
in 1.0 to create items and modify tags. 
The utility of having all that informa-
tion I store on my desktop at my mobile 
disposal outweighs (for the moment) the 
lack of controls to modify or add to it.

Dragon Dictation 
FREE ǩNuance Communications ǩhttp://5str.us/f5r
Speak and have the app turn your words into text
Dragon NaturallySpeaking and Dragon 
Dictate are the best speech-recognition 
software ever developed, and they 
constantly improve. However, mobile 
devices don’t have enough process-
ing power to turn audio into text with 
the necessary level of accuracy. That’s 
where this free adjunct app from 
Nuance steps in. It takes what you say 
into a microphone (a headset may be 
better), and transmits the audio to 
Nuance’s servers for conversion.
The quality of conversion is fairly good, 
although corrections are often neces-
sary. This isn’t onerous if the majority of 
what you speak is correctly recognized. 
You can opt to delete entire words, or 
tap the keyboard icon and use full let-
ter-by-letter editing. The app supports 
up to 60 seconds of recording at a time, 
but you can restart dictating indeﬁnitely 
after each minute. Nuance recommends 
recording a few sentences at a time.
The app supports a number of punc-
tuation marks and special characters, 
although these are unfortunately not 
documented in the app itself. (See 
http://5str.us/6fd, and click Features 
and Usage at left.) You can also allow 
the program to upload all your contacts’ 
names, which improves recognition 
for those people when you speak their 
names as part of your dictation.
Once you have your recognized text, you 
can pass it on via a text message, email, 
Facebook, or Twitter, or copy it to for use 
in another app.
Why is this marvelous app free? Nuance 
gets access to an enormous variety of 
spoken words (anonymously captured) 
to improve its expensive desktop soft-
ware, as New York Times columnist 
David Pogue explained at http://nyti.ms/
cweSPn. The app also acts as an ad for 
Nuance’s desktop software.

Amazon Mobile 
FREE ǩAmazon.com ǩhttp://5str.us/kck
A portable portal into the ecommerce giant paired with uncanny photo recognition
Amazon Mobile demonstrates the power 
of mobile devices by providing an easier 
way to ﬁnd, order, and track goods than 
on a full-sized computer’s Web browser. 
The app lets you search, of course, after 
which you can drill down into the results 
to view reviews, editorial descriptions, 
pictures, and other associated informa-
tion for a given item. You can see all 
available product conditions (new and 
used) for books and media.
If you sign in to an existing Amazon.com 
account (or create one), your 1-Click 
purchase settings are available. You can 
also add items to a cart and review the 
contents of that cart by clicking a but-
ton. The app can place the order, too. 
Terriﬁc, right?
But that’s not what makes this app more 
interesting than Amazon’s Web site. The 
Remembers tab is the key; a built-in 
camera is required. Tap the camera icon 
and take a picture of an item you want 
to purchase from Amazon. That could 
be a book cover, a physical object like a 
clock, a toy, or what have you. Tap Use.
The picture is uploaded so you can jog 
your own memory later. But the eerie 
part is the photo is also sent to some 
combination of computer and human 
analysis to ﬁgure out whether there’s a 
matching or close item. 
I snapped a shot of a 30-year-old chil-
dren’s book cover (no bar code), and it 
was matched in a matter of seconds. A 
picture of a large clock hanging on my 
wall was also matched nearly instantly.
The danger with this app is that it makes 
compare prices too easy: you can check 
constantly while on the go—and wind up 
with piles of Amazon boxes waiting on 
your porch.

Find My iPhone 
FREE* ǩApple ǩhttp://5str.us/fcf
Keep track of your iOS device when it’s lost or taken away
Your phone is missing. Or your iPad. And 
you know you had it just a minute ago. 
Or , worse, someone snatches it out of 
your hand. Where can it be? Find My 
iPhone (despite its limiting name) will 
help you track down any iOS device that 
has a current network connection, as 
well as one that connects at some point 
after you ﬁrst attempt to ﬁnd it.
First, the requirements: you need a 
MobileMe account ($100 to $150 per 
year) to enable Find My iPhone. 
Second, the service only works when 
either Push or Fetch (or both) synchro-
nization is turned on (Settings > Mail, 
Contacts, Calendar > Fetch New Data). 
(Push is used to send new data your iOS 
device whenever it’s available; Fetch 
retrieves email and other information on 
a regular schedule.)
Third, you must activate the service for 
each device you own (Settings > Mail, 
Contacts, Calendar > your MobileMe 
account > Find My iPhone). 
Fourth, a device can only report its posi-
tion when it is connected to a network.
That said, the service and this app are 
invaluable. The app lets you quickly see 
the last-known position of the device. 
On Apple mobile gear that has Push 
enabled, Find My iPhone can query for 
the current position. Precision is GPS 
exact for an iPhone or a 3G iPad; less 
accurate Wi-Fi positioning is used for 
the iPod touch and Wi-Fi-only iPad 
model. 
Launch the app and log in to MobileMe, 
and a list of your active devices with the 
service turned on are shown. It can take 
up to a few minutes to retrieve the cur-
rent location of each, even if they’re all 
online.
Whether or not your missing iOS device 
is connected, you can send a command 
to carry out one of three actions through  
the app: trigger a loud sound regardless 
of whether the device’s audio is muted 
with an optional message; turn on a 
PIN code for access, which immediately 
knocks the device into a locked state; or 
wipe the hardware clean.

Wiping can take a minute or so on any 
iOS device released in 2009 or later; 
2007 and 2008 hardware lacks an 
encryption chip that makes erasing a 
device a simple matter, and can take 
hours to remove your data.
If a device isn’t connected to a network 
or is powered down, the next time it 
accesses a cellular or Wi-Fi network the 
device responds to whatever commands 
were sent.
Of course, if your device is lost or stolen, 
an app seemingly has no use, right? You 
can access Find My iPhone from any 
Web browser, but this free, small app 
can be installed on another iOS device 
(perhaps that of a friend), and your 
MobileMe username and password are 
all you’ll need to access it—and your 
password isn’t stored when you’re done.
That last choice is the nuclear option. 
As long as you’ve recently connected 
your iOS device to iTunes, you will have a 
backup of your apps, preferences, mail, 
and other data. Wiping it remotely only 
destroys any data created that you didn’t 
sync remotely. (New contacts or modi-
ﬁed calendar events, for instance, will 
be synced via MobileMe if you have that 
over-the-air feature activated.)

TextExpander 
$4.99 ǩSmile Software ǩhttp://5str.us/6u6
Shortcuts expand to avoid tedious retyping in many writing and posting apps
TextExpander turns shortcuts into lon-
ger text—as simple as that. It’s a subset 
of what used to be called a “macro” 
program, an old word-processing term. 
Figure out text that you’re going to enter 
over and over again, like the current 
date, your name, your address, or even a 
common phrase (like “Sincerely yours”). 
Enter that, and then an associated 
shortcut (like “SY”). 
TextExpander includes a scratchpad 
where you can write and use its shortcut 
expansions, and then copy or forward 
elsewhere. But it’s most useful within 
a few dozen writing apps that directly 
support TextExpander and its shortcuts. 
You can then type your shortcut in those 
apps and the text is magically replaced. 
The developer keeps a list at http://5str.

port in this book include Twitter (p. 22), 
Elements (p. 158), and Simplenote (p.

Why not extend your desktop to the 
screen of your iOS device? Air Display 
makes it happen. The clever app fools 
your computer into thinking an iPhone, 
iPod touch, or iPad is just another moni-
tor. You install a software package onto 
your computer (Mac OS X on Intel sys-
tem, or most versions of Windows XP, 
Vista, or 7), restart, and then launch Air 
Display in iOS. Both the computer and 
the iOS device have to be on the same 
Wi-Fi network for the extension to work.
Air Display now actds just like another 
monitor attached to your computer (see 
ﬁgure at upper right). Tap on the iPad or 
other device to control the cursor or you 
can use the computer’s mouse.
iOS devices can’t update a screen very 
quickly compared to a standard LCD 
montior. That, coupled with network 
bandwidth limits, make Air Display 
slower than your main monitor or moni-
tors. It’s best to put items that aren’t 
animated on the virtual screen, such as 
palettes from a layout program, text-
based software, or a Twitter client.
Air Display is probably best used with 
a laptop on the road, where you want 
some extra territory and aren’t trooping 
around with an LCD panel. Or if you’re 
just tired of Photoshop CS5’s ﬂoating

Devicescape specializes in connecting 
Wi-Fi devices to Wi-Fi hotspots without 
you needing to lift more than perhaps 
one ﬁnger. The Easy Wi-Fi app combines 
three different functions in a single 
place: accounts, connections, and maps.
Easy Wi-Fi doesn’t sell Wi-Fi access, 
but, through its Web site or the app, you 
can enter your login details for any of 
hundreds of for-fee or login-required 
networks. For instance, AT&T DSL and 
ﬁber (U-Verse) and Qwest subscribers 
receive free Wi-Fi access accounts as 
part of their broadband service. And, if 
you use Boingo Wireless’s laptop service 
(not Boingo Mobile, see p. 191), you can 
link in that account, too.
At a hot spot, you have to launch the app 
the ﬁrst time you visit due to restric-
tions Apple places on its operating 
system that prevent direct access to 
network settings by developers. On 
subsequent occasions, no launch should 
be required. A big friendly set of green 
Wi-Fi signal waves indicates when you’re 
connected, along with other details as 
needed.
The app can show hotspot details on a 
map either by using your current loca-
tion or letting you perform a search on 
an address. 
Pins mark known hotspots, whether 
commercial or public. Blue pins indi-
cate free access, while red pins show 
locations that require a fee, account, or 
code. The number of waves emanating 
from the pin indicates network quality. 
Tap a pin, and you can get more infor-
mation about the location if it’s avail-
able, such as a rating, or add details.
Assuming you want to do something 
after connecting, Easy Wi-Fi includes 
an app launcher; tap the red button at 
upper left. You can customize what’s in 
the list from a small set of choices.

Boingo also offers Boingo Wi-Fi Credits 
(http://5str.us/wwp), an app that lets 
you buy one-hour credits at $1.99 each 
(or 11 for $19.99) for its worldwide loca-
tions using your iTunes Account. The 
ﬁrst hour is free.
Boingo Mobile extends the usefulness 
of any iOS device. While carriers in the 
U.S. and several other countries include 
in iPhone service plans modest to com-
pletely unlimited use of Wi-Fi hotspots, 
those offers don’t include all paid loca-
tions in a given country or region.
If you own an iPod touch or iPad (the 
Wi-Fi only model or a 3G unit without 
an active cellular data plan), you need a 
Wi-Fi network connection to access the 
Internet at all. If you’re as frugal as I am, 
you’d also rather not pay extra for Wi-Fi, 
or at least not pay for each connection 
you make. (On a typical trip for me, that 
could be airport, airport, coffeeshop, 
hotel, airport, airport.)
The $7.95-per-month Boingo Mobile 
subscription ties an iOS device into 
125,000 locations worldwide. The ser-
vice works with any iOS device (with 
3G active or not). In the US, Boingo 
connects with tens of thousands of 
hotspots. 
It’s a way to avoid excess data charges 
on cellular data networks, such as AT&T. 
Paying $7.95 per month instead of $10 
or more each time you cross a monthly 
limit may be a good tradeoff.
Apple doesn’t allow any app to touch 
network settings directly, so when you 
arrive at a hotspot you ﬁrst join the net-
work, and then launch the Boingo Mobile 
app. If it’s a Boingo-afﬁliated hotspot 
a Connect button appears. Tap it, and 
you’re connected.

for another. You can pick “skins” or color 
themes as well (those apply to both 
orientations).
To undo a calculation, swipe left on the 
results area; do so repeatedly to step 
back further and further. Swipe down on 
the display area, and you reveal more 
information, including the current con-
tents of memory. Tap the i, swipe down, 
and tap Advanced Settings, and you can 
choose what the extra ﬁelds contain.
But you can dive much deeper than just 
straightforward calculations. Specially 
labeled keys bring up more information. 
The 42 button, a tip of the hat to Douglas 
Adams, dislays a list of constants sorted 
by type, like atomic and mathematical.
Tap the A→B button, and a host of con-
versions becomes available. You can use 
routine calculations, such as energy, 
legnth, and weight.
But PCalc also includes currency con-
version, with an automatic update if 
the numbers haven’t been refreshed 
recently. You can tap Update Currency 
Rates to force an update, too. The con-
version area lets you scroll through 
widely used currencies ﬁrst, and then 
move on to less-common ones.
The app generates a ”paper tape” of cal-
culations that you can email or copy.

Calcbot 
$1.99 ǩTapbots ǩ
http://5str.us/r73
A replacement for Calculator when you 
don’t need all the oompf of Pcalc
Calcbot is a attractive replacement for 
the Apple-provided Calculator app. The 
main screen offers the usual suspects 
(zero through nine, I m watching you), 
but once you start entering a calcula-
tion, the difference is apparent. 
Operators, like plus and multiply by, are 
shown as part of a sequence below the 
running total. Swipe down, and you can 
see a virtual tape of the transactions, 
which you can email. 
Swipe on the main button area to the 
right, and advanced mathematical oper-
ators appear for handling sines, cosines, 
square, logarithms, and more.
If you’re calculating money, tap the i 
button at the lower right, and turn on 
Round for Currency. This will display the 
currency symbol for your current locale, 
and round fractions to two decimal 
places.

Calvetica 
$2.99 ǩWesley Taylor Design ǩhttp://5str.us/vmi
Attractive presentation of calendar data with clever ways to view and modify events
To edit an event, tap it. To set an alarm 
or change it, tap the alarm icon to the 
event’s right. Alarms are shown in black 
if inactive, and red if a time is set. Swipe 
across an event that’s not being edited, 
and you can tap a cross of arrows to 
move the event’s time, a magnifying 
glass to set details like duration, and 
a checkbox to choose the calendar to 
which the event belongs.
Calvetica picks up several Swiss 
themes: Helvetica is a Swiss face (one 
that’s long battled for Swiss dominance 
with Univers) that’s had a movie made 
about it; the red of the Swiss ﬂag is used 
in the app, plus its square cross appears 
in the app’s icon. 
Having studied for years in my youth 
with Swiss and Swiss-trained design-
ers, I’d say Calvetica gets the aesthetic 
mostly right—but my teachers would 
have said too many different sizes of 
type were in use.
Calvetica isn’t for everyone, but if 
you love an austere interface and the 
Helvetica typeface, you’ll love this app. 
Calvetica is a replacement for iOS’s 
built-in Calendar app. Events added or 
changed in this app, iCal or BusyCal on a 
Mac, the Calendar app, or MobileMe all 
synchronize together.
Calvetica makes a bold statement from 
its home screen: a large year, a set of 
months, and a calendar grid with dots 
next to dates to indicate how many 
events occur on those dates. Tap the 
date, and the day view appears. Tap line 
icons at the bottom to show events, a 
range of hours you set, or all hours.
You can create a new event just by tap-
ping the blank line next to an hour. If you 
want to create an event for an hour start 
that’s already ﬁlled, or you want to start 
at 15-minute intervals, a red popout 
menu appears with :00, :15, :30, and :45. 
Tap a number, and ﬁll in the event.

Flashlight+ 
$0.99* ǩMore Blu Sky ǩhttp://5str.us/nrd
A button, a strobe, and sending out an SOS
There are a million (not literally) ﬂash-
light apps available from the App Store 
which light up an iOS device’s screen in 
shades, strobes, and other effects. Nifty. 
But Flashlight+, which works only with 
an iPhone 4, uses the LED ﬂash in the 
back, which is far brighter. The app has 
simple controls: a big button for on and 
off, an option to strobe the light, and a 
screen to ﬂash an SOS.

This free app uses a single screen to

turn the light on and off, set the strobe, 
and tap to ﬂash a light—what the app 
calls Manual Control.

CardStar 
FREE ǩMesa Dynamics ǩhttp://5str.us/wh8
Consolidate your barcoded membership cards into an app
Open your wallet or pocketbook, and 
see how many cards you carry that bear 
a barcode instead of a magnetic strip. 
That many, huh? Shouldn’t a computer 
be able to free you from the tedium of 
carrying computer-readable codes? 
CardStar can.
The app can’t (yet) scan your barcodes 
directly, sad to say, but the free app has 
dozens of preset entries for department 
and grocery stores, membership clubs, 
libraries, museums, and other busi-
nesses and institutions built in.
To add cards, you tap the + and select 
the business or group type or All 
Merchants. (Merchants, confusingly, 
includes public institutions like librar-
ies, and membership clubs, like gyms). 
You can select from a list of all included 
ﬁrms or organizations, or type in a 
search. (The program’s makers say you 
can email them with missing categories 
and they’ll add them in an update.)
Tap Done after selecting the right com-
pany or group, and then tap the ﬁeld 
beneath Enter Membership Number. Tap 
in the number, and you’re done. From 
the main view, tap the name, and the 
barcode appears, ready for scanning 
whenever you’d normally show your 
physical card.
Mesa Dynamics notes that some newer 
scanners cannot read barcodes from 
the Retina Display screen used with the 
iPhone 4 and 4th-generation iPod touch. 
However, the app shows the barcode’s 
number, which can be entered by hand. 
The ﬁrm is working on the solution.
CardStar provides associated informa-
tion where available in the Info tab, such 
as a link to a store locator or customer 
service contacts usually launching 
Mobile Safari. In a future update, the 
app’s maker plans to include coupons 
alongside particular brands for which 
you have afﬁnity cards.
