KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Winter 2014)
Problem Set Week 4
This problem set focuses on material covered in Lecture 6, so you should watch the lecture and attempt
Assignment 6 before submitting your answers. The deadline for completing (and submitting) the problem
set is Monday March 3 at 9:00AM US-PST. Note that you can save your entries as you work through
the problems, and can change them at any time prior to submission, but once you submit your answers
no further changes are possible.
1. Which of the following is equivalent to ¬∀x[P(x) ⇒(Q(x) ∨R(x))]? (Only one is.)
(a) ∃x[P(x) ∨¬Q(x) ∨¬R(x)]
(b) ∃x[¬P(x) ∧Q(x) ∧R(x)]
(c) ∃x[P(x) ∧¬Q(x) ∧¬R(x)]
(d) ∃x[P(x) ∧(¬Q(x) ∨¬R(x))]
(e) ∃x[P(x) ∨(¬Q(x) ∧¬R(x))]
2. Let p, q be variables denoting tennis players, let t be a variable denoting games of tennis, and let
W(p, q, t) mean that p plays against q in game t and wins. Which of the following claims about
tennis players mean the same as the symbolic formula ∀p∃q∃tW(p, q, t)? Select all that have that
meaning.
(a) Everyone wins a game
(b) Everyone loses a game
(c) For every player there is another player they beat all the time
(d) There is a player who loses every game
(e) There is a player who wins every game
3. Let p, q be variables denoting the tennis players in a club, let t be a variable denoting the club’s
games of tennis, and let W(p, q, t) mean that p plays against q in game t and wins. Assuming that
there are at least two tennis players and games between them do take place, which (if any) of the
following symbolic formula cannot possibly be true? Select all you think cannot possibly be true.
(a) ∀p∃q∃tW(p, q, t)
(b) ∀p∀q∃tW(p, q, t)
(c) ∀q∃p∃tW(p, q, t)
4. Which of the following means “Everybody loves a lover”, where L(x, y) means (person) x loves
(person) y and a lover is deﬁned to be someone in a mutual loving relationship? [If English is not
your native language, you might want to discuss this sentence with a native English speaker before
you answer. It’s an idiomatic expression.]
(a) ∀x∀y[∃z(L(x, z) ∧L(z, x)) ⇒L(y, x)]
(b) ∀x∀y[∀z(L(x, z) ∨L(z, x)) ⇒L(y, x)]
(c) ∀x[∃z(L(x, z) ∧L(z, x)) ∧∀yL(y, x)]
5. Which of the following statements about the order relation on the real line is/are false?
(a) ∀x∀y∀z[(x ≤y) ∧(y ≤z) ⇒(x ≤z)]
(b) ∀x∀y[(x ≤y) ∧(y ≤x) ⇒(x = y)]
1

(c) ∀x∃y[(x ≤y) ∧(y ≤x)]
(d) ∃x∀y[(y < x) ∨(x < y)]
6. A student produced this purported proof while trying to understand Euclid’s proof of the inﬁnitude
of the primes. Grade it according to the course rubric. SEE HANDWRITTEN PROOF ON NEXT
