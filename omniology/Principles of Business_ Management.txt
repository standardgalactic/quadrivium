Publisher’s Note
Management is the second of a new six-vol­ume series 
with the title Principles of Business. The first volume, 
Principles of Business: Finance, has already appeared, 
and future volumes on Marketing, Entrepreneurship, 
Accounting, and International Business will be pub­
lished into 2018. This resource is intended to intro­
duce students and researchers to the fundamentals 
of business topics using easy-to-­understand language. 
We hope that these books will become a go-to re­
source for interested readers seeking understanding 
of these important and far-reaching business topics.
The entries in this volume are arranged in an A to 
Z order, from “Behavioral Economics” to “Types of 
Business Organizations,” making it easy to find the 
topic of interest. Each entry includes the following: 

 An Abstract that provides a brief, concrete 
­introduction to the topic and how the entry is 
­organized;

 An Overview that offers a clear presentation of the 
topic;

 Multiple subheads that anchor the reader to the 
various concepts being discussed;

 Suggested Reading list that relates to the entry;

 A detailed Bibliography.
The book begins with an introduction to business 
management that discusses, in particular, the impact 
of technological innovations in business data man­
agement and supply chain management. The evo­
lution of technology and thus, the workplace, has 
allowed organizations to offer benefits such as tele­
commuting, job-sharing, traditional flextime, and 
compressed work weeks. In order to remain com­
petitive, businesses must continue to be flexible and 
above all else, have excellent management in place 
for organizational sustainability. 
Added features include numerous illustrations 
and helpful diagrams of rel­evant topics. 
The back matter in Principles of Business: Management 
is another valuable resource and includes:

 Detailed Glossary with more than 600 terms;

 Subject Index.
Salem Press extends its appreciation to all involved 
in the development and production of this work. 
The signed entries have all been written by scholars 
and experts in business. Without these expert 
contribu­tions, a project of this nature would not be 
possible. A full list of contributor’s names and af­
filiations follows this Publisher’s Note. Principles of 
Business: Management is available in print and as an 
e-book.

Introduction
The functions and activities of management have 
remained broadly the same since modern firms first 
began engaging in commercial activities. Managers 
have always had to develop strategy, plan actions, or­
ganize functions, control processes, and lead others—
all in a manner that successfully drives business. What 
has changed over time is how managers have viewed 
and executed these functions in response to evolving 
business conditions and new technologies.
This volume provides an arsenal of essential busi­
ness management knowledge and practices. This 
knowledge is what enables managers and executives 
to function effectively in a complex world of change. 
These management practices provide managers and 
executives with proven means to transform man­
agement knowledge into action steps and initiatives 
that help organizations function more smoothly and 
achieve and maintain long term sustainability. The 
ability of managers and executives to guide their 
organization is especially critical in turbulent times, 
such as the current business climate that many busi­
nesses find themselves in.
Entrepreneurs who shun traditional business ca­
reers to pursue their unique and creative ideas, with 
little regard for formalized knowledge, may find that 
they can take their ideas only so far before the kinds 
of management knowledge and practices described 
in this work are needed to move the enterprise for­
ward. Investors and venture capitalists may be at­
tracted to an innovative idea, but they understand the 
need to adequately manage business functions and 
operations in order to achieve long-term growth of a 
new company. Many such investors, in fact, implant 
seasoned managers into a start up in which they have 
invested. It’s not unusual for the original founders of 
a start up to be relegated to symbolic roles in their 
company as more experienced managers take over. 
The bottom line is that there is no escaping from the 
study of management knowledge and practices if a 
business is to succeed.
The Impact of Technology on Business 
­Management 
Business data management has become a core activity 
for all businesses, supporting a wide array of activi­
ties that include financial management, accounting, 
purchasing, sales, human resource management, 
facilities management, product planning, manufac­
turing, and strategic planning. The activities of vir­
tually every employee in every organization are de­
pendent on business data management (Moynihan, 
Tony 1990). 
The ways in which information technology (IT) is 
used in an organization have also changed. Over the 
last few decades the technology that supports busi­
ness data communications has been moving away 
from networks built solely with cables and wires to 
wireless systems. Cell phones provide access to e-mail, 
apps, web pages, and text messages. Laptops and tab­
lets connect to the Internet from almost anywhere in 
the world and can be used in the same way, for the 
same work, as a desktop computer connected to an 
office network with a cable.
Implementation of IT-based supply chain manage­
ment systems has been shown to have a positive effect 
on procurement of materials for production as well 
as on distribution, marketing, and sales after produc­
tion (Richardson 2006). The integration associated 
with these processes is achieved through a variety of 
initiatives that may require expertise spanning the 
business process domain, partnership context, IT, 
and data communications (Rai, Patnayakuni and 
Seth 2006).
Information systems must be effectively managed 
to assure that business data processing is performed 
correctly and that the outcomes of data processing 
operations (reports, records, analysis, etc.) are ac­
curate and reliable. During the last two decades 
the importance of information system (IS) controls 
has grown. What might have begun as a process for 
maintaining the internal integrity of business data 
processing can now be used to help assure compli­
ance with various complex laws regarding the accu­
racy of corporate financial data or the protection of 
data regarding individuals. An information systems 
audit often include tests of transactions and outputs 
in order to provide reasonable assurance that secu­
rity standards and controls are properly designed and 
implemented (ISACA 2001).
Because firms are so thoroughly dependent on 
business data management and the technologies that 
support data management, contingency planning

x
has also become an essential business function. 
Contingency planners must be able to identify crit­
ical systems and critical data. They are tasked with 
developing alternative means to provide systems and 
data so that disruptions in operations and the po­
tential loss of revenue can be avoided. Contingency 
plans must also be updated to reflect changes in an 
organization’s needs.
Changes in the Workplace 
Management of the 21st-century workplace faces sev­
eral challenges. In a number of sectors, employers are 
expected to face a serious labor shortage. While baby 
boomers continue to retire, an insufficient number of 
younger people are entering the workforce to replace 
them. Those who do will certainly not have compa­
rable experience. Recent estimates put the U.S. labor 
shortfall between 3 and 10 million workers. 
In addition, the demographics of the workforce 
are changing in interesting ways. Women in the work­
force have increased from 43 percent to 60 percent in 
the last three decades. Today, nearly three-quarters of 
mothers with children under age 18 are in the work­
force, and most married couples live in two income 
households (Clark and Reed, 2004).
Thanks to increasing choices and opportunities, 
women today are more likely to hold more than one 
job or to attend a night program for graduate school, 
and in general to work both harder and longer, than 
their counterparts 50 years ago. Because women have 
a greater interest in work/family balance, they are 
also more likely to negotiate flexible arrangements, 
including flextime and compressed work weeks, 
telecommuting, job sharing, part-time employment, 
shorter work hours, or to leave the workforce alto­
gether, when affordable (Piscione, 2004).
Management is adapting to this changing world 
by offering family-friendly benefits, including depen­
dent care flexible spending accounts, job-sharing, 
child care, daily and traditional flextime, compen­
satory time off, family leave above the legal require­
ments, part-time telecommuting, the option to work 
at satellite sites or off-site locations, compressed work 
weeks, domestic partner benefits, and paid time-
off banks. They may also offer family- or employee-
friendly benefits such as wellness programs, home 
buying assistance, scholarship programs for the chil­
dren of employees, tuition reimbursement, flexible 
or cafeteria style benefits plans, volunteer release 
time, phased retirement, and concierge services 
(Clark and Reed 2004).
Conclusion
Organizations take many things into consideration 
when developing their competitiveness. Success is 
the result of numerous factors, and excellent man­
agement is always essential for organizational sustain­
ability. Employees possess expertise and experience, 
for example, and human resource management and 
development is required to improve and leverage this 
into a competitive advantage. 
Principles of Business: Management addresses impor­
tant aspects of business management ranging from 
strategy development to planning to project manage­
ment. Familiarity with these topics is necessary for 
anyone who wants to lead an organization towards its 
corporate goals. Of course, it will take time to develop 
a productive understanding of all of the areas covered 
in this work, but successful business executives know 
that learning is a life-long process. Keep in mind, too, 
that what matters is not what an education can do for 
you; what matters is what you do with your education.

Behavioral Economics & Finance
ABSTRACT
A burgeoning field within the economics discipline 
concerns itself with consumer psychology. As such, 
the field of behavioral economics and finance em­
ploys a broad array of tools and methods to create 
a substantial composite of the consumer. Such an 
illustration is critical as it aids economists, financial 
professionals and policymakers to implement effec­
tive approaches and responses to problems within 
a system. This paper takes an in-depth look at the 
growing field of behavioral economics and finance 
and its significance for the overall study of economics.
OVERVIEW
The esteemed political economist and writer Peter 
Drucker once said “A business exists because the con­
sumer is willing to pay you his money. You run a busi­
ness to satisfy the consumer. That isn’t marketing. That 
goes way beyond marketing” (“Building brands,” 2009).
The most significant “x-factor” in an economic 
system is the behavior of the consumer. How he or 
she acts or reacts in a given situation is arguably the 
key to determining a business’s best course of action. 
It is for this reason that economics looks to under­
stand consumer behavior as part of its pursuits.
For generations, the approach to understanding 
consumer behavior in economics has been somewhat 
limited, due scientific dependence upon modeling 
and “real time” assessments. Such a conservative ap­
proach has led to a lack of information regarding con­
sumer mindsets and also on how consumer ­behavior 
impacts the economic system in question.
The Development of a New Sub-Discipline
Behavioral economics and behavioral finance are 
terms that apply to a field of study that involves 
the application of social and human cognitive and 
emotional patterns for the purposes of understanding 
economic decisions and how they impact market 
prices, returns and resource allocation (“What is be­
havioral economics?”, 2005). Behavioral economics is 
combines the disciplines of psychology and sociology 
within an economic framework.
Because it entails the application of varying degrees 
of other scientific fields, a great deal of debate con­
tinues regarding the origins of behavioral economics. 
In the view of many observers, iconic economist Adam 
Smith was perhaps the first to see “psychology as part 
of decision-making,” according to business professor 
Nava Ashraf, adding, “He saw a conflict between the 
passions and an impartial spectator” (Lambert, 2006). 
Regardless of the founder of this increasingly relevant 
field, the fact that many applications of behavioral eco­
nomics in recent history have coincided with major 
changes in economic conditions is undeniable.
In the mid-19th century, for example, the in­
troduction of the concept of social insurance (like 
Social Security) in Chancellor Otto von Bismarck’s 
Germany represented a major change in economic 
systems. Such programs were implemented in large 
part to counter the growing socialist and communist 
movements in Europe. They also heralded a new 
order of government-managed financial assistance 
programs which transformed bureaucratic institu­
tions and administrative budgets. At the same time 
that Bismarck introduced these programs, Germany 
saw an increase in the number of university depart­
ments and research institutions that were dedicated 
to studying the social aspects of economics. It was be­
lieved that the idea of social insurance programs orig­
inated not in economic policymaking circles but by 
non-academic social activists. Therefore, the study of 
the forces that created such programs would require 
methodologies and disciplinary applications from 
outside of the economic sphere, such as sociology, 
political science and psychology (Shiller, 2005).

Prospect Theory
The application of psychology and other non-­economic 
disciplines to the study of economics has continued 
to develop for more than a century. One of the most 
prominent manifestations of this field of study came 
in 1979, when psychologists Daniel Kahneman and 
Amos Tversky introduced the “Prospect Theory.” With 
this theory, Kahneman and Tversky offered a critique 
on the inability of mainstream economic analysis to 
accurately account for consumer decision-making be­
havior. Specifically, they noted that people tend to un­
derweigh outcomes that are based on probability (as 
opposed to certain outcomes) in risk situations. In this 
capacity, value was assigned to gains and losses, rather 
than the conventional approach, which assigned value 
in terms of final assets (“Prospect theory,” 2008). Their 
theory represented a milestone in the burgeoning 
field of behavioral economics and finance.
The evolution of behavioral economics and 
­finance has indeed progressed alongside the ever-
changing economic landscape; it is to the funda­
mental elements of this growing field of economics 
that this paper will next turns attention.
Heuristics
At the center of behavioral economics is the notion that 
neoclassical economics falls short of fully explaining 
consumer behavior. Neoclassical economics has long 
dominated microeconomics, focusing on supply and 
demand frameworks (such as pricing, output, profits 
and income distribution). However, it also relies heavily 
on assumptions that the actors involved in a given study 
are going to act in a rational manner in order to create 
the maximum utility (value derived from choice). Such 
themes are evident in utility theory, which is often used 
to explain decision-making in situations with risk and 
explicitly outlined probabilities (“Utility theory,” 2009).
Behavioral economics does not necessarily dis­
miss utility theory — rather, it compliments it with 
an additional perspective. By adding the psycholog­
ical concept of heuristics (a method used to rapidly 
come to a conclusion based on the probability of an 
optimal solution), behavioral economists believe a 
more comprehensive picture of the consumer’s deci­
sion-making may be presented. In essence, heuristics 
involves so-called “rules of thumb” rather than in-
depth, case-by-case analysis.
Heuristic decision-making processes entail bi­
ased judgments. In other words, past experiences or 
conditions that are either familiar or imaginable to 
the individual are seen as influences on the decision 
being made. In fact, people often overestimate the 
likelihood that past events and experiences will occur 
again (or have occurred prior to the decision), which 
will in turn create more biases in the decision-making 
process. In financial investments, such judgments may 
be critical to how the individual proceeds with his or 
her money.
Heuristic decision-making also often involves “rep­
resentativeness.” This term applies to judgments by 
individuals of conditional probabilities that are based 
on how the data or sample represents the existing 
hypothesis or classification (Camerer & Lowenstein, 
2002). For example, an individual who is operating 
from the hypothesis that a student fits the profile to 
attend a certain class might glean a set of generalities 
about that class and affix them to the student’s profile.
Like other forms of heuristics, representativeness 
does not necessarily provide wholly accurate informa­
tion about a concept — however, what is important 
for the purposes of this paper is the fact that such 
a thought-process creates a short-cut methodology 
for individuals to make decisions on how they might 
proceed in a given economic situation. These “short-
cuts” may in fact diverge from rational consumer be­
havior and create inconsistencies in terms of the out­
come of a given transaction or series thereof.
Framing
In an ideal situation, an individual bases his or her de­
cisions on the information that is manifest. In other 
words, the individual simply takes account of the data 
presented and acts based on that information. Of 
course, such ideal situations are rarely part of reality. 
Instead, data and information is both presented and 
perceived — this latter term suggests that the indi­
vidual making the financial decision may experience 
bias due to the way in which the information is pre­
sented. This fact is demonstrative of another element 
of behavioral economics and finance, one that often 
proves integral in the manner by which individuals 
make their financial decisions: Framing.
In economic terms, framing can be defined as the 
manner by which a rational choice problem is pre­
sented. Framing looks beyond the rational and seeks 
to understand the perception of the individual, pro­
viding once again a more comprehensive illustration 
of the mindset of the consumer.

In retirement planning, for example, framing ap­
pears to play a role in individual savings. In a recent 
study, two approaches to an employee retirement 
plan were examined. On one hand, employees were 
told that they would have to make a “positive elec­
tion” to join the company’s 401(k) plan. On the other 
hand, employees were automatically signed up for 
the plan at a given participation rate with the ability 
to opt out of the program. The two ways by which this 
plan was presented showed a significant difference 
in terms of the amounts participants saved. Those 
who were told that they were required to opt into the 
program saved very little for the program. However, 
those who were simply enrolled at the company rate 
invested significantly more. One company saw plan 
participation rates skyrocket from 37 percent to 86 
percent among new hires under the automatic en­
rollment. The clear divide in response between this 
framing suggests that workers are not particularly 
firm in their retirement planning behavior, and that 
the way in which options are presented may make a 
difference in how much an individual saves (Mitchell 
& Utkus, 2006).
By understanding the impact framing has on the 
consumer, the economist develops a better grasp of 
the individual’s decision-making process. Indeed, 
framing is neither a fully rational nor logical type of 
behavior — in fact, it may be argued that it is largely 
based on sensitivity or emotion rather than ratio­
nality. However, taking framing into account helps 
an economist to better develop a profile of the con­
sumer and aids businesses and leaders in the imple­
mentation of effective policies.
Market Anomalies
As stated earlier, behavioral economics and finance 
was borne of the view that the traditional notion of 
economics — a system that operates based on rational 
behavior — was too rigid to account for an assess­
ment of certain anomalies. Thus far, this paper has 
focused on one side of the equation regarding such 
behavioral anomalies — the consumer. However, be­
havioral finance and economics concurrently reviews 
the economic system which is built, maintained and 
even undone as a result of consumer behavior: The 
market. It is to this area of the economy that this 
paper next turns attention in order to illustrate the 
field of behavioral economics.
Behavioral economics and finance has evolved as 
a response to irrational behavior among economic 
players. However, there are anomalies that occur in 
the marketplace that would suggest irrational be­
havior within the system itself. In the late 1970s and 
early 1980s, several scholarly works pointed to ap­
parent inconsistencies between market prices and 
economic conditions. One suggested that an ap­
parent illusion of inflation resulted in the undervalu­
ation of the stock market. A similar claim was made 
regarding bond prices, suggesting that the realities of 
the economic landscape simply did not correspond 
with the resulting price.
The imbalance between the climate and market 
conditions has led to a reinvestigation of the tradi­
tional concepts of market efficiency. Some econo­
mists assert that this imbalance is caused by investors 
who take advantage of market inefficiencies so as to 
yield higher returns. These traditionalists suggest 
reviewing the returns as a method for pinpointing 
and correcting market inefficiencies. However, a 
1993 study concluded that while this approach may 
remove some irrational behavior from the mar­
kets, it will not correct fundamental inconsistencies 
(Summers, 1993).
Prospect Theory
A useful analytical tool in this arena is the aforemen­
tioned Prospect Theory. Whereas traditional utility 
in economics has been measured by market returns, 
Prospect Theory focuses on the separation of gains 
and losses as definitive of utility. This practice pro­
vides a more comprehensive illustration of the con­
sumer’s trading behavior which permits investors 
to make decisions concerning risk on a case-by-case 
basis. In addition, Prospect Theory allows investors 
to combine high- and low-risk situations and assess 
the overall portfolio before proceeding.
In terms of market anomalies, Prospect Theory is 
of particular use in analyzing the behavior of market 
agents (those who make market transactions on be­
half of the investors). According to a 1998 study on 
stock market trading and a 2001 study on housing 
transactions (both of which employed Prospect 
Theory in their evaluative approaches), investors 
treat each asset on a separate basis, weighing losses 
and gains and making decisions on risk aversion and 
acceptance appropriately. The resulting profile of

investor behavior within the marketplace is therefore 
more complex than the traditional, return-based 
analysis of investor behavior (Pesendorfer, 2006).
Prospect Theory has come under some criticism, 
however, due to the sheer complexity of the profiles 
it creates. For example, the reference point by which 
utility is determined is somewhat nebulous, since it 
focuses on a set of gains and losses rather than a final, 
fixed figure. Still, in light of ongoing market inconsis­
tencies in an era of economic flux, more careful analyses 
of how investor behavior affects markets (and vice versa) 
continue to generate interest in economics and finance.
Behavioral vs. Neoclassical Economics
Behavioral economics and finance developed from a 
perceived need to provide greater answers about con­
sumer decision-making and how it affects the overall 
economy. However, there remains a debate as to the 
usefulness of applying psychological concepts to the 
field of economics.
The example of market anomalies described ear­
lier in this paper provides one such area of contro­
versy. The fact that much of this growing field focuses 
not on the outcomes of such decision-making but 
rather the risks and gains makes the process and its 
assessment somewhat difficult. Without conclusive 
evidence that such a focus provides insight on neo­
classical utility analysis, traditionalists suggest that 
behavioral economics may not be of value in dealing 
with systemic inefficiencies.
This debate may not be concluded without men­
tioning the successful application of behavioral fi­
nance and economic tenets to fiscal policy. Behavioral 
concepts have been useful for the development of 
legal business contracts, as they allow consumer mind­
sets to be better understood and supported. As one 
study indicates, “the success or failure of the behav­
ioral challenge will be judged by its ability to improve 
upon neoclassical economics — both descriptively 
and prescriptively — in specific legal applications” 
(Bar-Gill & Epstein, 2007-2008). Until greater clarity 
can be applied to the conclusions of behavioral eco­
nomics as a compliment to neoclassical finance, the 
debate for or against its utility will likely continue.
CONCLUSION
The American author Dale Carnegie once advised, 
“When dealing with people, remember you are not 
dealing with creatures of logic, but creatures of emo­
tion” (“Dale Carnegie quotes,” 2009). Indeed, in 
virtually every facet of life, humans demonstrate the 
propensity to behave both logically and emotionally. 
Quite often, however, these two types of behavior are 
significantly divergent from one another.
Throughout its long history, the science of eco­
nomics has proceeded from the standpoint that the 
system it studies adheres to a logical, rational men­
tality. Within this framework, economists conclude 
that markets and systems operate based on rational 
behavior that pursues maximum utility. This assump­
tion in many ways discounts consumer behavior be­
cause it is not always manifested in this logical manner.
Since the late 19th century, as market economies 
have developed and flourished, it has become in­
creasingly clear that the consumer is a more complex 
element than previously assumed. Although Adam 
Smith would make such assertions more than a cen­
tury prior, interest in consumer decision-making and 
behavior became more relevant as social welfare pro­
grams became more commonplace. Kahneman and 
Tversky’s Prospect Theory of the late 1970s was argu­
ably one of the most significant contributors to the 
development of the subdiscipline known as behav­
ioral economics and finance.
As this paper has demonstrated, behavioral eco­
nomics and finance has evolved not as a replacement 
of neo-classical economics but as a complement 
thereto. By employing psychological techniques to 
the study of economic and financial systems, behav­
ioral economics helps cast a light on irrational con­
sumer decision-making and behavior.
Shown above, the study of heuristics, framing and 
market anomalies can help the economist create 
a more complete profile of consumer behavior. 
Adherents to the field of behavioral economics assert 
that understanding the basis of irrational consumer 
behavior not only aids business development but gov­
ernment policymaking as well; particularly during 
times of economic recession and/or market flux.
Debate continues as to the relevance of the ap­
plication of behavioral economics in the study of 
economic systems. In particular, while the field does 
raise interesting questions about irrational consumer 
decision-making, it often falls short of contradicting 
the conclusions of neo-classical economic analysis. 
Nevertheless, behavioral economics and finance 
does provide important insight into the mechanics

Behavioral Foundations of Management
ABSTRACT
Management is the process of efficiently and effectively 
accomplishing work through the coordination and su­
pervision of others. To do this effectively requires an 
understanding of human behavior in the workplace; 
in particular, how to lead employees, motivate them 
to do what needs to be done, and provide an environ­
ment that facilitates them in achieving team and or­
ganizational objectives. Regardless of one’s theoretical 
approach to leadership, certain practical behaviors 
have been found to characterize successful leaders. 
In addition, good management depends not only on 
understanding the behavior of the manager but also 
on understanding the behavior of the subordinate. 
Managers need to be able to motivate their employees 
to contribute to the success of the organization.
OVERVIEW
Although there are many aspects to management, 
including administration, decision making, and 
supervising, at its heart, management is the pro­
cess of efficiently and effectively accomplishing 
work through the coordination and supervision 
of others. To do this effectively requires an under­
standing of human behavior in the workplace—
in particular, how to lead employees, motivate 
them to do what needs to be done, and provide 
an environment that facilitates them in achieving 
team and organizational objectives. Leadership is 
not a characteristic or quality that automatically 
induces other people to follow the leader. It is a 
process: a series of actions, changes, or functions 
that bring about the desired result. Leadership 
is also an intentional act. Although leaders’ be­
havior may inspire others to action or to follow in 
their footsteps, they are not leaders unless they are 
conscious of the attempt to modify the behavior 
of others.
Levels of Leadership
As shown in Figure 1, there are three levels of 
leadership.

Principles of Business: Management
Behavioral Foundations of Management
7
Attempted Leadership
The first level is attempted leadership, where Harvey 
attempts to modify the behavior of other people in 
order to do what he wants them to do. This can be 
done with one of three orientations.

 Task orientation is an approach to leadership 
where the would-be leader focuses on the thing to 
be done (such as meeting a quarterly sales goal, 
designing a new widget, or producing gizmos with 
fewer defects). People who have a task orientation 
to leadership tend to be good managers or execu­
tives and focus on organizational goals.

 The interaction orientation to leadership is one 
in which the would-be leader is cognizant of the 
needs, abilities, and personalities of the followers. 
The primary goal of the interaction oriented 
leader is to maintain group harmony. This is an 
important orientation for group leadership and 
necessary for facilitating efficient group interac­
tions. In fact, in many group situations, there are 
two de facto leaders: One who is task oriented and 
one who is interaction oriented.
 In addition, there is a third approach to attempted 
leadership — the self orientation. The person who 
attempts to lead by this approach tends to be a day 
dreamer or underachiever who sees the world as a 
stage on which to act. Self-oriented leaders think 
more about themselves than about the task at hand 
or about the people who are accomplishing that task.
Successful/Effective Leadership
If the people whom Harvey is trying to influence 
actually change their behavior as a result of his at­
tempt at leadership, he is a successful leader. If, on 
the other hand, they do not change their behavior as 
a result of his efforts, Harvey’s attempts at leadership 
have not been successful.
Styles of Leadership
There are three general styles of leadership that are 
based on some combination of power and ability. 
Without one or both of these characteristics, the at­
tempted leadership will not be successful.

 The coercive leadership style is based strictly on 
power. Within the organization, this is typically 
organizational power (such as one’s position as 
a supervisor or manager), but it can also be any 
other type of power to reward or hurt the fol­
lowers. This style of leadership is frequently seen 
in organizations with supervisors or managers who 
invite neither discussion nor participation on the 
part of the employees but use their organizational 
standing and concomitant power (e.g., promote 
or fire; give or withhold raises) to get employees to 
do what they want them to do.

 On the other end of the spectrum is the persua­
sive leader who leads purely on ability. This type of 
leader can be seen in organizations in the form of 
the expert on a work team who is followed because 
of his or her level of technical expertise, ability to 
organize and facilitate work, or other skill. Strictly 
persuasive leaders do not have any power and 
must lead solely by their ability.

 Some leaders, however, use both power and ability 
to lead others using a permissive style of leader­
ship. People using this type of leadership style use 
both their power and ability to bring about the 
desired actions of the part of their followers. For 
example, many persuasive leaders within organiza­
tions use their abilities to lead their followers in 
most circumstances and rely on brute use of orga­
nizational power only in extreme circumstances.
A leader can be said to be effective if his or her ef­
forts bring about a change in the behavior of others 
and they do what the leader wanted them to do. This, 
however, does not necessarily mean that the leader 
was effective. The effectiveness of Harvey’s leadership 
lies in the perceptions of those he was leading, specifi­
cally whether or not they were rewarded for following 
Harvey. Reward can be monetary or social — such as 
a bonus or praise — but it can also take more subtle 
forms, such as getting the task accomplished on time

and within budget. Those who have been effective 
leaders in the past will typically attempt to lead in other 
situations in the future.
Traits & Behaviors Common to Successful Leaders
Leadership theorists have examined the traits and 
behaviors of successful leaders for decades in order 
to help determine what distinguishes an effective 
leader from one who is not. Although many theo­
ries have been posited over the years, one enduring 
theme is that leaders need to change their behaviors 
depending on the characteristics of the situation such 
as the motivation and abilities of the people that they 
are leading. In some situations, a good leader needs 
to focus on concern for the task, while in other situa­
tions a good leader needs to focus on having concern 
for people. For example, a leader may be both suc­
cessful and effective with a hands-off approach in a 
situation in which the people who are being led are 
experienced and trained in the task that they need 
to perform. In such situations, a good leader is often 
well-advised to provide the environment that the em­
ployees need to do their job and to support them 
rather than actively trying to be “in charge.” On the 
other hand, in a situation where the leader has knowl­
edge and experience not possessed by the followers, 
he or she may have to be more directive as a leader in 
order to get the task accomplished. In the situational 
approach to leadership, theorists state that effec­
tive leaders change the style of their leadership de­
pending on the ability and even the personality of the 
people they are trying to lead. Similarly, the contin­
gency model of leadership suggests that effective lead­
ership depends on whether or not the leader’s style 
is appropriate to the situation. For example, a leader 
who prefers to wade into a situation and tell people 
what to do will not be successful in a situation where a 
team works best through synergy, piggybacking ideas 
off each other, and developing a product or idea 
greater than they could have done alone.
No matter one’s theoretical approach to leader­
ship, certain practical behaviors have been found to 
characterize successful leaders.

 First, successful leaders tend to be fair and objec­
tive in their evaluation of the work of others. Orga­
nizational rewards such as promotions, raises, and 
bonuses are often linked to performance in high 
performing companies, so it is essential that per­
formance appraisals be fair.

 Second, it is also important that a leader treat all 
employees fairly and equally. Lack of fair treat­
ment or perceptions of favoritism can lead to job 
dissatisfaction among employees.

 Third, good leaders need to be available to all the 
employees and be willing to discuss the employees’ 
problems with them. This observation stems from 
the need to be concerned both with the task as 
well as with the interactions of a work group and 
the individual needs of the employees.

 Finally, good leaders tend to delegate responsi­
bility as appropriate to their subordinates. This al­
lows the employees to learn new skills, helps them 
prepare for even more responsibility, and lets 
them feel as if they are making a valued contribu­
tion to the organization.
APPLICATIONS
Understanding the Employee
Good management depends not only on under­
standing the behavior of the manager but also on 
understanding the behavior of the subordinate. In 
addition to good leadership skills, managers need to 
be able to motivate their employees to contribute to 
the success of the organization. Too much emphasis 
on the task at hand and not enough concern with the 
needs of the individual employee can easily result in a 
situation in which the employees are dissatisfied and 
do not contribute to helping the organization maxi­
mize its performance. Too much emphasis on the 
needs of the individual without concern for the task, 
on the other hand, may end with employees who are 
satisfied with their jobs but still do not contribute to 
helping the organization maximize its performance.
One of the ways that a manager can help reach 
the proper balance between these two extremes is 
through an understanding of motivation theory and 
application in the work place. Motivation is the study 
of the needs and thought processes that determine a 
person’s behavior. By understanding what motivates 
employees, a manager can better reward them for 
behavior that contributes to achieving the objectives 
of the organization. For example, a worker who is 
motivated by money can often be motivated through 
the possibility of raises or bonuses. For an employee 
who is motivated by status or power, the possibility of 
a promotion or corner office may offer a greater in­
centive for desired behavior.

Motivation
Although part of the role of the manager is to clearly 
specify what kind of behavior is expected in the organi­
zation and to encourage employees to meet or exceed 
these standards by providing feedback, most employees 
need more from the organization than to know that 
they are helping it succeed. To motivate employees to 
perform at a consistently high level, the organization 
must give them what they want or need. Good man­
agers tend to try to determine what motivates their em­
ployees and offer these things within the confines of the 
organization in order to encourage them to contribute 
to the success of the organization. High performing or­
ganizations in particular frequently motivate employees 
to contribute to the company’s high performance by 
linking desired performance to rewards.
Different people are motivated by different things. 
While Harvey may want security to save for the future, 
Mathilde may have what she needs for a secure future 
and want, instead, more time to spend with her family. 
Harvey is more likely to be motivated to work to earn 
more money, whereas Mathilde is more likely to work 
if she is promised more time off. Some motivation 
theorists try to reduce motivation to an equation that 
connects the probability of increased performance 
with such things as the employee’s perceived expec­
tancy of obtaining a reward for doing so. Others, how­
ever, posit that different people are motivated by dif­
ferent things, from having one’s physical needs met 
(e.g., food on the table and a roof over one’s head) to 
having the esteem of others or some other internal in­
centive. However, most motivation theorists recognize 
that people working in organizations both need and 
expect remuneration. Money means different things 
to different people and can act as a motivator for var­
ious needs. For example, some people are motivated 
by money to meet basic physical needs or to have the 
security of knowing that those needs will continue 
to be met for the foreseeable future. Others see pay 
incentives in the form of bonuses, raises, or promo­
tions as recognition from the organization for a job 
well done.
The Hierarchy of Needs
One of the most enduring theories of motivation 
that has been applied to the understanding of em­
ployee behavior is Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of 
needs (Figure 2). Maslow hypothesizes that people 
are motivated by different things at different times 
in their lives depending on what needs have or have 
not been met. The hierarchy also hypothesizes that 
needs lower on the hierarchy must have been satis­
fied before higher level needs can be satisfied.
Physiological Needs
According to Maslow, the most basic level of needs is 
the physiological needs, including the needs to satisfy 
hunger and thirst, sleep, and sex. From an employee 
motivation point of view, this means that a manager 
is unlikely to motivate an employee who cannot put 
food on the table by offering him or her the possi­
bility of a promotion without a pay raise; the need to 
eat in this case is more important than the need to 
impress others with a fancy new title.
Safety Needs
Once the physiological level of needs has been met, 
people become more concerned with safety needs, 
including the need to feel safe, secure, and stable in 
life (e.g., having a job so that one not only has food 
for today but also can buy food for the foreseeable 
future). People who are at this level of Maslow’s hi­
erarchy want to feel that their world is organized and 
predictable. From an employee motivation point of 
view, this might mean that people at this level of need 
would be willing to work without a raise for a given 
period of time if they were assured that there would 
not be a layoff during that period.
Belongingness Needs
Once the security and safety needs of the individual 
are satisfied, the next level of needs is for belonging­
ness. People at this level of need are motivated by 
such factors as the need to feel accepted and part of a 
group, to love or feel affection and be loved in return,

Esteem Needs

and to avoid loneliness and alienation. Someone at 
this level of need may be motivated by being given 
the opportunity to work on a special team to solve an 
organizational problem, thus allowing him or her to 
feel part of a group.
Esteem Needs
The next level of needs in Maslow’s hierarchy is the 
esteem needs, including such things as the need to 
achieve, be competent, and be independent. Other 
needs at this level of the hierarchy include the needs 
for self-respect and a sense of self-worth as well as the 
need for recognition and respect from others. From 
an employee motivation point of view, someone at this 
level of need might be motivated by the offer to be part 
of a special team not because it was an opportunity to 
be part of a group but because it was a respected posi­
tion that showed his or her importance or expertise.
Self-Actualization
The final level on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is self-
actualization. This is a complex concept that basically 
means the need to live up to one’s full and unique 
potential and is associated with such concepts as 
wholeness, perfection, or completion; a divestiture 
of “things” in preference to simplicity, aliveness, 
goodness, and beauty; and a search for meaning in 
life. Employees at this level in the hierarchy would be 
less interested in the things that motivated at lower 
levels on the hierarchy unless they enabled them to 
reach other goals, such as learning, spiritual devel­
opment, or enjoying the wonders of nature.
Other Points of Interest
In addition to the fact that different people are moti­
vated by different things, there are several other things 
that can be learned from Maslow’s hierarchy of needs 
that have direct application to good management.

 First, employees can move not only up the hier­
archy, but down as well. For example, although most 
adults are not worried about the safety and security 
needs (i.e., they have a regular paycheck and live 
in a safe neighborhood), the situation can change. 
An accident or ailing parent may mean that more 
income is needed. A divorce or change in a family 
situation may mean that one’s esteem needs a boost.

 Further, in addition to moving up and down the 
hierarchy, people can experience multiple needs 
at once. For example, in negotiating a strike set­
tlement, a manager will understand that although 
the workers need more money, they also need 
to have the assurance that they will continue to 
have jobs. Sometimes settlements can be negoti­
ated that take such considerations into account 
by giving a token or low level raise in the short 
term for the security of a continuing job with the 
promise of reevaluation of the situation after a 
given period of time.
CONCLUSION
To be a good manager requires an understanding 
of organizational behavior. In particular, it is impor­
tant to understand the behaviors necessary to be a 
good leader and how these behaviors may change 
depending on the individual situation. In addition, 
good managers need to understand the motivations 
for the behavior of their subordinates so that appro­
priate rewards can be tied with performance that 
contributes to the objectives of the organization.

Business Data Management
ABSTRACT
Business data management is an essential activity 
in all types of companies. This article explains the 
four basic steps in business data processing: Data 
creation, data storage, data processing, and data 
analysis. Various methods to accomplish the four 
steps are examined along with changes in technology 
that have impacted how the steps are being accom­
plished in a modern enterprise. As business prac­
tices have changed over the last few decades so have 
business data management methods. The emerging 
supply chain business model is explained along with 
its implications for business data management. The 
necessity for contingency planning for business data 
management is examined and the basic steps to con­
tingency planning are explained.
OVERVIEW
Over the last two decades corporations have been 
placing increased emphasis on the management of 
data (Goodhue, Quillard & Rockart, 1988). Business 
data management is a core activity for all businesses 
and supports a wide array of activities including fi­
nancial 
management, 
accounting, 
purchasing, 
sales, human resource management, facilities man­
agement, product planning, manufacturing, and 
strategic planning. The activities of virtually every 
employee in every organization are dependent on 
business data management. There are four basic 
steps to business data management: Data creation, 
data storage, data processing, and data analysis.
Generally, it is the central Management Information 
Systems (MIS) department that designs, implements, 

Business Data Management
Principles of Business: Management
12
and maintains the computer systems, networks, and 
applications software that support the four basic 
steps of business data management. The director of 
the MIS department, or Chief Information Officer 
(CIO) often participates in business decision making 
at the highest management level in the organization 
(Moynihan, 1990). This participation helps to align 
the activities of the MIS department with the strategic 
business goals of an organization (Grant, 2003). The 
strategic alignment of MIS activities and business goals 
can provide a company with a competitive edge as well 
as reduce overhead by avoiding expenditure for less 
than useful management information systems.
Trained information technology professionals 
staff the MIS department. MIS staff specialize in the 
many different disciplines necessary to create and 
maintain systems to support business data processing. 
These include operations specialists that support 
the data centers that house computer and storage 
systems, network staff that maintain the data com­
munications systems that link systems together, and 
applications programmers who design and maintain 
software. Other specialties include database adminis­
trators who are responsible for database software and 
applications, systems analysts who keep large systems 
up-to-date and operational, and helpdesk staff that 
support end-users throughout the company.
The Creation of Data
Data is created through every-day business processes 
such as the production of items, the consumption of 
supplies or resources, the sale of goods or services, 
and customer service activities. In a consumer goods 
retailer, for example, data is created when inventory 
is ordered, sales are made in stores, employees clock 
in and out for work, and when accounts are paid or 
collected. The larger the retail operation the more 
data that is created on a daily basis, and the more im­
portant it is for data to be accurate and readily avail­
able to support business processes.
Achieving good data management requires an un­
derstanding of data, data management systems, and 
data management software (Chalfant, 1998). This 
means that the staff in the MIS department must un­
derstand the data needs of the organization in order 
for them to best apply their skills to business prob­
lems. But this requires that managers and data users 
throughout the orgnization understand their data 
and how they use it. Interdepartmental teams can be 
established to address business information needs. 
These teams can identify the organization’s data man­
agement needs, what data is needed to meet those 
needs, where the data will come from, how it will get 
into a database, and what can be done with it after it 
is stored.
One of the most important steps in creating and 
maintaining good data is the establishment of a data 
dictionary (DD). A DD is a database of descriptors 
for each piece of data used in an organization’s data 
management activities. A wide assortment of DD soft­
ware packages is available. In general, a DD system 
will hold data that describes data along with its asso­
ciated structures, processes, users, applications, and 
equipment (Vanecek, Solomon & Mannino, 1983).
The Storage of Data
Data storage has three major elements: The software 
used to manage stored data (most often database 
software); the technology used to store data (disk 
drives); and the networks which connect computers 
and computer users to data storage systems. The im­
portance of database software has increased over the 
last three decades and has enabled banks, retailers, 
and manufacturers to grow beyond small local op­
erations into global giants. Disk drive technology has 
also dramatically changed with increases in storage 
capacity, manageability, reliability, and accessibility. 
Data communications networks have become like 
the nervous system of an organization; allowing data 
to be instantly collected from locations across the 
country or around the world. The networks also allow 
data to be utilized by managers and decision-makers 
in offices far from where data is created or stored.
The primary tool for managing large amounts of 
data is database software. IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, and 
other software companies offer a wide variety of data­
base software packages. The packages are capable of 
managing several thousand up to billions of pieces 
of data. Database software can operate on desktop 
and laptop computers as well as on servers and giant 
mainframe complexes. Database software is used in 
virtually all industries especially those that are trans­
action focused and need to track large quantities of 
items or activities.
Organizations with large amounts of data are 
turning to data warehousing models of data storage. 
The five basic steps required to build a data ware­
house is planning, design, implementation, support, 

Principles of Business: Management

and enhancement. In the planning and design 
phases, metadata is created. In data warehousing, 
“metadata refers to anything that defines a data ware­
house object, such as a table, a column, a query, a re­
port, a business rule, or a transformation algorithm. 
Building a data warehouse is a complex process re­
quiring careful planning between the IT department 
and business users” (Gardner, 1998, p. 59).
Data storage technology has rapidly evolved over 
the last two decades. In large organizations there are 
still what many refer to as disk farms, which are vast 
conglomerations of high-density disk drives, capable 
of storing billions and billions of business records. 
New approaches to storage technology include the 
storage area network (SAN), which is a “specialized, 
high-speed network attaching servers and storage 
devices. A SAN allows any-to-any connection across 
the network, using interconnect devices such as 
routers, gateways, hubs, and switches. It eliminates 
the traditional dedicated connection between a 
server and storage. It also eliminates any restriction 
to the amount of data that a server can access, usually 
limited by the number of storage devices attached 
to the individual server” (Tate, Lucchese & Moore, 
2004, p. 1.1).
The Processing of Data
There are two major components required for data 
processing: The software used for processing data 
and the computer systems on which data is pro­
cessed. The goals of data processing procedures are 
to take large amounts of data and make it useful to 
the personnel responsible for operations, managers 
that oversee various business functions, and planners 
who rely on data to forecast business activity. Data 
is processed for day-to-day operations in many ways 
using several different types of software ranging from 
accounting software to inventory control or payroll. 
In addition to helping to manage the storage of 
data, database software can also be used to generate 
planned reports or on-the-spot queries necessary to 
make business decisions.
The second essential element in processing data is 
the computer system on which the data is processed. 
These systems can range from servers capable of sup­
porting small organizations to large complexes of 
mainframe systems capable of processing billions of 
pieces of data in a few hours or in many cases just a 
few minutes.
IBM has dominated the business data processing 
field for several decades. Ever since computing 
started to be used commercially, IBM has been a 
key player in providing businesses with information 
technology. Historically, the mainframe has per­
formed the role of a central data server for many 
large enterprises and has typically provided high 
data throughput, scalability and strong security capa­
bilities. However, over time business computing has 
evolved and now most companies have a multi-tier 
hardware infrastructure with various types of servers 
spread throughout the enterprise.
For decades, mainframes have been viewed as 
large and very expensive systems. However, over 
the last ten years are so, mainframe technology has 
become more scalable and systems are available to 
support the largest global companies as well as small 
companies. The new age mainframe can have from 
one to 54 processors in a single system. In addition to 
flexibility in the number of processors, the new main­
frame provides scalability in memory and in input/
output capabilities.
The Analysis of Data
Complex data analysis, beyond what database soft­
ware provides, has become essential to manage 
large organizations. This type of data analysis can 
be performed with a variety data mining, statistical 
analysis, and decision support software packages. 
This software helps managers and analysts compile 
or create statistics on millions of business transac­
tions. These statistics can support business fore­
casting and planning efforts enabling a company to 
maintain a competitive edge in a competitive global 
marketplace.
Data analysis software has evolved over the last 60 
years. For several years, such software was rather cum­
bersome and required custom programming. In the 
1970s decision support systems (DSS) were introduced 
that provided assistance for specific decision-making 
tasks. While DSSs can be developed for and used by 
personnel throughout the organization, they are most 
commonly employed by line staff or middle and lower 
managers. Among the latest developments are expert 
systems, which capture the expertise of highly trained, 
experienced professionals in specific problem domains.
In the 1990s, executive information systems (EIS) 
or executive support systems (ESS) were being devel­
oped in large organizations (Main, 1989). At first these 

Business Data Management

­systems were cumbersome and most were stand alone 
systems requiring time consuming data entry processes. 
As expected, the technology for EIS has evolved rapidly, 
and new systems are more integrated with other appli­
cations like the DDS or Enterprise Resource Planning 
(ERP) systems (Watson, Rainer & Koh, 1991).
Data warehouses can also serve as analytical tools 
and in some cases data warehouses are developed spe­
cifically for data analysis purposes. According to Jukic 
(2006), there are “two main reasons that could neces­
sitate the creation of a data warehouse as a separate 
analytical data store. The first reason is that the perfor­
mance of operational queries can be severely dimin­
ished if they must compete for computing resources 
with analytical queries. The second reason lies in the 
fact that, even if the performance is not an issue, it is 
often not possible to structure a database that can be 
used (queried) in a straightforward manner for both 
operational and analytical purposes” (p. 84).
APPLICATIONS
Supply Chains Extend the Scope of Business Data 
Management
A supply chain is a network of organizations with 
specialized activities that work together, usually in a 
sequential manner, to produce, distribute, sell, and 
service goods. According to Kumar (2001), “Supply 
chain systems support entire networks of manufac­
turers and distributors, transportation and logistics 
firms, banks, insurance companies, brokers, ware­
houses and freight forwarders, all directly or indi­
rectly attempting to make sure the right goods and 
services are available at the right price, where and 
when the customers want them.
Having delivered the goods or services, the chain 
does not terminate. At the front end, through delivery, 
installation, customer education, help desks, main­
tenance, or repair, the goods or services are made 
useful to the customer. At the end of the product life, 
reverse logistics can ensure that used and discarded 
products are disassembled, brought back, and where 
possible, recycled. The scope of the supply chain, 
thus, extends from “dirt to dirt,” from the upstream 
sources of supply, down to the point of consumption, 
and finally retirement and recycling” (p. 58).
Conventional strategic thinking relied on the in­
dividual firm as the basic unit of competition in a 
given industry. The individual company created, 
stored, processed, and analyzed data all produced 
within the company itself. In a supply chain environ­
ment, “the competitive success of a firm is no longer 
a function of its individual efforts-it depends, to a 
great extent, on how well the entire supply chain, as 
compared to competing supply chains, is able to de­
liver value to the ultimate consumers” (Kumar, 2001, 
p. 58). Consequently, business data management has 
evolved from focusing on data produced by the indi­
vidual entity to that of data created by companies up 
and down the supply chain (Kumar, 2001).
Information technology plays a key role in the 
modern supply chain system by supporting business-
to-business (B2B) applications. Supply chain man­
agement (SCM) is a digitally enabled interfirm pro­
cess that integrates information flow, physical flow, 
and financial flow. Research indicates that a firm’s IT-
based platform capabilities have a substantial effect 
on supply chain process integration. This capability 
is deeply embedded into the structure of interfirm 
operational processes, such as order processing, in­
ventory management, logistics, and distribution; 
financial processes, such as billing and receivables 
management; and information processes, such as de­
mand planning and forecasting.
Implementation of IT-based supply chain manage­
ment systems has been shown to have a positive effect 
on procurement of materials for production as well 
as distribution, marketing, and sales after production 
(Richardson, 2006). The integration associated with 
these processes is achieved through a variety of ini­
tiatives that may include trading partner agreements 
and supply chain partnerships and even deeply em­
bedded IT capabilities. The development of process 
integration capability based on an IT infrastructure 
requires expertise that spans the business process do­
main, partnership context, and IT (Rai, Patnayakuni 
& Seth, 2006).
Issues
Contingency Planning for Business Data Management
Many types of incidents can disrupt computer opera­
tions, and thus critical mission and business func­
tions. These incidents can include a power outage, 
hardware failure, fire, or storm. To prevent disrup­
tion, many organizations have contingency plans 
that directly support the “goal of continued opera­
tions. Organizations practice contingency planning 
because it makes good business sense” (NIST, 2004, 

Principles of Business: Management
Business Data Management
15
p. 121). The U.S. National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) has worked to develop a model 
for contingency planning. NIST breaks the contin­
gency planning process into six basic steps:
Step 1: Identify the Mission- or Business-Critical 
Function
In government organizations, the focus is normally 
on performing a mission, such as providing citizen 
benefits. In private organizations, the focus is nor­
mally on conducting a business, such as manufac­
turing widgets. Protecting the continuity of an orga­
nization is very difficult if the mission or business is 
not clearly identified. The definition of an organiza­
tion’s critical mission or business functions is often 
identified in detailed business plans.
Step 2: Identify the Resources That Support Critical 
Functions
After identifying critical missions and business func­
tions, it is necessary to identify the supporting re­
sources, the time frames in which each resource 
is used and the effect on the mission or business if 
the resource is unavailable. Contingency planning 
should address all the resources needed to perform 
a function, regardless of whether or not they di­
rectly relate to a computer. The analysis of needed 
resources should be conducted by those who under­
stand how the function is performed and the depen­
dencies of various resources on other resources and 
other critical relationships.
Step 3: Anticipate Potential Contingencies
Although it is impossible to think of all the things 
that can go wrong, the next step is to identify a likely 
range of problems. The development of scenarios 
will help an organization to develop a plan to address 
the wide range of things that can go wrong. Scenarios 
should include small and large contingencies. The 
contingency scenarios should address each of the re­
sources described above.
Step 4: Select Contingency Planning Strategies
A contingency planning strategy normally consists 
of three parts: Emergency response, recovery, and 
resumption. Emergency response encompasses the 
initial actions taken to protect lives and limit damage. 
Recovery refers to the steps that are taken to con­
tinue support for critical functions. Resumption is 
the return to normal operations. Strategies for pro­
cessing capability are normally grouped into five cat­
egories: Hot site; cold site; redundancy; reciprocal 
agreements; and hybrids. These terms originated 
with recovery strategies for data centers but can be 
applied to other platforms.
Step 5: Implement the Contingency Strategies
Once contingency planning strategies have been se­
lected, it is necessary to make appropriate preparations, 
document the strategies, and train employees. Much 
preparation is needed to implement the strategies for 
protecting critical functions and their supporting re­
sources. For example, one common preparation is to 
establish procedures for backing up computer data 
files and applications. Another is to establish contracts 
and agreements, if the contingency strategy calls for 
them; or if necessary, renegotiate existing service con­
tracts to add contingency services. Backing up data files 
and applications software is a critical part of virtually 
every contingency plan. Backups are used, for example, 
to restore files after a computer virus corrupts the files 
or after a hurricane destroys a data processing center.
Step 6: Test & Revise
A contingency plan should be tested periodically be­
cause the plan will become outdated as time passes 
and as the resources used to support critical func­
tions change. Responsibility for keeping the contin­
gency plan current should be specifically assigned. 
The extent and frequency of testing will vary between 
organizations and among systems. There are several 
types of testing, including reviews, analyses, and sim­
ulations of disasters (NIST, 2004, p. 122-132).
A review can be a simple test to check the accuracy 
of contingency plan documentation. For instance, a 
reviewer could check if individuals listed are still in 
the organization and still have the responsibilities that 
cause them to be included in the plan. This test can 
check home and work telephone numbers, organiza­
tional codes, and building and room numbers. The re­
view can determine if files can be restored from backup 
tapes or if employees know emergency procedures.
CONCLUSION
There are four basic steps to business data manage­
ment: Data creation, data storage, data processing, 
and data analysis. Business data management

supports the day-to-day operations of an organization 
and provides managers and executives with the ana­
lytical support necessary to direct activities and plan 
for the future. As the global market place has become 
more competitive and information technology (IT) 
and telecommunications have evolved, IT enabled 
supply chain systems have become a widely used com­
petitive business tool.
The dependence on business data management 
and the technology that supports data management 
efforts has made contingency planning an essential 
business function. To be effective, contingency plan­
ners must be able to identify critical systems and data 
and develop alternative means to provide systems 
and data in order to avoid disruptions in operations 
and the potential loss of revenue. Contingency plans 
must also be updated to reflect changes in an organi­
zation’s needs.

Business Impact Analysis
ABSTRACT
As recent disasters such as 9/11 and Hurricane 
Katrina have demonstrated, it is important for organi­
zations to plan for unexpected interruptions to their 
business processes and to develop plans for dealing 
with such situations. This is particularly important in 
today’s businesses that rely heavily on information 
that would be difficult if not impossible to recreate. 
Preparation for interruptions is done through the 
development of a business continuity that describes 
how an organization will recover and restore inter­
rupted critical function(s) after an extended disrup­
tion due to disaster or other causes. An essential step 
in developing an appropriate business continuity 
plan is to perform a business impact analysis. This 
process helps identify the risk of exposure to specific 
threats to the organization and assesses their impact 
on the organization’s functioning if a disaster should 
occur. The Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) suggests a number of considerations for a 
business impact analysis.
OVERVIEW
There is a story of a doctoral candidate who had just 
finished his dissertation and put it in the back of the 
car so that he could take it to the university in order to 
have the final copy signed before being submitted to 
the graduate school for completion of his doctorate. 
It was a beautiful spring day and the man was full of 
the joys of knowing that one has just completed a 
major milestone in one’s life and the that future is 
rosy. So, he carefully placed the requisite three copies 
of the dissertation in the back seat and proceeded 
down the road. However, the day was so beautiful that 
he decided to roll down the windows. As he pressed 
the accelerator toward the floor and felt the rush of 
the wind blowing on his face, his joy soon changed 
to horror as he watched helplessly as the clean white 
pages flew out the window and blew down the road.
The worst could have been avoided had the doc­
toral candidate avoided taking such risks. The can­
didate could have kept the windows of his car rolled 
up tightly and kept backup copies (digital and hard­
copy) at several different (safe) locations.
The loss of information is not only of concern to 
poor graduate students without the means or time to 
recreate their dissertations. As anyone who has ever 
experienced a computer crash knows, the loss of data 
and information can be devastating. Without backups 
of data and information, as well as application software 
and operating systems, it can be extremely difficult 
if not impossible to recreate the information stored 
on one’s computer. If this happens to a business, the 
problem can be multiplied untold times to the point 
where it is impossible to recover. For this reason, not 
only data but entire computer systems and their con­
comitant software programs are regularly backed up.
Sometimes, 
however, 
conveniently 
available 
backups are insufficient to recover from a disaster. As 
the tragedies of September 11, 2001, and Hurricane 
Katrina should have taught us, it is not always sufficient 
to have a backup disk in the computer lab or even else­
where in the building. In fact, sometimes it is not suf­
ficient to have a backup disk on the same block or even 
in the same area of town. By definition, disaster is wide­
spread. By definition, also, disasters are unexpected. 
In order to face disaster and recover from it, therefore, 
one must plan for the unexpected and prepare for it.
The Importance of Backup Systems
Of course, in many (if not most) situations, it is im­
possible to backup everything. From a purely soft­
ware point of view, one could conceivably backup all 
data as well as all application and operating systems 
programs. However, having these things available to 
recover after a disaster may not be sufficient. For ex­
ample, if the building in which the business resided 
was destroyed by a fire, the hardware would also have 
to be replaced. In some situations, this might only 
mean that a new computer system would have to be 
obtained using expedited delivery and new facilities 
leased in order for the business to be up and running 
within the week.
In other cases, however, these actions might be 
insufficient. Getting the power grid, telephone 
system, or emergency services up and running after 
a disaster can be of paramount importance. In such 
cases, waiting a week may not be an option not only 
for the success of the business, but more importantly 
from the standpoint of the potential in lives lost if

such services could not be quickly restored. This is 
why there are extensive backup systems and facilities 
for many such organizations. Although most business 
organizations do not provide critical lifeline services, 
interruption of business processes for an extended 
period of time can be devastating to an organization. 
Therefore, every business is well-advised to develop 
a business continuity plan. Particularly in many of 
­today’s businesses that rely so heavily on informa­
tion as their stock in trade, it is essential that data and 
concomitant systems be backed up and a plan put in 
place to recover in case of a disaster.
Business Continuity Plans
A business continuity plan (also referred to as a di­
saster recovery plan or a business process contin­
gency plan) is a logistical plan that describes how 
an organization will recover and reestablish inter­
rupted critical function(s) after an extended disrup­
tion due to disaster or other causes. Business conti­
nuity plans are written to address the possibility of 
loss of an organization’s facility or access to it, loss 
of information technology, loss of people, or loss of 
one or more elements of the supply chain. A busi­
ness continuity plan comprises the actions and pro­
cedures necessary to restore any data lost when a 
system stops functioning. The plan should include 
both consideration of how to minimize the negative 
impact of a potential disaster and as well as how to 
maintain or quickly regain normal operations after 
a disaster occurs. Business impact analysis is the pro­
cess of identifying the risk of exposure to specific 
threats to the organization and assessing the impact 
of these threats should a disaster occur. The three 
phases of developing a business continuity plan are 
shown in Figure 1.
Risk Assessment
Part of the task of developing a business continuity 
plan is to assess the degree of an organization’s risk 
that is associated with various potential disasters. Risk 
assessment is the process of determining the poten­
tial loss, probability of loss of the organization’s ob­
jectives, and the concomitant impact on the business. 
Risk assessment will help the organization perform 
risk management by analyzing the tasks and activities 
of the organization, planning ways to reduce the im­
pact if the predicted normal course of events does 
not occur, and implementing reporting procedures 
so that project problems are discovered earlier in the 
process rather than later.
During risk assessment, the various risks that 
could affect the organization are defined and 
the probability of their occurrence is estimated. 
However, not all risks are equally pressing, so their 
relative impact needs to be estimated. For example, 
for a business located in Washington, DC, it is more 
important to plan for recovery after a terrorist at­
tack, fire, or tornado than it is to plan for recovery 
after an elephant stampede. Similarly, without ad­
ditional information that changes the probability of 
occurrence, it would be unsound practice to spend 
a large amount of money to prepare for the possi­
bility of a flood in a desert area. However, no matter 
how one tries to quantify risk, the perception of risk 
is always a subjective thing. In addition, risk assess­
ment must also take into account the severity of the 
impact if the risk is incurred. For example, the plan­
ning for a high impact but low probability risk does 
not eliminate the need to plan for a lesser impact, 
high probability risk. In addition, there are things 
that one can do to reduce the probability that a fire 
will occur. Similarly, in many organizations although 
the loss of data could be disastrous, the loss of the

ness Continuity Plan

hardware would be less so since hardware can be 
more easily replaced. Business impact analysis is a 
type of risk assessment.
Business Impact Analysis
During business impact analysis, data and infor­
mation are collected from each business unit in 
the organization to determine what standards or 
regulations must be upheld in an emergency situa­
tion. The analysis describes and prioritizes the tasks 
within each unit, and identifies the resources nec­
essary to perform the critical tasks (without which 
essential business processes cannot proceed). These 
tasks are usually evaluated on the basis of the re­
covery time objective — the time goal for reestab­
lishing and recovering the business functions and 
resources. The recovery time objective should be 
prioritized and take into account any interdepen­
dencies between processes and functions as well as 
any possible economies of scale. All processes and 
functions within a business unit or department may 
not have the same recovery time objective. For ex­
ample, although it might be necessary to recover 
telephone technical support of the customer ser­
vice department within minutes of interruption, 
other functions within the department (e.g., devel­
opment work) could be delayed significantly longer 
without impacting the organization’s effectiveness. 
Although it might be possible to recover many or 
all of the processes or functions in the organization 
quickly, in most cases this would also entail exces­
sive expense. A properly conducted business impact 
analysis can help cut down on unnecessary expenses 
during the recovery period.
In addition to analyzing the impact to effective­
ness of the various internal business processes, it is 
also important to analyze the impact of interruption 
of processes external to the business as well. The in­
ability to obtain raw materials, supplies, or compo­
nent parts from one’s supply chain could bring a 
business process to a halt if there is not a continuity 
plan. This is particularly true if there is only one 
source for the input. Similarly, one must also con­
tinue the other side of the supply chain, including 
the transportation of products to warehouses or re­
tail outlets or of an interruption in those facilities. 
Although some business interruptions may affect 
only the organization or one of its facilities, other 
interruptions may be caused by area-wide disasters. 
The business recovery plan should plan for such 
contingencies.
APPLICATIONS
Considerations When Performing Business Impact 
Analyses
Critical Products, Services & Operations
The United States government Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) suggests a number of 
considerations for a business impact analysis. Before a 
business continuity plan can be developed and imple­
mented, an organization must first identify its critical 
products, services, and operations. The areas consid­
ered in this part of the analysis should include such 
things as the products and services offered by the orga­
nization as well as the facilities and equipment needed 
to produce them; the products and services that are 
provided by suppliers or vendors (particularly if these 
are sole source); “lifeline” services such as electricity, 
water, sewer, gas, telecommunications, and transpor­
tation; and which operations, equipment, and per­
sonnel are vital to the continued functioning of the 
facility or organization. In addition to the primary sys­
tems that are necessary to keep the organization func­
tioning, one must also consider support functions that 
also need backup. These include payroll, communica­
tions, customer service, shipping and receiving, and 
information systems support (Disaster, n.d.).
Potential Disasters
The next step in determining the impact of various 
disasters on a business is to determine what potential 
disasters may befall and to assess the probability of oc­
currence and the potential impact of each. Disasters 
to be considered include not only those that could 
occur within the organization (e.g., a fire), but also 
those that could affect the entire community (e.g., 
a hurricane). The latter type of disaster could affect 
lifeline services as well as make other resources more 
difficult to obtain than would a disaster that only af­
fected the organization’s facility.
It is, of course, very difficult to consider all the pos­
sible emergencies with which an organization could 
be faced. However, there are several categories that 
should be considered and that can help guide this 
part of the analysis (Disaster, n.d.).

Principles of Business: Management
Business Impact Analysis
21

 Historical emergencies comprise those things that 
have happened in the past in the community in 
which the organization is situated or at the organiza­
tion’s facility or at other facilities in the area. Exam­
ples of this kind of emergency include fires, severe 
weather conditions (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes), 
hazardous material spills, transportation accidents, 
earthquakes, terrorism, and utility outages.
 Potential geographic disasters include those that can 
happen as a result of the facility’s physical location. 
These include such factors as proximity to flood 
plains, seismic faults, or dams; proximity to facilities 
that produce, store, use, or transport hazardous ma­
terials; proximity to major transportation routes and 
airports; and proximity to nuclear power plants.

 Technological disasters are those that could arise 
from a process or system failure. Examples include 
fire, explosion, or hazardous materials accident; 
failure of a safety system; failure of telecommunica­
tions systems (e.g., for networks); failure of a com­
puter system; power failure; heating/cooling system 
failure; or emergency notification system failure.

 Another general type of disaster results from 
human error. The probability of this type of di­
saster can be reduced through proper training in 
job tasks and in emergency procedures. Examples 
of human error that can have disastrous effects 
on an organization’s functioning include lack of 
adequate training for personnel; poor equipment 
maintenance (due to poor training of mainte­
nance technicians, inadequate procedures, or 
failure to follow procedures); and carelessness, 
misconduct, fatigue, or substance abuse.

 Disasters can also result from the physical design or 
construction of the facility. Things to be considered 
include the construction of the facility, any haz­
ardous processes or byproducts, safety of the facili­
ties for the storage of combustible materials, layout 
and location of the equipment, lighting, avail­
ability of evacuation routes and exits, and the 
proximity of shelter areas. The analysis should 
also consider any potential emergencies or haz­
ards that the business is regulated to consider.
Estimation of Likelihood & Impact
Once a list of potential causes of emergency 
situations or disasters has been developed, the 
next step necessary to determine their impact 
on the business is to estimate their likeliness of 
occurrence. Although the resultant number is sub­
jective, this task is an important part of risk analysis 
and necessary to determine the potential impact of 
each cause to the business.
Once probabilities have been assigned to each 
of the potential disaster causes, one can assess the 
potential impact of each on the business. This step 
involves the estimation of the impact of the various 
types of disasters on the organization’s market share. 
Considerations during this part of the analysis should 
include such items as loss due to an interruption of 
the business, inability of the employees to report to 
work, inability of customers to reach the organization’s 
facility, impact due to inability to meet contractual re­
quirements (including loss of future business and im­
position of fines, penalties, or legal costs), interruption 
of the supply chain (both of parts and supplies to the 
facility and products from the facility). A sample form 
for performing these estimates is shown in Figure 2.
CONCLUSION
A business continuity plan is a logistical plan that de­
scribes how an organization will recover and reestab­
lish interrupted critical function(s) after an extended 
disruption due to natural disaster, sabotage or ter­
rorism, or other cause. Particularly in businesses that 
rely heavily on information, it is essential that data 
and concomitant systems be backed up and a plan put 
in place to recover in case of a disaster or other type 
of business interruption. Otherwise, the organization 
may not only lose short-term profits, but long-term 
market share as well. Business impact analysis is an es­
sential part of developing a business continuity plan. 
This process includes identifying the risk of exposure 
to specific organizational threats and assessing the im­
pact of these threats should the unthinkable occur.

Business Information Systems & Technologies
ABSTRACT
The influx of data enabled by the technologies of the 
Information Age has literally transformed many busi­
nesses. Most businesses today use information tech­
nology in some form to create, store, and distribute 
information. There are three interdependent com­
ponents of information systems: Computers, com­
munications and expertise. These components must 
work together in order for an information system to 
effectively support the organization in its activities 
and mission. Information systems have several basic 

Principles of Business: Management
Business Information Systems & Technologies
23
functions, including the capture, processing, genera­
tion, storage, retrieval, and transmission of data.
OVERVIEW
The influx of data enabled by the technologies of 
the Information Age and with which we are bom­
barded every day has literally transformed many busi­
nesses. At a basic level, much correspondence today 
is not sent by mail or even faxed, but is transmitted 
nearly instantaneously around the world via e-mail. 
Accounting and project management tasks that used 
to be labor intensive jobs done by hand have bene­
fited from spreadsheet application software that al­
lows quick and easy manipulation of data, checking 
of calculations, and monitoring of tasks. Huge data­
bases improve the ability of organizations to perform 
customer relationship management to better serve 
the customer as well as data mining to determine 
previously unknown relationships that help the or­
ganization better market its products and services. 
Information technology is the use of technology 
from computers, communications networks, and 
electronics to create, store, and disperse information 
and knowledge. Various technology components are 
put together in an information system that facilitates 
the flow of data (i.e., raw facts, figures, or details) 
and information (i.e., organized, meaningful, inter­
preted data) between people or departments.
There are several characteristics of the informa­
tion age that set it apart from other periods in history. 
First, the proliferation of information technology 
has led to a situation where society in many coun­
tries today is information-based, with more people 
dealing with information than with agriculture or 
manufacturing. As the number and range of available 
information technologies increase, a concomitant 
number of businesses depend on information tech­
nology to accomplish their work. This dependence 
is on both the computer technologies that enable or­
ganizations to gather, store, manipulate, and analyze 
data, and also on the communication technologies 
that allow them to interconnect more quickly and ef­
ficiently than ever before. In fact, the understanding 
of information technology and information systems 
is so important in the information age, that in many 
situations it is difficult if not impossible to be suc­
cessful in the business world without it. Information 
technology has become so much a part of our lives 
today that it is often embedded in other products and 
services that we take for granted. For example, the 
phone call one makes for technical support may be 
enabled by network technology and wireless commu­
nications systems so that the call can be answered by 
a technician working halfway around the world. The 
prevalence of information technology does not mean 
that an organization needs to implement informa­
tion technology to be successful, however. Like the 
manufacturing technology that came before it and 
the agricultural technology before that, information 
technology is only a tool and must be understood in 
order to optimize its usefulness in the organization.
Information technology does more than support 
our work. In many cases it also transforms the way that 
we accomplish our tasks and even allows us to do things 
that we would never have been able to accomplish be­
fore. Work processes are constantly being transformed 
through the application of information technology in 
order to improve productivity and free humans from 
many repetitive tasks. For example, typewriters have 
given way to word processors which, in turn, have 
given way to multitasking computers that allow us 
to view, create, edit, and interact with not just docu­
ments but images, audio, animation, movies, websites, 
and more. However, information technology not only 
allows humans to perform existing processes more 
quickly or efficiently than ever before, in many cases 
it also allows us to rethink and reengineer the way that 
we do things in the workplace. Business process reen­
gineering helps organizations and managers rethink 
their practices and processes and introduce radical 
improvements that benefit both the organization and 
its customers. For example, the division of labor neces­
sary to the industrial age is frequently being replaced 
by teamwork, information sharing, and other ways of 
increasing the interconnectedness of workers.
Three Components of Information Technology
As shown in Figure 1, information technology com­
prises three interdependent components: computers, 
communications and expertise. The computer com­
ponent of an information technology system can be 
any electronic system that can be instructed to ac­
cept, process, store, and present data. Although most 
people are familiar with desktop computers for work 
and home, many other devices meet this definition, 
including the microwave oven in the kitchen, the 
timer for the front door lights, the autofocus digital

camera, the ATM machine outside the bank, and the 
automatic ticket kiosk at the cinema.
Computers
In general, computers can be classified into four size 
categories. Microcomputers or personal computers 
are relatively compact. This category of computers in­
cludes desktop computers that comprise a display unit 
and keyboard which sit easily on a desk or table with the 
processing unit fitting on or under the desk. Notebook 
or laptop computers are smaller versions of the desktop 
computer and are designed for portability. The key­
board, display, and processing unit are all part of one 
unit, and weigh an average of three to nine pounds, 
making them easy to transport from site to site. Tablet 
personal computers range in weight from just over half 
a pound to just over two pounds (ConsumerReports.
org, 2013). Tablet personal computers are available in 
a variety of shapes and sizes depending on their pur­
pose. For example, many police departments use tablet 
computers for writing tickets while insurance agents 
often use other models to sketch details of situations 
or prepare damage claims in the field. Smart phones 
are not just phones but are small computers that weigh 
ounces, yet are both fast and powerful, with a wide and 
growing range of applications.
Personal computers are prevalent in most busi­
nesses. In addition, many medium to large sized 
business also may have midrange or mainframe 
computers. Midrange computers (sometimes called 
minicomputers) are used to interconnect people 
and large sets of information. Midrange computers 
can be used across the entire organization (i.e., 
enterprise-wide) or within a specific department. 
Midrange computers typically are dedicated to per­
forming specific functions. In addition, mainframe 
computers — which are typically larger, faster, and 
more expensive than midrange computers — allow 
the interconnection of larger numbers of people or 
processing of larger amounts of data. As opposed to 
midrange computers, mainframe computers typically 
perform several functions at once. In addition to 
these classifications of computers, supercomputers 
are available to solve problems comprising long and 
difficult calculations. Supercomputers run various 
complex applications including scientific research 
and real-world simulations for the design of complex 
equipment such as new aircraft.
In order for a computer to do the work it is in­
tended to do, it needs software as well as hardware. 
Computer software is a set of instructions that con­
trols the computer or communications network and 
that manages the hardware in the system. Operating 
systems are sets of software programs that coordinate 
the actions of the computer and its peripheral devices 
(e.g., printer). Application software performs func­
tions not directly related to the running of the actual 
computer. Application software packages focus on 
particular types of tasks such as desktop publishing, 
graphic design, or database management.
Communications Networks
In addition to computer systems, information tech­
nology also includes various communications net­
works. These are sets of locations (or nodes) with con­
comitant hardware, software, and information that 
are linked together to form a system that transmits 
and receives information and data. Communications 
networks include local area networks (LANs) that 
comprise multiple computers that are located near 
each other and linked into a network that allows 
the users to share files and peripheral devices such 
as printers, fax machines, and storage devices; met­
ropolitan area networks (MANs) that transmit data 
and information citywide and at greater speeds than 
a local area network; and wide area networks (WANs) 
that comprise multiple computers that are widely 
dispersed and are linked into a network. Wide area

networks typically use high speed, long distance com­
munications networks or satellites to connect the 
computers within the network.
Organizations, 
by 
definition, 
involve 
groups 
of people working together to accomplish work. 
Information technology can aid organizations in their 
tasks by linking together multiple computers to share 
files and peripheral devices such as printers. This ca­
pability allows multiple people to work on the same 
document (e.g., inputting data, commenting on a doc­
ument, creating reports from a database). Wide area 
networks — which typically use high speed, long dis­
tance communications networks or satellites to connect 
the computers within the network — can also allow em­
ployees to communicate and cooperate not only with 
colleagues in the next office, but across the globe.
Expertise
Just as computer hardware and software are useless 
without each other, both require the additional input 
of the user’s expertise in order to be able to optimize 
the work that they can do. This expertise includes 
familiarity with the tools of information technology, 
the skills needed to use these tools, and an under­
standing of how and where information technology 
can best be implemented. When all three of these 
components of information technology are working 
together, they can create an information system that 
facilitates and optimizes the flow of information and 
data between people or departments. Information 
technology and systems can support the organization 
in its processes and help it to maximize the use of its 
other resources and be more effective.
Basic Functions of Information Technology
As shown in Figure 2, information technology has 
several basic functions. These functions may occur 
sequentially or simultaneously. First, information 
technology captures data, that is, it compiles detailed 
records of activities for later analysis or processing. 
Examples of data capture include the collection of 
patron information and book information when a 
book is checked out of the library; the assignment 
of seats on an airplane or in a theatre; and the col­
lection of customer information for orders taken 
over the Internet. Captured data are processed (i.e., 
converted, analyzed, or synthesized) into informa­
tion that can be used by the organization and its em­
ployees. Data processing comprises the handling and 
transformation of data into information. Information 
processing involves the transformation of collected 
data from one form into another. Word processing 
allows users to create documents and other text-
based documents. Image processing converts visual 
information such as graphics and photographs into 
a format that can be stored or manipulated in the 
information system and/or transmitted across the 
network. Voice processing systems transform and 
transmit spoken information to enable virtual meet­
ings and other applications. Information technology 
can also be used to generate data through processing. 
The generation function organizes data and infor­
mation into a useful form such as in the generation 
of a document or multimedia presentation. Data and 
information are also stored so that they can be re­
trieved and processed at a later time. Finally, data and 
information can also be transmitted by information 
systems and distributed to other parties via a commu­
nications network.
APPLICATIONS
Linking computers into networks can enhance the 
productivity and effectiveness of the entire enter­
prise. A common example of this can be seen in the 
information systems used in many modern retail 
stores. Computerized cash registers in a retail store 
or other point of sale can be linked together so that 
sales clerks can search across the network to see what 
other store may have a particular item in stock. In 
addition, the computers at the point of sale can be 
linked directly to the corporate headquarters so that 
the store’s closing data each evening can be directly 
and immediately shared with corporate manage­
ment. Information technology can also help indi­
vidual stores keep track of their inventories including 
what items they have in stock, what products are most 
in demand, when it is time to reorder, and even as­
sist in automatically ordering stock. Information

technology can also be used to automatically invoice 
customers and do other billing tasks.
It is not just the enterprise that uses computers to 
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its pro­
cesses. Individual employees, too, increasingly turn 
to information technology to help them in their tasks. 
For example, application software can help people 
keep track of their calendars, including scheduling 
of appointments, meetings, and tasks to be done. 
Other application software is available for project 
management to help employees keep track not only 
of their own tasks but the tasks and processes of large 
projects. These software applications allow project 
managers to track and control schedules for complex 
projects and to communicate status, risks, and other 
information about the project to customers and team 
members.
Another important use of information technology 
for businesses is database management systems. 
These systems are computer software application 
programs that allow the user to create, change, and 
manage a collection of data items that are related to 
each other. Databases are distinguished from other 
collections of data by the fact that their data are used 
for multiple purposes. In a database management 
system, data are placed into a series of tables that are 
keyed to each other and that can be manipulated 
into a variety of reports that display only that portion 
of the database in which the user is currently inter­
ested. The data in the system are managed through 
inputting data into the database, updating the data, 
and representing all or part of the data in various re­
ports that meet the user’s specific needs. Information 
technology enables the creation and manipulation of 
large databases that could not be managed through 
another medium.
Database management systems have a wide range 
of applications for business. Inventory control sys­
tems in retail stores or chains are one example of a 
database management system. Similarly, medical re­
cords management systems in hospitals can help a 
hospital or physician’s office control, organize, and 
manage a wide range of demographic information 
about their patients and their medical histories, in­
formation about their medical insurance coverage, 
and other data that are important to the healthcare 
system. These systems can allow users to pull together 
the information in a variety of ways for various forms 
and records.
Database management systems are also used in 
marketing. Database systems can help marketers 
better understand their target market, collect and 
analyze data on prospective customers, keep track 
of current customers’ buying histories, needs, and 
other characteristics. Database management systems 
can be used to develop targeted mailing lists for new 
products based on customer demographics or buying 
history or track customer purchases so that better so­
lutions can be offered or new products developed to 
better meet their needs.
Another way that organizations are meeting 
the increasing demands for communication and 
information exchange is through communica­
tions networks. These networks can be used for a 
number of purposes. One of the most common 
uses of this application of information technology 
is the electronic transmission of messages and docu­
ments. These capabilities include e-mail, voice mail, 
electronic document exchange, electronic funds 
transfer, and access to the Internet or other net­
works. Communications networks can also be used 
for purposes of e-commerce to buy and sell goods or 
services — including products and information re­
trieval services — electronically rather than through 
conventional means. Networks can also be used to 
support group activities such as the ability to hold 
meetings with participants at geographically dis­
persed sites. Audio and videoconferencing capabili­
ties combined with electronic document exchange 
capabilities can often obviate the need for extensive 
travel to meetings.

Business Statistics
ABSTRACT
Business statistics is the application of mathematical 
statistical techniques to the real problems of the busi­
ness world. In addition to helping the business ana­
lyst to organize and describe data, business statistics 
allows meaningful comparisons to be made between 
and among complex sets of data. Business statistics 
can be applied to a wide range of business problems 
including marketing, operations, quality control, 
and forecasting. The usefulness of statistical analysis, 
however, depends on the quality of the hypothesis 
being tested. There are a number of considerations 
for developing a testable hypothesis that will yield 
meaningful results when analyzed and for designing 
a research study that will control extraneous variables 
while emulating the real world situation to which the 
results will be extrapolated.
OVERVIEW
Every day, business persons are faced with a mul­
titude of questions the answers to which can deter­
mine not only the course but the very success of the 
business. Will the new logo design better connect 
our product in the customer’s mind than the cur­
rent logo does? Will the new widget design attract 
people’s attention and make them want to buy it? Are

men or women more likely to buy a gizmo, and how 
do we best advertise it to them? How do we turn pro­
spective customers into established customers? Will 
oil prices continue to rise and will people be open to 
alternative fuel sources? If the business answers these 
questions correctly, it can be on the leading edge of 
its industry. However, if the business answers these 
questions incorrectly, it can potentially lose money, 
its market share, or even its viability.
Mathematical statistics is a branch of mathematics 
that deals with the analysis and interpretation of 
data. Mathematical statistics provides the theoretical 
underpinnings for various applied statistical disci­
plines, including business statistics, in which data are 
analyzed to find answers to quantifiable questions. 
Business statistics is the application of these tools and 
techniques to the analysis of real world problems for 
the purpose of business decision making.
There are two general classes of statistics that are 
used by the business analyst. Descriptive statistics are 
used to describe and summarize data so that they can 
be more easily comprehended and studied. Among 
the tools of descriptive statistics are various graphing 
techniques, measures of central tendency, and mea­
sures of variability. Graphing techniques help the 
analyst aggregate and visually portray data so that 
they can be better understood. Included in this cat­
egory are histograms, frequency distributions, and 
stem and leaf plots. Measures of central tendency 
estimate the midpoint of a distribution. These mea­
sures include the median (the number in the middle 
of the distribution), the mode (the number occur­
ring most often in the distribution), and the mean (a 
mathematically derived measure in which the sum of 
all data in the distribution is divided by the number 
of data points in the distribution). Measures of vari­
ability summarize how widely dispersed the data are 
over the distribution. The range is the difference be­
tween the highest and lowest scores in the distribu­
tion. The standard deviation is a mathematically de­
rived index of the degree to which scores differ from 
the mean of the distribution.
Descriptive statistics are helpful for taking large 
amounts of data and describing them in ways that are 
easily comprehendible. Pie charts, histograms, and 
frequency polygons are frequently used in business 
presentations and are all examples of ways that de­
scriptive statistics can be used in business. Although 
such descriptive statistics are useful in summarizing 
and describing data, business statistics is an ap­
plied form of mathematics and is a valuable tool for 
helping analyze and interpret data. This can be done 
through the use of inferential statistics, a collection 
of techniques that allow one to make inferences 
about the data, including drawing conclusions about 
a population from a sample.
In general, inferential statistics are used to test hy­
potheses to determine if the results of a study occur at 
a rate that is unlikely to be due to chance (i.e., have sta­
tistical significance). A hypothesis is an empirically test­
able declarative statement that the independent and 
dependent variables and their corresponding mea­
sures are related to in a specific way as proposed by the 
theory. The independent variable is the variable that is 
being manipulated by the researcher. For example, a 
market researcher might be trying to determine which 
new breakfast cereal the organization should bring to 
market. The independent variable is the type of break­
fast cereal. The dependent variable (so called because 
its value depends on which level of the independent 
variable the subject received) is the subject’s response 
to the independent variable (e.g., whether or not the 
people like the breakfast cereal they are given to try). 
Examples of hypotheses include “the new red widget 
logo is better remembered than the old blue logo,” 
“grade school children prefer the taste of new, im­
proved Super Crunchies to original Crunchies cereal,” 
or “Widget Corporation stores in the western states are 
more profitable than those in the East.”
For purposes of statistical tests, the hypothesis is 
stated in two ways. The null hypothesis (H0) is the 
statement that there is no statistical difference between 
the status quo and the experimental condition. In 
other words, the treatment being studied made no dif­
ference on the end result. For example, a null hypoth­
esis about the effectiveness of the two possible logos for 
Widget Corporation would be that there is no differ­
ence in the way that people react to the old logo versus 
the new logo. This null hypothesis states that there is 
no relationship between the variables of old/new logo 
(independent variable) and whether or not people 
like it (dependent variable). The alternative hypoth­
esis (H1) states that there is a relationship between the 
two variables (e.g., people prefer the new logo).
Following the formulation of the null hypoth­
esis, an experimental design is developed that allows 
the researcher to empirically test the hypothesis. 
Typically, this design will have a control group that 

Principles of Business: Management

29
that does not receive the experimental conditions 
(e.g., the group sees only the old logo) and an ex­
perimental group that does receive the experimental 
condition (e.g., the group sees the new logo). The 
analyst then collects data from people in the study to 
determine whether or not the experimental condi­
tion had any effect on the outcome. After the data 
have been collected, they are statistically analyzed to 
determine whether the null hypothesis should be ac­
cepted (i.e., there is no difference between the con­
trol and experimental groups) or rejected (i.e., there 
is a difference between the two groups). As shown in 
Figure 1, accepting the null hypothesis means that if 
the data in the population are normally distributed, 
the results are more than likely due to chance. This 
is illustrated in the figure as the unshaded portion 
of the distribution. By accepting the null hypothesis, 
the analyst is concluding that it is likely that people 
do not react any differently to the red logo than 
they do to the blue logo. For the null hypothesis to 
be rejected and the alternative hypothesis to be ac­
cepted, the results must lie in the shaded portion of 
the graph. This means that there is a statistical signifi­
cance that the difference observed between the two 
groups is probably not due to chance but to a real 
underlying difference in people’s attitudes toward 
the two logos.
Part of the process of designing an experiment is 
determining how the data will be analyzed. There 
are a number of different statistical methods for 
testing hypotheses, each of which is appropriate to 
a different type of experimental design. One class 
of statistical tests is the t-tests. This type of statistical 
technique is used to analyze the mean of a popula­
tion or compare the means of two different popula­
tions. In other situations where one wishes to com­
pare the means of two populations, a z statistic may 
be used.
Another frequently used technique for ana­
lyzing data in applied settings is analysis of variance 
(ANOVA). This family of techniques is used to ana­
lyze the joint and separate effects of multiple inde­
pendent variables on a single dependent variable 
and to determine the statistical significance of the ef­
fect. For example, analysis of variance might be used 
if one wished to determine the relative profitability of 
an organization’s operations in three different coun­
tries. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is 
an extension of this set of techniques that allows the 
business analyst to test hypotheses on more complex 
problems involving the simultaneous effects of mul­
tiple independent variables on multiple dependent 
variables.
Other types of applied statistics allow the business 
analyst to predict one variable from the knowledge 
of another variable. If one were launching a new ce­
real in marketplace, it might be helpful to know the 
demographics of the people who prefer the cereal so 
that it could be introduced into the correct market. 
For example, if the new cereal appealed primarily to 
children but not to adults, it would not be a prudent 
strategy to put it in the grocery store in an all-adult 
community. One way to answer this question is by 
determining the relationship between the two vari­
ables (e.g., age of consumer and attitude toward the 
new cereal). Correlation coefficients allow analysts 
to determine whether the two variables are positively 
correlated (e.g., the older people become, the more 
they like the new cereal), negatively correlated (e.g., 
the older people become, the less they like the new 
cereal), or not correlated at all.
However, real world problems do not always have 
easy answers involving only two variables. For ex­
ample, consumers’ attitudes toward the new cereal 
may depend not only on their age, but on other fac­
tors as well. If, for example, the new cereal is presweet­
ened, consumer’s preferences may be based also on 
such factors as what type of cereal they usually eat,

how much sugar they usually consume in their 
diet, what cereal they ate when they were chil­
dren, or whether or not they have a medical condi­
tion that requires them to reduce the amount of 
sugar in their diets. Multiple regression analysis is 
a family of statistical techniques that allow one to 
predict the score on the dependent variable when 
given the scores on one more independent vari­
ables. This statistical technique analyzes the effects 
of multiple predictors on behavior so that the busi­
ness analyst has a better understanding of their rela­
tive contributions as well as the factors that make up a 
consumer’s preference or other question of interest.
These are only a few of the statistical techniques 
that can be used in the analysis of business data. 
Statistical techniques can be applied to the gamut of 
business problems from marketing research, quality 
control, prediction of marketplace trends or sales 
volume, or comparing the relative efficiency of the 
various operations in a multinational organization.
APPLICATIONS
As opposed to mathematical statistics, the field of 
business statistics is an applied field used to help 
make practical decisions about real world problems. 
This is done through a variety of types of research 
studies.
In general, the goal of research is to describe, ex­
plain, and predict behavior. For example, a marketer 
may want to know which of two proposed new com­
pany logos will be most memorable and will have the 
most positive image in the minds of prospective cus­
tomers. Another example of applied research is when 
the engineering department seeks to determine 
which of two graphical user interfaces is more user 
friendly. Designing a good research study depends in 
part on two factors: controlling the situation so that 
the research is only measuring what it is supposed to 
measure and including as many of the relevant fac­
tors as possible so that the research fairly emulates 
the real world experience.
In the simplest research design, a stimulus (e.g., 
a new company logo) is presented to the research 
subjects (e.g., potential customers) and a response is 
observed and recorded (e.g., which logo they liked 
better and why). There are three types of variables 
that are important in research. As discussed above, 
the variables of most concern in the design of a 
research study are the independent variable, which is 
the stimulus or experimental condition that is hypoth­
esized to affect behavior, and the dependent variable, 
which is the observed effect on behavior caused by 
the independent variable. As shown in Figure 2, how­
ever, these are not the only variables that need to be 
controlled during a study. There are also extraneous 
variables — variables that affect the outcome of the 
experiment (e.g., their response to the cereal) that 
have nothing to do with the independent variable it­
self. For example, if the subject is tired and hungry 
after a long day at work and looking forward to going 
home and having a steak for dinner, no breakfast ce­
real is likely to taste good. Similarly, if a subject has a 
cold and is asked to rate the difference between the 
two breakfast cereals, s/he might not be able to do 
so because s/he cannot taste well at the time. There 
are any number of such variables that are extraneous 
to the research question being asked but that still 
affect the outcome of the research. As much as pos­
sible, these need to be controlled. In this example, 
the analyst could hold all the tastings of the breakfast 
cereal first thing in the morning when no one has 
eaten yet. Similarly, the researcher could make sure 
that subjects in the experiment do not have a cold 
or allergies before they taste the cereal. Although it 
is impossible to control literally every possible extra­
neous variable, the more of these that are accounted 
for and controlled in the experimental design, the 
more meaningful the results will be.
As shown in Figure 3, research design starts with 
a theory based on real world observation. For ex­
ample, from personal experience with two types of 
cereal and observations of how other people react to 
the cereals, a researcher may develop a preliminary 
theory that “Super Crunchies” is more likely to be 
successful in the target market than “Very Flakies.” 
From these observations, s/he forms an empirically 
testable hypothesis concerning the relative attrac­
tiveness of the two kinds of cereal. For example, the

hypothesis may be that “People like Super Crunchies 
better than Very Flakies.” To find out if this hypoth­
esis is true, the researcher next needs to operation­
ally define the various terms (i.e., constructs) in the 
hypothesis. Specifically, s/he needs to determine 
what the components of “like better” are. To do this, 
s/he might develop a series of rating scales that mea­
sure the various components of whether someone 
buys a cereal (e.g., prefers it to the current brand, 
likes the taste, likes the mouth feel, likes the price). 
The researcher would then run the experiment, let­
ting people try both cereals in a controlled setting, 
statistically analyzing the resulting data using infer­
ential statistics, and — based on the statistical signifi­
cance of the answer — determine whether it is likely 
to be cost effective to put one of the two cereals on 
the market.
Not all research is done in the laboratory, however. 
As stated above, it is important not only to control as 
many variables as one can when designing an experi­
ment, but also to have the experimental situation em­
ulate the real-world situation as much as possible. For 
example, although Super Crunchies may taste fine in 
a taste test in a laboratory, when the potential con­
sumer is faced with the reality of feeding it to fussy 
children while simultaneously checking homework, 
making lunches, and driving the carpool, waiting for 
the cereal to lose a little of its crunch may be more 
than time allows.
There are a number of common research tech­
niques that can be used to investigate business 
problems. The laboratory experiment allows the 
researcher the most control over extraneous vari­
ables. So, for example, the cereal tasting could al­
ways be held at the same time of day in a room with 
no distractions and allow people to eat as much of 
each cereal as they want at their leisure. However, 
this situation is far removed from the reality of how 
most people eat their breakfast. A second approach 
to research is to use a simulation. This can allow the 
researcher to bring in more real world variables but 
still control many of the extraneous variables. For 
example, people could be given only a limited time 
to eat the cereals while simultaneously being given 
other morning tasks to do. Alternatively, the re­
search could be run as a field experiment in which 
people are given the cereal to try at home under 
the normal conditions in which they typically eat 
breakfast. This has the advantage of being more re­
alistic, but it also has the disadvantage of giving the 
researcher less control over extraneous variables.
In addition to these research techniques in which 
the experimenter has some control over the vari­
ables, there are other approaches to studying busi­
ness problems as well. The field study is an exami­
nation of how people behave in the real world. For 
example, if both cereals are already on the market, 
the researcher could observe what type of people 
bought each variety to determine whether the 
brands appealed to families with children or only 
to adults. This could be combined with another re­
search technique called survey research. In survey 
research, subjects are interviewed by a member of 
the research team or asked to fill out a questionnaire 
regarding their preferences, reactions, habits, or 
other questions of interest to the researcher. For ex­
ample, the researcher could ask each person buying 
the new cereal a list of questions such as how often 
they bought that particular variety of cereal, what 
other cereals they had tried before, what they liked 
about this brand, etc. However, although a very thor­
ough interview or survey instrument can be written 
that would hypothetically gather all the data needed 
for the researcher to make decisions about the ce­
reals, such instruments are often more lengthy than 
the potential research subject’s attention span. In ad­
dition, as opposed to the other research techniques, 
surveys and interviews are not based on observation.

Therefore, there is no way to know whether the sub­
ject is telling the truth.
Finally, the analyst does not necessarily have to do 
new research in order to statistically analyze data for 
decision making. Meta analysis and other secondary 
analysis techniques allow researchers to analyze mul­
tiple previous research studies to look for trends 
or general findings. Statistical analysis can also be 
applied to existing data that the business has col­
lected for other purposes or that are publicly avail­
able. Although these approaches do not give the 
researcher control over the way that the data are col­
lected, these approaches often yield interesting re­
sults that can add to the body of knowledge about a 
topic or that can inform business decisions.

Commercial Bank Management
ABSTRACT
Commercial banks have undergone great changes 
during the 20th and early 21st centuries, paralleling 
the ongoing evolution of the new ways in which busi­
ness and commerce are conducted. This paper will 
provide an in-depth analysis of how such institutions 
are managed as well as the role commercial banks 
play in the 21st century economy. By understanding 
the many types of services such institutions offer, the 
reader will glean a better understanding of the vital 
contributions commercial banks provide for today’s 
entrepreneurial environments.
OVERVIEW
Background
On April 18, 1906, the city of San Francisco experi­
enced one of the most significant natural events in its 
storied history as a magnitude 7.8 earthquake violently 
razed much of the city. Amadeo Peter Giannini, who 
only two years earlier had founded the Bank of Italy in 
that city, immediately put on his clothes and rushed a 
horse-drawn produce cart to his bank. Picking through 
the rubble of his fledgling banking institution, he re­
moved and secreted away about $2 million in gold, 
coins and securities. He brought the cart to the North 
Beach docks, where he set up two wooden barrels with 
a plank across them as a makeshift desk. Using the 
money from his leveled bank, he began to offer busi­
nesses credit based on informal agreements, helping 
to bring about the redevelopment of San Francisco.
Giannini’s acts after the great earthquake were 
extraordinary measures taken during extraordinary 
times. However banks have long played a role, albeit 
somewhat understated during “normal” times, in 
the development and redevelopment of businesses 
and economies. Business is, after all, essential to the 
strength of an economic system — it provides jobs, pro­
duces goods and services, and generates tax revenues. 
For these reasons, banks — and in particular, commer­
cial banks — have become the artery by which busi­
nesses receive their lifeblood at their earliest stages.
Commercial banks are also critical for the indi­
vidual. Simple savings accounts, into which people 
have long deposited their personal funds, have ex­
panded explosively into a tremendous range of op­
tions for individuals to see financial security and in­
vestment returns. Still, security is perhaps the most 
invaluable requirement in an individual’s asset man­
agement endeavors, and the protections offered by 
commercial banks are not just anticipated but ex­
pected, as such institutions have long provided the 
most secure of financial management protocols.
A Brief History of Commercial Banks
In the earliest civilizations, those with wealth en­
trusted the storage of their gold and priceless items 
to an institution few dared to pillage, for it was one 
of the most fortified buildings in the city, was con­
stantly crowded and was by reputation protected by 
the most powerful entities known: the gods. In fact, 
the first monetary depository was not a bank, gov­
ernment building or fortress, but a temple, a place 
whose sacredness was often enough of a deterrent for 
any would-be thief.
Of course, during these ancient times, temples 
did little with people’s wealth except store it, where 
it would neither appreciate nor depreciate in value 
nor serve as the basis for any financial transaction. It 
was not until the 18th century BC, when the Code of 
Hammurabi was written, when priests in the temple 
also served as financial managers, administering 
loans and other financial arrangements with the 
people of the community.
Banks have evolved and diversified significantly 
since Hammurabi’s era. People continued to put 
their pay and other personal financial wealth into sav­
ings banks, but others have used land banks to pur­
chase their own real estate and investment banks to

pursue growth via the markets. At the earliest stages 
of the formation of the United States, such diversity 
led a large percentage of the population to seek “one-
stop” banking, creating a strong evolution of the 
commercial bank. Those seeking liquidity in their 
assets simply deposited their funds into a savings ac­
count, but a growing number of businesses and en­
trepreneurs sought loans and mortgages in order 
to strengthen their business position, yet they also 
sought liquidity. While they had the fortune of having 
access to a number of banking institutions, the ma­
jority of the early American banking customers used 
commercial banks, which were increasingly offering 
a wide range of services (Wright, 2001).
By definition, a commercial bank is an institu­
tion that provides banking services for businesses. 
Commercial banks provide savings and checking 
accounts for customers, but they also provide loans, 
lines of credit, foreign exchange and payment and 
transactions (Pritchard, 2009). While commercial 
banks’ primary focus is on the business customer, a 
large percentage of the customers they attract are pri­
vate individuals as well.
The growing use of commercial banks among 
business and individual customers alike has created 
issues for this form of banking. In the early 20th 
century, commercial banking had begun to expand 
into investing as well. Some leaders at the time of 
the Great Depression saw this trend as one of the 
contributions to the collapse of the stock market, 
as commercial banks were providing margin loans, 
underwriting stock purchases and even trading on 
stocks. When the market collapsed in 1929, commer­
cial banks’ attachment to the markets meant that the 
banks would suffer, exacerbating the situation. When 
President Franklin Roosevelt sought to reinvigorate 
the economy, he and his colleagues in Congress in­
troduced the Glass-Steagall Act. Under this law, com­
mercial banks and investment banks were given a de­
finitive divorce, saying that the two should mesh no 
longer, in light of what Roosevelt saw as dangerous 
practices by a type of institution that should have 
been focused on financial security, not gains — a con­
dition that is largely believed to have contributed to 
the epic collapse of Wall Street.
Glass-Steagall was functionally repealed in 1998 
(the law’s formal repeal occurred one year later), 
when investment giant Travelers (who owned 
Salomon Smith Barney) purchased commercial 
banking icon Citicorp. In fact, the failure of three of 
the five largest investment banks during the recession 
that began in 2007 has ignited interest in revisiting 
the pre-Glass-Steagall era (Gross, 2008), when com­
mercial banks were heavily involved in investments.
Commercial banks, which were initially created for 
the purpose of business development and support, 
have become very diverse in terms of the services they 
provide. At the same time, they are increasingly seen 
as more trustworthy institutions for financial security 
than more limited-service banks or larger investment 
banks. It is important to understand how commercial 
banks manage this broad scope of services.
APPLICATIONS
Loans
One of the most important services a commercial 
bank offers is the loan. Lending funds to any cus­
tomer will indubitably help that party in pursuing an 
immediate and critical goal. Commercial banks have 
proven to be important resources for such pursuits.
Commercial lending may be seen in two general 
forms:

 Intermediate-term Loans

 Long-term Financing
Intermediate term loans are an arrangement that 
has a life of between one and three years. Consumers 
use such shorter-term loans in order to finance 
working capital needs, purchase equipment such as 
computers and small machinery, using the hardware 
that is purchased as the basis for the repayment of 
the loan. In long-term financing, monies are issued 
primarily for larger companies (rather than small 
businesses), who use the loan to purchase real estate 
or a facility. In the case of long-term loans, up to 80 
percent of the target asset’s value is typically paid, 
with the remainder of that property’s value serving as 
the collateral (Peavler, 2009).
Loans are one of the most important services a 
bank may offer its customers, particularly when they 
seek funds to support their pursuits of vital assets, 
such as new home, office space, or new inventory and 
equipment. Bank loans, therefore, may be consid­
ered the lifeblood of new and small (as well as large) 
businesses. One of the key individuals at a commer­
cial institution, therefore, is the loan officer, whose

job is to seek out and secure clients for loans. Loan 
officers are also charged with reviewing the client’s 
credit history and assets in order to ensure that the 
client will be able to repay the loan. Furthermore, 
loan officers are expected to pursue delinquent loan 
recipients, assisting them in repayment plans if the 
original terms of the arrangement are not met (US 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009).
The issue that arises when business customers 
demonstrate an inability to repay their loans to a com­
mercial bank underscores an important point about 
the risks of the business of commercial lending. Even 
in times of relative economic stability, the notion of 
lending to new or expanding businesses represents a 
significant risk. If the economy turns sour and busi­
ness falls, the commercial bank also stands to lose 
on repayment of loans. In the recession that began 
in 2007, the number of US commercial bank loans 
dropped more than 1 percent in 2009, a significant 
drop from the previous year. Large banks saw the big­
gest drop, 1.5 percent, at that time (Wagner, 2009). 
This trend exemplifies the risks involved in com­
mercial lending — if the consumer experiences the 
challenges of a faltering economy (or marketplace), 
the commercial bank may be saddled with the debt, 
rendering it not just unable to collect on the single 
loan but unlikely to issue loans to others as freely as 
in previous cases.
Commercial banks have taken the lead on issuing 
loans for all sizes of business as they have increasingly 
among individuals. However, lending is not the only 
commercial banking activity seeing increased atten­
tion in the 21st century economy. Another strength­
ening area falling under the purview of commercial 
banks is investment practices.
Investments
It may be said that one of the major contributing 
factors to the depth and longevity of the Great 
Depression was assumption (Whipps, 2008). There 
were many investment banks in 1929, but most indi­
viduals also had their own personal accounts in com­
mercial banks, which offered them a wide range of 
services. It was assumed that the stock market, which 
had shown great growth previously, would continue 
to grow and deliver returns for investors.
Commercial banks were all too willing to take 
part in the expanding markets. Investment banks, 
after all, were considered too expensive for anyone 
without strong corporate backing or were otherwise 
not wealthy. Commercial banks offered similar ser­
vices, and at far more affordable rates. However, such 
banks failed to monitor the risks involved, and placed 
depositors’ money into what were falsely believed 
to be safe investments. When the markets crashed, 
investors rushed to their banks in the hope of re­
trieving any and all of their monies, but the money 
simply was not there. Thus, the collapse of the coun­
try’s economy was worsened exponentially by the fact 
that consumers did not have any protection from the 
investment practices of the commercial banks.
Lessons of the Great Depression
Glass-Steagall went a long way to separate invest­
ment banking from the traditional services of com­
mercial banks. The law identified the risks involved 
with investments, particularly when such investments 
are made on the basis of a bank’s securities. In 1933, 
one of Roosevelt’s other actions to restore order to 
the finance industry, however, went far to create a 
backing system for banks, known as the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC 
would help prop up the existing banking system, 
which was still lying in ruins, as well as provide future 
banks with protection from similar collapses. Still, 
the establishment of the FDIC would not contradict 
the actions of Glass-Steagall, since the act operated 
under the impression that any “safety nets” offered 
by the federal government would not be expanded 
more than necessary (“Understanding how,” 1998). 
In other words, although the FDIC and other gov­
ernment-initiated protections would be in place to 
insure the bank from failed accounts, such insurance 
did not open the door for future investments by com­
mercial banks.
Since the repeal of Glass-Steagall, however, the 
idea of commercial banks acting in part as invest­
ment banks has captured the attention of observers, 
particularly in the wake of the virtual collapse of 
many of the largest investment banks in the world 
at the start of the 2007 recession. At the end of the 
Great Depression, the fear remained that commer­
cial banks would return to the reckless practice 
of using customer assets to play the often volatile 
market. The Federal Reserve, which is responsible 
for regulation of the financial industry, has imposed 
a myriad of regulations on the investment banking 
industry. With the security created by the FDIC and

the sizable volume of commercial banks’ deposit 
and capital bases, some argue that commercial 
banks may (with the application of the same Federal 
Reserve regulations imposed on investment banks) 
be able to expand once again into Wall Street with 
less risk of collapse than their investment counter­
parts (Berman, 2008).
Then again, the collapse of the investment banking 
industry did not leave the commercial banking in­
dustry unscathed. Bank of America’s purchase of in­
vestment giant Merrill Lynch led to headaches as the 
commercial bank inherited a public relations night­
mare regarding executive bonuses. Executive incen­
tives were later blamed for much of the high-risk 
activity of financial institutions that resulted in the 
global financial crisis in 2008 (DeYoung, Peng & Yan, 
2013). Investment bank Wells Fargo purchased (and 
later absorbed) troubled commercial bank Wachovia 
during the crisis, but came under fire because of its 
mortgage lending practices (Flitter, 2009). Wachovia 
had inherited a “timebomb” of subprime mortgages 
as a result of its own acquistion of Golden West bank, 
but it was not alone in sinking under the burden of 
bad loans (Cole & White, 2012). Large banks had ad­
opted the risky but profitable practice of securitizing 
real estate loans rather than holding them, which re­
sulted in cavalier lending to home buyers who were 
uncreditworthy or unlikely to be able to continue 
making mortgage payments that would “balloon” 
sometime in the life of the mortgage. Small banks de­
parted from their historic model and took on large 
commercial real estate loans. Easy lending drove 
up real estate values and created an unsustainable 
“bubble” that would burst, resulting in mass (and 
massive) defaults (Kyle, 2012). Mortgage Backed 
Securities (MBS) were sold to investors, including 
investment banks. As long as the real estate market 
was rising, investing in MBS and MBS derivatives was 
profitable, but when it crashed these instruments lost 
their value. In 2009, 117 commercial banks failed 
(Armbrister, 2013). Amid the ongoing interest in 
allowing commercial banks to invest once again is a 
vocal counter-argument that suggests a return to sep­
aration between the two types of institutions.
The continuing debate over the expansion of 
commercial bank services, which already include 
a myriad of offerings such as loans, savings and 
checking and money management, to include in­
vestment opportunities is reflective of an important 
point. The shortcomings of a great number of in­
vestment firms that contributed to the ongoing re­
cession highlighted the apparent strength of com­
mercial banks. This strength is based upon the 
popularity of commercial banks among businesses 
and individuals alike, as the large volume of deposits 
bolsters the banks’ assets. Commercial banks, which 
long offered more services than savings and invest­
ment banks, may continue to enjoy the faith of con­
sumers and businesses in stable and troubled econo­
mies alike.
CONCLUSIONS
In 1964, a Chicago Tribune article proclaimed, “David 
Rockefeller, President of Chase Manhattan Bank, 
briefed President [Lyndon] Johnson today on his 
recent meeting with Premier Nikita Khruschev of 
Russia” (www.Liberty-Tree.ca). The event illustrates 
the high regard people have for the institutions they 
charge with the management of their money: Johnson, 
the leader of the free world, would not be the one to 
meet with the leader of the Soviet Union. Instead, the 
head of the one of the largest banks in the world had 
the honor to represent the United States before the 
country’s greatest adversary at the time.
In addition to the basic services commercial banks 
provide, such as deposit, checking and savings pro­
grams, they enable businesses and individuals to gain 
access to funds that may be used to either create, ex­
pand or maintain their corporate operations. During 
recessions, this aspect of commercial bank manage­
ment can be both a challenge, due to the scarcity 
of lending funds, and a great benefit, because the 
generation of business means jobs, tax revenues and 
other business.
Commercial banks were the target of increased 
attention throughout the 20th century and are even 
more so in the 21st century. They have proven invalu­
able for businesses and individuals alike, providing a 
myriad of services that foster business and maintain 
the economy. The people’s faith in commercial banks 
has led to a call for these institutions to expand their 
services to include investing, particularly in light of 
the stability they have due to government regulations 
and a broad base of securities.
How the management of commercial banks con­
tinues to evolve to meet the needs of an ever-changing 
global economy will demonstrate the relevance of

commercial banking in the US and elsewhere. With 
the benefit of precedent, however, the trend of com­
mercial bank expansions into investment arenas of­
fers a strong indication that such practices, proposed 
and current, will continue.

Communications in the Workplace
ABSTRACT
Good communication skills are essential for success in 
virtually any organization. No matter how good one’s 
technical skills or how innovative one’s ideas, if not 
communicated clearly to others, they are irrelevant. 
Employees today need to be able to effectively com­
municate within the organization to each other, their 
bosses, and their subordinates as well outside the or­
ganization to customers or clients and vendors. Clear 
communication that unambiguously conveys one’s 
meaning, however, is not a simple task and can be ham­
pered by numerous barriers including different percep­
tions of a situation, filtering, language, jargon and am­
biguity. In addition, cultural and gender differences can 
compound the process, making communication even 
more difficult. However, through such techniques as ac­
tive listening, disclosure, and feedback, employees can 
learn to become better communicators and improve 
their own effectiveness and that of the organization.
OVERVIEW
I once worked on a project that required me to use 
a technical manual written for Japanese fax repair 
technicians that had been translated very literally 
(and badly) into English. “Imagine,” it started, “two 
giants standing on opposite mountaintops in the 
fog.” The illustration went on to describe a scenario 
in which the giants wished to communicate, but were 
having difficulty because the mountaintops were too 
far away to allow them to be heard by each other and 
the fog obscured their view so they could not signal 
each other. Eventually, the two giants threw boulders 
through the fog in an attempt to attract each other’s 
attention. The story sounds strange and unprofes­
sional to Western ears, but the point is that commu­
nication can be a complex process between sender 
and receiver, and requires that each party is paying 
attention and that the “fog” of distortion is cleared 
away no matter where in the world occurs. Even the 
very strangeness of the story illustrates how cultural 
expectations can color what we anticipate to hear.
Communication is the process of transmitting in­
formation between two or more parties. Although 
communication is often thought of as a verbal 
process, transmissions can also be written or even 
nonverbal; with our actions or body language com­
municating our message. Communication can be 
intentional (the interoffice memo describing a new 
implementation policy) or unintentional (the boss 
receives the message — correct or not — that the em­
ployee is not a hard worker when s/he never gets as­
signments in on time).
Good communication skills are essential for suc­
cess in business. No matter how innovative one’s idea 
is, no matter how skilled the service one offers, no 
matter how much the marketplace needs the product

or service, if the business cannot articulate what it 
can do for potential customers or clients, it will not 
be successful. Good communication skills, however, 
are not only necessary for successful marketing. 
Employees must be able to communicate with each 
other and management must be able to communi­
cate with employees. A boss who expects employees 
to be mind-readers will not be a boss for long. A team 
whose members cannot communicate their ideas to 
each other will not be able to achieve the synergy that 
is the goal of such work groups. The technical expert 
who cannot communicate his/her flash of insight 
will not be able to use it to help the organization. In 
short, communication is key to success not only on an 
organizational level, but on a personal level as well.
A study of entry-level job requirements listed in the 
job advertisements from newspapers in 10 large met­
ropolitan areas found that “interpersonal skills” were 
mentioned most frequently. Even for jobs such as ac­
counting where it would be reasonable to assume that 
mathematical ability was more important than com­
munication skills, it has been found that up to 80% of 
work time is actually spent in communication rather 
than in working with numbers. Despite the impor­
tance of good communication skills in the workplace, 
however, research has found that employees often do 
not possess adequate communication skills for suc­
cess. As a result, 89% of US companies give commu­
nication training to employees in areas such as team 
building; public speaking and presentation skills; in­
terviewing skills; and business and technical writing.
At its simplest, communication starts when the 
sender decides to transmit a message to the receiver. 
S/he decides what message to communicate and how 
best to express this message (words, gestures, body 
language, intonation). This message is then sent to 
the receiver. This person then decodes the message 
and forms the appropriate feedback, be it a nod of 
the head, a smile, or other body language; an action 
such as doing what the sender requested; or forming 
another verbal or nonverbal reply to show that the 
message was understood or not understood. This 
message is then transmitted to the original sender 
who, in turn, receives and decodes the response, and 
forms a return message.
This is a simple enough process. However, com­
munication is more than the sender transmitting a 
message and the receiver responding. There are nu­
merous places during the process where barriers to 
communication can keep the receiver from correctly 
understanding the message sent in the way that the 
sender intended it. When this happens, miscommu­
nication can occur. There are a number of different 
types of barriers to communication that can lead to 
miscommunication by hindering the unambiguous 
transmission and reception of a message between 
parties trying to communicate. Communication bar­
riers include different perceptions of a situation, 
filtering, language, jargon, and ambiguity. Other 
sources of miscommunication include the degree 
to which the vocabulary (professional, technical, or 
general) of the two persons is shared, differences in 
their assumptions and expectations, and their rela­
tive skill at forming and decoding messages.
For example, Harvey may wish to tell George 
that the budget report that he had turned in was ac­
ceptable. So, Harvey forms a message: “Good job.” 
However, George may consider the budget report to 
have been his best work to date or a significant im­
provement over his previous attempts, and is looking 
for more effusive praise. The terse “good job” may 
not carry with it sufficient information to supply 
George with the feedback he is seeking. As a result, 
George may think that Harvey did not appreciate his 
work or that Harvey did not think that George had 
done an outstanding job. Therefore, even though 
Harvey may have been trying to praise George, the 
message that George receives is that the work was nei­
ther extraordinary nor noteworthy. Such a situation 
can result in resentment or discouragement and may 
damage the relationship between the two co-workers.
Everyone comes to a situation with his/her own 
unique perspective, including assumptions and ex­
pectations. This perspective helps determine how an 
individual will react to what the other person says or 
does. For example, in the illustration of Harvey and 
George above, if George has entered the situation 
with the perception that Harvey is less than pleased 
with his previous work, then the off-hand “good work” 
could make him doubt his competence in other areas 
or lower his self-esteem. On the other hand, if his 
perception is that Harvey is pleased with his work 
in general, then the off-hand “good work” could be 
a confirmation even if Harvey was condemning the 
report with faint praise. On a small scale, this could 
cause needless friction in the workplace. However, 
if the miscommunication is between George and a 
customer, it could potentially lead to lost contracts or

hours spent focusing on the wrong thing because an 
off-hand remark was misunderstood.
Different perceptions, however, are not the only 
reason for miscommunication in the workplace. 
Because the nature of workplace communication is 
often more formal than social, communications are 
often filtered to remove unwanted messages. For 
example, the culture in some organizations rewards 
good news but punishes bad news. In such cases, em­
ployees may tell only the good news (“we can put on 
a demonstration for the customer next week”) but 
filters out the bad news (“but only if we get needed 
input from a vendor on time”). Similarly, when deliv­
ering performance feedback, supervisors may try to 
phrase negative feedback in a positive manner in the 
hope that it will be encouraging (“you may want to 
try to make your reports a little longer in the future”) 
rather than giving the employee the entire message 
(“this report had none of the needed information in 
it and is totally unacceptable”). In the first example, 
if the needed input does not come from the vendor, 
not only does the employee look bad for not having 
delivered what was promised, but the supervisor 
looks bad to the customer or executives because the 
needed demonstration was a failure. In the second 
example, the employee’s feelings were not hurt in 
the short-term. However, in the long-term, s/he will 
be left confused and bitter because raises, promo­
tions, or other rewards that were reasonably expected 
on the basis of a perceived positive performance ap­
praisal did not materialize.
To communicate effectively, both parties need to 
speak the same language and use words that clearly 
say what is meant. This does not just mean the dif­
ference between English and German, but the words 
chosen within the same language. One such language 
barrier is the use of jargon. This is any technical 
language, acronyms, specialized language, or other 
words or phrases that are unique — or uniquely 
interpreted — to a given group or organization 
but that are not in wide acceptance outside of that 
group. For example, the following message might 
not make sense to many people:
I’ve kluged a POC for the demo next week, but I need 
to stay down in the weeds so you’ll have to pretty it up for 
the big boys.
However, to an engineer, it means that the 
sender has pulled together (“kluged”) a proof-of-
concept (“POC”) to demonstrate that a theory will 
work. However, the sender of the message needs to 
work on other details (“stay down in the weeds”) so 
the receiver will have to fine-tune it so that it looks vi­
able (“pretty it up”) when shown to the company ex­
ecutives (“big boys”). Although such short hand may 
enable communication between parties who both 
understand the jargon, it prevents communication 
when one or more parties do not.
Similarly, text messaging and other byproducts of 
today’s high tech society have brought with them a 
language all their own. For example, the message “c 
u here @ 445 on 4/5” may mean to meet the sender 
at 4:45 on the 5th of April at his/her office. However, 
unless the organizational culture supports the use of 
such abbreviations, they are best left for less formal, 
social occasions. Using established rules of commu­
nication and grammar, however, apply not only to 
the abbreviations one might use in e-mails, but to any 
written — or oral — communication. One’s profes­
sionalism is judged in part by the way that s/he ex­
presses him/herself. The inability to write a coherent 
sentence using the established rules of English can 
prevent one from advancement within the organiza­
tion or in one’s career. There are social boundaries 
to language and its use. What is an acceptable way to 
speak or write to one’s friend or in a social situation is 
not necessarily acceptable in a business setting.
Another language barrier to communication 
regarding the use of language is ambiguity. For ex­
ample, Harvey asks George if he would like to redo 
the report, it could be taken in several ways: (1) a 
polite response to George’s concern that the re­
port might not be acceptable, but which is assumed 
George will not do, (2) an option that can be taken 
at George’s discretion, or (3) a polite way of telling 
George that the report needs to be redone. If Harvey

is merely making a polite response but George inter­
prets it as a mandate to redo the report, much time is 
wasted. If Harvey is demanding that the report be re­
done but George interprets it as a polite response not 
requiring action, the miscommunication can lead to 
a strained working relationship.
APPLICATIONS
The current trend toward cultural diversity in the 
workplace makes communication an interesting prop­
osition. Each individual comes with his/her own set 
of values, assumptions, and communication styles, 
yet needs to be able to communicate with others who 
have an entirely different set of communication rules. 
Further, the communication pattern that is effective in 
one work group may actually hamper communication 
between groups because of differing jargon or other 
barriers to communication. However, good commu­
nication skills are not only necessary but essential to 
the success of the organization. Fortunately, there are 
methods to improve communication skills both within 
the organization and between the organization and 
other parties so that work gets done more efficiently.
Cross-Cultural & Gender Communications
Culture is defined as the basic shared assumptions, 
beliefs, norms, and values held consciously or un­
consciously by a group of people. In today’s diverse 
workplaces, cultures often collide, causing miscom­
munications as a result of differing assumptions or 
differing ways of expressing oneself. For example, in 
Japan it is considered important that neither party in 
a transaction “lose face.” As a result, communication 
tends to be much more formal and even ritualistic 
than is usually the case in the West. Telling a Japanese 
businessperson negative information in a blunt way 
would be considered a terrible breach of etiquette be­
cause it would cause him/her to lose face. Similarly, 
a Japanese businessperson would be considerate of 
the other person’s feelings even when delivering bad 
news. Therefore, s/he might say that serious consid­
eration would be given to the other person’s idea but 
use body language that — to the knowledgeable ob­
server — would indicate just the opposite.
One does not have to travel half way around the 
world to encounter different communication styles, 
however. Even within a culture, men and women 
frequently (although not universally) have different 
communication styles. While men, for example, 
tend to feel comfortable communicating in larger 
groups, women often prefer one-on-one commu­
nication or small group communication. Men also 
tend to multitask (doing two or more things at once 
such as looking for or even reading a report while 
talking), while women tend to make eye contact and 
focus on only the conversation at hand. Men often 
jump from topic to topic in their conversations, while 
most women prefer to talk about one topic at length. 
Although these may seem like little differences, 
they can cause significant problems. For example, a 
woman in conversation with a man might interpret 
his multitasking as a lack of concern or that he is not 
taking her seriously. If differences in communication 
style are not understood, such misunderstandings 
can lead to serious problems in the workplace.
To help employees become better communica­
tors and better understand the text and subtext of 
the communications between people from different 
cultures, many organizations offer diversity training. 
This type of training is designed to help employees 
deal with persons from different cultures more ef­
fectively by helping them gain an understanding of 
the assumptions, values, and communication styles 
of the people that they may encounter in the work­
place. With this understanding, employees are better 
prepared to be effective communicators in the work­
place and both understand the message of others 
and get their own message across.
Improving Communication
Although good communication can be a complex 
process with many potential barriers that can distort 
the message that one is trying to send, it is also a skill 
that can be learned and improved. In addition to 
diversity training, many organizations offer training 
courses that help employees learn how to improve 
their communication skills with each other as well as 
with customers and clients in order to improve their 
effectiveness and the organization’s success. Such 
skills relate not only to being a better sender of mes­
sages, but also to being a better receiver. There are 
many techniques that can help improve communica­
tion. Two of these are active listening — a way to im­
prove one’s skills as a receiver of messages and com­
munication — and the Johari Window — a model 
used to explain techniques for improving communi­
cation effectiveness.

Communications in the Workplace

Active listening is an approach to improving com­
munication through techniques to help better de­
code the message received from the sender, clarify 
the message, and respond appropriately. To listen 
actively, one must receive and process all the signals 
being transmitted by the sender. This includes not 
only the actual words that are said, but the body lan­
guage and other nonverbal cues that accompany the 
verbal message. For example, if Harvey smiles and 
pats George on the back while telling him that his 
report shows that he is ready for a promotion, the 
message is quite different than if Harvey says that 
same thing with his arms crossed and in a sarcastic 
tone. Active listening skills include receiving and pro­
cessing all the signals that the sender receives. This 
means that the receiver needs to postpone evalua­
tion of what the sender is saying until all the informa­
tion has been received. To further this process, the 
receiver should avoid interrupting, postpone evalu­
ating what the sender says until s/he is finished and 
maintain interest. These skills help the receiver ob­
tain sufficient data to accurately decode the message 
and form appropriate feedback.
After the information has been received, the re­
ceiver needs to evaluate the information s/he has 
received, organize it, and form an appropriate re­
sponse. Part of this process includes showing the 
receiver that s/he has been understood and that 
his/her thoughts and feelings have been taken 
into account. Such displays of empathy are critical 
to showing the sender that both verbal and non­
verbal cues have been received and understood. In 
addition, the receiver needs to organize the infor­
mation that s/he has received. Human beings tend 
to process what they hear over three times faster 
than the average rate of speech. The active listener 
uses this opportunity to organize the information 
received into key points rather than becoming dis­
tracted while the sender completes transmission 
of the message. In complicated communications, 
it can also be helpful to summarize this informa­
tion when the sender is finished to make sure that 
both parties understand the message in the same 
way. Similarly, active listeners take the opportunity 
to clarify any ambiguity in the transmission to avoid 
misunderstandings.
In most communication, each party is both a 
sender and receiver and each needs to be aware of 
the potential barriers to communication and how 
these can be avoided. One approach to helping 
people improve their communication through mu­
tual understanding is called the Johari Window. In 
this model, it is posited that true communication oc­
curs in the “arena”; that area where both the sender 
and receiver strive for open, honest communication. 
This area can be increased through disclosure and 
feedback. Disclosure in the workplace would include 
making sure that all parties to the communication 
understand the assumptions and preconceptions of 
each other. For example, when trying to communi­
cate on a technical matter, it is helpful to know at 
what level to talk to the other person. Two engineers 
talking to each other, for example, would share many 
assumptions and knowledge in common, so could 
use professional jargon and talk at a higher level than 
if one person did not have a technical background. 
Disclosure can also apply to other areas in the per­
son’s life, too.
Feedback is when one party gives the other party 
information about how the communication is re­
ceived. As in active listening, this could include 
information about how well the message was re­
ceived by paraphrasing or summarizing it to make 
sure that it was correctly received. Feedback could 
also include information about the nonverbal por­
tion of the communication: “When you say that in 
that way, I am not sure if you are kidding or not.” 
Such comments — when considerately and em­
pathetically expressed — can help both parties 
better understand both the text and subtext of the 
conversation.
When disclosure and feedback are not used to 
increase the openness of communication, miscom­
munication is more likely to arise. Sometimes this is 
intentional: the hidden area or façade that everyone 
uses from time to time to keep the communication on 
a profession level by not revealing likes and dislikes, 
personal experiences, or other attitudes that are not 
appropriate or relevant to the situation. Increasing 
the area of the arena through feedback also improves 
communication effectiveness by helping the person 
understand things that s/he does not know about 
him/herself (Harvey frequently says “um” while 
giving a presentation, which is distracting to the lis­
tener). The combination of disclosure and feedback 
can also help the person discover more of his/her 
hidden potential; that unknown area that neither 
party understands in isolation.

Information and Communication Technologies
A strong social network has been shown to improve 
employee performance in that a worker who is able 
to seek timely advice from colleagues will benefit 
from a broad knowledge pool. One’s reputation 
within such a network motivates a worker to defend 
perceptions of his/her competence, and feedback 
stimulates innovative problem solving. These dy­
namics have transferred to online social networking. 
Much face-to-face interaction has given way to tech­
nology-based modes of communication. The office 
memo has been almost entirely replaced by email, 
and employees can access forms and policy state­
ments from the company Web site rather than en­
counter someone from human resources. Internal 
“ticketing” systems allow queries to find those best 
able to respond without the query poster having 
to personally track down the right parties. Online 
communications provide documentation of con­
versations, which is more reliable than memory or 
notetaking. Such documentation, however, has also 
been problemmatic for employees who regard their 
conversations as private and do not practice discre­
tion. Companies in litigation may have their email 
records subpoenaed.

Comparative Management
ABSTRACT
Many theorists believe that management style loses 
its effectiveness when applied in a different culture. 
With the increasing trend toward globalization in 
many organizations, therefore, there is a concomi­
tant increase in the study of management practices 
in different countries and how they relate to organi­
zational effectiveness. Cultural norms, assumptions, 
and values need to be understood by a manager who 
desires to be effective in a cross-cultural situation. 
This understanding can be helped through cross-
cultural training for expatriate managers as well as by 
ensuring that the management team in an offshore 
operation includes members who understand the 
local culture and its implications.
OVERVIEW
Practitioners and theorists alike spend significant time 
examining organizations to determine what differenti­
ates those organizations that succeed from those or­
ganizations that fail. Significant time and energy is ex­
pended to determine the best practices and how these 
practices can be generalized or extrapolated to be­
come universal truths that help other organizations to 
succeed. This impetus led to the Industrial Revolution 
and to the development of novel ways to mass produce 
goods. As a result, contemporary businesses are able 
to produce goods more effectively and efficiently than 
ever before. This impetus also led to the Technological 
Revolution with its burst of new technologies and their 
application to both the home and workplace. As a re­
sult, many tiresome or routine tasks have been elimi­
nated, and employees are better supported in the de­
sign and development of even more and better goods 
and services. What such technological innovations 
cannot change, however, is the human factor.
No matter how high tech or automated a contempo­
rary organization is, it still is dependent on the inputs 
and work of human beings. Human beings are nec­
essary not only to run the machines on which a busi­
ness relies, but to design, develop, and repair them. 
Wherever there are human beings in an organization, 
their activities need to be coordinated and supervised 
to optimize their performance and increase the suc­
cess of the organization. Management is the process of 
efficiently and effectively accomplishing work through 
the coordination and supervision of others.
When management first became a recognized field 
of study, the goal was to reduce the empirical observa­
tions of successful practices in isolated cases to simple 
lists of practices a manager should or should not do in 
order to be effective. When these practices were un­
successfully applied in another organization, a new list 
was promulgated. Leadership theories were developed 
that described the differences between successful 
leaders and unsuccessful leaders and posited the char­
acteristics or practices that differentiated between the 
two. However, human behavior is a complex and mul­
tifaceted thing, and it was found that such universal 
truths were apt to be neither universal nor truths.
Eventually, this discrepancy was recognized and 
the study of management became a multidisciplinary 
effort; drawing on the insights from scientific re­
search rather than isolated or casual observation 
and incorporating the insights and practices of other 
fields of study including psychology, sociology, and 
anthropology. Insights gained from empirical re­
search eventually led to the conclusion that there is 
not one best way to lead. Rather, effective manage­
ment requires the consideration of numerous factors

including the nature of the job to be done (routine, 
mechanized vs. creative, artistic), the readiness of 
the workers to do their jobs (experience, degree of 
training), personality and work style of the workers, 
as well as the ability and personality of the manager. 
Further, it was found that as some of these variables 
changed (the workers became more experienced as 
they learned on the job), the most appropriate man­
agement style also changed (experienced workers re­
quire less close supervision than those who are new 
to the job).
The effectiveness of a management style is also 
based on the type of organization in which it is used. 
The large organizations that came into being fol­
lowing the Industrial Revolution were often produc­
tion facilities where a military command and control 
model was effective. Many of today’s organizations, 
on the other hand, do not follow this model. Today, 
more organizations offer services rather than goods 
and the educational levels of employees are rising in 
many fields. Each type of organization and its con­
comitant workers requires a different type of man­
agement in order to be effective. An engineering or­
ganization, for example, where workers are hired to 
develop new ideas or products, cannot be managed 
on a piecework philosophy as can be done in some 
production facilities. Rather, different types of orga­
nizations require different styles of management in 
order to be effective.
The changing landscape of organizations today is 
made even more complex by the increasing global­
ization in many industries. In particular, the practice 
of offshoring — relocating part of an organization’s 
business to another country with lower costs — can 
present significant challenges to an organization as 
it works in a foreign culture with different assump­
tions, practices, and laws. In particular, culture can 
play a significant role in the expectations on man­
agers and the effectiveness of management prac­
tices. Cultural differences also can affect how people 
communicate, what assumptions they make, and 
how they perceive the world in general. For example, 
many cultures — including both Germany and Japan 
— tend to be more formal than US culture. If a man­
ager acts without sensitivity to this fact, s/he can ap­
pear to local workers as rude, and can quickly lose 
effectiveness.
Comparative management is the study of man­
agement practices in different countries and how 
they relate to organizational effectiveness. To do 
this, comparative management theorists look at 
how managerial practices are similar and how they 
differ in order to accommodate the needs of the 
local culture. By looking at management styles and 
techniques that work well in different venues, it is 
possible to gain insight into which management is­
sues are universal and how local culture and condi­
tions require adaptation of management practices. 
Specifically, the field of comparative management 
seeks to help organizations and their managers to 
better understand the impact of local culture — the 
consciously or unconsciously held shared assump­
tions, beliefs, norms, and values held by a group of 
people — on the way that people and processes need 
to be managed.
There are several different theoretical approaches 
to studying comparative management. The socio-
economic approach primarily examines variations in 
economic development between two or more coun­
tries and how these variations affect what constitutes 
effective managerial practice. Unfortunately, this 
approach is not easy to test empirically. In addition, 
this approach cannot account for differences in man­
agement style or effectiveness within a given country 
because it rests in part on the assumption that orga­
nizations operating at the same level of industrializa­
tion would have similar management practices. This 
assumption, however, is not borne out in fact.
Another approach to the study of comparative 
management is the environmental approach. This 
approach emphasizes the external factors — environ­
mental factors and constraints — under which the or­
ganization must operate. As with the socio-economic 
approach, however, the environmental approach 
cannot explain differences between organizations 
operating within the same environment. This is due 
in part because both approaches fail to take into ac­
count the internal factors that can affect managerial 
effectiveness.
On the other end of the spectrum is the behav­
ioral approach which focuses on the psychological 
factors (beliefs, values, attitudes, assumptions) that 
affect individual and group behavior within organi­
zations. Although this approach rectifies the major 
shortcoming of the socio-economic and environ­
mental approaches, it fails to consider the external 
factors that can also affect organizational and mana­
gerial effectiveness.

Comparative Management
Principles of Business: Management
46
To make up for these shortcomings, various eclectic 
models have been proposed that take into consider­
ation both the broad societal issues that affect organi­
zational effectiveness as well as the organizational fac­
tors. Some of these models also consider the possible 
interaction between the two sets of variables.
APPLICATIONS
The comparison of international differences in effec­
tive management is of more than heuristic interest. 
The trend toward globalization spurred on by the 
search for lower personnel and production costs 
means that increasing numbers of organizations are 
offshoring parts of their operations. To be able to do 
this successfully, both executives and managers need 
to understand the differences in culture and how 
these differences affect management styles.
Cross-Cultural Comparisons
Comparative management is an emerging field, and 
models for predicting the success of managers in 
foreign operations are works in progress. However, 
theorists and practitioners have been observing the 
cultural differences and concomitant managerial im­
peratives associated with different cultures for years. 
These observations are not only helping to form 
newer and better models of comparative manage­
ment, but are also providing clues for how to manage 
more effectively in a foreign culture.
One of the reasons that it is important for the man­
ager to understand the culture in which s/he works is 
to better understand what motivates the employees. 
This understanding can help a manager achieve the 
objectives of the organization by being better able to 
reward the employee for desired behavior. Workers 
tend to be motivated by rewards that support their 
cultural patterns. For example, in sub-Saharan 
Africa, cultural values include respect for elders and 
for authority, family orientation (including the ex­
tended family), and collectivism. These traits have 
significant implications for how sub-Saharan Africans 
can most effectively be managed. Although African 
cultures tend to support absolute obedience to au­
thority, the manager cannot count on this alone to 
force local employees into a foreign way of thinking. 
The collectivist nature of the sub-Saharan African 
culture means that local employees tend to be more 
comfortable working in a group than working alone. 
So, the incentive of a private office as a reward for 
high performance may not have the effect expected 
by a Western manager. The family orientation of 
these cultures may help bond work groups together, 
but it may also mean that it is difficult to reach agree­
ment between teams or work groups. Further, mo­
tivating employees to work overtime or to not take 
time off for family obligations may be difficult. Such 
considerations tend to be more important to African 
workers than meeting organizational goals. It is per­
haps for this reason that sub-Saharan African orga­
nizations rarely implement formal performance ap­
praisal systems.
Another cultural pattern affecting sub-Saharan 
African organizations is resistance to change and 
aversion to risk taking. As a result of these patterns, 
managerial insistences on new techniques such as 
reengineering, just-in-time practices, or total quality 
management that are successful in Western organi­
zations are unlikely to be met with enthusiasm or 
success. In fact, the respect for tradition prevalent 
in African cultures may result in a workforce that 
is neither flexible nor easily adaptable. Although 
workers ascribing to these cultural patterns can be 
managed effectively, they are unlikely to respond well 
to American independence or rugged individuality. 
To be effective, managers need to understand these 
cultural values and reward and encourage employees 
within those parameters.
East Asia also has cultural patterns that vary widely 
from those in the West. Chinese culture, for example, 
is also collectivistic in nature and emphasizes social 
interests and downplays personal goals and accom­
plishments. In fact, in China there tends to be an em­
phasis on harmony and conformity that governs all 
interpersonal relations. These cultural patterns can 
result in disagreement with Western management 
styles where conflict is taken as a matter of course. 
In Japan, the organization’s goals are widely shared 
throughout the company, leaving top executives free 
from day-to-day management while middle managers 
carry out both operational and strategic activities. 
Although to the Japanese mind this management ap­
proach is a tribute to the competence of the middle 
managers, to the American mind it is indecisive and 
incompetent. This also means that the Japanese or­
ganizational chart is often little more than a listing of 
job titles rather than a formal definition of roles and 
responsibilities. As in the other cultures described 

Principles of Business: Management
Comparative Management
47
above, Japanese management style also relies heavily 
on consensus resulting from extensive verbal con­
sultation, a concept foreign in most US businesses. 
In addition, cultural norms in Japan do not accept 
the unpleasant face-to-face confrontations that 
Americans frequently think are a normal part of any 
interpersonal relationship. This means that the fa­
çade of the organization as a “happy family” is impor­
tant in Japan. As a result, communication patterns 
rely much more heavily on nonverbal messages so 
that the façade can be maintained. Since an organi­
zation is dependent upon good communication for 
success, it is essential that this fact be recognized for 
a Western manager working in the Japanese culture.
Practical Concerns for Expatriates
Understanding of the cross-cultural considerations 
associated with management in foreign countries 
arises from two sources: the intellectual knowledge 
of cultural and managerial differences and the prac­
tical knowledge of these things that can only be ac­
quired through immersion in the culture. There are 
a number of things that the organization can do on a 
micro level to help make the transition for expatriates 
— employees who are not citizens of the country in 
which they are working — easier. Language training 
alone is insufficient: Expatriates also need to be sensi­
tive to the culture in which they work so that they can 
interpret situations and events in the same way as per­
sons native to the culture in which they take place. 
This will prepare them to make better and more ef­
fective management decisions.
Fortunately, intercultural sensitivity is a learned 
process. Therefore, it is important that the organi­
zation provide cross-cultural training to help orient 
the prospective expatriate manager to the condi­
tions that will be encountered as a manager in the 
foreign operation as well as more general orienta­
tion to the assumptions, values, and norms of the 
local population in general. Cross-cultural training 
programs are designed to help employees deal ef­
fectively with persons from a different culture by 
familiarizing them with various cultural differences 
including values, assumptions, and communica­
tion styles. In this way, cross-cultural training at­
tempts to reduce potential misunderstandings that 
might arise. For example, the unacceptability of di­
rect confrontation in Japan could be inadvertently 
breached by an American not used to this norm. 
Similarly, ignorance of the comparatively high level 
of formality in communication (using formal pro­
nouns and titles for those one does not know well, 
particularly when higher in the organizational hier­
archy) that one encounters in Germany could lead 
not only to misunderstandings, but to a larger in­
ability to be effective in one’s job.
There are several general objectives to most 
cross-cultural training programs. First, potential 
expatriates are taught about the reality of cultural 
differences and how these differences can impact 
managerial effectiveness or other business outcomes. 
Trainees are also familiarized with the process by 
which attitudes and stereotypes — both positive 
and negative — are formed and how such assump­
tions can unconsciously influence how a person in­
teracts with those from a different culture. In addi­
tion, cross-cultural training usually provides specific 
information about the country in which the person 
will work, including any skills needed for business 
success. Cross-cultural training may also include in­
tensive or advanced language skills training or other 
cultural adjustment skills.
In addition to helping expatriate managers ac­
quire an intellectual appreciation for and empathy 
with both the general culture and the managerial 
culture in which they will work, comparative man­
agement theorists have also noted a number of prac­
tical actions that can be taken on an organizational 
level to help increase the managerial effectiveness 
of expatriates working in offshore operations. Many 
of the problems that arise in cross-cultural manage­
ment situations can be resolved simply and do not 
require changes in corporate policy. For example, al­
though it may be tempting to put a person from the 
home country in charge of the foreign subsidiary, it 
is more important that the foreign subsidiary be run 
by someone who understands the needs and assump­
tions of the local culture. This will not only enable 
the subsidiary to better deal with any cultural clashes 
that may occur, but will help prevent them from oc­
curring in the first place. In addition, because of 
the relatively smaller size of offshore operations in 
relation to corporate headquarters, it must be re­
membered that the person in charge of a foreign 
subsidiary will more than likely need to run the en­
tire local operation and will not have the same infra­
structure available as when running a part of a larger 
operation. Top management in foreign operations,

therefore, also needs to have an entrepreneurial 
spirit and the psychological ability to adapt to the 
new culture.
There are other practical steps that can be taken 
to help ensure the effectiveness of expatriates. Due 
to the prevalence of culture shock for expatriate 
employees and their families, many find themselves 
living in enclaves within the larger culture. Although 
this may seem like a good idea, it does not help one 
to understand the new culture better and also tends 
to reinforce an “us-them” attitude that is counterpro­
ductive to being a good manager. In addition, per­
formance appraisal of the expatriate should be done 
by the local supervisor rather than by the corporate 
supervisor. This is because the local supervisor will 
be better able to understand how effective the expa­
triate manager is in working within the norms of the 
new culture and whether or not his/her outcomes 
are within the expected outcomes for that locality.

Conflict Management
ABSTRACT
Conflict frequently arises in the workplace. Goal in­
compatibility between groups or individuals, differ­
entiation, task interdependence, scarce resources, 
ambiguity, and communication problems can all 
lead to a situation that promotes conflict. There are 
a number of conflict management styles that can be 
used to effectively resolve such conflicts: competing, 
collaborating, compromising, avoiding, and accom­
modating. However, although each individual has 
his/her own preferred conflict management style, 
not every style is optimally effective in every conflict 
situation. To maximize the effectiveness of conflict 
management efforts, management and parties to the 
conflict need to be aware of their shortand longterm 
goals and strategies for both the task and the people 
involved, their personal involvement and emotions 
in the conflict, their personal conflict management 
style, and which styles work best in which situations.
OVERVIEW
It often seems as if whenever two or more parties at­
tempt to work together there are at least three opinions. 
Although sometimes this situation can lead to synergy 
and a more creative final product, in many cases it leads 
to conflict. Although the most common view of conflict 
is that it is by its very nature dysfunctional and needs to 
be resolved, in many cases — if it is properly managed 
— it can be both functional and help the conflicting 
parties work together better or to produce a better 
product than if the conflict had not arisen in the first 
place. Conflict between groups may also improve team 
dynamics, cohesiveness, and task orientation. However, 
if the conflict becomes too emotionally charged, a 
winlose mentality can arise, with negative results such as 
groupthink, frustration, job dissatisfaction, and stress.
Very few people have the option to work in com­
plete isolation of others. Even those who telecom­
mute or work independently frequently find them­
selves in a position in which they need to interact 
with others: clients, suppliers, editors, etc. In virtually 
any situation in which there is more than one party 
with interests in the outcome, conflicts are likely to 
arise. In this context, conflict refers to any situation 
“in which one party perceives that its interests are 
being opposed or negatively affected by” the interests 
or actions of another party (McShane & Von Glinow, 
2003). Conflict can manifest in any number of ways 
ranging from a mild disagreement between individ­
uals to an allout war between nations.
In the workplace, conflict typically begins with a sit­
uation that is conducive to conflict, such as the need 
to share a single piece of equipment or other scarce 
resource. For example, Group A needs the copier to 
reproduce a proposal for a tight deadline for a poten­
tial client and Group B needs to use the copier to pro­
duce a deliverable to an equally tight — and incom­
patible — deadline for a current client. As the parties 
come to believe that conflict exists, the situation 
usually next manifests itself in actions that outwardly 
demonstrate that an underlying conflict exists (e.g., a 
member of Group A tries to monopolize the copier so 
that it cannot be used by Group B). Conflict need not 
lead to a dysfunctional workplace, however. Through 
appropriate conflict management techniques — ei­
ther actions taken by one or more parties to the con­
flict or by an objective outside party in the attempt to 
deescalate the conflict — the severity and form of the 
conflict can be altered to maximize its benefits and 
minimize its negative consequences of the situation.

Principles of Business: Management

Types of Workplace Conflict Goal Incompatibility & 
Differentiation
As shown in Figure 1, conflict can arise from any one 
or more general sources in the workplace (McShane 
& Von Glinow, 2003). First, conflict can arise in the 
workplace due to incompatible goals between indi­
viduals or groups. For example, if two individuals are 
competing for the same promotion, it is likely that 
conflict will arise unless more than one position is 
available. Goal incompatibility becomes an even 
stronger source for potential conflict in situations 
in which there are financial rewards for achieving 
one’s goals since, in such situations, employees tend 
to be more motivated to achieve their own goals at 
the expense of others. A second source of conflict 
in organizations is differentiation. This occurs when 
individuals or groups of employees hold divergent 
beliefs and attitudes as a result of their different 
backgrounds, experiences, or training. For example, 
differentiation often leads to conflict situations fol­
lowing business mergers and acquisitions. In such 
situations, the cultures, practices, and shared expe­
riences of the formerly separate entities lead to an 
“usthem” situation.
Interdependence
A third source of potential conflict in organizations 
is task interdependence. This is the degree to which 
individuals or groups must share common inputs, in­
teract during the course of performing their separate 
tasks, or receive outcomes that are partly determined 
by the mutual performance of both parties. There 
are three basic types of task independence:

 Pooled interdependence,

 Sequential interdependence, and

 Reciprocal interdependence
The lowest level of interdependence is pooled 
interdependence. Under this condition, individuals 
or teams work independently of each other except 
for their common reliance on a resource or au­
thority. An example of pooled interdependence is 
the common reliance on a single copy machine, cited 
above. Sequential interdependence is a situation in 
which the output of one person or group becomes 
the direct input for another person or group. This 
situation frequently arises in assemblyline situations 
where the output of one process becomes the input 
to another process (McShane & Von Glinow, 2003). 
For example, the packing department cannot com­
plete its task unless the department that makes the 
boxes or packing materials first completes its task. 
The third type of interdependence in organizations is 
reciprocal interdependence. This is the highest level 
of interdependence and occurs in situations in which 
work outputs are exchanged back and forth among 
individuals or groups. An example of this type of in­
terdependence would be the relationship between 
bus drivers and maintenance crews. The drivers 
cannot drive the buses unless the maintenance crews 
maintain them, and the maintenance crews cannot 
maintain the buses unless the drivers bring them into 
the depot.
Scarce Resources, Ambiguity, Communication
A fourth type of situation that can lead to conflict 
in the workplace occurs when there are scarce re­
sources. For example, if multiple technicians need 
the same laboratory equipment and there is insuf­
ficient equipment for each to have his or her own, 
conflict is likely to arise. Ambiguity in the workplace 
can also lead to conflict because such a situation in­
creases the risk that one party may interfere with the 
achievement of the other party’s goals. Situations of 
ambiguity in the workplace often lead to increased 
office politics. Another problem that can lead to 
conflict in the workplace is the lack of opportunity, 
ability, or motivation to communicate effectively.

When effective communication does not exist, the 
likelihood that stereotypes will develop and conflict 
escalates. Good communication skills are necessary 
in order to communicate with other parties in a dip­
lomatic, nonconfrontational manner. The lack of 
necessary skills for diplomatic communication can 
escalate a conflict situation and result in less motiva­
tion for effective communication in the future. Lack 
of communication skills is a common problem that 
occurs in crosscultural conflicts.
APPLICATIONS
Resolving Conflict
As shown in Figure 2, there are a number of ways to 
deal with conflict (Ruble & Thomas, 1976). Although 
sometimes it is assumed that there is only one best 
way to manage conflict, research has show that one 
conflict management style is best modified to fit the 
needs of the specific situation. These approaches to 
conflict management vary on the degree the party is 
cooperative — or motivated to satisfy the interests of 
the other party in the conflict (e.g., allow the other 
group to use the copier) — and assertive — or moti­
vated to satisfy its own interests (e.g., make sure that 
it is able to use the copier whenever it needs it).
Collaboration
In collaboration, the parties attempt to resolve their 
conflict by finding a mutually beneficial solution 
through problem solving. Collaborative solutions 
are high in both cooperativeness and assertiveness. 
In the collaborative style of conflict management, 
information is shared among the parties to the con­
flict so that all parties can help identify solutions 
that will potentially satisfy the needs or interests of 
all parties. Collaboration is the preferred method 
for conflict management when the parties do not 
have perfectly opposing interests and when there is 
sufficient trust and openness between the parties so 
that information can be shared.
Avoidance
On the opposite side of the conflict management 
style grid is avoidance, an approach that is low in 
both assertiveness and cooperativeness. Avoidance 
is an approach to conflict management in which 
the parties attempt to manage their differences by 
smoothing them over or avoiding or minimizing 
the situations in which conflict might arise. Although 
avoidance is not a functional longterm solution to 
conflict situations, it can be useful in the shortterm 
as a way to temporarily cool down heated disputes 
or for situations where the issue causing conflict is 
trivial. For example, sometimes it is better to leave 
the room and cool off rather than to continue to un­
productively try to resolve conflict. In such situations, 
avoidance can not only prevent a conflict situation 
from escalating, but may actually help it de-escalate.
Competition
A third approach to conflict management is com­
petition. In this approach to conflict management, 
one party attempts to “win” at the other party’s ex­
pense. Competition tends to be a win-lose situation 
characterized by high assertiveness and low coopera­
tiveness. The underlying assumption in such an ap­
proach is that there is a fixed pool of resources from 
which to draw (e.g., hours during which the copier 
can be used) and that a gain on one side means a loss 
on the other side. Competitive solutions to conflict 
situations can be appropriate if the party knows that 
its solution is correct and a quick solution is needed 
or where the other party would take advantage of a 
more cooperative approach.
Figure 2: Interpersonal Conflict Management Styles (Ruble & Thomas, 1976)

Conflict Management
Principles of Business: Management
52
Accommodation
On the opposite side of the grid is the accommoda­
tion style of conflict management, which is low on as­
sertiveness and high on cooperativeness. In this ap­
proach, one party completely gives in to the position 
of the party or acts with little or no attention to its own 
interests. Accommodation can be a functional con­
flict management approach if the opposing party has 
substantially more power or if the issue is not as im­
portant to the first party as it is to the opposing party.
Compromise
Finally, compromise is an approach to conflict man­
agement in which one party attempts to reach a 
middle ground with the opposing party. Compromise 
positions tend to have moderate levels of assertiveness 
and cooperativeness. When attempting to compro­
mise, parties typically look for solutions in which losses 
are offset by equally valued gains. Compromise tends 
to work best in situations in which there is little pos­
sibility of mutual gain through problem solving, both 
parties have equal power, and there are time pressures 
to settle the conflict (Ruble & Thomas, 1976).
Issue
Adapting Styles for Optimal Outcome
Although most people have a preferred conflict man­
agement style, it can be useful to apply a different ap­
proach to managing conflict to better meet the needs 
of each situation. Shetach (2009) expanded on the 
twodimensional model of interpersonal conflict 
management styles and developed a four dimensions 
model (see Figure 3). The model considers four 
critical factors that need to be taken into account in 
managerial attempts to increase the effectiveness of 
their conflict management skills:
1.	 “Northern star,”
2.	 “Conflict evolvement map,”
3.	 Awareness of available response options (see 
Figure 2), and
4.	 Awareness of one’s preferred personal conflict 
management style from among these options.
“Northern star” is Shetach’s metaphor for strategy 
or long-term goal. This term is used to articulate that 
a manager must be aware of both the main goal for 
communication in the current situation as well as the 
longterm, future objectives regarding the working 
relationship. By being aware of both the task at hand 
and the people involved, Shetach posits that it is pos­
sible to increase the likelihood that conflict can be 
constructively managed in order not only to meet a 
specific goal, but also to better manage the situation 
to advance one’s longterm strategy. Further, by de­
fining clear goals both for the task at hand and the 
people involved in the situation, one can better prior­
itize the variables, leading to a more constructive out­
come. In addition to understanding the desired out­
come for the situation, the four dimensions model 
also aims to help managers recognize their level of 
personal involvement in the conflict as well as any 
emotional responses so that these may be controlled 
and the conflict management approach be kept on a 
professional, not personal, level.
The four dimensions model also takes into account 
the various conflict management strategies discussed 
above and shown in Figure 2. Effective conflict man­
agement is often situational, and a manager needs to 
be aware of what options are available for resolving is­
sues. In addition, it is helpful to know one’s preferred 
personal conflict management style from among 
the five available options. Each approach to conflict 
management can lead to either a constructive or de­
structive conclusion, depending on the specifics of 
the situation. In order to maximize the effectiveness 
of conflict management efforts and help arrive at a 
win-win resolution, managers and others involved in 
conflict situations need to be aware of the specifics 
of the situation and their own personal styles, and 
be flexible enough to change their preferred style in 
order to resolve the conflict.
CONCLUSION
Wherever two or more people need to work together, 
share resources, or compete for scarce rewards, con­
flict is almost ensured to arise. There are a number 
of ways to deal with conflict, varying from concern 
about one’s own needs to concern about the needs of 
the other party. Frequently, the desired outcome is a 
winwin situation in which the interests of both parties 
are met. However, depending on the circumstances, 
the best approach to conflict management will strive 
for a different outcome. No matter the approach used, 
however, it is important to realize that conflict situa­
tions can easily become personalized, and the original 
source of conflict forgotten, remaining unresolved. To

avoid this possibility, it is important not only to know 
the various conflict management options available 
and where they are best applied, but also to be aware 
of personal emotions and involvement, as well as short­
term and longterm goals in resolving the conflict.

Corporate Development: Mergers & Acquisitions
ABSTRACT
This article focuses on the corporate development 
practice of mergers and acquisitions. It provides a de­
scription and analysis of the main types of mergers 
and acquisitions including vertical mergers, hori­
zontal mergers, and conglomerate mergers. Antitrust 
regulations, corporate procedures, and government 
guidelines overseeing mergers and acquisitions will 
be addressed. In addition, this article summarizes 
the human resource issues that result from corporate 
mergers and acquisitions.
OVERVIEW
Corporations create growth through organic or inor­
ganic business activities. Growth refers to economic 
expansion as measured by any number of indica­
tors such as increased revenue, staffing, and market 
share. Investors and economists debate the relative 
strengths and weaknesses of organic and inorganic 
business growth. Inorganic and organic business 
growth each move in and out of favor depending on 
the strength of the economy, political environment, 
and government regulations. Organic growth is cre­
ated by expanding existing business resources rather 
than through mergers and acquisitions. Inorganic 
growth is created by corporate development prac­
tices. Corporate development refers to the activities 
that companies undertake to grow through inorganic 
means such as mergers and acquisitions, strategic alli­
ances, and joint ventures.
Mergers and acquisitions are business methods 
that legally unify ownership of corporate assets that 
were formerly subject to separate controls. Mergers 
and acquisitions are considered to be one of the most 
important business tools for achieving competitive 
advantage and growth. In the merger and acquisition

process, one corporation is completely absorbed by 
and into another corporation. The acquiring com­
pany usually maintains its identity and name. Mergers 
and acquisitions vary from corporate consolidation, 
the process through which two corporations join 
and form a wholly new corporation. Mergers and ac­
quisitions were one of the main engines of business 
growth in the 1990s. For example, during the 1990s, 
the telecommunications industry grew from the 
merger and acquisitions activity of large companies 
such as AT & T and British Telecom. In the twenty-
first century, business trends are moving more toward 
organic business growth and away from mergers and 
acquisitions as an engine of growth (Shin, 2005).
In the United States, mergers and acquisitions are 
regulated by the federal government to control anti-
competitive practices. Mergers and acquisitions can 
potentially limit competition in the marketplace, re­
duce output, and raise prices for consumers. As a re­
sult of anti-competitive practices, the federal govern­
ment has developed formal merger and acquisition 
regulations, procedures, and guidelines commonly 
referred to as antitrust regulation or law. Antitrust 
regulations operate to prohibit mergers and acqui­
sitions that have more negative than positive conse­
quences for society. Despite the problems associated 
with anti-competitive practices, mergers and acquisi­
tions, when successful, have the potential to produce 
numerous benefits for business, government, and so­
ciety. Common benefits of successful mergers and ac­
quisitions include more effective management within 
a business organization; optimization of underused 
assets; reduced costs for corporations and consumers; 
improved product quality; and increased output.
The following section provides a description and 
analysis of the main elements of the merger and ac­
quisition process: Choosing growth through mergers 
and acquisitions; types of mergers and acquisitions; 
managing mergers and acquisitions; and merger and 
acquisition regulations, procedures, and guidelines. 
This section will serve as a foundation for later dis­
cussion of human resource management of the prob­
lems that result from mergers and acquisitions.
APPLICATIONS
The merger and acquisition process, across busi­
nesses and industries, shares similar trajectories, 
timelines, 
management 
concerns, 
regulations, 
procedures, and guidelines. The following sections 
discuss these elements and variables of the merger 
and acquisition process.
Choosing Growth through Mergers & Acquisitions
The decision to create growth by merging with or 
acquiring another company is a form of corporate 
development and strategic planning. All successful 
business organizations engage in corporate develop­
ment and strategic planning. Strategic planning, in­
distinguishable from corporate development in most 
instances, refers to the way an organization defines its 
future direction and makes decisions on allocating its 
human and capital resources in a way that will achieve 
these established goals. Corporate development and 
strategic planning require companies to accurately 
predict future needs and potential opportunities so 
to choose the appropriate course of action and time 
frame for growth. Once a corporation chooses its 
growth objective as a development strategy, corpo­
rations must choose the most effective course of ac­
tion to achieve this goal. Corporations that choose 
merger and acquisition as their path or engine for 
growth must make decisions regarding what mode of 
merger or acquisition to choose based on their re­
sources, industry, and goals (Lu, 2006).
Types of Mergers & Acquisitions
There are three main types of mergers and acquisi­
tions: Horizontal merger, vertical merger, and con­
glomerate merger. Horizontal merger refers to the 
business act in which a firm acquires another firm 
in the same industrial and geographical area that 
sells a similar product. Horizontal mergers are a way 
companies eliminate competition. Vertical merger 
refers to the business act in which one firm acquires 
one of their customers or suppliers. Conglomerate 
mergers refer to all non-vertical and non-horizontal 
mergers and acquisitions. Examples of common con­
glomerate mergers and acquisitions include pure 
conglomerate transactions, geographic extension 
mergers, and product-extension mergers.
The nature of the competition between parties 
involved in the potential merger is the main factor 
influencing the choice of merger type. The federal 
government has different concerns about each type 
of merger and acquisition. Areas of concern sur­
rounding horizontal mergers and acquisitions in­
clude the possibility that the merger will eliminate

Principles of Business: Management
56
competition, raise prices, and reduce product output 
and availability. Areas of concern surrounding ver­
tical mergers and acquisitions include the possibility 
that mergers will limit the competitions’ access to 
sources of supply or to customers and impede new 
businesses from entering the market. Areas of con­
cern surrounding conglomerate mergers and acqui­
sitions include the possibility that mergers will transi­
tion a large firm into a dominant firm with a decisive 
competitive advantage and keep other companies 
from successfully entering the market.
Corporations decide what type of merger or acquisi­
tion to pursue based on their resources and objectives. 
Corporations with significant capital resources may 
choose to pursue the purchase of assets. In the pur­
chase of assets scenario, the buyer purchases another 
company’s assets and, in some instances, its debts. 
Corporations may choose to pursue the purchase of 
stock. In the purchase of stock scenario, the buyer 
buys some amount of the seller’s stockholdings and in­
herits the seller’s responsibilities and rights, including 
debt, relative to the amount bought. Corporations 
may choose to pursue a statutory merger. In the statu­
tory merger scenario, the merger allows the merging 
companies to continue existing as one legal entity. 
Ultimately, there are numerous different types of 
mergers and acquisitions that correspond to varying 
business needs and business models (Lu, 2006).
Managing Mergers & Acquisitions
Common problems and issues experienced during 
and after mergers and acquisitions include strategic, 
moral, organizational, legal, financial and human re­
source issues. Mergers and acquisitions, throughout 
their lifecycle from the first proposed idea to post-
merger, require careful oversight and management. 
Corporations are increasingly implementing ongoing 
merger and acquisition policies to guide merger and 
acquisition activities. From 1994 to 1995, the number 
of corporations in the United States with merger 
and acquisition policies in place grew from 35 to 65 
percent. Corporate merger and acquisition policy 
ranges from very simple to very complex. Simple 
corporate merger and acquisition policy generally in­
cludes the mandate that any merger and acquisition 
transaction over a certain dollar amount must go to 
the board of directors for approval. Complex merger 
and acquisition policy may include, for example, 
rules and strategies for strategic plan approval, sale 
of company assets, reporting of inquiries, and for­
mulation of a takeover defense. Corporate develop­
ment officers are generally in charge of developing 
merger and acquisition policy as well as overseeing 
all merger and acquisition proposals. Corporate de­
velopment officers are also increasingly proactive in 
seeking approval from the company’s board before 
undertaking any merger or acquisition regardless of 
scale (Liebs, 1999).
Mergers and acquisitions of all types follow a 
somewhat similar trajectory. Ideally, mergers and ac­
quisitions are implemented over a six to nine month 
period. This period, sufficient to address organiza­
tional issues, includes the following management 
duties: “pick the right people for a dedicated inte­
gration management team; orient employees to the 
new organization and the vision of the future quickly 
and directly; establish a clear sense of urgency to act; 
build an enthusiasm for a successful merger comple­
tion; set clear objectives and hold individuals and 
teams accountable for achieving them; communicate 
clearly, honestly, and frequently; clearly explain deci­
sions once they are made; keep senior management 
on both sides highly visible; and change plans if con­
ditions change” (Walker, 2000).
Regulations, Procedures, & Guidelines for Mergers 
& Acquisitions
In the United States, state governments, with govern­
ment direction, oversee corporate mergers and ac­
quisitions. Antitrust regulation, which is sometimes 
called competition policy, refers to legislation that 
regulates and forbids the consolidation of business 
power into industry monopolies. Although one of 
the benefits of a free-market economy is supposed 
to be competition between businesses, the reality of 
today’s global market is often reduced competition 
due to corporate monopolies. In the United States, 
the electorate supports government regulation of 
mergers and acquisitions.
The procedure for a corporate merger and acquisi­
tion is, on the surface, a simple process. Corporations 
are required, in most states, to submit a plan of 
merger that explicitly describes the names of the 
corporations involved in the merger, any proposed 
change in the name of the acquiring corporation, the 
plan for converting and joining shares of both cor­
porations, and the response of shareholders to the 
proposed merger. If the state and local governments 

Principles of Business: Management
Corporate Development: Mergers & Acquisitions
57
approve the merger, the Secretary of State issues a 
certificate of merger that authorizes and officially 
recognizes the merger. Mergers and acquisitions be­
tween states and countries are often complicated by 
the need to meet the regulations and procedures of 
multiple state or national governments.
For example, in 1997, the companies of Boeing 
and McDonnell Douglas merged into a single com­
pany. The number of major aircraft manufacturers 
was reduced from three (Boeing, Airbus, and 
McDonnell Douglas) to two (Boeing/McDonnell 
Douglas and Airbus). This large merger fell within 
the scope and jurisdiction of the antitrust authori­
ties of several nations, and, as a result, was evaluated 
by both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 
the European Commission (EUC). The FTC ruled 
the merger lawful, but the EUC found the merger 
unlawful and required numerous concessions from 
the merging parties before approving the deal. 
The EUC’s ruling was based on its desire to protect 
Airbus, a European Union-based corporation, which 
is Boeing/McDonnell Douglas’s only real industry 
competition (Gifford, 2000).
Corporate mergers and acquisitions follow gov­
ernment procedures and guidelines established by 
the Federal Trade Commission in 1968, dramatically 
changed in 1982, modified slightly in 1984, and re­
worked and updated in 1992 to reflect the needs of 
business and society. The 1982 and 1992 versions of 
the Merger Guidelines are the most influential on 
current merger and acquisition activity and enforce­
ment. In 1982, the Federal Trade Commission devel­
oped new Merger Guidelines to help corporations 
engage in lawful merger and acquisition activities. 
The Merger Guidelines are not law themselves but 
are the guides that state courts use in determining 
whether or not a merger is lawful. The Merger 
Guidelines are based on the Justice Department’s in­
terpretation of the merger provisions of the Clayton 
Act and the Sherman Act. The Clayton Act (1890) 
and the Sherman Act (1914) are the foundation 
laws of the federal government’s antitrust policy. In 
1992, the Federal Trade Commission joined with the 
Department of Justice to update the merger regula­
tions, now called Horizontal Merger Guidelines, to 
include more focus on horizontal mergers.
The Horizontal Merger Guidelines, as described 
by the Federal Trade Commission, are founded 
on the principle that strict enforcement of merger 
regulations is a critical element of the free enter­
prise system. The federal government argues that 
sound merger enforcements are believed to benefit 
American firms through ensuring free competition 
and the welfare of the American consumer. The main 
goal of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines is to keep 
mergers that adversely affect competition from oc­
curring while allowing competitively neutral mergers 
to happen freely. The Federal Trade Commission and 
the Department of Justice view the 1992 Horizontal 
Merger Guidelines as a framework for the evaluation 
of mergers by the public and private sectors.
Issues
Human Resource Management of the Merger & 
Acquisition Process
The mergers and acquisitions process, across busi­
nesses and industries, shares similar human resource 
problems including human resource management, 
ethical management of the merger and acquisition 
process, and post-merger management. The fol­
lowing sections discuss the human resource prob­
lems and solutions related to the merger and acquisi­
tion process.
Human Resource Management
Successful mergers and acquisitions require careful 
management to ensure that mergers and acquisitions 
are well-conceived, planned, and executed. Human 
resource leaders play a vital role in the merger and 
acquisition process as they function to integrate the 
staff of two distinct businesses. Common human 
resource problems created by mergers and acquisi­
tions include the following: “retirement, pension, 
or other liabilities; executive contracts or other con­
straining compensation arrangements; employee 
relations risks, including union relationships, con­
tracts, and issues; legal actions or compliance issues; 
availability of capable management talent for key 
roles; and employee commitment vital for the re­
tention of talent and sustained high performance” 
(Price, 2000).
Human resource managers work to ensure that 
key talent of both businesses is integrated and re­
tained and that the people-related systems, pro­
cesses, and organization correspond to the new com­
pany’s objectives. Human resource managers assess 
the merger and develop their strategy based on the 
answer to the following questions: “Does the merger 

Corporate Development: Mergers & Acquisitions
Principles of Business: Management
58
make sense? What are the people-related issues? How 
will we integrate and retain talent? How will we inte­
grate cultures and transfer knowledge? How will we 
maintain commitment and performance during the 
merger process? How will we implement the merger 
quickly and effectively?” (Price, 2000, ¶3).
Human resource managers are often respon­
sible for the company-wide merger announcement. 
Managers evaluate and announce assumptions re­
garding potential costs, risks, and benefits. Human 
resource managers will do the following to integrate 
and retain key talent in the new business organiza­
tion: “define the future roles of executives in both 
merger partners; define the management capabili­
ties required for the future success of the business; 
identify the individuals who will be critical and any 
capability gaps that will need to be filled; determine 
the actions required to retain key individuals through 
the merger; and establish ways to share knowledge 
and learn from each other” (Price, 2000).
Choosing managers for the new, merged organiza­
tion is one of the most important post-merger human 
resource decisions. If the merger occurs between 
equal companies, the new company generally in­
cludes management representation from both com­
panies. The management representation decisions in 
acquisitions vary by business (Walker, 2000).
Ethical Management of Personnel during Mergers & 
Acquisitions
Mergers and acquisitions transform the cultures and 
structures of both businesses. As a result of the tran­
sition, the staff of each business may feel stressed, 
angry, disoriented, frustrated, confused, or fright­
ened. Work-related manifestations may include low­
ered productivity, lowered commitment, increased 
dissatisfaction, disloyalty, high-turnover, leadership, 
power struggles, sabotage, and other dysfunctional 
behavior. Mergers and acquisitions have periods of 
waiting, frenzied activity, conflict, and rising ten­
sions. Human resource problems associated with 
merger and acquisition are common. Managers can 
positively influence the integration process. For ex­
ample, managers may strategize to alleviate the dif­
ficulties related to large-scale transformations in­
cluding grief, loss, staff reduction, and termination.
Human resource managers should keep the fol­
lowing ethical principles in mind as they assess and 
plan the new human resources structure: Mergers and 
acquisitions involve multiple parties with separate inter­
ests, agendas, and needs; tensions can often arise from 
miscommunication and obfuscation of information; 
mergers and acquisitions often force people into cer­
tain work situations; grief, loss, and termination man­
agement effect employee attitudes; and managerial 
respect for organizational members as individuals influ­
ences the commitment that organizational members 
feel toward their work and the company (Buono, 1990).
Post-Merger Human Resource Management
The success of mergers and acquisitions, as mea­
sured by profitable and sustainable growth, is sig­
nificantly influenced by post-merger management 
decisions. There are five management skills that are 
associated with successful post-merger business inte­
gration. These skills include: Early action regarding 
financial and physical integration of businesses, re-
engineering of products and processes, valuing and 
reshaping business culture, maintaining valued cus­
tomers, and capitalizing strategic merger options 
such as new markets and new products.
Managers are rarely able to perform an in-depth 
human resources audit before the merger and ac­
quisition. As a result, management is responsible for 
working quickly once the merger is in place to iden­
tify key talent and leaders. Issues include identifying 
key talent, resolving job-overlap, and resolving cul­
ture clash. Ideally, post-merger managers will create 
an explicitly transitional culture and job assignments 
to ease employee stress and upset over organizational 
changes. Management during the post-merger phase 
of the merger or acquisition should focus on key 
areas such as managing organizational stress; estab­
lishing performance criteria; identifying who will stay 
and who will go; creating a new organizational struc­
ture; and assuming the leadership of the emerging 
organization (Corwin, 1991).
CONCLUSION
Mergers and acquisitions are, for some countries, one 
of the most effective corporate development tools or 
tactics. Mergers and acquisitions are a key means of 
fast growth, increased market share, entry into new 
markets, expanded product offerings, strengthened 
supply chain, and optimized cost efficiencies (Walker, 
2000). Companies that reject the quick growth and 
profit of mergers and acquisitions instead embrace

organic growth and alliances. Companies that pri­
oritize organic growth and alliances over mergers 
and acquisitions believe that organic growth is more 
profitable and more sustainable than mergers and 
acquisitions. In addition, financial markets tend to 
favor the stability of organic growth over growth cre­
ated through mergers and acquisitions. Ultimately, 
individual companies planning their corporate de­
velopment prospects must analyze their market, 
their resources, and their objectives and decide what 
tools are most appropriate to help the company grow 
(Dalton, 2006).

Corporate Strategy
ABSTRACT
This paper explores the topic of corporate strategy 
and how it fits within the strategic management pro­
cess. Specifically, we’ll examine the various types of 
corporate strategy, providing a framework to recog­
nize when a given strategy is most appropriate. Also, 
we’ll provide real-life examples of corporate strategy 
in action, along with an overview of corporate port­
folio tools used in corporate strategy formulation.
OVERVIEW
Strategy is defined as “the art of devising or em­
ploying plans or stratagems toward a goal” (Merriam-
Webster online, 2007). Within a broad business 
context, strategy is an integrated set of plans for 
achieving long-term organizational goals. Multi-
unit corporations have three levels of organizational 
strategy: corporate strategy, business strategy, and 
functional strategy. “Corporate strategy concerns 
two different questions: what businesses should the 
company be in and how the corporate office should 
manage the array of business units” (Porter, 1987). 
In a broad sense, corporate strategy establishes the 
overall direction of the firm. Also, corporate strategy 
is a smaller part of a larger and distinct process 
known as the strategic management process, con­
sisting of several interrelated stages, of which cor­
porate strategy development falls within the strategy 
formulation stage. (There are four fundamental 
stages of strategic management: environmental 
scanning, strategy formulation, strategy implemen­
tation, evaluation and control.) Strategy formula­
tion exists on a three-level hierarchy (see Figure 1 
below). Typically, the strategy formulation process 
is an interactive top-down process beginning with 
corporate-level strategy developed by top manage­
ment, followed by the business and functional levels 
of strategy. Yet, depending on the organization, 
managers at the functional and business levels pro­
vide varying degrees of input throughout the entire 
strategy formulation process.
Business Strategy — Once corporate strategies 
are developed, the focus is upon formulating busi­
ness-level strategies. Business strategy is sometimes 
referred to as competitive strategy(Porter, 1980), i.e., 
strategy that gives the firm a competitive advantage. 
Business strategy development occurs within a multi-
unit firm’s divisions and subsidiaries, sometimes re­
ferred to as strategic business units or SBUs. A firm’s 
internal strengths are sources of competitive ad­
vantage and are collectively defined as a firm’s core 
competency. Porter (1985) outlines a set of generic 

Principles of Business: Management

61
business strategies, such as a cost leadership strategy, 
emphasizing low-cost production or distribution of 
products. Also, differentiation strategy may be used, 
which distinguishes company products and services 
on the basis of superior service, quality, unique fea-
tures, etc. Either strategy may opt to target abroad 
market or focus on a narrow market segment.
Functional strategy flows out of an organization’s 
functional departmental areas, developed in further-
ance of the aforementioned corporate and business-
level strategies. Functional area strategies include:

 Operations Strategy — Designing production 
processes that meet customer product/service re-
quirements.

 Financial Strategy — Preparing budgets and se-
curing needed financial resources.

 Marketing Strategy — Identifying customers, cus-
tomer requirements, pricing strategies, promo-
tional methods, and distribution channels.

 Human Resource Strategy — Recruiting, se-
lecting, training, compensating, and organizing 
employees.

 Research & Design Strategy — Creating new prod-
ucts or updating existing products and services.
APPLICATIONS
Corporate strategy responds to a number of ques-
tions related to how a firm intends to compete on 
a broad scale. How will the corporation grow? What 
businesses will the firm compete with? Is growth 
strategy an appropriate option to choose from? If so, 
does the firm possess the financial capability to grow? 
Is the firm’s target market attractive enough to allow 
for growth in their current industry? Must the firm 
look outside of its current industry for growth op-
portunities, and if so, which industries? These are but 
a few of the questions corporate strategy addresses. 
Depending on the answers to these questions, cor-
porate-level strategy is addressed through growth 
strategy or a defensive strategy alignment.
Note that growth strategies may be pursued by 
internal or external means. For example, when 
choosing internal growth mechanisms, a firm de-
velops and markets new products, improves upon 
existing products, or sells existing products to new 
markets. Alternatively, when a firm implements ex-
ternal growth strategies, the firm acquires growth as-
sets outside of the organization.
Growth Strategy
Growth strategy is that strategy employed to grow a 
firm’s profits and lies within two broad categories: 
diversification and concentration (Wheelen and 
Hunger, 2006). Diversification strategy adds prod-
ucts/ services somewhat related or unrelated to the 
firm’s core business. Concentration strategies are 
those growth strategies whereby a firm maintains a 
competitive focus within their particular industry. 
The two types of concentration strategies are vertical 
integration and horizontal integration.
Concentration Strategies
With vertical integration strategy, a firm takes over 
the supply function and/or distribution function 
that was previously handled by outsiders. There are 
several types of vertical integration strategies: for-
ward vertical integration, backward vertical integra-
tion, and full integration.
Forward vertical integration strategy involves a man-
ufacturer assuming the distribution function for their 
product. A failed attempt at forward vertical integra-
tion is personal computer maker Gateway’s attempt to 
distribute PCs through company-owned retail stores. 
This strategy was a failure due to the high overhead 
costs associated with their bricks-and-mortar retail 
stores. Gateway switched to marketing PCs exclusively 
through their website and over the phone.
More successful examples of companies taking 
over the distribution function are found in the fac-
tory outlet shopping mall phenomenon. In effect, 
various manufacturers sell their products directly to 
consumers through company-owned stores — com-
panies such as Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Sketchers, 
Pepperidge Farms, Samsonite, etc. However, unlike 
Gateway, these companies do not rely on forward

vertical integration entirely, as they also rely upon 
third-party retailers for the bulk of their sales. More 
on the degrees of vertical integration shall be dis­
cussed later in the topic.
Backward vertical integration is when a firm as­
sumes the supply function for their respective value 
chain. With increasing global competition and the 
rising costs of commodities, (e.g. copper, rubber, 
aluminum, iron, and oil etc.), a trend shows an in­
creased amount of backward vertical integration 
activity. In order to ensure reliable supply and to 
control costs, manufacturers have been acquiring 
suppliers of critical inputs to their production pro­
cesses. Examples include: Japan tire manufacturer 
Bridgestone’s purchase of an Indonesian rubber 
plantation, and Toyota acquiring a controlling in­
terest in its main supplier of batteries for its hybrid 
vehicles (Gross, 2006).
On the other hand, Bob Evans Farms Inc. has al­
ways relied on a backward vertical integration strategy. 
Best known for offering pork sausage products to the 
retail grocery market, Bob Evans controls the supply 
function of their business by raising and slaughtering 
hogs on company-owned farms, then preparing and 
packaging their park sausage products for sale.
Full integration occurs when a firm takes over the 
entire value chain of supplying the inputs of pro­
duction (i.e., raw materials or component parts), 
manufacturing the product, and distribution of the 
product to the ultimate consumer. Examples of com­
plete vertical integration are oil and gas companies 
such as ExxonMobil, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, 
etc. These fully integrated companies engage in oil 
exploration, extract crude oil with their own drilling 
operations, refine oil into gasoline at company-
owned refineries, and then distribute gasoline prod­
ucts through company-owned gas stations.
Note that vertical integration exists in varying de­
grees along the value chain. The ranges of vertical in­
tegration are: non-integration, quasi-integration, taper 
integration, and full integration (Harrigan, 1984).

 Full Integration (discussed above) is when a man­
ufacturer retains in-house responsibility for its 
supplies and is the sole distributor of its products. 

 Taper Integration occurs when a firm is forward 
or backward vertically integrated, yet relies on out­
side firms for supplying only a portion of produc­
tion inputs or a portion of distribution needs. 

 Quasi-Integration is an arrangement whereby 
a company does not make any supplies or dis­
tribute any of its products, but owns a partial 
interest in a supplier or distributor to guarantee 
access to supplies and distribution channels. For 
example, in a forward quasi-integration arrange­
ment, PepsiCo could purchase a partial equity 
interest in Kroger supermarket chain in order to 
ensure access to Kroger’s distribution network. 
Or in a backward quasi-integration arrangement, 
GM could conceivably acquire a minority equity 
interest in a supplier of automotive electrical 
components. 

 Non-integration involves the use of contractual ar­
rangements, i.e., long-term agreements between 
the firm and its suppliers and/or distributors to 
provide services over a specified time period. With 
this type of arrangement, no ownership transfer 
or exchange of assets occurs. The automotive in­
dustry commonly makes use of such non-integra­
tion arrangements. 

 Horizontal Integration is when a firm acquires a 
competitor in the same industry. Also, horizontal 
integration tends to be the most preferred growth 
strategy for many industries. Mergers and acquisi­
tions are the typical method by which horizontal in­
tegration is achieved (David, 1996). For example, 
the personal computer industry has undergone 
a number of horizontally integrated transactions 
with Gateway Computer’s acquisition of low-cost 
rival e-Machines, and HP’s merger with rival pc-
maker Compaq. Likewise, in the telecommunica­
tions sector, SBC Communications merged with 
AT&T. Automotive industry examples of horizontal 
integration are Ford Motor’s acquisition of Volvo, 
Jaguar, Aston Martin, and Land Rover, as a way of 
quickly moving into a high-end automotive seg­
ment. Other examples include GM’s acquisition of 
Swedish car-maker Saab, and Germany’s Daimler-
Benz acquisition of US-based Chrysler Corp. 
Diversification Strategies
Diversification strategies are of two varieties: concen­
tric diversification and conglomerate diversification.
Concentric diversification is an assortment of re­
lated products in the firm’s portfolio. As one of the 
world’s largest food and beverage companies, PepsiCo 
Inc. represents an example of concentric diversi­
fication 
(http://pepsico.com/PEP%5fCompany/

Principles of Business: Management

63
BrandsCompanies/index.cfm). The company’s re­
lated business units include:

 Frito-Lay snacks

 Pepsi-Cola beverages

 Gatorade sports drinks

 Tropicana juices

 Quaker Foods
On the other hand, conglomerate diversification is a 
collection of unrelated lines of business in the corporate 
portfolio. For example, when many people think of 
General Electric (GE), they automatically think of light 
bulbs or appliances; yet the GE of today is a truly diver­
sified conglomerate, made up of six business units:

 GE Infrastructure consists of aircraft engines, en­
ergy, oil and gas, rail and water process technolo­
gies, and more.

 GE Commercial Finance provides loans, oper­
ating leases, financing programs, commercial In­
surance, and reinsurance products.

 GE Health offers medical imaging and informa­
tion technologies, medical diagnostics, patient 
monitoring systems, performance improvement, 
drug discovery, and biopharmaceutical manufac­
turing technologies.

 GE Industrial includes appliances, lighting and in­
ducts, factory automation systems, etc.

 GE Money offers financial products such as credit 
cards, personal loans, mortgage, and motor solu­
tions.

 NBC Universal is a media and entertainment busi­
ness consisting of news production, movies, theme 
parks etc. (http://www.ge.com/en/company/busi­
nesses/ge_nbc_universal.htm)
Defensive Strategy
Defensive strategies are those strategies used when ex­
periencing financial trouble, indicated by declining 
sales and profits. The need for retrenchment strategy 
may be due to an industry-wide problem (e.g., an un­
attractive industry such as a typewriter company) or a 
firm-specific problem (e.g., poor management, lack of 
financial resources, etc.). With this in mind, there are 
four types of defensive strategies that firms employ: re­
trenchment, divestiture, joint venture, and liquidation 
(David, 1996).
Retrenchment strategy (also known as turnaround 
strategy) involves the imposition of cost reductions, 
with an emphasis on improving the operational ef­
ficiency of the firm. An example of a successful turn­
around effort is Nissan Motors Ltd.
In 1999, after seven straight years of record un­
profitability, Nissan named as its new CEO, Carlos 
Ghosn, an executive vice president from Renault. 
As part of his retrenchment strategy, Ghosn closed 
manufacturing plants in Japan, reduced employee 
headcount by 21,000, cut in half the number of sup­
pliers to around 600, and reduced parts costs by 20 
percent. Under Ghosn’s leadership, Nissan went 
from a $5.5 billion loss in fiscal 2000 to a $2.7 bil­
lion profit in 2001—far exceeding expectations 
(http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/headlines/
vftt%5fghosn.shtml).
Divestiture involves the spin-off of a firm’s busi­
ness units that are unprofitable or do not represent a 
good strategic fit with the firm’s core business. IBM’s 
former desktop personal computer business is a prime 
example. In 2004, IBM sold its personal computer 
business to Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group 
for $1.75 billion. IBM’s rationale for the deal was a 
continuation of IBM’s strategy shift from selling low-
margin hardware products to selling higher-margin 
consulting services, software, and high-end com­
puters. Likewise, IBM viewed the deal as an inroad to 
the vast, fast growing Chinese market for servers and 
technical services (Spooner and Kanellos, 2004).
Joint ventures are temporary partnerships be­
tween two firms, typically utilized when both firms 
wish to capitalize on a mutually beneficial opportu­
nity. Technically speaking, the IBM/Lenovo deal is a 
divesture transaction, yet it also contains elements of 
a joint venture between the two companies, with IBM 
maintaining an 18% equity investment in Lenovo. 
For example, Lenovo has been the preferred sup­
plier of PCs to IBM and was allowed to use the IBM 
brand for five years. Also, IBM has provided mar­
keting support to Lenovo via the IBM corporate sales 
force. From a benefits perspective, the deal rid IBM 
of its personal computer business, while gaining an 
entry point into China for other IBM products and 
services. On the other hand, Lenovo gained access 
to IBM’s extensive corporate customer base, the IBM 
name, and IBM’s marketing expertise (Spooner and 
Kanellos, 2004).

Liquidation — Liquidation involves selling off a 
company’s assets for their tangible net worth and sig­
nals the end of the firm’s existence. This strategy is 
employed when a firm is losing significant amounts 
of money with no prospect of recovery; all other 
retrenchment strategies have been tried, yet were 
either inappropriate, or ended in failure. Generally, 
liquidation occurs as part of a court-ordered bank­
ruptcy sale under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However, a 
firm may undertake a voluntary path to liquidation 
outside of bankruptcy, yet this route is less common. 
Examples of firms forced to liquidate are passenger 
airline carriers Trans World Airlines (TWA) and 
Pan American Airways. Note that Chapter 7 liquida­
tion is not to be confused with a Chapter 11 bank­
ruptcy in which a firm is allowed to reorganize its 
financial affairs in the hopes of remaining an on­
going firm. (For more information on the types of 
corporate bankruptcies, visit the U.S. Security and 
Exchange Commission website at: http://www.sec.
gov/investor/pubs/bankrupt.htm.)
Factors Influencing Corporate Strategy Choice
There are a number of factors influencing the choice 
of corporate strategy (David, 1996):
Forward Integration

 Used when a firm’s present distributors are too 
expensive, or incapable of meeting distribution 
needs;

 The availability of quality distributors is limited in 
number;

 Competing in an industry experiencing high 
market growth; or

 Used if the organization has the capital and capa­
bility to manage the distribution function.
Backward Integration

 Present suppliers are too expensive, unreliable or 
incapable of meeting the firm’s needs;

 Number of suppliers is limited, with many existing 
competitors;

 Industry is experiencing rapid growth;

 Resources are needed quickly; or
 Used if the organization has the capital and capability 
to manage the business of supplying its own parts.
Horizontal Integration

 The industry is a growth industry;

 Increased economies of scale provide competitive 
advantage;

 Used if the organization has the capital and capa­
bility to manage an expanded business; or

 Competitors are failing due to a lack of 
­managerial expertise — expertise your firm pos­
sesses.
Concentric Diversification

 Poor growth prospects exist in the current industry;

 New related products or services would enhance 
the sale of existing products;

 Related products can be offered for sale at com­
petitive prices;

 New products offer a seasonal counterbalance 
against the seasonality of existing products; or

 Current products are in a decline stage of their life 
cycle.
Conglomerate Diversification

 Industry is declining in sales and profits;

 Does the organization have the capital and capa­
bility to manage a diversified business line?;

 Existing markets are saturated;

 An attractive investment exists in an unrelated 
business; or

 Antitrust concerns prevent pursuing companies in 
the same industry.
Also, Porter (1987) identifies three tests for making 
diversification choices that are most likely to create 
shareholder value.
1.	 Attractiveness test — Is the industry attractive or 
capable of being made attractive?
2.	 Cost-of-entry test — Is the cost of entry reasonable 
enough so as not to jeopardize future profits?
3.	Better-off test — Does the parent corporation 
offer competitive advantage to the new unit or 
will the new unit bring a competitive advantage? 
In other words, are meaningful synergies likely 
to result between the new unit and the corpora­
tion?

65
Joint Venture

 The distinctive competencies of the two firms 
complement one another;

 A reduction in risks results from an alliance;

 Appropriate for smaller firms having trouble com­
peting against larger firms; or

 There is a need to get a new technology to market 
quickly.
Retrenchment

 The firm has a weak competitive position;

 The firm is plagued by inefficiency, low profits, or 
stock holder pressure to improve performance;

 The organization has grown so large that an in­
ternal reorganization needs to take place; or

 A distinctive competency exists, yet the firm has 
failed to capitalize on it.
Divestiture

 The retrenchment strategy was a failure;

 A product line or division needs more resources in 
order to compete and survive;

 A division is performing poorly;

 A division is a poor strategic fit with the firm’s 
overall corporate vision; or

 An infusion of cash is needed but can’t be ob­
tained elsewhere.
Liquidation

 Pursued when divestiture and retrenchment have 
failed;

 When bankruptcy is the only alternative—liquida­
tion allows for the orderly sale of assets; or

 Liquidation allows the firm’s stockholders to mini­
mize their losses.
Corporate Portfolio Approaches
As noted previously, “Corporate strategy concerns two 
different questions: what businesses should the com­
pany be in and how the corporate office should manage 
the array of business units” (Porter, 1987). As for man­
aging the array of business units, there are several cor­
porate portfolio approaches. One of the first portfolio 
approaches developed is the BCG (Boston Consulting 
Group) matrix. The BCG matrix is a two-dimensional 
analysis of a business unit’s strength, determined by 
relative market growth rate and relative market share. 
Market growth rate is the annual growth rate in which 
the firm competes, with market share being the firm’s 
market shares relative to all other direct competitors.
1.	 Cash cows are profitable business units with a low 
market share and high growth rate. They should 
be milked for cash, with the cash flow being de­
ployed elsewhere.
2.	 Dogs possess a low market share and low growth 
rate and should be liquidated or divested.
3.	 Question marks are typically found within new 
product areas and have a low market share with 
a high growth rate. Given their high growth rates, 
question marks should be infused with cash to de­
velop them into stars.
4.	 Successful question marks become stars; stars 
have a high growth rate and high market shares, 
hence a growth strategy of integration would be 
employed here (Thompson and Martin, 2005).
The BCG matrix’s simplicity — a recognized 
strength — is also one of its weaknesses. The market 
growth rate dimension (one indication of industry at­
tractiveness) and relative market share (one determi­
nant of competitive advantage) overlook other impor­
tant determinants of profitability. In response to this 
limitation, consulting firm McKinsey and Co. derived 
a more comprehensive model from the BCG Matrix, 
i.e., the GE Business Screen Matrix. The GE matrix, 
developed for GE by Mckinsey, considers a three-di­
mensional analysis of high, medium, and low industry 
attractiveness and competitive position. Industry at­
tractiveness is substituted for BCG’s market growth 
rate, and is comprised of external factors such as entry 
barriers, market growth, industry profitability, market 
size, pricing trends, etc. Competitive position replaces 
BCG’s market share measure, and includes internal 
strengths and weakness factors including market 
share, relative brand strength, management strength, 
profitability, size, etc.(Thompson and Martin, 2005).
CONCLUSION
Corporate strategy does not exist in a vacuum — it 
is a smaller, yet integral part of a larger and distinct 
process known as the strategic management pro­
cess, interrelating with the formulation of a firm’s 

Corporate Strategy
Principles of Business: Management
66
business strategy, as well as its functional strategy. Is 
there one best corporate strategy? The answer is an 
unequivocal no — there is no single best corporate 
strategy. Likewise, the process of developing cor­
porate strategy has become a more daunting task 
in light of the global competitive forces firms must 
confront. Corporate strategy is dependent on nu­
merous factors as outlined with respect to industry 
attractiveness and the relative competitive strengths 
of the respective company. Once again, the fact that 
corporations operate in a global environment greatly 
complicates the formulation and coordination of 
corporate strategy. Hence, the formulation of corpo­
rate strategy is a dynamic, interactive, iterative pro­
cess, sometimes requiring midstream adjustments as 
a result of unexpected changes in the firm’s competi­
tive environment. Therefore, the wrong corporate 
strategy choices, in addition to improper implemen­
tation, can mean the difference between success and 
failure.

Crisis Management
ABSTRACT
This article examines the factors that influence a 
manager’s determination of an event or situation as 
a crisis. Various strategies of responding to a crisis are 
explained along with factors that may influence the 
strategy chosen to ameliorate a crisis situation. The 
methods that companies use to prepare for future 
crises are also reviewed. Several past business crises 
and the scope of those crises are reviewed. The se­
lection and execution of crisis response strategies to 
a recall prompted by Salmonella Typhimurium are 
examined along with specific actions that several 
companies in the food industry took in response to 
the situation. The role of United States Government 
agencies in the recall process is also explained.
OVERVIEW
The term “crisis” is used to describe a wide variety of 
events and circumstances. However, what comprises a 
crisis, or when a company decides that they are experi­
encing a crisis, is dependent on a number of variables.

 First, to what extent are there internal capabilities 
in place to deal with an event or situation that is 
disrupting business?

 Second, what is the magnitude of the event and 
what are the consequences of not successfully han­
dling the crisis?

 Third, to what extent does the event affect other 
businesses, the surrounding community, or even 
the country where the company is located?
In an ideal world a company would be able to pre­
dict and be prepared for every possible event and 
thus minimize the perception that the event had 
turned into a crisis (Klein, 2007). The larger the 
company and the more experience that corporate 
staff have in handling a specific type of event, the less 
likely it is that the event will be considered a crisis. In 
a situation involving a product recall, for example, 
some companies have considerable experience and 
probably have staff in place to deal with the recall. 
This is the case in the automobile industry, where 
products are recalled frequently. On the other hand, 
in a small company with limited staff, or in one that 
has never faced a recall of its products, the event may 
become a crisis.
Identifying & Predicting Crisis Situations
If the magnitude of the event is small and limited 
to one location or one product, or if that event has 
little if any impact on day-to-day operations, it is 
likely the event will not be viewed as a crisis. If the 
event is wide in scope and devastates operational ca­
pability, the event may be viewed as a crisis. In ad­
dition, if the negative consequences of not success­
fully handling the crisis are minimal, then the event 
will not turn into a crisis. But if the consequences of 
failing to properly handle an event are extensive, it 
will likely be treated as a crisis (“Top managers lack 
confidence,” 2009).
The geographical scope of an event or the eco­
nomic scope of an event may also influence whether 
or not managers in a particular company will con­
sider the event a crisis. A natural disaster that affects 
several counties or states, for example, may be seen 
as a disruption but not particularly as a crisis. In such 
events, federal, state, or local response deals with 
many of the consequences of the event. There is also 
most likely some sort of insurance coverage in place 
to aid in the recovery.

Crisis Management
Principles of Business: Management
68
If the event affects only one company, or the supply 
chain in which the company operates, managers may 
consider the event a crisis. In other words, the more 
the consequences of the event fall singularly on a 
specific company or industry, the more likely it is 
that the event will be viewed as a crisis (Freda, Arn & 
Gatlin-Watts, 1999).
In case of the 2008 economic downturn, the col­
lapse of the mortgage industry was viewed as a crisis, 
which in turn affected the banking industry in gen­
eral and many corporations that were dependent on 
the availability of affected monies (Verma, 2009). 
However, it could be argued that the media and poli­
ticians who continuously emphasized that the events 
as a crisis contributed to the effects of the downturn 
(Levinson, 2009). In this vein, the identification of 
the downturn as a crisis could be seen as strategic, as 
it allowed Congress to be persuaded into action and 
also presented certain opportunities to savvy busi­
nesses (Garmhausen, 2009) (Maddock & Vitn, 2009).
Strategy Creation & Execution
Once a company has decided that an event is a crisis, 
a strategy must be executed to minimize the affect 
of the crisis. One of the first desires that corporate 
managers have is to control the damage to company 
operations, reputation, business relationships, and, 
in some cases, stock prices. This requires the ability 
to rapidly organize efforts and mobilize the right 
people for the job (Miller, 2006). Above all, speed is 
of the essence and the chief executive officer (CEO) 
should play a key role (Kimes, 2009).
If operations are disrupted it is important to re­
store normal functioning as quickly as possible and 
remedy any defects that may be related to the cur­
rent crisis. But the work is not finished there. During 
this time, a focus on reputation management, also 
known as image repair, may have more overall im­
portance and value than an organization’s functions. 
The CEO, with support from the crisis management 
team, is a key player in this part of the crisis drama. 
Much of the world outside the walls of the company 
views the CEO as the chief communicator for a com­
pany. In addition, the CEO’s reputation is also on the 
line (Gaines-Ross, 2009).
Corporate Crisis Examples
There have been long lists of companies that have 
each faced rather severe crises. In 1984, in Bhopal, 
India, a Union Carbide chemical plant spewed pol­
lution into the local community and caused a di­
saster for which the company has suffered conse­
quences ever since (Haseley, 2004). In 1980, Proctor 
and Gamble introduced the Rely Super-Absorbent 
Tampon, which was later linked to hundreds of cases 
of toxic shock syndrome and numerous lawsuits 
(Weinberger & Romeo, 1989).
The Ford Motor Company suffered embarrassment 
as well as a class action lawsuit over the Ford Pinto, a 
small compact car introduced in the 1970s that had 
a tendency to burst into flames if hit from the rear 
(Weinberger & Romeo, 1989). In the late 1970s, the 
Firestone 500 series tires were blowing out and coming 
apart as people drove in their cars, which resulted in 
deaths and lawsuits (Gatewood & Carroll, 1981).
One of the most dramatic crises to ever befall an or­
ganization was the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion, 
which happened on January 28, 1986, just after lift-off. 
It was also televised around the world and especially in 
the classrooms of public schools in the United States. 
Among its crew was a schoolteacher, to be the first 
teacher in space. As Challenger exploded, millions of 
children were traumatized, the education community 
was outraged, parents were horrified, and politicians 
held their banners of anger high. NASA managers 
were tried and then convicted (Watson, 2006).
Another major crisis for a corporation, and the 
environment, was the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill 
involving British Petroleum (Valvi & Fragkos, 2013). 
In response to the spill, BP set up a $20 billion trust 
to settle claims against the company (King, 2010).
Application
Crisis Management in Product Recall Situations
During the industrial revolution, innovation and busi­
ness soared at a rapid rate, and there was little govern­
ment intervention as to the quality and safety of the 
products that manufacturers were sending to market. 
After World War II this started to change. Federal 
authority to ensure the safety of consumer products, 
food and drugs, and transportation products was ex­
panded. New laws were passed, federal agencies were 
created, and the age of product recalls began.
The expansion of regulations and the growth of 
government oversight have certainly benefited the 
consumer. From a business perspective, this oversight 
and resulting recalls have caused a long list of dra­
matic organizational crises.

Government Agencies Executing Recalls
The United States Consumer Product Safety 
Commission
The United States Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC) is the federal agency respon­
sible for ensuring the safety of consumer products, 
including toys, baby accessories, electrical tools and 
appliances, household chemicals, and over 15,000 
other products (CPSC, 2009). The CPSC was cre­
ated in 1972 when the Consumer Product Safety Act 
became law. The CPSC issues hundreds of recalls 
every year and has prevented and removed hundreds 
of millions of items from the market in the United 
States (CPSC, 2003).
The United States Food and Drug Administration
The United States Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) has jurisdiction over most food products, 
human and animal drugs, therapeutic agents of bio­
logical origin, medical devices, radiation-emitting 
products, cosmetics, and animal feed. The scope of 
the FDA’s monitoring activities is huge; covering over 
$1 trillion worth of products annually and involving 
not only manufacturing but also import, transport, 
and storage. The agency traces its roots back to 1862 
as a division of the United States Department of 
Agriculture. In 1980, the FDA was moved to the newly 
formed United States Department of Health and 
Human Services where it took on its current role and 
structure (FDA, 1998).
The FDA has executed over 3,200 food product 
recalls since 1980, of which about twenty five per­
cent were Class I recalls (recalls on products that 
pose a reasonable probability of causing serious ad­
verse health consequences or death if eaten). There 
have also been hundreds of drug recalls resulting in 
some drugs being removed from the market perma­
nently (United StatesGovernment Accountability 
Office, 2000). In some cases, when the FDA does not 
feel that companies with recalled products are re­
sponding appropriately or with due urgency, it will 
send United States Marshals to confiscation products 
(Weise, 2008).
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) manages safety recalls involving motor ve­
hicles and motor vehicle equipment. Manufacturers 
can execute a voluntary recall or a recall can be 
ordered by the NHTSA. There have been thousands 
of recalls in the last several decades; while some re­
calls were very serious, the majority involved relatively 
non-life-threatening defects. The manufacturer is re­
quired to file a public report describing the safety-re­
lated defect or noncompliance with a federal motor 
vehicle safety standard. NHTSA monitors every safety 
recall, and the law requires that manufacturers pro­
vide safe, free, and effective remedies. Manufacturers 
are also required to attempt to notify owners of re­
called products (NHTSA, 2009).
Product Recalls & Business Crisis Management
A product recall can be a serious crisis for many busi­
nesses, especially smaller to mid-sized companies 
without in-house legal counsel or other staff that 
have experience in dealing with recalls. Many ad­
visers suggest immediate and straightforward action 
and note that an off-the-shelf response plan may not 
be the answer to the crisis (Dezenhall, 2009).
There are numerous strategies that a company 
can take. They can be defensive or they can have a 
problem-solving orientation. They can communicate 
openly or they can communicate very little or not at 
all to the public and their customers (Falkheimer & 
Heide, 2006) (Huang & Su, 2009).
The Peanut Corporation of America Salmonella Scare
The recalls of the last several years created rather 
serious business crises involving food products. In 
terms of analyzing a business crisis, these recalls are 
interesting because the products involved were part 
of a complex and lengthy supply chain. Fortunately, 
the supply chain management systems were useful in 
helping to mitigate damage.
Much to the surprise of many, an American staple, 
peanut butter, was at the center of one of the largest, 
most widespread food recalls in history. Because of 
its use in the production of numerous other food 
products, the complexity and costs of the recall were 
multiplied across the industry. Over 2,500 products 
were recalled and the tainted products resulted in 
hundreds of illnesses and perhaps several deaths. 
The products all had ingredients manufactured by 
the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) and were 
tainted with Salmonella typhimurium (Cook, 2009) 
(Schmit &Weise, 2009).
PCA voluntarily ceased operations in February and 
soon filed for bankruptcy. A criminal investigation by

the United States Justice Department had been filed 
on January 30. Four years later, in February 2013, 
four former company officials were indicted on 75 
counts including obstruction of justice and intro­
ducing adulterated food into interstate commerce 
(Tavernise, 2013). One of the PCA products, peanut 
paste, is commonly found in cookies, crackers, ce­
real, candy, ice cream, and pet treats, among hun­
dreds of other types of food products (Cook, 2009). 
On February 20, 2009, PCA issued a statement indi­
cating it had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and that 
it was no longer able to communicate with customers 
regarding recalled products (FDA, 2009).
Not only was the PCA in a business crisis, but 
other manufacturers that used PCA products were 
also thrown into the crisis. In addition, restaurants, 
school districts, nursing homes, and probably even 
the military had to deal with examining over 2,500 
products and dispose of any that had hit the recall 
list. Thus the PCA crisis spilled out of the corporation 
and into the supply chain, into the wholesalers and 
retailers selling any of the 2,500 products, and down 
to the home and the mouth of the food consumer.
While the occurrence of situations that pose a 
threat to a business are somewhat inevitable, the way 
the situation is handled can mean the difference be­
tween a career-ending crisis and future success. As 
the Salmonella outbreak unfolded, there was a con­
gressional hearing about the contamination and the 
conduct of PCA. The House subcommittee wanted 
the president of PCA, Stewart Parnell, and the 
Blakely, Georgia, plant manager to testify. By refusing 
to do so, the PCA set a tone of noncompliance and 
portrayed a lack of concern for the situation. This, 
in addition to internal emails deemed unfavorable 
to the PCA, placed the association in a bad position 
(Schmit, 2009, Feb. 12).
The companies that used peanut products in their 
manufacturing process started weighing in publicly 
and quickly. Perry’s Ice Cream initiated a voluntary 
recall of select products containing peanut butter 
that could have been contaminated with Salmonella. 
Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream announced that neither the 
company nor its suppliers bought ingredients from 
PCA (“Processors respond,” 2009). Unilever pub­
licly stated that it did not use PCA products to make 
Skippy Peanut Butter, Slim-Fast shakes or bars, or its 
ice-cream products: Breyers, Good Humor, Klondike, 
Popsicle, and Ben & Jerry’s (Angrisani, 2009).
Kellogg’s made public that it recalled several 
snack products that ended up costing the company 
between $65 and $75 million (Schmit, 2009, Feb. 6). 
Kellogg’s was strongly criticized during the House 
subcommittee hearings but has stated that it will now 
do its own audits on those suppliers making products 
most vulnerable to bacterial contamination. Nestle 
officials contended that they had chosen not to use 
PCA products (Weise & Schmit, 2009).
Retailers Dorothy Lane Market and Costco made 
public that they had removed products from their 
stores and notified their customers using personal 
phone calls, letters, and automated calls (Gallagher, 
2009). Wegmans Food Markets made public that 
it had contacted each of its suppliers to determine 
where ingredients came from and examined its 
private-label products, removing from shelves those 
products that were potentially contaminated. United 
Supermarkets published an online list of food prod­
ucts it removed from shelves (Angrisani, 2009). 
Food Lion and Walmart moved quickly and publicly 
discussed their quality control programs and the re­
quirements they set for suppliers for food safety and 
testing (Garry, 2009).
This sole crisis example illustrates the wide range 
of responses that companies can assume during a 
product recall crisis. Retailers were quick to execute 
a plan and hope that the plan would be viewed posi­
tively by their customers. Food producers that used 
PCA products also moved quickly, but not all of them 
will escape further scrutiny for not have better quality 
control procedures in place. PCA, on the other hand, 
chose to be silent and to fold the company.
Issue
Can a Company Really be Prepared for a Business 
Crisis?
There are three obvious paths that companies can 
take to plan for a potential business crisis. Each has 
its benefits and each has its drawbacks. Business man­
agers sometimes consciously choose their path while 
others sort of muddle through. Some companies do 
nothing and survive, others do nothing and perish.
Plan Making
Some companies plan and plan. They make plans. 
Then they make more plans. There are strategic 
plans, growth plans, marketing plans, business 
continuity plans, disaster recovery plans, general 

Principles of Business: Management

71
emergency plans, succession plans, and dozens of 
others. In many instances those plans serve compa­
nies very well—especially when these plans have a 
strong communication aspect built into them (Cagle, 
2006).
One clear criticism of the process of making plans 
is that once plans are designed, documented, and 
bound, they often are put upon a shelf, where they 
age and become outdated. Staff come and go, and 
many new staff members do not even know the plans 
exist or where they are kept (Greek, 1998). The old 
plans may have misinformation and may not address 
updated legal requirements.
Team Making
Instead of making plans, some companies train and 
develop staff that can respond to a variety of situa­
tions with a consistent corporate philosophy and a 
coordinated course of action. This requires devel­
oping individuals as well as teams. It also requires 
staff knowledge of the company, the industry in 
which it exists, and the potential threats within the 
industry environment. In the PCA contamination 
case, it was clear that some of the proactive businesses 
had dealt with recalls and health issues in the past 
and knew how to mobilize their resources (Angrisani, 
2009) (Gallagher, 2009) (Garry, 2009).
Risk Analysis
One method of selecting crisis action guidelines is to 
perform a sound risk analysis. To do so requires good 
research, thorough analysis, and above all, realistic 
and clear thinking. As research is best accomplished 
when bias is minimized and analysis is best accom­
plished when the researcher has not yet decided the 
answer they are seeking, realistic and clear thinking 
are the elements most necessary in conducting a 
sound risk analysis (McConnell & Drennan, 2006).
Many of the companies in the supply chain in the 
PCA case were realistic. They came to grips with the 
fact that Salmonella was indeed a risk in the food 
business. The staff in the companies may even have 
had to respond to contamination situations in the 
past. The evidence was there for viewing; there had 
been numerous contamination cases since the early 
2000s. In 2005 and 2006, for example, there were 
four large multistate outbreaks of Salmonella infec­
tions resulting from the consumption of raw toma­
toes, mostly in restaurants (Bidol et al., 2007). Cases 
span the last decade with some being localized and 
others being rather widespread (“Salmonella out­
break,” 1999)
CONCLUSION
What type of event or circumstance constitutes a 
crisis will vary from company to company. What may 
be routine business operations for some companies 
may be a serious crisis for others. Both the percep­
tion of events and experience in dealing with events 
influence the evolution of a crisis.
If a crisis is in fact recognized, it is important to 
mobilize resources promptly in order to effectively 
control the damage. Necessary resources include ex­
perienced staff as well as outside assistance, if neces­
sary. The CEO should be the leading spokesperson 
for the company when dealing with the media and 
the public. This shows that the company is serious 
about its efforts to address the crisis and can remedy 
any problems that may have caused the crisis.
As the government started regulating industries 
more strictly and setting standards for products and 
processes, more companies found themselves in the 
public spotlight because of product recalls for defects 
or safety issues. Regulations and standards now cover 
virtually every consumer product on the market in 
the United States. The government also works to 
keep unsafe products from entering ports in the 
United States, and officials confiscate and destroy 
millions of pounds of items every year.
The process of planning and preparing for fu­
ture crisis can be complex and expensive. Planning 
certainly helps some companies, but plans are often 
shelved and become outdated and ineffective. Having 
well- trained staff with experience in crisis manage­
ment and effective communication skills can help 
minimize the impact of a wide range of crisis situations.

Critical Thinking in the Management of Technology
ABSTRACT
Managing technology requires the ability to think 
critically. Besides managing technology assets and 
human resources, managers of technology must 
guide organizations and staff in identifying prob­
lems, designing solutions, evaluation of solutions 
and solution providers, implementing selected solu­
tions and closely monitoring results at each juncture. 
Technology managers can augment technical skills 
by implementing critical thinking strategies. Critical 
thinking supports solving complex and unstructured 
problems. Critical thinking strategies are character­
ized by taking an active approach to planning and 
executing problem solving. Using critical thinking 
helps technology managers adapt to the changing de­
mands of the technology itself and the environment 
that must support it. Critical thinking can be devel­
oped and is often developed through experience. 
Meanwhile, there have been changes in the existing 
standards for technology education to place emphasis 
on teaching critical thinking skills. Educational insti­
tutions have come to the realization that technology 
management no longer depends primarily on tech­
nical skills but requires other skills that extend beyond 
simple knowledge. The inability to apply knowledge 
in a critical and timely fashion can lead to undesirable 
results in the real world. In other disciplines, there is 
disagreement as to whether or not critical thinking 
has a common definition or can be effectively taught.
OVERVIEW
Critical thinking is a way of conducting mental pro­
cesses in order to “decide what to believe or do” 
(Schafersman, 1991). Technology managers are likely 
to have many inputs into decision making. Technical 
staff, business oriented operational staff and peer 
managers are just a few of the internal sources of input. 
Technology vendors, competitors, government regu­
lators and customers are other groups influencing 
and providing input to technology decisions made by 
managers. Skillful technology managers must balance 
competing and critical inputs to decision making. At 
times there will be the luxury of making decisions and 
having ample time, resources and information to do 
so. In other cases, technology management decisions 
are based on unforseen problems, product, service or 
system failures and other undesirable events.
The focus of critical thinking is on evaluating suc­
cessful alternatives for action. Thinking critically is 
also an automatic filter that can prioritize activity in a 
changing environment. Critical thinking allows pro­
fessionals to manage daily challenges by methodically 
yet creatively solving problems. Penn State University 
(2004) considers critical thinking an essential com­
petency for students. Penn State’s curricular guide 
defines critical thinking as:
“a term used to refer to those kinds of mental ac­
tivity that are clear, precise, and purposeful. It is typi­
cally associated with solving complex real world prob­
lems, generating multiple (or creative) solutions to a 
problem, drawing inferences, synthesizing and inte­
grating information, distinguishing between fact and 
opinion, or estimating potential outcomes, but it can 
also refer to the process of evaluating the quality of 
one’s own thinking.”
Technology managers must check their own 
thinking because of the risk of bias or personal pref­
erence influencing decisions. Riddell (2001, p. 121) 
suggests that critical thinking requires getting away 
from “programmed ways of thinking.” Programmed 
thinking can come from personal beliefs, experi­
ences, stereotypical thoughts and even assumptions 
made about the way decisions will be received within 
an organization or by other key decision-makers. The 
management of technology may require creative and 
multiple solutions because outcomes may be difficult 
or impossible to predict yet return on investment 
must be assured. Some technology implementa­
tions are based on unrealistic timelines or costs due 
to the problems with predicting results. The world 
of technology is fraught with the constant trend to­
ward obsolescence with the advent of many new tech­
nologies every day that threaten the stability of any 
current technology infrastructure. Decision making 
regarding technology standards may be challenging 
to managers because there are no guarantees the 
standards will infinitely support organizational goals. 
It is also a possibility that staying with standards too 
long will not guarantee a migration path to new or re­
quired technology. Decisions that are not in the best

interest of an organization may not manifest them­
selves until later when it is discovered that the deci­
sion can become more costly over time.
Many managers and professionals may possess a 
large amount of knowledge and skill but the appli­
cation of that skill within the context of a specific 
problem or scenario is not necessarily automatic. 
If problems are simple, concise and unchanging, a 
manager may have little trouble handling the issue 
or even handing it off to other less experienced 
personnel. However, in the real world, problems 
are seldom of scope or nature where simple knowl­
edge alone will facilitate coordination of a solution. 
In technology, it is quite likely that the problems a 
manager will face may be beyond the experience of 
the manager or technical staff no matter the level of 
experience or training. One such problem is that of 
interoperability. Managing technology calls for man­
aging different products and solutions from various 
vendors that may or may not easily operate together 
without some or even significant customization or 
adjustment. Once customization patching is done, 
it may have to be done and updated on a continual 
basis. Managing these updates may make the solution 
more costly than the organization can afford.
Technology tends to change quite often for many 
different reasons. Some technology change is the re­
sult of new capabilities being available such as higher 
capacity storage devices or greater functionality in 
software. Technology changes can also be due to 
vendors adopting new standards, merging technolo­
gies with other vendors or otherwise changing the 
direction of research and development. The speed 
of change in technology is not easy to predict nor is 
the direction of change. It is very possible that man­
agers of technology may have to manage technology 
change without having access to internal resources 
to support these efforts. In this case, managers have 
to consider how to complete projects using external 
resources such as consultants and systems integrators 
or outsourced staff, assets, networks or facilities.
The management of technology involves bringing 
technical leadership to the mission and purpose of 
an organization. Managing technology also requires 
what Hargrove (2001, p.222) calls “block and tackle” 
managers who remove obstacles and barriers to staff 
achievement. Technical staff can exhibit creativity 
but can be thwarted by management’s need to ad­
here to a set agenda, program, direction or timeline. 
The technical aspects of managing technology can 
include project planning and can require an un­
derstanding of the systems development life cycle. 
Technical managers also have to understand typical 
information technology tasks, what makes up these 
tasks and how long tasks take in order to estimate and 
allocate project resources.
How to Solve Technology Problems
Management of technology can range from man­
aging information to applying technology to solve 
a problem or to meet a user or customer need. 
The process of solving the problems that manage­
ment of technology indicates may not be a straight 
line because of the complex nature of most prob­
lems. Laudon & Laudon (2007, p. 18) suggest a four 
step problem solving methodology that starts with 
problem identification and is followed by solution 
design, solution evaluation and choice and ends with 
implementation of the solution.
When managers examine how technology should 
be managed, careful consideration has to be given 
to the needs of users and various stakeholder groups 
while balancing the features and functionality of 
technology. Because of competing needs and a re­
quirement to balance technology needs versus or­
ganizational needs, the ability to conceive different 
paths and alternatives becomes a necessity. Hence, 
the opportunities for critical thinking abound.
Types of management problems in technology can 
include dealing with technical staff issues. One im­
portant technical staff issue is ensuring that internal 
skills are up to date and useful in meeting organiza­
tional needs. Technology training for technical staff 
is expensive and time consuming. Many technical 
professionals may also spend a considerable amount 
of personal time and money getting up to speed on 
new technology. The problem of technology training 
is not just reserved for technical staff. Increasingly, 
end users have to upgrade technology skills to be 
productive and contribute to organizational success. 
Managers of technology have to grapple with the 
most efficient and effective means of training end 
users given that most are at varying levels of initial 
knowledge. Sometimes, vendors offer training at no 
cost when major solutions are implemented. Vendor 
training is often standardized and may exceed the ef­
fectiveness of internally developed training as it is de­
ployed more often in many different situations.

Critical Thinking in the Management of Technology
77
Leadership for the front lines (1999) recognized 
that increasingly non-technical managers may be re­
sponsible for using, recommending and managing 
technology and has several recommendations from 
technology consultant Barbara E. Miller. One recom­
mendation is for managers to assess personal tech­
nology competence. Managers can be hampered by 
what is unknown but overwhelmed when trying to 
determine how much depth of knowledge is really 
necessary.
Another recommendation is to ask important 
questions about the use of technology and what 
benefits are provided at a personal, team or depart­
mental level. A critical question involves the use of 
technology and whether or not staff people are using 
technology to its greatest benefit. Miller believes 
that managers need to “understand the dynamics of 
change” noting that a small percentage of people are 
able to adapt easily to change while half have some 
difficulties and a third or more will resist change. 
Managing technology can also mean that managers 
foster a certain type of environment that fosters the 
type of responses needed. Managers can encourage 
users and technology professionals to engage in con­
tinuous learning for personal and organizational ben­
efit (Leadership for the front lines, 1999, para. 6.).
Managers of technology may have to deliver news 
that is not well received by some in an organization. 
Some unpopular decisions may be that all users have 
to participate in training, make changes to certain 
practices, have limits on certain resources or that cer­
tain projects will not be funded. Other decisions, such 
as outsourcing may affect whether or not technology 
employees will have a job in the future. While a deci­
sion like this may be very popular with senior man­
agers if it reduces cost significantly, it may cause a work 
slowdown or quick defection by affected employees. 
Miller also states that new technology requires new 
standards to inform employees on the effective use of 
new technology. A great deal of planning is necessary 
to visualize the impact and to communicate standards. 
While some issues may arise in attempting to buy in on 
standards from users, other problems may be avoided 
by establishing standards as early as possible.
Managing technology may deal with the problem 
of managing and qualifying information for use as 
business intelligence to manage operations and solve 
problems. This eWeek (2007) discusses service prob­
lems that plagued JetBlue Airlines when passengers 
were stranded for hours on a runway. JetBlue’s CEO 
blamed the mishap on faulty business intelligence. 
Technology allows access to large amounts of data but 
cannot always guarantee that the right data is available 
at the right time or if the data is accurate. JetBlue feels 
that the problem could have been avoided by using ac­
curate business intelligence that would have informed 
the airline about previous patterns and decisions.
Difficulties in Incorporating Critical Thinking
Critical thinking is defined as “An ability to evaluate 
information and opinions in a systematic, purposeful, 
efficient manner” (Cunningham, Cunningham and 
Saigo, 2002, glossary). While it may sound great to 
include critical thinking in the arsenal of technology 
managers, facilitating critical thinking is not a sure 
science. Riddell (2007, p.124) suggests that critical 
thinking may be nice to have but the ability to teach 
it is not supported by research. The author cites a 28 
year study of nursing education that did not show a 
correlation between increased education and an in­
creased ability to utilize critical thinking skills.
Riddell (2007, abstract) notes that there is no 
single agreed upon definition of critical thinking 
and discussion of the topic in theoretical terms is 
much easier and more prevalent than application 
to the practice of a discipline. Riddell (2007, p. 122) 
does go on to cite the commonalities in definitions 
given over 25 years by experts in the field of critical 
thinking to include:

 Reflection

 Identification and appraisal of assumptions

 Inquiry, interpretation and analysis

 Consideration of context.
Reflection provides the manager of technology an op­
portunity to step away from assumptions about tech­
nology that may be long-held. However, although a 
manager may be able to address personal long-term 
beliefs, there is another step in convincing others to 
also release assumptions. Reflection tends to expose 
limitations and many in the technology profession 
enjoy being thought of as very knowledgeable about 
technology. Reflection may also take time and the 
cycle of technology delivery is already long for most 
end users given design issues, compatibility issues, 
vendor delays, rollout phases and decision-making to 
include a technology project into a budget.

Principles of Business: Management
78
Identification and appraisal of assumptions made 
is somewhat like reflection in that it takes time, 
however, traversing assumptions can provide valu­
able input prior to launching a technology project. 
Knowing whether or not assumptions are valid can 
be helpful in reducing the cost and time associated 
with a technology project. Organizational influences 
can affect the objective appraisal of assumptions 
because most organizations still have a hierarchy 
and groups and factions can form that hold onto 
appraisal methods that prefer a specific school of 
thought. Vendors can be helpful in the identification 
and appraisal of assumptions by providing a view of 
what others are doing. Managers need to balance the 
views of vendors since providing information can be 
quickly transformed into a sales pitch.
Inquiry, interpretation and analysis can include 
research and pilot testing. These valuable activities 
can be limited by a lack of willingness by managers to 
be thorough or to consider technology alternatives 
that are unfamiliar. Managers are often cognizant 
of staying with safe solutions offered by large and fa­
miliar companies to avoid trouble should an expla­
nation be needed to justify a decision. In this case, 
time is again a factor in the level of rigor applied to 
research and testing. The prevalence of information 
can lead to almost limitless searching and evaluation 
of products and approaches. The beginning of the 
inquiry phase must include guidelines so managers 
can tailor the search for information and guide the 
testing without limiting the evaluation.
Managers of technology must always consider the 
context of the situation in which decisions are made. 
Context may end up dictating whether a decision is 
made or how. If the purse strings are controlled by 
an end user group that values speed over function­
ality, the best solution in the technology manager’s 
mind may not be selected. End user managers, for ex­
ample, may value cost over technology standards. A 
solution may be appropriate because it is inexpensive 
but doesn’t fit into existing information technology 
standards. A solution may be selected because it is the 
best available for the money and allows an end user 
group to perform specific functions that are needed 
today. Selecting a slightly inferior solution now may 
be a preferred course of action when weighed against 
the cost of not having functionality and waiting for it 
to appear in a more stable technology at an unknown 
later date.
Management of technology can benefit if man­
agers possess critical thinking skills, however, most 
technology decisions are not made in a vacuum and 
exist in the context of other organizational deci­
sions, opinions and assumptions. Along with critical 
thinking, managers may need to polish persuasive 
skills to influence and convince others when deci­
sion-making is shared.
Viewpoint
Who controls technology management decisions?
In previous years, some may have assumed that the 
management of technology was best left to technical 
wizards who excelled in understanding how tech­
nology works. As a result, the more technical per­
sonnel were obvious choices to consult about or to 
control technology management decisions. As tech­
nology implementation has matured, organizations 
have realized that a myriad of skills are needed to 
truly manage the proliferation and implementation 
of technology solutions. Just what skills are needed 
is often up for debate. The level of skill in terms of 
depth and breadth is often challenging and expen­
sive to acquire. A high level of technical skill may not 
be a guarantee that decisions are also based on busi­
ness strategy and organizational goals. Dubie & Duffy 
(2005, p. 41) feel both technology details and busi­
ness acumen must be emphasized to be successful in 
today’s organizations. The authors state “Even those 
pursuing the executive ranks should become conver­
sant in technology.”
In some circles, technology managers are required 
to have significant technical backgrounds in order 
for technical managers to gain and maintain the re­
spect of technical staff. In other scenarios, technical 
managers may experience management difficulties 
due to a lack of business, operational or manage­
rial skills. Critical thinking skills can help managers 
who are weak in a particular area, technical or busi­
ness, by allowing identification of barriers to decision 
making.
The ability to think critically may come naturally 
to some but can also be incorporated into the educa­
tion that students in a variety of disciplines receive. 
Greifner (2007) notes that in 2007 the International 
Society for Technology in Education revised its 
National Educational Technology Standards to 
include what students “should know about tech­
nology.” The Society has six categories of educational 

Principles of Business: Management

79
standards including: “creativity and innovation; com­
munication and collaboration; research and informa­
tion retrieval; critical thinking, problem-solving, and 
decisionmaking; digital citizenship; and technology 
operations and concepts.”
The management of technology requires a cre­
ative approach to problem solving. Robbins (2001, 
p. 134) described a three component model of cre­
ativity that merges expertise, creativity skills and task 
motivation. Success as a manager of technology is 
found in a balance of these three components. Some 
may argue that technology skills are most difficult to 
acquire for those without technology backgrounds, 
however, managers who excel at talent selection can 
surround themselves with technical individuals with 
specific attributes. Task motivation can dictate the 
skills technology professionals must have. Technical 
professionals are needed who can easily summarize 
technology issues and alternatives and who under­
stand how technology meets business objectives. 
Translating business objectives into technology re­
quirements is also a key skill. Organizations will de­
termine whether or not the background of the indi­
vidual is valued by the manner in which professionals 
are promoted or allowed to participate in technology 
decision making. Promoting from within sends a 
signal that whether an individual has a technology, 
business or industry background, the perception is 
that the skills necessary are available from within. 
Organizations can also bolster skills by providing on­
going training in management and technology skills 
for key employees.
Another battleground is departmental control of 
information technology. An information technology 
department may select and deploy various solutions 
or technology assets. But, once those assets are owned 
by a business unit and technology knowledge begins 
to proliferate, information technology departments 
may find that users want to exert greater control over 
how technology dollars are spent. Creative applica­
tion of critical thinking skills can help managers navi­
gate control conflicts.
Creativity in Managing Technology
For most managers of technology, the management 
of technology incorporates the ability to manage mul­
tiple competing objectives, high tolerance for con­
trolling and explaining ambiguity, and discovering 
creative solutions to complex problems as needed. 
Creativity is “the ability to produce novel and useful 
ideas” (Robbins, 2001, p. 133-135).
Creativity is needed because managers have to op­
erate at a “speed of light pace” (Leadership for the 
Front Lines, 1999, para. 1). Some of this pressure is 
due to the fact that users of technology have become 
used to an instantaneous response from computer 
systems and expect 100% uptime and immediate re­
covery from failures. Spangler (2006) reported on 
a 2005 Deloitte and Touche survey of information 
technology professionals which indicated that 12.1% 
of those polled has “zero tolerance” for downtime 
or computer outages. Only 7.8% stated that their 
businesses could operate for 72 hours without tech­
nology. Creativity may also mean dealing with situa­
tions that have not occurred before.
As the ability to collect data and analyze it has ex­
panded with the speed and power of computing, tech­
nology has developed to capture opportunities for 
using and monetizing it. Technology managers need 
to remain current on program updates and available 
alternatives and be able to integrate new applications 
and systems as part of a continual upgrading process. 
The very structure of an industry can change rapidly 
with introduced technologies, necessitating organiza­
tional changes that will depend on the critical thinking 
and visionary capabilities of technology managers and 
their subordinates (Drnevich & Croson, 2013).
One of the most important areas in which creativity 
is needed is in managing relationships. Both internal 
and external relationships have an impact on the 
ability to assess technology need, acquire appropriate 
solutions and effectively implement and manage 
technology. Managers of technology must purchase 
talent and technology and establish relationships with 
vendors to have resources available to provide assis­
tance and information when needed. Relationships 
in the industry can help managers become aware of 
the availability of scarce talent resources and compet­
itive trends. Strong internal relationships can ensure 
that support is available for decisions and projects. 
Some organizations are trending towards using cross 
functional teams for technology project implemen­
tations meaning that a technology department em­
ployee may not be the normal makeup of a project 
team member. Creative management of individuals 
who are not direct reports requires developing solid 
relationships with peer-level managers as well as sub­
ordinates and superiors.

Creativity in managing technology and more im­
portantly technology problems will likely find man­
agers looking for new ways to apply critical thinking 
skills to save time and money. Zhen (2005) defines 
five steps to the process of managing problems 
including:

 Detection

 Identification

 Determination

 Resolution

 Reflection.
Zhen suggests that new technology is needed to 
help determine the root cause of information tech­
nology problems. According to Zhen, existing UNIX-
based tools provide volumes of data that is difficult 
to search quickly and that do not have the capability 
to recognize time-stamped data. So while time data is 
available, the tools cannot incorporate that informa­
tion automatically into the research process causing 
manual and slower processing of information. In ad­
dition, programming of complex UNIX commands 
may be required to create a search argument that 
adequately addresses the information needed. Zhen 
suggests that the concepts learned and devised in on­
line search engines are the next step to making in­
formation technology problem solving more creative 
and effective. Technology management requires 
applying all available skills including creative and 
critical thinking to ensure productivity increases and 
costs are contained and reduced where possible.
Guillemette & Paré (2012) suggest that business 
objectives must be “constantly renewed and ad­
justed” and that the function of IT departments must 
be aligned with these objectives. This requires clari­
fication on the part of top management as to what 
exactly is expected from the company’s technology 
assets. How IT can support the strategic mission is a 
primary challenge for technology managers. A com­
pany’s agility in the marketplace in the twenty-first 
century is directly tied to strategic investment in and 
use of technology (Lu & Ramamurthy, 2011).

Decision Making
ABSTRACT
This article discusses decision-making in a business en­
vironment. While leaders are ultimately responsible 
for business decisions, problem-solving is a shared re­
sponsibility among top managers who make strategic 
decisions, middle managers who make tactical deci­
sions and lower level managers who make operational 
decisions. By having accurate information, decisions 
are more likely to be based on facts, sound reasoning 
and intelligence. This article will provide an overview 
of decision making and includes a discussion of fac­
tors that lead to good business decisions.
OVERVIEW
Leadership & Decision Making
One of the earmarks of an effective leader is someone 
who makes decisions while motivating people to im­
plement them. He or she must learn to communicate 
and deal with high and low-performing workers and 
bring out the best in both employees and managers 
while demonstrating authority and creativity. While 
leaders have different decision-making styles, a leader 
needs to choose the right people to participate in the 
decision-making process and there are some basics 
steps they must follow.
Leaders need to spot and solve problems while 
seeking opportunities to move the company forward. 
In order to do so, accurate information needs to be 
obtained, and a number of alternatives need to be de­
veloped and evaluated for strengths and weaknesses. 
Decisions are made after developing a number of 
ideas, debating a variety of options and encouraging 
an exchange of opinions in order to find the best 
course of action (Garvin, 2001).
While leaders are ultimately responsible for making 
business decisions, problem-solving is a shared respon­
sibility among people at different levels in a company. 
Further, there are different types of decision-making 
responsibilities and these include strategic decisions, 
tactical decisions and operational decisions.
Strategic Decisions
Top managers are often responsible for making stra­
tegic decisions or decisions that concern the long-term 
goals of the company. For example, a company might 
decide to develop new products or focus its ­efforts 
on increasing the volume of an existing product. 
Strategic decisions establish company policy and these 
decisions are often complicated because the future is 
uncertain and accurate information is often limited. 
In these cases, managers must rely on their past expe­
riences as well as their instincts (Janczak, 2005).
There are four techniques available to senior man­
agers. They must be able to generate conflict that 
needs to be resolved; employees should be encour­
aged to question existing assumptions; the work en­
vironment should be one that encourages learning, 
and finally, managers need to be able to distinguish 
between available resources and services and cus­
tomer needs (Young, 2005).
Tactical Decisions
Once a company’s goals and policies are established 
by senior management, tactical decisions aimed at 
achieving a company’s goals and implementing com­
pany policy need to be made. Such decisions are usu­
ally made by middle managers and require managers 
to focus on specific actions that will bring about the 
company’s objectives. For example, a mid-level man­
ager might devise a plan to provide employees with 
incentives in order to increase production. This re­
quires mangers to have accurate information so that 
their decisions are based on facts (Abukari, 2003).
Operational Decisions
Lastly, decisions regarding the day-to-day functions 
of a business also need to be made. These decisions 
are considered operational decisions and they are

subordinate to strategic and tactical decisions. While 
these decisions are the responsibility of low-level 
managers, good decision making is crucial here since 
such decisions focus on productivity, quality control 
and employee performance. Moreover, operational 
decisions can be broken down into:

 Short term planning needs like ordering supplies, 
establishing work priorities and enlisting tempo­
rary help.

 Medium term planning like hiring and firing per­
sonnel, purchasing equipment, training individ­
uals and modifying procedures.

 Long term planning like replacing subcontrac­
tors, redesigning production facilities and modi­
fying capacity (Copeland, 1986).
Importance of Debate & Open Exchange of Ideas
Although decision-making and problem solving oc­
curs at different levels of a company, leaders are ul­
timately responsible for every business decision and 
this requires a leader to have an understanding of 
strategic, tactical and operational decisions. Further, 
decision making rests not only on what decisions are 
made, but who makes them and how they are made. 
Business decisions often require an inquiry process, 
developing and debating a number of ideas in order 
to find the best course of action. This approach to de­
cision making is a test of strength among competing 
ideas (Garvin, 2001).
In order to encourage debate and a free exchange 
of ideas, a leader needs to have a high level of emo­
tional intelligence so that he or she can manage con­
flict that invariably arises in such an environment. 
Some leaders have a tendency to make decisions that 
are not based on sound reasoning while other deci­
sion makers can be rigid in their dealings with other 
people. However, leaders that exercise emotional in­
telligence can motivate people to be creative and to 
realize a vision (Batool, 2013). In the end, a decision-
making process that relies on debating a number of 
ideas should strive for a balance and a number of 
factors.
Successful leaders are flexible and open to the 
ideas of others, but also adhere to a set of core values 
— essentially an internal determination regarding 
what a company’s goals and aspirations are and how 
they plan to achieve them. At the same time, decisions 
must be made with an awareness of the outside world 
— leaders and managers must be capable of knowing 
what the truth is outside of the organization. This 
means understanding what factors are affecting the 
market. Understanding these factors will allow for 
good strategic decisions. Further, decision makers 
need to understand how that market is changing and 
to what extent the business can contribute to those 
changes. Such an understanding will lend itself to 
good tactical decisions. Finally, everyone involved in 
the decision-making process must understand what 
the company needs to do in order to be successful in 
that market as this will result in effective operational 
decisions (Unseem, 2005).
In the end, all levels of decision-making — strategic, 
tactical and operational, require access to accurate in­
formation. By having accurate information, leaders 
and managers will be better equipped to make deci­
sions that are based on facts, sound reasoning and in­
telligence. This information can also be thought of as 
business intelligence. Effectively employing business 
intelligence will enable leaders to provide managers 
with the right information at the right time. Having 
the right information will ensure that decisions will 
be based on facts and allow for decisions to be made 
more quickly. Moreover, because business intelligence 
relies on factual information, it encourages a rational 
approach to management (Abukari, 2003).
APPLICATIONS
Importance of Business Intelligence
Most businesses exist to provide goods and services 
to their customers and this requires decisions on 
how to deliver those goods, pricing, the handling 
of unsatisfied customers, and how to treat repeat or 
high volume customers (Rhode, 2005). Such deci­
sions require “mission critical business intelligence” 
and there are technologies that enable businesses to 
understand “customer buying behaviors and pref­
erences,” “product pricing and promotion” and 
“product assortment.” By evaluating this informa­
tion, a business is better able to make operational de­
cisions (Ross, 2007, p. 25).
Information Gathering
Not only is having access to business intelligence critical 
for operational decisions, such information also plays a 
role in strategic and tactical decisions. Supporting such 
decisions means “gathering actionable information

on the competitive environment” (Heath, 1996, p. 
52). This type of information has been termed “com­
petitive intelligence” of which there are basically two 
sources — traditional and nontraditional. Traditional 
sources of intelligence refer to published material 
such as newspapers, magazines, government and 
court documents and company reports, while nontra­
ditional sources include interviews with employees, 
suppliers, distributors and customers. Having access 
to this kind of business intelligence will prove valuable 
as a company makes strategic decisions like whether 
to enter into a new market. Competitive intelligence 
will also facilitate tactical decisions regarding how to 
enter a new market — such as by forming an alliance 
or merging with a company that already exists in a par­
ticular business sector (Heath, 1996).
Manager Instinct
Armed with this information, a successful leader will 
encourage managers to participate in the decision-
making process by debating ideas; however, he or she 
must also exercise leadership by making the final de­
cision and ensuring that decision is fully understood 
by employees. Moreover, the final decision must be 
implemented as soon as possible. Some managers 
stress intuition and believe they can rely on ‘gut in­
stincts’ when faced with the necessity for a speedy de­
cision. Some business consultants agree, saying that 
decision-making is really all about trusting one’s intu­
ition (Drury, 2005).
While wisdom may stem from experience, there 
are many who believe that innovation and invention 
require a person to be highly intelligent, intellectu­
ally and emotionally, and these abilities are not nec­
essarily a matter of experience. Further, decisions 
are sometimes required in the face of incomplete 
information. Many managers are able to rely on a 
minimum amount of information when making de­
cisions in a timely manner. A leader is one who can 
sense and articulate the aspirations of people and 
empower them to take action. Even though there are 
technologies that allow for more timely data analysis, 
a leader’s gut instinct might require a decision that 
relies on his or her vision more than any technical 
analysis (Drury, 2005).
Technology Use
In contrast, evaluating more options in less time re­
quires decisions to be based on reason, and relying on 
gut instincts may lead to unsuccessful outcomes. As 
situations become more complex, relying on intuition 
does not lend itself to good decision making since 
individuals are really basing their decisions on pre­
conceived notions about past events. Technological 
advances have increased the amount of accessible in­
formation and decreased the amount of time available 
in the decision-making process. At the same time, tech­
nology also provides the means to process information 
more quickly. Today, computer programs are being 
developed to enhance pre-existing decision-making 
tools that have been utilized by business people such as 
system dynamics and decision trees (Bonabeau, 2003).
System dynamics is a way of studying and managing 
complex feedback systems. This is a method that iden­
tifies a problem, explains the cause of the problem, 
builds a computer model that reproduces those 
causes, considers alternative ways to solve the problem 
and finally implements a solution. A decision tree is 
a tool used when there are choices between several 
courses of action. Decision trees consider a variety of 
options and the possible outcomes of choosing those 
options. They also form a balanced picture of the risks 
and rewards associated with each possible course of 
action. In short, these analytical methods assist busi­
ness people with quickly processing large amounts 
of information so that the facts about a given situa­
tion can be accurately determined. With these facts 
at their disposal, and after the issues have been thor­
oughly debated, managers and leaders are in a better 
position to make good decisions (Bonabeau, 2003).
While there are numerous methods and technolo­
gies for analyzing information and a myriad of solu­
tions that can be applied to strategic planning, good 
decisions ultimately rest on a leader’s emotional in­
telligence and vision. A leader must also be able to 
make rational decisions and communicate his or her 
vision and the reason for decisions to all levels of 
management. In some organizations, however, senior 
managers often make decisions themselves and then 
try to persuade people to buy into those decisions. 
According to Unseem, that approach precludes op­
tions and ideas that management may not have even 
considered. At the same time, all participants need 
to take responsibility for their involvement in the 
process. While a leader needs to choose the right 
people to fulfill managerial roles, it is the leader’s 
job to communicate effectively with the managers. 
In the end, the role of all employees in a business

organization is to represent the company as well as to 
work together to ensure the business’ success. Having 
the right people engage in an exchange of ideas cre­
ates an environment where information flows freely 
and success is more likely (Unseem, 2005).
VIEWPOINTS
Technological Advancements & Decision Making
The amount of information that people can access 
has expanded dramatically because of technological 
advances. In light of these developments, managers 
and leaders have more choices and data at their dis­
posal, but less time to make decisions.
Communication
As the Internet evolved, many businesses developed 
their own internal Internets, known as Intranets, and 
these innovations have enabled employees to be­
come more involved in the decision-making process. 
Moreover, other Internet-based technologies are 
being deployed on Intranet systems. Currently, the 
development of social software like web logs (blogs) 
and podcasting enables people to communicate and 
exchange information easily. A blog is a web-based 
journal written by one or more people. For example, 
CEOs are using blogs to communicate with the rank 
and file as well as for different groups in the organiza­
tion to share their accomplishments. A podcast is an 
audio file that can be used for broadcasting execu­
tive speeches throughout the company. Finally, most 
businesses today have internal e-mail and instant 
messaging capabilities that allow people to readily 
share information (Holtz, 2005). Businesses are also 
starting to utilize popular social media portals such 
as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter to enhance work­
place communications (Koster, 2012).
Further, having alternative means of communica­
tion can lend itself to creating a constructive envi­
ronment for engaging in critical debate. But the use 
of e-mail, Intranets, and social media creates a whole 
other layer of policies as to their proper use. A wrongly-
placed or used word in an e-mail can lead to misunder­
standings and even legal action and companies must be 
aware at all times of those implications (Lieber, 2011).
Use of Consultants
Although technological advances can enable people 
to process and analyze more information quickly, 
people-not machines or software programs-ultimately 
make decisions. There are many factors beyond the 
technical analysis of data that affect these decisions, 
such as the managerial and decision-making style of 
a leader, the interpersonal skills of the staff, as well 
as the corporate culture in general. According to 
Sargeant, technology does not allow a company to 
make determinations about the group dynamic and 
so objective opinions of managerial consultants are 
needed. To be effective, consultants need to under­
stand the business and be comfortable addressing a 
variety of issues such as leadership, finance and or­
ganization. Further, consultants can be useful if they 
are called upon to make assessments in a short time 
period and assist managers and leaders with commu­
nicating the goals of the company to those involved 
in the decision-making process, getting those indi­
viduals to cooperate and also enlisting the coopera­
tion of other divisions within the company (Sargeant, 
2005).
The fact that leaders are ultimately responsible for 
making decisions means that they must often make 
strategic decisions and then delegate tactical and op­
erational decisions to the right managers. Further, 
leaders must ensure that middle and low level man­
agers have access to sufficient information as well as 
the technological assets to analyze that information. 
In the final analysis, a successful business consists of 
successful people, and so it is reasonable to expect 
them to work towards implementing a leader’s final 
decision. However, emotions often become a factor 
in decision making. To be successful, a leader must 
be able to manage his or her emotions and also recog­
nize the emotions of others. This skill allows a leader 
to encourage people to work towards implementing 
strategic decisions. A leader also needs to be an ef­
fective communicator and open to new ideas and 
different views, especially concerning tactical and 
operational decisions. One way to accomplish this is 
by asking questions, pushing employees for more in-
depth explanations and in the end, explaining the 
rationale for the final decision (Garvin, 2004).
There are a number of ways a business can improve 
its decision-making processes. Whether they rely on 
advanced technology or the advice of independent 
consultants, successful decisions really require busi­
nesses to establish a set of core values. Doing so will 
allow an organization to attract employees and cus­
tomers who are aligned with those values.

Decision Making Under Uncertainty
ABSTRACT
Every day, managers make decisions that affect the 
profitability, effectiveness, and viability of the organi­
zation. Sometimes the factors affecting the predict­
ability of events can be determined. However, not all 
variables affecting outcomes are neatly predictable. 
Decisions made under uncertainty are decisions for 
which there is no meaningful probability distribution 
underlying the various outcomes. In these situations, 
the decision maker simply does not know what will 
happen for the various decision alternatives. There 
are several approaches to decision making under con­
ditions of uncertainty, including application of the 
Bayes’ Decision Rule, Markov processes, and gaming. 
In the end, however, virtually every decision requires 
judgment. Knowledge of stochastic processes alone 
are insufficient to guide decision making.

Every day, managers make decisions that affect the 
profitability, effectiveness, and viability of the organi­
zation. Although in some of these cases the parame­
ters are known (e.g., if Harvey gives a raise to the pro­
duction workers, there will not be enough money left 
over to buy parts to make widgets), in other cases they 
are not known (e.g., if Harvey does not give the pro­
duction workers a raise, he does not know whether 
or not they will stay and continue to make widgets). 
Similarly, many of the decisions facing managers are 
complex (e.g., Harvey can ask the workers to post­
pone getting a raise and continue to make widgets 
while the company tries a new marketing strategy; 
if the workers do not continue to make widgets, the 
company cannot afford the new marketing cam­
paign. However, there is no way to predict with 100 
percent accuracy whether or not the campaign will 
be successful enough to bring in the added revenue 
to enable the company to give the workers a raise).
Factors Affecting the Predictability of Events
Trends, Business Cycles & Seasonal Fluctuations
Sometimes the factors affecting the predictability of 
events can be determined. These deterministic vari­
ables are those for which there are specific causes 
or determiners and include trends, business cycles, 
and seasonal fluctuations. Trends are persistent, un­
derlying directions in which a factor or characteristic 
is moving in either the short, intermediate, or long 
term. In most cases, trends are linear rather than cy­
clic; growing or shrinking steadily over a period of

years. For example, the increasing tendency for busi­
ness to outsource and offshore technical support and 
customer service in many high tech companies over 
the past few years is a trend. However, not all trends 
are linear. Trends in new industries tend to be cur­
vilinear as the demand for the new product or ser­
vice grows after its introduction and then declines 
after the product or service becomes integrated into 
the economy. Another type of deterministic factor is 
business cycles. These are continually recurring varia­
tions in total economic activity. Business cycles usually 
occur across most sectors of the economy at the same 
time. For example, it has been noted that several years 
of a boom economy with expansion of economic ac­
tivity (e.g., more jobs, higher sales) are often followed 
by slower growth or even contraction of economic ac­
tivity. Business cycles may occur across one industry, 
a business sector, or even the economy in general. 
A third type of deterministic factor is seasonal fluc­
tuations. These changes in economic activity occur 
in a fairly regular annual pattern and are related to 
seasons of the year, the calendar, or holidays. For ex­
ample, office supply stores typically experience an up­
surge in business in August as children receive their 
school supply lists for the coming year. Similarly, the 
demand for heating oil is typically greater during the 
cool months than it is in the warm months.
Stochastic Variables
However, not all variables affecting outcomes are so 
neatly predictable. Stochastic variables are caused 
by randomness or include an element of chance 
or probability. These include both irregular and 
random fluctuations in the economy that occur due 
to unpredictable factors. For example, a natural di­
saster such as an earthquake or flood, political dis­
turbance such as war or flu epidemic that causes high 
absenteeism is often unpredictable and can affect a 
business’ profitability. In conditions of uncertainty, 
there is no meaningful probability distribution for 
the various outcomes. In these situations, the deci­
sion maker does not know what will happen for the 
various decision alternatives.
Conflicting Interests in Decision Making
Another factor complicating real world decision 
making processes is the fact that there is often more 
than one party to the decision and the parties may 
have conflicting interests. In fact, systems theory 
posits that the organization comprises multiple sub­
systems and that the functioning of each affects both 
the functioning of the others and the organization as 
a whole. So, for example, in the illustration above con­
cerning giving raises to the workers during a time of 
flux, there are at least two major parties to the deci­
sion. From the workers’ point-of-view, getting a raise 
now is better than maybe getting a raise later. Their 
raise or lack thereof, in turn, affects other parties not 
directly in the discussion such as their families (e.g., if 
there is no raise, the family cannot pay for Johnny’s tu­
ition) and their creditors (e.g., if there is no raise, the 
family cannot meet the increased payment on their 
adjustable rate mortgage). Management, of course, 
has a different point-of-view. If they give the workers a 
raise now, they will not have sufficient funds available 
for the new marketing campaign that will bring in 
more revenue. Without the additional revenue, they 
will have to lay off some of the workers, which means 
that they will not be able to meet an increased demand 
for widgets even if they do launch the new marketing 
campaign. They could take money to pay the produc­
tion workers from the monies set aside for raises for 
new product development, but then they would not 
be able to gain a competitive edge over the companies 
offering similar items in the marketplace. In addition, 
management needs to report to its stockholders, and 
increased wages may mean decreased profits.
Categories of Decisions to be Made
Certainty & Uncertainty
The decisions facing managers in the business world 
can be classified into several categories: decisions 
made under certainty or uncertainty, under risk, or 
under conflict. A decision made under certainty oc­
curs when all the facts of the situation are known 
and the model provides the decision maker with the 
exact consequences of choosing each alternative. This 
knowledge, however, does not mean that the deci­
sion is either obvious or trivial. There may be many 
possible courses of actions that can be taken, each 
with different consequences, and the decision maker 
needs to consider the advantages and disadvantages 
of each and weigh them against each other. Decisions 
made under uncertainty, on the other hand, are deci­
sions for which there is no meaningful probability dis­
tribution underlying the various outcomes. In these 
situations, the decision maker simply does not know 
what will happen for the various decision alternatives.

Multiple Criteria Decision Making
Multiple criteria decision making is a discipline that 
deals with the problem of making decisions in com­
plex situations where there are conflicting objectives. 
Multiple criteria decision making is founded on two 
interrelated, key concepts. Satisficing is the attempt 
to find solutions that satisfy all the constraints rather 
than optimizing them. For example, the workers may 
be given a raise, but only in six months after the new 
marketing campaign goes into effect. This would still 
give them a raise, but would also give the company an 
opportunity to get back on its feet. From the workers’ 
point-of-view, the optimal situation would be to get 
raise now. From management’s point-of-view, the op­
timal situation would be to keep wages low so that 
there are more profits. Neither one of these situa­
tions is optimized in this solution, but the constraints 
of both are satisfied. The second key concept of mul­
tiple criteria decision making is bounded rationality. 
This process involves setting the constraints of the 
situation and then attempting to find solutions that 
satisfy the constraints. This is an iterative process in 
which the constraints are adjusted as necessary and 
the search for solutions is continued until a satisfac­
tory solution is found. For example, the workers at 
Widget Corporation may be willing to postpone get­
ting a raise only if the raise that they get in six months 
is greater than the one that they would accept today.
Methods for Solving Multiple Criteria Decision 
Making Problems
As shown in Table 1, there are a number of methods 
available for solving multiple criteria decision making 
problems. Deterministic decision analysis is used 
to find the most preferred alternative in the deci­
sion space using value functions. Stochastic decision 
analysis does the same thing, but uses utility functions 
and stochastic outcomes. In the stochastic approach, 
both the utility function and the probability of the var­
ious outcomes are estimated by the decision maker. 
The multi-objective mathematical programming 
approach includes both multi-objective linear pro­
gramming and multi-objective integer programming.
Decision Theory
Decision theory is a body of knowledge and related 
analytical techniques designed to give decision 
maker information about a situation or system and 
the consequences of alternative actions in order to 
help him/her choose among the set of alternatives. 
One tool often useful in decision making is modeling 
building. Models are representations of a situation, 
system, or subsystem. Conceptual models are mental 
images that describe the situation or system. This 
type of model is the first step in creating mathemat­
ical or computer models that represent the situation 
or system using one or a series of mathematical equa­
tions. The development of models that accurately 
represents the real world is typically an iterative pro­
cess. Models must usually be tested and refined until 
they represent the real world to the degree desired 
by the analyst or decision maker. Initially, conceptual 
models tend to be broad or general representations 
without much detail but which span the range of vari­
ables to be considered. However, the initial model 
helps the analyst better understand the situation or 
system under consideration and to refine the repre­
sentation of the real world. As the model is analyzed 
and the situation is better understood, the model can 
be refined to better reflect the underlying reality.
APPLICATIONS
Approaches for Decision Making Under Uncertainty 
Bayes’ Decision Rule
There are several approaches to decision making 
under conditions of uncertainty. One of these is the 
application of Bayes’ Decision Rule. This is a deci­
sion making strategy in which one chooses the option 
with the largest expected payoff. This is determined 
by multiplying the consequences of each act by the 
probability of the several occurrences and then 
adding the products together. Decision models 
in these situations are characterized by several 
basic elements. First, there is a set of options from 
which the decision maker may choose as well as a 
set of consequences that may occur as a result of a 
given decision. In addition, Bayes’ Decision Rule 
assumes that there is an underlying probability dis­
tribution that can be used to quantify the decision

maker’s beliefs about the relationship between the 
various choices and resultant consequences. Further, 
this approach involves a utility function that quanti­
fies the decision maker’s preferences among the var­
ious consequences.
Markov Processes
Another frequently used approach in this type of situ­
ation is the application of Markov processes. These 
are stochastic processes in which the probabilities of 
future events are completely determined by the cur­
rent state of the process. So, for example, if one knows 
the current state of the process, no additional insight 
can be gained from previous states of the process. A 
Markov chain is a random process comprising discrete 
events in which the future development of each event 
is either independent of past events or dependent only 
on the immediately preceding event. Markov chains 
are often used in marketing, for example, to model 
subsequent purchases of products (i.e., the probability 
of the customer making a purchase from a particular 
business or brand is dependent only on his/her last 
purchase of that brand or independent of the brand).
Gaming
A third approach to decision making under uncer­
tainty is the application of gaming to real world prob­
lems. Gaming is an activity in which two or more inde­
pendent parties attempt to achieve objectives within 
a limiting context. In business, gaming involves the 
use of mathematics in determining optimal strategies 
and making the best possible decisions in context. 
Gaming, however, is a controversial approach to deci­
sion making, and is typically more art than science. 
However, it is possible to gain insights into a real world 
situation by designing, playing, or analyzing a game. 
Game design is a multi-stage process. First, one sets 
the objectives for the game and defines the param­
eters in which the game will be played. Once these 
constraints are articulated, a conceptual model is de­
veloped and decisions are made as to how best to rep­
resent it. The game is then constructed and refined. 
As opposed to other methods for making decisions 
under conditions of uncertainty, gaming is not a solu­
tion method nor does it lead to a forecast, solution, or 
prediction. However, a game does help the decision 
maker to better understand the situation about which 
a decision needs to be made, including its constraints, 
consequences, and greater ramifications.
Compromises in Decision Making
From a scientific point-of-view, it would be com­
forting to be able to collect data, build a mathemat­
ical model or perform a statistical analysis, and be 
given a number that could be looked up in a table 
to tell one whether to choose Option A or Option B. 
Unfortunately, real world decisions are not so simple. 
As discussed above, real world decisions often are 
made in situations where it is impossible to predict 
or even know all the parameters that affect the de­
cision. Further, real world decisions are more com­
plicated than decisions made in a laboratory setting 
because even in those few situations where there is 
only one decision maker in a business setting, a deci­
sion can ripple throughout the organization and its 
stakeholders. A decision that results in an optimal 
situation for one stakeholder may be disastrous for 
another stakeholder. Frequently, there is no best 
answer and the decision must be made as a series of 
compromises. In addition, it must be remembered 
that the interpretation of data analysis as, indeed, the 
very data themselves, are subject to the skill and qual­
itative assessment of the decision maker or analyst. 
In addition, it has been argued that the probabilistic 
and value-related factors of Bayesian methods imply 
a degree of precision that is impossible to obtain in 
the real world. As a result, the conclusions drawn on 
this methodology are too precise to be given much 
credence. Others have argued against the presump­
tion of normalcy underlying Bayes’ rule.
Forecasting for Business Decisions
Opinion about the best way to forecast for business 
decisions can be sharply divided between those that 
rely on statistical methodology and those that prefer 
to use their “gut” to determine where the industry, 
supply chain, or market is going. Both approaches 
have 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages, 
however. 
Statistical methods can be less prone to bias than are 
judgments. In addition, statistical methods tend to 
be more reliable and can more efficiently make use 
of historical data. On the other hand, statistical tech­
niques can only work with the data they are given. 
Judgmental decision making can be useful particu­
larly when there are recent events about which the de­
cision maker is aware but which have not yet had suf­
ficient time to result in observable data for analysis. 
There are, however, risks inherent in decisions that 
are made purely on subjective criteria. Human error

can make the analyst or manager more optimistic (or 
pessimistic) than actually warranted, trends or fac­
tors may be read into the data that are not actually 
there, or the effects of correlated variables may not 
be taken into account.
The Importance of Judgment
In the end, virtually every decision requires judg­
ment. First, judgment is key to determining which 
data are relevant to the model or game or that is con­
sidered in the analysis. Potential variables affecting 
decisions in the real world are virtually limitless. 
However, no statistical model or analysis can take all 
variables into account. Even if it could, spurious posi­
tive results would be seen due to the effects of prob­
ability alone. Therefore, it is essential that expert 
judgments be used to reduce the inputs into the pro­
cess. Judgment is also important in decision making 
because different analytic techniques can yield dif­
ferent results. It is the judgment of the analyst that 
determines which technique is most appropriate to 
analyze the data. The worth of the end result of the 
analysis depends heavily on correctly choosing the 
most appropriate analytical method. Finally, expert 
judgments can be essential to help the analyst under­
stand the situation and give insight into the param­
eters through which the data and subsequent analysis 
should be interpreted. Statistical processes alone are 
insufficient to guide decision making.

Decision Processes: A Core Business Activity Supported by 
Information Systems
ABSTRACT
Decision-making is required in organizations on a 
daily basis. The decisions that are made can deal 
with sales, operations, finances, products, com­
petition, employees and a whole host of other 
topics. Decisions can be short term, long term or 
emergency in nature. Organizational decisions can 
model or simulate the future while analyzing past or 
present performance. Technological advances in in­
formation systems provide large amounts of data to 
support decision-making as well as tools to analyze 
data in the context of specific problems and ‘what-if’ 
scenarios. Every organization has decision processes

and protocols. Decisions are impacted by the quality 
of the decision-making process. The flexibility and 
inclusiveness of decision processes contribute to the 
effectiveness and usability of decisions as does the 
availability of high performance decision support 
systems. Organizations can use information systems 
to analyze and predict. Other critical factors include 
balancing objective and subjective data and collab­
oration among decision-makers. Decision-makers 
may use intuition and internal know-how along with 
performance data to arrive at a decision. There are 
many ways to use information and decision-making 
tools. Addressing the need for high quality decisions 
may cause organizations to make significant invest­
ments in information technology that can guide, 
support and improve internal decision-making 
processes.
OVERVIEW
It is important that organizations make good deci­
sions. Decisions guide the organization to failure or 
success. Therefore, the organization needs to have a 
process in place that increases its chances of making 
good decisions. Decision activity in organizations can 
be complex and involved; answers to problems may 
not be simple or straightforward and may involve 
many different decision-makers. The organizational 
decision process is more complex than an individual 
decision because many types of data must be gath­
ered from different sources and given to multiple 
decision makers.
Organizations can make good decisions by:

 Recognizing when routine, traditional practices of 
decision making need to be replaced with creative 
decision processes

 Encouraging collaboration rather than competi­
tiveness in decision making

 Being adaptable in decision-making to better react 
to an ever-changing world

 Understanding how certain types of information 
systems (called decision support systems) can 
synthesize expertise in the field to assist decision 
makers. Decision support systems can guide, sup­
port and improve decision making. Decision pro­
cesses are the steps organizations go through to ar­
rive at decisions. These processes vary by size and 
type of organization. Good decision making means 
working together with others for creative solutions. 
Roszkiewicz (2007, p. 13) says collaboration “re­
fers to a rich and interactive relationship similar 
to the type we experience when brainstorming.” 
An orderly decision process requires that deci­
sion makers work together or collaborate on ideas 
about what information to consider, how solutions 
to problems look and the decision process itself.
But how do we get rich, interactive relationships? 
Individual decision-makers may lack strong skills in 
collaboration and may view decision-making with 
others as competitive instead of collaborative. One 
answer may be decision support systems (DSS). 
Information systems that support decision making 
are called decision support systems. According to 
French and Turoff (2007, p.39) decision support sys­
tems (DSS) can be used with individuals or groups 
to assist decision-makers by “organizing and commu­
nicating results” so each collaborative team member 
can come to a “shared understanding.” The shared 
understanding can be of the problem, strategy, solu­
tion or in retrospect when viewing a project that is 
completed.
Organizations need to make numerous deci­
sions to survive. Decisions can be daily shifts di­
recting operational activity, responses to problems 
or far-reaching and extensive charting of strategic 
directions. One by-product of having to make so 
many decisions is that decisions may be made based 
upon a certain history of success in creating solu­
tions or because of habits and perceptions held by 
decision-makers. The process of making decisions 
this way results in a routine or traditional organiza­
tional practice which may not lead to a correct re­
sult. This means that the decision-making process 
becomes a traditional organizational practice, in­
stead of a creative one. Once the decision process 
is set in an organization, it may be used over and 
over again even if it doesn’t fit the current problem 
type. Frederickson (2006) notes that organizations 
can be more attached to traditional practices for de­
cision processes and internal data than to industry 
best practices. He suggests that organizations work 
to incorporate industry best practices into decision 
processes for the greatest value and optimal deci­
sion-making results.
Organizations need to be adaptable in how they 
make decisions. Brown, Steyvers, & Hemmer (2007)

found that decision-makers need to adjust the 
methods used to make decisions because the environ­
ment in which decisions are made in organizations is 
constantly changing. Therefore, a decision process 
that worked for a particular problem at a particular 
time may not be as effective under other conditions. 
Similarly, circumstances and conditions may change 
so rapidly and dramatically that any former decision 
processes are outdated.
Obviously, an organization’s goal is to be profit­
able and productive. We have already discussed that 
organizations must sometimes break from the mode 
of traditional set decision-making for the sake of cre­
ativity, but creativity in decision-making must also be 
managed. The greater the innovation and creativity, 
the greater value that can be added to products and 
services that organizations produce. On the other 
hand, unmanaged creativity and innovation may in­
terfere with decision-making processes and process 
management because both can interrupt the logical 
and orderly flow that would occur with traditional, 
rational decision-making. Elbanna and Child (2007) 
suggest a connection in research of strategic decision 
processes between the size of the organization and 
the likelihood of using traditional, rational processes 
instead of creative ones. Such research indicates that 
the larger the organization, the more likely that tradi­
tional decision-making will be a set practice.
Organizations also need to closely watch whether 
their decision makers use logic to make decisions or 
whether politics plays more of a role. Rajagopalan, 
Rasheed, & Datta (1993, p. 351) stated that decision 
processes in organizations can model two types. The 
first is a rational type where strategic decisions are 
based on logic. The second is a political or behavioral 
type that is based on “bargaining and negotiations 
among individuals and organizational subunits with 
conflicting perceptions, personal stakes and unequal 
power.” Faulty decisions can occur simply because an 
individual or group has an unequal percentage yet 
persuasive amount of power. The organization needs 
to minimize the role of politics.
The Role of Decision Makers & Decision Support 
System Impact
Decision-makers assume several roles in the deci­
sion making process including analyzing informa­
tion, making assumptions about the validity of in­
formation and setting the parameters in ‘what-if’ 
scenarios. Decision-making may put the decision-
maker in the role of change agent and require man­
agement of expectations from those not involved 
in decision-making. The decision-maker must be 
cognizant of the need to include others while bal­
ancing external input. In addition, they must also 
perform the role of expert communicator with 
other decision-makers and to those outside of the 
decision-making team. Decision-makers must put 
results of decisions into context so that the infor­
mation can be effectively used as input for other 
decisions and to re-evaluate and modify organiza­
tional decision processes.
Today’s decision makers must have a global 
view when it comes to decision making. Stolarczyk 
(2007) notes the importance of decision-makers 
having a global view of the world, especially in 
manufacturing where organizations are likely to 
deal with suppliers from around the globe. The 
ability to use information technology related to 
global supply chains helps companies make “cru­
cial and timely financial decisions” (Stolarczyk, 
2007, p. 52).
The decision-maker may be placed in the unenvi­
able role of determining whether a company has a 
future or not. Crucial decision-making can be sup­
ported by effective DSS. Stolarczyk quotes a supply 
chain and logistics report on Fortune 500 compa­
nies as stating that many companies feel the supply 
chain technology being used doesn’t adequately 
support decision-making in “budgeting and cash 
flow planning.” Some barriers to acquiring adequate 
systems have been the lack of focus on the global 
supply chain and the investment cost, according to 
Stolarczyk.
Kelly, Hutchins, & Morrison, (n.d., abstract) et 
al conducted an experiment to determine the value 
of DSS in tactical decision-making. They found 
that throughout the decision making process, DSS 
helped guide, support and improve decision making. 
The experiment used experienced decision-makers 
engaged in real-life scenarios and found that those 
using DSS had less communication about simple 
situational information because of the ability to get 
the same view of the situation from the DSS. DSS 
were able to get to the central issues faster and for­
mulate what action was needed. Problems noted by 
Kelly et al. (p.1) were human issues related to the 
decision-makers’ ability to remember information,

difficulty in getting the group centered on the same 
information at the right time and biases among the 
decision-makers.
DSS was found to assist decision makers regarding 
decision bias problems. Decision bias problems in­
clude decision-makers continuing to hold to a spe­
cific opinion about risk or threat even when pre­
sented with new information that contradicted the 
decision-makers initial opinion (Kelly et al., p. 2). 
Decision-makers were also found to hold on to infor­
mation that was not related to the situation in making 
judgments. The study showed that early in the sce­
nario and through the middle of the scenario, deci­
sion-makers supported by DSS outperformed their 
counterparts without DSS in identifying critical issues 
of “greatest tactical interest.” However, late in the sce­
nario, decision-makers without the benefit of a DSS 
outperformed their counterparts in identifying crit­
ical issues (Kelly et al., p. 3). The authors postulated 
that these results indicate that the benefits of using 
a DSS wear off late in a scenario because critical is­
sues are somewhat obvious by that time even without 
using a DSS. Early identification of the critical factors 
by the DSS group could also be due to the human 
tendency to stick to initial information as correct.
The study by Kelly et al. showed that the group 
using the DSS was less likely to react and suggest tac­
tical action against threats based on ambiguous in­
formation. The authors felt that this was due to the 
ability of the DSS to help the group filter and inter­
pret ambiguous information to a higher degree than 
the group without the DSS. When analyzing specific 
performance against tactical threats, the study found 
that the group using the DSS was better able to de­
fend against these tactical threats than the group not 
using the DSS. This could be the result of team com­
munication, in that the group using the DSS had a 
greater shared understanding of the initial threat 
information.
DSS was also found to be helpful in terms of com­
munication. Kelly et al. (p.4), wanted to determine 
whether or not using a DSS affected how decisions 
are made about what action to take and when. The 
experiment analyzed the amount of verbal com­
munication among the decision-making teams and 
found that fewer communications were initiated by 
the DSS team among themselves but slightly more 
when encountering external information. Kelly et al. 
examined the content of verbal communications to 
determine whether or not it was affected by a DSS. 
The areas of content were coded in the following way:

 Information

 Status

 Clarification

 Assessment

 Orders or commands for action
The Kelly study concluded that with a DSS, the 
group was able to spend more time on clarifying, 
assessment and giving orders and less time on ex­
changing basic information and status because the 
DSS provided that information. The study concluded 
that having a DSS caused teams to communicate less 
frequently but more efficiently, and greater experi­
ence with a DSS could affect performance and com­
munication even more. The authors also found that 
to have the optimum effect, a DSS would have to have 
specific features to support performance and com­
munication such as being easy to access, having a 
user friendly interface and the ability to track impor­
tant tactical data easily.
Using Decision Support Systems
What is a decision support system? One definition 
from French and Turoff (2007, p. 39) is that decision 
support systems (DSS) support “operational, tactical 
or strategic decision-making.” The authors suggest 
that DSS must have the flexibility to make assump­
tions or allow for decision-maker input. It is impor­
tant that DSS meet the following important criteria: 
1) fit technology to purpose; 2) take a knowledge 
management perspective and allow collaboration; 3) 
data quality; 4) audit.
Each of these criteria has a specific meaning, fit­
ting the technology to the purpose means not just 
the problem at hand but also organizational objec­
tives, management processes and culture. In addi­
tion, the organization must be willing to change the 
technology when another type of technology or tech­
nology tool is better suited for the scenario. A knowl­
edge management perspective means considering all 
the knowledge that is available in the organization 
that might impact decisions. Collaboration among 
groups and various organizational units ensures a 
thorough problem perspective exists. Data quality 
criteria address the fact that while data exists it may 
not be ‘clean’ or verified. In addition, uncertainty 
Decision Processes

Principles of Business: Management
96
can exist because data from various sources may con­
tradict data from other sources. Decision-makers are 
then put in the position to make judgments even with 
the uncertainty present in the available information. 
The audit criteria recognizes that all organizations 
audit activities in some way and decision support sys­
tems should participate by recording and monitoring 
information and prompting specific activity when 
required (French & Turoff, p.40). The audit data 
can also provide management teams with “shared 
meaning” of events and activities and make sure that 
actions are thoroughly analyzed after the occurrence 
so that the information can be input into future deci­
sion-making activities.
DSS assists in real-world decision making. In one 
study, DSS helps to predict change in the future. 
Kirilenko, Chivoiu, Crick, Ross-Davis, Schaaf, Shao, 
Singhania, & Swihart (2007) discuss an Internet 
based DSS for forest landowners whose purpose is to 
help in the management of family forests. The DSS 
provides useful information on various species, tree 
density and size as well as specifics to geographic re­
gion and wildlife in the region. A unique modeling 
capability of the tool is the ability to predict “forest 
dynamics” “40 years into the future” (Kirilenko et 
al., abstract). Important details available to users of 
the tool include the ability to measure and predict 
changes to the forest in many ways using a “Forest 
Vegetation Simulator.” Since knowledge about for­
ests is highly specialized, a tool of this nature is a re­
quirement to effectively manage a forest and to have 
social consideration for natural habitats that cannot 
be easily replaced if destroyed. Unlike the dairy pro­
duction DSS (Higgins, 2007) where farmers had high 
levels of sophisticated knowledge and history in the 
industry, the trend in family forest management is 
that new owners typically have urban backgrounds 
and little knowledge of forestry. The forest land­
owner DSS seeks to connect these new owners with 
the resources available through the government in 
the natural resources arena.
DSS can assist in problems that occur when people 
work in groups. Group Decision Support Systems 
(GDSS) have the goal of getting past the typical bar­
riers found in group meetings and collaborative situ­
ations (Roszkiewicz). Since people are the most im­
portant and expensive resource in an organization, 
investments may be made in systems that corral the 
capabilities of people which Roszkiewicz (p.13) calls 
integrating “computer power in our attempt to identify, 
collect, organize and interpret the thoughts of the most 
important human resources each company has.”
Challenges arising when working in groups in­
clude distributing information and hoping that the 
group understands the significance of the informa­
tion, and organizing it and applying that informa­
tion to the problems within the organization. At the 
same time, the inability to focus on what is important, 
personality conflicts and personal biases may make 
it difficult for the group to stick to an agenda and 
move the agenda forward. GDSS provide discipline 
and structure to group interactions while helping 
provide consensus regardless of the social skills of 
the participants. (Roszkiewicz, 2007). The goal is to 
capitalize on the value of the intellectual capital of 
the group without the downside of ineffective inter­
actions. Roszkiewicz (2007) notes that GDSS have the 
ability to:

 Brainstorm

 Organize

 Prioritize
GDSS pairs web-conferencing capabilities with 
Internet browser based GDSS to capture free flowing 
comments while providing “tools for decision-
making and reporting.” GDSS also allows for the 
pre-planning of collaboration to ensure that decision 
processes are mapped to activities.
While decision-making can include everyday and 
mundane organizational decisions, the process can 
also include life and death situations. Physicians fre­
quently make life and death decisions and therefore 
it is critical that there is a decision process in place 
to help physicians make good decisions. This type 
of challenging decision-making can be assisted by 
information systems because such systems can easily 
synthesize expert opinions for physicians. According 
to Lamont (2007) decision support systems can be 
used to ensure correct patient diagnosis. Clinical 
Decision Support Systems (CDSS) can make physi­
cians aware of the latest information on an illness and 
also limit the likelihood of misdiagnosis of an illness. 
Physicians use decision support systems to help them 
with diagnosing illnesses and correctly interpreting 
symptoms. The goal of decision support systems in 
healthcare is to improve the safety of the patient and 
reduce cost. The better the information available to 
Decision Processes

Principles of Business: Management
97
clinical practitioners, the higher the level of patient 
care. Developing a CDSS can be quite involved be­
cause it requires building a repository of diseases as 
well as the treatment protocols and drugs used.
The benefit of technology is that a CDSS can elec­
tronically store information from the oldest medical 
texts while including up-to-date information from 
journals (Lamont, 2007). CDSS allows medical 
professionals to input patient symptoms and will 
output possible diagnoses and links to the latest re­
search. Newer CDSS have emphasized decreasing the 
amount of information that has to be entered about 
a patient’s condition and have simplified the method 
for getting answers. Now, physicians can combine 
CDSS with electronic medical records (EMR) to co­
ordinate and integrate information about the patient 
and the illness in order to improve the quality and 
speed of care. Integration of these various systems is 
supported by service oriented architecture (SOA) in 
which the architecture of systems is oriented towards 
the processes and uses by end users and is not de­
pendent upon the underlying technology platform. 
SOA frees users to view information such as patient 
data through a similar interface no matter where it 
originated (Lamont, 2007). Without these systems, 
physicians might rely only on their previous knowl­
edge and education. CDSS allows decision-makers to 
be flexible in their approach to decision making, so it 
is possible to include the best ideas.
The practice of using information systems to assist 
with decision-making has been introduced success­
fully to the dairy industry. As in the medical industry, 
synthesizing expert knowledge allows for better deci­
sion making. Higgins (2007) notes that effective deci­
sion support systems rely heavily on the knowledge of 
experts in the field and must be based on that knowl­
edge. A decision support system was created for the 
dairy industry and the design was developed with 
input from dairy farmers to ensure the value of the 
farmers’ knowledge was included to increase the value 
of the DSS. Higgins considers the science and tech­
nology arguments on who controls design and how 
system design is heavily skewed towards the designer 
and not necessarily end users or subject matter ex­
perts. The use of decision support systems in the dairy 
industry has been shown to improve productivity and 
reduce costs. The value of DSS in dairy production has 
become increasingly important with increased global 
competition in farm production (Higgins, 2007).
Viewpoint
Creativity & Decision-Making
The process of decision-making can be tedious or 
exciting depending on the outlook and tolerance of 
the individual, the complexity of the problem, the 
available support tools and the ease of collaborating 
with others in decision-making. A certain amount of 
creativity is required as problems and issues may not 
take the same shape or format and a variety of skills 
and abilities may be called upon to make successful 
decisions. This is especially true of decisions that in­
volve performance and prediction. Former levels of 
performance may not meet current needs and the 
ability to accurately predict the future may depend 
on many factors including those over which the deci­
sion-maker has no control. Marakas and Elam (2007) 
call creativity “one of the most vague, ambitious and 
confusing terms.” Matching creativity in a business 
environment that is accustomed to strict and accu­
rate performance measures is a difficult task. Even 
if an organization has been successful in creative 
problem-solving and decision-making, reproducing 
what is difficult to quantify may seem like an impos­
sible undertaking.
Weber (1986) suggested that decision support sys­
tems “should be designed to stimulate learning and 
creativity.” Weber felt that the research supported 
a responsibility being placed on the designer of a 
DSS to stimulate the problem-solving and decision-
making creativity of the user. Learning and growth 
can take place in the process of making decisions and 
solving problems, and a useful DSS supports both. 
Designers have to be exposed to users and subject 
matter experts in order to have a full understanding 
of what design issues are pertinent in making DSS 
usable and effective. Higgins (2007) describes a two-
day workshop for dairy farmers used to examine 
farmers’ “preexisting knowledge” as well as to deter­
mine whether or not users (farmers) felt the DSS had 
benefits and could be used in daily production.
Weber (1986) noted that DSS are by nature sup­
portive of “human cognitive processes and semi-
structured situations.” He states that the benefit of 
DSS is the ability to support individual and organiza­
tional learning and performance while reducing the 
“cognitive differences” that people may have. Kelly et 
al. also found that DSS are useful in reducing the dif­
ferences between the interpretations of data by deci­
sion-makers. Weber saw the shift in DSS evolution in a 
Decision Processes

way that provides decision-makers with learning tools 
that are more effective in ‘ill-structured” problem-
solving scenarios. Weber (1986) defined cognitive 
processes as consisting of “sensation and perception” 
while learning is comprised of four sub-processes:

 Selection

 Construction

 Integration

 Acquisition
Further, Weber considered problem-solving to be 
“the active manipulation of perceived, learned, and 
remembered information.” The difficulty in solving 
a problem is directly related to “the amount of struc­
ture,” “the power of the chosen solution methods 
and the knowledge available to the user.” “Cognitive 
strategies” are used to “acquire, store, retrieve and 
manipulate information” and “affect how creatively 
we think…” Weber calls creativity “originality in 
problem solving” and “an outcome of learning.”
Weber noted that previous DSS were product ori­
ented instead of process oriented and felt that in 
order to make DSS “systems to think with (STW)” 
the DSS must map to the natural cognitive processes 
decision-makers use in problem-solving. He suggests 
that designers are most successful when using ana­
lytical tools that model situations using analogy and 
“familiar electronic metaphors.”
Marakas and Elam (1997) explored creativity in 
the context of the process used by the decision-maker, 
the tool or the DSS used to deliver the process. The 
findings of this study indicated that the best result 
to maximize creativity was combining DSS capabili­
ties to guide the decision-making process with a user 
armed with knowledge and understanding of the 
decision-making process. This method was found to 
be superior in enhancing creativity over simply using 
a DSS or the user using the decision process without 
a DSS. The need to explore creativity is driven by the 
fact that more unique solutions are required more 
quickly and there is a human tendency to continue to 
use the same processes for finding solutions.
Balancing Intuition (Gut-Feel) & Objective Data
Decision-makers have to balance what they know with 
what they feel and historical organizational experi­
ence. Decision support systems cannot be designed 
in a vacuum and must take into account the decision 
processes of the organization, best practices in deci­
sion-making, the ability for an organization to learn 
and the system’s ability to capture and ignite the cre­
ativity of the decision-maker. Studies have shown that 
decision-making performance is supported or ham­
pered by:

 The decision-making process employed

 The quality of support tools

 The ability to incorporate creativity into the pro­
cess and tools, and

 The effectiveness of decision-makers to collabo­
rate with others.
Part of the balance needed in decision-making is be­
tween raw data and the decision-makers’ ability to 
interpret meaning from the data and the real-world 
scenario that requires a solution. Decision-makers 
today have the benefit of large quantities of infor­
mation and DSS can offer tools to screen, filter and 
contextualize data in light of problem-solving sce­
narios. However, decision-makers must guard against 
human tendencies and biases that restrict decision-
making while allowing intuition to guide the creative 
process of decision-making. While learning can be a 
natural outcome of decision-making and even using 
DSS, decision-makers may be reluctant to shift deci­
sion processes or experiment creatively on critical de­
cisions. Decision-makers are likely to feel that there is 
less risk in deploying pre-existing decision processes 
than new and creative ones.
Fowler (1979) suggested that information systems 
fail to reach their goal of “informing managers” be­
cause of being based on the assumption that man­
agers can understand and define what information 
needs to exist before making decisions. Part of the 
intuitive nature of decision-making rests with systems 
designers as well as with decision-makers who antici­
pate the needs for data and customize the organiza­
tional decision processes to support and accelerate 
decision-making. Fowler stated that design strategy is 
important to avoid creating DSS that only encompass 
the designer’s viewpoint and end up providing the 
decision-maker with answers that are “irrelevant” or 
“unasked.
In studying strategic decision processes of organi­
zations, Rajagopalan et al. (1993) found several fac­
tors influencing the decision process models used 
including:
Decision Processes: A Core Business Activity Supported

Principles of Business: Management
99

 Organizational context affects decision-making 
and is influenced by uncertainty and complexity.

 Organizational internal power structure, past 
performance and strategies exert substantial in­
fluence on decision processes and may follow in­
dustry patterns.

 Decision processes vary within an organization 
based on urgency, reason for decision, uncertainty 
about outcomes and the degree of resource com­
mitment.
These findings underscore the importance of the 
process as well as the DSS deployed for decision-
making. Decision outcomes such as timeliness, speed 
and quality are easily tied to the quality of a deci­
sion support system while outcomes such as organi­
zational commitment and learning are not as easily 
incorporated into system design. Similarly, decision 
processes can be connected to organizational com­
mitment and learning without as tangible a connec­
tion to timeliness, speed and quality. Organizations 
that are serious about improving the results of deci­
sion-making must work diligently to examine deci­
sion processes and incorporate desired processes 
into the design of decision support systems.

Decision Support Systems
ABSTRACT
Every day, managers are faced with decisions about 
how best to run their organizations in order to gain 
or maintain a competitive edge. Although some 
decisions are simple, many are quite complex and 
require the manager to consider many variables. To 
help managers in decision making processes, many 
organizations employ the use of computer-aided 
decision support systems. These systems can help

managers make decisions about semi-structured and 
even unstructured problems where not all the infor­
mation is known in advance. Several different types 
of decision support systems are available. These in­
clude model-driven systems, data-driven systems, 
knowledge-driven systems, and group support sys­
tems. These decision support systems can be quite 
effective in aiding managers in making decisions 
and improving the effectiveness and performance of 
organizations.
OVERVIEW
The world around us is constantly changing. Market 
needs are shaped by numerous factors including po­
litical realities, advances in technology, and changing 
cultural expectations. To be competitive in this en­
vironment, businesses cannot be static, but need to 
grow and change to meet the needs of the market­
place. To do this, businesses need to be able to make 
good decisions in response to the changing needs of 
their environment. In some cases, these are simple 
decisions: Do we produce more widgets in response 
to increase market demand? Should we order more 
raw materials so that we can continue to produce 
gizmos? In other cases, however, the decision is not so 
simple. The demands of the marketplace may not be 
easily deciphered. As exemplified by the 8-track tape 
systems and the Beta video recorder of the latter half 
of the 20th century, decoding trends and translating 
them into business strategies is neither a simple nor 
an obvious process. In addition, management deci­
sions can have far reaching impact within the orga­
nization. For example, the decision to increase the 
production of widgets may mean that more em­
ployees are needed for the widget production line. 
Management is now faced with another decision: 
Should new production workers be hired or should 
employees be transferred from the gizmo produc­
tion line? If the former decision is made, where does 
the money come from to hire the new workers? If 
the latter decision is made, what is the impact on the 
gizmo production line? Considerations of the pro­
duction rate for new gizmos or even the viability of 
the gizmo line also need to be taken into account in 
order to understand the ramifications of the decision 
in context.
In most complex business situations, it is impor­
tant to understand the factors of decision making 
in context. Organizational behavior theorists tend 
to view the organization as a system, where changes 
in one subsystem can have far ranging impact 
throughout the organization as a whole. In this view, 
an organization is an interactive system in which 
the actions of one part influence the functioning of 
another. Rather than merely focusing on the needs 
of one part or subsystem within the organization in 
isolation (e.g., the widget production line) when 
making a decision, it is important to look at the 
impact of the decision on all subsystems and levels 
within the organization.
According to systems theory, organizations are 
systems comprising numerous subsystems. Rather 
than viewing an organization as a collection of disas­
sociated parts acting independently, systems theory 
posits that the functioning of each subsystem im­
pacts the functioning of the other subsystems. For 
example, in the illustration above, the decision to 
increase production of widgets can affect other parts 
of the organization. If more production workers are 
hired for the widget line, there might also be a con­
comitant need to hire more human resources and ac­
counting personnel to take care of issues and tasks 
related to a larger work force. Other considerations 
in the decision might include whether or not sup­
pliers could deliver sufficient raw materials to make 
the widgets or sufficient boxes to package the widgets 
so that they could be sold to consumers. In addition 
to hiring more workers for the widget production 
line, the organization would also more than likely 
also have to hire additional supervisors or managers 
for the new production lines. The increase in workers 
for the widget line might also cause conflict between 
the new workers and the workers already working on 
the widget production line or between the widget 
workers and the gizmo workers. Such conflict or job 
dissatisfaction could affect the functioning of the or­
ganization as a whole. Personnel issues are not the 
only factor that needs to be taken into account in this 
decision. Management would also have to consider 
where the new production lines would be located. If 
there was insufficient room in the current produc­
tion plants, new facilities would need to be bought 
or leased. Similarly, new lines would probably re­
quire additional equipment. If, on the other hand, 
the organization decides that it is not cost effective 
to incur the expenses associated with starting new 
production lines, there would be other impacts on 

Decision Support Systems

the organization. If workers are transferred from 
the gizmo line to make widgets, what happens to the 
gizmo product line? Even if the organization’s man­
agement decides to convert some of the gizmo lines 
into widget lines and transfer some of the existing 
employees to the new line, these employees would 
have to be trained to become widget line operators; 
a necessary activity that would also cost the organiza­
tion money. Each subsystem within the organization 
(e.g., the various production groups, accounting, 
human resources, management) affects the ability 
of the other groups — as well as of the organization 
as a whole — to do their jobs. Systems theory also 
recognizes that the organization is not only made 
up of interlocking subsystems, but is also part of a 
larger system itself that depends on inputs of raw ma­
terials, human resources, and capital and that needs 
to export goods or services, employee behavior, and 
capital in order to continue to the viability of other 
organizations.
To help management make such complex de­
cisions, many organizations use decision support 
systems. Although there is no universally accepted 
definition of the term, in general a decision support 
system is an interactive computer-based system that 
helps managers and others make decisions. Decision 
support systems are used both by individuals and 
groups, and can be stand alone systems, integrated 
systems, or web-based.
Decision support systems are used when organi­
zations are faced with unique, complex situations 
where a decision needs to be made. Decision sup­
port systems help decision makers better understand 
the issues underlying the situation and to make de­
cisions in situations where the extent to which cer­
tain variables influence the activity or outcome are 
not initially clear or only part of the information is 
available in advance. This condition is referred to as 
an unstructured situation. To answer unstructured 
questions, decision support systems must be flexible 
so that the impact of various variables and conditions 
can be tested and the analysis returned to the user 
in a form that is useful for the specific situation. The 
unstructured nature of the problem also means that 
the use of a decision support system is an iterative 
process: The answers to the questions are not ends 
in themselves, but raise other questions for consider­
ation that need to be run through the decision sup­
port system.
Decision support systems can help decision 
makers in such situations by providing the informa­
tion and structure needed to make a rational deci­
sion. The decision support system creates a quantita­
tive model of the situation and then processes data to 
show the impact of the variables under consideration 
on the outcomes. Decision support systems can help 
decision makers answer questions concerning con­
ditions under which an outcome might occur, what 
might happen if the value of a variable changes, or 
how many potential customers have certain charac­
teristics. Decision support systems can also help to 
trim inefficiencies from organizational systems, such 
as the supply chain, which further can take into ac­
count other company priorities such as carbon em­
missions reduction. Frequently, decision support 
systems require the processing of data from multiple 
files and databases.
Decision support systems are not necessarily eso­
teric software applications. Spreadsheet software is 
one of the most frequently used decision support 
tools. These applications help the decision maker 
design a table of values arranged in rows and col­
umns in which the values have predefined relation­
ships. Spreadsheet application software allows users 
to create and manipulate spreadsheets electronically. 
As a decision support system, spreadsheets enable 
the decision maker to manipulate variables to see 
the effect of different values on the variables or of 
changing the assumptions on the outcome. For ex­
ample, before making an investment in a new manu­
facturing plant, a manager could make a model on a 
spread sheet and analyze the effect of changing in­
terest rates on the risk associated with the venture.
APPLICATIONS
Several different general types of decision sup­
port systems have been identified in the literature. 
These include model-driven systems, data-driven sys­
tems, knowledge-driven systems, and group support 
systems.
Model-Driven Decision Support Systems
A wide variety of models can be used to form the basis 
for decision support systems. Model-driven decision 
support systems use various financial, optimization, or 
simulation models as aids to decision making. Model-
driven decision support systems use limited data and

parameters provided by the decision makers, but do 
not generally require large databases. For example, 
in 2000, Pfizer merged with Warner-Lambert to form 
an integrated company with sales over $30 billion. As 
part of the process of integrating the two companies, 
a decision support system was used to combine the 
distribution systems of the two organizations. Three 
linked simulation models were developed: a distribu­
tion center storage and capacity model, a distribu­
tion picking and shipping model, and a distribution 
center facility sizing model. Using these three models, 
the distribution center capacity requirements for two 
to five years in the future were studied. Analysts were 
able to examine the effects on inventory and distri­
bution of a variety of sales forecasts. Warner-Lambert 
also developed an optimization model that enabled 
decision makers to analyze the flow of products 
through the network during stated planning periods. 
A fifth model was used to analyze inventory invest­
ments for the combined organization. The decision 
support system and its models were used for a series 
of long-range studies that helped Warner-Lambert 
make decisions about expansion of its distribution 
network, implementation of a new pharmaceutical 
delivery network, and consolidation of the distribu­
tion networks after the merger.
Another example of a model-driven decision sup­
port system was employed by General Motors in their 
decision to incorporate the OnStar two-way vehicle 
communication system in its new vehicles. In 1996, 
General Motors tested a prototype of the OnStar 
system, but found that it was both difficult to install 
and expensive. When the time came to make a stra­
tegic decision about the installation of OnStar in 
General Motors’ vehicles, two models were devel­
oped. The conservative model posited that OnStar 
should only be offered as an option and promoted 
to improve vehicle safety and security. The more op­
timistic model assumed that OnStar would appeal to 
customers enough so that they would subscribe to the 
service, thereby generating significant monthly in­
come from service fees for General Motors. Although 
the potential income from this latter model was at­
tractive, it also carried with it concomitant increased 
risk and the need for a greater initial investment. As 
opposed to the previous example where data were 
available about the existing systems, the model devel­
oped to analyze the potential profitability of OnStar 
was for a system that had never been implemented. 
General Motors developed a six factor simulation 
model of the system incorporating customer acqui­
sition, customer choice, alliances, customer service, 
finances, and dealer behavior. The model also incor­
porated feedback loops to make the simulation more 
realistic. In the end, the decision support system 
allowed management to determine that customer 
service was an important factor in the implementa­
tion of OnStar technology: If General Motors did not 
adequately invest in the project, the system would 
fail. Using the simulation, the recommendation was 
made for an aggressive strategy to pursue OnStar 
technology.
Data-Driven Decision Support Systems
Data-driven decision support systems utilize time se­
ries data gathered on the factor or characteristic of in­
terest at regular intervals over a period of time. Basic 
data-driven decision support systems access simple 
file systems using query and retrieval tools whereas 
more advanced data-driven systems allow the manip­
ulation of data or analytical processing. Executive in­
formation systems are a type of data-driven decision 
support system. These data-driven decision support 
systems are designed to support executive decision 
making by presenting information about the activi­
ties of the company and the industry. Executive sup­
port systems offer quick, concise updates of business 
performance for top executives. These systems have 
powerful processing capabilities in order to summa­
rize and present data in a format appropriate to ex­
ecutive decision making.
Top executives differ from middle managers be­
cause they need to take a more global view of the orga­
nization rather than focusing on a particular process 
or product. Top level managers are also particularly 
concerned with the systems approach and need to 
know how decisions made regarding one part of the 
organization effect other parts of the organization as 
well. Executive support systems take these needs into 
account. To support top-level managers in their tasks, 
executive support systems allow executives to look 
not only at the organization as a system itself, but at 
the organization as part of a larger system as well. To 
do this, executive support systems permit scanning 
of data and information on both internal activities 
as well as the external business environment. Since 
executives tend to look at things from a higher level 
than do many analysts, executive support systems

highlight significant data and present information in 
summary form rather than giving the user all the de­
tails and supporting data, although users are allowed 
access to these data if desired. This “drill down” 
feature allows the user to go down several levels to 
acquire the data necessary to make a well-informed 
decision.
Executive support systems are generally well ac­
cepted by top-level managers. Although these systems 
have relatively simple user interfaces to support the 
way that most top-level managers work, they can be 
used for a wide range of purposes. For example, exec­
utive support systems can be used to determine why a 
company’s expenses are higher than expected, gain 
an overview of a competitor’s financial picture, be 
continually updated on various corporate indicators 
relating to effectiveness and performance, or check 
for processes that are not meeting expectations.
Knowledge-Driven Decision Support Systems
Knowledge-driven decision support systems are 
person/computer systems with specialized problem 
solving abilities that can make suggestions or recom­
mendations to the user. Knowledge-driven systems 
are expert systems that may include the application 
of artificial intelligence to the decision making pro­
cess. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer 
science concerned with development of software that 
allows computers to perform activities normally con­
sidered to require human intelligence. In the realm 
of decision support systems, artificial intelligence ap­
plications can be used in the development of expert 
systems that allow computers to make complex, real 
world decisions. Applications of artificial intelligence 
to decision making include medical diagnosis, manu­
facturing quality control, and financial planning.
An example of a knowledge-driven decision sup­
port system is the expert system for dispatchers used 
by Con-Way Transportation Services. Con-Way offers 
premium next-day service for less-than-truckload 
shipments to meet their customers’ just-in-time ship­
ping strategies. In the past, Con-Way dispatchers used 
the common industry model. This approach, how­
ever, was labor intensive and required the dispatchers 
to handle complex logistics, including assigning de­
liveries to over 400 locations, ensuring overnight, on-
time delivery, assigning loads to optimize utilization 
of trailer space, developing efficient routes including 
consideration of bad weather, highway hazards, and 
other complications. To assist dispatchers in these 
duties, Con-Way implemented an expert system to 
aid in the scheduling process. The system was de­
signed to optimize routing, loading, and delivery 
while minimizing costs. The system is constantly up­
dated throughout the day and flags discrepancies so 
that the dispatcher can resolve issues before the truck 
is loaded. Con-Way’s expert system for dispatchers 
takes into account multiple factors including elapsed 
time, delivery times, and customer priorities that 
factor into route specifications. The expert system 
uses artificial intelligence to develop an optimal solu­
tion for loading and scheduling. By using the expert 
system, dispatchers can perform duties in minutes 
that used to require hours. As a result, they are able 
to accept customer orders later than was previously 
possible. The system, which cost over $3 million, paid 
for itself within two years of implementation.
Group Decision Support Systems
In addition to the types of decision support systems 
discussed above, there are also group decision sup­
port systems. These systems enable workgroups to 
process and interpret information together even 
when they are not physically collocated. These sys­
tems use network and communications technologies 
to foster collaboration and communication in sup­
port of decision making. Communications-driven 
systems rely heavily on communications technology, 
including groupware, video teleconferencing, and 
electronic bulletin boards.
Like other decision support systems, group sup­
port systems support decision making in situations 
that are not fully structured and assist in analyzing 
problems. However, group support systems are used 
by workgroups or teams rather than by individuals. 
To maximize effectiveness, group support systems 
emphasize communication and idea generation be­
tween and among group members throughout the 
system using communication networks. Group sup­
port systems typically require the involvement of a 
facilitator to keep the group focused on the problem 
under consideration and to help expedite the devel­
opment and sharing of creative solutions. This shared 
information is input into a database rather than a tra­
ditional report, and includes questions, comments, 
and ideas from the group.

one of their biggest customer segments. Periodically, 
Marriott assembles teams of personnel from various 
groups involved in providing service to these cus­
tomers, including managers, housekeeping, front-
desk personnel, catering, room-service coordinators, 
and bellhops. These representatives exchange ex­
periences and ideas via the group support system in 
an effort to improve service to this market segment. 
Inputs are made anonymously so that comments can 
be made frankly.

Enterprise Resource Planning
ABSTRACT
This essay investigates the topic of Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) and ways that ERP sys­
tems are being used in today’s complex business 
environment. There are two critical requirements 
in the Enterprise Resource Planning process: 
Identification of key business processes and func­
tions and implementation of ERP software that will 
serve as the architecture for those processes. ERP 
systems can greatly enhance organizational effec­
tiveness by connecting a company’s business units 
internally as well as externally to customers and 
vendors. Many organizations have benefited greatly 
from implementing ERP systems and some “best 
practices” are reviewed. In other cases, organiza­
tions have under-utilized their ERP systems or have 
struggled with successful deployment. The next 
generation of ERP systems promises to be web-based 
and highly customizable as ERP is adopted by an 
even more diverse industry base.
OVERVIEW
The rise of global corporations has meant that or­
ganizations need to implement enterprise-wide sys­
tems for linking core operations and business units. 
Organizations have learned that their business units 
often need access to the same information but at dif­
ferent times during the product/service lifecycle. 
ERP systems are large, integrated software packages 
that offer solutions for administrative (back end) and 
core business processes (Fuβ, Gmeiner, Schiereck, & 
Strahringer, 2007).
ERP systems allow for integration on the data and 
functional levels in a way that aims to avoid data re­
dundancy. In today’s global economy, companies 
can also benefit by allowing partners, vendors, and 
­customers access to some internal information; ERP 
systems lend themselves well to this capability.
“An ERP system is [defined as] an integrated, con­
figurable, and tailorable information system which 
plans and manages all the resources and their use in 
the enterprise, and streamlines and incorporates the 
business processes within and across the functional or 
technical boundaries in the organization. With ERP, 
an enterprise can automate its fundamental business 
applications, reduce the complexity and the cost of the 
collaboration, force the enterprise itself to take part 
in the Business Process Reengineering (BPR) to op­
timize its operations, and finally result in a successful 
business” (She & Thuraisingham, 2007, p. 152).
ERP systems have their roots in the manufacturing 
sector of the 1960s, when centralized computer systems 
for inventory control were being developed. By the 
1970s, MRP (materials resource planning) systems were 
being designed to define manufacturing requirements 
and production planning; throughout the next decade 
they were optimizing the manufacturing process.
In the 1990s the ERP concept was introduced and 
referred to enterprise-wide (cross-functional) systems 
that included core operations and processes such as

 Accounting and finance

 HR

 Project management

 Inventory management

 Product distribution
Early ERP systems were expensive to implement and 
maintain, but the cost has come down as service 
oriented architecture (SOA) and web services have 
helped to ease implementation. The majority of all 
Fortune 1000 manufacturing companies have imple­
mented ERP systems. ERP systems have now been 
adopted in many diverse industries, such as banking, 
insurance, health care, and higher education. ERP 
is considered to be “the price of entry for running 
a business” (Kumar & van Hillegersberg, 2000). 
Comprehensive reviews of later ERP implementation

were conducted by Shaul and Tauber (2013) and by 
Nazemi, Tarokh, and Djavanshir (2012).
APPLICATIONS
Why Implement an Enterprise Resource Planning 
System?
Companies do not take lightly the decision to imple­
ment major software applications such as ERP. The 
following list can serve as a sanity check for companies 
who are thinking of implementing an ERP system. 
Research indicates that many companies purchase ERP 
systems and then fail to fully use the application. One 
of the best things that senior executives can do before 
authorizing the purchase of an ERP is to realistically de­
termine if the system will meet the following objectives.
Some of the documented benefits of imple­
menting ERP systems (Fuβ, Gmeiner, Schiereck, & 
Strahringer, 2007):

 increased revenue and market share

 product differentiation

 shortening of post-merger integration by twelve to

ERP Solutions in Today’s Organization
ERP has been a widely accepted business practice since 
the 1990s. Vendor ERP systems allowed for enterprise 
integration of many core functions that are a part of 
many organizations, regardless of industry. Companies 
in industries as different as manufacturing and insur­
ance share common functional areas, such as human 
resources, accounting, and project management. 
Generic administrative (back office) functions are 
one part of an ERP system that has been successfully 
implemented by companies. The other part of the ERP 
system handles the core-business processes and is highly 
dependent upon the nature of the specific industry.
ERP system vendors (such as SAP and Oracle) are 
facing challenges in several areas as their products 
evolve to serve ever more specialized industries with 
their more generic applications. Some of the chal­
lenges that ERP system vendors have faced face in­
clude (Katz, 2007) the following:

 Vendors struggled to make their suites web ser­
viceable.

 Service oriented architecture relegated ERP sys­
tems to a component of system architecture rather 
than a core application.

 Vendors faced growing pressure from cheaper off­
shore vendors who could develop cheaper, more 
customized options (commodity pieces of ERP)

 Vendors offered split models of ERP systems

 Generic offerings, such as accounting or human 
resources, became available.

 Specialized services were offered via middleware 
applications
ERP systems have been most threatened by SOA, 
which have been introduced in large organizations. 
Large companies have more money and resources to 
implement middleware solutions and build sophis­
ticated applications on top of their ERP backbone. 
Small companies still use vendor ERP systems and 
rely on vendor upgrades to add functionality at the 
functional level. As more small and medium enter­
prises (SMEs) adopt ERP systems, vendors will offer 
more middleware to allow for customization.
The Future of ERP Systems
The high cost of implementing the ERP processes and 
systems is well documented. The purchase of the ap­
plication, maintenance costs, upgrade costs, training, 
and IT support are just a few of the costs associated 
with implementing an ERP system. ERP systems serve 
as the core process infrastructure for many companies; 
in other companiess, the ERP system will serve as a pro­
cess backbone for a larger service-oriented architecture 
system. In either case, the investment in ERP systems is 
significant for companies, but should provide a high 
return on investment in improved business results.
Kugel argues that companies would be well advised 
to “establish steering committees with senior-level 
authority to ensure that they are examining the IT 

Enterprise Resource Planning

dimension of their pressing business issues, finding 
opportunities to improve business processes through 
technology initiatives and setting priorities for imple­
menting these solutions. This sort of collaborative ef­
fort could go along way toward identifying opportuni­
ties and implementing innovations that will improve 
a company’s results” (Kugel, 2007, p. 46).
As business needs evolve and core processes are 
connected through automation, the following have 
become components of the next-generation of ERP 
systems (She & Thuraisingham, 2007).
Systems are now

 heterogeneous (components from different ven­
dors will coexist in the system; components and 
integration are necessary).

 collaborative (the systems include enterprise-cen­
tric processes and collaborative [partner/vendor] 
processes, and interfaces are web accessible).

 intelligent (ERP systems hold more confidential 
information that is used for analysis, strategy plan­
ning, and investigation).

 knowledge-based (analytics from the system sup­
port daily business decision-making, including 
knowledge-based operations, management, and 
communication).

 wireless (web-based ERPs are accessible from mo­
bile locations).
Next generation ERP systems have been designed 
with an emphasis on flexibility and scalability. Fast 
changing business needs, industry consolidation, 
and rapidly evolving technology all play a role in the 
design of future enterprise-wide systems. Companies 
aredeveloping tools to increase productivity, decrease 
product time to market, and encourage collaborative 
processes within their supply chains. Companies are 
anxious to implement systems that will meet their 
business needs for a decade or more.).
Web Services & ERP
The relentless march of software applications to the 
web has included the migration of ERP systems to 
web-based platforms. Today’s large organizations are 
likely to continue to build layers of web-based appli­
cations and middleware applications on top of ERP 
backbones.
“With ERP systems progressively making use of 
web service technology and their transformation 
into systems based on service oriented architectures, 
they turn into open application backbones that can 
flexibly be extended and integrated” (Fuβ, Gmeiner, 
Schiereck, & Strahringer, 2007, p. 169).
One of the biggest motivations for moving ERP 
systems interfaces to the web is that web services help 
to reduce integration complexity and costs. Clients 
(vendors, customers, suppliers) can also access some 
information without having to go through ERP soft­
ware. ERP vendors are introducing middleware solu­
tions that act as a “broker between Web services and 
the ERP software” (She & Thuraisingham, 2007). 
The key point is that these business processes have 
to be connected across organizations for a business 
to succeed in supply chain management. These pro­
cesses are interorganizational.
Web-based access to ERP systems allow a compa­
ny’s vendors and partners to access company data. 
One example of the value of web-based access is docu­
mented by Volkswagon Corporation. Volkswagon pro­
vides millions of users (internal and external) across 
its supply chain with access to its corporate data.
Issues
Fully Utilizing ERP Systems
ERP systems represent a significant capital investment 
for most organizations, but too often companies are 
not leveraging the full capability of the applications. 
Most companies have achieved only simple process 
efficiencies and have not fully tapped the full power 
of their ERP systems. “The Hackett Group found that 
the cost of running the average finance organization 
shrank by nearly half during the 1990s; this achieve­
ment can be attributed largely to the nearly universal 
adoption of ERP systems over that period” (Kugel, 
2007, p. 45).
Accounting modules have long been a core func­
tion of ERP systems and are widely used by many 
different organizations. The capture of specific op­
erational data is not as widely recorded within ERPs, 
and this represents a missed opportunity for many 
organizations.
“ Many companies are not using nonfinancial met­
rics to improve performance, either because they ig­
nore data they already collect or they fail to collect 
the data their ERP system is capable of delivering” 
(Kugel, 2007, p. 45).
Perceptions by executives as to the value that 
ERP systems bring to an organization may be one 

Principles of Business: Management
Enterprise Resource Planning
109
of the biggest obstacles to successful full-scale ERP 
system optimization. Without complete support 
and buy-in from C-level executives to drive orga­
nizational effectiveness through ERP implementa­
tion, the systems will never realize their full poten­
tial. “If there is no attempt to make better use of 
ERP software because executives do not believe it 
will produce results, then it cannot deliver those 
enhancements” (Kugel, 2007, p. 45). If the deploy­
ment of ERP systems is not made a strategic initia­
tive within an organization, individual business 
units could see it as “someone else’s job to find new 
and better ways to use the software to improve the 
effectiveness and productivity of their organiza­
tion” (Kugel, 2007, p. 45).
There is certainly an opportunity for IT depart­
ments to play a more strategic role in showing the 
value of optimizing software applications such as ERP 
systems. Business leaders may not even be aware of 
the value that such a powerful software application 
can have for solving critical business issues. Leaders 
in the IT department can use such opportunities to 
position themselves and their departments as key 
business partners.
Using IT to Drive Innovation & Implementation for 
ERP Systems
Mergers and acquisitions within industries can pose 
challenges to companies who desire to customize 
their existing ERP systems. In 2006, Mittal Steel 
merged with one of its competitors, Arcelor, to form 
the world’s largest steel company. Corporate mergers 
offer opportunities for companies to evaluate organi­
zational practices, and consolidate systems and pro­
cesses. One of Mittal’s core applications was an ERP 
system by SAP. The company initiated a project to 
standardize business processes into one world-wide 
ERP system.
After nearly a year of analysis, Mittal Arcelor de­
cided that trying to organize all business processes 
into one ERP system would actually be too difficult 
to implement in a reasonable time frame. Executives 
at the company realized that resources put into 
such a huge project might actually pose a threat to 
the company’s ability to deliver on its core business 
objectives.
“We have dropped the idea of having one process 
model at group level because it was too complex and 
there was too high a diversity in business models and 
intrinsic complexity in the different segments,” said 
Patrick Vandenberghe, group CIO at Arcelor Mittal 
(Clark, 2007). Mittal Arcelor decided to standardize 
the company’s business processes into ten distinct 
business units (by market and geography). Instead 
of integrating the ten distinct business units into 
one single ERP system, the company maintains seven 
global SAP competency centers. The smaller ERP sys­
tems share experiences, resources, and applications 
across the company.
Vandenberghe said “Arcelor Mittal’s goal was to buy 
the entire supply chain for steel manufacturing, from 
raw materials to finished products, but these processes 
could not always be integrated” (Clark, 2007). The 
idea of deploying a single ERP system was a worthy one, 
but had been described as a “mammoth one.” AMR re­
search director Jane Barrett stated “Companies such 
as Arcelor Mittal, which grow through acquisition, 
change their structure as they go along and are rarely 
able to put in a single instance of SAP because it takes 
too long. The managing value chain overtakes the ad­
vantage of having a single system.”
Security for ERP
Increased user interaction, storage of more confiden­
tial information, and a move toward web-based ser­
vices all add to the complexity of managing security 
across enterprise applications. Security control will 
continue to be increasingly difficult and time con­
suming to maintain and update; system administra­
tors will spend much time trying to keep up. In ad­
dition, the more detailed the security information is, 
the higher the cost and the worse the performance 
for the system. Detailed user information will be 
logged in reports. The double-edged sword of secu­
rity can be summed up in the following statement: 
“Usually better [security] solutions will bring higher 
cost and lower performance to a system” (She & 
Thuraisingham, 2007).
Today’s security solutions are primarily based on 
role-based access control. RBAC components are

 permissions: Allows access to one or more objects 
within the system.

 roles: Assigned typically by job function within an 
organization.

 users: The person (employee) who is assigned one 
or more roles.

 constraints: The role-to-permission assignment.

Enterprise Resource Planning
Principles of Business: Management
110
As the complexity of enterprise systems grows, so 
will the need to implement more complex security 
solutions for managing user access to key data.
Extended RBAC (ERBAC) is the next iteration of 
role-based security permissions. Two additional pa­
rameters have been added to the traditional RBAC 
predicates:

 obligation: The mandatory requirements required 
by user.

 condition: The environmental or system require­
ment (for example, time, date, location).
She and Thuraisingham explain that “In this 
ERBAC model, an extra decision manager is added 
since obligation and condition predicates will be 
taken into account. In the decision process, condi­
tion requirements will be checked first; if all the 
environmental conditions are met, the checking 
procedure for the obligations will be triggered; and, 
at last, the decision process will check whether the 
user is intended to access the information” (She & 
Thuraisingham, 2007, p. 160).
CONCLUSION
This discussion of ERP and systems implementation 
reveals that ERP systems are being implemented 
across many organizations as standard enterprise 
applications. Companies see the necessity of linking 
internal processes and capturing relevant data and 
statistics at critical links in order to assess opera­
tional efficiencies. ERP systems, once found almost 
exclusively in the manufacturing sector, are now be 
implemented across a variety of industry sectors, in­
cluding insurance, banking, higher education, and 
health care. As nonmanufacturing sector industries 
embrace ERP systems, vendors will need to continue 
offering customized solutions for niche markets.
Web-based delivery of ERP system solutions will 
continue unabated as companies seek to enable col­
laborative access to systems and data. Large organi­
zations will customize web-based delivery by pur­
chasing middleware solutions to link ERP and SOA 
architectures. The next generation of ERP systems 
is being developed with scalability, flexibility, and se­
curity in mind. There are many documented exam­
ples of best practices of implementing ERP software 
solutions, and companies can benefit greatly from 
enterprise-wide planning and support for such ini­
tiatives. Companies that are about to undertake the 
ERP process or purchase software applications would 
do well to investigate what has worked well for other 
companies in their industry. ERP systems have been in 
existence for decades in one form or another; due dil­
igence in learning from organizational successes and 
failures will go a long way in helping organizations to 
successfully implement ERP systems and processes.

Enterprise Risk Management
ABSTRACT
This article examines the development of Enterprise 
Risk Management (ERM) processes and systems. The 
types of risks addressed by ERM are explained along 
with how enterprise risk analysis can assist boards 
of directors, corporate managers, investors, and in­
dustry analysts. The Integrated Framework for ERM 
of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (COSO) is also reviewed. The 
processes and challenges of implementing ERM and 
information systems to support ERM are examined 
along with steps that stakeholders can take to address 
technical and cultural issues. Past experiences in de­
veloping and implementing large-scale systems that 
drive organizational change are also reviewed.
OVERVIEW
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a data in­
tensive process that measures all of a company’s 
risks. This includes providing managers with an 
understanding of the full array of a company’s risks 
including financial risks, investment oriented risks, 
operations based risks, and market risks, as well as 
legal and regulatory risks for all of the locations in 
which a company operates or invests (Peterson, 
2006). Risk can also be a result of political or social 
conditions in locations where a company has opera­
tions, suppliers, or customers (Woodard, 2005). Risk 
to a company’s reputation is also an important aspect 
and element of ERM (Ruquet, 2007).
In each of the risk areas there are two primary 
types of risks that companies face:

 External Risk

 Manufactured Risk
External risk is the risk of events that may strike or­
ganizations or individuals unexpectedly (from the 
outside) but that happen regularly enough and often 
enough to be generally predictable. Manufactured 
risk is a result of the use of technologies or even busi­
ness practices that an organization chooses to adopt. 

Enterprise Risk Management
Principles of Business: Management
112
A technological risk is caused or created by technolo­
gies that can include trains wrecking, bridges falling, 
and planes crashing (Giddens, 1999). Business prac­
tice risk is caused or created by actions which the 
company takes which could include investing, pur­
chasing, sales, or financing customer purchases.
ERM analytical models should encompass both ex­
ternal and manufactured risks which can be identified 
through historical analysis as well as reviews of current 
operations and exposures (“Expect the Unexpected,” 
2009). Once identified, risks can be validated through 
discussions with corporate executives, operations 
managers, production managers, and business unit 
executives. In addition to gaining a better under­
standing of risks these discussions can also provide in­
sight into existing mitigation practices that have been 
designed to reduce specific risk (Muzzy, 2008).
The data intensity of ERM requires risk managers 
to obtain data from numerous sources, test the in­
tegrity and accuracy of that data, and to assure that 
the data is being properly applied and interrupted. 
Assumptions about the models or analytical ap­
proaches behind an ERM analysis must also be care­
fully examined and tested (Cotton, 2009; Vlasenko 
& Kozlov, 2009). The internal audit department can 
help validate some of the financial data used in ERM 
models as well as provide other potentially relevant 
financial information (Gramling & Myers, 2006).
The 2008 economic downturn caught many cor­
porate executives working with analytical models that 
assumed that the housing market would not decline 
so drastically or on such a widespread basis (Korolov, 
2009). Clearly the assumptions and the analytical 
model had not undergone stringent enough testing. 
However, most risk managers had also not previously 
seen the convergence of negative economic trends 
occur so quickly and across so many sectors simulta­
neously (Morgan, 2009).
Putting ERM to Work
The ERM process is designed to enable corporate ex­
ecutives as well as investors to quantify and compare 
risks and to gauge the overall health of a company 
(Coccia, 2006; Panning, 2006). Investment advisors, 
institutional investors, and credit rating agencies are 
adding to the pressure for companies to develop ERM 
systems and disclose their risks (Karlin, 2007). ERM 
enables top managers of a company to aggregate, pri­
oritize, and effectively manage risks while enabling 
business-unit managers to improve decision making 
in operations and product management (Kocourek 
& Newfrock, 2006). In managing risks there are sev­
eral options that corporate executives can take in­
cluding accepting, preventing, mitigating, transfer­
ring, sharing, or avoiding the risks (Woodard, 2005).
The ERM process can also support strategic plan­
ning activities as well as provide insight into alterna­
tive business practices and goals (Millage, 2005). One 
of the biggest challenges in implementing ERM strat­
egies is to make sure that selected analytical methods 
are appropriate for the type and size of organization 
to which they are being applied (Milligan, 2009). 
ERM strategies and models as well as the utilization 
of ERM analyses will vary with corporate culture, 
business goals, and risk management objectives. This 
means that a one-size-fits-all approach towards ERM 
is not likely to be successful (Lenckus, 2006).
The Push for ERM
Although many companies have used ERM over the 
last decade, the economic downturn of 2008 showed 
that some companies had not done well when it came 
to managing their risks (Korolov, 2009; McDonald, 
2009). In some of these situations it is entirely possible 
that corporate executives were not taking newly devel­
oped models of risk analysis as seriously as they should 
have (Lenckus, 2009). However, the attention paid to 
risk analysis and the ERM concept is changing as more 
and more companies attempt to recover from the 
downturn and better plan for the future (Hofmann, 
2009). There is also a growing advocacy base for using 
ERM to help manage companies through all phases of 
business cycles (Van der Stede, 2009)
In addition to pressure from the investment com­
munity, corporations also face new legal requirements 
that have increased the interest in ERM. After Enron, 
WorldCom, Tyco, and other large business failed, the 
United States Congress passed the 2002 Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Sarbanes-Oxley addressed risks related to 
financial reporting issues. Sections 302 and 404 of 
the act have spurred considerable interest in ERM. 
Section 302 mandates disclosure controls and proce­
dures so that companies could disclose developments 
and risks of the business and section 404 requires an 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting (Barton, Shenkir & Walker, 2009).
The United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) has also implemented requirements 

Principles of Business: Management
Enterprise Risk Management
113
for publicly traded companies to disclose risk factors in 
section lA of their 10-Ks. The SEC and Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) also developed 
Section 404 guidance that supports top-down risk as­
sessment that holds boards of directors more account­
able for oversight of company operations (Stein, 2005; 
Barton, Shenkir & Walker, 2009).
In September 2004, the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 
published its Integrated Framework for ERM. The 
framework identifies four types of objectives for ERM:

 Strategic,

 Operations,

 Reporting, and

 Compliance.
In addition, organizations are charged with ex­
amining eight components for each of the four 
objectives:

 Internal environment,

 Objective setting,

 Event identification,

 Risk assessment,

 Risk response,

 Control activities,

 Information and communication, and

 Monitoring (Bowling & Rieger, 2005a, p. 31; 
Wheeler, 2009).
A summary as well as detailed information about 
the COSO framework is available at www.coso.org.
Thus, the stage is set and the pressure is on for orga­
nizations to use ERM to gain greater insight into com­
pany-wide risk. But it may not all be that easy. Even after 
ERM systems are in place the analysis they render must 
then be applied to the business decision making pro­
cess. Even at that point, it will require an added dose of 
knowledge, wisdom, and experience to develop a com­
petitive strategy and support that strategy with rational 
day-to-day business management skills before ERM be­
comes an integral part of a company’s success formula.
APPLICATIONS
Implementing ERM
As companies begin to implement ERM processes 
and systems the most important decisions they face 
is to decide who will be in charge of the ERM pro­
cesses and systems and where in the organization 
the structure the ERM function will be placed. Many 
companies have opted to create a position of chief 
risk officer (Wheeler, 2009). This trend has created 
new career paths for those interested in risk manage­
ment, especially those that are interested in working 
in the highest levels of organization management 
(Branham, 2006).
Establishing an effective risk management orga­
nizational structure also requires that the risk man­
agement department or director be provided an 
adequate degree of independence similar to that of 
an internal auditor. This includes the ability and the 
resources to build an ERM information system that 
can support data collection, information-gathering, 
modeling, and risk analysis (Shan, Xin, Xiaoyan & 
Junwen, 2009).
ERM staff also need to develop a broad knowledge 
of the company in which they work and cultivate re­
lationships with key players in all parts of the com­
pany in order to promote risk management (Loghry 
& Veach, 2009). Once relationships are established 
they must be maintained through continuous, mean­
ingful, and understandable communications re­
garding the company’s risks. ERM staff may also need 
to develop new skills and will always need to keep 
their skills and knowledge base updated through 
continuing education and training in the risk anal­
ysis and risk management fields (Zaccanti, 2009).
Corporate executives who are responsible for 
directing risk analysis need to have enough influ­
ence in their organization to gain the attention 
and respect of other executives (Baker, 2008). The 
quality of risk analysis and the sophistication or 
risk inventories and projections may help to per­
suade corporate executives that there is value to 
the ERM processes, systems, and staff (Johnson & 
Swanson, 2007).
ERM staff also need tools to help them crunch 
through the vast amounts of data that can be used 
to support risk analyses. The marketplace for appli­
cations software programs is beginning to emerge 
and ERM staff are faced with selecting from tools that 
may have had little actual real world use (Lenckus, 
2006; Ramamoorti & Weidenmier, 2006). Tools and 
people cost money and if ERM programs are not ad­
equately funded results are likely to be anemic at best 
(Panning, 2006).

Enterprise Risk Management
Principles of Business: Management

Back to Basics in Information Management
The fundamental principle behind ERM is that it is 
designed to take a broad and comprehensive view 
of risks and focus on the basic causes and effects 
that can keep companies from achieving their stra­
tegic business goals (Loghry & Veach, 2009). Some 
analysts view this as a departure from the past when 
risk management was depicted as a fragmented, silo-
ridden function in most organizations (Bowling & 
Rieger, 2005). However, ERM systems of this scope 
are largely based in information creation and analysis 
and thus the basic rules and processes of information 
management apply to ERM systems just as they do to 
any other information system.
Database Software
There are four basic steps to business data 
management:

 Data creation,

 Data storage,

 Data processing, and

 Data analysis.
A considerable amount of data is created through 
every-day business processes such as production of 
items, consumption of supplies or resources, sales 
of goods or services, and customer service activities. 
The primary tool for processing and managing such 
large amounts of data is database software. Database 
software is used in virtually all industries especially 
those that are transaction focused and need to track 
large quantities of items or activities. Enterprise 
storage systems are capable of storing vast amounts 
of data and modern storage management tools have 
eased many of the problems associated with this task.
Complex data analysis, beyond what database soft­
ware provides, has become essential to manage large 
organizations and may be more essential in ERM. 
This type of data analysis can be performed with a 
variety data mining, statistical analysis, and decision 
support software packages. This software helps man­
agers and analysts compile or create statistics on mil­
lions of business transactions. These statistics can 
support business forecasting and planning efforts as 
well as ERM analysis.
Data analysis software has evolved over the last 
60 years. For decades most such software was rather 
cumbersome and required custom programming. 
In the 1970s decision support systems (DSS) were 
introduced that provided assistance for specific de­
cision-making tasks. While DSSs can be developed 
for and used by personnel throughout the organi­
zation, they are most commonly employed by line 
staff, middle level managers, and functional area 
specialists. Among the latest developments are ex­
pert systems, which capture the expertise of highly 
trained, experienced professionals in specific 
problem domains.
In the 1990s executive information systems (EIS) 
or executive support systems (ESS) were being de­
veloped in large organizations. At first these systems 
were cumbersome and most were stand alone systems 
requiring time consuming data entry processes. As 
expected, the technology for EIS has evolved rapidly, 
and new systems are more integrated with other appli­
cations like the DDS or Enterprise Resource Planning 
(ERP) systems (Watson, Rainer & Koh, 1991).
Information System Development Life Cycle (ISDLC)
Regardless if the ERM team is going to use off-the-
shelf products such as DSSs or an EIS or develop 
their own in-house applications, they still need to 
apply the Information System Development Life 
Cycle (ISDLC) model to implementation. The tradi­
tional and well established approach to the ISDLC is 
that a development project has to undergo a series 
of phases where the completion of each is a prereq­
uisite to the commencement of the next and where 
each phase consists of a related group of steps. The 
general scheme for the ISDLC is similar almost ev­
erywhere. It typically contains four major phases con­
sisting of several steps each:

 Definition Phase: consisting of preliminary anal­
ysis, feasibility study, information analysis, and 
system design.

 Construction Phase: consisting of programming, 
development of procedures, unit testing, quality 
control, and documentation.

 Implementation Phase: consisting of user training, 
conversion of old systems to new systems, thorough 
field testing, and then a move to full operations.

 Maintenance Phase: after the system is full opera­
tion updates are made to assure continued opera­
tions as new equipment or upgrades to operating 
systems occur. Enhancements to the system can 
also be made to meet changing user requirements.

Effective management of information systems re­
quirements analysis, and thus the design of appro­
priate systems, is critical to the success of an ERM sys­
tems project. Systems development methodologies 
must be selected and applied based on requirements 
and goals stated by staff who will ultimately use the 
system (Avison & Taylor, 1997). ERM practitioners 
can benefit from these basic information systems 
practices and should look to traditional develop­
ment procedures and processes instead of going it 
alone and trying to reinvent the world of information 
management.
Issue: Overcoming the Hurdles
The last several years have been a rocky road for 
many ERM programs and many have been viewed as 
failures in their early stages. When ERM programs 
are driven by individuals, single divisions or busi­
ness units, or function as silos they do not have the 
ability to bridge with other parts of the company and 
become integrated into the management process. 
In addition, ERM has often been viewed as a costly 
program that takes years to implement and years can 
pass before any real benefits are derived from the 
expenditure of time and money (Chase-Jenkins & 
Shimpi, 2006).
When looking at ERM from the inside, such an 
evolutionary process can be appreciated. However, 
when looking at ERM from the outside, the evolu­
tionary process may be viewed as a lack of maturity 
and easily become a reason for skepticism and mis­
trust by corporate executives (McDonald, 2008; 
Schanfield, 2008). Adding to the turmoil is that many 
of the risk analysis software tools that have come to 
market during the last few years are in their infancy 
and many risk analysts remain skeptical about the 
usability and reliability of the tools (Downes, 2006; 
Leopoulos, Kirytopoulos & Malandrakis, 2006).
There are many nuts and bolts to implementing 
an ERM information system especially when it comes 
to obtaining the data required for risk analysis. In 
many companies silos of data and information have 
evolved in various business units. Some of these busi­
ness units may have been acquired and never fully in­
tegrated into a company’s overall data infrastructure. 
In other cases distance from headquarters or levels 
of contribution to the overall revenue of a corpera­
tion may have resulted in a lack of attention about 
the quality and quantity of data a business unit may 
possess (Hershman, 2007). In many cases it is likely 
that data policies and the development of centralized 
data controls have just not matured (Bryce, 2007).
Another common data and information manage­
ment scenario is that data control, and thus data 
management, is much more important in some parts 
of a corporation than it is in other parts. In a diversi­
fied business environment, for example, some busi­
ness activities may be regulated and have external 
reporting or control requirements (Psica, 2008). 
Thus those responsible for implementing ERM infor­
mation systems need to understand how a company’s 
history, culture, and business sector involvement may 
impact the existence, management, and availability 
of data that is needed for risk analysis (Wu, 2004).
The problems ERM practitioners may face when it 
comes to identifying, collecting, cleansing, and ana­
lyzing data may be frustrating to them but the problems 
are not new to the realm of information management. 
Often adding to this frustration is a lack of guidance 
on how to create an information infrastructure to ac­
complish their goals. ERM practitioners also face the 
challenge of dealing with cultural, organizational, 
and political obstacles to data transformation efforts 
that seem to be almost universal in organizations of all 
types (Fraser, Schoening-Thiessen & Simkins, 2008).
ERM information systems are facing the same 
hurdles as other systems that have required changes 
in procedures, processes, or culture, There are many 
lessons to be learned from the past implementation 
of other large systems. Above all, patience and persis­
tence are keys to the process of implementation. The 
people that have worked on prior large implementa­
tions and who have led change in their organizations 
in the past may very well be among those that can 
help ease the way for the development or acquisition 
and the launch of new information systems to sup­
port ERM.
CONCLUSION
Over the last decade there have been several corpo­
rate financial scandals which were followed shortly 
thereafter by a widespread economic downturn that 
many believe resulted from inaccurate forecasting 
and inadequate risk management. As the age of cor­
porate social responsibility dawns elected officials, 
regulators, and individual citizens all feel a sense 
of rage, partially because many people that were in 

Enterprise Risk Management

trusted positions did not follow their long-standing 
professional codes of conduct to guide their ethics 
and their behavior.
Elected officials responded by passing new laws, 
many regulators remain unspoken about their ac­
tions or inaction, and citizens voiced their opinions 
at the polling place and in the marketplace bringing 
political change and drastic declines in consumer 
spending. The professional organizations, which set 
the codes of ethics for the trusted, also responded by 
supporting a change, in fact almost a revolution in 
how risk will be managed in the business arena.
ERM as a discipline is evolving as tools improve, 
best practices are developed, and staff gain more ex­
perience (Zaccanti, 2009). It is now widely accepted 
that thorough risk management analysis combines 
the best of quantitative and qualitative methods 
and models. Among other things, this approach al­
lows analysts to develop and test scenarios that can 
address specific concerns and test specific assump­
tions. However, these methods only work when the 
company culture encourages alternative perspectives 
to management assumptions and prevailing strategic 
thinking (Rudolph, 2009). To maintain momentum 
ERM staff and corporate executives need a common 
view of the state of ERM as well as a common lan­
guage to discuss risks. This means ERM terms must 
be defined and concepts explained and illustrated 
as the processes and systems evolve (“How Do We 
Broaden…,” 2008).
Winning over corporate executives may require 
continuous communication of examples of the cost 
of risk management failures as well as the potential re­
turns from managing business opportunities in man­
ners that reduce risk but still enable success (Baker, 
2008). Corporate executives need to be shown that 
ERM investments are worthwhile and they need to 
be shown in ways that they understand and which 
they can relate (Panning, 2006). However, commu­
nication is not an end in of itself. To maximize the 
benefits gained from ERM risk analysis should be em­
bedded into the strategic planning process and hold 
a firm place along with market share and profitability 
analysis (Paladino, 2008).
To some extent ERM is a cultural shift (Coccia, 
2005). But the near-term goal is to move executives 
and boards of directors to the point where they 
are convinced that they need ongoing analyses of 
current and future risks (Dickhart, 2008). Beyond 
that, the long-term goal is the development and 
perpetuation of a risk management culture (Jones, 
Santori & Ingram, 2006). ERM staff should rec­
ognize that resistance to change in business prac­
tices has occurred in the past and it is likely that 
it will occur in the future (Ballou & Heitger, 2005; 
Hampton, 2006).
The responsibility for risk management, the 
methods of analyzing and managing risk, and the 
information systems to support risk management 
are all undergoing a radical change. ERM is rap­
idly emerging but in many places it still flounders in 
need of both leadership and tools. The complexity 
of ERM has shocked many boards of directors, cor­
porate managers, and industry analysts. The respon­
sibility for ERM is overwhelming for some and the 
complexity, detail, and expense is overwhelming for 
others. ERM is not a quick fix. It is a change that will 
take time and results will only be accomplished over 
the long term. To achieve the promise of ERM will 
require patience and persistence.

Executive Leadership
ABSTRACT
Leadership is slightly more obvious than it is valu­
able. One can exemplify leadership in a variety of 
ways. Maintaining an awareness of the bodies of 
knowledge on the topic is one among many. With an 
ability to draw from various sources and perspectives 
in a timely manner, an effective leader demonstrates 
preparation and readiness to articulate ideas, to 
specify recommendations, and to convince others of 
rationale soundness. This essay covers transactional 
leadership, transformational leadership, and servant 
leadership and it conveys some tenets from each. In 
addition, it summarizes leadership thought from a 
historical viewpoint. About eighty years ago, most ex­
perts believed that leaders were individuals who were 
born possessing specific characteristics. Those older 
approaches gave way to some seeking to find the 
one best way to lead. More recent thinking suggests 
executive leadership effectiveness depends on the 
degree to which there is a match between style and 
organization of situations. A recent shift in thinking 
holds the potential for emphasizing service over re­
sults. It is likely that service to others will gain impor­
tance given the expected growth of jobs and leader­
ship opportunities in the nonprofit sector. The main 
focal points of executive leadership include mission 
accomplishment, resource acquisition, and external 
affairs. In brief, this essay aims to help readers rec­
ognize some requirements for leadership so prospec­
tive leaders may prepare to act on them.
OVERVIEW
Leadership is both valuable and obvious. Most people 
would probably define leadership according to their 
observations of people with whom they interact daily. 
In terms of the workplace, some of us would agree 
that our managers, supervisors, and executives are 
leaders in a formal sense though they may fall short of 
the leadership we expect to see in them. Fortunately, 
a few of our co-workers and associates with whom 
we enjoy informal relationships fit the leadership 
role better than others who occupy authoritative po­
sitions. The need for leadership is present at every 
level within and between organizations; this essay 
tends to focus on the top level and makes frequent 
references to the nonprofit sector.
Aside from job growth projections, significant dif­
ferences exist between nonprofit organizations and 
governmental or for-profit entities. “To measure its ef­
fectiveness, a nonprofit must ask itself, ‘Are we really 
delivering on our mission, not just meeting budget, 
and are we getting maximum impact from our ex­
penditures?’” (Epstein & McFarlan, 2011). Leaders of 
nonprofit organizations should hold or acquire skills 
that allow them to fulfill missions, acquire resources, 
develop strategies, and navigate external and political 
environments. In short supply, some publications on 
the topic of nonprofit executive leadership are avail­
able and tend to focus reader attention on interactions 
between presidents of the organization and its board. 
It takes time to rise to the top of the organizational 
ladder, yet prospective leaders begin developing their 
skills now rather than later, for the benefits of doing 
so will become more evident with the passage of time 
and through service in diverse settings.
Regardless of the sector(s) in which today’s un­
dergraduates and tomorrow’s leaders seek or will 
find gainful employment, it is likely they may find 
the contents of this essay insightful and informative. 
One of the aims here is to provide content that is ap­
plicable across the landscape of organization types. 
Furthermore, at the very least, readers will finish this 
essay knowing the difference between a manager 
and a leader, or between management and leader­
ship. The current state of knowledge on the topic as­
serts that leadership has more to do with influencing 
others than it does with exercising authority over 
others through title or position. Moreover, that lit­
erature suggests that leaders influence followers and 
vice versa while formal authority often fades away 
into the background. In other words, some scholars 
and practitioners assert that a leader usually gains 
authority because his or her followers are willing to 
lend it. In essence, leaders exist only if they have fol­
lowers and, as we shall discover in the pages ahead, 
some leaders function by serving their followers. 
Indeed, some studies have shown that, for example, 
to improve service quality and maintain customers, 
organizations must ensure their employees’ job sat­
isfaction (Pansoo & Jang-Hyup, 2013).

APPLICATIONS
Through what approaches can one become an 
­exemplary leader? In attempting to answer that ques­
tion, it is interesting to note that a countless number 
of today’s college students and high school students 
are satisfying graduation requirements by earning 
credits for service learning projects, community ser­
vice tasks, experiential learning arrangements, and 
the like. This fact alone may serve to demonstrate 
the immediate and future needs to pursue effective 
leadership through various means. Another fact of 
interest is that the literature on this topic contains 
a lot of material debating whether experience or in­
struction is the most effective approach for learning 
about leadership.
Corporate governance is said to be related to 
corporate performance (Chun-Yao, Zong-Jhe, & 
Chun-Yi, 2013). Taken here as evidence of real ten­
sion between the academic sector and the corporate 
sector on the subject of leadership program effec­
tiveness, corporations and management consultants 
argue from a standpoint that leadership is a topic es­
sentially self-taught. In contrast, business school rep­
resentatives claim those corporate entities offer pro­
grams primarily geared toward issues facing a specific 
firm and industry concluding that they fall short of 
exposing participants to larger environmental con­
texts in which leaders truly operate. Casting those 
arguments aside for the moment, this essay merely 
scratches the surface addressing subjects such as 
leadership traits, styles, and skills and noting the in­
terdependencies among them.
In brief, it is important to assert that personal traits 
are ineffective and leadership styles are irrelevant in 
the absence of skillful communications. Some combi­
nation of them will keep workers and organizations 
moving toward their futures. In the broadest sense, 
an organization is by definition a group of individ­
uals who come together to share responsibility for 
achieving three general goals common across the uni­
verse of organizations: Growth, stability, and survival.
One of the challenges an executive faces is how to 
channel individual energy and group activities toward 
goal achievement and how to maximize performance 
levels and improve output and service qualities. In es­
sence, organizational results are a function of leader­
ship skill development and its perpetual application 
to challenging situations. As the reader will see, there 
are a variety of approaches and perspectives on how 
executives and their subordinates can pursue and 
meet those challenges. A good place to begin is with 
an overview of various perspectives on leadership. By 
understanding those perspectives, readers will find 
themselves prepared and ready to handle a variety of 
situations they might encounter during the course of 
their personal or professional livelihoods.
Leadership Foundations & Perspectives
Able to borrow from various perspectives in a timely 
manner, an executive leader must be ready to articu­
late ideas, to specify recommendations, and to con­
vince others that the underlying rationale is sound. 
Those analytical and communication skills also arise, 
in part, due to the leader’s exposure to opportunities 
for interactions with highly respected leaders. In ad­
dition, the number of interactions and those abilities 
are a result of the passage of time because individuals 
will accumulate experiences and encounter a variety 
of settings as they tend to their personal and profes­
sional lives. In the process, leadership learning will 
occur as they sharpen their self awareness and recog­
nize the influences they have on others.
According to Chester Barnard, leadership is the 
ability of a superior to influence the behavior of a 
subordinate or group and persuade them to follow 
a particular course of action. In addressing the topic 
of executive leadership, it is necessary to introduce 
readers to the primary responsibilities or functions of 
executives. In his classic book Functions of the Executive 
(1968), Barnard outlines those responsibilities. Many 
recognize them in abbreviated form as POS-D-CORB, 
which is a device by which to remember respectively 
the following list of functions: Planning; organizing; 
staffing; directing; coordinating (drops one letter); 
and, budgeting. It may serve students of executive 
leadership well to gain some experience in each in 
addition to memorizing them.
Efficiency & Effectiveness
Barnard also drew attention to the efficacy of organi­
zations at a time when there was a mechanistic-type 
fixation on efficiency. Long before the organic and 
systems perspectives on organizations came into exis­
tence, some problems arose as subunits attempted to 
maximize their own efficiencies in isolation from each 
other. In effect, subunits would look inward, thereby 
creating some operating distance between them and 

Principles of Business: Management
Executive Leadership
125
other subunits and between the organization and 
those on the outside whom it serves. Obviously, it 
takes multiple subunits to deliver a good or service 
to a customer, but the fixation on departmental effi­
ciencies virtually disrupted the focus on deliveries to 
clients, customers, and the like. In sum, the organiza­
tion became highly efficient but it did so at the ex­
pense of becoming highly ineffective. That is, it began 
to lose sight of external demands and it was able to do 
so at minimal cost, a serious problem indeed.
Management scholars and organization theorists 
during the 1970s were asking questions something 
like this: Does it matter if organizations do the right 
thing when there is a prevailing emphasis on doing 
whatever they do at the lowest average cost? Certainly, 
making more of an unwanted item will enhance ef­
ficiency as will cutting the costs of producing that 
item. One could go as far as saying very few leaders 
arise from the ranks of accountants, for instance, who 
typically form and implement cost-cutting measures. 
An inward-looking focus on efficiency will only last 
until another set of problems arises. Consequently, 
an ongoing challenge for executive leadership is to 
provide the right bundles of goods and services at an 
acceptable level of cost.
Drawing a lesson using the example above, cost-
cutting while ignoring market situations may lead the 
organization to produce the wrong bundles at the 
lowest cost, which is probably a situation most orga­
nizations should avoid. Acquisition of additional re­
sources is far more challenging than keeping an eye 
toward reduction of existing expenses. Organization 
survival requires providing, offering, and selling 
bundles that members of society value, want, and 
demand. This means executives should opt for ef­
fectiveness over efficiency whenever given a choice 
between them, especially when the cost-effectiveness 
point remains uncharted and unproven. Efficiency 
and effectiveness are two concepts integral to ad­
vancing Barnard’s notion of cooperative systems.
A systems perspective takes into account charac­
teristics of the internal operation and highlights the 
need to pay attention to the external environment in 
which the organization operates. In brief, a coopera­
tive system of efficiency and effectiveness is required, 
according to Barnard. In addition, he asserts that 
purpose is the unifying and coordinating principle. 
Basic leadership requires individuals who know with 
precision an organization’s purpose whether it is 
generating financial returns at the pleasure of stock­
holders, covering social services at the pleasure of 
stakeholders, or fulfilling other needs and desires.
Values, Mission & Vision
Values, mission, and vision are elements that fre­
quently define an organization’s purpose. Warren 
Bennis, who is a leadership scholar and a former uni­
versity president, pointed out in the late 1990s that 
the foremost responsibility of a leader is defining a 
vision for the organization and then building the ca­
pacity of realizing the vision. Around the same time­
frame, as a temporary point of departure, the shared 
leadership view emerged independently of Bennis 
and from within the context of quality improvement 
in academe. It suggests a durable vision is one that a 
relevant community crafts in concert with a formal 
leader or authority figure. Whatever the method, 
a vision may unite the masses and its fruition is the 
result of bringing people together as they go about 
their work internalizing the vision. In his book On 
Becoming a Leader, Bennis elaborates on the distinc­
tion between managers and leaders.
Three Forms of Leadership
That distinction serves as an introduction to two tra­
ditional and one emergent form of leadership. On 
one hand, transactional leadership takes a short-term 
view in which managers keep an eye on profitability 
and focus on doing things right. Managers typically 
use existing systems, maintain controls, and create 
anguish while striving to answer questions of how and 
when. In contrast, leaders create trust, facilitate in­
novation, and use inspiration as they strive to answer 
questions of what and why. On the other hand, trans­
formative leadership takes a long-term view in which 
leaders keep an eye toward the future and focus on 
doing the right things. The next section presents 
those two basic forms and it resurrects servant leader­
ship theory while covering a few of the conceptual 
and empirical overlaps and distinctions among them.
Leadership thought has come a long way since the 
1920’s and 1930’s when most experts held the view 
that some individuals are born with specific traits 
and innate characteristics that make them natural 
leaders. That trait approach gave way to a style ap­
proach, which represented the continuous attempt 
to define the best way to lead. More recent thinking 
is much broader in scope and seems to signify arrival 

Executive Leadership
Principles of Business: Management
126
at a consensus. Apparently, leader effectiveness de­
pends on the degree to which a leadership style 
matches current and future organization situations.
Transactional Leadership
In a context of the political realm, Burns (1978) in­
troduced transactional leadership and transforma­
tive leadership as a dichotomy into which leaders 
receive classification as being one or the other. That 
seminal work generated a lot of studies and empirical 
results. Some of those scholars, including Bass (1985) 
and others, converted Burns’s original classification 
into a continuum with each form at opposite ends. 
Drawing from those works before them, researchers 
(Bass, 1985; Bass & Avilio, 1990) constructed four be­
haviors typically exhibited through transactional lead­
ership. The first is contingent reward, which refers 
to a focus on resource exchanges. Followers receive 
various types of support and resources in exchange 
for their efforts and performance. The second two 
are variants of management by exception (MBE), 
which may be active or passive in nature. With a focus 
on setting standards, active MBE leaders intervene by 
taking corrective action when it is required whereas 
passive MBE leaders intervene only when problems 
become serious. The last is laissez-faire. It refers to 
leaders who adopt a hands-off approach, allowing fol­
lowers to find their own way to meet organizational 
goals, sometimes avoiding leadership responsibilities 
altogether.
Executive Leadership
The topic of executive leadership represents a brief 
opportunity for departure from transactional leader­
ship theory before arriving into a discussion of trans­
formational leadership. In contrast to the routine 
oriented, transactions view of the workplace, execu­
tive leadership highlights behaviors that create and 
communicate clear direction for the organization’s 
future, for implementing changes in structures and 
processes, and for evaluating critical success factors. 
It is obvious that leaders of effective organizations 
focus on doing the right things, which involves strate­
gies that extend leadership beyond an organization’s 
boundaries and into the external environment. As a 
chapter worthy of further investigation and explora­
tion by readers of this essay, Herman and Heimovics 
(2005) advance the executive leadership concept 
by noting that strategies often cross organization 
boundaries and require political acumen. In short, 
executive leadership focuses on the relevance of ac­
complishing missions and acquiring resources and it 
strikes a close resemblance to transformational lead­
ership theory.
Transformational Leadership
Drawing from the works of Burns and others, Judge 
and Piccolo (2004) constructed four behaviors that 
delineate genuine transformational leadership.

 The first is idealized influence, which refers to 
leaders who form high standards for conducting 
business in a moral and ethical manner, who gain 
respect by doing so, and who receive loyalty from 
followers.

 The second is inspirational motivation, which re­
fers to leaders who articulate a strong vision based 
on ideals and values, thereby generating enthu­
siasm, instilling confidence, and producing inspi­
ration among followers. Frequently, they employ 
symbolic actions and persuasive speeches. Signifi­
cant in their association, when these first two be­
haviors congeal, the result is charisma.

 The third is intellectual stimulation, which refers 
to leaders who challenge the status quo by encour­
aging divergent perspectives and innovative strate­
gies.

 The last is individual consideration, which re­
fers to leader behaviors that involve developing, 
coaching, and consulting followers.
Servant Leadership
It is noteworthy that the year before Burns pub­
lished Leadership, Robert K. Greenleaf (1977) intro­
duced the notion that a servant leader places the 
interests of followers ahead of his or her own. From 
a historical perspective, servant leadership received 
attention from a few researchers who proclaim it is 
a sound theory worthy of further study and applica­
tion. Unfortunately, academic journal references to 
Greenleaf’s works are scant in comparison to those 
of Burns. Nonetheless, the research that is available 
shows that servant-leaders exhibit the following the 
characteristics: listening; empathy; healing; aware­
ness; persuasion; conceptualization; foresight; stew­
ardship; commitment as mentors; and, community 
building. It is rather odd that a servant leader’s mo­
tivation prompts him or her to serve followers as 

Principles of Business: Management

127
opposed to leading them. Until recently, its popu­
larity appears to be greater as a topic more suitable 
for professional workshop and seminar settings than 
for academic settings and college classrooms.
Servant leadership theory is ripe for empirical sup­
port and especially more so now and into the distant 
future. The world of today is emphasizing the impor­
tance of servant leadership as evident in the fact that 
service learning is becoming an integral part of sec­
ondary and postsecondary education. Washington 
(2007) points out that servant leadership theory is a 
subject of growing interest in the leadership litera­
ture. Her research examines relationships of servant 
leadership theory to transformational and transac­
tional theories of leadership.
Some key findings from that original research in­
dicate that servant leadership compares with trans­
formative leadership, contingent rewards, and active 
management by exception (MBE). Conversely, it con­
trasts with passive MBE and laissez faire. These find­
ings hold promise for future leaders as they seek to 
uncover which leadership styles are most appropriate 
where, when, and why. Washington (2007) concludes 
that servant-leaders and transformative leaders share 
a common orientation to people, but the focal point 
of the former is organizational service, whereas the 
focal point of latter is organizational results. These 
findings are both timely and informative.
As one might guess, service to others will gain im­
portance given the growth of jobs and leadership op­
portunities in the nonprofit sector. Executive leader­
ship is likely to evolve naturally through those who 
choose to serve a nonprofit’s need for mission fulfill­
ment and resource acquisition and those who want to 
develop skills enabling them to span boundaries and 
navigate political environments. Until additional re­
sults from studies on servant leadership become avail­
able, the extant body of knowledge on transformative 
leadership seems to be an appropriate source for in­
dividuals aspiring to become tomorrow’s leaders.
Leadership for the Future
As mentioned throughout this essay, the state of the 
art in leadership remains divided over whether prac­
tice or instruction is the best teacher. Academicians 
assert that the ideal environment for leadership de­
velopment is one that teaches students technical busi­
ness and communication skills and helps them gain 
a better understanding of ethics, self-awareness, and 
values. In contrast, practitioners assert that develop­
ment occurs primarily through on-the-job training. 
This begs the question: How, then, do the inexpe­
rienced become leaders? In actuality, leadership 
instruction in college classrooms and in corporate 
workplaces has occurred for the past 50 years, but re­
cent research is beginning to illuminate similarities 
and differences among the various perspectives.
A wide array of sources on leadership is available. 
Many of them focus on developing skills in the fol­
lowing areas: intrapersonal, interpersonal, intercul­
tural, organizational, and nonverbal communications; 
listening; feedback; small group interactions; persua­
sion; public speaking; interviewing; question forma­
tion and articulation. It is obvious that communication 
skills play a vital role not only in type but also in trans­
mission medium. The three major communication 
media are oral, written, and electronic. Those media 
and skills often determine leadership effectiveness.
It takes a lot more than courses, seminars, and 
books to master leadership skills. A scan of docu­
ments or a search over the Internet will produce a 
significant amount of information in a short period. 
An initial pass through some of the course offer­
ings found suggest approaches by which someone 
aspiring to be an executive leader can realize their 
goal. In general, the nature of executive leadership 
involves the ability to serve as a change agent and to 
communicate effectively. More specifically, it involves 
crafting visions and anticipating their consequences 
on an organization. Usually, linkages between orga­
nization performance and executive leadership ap­
pear on a daily or quarterly basis, which illustrates the 
need for preparation and readiness.
Developing a personal leadership plan may pro­
vide benefits to your organization, other leaders, 
and one’s subordinates, for example, is another sug­
gestion one will find during a search. Other points 
include how to garner trust while attempting to im­
plement change all the while avoiding as many pit­
falls as possible during those processes. Still others 
mention the importance of acquiring, interpreting, 
and using information whether it originates from in­
side or outside the organization. Embedded with all 
those suggestions, recommendations, and anecdotes 
are strands of theory intertwined with strands of re­
ality. In essence, leaders will likely serve themselves 
and others well by combining the best that theory 
and practice have to offer. Obviously, this will take a 

Executive Leadership
Principles of Business: Management
128
considerable amount of time to navigate the work, 
readings, and conversations. However, an accelera­
tion of those processes often begins with some initial 
guidance that theoretical frameworks afford.
Whether experience or education is the best 
teacher, a need for outcomes assessment seems to 
exist. Assessment may take the form of using three 
basic steps and asking specific questions.

 First, there is a need for direct observation that 
compares learning outcomes and objectives as 
stated on paper to the contents of seminars and 
assignments. Did teaching occur?

 Second, examinations of participant portfolios 
over time will allow the teacher and the learner 
to see progress and to enhance self-awareness. Did 
feedback occur?

 Lastly, follow-up via open-ended questions may 
reveal individual outcomes providing at the least 
some anecdotal evidence of learning. Did teaching 
and learning occur? Some leadership scholars con­
tend that leaders reach their pinnacle by acting in 
accordance with their values and intuitions.
A large portion of leadership is a function of the spe­
cific time in which we live and the opportunities that 
present themselves. In conclusion, this essay on exec­
utive leadership is time-bound as well though it aims 
to help readers recognize the requirements for lead­
ership. It closes with a list of challenges. Prospective 
leaders need to:

 Gain an understanding of personal strengths and 
weaknesses

 Assure their possession of various traits and quali­
ties; build the capacity to become whatever type of 
leader and to use any type of style that an organiza­
tion needs at a given time

 Hold an interest in honing communication and 
other essential skills

 Develop a dual desire to locate a mentor and to 
become a protégé

 Invoke a constant search for opportunities to prac­
tice leadership
In closing, readers who want to improve their lead­
ership abilities will most likely need to enroll in a va­
riety of courses, workshops, and seminars and work 
toward convening their own as an instructor.

Forecasting Methods for Management
ABSTRACT
Managers frequently need to make decisions about the 
future of the organization. Forecasting is the science 
of estimating or predicting future trends to support 
managers in this process. Forecasting methods can 
be used to provide information to support decisions 
about many aspects of the business including buying, 
selling, production, and hiring. Many statistical tech­
niques are available for use in forecasting. However, 
each is not equally applicable in every situation. In ad­
dition to quantitative methods for forecasting, there 
are also subjective or qualitative forecasting methods 
that are used by many managers. Experienced and in­
sightful managers can take advantage of years of expe­
rience to extrapolate trends in ways that are still not 
possible through the use of quantitative techniques 
alone. As a result, quantitative and qualitative analyses 
are inseparable for most forecasts.
OVERVIEW
Every day, managers are faced with decisions that 
need to be made. Some of these are simple such 
as the routine reordering of supplies or approval 
of timesheets. Others are more complex, such as 
determining how to rate someone in an annual re­
view or determining who should be included in the 
company’s layoffs. Another category of complex 
decision making that managers face is forecasting. 
This is the science of estimating or predicting future 
trends. Forecasting is used to support managers in 
making decisions about many aspects of the business 
including buying, selling, production, and hiring. 
For example, managers need to be able to predict 
the demand for a product or service over a given 
time period. This will allow them make a number 
of other decisions. If there will be an increased de­
mand for the organization’s product, management 
can feel confident that they can meet their financial 
obligations for that time period. However, they may 
also need to hire additional workers, lease additional 
facilities, and acquire or store additional raw mate­
rials or components to meet the increased demand. 
Further, a reasonable forecast about demand can 
also enable the organization to make better strategic 
decisions about where to take the business line in 
the future, whether or not to invest in an additional 
product line, and so forth. On the other hand, if the 
organization knows that there will be a decreased de­
mand for their products or services for the foresee­
able future, they can make other decisions such as 
whether or not layoffs are called for, if the design of 
the product needs to be reconsidered, if the business 
needs to be taken in another direction, and other 
decisions regarding corporate strategy. The ability to 
forecast future events with some degree of accuracy is 
necessary not only for the operation of the organiza­
tion itself but also for all the members of the supply 
chain. The same knowledge about the demand for 
widgets that will affect the widget manufacturer will 
also affect the organizations providing raw materials 
or component parts, storing parts or products, deliv­
ering products, and selling them to the customer. For 
these and other reasons, it is important for successful 
business operations that forecasts be made and that 
these forecasts be as accurate as possible. With good 
forecasts, an organization is able to make decisions, 
develop strategy, and plan for the future.
Deterministic Variables that Affect Operations & 
Profitability
There are a number of deterministic variables for 
which there are specific causes or determiners 
that can affect the operations and profitability of 
a business. A trend is the persistent, underlying di­
rection in which something is moving in either the 
short, intermediate, or long term. Identification

increasing reliance on electronic gadgets may 
mean that a business needs to rethink its strategy 
of ­increasing its emphasis on manual tools. 
Business cycles are continually recurring varia­
tions in total economic activity. These expan­
sions or contractions of economic activity tend to 
occur across most sectors of the economy at the 
same time. For example, several years of a boom 
economy with expansion of economic activity 
(e.g., more jobs, higher sales) are frequently 
followed by slower growth or even contraction 
of economic activity. Seasonal fluctuations are 
changes in economic activity that occur in a 
fairly regular annual pattern. Seasonal fluctua­
tions may be related to seasons of the year, the 
calendar, or holidays. In most situations, for ex­
ample, it would be unwise for a retail store to 
hire holiday workers on a permanent basis rather 
than only for the holiday shopping period.
Determining the Technique for Forecasting
There are many statistical techniques that can be 
used in forecasting. However, each is not equally ap­
plicable in every situation. The first decision a man­
ager needs to make in choosing a forecasting method 
is to determine whether or not there are sufficient 
data available for quantitative analysis. If there are 
not, qualitative methods must be used. On the other 
hand, as shown in Figure 1, if there are sufficient data 
available, there are a number of techniques from 
which to choose. In order to choose the best tech­
nique for the data available, several questions must 
be asked. First, it must be determined whether or not 
there is useful knowledge available concerning the re­
lationships and associations between the various fac­
tors of interest for the forecast. If there are not, then 
the type of data available — cross-section or time se­
ries — is a determining factor in which analysis tech­
niques are most appropriate. For cross-section data, it 
must be considered whether or not the forecast needs 
to assess policy options or otherwise choose between 
alternative courses of action. If not, quantitative anal­
ogies are the most appropriate tool. In this approach, 
managers or other experts identify analogous situa­
tions and these inputs are used to derive the forecast 
(e.g., to determine how many seats are needed in a 
movie theatre in a new development, one could look 
at average data from movie theatres in similar devel­
opments). If, on the other hand, the forecast will be 
used to make decisions between alternatives, a better 
approach would be to employ an expert system. These 
are decision support systems that utilize artificial in­
telligence technology to evaluate a situation and sug­
gest an appropriate course of action. Expert systems 
develop rules for forecasting following the reasoning 
processes used by decision making experts.
Forecasting Techniques Using Time Series Data
If time series rather than cross-section data are avail­
able, other techniques are more appropriate. If there 
is a good knowledge about the subject domain of 
the forecast, rule-based forecasting should be used. 
These approaches use an expert system that uti­
lizes both expert domain knowledge and statistical 
techniques. If there is little or no knowledge about 
the domain, however, other options are available. 
Extrapolation techniques analyze times series data 
in an attempt to forecast future events (see below). 
Neural nets are an approach to artificial intelligence 
in which computer processors are connected in a way 
similar to the connections between neurons. These 
systems are able to learn through trial and error. Data 
mining can also be used for this type of situation. In 
data mining, large collections of data are analyzed 
to establish patterns and determine previously un­
known relationships.

If there is a good knowledge of the relationship 
between variables and the future which is being fore­
cast is unlikely to differ significantly from the past, 
extrapolation, neural nets, and data mining tech­
niques are available. If, however, it is expected that 
the future events being predicted will differ signifi­
cantly from the past, causal models or segmentation 
are better options for analyzing the data and making 
forecasts. In causal models, a combination of theory, 
research, and expert understanding of the domain 
are used to specify the relationships between vari­
ables and make a forecast. Regression analysis is one 
technique frequently used in this situation. However, 
although econometrics has been found to improve 
the accuracy of forecasts in this situation, the use of 
system dynamics has not.
Subjective & Qualitative Methods for Forecasting
In addition to quantitative methods for forecasting, 
there are also subjective or qualitative forecasting 
methods that are used by many managers. These are 
particularly useful when there are insufficient quan­
titative data for analysis or if a decision needs to be 
made quickly. These approaches are used when suffi­
cient quantifiable data are not available for statistical 
analysis and are based on the manager’s experience 
and intuition about a situation rather than on the ap­
plication of mathematics or an attempt to reduce the 
situation to quantifiable terms. There are two major 
disadvantages of the use of qualitative techniques 
for forecasting. First, although some managers have 
good instincts and can make reasonable forecasts 
using subjective methods, quantitative methods are 
less dependent on the insights and experiences of 
one individual and use empirical, verifiable data. 
Second, because they are subjective, the results of 
subjective approaches are typically not reproducible 
because the variables cannot be quantified and ap­
plied to future situations.
This is not to say that qualitative techniques are not 
without merit. Experienced and insightful managers 
can take advantage of years of experience to extrapo­
late trends in ways that are still not possible through 
the use of quantitative techniques alone. In some in­
stances, there are insufficient data to use quantitative 
techniques, necessitating the use of qualitative fore­
casting methods. Even when sufficient data are avail­
able, it is the human being who must decide which 
variables to include in the analysis and who must 
interpret the results of the forecast. Judgment is key 
to determining which data are relevant to the model. 
However, a statistical model or analysis cannot take 
every possible variable into account. Even if this was 
possible, spurious positive results would be seen due to 
the effects of probability alone. Expert judgments are 
essential to determine which inputs need to be con­
sidered during the forecasting process. In addition, in 
many instances, the determination of which analysis 
methodology is most appropriate to use for forecasting 
is a matter of judgment. There are a number of statis­
tical techniques available for model building, analysis, 
and forecasting, many of which are closely related. 
The validity of the result depends heavily on correctly 
choosing the most appropriate analytical method. 
In addition, expert judgments can be helpful in un­
derstanding the situation and giving the manager in­
sight regarding the parameters within which the data 
and subsequent analysis should be interpreted (e.g., 
“given the current economy and our market plan, we 
expect widget sales to rise by two percent over the next 
quarter”). As a result, quantitative and qualitative anal­
yses are inseparable for most forecasts.
APPLICATIONS
One frequently used statistical approach to fore­
casting is the analysis of time series data. These are 
data gathered on a specific characteristic over a pe­
riod of time at intervals of regular length. Unlike ad 
hoc approaches to forecasting where it is impossible 
to tell whether or not the formula chosen is the most 
appropriate for the situation; time series analysis al­
lows one to study the structure of the correlation of 
variables over time to determine the appropriateness 
of the model. The resultant model can be adjusted 
as needed to make it more representative of the real 
world situation.
Goal of Time Series Analysis
The goal of time series analysis is to build a model 
that will allow managers to forecast future needs. 
To do this, one must first specify the parameters of 
the model, including the degree of homogeneity in 
the time series and the order of the moving average 
and autoregressive components of the analysis. After 
the model has been specified, it is next estimated, 
frequently through nonlinear regression. The auto­
correlation function is next examined using a simple 

Principles of Business: Management
Forecasting Methods for Management
133
chi-square test to determine whether the residuals 
are uncorrelated. The model must next be evaluated 
to determine its validity and whether or not it can 
be used to make accurate forecasts. Methods to do 
this include historical simulation starting at different 
points of time. Model building is an iterative process. 
The model can be refined as necessary to make it 
better fit the real world.
Techniques to Smooth out Fluctuation Effects
There are several types of techniques are used to 
smooth out irregular fluctuation effects in time se­
ries data. Naïve forecasting models are simple models 
that assume that the best predictors of future out­
comes are the more recent data in the time series. 
Because of this assumption, naïve forecasting models 
do not consider the possibility of trends, business 
cycles, or seasonal fluctuations. Therefore, the naïve 
forecasting models work better on data that are re­
ported more frequently (e.g., daily or weekly) or in 
situations without trends or seasonality. However, 
care must be taken since naïve model forecasts are 
often based on the observations of one time period 
so they can easily become a function of irregular fluc­
tuations in data.
A second approach to smoothing time series data 
uses averaging models. These models help neutralize 
the problem of naïve models in which the forecast is 
overly sensitive to irregular fluctuations. In averaging 
models, data from several time periods are taken into 
account. In the simple average model, the forecast is 
the average of the values for a specified number of 
previous time periods. Moving averages, on the other 
hand, use both the average value from previous time 
periods to forecast future time periods, and update 
this average in each ensuing time period by including 
the new values not available in the previous average 
and dropping out the date from the earliest time pe­
riods. Moving averages have the advantage of taking 
into account the most recent data available. However, 
it can be difficult to choose the optimal length of time 
over which to compute the moving average. Further, 
moving averages do not take into account the ef­
fects of trends, business cycles, and seasonal fluctua­
tions. To help neutralize these problems, a weighted 
moving average can be used which gives more weight 
to some time periods in the series than to others.
A third approach to smoothing time series data is 
exponential smoothing techniques. These techniques 
use weight data from previous time periods with expo­
nentially decreasing importance. Although all these 
approaches to time series modeling can be helpful 
for simple data sets, they do not account well for 
trends. However, there are several approaches avail­
able that can help managers forecast the influence of 
long-term changes in the business climate, including 
linear regression and regression quadratic models. 
However, the time series data cannot be influenced by 
seasonal fluctuations if these methods are to produce 
accurate forecasts. Otherwise, other techniques must 
be used. One of these is decomposition, in which the 
time series data are broken down into the four com­
ponent factors of trend, business cycle, seasonal fluc­
tuation, and irregular or random fluctuation.
Dealing with Spurious Data
One consideration that must be taken into account 
in the analysis of time series data is the possibility of 
spuriousness occurring as the result of error terms 
of the model being correlated with each other. This 
autocorrelation (or serial correlation) causes prob­
lems in the use of regression analysis because re­
gression analysis assumes that error terms are not 
correlated because they are either independent or 
random. When this situation occurs, the estimates 
of the regression coefficients may be inefficient. 
Further, both the variance of the error terms and the 
true standard deviation may be significantly under­
estimated because of their effect. Autocorrelation 
also means that the confidence intervals and t and 
F tests are no longer strictly applicable. There are, a 
number of ways to determine whether or not auto­
correlation is present in time series data including 
the Durbin-Watson test. Autocorrelated data can be 
corrected through techniques such as the addition of 
independent variables and by transforming variables.
Autoregression Analysis
Another approach to forecasting using time series 
data is autoregression. This is a multiple regres­
sion technique in which future values of the vari­
able are predicted from past values of the variable. 
Autoregression takes advantage of the relationship 
of values in different time periods. In autoregression, 
one tries to forecast a future value of a variable from 
knowledge of that variable’s value in previous time 
periods. The autoregressive approach can be useful 
for locating both seasonal and cyclic effects.

134
Integrated Techniques to Time Series Data Analysis
Another approach to analyzing time series data is to 
use mixed or integrated techniques that utilize both 
moving average and autoregressive techniques. For 
example, the autoregressive integrated moving av­
erage (ARIMA) model (also called the Box-Jenkins 
model) is an integrated tool for understanding and 
forecasting through the use of time series data. 
Although ARIMA models can be difficult to compute 
and interpret, they are powerful and frequently result 
in a better model than either the use of moving aver­
ages or autoregressive techniques alone. They can be 
used to determine the length of the weights (i.e., how 
much of the past should be used to predict the next 
observation) and the values of these weights.

Forecasting Techniques
ABSTRACT
In order to make decisions that will enable an organi­
zation to be successful, managers need to be able to 
predict the needs of the future so that the organiza­
tion can act appropriately in order to gain or main­
tain a competitive edge. Forecasting is the science of 
estimating or predicting future trends. Forecasts are 
used to support managers in making decisions about 
many aspects of the organization including buying, 
selling, production, and hiring. Statistical techniques 
are available to help managers examine the impact of 
trends, business cycles, seasonal fluctuations, and ir­
regular or random events on future needs. However, 
in isolation, these methods are not sufficient for de­
veloping good forecasts. Expert judgment needs to 
be used in combination with statistical techniques in 
order to optimize the effectiveness of each.
OVERVIEW
Since the beginning of written history, human be­
ings have been interested in learning what the future 
holds. From our vantage point in the 21st century, we 
read with bemusement in history books about signs 
and omens and oracles, and wonder why people ever 
thought they could read the future in the entrails of a 
goat. Despite our relative sophistication, however, the 
desire to know the future persists, and we still long to 
know what is going to happen. We listen to the televi­
sion meteorologist to find out whether or not to carry 
an umbrella. We read the business section of the news­
paper to find out the cost of a barrel of oil to determine 
whether we should wait a few days to buy gas or get it 
today. We plan our vacations for sunny climes at times 
when we expect to be knee-deep in snow at home.
Importance of Trends to Business Operations
However, it is not only in our daily lives or in these rela­
tively trivial examples that we need to know what will 
happen. In the business world, organizations need to 
know the trends of the marketplace in order to best 
position themselves to leverage this knowledge into 
profits. The production manager needs to know if 
there will be a continuing need for widgets and how 
much raw material is needed to meet the anticipated 
demand. The marketing manager needs to know 
whether changing demographics in the marketplace 
mean that a new marketing strategy will be needed. 
The shipping manager needs to know whether or not 
the price of oil will continue to rise and how this cost af­
fects the outsourcing for the production of gizmos. The 
human resources manager needs to know whether or 
not the turnover in the organization will continue and 
new sources of qualified employees need to be found. 
To answer these and other questions about the future of 
the business and how best to respond to the changing 
needs of the environment and marketplace, businesses 
rely on forecasting. This is the science of estimating or 
predicting patterns and variations. Forecasts are used 
to support managers in making decisions about many 
aspects of the business including buying, selling, pro­
duction, and hiring. It is part of the responsibility of 
management to determine the goals and direction of 
the organization for both the short and long terms. To 
do this, it is helpful to be able to predict the variations 
of economic activity that may affect the business and 
plan to either leverage these into successes or prepare 
the organization to survive until the next boom.
Causes of Variation in Economic Activity
There are a number of causes of variation in eco­
nomic activity: trends, business cycles, and seasonal 
fluctuations as well as irregular and random fluctua­
tions. Trends are persistent, underlying directions in 
which something is moving in either the short, inter­
mediate, or long term. Many trends tend to be linear 
rather than cyclic, steadily growing (or shrinking) 
over a period of years. For example, in the US there 
is an increasing trend for outsourcing and offshoring 
of technical support and customer service in the high 
tech industry. On the other hand, trends in new in­
dustries tend to be curvilinear as the demand for the 
new product or service grows after its introduction 
then declines after the product or service becomes 
integrated into the economy.
Business Cycles
Business cycles are continually recurring variations 
across the total economy. Such expansions or con­
tractions of economic activity tend to occur across 
most sectors of the economy at the same time. For 

Forecasting Techniques
Principles of Business: Management
136
example, several years of a boom economy with ex­
pansion of economic activity (e.g., more jobs, higher 
sales) are frequently followed by slower growth or 
even contraction of economic activity. Business cycles 
tend not to occur only across one industry or busi­
ness sector, but often occur across the economy in 
general.
Seasonal Fluctuations
Many industries also experience seasonal fluctua­
tions — changes in economic activity that occur in 
a fairly regular annual pattern. Seasonal fluctua­
tions may be related to the seasons of the year, the 
calendar, or holidays. For example, office supply 
stores experience an upsurge in business in August 
as children receive their school supply lists for the 
coming year. Retail stores make a significant portion 
of their profits in the weeks between Thanksgiving 
and Christmas. Travel agencies experience a rise in 
clients in the winter who want to visit warmer climes 
and in the summer for families who need to go on 
vacation when their children are not in school.
Economic Fluctuations
In addition, there are irregular and random fluctua­
tions in the economy that occur due to unpredict­
able factors. For example, natural disasters, political 
disturbance, strikes, and other external factors can 
cause fluctuations in the economy. In addition, 
there are unpredictable or random factors that can 
affect a business’s profitability such as high absen­
teeism due to an epidemic. Although this category 
is by definition difficult if not impossible to predict, 
there are tools available that can help the manager 
recognize and predict the other kinds of variations. 
Identification of a these variations in economic ac­
tivity allows managers to better plan to meet future 
needs and keep the business profitable.
Approaches to Forecasting in Business
There are a number of approaches to forecasting that 
are used in business. Subjective forecasting methods 
are used by many managers, particularly when a deci­
sion needs to be made quickly.
Subjective Approaches
Subjective approaches to forecasting are qualitative 
rather than quantitative and based on the manager’s 
experience and intuition about a situation rather 
than on the application of mathematics or an at­
tempt to reduce the situation to quantifiable terms. 
Depending on the manager and his/her experi­
ence, however, subjective approaches to forecasting 
may or may not be effective. Further, because they 
are subjective, even when they are effective, subjec­
tive approaches are typically not reproducible. There 
is also no way to quantify the variables used in the 
forecasting process so that the process can be applied 
to future situations. The quality of a subjective fore­
casting approach is completely dependent on the 
skill and expertise of the manager using it.
Structural & Economic Model Approaches
A second category of approaches to business fore­
casting are structural and economic models. These ap­
proaches use mathematical and statistical techniques 
to support the development of a forecasting model. 
Structural models are sets of mathematical functions 
that are designed to represent the causal relation­
ships within the organization’s environment. For ex­
ample, if an organization was interested in investing 
in a new venture, it would be helpful to know the fu­
ture price of its current product in order to forecast 
its profits and the resultant availability of funds for the 
new venture. To do this, the manager or analyst might 
build a specification model of the factors affecting the 
supply and demand for the current product and the 
relationship between the factors. There are, however, 
a number of sources of error associated with this ap­
proach to forecasting. First, actual future wages and 
income will more than likely differ from the estimated 
values used in the development of the model. Second, 
the predictive value of the model will be affected by 
the sampling error in the estimates used in the con­
struction of the model. Third, the model may not take 
into consideration some important variable which, in 
turn, could skew the results.
Deterministic Model Approach
A third approach to business forecasting is the use 
of deterministic models. These models assume that 
the variable of interest is a deterministic function of 
time and does not include the effects of any under­
lying data uncertainty or variability in the time series. 
Although this type of model means that the observed 
changes are due solely to changes in the components 
of the model, there are some drawbacks. Perhaps the 
biggest objection to deterministic models is that they 

Principles of Business: Management
Forecasting Techniques
137
assume that the time series used as a basis for the 
model is systematic and highly predictable. This as­
sumption is typically not valid when dealing with real 
life problems, particularly when they are complex.
Ad Hoc Forecasting Formulas
Another approach to forecasting is the use of ad 
hoc forecasting formulas based solely on past his­
tory. This approach typically uses weighted moving 
averages. Although this approach simplifies com­
putation, there is no way to determine whether the 
formula chosen is the most appropriate. This means 
that there can be no concomitant confidence in the 
worth of the resultant forecasts.
Time Series Analysis
A final approach to forecasting is the use of time se­
ries analysis. Time series data are data gathered on 
a specific characteristic over a period of time. To be 
useful, time series data must be collected at intervals 
of regular length. In time series analysis the sequence 
of observations is assumed to be a set of jointly distrib­
uted random variables. Unlike the ad hoc approach 
to forecasting where it is impossible to tell whether 
or not the formula chosen is the most appropriate 
for the situation, in time series analysis one can study 
the structure of the correlation of variables over time 
to determine the appropriateness of the model. The 
model can be adjusted as needed to make it more 
representative of the real world situation.
APPLICATIONS
There are a number of statistical techniques that can 
be used to analyze time series data and forecast in­
dustry or marketplace trends or other factors of in­
terest to the business. Some of these techniques are 
regression models to analyze trends and decomposi­
tion techniques to determine seasonality. Statistical 
methods are not the only important factor in fore­
casting, however. The analyst and decision maker 
both must integrate statistical techniques with 
human judgment in order to maximize the utility of 
time series forecasting.
Trend Analysis
In business, it is often helpful to be able to forecast 
trends in the industry, the supply chain, applicant 
pool, or other factors that affect the ability of the 
organization to do its job. Using time series data, it is 
possible to analyze trends to give managers the infor­
mation that they need to make decisions about the di­
rection the business should take. One of the ways that 
times series data can be analyzed is through the use 
of regression analysis. This is a statistical technique 
used to develop a mathematical model for predicting 
one variable from the knowledge of another variable.
Lumber Industry & Regression Analysis
An example of the use of regression analysis in de­
termining trends comes from the lumber industry. 
Black spruce is the most important source of struc­
tural lumber in eastern Canada as well as the most 
important tree for reforestation. There is currently a 
higher demand for structural lumber than there was 
in the past, and this trend is expected to continue. 
To help the lumber industry better choose trees that 
will meet industry standards for structural lumber, it 
would be helpful to have a model to predict lumber 
grade yield for the black spruce. Liu, Zhang, and 
Jiang used regression analysis to develop a model for 
forecasting lumber grade and yield. A number of tree 
characteristics are important to the yield and quality 
of black spruce lumber including tree size, tree taper, 
stem form, crown size, and branchiness. To help the 
industry better identify trees to meet industry stan­
dards for structural lumber, they developed a model 
to identify the variables that significantly influence 
the yield and quality of black spruce lumber. The 
purpose of this model was to identify which charac­
teristics are most predictive of lumber grade yield 
and help improve the prediction of lumber grade 
yields for the visual grading system.
To develop the model, measurements of various 
characteristics of interest were taken from 139 ran­
domly selected trees. The trees were then processed 
and the quality of the resultant lumber graded. The 
authors used stepwise multiple regression analysis 
to build a model to predict lumber grade and yield 
using these data. The first attempt at model building 
utilized data from all the variables collected. A subse­
quent model was developed that used only those vari­
ables that seemed to be most directly related to yield 
and lumber grade. The latter model proved almost 
as effective as the first model. It was determined that 
either model developed in the study could provide

only forest industry data. These models can aid sig­
nificantly in choosing the trees most likely to have the 
highest yield of lumber and can also be helpful for 
forest management and preservation of black spruce 
supplies.
Seasonal Effects
Another important factor in forecasting is industry 
seasonality. Seasonal effects are patterns that occur 
in cycles of less than one year and that are associ­
ated with time cycles such as the calendar, seasons, or 
holidays. However, seasonal effects are not the only 
source of variability in time series data. As discussed 
above, time series data can also be affected by trends, 
business cycles, and irregular or random fluctua­
tions. To determine the effects of these variables, a 
technique called decomposition is often used. This 
technique allows the analyst to break down time se­
ries data into the component factors of trends, busi­
ness cycles, seasonal fluctuations, and irregular or 
random fluctuations.
Seasonality & the Non-OPEC Oil Supply
An example of the importance of determining season­
ality and the techniques to do so is given in a recent 
study of the seasonality of non-OPEC oil supply. For 
reasons that are obvious at the gas pump each week, 
short-term changes in oil supply are constantly under 
scrutiny by analysts. The perceptions of immediate 
supply have implications not only on energy prices 
but on crude oil transport prices as well. Therefore, 
it is important to forecast oil supply fluctuations as 
accurately as possible. Two-thirds of the oil supply is 
produced by non-OPEC countries. Whereas OPEC 
decisions about supply are coordinated between the 
member countries, this is not true for non-OPEC 
countries. Decisions in these countries are made by 
each producer individually. This fact makes analysis 
of this industry segment particularly important for 
forecasting supply.
There are a number of reasons for seasonality in 
oil supply in non-OPEC countries. These include 
demand for oil, price of oil, stock levels, annual 
maintenance schedule at production facilities, the 
psychology and manipulation of the market, timely 
completion of development projects, as well as irreg­
ular and random factors including severe weather, 
floods, earthquakes, and strikes. There is also a sea­
sonal component to the non-OPEC supply. Cold 
weather in the winter in the northern hemisphere 
where the major consumers are located leads to a 
higher demand for heating oil than in the spring 
months. During the summer, cooling systems and 
vacation travel again raise the demand for oil. The 
resultant seasonal fluctuations in demand for oil 
yield concomitant variations in non-OPEC oil supply. 
Because of this cycle, regularly scheduled mainte­
nance — another seasonal factor in oil supply — is 
frequently scheduled for periods of lower consump­
tion and more temperate weather.
Jazayeri & Yahyai performed an analysis of season­
ality of non-OPEC supply in order to help improve 
the accuracy of short-term supply forecasts. Their 
study was based on the assumption that observed sea­
sonality cycles are independent of other factors and 
that they will continue into the future. To analyze 
the time series data on oil supply in non-OPEC coun­
tries, the authors decomposed the data into the four 
components of trends, business cycles, seasonal fluc­
tuations, and irregular or random variables. Using 
the decomposition technique of Fourier spectral 
analysis, it was found that non-OPEC supply follows a 
seasonal pattern that repeats annually irrespective of 
other trends. These results can be very useful for ana­
lysts forecasting oil supply at various times of the year.
Integrating Statistics & Judgment
Opinion about the best way to forecast for business 
decisions often seems to be sharply divided between 
those that rely on statistical methodology and those 
that prefer to use their “gut” to determine where the 
industry, supply chain, or market is going. However, 
both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. 
Statistical methods are less prone to bias than are 
judgments. In addition, they tend to be more reliable 
and can more efficiently make use of historical data. 
However, statistical techniques can only work with the 
data they are given. Judgmental decision making, on 
the other hand, can be useful particularly when there 
are recent events about which the decision maker is 
aware but which have not yet had sufficient time to 
result in observable data in a time series. This type 
of data includes information about events that have 
happened in the past but are not expected to recur 
in the future or events that will affect the future but 
have not occurred in the past (e.g., the effect of an 
innovation on the marketplace; governmental or in­
dustry policy changes). There are, however, risks with 

Principles of Business: Management
Forecasting Techniques
139
judgmental-only forecasts. Human error may make 
the analyst or manager more optimistic (or pessi­
mistic) than actually warranted, trends or factors may 
be read into the data that are not actually there, or 
the effects of correlated variables may not be taken 
into account.
Three Ways to Integrate Judgment & Statistical 
Forecasting
There are three ways in which judgment can be in­
tegrated into statistical forecasting using time series 
data. First, judgment is key to determining which 
data are relevant to the model. Potential variables 
are virtually unlimited. However, a statistical model 
or analysis cannot take all these into account. Even 
if they could, spurious positive results would be seen 
due to the effects of probability alone. Therefore, it 
is important that expert judgments be used to reduce 
the inputs into the process. Another way in which 
judgment is important in forecasting is the deter­
mination of which statistical technique is most ap­
propriate to analyze the data. There are a number 
of statistical techniques available for model building, 
analysis, and forecasting. Many of these are closely re­
lated. However, the worth of the end result depends 
heavily on correctly choosing the most appropriate 
analytical method. Third, expert judgments can be 
helpful in aiding the analyst to understand the situa­
tion and give insight into the parameters in which the 
data and subsequent analysis should be interpreted 
(e.g., “given the current economy and our market 
plan, we expect widget sales to rise by two percent 
over the next quarter”). Figure 1 shows some of the 
considerations for integrating judgment and statis­
tical methods for forecasting.

Gender & Management
ABSTRACT
This article examines the impact of gender in the 
workplace. The impact of gender on the composi­
tion of the management team is analyzed and cur­
rent trends of women in management are reviewed. 
Changes in the workplace over the last three decades 
as the number of women in the workplace has in­
creased are explained including the emergence of 
the family-friendly workplace. The types of benefits 
offered by family-friendly companies are reviewed. 
Employment statistics on women in the workplace, 
the occupations in which women work, and the salary 
differentials between women and men are presented.
OVERVIEW
Gender presents at least two primary challenges to or­
ganization managers. One is the impact of gender on 
management staffing and the composition of the man­
agement team. This has most often been discussed in 
terms of women moving into management positions 
which has been, and still is in parts of the world, posi­
tions traditionally held by men. The second area of 
impact is in human resource management, which has 
changed how management deals with a mixed gender 
non-management workforce who is now often split 
rather evenly between men and women.
Women in Management
As the society and the economy changes many com­
panies have had to reexamine their workforce com­
position and their hiring practices. One shift that 
has been significant is that more companies have be­
come interested in recruiting and promoting women 
into senior management positions. This provides 
women the opportunity to work their way to the ex­
ecutive levels of many corporations. Women are suc­
ceeding in a wide variety of positions and industries 
traditionally considered inappropriate for women. 
They are also beginning to succeed in areas that have 
historically been male-dominated including manu­
facturing, engineering, and financial services.
Companies are seeking women for senior manage­
ment roles for several reasons. One of the most signif­
icant reasons is that women represent a very large un­
tapped pool of talent. This is especially true for senior 
level positions. Companies that desire to strengthen 
management teams want to remain competitive in a 
rapidly changing marketplace. They recognize that 
by including women in the upper echelons of man­
agement can add new sources of talent and expand 
the perspectives of the management force.
The expanded perspective of the management 
team is achieved because of inherent differences 
between men and women. Many organizations be­
lieve that women bring alternative perspectives to 
the table. The ultimate goal of course, is to gain and 
sustain a competitive advantage for the company. As 
the management team becomes more diverse the 
customers and clients of the company tend to view 
the diversity as positive. It should also be noted that 
women do account for over 80% of all consumer 
spending in the United States. Women now routinely 
buy cars and invest in stocks. They also make the ma­
jority of the family buying decisions. This being the 
case, the input of women at the executive level of a 
company becomes more valuable as well.
When women are on the management team, it 
signals to current and potential employees that the 
organization is changing with the times and is em­
bracing gender diversity. Furthermore, the presence 
of women on the management team can expand the 
perceptions of the market place and helps to ensure 
that existing as well as new business opportunities are 
not overlooked. This is logical in that women con­
stitute a large and rapidly growing consumer base. 
Organizations with a relatively high percentage of 
women executives have come to understand and capi­
talize on gender differences in leadership style and 

Gender & Management

142
management behavior. These companies are also con­
sidered more likely to address actual and perceived 
inequalities in the workplace and have accomplished 
that in part by not leaving gender diversity to chance 
(“Gender and organizational performance,” 2002).
Overcoming Obstacles to Female Advancement
Even though the composition of the management 
work force is changing there still are some issues that 
impede the progress of women. One major obstacle 
for women working at senior executive levels is how 
to overcome the inherent difficulties of balancing ca­
reer and family. Many things in society have changed, 
but it is clear that women remain the primary care­
givers in most societies and probably will continue 
that role. It is also likely that women who become se­
nior managers will also be raising a family and may 
even be caring for their aging parents.
Many companies recognize the dual social role of 
women and there have been many programs imple­
mented to accommodate their needs such as flextime 
schedules and generous maternity leave packages. 
Women know, however, that utilizing many of these 
opportunities can stifle or even derail a career. To im­
prove their return on investment for making these 
opportunities available, many companies have lim­
ited their generosity only to women who have proven 
track records of success within the company. There 
is also a pattern in recruiting executive women from 
outside which shows recruiters and managers alike 
do not actively consider female candidates that are 
likely to make use of these programs.
Many corporate CEOs are white, male, and 60 years 
of age. Some of these men still find it difficult to pic­
ture women like their wives and daughters in senior-
level positions. There could be many reasons for this, 
even including a lack of confidence in their wives and 
daughters. In some industries, competition is heavy 
and business is not always neat and clean. The aging 
CEO may feel that women cannot play aggressively 
enough to win the market. Thus, many older CEOs 
let the bias of their personal experiences guide the 
recruiting process. Many of these CEOs had mothers 
who stayed at home, and many still have wives who 
stay at home and attend to family and social matters.
Another not so subtle discrimination in the ex­
ecutive corps is that male executives may exclude 
women managers from informal activities out­
side the office. These activities tend to strengthen 
business relationships. Season tickets to sporting 
events, for example, may not be offered to female 
vice presidents. This discrimination results in women 
losing important opportunities to build relation­
ships outside the structure of the office environment 
(Landon, 1996).
At lower management levels, women are typically 
placed in non-strategic sectors, in personnel and ad­
ministrative positions, rather than in professional 
and line management jobs leading to the top. Thus, 
women are cut off from networks (both formal and 
informal) essential for advancement within enter­
prises. Unfortunately in some large companies and 
organizations women in high-level managerial posi­
tions such as human resources and administration 
are often considered less vital to the organization. 
This may be because managers tend to work long 
hours in order to gain recognition and even gain pro­
motions (“Women in management,” 1998).
Forces that may be underlying explanations of wom­
en’s inequality in the workplace are the result of struc­
tural barriers, stereotypical assumptions, individual 
choice, and work-family conflict. These issues are 
broad, power-implicated, ideological forces (Gazso, 
2004). The “think manager-think male” attitude still 
dominates many organizations. Research shows that 
managerial and executive-level positions are still male 
sex-typed. Many executives perceive that women do 
not fit in these positions as well as men. Thus one con­
clusion that the research supports is that women are 
considered to be less effective managers than men 
(Bergeron, Block & Echtenkamp, 2006).
Programs for Advancement
Many governments, enterprises, and organizations, 
through policy as well as practice, have committed 
to programs to advance women. Some of these pro­
grams have met with limited success while others 
may have gained a higher profile. Generally, they 
are having a positive effect, especially in influencing 
younger generations of men and women.
The development of detailed training, promotion, 
and career plans in organizations has been shown to 
be an impetus for promoting equal opportunities in 
career progression. This may require specific support 
through networks, coaching, or mentoring. In ad­
dition, these must be continued even during down­
sizing, decentralization, and delayering. (“Women in 
management,” 1998).

Further Insights
Analyzing the Workforce Participation of Women
The workplace faces several challenges in the new 
millennium, among them that employers face a fairly 
serious labor shortage. There will not be enough 
younger people to fill jobs left vacant by retiring 
baby boomers. Estimates on the labor shortage in the 
United States range from three million to ten million 
workers by 2010.
The demographics of the American workforce 
have also changed in the last forty years. In 2013 it 
was reported that 74 percent of American women 
are in the workforce; these women make up approxi­
mately 47 percent of the total labor force. In addi­
tion, in 2012 mother accounted for over 70 percent 
of working women and 40 percent of working wives 
out-earned their husbands.
The modern working woman generally enters into 
the workforce after completing her education, and 
moves in and out of the workforce several times until 
retirement. About three fourths of women work in 
administrative support or as executives, administra­
tors, and managers. Women are obtaining the ma­
jority of bachelor’s degrees and are receiving a high 
percentage of medical, law, and MBA degrees.
There are about 36 million “Generation X” women 
in the United States and over 15 million are mothers, 
according to the 2000 Census Bureau. The Gen-X 
woman has achieved the greatest one-generation 
leap in social and gender equality in American his­
tory. They were the first to enter the legal, medical, 
and business professions in large numbers and per­
centages. In 2006 Gen-X women comprised just over 
50 percent of all workers in executive, administra­
tive, and managerial occupations, and that number 
continued to rise through 2013. At the time, this was 
over 25 percent higher than it was for that age group 
in 1983. Gen-X women work longer hours than their 
elders did and are sought graduate degrees, pushing 
hard for their futures.
In 2006 the breakdown of gender participation in 
the workforce by race was as follows:

 White women: 59.0%

 White men: 74.3%

 Black women: 61.7%

 Black men: 67.0%

 Hispanic women: 56.1%

 Hispanic men: 80.7%

 Asian women: 58.3%

 Asian men: 75.0% (“Employment & earnings,” 
2006).
In 2006, for women who worked full-time, wage 
and salary workers, the ten most prevalent occupa­
tions and number of women workers in each occupa­
tion were:
 Secretaries and administrative assistants (3,348,000)

 Registered nurses (2,309,000)

 Cashiers (2,291,000)
 Elementary and middle school teachers (2,220,000)

 Retail salespersons (1,740,000)

 Nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides 
(1,694,000)

 First-line supervisors/managers of retail sales 
workers (1,436,000)

 Waiters and waitresses (1,401,000)

 Bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerks 
(1,364,000)

 Customer service representatives (1,349,000) 
(“Employment & earnings,” 2006).
Women accounted for 51% of all workers in the 
high-paying management, professional, and related 
occupations. They outnumbered men in such occupa­
tions as financial managers; human resource managers; 
education administrators; medical and health services 
managers; accountants and auditors; budget analysts; 
property, real estate, and social and community ser­
vice managers; preschool, kindergarten, elementary, 
middle, and secondary school teachers; and registered 
nurses. Ten of the occupations with the highest median 
weekly earnings in the 2000s are pharmacists, CEOs, 
attorneys, information systems managers, medical doc­
tors, software engineers, physical therapists, manage­
ment analysts, health service managers and computer 
systems analysts. There is a disparity in salaries between 
women and men; in 2012 women earned approxi­
mately 81 percent of what men earned. Women also 
leave their jobs more frequently than men and in sci­
entific or engineering jobs, women leave their jobs at 
about twice the rate as men (Jesse, 2006).
Issues
Establishing the Family Friendly Workplace
The management challenge of dealing with a mixed 
gender non-management workforce, often split 

Gender & Management
Principles of Business: Management
144
evenly between men and women, has attracted con­
siderable attention during the last decade. This chal­
lenge is not just to deal with increased numbers of 
women in the workplace but to also address the needs 
of men who are married to women who have jobs and 
families; or, the dual-income household which totals 
over 33 million families.
Much of the human resource development ef­
forts over the last decade have focused on women. 
Currently the age of working women spans multiple 
generations. They may be married. They may be 
single. They may or may not have children. The array 
of potential characteristics is important because 
it means that there is not a one-size fits all recruit­
ment strategy or benefits package that will meet the 
needs of all working women. Women of baby boomer 
age face the challenges of eldercare more so than of 
child care. Some, however, take on the care of their 
grandchildren if their children are divorced or live 
in two-income households. When companies or non­
profit organizations target women recruits they need 
to bear in mind that of women’s family responsibili­
ties may reach far beyond their own household.
Single mothers can have difficulties in keeping 
home and work balanced. For instance if there is a 
problem with a child at school a single mother will 
need to attend to the problem unless they have support 
from grandparents or nannies. However, many single 
mothers would still prefer to be at a child’s doctor ap­
pointment or a parent-teacher conference. This means 
that they need a flexible work schedule so they can take 
time off from work for these important appointments.
Many single mothers do not have the support of 
parents or family and will need to take time off work 
as needed to address domestic issues. This may jeop­
ardize their career advancement or even the stability 
of their jobs. Still, the middle-class single mother is 
basically far better off than her predecessors of pre­
vious generations (Piscione, 2004).
As business conditions changed and competition 
stiffened one of the easy ways for a company to ex­
pand their market share was through a merger or 
acquisition. The ever changing landscape of leader­
ship that this created, along with post acquisition or 
merger lay-offs, substantially altered the employee 
loyalty that many companies spent decades building. 
Women may have borne the brunt of many of these 
changes. The need for corporate family-friendly ben­
efits and non-traditional employment approaches 
has suffered through the corporate consolidations of 
the last two decades. In attempts to avoid high turn­
over rates, which in turn cause an increase in hiring 
and training costs, employers needed to devise new 
strategies to recruit and retain quality employees.
Benefits of a Family-Friendly Workplace
The term “family-friendly” encompasses a wide range of 
workplace benefits and practices that help to support 
the well-being of an employee and his or her family. This 
includes benefits designed to help reduced life’s stress 
and contribute to a sense of comfort and security. Such 
benefits often include options that enable employees 
to have more control of their lives. They could include 
flexibility in working hours or providing assistance with 
financial issues. The benefits that an employer gains by 
establishing a family friendly workplace include:

 Being known for practices that contribute to the 
support family needs which actually produce real 
economic results, such as higher profits, higher 
productivity, and lower attrition.

 Establishing a strong correlation between a com­
pany’s culture of family support that is recognized 
among employees, and with customers that are 
looking to do business with socially responsible 
companies, and in the communities in which the 
company has facilities.

 An image of corporate social responsibility that 
can attract potential investors and new customers.

 An increase in the quality of life and job satisfac­
tion of employees as well as upper management.
Benefits Offered
Since the turn of the century, the most common fam­
ily-friendly benefits that employers have rolled out 
are related to dependent care spending accounts, 
job-sharing, child care, flexible work schedules and 
compensatory time off. Other benefits include lib­
eral family leave options that go beyond the legal 
requirements for such leave. There has also been 
an increase in part-time telecommuting working ar­
rangements and compressed workweeks which allow 
employees to work forty hours in less than five days.
Many organizations are becoming creative about 
the types of benefits they include in their family-
friendly benefit portfolios. These may include well­
ness programs, employee assistance programs and 
home buying assistance. There have also been several 

Principles of Business: Management
Gender & Management
145
education related benefits thrown into the mix, such 
as scholarship programs for children of employees 
and tuition reimbursement programs. Community 
building benefits have included volunteer release time 
and even concierge services (Clark & Reed, 2004).
Worker’s Unions & Women
Another way that a workplace can be transformed or 
be made more worker-friendly is through unioniza­
tion of workers. Women are becoming union mem­
bers at a faster rate than men. This means that unions 
need to focus on issues that concern women if they 
choose to capitalize on the trend of more women 
joining. This could benefit the unions as well as 
women who join because the women need benefits 
and representation and the unions need to stem the 
tide of declining memberships. It may take some 
unions a while to shift their emphasis because many 
unions have been traditionally male dominated.
In terms of benefits, unions could win more 
women members if they would think more like the 
corporations that have shifted their benefit packages 
to appeal to and serve women better than they have 
in the past. Unions may need to have more women 
as organizers and as leaders in order to convince po­
tential women members that the unions are actually 
changing and shifting their emphasis. Some unions 
may be able to make the shift while others may need 
to wait for a new generation of leadership.
Unions may also need to shift their organization 
targets and start forming more union cells in places 
where women traditionally work. If the union offers 
a good package of benefits to women they may very 
well succeed in organizing in places that they have 
failed to organize in the past. It may take decades for 
this to happen but it is possible to see a resurgence in 
unions if they can appeal to the growing number of 
women in the workforce (Yates, 2006).
CONCLUSIONS
Organizations face several challenges in dealing with 
gender in the workplace. In basic terms, men and 
women are different in their perceptions of work, 
success, and life in general. Both men and women 
want to rise within their organization and to make 
more money. While they share this similarity there 
are others issues and goals that are completely dif­
ferent for men and women.
Women have far greater social pressure than men to 
be both successful in their careers and to be mothers 
and daughters. The mother role is fairly clear and it 
is demanding both physically and emotionally. Many 
women are also daughters and in current times this 
means that they are often cast into the role of primary 
care taker for their parents as they age. Although the 
role of men in the family setting has certainly changed 
over the last few decades, men still have less of this 
pressure in their roles of father and son.
Given that women are both increasing their pres­
ence in the work place and their power in the con­
sumer market, organizations need to come embrace 
women on both fronts. First they must provide a 
workplace and benefits package that is appropriate to 
meet the needs of working women and their roles as 
mothers and daughters. Secondly, companies need to 
address how they position themselves as a producer, 
seller, or service provider to women as consumers. To 
do this they need to understand the marketplace and 
how women view their products and services. It is not 
likely that men will be able to accomplish that without 
the help of women in management positions.

Human Resource Issues in High Performing Organizations
ABSTRACT
High performing organizations are companies 
that consistently out-perform their competitors. 
Although high levels of performance are due to a 
number of factors, human resource policies and pro­
cedures are a significant contributor to on-going suc­
cess in these organizations. One of the foundations 
of human resource management success in high per­
forming organizations is the objective understanding 
and definition of the nature of the jobs within the 
company, based on empirical evidence, and the es­
tablishment of hiring, performance appraisal, and 
other functions on that basis. In addition, high per­
forming organizations support and empower their 
workers through continued training to help them ac­
quire even more job-related skills, involvement in or­
ganizational decision-making, and financial rewards 
for contributing to the success of the organization.
OVERVIEW
In recent years, significant attention has been given to 
high-performing organizations — those companies that 
consistently outperform their competitors — in an at­
tempt to determine what factors contribute to their suc­
cess. In organizations that produce goods, it is tempting 
to point to the efficiency of the production line or au­
tomation as a factor in performance. However, the out­
puts of many companies today are not quite so tangible. 
Even in traditional production facilities, there are many 
more factors to performance efficiency than having the 
newest or best equipment. Organizations are made up 
of people, and human resources are the most impor­
tant resource in any organization. Therefore, one of 
the areas that need to be analyzed in determining the 
factors that contribute to success in high-performance 
organizations is human-resource management.
Although the fundamental functions of human-re­
source management — recruitment and placement, 
training and development, compensation, and em­
ployee relations — are the same in every organiza­
tion, research has found that there are significant 
differences between human-resource functionality 
in low-performing organizations and that in high-
performing organizations. In high-performing or­
ganizations, human-resource departments tend to 
operate at a higher level: generating more candidates 
for job openings and screening them more effectively, 
offering more and better training opportunities for 
employees, linking pay and other incentives directly 
with employee performance, and providing a safer 
working environment for employees at all levels within 
the organization. Not only do the processes and out­
comes of human-resource activities differ in high-per­
forming organizations, so do their goals. In general, 
in high-performing organizations, human-resource 
activities are at the heart of the organization’s func­
tioning rather than on the periphery, with the goal 
of maximizing the potential, utilization, and commit­
ment of all employees at all levels in the organization.
As modern organizations were beginning to take 
shape after the Industrial Revolution, there was a 
great distinction between the various types of workers 
in an organization. Business owners and managers 
were viewed as the driving force behind the organi­
zation, with production workers, clerks, secretaries, 
and others often viewed as easily replaceable entities. 
To run an organization under this philosophy, the 
command-and-control model was adopted from the 
military. However, in the 21st century, this paradigm 
has changed. In the Information Age, it is recognized 
that virtually all employees within organizations are 
highly skilled and can contribute to the effectiveness 
and performance of the organization. In current 
thinking among human-resource managers, em­
ployees are not easily replaceable entities but rather 
human capital. This view regarding an organization’s 
employees takes into account an employee’s potential 
within the scope of his or her current tasks, as well as

the employee’s overall expertise, including his or her 
knowledge, skills, abilities, training, and education. 
Employees are no longer viewed merely as bodies 
needed to fill positions; they are a type of corporate 
wealth that can be used to further the objectives of 
the organization in much the same way as financial 
capital is used. Therefore, employees need to be nur­
tured and helped to realize their potential. In addi­
tion, their contributions need to be recognized and 
rewarded and their inputs considered in order to help 
the organization perform at a consistently high level.
Under this philosophy, human-resource depart­
ments need to set up policies and procedures that 
promote a high-performance work system. This 
means that just as performance and success in the 
rest of the organization needs to be objectively mea­
surable and evaluated against objective standards, so 
too must the performance of the activities within the 
human-resource department itself. Dessler (2005) 
describes the results of research published in 2001 
that compared the human-resource practices in high-
performing versus low-performing organizations. A 
significant difference found between the two types 
of organizations was the emphasis placed on various 
functions that encourage high performance. For ex­
ample, when hiring new employees, high-performing 
companies were more likely to promote from within 
(61.46%) than were their low-performing coun­
terparts (34.90%). This difference is due in part to 
the fact that high-performing organizations tend 
to groom their employees for advancement. High-
performing companies also tend to be systematic 
about their approach to hiring new employees. 
Significantly more high-performing organizations 
based hiring decisions in part on validated selection 
tests (29.67%) than did low-performing companies 
(4.26%). High-performing companies were more 
likely to attract applicants to the job, whether because 
of their reputation or their recruiting efforts: 36.55 
applicants on average in high-performing companies 
versus 8.24 applicants on average in low-performing 
companies. On a practical level, what this means is 
that high-performing companies have a greater ap­
plicant pool from which to fill their open jobs and, as 
a result, are typically more likely to find the best avail­
able person for the job (Dessler, 2005).
The impact of human-resource policies on orga­
nizational effectiveness and performance does not 
stop with hiring practices, however. Even when one 
has hired from within and the person in the new 
job is familiar with the general practices and cul­
ture of the organization, he or she will still need to 
learn how to perform the tasks required on the new 
job. Therefore, one of the functions of the human-
resource department is to provide training for em­
ployees. According to Dessler (2005), high-per­
forming companies gave new employees an average 
of 116.87 hours of training their first year, while low-
performing organizations gave new employees an av­
erage of 35.02 hours of training within their first year. 
Experienced employees were given an average of 
72.0 hours of training in high-performing companies 
but only 13.4 hours of training in low-performing 
companies. Although training costs can have a sig­
nificant impact on an organization’s budget, it is 
very important to train employees. Initial training 
is necessary to teach new employees how to success­
fully do their new jobs. However, additional training 
throughout the employee’s tenure is also important. 
Continued training enables employees to acquire the 
additional skills that will help them grow and make 
them better able to contribute to the performance of 
the organization.
Human-resource practices and procedures are 
important in other aspects of the organization’s 
functioning. In high-performing companies, for ex­
ample, 95.17% of the employees received a regular 
performance evaluation, as opposed to only 41.31 
percent in low-performing companies. In addition, 
in the high-performing companies, 51.67% of the 
employees received performance feedback from 
multiple sources, compared to only 3.9% in low-per­
forming companies (Dessler, 2005). Such feedback 
gives employees a better overall picture of how they 
are doing on the job. This means that employees in 
high-performing companies have more information 
about the quality of their performance so that they 
know how and when to improve.
Encouraging high performance within organiza­
tions is not just a matter of prodding the employees 
to use their knowledge, skills, and abilities in fur­
therance of the organization’s goals. The high-per­
forming organization also recognizes that employees 
will be motivated to greater performance if they are 
rewarded for their efforts with something of value. 
For example, in the high-performing companies, pay 
increases and incentive pay were tied to performance 
for 87.27% of the employees; in contrast, only 23.36% 

Human Resource Issues in High Performing Organizations
Principles of Business: Management
150
of such remuneration was tied to performance in 
low-performing companies. This means that the em­
ployees in the high-performing companies not only 
know how they are doing against organizational stan­
dards and how they can improve; they are also given 
tangible monetary incentives to motivate them to im­
prove their performance and, by extension, the per­
formance of the organization. This is demonstrated 
by the fact that 83.56% of employees in high-per­
forming organizations were eligible for incentive pay, 
while only 27.83% of employees in low-performing 
organizations were eligible (Dessler, 2005). In addi­
tion to monetary incentives, high-performing orga­
nizations typically try to offer employees other in­
centives that will meet their individual needs, such 
as prestige, opportunities to socialize, or job security.
Such differences play themselves out in the per­
formance of the organization. According to Dessler 
(2005), high-performing organizations had lower 
turnover (20.87%) than low-performing organizations 
(34.09%). Reducing turnover helps not only because 
of the continuity of having high-skilled workers who 
know the job but also because it reduces the costs asso­
ciated with hiring and training replacement workers.
The US General Accounting Office (GAO) has 
been very involved in analyzing high-performing or­
ganizations in an attempt to determine what practices 
differentiate them from other companies. The GAO 
has found that leadership at the highest levels in high-
performing organizations is committed to doing what­
ever is necessary for success. This includes envisioning 
what changes are necessary, implementing those 
changes, and communicating openly with employees. 
Another discovery was that high-performing organi­
zations tend to work effectively with labor unions to 
resolve issues quickly. They also make sure that their 
employees receive the training that they need to 
better contribute to the organization’s goals. In addi­
tion, high-performing organizations encourage the 
use and development of teams as a way to advance the 
goals of the organization. In high-performing orga­
nizations, employees are encouraged to get involved, 
particularly in planning and sharing performance in­
formation and helping design strategic plans.
APPLICATIONS
In the early twentieth century, many organizations 
were looking for ways to improve organizational 
performance by taking away work from human beings 
and automating it. In some ways, we still do this, using 
computers instead of manual typewriters and PDAs in­
stead of calendars, for example. However, because of 
the intellectual nature of work in many modern orga­
nizations, we also recognize that human capital is an 
invaluable asset that needs to be nurtured and utilized. 
To this end, high-performing organizations recognize 
that the organization’s performance is dependent 
on the employees’ performance, and they develop 
and implement policies and practices that will sup­
port high performance. At its most basic, this involves 
finding employees who have the potential to excel, set­
ting objective performance standards that give them 
the criteria to know what kind of performance the 
organization is seeking, and linking performance to 
rewards in order to encourage high performance.
Defining & Assessing Success
The desire to become a high-performing organization 
is easy to understand. However, without an objective 
definition of what this means, it will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to reach this goal. On the organizational 
level, achieving high performance means that the or­
ganization must perform strategic planning and set 
clear goals and objectives. The organization also needs 
to define in objective terms what high performance 
looks like in order to encourage employees to become 
high-performing workers in furtherance of these goals.
The definition of what high performance entails 
is aided by the development of a solid job description 
based on an objective, thorough job analysis. A well-
written job description delineates not only the tasks 
and responsibilities of a job but also the knowledge, 
skills, and abilities necessary to do these things. In addi­
tion, a good job description sets standards for satisfac­
tory and unsatisfactory behavior on the job. Good job 
descriptions are competency based, describing the job 
in terms of measurable, observable, behavioral compe­
tencies that the employee must demonstrate in order 
to perform well. The development of an objective, em­
pirically based job description helps the organization 
better determine what knowledge, skills, and abilities 
are needed for employees in each job. Good job de­
scriptions and their concomitant performance stan­
dards also help employees know what kind of behavior 
will be rewarded (or not rewarded) by the organization.
It is not sufficient, however, to merely set standards 
for job performance. It is also necessary to give the 

Principles of Business: Management
Human Resource Issues in High Performing Organizations
151
employee feedback on how well he or she is meeting 
the set standards in order to encourage high per­
formance. The traditional way to do this is through 
performance appraisal. This is the process of objec­
tively assessing the employee’s current performance 
or performance over the past appraisal period and 
determining how well it meets predetermined stan­
dards. Performance appraisals may describe the per­
formance strengths and weaknesses both of the indi­
vidual worker and between two or more workers. They 
may be based on objective data (e.g., average number 
of widgets produced per day; number of sales made 
per quarter), personnel data (e.g., number of days 
late to work), judgmental data (e.g., rating scales), 
or some combination of the three. Judgmental data 
in particular can be very subjective and victim to a 
host of rating errors or bias on the part of the person 
doing the rating. Therefore, in high-performing or­
ganizations, human-resource policies or procedures 
are developed and implemented to help increase the 
objectiveness of the appraisal feedback or give the 
employee feedback from multiple sources.
It is important to give feedback on an employee’s 
performance by measuring it against a predeter­
mined standard or set of specific goals to be achieved 
for the appraisal period. One way to do this is through 
a method called management by objectives (MBO). 
In MBO, the manager, often in concert with the 
employee, sets objectives for the employee to meet 
during the coming appraisal period. At the next 
performance appraisal, the employee is evaluated 
in terms of how well he or she has met these goals. 
Although this can be done on an informal level, MBO 
is frequently instituted across the organization. MBO 
instituted at this level starts first with the organization 
setting enterprise-wide goals and objectives based on 
its strategic plan (e.g., increase company profits from 
a particular product line by $500,000 over the next 
year). Using this information, each department then 
sets its own goals and objectives for how they will sup­
port and help reach the organization’s goals (e.g., 
increase sales of the product in the eastern region 
by 10% over the next year). Departmental goals are 
then discussed with the employees in each depart­
ment to help them understand what the organiza­
tion is trying to achieve and to encourage them to 
think about how they as individuals can contribute to 
those goals. Individual employees and their supervi­
sors then discuss the goals and possible contributions 
that can be made by the individual and set specific, 
short-term goals (e.g., obtain 10 more customers per 
quarter; call on 5 more potential customers per week; 
include two more cities in the region). The perfor­
mance or progress toward these goals is periodically 
assessed at predetermined times, and the employee is 
given feedback on his or her progress.
Although MBO can be a step in the right direction 
in the attempt to link individual performance with 
organizational performance goals, it is not without its 
drawbacks. The most frequently encountered problem 
with MBO is the setting of unclear or unmeasurable 
objectives. For example, the objective to “come up with 
a better widget design in the next quarter” may be valid 
in principle (if the current design is unsatisfactory), 
but it is difficult to objectively define (how, exactly, 
does one define “better”?) and challenging to mea­
sure. In addition, it is not a reasonable goal: it is futile 
to put a time limit on creativity. Further, the process of 
managing by objectives is time consuming and requires 
involvement at all levels of the organization to make it 
work. Although one can define objectives for the indi­
vidual, if these are not tied in to organizational-level ob­
jectives, they probably will not meaningfully or inten­
tionally improve the performance of the organization. 
Also, it can be difficult to achieve agreement between 
management and employees on what is a reasonable 
objective. Supervisors have a tendency to set the bar too 
high when writing objectives, while many employees 
tend to set the bar too low so that they can be sure to 
meet their objectives, particularly if their pay raises are 
tied to performance. For example, although a man­
ager may want to give a programmer the objective of 
writing 50 pages of code a week, the programmer may 
know that this is both unreasonable and impossible. 
To increase the effectiveness of performance-appraisal 
goals and feedback, it is important that the employee’s 
goals be reasonable, objective, measurable, and based 
on the performance goals of the organization.
Even when reasonable, objective, measurable goals 
are set, receiving feedback from one source is often not 
sufficient to encourage the type of high performance 
that many organizations are looking for in their em­
ployees. A technique called 360-degree feedback can 
help improve the feedback the employee receives by 
increasing the amount of feedback and the sources 
from which it comes. This technique is called 360-de­
gree feedback because the feedback comes from 
people who work all around the employee, not just 

Human Resource Issues in High Performing Organizations
Principles of Business: Management
152
from one person working above him or her. Employees 
receive feedback on their job performance from repre­
sentatives of the major groups with whom they interact 
on the job, both inside and outside the organization. 
For example, employees may receive feedback not only 
from their supervisors, as in the traditional perfor­
mance-appraisal paradigm, but also from their subor­
dinates, coworkers, customers, and other groups with 
whom they interact. This technique gives the employee 
more feedback than he or she would receive from one 
person alone. It also gives the employee better feed­
back by involving those who work directly with him or 
her. In addition, this approach to feedback can help 
neutralize a biased opinion from one person by giving 
the employee and the supervisor a range of reactions to 
look at, allowing them to examine the preponderance 
of evidence rather than one person’s reactions. The 
increased level of feedback received from techniques 
such as 360-degree feedback gives the employee a 
better idea of how he or she can improve performance.
Linking Performance to Rewards
Although it is important to specify what kind of be­
havior is expected in the organization and to en­
courage employees to meet or exceed these standards 
by providing feedback, in most cases employees need 
more from the organization than to know that they are 
helping it succeed. Even in a non-profit or volunteer 
organization, workers need to get something out of the 
situation, whether it is a monetary reward or a feeling 
of accomplishment or personal growth. To motivate 
employees to perform at a consistently high level, the 
organization must give them what they want or need. 
The process of determining what these things are and 
giving them to the employee in return for excellent 
performance is called motivation. One of the things 
that high-performing organizations do to motivate 
employees to contribute to the company’s high perfor­
mance is to link the desired performance to rewards.
Many theories have been advanced about moti­
vation. Some theorists have tried to reduce motiva­
tion to an equation that connects the probability of 
increased performance with such things as the em­
ployee’s perceived expectancy of obtaining a reward 
for doing so. Other theorists have stated that dif­
ferent people are motivated by different things, from 
having one’s physical needs met (e.g., food on the 
table and a roof over one’s head) to earning the es­
teem of others or some other internal incentive.
No matter the theory, most motivation theorists 
recognize that people working in organizations both 
need and expect remuneration. Sometimes this is re­
quired to meet basic physical needs or to have the 
security of knowing that those needs will continue 
to be met for the foreseeable future. In other cases, 
pay incentives in the form of bonuses, raises, or 
promotions fill a need for recognition from others. 
No matter what motivators an employee has — and 
high-performing organizations typically seek to meet 
those needs within the constraints of the organiza­
tion — pay is always a consideration.
One of the approaches to motivating desired 
behavior in high-performing organizations is an 
approach frequently referred to as pay for perfor­
mance. In this approach, the employee is rewarded 
financially for high performance and their contri­
bution to the organization’s goals. This is true not 
only for workers at the bottom of the organizational 
structure, such as production workers, but for all em­
ployees, all the way up to the chief executive officer.
The GAO has researched pay-for-performance sys­
tems and has found a number of factors that make 
them successful. First, such systems must use objective 
competencies to assess the quality of the employee’s 
performance. As stated earlier, these should be based 
on empirical research and directly related to the 
goals of the organization. Second, employee perfor­
mance ratings should be translated into pay increases 
or awards so that employees can see a direct, positive 
consequence of their actions. Third, when making 
decisions about compensation, both the employee’s 
current salary and his or her contribution to the or­
ganization should be considered so that rewards for 
similar contributions are equitable. Finally, to be suc­
cessful and to prevent possible abuse, pay-for-perfor­
mance systems should be clear and well publicized so 
that employees know the basis on which decisions are 
made and what kinds of awards are given across the 
organization.
There are many ways that human-resource func­
tions can aid the organization’s goal for high perfor­
mance. These include recognizing that employees 
are valuable assets to the organization (i.e., human 
capital) and increasing the objectiveness of stan­
dards, feedback, and the grounds on which rewards 
are given. By encouraging high performance in in­
dividual employees, the organization as a whole can 
become high performing, too.

Inclusive Leadership
ABSTRACT
Inclusive leadership is a style of management that 
has risen to prominence in recent years, and is widely 
seen as a significant improvement over the relatively 
uninspiring transactional leadership styles common 
in previous generations of leaders. While it has sev­
eral different interpretations, most of these agree 
that the inclusive leader is one who is available to sub­
ordinates, who cares about their ideas and motiva­
tions, and who is willing to hear input from all levels 
of the organization.
OVERVIEW
Inclusive leadership is closely related to transfor­
mational leadership, a style that seeks to inspire the 
members of an organization to work together in 
order to create a system that is greater than the sum 
of its parts. In the literature of the fields of business 
and management, the idea of inclusive leadership 
generally has two possible interpretations. The first 
interpretation revolves around an understanding 
of the value of diversity in organizations (Naudé, 
Stanley & Ratcliffe, 2015). The traditional approach 
to management and organizational staffing was to 
hire people who fit into the corporate mold, the so-
called “organization man” discussed in studies of 
the Japanese business world. The goal was to hire 
the “right kind” of people who would see the world 
in the same way that the organization’s leadership 
did, so that there would be a harmonious and pro­
ductive working environment. The problem that 
arose with this approach was that it leads to tunnel 
vision, because people tend to see things only from 
their own perspective, and if everyone in an organi­
zation has more or less the same perspective, then 
problems that require analysis through a different 
type of lens may be difficult or impossible for that 
organization to solve. This is why there is a need for 
leadership that sees the importance of including 
many different kinds of people, each with their own 
background and beliefs (Hafford-Letchfield et al., 
2014; Ashikali & Groeneveld, 2015).
The origins of this appreciation for diversity in 
organizations can be traced back to the 1960s and 
the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement, which 
encouraged members of many different racial and 
ethnic groups to advocate for their communities’ 
needs. This work helped the struggle for women’s 
rights and rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans­
gendered persons. Companies have realized that 
building diverse teams is not only the right thing to 
do morally, ethically, and legally—it also makes good 
business sense. Companies develop and market prod­
ucts and services to all different kinds of people, so 
hiring only one type of person (such as white males) 
and expecting that group to be able to understand 
the needs and desires of every other group would be 
a recipe for disaster. Inclusive leadership understands 
this, and draws upon a rich variety of people and ex­
periences in order to form a better connection with 
its diverse customer base (Mitchell & Conference 
Board, 2010).
The second interpretation of inclusive leader­
ship found in management texts refers to a lead­
er’s interpersonal style rather than to the leader’s 
attitude toward diversity. Here again, it is useful 
to consider styles of leadership that have predomi­
nated in earlier time periods. In the past, a leader 
was expected to have all of the answers, because the 
assumption was that the person who best under­
stands how things should be done is the person who 
should be in charge, telling everyone else what to 
do. Sometimes this approach made sense, especially 
during periods of history prior to the start of public 
education, because leaders back then might very 
well be the only ones in the group with the relevant 
experience and education to see how a problem 
should be approached.

Further Insights
In the modern period, it has gradually become clear 
that it is not very common for only the leader to under­
stand the situation an organization faces. More often, 
leaders are faced with problems that arise from many 
different areas, and it is not uncommon for leaders 
to be unfamiliar with these. A factor that has contrib­
uted to this trend is the increasing specialization of the 
modern economy. People do jobs that are more and 
more detailed, requiring ever greater amounts of spe­
cialized training, so that it is beyond the capacity of a 
single individual to understand every task that is car­
ried out on a day to day basis within the organization 
(Burrello, Sailor, & Kleinhammer-Tramill, 2013). 
One hundred years ago, the leader of a company 
might very well have experience doing every single 
job in the firm, such that he—it would almost cer­
tainly have been a man—could walk along the fac­
tory line, giving the workers advice about their tasks. 
If one imagines trying to do something similar at one 
of Silicon Valley’s giant technology firms, the need 
for new leadership styles suddenly becomes clear. 
Because it is no longer possible for one person to 
have all of the answers, leaders are realizing that the 
most useful approach they can adopt is one of inclu­
sion, where they get employees at the organization to 
commit their time, energy, and expertise to helping 
the company succeed (Hollander, 2012). Modern 
leadership theories rely heavily on ideas around so­
cial exchange, the idea being that people follow their 
leaders because the leaders provide them with some­
thing in exchange for their cooperation.
Employee work engagement is a measurement of 
an employee’s level of interest in the work he or she 
has been assigned to complete. Generally, employee 
work engagement is higher when employees are as­
signed tasks they know how to do and have the proper 
authority to perform. Inclusive leadership strives to 
ensure that employee work engagement remains high 
by aligning workers with tasks to which they are best 
suited. Further, inclusive leaders are seen as workers’ 
allies, addressing workplace issues fairly and helping 
solve problems. Social exchange theory states that 
if one person performs a task for another, then the 
person who benefitted will be more likely to recipro­
cate. Modern leadership theories rely heavily on ideas 
around social exchange, the idea being that people 
follow their leaders because the leaders provide them 
with something in exchange for their cooperation.
VIEWPOINTS
Much of the discussion about inclusive leadership fo­
cuses not on whether it is a good idea—few dispute 
this—but on how it should be practiced. These con­
versations are of two broad types: things that a leader 
should do in order to be inclusive, and ways that a 
leader should behave as part of being inclusive. 
Availability
Perhaps the foremost quality that should be in an in­
clusive leader’s toolkit is availability. This means that 
the leader needs to be willing to sit down with his or 
her staff whenever they need to discuss an issue related 
to their work or which might have an effect on their 
work. Some leaders, especially those with introverted 
tendencies, find it difficult to cope with this much 
personal contact, so they devise ways to distance them­
selves from staff in order to avoid it, such as closing 
the office door, choosing an office further away from 
the rest of the department, or requiring everyone 
to work with a secretary or administrative assistant 
to schedule a meeting, instead of simply answering 
their own phone. Those leaders who understand the 
importance of inclusion, however, make themselves 
available to their staff, because they feel that part of a 
leader’s role is to listen and interact with everyone on 
the team. After all, before everyone can be included, 
everyone has to be able to be heard (Rumsey, 2013).
Accessibility
A quality closely related to availability is accessibility. 
At first the two might seem almost synonymous, but 
there is a distinction to be found because it is possible 
for a leader to be “technically” available yet remain not 
very accessible. This is best illustrated by an example. 
In a hypothetical call center, thirty technical support 
people are supervised by a manager. The manager 
has an open door policy which is much spoken of, 
and all employees are reminded on a regular basis 
that they can go and see the manager any time they 
have an issue to discuss. This manager can say that 
she makes every effort to be available for her staff 
whenever they might need her. However, it turns out 
that the call center also keeps very strict metrics about 
how much time staff spend away from their phones. 
Any time spent away must have a documented expla­
nation, and the paperwork required to document a 
conference with the manager is considerable.

The effect of this policy would be that very few 
people would take the time to go and speak to the man­
ager, unless there was a very compelling reason to do 
so. The manager is available (the door is always open) 
but not very accessible (because the call center policy 
acts as an obstacle to meeting with the manager). A 
more inclusive approach in this scenario might be for 
the manager to schedule fifteen minutes with each em­
ployee, each week, so that they would all feel that they 
have access to someone who will hear their ideas or can 
help them, should the need arise (Couto, 2010).
Openness
Along with availability and accessibility, the quality most 
often seen in inclusive leaders is openness. Openness 
refers to the leader’s ability to be honest and authentic 
with followers, instead of refusing to share information 
with them or help them to understand how their work 
fits into the larger picture of the work being carried on 
by the organization. Some transactional leaders feel 
that in order to maintain a position of superiority above 
those around them, they need to limit others’ access 
to information about the organization’s operations. 
These leaders will typically give orders to others but will 
refuse to clarify why the orders are being given or what 
the ultimate use for the work being requested will be.
To continue with the call center example above, 
the manager of the call center might inform all em­
ployees that they must reduce their average call times 
to under one minute per call. Employees who have a 
higher level of affective organizational commitment 
will immediately want to know more about this direc­
tive (Wuffli, 2015)—whose idea is it, and what is the 
reason for it? It could be an attempt to reduce costs by 
using the phones less, or it could be an effort to make 
customers happier by resolving their problems more 
quickly. Knowing the answers to questions like these 
will help the employees understand how they should 
act: Should they rush people off the phones at all costs, 
because the head of the company is adamant that this 
change happen immediately, or should they just make 
a mild effort to be more terse, as might be indicated 
if the project were just a low stakes experiment being 
conducted by the office leader for a few days.
Whatever the answers to these questions might be, 
it is how the manager responds to them that shows 
the extent to which the office embraces an inclusive 
leadership model. A person following the traditional 
model of leadership would be very likely to refuse to 
share any additional information, making clear that 
the only information the employees needed was that 
which had been given (Brennan, 2014). This type of 
response is frustrating for employees and can cause 
some to feel that there actually is no useful purpose 
to the orders they have been given, other than to ha­
rass people and raise their levels of anxiety.
An inclusive response, on the other hand, would 
be one in which the leader openly shared why the 
change in procedure is needed. Possibly, the super­
visor does not know either and is just following orders 
from her superiors, in which case she may empathize 
with the potential issues that the change might cause. 
Responding in this way removes barriers between 
leaders and followers, instead of reinforcing them. 
Followers who receive an inclusive response feel that 
they and their leader are working together, both trying 
to help each other get the work done even if they do 
not have as complete an understanding of the big pic­
ture as they might wish (Esposito & Normore, 2015).
While some advocates of more charismatic lead­
ership argue that using an inclusive style in this way 
could erode the authority that is traditionally associ­
ated with a leadership role, allowing staff to feel that 
they are on a par with the leader in terms of exper­
tise and knowledge, this is not what usually happens. 
Instead, those who are exposed to an inclusive style 
tend to feel more committed to the organization and 
more willing to use their own creativity and initiative 
to develop improved products and processes. This is 
known as affective organizational commitment. Katz 
& Miller (2014) argue that inclusive leadership is no 
longer optional in the rapidly evolving business envi­
ronment in which agility is key to survival. Inclusive 
leadership’s benefits include higher levels of optimism 
among employees, attributable to the fact that being 
able to share their views with their leaders gives them 
the feeling that ideas that they share with the manage­
ment will actually be heard, considered, and possibly 
even implemented (Mac, Ottesen, & Precey, 2013).

Industrial Organization & Finance
ABSTRACT
This article focuses on industrial organization and fi­
nance. Industrial organization and corporate finance 
have evolved into two distinct fields of study. Both 
topics place minimum emphasis on the strategic re­
lationship between financial decisions and output 
market decisions. There is an exploration of market 
structures. Market structures take into consideration: 
The number of firms in an industry, the relative size

of the firms (industry concentration), demand con­
ditions, ease of entry and exit, and technological and 
cost conditions. Profit and wealth maximization is 
discussed. In addition, the value of firm-bank rela­
tionships is introduced.
OVERVIEW
In the past, the field of industrial organization has 
not focused on corporate finance, and vice versa. 
However, a working knowledge of both fields may 
assist scholars in understanding “how product mar­
kets perform when firms participating in a market 
are constrained financially, and for understanding 
how capital structure and corporate governance con­
tribute to product market strategy” (Riordan, 2003, 
p. 1). Industrial organization and corporate finance 
have evolved into two distinct fields of study. Brander 
and Lewis (1986) suggested that the research on fi­
nancial structures and oligopoly have something in 
common. Both topics are concerned with the stra­
tegic relationship between internal economic de­
cisions and external market decisions. Harris and 
Raviv (1991) identified the industrial organization 
effects of capital structure as one of the four major 
topics when studying the theory of capital structure.
Roe (2001) asserted that “the relative value of 
shareholder wealth maximization for a nation is partly 
a function of that nation’s industrial organization. 
When much of a nation’s industry is monopolistically 
organized, maximizing shareholder wealth would 
maximize the monopolist’s profits, induce firms to 
produce fewer goods than society could potentially 
produce, and motivate firms to raise price beyond 
that which is necessary to produce the goods” (p.1).
Profit Maximization
Profits are very crucial to a firm’s bottom line. When a 
firm is able to make a profit, there is an assumption that 
the company has done a good job of being effective 
and efficient in controlling the cost while producing 
a quality product or performing a quality service. 
However, there are different types of profits. Two types 
of profits are accounting profits and economic profits.

 Accounting profits are the difference between 
the total revenue and the cost of producing prod­
ucts or services; they appear on the firm’s income 
statement.

 Economic profits are the difference between 
overall revenue and the total amount of opportu­
nity costs. The opportunity costs tend to be higher 
than accounting and bookkeeping costs.
Profit Theories
Profits tend to vary across industries, and there are 
a number of theories that attempt to provide an ex­
planation as to why this occurs. Five of the most dis­
cussed theories in this area are:

 Risk-Bearing Theory. When the owners of a com­
pany make investments into the firm, they take on 
a certain amount of risk. In order to compensate 
them for their investment, the company will need 
to have an above average return on economic 
profits. An example would be a firm that has inves­
tors such as venture capitalists or angel investors.

 Dynamic Equilibrium Theory. Every firm should 
strive to have a normal rate of profit. However, 
each firm has the opportunity to earn returns 
above or below the normal level at any time.

 Monopoly Theory. Monopoly Theory. There are 
times when one firm many have the opportunity 
to dominate in its industry and earn above average 
rates of return over a long period of time. These 
firms tend to take control of the market as a result 
of economies of scale, dominate the ownership of 
essential natural resources, control crucial patents 
and influence government regulations. An ex­
ample would be utility companies.

 Innovation Theory. A firm may earn above normal 
profits as a reward for its successful innovations 
such as patents. An example would be a pharma­
ceutical organization such as Astra Zeneca.

 Managerial Efficiency Theory. A firm may be able 
to earn above average profits based on its strong 
leadership team. This type of organization gains 
profits as a result of being effective and efficient. 
An example would be General Electric under Jack 
Welch’s leadership.
Wealth Maximization
Wealth maximization is a long term operational goal. 
Shareholders continue to exert a claim on a firm’s 
net cash flows even after anticipated contractual 
claims have been paid. All other stakeholders (i.e. 
employers, customers) have contractual expected 
returns. There tends to be a preference for wealth

maximization because it takes into consideration 
(Shim & Siegel, 1998):

 Wealth for the long term.

 Risk or uncertainty.

 The timing of returns.

 The stockholders’ return.
Criterion for this goal suggests that a firm should 
review and assess the expected profits and or cash 
flows as well as the risks that are associated with them. 
When conducting this evaluation, there are three 
points to keep in mind.

 First, economic profits are not equivalent to ac­
counting profits.

 Second, accounting profits are not the same as 
cash flows.

 Lastly, financial analysis must focus on maximizing 
the current value of cash flows to firm owners when 
attempting to maximize shareholder benefit.
Application
Market Structure
Market structures take into consideration:

 The number of firms in an industry.

 The relative size of the firms (industry concen­
tration).

 Demand conditions.

 Ease of entry and exit.

 Technological and cost conditions.
The preferred structure is dependent on the type of 
industry. Therefore, the financial management team 
of each firm determines which of the above-mentioned 
factors will be a part of the decision making process.
The level of competition tends to be dependent 
on whether there are many (or a few) firms in the 
industry and the firm’s products are similar or dif­
ferent. Given this information, four basic approaches 
to market structure and the types of competition 
have been established.
Perfect (Pure) Competition (Many sellers of a 
standardized product)
Characteristics of perfect competition are:

 Large number of buyers and sellers.

 Homogeneous product.

 Complete knowledge.

 Easy entry and exit from the market.
A firm using this approach tends to be small rela­
tive to the total market, and it will offer its product at 
the going market price. A firm in this format operates 
at an output level where price (or marginal revenue) 
is equal to the marginal cost and profit maximized. 
This format is more theoretical because there is no 
firm that operates at this level.
Monopolistic Competition (Many sellers of a dif­
ferentiated product) Characteristics of monopolistic 
competition are:

 One firm.

 No close substitutes.

 No interdependence among firms.

 Substantial barriers to entry.
In addition, there tends to be many buyers and 
sellers, there is product differentiation, easy entry 
and exit and independent decision making by indi­
vidual firms. An example of a firm fitting this profile 
would be a small business selling differentiated, yet 
similar, products. These firms will utilize three basic 
strategies in order to obtain their principal goal of 
maximum profits. The strategies are:

 Price changes.

 Variations in the products.

 Promotional activities.
Oligopoly (Only a few sellers of either standard­
ized or differentiated products)
Characteristics of oligopoly are:

 Few firms.

 High degree of interdependence among firms.

 Product may be homogenous or differentiated.

 Difficult entry and exit from market.
The market fits this approach when there are a 
small number of firms supplying the dominant share 
of an industry’s total output. Oligopolists are interde­
pendent based on all levels of competition — price, 
output, promotional strategies, customer service 
policies, acquisitions and mergers, etc. Therefore, 
decision makers may have a hard time anticipating 
what rivals will do in reaction to their position, which 

Industrial Organization & Finance
Principles of Business: Management
160
makes the process complex. Two popular models are 
Cournot’s duopoly model and kinked demand curve. 
An example would be the NCAA. This organization 
controls the revenues and costs of its member schools. 
It has the power to limit the number of games and 
times that a school can have its games televised. The 
NCAA retains control over costs through its restric­
tions on the compensation of student athletes.
Monopoly (A single seller of a product for which 
there is no close substitute)
A monopoly occurs when one firm produces a 
highly differentiated product in a market with sig­
nificant barriers to entry. It may be large or small, 
and it must be the only supplier. In addition, there 
are no close substitutes. Since the monopoly is the 
only producer, it is equivalent to the overall industry 
and its individual demand curve is the same as the 
industry demand. An example would be an electric 
utility company in a specific geographic area.
What is the difference between the monopoly 
and pure approach? A profit-maximizing monopoly 
firm will produce less and charge a higher price than 
firms collectively in a purely competitive industry. 
However, both demand and cost may be different for 
a monopoly firm (i.e. a monopoly may be able to take 
advantage of economies of scales).
Viewpoint
Firm-Bank Relationships
There tends to be a variety of information problems in 
the financial markets and those responsible for over­
seeing the processes attempt to find different ways to 
address the issues that arise. One such attempt explores 
long-term relationships between firms and banks. 
Some believe that these types of relationships are 
crucial to the structure of credit markets. As a result, 
Degryse and Ongena (2002) reviewed the firm-bank 
relationship and the structure of banking markets on a 
global level. In addition, Yafeh and Yosha (2001) con­
ducted a study where they reviewed how standard in­
dustrial organization tools could be used to analyze the 
relationship between competition in financial markets 
and the prevalence of bank-firm relationships.
Benefits
A firm-bank relationship is established when 
the two entities have a close interaction and the 
banker is allowed to observe and collect a variety 
of information about the firm. The banker has the 
opportunity to evaluate whether or not the firm 
can meet future financial obligations. Although 
the banker has a chance to observe how the rela­
tionship will benefit the lender in the long term, 
there are some advantages for the firm as well. For 
example, the firm can increase its access to credit 
at a lower cost and with less collateral if it has es­
tablished a relationship with a bank. Also, the firm 
may have the opportunity to enter into complex 
and high risk projects as a result of having an es­
tablished relationship with a bank. Finally, a firm’s 
reputation and image may be seen as favorable due 
to an established and credible relationship with a 
bank (Dass & Massa, 2011).
Negatives
Although this is seen as a positive endeavor, there is 
a down side. There may be some individuals who will 
become concerned with the type and amount of in­
formation a bank knows about a firm. “The ability for 
a bank to privately observe proprietary information 
and maintain a close relationship with its customer 
can also impose costs on the customer” (Degryse & 
Ongena, 2002, p. 404). For example, a bank can de­
vise a campaign that will lock customers into main­
taining a relationship with it and prevent customers 
from receiving competitive financing from another 
bank. This will lead to the original bank having a 
monopoly over the market as a result of having privi­
leged client information. One solution to this type of 
problem would be for firms to enter into more than 
one bank relationship. The banks will offer competi­
tive services, which will minimize the possibility of 
any one bank getting the upper hand and creating a 
monopoly situation.
World-Wide Bank-Firm Relationships
Firms can diversify their financial portfolio by en­
tering into relationships with banks across the world. 
There will be opportunities for banks to form con­
sortiums and market to a variety of firms. The banks 
could come together and establish rules and regu­
lations for different types of organizational projects 
around the world. The Second European Banking 
Directive and the 1994 United States Riege-Neal 
Act created large international banking markets. 
Established bank-firm relationships are critical to 
the present development process for financial sys­
tems worldwide (Degryse & Ongena, 2002).

Labor Relations & Human Resource Management
ABSTRACT
This article examines the different business activities 
Human Resources participate in. These areas cover 
employment activities, training and development, and 
legal compliance. Human Resources should have core 
competencies which contribute to the overall growth 
and profitability of the company. Core competencies 
include ethics, communication, and strategic plan­
ning. By combining Human Resources experience and 
knowledge with the above areas and core competencies, 
Human Resources can be a valuable asset for a company.
OVERVIEW
This article explains the evolution and growth of 
Human Resource Management (herein referred to as 
HR) from simple labor relations functions (or compli­
cated as the case may be) to modern HR functions in 
all areas of a company’s activities. HR, in addition, pro­
vides an important resource to address areas where job 
responsibilities are ill defined or muddied. In today’s 
business world, HR also provides much needed exper­
tise in company newsletter publishing, web site main­
tenance, morale boosting and wellness programs.
In addition, and most importantly, HR has core 
competencies which add value to the company’s 
bottom line. These competencies are discussed be­
cause they are the heart and soul of any company’s 
success. HR’s involvement in business is limited only 
to HR’s imagination, ability, expertise, and compe­
tency. Anca-Ioana (2013) demonstrates the key role 
of HR in finding and exploiting competitive advan­
tages that underpin a company’s success against rivals 
who also seek to recruit the best talent and establish 
lean and purposeful organizational structures.
The core competencies of HR are: Communication, 
ethics, training, conflict resolution, motivation, re­
cord keeping, recruitment, negotiation, strategic 
planning, morale building, and legal knowledge.
Of the many core competencies listed above, 
few are extremely critical to the success of HR. 
Communication is the most important compe­
tency. Communication includes both the spoken 
and written word. Whether it is writing a company 
newsletter, a mission statement, or employee hand­
book, every employee must clearly understand what 
the company expects and what the company stands 
for. Well written documents allow for better under­
standing and a more effective work environment.
Legal competency requires the HR department to 
thoroughly know the rules and laws for equal treat­
ment of employees. No company can afford to be la­
beled as discriminatory towards employees; the com­
pany’s reputation is at stake. Bad press or bad public 
relations will make recruiting and retention difficult, 
and is financially damaging.
Strategic planning is a newer area for HR. In the 
past, most companies left strategic planning to upper 
management. Today, however, with globalization and 
complicated work environments, HR is asked to assist 
management and give input on many aspects of plan­
ning for the future in areas such as: future training 
needs, recruitment requirements, and work environ­
ments. HR must have the tools and knowledge to 
help develop these long range plans. The twenty-first 
century company is likely multinational in at least 
some respects. Marler (2012) explores and compares 
HR strategies from the United States, China, and 
Germany — three large economies with strongly cul­
tural based business practices. Edwards et al. (2013) 
suggest that rather than attempting to impose a 
single monoculture on a multinational company, or 
even apply a primarily socioeconomic model based 
on national economic systems, HR practices should 
strive to harmonize local cultures with overall com­
pany strategies.
With employee contact on a day to day basis, ethics 
is endemic to all areas of the company’s operations 
and this is especially true for HR. Every organization 

Labor Relations & Human Resource Management
Principles of Business: Management
164
must have a value system to operate under. HR must 
insure that every employee knows and understands 
the business ethics of the company. If employees 
know the company follows and acts within sound and 
moral business practices, the employees will aspire to 
these ideals. HR must act in the same manner as the 
company. Where HR provides leadership, others will 
follow.
In the last century and before, HR, also known as 
the personnel department, grew out of the need for 
businesses to manage and work with labor unions. 
Labor unions grew in response to capitalism and the 
industrial revolution.
On a day to day basis, businesses needed a de­
partment to manage the ever present issues and 
difficulties between management and labor. Labor 
relations demanded mechanisms to deal with labor 
grievances against management. As labor con­
tracts became more complicated and sophisticated, 
HR’s role increased. HR continues to participate in 
grievance committees and grievance procedures, 
but management demands that HR assist with bar­
gaining talks over labor contracts. HR also reviews 
other company’s labor contracts and surveys these 
companies regarding salaries and wages. Federal and 
state laws need to be read and contracts brought into 
compliance.
Today, HR accomplishes the above tasks and re­
sponsibilities, but as the modern world has become 
more complicated, so has the HR role. HR should de­
velop a reasonable and specific procedure to handle 
employee grievances. The procedure should be 
simple and clear. Employees must believe HR is unbi­
ased and reasonable in the pursuit of resolving differ­
ences. Employees must believe their problems will be 
handled in a professional and timely manner. Both 
employees and managers should believe HR will not 
take sides in favor of one party or the other.
HR also takes on the role of developing training 
programs so the company has a trained and skilled 
workforce. HR continues to grow in response to many 
companies’ development and continued growth.
Application
HR still holds grievance hearings, etc. but only 
12.5 percent of the US workforce is unionized. 
Most unions are in the government sector and the 
traditional heavy industries such as automobile 
manufacturing.
HR still processes employment applications, but 
now, instead of advertising in newspaper help wanted 
ads, HR helps departments to advertise employment 
on the company’s web site or other employment web 
sites such as monster.com. Resumes now come to HR 
via e-mail or through on-line applications. Job de­
scriptions should be available to assist HR.
HR is also tasked with developing and updating 
job descriptions. Job descriptions are necessary for 
managing the employment process. They inform an 
employee of responsibilities, duties, reporting hier­
archy, and evaluation parameters. Job descriptions 
are the joint responsibility of HR and the department 
actually employing the employee. These descriptions 
should be concise and specific — making sure to 
avoid generalities. For new candidates, the descrip­
tion provides an accurate idea of what is expected 
from an employee.
Because job evaluations and success monitoring 
are based on the job description, the employees can 
measure their success against the employment stan­
dard; the job description. All job descriptions should 
be reviewed by HR and each department head an­
nually or sooner if the position is being revised and 
changed.
In many companies, HR is the initial screener of 
candidates. For example, if a company is planning 
to add another accountant, the initial HR screening 
maybe used to “weed out” the non-degreed can­
didates or candidates without the necessary back­
ground. The needs and requirements will vary from 
department to department.
To assist in the hiring process, HR must ensure the 
candidate is acceptable and qualified. The informa­
tion provided on the employment application must 
be verified. All references should be checked. Work 
history must be verified. Educational background 
and degrees should be checked. If the company re­
quires back ground and credit checks, these also 
must be reviewed and verified. Please note that not 
all companies require these types of checks. Many 
companies now require drug testing. HR has the re­
sponsibility to order the tests and review them when 
received. All these requirements assure the company 
that the candidate is acceptable.
In another important area, the company should 
have an employee handbook which is given to all 
employees, particularly new employees. Normally, 
the handbook is written by HR because HR is the 

Principles of Business: Management
Labor Relations & Human Resource Management
165
repository of company rules and procedures re­
garding employment. The handbook should cover 
and include all areas of employment activities such 
as holidays (paid or not), grievance procedures, com­
pany’s mission statement, promotion guidelines, va­
cations, etc. The handbook should be as detailed and 
specific or as general as management requires.
HR is routinely tasked with reviewing and updating 
the handbook. Many companies use ring binders for 
their handbook so old pages can be removed and 
new revised pages inserted without having to reprint 
a new handbook every time a change takes place. It 
is most important that HR keep the handbook up to 
date to reflect changes in company policies and the 
legal changes required by law.
Another area of HR’s involvement is the develop­
ment of the company’s organizational chart. Many 
companies use the organization chart to identify re­
porting responsibilities, e.g. who reports to whom. 
The best organizational chart is one based upon 
functionality. Who, for example, should the ac­
counting function report to? A well-conceived chart 
should address all company functions. People come 
and go, but the functions will remain. Organizational 
charts are a pictorial representation of a company’s 
activities. Employees will find a reporting hierarchy 
easier to visualize. HR needs to maintain and update 
the chart as needed, but must, at the very least, per­
form annual reviews of the chart.
HR is responsible for maintaining current benefits 
information for all employees. If benefits are to be 
changed or adjusted, HR will research and then ad­
vise management of the best choice(s). Once man­
agement has decided, HR will install and administer 
the new benefit program. The task of administration 
includes enrollment, answering questions, verifica­
tion of enrollment, distributing benefit pamphlets 
or booklets, and maintaining liaison with the benefit 
provider. HR becomes the information resource for 
employee benefits.
Part of the benefits monitoring process includes 
the benefit improvements and employment practices 
of competing companies. In order to stay competitive 
and attract the best candidates, HR should closely 
monitor other companies for competitive wages and 
benefits.
HR must be knowledgeable and familiar with all 
types of benefit programs the company offers so that 
programs can be monitored for effectiveness and 
usage. Benefits range from medical benefits to dental 
benefits to death benefits to disability benefits to 
adoption benefits to vision benefits, etc. Employees 
normally come to HR for answers and help. HR 
should be familiar with all insurance forms used by 
benefit providers so employees can fill out the forms 
accurately to receive payment with no delay.
HR also maintains and updates legal changes in 
company rules and policies with regards to employ­
ment and benefits. Management will undoubtedly 
request HR to give its opinion and input about legal 
changes. Such changes may include the areas of di­
versity, discrimination and harassment, equal em­
ployment opportunity (EEO), affirmative action, pri­
vacy, and employee rights.
Federal and state legislation normally applies to 
most companies and therefore provides a “level” 
playing field. Beyond the level field, opportunities 
exist for a company to present itself as an attractive 
employer and recruit the best candidates. HR should 
reveal these opportunities.
HR also takes part in the bidding process between 
benefit providers. HR’s job is to solicit bids for ser­
vices in order to maximize benefits and minimize 
cost. If HR develops strong working relationships 
with benefit vendors, every cost saving opportunity 
can be exploited.
In union/management negotiation, HR has a 
major role to play regarding benefits. Every wage and 
benefit addition has a cost and HR must be able to 
calculate that cost. Management will rely on HR to 
provide dollar amounts to the labor contract changes 
so that everyone in the negotiations will have knowl­
edge of the true costs of doing business. HR becomes 
a valuable tool in the negotiations.
Another area of a company’s activities in which HR 
performs a critical function is training and employee 
development. Every employee brings to the company 
some education and skills. It’s HR’s task to harvest 
and improve employee skills to help all to become 
more valuable and contributing employees.
The whole process of training and development 
begins with the new employee’s orientation. First 
impressions are lasting impressions. Usually, the first 
people an employee meets are the HR people. These 
people need to be bright, enthusiastic, helpful, and 
positive. New employees will have many questions 
about the company and the employee’s coming role 
in the company. HR should put the employee at ease 

Labor Relations & Human Resource Management

and provide all necessary information to allay any 
doubts or questions.
As employees learn their jobs and settle into the 
work environment, HR will continue to provide in­
formation and assistance to insure a smooth transi­
tion in company employment. HR will also help to 
provide any training needed to bring the employee 
up to the job requirements and skill levels. In order 
to perpetuate job improvements for the employee, 
the employee should be encouraged to attend local 
schools for upgrading skills or obtaining a relevant 
degree. HR should be available to assist and inform 
the employee on these matters. There also may be a 
possibility that the employee needs career advice.
The largest area of training for HR is in manage­
ment training. Most companies try to promote from 
within. In order to have a solid and effective manage­
ment team, employees’ skills need to be developed 
by the company. HR is responsible for providing in­
ternal and external management training. Local col­
leges can provide management or management re­
lated courses. HR should have working relationships 
with these educational vendors that offer courses 
that are valuable to honing in-house talent.
Some employees have yearly professional devel­
opment courses they must take to retain their li­
censes, e.g. accountants, nurses, doctors, etc. HR 
should be familiar with these professional needs and 
arrange with the employee to fulfill these require­
ments. In job descriptions and career development 
rules, training and educational requirements will be 
listed. Employees focused on promotion may need 
course(s) to satisfy job requirements.
Training can also keep employees fresh in their 
outlook and skills. Employees performing the same 
job day after day, week after week, month after month 
. . . can become stagnant and bored. New challenges 
can revitalize employees’ outlook and morale. HR 
can provide a positive and forward thinking work 
environment.
If a company has a stated preference for pro­
moting from within, HR should review employment 
files for possible promotions and promotion require­
ments. Promoting from within is a powerful and ef­
fective morale builder. If employees know opportu­
nity exists, they will strive to perform well in their 
job, knowing that if the job is well done, there maybe 
other jobs with better pay available. Promotion is also 
a great retention tool. If an employee is unable to 
succeed in one area of employment, perhaps move­
ment to another area will improve the employee’s 
performance.
HR also has responsibilities in the area of motiva­
tion. Not every employee will be positive and happy 
every day. On any given day, some employees will 
have low morale. Maybe a supervisor is having med­
ical problems affecting their attitude and work. HR 
should identify these difficulties and problems and 
try to alleviate the issues surrounding these prob­
lems. Not every problem is solvable, but HR must be 
in the forefront to try and help.
Another way to motivate employees and increase 
morale and teamwork is company sponsored leisure 
activities. These can take many forms. Some compa­
nies have setup co-ed basketball teams between dif­
ferent departments. These activities allow employees 
to relax and get to know their fellow employees in 
an informal atmosphere. Or maybe an employee 
has a hobby which others are interested in. Seminars 
and workshops can be presented. The number of 
leisure activities is only limited to HR’s imagination. 
Traditional motivators are employee of the month 
awards, suggestion boxes, and production achieve­
ment (individual or team) awards.
Ultimately, HR is in the business of working with em­
ployees (people). It is a peoples’ business. Employees 
are the company’s greatest resource. HR can provide 
an open positive environment so employees have 
answers and help. HR can help resolve employee-
management issues with a fair and open-minded de­
meanor in order to deal with important differences. 
Maybe an employee has a serious drinking problem. 
Terminating the employee may be the final solution, 
but if the employee is a good worker, maybe alternate 
steps can be taken to help the employee overcome his 
problem or maybe some type of rehabilitation.
Wellness programs are an area where HR can take 
the lead and encourage employees to live a healthier 
lifestyle. This can range from quit smoking seminars 
to exercise programs for all ages. If a company has 
a web site, the employee section can offer healthy 
eating tips and cooking recipes for better living.
Beside the more traditional HR activities, there 
are other areas in which HR can be involved due to 
a lack of necessary resources within the company. 
Sometimes, HR manages the receptionist and the 
business office. Or HR can become the travel agency 
for the company.

Health and safety is sometimes handled by HR. HR 
many times is part of software development or part 
of a purchasing group. Sometimes, company news­
letters and internal memorandums are the respon­
sibility of HR. In addition, HR sometimes maintains 
the company web site and updates the site as needed, 
particularly in the employment area. On-line applica­
tions should be handled by HR.
One of the biggest issues facing businesses today 
is employee privacy. HR should assist management in 
developing and establishing a company-wide policy 
regarding privacy, both corporate and personal. No 
information should be given out or released to any 
one outside the company without management’s ap­
proval. Internally, anyone requesting information 
regarding an employee must justify the request and 
have upper management’s approval. All employee 
information must be safeguarded and secure. All 
files should be reviewed annually by the employee 
and management and any unnecessary information 
should be removed and destroyed.
CONCLUSION
In closing, HR people should possess a wide range of 
knowledge in the management and the operation of a 
company. To complete their training and education, 
HR personnel should take a variety of business courses 
in school so HR can have a firm grip on all areas of 
management. HR people should be generalists in the 
company. HR employees need to continually sharpen 
and learn new skills to be a beneficial contributor to 
the value of the company. The core competencies 
mentioned previously are the necessary starting point 
for HR. As the business grows and changes, HR must 
continue to expand and develop new expertise.

Leadership & Motivation
ABSTRACT
This article will focus on the relationship between 
leadership and motivation. A history of leadership 
theory is presented, followed by the link between lead­
ership and motivation as it pertains to today’s main­
stream leadership theories. The major theories of 
motivation are presented in the context of leadership. 
This article will explore how leadership theories have 
developed and converged, and how motivation has 
become an integral part of the leadership construct.
OVERVIEW
Leadership is not a new concept in organizational 
theory. While many leadership theories have devel­
oped and converged in the last century, most busi­
ness professionals and scholars consider leadership 
to be a critical individual skill set for employees that 
are committed to helping their organization succeed 
and to helping their own careers develop. Part of the 
leadership construct is the ability to motivate one’s 
constituents, whether they are subordinates, peers, or 
others in an employee’s work group. The best leaders 
know how to intrinsically motivate and inspire their 
employees through a variety of techniques. This ar­
ticle will explore how leadership theories have de­
veloped and converged, and how motivation has be­
come an integral part of the leadership construct.
Evolution of Leadership Theory
In the last two centuries, many theories of leadership 
were developed and considered valid during their 
time. However, in most cases, each new theory was 
generally short-lived, with a new one quickly following. 
There is a logical progression of leadership theories 
through which many of them converged to create 
Transformational Leadership Theory, today’s predom­
inate and current mainstream leadership theory.
The Great Man Theory & Scientific Management
In the 1920’s, Frederick Taylor was instrumental in 
applying a much-needed management model, based 
on productivity, after the tremendous factory boom 
caused by the Industrial Revolution. No longer were 
organizations small, and operating out of the home 
through small shop owners or agricultural farmers. 
Instead, the birth and fast expansion of large-scale

factories were changing the face of the workplace. 
Wren (2005) stated, “The Industrial Revolution had 
provided the impetus; Taylor provided the synthesis” 
(p. 274). Taylor was the first to expose the impor­
tance of worker productivity through studying the 
motions and habits of production workers. He was 
the first to functionally separate the “manager” from 
the “worker,” by essentially classifying the worker as 
the one who does the work, and the manager as the 
one who makes the decisions.
At the same time, simple yet formal leadership 
theories began to develop. These theories were sim­
plistic and without scholarly research and empirical 
data. The predominate leadership theory that ex­
isted during the Scientific Management era was the 
Great Man Theory developed by Thomas Carlyle 
(1841-1907). Dorfman’s study (as cited in Tirmizi, 
2002) stated, “According to this theory, a leader was 
a person gifted by heredity with unique qualities that 
differentiated him from his followers” (p.270). This 
was the first theory that laid the foundation for several 
subsequent trait-based theories that evolved decades 
later, and were often referred to as the Trait Period or 
Trait Theories. In the meantime, beside Carlyle’s Man 
theory, the practice of leadership was being molded by 
the factories and production lines, and by the work of 
Frederick Taylor. Taylor’s work in these areas was very 
authoritarian. According to Rost (as cited in Harrison, 
1999), “From 1900 to 1930, leadership definitions fo­
cused on control and centralization of power.” Taylor’s 
work clearly had influences not only management de­
velopment, but also on leadership methods.
As new leader’s emerged, scholars realized that 
there were some inconsistencies in the Great Man 
Theory. The reality was that there were many re­
spected leaders that were quite different from each 
other, which questioned the validity of Carlyle’s as­
sertion. In addition, Taylor’s work with management 
theory also demonstrated some inadequacies. There 
was clearly something missing with viewing the em­
ployee as just a ‘tool’ to get the work done, and the 
theories’ ineffectiveness was likely due to the lack of 
in-depth scholarly research and empirical data. This 
led to the next era of leadership theory, which was 
primarily centered on relationships and behavior.
Behavior Era of Leadership
Mary Parker Follet was one of the first people to 
introduce elements of psychology theory into the 
workplace, and viewed leadership from a group 
and organizational perspective. These views subse­
quently developed into the fields often referred to as 
Organizational Behavior and Human Relations, of which 
leadership is a critical component. This period in 
time is often referred to as the Behavior Era in leader­
ship theory development (Van Seters & Field, 1990).
The Behavioral Era in leadership theory was the 
genesis of the classic argument about whether leaders 
are born or made: nature versus nurture. Where the 
trait theories supported the idea that leaders are 
born (leadership skills are hereditary), the behav­
ioral theories contented that leaders can be trained 
by modifying their behavior to emulate the behavior 
of past effective leaders. These two schools of thought 
diverged after World War II. Stogdill (1975) opined 
that one theory was based on the role of the leader 
while the other was based on relationship between 
leaders and their followers, and the effectiveness of 
group performance. Nearing the tail end of this pe­
riod, behavioral theories took over as “Carter (1953) 
and Startle (1956) maintained that the trait approach 
had reached a dead-end and suggested that the atten­
tion be directed toward the behavior of the leader” 
(Stogdill, 1975).
The early behavioral theories began with studies 
done at Ohio State University and the University of 
Michigan. The focus of these theories was on what ef­
fective leaders do, and not on what they are. For the 
first time in history, leadership theories now became 
multi-dimensional. Johns and Moser (1989) stated, 
“The University of Michigan leadership studies under 
the direction of Likert and the Ohio State leadership 
studies under the direction of Stodgill and Shartle 
were antithetical to the trait or single-continuum ap­
proach” (p. 116). Leadership theories now included 
both task and relationship elements.
Behavioral theories subsequently converged with 
the continued development of management princi­
ples. One example is Blake and Mouton’s managerial 
grid, which plotted consideration against initiating 
structure, and another example is McGregor’s devel­
opment of the Theories X and Y (Van Seters et al., 
1990). From this point forward, the development of 
leadership theories had begun to emerge at a pro­
gressively rapid rate.
Where supporting research in the past had been 
thin to none, this era was full of scholarly research 
and empirical data relating to leadership. As a result,

the theories became more applicable than ever, and 
researchers felt as if they have made tremendous 
progress toward finally defining leadership. In their 
studies, Johns and Moser (1989) stated, “Empirical 
research began to challenge personal trait and one-
dimensional views of leadership. Empirical studies 
suggested that leadership is a dynamic process 
varying from situation to situation with changes in 
leaders, followers, and situations” (p. 116). Scholarly 
research had finally taken foot in the development of 
leadership theories.
Situational, Contingency, & Transformational Era of 
Leadership
The pace of management development and the 
evolution of new management theories accelerated 
significantly from the 1960s to the present, and the 
knowledge and information available for continued 
management and leadership studies is abundant. 
Wren (2005) stated, “It is not possible to examine the 
full extent of modern management writings, for they 
are too diverse and too extensive for any in-depth anal­
ysis” (p. 395). During this time, the evolution of lead­
ership theories was also at a record pace, and research 
findings were at an all-time high as more scholars set 
out to finally define the concept of leadership.
Scholars continued to discover that trait and be­
havior theories were not enough, and that there was 
still something missing. They discovered that leaders 
who went beyond modeling their behavior after 
previous leaders by adjusting how they act to situa­
tions became more effective. This led to two theo­
ries that are commonly used in organizations today: 
the Situation and Contingency theories. Fielder’s 
concept of Situational Favorability was based on 
influencing others (Maslanka, 2004). The Hersey-
Blanchard situational model continued building on 
previous task-relationship models, and added the ele­
ment of the readiness of the follower. This was a sig­
nificant development, because it meant that leader­
ship might be more about the relationship between 
the manager and subordinate, and less about the 
leader himself, including his or her traits or behavior. 
The idea of leadership being a function of the rela­
tionship was expanded upon by House and Mitchell’s 
path-goal theory (Maslanka, 2004). Leadership theo­
ries had evolved from being based on the individual, 
to being based on the relationship between the 
leader and the follower.
Leadership theories began to emerge around the 
concept that it takes two to tango. Theories now went 
beyond the relationship, and included groups and 
teams. From Vroom and Yetton’s Normative model 
came the idea that the environment also plays a 
critical role for the effective leader, by placing sig­
nificance on the need for acceptance and/or quality 
within the organization. In addition, scholars began 
to realize that theories were starting to converge. 
Leadership theories during the contingency stage in­
cluded elements from past throes, such as behavior, 
personality, influence, and situation (Van Seters et 
al., 1990). For example, Wren (2005) points out that 
Max Weber’s Charisma theory from the scientific 
Management era returned to leadership theory after 
remaining dormant for many years. The research 
and empirical data became as sound and valid as 
ever, yet scholars still maintained that something was 
missing. The theories were not well-integrated, and 
they were difficult to put into practice (Van Seters 
et al., 1990). In other words, while the research and 
data was sound, the theories could not be effectively 
employed.
This led to the development of the two most re­
cent leadership theories, transactional and trans­
formational leadership. Kinicki & Williams (2003) 
define transactional leadership as “focusing on clari­
fying employees’ roles and task requirements and 
providing rewards and punishments contingent on 
performance” (p. 464). While effectively gaining 
compliance, transactional leadership failed to gain 
commitment from followers. Transformational lead­
ership solved this dilemma. Kinicki and Williams 
(2003) defined Transformational leadership as 
something that “transforms employees to pursue or­
ganizational goals over self-interests” (p.465). Tirmizi 
(2002) opined, “Transformational leadership is de­
fined in terms of the leader’s effect on followers. They 
feel trust, admiration, loyalty, and respect toward the 
leader and they are motivated to do more than they 
originally expected to do” (p. 270). Most scholars 
today agree that the most effective style of leader­
ship is one that combines elements of both transac­
tional and transformational leadership. Antonakis 
and House (as cited in Kinicki and Williams, 2003. 
p.465) have researched this subject and came to the 
conclusion that a combination of these two leader­
ship styles, with an emphasis on the transformational 
portion, is the best method for leaders to motivate

171
their employees. The implication of this suggests that 
a good leader must adapt to the necessary leadership 
style for different situations and objectives. These two 
leadership theories finally closed the loop with re­
search and effectiveness. They are validated through 
extensive research, and are also effectively employed 
in the workplace.
Current State of Leadership Theory
The evolution of leadership theories clearly shows a 
convergence of ideas over more than two centuries 
into the mainstream theories of today. The first main 
convergence of ideas came in the 1970s with the 
contingency theories. The theories combined new 
ideas with elements of past theories that had been 
discarded as invalid or inapplicable. These theories 
contained elements of the Great Man and Trait theo­
ries, behavioral theories, influence-based theories 
and situational theories (Van Seters et al., 1990), but 
remained stand-alone theories. The second main 
convergence of theories came with the transactional 
and transformational leadership theories. Not only 
did these theories contain elements from past theo­
ries but they were well-integrated and could easily be 
applied to today’s organizations. Wren (2005) stated, 
“Leadership theories cycled from traits through con­
tingency notions and back to leader styles and leader-
member relations in transformational, charismatic, 
transactional, and leader-member exchange theories 
(p. 454). In addition to these points of convergence, 
theories have progressed from being based on the in­
dividual, to dyad of manager and subordinate, to the 
group, and finally to the organization.
Today’s leadership theories have become com­
plex and specialized. Since the development of 
transformational leadership, other mainstream theo­
ries have emerged. Some examples include Level 5 
leadership (Collins, 2001), leadership best practices 
(Kouzes & Posner, 2003), Servant leadership (Joseph 
& Winston, 2005), contingent leadership (Manning, 
2013), and leadership by creating a learning organi­
zation (Senge, 1990). Transformative leadership is 
described by Caldwell et al. (2012) as an ethical ap­
proach that seeks the benefit of all stakeholders with 
sustained wealth creation as a goal.
A Linkage between Motivation & Leadership
With the historical evolution of leadership in per­
spective, one can begin to understand the linkage 
between motivation and leadership. In a well-known 
Harvard Business Review article, Kotter (2001) set 
out to describe the differences between leadership 
and management. In the article, Kotter suggested 
that leadership is about dealing with change, while 
management is about dealing with complexity. Kotter 
explained that leaders set directions while managers 
plan and budget; leaders align people while managers 
organize and hire staff, and leaders motivate people 
while managers control and problem solve. The ar­
ticle was based on the continued discussion on this 
topic since being introduced by Abraham Zeleznik in 
1977 (Kotter, 2001). In the article, Kotter referred to 
the argument by stating, “the theoreticians of scien­
tific management, with their organizational diagrams 
and time-and-motion studies, were missing half the 
picture-the half filled with inspiration, vision, and the 
full spectrum of human drives and desires. The study 
of leadership hasn’t been the same since. Within this 
perspective, motivation is clearly a significant part of 
the leadership construct.
Another example of how motivation and leader­
ship are linked can be seen in how transformational 
leadership is defined. Bass (1999) discussed the 
importance of the leader-follower relationship in 
a transformational leadership setting. Bass stated, 
“Transformational leadership refers to the leader 
moving the follower beyond the immediate self-
interest through idealized influence (charisma), 
inspiration, intellectual stimulation, or individual­
ized consideration. It elevates the follower’s level of 
maturity and ideals as well as concerns for achieve­
ment, self-actualization, and the well-being of others, 
the organization, and society” (p.11). Further, Bass 
(1999) asserts that these four factors will result in the 
followers wanting to identify with this leadership. In 
other words, a leader who embraces and practices 
these elements of leadership would certainly help 
motivate his or her employees to achieve common 
organizational goals.
A third linkage between leadership and moti­
vation can be observed in the five best leadership 
practices as presented by Kouzes and Posner (2003). 
Kouzes and Posner (2003) stated, “As we looked 
deeper into the dynamic process of leadership, 
through case analysis and survey questionnaires, we 
uncovered five practices common to personal-best 
leadership experiences” (p.73). These five practices 
are (1) model the way, (2) inspire a shared vision, 

Leadership & Motivation
Principles of Business: Management
172
(3) challenge the process, (4) enable others to act, 
and (5) encourage the heart. The authors asserted 
that by following these practices, employees could be 
intrinsically motivated to be committed to the orga­
nization’s goals and objectives. These five behaviors 
are directly related to motivating the employee, es­
pecially in reference to inspiration, encouragement, 
and empowerment.
By looking at these examples of current leadership 
theory, one can see how motivation is linked to lead­
ership and how motivation is a critical aspect within 
modern leadership theory. With this link now set, a 
closer look of what motivation is, and how a leader 
can incorporate motivational techniques in the work­
place can be discussed.
Application
Organizational practitioners often concentrate on 
developing leaders and managers to effectively moti­
vate their employees. Kinicki and Kreitner (2006) de­
fined motivation as “those of psychological processes 
that caused the arousal, direction, and persistence 
of voluntary actions that are goal directed” (p.149). 
The employee’s performance is directly related to 
how motivated they are to achieve their goals. Having 
the skills alone is often not enough for an employee 
to achieve high performance at their job. As such, it 
is the leaders’ jobs to motivate their employees to the 
extent that they can achieve high performance with 
their current skills and limitations. Motivation can be 
looked at from three perspectives: needs, process and 
reinforcement (Lussier, 2005). The needs theories of 
motivation are critical to the effectiveness of one’s 
leadership. It is in the context of the needs theories 
that the leadership principles discussed in the first 
section can be applied. The process and reinforce­
ment theories of motivation are better viewed from 
a management perspective, rather than a leadership 
perspective. The following sections give an overview 
of the most well-known needs theories of motivation.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
The most widely known motivational theory preached 
by today’s organizational practitioners is Maslow’s 
Hierarchy of Needs Theory. Tutt (1989) noted that 
human behavior continues to be based on instinct, and 
that humans desire to fulfill their institutional needs. 
The theory suggests that one’s needs are categorized 
into five categories of a hierarchy- that is, one must 
satisfy the lowest level of needs before satisfying the 
higher level needs. These levels, from lowest to highest, 
are physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, 
esteem needs, and the need for self-actualization 
(Lussier, 2005). Many suggest that excellent leaders un­
derstand where their employee’s needs fall within this 
hierarchy, and as such can satisfy them accordingly.
McClelland’s Needs Theory
A second widely-used needs theory was developed by 
David McClelland (Kinicki et al., 2006). McClelland 
suggested that individuals have three needs: a need for 
achievement, a need for power, and a need for affilia­
tion. He suggested that every individual is different with 
regards to his or her needs, and in order to adequately 
motivate someone, a leader should have a clear under­
standing of their own employees needs with regards to 
these three areas. For example, someone with a high 
needs for affiliation might be well-suited for a human 
resources position, while someone with a high need for 
achievement might be well-suited for a sales position. 
Understanding each employee as a unique individual 
can help a leader or manager determine the best posi­
tion and the best job tasks for a particular employee.
Herzberg’s Hygiene Theory
The third prevalent “needs” theory was developed 
by Frederick Herzberg, and is often referred to as 
Hygiene theory of job satisfaction (Kinicki et al., 
2006). Herzberg suggested that organizations have 
things that can be classified as satisfiers and dissatis­
fiers, and that in order to satisfy and motivate em­
ployees; a leader and manager should alleviate the 
things that dissatisfy employees and improve the 
things that satisfy employees. Such things as rules and 
regulations, salary, work environment, and supervi­
sors are examples of things that are classified as dissat­
isfiers, or hygiene factors. Promotion opportunities, 
learning opportunities, job recognition, and chal­
lenging work are things that are classified as satisfiers. 
While both are important to motivating an employee, 
oftentimes organizations only concentrate on re­
moving the dissatisfiers, which does not intrinsically 
motivate the employee, especially in the long run.
Viewpoint
Leadership and motivation have a direct relation­
ship to employee performance. Leadership theories 
have evolved since the late 1800s, and today’s current 

Principles of Business: Management
Leadership & Motivation
173
leadership theories include motivation as a major part 
of their construct. Mainstream leadership theories such 
as Bass’s transformational leadership, Collins’ Level 
5 leadership, and Kouzes and Posner’s best practices 
of leadership are built on the concept that effective 
leaders need to know how to motivate their employees. 
Motivation theories can be broken down into needs, 
process, and behavioral reinforcement. Leadership 
relies heavily on understanding the needs of theories 
of motivation, such as Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, 
McClelland’s need theory, and Herzberg’s hygiene 
theory of job satisfaction. A leader can be most effective 
by understanding the needs of his or her employees, 
which will result in optimizing the overall performance 
of the leaders’ constituents as well as the organization.

Legal Environment of Business
ABSTRACT
Article explores the legal environments that directly 
impact today’s businesses and corporations by pro­
viding an overview of the major legal realms and legal 
structures that impact business and business prac­
tices. The role law plays in the world of business and 
its implications to the business professional, as well 
as, the major sources of law and their intent to either 
control, regulate, or assist current business practices.
OVERVIEW
The legal environment of business refers to the code 
of conduct that defines the legal boundaries for busi­
ness activity. To understand these boundaries, it is es­
sential to first have a basic understanding of the law 
and how it affects businesses and business practices. 
The nature of business spans over a number of legal 
realms, all of which are continuously influenced by 
the needs and demands of the business community, 
consumers, and the government. Each has a distinct 
stake and voice in this vibrant legal environment.
Nature of Law
The study of the legal environment of business encom­
passes numerous approaches and philosophical theo­
ries. The exploration of what law is and how it is defined 
has been examined by numerous legal philosophers.
Legal Traditionalists
The legal traditionalists view law as a body of princi­
ples and rules that courts `utilize when deciding dis­
putes. The traditionalist approach is steeped in the 
belief that the basic constructs of right and wrong are 
fixated even though society is continuously changing 
its beliefs.
Environmental Approach
The environmental approach views law as an arm of 
societal control that must continuously reflect the cur­
rent society’s moral constructs through the enforce­
ment of rules, regulations, and laws. This approach is 
much broader in scope, since the law is an institution 
that reflects the societal need for social order.
Sociological Jurisprudence Theorists
Sociological jurisprudence theorists profess that so­
ciety ultimately shapes and molds the law and the 
mechanisms for its enforcement. This school of 
thought views the legal system and the law as a means 
of providing an orderly, predictable system of social 
order, change, and legal reform.
These theories lead to similar conclusions; the 
primary function of law is to maintain social, po­
litical, and economic stability, while simultaneously 
balancing the need and ability to implement change. 
To accomplish this successfully, laws have been cat­
egorically classified.

Classifications of Law
To make sense out of huge body of information, 
laws are placed into various categories. Although 
a number of classifications are possible, the most 
useful categories utilized are:

 Substantive and Procedural

 Civil and Criminal
Basic to the understanding of these classifications 
are the terms right and duty.
A right is the ability of a person with the help of 
the law, to demand someone else to perform or to 
cease engaging in a certain activity.
A duty on the other hand, is a commitment placed 
upon a person to engage in or desist engaging in a 
certain activity. These two concepts are correlatives, 
meaning that no right can rest upon one person without 
a corresponding duty resting upon some other person.
Substantive Law & Procedural Law
Substantive Law
Substantive law includes all those laws that define, 
regulate, and create legal rights and obligations. A 
rule stating that promises are enforced only where 
each party receives something of value from the 
other party is part substantive law. An example of this 
would be business contracts and contract obligations.
Procedural Law
Procedural law, on the other hand, establishes the 
methods for enforcing the rights that are established 
by substantive law. For example, questions about how 
a lawsuit should begin, what papers need to be filed, 
which court the suit should go to, which witnesses can 
be called, and so on are all questions of procedural law.
Essentially, substantive law relays our rights and 
entitlements under the law, while procedural law de­
lineates our legal obligations and duties that need to 
be undertaken to obtain the benefits of those rights.
Civil Law & Criminal Law
Civil Law
Civil law refers to the laws that define the duties ex­
isting between individuals or legal entities (meaning 
corporations). This body of law (better known as torts) 
deals with the infringement of one person or legal en­
tity on the legally recognized rights of another. Civil 
law violations appear in business in numerous ways. It 
is the basis of employment violations, breaches of con­
tracts, product liability and copyright infringement.
Criminal Law
Criminal law differs from civil law in that it is an act pro­
hibited by law for the protection of the public at large. 
Criminal violations in business occur when individuals, 
in a position of authority, commit criminal actions ei­
ther against individuals, the company, or the consumer.
“Under the doctrine of respondent superior, a cor­
poration may be held criminally liable for the illegal 
acts of its directors, officers, employees, and agents. 
To hold a corporation liable for these actions, the 
government must establish that the corporate agent’s 
actions were within the scope of his/her duties and 
were intended, at least in part, to benefit the corpora­
tion” (Michel, 2003, p.1).
These types of criminal acts are often referred to 
as white collar crimes. This catch-all phrase was origi­
nally coined by Edwin Sutherland in 1939. Sutherland 
defined it as “a crime committed by a person of re­
spectability and high social status in the course of his 
occupation.” White-collar crimes usually involve fraud, 
bankruptcy fraud, bribery, insider trading, embezzle­
ment, computer crime, medical crime, public corrup­
tion, identity theft, environmental crime, pension fund 
crime, RICO crimes, consumer fraud, occupational 
crime, securities fraud, financial fraud, and forgery.
Sources of Law
With a basic understanding of the classifications of law, 
the next question that comes to mind is what are the 
sources of law and where are laws found? Laws derive 
from federal and state constitutions, federal treaties, 
interstate compacts, federal and state statutes and ex­
ecutive orders, ordinances of municipal governments, 
the rules and regulations of federal and state adminis­
trative agencies, and federal and state court decisions.
The United States Constitution
The U.S. Constitution (adopted 1787, ratified 1788) 
is considered the “supreme law.” A law in violation of 
the Constitution, no matter what the source, will not 
be enforced by the courts. Similarly, the state consti­
tutions are supreme within their respective borders, 
though keep in mind that all law in the United States 
is subordinate to the Federal Constitution. No law, 
Federal or State, is valid if it is in violation of the 
Federal Constitution.

The U.S. Constitution also creates and limits 
the power of the government. Examples of the ex­
clusive regulatory federal powers created by the US 
Constitution include: the power to establish laws re­
garding bankruptcy, to grant patents, trademarks, 
and copyrights, and to coin currency. One area of 
the US Constitution that perhaps has the greatest 
impact on U.S. businesses is the commerce clause 
contained in the Tenth Amendment. The commerce 
clause grants virtually complete power to the Federal 
Government to regulate the economy and business. 
This includes transportation of goods across state 
lines, consumer warranties and credit transactions, 
electronic funds transfers, residential and commer­
cial real estate transactions, consumer and employee 
safety, labor relations, civil rights in employment, 
transactions in securities, environmental protections, 
and taxation.
The federal government’s power to tax is subject 
to three limitations. First, taxes (excluding income 
tax) must be apportioned among the states. Second, 
all custom duties and excise taxes must be uniform 
throughout the United States. Lastly, no duties may 
be levied upon exports from any state. Taxes also 
have regulatory effects. For example, import taxes 
and custom duties that are meant to protect domestic 
industry from foreign competition and tax credits 
which are meant to encourage investments in fa­
vorable enterprises and disadvantage unfavorable 
enterprises.
Statutory Law
Statutes are enacted by Congress and the various 
state legislative bodies. This constitutes what is better 
known as statutory law.
An example of a statutory scheme that has had 
a tremendous impact on corporations has been the 
Securities Act of 1933 and The Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934. Both of these were enacted by congress 
to avoid another stock market crash like the one in 
1929. Congress designed both these Acts to prohibit 
various forms of fraud and to stabilize the securities 
industry by requiring that all essential information 
concerning the issue of stock be made available to 
the investing public.
The 1933 Act is basically a disclosure statute and 
paper act. This means that the act permits a corpo­
ration to sell “junk” (or referred at the time as junk 
bonds) as long as appropriate disclosures are made 
through registration statements and prospectus de­
livery. The major aspects of the act include:

 Issuers of securities must file registration statement

 Prospectuses must be provided to all purchasers of 
new issues with full and fair disclosures

 Fraudulent activity in connection with under­
writing and issuing of all securities is prohibited.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was a further 
reaction by the legislature to the crash of 1929. It 
picks up where the Act of 1933 finished, by addressing 
fraudulent practices in the secondary market.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has often 
been referred to as the People Act since it regulates 
all persons involved in trading securities on behalf of 
customers. It encompasses the regulation and regis­
tration of brokers and dealers and national security 
associations.
What is most fascinating about the 1934 Act are 
the agencies and regulations it was responsible 
for creating. For example, the creation of the SEC 
(Security and Exchange Commission), regulations 
of credit by the Federal Reserve Board, regulations 
of insider trading, and reporting requirements for is­
suers are all the direct result of the enactment of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
In the early twenty-first century, the most signifi­
cant statutory scheme regulating corporations was 
the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act in 2002. 
SOX requires top management to personally certify 
the accuracy of financial information, boosts the over­
sight responsibilities of boards of directors, and pro­
hibits the outsourcing of internal audit functions to 
a company’s external auditor. Prawitt, Sharp & Wood 
(2012) find that accounting risk is more closely asso­
ciated with the quality of IAF and that oursourcing all 
or parts of IAF to an external auditor reduced rather 
than exacerbated risk; however, Singer & You (2011) 
reported greater invester confidence following SOX 
and the resulting flurry of financial restatements. 
After the financial crisis of 2008, in which large com­
panies failed while their executives received substan­
tial compensation packages, the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) 
was passed. Dodd-Frank requires a nonbinding 
shareholder vote on compansation for top execu­
tives. Though a number of lawsuits were brought by 
shareholders after negative votes were overruled by

boards, courts were inclined to dismiss cases on pro­
cedural grounds. As plaintiff switched tactics, legal 
expenses for companies mounted and settlements 
became common. By 2013, the legal environment 
surrounding executive compensation at public com­
panies remained troubled (Wilkerson, 2013).
Case Law & Judicial Precedent
Courts are responsible for adjudicating alleged vio­
lations of and disagreements that arise under legal 
jurisdiction. The courts are responsible for inter­
preting the law. A courts interpretation of the law is 
dependent upon previous court interpretations of 
the law; this is referred to as the “principle of stare 
decisis,” or simply, precedent. Stare decisis ensures 
consistency and predictability in the law and in in­
terpretation. In situations where the precedent is un­
favorable to a particular case, attempts are made to 
differentiate the current case from the former case 
and decision.
It is the responsibility of the higher courts to re­
solve any inconsistencies in rulings; the ultimate 
court being The Supreme Court, whose rulings apply 
to all the lower federal courts. Stare decisis also ap­
plies in the various state court systems.
Stare decisis is exemplified in the case that was 
brought against Enron’s accounting firm Arthur 
Anderson. Charges of obstructing an official pro­
ceeding of the Securities and Exchange Commission 
was filed against the accounting firm in a Texas 
District Court in 2002. The jury found Arthur 
Anderson guilty. Anderson Corporation appealed 
the decision to the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Fifth Circuit. The fifth circuit affirmed the dis­
trict court’s decision (stare decisis). Arthur Andersen v. 
United States, 73 U.S.L.W. 4393 (2002)]
Common Law
When there is no particular statute or provision, 
common law is said to exist. Common law is a col­
lection of judicial decisions, customs, and general 
principles upon which federal and state courts rely. 
Because many state legislatures refrain from ruling 
on multiple contigencies, common law holds high 
importance, especially in contract disputes.
In response to common law, a secondary area 
of legal authority was developed. Beginning in the 
1920’s a distinguished group of judges, lawyers, and 
law school professors established the American Law 
Institute, known as the ALI. The ALI composed “re­
statements of the general common law of the United 
States, including in that term not only the law devel­
oped solely by judicial decision, but also the law that 
has grown from the application by the courts of stat­
utes that were generally enacted and were in force for 
many years.” [Wolkin, (1940) Restatements of the Law: 
Origin, Preparation, Availability, 21 Ohio B.A, Rept. 
663] These restatements cover many important areas 
of common law that include: torts, contracts, agency 
law, property, and trusts.
Administrative Law
Administrative law is the branch of public law cre­
ated by administrative agencies. It is important that 
we look at Administrative law, since Administrative 
agencies create rules, regulations, orders, and act as 
the primary interpreters and enforcers of business 
regulatory schemes like the Security and Exchange 
Commission, U.S. Federal Trade Commission, 
Equal 
Employment 
Opportunity 
Commission, 
Occupational Safety & Health Administration, and 
Environmental Protection Agency. They possess both 
judicial authority as well as executive powers. Keep in 
mind that Administrative agencies are created by fed­
eral, state, and local governments. When Congress 
enacts a statute, it often creates an administrative 
agency to administer the statute and creates adminis­
trative rules and procedures that reflect the agency’s 
needs and ability to effectively operate.
Codification of Law
Codifications of law came about due to demands by 
the business community lobbying for uniformity in 
commercial transactions. These tenacious efforts led 
to the development of uniform business protocols. 
One of the best known of these codifications has been 
the Uniform Commercial Code; better known as the 
UCC. After its completion in 1952, the UCC was sys­
tematically adopted by 49 states (except Louisiana).
The 
NCCUSL 
(National 
Conference 
of 
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws) besides 
drafting the UCC also drafted more that 200 uniform 
laws including the Uniform Partnership Act, the 
Uniform Limited Partnership Act, and the Unified 
Probate Code. These codifications expanded and 
codified existing commercial transaction law; uni­
fying the states’ business legal frameworks specific to 
the business community’s needs.

Keep in mind the impact this has had on the ex­
panding national economy. Prior to these codifica­
tions, most states had enacted statutes dealing with 
branches of commercial law, resulting in great diver­
sity among states which ultimately was detrimental to 
commerce on a national scale. These codifications 
unified commercial enterprise leading to a more ef­
fective and productive national economy.
CONCLUSION
The legal environments of business and the areas of 
existing legal precedence that touch and affect busi­
nesses and the business community on a daily basis 
are vast. Whether it is criminal, civil, constitutional, 
statutory, common, or administrative, all have a stake 
in business and commerce and therefore influence 
the business horizon as we know it today. Business 
professionals need to not only think and act globally, 
but also understand the underling legal fabric that

Logistics Management
ABSTRACT
This article examines the subject of Logistics 
Management. Topics covered include working defini­
tions of the terms logistics management and supply 
chain management, and an outline of the various activi­
ties involved in the logistics management process. Also, 
we highlight the key supply chain management pro­
cesses and the relationship each plays in conjunction 
with logistics management. A practical example of logis­
tics management in action is provided, along with the 
various logistic management activities and terms of art.
OVERVIEW
Supply Chain Management
Supply chain management is not a new concept—nor 
is logistics management. The actual practice of logistics 
management has its first recorded origins in annals of 
military history from the times of the ancient Romans 
and Greeks, whereby armies employed basic logistics 
principles to make sure that their respective armies 
were adequately equipped with needed supplies for 
waging warfare. Commercial businesses, driven by the 
process of transforming raw materials in the manufac­
turing process, have always engaged in supply chain 
management on some level. However, the phrase 
supply chain management was first coined by the con­
sulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton back in 1982.
Oftentimes, logistics management and supply-
chain management are used interchangeably by 
supply chain management professionals. Yet, they 
are entirely separate concepts. The distinction lies in 
the fact that logistics management is a subset of ac­
tivities within the broader supply chain management 
process. Thus, no meaningful discussion of logistics 
management can take place without a solid footing 
in supply chain management. The Council of Supply 
Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP) recog­
nizes this distinction of logistics management as a 
component of supply-chain management.
Definitions of Supply Chain Management
The CSCMP defines supply chain management as:
”Supply chain management encompasses the 
planning and management of all activities involved in 
sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all logis­
tics management activities. Importantly, it also includes 
coordination and collaboration with channel partners, 
which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third party ser­
vice providers, and customers. In essence, supply chain 
management integrates supply and demand manage­
ment within and across companies” (CSMP, n.d.).
Similarly, yet in more plain language, the National 
Alcohol Beverage Control Association (NABCA) de­
fines supply chain management as:
”Supply chain management is a set of approaches 
used to efficiently integrate suppliers, manufacturers, 
warehouses, and customers so that merchandise is 
produced and distributed at the right quantities, to 
the right locations, and at the right time in order to 
minimize system wide costs while satisfying service-
level requirements” (NABCA, 2004).
Therefore, a typical supply chain consists of an 
integrated, coordinated network of suppliers, man­
ufacturers, warehouses, distributors, and retailers, 
through which parts, raw materials, and subassem­
blies are acquired, transformed, and delivered to 
the ultimate customer (see Figure 1). Simply stated, 
supply chain management (also known as SCM) in­
cludes the following supply chain functions of: plan­
ning, buying decisions, making products, storing 
products, moving products, selling products, and 
handling of returns from customers. By its very na­
ture, supply chain management requires effective 
collaboration, i.e., real-time, accurate communica­
tion and information exchange among the various 
supply chain partners, as well as the functional 
areas in a company, such as marketing, finance, and 
operations.
Note that an AMR Research study of supply chain 
organizations identified the following goals related 
to supply chain management (Hillman, 2006):

 Manage and reduce materials costs;

 Optimize overall internal supply chain costs;

 Reduce supply chain risk;

 Improve manufacturing efficiency;

 Enhance customer service;

 Understand customer/end-user demand.

Cleary, firms gain a competitive advantage when 
they are able to achieve these stated goals. The ben­
efits of effective supply chain management can range 
from higher productivity, lower supply costs, greater 
customer loyalty, lower inventory carry costs while 
increasing inventory turnover, decreasing transpor­
tation costs, and order fulfillment costs—to name a 
few. Combined together, these improvements nor­
mally translate into increasing company profits and 
increased market share—certainly a desirable state of 
affairs for any company.
Core Business Processes
Aside from understanding the goals related to supply 
chain management, a fundamental grasp of supply 
chain management requires an essential under­
standing of the core business processes involved in 
supply chain management. The Global Supply Chain 
Forum of the Ohio State University identifies eight 
key supply chain management processes and the rela­
tionship each plays with respect to the logistics man­
agement function (Lambert, 2004):
1.	 Customer relationship management—key cus­
tomers and customer groups are identified. The 
logistics function interfaces with customer rela­
tionship management in that logistics capabilities 
are determined in light of the firm’s identified 
customers.
2.	 Customer service management is the administra­
tion and coordination of key suppliers and cus­
tomers. The role of logistics management is to out­
line key performance specifications for suppliers 
in alignment with customer requirements and ex­
pectations.
3.	 Demand management balances customer require­
ments with supply chain capabilities, matching 
supply and demand with minimal disruptions. 
Logistics’ role is to produce reliable and accurate 
forecasts for the demand management process.
4.	 Order fulfillment entails those activities for de­
fining customer requirements and designing an 
order fulfillment network, which enable firms to 
meet customer requests. Network planning is pro­
vided by logistics management in designing and 
operating the information systems necessary for 
accurate and cost-effective order fulfillment.
5.	 Manufacturing flow management includes all 
activities necessary to provide the timely and ef­
ficient ability to manage a variety of products in 
the supply chain and to move products through a 
company’s plants. Prioritization criteria are devel­
oped by logistics in moving products through the 
manufacturing plant.
6.	 Supplier relationship management identifies key 
suppliers based on the capabilities of these sup­
pliers and the needs of the firm. In turn, the logis­
tics management function manages the inbound 
flow of parts, supplies, and raw materials needed 
in the production process.
7.	 Product development and commercialization pro­
vides the structure for working with customers and 
suppliers to develop products and market them 
to potential customers. Working closely with mar­
keting and operations, logistics management es­
tablishes movement requirements that enable the 
delivery of products to the final consumer.
8.	 Returns management is the process dealing 
with product returns, namely through returns-
management and return-avoidance (i.e., getting 
it right the first time). In logistics management 
parlance, this is known as reverse logistics—to be 
discussed later.
Logistics Management & Supply Chain Management
As our definition states, supply chain management 
also encompasses logistics management, which is 
mainly concerned with transportation, inventory 
management, and distribution, comprised of a 
flow of goods and information. In particular, logis­
tics management concerns all levels of the supply 
chain, which includes supplying raw materials, 
parts, subassemblies, and finished goods—which 
have inventory that must be managed, transported, 
and distributed. Vast arrays of firms employ logis­
tics management, such as: government and military 
organizations, manufacturers, transportation firms, 
retailers, warehousing companies, merchandising 
firms, and wholesale distributors. The enormity 
and importance of logistics management is ap­
parent based on figures obtained from CSCMP’s 
annual “State of Logistics Report.” The 2015 report 
indicates that logistics expenditures in the United 
States totaled more than $1.45 trillion U.S. dollars 
in 2014. Comparatively speaking, this expenditure 
equals 8.3 percent of nominal U.S. GDP (gross do­
mestic product) for year 2014—a massive expense 
(Schulz, 2015).

Logistics Management
The Council of Supply Chain Management 
Professionals (CSCMP) defines logistics manage­
ment as:
”Logistics management is that part of supply 
chain management that plans, implements, and con­
trols the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow 
and storage of goods, services and related informa­
tion between the point of origin and the point of con­
sumption in order to meet customers’ requirements. 
Logistics may have either internal focus (inbound 
logistics), or external focus (outbound logistics) cov­
ering the flow and storage of materials from point of 
origin to point of consumption” (CSCMP, n.d., 4).
”Logistics management activities typically include 
inbound and outbound transportation management, 
fleet management, warehousing, materials handling, 
order fulfillment, logistics network design, inventory 
management, supply/demand planning, and man­
agement of third-party logistics services providers. To 
varying degrees, the logistics function also includes 
sourcing and procurement, production planning and 
scheduling, packaging and assembly, and customer 
service. It is involved in all levels of planning and ex­
ecution—strategic, operational and tactical. Logistics 
management is an integrating function, which coor­
dinates and optimizes all logistics activities, as well as 
integrates logistics activities with other functions in­
cluding marketing, sales manufacturing, finance, and 
information technology” (Rao, 2009). See figure 2.
Notice that within this definition of logistics man­
agement, it refers to the forward and reverse flow of 
goods and information from the point of origin to 
the point of consumption. This reverse flow is known 
as reverse logistics (see Figure 3). “Reverse logistics is 
the process of moving returned goods from their con­
sumer destination for the purpose of capturing value 
or proper disposal. It includes processing returned 
merchandise due to damage, seasonal inventory, re­
stock, salvage, recalls, and excess inventory, as well 
as packaging and shipping materials from the end 
user or reseller” (Blanchard, 2007). Reverse logistics 
costs are sizable—estimated to be approximately a 
half percent of the total US GDP—accounting for ap­
proximately $ 58.34 Billion in expense for year 2004 
in the U.S. (Rogers, Lambert, Croxton & Garcia-
Dastugue, 2002).
Essentially, logistics management is the manage­
ment of the movement of goods and information, 
i.e., all of the shipping and delivering decisions, get­
ting raw materials, parts or supplies, from vendorto 
the manufacturer and delivering the finished prod­
ucts from the manufacturer to the distributors, who 
in turn deliver to retailers for ultimate delivery to 
consumers. In practical terms, logistics management 
involves the art and science of getting the right ma­
terials, to the right place, in the right quantities, at 
the right price, with the right quality, at the right 
time. Due to the fact that effective logistics are so 
vital to the success of a business, managing these 
decisions is critical. The bottom line is this: logis­
tics management is an important way for companies 
to minimize costs and to enhance their overall cus­
tomer service.
Firms Providing Integrated Logistics Management 
Solutions
Firms such as Schneider Logistics, DHL Logistics, 
Exel, UPS Supply Chain, and FedEx Supply Chain 
Services, are examples of firms that offer integrated 
logistics management solutions to other companies. 
They are known as third-party logistics providers 
(3PL providers). Stated another way, 3PL provider

refers to the outsourcing of a logistics function(s). On 
the flip side, you have what are known as fourth-party 
logistics providers (4PL providers). 4PL providers are 
organizations that select and manage 3PL providers 
based on what they determine to be the most optimal 
logistics management solutions for a given firm. In 
other words, a 4PL organization creates unique logis­
tics management solutions that cannot be achieved 
by any single 3PL provider.
As mentioned before, the main objectives of a 
logistics management system are to maximize cus­
tomer service and to minimize the total cost of its ac­
tivities. In other words, the goal is to add value to the 
customer and reduce the cost of adding that value. 
Unfortunately, not all firms manage logistics man­
agement effectively or efficiently. For example, fail­
ures may be rooted in poor data quality upon which 
logistics decisions rely, improper management of the 
overall logistics management function, or some un­
expected natural calamity. These failures cause dis­
ruptions along the entire supply chain, e.g., missing 
raw material and parts, which cause production de­
lays, causing late orders, in turn generating customer 
dissatisfaction. Realizing that such disruptions ul­
timately result in a loss of customers, interruptions 
along the supply chain are something no business 
can afford in today’s competitive global marketplace.
APPLICATIONS
Let’s consider a real-life example of how the logis­
tics management process flows in the overall supply 
chain. A good illustration is that of Campbell Soup 
Company—well-known for their variety and quality 
soups provided to the food industry. When opening 
a can of soup, few people wonder how a can of soup 
and its various component parts ended up in their 
kitchen cabinet. It all starts with the supply chain 
and the logistics management function (see Figure 4 
below).Though our example only shows a single sup­
plier, distributor, and retailer for Campbell Soup Co., 
a large manufacturer of their size and scope likely has 
numerous suppliers, distributors, and retailers. Also, 
in this example, we are viewing the supply chain only 
from the viewpoint of Campbell Soup. Yet, we can 
also diagram the supply chain from the perspective of 
the other companies involved, such as Alcoa, Silgan 
Holdings, or Kroger, as well, or any other Campbell 
Soup Co. supplier, distributor, or retailer.
For illustrative purposes, the supply chain process 
for Campbell Soup Co. begins with Alcoa—a supplier 
of extracted aluminum necessary in the production 
of aluminum cans. Alcoa then ships rolls of alu­
minum to Silgan Holdings, a producer who converts 
the aluminum into soup cans. Since Alcoa is an indi­
rect supplier to Campbell, Alcoa is known as a tier-2 
supplier. Silgan Holdings, a customer of Alcoa and 
supplier to Campbell Soup, in turn sells their manu­
factured aluminum cans to Campbell Soup Co., who 
at this point is a customer of Silgan Holdings. As a 
supplier to Campbell Soup Co., Silgan Holding is 
known as a tier-1 supplier in that they directly supply 
cans to Campbell Soup Co. Campbell Soup then sup­
plies its customer, Bridgetown Foods, (a wholesale 
food distributor), with cans of soup, who in turn ships 
and distributes Campbell’s Soup to grocery retailers, 
such as Kroger Company, who then sell Campbell’s 
Soup to the ultimate customer. This is noteworthy in 
the sense that most of the participants along a supply 
chain are both suppliers and customers.
Inbound & Outbound Logistics
Through it all, the entire process of moving raw mate­
rials, parts, and supplies to the manufacturer, and the 
process of moving the finished good (i.e., soup) is the 
designated role carried out by the logistics manage­
ment function. At this point, a couple of terms need 
defining: inbound logistics and outbound logistics.

 Inbound logistics involves the materials handling, 
transportation, receipt, and warehousing of raw 
materials, parts, and supplies, and their distribu­
tion to manufacturing as they are needed in the 
production process. In the case of Alcoa and 
Silgan Holdings supplying Campbell Soup Co., 
this represents inbound logistics.

 Outbound logistics consists of activities involving 
materials handling, order fulfillment, packaging, 
transportation, warehousing, and distribution of 
finished products to the ultimate consumer. When 
Campbell forwards cans of soup (the finished 
product) to its distributor (Bridgetown Foods), 
which then forwards the product to the retailer 
(Kroger), these transactions are examples of out­
bound logistics.
As the diagram below (Figure 4) shows, the flow 
of goods and information travels in a forward and 

Principles of Business: Management

183
reverse direction along the entire supply chain. For 
instance, Silgan Holdings places an order with Alcoa 
for a certain amount of aluminum rolls, resulting in 
Alcoa shipping the order of aluminum to Silgan—
this is a forward flow of goods. Or, Silgan Holdings 
may return a quantity of aluminum to Alcoa for some 
reason, such as unacceptable quality, resulting in a re­
verse flow of goods—i.e., reverse logistics—a concept 
discussed earlier. Similarly, Campbell Soup Co., after 
receiving cans from its supplier Silgan Holdings, 
may likewise return defective aluminum cans to 
Silgan, again resulting in a reverse flow of goods back 
through the supply chain.
Logistics Management Activities
The following is a run-down of the various logistic 
management activities enumerated above in Figure 4. 
This outline gives a clearer perspective on the various 
activities inherent in the logistics management func­
tion and their interrelationships.
Transportation Management is concerned with 
determining the most efficient means of executing 
the movement of product, utilizing various modes 
of transportation whether it is rail, trucking, ship­
ping, or air transport. The objective is to optimize 
loads, vehicles, and drivers, with the overall objec­
tive of reducing cost and increasing transportation 
efficiencies.
Logistics Network Design concerns the design of in­
formation management systems to aid in the systematic 
planning, organizing, managing, and control in the 
areas of order fulfillment, warehouse management, 
transportation management, materials handling, in­
ventory management, and supply/demand planning. 
The system integrates with enterprise resource systems 
in the purchasing of raw materials and parts, manu­
facturing, marketing and sales functions. Likewise, by 
necessity, logistics professionals interface with all of an 
organization’s functional areas, i.e., operations, mar­
keting, sales, and finance. Thus, logistics network de­
sign facilitates collaboration and integration amongst 
the various parties in the supply chain relationship.
Logistics 
Collaboration 
has 
been 
encour­
aged through an industry-wide initiative known 
as 
Collaborative 
Planning 
Forecasting 
and 
Replenishment (CPFR). CFRR is a Voluntary Inter-
Industry Commerce Standards Association (VICS) 
committee made up of retailers, manufacturers, 
and solution providers. In this system, partner firms 
exchange information on product sales and predic­
tions in order to align their operational plans to en­
able automatic product replenishment and conse­
quently increase the overall efficiency of the supply 
chain (http://www.vics.org/committees/cpfr/).
Fleet Management involves managing a firm’s 
private and/or contracted fleet for optimal use in 
transporting goods, involving such issues as fleet 
availability, condition, fleet location, maintenance, 
replacements, etc.
Warehouse Management is the management of 
the movement and storage of materials throughout 
the warehouse—including receiving, picking, and 
shipping activities.
Materials Handling concerns the physical han­
dling of goods from the time of procurement to the 
shipment phase.
Order Fulfillment refers to the activities necessary 
in responding to customer orders, e.g., receiving and 
processing orders, delivery, and handling customer 
inquiries, etc.
Inventory Management involves managing inven­
tory to match supply with demand in the most cost-ef­
fective and efficient manner. Decisions include how 
much inventory to hold, how much to order, and 
when to order.
Supply/Demand Planning is the planning process 
of matching sources of supply according to customer 
demand requirements, as well as supply chain capa­
bilities, over a given time frame.

CONCLUSION
In light of recurring natural disasters, threats of 
global terrorism, increasing global competition, and 
rising fuel costs, the effective administration of the 
supply chain and the logistics management function 
are even more of an imperative. The logistics man­
agement function plays a critical role in this regard. 
It also follows that the effective administration of the 
logistics management function is an important way 
for firms to create and sustain a competitive advan­
tage by reducing costs, increasing productivity, while 
improving customer service and increasing profits 
along with market share. At the opposite side of the 
spectrum, the end results of poor logistics manage­
ment are higher costs, a possible loss of customers, 
lower market share, and not surprisingly, lower 
profit. Indeed, the threat of poor logistics execution 
represents an enormous incentive for firms to “get 
it right the first time.” Hence, the call for effective 
logistics management is made abundantly clear.

Management Competencies
ABSTRACT
The purpose of this article is to explore the subject of 
management competencies and provide a framework 
for contextualizing competency modeling within orga­
nizations. First, a background discussion will ensue with 
an examination of the origins of competency modeling, 
along with a definition of the term “competencies.” 
From there, we’ll highlight the types of competencies 
typically employed in the construction of competency 
models. We’ll then transition to the various approaches 
for developing competency dimensions, typical organi­
zational uses for competency models, types of compe­
tency models, and management competencies as pre­
dictors of performance. The article concludes with an 
example of an actual competency model and an outline 
of some perceived drawbacks of competency modeling.
OVERVIEW
Global interest in the utilization of management 
competencies as a management tool parallels the 
recognition of human resources as the most valuable 
asset within any organization. Directly in line with this 
recognition, management competencies are gaining 
widespread usage in organizations. Competencies 
clarify work expectations, generating a common 
language that catalyzes and reinforces changes in 
individual behavior. In short, competency models 
develop a set of expectations within organizations 
that serve as benchmarks for superior performance. 
However, as shall be seen, there are several beneficial 
aspects associated with competency models.
Origins of competency-based methodology are 
grounded largely in the research of Harvard behav­
ioral psychologist David McClelland in the 1970s, and 
management theorist Richard Boyatzis’s research in 
the 1980s. McClelland (1973), in his article “Testing 
for competence rather than for intelligence,” made 
the case for competency modeling as opposed to 
intelligence testing, proposing that intelligence 
test scores are not reliable predictors of job success. 
Essentially, McClelland’s competency methodology 
focused on the identification of key behaviors in high 
performers versus lesser performers.
Management 
competency 
pioneer, 
Richard 
Boyatzis (1982), is noted for his work in competency 
modeling as a predictor of effective manager perfor­
mance. Boyatzis defines competencies as “an under­
lying characteristic of an employee (i.e., motive, trait, 
skill, aspects of one’s self image, social role, or a body 
of knowledge) which results in effective, and/or su­
perior performance in a job” (Boyatzis, 1982, p.20). 
Likewise, Seal, Boyatzis and Bailey (2006, p. 193) state:
”In the purest sense, a competency is defined as a 
capability or ability that leads to a successful outcome. 
It is a set of related but distinct sets of behaviors orga­
nized around an underlying purpose or goal, called 
the “intent.” Competencies, therefore, are the result 
of appropriate behaviors used effectively in the situ­
ation or time to further the underlying goal or pur­
pose that emerges from the intent.”
Additionally, LeBleu and Sobkowiak (1995), 
summarize competency modeling by stating: “In 
its crudest form, it is a yardstick for measuring how 
someone is performing, comparing current perfor­
mance to an ideal, and suggesting actions that can be 
taken to improve that performance.”
Types of Competencies
Competencies span three broad categories (Byham 
& Moyer, 1996).
1.	 Organizational Competencies—those unique com­
petitive attributes that form the basis upon which 
organizations compete—sometimes referred to as 
core competencies. It is an organizational strength 
that gives an organization a competitive advantage 
over competitors. For example, Dell Computer’s 
core competence lies in superior supply chain man­

agement—namely their superior efficiency in the 
procurement of production parts/supplies, manu­
facturing processes, and their distribution system.
2.	 Personal Competencies—characteristics repre­
senting general standards for acceptable perfor­
mance (level of achievement or output) in a given 
role. Consider the job of a sales manager. A sales 
manager is said to have personal competency if 
they can adequately perform at a level typically 
expected of a sales manager. Thus, personal com­
petence is the ability to adequately perform in a 
given job—as opposed to superior performance.
3.	 Job/Role Competencies—skills and behaviors 
necessary to achieve superior performance in a 
specific job, role, function, task, duty, organiza­
tional level, or entire organization. Job/role com­
petencies are the focus of this article. These job/
role competencies exist on a number of job levels 
(Byham & Moyer, 1996):
• A role (leader of a meeting);
• A job or position (a manufacturing team leader);
• A job level (first-line leaders);
• Several job levels (middle management);
• A broad band of jobs (professional/ technical 
jobs);
• An entire organization.
It is these job/role competencies that provide the 
footing for our discussion. Job/role competencies 
measure knowledge, skills, and abilities shown to pre­
dict superior performance. As applied to managers in 
organizations, job/role competencies define effective 
management performance and are thought of as man­
agement competencies. Throughout the remainder 
of this article, the terms competency and manage­
ment competencies shall be used interchangeably.
Job/role competencies may be broken down into 
a number of observable items, i.e. behavior, knowl­
edge, and motivation (Bynam & Moyer,1996).
Behavioral Competency: Behaviors a person ex­
hibits that result in good performance—that which 
a person says or does that determines performance.
Example: Consider the HR competency dimen­
sion of performance management. A manager would 
be expected to exhibit certain behaviors such as 
communicating clear performance standards, moni­
toring employees’ performance, providing perfor­
mance feedback and recommending corrective ac­
tion when necessary.
The most widely used behavioral competencies are:
1.	 Team orientation;
2.	 Communication skills;
3.	 People management;
4.	 Customer focus;
5.	 Results orientation;
6.	 Problem-solving; and
7.	 Planning and organizing (Rankin, 2005).
Knowledge Competency: A person’s knowledge of 
facts, technologies, processes, or procedures related 
to their job. Diplomas, licenses, certificates, as well as 
a person’s ability to apply their knowledge, are signs 
of such knowledge competency.
Motivational Competency: An individual’s feeling 
about their job, organization, or geographic location 
which may impact upon performance. Motivational 
competencies focus on the motivational aspects of 
proper job fit, organizational fit, or location fit. Generally 
motivational competencies cannot be developed.
Example: The position of sales manager requires 
an entrepreneurial orientation as manifested by a 
predisposition to seeking out opportunities, and a 
willingness to take calculated risks. If a sales manager 
is lacking these qualities, a poor job fit results and 
that individual would most likely lack the motivation 
and ability to perform at high levels.
Competency Models in Organizations
Research affirms that competency models are widely 
deployed, with adoption rates likely to increase in the 
future. A UK-based benchmarking study (Rankin, 
2005) of competencies in organizations found that 
60% of respondents had a competency framework 
in place. Of those firms lacking a competency frame­
work, about half (48%) intended to introduce one 
in the future. Furthermore, among those organiza­
tions with competency frameworks, approximately 
four out of five employees (78%) were included in 
their competency model. Also, one-half (50%) of the 
firms reported having a single, common competency 
framework across the entire organization.
Changes in the business world have made the use 
of management competency models more prevalent 
for the following reasons (Byham & Moyer, 1996):

 Rapidly changing, team-oriented, and “virtual” or­
ganizations mean that the traditional definitions 

Management Competencies
Principles of Business: Management
188
of jobs are increasingly rare. Thus, management 
competencies fill the void by clearly defining what 
is expected of employees.
 Flattened organizations with fewer layers have fewer 
advancement opportunities that translate to a more 
horizontal selection process—creating less room for 
error due to a smaller number of promotional jobs. 
This phenomenon increases the need for defining 
and using competencies to aid in selection accuracy.

 With a more dynamic workplace and the path to 
advancement less clear, well defined competencies 
provide better self-guidance in career planning. 
As individuals become increasingly responsible for 
their career planning, career guidance assistance 
is needed. Competencies provide this needed as­
sistance.

 With increased overlap between employee and 
management roles, clearly defined work roles are 
imperative. Competencies fill the void by clari­
fying organizational expectations and individual 
responses.

 Global workforce requirements require an ability 
to operate effectively in cross-cultural assign­
ments. Competencies are uniquely suited to pro­
viding benchmarks for uniform standards that can 
be applied worldwide (Byham & Moyer, 1996).
APPLICATIONS
Approaches to Defining Competencies
There are two basic approaches to defining and de­
veloping competencies in organizations—the behav­
ioral approach and the clinical approach (Byham & 
Moyer, 1996). The behavioral approach concentrates 
on behaviors, motivations, and knowledge relevant 
to a particular job—i.e. job-relevant behavior. On 
the other hand, the clinical approach identifies un­
derlying personal characteristics of the individual as 
the basis for defining competencies; independent of 
any job connection. In essence, the clinical approach 
targets the personal characteristics of superior per­
formers. Unless otherwise stated, our discussion re­
lies on the behavioral approach—the approach most 
widely used in developing competencies.
Competency Model Types
The following is an overview of competency models 
involving US-based firms (Rothwell & Lindholm, 
1999). Though the models are based on data specific 
to the US, these models may be found across cultures 
to varying degrees, regardless of country origin.

 Borrowed Approach—The easiest and least ex­
pensive competency modeling approach, the 
borrowed approach simply borrows an approach 
from an existing organization, without taking into 
consideration the uniqueness of the adopter. An 
obvious shortcoming lies in the possibility of the 
borrowed model not being appropriate for the 
borrowing organization.
 Borrowed and Tailored Approach—A variation of 
the borrowed approach is the borrowed and tailored 
approach—which borrows a competency framework 
from an existing organization, yet tailors the model 
to the borrower’s structure, culture and resources 
(human, technical, financial, informational, etc.).

 Tailored Approach—As its name suggests, the 
tailored approach tailors a competency model 
according to the unique needs of the organiza­
tion. The process-driven and outputs-driven ap­
proaches are classic tailored approaches that have 
been in use for some time and are more com­
monly utilized. Several new approaches are the in­
vented approach, the trends-driven approach, and 
the work responsibilities approach.

 Process-driven Approach—Emphasizes work pro­
cess (job activities, personal characteristics, behav­
iors) required for exemplary job performance.

 Outputs-driven Approach—Identifies key outputs 
of a given job that successful performers produce. 
Competencies are then developed based on these 
key outputs.

 Invented Approach—A new competency model 
is developed without regard to an existing ap­
proach. This approach is used when exemplary 
performers are unavailable or the organization is 
about to undergo drastic changes.

 Trends-driven 
Approach—Focuses 
on 
what 
people must know or be able to do in response to 
managing a changing environment.

 Work responsibilities-driven Approach—”Derives 
work outputs, competencies, roles, and quality 
requirements from work responsibilities or activi­
ties” (Rothwell & Lindholm, 1999, p.99).
Competency Model Uses
Early usage of competency models focused on 
two areas: performance management and career

development. These early models typically applied 
primarily to senior managerial personnel (Rankin, 
2005). However, management competency frame­
works are now being applied across the entire range 
of the human resource management function. For 
example, the various uses of competency models are:

 Executive development

 Recruitment and selection

 Compensation

 Performance appraisal

 Career development

 Job design

 Organization design

 Training and development

 Training needs analyses

 Succession Planning (LeBleu & Sobkowiak, 1995) 
(Bynam & Moyer, 1996)
Also, Rankin (2005) goes further in identifying 
(in order) the primary applications of competency 
models in organizations:

 Performance reviews/appraisal

 Improving employee effectiveness

 Achieving greater organizational effectiveness

 Training needs analysis

 Career management
Management Competencies & Performance
In the 1970s, the American Management Association 
(AMA) and McBer Company (a consulting company 
founded by David McClelland) studied 1800 man­
agers over a 5 year period, with the aim of identifying 
the competencies of successful managers. The result 
of their research yielded five management compe­
tencies deemed essential in determining a manager’s 
job success (Rothwell & Lindholm, 1999):
1.	 Specialized knowledge
2.	 Intellectual maturity
3.	 Entrepreneurial maturity
4.	 Interpersonal maturity
5.	 On-the-job maturity
Research verifies a number of management 
competencies serving as accurate predictors of out­
standing manager performance (Boyatzis, R., Stubbs 
& Taylor, 2002). These competencies reside within 
three broad categories:
Cognitive or intellectual ability, as in the ability 
to make sense out of complex scenarios with any 
number of conflicting and sometimes obscure vari­
ables which may affect decisions;
Intrapersonal abilities, such as personal adaptability, 
i.e. the ability and willingness to deal with change;
Interpersonal abilities, (sometimes referred to as 
emotional intelligence), motivating others to per­
form, network, communicate, etc.
An important additional ingredient is a person’s 
desire to apply their ability in any one of the afore­
mentioned areas. Without the requisite desire to use 
these abilities, competencies lose their quality for 
predicting outstanding performance (Boyatzis, R., 
Stubbs, & Taylor, 2002).
A Competency Model
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), (the pri­
mary federal agency for conducting and supporting 
medical research) developed an organization-wide 
competency model for its entire workforce. NIH 
defines competencies as “the combination of knowl­
edge, skills and abilities that contribute to individual 
and organizational performance.” Suggested uses for 
the model are decisions pertaining to recruitment 
and selection, promotion readiness, selection and 
approval of training, and leadership readiness
(http://hr.od.nih.gov/workingatnih/competen­
cies/faqs.htm).
The NIH Competency Model comprises of three 
components: Core competencies, administrative 
leadership and management, and occupation-spe­
cific areas. Core competencies form the foundation 
of the NIH model and represent the knowledge, 
skills and abilities required of all NIH employees—
regardless of function. Occupation-specific com­
petencies represent the set of knowledge, skills and 
abilities expected within a particular functional area 
(e.g., Accounting, Contracting, Human Resources, 
Information Technology, etc.). Also, NIH managers 
and supervisors must display an additional set of com­
petencies in Leadership and Management. Within 
each competency dimension, individuals are rated 
on a proficiency scale of ‘not applicable’ to a high 
score of 5 which indicates Expert proficiency. (The 
rating NIH Proficiency Scale is as follows: N/A—Not 

Management Competencies
Principles of Business: Management
190
applicable, 0—Not Demonstrated, 1—Fundamental 
Awareness, 
2—Novice, 
3—Intermediate, 
4—
Advanced, 5—Expert.)
I. Core competencies are split into Business Compe­
tencies and Communications/Interpersonal Compe­
tencies:
Business Competencies

 Enterprise Knowledge

 Analysis, Decision Making & Problem Solving

 Customer Service

 Driving Results

 Personal Effectiveness
Communications/Interpersonal Competencies

 Written Communication

 Oral Communication

 Interpersonal Effectiveness
II. Leadership & Management Competencies

 Visionary Leadership

 Developing & Managing Talent

 Strategic Decision Making
III. Occupation-Specific Competencies
Occupation-specific competencies vary according to 
occupation, i.e., an Accountant will have a different 
set of occupational competencies from that of an 
Information Technology specialist. The following 
list illustrates the occupation-specific competencies 
for NIH Information Technology Management staff 
(http://hr.od.nih.gov/workingatnih/competen­
cies/occupation-specific/2210/default.htm)

1.	 Information Technology (IT) Adeptness Possesses 
the ability to learn new technologies and the apti­
tude to understand IT concepts.
2.	 Information Technology Expertise Able to use 
the technologies needed to perform in one’s IT-
specific area and understands the technologies of 
importance to NIH Institutes.
3.	 Information Technology Awareness Keeps up to date 
with trends and changes in the technology market 
relevant to one’s area of professional expertise.
4.	 Information Technology Legislative ­Requirements 
Understands and applies comprehensive knowledge 
of government IT laws, regulations, policies and pro­

5.	 Federal and Departmental Acquisition Policies 
and Procedures Knowledge Understands the Fed­
eral Government industry and how it functions as 
a buyer of services and products.
6.	 Project Management Creates and maintains an 
environment that guides a project to its successful 
completion.
7.	 Technical Information Communication Commu­
nicates technical information in a manner consis­
tent with the level of the target audience.
Note that within each defined competency, a list 
of key behaviors serve as benchmarks for rating pur­
poses. For example, for IT Adeptness, note the key 
behaviors:
Information Technology Adeptness In-Depth 
Possesses the ability to learn new technologies and 
the aptitude to understand IT concepts.
Key Behaviors:

 Grasps the “how and why” of information tech­
nology and its opportunities and limitations.

 Shares information learned at conferences, semi­
nars, and training on new tools and technologies.

 Enhances knowledge and capabilities by engaging 
in discussions with other IT professionals.
Issues
A number of criticisms have been leveled at the con­
cept of competency modeling over the years (Rankin, 
2005). Some of the major criticisms of competency 
frameworks are:
Competency-based models can be overly elaborate 
and bureaucratic, affecting their utility to varying de­
grees. Also, they can be expensive—costing 2 to 3 mil­
lion dollars for larger organizations, and are likewise 
very time consuming to implement. Furthermore, 
in a rapidly changing environment, a given compe­
tency model may quickly become outdated, thus con­
suming additional time and expense in ensuring it 
remains relevant and up-to-date.
Also, when placing too much emphasis on em­
ployees’ inputs (competencies) instead of their actual 
production (outputs), there is a danger of favoring 
employees who are good performers in theory, but not 
in actual practice. In a similar vein, because some be­
havioral competencies are essentially personality traits 

Principles of Business: Management
Management Competencies
191
a person is unable to change, it may be more prudent 
to judge someone on what they actually achieve.
Competency modeling runs the risk of producing 
clones that mimic one another, at the risk of minimizing 
work teams with diverse skill sets who offset and balance 
the strengths and weaknesses of other team members. 
Also, because competencies are based on models of 
good performers’ past performance, this potentially 
overlooks a dynamic environment whereby new ways 
of addressing work issues may be needed. Also, if an 
organization is not very proficient in differentiating 
between successful and unsuccessful performers, com­
petency modeling adds little value to the organization.
CONCLUSION
Used correctly, competency models can be powerful, 
unifying agents for change—changing and directing 
individual behavior toward organizational goals. 
Through the clarification of organizational expecta­
tions, competency models can be instrumental drivers 
of superior performance. Aside from enhancing the 
performance 
management 
process, 
competency 
models can be effective tools for recruiting and se­
lecting the right person for the right job. Yet, compe­
tencies are also useful tools for designing jobs, career 
development, compensation planning, determining 
training and development needs, and making organi­
zational design decisions. Though there are some draw­
backs to the use of competency models, the positive 
contributions tend to outweigh any negative aspects. 
In light of the wide-ranging benefits of competency 
models and their ability to elicit superior performance, 
competency modeling has continued to gain traction.

Management Consulting
ABSTRACT
Like the people who comprise them, organizations 
are constantly changing. Sometimes these changes 
are for the better and sometimes they are not, and 
any resulting problems need to be solved. Although 
many of the day-to-day problems encountered by 
organizations can be handled internally, some are 
so deep, complex, or systemic that the objective ob­
servations and expert advice of an outside party are 
necessary. Management consultants fill this role by 
applying business or behavioral science knowledge

to the situation to diagnose and make recommen­
dations for rectifying existing business problems 
or to help in the development of future plans. The 
decision to choose a consultant is not necessarily an 
easy one, but there are several indicators to help in 
making it. Management consultants can work on a 
short-term basis supporting such activities as risk as­
sessment or strategic planning, or on a longer-term 
basis in the process of organization development, 
helping the organization become more effective and 
managing the concomitant change.
OVERVIEW
A management consultant is a qualified professional 
who works with upper level management in an orga­
nization to analyze the organization’s health and ef­
fectiveness, identify problem areas, and make recom­
mendations on how to fix the problems. Depending 
on the problem, the management consultant may 
also continue to guide the organization during the 
implementation of the recommendations. The use 
of management consultants to do these tasks is often 
a cost-effective approach to problem solving for two 
reasons. First, qualified management consultants 
typically have both more training and more experi­
ence in solving complex or systemic organizational 
problems than do managers working in the organiza­
tion. In addition, management consultants typically 
can be more objective than persons working within 
the organization because they are not entrenched 
in the organization’s culture and do not take its 
norms, values, and working assumptions for granted. 
Because management consultants are hired on a con­
tract or retainer basis and not involved in the internal 
politics or day-to-day operations of the organization, 
they do not have the same assumptions about orga­
nizational norms and culture as do those who work 
directly for the organization. As a result, they are 
better able to step back and see the big picture and 
spot where problems lie.
Management consultants can be either indepen­
dent contractors or employees of a consulting firm. 
Although there are large firms that offer management 
consulting services, most management consultants 
are individuals or small firms who specialize in these 
services. Some management consultants specialize in 
a specific type of organization (e.g., healthcare, non­
profit, service) while others are generalists who work 
with a wide range of organizations. Typically, man­
agement consultants are hired by top level manage­
ment within the organization. This means that the 
consultant will be perceived by the organization as 
having the support of top management. If the role of 
the consultant is properly introduced to the organi­
zation, this also means that employees at all levels of 
the organization will be more likely to cooperate with 
the consultant because they will see his/her presence 
as being of importance to the organization. The fact 
that the consultant is hired by top management also 
means that s/he will have access to top management 
should any problems arise in the course of the con­
sulting project or if cooperation needs to be encour­
aged. Access to top management also is important if 
the consultant’s recommendations are to be taken 
seriously and implemented properly within the orga­
nization. Without such backing, implementations are 
more likely to fail.
As outside change agents, management consul­
tants have a clear-cut role and are less likely to be af­
fected by organizational norms and culture than is 
someone who works within the organization. This 
means that the consultant is freer to approach the 
problem objectively without the burden of precon­
ceived notions of how the organization should or 
should not be working, ideas about what the problem 
is, or assumptions about who is at fault. In addition, 
most consultants tend to look at the organizational 
as a system where changes in one part have impact 
throughout the organization. This helps the consul­
tant better identify and treat underlying problems 
rather than merely treating symptoms.
There are, however, people who work as direct em­
ployees for the organization who also are also some­
times asked to do the same kinds of activities that an 
external consultant would do. Such internal consul­
tants, however, are more likely to run into problems 
in their activities and less likely to be successful for a 
number of reasons. In general, internal consultants 
are embedded in the culture of the organization, 
so they take the values, attitudes, and norms of the 
organization for granted. This makes it difficult for 
internal consultants to objectively view the organiza­
tion or diagnose its problems. In addition, since in­
ternal consultants are part of the organization, they 
tend to think in terms of what the organization has 
traditionally done rather than what can be done, and 
is more ready to accept the system as given rather

194
than see the ways that it can be improved. For the 
same reason, they also have a tendency to not want 
to rock the boat since they must continue to work in 
the organization once the change has been imple­
mented. For example, the suggestion to reduce the 
size of the organization’s workforce would be more 
difficult for an internal consultant to make than 
for an external consultant because the people who 
were to be laid off might be friends or because the 
remaining employees would see the internal consul­
tant as a “hatchet” person who laid off their friends. 
This would make continuing to be successful as an in­
ternal consultant difficult since people would be less 
likely to cooperate with further consulting efforts. 
Another negative result of internal consultants being 
part of the organization is that they have difficulty 
distinguishing the organizational forest from the 
trees, and tend to focus on a micro view rather than 
on a wider systems view that is necessary for success.
Management consultants’ activities include diag­
nosing and making recommendations for existing 
business problems or supporting organizational man­
agement in the development of future plans. One of 
the major activities of many management consultants 
is organization development, a long-range effort to 
improve the organization’s problem-solving and re­
newal processes. Organization development involves 
the application of behavioral science knowledge to 
the problems of the workplace. Management consul­
tants also may evaluate existing programs, practices, 
or procedures within the organization to determine 
their effectiveness and where and how they need to 
be improved. Management consultants can also pro­
vide expertise to organizational management in the 
areas of strategic planning and risk assessment and 
management. The management consultant often acts 
as a change agent, guiding an organization through a 
change effort to either improve current functioning 
and effectiveness or to help plan for a new path in the 
future. To be effective in these tasks, management 
consultants need to have knowledge of how to con­
duct a change effort, an understanding of the organi­
zation, and sufficient power to be able to implement 
the change. This latter qualification means that they 
need the backing of top level management to support 
their efforts and implement their recommendations.
Once the organization and the consultant mutu­
ally agree to enter into a relationship, there are several 
phases in the process, as shown in Figure 1. During 
the first phase, the consultant will learn more about 
the organization, collecting data, and diagnosing the 
problems facing the organization. During this phase, 
the consultant may use any number of techniques in 
an effort to diagnose the problems of the organization 
and determine the best way to rectify them. Some of 
these tools and techniques include questionnaires, 
individual and/or group interviews, personal observa­
tions, objective data (e.g., turnover, tardiness, market 
demographics), outside opinions, confrontation meet­
ings). Once the consultant has diagnosed the problem, 
s/he will make recommendations to management as 
to the best way to proceed. These recommendations 
are then turned into plans and implemented.
After the plans have been implemented, there fol­
lows a period of stabilization during which the em­
ployees acclimate to the new way of doing things. When 
this phase is over, the consultant will typically evaluate 
how well the change fixed the problem. Frequently, the 
problems being experienced by the organization are 
deep, complex, and systemic. Therefore, it is unlikely 
that the single application of any one tool or tech­
nique will produce lasting change. Rather, most con­
sulting efforts are iterative. If the organization is still 
experiencing difficulties, therefore, the consultant will 
do more data collection and analysis to diagnose the 
remaining problems. When this is done, the organiza­
tion and consult sever the consulting relationship.

to the health and growth of an organization, it can

or opportunity for growth can be handled internally 
and when a consultant is needed. Once the consul­
tant is hired, it is also important to understand what 
to expect and how to work with him/her in a way that 
helps maximize the effectiveness of the client/con­
sultant relationship.
Knowing When a Consultant Is Needed
Many of the day-to-day problems encountered in 
organizations can be solved by the organization in­
ternally. There are, however, some problems that are 
either outside the capabilities of the organization or 
so systemic that the help of an outside consultant are 
not only advisable, but essential. A number of indica­
tors can alert organizational management to the pos­
sible need for external, professional help.
Organizational theorists talk about two facets to 
the organization. The formal organization comprises 
those aspects of the organization that are obvious 
to all but the most casual observer. Included in the 
formal organization are its stated goals, short- and 
long-term objectives, and other data easily found in 
its annual report or strategic plan. Another aspect of 
the formal organization is the structure of the firm: 
the way it is designed in order to facilitate perfor­
mance effectiveness, including its division of labor, 
delegation of authority, and span of control (the 
number of people who directly work for a person 
on the next level of the organizational hierarchy). 
Other aspects of the formal organization include its 
resources, including its financial capital, equipment, 
and technology. Resources also include the human 
capital of the organization and the expertise of the 
organization’s employees, including knowledge, 
skills, abilities, training and education.
The formal aspects of the organization can often 
benefit from the services of a management consul­
tant. For example, management consultants can be 
very helpful to the organization in doing strategic 
planning; helping the organization better under­
stand the market and its needs, the risks associated 
with alternate plans, how to implement the plans, 
and ways to better structure the organization to sup­
port the new objectives. Similarly, management con­
sultants can be very helpful for an organization that 
needs to cope with a merger. Other dysfunctions in 
the formal organization that can indicate the need 
for an external consultant include problems in com­
munication systems, difficulties with managerial 
strategies, or inefficiencies resulting from the struc­
ture or roles within the organization. Management 
consultants can help organizations deconstruct 
symptoms in these areas to understand the under­
lying problems and develop and implement appro­
priate plans that will correct not only the symptom, 
but the underlying problem.
In addition to the formal organization, there is an 
informal aspect to each organization comprised of 
less obvious aspects such as attitudes, values, feelings, 
interactions, and group norms. Such factors are part 
of the organizational culture; the set of basic shared 
assumptions, values, and beliefs that affect the way 
employees act within an organization. Because these 
aspects are not written down like the formal aspects 
of the organization, they can be easily dismissed as 
not important. However, they have a profound im­
pact on the functioning of the organization and its 
concomitant health and effectiveness. In fact, like 
the proverbial iceberg, most theorists believe that 
the majority of organizational problems stem from 
aspects of the informal organization. Dysfunction 
in these aspects of the organization is more likely to 
be seen by a managerial consultant as an objective 
outside observer than by someone who is entrenched 
within those aspects as a member of the organization.
Organizational culture is one of the major fac­
tors that can affect the effectiveness of the organiza­
tion. For example, an organizational culture that is 
very formal (e.g., with a suit-and-tie dress code and 
highly structured communication channel requiring 
multiple layers of approval before an innovation may 
be implemented) is unlikely to foster the entrepre­
neurial spirit necessary to be on the leading edge 
of the industry, surviving on sustainable innovation. 
Similarly, the norms of the organization -- the stan­
dards or patterns of behavior that are accepted as 
normal within the culture—can increase or hamper 
its effectiveness. Another aspect of the informal orga­
nization that can have great impact on effectiveness is 
its values. For example, a company that builds training 
devices for the military will have difficulty being suc­
cessful in its field if it sees itself as an engineering 
company that happens to build training equipment. 
To be truly effective in this situation, engineering is a 
support service that designs the equipment to meet 
the needs identified by the training function. If this 
is not understood, the resulting product would be a 
well-engineered product that does not train well.

Management Consulting
Principles of Business: Management

Another aspect of the informal organization that 
is important to the effectiveness of the organization 
and that often requires the help of an external con­
sultant, is worker motivation. Understanding the 
values of one’s workers, for example, can help the or­
ganization understand how to better motivate them. 
However, such information is often obtained more 
easily by an external consultant not only because of 
his/her training, but also because employees are less 
likely to talk openly about values or offer criticisms 
to management who has power over them in the or­
ganizational setting. Most management consultants 
are not only neutral third parties who can objectively 
diagnose the problems of the organization, they also 
keep the identities of individuals from whom they 
collected the data confidential—even from man­
agement in the organization. This enables them to 
collect the data needed for this diagnosis and better 
help the organization.
A parallel in the informal organization to the com­
munication patterns in the formal organization are 
conflicts or other difficulties in intra- or inter-group 
cooperation. As discussed above, most employees are 
typically more willing to give honest feedback to an 
objective outside party than they would be to their 
own management. This means that an external con­
sultant will be better able to deconstruct the situation 
to determine the underlying problem and recom­
mend better, more appropriate potential solutions.
Choosing a Consultant
Choosing a consultant is like choosing any other 
professional, including a lawyer, accountant, or phy­
sician: One must attempt to find the best person 
for the job based on the need and the consultant’s 
credentials. Although anyone can call themselves 
a management consultant, it is important to make 
sure that they have an adequate education to back 
up their claims. No matter how experienced a person 
is, if s/he does not have an education in the broader 
principles, tools, and techniques of management 
consulting, s/he will only be able to extrapolate what 
s/he has done on previous jobs. However, every or­
ganization is different and the needs of every orga­
nization are also different. Some consultants offer 
solutions looking for problems, however, rather 
than recognizing the uniqueness of each organiza­
tion and determining what is needed for each situ­
ation and developing a targeted solution based on 
this information. Similarly, other consultants try to 
give advice based on a few isolated cases without suf­
ficient knowledge or education to underpin their 
recommendations. However, mere extrapolation of a 
few isolated cases is unlikely to be successful. There 
are a wide range of tools and techniques that can be 
applied to diagnosing an organization’s problems. 
Successful diagnosis is often based on an iterative 
process using multiple techniques. If the consultant 
only offers a single approach based on limited past 
experience, it is best to be wary.
In addition to the appropriate educational back­
ground, a good consultant will also have experience 
in management consulting. Depending on the needs 
of the organization, this can be general manage­
ment consulting experience or consulting experi­
ence within a specific industry. As when hiring any 
professional, it is important to check the consultant’s 
references before making the decision to enter into 
a formal consulting relationship. In addition, each 
consultant will have his/own personality just as each 
organization has its own culture. Most consultants 
are willing to engage in an initial exploratory con­
sultation to see if there is a good fit between the con­
sultant’s expertise and the needs of the organization.
Working with a Management Consultant
Although the management consultant may have 
more objectivity and be able to bring different in­
sights to bear on the problems facing the organiza­
tion, s/he cannot solve all the problems of the orga­
nization alone. The management consulting process 
is a collaborative effort requiring the involvement 
and commitment of both the consultant and the or­
ganization. To help ensure that the change process is 
successful, top management within the organization 
must support the effort. This includes assurance that 
change will occur and gives the consultant a power 
base out of which to operate. If top management 
is not behind the change effort, no matter how ap­
propriate the consultant’s recommendations, they 
will not be implemented or, worse, not implemented 
properly. This could potentially leave the organiza­
tion worse off than it was before.
Top management in the organization is not the 
only level of employee involvement needed to help 
ensure the success of the relationship, however. In 
addition, key management at all levels of the orga­
nization need to be involved in the change process. 

Principles of Business: Management
Management Information Systems
197
This will help ensure that plans and decisions are not 
being made too far from the source of the problem 
and that the consultant will receive all necessary data 
and feedback to make the intervention successful. 
Further, any employees who will be affected by the 
proposed changes need to be informed and involved 
as soon as possible. If not, serious repercussions 
could occur, including job dissatisfaction and lack of 
motivation (both on the job and in supporting the 
change effort).

ABSTRACT
This article will focus on management information 
systems. The hardware and software components of 
management information systems are reviewed along 
with the type of organization functions for which 
applications software is designed to support. Three 
business strategies that drive the development and 
deployment of management information systems - 
cost-reduction, quality-improvement, and revenue-
growth - will be introduced and serve as the founda­
tion for the discussion of the types of management 
information systems that can be implemented to 
support the strategies. Opportunities and challenges

presented by the use of the Internet as an integral 
part of management information systems are also ex­
amined along with an analysis of staffing challenges 
for information technology (IT) departments.
OVERVIEW
Management information systems are comprised 
of computing and communications hardware, op­
erating system software, applications software to 
support business functions, and specialized staff to 
analyze and design systems that help to achieve busi­
ness goals and objectives. Management information 
systems support a broad array of business operations 
and enable interaction with an organization’s sup­
pliers, customers and service providers.
The selection and deployment of computer sys­
tems and communications hardware is driven by 
the size of an organization, the computing and com­
munications needs of the business sector in which 
an organization competes and the geographical 
dispersion of operations. The capacity of computer 
systems ranges from powerful mainframe systems 
that support enterprise needs, servers that provide 
specialized functionality, and desktop units that en­
able individual employees to access the computing 
and communications resources of their organization. 
Each hardware component is controlled and man­
aged by its own specialized operating system software.
Computer systems are comprised of several com­
ponents including central processors, memory, 
storage and a communications interface. The central 
processor is a chip designed to execute commands 
from the operating system software and applications 
programs. The memory of the computer provides 
capacity for the central processor to perform the 
functions which the operating system and applica­
tions software provide computer users. Disk storage 
provides capacity to store applications programs, da­
tabases, text files, and graphic files used in the pro­
grams or that are created by users in the performance 
of their job duties. The communications interface is 
the device (an interface card for a small computer 
and a communications processor for a large system) 
that enables the computer to interact with other 
computers on a network or across the Internet.
Through the implementation of vendor pro­
duced applications software or the deployment of in-
house developed customized applications software, 
management information systems can support a broad 
array of business operations. Vendor produced appli­
cations software such as enterprise resource planning 
(ERP) software can support large enterprise-wide op­
erational needs. In contrast, vendor produced applica­
tions software like Microsoft Office is designed to sup­
port the needs of individual users at their workstation. 
Other applications software packages such as supply 
chain management systems enable computer users 
to communicate and conduct business with suppliers 
and customers. Custom built software is often created 
to perform functions that vendor produced software 
cannot adequately support. Business operations that 
management information systems support include:

 Accounting And Financial Management

 Human Resources Management And Payroll

 Customer Relations Management

 Decision Support

 Business Intelligence

 Knowledge Management

 Inventory Management

 E-Commerce And Internet Sales

 Internet Based Customer Support

 Facilities Management

 Manufacturing Operations
In addition to hardware and software components, 
specialized information technology (IT) staff is needed 
to select, implement, manage, and maintain all of the 
elements of management information systems. The 
type of IT staff and the number of IT staff required to as­
sure management information systems adequately sup­
port business operations varies by the size and type of 
organization. The specialized skills of IT staff include:

 Systems Analysis

 Systems Design

 Applications Programming

 Data Center Operations

 Network Design And Management

 Information Security

 Help Desk (End User Support)

 Documentation And Quality Control

 Computer System Maintenance
An organization’s management information system 
requires all of the following elements: Computer 
systems, communications hardware, applications

software, and qualified IT personnel to select, design, 
implement, and maintain all of the components in a 
manner that supports business strategies.
APPLICATIONS
Aligning Business Strategies & Management Infor­
mation Systems
The strategic alignment of IT refers to the degree to 
which the capabilities of the management informa­
tion systems are aligned with the priorities, goals, and 
objectives of the firm’s business strategy (Wonseok 
& Pinsonneault, 2007). Alignment is a complex pro­
cess that requires IT staff to have an in-depth un­
derstanding of company operations and a clear un­
derstanding of what type of technology is needed to 
support those activities. It also requires that company 
management clearly identify and articulate company 
strategies and related goals and objectives.
There are three types of business strategies that 
drive the implementation of management informa­
tion systems. The cost-reduction strategy focuses on 
reducing the acquisition costs of goods and materials, 
the costs of producing items, and reducing related 
operating costs. The quality-improvement strategy 
focuses on improving quality control, enabling an or­
ganization to offer products in higher-priced markets, 
or to inexpensively provide extended warranties as a 
product line feature or an add-on sales option. The rev­
enue-growth strategy focuses on areas such as product 
development, customer service, niche marketing, and 
competitive pricing. The three strategies and the ob­
jectives that management information systems help 
achieve are listed below (Miller & Toulouse, 1998).

Each of the three business strategies requires dif­
ferent types of activities which in turn require dif­
ferent types of computing abilities and different 
types of data. Thus, it is important that IT staff under­
stand the organization’s information needs in order 
to better support a wide variety of strategic activities. 
To complicate matters further, it is realistic to expect 
that an organization may simultaneously be pursuing 
more than one business strategy. Management infor­
mation systems that serve as cost-reduction strategies 
may not be suitable to support revenue-growth strate­
gies. In such a case, the mix of applications software 
will need to be expanded in order to support all the 
activities in the organization.
Communications between business operations 
managers and IT developers is essential to success­
fully implement appropriate management informa­
tion systems. Participation of key business managers 
in planning management information systems is es­
sential for the identification of appropriate IT appli­
cations (Booth & Philip, 2005). Without continued 
communication it is possible for the alignment be­
tween IT development efforts and business strategy 
to erode, resulting in an organization being without 
the management information systems it needs to re­
main competitive.
Applications Software for Cost-Reduction Strategies
Cost-reduction strategies generally attempt to re­
duce cost associated with procurement activities, 
inventory management, and production opera­
tions. To support cost-reduction strategies, one of 
the products offered by the information technology 
industry is Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
software systems. ERP systems are now several 

Management Information Systems
Principles of Business: Management
200
decades old and have matured considerably in their 
capability, as has the ability of industries to imple­
ment and utilize the systems. A study of 247 firms 
adopting ERP systems shows that firms adopting en­
terprise systems exhibit higher differential perfor­
mance only after two years of continued ERP system 
usage (Nicolaou, 2004).
ERP systems are comprised of a group of inte­
grated modules that help organizations manage pro­
curement, logistics, production planning and manu­
facturing. In general, the software companies that 
provide ERP systems also provide additional inte­
grated modules that can support business functions 
such as the needs of human resource management 
including basic human resource functions, talent 
management, scheduling, payroll, and workforce de­
ployment. To maximize the use of data, these mod­
ules can be integrated with financial management 
modules that provide support for accounts payable 
and receivable. There are very few software compa­
nies that offer ERP products and acquisition and im­
plementation can be costly and requires months or 
years to accomplish.
Applications Software for Quality-Improvement 
Strategies
The road to quality management is complex with 
many elements that need to be addressed. Quality-
improvement strategies generally attempt to ad­
dress issues in the quality of materials used in the 
manufacturing process, the processes utilized 
during production, and the steps in packaging, 
storage, and distribution of products that may im­
pact quality. As quality is controlled more tightly, a 
company may be able to produce products for high 
priced markets or offer extended warranties for 
their products.
Studies on quality management show that pur­
suit of ISO 9000 certification is becoming a must in 
order for many companies to better compete in the 
global marketplace. In addition, studies have found 
that quality is a strategic variable that should be 
taken into account and managed not only within the 
single firm, but also throughout the supply chain of 
which the firm is part (Romano, 2002). As a result of 
a demand for quality and an evolving procurement 
environment that requires companies to have ISO 
9000 certification, companies around the world have 
taken steps to gain the certification.
Quality management software enables produc­
tion managers and engineers to evaluate how well 
the processes they designed and implemented are 
achieving quality goals. Software to help manage 
the quality (through measuring and testing output) 
is used by many companies. In addition, integrated 
packages like SAP PLM allow users to begin quality 
planning during the product design phase. It also 
creates a foundation for quality inspection processes 
and in-process control during production. SAP 
PLM also meets the criteria for ISO 9000 and Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Selecting appro­
priate quality management software for a company 
requires input from product designers and engi­
neers, production specialists as well as the managers 
responsible for quality programs.
Applications Software for Revenue-Growth Strategies
Revenue-growth strategies can impact more orga­
nization functions than cost-reduction or quality-
improvement strategies. Growth strategies can be 
divided into three sub-categories:
1.	 Development, which includes new products and 
improvements to existing products
2.	 Service, which can include product customization 
for customers, packaging and delivery processes, 
or serving niche markets through supply chains
3.	 Marketing, which addresses analysis of existing 
and the creation of new data on customers or po­
tential customers, developing and testing pricing 
strategies, advertising, and image building and 
branding.
The product development aspects of revenue-growth 
strategies include the design of new products and the 
implementation of improvements to existing prod­
ucts. Software packages that support these efforts are 
usually acquired by the engineering or product devel­
opment departments and, for the most part, fall out 
of the realm of the central management information 
systems departments. The packages include three-di­
mensional graphics software used in the design pro­
cess and simulation software to run tests on product 
functioning and ability under various conditions.
The service aspects of revenue-growth strategies 
can be driven by several types of software packages, 
many of which are referred to as customer relations 
management (CRM) applications. CRM became a 

Principles of Business: Management
Management Information Systems
201
popular software application in the middle 1990s and 
there are dozens of CRM type packages offered by 
software manufacturers. CRM packages can be rather 
simple and provide support for retail sales or supply 
chain relationship management. CRM packages can 
be complex and have several modules, like ERP sys­
tems, and be capable of supporting a wide array of 
activities. These activities include market analysis, 
marketing plan development, sales analysis and man­
agement, service contract management, workforce 
management, and partner channel management. 
Many CRM packages have web interfaces to support 
remote access and provide a portal for customers to 
obtain or provide information.
Although competition in the CRM market is driving 
innovation, the myriad of products makes selecting an 
appropriate CRM package for a company a lengthy 
and complex process. Selecting a CRM package in­
cludes two very important steps. As Colombo and 
Francalanci explain, “First, one must calculate the 
quality-to-cost ratio and support opportunity. Second, 
one must set a maximum budget for implementation 
and limit pre-selection to packages satisfying budget 
constraints. Both objectives share a common attitude 
towards costs as an organizational control variable that 
complements, rather than determines, the ranking of 
packages. Larger companies inevitably involve greater 
software complexity and consequently incur higher 
costs. Conversely, smaller companies may not need 
the most expensive packages and, in this respect, cost 
limits constitute a legitimate orientation that precedes 
the ranking of alternatives” (2004, p. 188).
The marketing aspects of a revenue-growth strategy 
include the analysis of existing data and creation of 
new data on customers or potential customers, de­
veloping and testing pricing strategies, advertising, 
image building, and branding. Contemporary mar­
keting efforts are most often data driven and there 
are two types of applications software that currently 
support analysis for marketing efforts: Business data 
mining and statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis software packages have been in 
use for decades, but data mining as a business and 
market analysis practice and the data mining soft­
ware products to support those efforts, are relatively 
new to the field of management information systems. 
According to Smyth (2005), “By the late 1980s and 
early 1990s, relational database technology had suc­
cessfully established itself in the commercial sector, 
i.e. many businesses and organizations were now 
using these relational models and tools to manage 
their data. Worth noting is the fact that these rela­
tional database systems were never explicitly de­
signed to support data analysis tasks. Instead they 
are primarily designed for the purposes of storage, 
query, and transaction management, i.e. supporting 
day-to-day operations of organizations that handle 
large volumes of data (e.g., airlines, banks hospitals, 
retail organizations, etc.)” (p. 5).
Interest in data warehousing began to grow in the 
early 1990s, namely maintaining a historical reposi­
tory of all transactions ever recorded.
“Database researchers quickly realized that com­
panies not only wanted to store, manage, and access 
their data in a systematic fashion, but they also wished 
to be able to analyze it. This analysis could not take 
place in the traditional statistical fashion since these 
data sets were typically far too large to be handled by 
conventional statistical software packages. Thus was 
born the concept of data analysis algorithms which 
are designed to operate directly on relational data­
bases, and form the main components of modern 
database-oriented research in data mining” (Smyth, 
2000, p.5).
There are dozens of data mining software tools on 
the market. They are designed to help achieve sev­
eral types of business goals ranging from customer 
acquisition, cross- and up-selling, churn prediction, 
fraud detection, market-basket analysis, and fore­
casting (Giraud-Carrier & Povel, 2003). As with CRM 
and ERP software, selecting the appropriate data 
mining tool for a company can be a lengthy and com­
plex project. The relationship between functionality 
provided and the cost of data mining tools is also sim­
ilar to that of CRM and ERP packages; the more you 
spend the more you get.
APPLICATIONS
The Internet as a Component of Management 
Information Systems
The Internet has added a new element to manage­
ment information systems. In about a ten year pe­
riod from 1995 to 2004, the commercial use of the 
internet transformed from a researcher’s tool to a 
common business necessity. A large portion of the 
boom in business investment in information tech­
nology was driven by new business applications and 

Management Information Systems

infrastructure using Internet related technology 
(Formanz, Goldfarb, & Greenstein, 2004).
One new application is Internet based Business-to-
business (B2B) systems, which can be implemented 
to support cost-reduction strategies by bringing new 
efficiencies to operations management. These in­
clude supply chain systems, online ordering for busi­
ness products, just-in-time inventory methods, and 
collaborative design processes.
A complimentary application is Internet business-
to-consumer (B2C) systems, which can be imple­
mented to support revenue-growth strategies by pro­
viding new sales, marketing, and customer service 
opportunities. These include advertising, promotion 
of brand identification, order processing, dissemina­
tion of technical and product information, and email 
marketing efforts.
Both B2B and B2C applications provide opportu­
nities for companies to expand their markets to new 
countries and new target populations. With these 
opportunities also come many challenges including 
language barriers, varied business customs and social 
perceptions, as well as different local laws and gov­
ernment regulations. These issues challenged both 
IT professionals and corporate staff responsible for 
marketing, sales, product delivery, and customer sup­
port. Many companies found it necessary to develop 
Internet applications in multiple languages as well as 
hire developers and marketers that were familiar with 
local customs and laws. They also faced a myriad of 
state and national privacy laws around the world.
“The Internet has contributed to the awareness 
of privacy issues in four ways. First, the Internet has 
resulted in a huge increase in the number of people 
using computers to seek information and make pur­
chases. Second, several privacy-related incidents have 
resulted in considerably less than favorable press cov­
erage for enterprises that have suffered from privacy 
management problems. Third, many organizations 
had their first experiences in dealing with large-scale 
privacy issues. Fourth, the global cross-border nature 
of the Internet presented totally new challenges to 
governments and enterprises. The combination of 
these trends set the stage for many potential privacy 
conflicts” (Erbschloe & Vacca, 2001, p.xv). It also re­
sulted in the creation of a new position in many orga­
nizations — the Chief Privacy Officer.
The deployment of Internet applications also 
presented new security challenges beyond privacy 
management. An information security program now 
requires the identification of an organization’s elec­
tronic informational assets, as well as planning steps 
that must be carried out to ensure its continued avail­
ability, confidentiality and integrity. Any computer 
that has direct or indirect access to the outside world 
is potentially at risk, and can further risk all assets 
connected to the network (Hinojosa, 2005).
Issue
IT Staffing Challenges
Human capital is imperative in the knowledge-intensive 
IT profession. Chief Information Officers (CIOs) must 
reward valuable IT skills for important projects while 
constantly predicting additional requirements over the 
next three to five years. Even in organizations that are 
scaling down in size, top executives must possess the 
skills that will enable them to respond efficiently to fu­
ture technological challenges (Schwarzkopf, Mejias, 
Jasperson, Saunders, & Gruenwald, 2004).
Managers face several problems in staffing IT depart­
ments. Many organizations have on-call requirements 
for IT staff and in many cases there is not additional 
compensation for on-call time. In other cases, work 
hours for IT employees can be long, especially during 
critical points during development cycles, the launch 
of new systems, or the migration from old systems.
IT workers also face a relatively constant need to 
renew their skill sets. This can occur several times 
during their career. When systems that an IT worker 
has supported for several years become obsolete, they 
must learn new systems and often new programming 
languages. As new technology emerges in the market­
place, IT workers also face the challenge of rapidly 
learning about the new technology as it is brought 
into their organization. New skill development is 
often done independently and with limited support 
from employers.
Several steps can be taken to help maintain a stable 
IT workforce. Striving to develop a professional work­
place that meets the needs of the organization and IT 
employees is an important step in retaining IT em­
ployees. It is also important that the hiring process 
identifies employees that are a right fit for the orga­
nization, the IT department, and the teams on which 
they will be working. The issue of continued skill 
development and training must also be addressed in 
personnel policies, management practice, and in the 
IT budget (Erbschloe, 2003).

CONCLUSION
Management information systems are comprised of a 
combination of computer systems, communications 
systems, and applications software that are designed 
and maintained by professional IT staff. They sup­
port organization functions such as financial man­
agement, manufacturing and production, human 
resource management, and office administration. 
Management information systems also support com­
munications (i.e. email) between employees within 
the organization as well as workers in supplier or 
customer organizations. A company’s selection of sys­
tems and applications software is determined by its 
business strategy and business needs.

Management of an Insurance Enterprise
ABSTRACT
The insurance industry is essential to the world economy 
and many companies offer coverage for a wide range 
of risks that people and businesses face everyday. From 
a consumer’s perspective, the transaction may be as 
simple as paying a premium every month in exchange 
for the piece of mind of knowing that recovery from a 
loss is possible. Within a complex framework of govern­
ment regulation, an insurance company must evaluate 
risks and assign probabilities to determine a price for 
the protection sought. They need to invest funds and 
even seek to insure their own risks with other insurers. 
The marketplace demands efficiency and insurance 
companies are turning to technology to address the 
need. This article discusses the basic components on an 
insurer’s business model and the fundamental forces 
that affect the management of an insurance enterprise.
OVERVIEW
Risk in some form is present in every act. Whether 
the risk is remote or closer to assured, disasters both 
natural and otherwise have the potential to destroy 
fortunes. The prospect of catastrophic loss can halt 
progress. Insurance companies address these con­
cerns by spreading the economic impact of a loss 
over a large group of people. The products they 
provide are essential to the normal operation of our 
non-agrarian society. The insurance industry in the 
United States is composed of some four thousand 
companies that sell policies to protect against a wide 
variety of the risks faced by individuals, organizations 
and entities alike. The industry is also important 
to the economy as an employer of over two million 
people. This article discusses some of the major func­
tions, challenges and techniques unique to the man­
agement of an insurance company.
Businesses have many basic functions and prin­
ciples in common. Every business must produce 
something of value to the market, employ techniques 
to sell that product, and manage human resources 
with the appropriate knowledge, skills and abilities 
to complete the tasks. Each industry has a particular 
group of core efficiencies necessary for production 
and distribution to profit from its chosen product 
line. For example, General Motors, on a funda­
mental level, must be able to efficiently produce cars

at a cost below the price a consumer is willing to pay 
for those cars. While there are certainly many other 
factors that determine the success of a company, it 
would be difficult to imagine a successful company 
that lacked expertise and efficiency in those areas 
fundamental to its nature. For an insurance com­
pany, the basic model to generate revenue involves 
two areas; underwriting and investing. The cost of 
administration and the total amount of claims paid 
are subtracted from the revenue centers to form the 
basic insurer business model. To employ this basic 
model, the insurance industry must operate within a 
legal framework of state and federal laws and regula­
tion (Encyclopedia of Business & Finance, 2008).
An insurance company can make money in two 
basic ways.

 First, the insurance company can profit from un­
derwriting. When an insurance company under­
writes a risk they assume responsibility for an agreed 
amount of economic consequences arising from 
the occurrence of certain events. The premiums 
earned are applied toward potential profit once 
they become earned premiums. The amount of 
premium that is considered earned is a function of 
the time the insurance company has been exposed 
to loss under a given policy. For example, if a person 
purchases a one-year policy and 100 days have 
elapsed since the policy took effect, the insurance 
company has earned 100/365 of the total premium 
paid. Conversely, 265/365 of the premium paid is 
unearned. An insurance company makes an under­
writing profit when the total of earned premiums 
exceeds the total claims under those policies.

 Second, there insurance company makes money 
by investing the premiums they receive. Insur­
ance companies invest insurance premium pay­
ments as soon as they are received and leave those 
funds invested until claims are paid. The total 
amount of cash that an insurance company has on 
hand and not paid out in claims is called “float,” 
or available reserve. While the company may not 
be able the keep the investments themselves, they 
are able to keep the interest that accrued on the 
funds while in the company’s possession. For this 
reason, insurance companies are important inves­
tors in the economy, putting billions of dollars in 
credit and equity markets. The profits made from 
investing the “float” are an important source of 
income for insurance companies and can offset 
underwriting losses.
The other end of the business equation for an in­
surance company is largely composed of the under­
writing administrative expense and losses incurred. 
The full equation in total profit earned by an insur­
ance company is the underwriting profit plus the in­
vestment income less the losses incurred, or claims 
paid, and the underwriting expenses. Insurance 
company mangers have to apply this business model 
within a highly regulated industry, at both state and 
federal levels. Each of these areas will be discussed in 
more detail.
Underwriting
Underwriting is at the heart of the insurance busi­
ness and it is likely the most difficult part of the busi­
ness. An insurance policy distributes the economic 
losses arising from a specific type of risk to a group 
of people. The term derives from the times when the 
person assuming the risk actually signed their name 
on the contract under the risk assumed. In modern 
usage, it refers to a party who has assumed risk under 
an insurance policy. The term is also commonly used 
in investment banking and in that context; the un­
derwriter assumes the risk of the sale of particular 
securities.
Underwriting is the assumption of a risk; the deci­
sion as to assume a particular risk involves a process 
of quantifying risks and then assigning a price for 
the assumption. That quantification is a prediction 
about the claims that will be made under a policy and 
pricing of the policies accordingly. To perform this 
prediction, insurers use actuarial science. Actuarial 
science is a formal mathematical discipline used to 
calculate the likelihood and frequency of occurrence 
of covered risks and therefore the funds required to 
provide the anticipated insurance benefits. For those 
interested in mathematics and statistics, many univer­
sities offer both undergraduate and graduate degree 
programs in the area.
The discipline uses a number of related fields, in­
cluding probability, statistics, finance and economics. 
An actuary analyzes a variety of data to determine the 
range and probability of the range of risks associated 
with a covered event and to calculate an insurer’s 
overall exposure under a given policy. For example, 
mortality rates are important to compute risks and

premiums for a life insurance policy. When an in­
surance company terminates a particular insurance 
policy the amount of total premiums collected (the 
earned premium less the administrative expense and 
total claims paid) equal the underwriting profit for 
that policy. Insurance companies make money on 
some policies and lose on others.
After the insurance company assumed risks and 
paid claims, the measure used to compute and re­
port its profit or loss is called the combined ratio. 
This ratio is a relationship between income from 
premiums, claims paid, administrative expenses and 
dividends distributed. A ratio under 1.00 indicates a 
profit and a ratio over 1.00 indicates a loss. For ex­
ample, a combined ratio of .97 means the insurance 
company made a 3% underwriting profit and a ratio 
of 1.15 indicates a loss of 15%. The percentages refer 
to a percentage of each dollar received in premiums; 
in the above example, a loss of three cents and gain 
of fifteen cents for each dollar of premium paid. This 
ratio is reported on company financial statements 
and to government regulatory agencies.
Underwriting profits vary according to internal 
company actuarial predictions and actual events. For 
example, natural disasters, as in the case of a hurri­
cane or earthquake can cause significant claims of 
which insurance companies are bound to pay. Other 
times, underwriting may be profitable. Between 1998 
and 2003, property and casualty insurers lost over 140 
billion; while in the first quarter of 2005, the same 
sector reported record underwriting profits of over 
$7 billion on a combined ratio of approximately .92 
(“P/C underwriting,” 2005).
Investing
The investing income is very important to the overall 
profitability of an insurance company. In the United 
States for five years ending in 2003, property and 
casualty insurance companies had an underwriting 
loss of approximately $140 billion. However, for that 
same period, insurance companies reported profits 
of over $68 billion. These profits were made on in­
vesting the float and are dependent upon the condi­
tion of the financial markets. Profits derived from the 
float may be difficult to maintain during times of eco­
nomic depression; poor economic conditions gener­
ally translate to high insurance premiums. The gen­
eral tendency for insurance profits to fluctuate over 
time is commonly referred to as the underwriting or 
insurance cycle. For property and casualty insurers, 
property losses due to natural disasters cause vola­
tility in the cycle. On the other hand, automobile 
lines tend to be more profitable due to reliable sta­
tistics that are greatly aided by advances in computer 
technology.
Underwriting Expenses & Claims Handling
From the perspective of the customer, claims han­
dling is the critical function of an insurance company. 
When a customer suffers a loss, they want to be com­
pensated with all possible speed. From the perspective 
of the insurance company, mangers must balance the 
customer’s expectations of rapid resolution and sat­
isfaction with administrative expenses, overpayment 
leakages and fraudulent insurance practices. To satisfy 
the needs of speed and reliability, insurance compa­
nies turn to technology deployed both in the field and 
over the internet. A range of portable communication 
technology can be deployed in the field so that ad­
justers may assess and process claims more rapidly and 
efficiently than ever before. An adjuster armed with 
a laptop computer, portable printer, and scanner can 
evaluate a claim and enter information directly into 
the insurance company’s system without the need for 
duplicate work, as is the case with paper forms. Once 
the adjuster has completed the evaluation, they can 
then print the estimate and issue a check on-site.
The internet also offers the insurance company an 
opportunity for increased efficiency; both in terms of 
data entry and accuracy. Once information is entered 
on a website and added to an insurance company’s 
database, it is unlikely that information need ever be 
reentered. The internet also allows a greater degree 
of control over the type and amount of data entered. 
A website can be programmed to insist on certain in­
formation of a particular form and react to informa­
tion by leading the consumer to additional informa­
tion that may be required or beneficial; paper lacks 
these dynamic qualities.
Insurance companies may then pass on the sav­
ings from increased efficiency to the consumer in the 
form of lower premiums and increased customer ser­
vice, which help business. Management techniques 
and systems of this kind are employed by individual 
companies for their own benefit. However, that does 
not mean that insurance companies are alone; insur­
ance companies share risk through a practice called 
reinsurance.

Principles of Business: Management

Reinsurance
The fundamental purpose and defining feature of in­
surance is the distribution of risks over a large base. 
For example, the costs of a car accident suffered by 
one insured are spread to all insured paying pre­
miums under the policy. The same principle applies 
to insurance companies who spread risks to other 
companies with the use of reinsurance. Reinsurance 
is when one insurance company assumes all or part 
of a risk already undertaken by another insurance 
company. The portion of the risk that exceeds the 
primary insurance company’s coverage is said to have 
been layed-off, or ceded, to the reinsurer. Reinsurers 
may also reinsure a part of the risk assumed from the 
primary insurer. This practice is called retroceding.
Reinsurance is an important tool for managers 
because it allows for increased capacity, stability and 
financial strength. With reinsurance, an insurance 
company may assume large risks that it would oth­
erwise not be able. Reinsurance increases stability 
because it allows a company to make accurate pre­
dictions as to potential future liability. Reinsurance is 
also important to consumers seeking significant cov­
erage because it allows them to deal with one com­
pany as opposed to shopping around. Reinsurance 
unifies the insurance industry around the globe 
and losses incurred in one can be felt in many other 
places. For example, Western Europe is an important 
source of worldwide reinsurance and the Caribbean 
is an important foreign source for the United States.
Regulation & Control
The insurance industry is governed by a blend of 
statutes, administrative agency regulations, and court 
decisions at both the state and federal levels. State 
laws typically seek to protect insureds by controlling 
premium rates, preventing unfair insurer practices, 
and guarding against the financial insolvency of in­
surers. Federal law permits states to exercise regula­
tory control over insurance; provided state laws and 
regulations do not conflict with federal antitrust laws 
on rate fixing, rate discrimination, and monopolies.
Most states have created agencies to administer 
state statutes and promulgate rules to address proce­
dural details that are missing from the statutory frame­
work. As an initial matter, to do business within a state, 
an insurer must register and obtain a license from that 
state. The registration process is usually managed by 
the same state administrative agency charged with the 
responsibility of enforcing the statute and developing 
rules and regulations. To carry out their enforcement 
responsibilities, administrative agencies develop a 
range of rules and regulations. For example, states 
may require reporting related to company financial 
stability, define acceptable types of policies, and re­
view the competence and ethical standards of insur­
ance company employees. All the regulations are 
designed and implemented to fulfill the goals of the 
consumer protection goals outlined in state statutes.
Legislatures pass laws that are often enforced 
and developed by agencies in the executive branch. 
Consistent with the doctrine of separation of powers 
built into our system of government, the judicial 
branch has the authority to review and interpret the 
activities and enactments of both legislatures and 
agencies. In this way, the courts have an important 
role in determining what the law means and how it ap­
plies to everyday life. Statutes and regulations attempt 
to control behavior in relatively broad areas and the 
application of those rules can be ambiguous, disputed 
or unfair when applied to a specific set of facts. In 
such a case, the parties often turn to the courts for 
resolution. When a court decides a dispute between 
an insurance company, insured, or third party, it must 
interprets statutes and regulations as applied to each 
case. Each of those interpretations becomes a prec­
edent that will apply to future cases with similar facts. 
The sum of all court decisions is called case law. Case 
law is always changing in response to factual variations 
and insurance companies must be vigilant to ensure 
that their practices and policies are in accord with the 
current law in the states in which they operate.
Case law joins with statues and administrative reg­
ulations to form a comprehensive and complex set of 
controls on the insurance industry. Insurance com­
panies in violation of the law may be fined or may 
have their license to do business suspended or re­
voked. Court’s may impose significant costs and fees 
on insurance companies found to have unreasonably 
denied coverage or failed to defend their insured.

Management of Financial Institutions
ABSTRACT
This article focuses on the management of finan­
cial institutions. It provides an overview of the main 
management strategies used in financial institu­
tions, including activity-based costing, asset-liability 
management, profitability analysis, risk manage­
ment, technology and information management, 
crisis management, and issues management. The 
management issues associated with federal and state 
regulation of financial institutions are addressed.
OVERVIEW
Financial institutions, which move money throughout 
society in both complex and simple financial trans­
actions, include banks, credit unions, thrifts, sav­
ings associations, trust companies, offices of foreign

banks, and issuers of travelers checks and money 
orders. The success and strength of financial institu­
tions depends in large part on their effective man­
agement. Management refers to the work or act of 
directing and controlling a group of people within 
an organization for the purpose of accomplishing 
shared goals or objectives. Classic management, as 
defined by Henri Fayol and Frederick Taylor, consists 
of five main functions, roles, or actions: Planning, 
organizing, leading, coordinating, and controlling. 
Management theory, practice, and scholarship are 
characterized by a focus on issues of leadership, 
group dynamics, and employee motivation.
Managers in financial institutions must respond 
to new technologies, new organizational models, 
the economic forces of globalization, and increased 
diversity in the workforce. Modern financial institu­
tions, responding to new technology, increased com­
petition, and changes in trade regulations around 
the world, are transitioning from hierarchical and 
centralized forms to group-model and decentral­
ized organizations. In response to the new forms of 
business organizations, such as large-scale financial 
institutions, high-tech companies and multinational 
corporations, management has evolved its skill set to 
include greater facility for managing change, infor­
mation, and human differences.
Financial institutions face unique management 
concerns and challenges due to the degree of govern­
ment regulation within the financial industry. The 
management of financial institutions is a complex 
process involving management sectors of accounting, 
investment, human resources, and risk assessment. 
Common management practices used in financial 
institutions include account-balance costing, asset-
liability management, profitability analysis, informa­
tion management, crisis management, issues man­
agement, technology and information management, 
and risk management. The management of financial 
institutions has changed significantly since the 1970s. 
Changes in the following areas have affected manage­
ment practices in financial institutions: Regulation 
and deregulation, product diversification, and in­
dustry convergence (Kafafian, 2001).

 Regulation and deregulation: The financial in­
dustry has undergone significant periods of regu­
lation and deregulation since the 1970s when in­
terest rate limits and geographic quota restrictions 
were ended. The government regulatory agencies 
vie for control over regulatory issues such as con­
sumer privacy, merchant banking, community re­
investment, and consumer disclosure.

 Product diversification: The diversification of fi­
nancial products, particularly traditional banking 
products, began in the 1970s as a result of regula­
tory changes. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial 
Modernization Act, passed in 1999, increased the 
financial products and services available to con­
sumers in the areas of brokerage, trust, money 
management, insurance, credit cards, and secu­
ritization. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial 
Modernization Act replaced earlier laws that had 
prohibited financial institutions from engaging in 
insurance and investment activities. The Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act resulted 
in the creation of numerous commercial and full 
service banking and financial service institutions. 
Financial institutions are currently working to 
adapt the products and services they offer to the 
needs of their customers. Internet banking has 
expanded the products and services that financial 
institutions offer and consumers expect.

 Industry convergence: Financial institutions, such 
as banks, brokerage firms, money managers, in­
surance companies, insurance agencies, and data 
processing vendors, are consolidating their busi­
ness domains. For example, there are fewer banks 
in operation than there were in the 1970s. The 
financial industry is in flux as once discrete busi­
nesses attempt to combine operations, product 
offerings, markets, customers, and internal em­
ployee cultures.
In the United States, and developed nations in 
general, financial institutions facilitate economic 
growth through lending, savings, and commerce. 
The early history of formal financial institutions in 
the United States established the pattern of connec­
tion between the health of financial institutions and 
the economy at large. In the 18th century, banks, life 
insurance companies, and trading companies were 
established in the United States. These financial in­
stitutions facilitated large-scale economic growth in 
the United States manufacturing industry, infrastruc­
ture, home ownership, business development, inter­
national trade, and market formation. Due to the 
importance of financial institutions for the economic 

Management of Financial Institutions

and social health of the nation as a whole, the govern­
ment actively regulates financial institutions. Clearly, 
the management practices of financial institutions, as 
well as the products and services offered by financial 
services, are scrupulously monitored and regulated 
by the government. The successful management of 
financial institutions has a significant impact and in­
fluence on the nation.
The following section provides an overview of the 
main management strategies used in financial insti­
tutions including activity-based costing, asset-liability 
management, profitability analysis, risk management, 
technology and information management, crisis 
management, and issues management. This section 
will serve as the foundation for later discussion of the 
ways in which management of federal institutions is 
influenced by state and federal regulations.
APPLICATIONS
Management Strategies in Financial Institutions
Management of financial institutions is a multifaceted 
endeavor involving the oversight and direction of 
human resources, accounting, investment, resource-
allocation, production, research and design, and fi­
nance areas. Common management practices used 
in financial institutions include activity-based costing, 
asset-liability management, profitability analysis, risk 
management, technology and information manage­
ment, crisis management, and issues management.
Activity-Based Costing
Activity-based costing is an accounting or finance-
based management tool used in management ac­
counting. Managers use activity based accounting to 
identify, describe, assign costs to, and report on op­
erations. Activity-based costing is used in three main 
ways: a tool to aid strategic decision-making; a lens 
into the decision-making process; and a resource 
allocation mechanism. Activity-based costing facili­
tates strategic decision-making and cost reduction. 
It allows management to make decisions from an in­
formed and objective basis (Rafiq & Garg, 2002).
Asset-Liability Management
Asset-liability management refers to a risk manage­
ment practice used to make investment or disinvest­
ment decisions and maintain the credit service ratio. 
The asset-liability management process generates 
graphical analysis, data analysis, and interest rate sim­
ulation for use in the budget making process. Asset 
liability management includes the important area of 
gap analysis. Gap analysis, a tool for comparing actual 
and potential performance, helps managers answer 
the following questions: Where are the fundamental 
mismatches of cash flows and maturities on the bal­
ance sheet? Does the institution have a positive or 
negative gap between actual and potential perfor­
mance? What is the effect of interest rate changes on 
the profitability, viability, and safety and soundness of 
the corporation? Federal regulators require financial 
institutions to create and distribute a formal asset-
liability management report for investors.
Profitability Analysis
Profitability analysis, often part of a larger project of 
cost-volume profitability analysis, is an analytical tool 
which compares the inner workings and profitability 
of a financial institution. Profitability analysis, which 
has applicability and uses in all areas of a financial in­
stitution, examines fund transfer pricing, capital as­
signment, and costing techniques to predict annual 
profitability by lines of business, organizational units, 
products, and customers. Federal regulators, lead by 
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, require 
financial institutions to create and distribute a formal 
profitability analysis report for investors which ana­
lyzes profit by categories such as business, geogra­
phies, product lines, and customers.
Risk Management
Risk management, which refers to the process of 
evaluating, classifying, and reducing risks to a level 
acceptable by stakeholders, is an established prac­
tice in financial institutions. Federal regulators 
require that financial institutions prepare and dis­
tribute comprehensive risk management reports to 
investors. Federal regulators have created risk cat­
egory checklists which financial institutions can use 
to create risk management plans. For example, the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in­
cludes the following risk categories in their checklist: 
Credit, liquidity, interest rate, price, reputation, stra­
tegic, transaction, foreign exchange, and compliance 
risk. The Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) includes the 
following risk categories in their checklist: Credit, 
market, liquidity, reputation, legal, and operational 
risk (Kafafian, 2001).

Technology & Information Management
Technology and information management has 
changed significantly since the 1970s. The main areas 
of change include: Core technology of accounting and 
application systems; internal systems such as fax ma­
chines, e-mail, Internet access, local networks, remote 
accessibility, and technology training; external tech­
nologies including banking systems, ATMs, telephone 
banking, call centers, and Internet banking; and 
management information systems such as budgeting 
and planning; and data mining and mapping; and 
product, service and demographic analysis (Kafafian, 
2001). Managers in financial institutions are respon­
sible for information and knowledge management. 
Managers in modern organizations are increasingly 
applying information technologies (IT) to the prob­
lems and challenges of knowledge management 
(KM). Information technology helps organizations 
create knowledge management systems (KMS) that 
structure information storage, use, and distribution 
within an organization. Organizational knowledge 
management systems include elements such as data 
mining, learning tools, intranets, email, telecommu­
nication and video-conferencing technologies, knowl­
edge directories, decision support tools, expert sys­
tems, workflow systems, social network analysis tools, 
and knowledge codification tools. Knowledge man­
agement systems create searchable document reposi­
tories to support the digital storage, retrieval, and dis­
tribution of an organization’s explicitly documented 
knowledge and information (Butler & Murphy, 2007).
Crisis Management
Financial institutions are vulnerable to organiza­
tional crisis, such as extortion, hostile takeover, 
product tampering, copyright infringement, security 
breach, bribery, information sabotage, sexual harass­
ment, plant explosion, counterfeiting, and boycott. 
Organizational crisis refer to a low-probability, high-
impact event that threatens the viability of the orga­
nization and is characterized by ambiguity of cause, 
effect, and means of resolution, as well as by a belief 
that decisions must be made swiftly. Organizational 
crisis management refers to a systematic attempt by 
organizational members with external stakeholders 
to avert crises or effectively manage those that do 
occur. An organization’s crisis management frame­
work or model for analyzing often includes the 4C 
frame of causes, consequences, caution, and coping.

 Causes refer to the immediate failures that trig­
gered the crisis.

 Consequences refer to the immediate and long-
term impacts.

 Caution refers to the measures taken to prevent or 
minimize the impact of a potential crisis.

 Coping refers to the measures taken to respond to 
a crisis that has already occurred.
Organizational crisis management effectiveness 
is demonstrated when potential crises are averted or 
when the major stakeholders of an organization be­
lieve that the success outcomes of short-term impacts 
outweigh the failure outcomes. Crisis management 
outcomes are often evaluated on a success-failure 
continuum based on the idea that all organiza­
tional crisis results in degrees of success and failure 
(Pearson & Clair, 1998).
Issues Management
Managers in financial institutions often face ethical 
issues that arise in the workings of their institution. 
Issues managers are responsible for integrating busi­
ness decisions and ethical decisions. Strategies for 
handling ethical dilemmas in organizations involves 
the identification of issues, research, analysis, and 
the creation of responsive organization-wide policies. 
Issues management provides a framework for analysis 
of ethical dilemmas and situations that arise in the 
workplace. One of the main challenges of ethical 
issues management involves practical implementa­
tion of strategies and policies. Issues managers must 
match the degree of ethics formality to the style of 
organization. Issues managers may strengthen their 
ethical issues-management process by adopting a 
formal code of ethics for the organization and con­
ducting issues-management meetings. Ethics state­
ments articulate the values with which employees 
should make work-related decisions. In addition to 
an ethics code, issues managers may work with em­
ployees to evaluate work-related decision prior to 
making definitive and final decisions. This decision-
making model is a less formal approach to ethical 
decision-making than an ethics code (Bowen, 2005).
Issues
Regulation of Financial Institution Management
The regulation of management practices in financial 
institutions occurs at the state and federal levels. State

governments regulate financial institutions, and their 
management, as a means of ensuring a stable and 
growing economy. For example, in 2006, the Tennessee 
Department of Financial Institutions, which is a repre­
sentative example of the state financial institutions of­
fice, was responsible for regulating 160 state-chartered 
banks, eight trust companies, three business and in­
dustrial development corporations, 118 credit unions, 
849 industrial loan and thrift offices, 75 insurance 
premium finance companies, 1,591 mortgage compa­
nies, 573 check cashers, 1,484 deferred presentment 
services companies, 703 title pledge lenders and 57 
money transmitters, and thousands of mortgage loan 
originators. The Tennessee Department of Financial 
Institutions oversees the state banking system, pro­
cesses all financial institution related consumer com­
plaints, offers education and outreach programs and 
generates state-level bank-related legislation.
There are six federal regulatory agencies that 
oversee the management of financial institutions: the 
Federal Reserve Board (FRB), the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit 
Union Administration (NCUA), the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office 
of Thrift Supervision (OTS). The Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau (CFPB) was opened in 2010 in re­
sponse to the 2008 financial crisis that resulted from 
reckless practices by lending and investing institutions.

 The Federal Reserve Board: The Federal Reserve 
Board is the central bank of the United States cre­
ated, by Congress in 1913, to strengthen the na­
tion’s monetary and financial system. The Fed­
eral Reserve regulates state member banks, bank 
holding companies, subsidiaries of bank holding 
companies, edge and agreement corporations, 
branches and agencies of foreign banking organi­
zations operating in the United States and their 
parent banks, and institution-affiliated parties. 
The Federal Reserve Board has four self-described 
responsibilities: Conduct the nation’s monetary 
policy by influencing money and credit conditions 
in the economy in pursuit of full employment and 
stable prices; supervise and regulate banking in­
stitutions to ensure the safety and soundness of 
the nation’s banking and financial system and to 
protect the credit rights of consumers; maintain 
the stability of the financial system and containing 
systemic risk that may arise in financial markets; 
and provide financial services to the U.S. govern­
ment, to the public, to financial institutions, and 
to foreign official institutions.

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: The 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, created in 
1933 in response to national financial instability of 
the 1920s and 1930s, regulates state non-member 
banks and insured branches of foreign banks. The 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures 
deposits in banks and thrift institutions for at least 
$100,000; identifies, monitors, and addresses risks to 
the deposit insurance funds; and limits the effect on 
the economy and the financial system when a bank 
or thrift institution fails. The Federal Deposit Insur­
ance Corporation, which has an insurance fund of 
approximately $49 billion, insures more than $3 tril­
lion of deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts. The Fed­
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation is the primary 
federal regulator of banks that are chartered by the 
states that do not join the Federal Reserve System.

 The National Credit Union Administration: The 
National Credit Union Administration regulates 
and supervises credit unions. Credit unions are 
non-profit financial institutions that are owned 
and operated entirely by its members and provide 
financial services for their members including sav­
ings and lending. The Federal Credit Union Act, 
passed in 1934, established the National Credit 
Union Administration and federally chartered 
credit unions in all states. The not-for-profit credit 
unions were originally established to promote sav­
ings and limit the potential for profit from profit-
motivated lending arrangements.

 The Office of Thrift Supervision: The Office of 
Thrift Supervision is the federal agency respon­
sible for chartering and supervising the thrift in­
dustry. Thrift associations refer to savings and loan 
associations, credit unions, or savings banks. The 
Office of Supervisory Operations, and The Office 
of Thrift Supervision as a whole, analyzes the fi­
nancial marketplace to see how federal regulation 
affects the thrift industry. The Office of Thrift Su­
pervision advises Congress on regulatory policies.

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency: 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 
established in 1863, charters, regulates, and super­
vises all national banks including national banks, 
federally chartered branches, and agencies of for­
eign banks. The Office of the Comptroller of the

Currency performs the following functions: Ex­
amines the banks; approves or denies applications 
for new charters, and branches; takes supervisory 
actions against banks that do not comply with laws 
and regulations; removes officers and directors, 
negotiates agreements to change banking prac­
tices, and issues cease and desist orders as well as 
civil money penalties; and issue rules and regula­
tions governing bank investments and lending. 
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is 
directed by the Comptroller, a presidentially-ap­
pointed position, for a five-year appointment.

 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(CFPB) Created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has 
broad authority. The CFPB issues regulations under 
a number of consumer protection laws and has su­
pervisory and enforcement authority over financial 
institutions with assets over $10 billion, including 
banks, savings associations, credit unions, consumer 
mortgage companies, payday lenders, and private 
college loan servicers (Mogilnicki & Malpass, 2013).
In addition to the regulatory efforts and powers of 
individual agencies, there are interagency commissions 
that oversee the management of financial institutions. 
The regulatory agencies come together in formal and in­
formal ways to coordinate their policies and approaches. 
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council 
(FFIEC) established in 1979, is an example of a formal 
collaboration. The Federal Financial Institutions 
Examination Council is a formal interagency body 
with the power to develop uniform principles, stan­
dards, and report forms for the federal examination of 
financial institutions by the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, 
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the 
Office of Thrift Supervision. In addition, the Federal 
Financial Institutions Examination Council is empow­
ered to make recommendations to promote uniformity 
in the supervision of financial institutions.
CONCLUSION
In the final analysis, management consists of five 
main functions, roles, or actions: Planning, orga­
nizing, leading, coordinating, and controlling.

 Planning refers to management forecasting, strat­
egizing, and deciding what needs to happen in the 
future.

 Organizing involves making efficient use of 
human and material resources.

 Leading refers to motivating, commanding and 
exhibiting skills to inspire and lead employees.

 Coordinating refers to unifying and harmonizing 
all organizational activity and effort.

 Controlling involves monitoring and checking 
employee performance for conformity and uni­
formity.
The management of financial institutions involves 
these five management functions as well as additional 
management functions specific to financial institu­
tions. The management of financial institutions differs 
from the management of other types of institutions in 
the degree of government oversight and regulation. 
Financial institutions operate under a high degree 
of risk due to the effect that their operations have on 
the health and strength of the economy in general. 
Managers of financial institutions use a variety of man­
agement approaches and practices, including activity-
based costing, asset-liability management, profitability 
analysis, risk management, technology and informa­
tion management, crisis management, and issues 
management, to promote stability and growth in their 
institutions and the economy at large.

Management of Human Resources
ABSTRACT
The management of human resources has under­
gone much transformation over the past decades, 
due to changes in markets, industry, technology, 
costs, workforce, and employer-employee relation­
ships. The management of human resources is no 
longer restricted to a single department: it is now a 
shared responsibility across organizations. In an era 
of heightened competition, firms are turning to in­
novative human resource practices for competitive 
advantage, and human resource policies and prac­
tice are increasingly integrated with business strategy, 
both domestically and internationally.
OVERVIEW
People are the most important asset of every organi­
zation. This is especially true in the twenty-first centu­
ry’s challenging business environment, where human 
resources are seen as an indispensable input for or­
ganizational effectiveness. Since there is a strong re­
lationship between the quality of human resources 
and the performance and success of an organization, 
organizations the world over are now striving for ef­
fective management of their human resource base.
The management of human resources has evolved 
in several phases over the twentieth and into the 
twenty-first century. As an occupation or a depart­
ment within an organization, this area first came to 
light between the first and second world wars, under 
the term “human relations.” Subsequently, as trade 
unions became increasingly powerful in the middle 
of the century, the term “industrial relations” be­
came popular. The terms “personnel administration” 
and “personnel management,” together with the less 
popular “employee relations” and “manpower man­
agement” emerged in the late 1960s and 1970s, due 
to the growing complexity of employment law, and 
ongoing concern about trade unions.
At the time, the management of people in orga­
nizations was seen to be the responsibility of the per­
sonnel function. As the personnel function grew in 
scope and importance, monopolizing the manage­
ment of people, those in managerial and supervisory 
positions were left with little to do when it came to 
such activities as the acquisition, development and 
compensation of human resources; the design of 
work systems; and labor relations. At the same time, 
because personnel specialists were increasingly con­
cerned with rules and regulations and were mainly 
seen as preoccupied with problem-solving, they were 
often left out of the strategic thinking of their firms.
The 1980s presented new challenges for business 
organizations. In an era of increasing competition, as 
the global playing field became far more competitive 
and volatile than ever before, firms had to strive to 
gain competitive advantage whenever and wherever 
possible. Business was also changing at a much faster 
rate and this was accompanied by high uncertainty.
As a result of rising costs and increasing competi­
tive pressures on profit margins, firms also realized the 
need to be more cost-effective. Trade union power de­
clined, and the “me” generation emerged, with its em­
phasis on individualism. There were also changes in 
organization structure, as firms decentralized respon­
sibility to business units built around products and 
markets to get closer to their customers. Organizations 
became flatter, leaner, and more flexible.
The technological revolution also posed great 
challenges for businesses, with innovations such as 
the introduction of information technology and 
computer-integrated manufacturing, which led to is­
sues that had to be managed ‘across’ the organization 
and which themselves called for a more integrated 
view of the organization. The accelerated pace of 
new product development also meant that people in 
different functions such as design, marketing, pro­
duction and finance had to work much more closely 
together than before. Rapid technological change 
also led to increased demands for new skills through 
sourcing, educating, and retraining.
In addition, workforce values were changing: the 
higher proportion of better-educated “knowledge 
workers” were increasingly likely to demand self-actu­
alization, causing greater attention to be paid to such 
issues as communications, participation and motiva­
tion. Firms in countries with aging populations faced 
the extra challenge of limited availability of labor, 
amid a shrinking workforce. Thus, a premium was 
placed on the recruitment and retention of high 
quality employees.

Management of Human Resources
Principles of Business: Management
216
In general, the firms that survived or came on the 
scene after these changes, have been more complex in 
terms of products, location(s), technologies, business 
functions, customers and markets. These changes led 
to a change in the image and role of the personnel 
function, leading to another change in name to 
“Human Resource Management.” At the same time, 
the management of human resources moved from 
a department function, to a shared responsibility 
among managers and non-managers, personnel or 
human resource directors, and line managers. In the 
highly competitive, internationalized business struc-
ture that emerged in the twenty-first century, human 
resource management became essential to gaining 
or retaining an edge on rivals (Anca-Ioana, 2013; 
Brauns, 2013).
APPLICATIONS
With the changes in image, role and name of the 
human resource management function, came a quest 
for a new kind of innovation, as firms recognized that 
the traditional sources and means of competitive ad-
vantage, such as capital, technology or location, had 
become less significant. Innovative human resource 
practices have now become one of the bases for com-
petitive advantage—no longer as a matter of trend, 
but rather of survival.
Categories of Human Resource Practice
Agarwala (2003) has identified fourteen categories 
of human resource practice, highlighting examples 
of innovative practices for each:
1. Employee Acquisition
Employee acquisition refers to internal and external 
selection and recruitment of employees to jobs. It 
includes the hiring of temporary work assistance 
and the use of external consultants (Grønhaug and 
Nordhaug, 1992). Pre-acquisition tasks include plan-
ning and forecasting, job analysis, job evaluation, job 
design and work system design. The latter relates to 
how tasks and responsibilities in the firm are distrib-
uted among job incumbents and the degree to which 
sharp borderlines exist between jobs (Grønhaug and 
Nordhaug, 1992).
Employee acquisition tasks are best performed in 
the context of an organization’s culture. All things 
being equal, selection should favor those candidates 
who appear to “fit in” with the prevailing organiza-
tional culture, be it a culture of empowerment, par-
ticipation, equal opportunity, and/or any one of the 
many other facets of culture.
Innovative employee acquisition strategies include 
(Agarwala, 2003):

 greater importance attached to the fit between 
person and company culture

 emphasis on “career,” not “job”

 selling company image to attract potential em-
ployees

 referral bonuses

 sign-on bonuses for new employees

 psychological testing

 developing industry-academia interface
2. Employee Retention Strategies
Employee retention refers to the measures put in 
place to keep employees in an organization, thus re-
ducing the labor turnover rate.
Innovative employee retention strategies include 
(Agarwala, 2003):

 evolving a pleasant work environment

 deferred compensation

 competitive salaries

 faster promotions

 greater work autonomy
3. Compensation and Incentives
Compensation includes the whole range of rewards 
and incentives that are applied in relation to em-
ployees. Intrinsic rewards are those that are internal 
to a person, such as job satisfaction and self-esteem; 
extrinsic rewards are more tangible, and range from 
wages to employee stock ownership plans (Grønhaug 
and Nordhaug, 1992). Compensation must be man-
aged, along with employee attitudes towards com-
pensation. Incentives are those offerings that have a 
tendency to motivate employees to will or to act as 
the organization desires.
Innovative compensation and incentive strategies 
include (Agarwala, 2003):

 increasing the component of variable pay

 stock options

 combining individual and team incentives

 performance-linked incentives

Principles of Business: Management

217

 customization of perks to individual needs

 offering a variety of allowances

 conducting compensation surveys
4. Benefits and Services
Similar to compensation and incentives, benefits and 
services may form part of an employee’s remunera-
tion package, and may include medical care, loans, 
travel, accommodation, catering, and so on. Many 
employers, for instance, offer Employee Assistance 
Programs, which are employee benefit programs 
typically offered in conjunction with a health in-
surance plan. Such Employee Assistance Programs 
aim to help employees handle personal problems 
so that they do not negatively impact their work 
ability, health, or well-being. These programs usu-
ally include assessment, short-term counseling and 
referral services for employees and their household 
members.
Innovative benefits and services strategies include 
(Agarwala, 2003):

 a focus on long-term benefits for employees 
through alternative insurance and health manage-
ment schemes

 giving benefits directed at employees’ families

 flexible employee benefits or the cafeteria ap-
proach, where employees choose from a menu of 
benefits

 child and elder care programs

 Improvements in retirement benefits
5. Rewards and Recognition
Rewards and recognition are used to encourage and 
motivate an organization’s employees, and effective 
reward management will promote consistency of 
practice in this area.
Innovative rewards and recognition strategies in-
clude (Agarwala, 2003):

 performance-linked rewards

 flexible rewards

 cash rewards for extraordinary performance

 rewarding team performance

 rewarding team performance

 public recognition of good performance at a com-
pany meeting or function

 recognition from co-workers

 a blend of financial and non-financial rewards
6. Technical Training
Human resource development concerns the mainte-
nance, refinement and advancement of competen-
cies possessed by the firm’s employees (Grønhaug 
and Nordhaug, 1992). Technical training refers to 
training for specific competence on the job, with re-
gard to technology and/or business process change. 
Training may take place on-the-job or outside the 
workplace.
Innovative technical training strategies include 
(Agarwala, 2003):

 systematic training needs assessment

 cross-functional training

 providing job relevant training

 facilitating transfer of training to actual job per-
formance
7. Management Development
The effectiveness of management is recognized as 
one of the determinants of organizational success, 
and investment in management development can 
have a direct economic benefit to organizations, 
since management development helps to develop 
leadership, supervision and control.
Innovative management development strategies 
include (Agarwala, 2003):

 linking management development to individual 
needs

 linking management development to organiza-
tional objectives

 using 
innovative 
management 
development 
methods, like stress management programs

 adventure training

 leadership and attitudinal training

 study leave
8. Career Planning and Development
Career planning and development refer to the assis-
tance given to employees, to help them plan for, exe-
cute and manage their career development within an 
organization. Some organizations may link the career 
progress of their members to succession planning.
Innovative career planning and development 
strategies include (Agarwala, 2003):

 developing career paths

 providing fast-track career plans

 providing mentors to employees

Management of Human Resources
Principles of Business: Management


 cross-functional career paths

 providing mentors to employees

 career counseling
9. Performance Appraisals
Performance management is the process linking 
goal setting and rewards, coaching for performance, 
aspects of career development and performance 
evaluation and appraisal into an integrated process 
(Sparrow et al, 1994). Performance appraisals are a 
key component of performance management; they 
may seek to measure and motivate customer service, 
quality, innovation and risk-taking behavior.
Innovative performance appraisal strategies in­
clude (Agarwala, 2003):

 giving weight to individual, team and organiza­
tional performance while appraising

 using quantifiable criteria for appraisals

 participative appraisals

 open appraisals to increase transparency

 giving appraisal feedback

 linking rewards to appraisals

 360-degree appraisals, where feedback comes 
from all around the employee: from subordi­
nates, peers and managers in the organizational 
hierarchy, as well as a self-assessment, and in some 
cases external sources such as customers and sup­
pliers or other interested stakeholders.
10. Potential Development
Potential development is a company-wide manage­
ment development program that seeks to cultivate 
performance and leadership at the top of the or­
ganization, through the provision of the necessary 
training, support and opportunities.
Innovative potential development strategies in­
clude (Agarwala, 2003):

 job rotations

 use of assessment centers

 coaching

 conducting potential appraisals
11. Succession Planning
This is a management development program aimed 
at filling specific positions with one of two potential 
candidates.
Innovative succession planning strategies include 
(Agarwala, 2003):

 identifying replacements

 provision of fall-back positions in case of failure

 preparing to assume higher responsibility
12. Employee Relations
As firms seek to empower and include employees in the 
organization, they ought to treat their employees with 
concern through effective internal communication 
flows; enhancement of the quality of work life; good 
labor relations; and health, welfare and safety programs.
Innovative employee relations strategies include 
(Agarwala, 2003):

 information sharing

 open and transparent communication

 family get-togethers

 humanizing work environment

 respecting employees

 ensuring fairness in management practices

 encouraging risk-taking
13. Employee Exit and Separation Management
Employee exit and separation management refers 
to the planning, facilitation and management of the 
departure of employees from an organization. Exit 
and separation may be initiated by employees them­
selves; by the state, through retirement; or by firms 
conducting specific “decruitment” activities such as 
downsizing and skills reprofiling.
Innovative employee exit and separation manage­
ment strategies include (Agarwala, 2003):

 extending benefits to retirees for lifetime

 retirement planning workshops for about-to-retire 
employees

 conducting exit interviews

 outplacement services

 voluntary retirement schemes
14. Corporate Responsibility
As their corporate responsibility, firms seek to recog­
nize and incorporate aspects of the external environ­
ment such as the general quality of the labor force, 
legal regulations or concerns about environmental 
quality, and social responsibility. They also ensure an

effective flow and sharing of information outside of 
the organization.
Innovative strategies for corporate responsibility 
include (Agarwala, 2003):

 adult education programs

 community development projects

 concern for greening and protection of the envi­
ronment

 research promotion
When well planned and implemented, the ‘right’ 
combination of the above variables should lead to job 
satisfaction, motivation, employee commitment and 
participation for employees, and ultimately, competi­
tive advantage for an organization.
Issues
As the management of human resources is seen in­
creasingly in terms of competitive advantage, the 
question that arises is, what must be done to gain this 
advantage? The answer is: strategic business change, 
with human resource processes at its core.
Before the 1990s, attempts to coordinate human 
resource management with a firm’s business strategy 
had taken one of three limited appoarches: corre­
lating managerial style or personnel activities with 
strategies; predicting manpower requirements based 
on strategic objectives or environmental conditions, 
and discovering ways to assimilate human resource 
management into the comprehensive attempt to 
equalize strategy and structure (Lengnick-hall and 
Lengnick-hall, 1988).
Since the early 1990s, however, the call has been 
made to integrate the management of human re­
sources with business strategy all the more. Rather 
than existing in a vacuum, the human resource activi­
ties in a firm are now expected to directly support busi­
ness strategy and the satisfaction of customer needs.
The integration of the management of human re­
sources with business strategy means that the man­
agement of human resources involves a wide variety 
of policies and procedures which are strategically sig­
nificant for the organization and are typically used 
to promote employee commitment, flexibility, good 
quality of work life as well as to realize overall busi­
ness goals such as organizational values, structure, 
productivity, and production techniques (Sparrow et 
al, 1994).
This has led to a concept in the management of 
human resources called “human resource strategy.” 
This concept refers to the set of decisions or factors 
that shape and guide the management of human 
resources in an organizational context. It is also 
a set of strategic processes communally shared by 
human resources and line managers to resolve 
people-related business issues. It is directly related 
to the business strategy and focuses on the formu­
lation and alignment of human resource activities 
to achieve organizational competitive objectives. 
Through human resource strategy, human resource 
management aims to increase value through issue 
identification, assessment, and resolution. The 
main issues targeted are those critical to the orga­
nization’s viability and success. It is a more action-
oriented strategy than traditional human resource 
planning.
Strategic human resource management works 
through many means, including the following:

 coordinating available resources with necessary 
staffing levels and abilities, through recruitment, 
selection, assignment, and other strategic staffing 
processes

 aligning individuals and groups with overall busi­
ness objectives through the management of per­
formance.

 developing needed capabilities and performance 
through training, education, and job-related 
learning

 enhancing the quality of management through an 
emphasis on management development

 bridging the gap between the strategic and the 
operational through the relationship between 
employee and line manager. The personnel or 
human resource management function advises 
the manager on how he/she can carry out these 
objectives, and line managers implement the stra­
tegic objectives of the organization through their 
leadership style and the way in which they manage 
their people.

 conducting human resource planning (predicting 
future business and environmental costs and gen­
erating the personnel requirements determined 
by those future conditions) as a key aspect of stra­
tegic planning. The resultant plans are strategic if 
they address significant change of direction—not 
merely continuity.

Management of Human Resources
Principles of Business: Management

In the 2010s, companies such as Google and 
Netflix have been lauded as models of innovation in 
terms of human resources management. As of 2014, 
Google had become known for not only its more 
luxurious employee perks and benefits, but also for 
its use of data-based analytics in the hiring process 
and in maintaining more positive employee attitudes 
(Rafter, 2015). At the same time, Netflix had become 
famous for its agile approach to managing its work­
force, including a dedication to hiring only the most 
qualified individuals, promoting open communica­
tion about employee performance rather than formal 
review processes, and maintaining a philosophy of 
treating employees maturely (McCord, 2014).
In the international arena, there has been a 
growing interest in international human resource 
management, as more markets internationalize, 
more nations become integrated into the interna­
tional world economy, and more businesses choose 
to expand their operations across national borders. 
The increasing attention drawn to this area reflects 
the prevalence of the realization that efficient and ef­
fective human resource management internationally 
is a key factor in the success of a business. Evidence 
suggests that human resource constraints are often 
the limiting factor when attempting to implement in­
ternational business strategies. Recently it has been 
argued that the fast pace of internationalization 
and globalization has led to a more strategic role for 
human resource management, and it also leads to 
changes in the content of human resource manage­
ment (Scullion & Starkey, 2000).
It is important for multinational firms to know 
which human resource policies and practices they can 
consider using in their worldwide operations, to as­
sist them in gaining competitive advantage. This leads 
to the questions whether different parts of the world 
practice human resource management for competi­
tive advantage differently; and whether there is some 
uniformity that firms can pursue in their efforts to 
manage their worldwide workforces successfully.
International businesses are increasingly turning 
their attention to issues such as expatriate manage­
ment, where employees are transferred by organiza­
tions to work outside their country of origin or per­
manent residence. Effective management in this area 
helps to reduce the early return of expatriates; to 
minimize disruption to international operations; and 
to prevent the situation where expatriates are not 
retained by the organization after completing their 
assignments. As it is believed that quality of manage­
ment is more critical in the international arena than 
in domestic operations (Tung, 1984), international 
firms are also looking at the plethora of issues stem­
ming from cross-cultural management, along with 
those issues surrounding the management of diver­
sity in multicultural domestic workforces. As the pace 
of internationalization has accelerated, the need for 
cross-cultural awareness, cross-cultural sensitivity, and 
understanding the daily operations of international 
businesses, has become more salient. Academicians 
too have advanced understanding in these areas 
through the development of the distinct sub-field of 
International Human Resource Management, within 
the management discipline. Marler (2012), for ex­
ample compares scholarship in the field from the 
United States, Germany and China, three countries 
with widely differing histories, economic and polit­
ical systems, and business cultures.

Management Science
ABSTRACT
Managers today are inundated by data. Often, the 
correct interpretation of these data can mean the 
difference between being on the cutting edge of a 
market and being left behind by the competition. To 
solve the complex business problems faced by organi­
zations in the 21st century, managers are increasingly 
turning to management science - the application of 
statistical techniques, scientific method, and mathe­
matical modeling - to analyze and solve the problems 
of the organization. Management science can help 
managers solve a wide range of problems in the work­
place and to make better decisions concerning the 
operation and strategy of the business. Management 
science offers managers many tools to help analyze 
and interpret the data with which they are bom­
barded every day. Some of these tools include data 
mining, decision support systems, and forecasting 
techniques.
OVERVIEW
Management is the process of efficiently and effec­
tively accomplishing work through the coordination 
and supervision of others. Effective management is 
much more than the effective application of such soft 
skills as management style, communication ability, 
and administrative prowess, however. Management 
also comprises the decisions that managers make to 
help gain or maintain a market share or to increase 
profitability within the marketplace. Although man­
agement decisions can be made subjectively based on 
a given manager’s experience, the amounts of data 
that must be processed in order to do this well con­
tinue to increase with the proliferation of informa­
tion technology and systems. As a result, managers 
are increasingly turning to management science 
— the application of statistical methods, scientific 
method, and mathematical modeling — to analyze 
and solve the problems of the organization.

Principles of Business: Management
Management Science

21st Century Applications of Management Science
Management science has many practical applications in 
21st century businesses. The use of probability theory, 
statistical techniques, and research methodology can 
help managers solve a wide range of problems in the 
workplace including optimizing cost/benefit tradeoffs 
in product design, improving the quality of services 
or products, forecasting the needs and trends of the 
marketplace, and improving the effectiveness of supply 
chain management. By applying mathematical statis­
tical techniques to the real problems of the business 
world, managers can make better decisions concerning 
the operation and strategy of the business.
Management science allows organizations to apply 
scientific method in order to solve many problems in 
the business world. For example, descriptive statistics 
are useful in summarizing and describing data. In 
addition, management science also includes the ap­
plication of business statistics to real world problems. 
This discipline is an applied form of mathematics and 
is a valuable tool for helping analyze and interpret 
data. In particular, the use of inferential statistics, a 
collection of techniques that allow one to make infer­
ences about the data, including the ability drawing 
conclusions about a population from a sample.
Another tool of management science is building 
models, or the development of abstract representa­
tions of situations, systems, or subsystems. Model de­
velopment typically occurs in two phases. First, a con­
ceptual model is developed to describe the situation 
or system. Initial conceptual models tend to be broad 
or general representations without much detail but 
which span the range of variables to be considered. 
Models typically must be tested and refined until they 
represent the real world to the degree desired by the 
analyst or decision maker. Models are iteratively re­
fined using observations of the real world so that they 
better reflect the underlying reality of the situaiton. 
When the conceptual model adequately reflects the 
major parameters of the real world, data can be gath­
ered and quantitative techniques used to turn the 
conceptual model into a mathematical model.
APPLICATIONS
In the 21st century, human beings are constantly 
bombarded with data that need to be sorted, ana­
lyzed, and interpreted. In the business world, the cor­
rect interpretation of data can mean the difference 
between being on the cutting edge of a market or 
being left behind by the competition. Management 
science offers managers many tools to help analyze 
and interpret the data with which they are bombarded 
every day. Data mining allows managers to examine 
large amounts of data for previously unseen patterns 
and relationships in order to help forecast the future 
of an industry or the needs of a market. Decision sup­
port systems help managers make reasoned decisions 
about the semi-structured and unstructured prob­
lems with which they are faced every day. Forecasting 
uses statistical tools to recognize trends and patterns 
in the data and provides managers with the empirical 
data necessary to help shape the growth and focus of 
the organization.
Data Mining
Data mining is the process of analyzing large col­
lections of data to establish patterns and determine 
previously unknown relationships between the data. 
The results of data mining efforts are used to predict 
future behavior. Data mining can be used to help the 
business better understand the needs and desires 
of current and potential customers and to identify 
and acquire high-value customers. The information 
produced by data mining efforts can also be used to 
optimize store layout for increased sales by shelving 
items that are frequently purchased together in close 
proximity. In addition, data mining can be used to in­
crease the profitability of the store or chain, increase 
return on investment, decrease the costs of adver­
tising and promotions, monitor performance of the 
store or business, and detect fraud, waste, and abuse. 
By detecting previously unrecognized patterns in 
data, data mining can help managers to make better 
decisions regarding business problems, develop 
novel approaches to meeting current organizational 
objectives, or create a more profitable strategic plan 
for the future of the organization.
Data Mining & Customer Relationship Management
Although data mining is used to examine the rela­
tionships within a wide variety of data across many 
disciplines, one of the primary uses of data mining in 
business is to find unknown relationships within sets 
of customer data. Among other things, data mining 
is frequently used in business for customer relation­
ship management. This is the process of identifying 
prospective customers, acquiring data concerning 

Management Science
Principles of Business: Management
224
these prospective and current customers, building 
relationships with customers, and influencing their 
perceptions of the organization and its products or 
services. For example, a data mining effort might 
examine the types of products purchased on line by 
owners of home computers. One source of data that 
is increasingly mined for information comes from re­
tail scanners. The customer cards issued by various 
retail stores (e.g., supermarkets, pet supply stores, 
drug stores) that many people carry in their wallets 
that give them discounts or points toward rewards 
also can be used to collect information that is used 
in data mining efforts. For example, a grocery store 
might use data mining software to analyze the pur­
chases made by consumers over the course of a week 
to determine what items are purchased together. For 
example, if the store finds that the purchases of fresh 
sweet corn fluctuate with the purchase of ribs during 
the summer, they might place pre-shucked corn next 
to the ribs in the refrigerated meat case. This knowl­
edge would also help the store determine whether or 
not to purchase more corn for the weeks when ribs 
were on sale. Alternatively, data mining could be used 
by the store or chain to push other products. Grocery 
stores often issue customers coupons at the checkout 
counter or send them to customer homes based on 
what purchases they have made. For example, pre­
vious purchases of Brand X paper towels might result 
in the generation of a discount coupon for a future 
purchase of Brand X paper towels or for a future pur­
chase of the store’s brand of paper towels.
Data mining applications can be based on a 
number of different techniques. The most com­
monly used of these is classification, which is used to 
analyze data in a database and build a model to pre­
dict future behavior. Among the tools used in data 
classification are neural networks and decision trees. 
Neural networks are mathematical structures that are 
capable of learning. This technique is most effective 
when there is a large amount of data to be analyzed 
and the relationships between the data are either 
complex or imprecise. Decision trees are used to clas­
sify data into a limited number of classes. Decision 
trees classify data based on if-then statements and 
although they tend to be faster than neural nets, 
also are more appropriate to data with less complex 
relationships. Another approach to data mining is 
clustering. This technique subdivides the database 
into groups of records that share common traits. The 
structure of these clusters is unknown before the 
analysis begins. This means that the clusters usually 
need to be interpreted before they can be put into 
use in the real world. Data mining can also be done 
based on sequence discovery, or the establishment 
of relationships or associations between items over 
time. (For example, consumers who purchase mater­
nity clothing this year are more likely than are those 
who do not to purchase diapers next year.)
Decision Support Systems
To help managers make the unique, complex deci­
sions that frequently arise in today’s businesses, many 
organizations use decision support systems. These 
are interactive computer-based systems that sup­
port managers in their decision making processes. 
Decision support systems help managers better un­
derstand the issues underlying the situation and to 
make decisions in situations where the extent to 
which certain variables influence the activity or out­
come are not initially clear or only part of the infor­
mation is available in advance (i.e., unstructured 
situations). To be of use in answering unstructured 
questions, decision support systems must be flexible 
so that the impact of various variables and conditions 
can be tested and the analysis be returned to the user 
in a form that is useful for the specific situation. In 
addition, unstructured problems typically require an 
iterative process: The answers to the questions are 
not ends in themselves, but raise other questions for 
consideration that need to be run through the deci­
sion support system.
Decision support systems can help managers by 
providing the information and structure needed to 
make a rational decision. A decision support system 
creates a quantitative model of the situation and then 
processes data to show the impact of the variables 
under consideration on the outcomes. Decision 
support systems can also help decision makers an­
swer questions concerning conditions under which 
an outcome might occur, what might happen if the 
value of a variable changes, or how many potential 
customers have certain characteristics.
Types of Decision Support Systems
There are several different general types of deci­
sion support systems including model-driven sys­
tems, data-driven systems, knowledge-driven systems, 
and group support systems. Model-driven decision 

Principles of Business: Management
Management Science
225
support systems use various financial, optimization, 
or simulation models as aids for managerial deci­
sion making. Data-driven decision support systems 
process time series data and access simple file sys­
tems using query and retrieval tools. More advanced 
data-driven systems allow the manipulation of data or 
analytical processing. Knowledge-driven systems are 
expert systems that frequently include the applica­
tion of artificial intelligence to the decision making 
process. These decision support systems are person/
computer systems with specialized problem solving 
abilities that can make suggestions or recommenda­
tions to the user.
Forecasting
Managerial science can also help managers forecast 
future requirements of the marketplace or the in­
dustry so that they can better position the organiza­
tion to effectively compete and survive. Businesses 
frequently need to know the trends of the market­
place in order to best position themselves to leverage 
this knowledge into profits. For example, a produc­
tion manager may need to know if there will be a con­
tinuing need for widgets and how much raw material 
is needed to meet the anticipated demand. A mar­
keting manager may need to know whether changing 
demographics in the marketplace mean that a new 
marketing strategy will be needed. A shipping man­
ager may need to know whether or not the price of 
oil will continue to rise and how this cost affects the 
outsourcing for the production of gizmos. A human 
resources manager may need to know whether or not 
the turnover in the organization will continue and 
if new sources of qualified employees need to be 
found. Managers can answers questions such as these 
through forecasting — the science of estimating or 
predicting patterns and variations about many as­
pects of the business including buying, selling, pro­
duction, and hiring.
Causes of Variation in Economic Activity
Managers are interested in a number of causes of 
variation in economic activity: Trends, business 
cycles, and seasonal fluctuations as well as irregular 
and random fluctuations. Trends are persistent, un­
derlying directions in which something is moving in 
either the short, intermediate, or long term. Many 
trends in established industries tend to be linear 
rather than cyclic, and steadily grow or shrink over 
a period of years. For example, in the US, there is 
an increasing trend towards the outsourcing and off­
shoring of technical support and customer service in 
the high tech industry. Trends in new industries, on 
the other hand, tend to be curvilinear as the demand 
for the new product or service grows after its intro­
duction then declines after the product or service be­
comes integrated into the economy.
Although managers can make forecasts subjec­
tively based on experience or other factors, manage­
ment science allows forecasts to be made based on 
quantitative analysis of data through the develop­
ment of structural and economic models. Structural 
models are based on sets of mathematical functions 
designed to represent the causal relationships within 
the organization’s environment. For example, before 
investing in a new venture, an organization might 
need to know the future price of its current product 
in order to forecast its profits and the resultant avail­
ability of funds for the new venture. Managers could 
be supported in this decision through the develop­
ment of a specification model that contains the fac­
tors affecting the supply and demand for the current 
product and the relationship between these factors. 
Another approach to business forecasting is the use 
of deterministic models. This type of model assumes 
that the variable of interest is a deterministic func­
tion of time and does not include the effects of any 
underlying data uncertainty or variability in the time 
series. Forecasting can also be done based on ad hoc 
forecasting formulas developed from past history. 
This type of model typically uses weighted moving 
averages. Although this approach simplifies com­
putation, there is no way to determine whether the 
formula chosen is the most appropriate. This means 
that there can be no concomitant confidence in the 
worth of the resultant forecasts. Forecasting can also 
be done through the use of time series analysis. Time 
series data are gathered on a specific characteristic 
over a period of time. To be useful, these data must 
be collected at intervals of regular length. As op­
posed to the ad hoc approach to forecasting (where 
it is impossible to tell whether or not the formula 
chosen is the most appropriate for the situation) in 
time series analysis, one can study the structure of the 
correlation of variables over time to determine the 
appropriateness of the model. The model can be re­
fined as necessary to make it more representative of 
the real world situation.

Principles of Business: Management
Managerial Leadership

Managerial Leadership
ABSTRACT
This paper will provide an overview of the neces­
sary qualities of effective management and discuss 
how adhering to core values and maintaining stan­
dards of ethical conduct are necessary to achieve 
managerial leadership. There are certain necessary 
qualities for effective management. Managers need 
to have strong organization skills, the ability to com­
municate, and the capacity to make decisions. These 
skills are essential for effective management whether 
one is managing a small business, a division within a 
company, or has oversight responsibility for a group 
in any other work environment. However, truly suc­
cessful managing requires a business owner or a man­
ager to go beyond these basic skill sets in order to set 
a higher standard of quality. In order to accomplish 
this, managers need to lead. Moreover, managerial 
leadership requires that a manager adhere to certain 
core values and standards of ethical conduct.
OVERVIEW
Managerial Skills
Regardless of the type of business or work situation, a 
successful enterprise requires effective management. 
There are certain basic skill sets that managers must 
have in order to be effective.

 First, a manager must be highly organized. This 
means that they need to manage their time effi­
ciently, prioritize their responsibilities and assume 
responsibility for the workflow of the group by del­
egating expediently.

 In order to delegate, a manager must also be able 
to communicate effectively. Successful commu­
nication requires a manager to speak and write 
clearly as well as to listen intently. In fact, listening 
is probably one of the more important abilities a 
manager must have to communicate effectively. 
This is because managers need to have a clear un­
derstanding of the group and what people can and 
cannot do. The best managers are those that rec­
ognize people’s capabilities so that they delegate 
responsibilities effectively. In short, employees 
should be put into positions where they are most 
likely to fulfill their duties successfully. By having 
strong communication skills, a manager will be 
able to delegate, and to act decisively (Ramona, 
Emanoil & Lucia, 2012).

 Being able to make decisions, whether popular or 
unpopular, also lends itself to a successful leader­
ship situation.
Essentially, having a successful business, agency or 
other enterprise requires having effective managers. 
Effective managers need to have strong organizational, 
communication and decision-making skills. More than 
this, successful managers must be capable of leading.
Managerial Functions
In order to lead, a manager must first master the 
basic functions of management. In his article, Justice 
Walton (2005) states that there are four functions of 
management:

 Short and Long Term Planning.

 Organizing a line or staff.

 Directing (taking charge of a department or orga­
nization and controlling).

 Implementing various techniques for managerial 
control.
Managers are supposed to delegate duties, not per­
form those duties. Moreover, a manager usually has the 
responsibility of choosing the people that will be doing 
the work. This means that the manager is in charge 
of hiring, firing, training and disciplining employees. 
Because of this, managers are also responsible for the 
work that the group performs. To ensure that the group 
is meeting consistent standards of quality, a manager 
must be able to motivate people and provide them with 
a sense of accomplishment. This means that managers 
need to communicate the big picture to employees by 
linking their role to the enterprise’s main function.
One factor that determines how a manager will 
perform these functions is his or her personality. A 
person’s temperament, character and personality are 
directly related to how he or she will not only manage, 
but also lead. Another important factor is a manag­
er’s emotional intelligence (Boyatzis, Good & Massa, 
2012; Davis, 2011). There are certain traits that allow 

Managerial Leadership
Principles of Business: Management
228
one to be an effective leader. Leaders must be able to 
work with others and show employees that their role 
does make a difference. To do this, managers must 
be positive thinkers and perform their role with en­
ergy. In so doing, they will instill energy in the team. 
Some of the traits that will enable a manager to lead 
include integrity, pride, sincerity, curiosity, passion 
and courage (Walton 2005). These traits will be fur­
ther discussed elsewhere in this article.
APPLICATIONS
Indicators of Successful Management
There are ways to determine if a company or enter­
prise is being successfully managed. Success usually 
manifests itself in results and this normally is reflected 
by financial outcomes, such as profit in a sales orga­
nization. This can also be reflected by a number of 
outcomes in an educational setting—such as the test 
scores of a particular grade level or the percentage of 
students graduating in a school district. Such results 
are also referred to as quantitative results and while 
these are important, there are also other results that 
need to be reviewed: qualitative results. These results 
can be reflected in a business enterprise by employee 
satisfaction, customer satisfaction, quality control, 
customer retention, and employee retention. Charles 
Kerns contends that there are six dimensions of 
quality results: (i) results need to be values driven, (ii) 
results should be grounded in ethical behavior, (iii) 
results must be related to the overall purpose of the 
entity, (iv) results need to be geared toward learning, 
(v) results must be able to be measured, and (vi) re­
sults need to provide a balanced perspective—both 
quantitative and qualitative, in determining the suc­
cess of the enterprise (Kerns 2005).
Importance of Core Values & Ethics
It is becoming more evident that the success of 
businesses, educational institutions, hospitals, and 
healthcare providers, as opposed to for profit or­
ganizations, government agencies, and any other 
group dynamic where people are working toward a 
common goal, is directly related to the entity’s values. 
This is reflected in both quantitative and qualitative 
results. A sales enterprise that is lacking a core set of 
values may be able to sustain itself in the short run, 
but at the end of the day, its long-term success will be 
the result of actions that are rooted in a set of core 
values. Adhering to a set of values lends itself to ac­
tions that are constructive and ethical.
Since values are directly related to the long-term 
success of an enterprise, these values must first be 
identified and then become part of the entity’s basic 
function. There should also be a means to ensure 
that these values are adhered to over time. In order 
for a manager to achieve this, he or she must follow 
those values. In so doing, managers set an example 
for the group and thereby gain credibility.
Once a set of core values has been established, the 
attitudes and behaviors that arise should be grounded 
in ethical behavior. Ethics has become a buzzword 
in the wake of the financial accounting scandals that 
arose throughout the first decade of the 2000s (for 
companies like ENRON in 2001 and Bernard L. 
Madoff Investment Securities in 2008), but ethical 
behavior in the long run will enable an organization 
to sustain qualitative and quantitative results. It is ul­
timately the responsibility of managerial leaders to 
adhere to standards of ethical conduct. A manager 
can lead the way by being truthful, having integrity, ex­
tending kindness, treating staffers with fairness, taking 
responsibility for his or her actions, and for the perfor­
mance of the group, and finally treating others with 
respect. In the end, a leader must have integrity and 
his or her effectiveness and leadership will be affected 
by whether the staff believes in a manager’s integrity.
Creating a Successful Environment
In addition to adhering to a set of values and acting 
ethically, a leader must be able to link the results of 
the enterprise and its people to the organization’s 
purpose. According to Kerns (2005), “without a posi­
tive connection between work and organizational pur­
pose—what we do each day becomes less meaningful.”
Making Employees Matter
This simply means that people need to believe that 
what they are doing has meaning and that their role 
makes a difference. In a sales organization, sales 
people can clearly see this link. But what of the op­
erations personnel—the accountants, customer ser­
vice reps, and clerical staff? At times, people serving 
these basic but vital functions tend to lose sight of the 
big picture; after all, the sales people who are suc­
cessful and receive the most commissions usually are 
compensated at a higher level than the operations 
personnel. In order to ensure that they continue to 

Principles of Business: Management
Managerial Leadership
229
achieve quality results, an operations manager must 
be able to remind his or her staff how their functions 
are connected to the overall success of the business, 
and this can only happen if the manager has mas­
tered one of the basic skills mentioned earlier: the 
ability to communicate.
A manager can only be successful at connecting a 
team’s work to the larger purpose of the organization 
if he or she can communicate and thereby create an 
environment that people believe is a good place to 
work. Not only must a leader ensure that the people 
he or she is responsible for managing believe their 
role is important, a leader can also ensure the quality 
of a team’s performance by putting team members in 
situations where they can learn. There are a number 
of ways to accomplish this. First a leader must ensure 
that he has hired the right people to do the job. Once 
the right people are in place, the manager is respon­
sible for ensuring that people learn the functions re­
quired to perform that role. But what happens when 
an employee has mastered that role? If employees 
stop learning they become stagnant. One way to pre­
vent this is for the manager to cross-train his or her 
team members so that they perform a variety of roles.
Evaluating & Responding to Results
While it is clear that quantitative results can be mea­
sured in numbers such as profits for a sales organi­
zation or numbers of students in a graduating class, 
qualitative results must also be measured. This can 
be achieved by incorporating the aforementioned 
values and ethical behaviors into the basic functions 
of the enterprise and into roles and responsibilities 
of the employees. If a manager has mastered the or­
ganizational skills that allow him or her to establish 
priorities, has communicated these priorities to staff 
members, and then ensures that these priorities are 
being fulfilled by providing people with consistent 
feedback, he or she can then make necessary deci­
sions such as rewarding, firing or disciplining people. 
At the end of the day, it is the manager’s job to de­
termine annual pay raises, bonuses and promotions, 
and these can be difficult decisions to make. Even 
harder than rewards, though, comes the responsi­
bility of doling out punishment.
At times, employees in a particular group or a di­
vision of a large corporation may not be meeting the 
objectives and goals to achieve the organization’s pur­
pose. In such times, the manager must make the tough 
decision to discipline certain individuals or even to 
close entire divisions. In the case of the former, the 
values of fairness and respect come directly into play. If 
an employee is treated fairly in a situation that requires 
disciplinary action, and if they are also treated with re­
spect, the decision and actions required will be handled 
more effectively. In a situation where an entire division 
of a company is closed, a leader must ensure that the 
decision was based on a valid reason and that the ac­
tion will ensure the long term profitability of the entity. 
Not everyone can make these tough calls and they go 
beyond the basic skill sets required for effective man­
aging; such decisions require managerial leadership.
VIEWPOINTS
Measuring Quantitative & Qualitative Results
Quantitative and qualitative results must be bal­
anced, and they must be monitored in a number of 
areas. These include financial (profits and other sim­
ilar results), customer satisfaction (easily measured 
through a strong orientation to customer service) 
and internal business purposes (linking the role of 
each group and the people in each group to the en­
tity’s overall purpose and potential for learning and 
growth) (Kerns 2005).
These measurements are ultimately the responsi­
bility of the manager, and in order to effectively as­
sume that responsibility, the manager must master the 
basic organizational, communication and decision-
making skills required of the position. Beyond this, a 
manager must have the ability to lead. Leadership re­
quires that a manager have certain core values and to 
act in a way that is ethical. This will encourage others 
to act ethically as well. By encouraging others to act 
ethically and in adherence to the organization’s core 
values, a manager will have greater success linking a 
group’s or individual’s performance to the business 
entity’s purpose. This can only happen if a manger 
has integrity. There are other leadership traits such 
as courage, pride, sincerity, vision, passion, curiosity 
and daring. These are not theoretical notions and 
many successful businesses, education and other 
leaders have spoken and written extensively about 
such leadership traits.
Jack Welch of GE on Successful Leadership
One such leader is Jack Welch, the former CEO 
of General Electric Corporation. In his book, 

Managerial Leadership
Principles of Business: Management
230
“Winning,” Welch elucidates on the very matters dis­
cussed in this paper. His long and successful tenure at 
GE offers a clear and distinct path toward managerial 
leadership.
Welch contends that before becoming a leader, 
an individual’s success in an organization is about 
self-development. Becoming a leader changes the 
focus from growing oneself to growing others. When 
one becomes a manager, one becomes responsible 
for other people, and because of this responsibility, 
a manager must go beyond basic functions of man­
aging and become a leader. This requires a manager 
to “resolve problems, assume responsibility, offer 
valid criticism, and set an example by pursuing high 
quality and acting with integrity” (Welch 2005).
There are a number of ways for a leader to pursue 
high quality, and for Welch, a leader must emanate 
positive energy. In addition to this, a leader must also 
be optimistic. “An upbeat manager that goes through 
the day with a positive outlook ends up running 
a team or organization filled with upbeat people” 
(Welch 2005).
In order to have successful managerial leader­
ship, people in positions of authority must also have 
the trait of courage. This trait rises from being able 
to make decisions. These decisions are all centered 
on ensuring that the organization is fulfilling its 
purpose. At times, this requires an organization to 
take risks, and ultimately someone is responsible for 
making those decisions. As Welch states, “Winning 
companies embrace risk taking and learning this re­
quires freely admitting mistakes...” (Welch 2005).
In order to make those decisions and to get people 
to act in a way that will bring about that vision a leader 
must also have sincerity. People need to be able to 
trust managers (i.e., leaders) and in order to trust 
them; people need to believe that leaders have integ­
rity. The way for a leader to establish his or her integ­
rity is to be trustworthy. In turn, the way for a leader 
to establish trust is by being open and honest. Being 
candid means that a leader communicates in a way 
that people know where they stand in terms of their 
performance. People also need to know how the busi­
ness is doing. If things are going well, people need to 
know that their efforts contributed to the organiza­
tion’s success. Accordingly, another way to establish 
trust is for a leader to credit people for their efforts.
By giving credit when appropriate, people are 
filled with a sense of pride, and this is another trait 
necessary for managerial leadership. Not only must 
a manager take pride is his role, and the goal of the 
entity, he or she must also take pride in the success 
of others. One way to ensure this is by having vision. 
It is the responsibility of the leader to determine the 
team’s vision and bring it to fruition. “The mission 
must be specific to the company’s vision, and the mis­
sion in business is to win” (Welch 2005).
To get people to share the vision, a manager must 
also have passion. Passion is not only a necessary in­
gredient for attaining managerial leadership. Passion 
is essential to being successful in any endeavor. This is 
seen in people who are excited about their work. One 
way to get people to be passionate about their work 
is by linking their efforts to the overall purpose of 
the organization, and it is the leader’s responsibility 
to bring forth this passion by manifesting positive en­
ergy. In the end, though, passion comes from within.
Not only does managerial leadership require pas­
sion, a leader must have a great deal of curiosity. A 
leader’s job is not to have all the answers, but rather, 
it is a leader’s responsibility to have all the questions. 
Not only must a leader have all the questions, the 
questions must engender open and honest debate. 
Finally a leader needs to ensure that the questions he 
or she raises will result in effective action. Questions 
must lead to results and sometimes those results may 
not be what were originally intended. Because of this, 
another trait essential to leadership is daring. A leader 
must be willing to face confrontations that may arise 
from his or her passion, curiosity and tough decisions. 
A leader must also be able to resolve those conflicts. 
In these instances, a leader will be more inclined to 
be successful if they adhere to a core set of values and 
establish trust by conducting themselves ethically.
CONCLUSION
There are certain fundamental skills required for 
effective management. Included in these skills 
are organizational, communication and decision-
making skills. These skills are necessary in order to 
fulfill the four basic functions of management and 
these are short and long-term planning, organizing 
a line or staff, directing (taking charge of a depart­
ment or organization and controlling), and imple­
menting various techniques for managerial control. 
Whether an organization is being managed success­
fully will be reflected in results. There are two types of 

Principles of Business: Management

231
results, quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative re­
sults are normally evidenced by financial outcomes. 
Qualitative results, on the other hand, can be mea­
sured in a number of other ways. Included in those 
measurements are that results need to be values 
driven, and that results should be grounded in eth­
ical behavior. Ultimately, the person responsible for 
these results is the manager. And so not only must a 
manager have basic skill sets to ensure that the basic 
functions of management are being fulfilled, a man­
ager must go further and become a leader.
Managerial leadership requires managers to have 
certain traits, especially integrity. A leader that has 
integrity will ensure that the business entity’s results 
are values driven, will conduct himself or herself 
ethically, and in so doing engender the trust of the 
people under the manager’s direction. In the end, 
that trust will manifest itself in the purpose or goals 
of the enterprise.

Managing Conflict within Organizations through Negotiations
ABSTRACT
This article will focus on negotiation. Negotiation, 
as a tool of conflict management and conflict reso­
lution in modern business organizations, will be de­
scribed and analyzed in the following sections. The 
article will provide an overview of organizational con­
flict and conflict management. The role of conflict 
manager will be described. The article will include 
discussion and analysis of the main models, tactics, 
and strategies for negotiation. Integrative and dis­
tributive approaches to negotiation will be addressed.
OVERVIEW
Negotiation, which refers to the process of bargaining 
preceding an agreement, is part of a larger process 
of managing conflict within organizations. While 
this article focuses on business negotiations, nego­
tiation should be understood as a central and funda­
mental conflict resolution and management tool used 
by individuals, governments, and businesses alike. 
Negotiation skills, used to manage interpersonal, inter-
group, inter-organizational, and international conflict, 
are crucial for participation in the modern business 
world. Organizational conflict and organizational 
change, and related negotiation mechanisms and tools 
for managing these processes, are characteristic of cur­
rent business practices across businesses and industries.
Changes in contemporary business practices are 
causing the role of negotiation in business to evolve 
from conflict resolution to conflict management. 
In the twenty-first century, private sector organiza­
tions are increasingly moving from traditional au­
thoritative, hierarchical structures to cooperative, 
team-based structures. The new team-based model 
of organizations, dependent upon cooperation and 
functioning work relationships, requires high-level 
knowledge of negotiation skills, conflict management 
skills, and mediation tactics. This structural change 
is occurring in large part as a result of globalization 
and its related processes as well as the Internet and 
related technologies. Businesses and industries are 
increasingly transnational, decentralized operations. 
Goods and services may be produced in one region 
and sold in another. Telecommuting is a common 
work choice made in businesses with virtual rather 
than brick-and-mortar headquarters and stores. The 
increased pace of technological development and 
innovation requires businesses to become learning 
organizations to remain competitive in the market­
place. Cooperative management and participatory 
problem solving, both requiring negotiation skills, 
are common in team-based, decentralized business 
organizations. Furthermore, a culture that includes 
conflict as creative tension but not as a destructive 
force is an element of successful team-based organi­
zations (Boni & Weingart, 2012).
Negotiation, as a tool of conflict management in 
modern business organizations, will be described 
and analyzed in this article. The following sections 
provide an overview of organizational conflict and 
conflict management. These sections will serve as the 
foundation for a discussion and analysis of negotia­
tion, mediation, and the relationship between nego­
tiation and conflict management.
Organizational Conflict
Organizational conflict, which refers to an interactive 
process manifested in incompatibility, disagreement,

or dissonance within or between social entities, cre­
ates organizational change. Types of conflict include 
interpersonal, inter-group, inter-organizational, and 
international conflict. Conflict is a social process. 
Contextual antecedents, such as individual, team, 
project, and organizational characteristics, influ­
ence and may exacerbate conflict (Barki & Hartwick, 
2001). The conflict process can be positive or nega­
tive. Functional conflict creates positive change within 
the organization. Dysfunctional conflict creates nega­
tive change within the organization. Organizational 
conflict can arise from problems within work activi­
ties as well as incompatible preferences and goals.
Singleton, Toombs, Taneja, Larkin, and Pryor 
(2011) suggest that definitions of conflict will differ 
depending on the level of volatility, or perceived vola­
tility, in the conflict. In the least volatile realm, the 
word conflict implies dissension, disagreement, op­
position, and lack of consensus among two or more 
people. In the most volatile realm, the implication is 
associated animosity, anger, antagonistic words and/
or behavior, and increasing levels of frustration. In 
either case, those involved in the conflict should un­
derstand the difference between functional and dys­
functional conflict and whether, and the extent to 
which, conflict management and conflict resolution 
theories and tools are needed.
Occurrence of Organization Conflict
Organizational conflict often occurs in the following 
situations and scenarios (Rahim, 2002):

 Parties are required to engage in an activity that is 
incongruent with their needs or interests.

 Parties hold behavioral preferences that are in­
compatible with another person’s implementa­
tion of his or her preferences.

 Parties want some mutually desirable resource 
that is in short supply.

 Parties possess attitudes, values, skills, and goals 
that are appropriate for directing their behavior 
but contradict the attitudes, values, skills, and 
goals held by others within an organization.

 Two parties have contradictory preferences re­
garding their joint actions.
Interpersonal Conflict
”Interpersonal conflict” refers to a phenomenon 
that occurs between interdependent parties as they 
experience negative emotional reactions to per­
ceived disagreements and interference with the 
attainment of their goals. Interpersonal conflict 
within organizations often occurs on project teams 
involving multiple parties with potentially conflicting 
agendas, goals, styles, personalities, and objectives. 
Symptoms of interpersonal conflict include hos­
tility, jealousy, steam rolling, poor communication, 
political maneuvering, a proliferation of technical 
rules, norms, and regulations, frustration, and low 
morale. Interpersonal conflict is characterized by 
interdependence, disagreement, interference, and 
negative emotion. Interpersonal conflict within orga­
nizations can produce positive or negative results or 
change. Examples of negative outcomes from inter­
personal conflict include distrust of others, hostility, 
decreased group coordination and cohesiveness, 
reduced job satisfaction and motivation, higher ab­
senteeism and turnover, grievances, and lower per­
formance and productivity. Examples of positive out­
comes from interpersonal conflict include greater 
self-awareness, creativity, adaptation, and learning 
(Barki & Hartwick, 2001).
Diagnosis of Organizational Conflict
Most people, groups, and organizations have con­
flict thresholds that must be exceeded for conflict 
to occur. Managers are generally responsible for the 
diagnosis of organizational conflict. The diagnosis of 
organizational conflict generally specifies the type of 
conflict, parties involved, and level and type of inter­
vention needed. A diagnosis should indicate whether 
there is need for an intervention and the type of in­
tervention needed.
Goals & Objectives of Intervention
Interventions in situations of organizational crisis are 
designed to accomplish the following goals and ob­
jectives (Rahim, 2002):

 Interventions in situations of organizational crisis 
are designed to attain and maintain a moderate 
amount of substantive conflict in non-routine 
tasks at various levels.

 Interventions in situations of organizational crisis 
are designed to reduce affective conflict at all levels.

 Interventions in situations of organizational crisis 
are designed to enable the organizational mem­
bers to select and use the appropriate styles of

handling conflict so that various situations can be 
effectively dealt with.

 Despite the fact that conflict often serves a func­
tion within organizations, conflict management 
most often attempts to reduce, resolve, and mini­
mize conflict (Rahim, 2002).
Conflict Management
Managers, across a wide range of businesses and in­
dustries, oversee organizational conflict to ensure 
successful resolution. Conflict is managed by orga­
nizational leaders often referred to as “conflict man­
agers.” “Conflict management,” which refers to de­
signing effective macro-level strategies to minimize 
the dysfunctions of conflict and enhance the con­
structive functions of conflict in order to enhance 
learning and effectiveness in an organization, is rec­
ognized as its own field (Rahim, 2002). Examples 
of conflict management include negotiation, bar­
gaining, mediation, and arbitration. There are two 
main categories of conflict management techniques 
including conflict stimulation and conflict resolu­
tion. “Conflict stimulation” refers to the creation of 
conflict within organizations to promote change. 
Conflict resolution includes techniques (such as 
problem solving, expansion of resources, avoid­
ance, compromise, authoritative command, altering 
human variables, and altering structural variables) to 
reduce conflict within the organization.
Conflict Management Styles
Different conflict management styles have different out­
comes. “Conflict management styles” refer to general 
strategies or behavioral orientations individuals adopt 
when dealing with conflicts. There are five different 
modes or styles of conflict management including as­
serting, accommodating, compromising, problem-
solving, and avoiding (Barki & Hartwick, 2001):

 Asserting: Conflict, within the asserting manage­
ment approach, is considered a win-lose situation. 
This approach is also referred to as “competing,” 
“dominating,” and “forcing.”

 Accommodating: The accommodating approach 
to conflict management involves individuals 
obliging or yielding to others’ positions or coop­
erating in an attempt to smooth over conflicts. 
This approach is also referred to as “cooperating,” 
“obliging,” “yielding,” and “sacrificing.”

 Compromising: The compromising approach to 
conflict management involves give and take behav­
iors where each party wins some and loses some. 
This approach is also referred to as “sharing” and 
“splitting the difference.”

 Problem-solving: The problem-solving approach 
to conflict management occurs when individuals 
in conflict try to fully satisfy the concerns of all 
parties. This approach is also referred to as “inte­
grating,” “cooperating,” and “collaborating.”
 Avoiding: The avoiding approach to conflict manage­
ment occurs when individuals are indifferent to the 
concerns of either party and refuse to act or partici­
pate in conflict. This approach is also referred to as 
“withdrawing,” “evading,” “escaping,” and “apathy.”
Research has shown that demographic and person­
ality traits affect which mode or style of conflict man­
agement individuals choose to employ in the work­
place. For instance, gender research suggests women 
tend to accommodate, compromise, or avoid conflict 
while men tend to assert or compete more (Sone, 
1981; Cardona, 1995, qtd. in Prause & Mujtaba, 
2015). Similarly, a person’s dominant values influ­
ence his or her conflict management style: those who 
value self-transcendence (humility, cooperation, etc.) 
are more accommodating; those who prize conser­
vation (self-image, recognition, etc.) are inclined to 
avoid conflict; those for whom self-enhancement (au­
thority, power, wealth, etc.) is of prime import tend to 
dominate; and those with an openness to change (in­
dependence, curiosity, harmony) are likely to engage 
in problem solving (Anjum, Karim & Bibi, 2014).
Criteria Necessary for Successful Conflict Resolution
Team-based organizations increasingly work to 
manage conflict rather than resolve conflict. All con­
flict management strategies, including asserting, ac­
commodating, compromising, problem-solving, and 
avoiding, must satisfy certain criteria to be effective. 
These criteria include organizational learning and 
effectiveness, needs of stakeholders, and ethics:

 Organizational learning and effectiveness: Conflict 
management strategies, designed to enhance orga­
nizational learning, enhance critical and innova­
tive thinking. Organizational members, including 
employees and managers, are expected to learn 
the process of conflict diagnosis and intervention.

Principles of Business: Management
Managing Conflict within Organizations through Negotiations
235

 Needs of stakeholders: Conflict management 
strategies, designed to satisfy the needs and expec­
tations of the strategic stakeholders and to attain 
a balance among them, involve these parties in a 
problem-solving process that will lead to collective 
learning and organizational effectiveness. This 
conflict management strategy is intended to lead 
to stakeholder satisfaction and confidence.

 Ethics: Conflict management designed to define 
organizational problems so that it leads to ethical 
actions that benefit humankind is referred to as 
“ethical conflict management.”
Conflict management in a contemporary business 
organization’s functions requires a supportive orga­
nizational culture. Employees in contemporary busi­
ness organizations that value conflict management 
are encouraged by managers and leadership to en­
gage in the process of diagnosis of and intervention 
in problems. An organizational culture that supports 
conflict management encourages task-related con­
flict and discourages emotional conflict; supports or­
ganizational learning; risk taking, openness; diverse 
viewpoints; continuous questioning and inquiry; 
and sharing of information and knowledge. Conflict 
management, within a supportive organizational 
culture, has the potential to enhance organizational 
learning that involves knowledge acquisition, knowl­
edge distribution, information interpretation, and 
organizational memorization (Rahim, 2002).
APPLICATIONS
Negotiation
In the business sector, negotiation is used within and 
between organizations. Negotiation is used in the com­
mercial arena of buying and selling and solving indus­
trial relations problems (Baines, 1994). “Commercial 
or business negotiation” refers to the process for re­
solving differences of opinion that arise in contract 
dealings between a buyer and seller. Commercial nego­
tiations can involve a complex range of financial, busi­
ness, and contractual issues. Planning, conducting, and 
analyzing the outcomes of commercial negotiations 
are key elements of a successful business (Ashcroft, 
2004). Negotiations between individuals and orga­
nizations can be adversarial, coercive, emotional, 
cooperative, logical, courteous, or mutually advanta­
geous. Negotiation of all kinds requires preparation, 
discussion, offers, and bargaining. While these are 
viewed as distinct stages, they build on one another. 
Preparation involves clarifying basic assumptions, se­
lecting the negotiating team, choosing the leaders, 
discovering information, deciding on aims for the 
process, and arranging the physical environment or 
meeting place. The negotiating session involves intro­
ductions, presentation of cases, listening, offering op­
tions, summarizing, taking breaks, not rushing, making 
a deal when appropriate, and formalizing the negoti­
ated agreement by signing a document (Baines, 1994).
Traditional Models of Negotiation
Traditionally, there have been three main models 
of negotiation: integrative, distributive, and interde­
pendence (Donohue & Roberto, 1996):

 Integrative model of negotiation: The integrative 
model of negotiation focuses on multiple issues, 
engages in problem solving, offers concessions 
and acceptances, and focuses on mutually benefi­
cial solutions.

 Distributive model of negotiation: The distribu­
tive model of negotiation involves parties within a 
distributive orientation that may conceal informa­
tion, exaggerate their positions, and use threats, 
attacks, demands, and repetitive arguments. Dis­
tributive negotiation behavior works to create a 
context that makes integration less acceptable.

 Interdependence model of negotiation: The in­
terdependence model of negotiation combines 
integrative and distributive models. Negotiators 
continuously and explicitly define their interde­
pendence by offering information, strategies, and 
tactics that foster both cooperation and competi­
tion. The interdependence model exists along a 
continuum of integrative-distributive processes.
Contemporary Models of Negotiation
Changes in contemporary business practices, due 
to globalization, new technology, and emergence of 
team-based organizations, have expanded the field 
of negotiation strategies to include additional ap­
proaches (and models) of negotiation such as power-
based, interests-based, needs-based, dignity model, 
comprehensive systemic, SWOT, and stage:

 Power-based model of negotiation: The power-
based model of negotiation, based on distributive 

Managing Conflict within Organizations through Negotiations
Principles of Business: Management
236
principles, is characterized by selfishness, aggres­
sive behavior, and competition. Power-based dis­
putants will work to maximize their individual self-
interest (Chaterjee, 2006).

 Interest-based model of negotiation: The interest-
based model of negotiation, also referred to as 
“interest-based bargaining” or “mutual gains bar­
gaining,” refers to bargaining processes that are 
focused on understanding and building on inter­
ests and using problem-solving tools as a way of 
avoiding positional conflicts and achieving better 
outcomes for all stakeholders. Interest-based ne­
gotiation skills and tactics include active listening, 
converting positions into underlying needs or in­
terests, joint data collection, brainstorming, joint 
task forces, facilitation, and effective communica­
tion with constituents (Fonstad, 2004). The in­
terest-based model of negotiation, based on inte­
grative negotiation, separates disputants from the 
problem, focuses on interests and not positions, 
generates a variety of possibilities before creating 
an agreement, and insists that the results be based 
on some objective criteria (Chaterjee, 2006).

 Need-based model of negotiation: The human 
needs approach to conflict negotiation treats dis­
putants as socio-psychological beings with certain 
needs that require fulfillment not as rational ac­
tors interested in the furtherance of self-interest. 
The need-based approach assumes that conflict 
arises from a threat to fundamental needs. The 
need-based model of negotiation works toward 
win-win solutions (Chaterjee, 2006).

 Dignity model of negotiation: The dignity model 
of negotiation assumes that situations of conflict 
arise from inhuman physical and verbal violence 
that compromise individual and group dignity. 
The dignity model of negotiation is based on the 
following premises: acceptance of humanity, vali­
dation of gender, class, race identities, recognition 
of each party, understanding, fairness, security, 
inclusion, autonomy, trust, and access to relation­
ship recovery (Chaterjee, 2006).

 Comprehensive systemic model of negotiation: 
The comprehensive systemic model of negotiation 
addresses conflict as mediation between structure 
and agency. “Structure” refers to the broad frame­
work that a social system functions within, and 
“agency” refers to individual and collective action 
(Chaterjee, 2006).

 SWOT model of negotiation: The SWOT model 
of negotiation is used to evaluate the company’s 
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. 
This business management tool is an effective 
business negotiation strategy. Looking at a firm’s 
production and marketing goals and assessing the 
firm’s operations and management policies and 
practices in light of those goals, the SWOT model 
is used to plan negotiating tactics and strategy. 
Knowledge of company’s strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities, and threats allows for savvy and in­
formed negotiation (Cellich, 1990).

 The stage model of negotiation: The stage model 
of negotiation specifies a fixed number of stages 
that negotiators move through as they interact 
and move toward closure. Negotiators begin in a 
distributive mode, concealing information and 
using aggressive and contentious strategies, and 
then move toward an integrative mode empha­
sizing problem solving and supportive strategies 
(Donohue & Roberto, 1996).
Determining the Negotiation Model to be Used
Conflict managers, and individual parties or dispu­
tants, decide which negotiation model or approach 
to use based on multiple factors including consis­
tency of frame, nature of negotiator training, time al­
located to negotiate, goals of disputants, and level of 
uncertainty (Donohue & Roberto, 1996):

 Consistent frame: Numerous factors emerge 
during negotiations that push parties into a consis­
tently integrative or distributive frame.

 Nature of negotiator training: Negotiators are 
usually trained to use a specific sequence of be­
haviors in the course of their negotiation pro­
ceedings.

 Time to negotiate: The amount of time available 
or allocated to negotiation sessions varies by nego­
tiator, organization, business, and industry.

 Goals of disputants: The goals of disputants in­
volved in negotiation may initially be implicit or 
explicit as well as reasonable or unreasonable. 
Negotiators describe the key points of each dis­
putant’s case, claim, or position to make goals 
clear to everyone involved in the negotiation 
session.

 Level of uncertainty: When disputants enter into a 
negotiation session uncertain of their knowledge 
of the issues, their understanding of their oppo­

237
nent’s position, or their ability to predict their op­
ponent’s goals and strategies, instability and vola­
tility is likely to result.
Steps to Negotiation
Ultimately, despite the specific negotiation model or 
approach chosen by the negotiator, similar processes 
or sub-processes will be present in all negotiations. 
For example, negotiators are competitors with their 
counterparts in claiming scarce resources; negotia­
tors are collaborators with their counterparts in cre­
ating value; negotiators are relationship-shapers; and 
negotiators are coalition managers and consensus 
builders within their own organization (Fonstad, 
2004). In addition, all the negotiation models de­
scribed above include the same basic steps. The stan­
dard steps of the negotiation process include prepa­
ration, the opening phase, reaching agreement, and 
closure (Manning & Robertson, 2004):

 Preparation: Preparation establishes the issues, 
gathers quality information, prepares the case, 
and prepares for the encounter.

 The opening phase: The opening phase creates a 
positive climate in which disputants state their in­
dividual cases.

 Reach agreement: Reaching agreement involves 
disputants challenging the opponent’s case, re­
sponding to challenges, making concessions, and 
trading, linking, and moving to reach agreement.

 Closure: Closure summarizes and records agree­
ments as well as establishes monitoring and review 
procedures.
Issues & Variables that Impact Negotiation Processes
Issues and variables that impact all steps of the ne­
gotiation process described above include clarity of 
focus, flexibility of strategy, win-win values, and inter­
active skills (Manning & Robertson, 2004):

 Clarity of focus: Clarity of focus includes defining 
the issues, having a clear and simple case, using dif­
ferent types of information from a variety of sources, 
taking time before making decisions, agreeing to 
the outcome, monitoring, and reviewing.

 Flexibility of strategy: Flexibility of strategy involves 
finding out about the other party and what they 
want, taking a long-term perspective, planning 
around issues rather than in a strict sequence, and 
using concessions, adjournments, and doing what­
ever is necessary to reach an agreement.

 Win-win values: Win-win values involves having re­
spect for the other party and what they want, con­
sidering a wide range of options and outcomes, 
ensuring both parties clearly present their case, 
and cooperating openly to achieve mutually ac­
ceptable outcomes.

 Interactive skills: Interactive skills involve showing 
personal warmth, seeking information and clari­
fication throughout, summarizing and testing un­
derstanding of what is said, and being open and 
non-defensive.
Negotiation has the potential to manage conflict 
and promote collaboration, learning, and more ef­
fective business operations. If the negotiation process 
is ineffective and conflict persists within the organi­
zation or between parties, then parties or disputants 
move toward mediation or arbitration. “Mediation” 
refers to the use of a third party in the negotiation 
process to facilitate a resolution through persua­
sion or alternative ideas. “Arbitration” refers to the 
involvement of a neutral third party in the negotia­
tion process who has the authority to decide on an 
agreement. Mediation is one of a group of alterna­
tive methods to resolve business disputes including 
arbitration, mini-trials, expanded use of value billing, 
and alternative fee arrangements with counsel. 
Mediation of business disputes often allows dispu­
tants to avoid the filing of a lawsuit entirely (Berman, 
1994). Mediation is a dispute resolution tool used 
to settle disputes between individuals, companies, 
workers, and states that fosters agreement and re­
duces conflict. Mediators or arbitrators are disinter­
ested and are neutral third parties (Greig, 2005).
CONCLUSION
Ultimately, conflict management strategies, which 
range from negotiating, asserting, accommodating, 
compromising, 
problem-solving, 
and 
avoiding, 
serve to minimize conflicts at various levels as well 
as work to attain and maintain a moderate amount 
of substantive conflict to promote healthy change 
and growth within business organizations. Conflict 
managers have the responsibility to select and use 
the appropriate conflict management strategy for the 
conflict and the disputants (Rahim, 2002). General

guidelines for negotiating, relevant to all the negotia­
tion models described in this article, include taking 
time to break the ice, presenting the case, listening, 
being prepared to suggest many options, summa­
rizing regularly, and being prepared to take a break 
when negotiation stalls (Baines, 1994). Negotiation 
outcomes tend to vary based on the perspective and 
orientation of disputants. Parties with integrative 
orientation view negotiation as a win-win endeavor. 
Parties with a distributive orientation view nego­
tiation as a win-lose endeavor. Additionally, there is 
evidence that the perceived effectiveness and use of 
different conflict resolution behaviors varies across 
cultures (Sadri, 2013). Conflict managers must as­
sess the positional bias of each participant to ensure a 
successful negotiation outcome for all involved.

Managing in a Turnaround Environment
ABSTRACT
Turnaround is the process of reviving and growing 
underperforming companies. Turnaround efforts are 
usually led by experienced turnaround managers, who 
are consultants brought into a company during its de­
cline phase. The turnaround process has three phases, 
namely, the crises stage, stabilization stage, and re­
covery stage. Turnaround managers, already working 
under difficult conditions, face many challenges from 
factors both internal and external to their company.
OVERVIEW
A turnaround is a process whereby a company that has 
been experiencing an extended period of poor perfor­
mance, is led to experience substantial and sustained 
positive performance. As a topic in the field of busi­
ness management, turnaround is attracting increasing 
attention from researchers, educators, investors, 
managers and consultants. Developments in this area 
have led to the establishment of the discipline of turn­
around management, the profession of turnaround 
managers, and the practice of turnaround investing.
Turnaround managers are consultants who are 
hired during financial crises, to save distressed compa­
nies from bankruptcy and turn around their fortunes. 
Turnaround managers join a company either as CEO 
or consultant, so that they can direct the turnaround 
process. This is largely preferable to the situation 
where a company’s owners or senior mangers attempt 
to turn around their company themselves, since their 
lack of objectivity and emotional involvement often 
lead them to create new problems without resolving 
any of the old ones. Much depends on the turnaround 
manager: If he or she is not able to save a company 
from bankruptcy, or if the company’s core business is 
not profitable, the company will be liquidated.

Managing in a Turnaround Environment
Principles of Business: Management
240
Even though turnarounds can be one of the best 
means by which a company can attain long-term sus­
tainability, many of those in top positions in ailing 
companies find it difficult to even accept that they 
need a turnaround. This is one of the biggest obsta­
cles to turnaround, and it is based on several factors:

 Firstly, many corporate executives believe that to 
initiate a turnaround is tantamount to admitting 
failure.

 Secondly, some corporate executives believe that 
turnarounds lead to mass redundancies, and this 
leads them to resist the idea of a turnaround. How­
ever, this is not the case: It is only those employees 
who do not add value in the workplace that will 
typically be laid off during the turnover process.
 Thirdly, there is a misconception that other compa­
nies will cease to do business with a company under­
going a turnaround. On the contrary, however, firms 
tend to be drawn to a company in turnaround, be­
cause the very fact that it has initiated a turnaround 
implies that it is a responsible and serious company.
Even when CEOs accept that their company needs 
a turnaround, they often take a long time to arrive at 
such a decision. Due to such hesitation, turnarounds 
are often initiated by third parties such as lenders 
(such as banks), bankruptcy attorneys, or investors 
who have a stake in the company.
Companies that need a turnaround most often 
experience underperformance in the areas of man­
agement, finances, competition, operations, and 
strategy. Management underperformance can usu­
ally be seen in areas such as leadership issues; skills 
issues; micromanagement instead of delegation; or­
ganizational structure issues; ineffective communica­
tion; misplaced compensation and incentives; and 
high employee turnover.
Financial underperformance is usually evident in 
excessively low sales volume; excessively low prices; 
excessively high expenses; poor balance sheet man­
agement; debt; and insufficient working capital. 
Competitive under-performance tends to be char­
acterized by factors such as uncompetitive products; 
service and support issues; obsolescence; and quality 
issues. These can lead to a loss of established business 
and/or a failure to get new businesses.
Operational underperformance is characterized 
by lean manufacturing opportunities; poor capacity 
planning; poor scheduling; and process inefficien­
cies. The last area of underperformance, strategic un­
derperformance, is characterized by market channel 
issues; supply chain tier issues; and scale issues.
Further Insights
A turnaround environment can be defined as the social, 
technological, economic and political environment in 
which a turnaround company functions. The internal 
turnaround environment consists of stakeholders such 
as customers, suppliers, employees, board of directors, 
and creditors; the external turnaround environment 
consists of factors and forces beyond the control of 
the company, including the economic environment, 
technical environment, legal environment, political 
environment and cultural environment. The nature 
of a company’s internal and external turnaround en­
vironment has an effect on that company’s decisions, 
turnaround strategies, processes and performance.
Needless to say, managing a turnaround is a chal­
lenging experience. For instance, those managing 
in a turnaround environment must do so under in­
tense time pressure. Today’s turnaround managers 
are being given less time to carry out their tasks, with 
some being expected to complete a turnaround in 
six months. Turnaround managers need special skills 
and competencies to effectively manage the unique 
planning and control processes that are required in 
managing and turning around a distressed and loss-
making company. As if these challenges were not 
enough, turnaround managers also have to deal with 
opposition from within their assigned company, for 
instance from senior managers who resist replace­
ment, or from employees who fear losing their jobs.
Stages of the Turnaround Process
The turnaround process comprises three stages: Crises, 
stabilization and recovery. Each stage has a different 
objective and requires a different type of action by the 
turnaround manager. The objectives and turnaround 
actions of each stage are depicted in the table below.
Pre-Turnaround Stage: Decline
Before the beginning of any turnaround, there is a 
significant phase that the company must have gone 
through, which is worth discussing here. This stage is 
called ‘decline,’ and it is characterized by sustained 
poor performance. Management perceptions and ac­
tions during this phase will determine whether or not a 

Principles of Business: Management
Managing in a Turnaround Environment
241
company requires a turnaround, since timely interven-
tion can reverse the decline process. Even if a company 
does require a turnaround, management perceptions 
and actions during this phase will determine whether 
the company actually embarks on the turnaround; and 
how successful the turnaround is likely to be.
Decline can be caused by internal and external 
factors. For example, an internal factor such as the 
processing and analysis of company information, if 
ineffective, can lead to a decline. Likewise, compa-
nies that fail to keep up with changes in the external 
environment are also likely to decline.
Crisis Stage
The first of the three stages of a turnaround is the 
crises stage. At this stage, a company is close to bank-
ruptcy or liquidation. By this stage, a company would 
have sustained heavy losses, and therefore, cash out-
flows would have exceeded cash inflows. As such, the 
crises stage calls for financial action to create a posi-
tive cash flow situation.
The dire situation may lead to changes in the top 
management team (this tends to happen often in 
Western countries, and in companies which have rela-
tively high outsider control of the Board of Directors). 
A turnaround manager would typically be hired at 
this stage. The main reason why top managers are 
asked to leave companies that are embarking on a 
turnaround, is that the top managers find it difficult 
to recognize problems, since they are usually respon-
sible — at least in part — for those same problems, 
and it would be difficult for them to put together the 
necessary creative solutions while having the same 
mindset that led to the problems in the first place.
Analysis
To be able to make proper evaluation and diag-
noses of the situation at hand, a turnaround man-
ager would need to conduct seven types of analyses 
with current — not past or future — company 
information. These seven analyses are: Financial 
analyses, working capital analyses, cost analyses, 
expense analyses, personnel analyses, asset anal-
yses, and market analyses. Of the seven, financial 
and working capital analyses tend to be consid-
ered by turnaround managers to be the most im-
portant. Financial analyses are used to first of all 
improve cash flow, and secondly, they are used to 
reschedule debt, reduce expenses, reduce costs, 
and scale back operations. All seven analyses are pre-
pared into reports and their contents are typically as 
follows (Fredenberger, Lipp & Watson, 1997):

 Financial Analyses: Balance statements & income 
statements.

 Working-Capital Analyses: Cash-flow statements 
(daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly); accounts 
receivable sales/collection/aging analyses; notes 
receivable aging analyses; inventory turnover, on-
hand, sales per day, ABC analyses; accounts pay-
able aging analyses; notes payable aging analyses; 
secured debt analyses; lender availability.

 Cost Analyses: Direct and indirect labor compen-
sation (monetary value and percentage of sales); 
product material cost (percentage of sales); product 
material cost per supplier (percentage of sales).

 Expense Analyses: Sales/marketing other expense 
(percentage of sales); finance/administration 
other expense (percentage of sales); engineering 
in-house/contract product-related expense (per-
centage of sales); warranty expense (percentage 
of sales).

 Personnel Analyses: Burden people-related vari-
able and fixed expense (percentage of sales); com-
pensation expense per direct and indirect labor 
employee; overtime premium expense per direct 
and indirect labor employee; sales/marketing 
people-related expense (percentage of sales); fi-
nance/administration 
people-related 
expense 
(percentage of sales); engineering in-house/con-
tract people-related expense (percentage of sales).

 Asset Analyses: Burden plant-related variable and 
fixed expense (percentage of sales); sales income 
per plant square foot; capacity utilization as a per-
centage of plant, equipment and machinery.

 Market Analyses: Product line gross margin as 
a percentage of profitability; product, model,

Turnaround managers face the challenge of gathering 
a lot of information as quickly as possible. As impor-
tant as it is to have the necessary information at the 
right time, many turnaround managers find that the 
information available to them is often not in a usable 
condition, and even when it is usable, it usually gets to 
the turnaround manager too late. When it comes to 
information, turnaround managers specifically have 
to deal with problems such as neglected information 
systems, inadequate or missing financial information, 
‘creative’ accounting, improper information formats, 
reports that are not matched to problems, and so on. 
Information is such a key part of any turnaround, that 
in order to resolve these kinds of information prob-
lems, some companies go to the extent of hiring expe-
rienced turnaround chief information officers (CIOs).
The lack of information faced by turnaround man-
agers can partly be attributed to a deliberate ploy on 
the part of employees, to either hold back informa-
tion, or to misinform the turnaround manager. This 
is often done out of fear, and it is therefore imperative 
that the turnaround manager quickly gains the trust 
of employees to prevent fear from arising, and to fa-
cilitate access to information. These can be achieved 
through effective collaboration with the human re-
sources department to ensure that the entire com-
pany buys into the turnaround process; that the em-
ployees are kept informed about what is happening 
throughout the turnaround; that the employees are 
constantly reminded of the strengths of the company; 
and that the employees are ultimately allocated jobs 
that make the best use of their skills and talents.
Strategy Formulation
Next during the crises stage, a turnaround manager 
would need to formulate a strategy to recover from 
the crises. The turnaround strategy will be based on 
the factors which led to the corporate decline, and for 
this reason, it is imperative that the problem which 
caused the underperformance be accurately identi-
fied. For instance, if a company has had a single large 
financial setback such as a legal settlement, fraud 
or embezzlement, the solution will be mainly finan-
cial. If a company is facing efficiency problems, the 
solution will be mainly operational. If the problem 
is to do with the reconfiguration of the firm’s port-
folio of businesses or the positioning of units within 
that portfolio, the solution will be mainly strategic. 
In general, however, the primary cause of company 
non-performance is some form of managerial incom-
petence, especially related to improper control of the 
internal elements of a company.
Once a turnaround manager has discovered the 
core reason for the underperformance, he or she 
would need to develop a strategic and operating 
plan. This is quite a challenging task, because the re-
vival of a declining company often calls for the im-
provement of operations, but under decline condi-
tions, a company can hardly invest in the necessary 
plant and equipment. This weakness affords the com-
pany the opportunity to fully utilize its creative ability 
through initiatives like extended targets and sugges-
tion forums. Creative negotiations with financial in-
stitutions will also support the financial management 
undertaken during the crises.
The strategic and operating plan may include de-
tails of the following actions:

 Retrenchment, which may involve all or some of 
the following:
• The reduction of expenses;
• The reduction of receivables;
• The reduction of inventory levels;
• The reduction of personnel.
 Raising the necessary capital, through means such as:
• Lenders (for example, banks and finance 
companies);
• Equity capital from turnaround investors and 
strategic acquirers;
• Asset sales;
• Bankruptcy reorganization.

 Management of the external stakeholders, in-
cluding, for example:
• Joint cost reductions with suppliers;
• Improved trade credit;
• New strategic partnerships with suppliers;
• Change in distribution channels;
• Outsourcing of inefficient processes.

Principles of Business: Management

243

 Management of the internal climate through such 
means as:
• Management of the decision processes;
• Transformation of organizational structures;
• Formalization of control structures;
• Restructuring of lines of communication.

 Process improvement, which may result in quality 
improvement and improved productivity; as well 
as a reduction in expenses and inventory invest-
ment.

 Continuous improvement based on market needs.

 Strategic pricing for certain customers, where pos-
sible.
Stabilization Stage
Once the turnaround manger has decided on the 
best strategy to implement, he or she must take ac-
tion to address the crises. At the point when cash in-
flows are at least equal to or greater than cash out-
flows, the crises would have passed, and it can be 
said that the company has reached the stabilization 
stage (also known as renewal). This second stage of 
the turnaround process calls for operational action 
to bring about profits. At this stage, the turnaround 
manager endeavors to motivate the company and 
allow it to become profitable and grow.
Depending on the circumstances and the turn-
around manager’s leadership qualities, a turnaround 
manager can stabilize and motivate a company by 
either exercising authoritarian leadership to get 
employees to follow a highly structured turnaround 
plan; or by empowering employees. Employee em-
powerment in a turnaround situation involves in-
verting the organization, practicing team-based 
problem-solving with cross-functional teams, putting 
in place a simple reporting structure, supporting se-
nior management and corporate staff, setting mea-
surable customer-driven goals for the entire organi-
zation, and measuring results.
Recovery Stage
The third and final stage of the turnaround process 
is recovery, also termed the expansion stage. This 
stage calls for strategic action to bring about a return 
to normal profits and growth. A turnaround manager 
can achieve growth through improved performance 
by selling more units of a company’s product; by 
adding more products to its range; by raising prices; 
and/or by reducing fixed and variable expenses. The 
achievement of growth, however, should not be an 
end in itself — the ultimate aim of a turnaround is 
to strengthen the company’s position so that it will 
not fall back into a loss situation. At this stage, a turn-
around manager will typically leave for the next as-
signment, possibly helping the owners of the company 
to hire a professional manager, before departing.
Issues
Turnaround management differs from country to 
country, and this is so because of variations in cul-
ture, institutional factors, commercial practices, and 
other environmental factors. The actions of individ-
uals and organizations — including managers and 
employees — toward any given activity are largely 
determined by institutional factors such as culture. 
For instance, cultural differences can account for dif-
ferences in the rate of recognition of company de-
cline; differences in the speed of initiating or starting 
a turnaround effort; and so on. In some countries, 
due to the prevailing culture, it is extremely difficult 
to get a CEO to agree to step down for a turnaround 
consultant to take over.
In the West, top management typically has suf-
ficient autonomy to make the necessary changes 
and cutbacks during a turnaround, but in some 
developing countries there may be significant con-
straints on managerial action, or there may be con-
flicting stakeholder priorities posing obstacles to a 
turnaround.
No matter the cultural setting, for a turnaround ef-
fort to have any chance of success, it must be adapted 
to suit the local setting.

Managing Inter-Firm Alliances
ABSTRACT
Companies may engage in inter-firm alliances in 
order to obtain something of value. The specific 
value may be financial, expertise or market position. 
Alliances can be formal or informal and can be short 
or long term. Some companies are looking for a long 
term partner and may engage in joint ventures in 
order to boost their qualifications for certain types 
of business. Meanwhile, others are looking for an 
informal partnership for the purpose of joint mar­
keting. Some companies will acquire various entities 
to create a certain position in the market. The biggest 
management challenge in setting up an alliance with 
another firm is upfront planning. Advanced plan­
ning can be used to anticipate possible obstacles to 
effective alliances. Some of these obstacles can be in 
the sharing of information and staff, which entities 
will shoulder the financial burden, or how the finan­
cial burden will be distributed.
OVERVIEW
Companies may turn to inter-firm alliances for many 
reasons. These alliances may be formal or informal 
but in some way provide benefits for the parties

involved. Some of the inter-alliances may be in the 
form of formal and legal partnerships and joint ven­
tures. Companies may also align through merger 
and acquisition activity. Companies that are depen­
dent on each other such as suppliers in an automo­
bile manufacturer’s supply chain may find value in 
alliances. Pietras and Stormer (2001, p.9) described 
strategic alliances as “a way for companies with com­
plementary strengths to enter a given market more 
effectively and efficiently than either alliance partner 
could manage alone.” Alliances can be a way for com­
panies to avoid risk due to unforeseen factors, tech­
nology or market risk (Vaidya, 2011).
Dyer, Kale, and Singh (2001) called strategic alli­
ances “a fast and flexible way to access complemen­
tary resources and skills that reside in other compa­
nies — an important tool for achieving sustainable 
competitive advantage.” These benefits and others 
could explain why so many companies engage in alli­
ances of all kinds. Dyer et al (2001, p.37) noted that 
“the top 500 global businesses have an average of 60 
major strategic alliances each.” However, about half 
of strategic alliances fail.
Reasons for Alliances
Best Practices
Alliances can take place because one company may 
have technology that another needs or may have 
demonstrated best practices in an area that can 
save a company money. For example, many online 
companies align themselves with specific shipping 
companies such as FedEx or UPS because these com­
panies have demonstrated expertise in shipping. 
Online companies that sell merchandise that must 
be shipped may be experts in their business but may 
not be experts in the best and most efficient ways 
to ship. Similarly, online giant Amazon.com has be­
come proficient in selling online and has built cred­
ibility online. The Amazon.com marketplace allows 
vendors to align themselves with Amazon.com using 
the online giant’s proven system for getting cus­
tomers, selling products and delivering those prod­
ucts quickly. Amazon.com has also proven that it 
knows how to protect customer personal information 
online. Many online shoppers are reluctant to shop 
with a company they have not done business with be­
fore. However, Amazon.com has set up a system for 
tracking orders and allows customers to access its 
customer service system if there are problems with 
an order sold through Amazon.com by a market­
place vendor.
Alliances can help companies get a product to 
market faster. One company may partner with an­
other company with research and development 
expertise. Or, companies that are working in the 
same area of product development may pool their 
resources to complete a better product faster. Some 
products cross different fields making it important to 
find partners in the different industries needed. For 
example, a computer company might partner with a 
telecommunications company on a phone product 
with computer capabilities.
Mutual Benefit
Alliances usually take place because one firm has 
something that another wants and jointly they can 
create opportunities for all parties involved (Mitchell 
& Canel, 2013). For example, a small company may 
offer a service but may need help in getting the 
word out about that service. The small company 
may partner with a well-known company that offers 
a similar service or even a different one. This type 
of alliance may only be needed for a short period of 
time. A company may develop a self-improvement 
product or service and may need to generate leads. 
The company may be aware that companies like 
Stephen Covey’s CoveyLink.com or Donald Trump’s 
TrumpUniversity.com attract people interested in 
self-improvement. The smaller company may align 
themselves with these giants in self-improvement 
to be positioned to target a large audience without 
having to build that list on its own. The larger com­
pany may benefit by being able to offer another 
product that someone else created giving customers 
another reason to visit the company website.
Problem Solving
Sometimes alliances are formed to solve the joint 
problems that groups of companies share. For ex­
ample, small manufacturers in the U.S. may form 
an alliance to address manufacturing competition 
from China. The companies in this type of alliance 
may work together to share ideas or even partner by 
trying to open up facilities overseas where appro­
priate. These companies could coalesce to identify 
joint purchasing opportunities or determine how 
they might lobby the government as a group to re­
ceive assistance. Similarly, technology vendors may 

Principles of Business: Management
Managing Inter-Firm Alliances
247
form an alliance to ensure that technology is devel­
oped around open standards to ensure that prod­
ucts are compatible. If companies make a product 
that is far ahead of the competition but not compat­
ible with the hardware, software and equipment that 
customers currently own, the advanced products are 
not very useful. The technology cemetery is loaded 
with very advanced but proprietary hardware and 
software that ended up failing because of the lack 
of interoperability and compliance with other prod­
ucts in use.
Alliance Organization
A non-profit organization called the Quoted 
Companies Alliance advocates for small compa­
nies listed in the United Kingdom (Binham, 2006). 
Companies might join an alliance like this to have 
a unified voice to represent their interests. Alliance 
groups like this one will only be successful as long as 
they stay in touch with the real needs of their mem­
bership. Pietras and Stormer (2001) give examples of 
strategic business alliances including “contracts, lim­
ited partnerships, general partnerships, or corporate 
joint ventures, or may take less formal forms, such 
as a referral network.” Alliances are relationships be­
tween companies for mutual benefit.
Management of Alliances
The management of alliances starts at the very be­
ginning of the relationship. Before the alliance is 
formalized, there is a need to do a great deal of plan­
ning and due diligence. Parties involved in the alli­
ance will likely also exchange information, financial 
and otherwise, as part of the vetting process. There 
may be a need to sign nondisclosure agreements de­
pending on the depth of the relationship and what 
internal information will be shared. Each party must 
manage and analyze information and manage the de­
ployment of resources.
Alliances work when each side is able to get a re­
sult of value. Managing strategic alliances requires 
continual monitoring of the relationship to deter­
mine whether or not it is still effective. Collecting 
data on the cost of the alliance is also a factor in 
understanding if the alliance is useful. Evaluation at 
regular intervals will help the parties determine if the 
relationship should continue and if so, in what way. 
Keeping abreast of business activity in the industry 
and region can provide clues on which companies 
are engaging in strategic alliances and which compa­
nies may be ripe for that type of relationship.
Cisco Systems
Managing alliances can be tricky if the companies 
are in similar industries because a partner could 
also be partners with the competitor of their alliance 
partner. Careful thought must be given to this pos­
sibility up front and swift action will be needed as 
these situations arise. Cisco Systems is well known for 
products in the networking sector of the technology 
industry. Although Cisco has been successful, it still 
has ideas for expanding to other parts of the industry 
(Capron, 2013).
Cisco has entered the AON (Application-Oriented 
Networking) market by introducing products and by 
targeted merger and acquisition activity of at least ten 
companies per year in 2006 and 2007 (Manufacturing 
Business Technology, 2007). Cisco has a partnership 
with SAP to network enable enterprise applications. 
The partnership helps Cisco do what they do best 
(networking) while taking advantage of the reach 
that SAP has with enterprise customers. Companies 
like Cisco may also acquire companies to eliminate 
competition. The benefit to the acquired company is 
investment in the products and services offered and 
a means to take those products to market quickly to 
the automatically built Cisco customer base. It might 
take much longer for a smaller company to attract 
top tier clients which tend to be conservative in de­
ploying technology due to cost, implementation, 
roll-out and compatibility issues. Similarly, advances 
in research and development can be supported and 
taken farther by partnering with a company that has 
the financial and human resources to push develop­
ment forward.
A similar alliance between Cisco and SAP ended 
that allowed for co-branding and marketing of risk 
and compliance products. Cisco and SAP regularly 
enter into various types of partnerships likely because 
they have felt a level of trust and reaped benefits from 
their ongoing alliances. However, Cisco is engaged in 
a business partnership with IBM which owns a com­
pany that competes in the same area of a company 
that Cisco recently acquired. Within the technology 
industry, this is called co-opetition or a scenario in 
which these technology vendors realize that they will 
always have some overlap or competition with other 
technology vendors. But, as all try to expand their 

Managing Inter-Firm Alliances
Principles of Business: Management
248
reach and embrace new technology, these competi­
tors may have to work together as partners to ensure 
their mutual survival.
Companies seeking alliances should set specific 
goals and objectives for the alliance and always con­
sider the impact of time. Putting together an alliance 
could mean a partnership on a short project or it 
could mean a multi-year agreement. In the case of a 
merger, the partnership might exist forever. As a re­
sult, companies must protect themselves by getting as 
much information as possible up front and to engage 
in careful planning. In addition, company employees 
have to be prepared for the upheaval that might re­
sult from certain kinds of alliances. Dyer (2001) sug­
gested companies put a due diligence team in place 
to assess the suitability of potential alliance partners.
Viewpoint
The Value of Alliances
Time can cost companies money. The time it takes 
to develop products and services, the time it takes 
to train employees and the time it takes to acquire 
and convince customers to buy are all expensive. The 
value of an alliance can be the cost savings associated 
with time and catapulting a company into the next 
phase of development.
Strategic Alliance Processes
Dyer et al (2001) studied 200 businesses and found 
them engaged in 1572 alliances. A 1% rise in stock 
price was noted with the announcement of each al­
liance “which translated into an increase in market 
value of $54 million per alliance” (Dyer, 2001, p.37). 
Dyer et al also identified certain companies that were 
much more efficient at creating value than others 
such as HP, Oracle and Parke-Davis. These compa­
nies were extraordinarily successful because within 
their organizational structure was a dedicated stra­
tegic alliance function. The dedicated function can 
provide training to company employees to improve 
the internal capabilities of the firm to judge strategic 
alliances. Some companies provide intensive training 
for employees on alliances.
Successful alliance companies with units dedi­
cated to identifying and analyzing strategic alliance 
opportunities can be more successful because of an 
institutional strategy. Dyer (2001, p.38) reported that 
“Enterprises with a dedicated function achieved a 
25% higher long-term success rate” than companies 
engaging in alliances without an institutional ap­
proach. A dedicated strategic alliance function also 
helps companies become more familiar with the pro­
cess and increases the knowledge available internally 
to the firm about strategic alliances. Dedicated re­
sources can also spend the time needed to evaluate 
the progress and results of alliances. The increased 
knowledge helps companies devise strategies and tac­
tics for every part of the strategic alliance process.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has 
partnered with Alliance Imaging to deliver advanced 
technology for the treatment of cancer. The Medical 
Center reaps several benefits from the alliance. First, 
the center gets the opportunity to commercialize 
proven technology and resell the technology to hos­
pitals that don’t have advanced cancer technology. 
Second, the company only made a 20% financial in­
vestment but will receive 50% of the control (Becker, 
2006). In addition, the medical center has 16 hospi­
tals and 42 cancer centers so if has an opportunity 
to use and develop cancer treatments regularly. The 
partnership gives the hospital a distribution net­
work for their technology. The market for radiation 
therapy is said to be $20 billion and not all hospitals 
can afford the equipment.
Alliance Evaluation
Alliances have to be reevaluated periodically to de­
termine their relative value based on a company’s 
objectives. Hershey Candy ended a long term rela­
tionship with advertising and public relations giant 
Ogilvy & Mather. Instead, Hershey established a new 
relationship and chose to expand other relationships 
as a solution to new advertising problems. The pur­
pose of the change was to take a new direction and 
make changes that consumers might notice (Beirne, 
2005). The distinctions are needed based on the 
large number of new products Hershey produced. 
Some retailers have suggested that the constant in­
flux of new products is confusing to customers. 
Hershey must keep a critical eye on its market given 
that it spent a projected $580 million in advertising 
in 2013 alone (Schultz, 2013).
Sometimes alliances help companies penetrate a 
market quickly. HSBC North America partnered with 
Debitman Card, Inc. to serve a common customer 
base (Breitkopf, 2006). HSBC brings merchants to 
the table like Best Buy and HP while Debitman brings 
a payment network to process debit payments. The 

Principles of Business: Management
Managing Inter-Firm Alliances
249
value of this alliance is it allows all of the players in­
cluding HSBC who provides the credit card system 
for merchants, the retailers and Debitman to all con­
centrate on their core business area. Concentrating 
on a core business area is essential to success and ef­
ficiency. Partnering with those who are also experts in 
their lines of business can give companies access to ex­
pertise that would take a long time, money and effort 
to build. In addition, the largest retailer (Wal-Mart) 
only issues credit cards, not debit cards meaning that 
Debitman would have been shut out of Wal-Mart’s 
business (Breitkopf, 2006). Together, HSBC and 
Debitman are working to convince retailers about the 
additional revenue opportunities in the debit busi­
ness. The alliance can also help these strategic part­
ners to work jointly on common problems.
There are times when alliances of particular com­
panies affect entire industries. Examples can be seen 
in the automotive, telecommunications and retail 
sector. Becker (2005) reported on an merger be­
tween Alliance Medical Corporation and Vanguard 
Medical Concepts to consolidate two of the top three 
companies involved in the reprocessing of used med­
ical equipment for reuse. Hospitals used to perform 
this task themselves and soon outsourced to contract 
re-manufacturers. This action makes the two medical 
device re-manufacturers together the largest com­
pany performing these tasks. Since both companies 
had different customers and specialized in servicing 
different devices, they can now sell to each other’s 
customers and increase the revenues and demand as­
sociated with their products.
Alliance Need
Alliances should not be entered into simply because a 
company wants to be bigger or wants to prevent com­
petition. To find the real value means the companies 
involved must actually have a need. Geographic in­
terests are an example of a specific need for an al­
liance. Magnum Semiconductor is a semiconductor 
manufacturer based in California with a need to ex­
pand worldwide (Electronic News, 2006). Strategic 
alliances in foreign companies might involve finding 
local people to manage the company or setting up 
subsidiaries in the foreign country that would do 
business for the company. Other strategies if a com­
pany wants a presence in another country could be to 
align with distributers that are already set up allowing 
a company to capitalize on local country knowledge.
One of the greatest benefits of alliances is the 
ability to get more customers. More customers can 
come from taking a new view of your business and 
industry and to focus on the needs of these poten­
tial customers. A financial services company chose to 
partner with a pharmaceutical company to get more 
customers (Ramachandran, 2006). By partnering 
with a pharmaceutical company, a financial services 
firm has access to the names of physicians and others 
who might have financial service needs.
How to Make Strategic Alliances Work
There are as many ideas about making strategic al­
liances work as there are ways to construct them. 
However, any company interested in a strategic al­
liance will have to process a lot of information. 
Information can include data about the company, 
company interests and needs, industry players and 
dependent industries. Knowledge about other indus­
tries affected by a company’s industry or that in some 
way has impact on an industry can offer unique ideas 
for possible alliances. Customers can also be a source 
of key information and possible referrals to strategic 
alliance opportunities.
Harper (2001) suggested that companies should 
avoid jumping into strategic alliances too quickly 
in order to solve problems. Avoid strategic alliance 
failure requires being realistic from the beginning. 
Painting too rosy a picture could lead to great disap­
pointment. Disappointment can occur even if com­
panies are industry leaders and spend a great deal of 
time vetting each other. Different styles in manage­
ment, structure and methods may make it hard for 
different cultures to work together (Rooks, Snijders 
& Duysters, 2013). Harper (2001) outlined several 
important steps to help make strategic alliances work 
and provide win-win results for the parties involved. 
Using these steps makes it possible for companies to 
truly reap the benefits of lower costs, better market 
penetration, access to expertise or any other benefits 
they are looking to achieve.
To make strategic alliances work:

 Companies can make a careful assessment of the 
company goals for strategic alliances. This can 
mean looking internally at the needs and objec­
tives in order to create a picture of the right kind 
of strategic partner candidate. A company should 
also look at alliances from the perspective of all 

Managing Inter-Firm Alliances
Principles of Business: Management
250
stakeholders such as customers, employees and 
stockholders. A thorough look from these perspec­
tives will also help companies identify what factors 
of an alliance are most important and which, if 
not in place, will sabotage an alliance. Companies 
should also evaluate whether or not another action 
other than an alliance might make more sense or 
provide some value such as cost savings.

 Formulate an alliance strategy with the candidate 
before signing formal agreements. In this way, 
both can try out ideas and see how working to­
gether feels. A true alliance that is not a merger 
provides what Harper (2001, p.26) calls “equal 
power”; allowing each company to be indepen­
dent. Identification of the benefits for both must 
be compelling enough to balance out the effort 
and cost of working together. Both companies will 
have to share information about the strengths and 
weaknesses they bring to the table.

 Both sides of an alliance will have to contribute to 
making it work and have the ability to participate 
in making the alliance work from business devel­
opment to process improvement.

 Similarly, both companies have to be honest about 
the effect and performance of the alliance when 
evaluating success.
“Frequent milestones” are a tactic suggested to 
ensure that risk is low and that problems are easily 
identified and handled early (Harper, 2001, p.27). 
The continuous feedback and continuous learning 
approach will make certain that the relationship be­
tween the alliance members is constantly improving.

ABSTRACT
This article focuses on managing pure risk. It pro­
vides an overview of the main approaches and chal­
lenges to managing the pure risks associated with 
and resulting from business operations and market 
activity. Topics of discussion include pure risk man­
agement strategies, operational risk, market risk, and 
formal risk disclosure requirements. This section 
serves as a foundation for a discussion of the issues 
associated with pure risk transfer and terrorism catas­
trophe bonds.

Managing Pure Risks: Operation & Markets
Principles of Business: Management

OVERVIEW
Corporate risk can be divided into the two broad cat­
egories of pure risk and speculative risk. Pure risk ex­
clusively involves the potential for loss and no poten­
tial for profit. The occurrence of pure risk cannot be 
controlled nor reliably predicted. Examples of pure 
risk include terrorism, fire, death of key employees, 
customer injuries on the premises of the business, 
and natural hazards such as earthquakes and hurri­
canes. Pure risk can devastate a company. In contrast, 
speculative risk involves the equal chance of making 
a profit or taking a loss.
There is debate within the corporate world about 
how pure and speculative risks should be managed. 
Risk management refers to the process of evaluating, 
classifying, and reducing risks to a level acceptable 
by stakeholders. Risk management tactics include 
risk avoidance risk transfer, risk reduction and risk as­
sumption. Since the emergence of risk management 
in the 1960s, corporations have created strategies for 
managing the pure risks associated with scientific re­
search, market fluctuations, operations, engineering 
inventions, computer systems, and liability (Barlow, 
1993). There is a tendency in many corporations 
to combine pure risk management and speculative 
risk management into the same program and initia­
tives. These corporations base this decision to have a 
widely-applied risk management approach on the be­
lief that corporate risk represents a single exposure 
to the corporation. In practice, managing pure and 
speculative risk requires two very different skill sets.
Pure risk management involves minimizing nega­
tive outcomes by avoiding losses and accidents and 
preparing for natural and man-made disasters and 
catastrophes. Speculative risk management involves 
working to achieve the best passive results for events 
beyond the company’s control (Lansdale, 1997). 
Speculative risk, which can be used to create profit 
and is also referred to as financial risk, is the do­
main of corporate managers, company owners, and 
the board of directors; pure risk, with no potential 
to bring profit, growth, or increased performance 
to the firm, is the domain of risk managers (Vann, 
1990). Pure risk is assessed and managed almost ex­
clusively by risk mangers. Pure risk managers plan for 
eventualities never knowing if or when the pure risk 
scenario will occur.
Corporations choosing to handle risk through a 
unified management strategy rather than separate 
pure risk and speculative risk strategies are con­
tinuing the industry’s practice of the last forty years. 
While corporate insurance dates back to the nine­
teenth century, the practice of risk management, 
characterized as a singular approach to business risk, 
did not emerge until the 1960s and was not widely ad­
opted until the 1980s. The 1980s were characterized 
by increasing government regulations, a growing 
economy, and insurance crisis. The federal govern­
ment passed laws, such as the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, 
and Superfund legislation, which required corporate 
compliance. Corporations created new positions, 
such as risk manager, to address liability, safety, and 
environmental compliance issues. In addition, the 
business-boom of the mid 1980s, characterized by an 
increase in production plants, business locations, op­
erations and workers, required new types and larger 
amounts of insurance. Companies demanded more 
insurance options and coverage from their insurers 
and insurance companies balked at the demands. 
Companies struggled both with financing their in­
creasing insurance needs and finding insurance poli­
cies that met the needs of their expanding businesses. 
Corporations increasingly hired risk managers to as­
sess their risks and select the best insurance options 
for their expanding businesses (Englehart, 1994).
Over the last ten years, insurance companies, in re­
sponse to the of events such as the September 11, 2001 
attacks on the World Trade Center, the collapse of the 
Enron Corporation and the unstable global geopo­
litical risk, are increasingly unwilling or unable to in­
sure pure risk. Insurance companies are increasingly 
requiring shared risk scenarios with corporations and 
governments. Clearly, the current business and polit­
ical environment is creating a greater divide between 
pure risk and speculative risk than ever existed before. 
While firms face the potential for numerous types of 
pure risk, within the areas of operational risks, market 
risks, cultural risks, economic risks, political risks and 
credit risks, pure risk managers are possibly most chal­
lenged by the need to manage operational risk and 
market risk. The pure risks associated with operations 
and market behavior, along with pure risks in general, 
are characterized by their unpredictability and poten­
tial to create devastating losses.

The following section provides an overview of the 
main approaches used to manage the pure risks as­
sociated with and resulting from business operations 
and market activity. Topics of discussion include 
formal management approaches, operational risk, 
market risk, and risk disclosure requirements. This 
section will serve as a foundation for a discussion of 
the issues associated with pure risk transfer and ter­
rorism catastrophe bonds.
APPLICATIONS
Managing Operational & Market Risk
Pure risk managers are responsible for assessing, 
anticipating, minimizing, and mitigating the pure 
risks associated with operations and market activity. 
Like all pure risks, the pure risks associated with op­
erations and market activities are always unexpected, 
negative, and destructive. Pure risk managers de­
velop response scenarios and prepare their organiza­
tions for surviving pure risk situations such as fire, 
terrorism, death of key employees, customer injuries 
on the premises of the business, and natural hazards 
such as earthquakes and hurricanes.
Operational Risk
Operational risk refers to the financial losses that 
could potentially result from either internal proce­
dural failures or external affairs. Examples of opera­
tional risk include the following: Procedural errors; 
internal control failures; failure of information pro­
cessing equipment; malicious or fraudulent actions 
by individuals; workplace safety issues; succession fail­
ures; unintentional failures to protect clients; damage 
to physical assets; failures to follow regulations; busi­
ness disruptions including terrorism and vandalism; 
computer and network crashes; service or product 
quality lapses; fraud; failure to comply with regula­
tions or company policies; shifting political land­
scapes; and other unpredictable events (Beans, 2003, 
p.22). Operational risk is created by multiple factors 
including overly complex production processes; over-
engineered products; too many vendors; complex or 
unclear organizational structures; and fragmented fi­
nancial or control systems (Lynn, 2006). The results of 
operational risks can be potentially far-reaching and 
devastating for firms of all sizes and in all industries. 
Regulators and corporations have struggled since the 
1990s to come to a consensus on the definition and 
meaning of operational risk. Firms of all sizes and 
in all industries struggle to decide the best means 
to allocate capital for managing operational risk 
and determine what role the board of directors has 
in assessing and managing operational risk. While a 
working definition of operation exists across indus­
tries, operational risks vary significantly between dif­
ferent industries and sectors (Garver, 2006).
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has 
led the way in the effort to define operational risk 
and develop tactics for management of operational 
risk. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
has issued two international accords or international 
agreements, Basel I in 1988 and Basel II in 2004, 
which have standardized corporate perception of and 
management of operational risk. The Basel Accords 
have been widely adopted by regulatory commis­
sions around the world. In the United States, the 
main federal banking agencies, including the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal 
Reserve System, the Office of Thrift Supervision, 
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
have revised and implemented the Basal II Accord. 
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision re­
ported that the most serious operational risks arise 
from breakdowns in internal controls and corporate 
governance. Operational risk, according to the Basel 
Committee, can also be caused by failures of informa­
tion technology systems or events such as major fires 
or other disasters (Aerts, 2001).
The Basel II Accord, officially titled the 
International Convergence of Capital Measurement 
and Capital Standards, promotes three approaches 
to quantifying operational risk:
1.	 The first is a basic indicator approach based on 
the annual revenue of the institution
2.	 The second is a standardized approach based on 
the annual revenue of each broad business lines 
institution
3.	 The third is advanced analytical approached based 
on an internal risk measurement framework.
U.S. firms, under pressure from the Basel II 
Accord requirements and the federal Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act, are increasingly revamping their organizations to 
handle operational risks. The operational risk man­
agement framework generally includes identification, 
measurement, monitoring, reporting, control and

Principles of Business: Management
254
mitigation frameworks (Garver, 2006). Creating a 
framework for operational risk requires defining op­
erational risk. More and more companies and coun­
tries are adopting the Basel Committee’s definition 
of operational risk. That said, operational risk frame­
works are not wholly general to all firms and indus­
tries. For example, the banking industry has unique 
needs, investment tools, and objectives and cannot 
adopt the operational risk frameworks of large corpo­
rations in other industries such as manufacturing or 
real estate. In the banking industry, operational risk 
often overlaps with credit risk and interest-rate risk.
Operational Risk Manager’s & Management
Operational risk managers are responsible for an­
ticipating, minimizing, mitigating, and preparing 
for operational risk. Operational risk managers work 
to minimize operational risk through engaging in 
the following risk management strategies: Foster a 
culture of risk awareness throughout the organiza­
tion; back up all data, information, and procedures; 
practice contingency plans; take time to get to know 
customers; understand the firm’s products; visit all 
branches and offices of the firm; and streamline and 
optimize all processes (Beans, 2003). Operational 
risk managers mitigate operational risk through the 
use of multiple strategies including: Looking and 
planning for the unexpected; instituting quality con­
trol programs; evaluating financial processes and 
transactions as if they were manufacturing processes, 
adopting internal performance metrics such as cus­
tomer-oriented metrics, product oriented metrics, 
and financial oriented metrics; aligning insurance 
closely with the desired unit of value; and training for 
the unexpected. Operational risk managers prepare 
for operational risk through the use of multiple strat­
egies including adopting the mindset of production 
managers with a concern for reducing defects in the 
products they produce for their customers; evalu­
ating low frequency but high value risk/return trad­
eoffs; and increasing resources devoted to training, 
communication, and teamwork. Increased training, 
especially cross training, increases the likelihood that 
individuals throughout the organization remain alert 
for sources of defects or risk.
Ultimately, operational risk management is impor­
tant for numerous reasons. For example, companies 
that experience fraud, errors, and systems failures 
are generally granted less capital by their financial 
lenders and become less competitive in the market­
place over time. In addition, companies that experi­
ence fraud, errors, and systems failures generally do 
not garner customer, employee, and vendor trust 
and develop a negative reputation in their industry 
or business sector (Lynn, 2006).
Market Risk
Market risk refers to exposure to the uncertain market 
value of a portfolio. Investors experience market risk 
as a result of the fluctuations in securities prices. 
Market risk extends to entire classes of assets or liabil­
ities. Pure risk managers assess market risk through 
value-at-risk analysis. Value-at-risk analysis refers to a 
measure of how the market value of an asset or of a 
portfolio of assets is likely to decrease over a certain 
time period under usual conditions. Market risk an­
ticipates the value or amount that an investment will 
decrease due to changes in market factors. The main 
factors, source, or variables effecting market risk in­
clude the following: Equity risk, equity index risk, in­
terest rate risk, currency risk, commodity risk, unan­
ticipated inflation and exchange rate change, decline 
in customer buying habits, and a shrinking market.
The United States government has strict corporate 
market risk reporting requirements. The Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that all 
corporations include a 10-K form in their annual re­
ports describing the ways in which their own results 
may depend directly on financial markets. The SEC re­
quires this reporting practice as a means of consumer 
protection for current or potential investors. In 2005, 
the Securities and Exchange Commission issued new 
corporate risk reporting and disclosure requirements. 
The SEC requires reporting on risk factors in three 
main categories of market behavior including industry 
risks, company risks, and investment risks. The SEC’s 
new corporate risk reporting requirements, as rep­
resented by changes to annual report requirements 
on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, 
further the SEC’s commitment to integrating corpo­
rate disclosure and processes first described in the 
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934. Corporations must now disclose risk factors 
in their annual reports and describe changes in previ­
ously disclosed risk factors in their quarterly reports. 
Risk factors are believed to present a summary of the 
risks facing the company and identify factors that in­
vestors should consider when making an investment.

The SEC’s new corporate risk disclosure require­
ment, as described in Item 503(c) of Regulation S-K, 
instructs that, when appropriate, a company has to 
engage in a discussion regarding the most important 
factors that may negatively affect the issuer’s business, 
operations, industry, financial position or its future 
financial performance. The SEC argues that the new 
reporting requirements should not be burdensome 
as the SEC noted that companies should already be 
in a position to recognize new or changing material 
risks affecting their businesses. The SEC argues that 
disclosure of risk factors will alert investors to risks 
specific to the company or its industry that make an 
offering speculative or high risk.
The SEC requires, as stated in Rule 421 (d) of 
Regulation C, that the risk factors section of annual 
and quarterly reports be written using plain English 
principles. The SEC specifies six basic plain English 
principles that must be followed when drafting and 
explaining corporate risk factors: Short sentences; 
definite, concrete, everyday words; active voice; ta­
bles or bullet point lists, whenever possible; no legal 
jargon and highly technical business terms; and no 
multiple negatives. The SEC’s plain English require­
ments are intended to make the risk factors easier for 
investors to understand. Ultimately, the SEC reports 
that the new risk disclosure requirements should 
help rather than hinder corporations. The disclo­
sure of market risks limits the future liability of the 
company should such a market loss occur (Robbins 
& Rothenberg, 2005). In addition to the SEC market 
risk disclosure requirement, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 
passed in 2002 in response to corporate auditing 
scandal, requires that corporations engage in risk 
assessment and risk auditing to monitor its finan­
cial reporting and auditing processes. Section 404 of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which focuses on manage­
ment’s assessment of internal control over financial 
reporting, instructs corporations to conduct a top-
down market risk assessment to evaluate the corpora­
tion’s internal controls systems (Banham, 2004).
Issues
Pure Risk Shifting & Terrorism Catastrophe Bonds
Risk philosophy refers to a predetermined goal 
concerning the allocation of risk. Two of the most 
common risk philosophies are risk sharing and risk 
shifting. In the case of pure risk, risk shifting or risk 
transfer involves causing the other contracting party 
to sustain the full consequences of unanticipated 
events. In contrast, pure risk sharing occurs when an 
owner is willing to assume the risk of increased costs 
in the future caused by unanticipated events in ex­
change for a contract price today. Corporations and 
risk managers choose their risk philosophy based on 
their appetite for and ability to finance risk (Kozek 
& Hebberd, 1989). Catastrophe bonds, also referred 
to as cat bonds, are an example and increasingly 
common form of pure risk shifting. Traditionally, ca­
tastrophe bonds have been used to transfer the pure 
risk of natural disasters like hurricanes, storms, and 
earthquakes. Following the September 11, 2001 at­
tacks on the World Trade Center, catastrophe bonds 
that transfer the pure risk of a manmade disaster have 
become common. Recent economic and political 
events, such as September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks 
and the collapse of the Enron Corporation, have 
brought a new awareness of pure risk and exposure 
to corporations around the world. More businesses 
are employing pure risk management strategies and 
tools to address this new awareness of corporate risk 
and vulnerability.
The Fédération Internationale de Football 
Association (FIFA), soccer’s international governing 
body, issued the first terrorism catastrophe bond in 
2003. The Fédération Internationale de Football 
Association issued a catastrophe bond worth an 
equivalent $260 million to cover the risk of a ter­
rorism related cancellation of the World Cup 2006 
in Germany. The bond covered the marketing rev­
enue that the Fédération Internationale de Football 
Association would have to refund if the matches were 
cancelled due to natural or terrorist related catas­
trophe. The Fédération Internationale de Football 
Association earns most of its revenue from World Cup 
Soccer. The Fédération Internationale de Football 
Association based its decision to create the bond on a 
risk analysis in the form of an extensive model of po­
tential terrorism-related pathways to FIFA World Cup 
disruption and cancellation. The bond’s scheduled 
maturity was September 2006. The 2006 World Cup 
did in fact happen as planned and was unmarked by 
terrorist acts. Since the FIFA terrorism catastrophe 
bond was issued in 2003, terrorism catastrophe in­
surance, as a form of pure risk insurance, has grown 
extremely popular. The demand for terrorism ca­
tastrophe bonds is so great that they are often over­
subscribed. The current geopolitical environment 

Managing Pure Risks: Operation & Markets

is currently so unstable that few insurers or compa­
nies can or will finance the pure terrorism risk alone. 
Insurers and companies use terrorism catastrophe 
bonds as one form of pure risk shifting (Trot & 
Jenkins, 2003).
CONCLUSION
In the final analysis, managing pure risk requires a 
thorough knowledge of the relevant workings of 
business and industry as well as an awareness of dan­
gers to the business posed from real-world political 
and environmental events. Pure risk managers must 
oversee loss and risk associated with people, prop­
erty, liabilities, and finance. Examples of pure risks 
include bomb explosions, fire, windstorm damage, 
theft, fraud, environmental pollution, an employee 
accident, an employee illness, loss of a key manage­
ment figure, exposure to liabilities, or loss of market 
share for product. Pure risk managers create a frame­
work within which firms can absorb the results of 
pure risk scenarios. A pure risk management frame­
work will include the coordination and monitoring 
of risk preparedness and response scenarios and ac­
tivities as well as an overall statement of the firm’s risk 
management philosophy (Cooper, 1993).

Managing the Process of Innovation
ABSTRACT
This article will focus on managing the process of in­
novation. The article will provide an overview of the 
main types of innovation found in organizations, in­
cluding incremental and breakthrough innovation, 
the trajectory of innovation, barriers to innovation, 
and the history of private and public sector innovation. 
This overview will serve as a foundation for discussion 
of managing the innovation process. The issues associ­
ated with managing breakthrough innovation will be 
addressed. A case study of Boeing’s formalized innova­
tion program will be in included. The case study will 
provide an example of how a company can effectively 
manage the innovation process on an extremely large 
scale and the ways in which successful innovation cre­
ates competitive advantage in the marketplace.
OVERVIEW
There is an established relationship between busi­
ness strategy, innovation, and organizational per­
formance. Innovation, which refers to the use of a 
new product, service, or method in business practice 
immediately subsequent to its discovery, influences 
economic success and market share in increasingly 
competitive global markets. In response to new 
technology-driven global markets, companies have 
increased their use of advanced technologies as well 
as their innovation efforts (Zahra, 1993). Innovation 
is associated with competitive advantage in both 
growing and mature markets. Innovation, unlike most 
other business practices, can change the competi­
tive balance in mature markets (Brown, 1992). The 
concept and practice of innovation became closely 
associated with economic gain and competitive ad­
vantage in the 1930s. In the 1930s, economist Joseph 
Schumpeter (1883-1950) created a theory of eco­
nomic development based on five types of economic 
innovations: set up or discovery of a new product, a 
new manufacturing process, a new market, source or 
new organization (Leteneyei, 2001). Contemporary 
business theory argues that companies must compete 
to keep or gain market share. Innovation is consid­
ered to be the key to creating competitive advantage 
(Stalk, 2006).

The following sections will provide an overview of 
the main types of innovation found in organizations, 
the trajectory of innovation, barriers to innovation, 
and the history of private and public sector inno­
vation. This overview will serve as a foundation for 
discussion of managing the innovation process. The 
issues associated with managing breakthrough inno­
vation will be addressed. A case study of Boeing’s for­
malized innovation program will be in included. The 
case study will provide an example of how a company 
can effectively manage the innovation process on an 
extremely large scale.
Types of Innovation
Numerous types of innovation occur in organiza­
tions. Examples include marketing innovation, tech­
nological innovation, organizational innovation, 
product innovation, service innovation, and process 
innovation.

 Marketing Innovation: Marketing innovation refers 
to a process in which people gradually become fa­
miliar and accepting of a new idea. Marketing in­
novation is a social learning process that results 
in consumers slowly changing their attitudes and 
values. Market innovations are often technologi­
cally driven. When a technology is developed, the 
new technology is often in need of a new type of 
market application. Market innovation is based on 
the following assumptions: Innovation is driven by a 
learning process within social groups; some individ­
uals have a higher propensity to try innovative prod­
ucts than others; and the speed of adoption may 
vary from one business to another (Brown, 1992).

 Technological Innovation: Technological inno­
vation is the process by which industry generates 
new and improved products and production pro­
cesses. Technological innovation includes activi­
ties ranging from the generation of an idea, re­
search, development and commercialization to 
the diffusion throughout the economy of new and 
improved products, processes and services. Effec­
tive technological innovation includes either the 
diffusion process or the spread of the innovation 
commercially (Zairi, 1992). Technological innova­
tion requires and is followed by new technology 
exploitation. New technology exploitation (NTE) 
refers to the utilization of new technology or scien­
tific developments to improve the performance of 
products or manufacturing processes. The failure 
of management to recognize and manage break­
through technology innovation often results in 
organizational inefficiencies and frustration (Big­
wood, 2004).

 Organizational Innovation: Organizational inno­
vation can be defined as the process of changing 
the organization by introducing different methods 
of production or administration. Organizational 
innovation includes the adoption of ideas from 
outside the organization and the generation of 
ideas within. Organizational innovation involves 
planning initiation, execution, selection, and im­
plementation (Spender & Kessler, 1995).

 Product Innovation: Product innovation involves 
the introduction of a good that is new or substan­
tially improved.

 Service Innovation: Service innovation involves 
the introduction of a service that is new or sub­
stantially improved.

 Process Innovation: Process innovation involves 
the implementation of a new or significantly im­
proved production or delivery method.
All of the innovation types described above has ele­
ments and trajectories in common. There are two main 
approaches to innovation that span and characterize 
all innovation processes: incremental and disruptive 
innovation. Incremental innovation refers to improve­
ment of technology performance or product feature 
enhancement. Breakthrough innovation, also referred 
to as disruptive, radical, or discontinuous innovation, 
refers to innovation based on technologies previously 
new to the world. These two different types of innova­
tion have separate development trajectories and associ­
ated management strategies (Hacklin, 2005).
The Trajectory of Innovation
The trajectory of innovation is most often conceived 
of as an s-shape pattern with three distinct levels of 
diffusion and adoption of the innovation. For ex­
ample, the s-curve for technology innovation in­
cludes three main phases (Hacklin, 2005):

 Pacemaker Technology Phase: Emerging tech­
nology is called a pacemaker technology as it is 
new to the world and the future potential and ap­
plications are identified. The diffusion of the inno­
vative technology has not yet started in this phase.

Principles of Business: Management
Managing the Process of Innovation
259

 Disruptive Technology Phase: Established tech­
nology evolves into disruptive technology when it 
has managed to outperform competing technolo­
gies in respective mainstream markets. The diffu­
sion of the innovative technology is occurring at a 
rapid pace in this phase.

 Key Technology Phase: The performance of the 
technology becomes more efficient and the tech­
nology become widely-adopted by the customer 
base. The diffusion of the innovative technology 
is complete in this phase. The innovative tech­
nology, if successful, has saturated its market and 
become ubiquitous technology among its users.
Organizational Barriers to Innovation
Innovation, which requires active learning, risk-
taking, insight and vision, does not occur in every 
firm. Common organizational barriers to innovation 
include (Brown, 1992):

 A heavy reliance on market research to minimize 
risk when drawing up and approving plans for new 
products.

 The use of financial techniques, such as risk mini­
mization, to assess innovation projects that are in­
herently risky.

 A tendency to invest in and rely on what has served 
the company well in the past rather than what may 
serve it better in the future.

 Systems of rewards and promotion that encourage 
a low-risk, custodial approach to management 
rather than a high-risk management approach.
History of Private & Public Sector Innovation
Innovation in the twentieth century was charac­
terized by public and private sector partnerships 
and relationships. The private and public sectors 
significantly influence one another’s innovation 
processes. The relationship between public and 
private sector innovation became very close during 
the Cold War from the 1940s until the early 1990s. 
After World War II, and during the Cold War era, 
publicly-funded science and technology research, 
development, and innovation grew for three main 
reasons: First, science and technology research was 
fueled by the belief in the need for strong national 
defense technologies. Second, science and tech­
nology research was fueled by the belief that scien­
tific research, which had delivered nuclear weapons, 
antibiotics, and jet aircraft, would produce other in­
novations of national interest. Third, science and 
technology research was fueled by the belief that a 
large national science system was perceived by other 
countries as representative of national prestige and 
cultural achievement.
Cold War era, science and technology research and 
innovation, motivated by concerns for national de­
fense more than economic growth, produced many of 
the university research and laboratory programs, gov­
ernment laboratories, and other technical institutes 
such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA). The United States, along with other coun­
tries such as Canada, Australia, Great Britain, France 
and Switzerland, invested in significant national sci­
entific infrastructures during the Cold War years (de 
la mothe & Dufour, 1995). Cold War-era defense-re­
lated spending resulted in the development of such 
high-technology industries as semiconductors, com­
puters, and commercial aircraft.
During the 1980s and 1990s, private sector science 
and technology development and innovation grew 
and defense-related, military research and innova­
tion slowed. In contrast to the pattern of the previous 
five decades, technological development began to 
flow from civilian to military applications. In 2000, 
the Clinton administration reduced the role of de­
fense-related research and design funding in U.S. 
technology policy. Instead, the Clinton administra­
tion focused resources and policies on commercial 
technology research, development, innovation, pro­
curement, and adoption (Ham, 1995). The largest 
high-tech private sector innovators will remain tied 
to the public sector for two main reasons: First, the 
public sector, including the military, remains one of 
the main customers of high-tech innovators. Second, 
the public sector has the funds available for public-
private partnered and cooperative research and de­
velopment programs.
APPLICATIONS
Managing the Innovation Process
The success of an innovation is connected to a market 
forecast of customer needs and wants as well as effec­
tive management of the innovation process. Firms 
have numerous economic tools and approaches 
for successfully developing a market and customer 

Managing the Process of Innovation
Principles of Business: Management

forecasts but are only recently, in the last two decades, 
developing and articulating management practices 
for the innovation process. While firms may or may 
not institute a formalized innovation policy and pro­
cedure to guide employees and mangers, there are 
a set of principles that guide the innovation process 
across businesses and industries:

 Innovations should meet customer needs, please 
shareholders, and motivate staff.

 Innovation requires vision to drive the change 
process.

 Innovation requires a risk-tolerant environment.

 Innovation requires a lifelong learning orienta­
tion that involves all members of the organization.

 Innovation requires creative thinking in a diverse 
and information-rich organizational environment.

 Innovation requires a cross-functional systems per­
spective for analyzing the impact of change and 
overseeing implementation.
Managers of the innovation process address nu­
merous issues within the organization to ensure 
successful development and implementation of an 
innovation. The main innovation management re­
sponsibilities include reducing the sense of risk; 
managing the customer interface; training cus­
tomers; managing staff performance; engaging 
front-line staff; and using information technology 
(Riddle, 2000).
Managers of the innovation process need feed­
back about their management performance. While 
market share will eventually reflect the success of 
management efforts, there exists another method 
for management review. Innovation management 
can be judged and evaluated through an innova­
tion management measurement framework. The 
framework of the innovation management process 
consists of seven categories: inputs management, 
knowledge management, innovation strategy, or­
ganizational culture and structure, portfolio man­
agement, project management and commercial­
ization. Innovation management measurement is 
used within firms by managers and executives. The 
innovation management measurement framework 
allows managers to evaluate their own innovation ac­
tivity, explore the extent to which their organization 
is innovative, and identify areas for improvement 
(Adama & Bessant, 2006).
Issues
Managing Breakthrough Innovation
The process of managing breakthrough innovation, 
also referred to as disruptive or discontinuous in­
novation, varies greatly from managing incremental 
changes in products and technologies. The objec­
tives of incremental innovation, such as speed, cycle 
time, profit impact, and quick cash recovery, gener­
ally do not apply to the breakthrough innovation pro­
cess. Innovation managers recognize that the evalua­
tion process for new products, processes, or services 
differs significantly from that used for extension 
projects. The potential market for incremental inno­
vations is evaluated through conventional market re­
search methods such as written surveys, focus groups, 
or concept tests. Breakthrough innovation projects 
are generally evaluated on their long-term value, im­
pact on the market, and magnitude. The potential 
market for breakthrough innovations is evaluated 
through three main venues:

 Professional conferences and meetings.

 The demonstration of the product via early proto­
types for reaction within the firm.

 Potential customers’ evaluations of early working 
versions.
Determining the value of the innovation within the 
market is a speculative process. The project life-cycle 
for breakthrough innovations includes unpredict­
ability, long time horizons, starts and stops, and pe­
riods of stagnancy. Management practices that facili­
tate the breakthrough innovation process include:

 Mechanisms for directing the technology-market 
arenas in which breakthrough innovations occur;

 Mechanisms for proactively stimulating discontin­
uous breakthrough innovation;

 Mechanisms for protecting projects that operate 
with high risk, uncertainty, and potential for failure.
Innovation managers are responsible for encour­
aging and facilitating the development of new busi­
nesses, product lines, and production processes 
based on breakthrough innovations. In addition, 
managers are responsible for developing and imple­
menting management practices that reduce the high 
uncertainty associated with developing and com­
mercializing breakthrough innovations. Managers, 

Principles of Business: Management
Managing the Process of Innovation
261
responsible for managing the breakthrough innova­
tion process, use five types of managerial strategies to 
influence the process:

 Innovation Mangers Set Boundaries To Direct And 
Constrain Discontinuous Innovation Activities;

 Innovation Mangers Take Proactive Approaches 
To Stimulating Discontinuous Innovation;

 Innovation Mangers Stabilize A Systematic Ap­
proach To Evaluation And Screening Break­
through Innovation;

 Innovation Mangers Create Incubating Organiza­
tional Arrangements;

 Innovation Mangers Recognize The Key Role Of 
Individual Initiative And Capabilities In The Inno­
vation Process.
Ultimately, the breakthrough innovation process is 
not deliberately managed so much as encouraged 
and facilitated. Traditional management techniques 
are unsuitable for breakthrough innovation projects 
up until the point that uncertainty is reduced. The 
managers’ main job is to reduce uncertainty and 
fear of failure up until the point where traditional 
management practices once again are appropriate. 
Managers of a breakthrough innovation project 
must be cognizant and accepting of the realities of 
the life cycle of a discontinuous innovation project. 
Breakthrough innovation projects are long-term 
lasting ten years or longer; have highly uncertain and 
unpredictable outcomes; are sporadic, with many 
stops and starts, deaths and revivals; have changing 
leaders and personnel; and require extensive ex­
ploring and experimenting rather than targeting 
and developing. Ultimately, breakthrough innova­
tion projects, though potentially profitable to the 
business, are most successful when they are separated 
from traditional business expectations and ongoing 
business activities (Rice, 1998).
Case Study: Boeing’s Global Enterprise Technology 
System (GETS)
In 2003, Boeing, a $54-billion-a-year aerospace 
company, developed and applied a new process for 
managing its enterprise-level research and devel­
opment called the Global Enterprise Technology 
System (GETS). The Global Enterprise Technology 
System (GETS), which combines strategies from sys­
tems engineering, software process improvement, 
organizational psychology, and anthropology, pro­
vides a strategically-driven and systems-engineering-
based approach to managing innovation. GETS is an 
example of applying the concepts of systems engi­
neering to research and design.
The Global Enterprise Technology System is a col­
laboration between Boeing’s business units including 
Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Integrated Defense 
Systems, and Phantom Works. The scale of Boeing’s 
business operations includes customers in 145 coun­
tries with products and services such as commercial 
airplanes, defense products such as military air­
planes, rotor-craft, missiles, communications systems, 
and space products such as satellites and launch vehi­
cles. Technological innovation within Boeing’s huge 
system and markets occurs primarily at the research 
organization called Boeing Phantom Works. Boeing 
Phantom Works is often referred to as Boeing’s cata­
lyst of innovation.
The scale of Boeing’s enterprise necessitated an 
approach to managing innovation across many areas 
in a manner that is focused and connected without 
squashing vision and creativity. Boeing developed 
the GETS program to satisfy the following goals and 
objectives: highly collaborative, systematic, efficient, 
continuous, traceable, effective, and simple. The 
Global Enterprise Technology System is organized 
into four distinct phases including Discover, Decide, 
Develop, and Deploy. These four phases occur con­
tinuously at various levels.

 Discover: The discovering process is rooted in the 
constant dialog between what is desirable in the 
marketplace and what is possible to accomplish 
with technology.

 Decide: The deciding process draws on the out­
comes of the discovering phase. Managers ask 
the following questions: What have we learned 
about the future? What new opportunities have 
surfaced? What assumptions have changed? What 
areas of emphasis are changing?

 Develop: The developing process, characterized 
by focus and efficiency, is about carrying out the 
work ideas. Technologists develop plans for the 
chosen research and design efforts and execute 
them within existing resource constraints.

 Deploy: The deployment process involves the 
placement and marketing of the innovative tech­
nology.

Managing the Process of Innovation
Principles of Business: Management

Boeing’s GETS program has produced a generic 
model of technology and product development man­
agement that is used as a guide to establish research 
and development management processes for dif­
ferent parts of the enterprise. The GETS program 
facilitates process development workshops, conducts 
a broad-based formal inspection of the process, and 
promotes continuous improvement philosophy. 
Boeing considers the GETS program to be successful 
in guiding and managing the innovation efforts of 
their 2,500 researchers and their managers. Boeing 
reports the followings benefits and gains from the 
GETS program (Lind, 2006):

 Stronger Working Relationships Across Tech­
nology, Product, And Market Arenas;

 More Strategically Focused Portfolio That Delivers 
Greater Value To Boeing Business Units;

 More Effective Long-Term Focus, Strategic Plan­
ning, And Synergy;

 Reduced Meetings And Travel Associated With 
The Portfolio Planning;

 More Flexible Technology Portfolio To Meet The 
Changing Needs Of The Business;

 Reduced Complexity And A Stronger Innovation 
Process That Is Easier To Apply To New Areas.
The GETS program is a model of large-scale innova­
tion management. Boeing created GETS as an insti­
tutionally approved, supported, and overseen space 
for creativity and breakthrough innovation.
CONCLUSION
In the final analysis, the management of the innovation 
processes across businesses and industries shares nu­
merous characteristics. Patterns of disciplined innova­
tion management include understanding the product 
development process, making support functions time-
invisible, grouping critical resources together, and 
maintaining management continuity (Stalk, 2006). 
Managers of the innovation process can improve their 
firm’s chances at successful innovation by lowering 
sales expectations, assessing risks and rewards, sharing 
the rewards, encouraging innovation, allowing for 
learning and failure, and promoting experimentation 
and the need for change (Brown, 1992).
Questions that managers of the innovation process 
should ask themselves as they develop and implement 
their management strategies include the following: Is 
innovation stated as part of your corporate objectives 
and business plan? Do you provide support to staff 
that try out new ideas, even if the ideas fail? Do you 
have experiments or pilots of new service concepts 
being conducted within your business? Does your 
financial reporting system reflect innovation as an 
investment or a cost? (Riddle, 2000). Ultimately, in­
novation, when properly managed, gives companies 
competitive advantage in the marketplace.

Motivation, Productivity and Change Management
ABSTRACT
This article will focus on the importance for a manager 
to understand how to motivate employees and manage 
change within an organization, and how productivity 
is affected by the nature of the information-based or­
ganization. A summary of motivation theories is pre­
sented, including the needs-based, process-based, and 
reinforcement motivation theories. This is followed by 
an overview of the most mainstream change manage­
ment models for creating organizational transforma­
tion. Finally, the paper presents a discussion on how 
productivity is affected by employee motivation, and 
how contemporary fast-paced information-based or­
ganizations can take advantage of motivational and 
change management theory.
OVERVIEW
In the year 2000, the well-known management guru 
Peter Drucker predicted a changing organizational 
landscape; one that is centered around information 
rather than productivity, focusing on worker knowledge, 
information sharing, and task specialists. Looking at the 
state of contemporary organizations, one can conclude 
that Drucker was right. Contemporary organizations 
face the challenges resulting from exponential growth in 
global competition, short product life cycles and quickly 
changing consumer demand (Muthusamy, Wheeler, 
& Simmons, 2005). These factors, combined with in­
formation availability and accessibility described by 
Drucker, have led organizations to find success through 
innovative and creative thinking, employee empower­
ment, and the sharing and management of knowledge. 
This has created a significant paradigm shift in how or­
ganizations motivate employees, how much value they 
place on worker productivity and where it fits, and how 
organizations deal with change (the foundational basis 
of ‘innovation’ and ‘transformation’—popular buzz­
words for contemporary organizational practitioners). 
This paper provides an overview of each of these topics, 
and how they are interrelated with each other.
Motivation
Never before has motivation played such a critical 
role in the workplace. Employees, in general, have 
more freedom than ever in getting their jobs done. 
The idea of self-managed employees and a demo­
cratic workplace is no longer the organization of the 
future. Rather, companies are beginning to embrace 
these concepts in order to have a changing orga­
nization that can adapt to an unstable and increas­
ingly changing work environment. Some suggest 
that a completely democratic workplace is inevitable 
(Collins, 1997). This is creating a shift in emphasis 
from managing to leading, of which motivation plays 
a big role. The best leaders understand how to moti­
vate their employees, using a transformational leader­
ship style that is inspiring, intellectually stimulating, 
and provides individual consideration for each em­
ployee (Bass, 1999). Leaders of modern-day organi­
zations must know how to motivate each of their em­
ployees in order for them to thrive in dynamic work 
environments. Understanding the various motivation 
theories is the first step to putting them into practice.
Motivation Theories can be categorized into 
three areas; needs-based, process, and reinforce­
ment (Kinicki & Williams, 2003). All three categories 
should be considered by managers and leaders in the 
right situational context.
Needs Theories
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Maslow’s Hierarchy of 
Needs theory is probably the most widely recognized 
motivational theory. Maslow asserted that our needs are 
fulfilled in a progressively complex way—a hierarchy 
consisting of five levels. An individual’s needs are prior­
itized by the position in the hierarchy, whereby certain 
needs cannot be achieved until the needs in the lower 
level of the hierarchy are fulfilled. The five levels (from 
bottom to top) are physiological needs, safety needs, 
social needs, self-esteem needs, and self-actualization. 
The physiological needs that one has are elements such 
as food shelter, clothing, and other most basic necessi­
ties. The safety needs include protection from physical 
and emotional harm, and the elimination of conflict. 
Clearly, in an industry such as construction, safety is a 
larger concern than it might be for computer program­
mers (Halepota, 2005). The social needs include the 
need for love, friendship, affiliation, and belonging. 
The self-esteem needs include job status, respect, pro­
motion, and recognition. Finally, self-actualization is a

Motivation, Productivity and Change Management
265
level where all of the needs are met, and one is com­
pletely satisfied with one’s surrounding environment. 
Organizational leaders should concentrate on where 
their employee’s needs fit within the hierarchy. For 
example, it would not make sense to promote an em­
ployee without first offering an adequate salary.
A second widely-used needs theory was developed 
by David McClelland (Kinicki & Kreitner, 2006). 
McClelland suggested that individuals have three 
needs: a need for achievement, a need for power, and 
a need for affiliation. He suggested that every indi­
vidual is different with regards to his or her needs, and 
in order to adequately motivate someone, a leader 
should have a clear understanding of their own em­
ployees’ needs with regards to these three areas. For 
example, someone with a high need for affiliation 
might be well-suited for a human resources position, 
while someone with a high need for achievement 
might be well-suited for a sales position. A leader can 
make a critical mistake by exclusively using motiva­
tional techniques that concentrate in the wrong area, 
such trying to fulfill affiliation needs for a group of 
engineers that enjoy working in solitude.
The third needs theory that is often embraced 
was developed by Frederick Herzberg, and is often 
referred to as Hygiene Theory of Job Satisfaction 
(Kinicki et al., 2006). Herzberg suggested that organi­
zations have elements that can be classified as satisfiers 
and dissatisfiers, and that in order to satisfy and moti­
vate employees, a leader/manager should remove the 
elements that dissatisfy employees and improve the el­
ements that satisfy employees. Such elements as rules 
and regulations, salary, work environment, and super­
visors are classified as dissatisfiers, or hygiene factors. 
Promotion opportunities, learning opportunities, job 
recognition, and challenging work are classified as sat­
isfiers. While both are important to motivating an em­
ployee, oftentimes organizations only concentrate on 
removing the dissatisfiers, which does not intrinsically 
motivate the employee, especially in the long run. Take 
the employee who is not happy with his or her career 
progression and attempts to resign, only to be tempted 
to stay with an increase in salary—a short-term solu­
tion that does not create the desired satisfaction.
Process Theories
There are three predominant process theories of 
motivation: Victor Vrooms Expectancy theory, Equity 
theory, and Goal setting theories.
The expectancy theory of motivation has three 
components (Kinicki et al., 2003). First, the employee 
has an expectation that his or her efforts will lead to 
high job performance. Second, the employee under­
stands that if he or she performs at a high level, there 
will be a positive outcome. Finally, the employee un­
derstands the value of the possible outcome. These 
components—expectancy, instrumentality, and va­
lence—are three elements of Vroom’s theory. An ex­
ample to demonstrate this needs process might be a 
commissioned salesman who is preparing for a sales 
call to a potential new customer. The salesman knows 
that in order to get the sale, an effort must be made, 
rather than having the purchase order just “drop 
in his lap.” He spends half the night preparing his 
presentation, knowing that he will not present well 
without adequate presentation (effort leading to ex­
pectancy). He knows that if the presentation goes well, 
he will likely get the sales order (performance leading 
to instrumentality). Finally, he knows that an order 
will lead to a sales commission, and he’ll be closer to 
his monthly sales goal (outcome leading to value or 
valence). He is motivated to prepare and get the sale.
Another process needs theory is Adam’s Equity 
Theory. Adam asserted that the employee/employer 
relationship was a two way street where the employee 
has a number of inputs into the organization, and 
expects a number of resultant outputs that are fair 
and equitable. For example, an employee might 
bring past job experience, educational accomplish­
ments, and might work 10 hours per week more than 
the average. To make these inputs feel equitable, the 
employee is motivated by good pay, promotional op­
portunities, and a good working environment. When 
there is an imbalance between input and outputs 
resulting in a feeling of inequity, the employee will 
have a feeling of dissonance—something is not right 
in the relationship. As a result, he or she won’t be 
motivated towards achieving high performance. To 
remedy this, an employer might consider the individ­
ual’s inputs separately, and compensate them accord­
ingly to satisfy the inequity. Ramlall (2004) suggested 
that the Equity theory also considered the compar­
ison to others. In other words, employees are moti­
vated by positioning themselves against their fellow 
employees through their work inputs, and expect to 
be rewarded accordingly.
A third process theory is the Goal Setting theory. 
Drucker (as cited in Hoopes, 2003) asserted that 

Motivation, Productivity and Change Management
Principles of Business: Management
266
the manager/employee relationship was immoral 
due to the power imbalance between the manager 
and the subordinate. His solution was the process of 
Management-By-Objective (MBO), where the em­
ployee has control over his or her work goals and 
tasks, which result in varying compensation levels and 
gives the employee a perception of being in control 
of their performance. Locke and Latham (Kinicki 
et al., 2003) formalized the Goal-Setting theory as 
a motivational construct, and this led to the birth 
of the SMART goals acronym (Smart, Measurable, 
Achievable, Relevant, and Time bound) that is com­
monly embraced by organizations, organizational 
practitioners, and management scholars.
Reinforcement Theory
Reinforcement theory is based on the reasoning that 
actions lead to consequences, which then lead to fu­
ture behaviors. In this realm, there are four ways to 
reinforce behavior: positive reinforcement, negative 
reinforcement, extinction, and punishment (Kinicki 
et al., 2003). Positive reinforcement uses rewards to 
encourage continued behavior, such as a bonus for 
performing well. Negative reinforcement is the re­
moval of consequences after a positive change in be­
havior has occurred, such as a sales manager who no 
longer calls three times a day to check up on a new 
salesperson. Extinction is the reinforcement process 
by which rewards are withheld or eliminated due to 
poor performance, such as the engineering man­
ager who does not offer public recognition of an em­
ployee who does not have good performance, while 
publicly complimenting everyone else in the depart­
ment. The last way to reinforce is through punish­
ment, such as the manager that docks an employee’s 
pay for coming in late to work on several occasions.
Productivity
Productivity is closely related to motivation. For em­
ployees to be effective and efficient in their job tasks, 
having the technical knowledge and ability is not 
necessarily enough. The employees also need the re­
sources required to do the job. They need supportive 
management and leadership with a vision that is 
aligned with their own goals and objectives. Most im­
portantly, an employee needs to be driven (or moti­
vated) by some means to achieve high performance.
Employees are significantly influenced by the 
leadership and management styles employed by their 
managers and supervisors. In a time where innova­
tion and change is expected, the transformational 
leadership style can be closely tied to employee per­
formance. Much research has indicated that behavior 
and performance are positively influenced by trans­
formational leadership (Caillier, 2014). Inspiring 
employees is a major element of that leadership style.
Kouzes and Posner (2003) also discussed how mo­
tivation and inspiration could affect employee perfor­
mance. They claimed that leaders who routinely en­
gaged in their five recommended practices—model 
the way, inspire a shared vision, challenge the process, 
enable others to act, and encourage the heart—are 
not only more productive in their jobs, but they are 
viewed as better leaders and have higher job satisfac­
tion. They clearly established a link between a motiva­
tional style of leadership and employee performance.
Another model of performance was presented by 
T.R. Mitchell and D. Daniels (as cited in Kinicki et al., 
2006). The creators of this model asserted that an em­
ployee’s motivated behavior results from three things. 
First, the employee brings certain skills, such as job 
knowledge, traits, emotions, and beliefs to the work­
place and the job setting. Second, the workplace em­
ployer provides the job context, such as the environ­
ment, support, rewards, task types, and work culture. 
Third, the manager of the employee uses processes 
that motivate the employee, such as giving them at­
tention and direction, creating arousal, or being in­
tense or persistent. These three things (employee in­
puts, job context, and motivating processes) result in 
the motivating behavior or drive that employees have 
towards completing tasks or achieving goals. The re­
sulting motivating behavior includes employee focus, 
effort, strategy, and persistence in accomplishing the 
desired objectives or tasks. The model is based on the 
assertion that performance and productivity is directly 
related to motivated behavior, and that managers and 
leaders need to understand how to motivate their em­
ployees, in addition to providing the technical skills 
and an accommodating work environment.
In all three instances, performance is directly re­
lated to how motivated employees are.
Change Management
With an emphasis on creativity, innovation, and trans­
formation due to the new information-based organi­
zational (Drucker, 2000) and transformational leader­
ship environment (Bass, 1999), understanding how to 

Principles of Business: Management
Motivation, Productivity and Change Management
267
manage change is critical to the organizational strategy 
and process. Goodstein and Burke (as cited in French, 
Bell, & Zawacki, 2005) put it this way, “American cor­
porations are accepting the ‘New Age’ view of orga­
nizations as a ‘nested subset of open, living systems, 
dependent upon the larger environment for survival’” 
(p. 388). The fast-changing business environments of 
the twenty-first century, especially due to globaliza­
tion and increased competition, have resulted in a 
significant need to not only be open to organizational 
change, but also to understand how to manage the 
change process. There are several theories of change 
that exist, and they all have much in common. Some 
of the more popular change theories are Kurt Lewin’s 
three-step change theory, Appreciative Inquiry, and 
John Kotter’s 8-step model of change.
Kurt Lewin’s 3-step Change Theory
Kurt Lewin is considered the father of understanding 
organizational change by most. His model suggests that 
there are three steps one should take when undergoing 
organizational change: unfreezing, moving, and then 
refreezing. Through this process, the group undergoing 
change can first be destabilized—that is, allowing behav­
iors to move away from the status quo. The second step, 
moving, allows the change agents to implement the dif­
ferent processes or desired behaviors to the point that 
seems most desirable. Once this is achieved, the third 
stage is to refreeze, which stabilizes the change, making 
it the norm in terms of actions and behaviors (French 
et al., 2005). This model is one of the more popular 
change models, but also one that many consider out­
dated. However, Lewin’s work should not be discounted 
as his theory continues to influence emerging thought, 
such as complexity theory (Burnes, 2004).
Appreciative Inquiry is a change model that is 
gaining in popularity and acceptance. Using this 
model of change, organizational change agents focus 
on the successes rather than the failures in order 
to pinpoint areas in which to change. The positive 
essence of the methodology makes it attractive to 
those who are generally concerned with employees’ 
natural resistance to change. Johnson (Johnson & 
Leavitt, 2001) stated, “Appreciative inquiry is an ap­
proach that is uniquely suited to organizations that 
seek to be collaborative, inclusive, and genuinely 
caring for both the people within the organization 
and those they serve” (p. 129). In the field of organi­
zational development, where major transformations 
take place, appreciative inquiry is the most common 
and most preferred method used by contemporary 
organizational practitioners (Rita Williams, as cited 
in French et al., 2005). The appreciative inquiry 
method not only serves as a catalyst for change, but is 
also the most easily accepted transformation process 
for those that resist change. The appreciative inquiry 
process, by means of looking at possibilities rather 
than problems, provides a different perspective for 
those involved in an organizational transformation.
John Kotter, a Harvard University professor, is well 
known as a leader in change management theory. 
His most famous work was his eight-step model for 
creating change (Kotter, 1998). The eight steps in his 
model were:
1.	 Establish a sense of urgency
2.	 Form a powerful guiding coalition
3.	 Create a vision
4.	 Communicate a vision
5.	 Empower others to act on a vision
6.	 Plan and create short-term wins
7.	 Consolidate improvements and produce even 
more change
8.	 Institutionalize new approaches
This model provided organizational change agents 
with a logical, action-oriented formula for imple­
menting change, and as such has become popular on 
most bookshelves of modern managers and leaders. 
The first four steps are intended to change the status 
quo—perhaps building on Lewin’s model. Steps 
three through seven allow the organization to intro­
duce and begin implementing the change. The last 
step is intended to make the change permanently im­
bedded into the fabric of the organization.
Application
Motivating employees in a changing environment is 
no easy task. A leader in the twenty-first-century infor­
mation-based organization is faced with a multitude of 
challenges (such as keeping productivity high) as in­
formation and knowledge-sharing is encroaching into 
the space that productivity once exclusively held at the 
top of the organizational priority list. The leader must 
engage in the leadership style that is most affective for 
an unstable and constantly changing environment.
Antonakis and House (as cited in Kinicki and 
Williams, 2003, p. 465) concluded that a combination 

Motivation, Productivity and Change Management
Principles of Business: Management
268
of transformational leadership and transactional lead­
ership styles, with an emphasis on the transformational 
portion, is the best method for leaders to motivate 
their employees. Leaders need to be aware of the in­
dividual needs of their employees, including the best 
way to motivate them. Every employee is different, 
and as such, leaders would benefit by considering the 
different types of motivating theories, some based on 
need, some based on process, and some based on be­
havior and reinforcement. However, understanding 
how to motivate each employee should not over­
shadow the need for the developmental and technical 
skills needed to perform job tasks, as well as making 
the appropriate and required resources available to 
the employees. Michaelson (2005) warns that where 
motivational theories are applied for the sole purpose 
of driving productivity, productivity will almost inevi­
tably decline. Management that views workers pater­
nalistically or as units to be manipulated, ultimately 
dehumanizes its workforce, however fair and ben­
eficial the methods. In fact, respect, justice, and fair 
compensation may align with a worker’s own idea of 
proper management, but if such reasonable treatment 
is transparently applied as “motivational” rather than 
humane, the worker may not respond in a positive way.
In addition to motivating employees, being a trans­
formational leader also means that the leader is con­
stantly striving for change through innovation and cre­
ative thinking. As leaders push for change, in order to 
keep up or stay ahead of the competition, they should 
expect to see significant resistance, unless an effective 
change management strategy is employed.
The bottom line is that the concepts of motivation, 
change management and productivity are intertwined 
and linked. All three should be a major consideration 
for a contemporary transformational leader.

Multi-generational Management
Principles of Business: Management

Multi-generational Management
ABSTRACT
The study of multi-generational management has 
recently come into vogue, because an unusual cir­
cumstance has developed. Significant numbers of 
five distinct generations are now present in the work­
force of the United States, a phenomenon human 
resources professionals and social scientists have 
dubbed “5G.” This presents unique challenges for 
managers because each generation has in place cer­
tain stereotypes about itself and about the other four 
generations. These stereotypes affect the ways the 
generations interact with one another at work, and 
have frequently been the source of conflict. 
OVERVIEW
The modern workplace has long been struggling to ad­
dress issues of diversity, as members of more and more 
groups find themselves needing to understand one 
another well enough to get along or at least get their 
work done with a minimal amount of friction. During 
this process, diversity has usually taken the form of 
differences in gender, ethnicity, cultural background, 
sexual orientation, or religious affiliation. Within the 
past few years, a new category has been added to this 
list: generational diversity. This is because, for a variety 
of personal and economic reasons, more generations 
are simultaneously participating in the workforce than 
has been seen at almost any other period in history. 
At present there are five distinct generations working 
side by side: the traditionalists (born before 1946), the 
baby boomers (born after 1946 but before 1964), gen­
eration X (born after 1965 and before 1980), genera­
tion Y (born after 1980 and before 1995, also known 
as millennials), and generation Z (born after 1996). 
Each of these generations has distinctive qualities that 
it is known for; some of these are positive, while others 
are negative. These stereotypical representations affect 
the kinds of expectations held by members of one gen­
eration when they interact with another generation. As 
is often the case when people act based on their expec­
tations of others, there are times when the interaction 
takes on the semblance of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
For example, if a group of millennials expect 
that their baby boomer supervisor will behave in a 
self-centered manner, thinking primarily about his 
or her own needs, then it is likely that most of the 
supervisor’s actions will be interpreted this way, re­
gardless of their true intent. When the supervisor 
eventually learns that he or she is being perceived in 
this way, it is likely to create resentment toward the 
millennials for thinking the worst (Zemke, Raines, & 
Filipczak, 2013).
APPLICATIONS
In an effort to avoid generational conflicts in the 
workplace, many managers have begun to study the 
ways that different generations tend to interact with 
one another at work. Obviously, there are a great 
many permutations and combinations that can arise 
from the five different generations, as well as the 
many different types of relationships that are possible 
in the contemporary work environment. Employees 
can be above or below one another in the hierarchy, 
or at the same level (Burke, Cooper, & Antoniou, 
2015). They can also be members of completely sepa­
rate hierarchies and power structures, who neverthe­
less are required by the circumstances of the work­
place to interact with one another from time to time.
A good deal has been written about the stereo­
typical behaviors that each generation supposedly 
exhibits: Traditionalists are old fashioned and me­
thodical, and tend to resist the use of technology 
whenever possible, preferring face to face communi­
cation. Baby boomers are seen as disliking authority 
but having a preference for clear organizational 
structures with well established reporting lines; 
they are sometimes described as materialistic and 
even self-absorbed. Generation Xers are thought to 
be cynical and independent, because they grew up 
exposed to numerous political and religious scan­
dals, and often had to look after themselves because 
their parents were divorced, working, or both—the 
term “latch key kid” dates from Generation X’s era, 
when kids would go home after school to an house 
because both parents were at work. Millennials share 
the baby boomers’ distrust of authority, but possess 
great aptitude with technology, since they grew up 
using the Internet and various gadgets. Generation 
Z is only just entering the workforce, so it is difficult

to tell what all of its distinguishing characteristics will 
be, though it is clear that its members are even more 
comfortable with technology than are members of 
generation Y (Sauser & Sims, 2012).
Perhaps the most interesting piece of research on 
these issues, from a managerial perspective, at least, 
is a study that investigated these generational stereo­
types in an effort to determine how accurate they really 
are. The study found, among other things, that virtu­
ally all generational stereotypes relevant to workplace 
performance are experienced as exaggerations by 
the generation to whom they are attributed. For each 
generational grouping, questions were asked of that 
group’s members and of members of all of the other 
groups, about how accurate the stereotypes attributed 
to that group are. Every group reported feeling that 
others’ understanding of it was exaggerated.
For example, if all groups were asked what per­
centage of millennials behave awkwardly in social 
situations, most groups might estimate the answer to 
be about 80 percent, whereas millennials themselves 
would estimate about 50 percent. In other words, the 
stereotypes that each generation has about the other 
generations tend to be grounded in truth, but are 
less true than people outside a given group believe 
they are (Elliott, 2011). 
Managing multiple generations of workers requires 
balancing competing interests, some of which appear 
to be at odds with one another (Al-Asfour, 2014). This 
can make management a thankless job, as almost any 
type of initiative can be relied upon to upset one gen­
eration even as it appeases another. For example, if 
a company sought to introduce an employee benefit 
that would be paid out in the form of shares in the 
company that could be redeemed after ten years, 
younger employees such as millennials and those 
from generation Z might be quite pleased, but older 
employees like traditionalists and even some baby 
boomers might be less thrilled (Abrams & Von, 2013). 
This would be because the older employees might 
not want to wait years into their retirement to receive 
the benefit, while the younger employees, with more 
working years ahead of them, would find the delay less 
onerous. Software technologies have been developed 
specifically to help human resource personnel to deal 
with a multi-generational workforce (König, 2015).
In order to avoid conflict-generating situations, 
managers of multiple generations will often try to 
craft benefit programs in such a way as to make them 
appealing to each age group of employees at the firm 
(Bussin & van Rooy, 2014). In the example above, the 
benefit of company shares might be altered so that it 
could be redeemed at any time during the ten year 
period, but the reward would be greater if one waited 
longer. This way, all generations would have the op­
tion of receiving the same benefit, but they would 
also have the flexibility of cashing it in sooner if that 
worked better for them.
VIEWPOINTS
One piece of advice that multi-generational man­
agers agree on is that they should be aware of dif­
ferences among employees of different generations, 
but try to build on the similarities that exist between 
them. For example, baby boomers are unusual in 
the fact that they frequently care for their parents 
and their children at the same time; they are some­
times called the “sandwich generation,” since they 
are sandwiched between the needs of their parents 
and their kids. Sometimes this causes baby boomers 
to resent members of other generations, envying the 
fact that they do not have as many duties to juggle. 
A skillful manager could help avoid conflict around 
this by enlisting both Baby Boomers and members 
of other groups to help the company design support 
services for employees in need of child care. This 
would be a project that focuses on what employees 
of different generations have in common—the need 
for high quality child care—rather than what distin­
guishes them.
Interestingly, most of the generations think other 
generations have the same negative qualities, the 
majority of which seem to result from poor commu­
nication between members of different generations. 
This can be seen when one asks members of various 
generations what they think about other genera­
tions’ attitudes toward change. Members of younger 
generations will usually report that members of older 
generations are resistant to change: Baby boomers 
say this about traditionalists, generation X says it 
about baby boomers, and generation Y says it about 
generation X, and so on. The pattern holds for other 
stereotypes as well. Millennials think baby boomers 
are arrogant, baby boomers think millennials are ar­
rogant, and so on—suggesting that the underlying 
issue is that the generations are not communicating 
well with one another (Szollose, 2011). Facilitating

communication between generations, and in effect 
“translating” for one generation so that its words and 
behavior are understood by other generations the 
way they were meant to be, becomes the role of the 
multi-generational manager. Ideally this sort of work 
is done ahead of time, so that misunderstandings 
and conflicts can be avoided before they begin, but 
in large organizations where things are constantly on 
the move, this is not always possible. The manager 
must then clean up the mess caused by mistaken as­
sumptions, clarifying communications, and repairing 
bruised egos on all sides (Lindsell-Roberts, 2011).
Recruitment
It is tempting to think of the multi-generational work­
force only in terms of the problems it can cause, but 
there are potential benefits worth considering as 
well. Having employees from different age groups 
all working together toward the same organizational 
goals brings to the work a much wider range of skills 
and experience than would be present if only one or 
two generations were represented. Some employers, 
cognizant of this benefit, design their recruitment ef­
forts to appeal to members of different generations. 
This can be a tricky affair because it is easy for re­
cruiters to fall back on simplistic stereotypes about 
the generations, assuming that all millennial and 
generation Z workers are vegan carpoolers, for ex­
ample (Reitman & American Society for Training 
and Development, 2013).
The best multi-generational recruitment efforts 
are based on detailed research and discussions with 
members of the groups being targeted, so that a real­
istic picture of the target generations and their needs 
can be developed. Sometimes, this involves refining 
the lens through which the generations are being 
studied. This can mean not only looking at the year 
of an employee’s birth to determine their genera­
tion, but also examining criteria such as career stage. 
Career stage is an approximation of how long an em­
ployee has been in a career, and tends to be classified 
as early, middle, or late.
Early career is usually five years or less in a role, 
middle career is five to fifteen years, and late career 
stage is fifteen or more years in a role (Warnell, 
2015). Thus, an employee born in 1975 who has been 
working as a salesperson for eight years might be de­
scribed as a member of generation X at the middle 
stage of his or her career. This gives a clearer picture 
of the employee’s experience and potential attitudes, 
which can be useful when helping the employee in­
teract effectively with others. For example, more 
than one generation complains that other genera­
tions do not respect its authority or acknowledge the 
contribution of their experience. Assessing the accu­
racy of this kind of complaint could be difficult for 
a manager who does not know more about the em­
ployees involved—an early stage baby boomer who 
does not feel her experience is being respected by a 
late stage millennial is a very different situation than 
a late stage traditional who feels that her experience 
is not being acknowledged by an early stage genera­
tion Z employee. When a thorny conflict arises, the 
wise manager will pause to consider issues such as 
stage and generation (Finkelstein, 2015).

Negotiations
ABSTRACT
Wherever people work together, there is a potential 
for conflict. This is particularly true in organizations 
where the needs and focus of the different stakehold­
ers often are often in opposition. Conflict can nega­
tively impact an organization’s performance and 
effectiveness. Negotiation is a process used to help 
conflicting parties reach a mutually acceptable agree­
ment. There are two primary factors that can affect 
the effectiveness of negotiations: The skill of the 
negotiator in conflict management skills and various 
situational variables. To be successful in negotiations, 
good preparation is essential. There are a number 
of tactics that a negotiator can use to help become 
better prepared for the negotiating table including 
information gathering about the strengths, weak­
nesses, and assumptions of the opponent. In addi­
tion, it is important for the negotiator to be mentally 
prepared for the negotiating table through an under­
standing of his/her own strengths, weaknesses, and 
assumptions as well.
OVERVIEW
In many ways, globalization has revolutionized the 
way that many organizations do business. The prac­
tice of off-shoring enables organizations to relocate 
part of their operations to another country with 
lower costs or to outsource functions or activities to 
other companies with lower rates both around the 
country and around the world. Typically, this work 
was previously performed by domestic employees. 
However, these practices are often necessary to com­
bat another result of globalization: the increased 
competition from other organizations at home that 
are able to charge less because of outsourced work 
or around the world and are able to compete in the 
global marketplace. Although organizations poten­
tially have a greater, global marketplace in which to 
market their products or services, this marketplace is 
also populated by more competitors than ever before.
Stakeholder Interest & Conflict
Most organizations have multiple stakeholders — 
­persons or groups that can affect or be affected by a 
decision or action. These may include the organiza­
tion’s employees, suppliers, distributors, and stockhold­
ers. Often the interests of the different stakeholders are 
in conflict. For example, most stockholders will be pri­
marily concerned with earning a high return on their 
investment. In the abstract, keeping labor prices down 
or raising the sales price of widgets in the marketplace 
are equally able to do this. Workers, of course, have a 
different view of the situation. They want an income 
that not only represents a living wage but a fair one as 
well. Therefore, keeping down the organization’s costs 
by keeping down employee wages (particularly vis à vis 
comparable wages within the industry) is likely to harm 
rather than help the organization’s bottom line in the 
long run as workers leave for organizations with better 
compensation packages. Another group with a stake in 
organizational operations is management. This group 
is often more likely to take the long view of organiza­
tional effectiveness, realizing that holding down wages 
will lead to worker unrest and dissatisfaction and have 
a negative impact on the viability of the organization. 
However, they typically also realize the need to stay 
competitive in the global marketplace with its increased 
competition and potentially cheaper labor rates.
The needs and focus of the different constituen­
cies within the organization often lead to conflict — 
the situation where one or more parties believes that 
its interests are negatively affected by another party. 
For example, conflict can arise between labor and 
management over a wage increase. One of the goals 
of management is to keep costs down, and wages 
are one of the costs of doing business. Employees, 
on the other hand, are more concerned about their 
own costs and taking care of their families, so they

seek higher wages in order to do this effectively. 
There  are two ways that such a situation can be 
viewed. In the win-lose orientation, one or more of 
the parties in the conflict look at the situation as a 
fixed pool of resources that can be divided among 
the parties. In this view of conflict, the more one side 
receives, the less the other side receives. So, for exam­
ple, labor might balk at the implementation of a new 
research and development department because they 
view it as increasing the number of employees that 
needs to be paid from a limited source of funds for 
wages. Management, similarly, might view this as a 
win-lose situation because the more that they have to 
pay the current workers, the less money they will have 
available to support the proposed research function 
that theoretically can develop new products that will 
gain more income for the company with which they 
may be able to give workers higher compensation in 
the long term.
However, in many conflict situations, it is not nec­
essary for there to be a winner and a loser. In the 
win-win orientation, one or more of the parties to 
the conflict believe that it is possible to arrive at a 
mutually beneficial solution for all parties involved. 
Continuing with the example of a conflict over 
wages, a win-win orientation might mean that both 
sides are cognizant of the fact that having a nominal 
cost of living raise in the short term so that more 
monies can be devoted to research and develop­
ment efforts may mean an overall higher wage in 
the long term after the success of the research and 
development efforts.
Resolving Organizational Conflict
One of the ways that conflict between groups within an 
organization is often resolved is through negotiation. 
This is an interactive process between two or more 
conflicting parties in which the parties attempt reach 
a mutually acceptable agreement about an issue or 
issues of mutual interest. In negotiation, the conflict 
is redefined in terms of interdependence of the par­
ties. For example, in the illustration above, although 
the employees could push for the highest raise pos­
sible, if that action would cause the organization to 
go out of business, neither side would win. Similarly, 
if the organization refused to listen to the employees’ 
arguments for a raise and only paid minimum wage, 
they might soon lose not only the current employees 
but the possibility of hiring new employees at that 
rate. The employees, similarly, would lose the security 
of their current job and have to look for new work. 
Again, both sides would lose because both sides are 
dependent on each other. Because of this fact, nego­
tiation between the two parties in the wage dispute 
discussed above would have as one of its goals to move 
both parties from a win-lose orientation to a win-win 
orientation. So, the employees might settle for a cost-
of-living increase for the next year with a promise of a 
greater increase after the new research and develop­
ment effort increases the organization’s cash flow or 
some other agreement in which both sides win.
Approaches to Effective Negotiation
It is generally agreed that competition, accommo­
dation, or other win-lose strategies are not typically 
effective in negotiations. Although some theorists 
posit that collaboration is the best negotiating 
approach, others believe that other win-win orien­
tations can also be effective. One must be careful 
of adopting a collaborative approach until mutual 
trust can be established between the parties. In addi­
tion, collaboration requires the sharing of informa­
tion between the parties in the conflict. However, 
complete transparency in negotiations can be ill 
advised. Information is power, and if one side in 
the negotiation has too much power, the situation 
can quickly become win-lose rather than win-win. 
Most skilled negotiations tend to share information 
slowly, particularly at the beginning of the nego­
tiation. This allows trust to be built. In addition, 
although a win-win approach is typically preferable, 
if it becomes apparent that such an approach will 
not work, it may be necessary to switch to a win-lose 
approach.
As shown in Figure 1, negotiation is a process in 
which the goal is to move the position of the par­
ties involved to a point where a mutually acceptable 
agreement can be reached. This area of potential 
agreement is called the “bargaining zone.” In negoti­
ation, each party begins by describing its initial offer 
for each point on the agenda. This may be what each 
believes to be the best that it can achieve out of the 
negotiation, or it may be a best-of-all-possible-worlds 
scenario. For example, representatives of the employ­
ees may start with asking for a cost-of-living increase 
(i.e., a best achievable approach) or a 25-percent 
increase (i.e., an ideal-world approach), and repre­
sentatives of management may start with refusing 

Negotiations

276
to give any raise (i.e., an ideal-world approach). 
However, this initial offer is typically recognized by 
all involved to be only a starting point for discussions 
and that both sides will make concessions (i.e., move 
closer to the bargaining zone). The target point for 
each party is what it believes to be a realistic expecta­
tion for the outcome of the negotiation. The resis­
tance point is the point beyond which each party is 
willing to continue negotiations because it will be giv­
ing away too much to the other party (i.e., the situa­
tion becomes too win-lose).
For example, the employees in the illustra­
tion above may start with what they believe to be a 
good outcome of a cost-of-living increase plus an 
additional 8 percent as their initial offer. Given the 
circumstance of the company, however, they may rea­
sonably expect to get a cost-of-living increase plus 2 
percent as a target point. Further, they may also have 
determined that they cannot afford to receive less 
than a cost-of-living increase with a promise of rene­
gotiations in a year once the research and develop­
ment effort is finished.
If the negotiation is being conducted with a win-
lose orientation, the parties do not reveal their tar­
get or resistance points so as not to give an advantage 
to the other side. In a win-win negotiation situation, 
however, sharing information often can help to reach 
a mutually acceptable solution. If, for example, a sup­
plier needs to postpone delivery dates and the buyer 
does not care as long as the dates are before a certain 
date, an agreement can be reached. In this scenario, 
the supplier would probably concede something to 
the buyer, such as a lower price, financing, or a will­
ingness to deliver more items.
Factors Affecting the Success of Negotiations
The primary factors that can affect the effective­
ness of negotiations are the skill of the negotiator in 
conflict management skills and various situational 
variables. Research shows that negotiators who plan 
and set goals are more likely to facilitate a satisfac­
tory agreement for all parties involved. A negotiator 
needs to carefully consider all known information 
in order to develop the best possible initial offer, tar­
get point, and resistance point. This includes articu­
lating and checking the assumptions that are being 
made in the situation, what the values of his or her 
party are, and what the goals are for the situation. 
In addition, a good negotiator will go through the 
same thought processes for the other party’s posi­
tion in order to better understand how to reach a 
mutually acceptable agreement. To aid in this pro­
cess, the negotiator needs to be skillful at gathering 
information. Part of this means to engaging in active 
listening — an approach to improved communica­
tion in which the receiver of the message attempts 
to better understand the message being transmitted, 
formulates a response based on this understand­
ing, and responds in a way that clarifies the message. 
Information gathering also involves asking the other 
party for details about its position in order to better 
understand what they desire. This process can often 
be helped by using a team of negotiators rather than 
a single individual. In this way, more information can 
be gathered and additional insights applied to help 
achieve an optimal solution for all parties involved.
Necessary Negotiator Skills
A good negotiator needs not only to be a good lis­
tener, but a good communicator as well. Part of this 
means working to make sure that the emotional or 
interpersonal conflict is kept to a minimum and that 
the situation is viewed as objectively as possible. Good 
negotiators are also persuasive, excelling in the art of 
convincing the other party to take a particular course 
of action or hold a particular point of view by using 
argument, reasoning, or entreaty. In other words, a 
good negotiator is not only able to clearly articulate 
the position of his or her side so that the other party 
can understand it, he or she is also able to get the 
other party to accept the goals of his or her side.
Particularly in win-win situations, however, nego­
tiation is not just about getting one’s way, but also 
about making concessions in order to reach the

optimal solution for all parties involved. When both 
sides are willing to make concessions, they are able 
to move closer to the bargaining zone, where they 
can potentially reach an agreement. Concessions 
also signal to the other party that one is negotiating 
in good faith and is truly trying to reach a mutually 
agreeable solution to the conflict. However, conces­
sions also show the other party what one considers 
to be of importance in the negotiating situation. As 
stated before, it is often unwise to give away too much 
information at least until mutual trust has been 
established. Therefore, most negotiators offer just 
enough concessions to keep the lines of communica­
tion open without giving away too much. Otherwise, 
concessions might be perceived as a sign of weakness 
by the other party and encourage them to employ 
power and resistance in the negotiation rather than 
to work toward a mutually acceptable solution.
Situational Factors Affecting the Success of 
­Negotiations
In addition to the skills of the negotiator, the success 
of negotiations can be affected by various situational 
factors. One of these is the location of the nego­
tiation. People often try to keep the negotiations in 
their own environment so that they can keep to their 
normal routines, not have to cope with travel-related 
stress, or depend on others for the various resources 
they might need during the negotiation. For this 
reason, many negotiations are held in a neutral envi­
ronment. Although twenty-first-century telecommu­
nications technologies mean that negotiations can 
potentially be held at a distance so that both parties 
can be on home ground, most negotiators find that 
in-person negotiations are preferable. This in true in 
part because it is easier to read body language and 
other nonverbal communication in a face-to-face sit­
uation and also allows for additional sidebar discus­
sions outside the negotiating room. In addition, the 
physical layout of the negotiating room can influence 
the outcome of the process. For example, people who 
sit on opposite sides of the table in negotiations are 
more likely to take a win-lose orientation than those 
who are interspersed around the table or all facing a 
whiteboard that symbolizes their common problem.
Another factor that can affect the negotiation 
process is time, including the length of the process 
and what the associated deadlines are. The longer 
the process, the more invested the parties will be in 
resolving the situation. However, this can also mean 
that the parties are more likely to make unwarranted 
concessions just to ensure that the negotiation will 
not fail. Similarly, deadlines may help negotiations 
stay on track so that a timely agreement is reached. 
On the other hand, deadlines may also make the par­
ties more willing to make unwarranted concessions, 
not allow sufficient time for a collaborative approach 
to succeed, or not give the parties sufficient time 
to gather the information they need for successful 
negotiations.
Finally, negotiations do not occur in a vacuum: 
They are closely watched by various stakeholders 
and even the general public. When negotiations are 
closely watched, the negotiators tend to be more 
competitive and less willing to make concisions. In 
addition, when they are being watched, negotiators 
are often more concerned about saving face than 
they are about reaching an optimal solution.
APPLICATIONS
As discussed above, preparation is one of the keys to 
successful negotiations. This, however, means not only 
information gathering, but mental preparation as well. 
It is frequently observed in the literature that one of 
the pitfalls in negotiations is overconfidence that one’s 
perceptions of the situation are truly reality. Research 
has found that negotiator’s predictions of their behav­
ior at the negotiating table are frequently incorrect. 
This is partially due to a tendency to take an optimistic 
view of the future and to hope for the best. In addi­
tion, people often do not fully understand the impact 
of their motivations and emotions on their behavior, 
including the desire to reach an agreement even at the 
cost of giving away more than they should. These fac­
tors lead to a situation of overconfidence that is not 
warranted by the actual negotiating situation.
To better predict one’s behavior in a negotiation, 
it is important to recognize that the assumptions 
and predictions about what will happen will not nec­
essarily be shown to be true in the actual situation 
and to develop ways to cope with the unexpected. 
Negotiations can be very emotionally charged situ­
ations. Although one might assume that one will 
remain calm under pressure, this will not necessar­
ily happen in actuality. To help one cope with the 
possibility of reacting in an emotional way during a 
negotiating situation, it is important — in advance 

Negotiations
Principles of Business: Management
278
— to determine coping mechanisms that can be 
employed. For example, when negotiating on what 
is an emotionally charged issue, it could be help­
ful to visualize how one would react in such a situ­
ation and what tactics could be taken to defuse the 
situation or keep it from escalating. In addition, one 
should have a best alternative to a negotiated agree­
ment (BATNA) in mind before negotiations. This is 
an alternative action that will be taken if a mutually 
satisfactory negotiated agreement cannot be reached 
(e.g., if the employees in the earlier example can­
not reach a satisfactory agreement, they are willing 
to strike). Having a BATNA enables the negotiator 
to have a back-up position to keep from making too 
many concessions in order to reach an agreement.
To help keep from being overconfident in a nego­
tiation situation, there are several things that one can 
do. First, it is important to collect as much informa­
tion about the other party, including their strengths, 
weaknesses, and motivations. Information is power, 
and the more one knows about one’s opponent, their 
strengths and weaknesses, their motivations, and the 
parameters within which they must work, the better 
one will be able to negotiate. Second, it is important 
to consider that one’s own assumptions may not be 
accurate and that the opposite might occur. In such 
a situation, it is helpful to have previously thought 
through the ramifications of potentially unexpected 
actions on the part of one’s opponent and how one 
will handle them. Third, it can be helpful to work 
with a colleague or other trusted person who can 
play devil’s advocate. This person can help the nego­
tiator think through his or her own assumptions and 
motivations and be better prepared for the actual 
negotiation.

ABSTRACT
Networks have become an integral part of most 
lives in the modern world of the twenty-first cen­
tury. There are several types of networks used for 
communications and information sharing including 
local area, metropolitan area, and wide area networks. 
Every network is linked through communications 
channels that may be physical channels (e.g., copper 
or fiber optic cables) or wireless channels (i.e., radio

waves). In addition, networks can be structured in a 
number of different ways through various architec­
tures that determine how the various components 
interact and cooperate. Networks have many appli­
cations for twenty-first-century businesses. General 
applications of networking include transmitting and 
receiving messages or documents electronically, data 
communications, providing an infrastructure for 
holding virtual meetings with participants who are 
geographically dispersed, and electronic commerce.
OVERVIEW
Networks have become an integral part of most lives 
in the modern world of the twenty-first century. For 
example, e-mail has become the standard mode of 
communication in many situations, and businesses 
send not only messages but documents, pictures, 
and audio/visual clips across the office and around 
the world with ease. In addition, the majority of con­
sumers now count on the Internet to compare and 
purchase goods and services rather than go to a phys­
ical storefront. Social media sites, such as Facebook, 
Twitter, and LinkedIn, have become important parts 
of expanding contacts and reaching out to a wider 
range of individuals all over the world. People not 
only use networking capabilities at home and at work 
but also take their laptops and smartphones with 
them on vacation, feeling adrift at the thought of not 
being able to keep in touch almost instantaneously. 
However, networks have other applications as well. In 
the workplace, networks enable employees to coor­
dinate their activities and to share data, information, 
and documents in an effort to increase the efficiency 
and effectiveness of the organization. This ability to 
share data and information quickly and accurately 
is increasingly essential to the success of businesses. 
Particularly as increasing numbers of businesses 
become active in the global marketplace, networks 
are becoming integral to work.
Types of Networks
Networks are sets of computers that are electronically 
linked together. Communications networks are sets 
of locations (or nodes) with concomitant hardware, 
software, and information that are linked together 
to form a system that transmits and receives infor­
mation. There are several types of networks used for 
communications and information sharing. Local area 
networks link multiple local computers to each other 
and various peripheral devices. Metropolitan area net­
works link computers over citywide distances at higher 
speeds than local area networks. Wide area networks 
link multiple computers that are widely ­dispersed and 
use high-speed, long-distance communications net­
works or satellites to transmit and receive data.

 Local Area Networks A local area network con­
sists of multiple desktop computers located near 
each other that link into a network. These net­
works are used to connect computers in an office 
or series of offices and span distances from a few 
hundred feet to a few miles. A local area network 
allows users to share files and peripheral devices 
such as printers, fax machines, or storage devices. 
The computers linked into the network are also 
referred to as workstations, clients, or nodes. They 
are connected to a server—a host computer for 
the network that provides services to the clients. 
The server typically has more storage capacity and 
can process at higher speeds than the client com­
puters. Cloud computing allows companies to use 
space on an external server, maintained by a pro­
vider, for both file storage and to deliver applica­
tions (Yang & Jia, 2013).

 Metropolitan Area Networks Metropolitan area 
networks transmit data and information citywide 
(up to 30 miles) and at greater speeds than a local 
area network. These networks are optimized for 
both voice and data transmissions and can, there­
fore, carry more forms of data than can be carried 
over local area networks, including voice, data, 
image, and video data. Metropolitan area net­
works typically operate over a city-wide network 
of fiber optic cables. These networks enable the 
metropolitan area network to provide high quality 
multimedia transmissions at higher speeds than is 
possible over local area networks.

 Wide Area Networks Wide area networks comprise 
multiple computers that are widely dispersed and 
that are linked into a network. These networks 
typically use high-speed, long-distance communi­
cations networks or satellites to connect the com­
puters within the network. Wide area networks can 
be used for a variety of applications, particularly 
when the client computers that need to be net­
worked are at a distance from each other. For ex­
ample, a retail chain may use a wide area network

to connect its stores across the country or 
across the world, allowing them to share inven-
tory and sales data and to send e-mail messages 
to each other. These networks can also be used 
to connect computerized cash registers that 
can be used to collect and transmit sales data 
at each location and transmit them to the com-
pany’s corporate headquarters as part of the 
closing procedure each day.
Wide area networks use services provided by a 
common carrier—a company that provides public 
communications transmission services. The speed 
at which the data are transmitted over the network 
is determined by the bandwidth. The higher the 
bandwidth of a transmission, the more quickly data 
can be transferred within the network. Bandwidth is 
expressed in thousands of bits of information per sec-
ond (kbps), millions of bits per second (mbps), or bil-
lions of bits per second (gbps). On a more practical 
level, a typical page of typed correspondence contains 
approximately 275 words, which translates to 2,000 
bytes or 16,000 bits of information. Transferring this 
amount of data over a 56 kbps modem takes approxi-
mately 0.28 seconds; transferring the same page over 
a high speed network transmitting at 1.544 mbps, 
however, only takes approximately 0.01 seconds. 
Although this may seem to be a small difference, busi-
ness documents are frequently significantly longer 
than one page. So, for example, transmission of a 600-
page document at 2400 Bps would take nearly two 
hours, at 56,000 Bps would take only five minutes, and 
at 1.544 mbps would take only 10.8 seconds. Similarly, 
higher bandwidths are necessary to transmit video 
transmissions. Wide area networks sometimes trans-
mit over a T-carrier, a very high-speed channel that 
connects lower-speed networks or computers at dif-
ferent sites or over fiber optic cables that allow even 
faster data transmission.
Network Channels
No matter the type, networks are linked through 
communications channels (also referred to as net-
work media). These channels may be physical chan-
nels (e.g., copper or fiber optic cables) or wireless 
channels (i.e., radio waves). There are a number of 
different types of media used to transmit data. The 
transmission speeds of some of these channels are 
given in Table 1.
Physical Communications Channels
There are three basic types of physical communica-
tions channels: twisted pair, coaxial, and fiber optic 
cable. Although these have different characteristics, 
it is the hardware and software attached to the net-
work that determines the actual speed of transmis-
sion. No matter how fast data can be transmitted over 
the network cables, if the information system on the 
end of the cable is slow, the actual receipt of the data 
will be concomitantly slow.

 Twisted pair cables are used in telephone wires 
and are so called because they are made of pairs 
of copper wire twisted together to form a cable. 
Twisted pair cable was designed for the transmis-
sion of voice and text messages and is considered 
by information technology specialists to be a voice-
grade medium. These channels transmit at a va-
riety of rates ranging from 100 Bps to 100 mbps 
depending on what the carrier determines is a fea-
sible speed of transmission for the cable.

 Coaxial cable is another commonly used cable for 
networks. This type of cable is made up of one or 
more central wire conductors surrounded by an 
insulator and sheathed in wire mesh or metal.

 Fiber optic cable uses light from a laser to transmit 
data, providing the fastest data transmission of the 
physical network media.
Wireless Communications Channels
In addition to physical network media, vari-
ous wireless channels are available. Wireless net-
works use radio waves sent over the open air or 
through space. Most wireless networks utilize

microwaves—high-frequency radio signals—for data 
transmission. Some wireless networks employ ter­
restrial stations that use relay towers about 30 miles 
apart. These stations must be unobstructed and have 
a clear line between them since microwaves travel in 
a straight line. Increasingly, wireless transmission is 
done using satellites. The microwaves are beamed 
from a terrestrial station to a communications satel­
lite, which in turn relays the signal to another terres­
trial station or stations.
Network Architectures
Networks can be structured in a number of different 
ways through various architectures that determine 
how the various components interact and cooper­
ate. Network architectures comprise the structure of 
a communications network, including how the vari­
ous components are linked, interact, and cooperate. 
Network architectures may be centralized, distrib­
uted, or a combination of the two.

 Centralized Architecture In a centralized architec­
ture, the server hosts all of the network’s hardware 
and software, performs all the network’s processing, 
and manages the network from a central site. In this 
type of architecture, the hardware and software fre­
quently are found in a centralized computer center.
 Distributed Architecture In a distributed architec­
ture, on the other hand, the various computers are 
at different locations and connected by a network. 
In this type of architecture, an application may run 
on one or more locations on the network simultane­
ously. For example, in a retail store with a distributed 
network, data on individual sales transactions may 
be automatically transmitted to a distribution center. 
In addition, the chain’s suppliers may also connect 
using their own networks to monitor inventory in the 
distribution centers and replenish them as necessary.
Both of these approaches to network architecture 
have advantages and disadvantages. Centralized sys­
tems are easier to manage, but distributed systems 
keep information where it is most needed. To lever­
age the advantages of both types of architectures, 
some enterprises use hybrid systems that combine 
the strengths of both approaches.
By 2014, a type of networking architecture that 
had been in various stages of development for several 
years began coming to the forefront: software-defined 
networking (SDN). This architecture gives program­
mers more immediate control over the way data and 
resources are operated within a network through the 
separation of the network’s control and forwarding 
functions (Kirkpatrick, 2013).
APPLICATIONS
Networks have many applications for twenty-first-cen­
tury businesses. In general, networks have four roles: 
transmitting and receiving messages or documents 
electronically, data communications, providing an 
infrastructure for holding virtual meetings with par­
ticipants who are geographically dispersed, and elec­
tronic commerce.
Electronic Message Transmission
Perhaps the best-known aspect of networking both in 
business and personal applications is electronic mail 
(e-mail). This network service transmits text messages 
from a sender to one or more recipients. The message 
is sent over the network and stored on a reserved area of 
space on a drive in the server or host computer that has 
been set aside for the recipient. This space is referred 
to as the recipient’s electronic mailbox. The message 
remains there until it is retrieved by the recipient. 
When the recipient logs onto his/her e-mail account, 
the system sends a notification that a new message has 
been received. The recipient can then retrieve and 
view the message, store it for later reference, forward 
it to other recipients, reply to the message, or delete it. 
E-mail messages can also be broadcast, that is, sent to 
a number of recipients simultaneously. This capabil­
ity cuts down on the amount of work that the sender 
needs to do to get information into the hands of multi­
ple people and also helps provide work groups, teams, 
and others who need to communicate with current 
information so that communications and projects can 
proceed more efficiently. In addition, e-mail enables 
people to send text and other documents electroni­
cally across the network.
Another frequently used application of network­
ing capabilities is voicemail. Whereas e-mail involves 
the transmission of text messages between a sender 
and recipients, voicemail involves the transmission 
of spoken messages. The sender speaks into an ordi­
nary telephone connected to the computer network. 
The message is then digitized and stored in the recip­
ient’s voice mailbox. The recipient can retrieve the

message using his/her phone. The message is then 
reconverted to an analog voice message and relayed 
to the recipient. Voice messages can be stored, 
replayed, or broadcast to multiple recipients.
Data Communications
Electronic Data Interchange
Networks can also facilitate the flow of money and 
other data between businesses or between custom­
ers and businesses. Electronic data interchange 
is a standard format that is used to exchange busi­
ness data such as price or product identification 
number. Electronic data interchange technology is 
particularly important for facilitating international 
commerce where paperwork required for interna­
tional trade creates costs of up to 7 percent of the 
value of the items being traded. With electronic data 
interchange technology, shippers, carriers, customs 
agents, and customers all can send and receive docu­
ments through electronic funds transfer, thereby 
saving both time and money for international 
transactions.
Electronic Funds Transfer
A similar network service is electronic funds trans­
fer—the electronic movement of money over a 
communications network is called electronic funds 
transfer. This service increasingly affects financial 
transactions. Credit card transactions are settled 
by electronic funds transfer between the user and 
the issuer of the credit card and payroll checks, gov­
ernment support checks, and other deposits can 
be deposited by electronic funds transfer. Because 
of such technologies, the Internet is also used for 
e-commerce to buy and sell goods or services—
including products and information retrieval 
services—electronically rather than through con­
ventional means.
Virtual Meeting Capabilities
Another service that can be provided by networks 
is videoconferencing. This service provides live 
two-way audio and video transmissions over the net­
work. Through videoconferencing, people who are 
geographically dispersed can meet together and 
participate in a meeting without the inconvenience 
or expense of travel. Video conferencing is much 
more than a simple audio/visual hookup, however. 
Through the use of the network, meeting partici­
pants can share documents, images, and even prod­
uct demonstrations. Information can be retrieved 
from a central database (a collection of data items 
used for multiple purposes and which is stored on a 
computer) and simultaneously shared with all con­
ference participants. Decentralized meetings can 
also be facilitated through the use of networks even 
without the audio hookup. In teleconferencing, 
meeting participants at different sites communicate 
with each other through the telephone. They use 
the network to share documents and other informa­
tion through an electronic bulletin board in near 
real time. Networks can also allow participants to 
use presentation software just as in a face-to-face 
meeting.
Electronic Commerce
The use of networks to support business is not only 
concerned with internal or business-to-business 
applications, however. E-commerce (i.e., electronic 
commerce) is the process of conducting of busi­
ness online through such transactions as sales and 
information exchange. One common application 
of e-commerce is online retailing and electronic 
storefronts as supported by networks. Customers 
visit a business’s website on the Internet and exam­
ine product pictures and information, compare 
different products, fill an electronic shopping cart, 
and checkout and pay for their purchases in much 
the same way that they would in a brick-and-mortar 
store. Another network application of e-commerce 
is the electronic market. This is a collection of indi­
vidual shops that can be accessed through a single 
location on the Internet that are the virtual equiva­
lent of shopping malls. The use of networks to sup­
port e-commerce offers many benefits to businesses. 
First, businesses are able to extend their geographic 
reach and literally reach potential customers around 
the globe without setting up operations in other loca­
tions. E-commerce can facilitate selling to a larger 
market as well as increasing the speed at which trans­
actions can take place. The networking capabilities 
of e-commerce also enable customers to make better 
informed decisions in a more timely manner, thereby 
helping the business’s cash flow and saving the cus­
tomer time.

Networks in Business
ABSTRACT
Networks are widely used in business today. Although 
many businesses use the Internet to market goods 
and services, an increasing number of businesses 
use an intranet, a smaller version of the Internet 
that is used by company employees to communicate 
with each other and to share data. Intranets are typi­
cally protected by firewalls that prevent unauthor­
ized access and keep company propriety or sensitive 
data or information confidential. Businesses can also 
share information with partners, customers, or other 
parties through an extranet, a part of an intranet 
that is available to authorized parties. By using net­
works, businesses can communicate more quickly, 
update information more accurately, and coordinate 
all members of a supply chain in order to work more 
efficiently and bring products or services to the cus­
tomer more expeditiously than is possible using tra­
ditional communications media.
OVERVIEW
In many ways, the use of networks has changed our lives. 
For example, in many situations, e-mail has obviated 
the need for surface mail, fax transmissions, or even 
phone calls, and provides us with almost instant access 
to friends, family, and colleagues. Similarly, data—
including documents, photos, and videos—can be eas­
ily shared as attachments to e-mails. Social networking 
allows us to keep track of friends and family. The World 
Wide Web allows us to easily find or share information, 
purchase or sell items, or perform a host of other tasks 
more quickly and easily than was possible before. Just as 
the Internet has transformed our lives, so, too, network 
technology has transformed the way that many organi­
zations—large and small—do business.
Communications Networks
Most organizations today have become “netcentric,” 
relying heavily on the use of computers, databases, 
and telecommunications to conduct their day-to-day 
business activities (Lucas, 2005). At its most basic, 
a network is a set of computers that are electroni­
cally linked together through communications lines 
(e.g., telephone lines, fiber optic cables) or wireless 
technology (i.e., radio signals over the air or through 
space). Businesses use networks to share data, docu­
ments, and programs or to allow employees to com­
municate with one another or with providers or 
customers.
One common use of network technology is e-mail 
communication. Employees are able to send e-mails 
with or without attachments, just as they would have 
picked up the phone or used inter-office mail a few 
decades ago. Network technology allows organiza­
tions to take this a step further and actually set up 
virtual teams in which team members do not always 
meet face to face but conduct their activities over 
a distance. In virtual teams, the members are geo­
graphically or organizationally dispersed and inter­
act primarily through communication technology. 
For example, large engineering programs can use 
experts from around the country—or around the 
world—who communicate via e-mail or secure net­
works, sharing documents, giving briefings, dis­
cussing problems, and making decisions all using 
network technology.
Similarly, individuals in different parts of the sup­
ply chain can communicate over networks without 
having to deal with the other members directly. For 
example, a retail clerk in a point of sale location can 
use a network to check supply quantity at a ware­
house without ever talking directly to warehouse 
personnel. If the item he needs is available, he can 
place an order directly from his terminal. The ware­
house manager, in turn, can order more stock over a 
network from her supplier who, in turn, arranges for 
transportation for the stock through a network.
The use of networks has changed the business 
model used by many organizations. Because net­
work technology can speed or ease communications 
between individuals, departments, or business part­
ners, it can be possible for management to eliminate 
functions from the organization and outsource them 
to other organizations that can do the task more cost-
effectively. For example, a retailer may sell products 
directly to customers at a brick-and-mortar store, but 
may also sell to customers over the Internet. The 
retailer may also outsource the manufacturing of the 
products that it sells to other firms, and communi­
cate with them over the Internet or other network.

The retailer may outsource billing to yet another 
company and communicate with its bank through 
another network.
Types of Networks
LAN, MAN & WAN
In general, a network is a set of locations (or nodes) 
with concomitant hardware, software, and informa-
tion that are linked together to form a system that 
transmits and receives information and data. There 
are three types of communications networks. Local 
area networks (LANs) connect multiple computers 
that are located near one another and linked into 
a network that allows the users to share files and 
peripheral devices such as printers, fax machines, 
and storage devices. LAN technology was developed 
after the utility of personal computers for business 
became recognized and organizations wanted to be 
able to share information and access data for the 
organization. For example, a LAN may be used to 
link multiple workstations within a department as 
well as control a common printer.
Another type of network used by businesses is the 
metropolitan area network (MAN). These networks 
are larger than LANs and transmit data and infor-
mation citywide (typically around 30 miles) and at 
greater speeds than a LAN. In addition, MANs are 
capable of transmitting voice, data, image, and video 
data, although they are typically optimized for voice-
data transmission. Rather than using telephone lines, 
MANs typically use fiber optic cables. Another type of 
network used by businesses is the wide area network 
(WAN). These comprise multiple computers that 
are widely dispersed and that are linked into a net-
work. WANs typically use high speed, long distance 
communications networks or satellites to connect the 
computers within the network.
Intranets & Extranets
Certainly, the Internet is one valuable network tool 
now widely used by businesses. Increasingly, a busi-
ness needs to have a presence on the web (e.g., a 
homepage) in order to be competitive. However, the 
Internet is only one type of network that is used by 
businesses. In addition, some organizations set up 
private networks to serve their needs. An intranet is 
a private network similar to the Internet, and is set 
up for a given enterprise. Intranets are used to share 
information and provide computing resources within 
an organization. Intranets may also be used to facili-
tate document sharing for workgroups and virtual 
teams. An intranet requires the installation of serv-
ers and clients using Internet protocols (e.g., TCP/
IP, http), and a web browser. As with the Internet, an 
intranet may comprise several networked LANs or 
use the leased line of a WAN.
Typically, an intranet contains proprietary infor-
mation. To prevent those outside the organization 
from gaining unauthorized access to information that 
the organization does not wish to disclose to the pub-
lic, information on an intranet is blocked by a firewall 
so that the information is only available to employees, 
other stakeholders, or other parties whom the organi-
zation authorizes. A firewall is a special-purpose soft-
ware program or piece of computer hardware that is 
designed to prevent authorized access to or from a 
private network. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) 
deliver more granular control than traditional fire-
walls but have their own set of challenges (Erdheim, 
2013). However, not all parts of an intranet need to 
be kept private. Intranets also provide platforms that 
can be used to develop and distribute applications for 
use by anyone with a web browser.
When part of an intranet is made accessible to out-
side parties (e.g., customers, suppliers, partners), it is 
referred to as an extranet. Extranets can be used to 
exchange large volumes of data, share catalogs with a 
select list of users (e.g., wholesalers, other members 
of an industry), collaborate with other companies on 
joint projects or ventures, provide limited access to 
other select companies, or share information with 
partner organizations.
Many organizations use intranet and extranet 
technology. For example, rather than merely listing 
names and phone numbers, intranet phone directo-
ries can also include a photograph and job descrip-
tion for each employee.
APPLICATIONS
Business Uses for Networks
Businesses can use networks for a wide variety of 
purposes, including the transmission of messages, 
the communication of data, hosting virtual meet-
ings, and conducting electronic commerce. The 
most common application of networks is electronic 
mail (e-mail) capabilities that allow employees to 

Principles of Business: Management
Networks in Business
287
communicate with one another, customers, sup­
pliers, or partners electronically rather than using 
older methods such as faxes, phone calls, interoffice 
mail, or surface mail. E-mail also allows messages to 
be broadcast to a number of recipients simultane­
ously. This capability is advantageous from a business 
standpoint because it cuts down on the time that the 
sender needs to transmit the message multiple times, 
gets information into the hands of a large number 
of recipients quickly and simultaneously, and facili­
tates the work of groups. In addition to sending text 
messages, e-mail also allows senders to transmit docu­
ments, video clips, photographs, drawings, and other 
information as attachments. Some email providers, 
such as Google, even have their own drives (Google 
Drive), on which a network of people can edit docu­
ments in real time. This reduces the need to make 
and distribute hard copies and also allows groups to 
work or comment on common documents together, 
reducing the need for coordination. Messages can 
also be transmitted via voice mail, in much the same 
way as one would leave a message on a telephone 
answering machine. Voice mail messages can be 
stored, replayed, or broadcast to multiple recipients.
Virtual Workgroups
Such electronic capabilities make the job of the indi­
vidual employee easier and facilitate communications 
across the enterprise. Networks can be used to facili­
tate virtual meetings and virtual teams and workgroups 
in which the members are geographically or organi­
zationally dispersed and members interact primarily 
through communication technology rather than meet­
ing face-to-face. This use of network technology can 
save the enterprise money associated with travel costs 
as well as with costs associated with moving expenses 
or hiring. Virtual teams can incorporate members of 
the enterprise and also its partners through extranet 
technology. 
Through 
videoconferencing 
(vcon) 
and online collaborative tools like Skype and WebEx 
(Davis, 2012), employees or colleagues who are geo­
graphically dispersed can participate in a meeting 
without the inconvenience or expense of travel. In 
addition, meeting participants can share documents, 
images, and even product demonstrations without the 
need for a face-to-face meeting. Even if some of the 
meeting or workgroup participants do not have vcon 
technology, they can communicate with each other 
through the web or telephone and use the network to 
share documents and other information through an 
electronic bulletin board or use presentation software 
just as in a face-to-face meeting.
Data Communications for E-Commerce
Another common business use of networks is for 
data communications. The standard format for trans­
mitting business data (e.g., price, part number) is 
electronic data interchange (EDI). This technology 
can facilitate commerce not only across the country 
but across the globe. EDI helps facilitate the data 
exchange necessary for international commerce, and 
reduce the cost of global commerce by reducing the 
cost of the associated paperwork, which can add up 
to 7 percent to the value of the items being traded. 
Similarly, electronic funds transfer can be used 
to move money over a communications network. 
Electronic funds transfer facilitates international 
business transactions, and also affects consumers on 
a local level. For example, the worldwide PLUS ATM 
network can be accessed by over one billion credit 
and debit cards. These transactions are settled elec­
tronically by the transfer of funds between the user 
and the issuer of the card. Electronic funds transfer 
can also be used to deposit payroll checks, govern­
ment support checks, and other deposits without the 
need to physically handle the currency.
Electronic funds transfer has enabled another 
use of networks for businesses: electronic commerce 
(e-commerce), the conducting of business (e.g., 
sales, information exchange) over the Internet. For 
example, many businesses today have electronic 
storefronts supported by network technologies. 
These electronic storefronts may be in addition to or 
in place of brick-and-mortar point-of-sale locations. 
In electronic commerce, customers visit a business’s 
web site on the Internet and examine the online 
catalog, compare products, fill an electronic shop­
ping cart, and check out and pay for their purchases 
in much the same way as if they were in a physical 
store. Network technology also facilitates electronic 
markets, or a collection of individual shops that can 
be accessed through a single location on the Internet 
that are the virtual equivalent of shopping malls. 
Through the use of e-commerce, businesses are able 
reach potential customers around the globe with­
out setting up satellite operations in other locations. 
In addition, e-commerce can increase the speed 
at which business transactions take place, thereby

helping not only the business’s cash flow but also 
saving the customer time and (potentially) money 
because the business does not need to have a brick-
and-mortar storefront.
Example: Cisco Systems
One example of an organization that has successfully 
incorporated networking technology into its business 
model is Cisco Systems (Senn, 2004). Cisco emerged 
as a world leader in networking technology, design­
ing and selling networking hardware (e.g., routers, 
switches) and network management software to 
other enterprises for use in creating intranets and 
connecting to Internet. In part, Cisco’s success has 
been attributed to its catching the Internet wave in 
the mid-1990s. Cisco created a new form of supply 
chain to link customers, manufacturers, and other 
partners using Internet technology. This use of net­
working technology allowed Cisco to cultivate and 
leverage close relationships with other organizations 
in order to provide its customers with the products 
that they need without having to hire the full range 
of experts or facilities that would be required for 
them to provide the same range of services them­
selves. The members of this supply chain, in a sense, 
were partners, including manufacturers, assemblers, 
distributors, resellers, and transporters. Working in 
cooperation with these other enterprises, Cisco was 
able to integrate various supply chains by intercon­
necting its business systems and key information tech­
nology applications. This resulted in an automated 
order acceptance and fulfillment process which 
helped Cisco achieve its reputation in the field.
Cisco’s suppliers/partners made all of the com­
ponents for Cisco, performed nearly all of the subas­
sembly work, and performed more than half of the 
final assembly. Rather than using e-mail, or phone 
calls to coordinate their activities, Cisco and its part­
ner-suppliers communicate electronically over the 
network for all phases of the operation. For example, 
once a product is finished and ready for shipping, the 
partner-supplier notifies a transportation company 
within the system and ships the product directly to 
the customer. Because communications are handled 
electronically, there are fewer opportunities for error 
along the supply chain. Cisco is able to work more 
efficiently because the same information is shared 
with all partners in the supply chain, requiring less 
coordination and updating. Further, information can 
be shared over the network in real time. As a result, 
changes that occur in one part of the supply chain are 
immediately disseminated to all parts of the supply 
chain. This allows the entire network of organizations 
to respond more expediently to changes. Cisco has 
moved into promising new businesses: cloud comput­
ing, unified enterprise IT systems, mobile device man­
agement, and TelePresence (Preimesberger, 2013). It 
has also initiated the Internet of Everything project, 
which seeks to connect people, data, and processes 
like never before, increasing the networking capabili­
ties of devices and the diverse peoples who use them.
CONCLUSION
Networks are widely used in business today. They can 
be as simple as the posting of a home page on the 
World Wide Web to advertise the company’s prod­
ucts and services or the use of the Internet to provide 
e-mail capabilities. Many organizations take this a step 
further, however, and link together their employees 
with an intranet, a smaller version of the Internet 
that is used by company employees to communicate 
with each other and to share data. Intranets are typi­
cally protected by firewalls that prevent unauthorized 
access and keep company propriety or sensitive data or 
information confidential. In some cases, however, the 
enterprise may want to share some information with 
other parties such as partners, customers, or industry 
members. In this case, they may develop an extranet, 
or part of the intranet that is available to these parties.
Network technology is much more than a high 
tech replacement for older communication meth­
ods. By using networks, businesses can communicate 
more quickly, update information more accurately, 
and coordinate all members of a supply chain in 
order to work more efficiently and bring products or 
services to the customer more expeditiously than was 
previously possible.

O
Operations Management
ABSTRACT
Operations management comprises those areas of 
management that are concerned with the productiv­
ity, quality, and cost in the operations function as well 
as strategic planning for the organization. This disci­
pline covers not only manufacturing processes, but 
support processes that add value to the product or 
service as well as the management of the entire supply 
chain. There are a number of ways that organizations 
can streamline their operations to meet the demands 
of today’s marketplace. However, for these to have any 
significant or lasting effect, they must be done within 
a coordinated strategy for both short and long-term 
organizational effectiveness. There are a number of 
tools and techniques that can be used by managers to 
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of business 
operations. These include lean manufacturing, total 
quality management, and business process reengi­
neering strives to improve the effectiveness and effi­
ciency of the various processes within an organization.
OVERVIEW
Business organizations exist to provide something 
of value to their stakeholders. For stockholders, this 
may mean profitability and return on investment. For 
employees, this may mean job security and a wage 
that is at or above industry standards. For distribu­
tors and suppliers, this may mean sufficient com­
merce to keep their own operations going. To meet 
these disparate objectives, organizations need to be 
able to offer a product or service of value to the cus­
tomer, whether it is light-weight running shoes, steel 
rivets, or consulting services. Operations manage­
ment comprises those areas of management that are 
concerned with productivity, quality, and cost in the 
operations function (i.e., activities necessary to trans­
form inputs such as business transactions and infor­
mation into outputs such as completed transactions) 
as well as strategic planning for the organization. 
Business operations include any processes that trans­
form any inputs such as labor, capital, materials, and 
energy into products and services that are of value 
in the marketplace. Operations management draws 
from multiple disciplines in order to optimize the 
effectiveness of operations within the organization.
Operations management is more than an empha­
sis on manufacturing processes. There are many 
activities within an organization that add value to the 
end product or service but that do not directly pro­
vide goods or services to the customer. For example, 
the accounting department adds value to the organi­
zation’s activities by making sure that the employees, 
distributors, and suppliers are all paid promptly and 
accurately. Human resources also supports business 
operations by developing and implementing poli­
cies and procedures that ensure that employees are 
treated fairly and are motivated to use their skills and 
talents in helping the business become a high per­
forming organization. In addition, operations man­
agement is not only concerned with the operations 
within the single organizational entity, but also of the 
smooth and efficient operations of the entire supply 
chain. This is the network of organizations involved 
in the production, delivery, and sale of a product. 
The supply chain may include suppliers, manufactur­
ers, storage facilities, transporters, and retailers. The 
supply chain includes the flow of tangible goods and 
materials, funds, and information between the orga­
nizations in the network, all of which adds value to 
the product or service being offered to the customer.
Historically, operations management focused on 
providing the highest possible quality for the low­
est possible price. Increasingly, however, customers 
are also demanding greater product variety, short 
life cycles, and other qualities that require organiza­
tions to more closely examine their operations for 
ways to better meet the needs of the marketplace. In 
addition, globalization has brought with it increased

competition from overseas operations that are able 
to provide products or services at lower cost. This 
results not only in greater competition but also in the 
need to put even more emphasis on optimizing the 
effectiveness and efficiency of operations in order to 
stay viable in the marketplace.
There are a number of ways that organizations can 
streamline their operations to meet the demands of 
today’s marketplace. However, for these methods to 
have any significant or lasting effect, they must be 
done as part of a coordinated strategy designed to 
improve both short and long-term organizational 
effectiveness. A strategy is a plan of action to help the 
organization reach its goals and objectives, including 
organizational effectiveness and marketplace viabil­
ity. A good business strategy should be based on the 
rigorous analysis of empirical data, including market 
needs and trends, competitor capabilities and offer­
ings, and the organization’s resources and abilities. 
The strategic planning process helps the organiza­
tion determine what goals to set and how to reach 
them. This process also allows the organization to 
determine and articulate its long-term goals and to 
develop a plan to use the company’s resources — 
including materials, equipment and technology, and 
personnel — in reaching these goals.
Because of its concern with organizational perfor­
mance and effectiveness, one of the tasks of opera­
tions management is to set the strategy — including 
goals and objectives — of the organization. Strategic 
planning is the process of determining the best way to 
accomplish the goals of the organization. Goals and 
objectives define in practical terms what the organiza­
tion would like to be within a specific period of time. 
Determining the organization’s business goals requires 
an examination of all the organization’s operations 
and processes to determine which add value to the 
organization’s products or services and which do not.
APPLICATIONS
There are a number of tools and techniques that can 
be used by managers to improve the effectiveness 
and efficiency of business operations. These include 
lean manufacturing, total quality management, and 
business process reengineering. Lean manufacturing 
strives to eliminate waste and continually improve 
productivity. Total quality management strives to 
improve customer satisfaction by improving quality. 
Business process reengineering strives to improve the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the various processes 
within an organization.
Lean Manufacturing
Lean manufacturing is manufacturing philosophy 
that attempts to eliminate all waste from production 
processes. The objectives of lean manufacturing are to 
lower production costs, increase output, and shorten 
lead times. To do this, lean manufacturing efforts 
attempt to do several things. First, lean manufactur­
ing efforts attempt to reduce defects and unnecessary 
physical waste during the production process. This 
includes reducing the excess or unnecessary use of 
raw materials or other inputs, reducing the number 
of defects and their associated costs, and reducing or 
eliminating product features that are not of value to 
the customer. Lean manufacturing efforts also attempt 
to reduce manufacturing lead times and production 
cycle times in the manufacturing process. This can 
result in less cost associated with storage of materials 
and products and the ability to get products to the cus­
tomer in a more timely manner. Similarly, lean manu­
facturing attempts to minimize inventory throughout 
the production process. This practice helps reduce the 
amount of working capital needed to sustain opera­
tions. Just-in-time manufacturing is a manufacturing 
philosophy that strives to eliminate waste and continu­
ally improve productivity. The primary characteris­
tics of just-in-time manufacturing include having the 
required inventory only when it is needed for manu­
facturing and reducing lead times and set up times. 
In addition, lean manufacturing attempts to optimize 
the use of equipment and space to reduce or eliminate 
bottlenecks in manufacturing processes and optimize 
the rate of production. Lean manufacturing also exam­
ines business processes (see below) and their effect on 
the productivity of employees. Under the lean manu­
facturing philosophy, idle time is reduced and workers 
efforts are streamlined so that they contribute directly 
to the value of the product or service.
One lean manufacturing approach is the Six Sigma 
process. This term is a statistical reference to how far 
(i.e, the number of standard deviations, symbolized 
by the Greek letter sigma, “s”) a data point is from the 
middle of the normal curve. Six sigma distance signi­

of the time, or has only 3.4 defects per million. Six 
Sigma projects set this as the goal toward which man­
ufacturing and quality control efforts in the organiza­
tion are focused.
Six Sigma programs are targeted at reducing costs 
by making changes before defects or problems occur. 
As part the Six Sigma program, employees and man­
agers are trained in statistical analysis, project man­
agement, and problem solving methodology. These 
skills are used to help them reduce defects in their 
products. Most organizations that have implemented 
Six Sigma programs report increased profitability 
resulting from lower production costs from doing 
the thing correctly the first time in combination with 
reduced costs for not having to redo the work previ­
ously done.
Total Quality Management
Another strategy for increasing the quality of goods 
and services and concomitant customer satisfaction 
is Total Quality Management (TQM). TQM attempts 
to improve the quality of products or services by rais­
ing awareness of quality concerns across the orga­
nization. This management strategy emphasizes 
developing an organizational environment that sup­
ports innovation and creativity as well as taking risks 
to meet customer demands using such techniques as 
participative problem solving that includes not only 
managers, but employees and customers as well.
There are five cornerstones to TQM: The product, 
the process that allows the product to be produced, 
the organization that provides the proper environ­
ment needed for the process to work, the leadership 
that guides the organization, and commitment to 
excellence throughout the organization. To be suc­
cessful, TQM programs need to consider all five of 
these primary emphases. To help ensure the success 
of the TQM strategy, it is necessary that an environ­
ment of quality be fostered within the organization. 
This requires not only an emphasis on the efficiency 
of processes, but also an emphasis on consistency, 
integrity, and other positive interpersonal relation­
ship skills. To foster the teamwork necessary to bring 
about high quality, TQM encourages organizations 
to implement a decentralized authority structure 
where decisions are made close to those affected and 
all have a chance to participate in the process. This 
practice helps employees feel part of the system and 
that they are a vital part of the organization, not just 
hirelings. Ownership of team members working on 
the product can also be fostered by increasing the 
flow of communication across all levels of the organi­
zation and providing each employee the training that 
s/he needs to successfully add value to the product.
TQM looks not only at the bottom line in terms of 
profits or other relevant numbers, but also helps link 
the concepts of value to the customer with the cost 
of the product. This practice can help with market 
positioning and increasing market share. This can be 
enabled by continually assessing the marketplace of 
the organization’s product vis a vis the organization’s 
skills and resources to better position the organiza­
tion to excel in the marketplace.
Business Process Reengineering
Business process reengineering is a management 
approach that strives to improve the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the various processes within an orga­
nization. Business process reengineering is a radical 
rethinking and redesign of business processes so that 
they achieve dramatic improvements in critical orga­
nizational performance criteria such as cost, quality, 
service, and speed. To be successful, business process 
reengineering requires organizations to reexamine 
the assumptions underlying their business operations 
and to question why they do things the way that they 
do. The purpose of this analysis is to get at the root 
of any business process problems that the organiza­
tion is experiencing. This will allow managers to rein­
vent the way that things are being done as opposed 
to modifying current practices to be somewhat more 
effective. This analysis often reveals obsolete, errone­
ous, or inappropriate practices or procedures that do 
not add value to the product or service being offered 
by the business.
While business process reengineering is not 
appropriate for every organization, it is most appro­
priate where more traditional methods fail or where 
there is a major discrepancy between where the orga­
nization is and where the organization needs to be. 
Businesses that are in serious trouble can often ben­
efit from business process reengineering. Symptoms 
of this serious trouble can include having costs that 
are significantly higher the competition’s, customer 
service that is causing the organization to lose a 
significant number of customers, or failure rates 
that are significantly above those for the industry. 
Organizations that find themselves in such situations 

Principles of Business: Management

have little choice than to perform a major overhaul 
of their business processes if they want to be viable. 
In addition, organizations that are not yet in such 
dire straits but that are headed on a trajectory to that 
condition can also often benefit from reengineer­
ing efforts. Symptoms of these situations include 
increased competition or competitors that have sig­
nificantly improved their offerings or new customer 
needs that cannot be adequately met by the current 
business processes. Business process reengineering 
may often enable organizations to avoid falling into 
the first category where reengineering is mandatory 
if the organization is to survive. Not only failing or 
inefficient organizations can benefit from reengi­
neering efforts, however: Top performing organiza­
tions with aggressive management that wants to take 
them further may also benefit from this analysis and 
redesign. Business process reengineering in highly 
successful organizations can help them further con­
solidate their position in the marketplace and create 
further barriers to their competitors.
The goal of business process reengineering 
efforts is to improve the effectiveness of the organi­
zation. This is commonly demonstrated in a num­
ber of ways. For example, reengineering frequently 
results in several jobs being consolidated into one. 
Business process reengineering efforts also often 
change processes so that workers who better under­
stand the situation can make decisions rather than 
submitting these up the line for a supervisor to con­
sider. Similarly, business process reengineering often 
results in work being performed where it makes the 
most sense. This situation results in less delays, lower 
overhead costs, and higher job satisfaction for the 
employees. As a result, reengineered processes can 
help improve customer satisfaction by providing 
quick resolution to their problems.
One of the basic tenets of the business process 
reengineering process is that steps in any business 
process must be performed in a natural order and 
all the steps must add value to the product or ser­
vice rather than activity for the sake of activity. So, 
for example, a manufacturing company process 
might analyze the customer requirements and then 
translate these into internal product codes, transmit 
this information to various plants and warehouses, 
receive the various components, assemble the com­
ponents into a finished product, and deliver and 
install the equipment, requiring the involvement 
of a different organization for each step in the pro­
cess. Although these steps might traditionally be per­
formed sequentially, if some of the data collected are 
not needed until delivery, time could be saved by not 
waiting until all of these steps were completed before 
starting the rest of the process.
Reengineered processes frequently have different 
versions that take into account various situations so 
that value is added to the product or service and the 
customer is better served. Although standardization 
of business process works fine in an assembly line, 
many jobs today do not need this degree of structure. 
For example, clerks in a retail store could be given 
the authority to take care of customer problems at 
the point of sale rather than making the customer 
go to the customer service department or waiting for 
a manager to come and authorize a simple activity. 
Similarly, a technician on a technical help line might 
be given the authority to treat customers according 
to their individual needs rather than going through 
a pre-ordained script. In this way, reengineering pro­
cesses reduce the amount of time for the transaction. 
This results in lower costs for the organization as well 
as increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Organization Design
ABSTRACT
Organization design is the process of structuring 
the organization in a way that facilitates employee 
productivity and supports the organization in reach­
ing its goals. The basic building blocks of organiza­
tional structure are division of labor, centralization 
of authority, and formalization. The organization can 
also be departmentalized functionally or divisionally. 
However, the requirements of today’s electronically-
enabled organizations have resulted in changes 
in the way that some organizations are structured. 
Matrix, network, and even virtual approaches are 
becoming more common. Organization design is an 
iterative process, however. As the organization grows 
and changes, the design may need to be reconsid­
ered in order to keep the organization competitive.
OVERVIEW
Not every organization is created equally. Universities 
have formal organizational structures at the top of 
the hierarchy, but individual professors are given 
the authority to evaluate students and assign grades. 
Banks are run by strict rules and the individual tellers 
must follow strict procedures for fund disbursement, 
record keeping, and other tasks. Engineering firms 
are often run as teams that direct their own activities,

with each person reporting both to a functional or 
departmental manager (e.g., programming depart­
ment) and to a project manager (e.g., widget devel­
opment project).
Depending on what they are trying to accomplish 
— e.g., encourage creativity, mass produce products, 
provide services — different types of organizations 
need to be structured differently. These structures 
include how labor is divided among employees, how 
communication flows both down and up the organi­
zational hierarchy, and how formal power is consoli­
dated or distributed. The design of the organization 
is the structure through which it is organized to 
conduct its business. Organization design sets limits 
on how work can be accomplished. An appropriate 
organization design can support employees in meet­
ing organizational goals by giving them the freedom 
or the structure necessary to perform their tasks. For 
example, a team-based structure often works well for 
creative tasks where employees working together can 
experience the synergy that results in an outcome 
that is greater than they could have developed as 
individuals. An inappropriate organization design, 
on the other hand, can hinder the employees in 
their tasks and keep the organization from reaching 
its goals. For example, giving employees too much 
freedom in a bank could lead to bad or inconsistent 
decisions about lending, poor record keeping, and a 
resultant lack of profits for shareholders.
The design of an organization involves consider­
ation of several things, including the division of labor 
and concomitant patterns of coordination of work 
activities, centralization and the structure of power 
relationships, and the degree of formalization of the 
organization. Division of labor is the way that work 
in the organization is divided into separate jobs. The 
more that work is subdivided, the greater the degree 
of specialization the individual employee needs to be 
able to do the job well. The development of a simula­
tor to teach aircraft mechanics how to maintain and 
repair a fighter jet, for example, would require the 
inputs of numerous types of employees, including 
the subject matter experts who know what tasks are 
involved in these tasks, the training specialists who 
determine the best way to teach these tasks to stu­
dents, the engineers who know how to turn the train­
ers’ requirements into a piece of equipment that can 
be used to teach these tasks, the computer program­
mers who write the programs that run the simulator 
and present the information to students, and the 
production workers who actually put together the 
equipment for delivery to the customer. In addition 
to the workers performing the tasks, there are usually 
supervisors for each type of job. These individuals 
understand the nature of the work to be done, can 
support the employees in their tasks and make sure 
that the needs of the organization are met.
When jobs are divided in this way, they also need 
to be coordinated so that the work done by the indi­
vidual employees or groups will fit together to cre­
ate the work product needed by the organization. 
There are several general ways to coordinate work. 
Every organization uses informal communication 
when employees share information about tasks they 
are working on or when they form mutual ways to 
coordinate their work activities. Although informal 
communication can be quick and easy, it tends to 
work best when the organization is small and there 
are few barriers to communication. The mom-and-
pop grocery store on the corner, for example, is 
more likely to use informal communication to coor­
dinate the activities of workers than they are to have 
a formal set of procedures that cover every possible 
task. No matter the size of the organization, how­
ever, informal communication can occur directly 
(e.g., Harvey tells Chuck that he needs him to close 
out the cash register for the day) or through liaison 
or integrator roles (e.g., the project leader of the 
simulator development team encourages the vari­
ous work groups to communicate with each other 
and coordinate their activities). Coordination can 
also be done through a formal hierarchy, where for­
mal organizational power is given to an individual 
who directs work and allocates resources. This often 
is done through direct supervision (e.g., George’s 
boss tells him to finish the report by the end of the 
day) or through the corporate structure (e.g., the 
head of the Zenda operation of the organization 
coordinates the work for the organization in that 
country). Coordination can also be accomplished 
through standardization of skills, processes, or out­
puts. In this approach to coordination, the organi­
zation sets policies and procedures for dealing with 
various common activities. This is helpful in routine 
situations (e.g., the receiver in each of the organiza­
tion’s stores enters information into the computer 
in the same format), but is not so helpful when 
unusual circumstances arise.

296
The power structure within the organization 
is determined by its span of control and degree of 
centralization. Span of control is the number of 
employees that report directly to a supervisor in the 
next level up in the organization. At one time it was 
thought that a narrow span of control of 20 employ­
ees or less was the best approach to structuring an 
organization. Research has found, however, that in 
today’s environment, the average span of control in 
effective organizations is 31. The most appropriate 
span of control will depend on what the organiza­
tion is trying to accomplish and what types of peo­
ple it employs. Larger spans of control are harder to 
supervise. However, when the employees self-manage 
(either as professionals or as self-managing work 
teams), this task becomes easier.
Another characteristic of an organization’s struc­
ture is the degree to which formal decision-making 
power is centralized or carried out by a small group 
of people. In a centralized organization, a very lim­
ited number of individuals — usually at the top of 
the organizational hierarchy — have the power to 
make decisions. This is particularly true in smaller 
or emerging organizations where the founder or 
CEO tends to make most, if not all, of the decisions. 
However, as an organization grows, one person (or 
even a small group of people) is no longer able to 
make all the decisions, so the authority is distributed 
throughout the organization. For example, in a mul­
tinational firm it is logical to have some of the deci­
sions made at a local level. Similarly, decisions about 
various activities can be made at a departmental or 
operational level.
Finally, organizations differ on the degree to which 
they formalize behavior through the imposition of 
rules, policies, practices, procedures, or formal train­
ing. Formalization can help employees know how to 
do their jobs. It can also help customers know that 
they are getting the same product no matter which of 
the organization’s stores they patronize. A franchise 
coffee shop, for example, may specify the tempera­
ture to which the coffee is kept heated, how fre­
quently the coffee is brewed, how much milk is added 
to a latte, and so forth. Formalization is more effective 
in organizations where employees’ tasks are routine. 
So, for example, it is easier to formalize an organiza­
tion such as a fast food franchise than it is to formal­
ize a think tank. Although formalization can make an 
organization’s processes more efficient, it can have 
the opposite effect when an unusual situation arises 
and a variance from the normal procedure is needed.
Although very small or emerging companies can 
function effectively with a simple structure, as the 
organization expands and grows it is useful to group 
employees together to perform common tasks. This 
facilitates supervision of employees and coordina­
tion of their work, helps in resource allocation, and 
provides common goals and measures of perfor­
mance. There are several traditional ways to orga­
nize employees. The functional structure organizes 
employees around their knowledge or skills (e.g., 
the engineering department, the production depart­
ment). This approach to structuring an organization 
makes supervision easier and can help foster profes­
sional identity. However, the functional approach 
to organizational structure can also result in a situ­
ation where the goals of the unit are given priority 
over the goals of the organization. The very intra-unit 
cohesiveness fostered by functional structuring can 
also lead to increased conflict and communication 
difficulties with other departments. Another way to 
structure an organization is through the creation 
of divisions. Divisions can be created based on geo­
graphic location (e.g., the US division vs. the Zenda 
division), clients (e.g., the hospital division vs. the 
consumer division), or products (e.g., the widget 
division vs. the gizmo division). Like functional struc­
tures, divisional structures can encourage a feeling of 
camaraderie and belongingness within the group. In 
addition, such divisional structures support growth 
and increased complexity better than do functional 
structures. However, this approach to organizational 
structure also creates the requirement for dupli­
cate knowledge (e.g., each division needs a human 
resources function). As with functional structures, 
the divisional structure also results in more commu­
nication problems across groups.
Another type of organization that is used in 
many complex organizations — particularly those

297
that work on time-limited contracts — is the matrix 
structure. This approach to organizational structure 
combines the features of the functional organization 
and the divisional organization. In a matrix struc­
ture, employees typically are hired for a functional 
department (e.g., programming, engineering, pro­
duction). They are brought together on a temporary 
basis, however, as functional teams (e.g., the widget 
contract) or as part of a division. This means that 
each employee actually reports to two bosses: the 
functional boss (e.g., the programming department 
head) and the divisional boss (e.g., the widget proj­
ect manager). Matrix structures have the advantage 
of efficient deployment of talent throughout the 
organization. This approach to organization design 
also can help the organization to be more flexible 
and efficient. However, this approach requires more 
coordination than the simpler approaches of func­
tional or divisional structures. The dual-reporting 
relationship can be difficult to manage and the very 
fluidity of the design that is attractive to the organiza­
tion can be stressful to the employee.
APPLICATIONS
Organization design for the 21st Century
Globalization, e-commerce, the ability to telecom­
mute, and the high tech nature of many jobs have 
changed the way that many organizations do busi­
ness. This fact, in turn, impacts the way that the 
organizations need to be structured in order to best 
support the high performance of the employees and 
the success of the organization. The strict military 
model of command and control that was often used 
in the past does not work as well for today’s organiza­
tions comprised of highly creative or highly educated 
employees. As a result, new paradigms for organiza­
tional structure are emerging.
Team-based structures (also called lateral, cluster, 
or circle structures) are departmentalized with a flat 
span of control and little formalization. The work 
in these organizations is performed by self-directed 
work teams — cross-functional groups that work with­
out typical management supervision. When teams 
work well, they can achieve synergy, producing prod­
ucts or ideas that are greater than those that could 
have been accomplished by the individuals alone. An 
increasing number of organizations are finding the 
team-based structure to be a flexible way to respond 
to the needs of the organization and to reduce the 
levels in the managerial hierarchy and their concomi­
tant costs. Since self-directed work teams have more 
independence and self-determination than other 
types of groups in an organization, they can respond 
more quickly to the needs of the organization or pro­
cess and make better informed decisions. However, 
team-based structures also require increased inter­
personal communication skills and training. In addi­
tion, teams cannot merely be created by fiat: It takes 
time to develop a team that works well together. 
Further, the very flexible nature of team-based struc­
tures can also lead to role ambiguity, increased con­
flict, and more stress for the team members.
Organizations can also be structured around a 
network of affiliates that together create a product or 
serve a client base. For example, a network structure 
(also called a modular or lattice structure) may com­
prise an accounting firm, marketing firm, product 
development firm, and manufacturing firm that all 
work together. In the network structure, the empha­
sis is on creating value for the organization, focus­
ing on customer-centered activities that enhance 
the value of processes and products rather than on 
management-induced activities that do not. The 
various units in the network organization form alli­
ances or partnerships to meet organizational needs. 
Communication in the network organization flows 
not only vertically along the lines of command, but 
horizontally between the work units. This approach 
to organizational structure is particularly appropri­
ate in multinational companies that do a significant 
amount of communication electronically.
Another contemporary approach to organization 
design in the 21st Century is the virtual organization. 
The virtual organization is actually an association of

multiple organizations that are allied for the purpose 
of product development or serving a client. For exam­
ple, large government contracts such as ship design 
and development are often bid by such alliances, 
since it is difficult for any one organization to have 
all the skills necessary to develop a complex weapons 
system from cradle to grave. By joining together to 
form a product team, however, normally separate 
engineering, ship building, and training companies 
(among others) can create a temporary organization 
that will meet all the customer’s needs. Virtual orga­
nizations usually consist of a prime contractor that 
performs most of the work and leads the team, and 
a number of subcontractors that may change as the 
needs of the project demand.
Redesigning the Organization
A running joke in many organizations is that when 
management does not know how to solve its prob­
lems, they reorganize. Sometimes reorganization is 
merely the business equivalent of rearranging the 
deckchairs on the Titanic: a way to look like one is 
doing something while ignoring the bigger, harder 
problem. However, reorganization also can be a legit­
imate effort. The goals and operations of organiza­
tions change as does the marketplace in which they 
operate. In order to stay competitive, there are occa­
sions when the organization needs to reinvent itself 
and reorganize itself in order to be more competi­
tive in the marketplace. For example, when adding 
operations in a different country, a very hierarchi­
cal, centralized structure more than likely will need 
to be changed. In such situations, managers on the 
ground need the empowerment to make decisions 
appropriate to the new location without first asking 
permission from a corporate headquarters located in 
a country with a different culture and legal and eco­
nomic systems.
However, reorganization is not something to 
be taken lightly. It is a costly undertaking not only 
in terms of the time it takes to design and imple­
ment the new structure, but in terms of the impact 
on employees and their ability to perform and con­
tribute to the success of the organization. In most 
re-organizations, there are losers: those whose jobs 
were downsized, from whom power was taken, or who 
are now forced to form a new work team. This can 
result not only in a situation where the employees 
must learn a new way of doing something or where 
they need to bond into a new work team, but also can 
result in employee dissatisfaction or a non-supportive 
work environment. The pros and cons of any contem­
plated reorganization must be carefully considered 
and weighed to determine whether or not a re-orga­
nization is appropriate.
Before embarking on the process of reorganiza­
tion, the management team should consider several 
things. First, reorganization should be done as part 
of the organization’s on-going strategic planning 
process. Reorganization should not be attempted 
unless it would significantly improve the organiza­
tion’s competitive edge. However, different market 
segments such as separate product lines or opera­
tions in different countries frequently benefit from 
being structured so that they receive sufficient man­
agement attention and do not compete with each 
other. For example, a company manufacturing two 
products might want to organize itself around the two 
product lines rather than having each in the same 
reporting structure. Similarly, it may be strategically 
advantageous to have different reporting structures 
for operations that are located in different coun­
tries. Organizational redesign should be structured 
so that the corporate headquarters supports the vari­
ous operations of the organization rather than makes 
their tasks more difficult by imposing unreasonable 
reporting structures or not giving them sufficient 
management attention to support their success in 
the marketplace.
The design of an organization should exploit 
the strengths of its human capital. For example, an

professional workers involved in a creative process 
(e.g., engineers) should take care not to impose 
too many strictures on their ability to do their jobs. 
Such employees need to be able to make decisions 
on the local level rather than going through a com­
plex chain of command. On the other hand, it is also 
important that each function within the organization 
is manageable. If one cannot find competent manag­
ers for a given function in a proposed reorganization 
scheme, the system probably needs to be redesigned. 
Other constraints that may affect the feasibility of an 
organizational redesign include the interests of the 
organization’s stakeholders, the ability of the infor­
mation systems to support the structure, government 
regulations (including international regulations that 
may affect a multinational organization), and the 
organizational culture. Such variables should all be 
considered carefully before a redesign is attempted.
Once the problems facing the organization have 
been sufficiently analyzed and it has been deter­
mined that redesigning the organization will solve 
them, there are several considerations for the actual 
redesign process. One consideration is whether or 
not there are any groups within the organization with 
special cultures that need to be separated from the 
other groups. For example, although marketing func­
tions can fall within product lines, they often are a 
separate function because of their different tasks and 
attitudes. Similarly, a new product development labo­
ratory might need to be put in as a separate function 
so that it is not influenced by the way current prod­
ucts are designed. A related consideration concerns 
the ease of coordination between groups within the 
organization. For example, if coordinating the func­
tions of a given product line that has operations in 
two separate countries is too difficult, it might make 
more sense to separate them organizationally and 
not just geographically.
Another consideration that needs to be taken into 
account, particularly in decentralized organizations, 
is whether there is sufficient accountability built into 
the organization design. In particular, it is important 
to look at the proposed organizational structure to 
determine if multiple groups have shared responsibil­
ities. In such instances, it is easy for problems to arise 
when one group assumes that the other will accom­
plish the task or blames the other group for its own 
failure. In addition, it is important to determine how 
groups whose performance is difficult to measure will 
be held accountable. For example, it is not necessar­
ily reasonable to expect a new product development 
group to create 20 viable new product ideas a quarter. 
On the other hand, it is important to ensure that the 
group is doing its best to produce new ideas.
Finally, the organization design should be flexible 
enough to accommodate the organization’s needs in 
the future. An organizational structure that cannot 
do so is not going to be useful for supporting orga­
nizational effectiveness and success in the long run. 
However, molding the structure of an organization 
can be a continuing process as the needs of the orga­
nization and the marketplace change. For the orga­
nization to continue to meet the challenges of the 
future, it is important that the structure be adapted 
to support those needs as necessary.

Organization Development
ABSTRACT
Organization development (OD) is a long-range 
effort to improve an organization’s problem-solving 
and renewal processes. OD involves the application 
of behavior science knowledge to the problems of the 
workplace. OD consultants tend to look at the orga­
nization as a symptom and diagnose not only obvious 
symptoms, but deeper, more systemic problems. The 
OD process comprises multiple steps, tends to be long-
term, and often includes multiple iterations of the diag­
nosis, planning, action, and stabilization/evaluation 
steps. OD interventions are typically more successful if 
carried out by an external consultant as change agent.
OVERVIEW
Each generation brings with it new technologies 
and new challenges. From a business perspective, 
this means that the organization needs to adapt and 
change to meet the changing needs and demands of 
the marketplace, or fail. Organization development 
(OD) is a long-range effort to improve the organi­
zation’s problem-solving and renewal processes. OD 
involves the application of behavior science knowl­
edge to the problems of the workplace.
Sometimes the changes that need to be made in 
an organization are relatively simple, even obvious. 
For example, most modern businesses need to have 
a presence on the web in order to be taken seriously 
by potential customers. Other changes are less sim­
ple to implement. For example, although it may be 
obvious to most observers that an organization needs 
to computerize its inventory, the ramifications of 
this change may be widespread and complex. The 
organization will have to hire someone to install the 
system and input the inventory data into the new sys­
tem. The human resources department will need to

develop or contract training for the people using the 
new inventory system. Old procedures will need to 
be updated to take into account the new procedures 
and their requirements. This illustrates the nature of 
the organization as a system: changes in one part of 
the system result in changes in the other parts of the 
system as well.
Organizational Culture: The Informal Organization
Although the installation of a new inventory data­
base system can be a complex task involving most (if 
not all) of the organization, other changes can be 
even more complex, such as those that attempt to 
change the organization’s culture or norms. French 
and Bell (1973) use the metaphor of an iceberg to 
describe the nature of an organization (see Figure 1). 
According to this theory, an organization comprises 
both a formal organization and an informal organi­
zation. When a symptom arises in an organization, it 
may be due to problems in the formal organization, 
the informal organization, or both. Like an iceberg, 
the formal organization — that part of the organiza­
tion that is easily observable (and more easily fixable) 
— represents only a small portion of the organization 
as a whole. The formal organization comprises the 
goals of the organization, the structure of the orga­
nization (i.e., the design of an organization includ­
ing its division of labor, delegation of authority, and 
span of control), the skills of its employees, the tech­
nology it employs, and the resources it has to accom­
plish its tasks. The example of the need to install a 
computerized inventory system is an example of an 
intervention within the formal organization.
However, as illustrated in Figure 1, like an iceberg, 
the majority of the organization is harder to see and 
diagnose. The informal organization comprises such 
things as attitudes, values, feelings, interactions, and 
group norms. These are much more difficult to deal 
with than the aspects of the formal organization. Often, 
problems that appear to be part of the formal organi­
zation may in fact be related to the informal organiza­
tion or may be a combination of problems in both the 
formal and the informal organization. Therefore, it is 
important for the organization’s OD practitioner to 
separate the symptoms the organization is experiencing 
from the underlying problems. Although some organi­
zational problems (such as the example of the need to 
implement a new inventory database) are obvious and 
relatively straightforward to fix, others are more sys­
temic and thus more difficult to diagnose.
There are many symptoms for which an organi­
zation requires an OD intervention. For example, 
communication or intra- or inter-team conflict is 
frequently cited as a problem in many organizations. 
Similarly, managerial strategies are often found to be 
ineffective or onerous by those who must live under 
them. Other obvious symptoms of organizational 
problems include:

 Lack of motivation on the part of the worker,

 Lack of clear or functional structure or roles 
within the organization,

 Problems with the organiza­
tional climate, or

 Problems stemming from 
cultural norms.
There are some situations 
where OD interventions should 
be considered, such as the need 
to perform strategic planning 
or cope with a merger. However, 
for the most part, these are 
only 
symptoms. 
The 
prob­
lems underlying these symp­
toms are often not the same. 
Communication problems, for 
example, might occur because 
the organization has set two or 
more groups in competition 
Figure 1: The Formal and Informal Organization (adapted from French & Bell, 1973)

302
with each other, and they need to compete for scarce 
resources. Apparent lack of motivation may be the 
result of inadequate control, lack of training, or 
unfair or inadequate rewards. Part of the job of the 
OD consultant is to determine what underlying prob­
lems are responsible for the symptoms being experi­
enced by the organization.
Further Insights
The OD Consultant/Change Agent
Although for the most part, organizations employ 
their own OD staff, for OD to be effective it requires 
an outside change agent. This is a person external to 
the organization who guides an organization through 
a change effort. To be effective, change agents need 
to have knowledge of how to conduct a change effort, 
an understanding of the organization, and sufficient 
power to be able to implement the change.
There are a number of reasons why an external 
change agent is more likely to successfully accom­
plish change within an organization than an inter­
nal change agent with the same credentials. External 
consultants typically have a more clear-cut role than 
do internal consultants. When an external consultant 
is hired to do OD for an organization, it is typically 
with the understanding that his or her purview com­
prises the activities associated with OD and not with 
other organizational tasks or objectives. If the external 
change agent is properly introduced into the organi­
zation, everyone will know what purpose this individ­
ual serves. An internal consultant, on the other hand, 
typically has more difficulty articulating his or her role 
within the organization. Although OD may be part of 
the internal consultant’s role, she or he will often be 
called upon to perform other human resources activi­
ties as well. This makes it more difficult for the organi­
zation to see an internal consultant as an expert. It also 
makes it less likely that the affected employees will be 
as open with an internal consultant as with an external 
one, because they will tend to see him or her as part of 
the organizational hierarchy with loyalties to manage­
ment rather than to the employees.
External consultants are more likely to be effec­
tive as OD change agents because they are less 
affected by organizational norms than internal 
consultants. Whereas internal consultants are 
more ready to accept the organizational system as 
given, external consultants are more likely to be 
able to look at the organization objectively and see 
problems in areas that an internal consultant might 
take for granted.
An external consultant is also freer to look at the 
organization from a larger, systems view while an inter­
nal consultant is more likely to focus on a micro view 
of the organization. As discussed above, it is essential 
that an OD consultant consider the problems in both 
the formal and the informal organization and to rec­
ognize that changing the organization in one area 
is likely to have a direct or indirect effect on other 
areas. An internal consultant, however, often is either 
(a) unable to have that degree of objectivity because 
she or he is part of the system or (b) is only tasked 
with very circumscribed activities because she or he is 
a direct employee of the organization. For example, 
if the organization is experiencing difficulties in com­
munication, an internal consultant might be tasked 
with developing and conducting a training course in 
communication skills. An external consultant, given 
the same set of symptoms, would more than likely 
look at the system as a whole and might find out that 
the communication problem was only a symptom of 
a deeper underlying problem such as conflict over 
scarce resources or differing norms between groups. 
The internal consultant is unlikely to be able to suc­
cessfully address this problem because she or he has 
only been tasked with giving a training course.
Finally, external consultants typically have easier 
access to upper-level management in the organiza­
tion. Since the support of upper-level management 
is essential for the success of OD interventions, this 
makes external consultants more likely to be success­
ful. Internal consultants, on the other hand, are part 
of the system that they are trying to change. Since they 
are unlikely to have the same access to upper-level 
management as an external consultant, they are less 
likely to have the support necessary to ensure the suc­
cess of their interventions. As a result, internal consul­
tants typically spend little effort toward organizational 
renewal, whereas external consultants are free to do so.
OD Processes
Scouting
Organization development is a multistage process 
(see Figure 2). The first step for both the consultant 
and the organization is scouting. This is a mutual 
exploration between the two parties to determine 
whether or not they can work together. Sometimes, 

Principles of Business: Management
Organization Development
303
for example, the OD consultant may not have experi­
ence or interest in the type of intervention needed 
by the organization. In other cases, the organization 
may be unable or unwilling to guarantee the support 
and resources necessary to ensure that change will 
occur. In order for the OD intervention to be success­
ful, the organization must be willing to implement 
the changes suggested by the OD consultant based 
on the research. Key management within the organi­
zation (especially at top organizational levels) must 
be involved in the change process. Further, those 
persons who will be affected by the change must be 
brought on board as soon as possible, and any per­
sons involved must be informed about the change 
and the reasons for it and motivated to implement 
it. If the organization cannot make these assurances, 
it is unlikely that the intervention will be successful.
Entry
If the organization and the consultant mutually decide 
that working together would be beneficial, they move 
into the entry stage. During this time, the two parties 
set roles for the desired change, share expectations for 
the results of the OD intervention, establish a commit­
ment (typically through contractual arrangement), 
and establish an effective power base to help ensure 
that the intervention will be effective.
Diagnosis
The next stage is diagnosis. During this stage, the OD 
consultant looks at the problems as perceived by the 
client. Although these are typically symptoms rather 
than underlying problems, this is usually the most 
reasonable place to start an intervention. In addi­
tion, the change agent at this point will look at the 
goals of the client and determine how best to meet 
them. This determination will take into consider­
ation both the resources and commitment of the 
client to the OD intervention and change process as 
well as the resources of the consultant.
There are a number of methods that are applied 
by OD consultants to aid in the diagnostic process. 
One of the most frequently used is the question­
naire, used in the context of the survey research 
feedback methodology (see Figure 3). This is a type 
of research in which data about the opinions, atti­
tudes, or reactions of the members of a sample are 
gathered using a survey instrument. The phases of 
survey research are goal setting, planning, imple­
mentation, evaluation, and feedback. As opposed to 
experimental research, survey research does not allow 
for the manipulation of an independent variable. 
The questionnaire or survey used in this technique 
comprises a data collection instrument designed to 
acquire information on the opinions, attitudes, or 
reactions of people. The consultant may choose to sur­
vey all employees using this instrument or may select 
a sample of workers who are asked questions concern­
ing their opinions, attitudes, or reactions, which are 
gathered using a survey instrument or questionnaire 
for purposes of scientific analysis.

In addition to surveys, the OD consultant may con­
duct interviews with key individuals across the orga­
nization. For example, there are typically individuals 
who better understand the causes of various symptoms 
and problems, who can better articulate these, or who 
are informal leaders within the organization. The OD 
consultant often includes his or her personal obser­
vations of the organization. Fruitful sources of such 
observations come from staff meetings, interdepart­
mental memos, and other records of communication. 
Another source of data that is useful in making a diag­
nosis of problems is objective data. This can include 
such the statistics as absenteeism, turnover, antiorga­
nizational behavior, production rates, reject rates, or 
union activity. Similarly, outside opinions of the orga­
nization from customers, clients, and competitors can 
also be useful in determining underlying problems.
Another useful tool for diagnosing problems 
within the organization is the confrontation meet­
ing. The purpose of confrontation meetings is to tap 
management resources within the organization and 
to apply these to solving the organization’s problems. 
To conduct a confrontation meeting, the change 
agent starts by establishing the proper climate for 
the meeting by articulating the goals, philosophy, 
and other ground rules for conduct of the meeting. 
She or he then describes the task that the group is to 
undertake. At this point, the consultant emphasizes 
the need for problem-solving and brainstorming 
skills. The meeting then breaks into working sub­
groups that are usually composed of members from 
different levels and sections within the organization. 
These subgroups then identify the major problems 
facing the organization and come back together to 
discuss and categorize the problems that were identi­
fied. These problems may then be assigned to various 
subgroups for further study and analysis.
Planning, Action & Stabilization
Once the problem has been diagnosed, the next step 
in the OD process is to plan the intervention. At this 
point, the decision needs to be made as to whether 
the intervention should be system-wide or only imple­
mented at certain levels. Once the nature and scope 
of the intervention has been determined, the next 
step in the OD process is to implement it. The consul­
tant next works with the organization to stabilize the 
change so that it becomes internalized. Once this has 
happened and the change state becomes the status 
quo, the consultant then evaluates the effectiveness 
of the change in solving the problem of the organi­
zation. At this point, if it is determined that further 
action it is necessary, the OD process then continues 
with further diagnosis, planning, action, and stabi­
lization. Eventually, when it is determined that the 
underlying problem has been adequately addressed 
and that the change process has been internalized 
within the organization, the consultant and the orga­
nization dissolve their relationship.
CONCLUSION
Organization development is more than management 
consulting. It is the application of behavior science 
knowledge to the problems of the workplace. OD is a 
long-range effort to improve the organization’s prob­
lem-solving and renewal processes and often takes 
more than one iteration before the underlying prob­
lem is properly diagnosed and adequately addressed. 
Although some organizations have internal OD con­
sultants on staff, in general, an external change agent 
is more likely to accomplish the long-term change 
desired by the organization. Properly applied, the OD 
process can be very effective in diagnosing and fixing 
deep or systemic problems in the organization.

Organizational Behavior
ABSTRACT
Organization behavior is the study of the functioning 
and performance of individuals, groups, and teams 
within organizations as well as of organizations as a 
whole. Based on scientific research and empirical 
data, organizational behavioral theorists attempt to 
understand, predict, and influence behavior at all 
levels within the organization. There are many prac­
tical applications of organizational behavior theory 
for managers. For example, at the individual level, 
organizational behavior theory can help managers

learn to be better leaders and communicate with 
and motivate their workers. At a team level, organi­
zational behavior theory helps managers understand 
how teams are formed and function, and how to best 
support them so that synergy occurs. At the organi­
zational level, organizational behavior theory can 
help managers better understand how the organiza­
tion works and how each subsystem within it works 
together to make up the organization as a whole.
OVERVIEW
Organizational behavior is the systematic study and 
application of how individuals and groups think and 
act within organizations and how these activities 
affect the effectiveness of the organization as a whole. 
Organizational behavior theorists take a systems 
approach, looking not only at individuals or groups 
as isolated entities, but also as part of an interactive 
social system in which the actions of one part influ­
ence the functioning of another. Rather than merely 
focusing on the profitability of the organization in 
isolation, the discipline of organizational behavior 
attempts to improve organizational effectiveness at 
all levels within the organization. To do this, organi­
zational behavior theorists attempt to understand, 
predict, and influence events on the individual, 
group, and organizational levels.
The field of organizational behavior is based on sev­
eral principles. First, organizational behavior theory 
and practice does not operate in isolation, but is mul­
tidisciplinary, drawing on the insights arising not only 
from its own research but also the research and insights 
of other disciplines. For example, psychology has con­
tributed to organizational behavior theory by helping 
explain issues relating to individual and interpersonal 
behavior, as well as the dynamics of groups and teams. 
Sociology has contributed to the knowledge of organiza­
tional behavior by increasing the understanding of how 
groups and teams act and interact, working together to 
contribute to the functioning of the organization as a 
social system. Anthropology contributes understand­
ing of culture and rituals, while political science helps 
us understand conflict between groups as well as orga­
nizational environments, power, and decision making. 
Newer disciplines, such as information systems theory, 
help organizational behavior theorists understand the 
dynamics of teams, how organizations manage knowl­
edge, and how decisions are made.
Just as the disciplines from which it gathers insights 
are based on empirical evidence, organizational 
behavior applies the scientific method in an attempt 
to systematically study the actions and interactions 
of individuals and teams within an organization. 
The scientific method involves observing behavior 
within organizations, formulating a theory based on 
the observations to explain why the behavior occurs, 
experimenting and collecting data to determine the 
truth of the hypothesis, and validating or modifying 
the hypothesis as appropriate.
This process differs from some early management 
theorists who often took lessons learned in isolated situ­
ations (such as the success of one large manufacturing 
company) and turned them into a list of simple steps 
to follow for success in all businesses. Rather, organiza­
tional behavior theory takes a contingency approach. 
This approach assumes that an action does not nec­
essarily always have the same consequences, and may 
result in a different reaction in different situations. 
What this means practically is that one solution is not 
universally the best and behavior cannot be distilled 
into simple lists of steps that ensure success. In general, 
it has been found that proposed absolute or universal 
rules need to be tempered by too many exceptions. For 
example, in the study of leadership, researchers and 
practitioners alike have found that there is not one best 
way to lead, but that the “ideal” management style is 
contingent on the needs, abilities, and personalities of 
both the employees performing the tasks and of their 
leader or manager. Because of real world experiences, 
organizational behavior theorists tend to temper their 
theories by trying to better understand when and why a 
principle works and by not stating absolutes.
One of the reasons that it is necessary to take a 
contingency approach when trying to understand 
behavior in organizations is that organizations are 
systems comprising numerous subsystems. The func­
tioning of each subsystem impacts the functioning 
of the other subsystems. Therefore, in addition to 
the contingency approach, organizational behavior 
theory is also founded on the premise of systems 
theory. In this approach, the organization is viewed 
as a system made up of interdependent subsystems, 
each of which affects the effectiveness of the other 
as well as the effectiveness of the organization as a 
whole. For example, a strike by one segment of work­
ers in an organization negatively impacts the ability 
of the organization as a whole to meet its objectives

whether those be to efficiently collect garbage, trans­
port passengers, or produce auto parts. However, sys­
tems theory affects organizations in less obvious ways, 
too. For example, when writing a proposal for a new 
contract, if one work group fails to meet its deadline 
for writing the technical response, a budget cannot 
be developed to submit to the prospective client and 
the production of a professional-looking proposal 
cannot be done in a timely manner. If enough of 
these small actions with negative impacts occur, the 
organization will not win the contract. This, in turn, 
could affect the profitability and even the viability of 
the organization and, along with it, the jobs and lives 
of the individuals and teams of which it is comprised. 
Each subsystem (technical work group, accounting 
or costing group, and proposal production group) 
affects the ability of the other groups — as well as of 
the organization in general — to do their jobs.
Although such insights are interesting in the 
abstract, organizational behavior is a practical disci­
pline that not only attempts to understand and predict 
behavior, but to influence it. To this end, organiza­
tional behavior theorists have made significant contri­
butions to management theory and practice.
APPLICATIONS
The field of organizational behavior is concerned 
with all three levels of functioning within the orga­
nization: individual, groups and teams, and the 
organization as a whole. At the individual level, 
organizational theorists study the characteristics, 
thought processes, and behaviors of employees. This 
subset of organizational behavior includes analyzing 
employees’ personality, motivation, roles, and cul­
tural differences and how such elements affect their 
behavior and interactions within the organization. 
Understanding these processes prepares the man­
ager to better motivate individuals and help them 
reach their full potential within the organization. At 
the team level, organizational behavior theorists look 
at such concepts as what distinguishes a team from a 
group, what processes are involved in the formation 
of a team, how leadership arises within a team, and 
the best way to manage teams. At the organizational 
level, theorists examine how the actions of individu­
als and teams affect the organization and its effective­
ness, as well as how the organization interacts with 
the greater culture and society.
Individual Behavior
When setting up a new organization, there are many 
considerations that impact how it will be structured. 
For example, a computer software development 
firm will need programmers through necessity. The 
number and type of employees needed will depend 
on what product the firm is trying to deliver and 
what level of work is sustainable. If these employees 
could work completely on their own, they would each 
be able to do their jobs however they wished. For 
example, Harvey may like to start at noon and work 
through the evening or keep his work area in a con­
stant state of controlled chaos while Chuck may be a 
morning person who keeps everything in its place. 
If they could work alone, this would not be a prob­
lem. In reality, however, people typically do not work 
in isolation and individual differences in work style, 
ability to communicate, and desire to be in charge 
can bring about clashes. Harvey and Chuck may 
need to share an office and reach an accommodation 
about how best to work together. Or, the program­
mer must depend on input from the designer and 
must also coordinate with other programmers work­
ing on other parts of the project. S/he may also be 
called on to demonstrate the new software to poten­
tial customers or work with marketing personnel to 
support efforts to maintain and increase the compa­
ny’s market share. One of the roles of the manager in 
an organization is to help minimize such differences, 
utilizing the abilities of the workers to meet the needs 
of the organization and supporting the needs of the 
workers with the resources of the organization.
Organizational behavior theorists examine many 
aspects of human behavior in order to help under­
stand, predict, and control how people act and inter­
act in the workplace. One practical application of 
the knowledge of individual differences is situational 
leadership theory. In this approach to leadership, 
theorists state that effective leaders change the style 
of their leadership depending on the ability and 
even the personality of the people they are trying 
to lead. For example, in cases where the workers do 
not have sufficient knowledge of how to do the job, 
the leader typically must be more directive than in 
situations where the workers are highly skilled and 
experienced. Similarly, the contingency leadership 
model suggests that effective leadership depends 
on whether the leader’s style is appropriate to the 
situation. For example, a leader who prefers to wade

into a situation and tell people what to do will not 
be successful in a situation where a team works best 
through synergy; piggybacking ideas off each other 
and developing a product or idea may be greater 
than what they could have done alone.
Another area in which organizational behavioral 
theorists are interested in, regarding the effects 
of individual differences and their impact on man­
agement effectiveness, is employee motivation. 
Motivation is the study of the needs and thought 
processes that determine a person’s behavior. 
Understanding what motivates a person can help a 
manager better reward that person for behavior that 
contributes to achieving the objectives of the orga­
nization. For example, if a worker is motivated by 
money, a manager can use the possibility of raises 
or bonuses to motivate the desired behavior. On 
the other hand, if the worker is motivated by status 
or power, a promotion or corner office may offer a 
greater incentive for desired behavior. There are 
two general approaches to motivation considered by 
organizational theorists. Content theories of motiva­
tion examine the dynamics of people’s needs, and 
use these to explain why the same person may be 
motivated differently at different times. Process theo­
ries of motivation, on the other hand, examine the 
processes by which needs are translated into behav­
ior. These theories help both organizational theorists 
and managers better understand, predict, and influ­
ence the performance of employees.
In addition to idiosyncratic differences between 
people based on individual personality types and 
preferences, organizational behavior theorists and 
managers alike are concerned with individual dif­
ferences between people based on their cultures. 
Certainly, it is important not to offend others in 
the course of getting a task done, but this issue goes 
deeper. Different cultures have different ways of 
doing things, and unless these differences are under­
stood and accommodated, motivating the worker 
and meeting organizational objectives will be more 
difficult than necessary. For example, when com­
municating, most women prefer to make eye contact 
with the person to whom they are speaking and tend 
to devote their full attention to the conversation. 
Many men, on the other hand, do not expect these 
things in a conversation and often multitask while 
talking. This can lead to miscommunication and con­
flict when such differences in communication styles 
result in situations where people believe that they are 
not being listened to or not being taken seriously. In 
another example, in the Japanese culture one must 
be able to not only understand what the other per­
son is saying, but to also correctly understand the 
nonverbal cues that accompany the verbal part of the 
communication. For example, in order to be polite, 
Japanese businesspersons may say what they think 
the other person wants to hear — such as saying that 
they will give serious consideration to a proposal — 
while giving nonverbal cues that say that they have 
already rejected the other person’s idea. Each cul­
ture has its own subtleties of communication. Such 
differences must be understood in order to facilitate 
effective communication so that organizational goals 
can be met.
Team Behavior & Processes
An increasing amount of work today is performed by 
teams rather than by groups or individuals. Although 
some tasks are better performed by the single indi­
vidual working alone, organizations are finding that 
many tasks are better accomplished through team­
work. There are several differences between a team 
and a group of individuals working together. Whereas 
the group may have a common goal (e.g., complete 
100 new widgets before the close of business), work 
teams tend to develop their own mission and their 
members are vested in accomplishing it. Therefore, 
although both groups and teams may be account­
able to a manager, team members are also account­
able to each other for getting their part of the work 
done. Therefore, in work groups, leadership is typi­
cally held by a single person, whereas in a team, all 
members tend to share leadership. Another major 
difference between groups and teams is that groups 
do not have a stable culture; as a result, conflict fre­
quently arises. True teams, on the other hand, have 
a collaborative culture in which the team members 
trust each other. As a result, work groups may or may 
not accomplish their goals whereas true teams tend 
to achieve synergy, producing products or ideas that 
are greater than those that could have been accom­
plished by the individuals alone.
Not all teams are created equally, however. 
Organizational behavior theorists have observed four 
different types of teams. In the manager-led work 
team, the manger is responsible for the design of 
the organizational context of the team’s activities as 

Organizational Behavior
Principles of Business: Management
310
well as the design of the team performing the work. 
Although the team itself is responsible for perform­
ing the work, the manager is responsible for monitor­
ing and managing the performance of the team. In 
the self-managing work team, although the manager 
designs the organizational context of the team and 
the structure of the group, the team itself not only 
performs the task to be done but monitors and man­
ages its performance. In the self-designing work team, 
the manager sets the organizational context within 
which the work must be performed, but the team 
organizes itself and specifies how it will perform this 
work. Finally, the self-governing work team performs 
all these tasks as well as designs the organizational con­
text in which they occur. When the manager under­
stands such underlying dynamics of team behavior, s/
he can be better able to support the team and pro­
mote the synergy that is possible through team efforts.
Whether work is being performed in a work group 
or in a team setting, eventually conflicts will arise. 
Organizational behavior theorists study these aspects 
of the organization also, and help managers under­
stand how best to minimize the negative impact of 
such situations. The key to conflict resolution often 
lies in understanding when it is best to be assertive 
and when it is best to be cooperative. The scientific 
observation of organizational behavior has led to sev­
eral theories about what situations are best suited for 
various conflict resolution styles. For example, when 
each side knows that it has to work with the other and 
that the interests of both parties are important, col­
laboration (when both parties try to find a mutually 
beneficial solution to a shared problem) or compro­
mise (when both parties give a little and get a little in 
return) are frequently the best approaches to conflict 
resolution. However, when one of the parties views 
the conflict as a win/lose situation, it is often neces­
sary to compete. In other situations it may be best to 
accommodate the other person’s desires in the short-
term in order to win a more important battle later on. 
Even avoidance — walking away from the problem 
— can be an effective way to manage conflict in the 
short-term if it allows tempers to cool down and the 
parties to come back later and resolve the conflict.
Organizational Processes
In addition to the assumptions, values, and beliefs of 
the individual workers and the shared assumptions, 
values, and beliefs of work teams, it is important to 
understand the assumptions, values, and beliefs of 
the organization as an entity. Although one can learn 
about an organization from observing formal aspects 
like its goals, structure, and other resources, such data 
only gives part of the picture. To truly understand the 
organization, one also needs to understand the infor­
mal aspects of the organization — those things under­
stood by the employees but that are not written down or 
formalized. These include such things as its attitudes, 
values, feelings, interactions, and norms. The differen­
tiation between the aspects of the formal organization 
and the informal organization is often described as an 
iceberg, with the formal structures being equivalent to 
the ten percent of the iceberg that is observable above 
the water line, but the real nature of the organization 
being hidden beneath—not readily observable to the 
casual observer but requiring careful study and analysis.
Organizational behavioral theorists and prac­
titioners need to understand not only the easily 
observable aspects of the organization, but the orga­
nizational culture in order to truly understand the 
behaviors and processes that make the organization 
run. Although organizations can experience prob­
lems stemming from their formal structures and 
aspects, more often it is the aspects of its informal 
culture that can create problems.
To be truly effective, a manager must understand 
not only the requirements set out in the formal 
organization, but also those implied as part of the 
informal organization. Understanding the values of 
one’s workers, for example, will help the manager 
know better how to motivate them. Understanding 
their values and feelings will help the manager avoid 
destructive conflict or defuse conflict situations when 
they occur. Understanding how employees interact 
with each other and the informal norms of work 
teams will help the manager be better able to support 
their efforts and facilitate their synergy and contribu­
tions to organizational effectiveness.

Human Performance Technology is important to 
the world’s economic future because practitioners, 
such as organizational consultants, strive to provide 
organizations with solutions to their performance 
problems. An effective human performance tech­
nologist will use a systematic approach to improve 
the productivity and competence of the workforce 
so that organizations are able to compete in a global 
economy.
OVERVIEW
Organizations can be very complex. There will be 
times when the management team may decide the 
organization needs assistance with making changes 
throughout the different units in the company. As 
a result, individuals may be assigned to facilitate 
the change process. In order to effectively make 
changes to the processes and structures, a change 
agent would need to have the ability to interpret 
various situations occurring within the organization. 
“Reading” an organization requires one to be able to 
understand situations as they occur and know how to 
handle any problems that may occur. “Skilled lead­
ers and managers develop the knack of reading situ­
ations with various scenarios in mind and of forging 
actions that seem appropriate to the understandings 
thus obtained” (Morgan, 1995).
One field of study that evaluates how to effectively 
make change in people and systems is human perfor­
mance technology. According to the International 
Society of Performance and Instruction (ISPI), 
human performance technology (HPT) can be 
described as “the systematic and systemic identifica­
tion and removal of barriers to individual and organi­
zational performance.” The meaning of the concept 
can be broken down by each word in the phrase. 
“Human” refers to the individuals that make up the 
organization, and “Performance” implies that the 
activities of the employees can be assessed by mea­
surable outcomes. “Technology” assumes that a sys­
tematic and systemic approach can be developed to 
resolve problems within the organization.
Human Performance Technology (HPT) draws 
from many academic disciplines such as psychology, 
instructional systems design, organizational develop­
ment and human resources. The focus of the interdis­
ciplinary field requires the practitioner to be able to 
(1) assess and analyze the performance gap between 
where the organization is and where it wants to go, 
(2) identify the causes for the performance gap, (3) 
make recommendations on how to close the gap 
and improve performance, (4) facilitate the change 
management process, and (5) evaluate the results to 
make sure that the desired change has occurred.
The human performance technology field aims 
to ensure that the knowledge, skills, motivation and 
environmental support necessary for employees to 
complete their work successfully is available through 
a systems approach. According to Jacobs (1987), the 
conceptual domain of HPT can be defined by three 
key aspects:

 Management functions — guides, controls and fa­
cilitates the development of human performance 
systems.

 Development functions — examines all aspects of 
a problem; relates results from a set of decisions 
to other decisions; and uses resources to develop 
performance systems.

 Systems functions — provides the conceptual 
means for viewing people, materials, events and 
resources required to achieve goals.
Performance tends to be measured in terms of 
quality, productivity, and cost. As a result, human per­
formance is tied to the bottom line — organizational 
success. Both individual and organizational goals must 
be considered when implementing processes and poli­
cies that will improve performance. “Use of systems 
approaches to develop human performance systems 
is one of the most significant aspects of the field. The 
end result of using a systems approach is a combina­
tion of materials, events, peoples and strategies called 
a performance system. A performance system is the 
structure, within the work setting, in which people use 
resources and tools to perform their work. Human per­
formance systems have five main components: (1) a job 
or context; (2) individual abilities, motivations, actions, 
decisions, and behavior; (3) responses required for 
performance; (4) consequences of the response; and 
(5) feedback on the consequences” (Jacobs, 1987).

In summary, organizations may require the ser­
vices of human performance technologists to facili­
tate changes, such as process improvement, within 
the company. These individuals will act as consul­
tants to the organization as it charts a new course 
and direction. Armed with the concept of HPT and 
performance systems, organizational consultants will 
be tasked with improving the bottom line of the com­
pany’s initiatives so that it remains competitive.
APPLICATIONS
Human Performance Technologists as 
­Organizational Consultants
Human Performance Technology is important to the 
world’s economic future because practitioners such 
as organizational consultants strive to provide orga­
nizations with solutions to their performance prob­
lems. HPT uses instructional technologies to improve 
individual performance so that organizational goals 
can be achieved. Being a good organizational consul­
tant requires an individual to navigate the company 
through innovations, changes, and processes. An 
effective human performance technologist will use a 
systematic approach to improve the productivity and 
competence of the workforce so that organizations 
are able to compete in a global economy. According 
to Morgan (1995), these individuals must (1) have 
the capacity to remain open and flexible, (2) reserve 
judgment until all facts are known, and (3) gain new 
insight by viewing situations from different angles. 
These skills are required of both the internal and 
external organizational consultants.
Guiding Principles
In order to differentiate the concept from other dis­
ciplines, ISPI has developed a set of principles for 
human performance technologists to follow when 
assisting organizations in managing change. The 
principles are:
1.	 HPT focuses on outcomes. If an organization 
focuses on outcomes, the consultant may use 
tools that support obtaining data to determine 
whether or not a process is effective and whether 
the employees share the same vision and goals. 
In addition, outcomes can measure whether or 
not the performance gap has been closed.
2.	 HPT takes a systems view. There is a need to im­
plement an approach that analyzes the perfor­
mance of the employees in order to determine 
if the organization is on track with fulfilling its 
vision, goals and objectives. A system implies 
that the divisions and people of an organization 
are interconnected. The people must support 
the process. It is important to take a systems 
approach because the complexity within an or­
ganization has the power to affect the perfor­
mance of its employees. The success of a single 
unit itself and the success of the entire organiza­
tion at large are deeply dependent on one an­
other. A systems approach considers the entire 
organizational environment including inputs as 
well as pressures, expectations, constraints, and 
consequences.
3.	 HPT adds value. At the end of the process inter­
vention, clients should leave with a set of tools 
which will assist them with making choices, es­
tablishing measurable goals, identifying barriers 
and tradeoffs, and taking control of the destiny 
of the organization. Although the actual HPT 
techniques address issues such as improving 
quality, customer retention and cost reduction, 
there should be a link to how the efforts im­
pact business goals and outcomes such as sales, 
profits, and market share.
4.	 HPT establishes partnerships. HPT is built on 
collaboration among all of the stakeholders in 
an effort to improve the overall performance of 
the organization. Everyone should be involved 
in the decision making process, and the advice 
and experience of subject matter experts (SMEs) 
should be taken into consideration. Working 
collaboratively includes sharing decisions about 
goals, determining the next steps to take in the 
process, and viewing implementation strate­
gies as shared responsibilities. Partnerships are 
created from listening closely, trusting and re­
specting each other’s knowledge and expertise.
5.	 Be systematic in the assessment of the need or 
opportunity. The needs assessment occurs in the 
beginning of the project. The consultant should 
analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of different 
aspects of the organization in order to identify 
the external and internal pressures affecting it. 
This process will determine the deficiencies or 
performance gaps that need to be corrected.

Principles of Business: Management

6.	 Be systematic in the analysis of the work and 
workplace to identify the cause or factors that 
limit performance. Cause analysis is about de­
termining why a gap in performance or expec­
tations exists. This step in the systematic process 
will determine what should be addressed to im­
prove performance.
7.	 Be systematic in the design of the solution or 
specification of the requirements of the solution. 
Design is about identifying the key attributes of a 
solution. The output is a communication that de­
scribes the features, attributes, and elements of 
a solution and the resources required to imple­
ment the solution.
8.	 Be systematic in the development of all or some 
of the solution and its elements. Development is 
about the creation of some or all of the elements 
of the solution. It can be done by an individual or 
a team. The output is a product, process, system, 
or technology. Examples include training, per­
formance support tools, a new or re-engineered 
process, the redesign of a workspace, or a change 
in compensation or benefits.
9.	 Be systematic in the implementation of the so­
lution. Implementation is about deploying the 
solution and managing the change required to 
sustain it. This standard is about helping clients 
adopt new behaviors or use new or different 
tools.
10.	 Be systematic in the evaluation of the process and 
the results. Evaluation is about measuring the ef­
ficiency and effectiveness of what was done, how 
it was done, and the degree to which the solution 
produced the desired results so that the cost in­
curred and the benefits gained can be compared. 
This standard is about identifying and acting on 
opportunities throughout the systematic process 
to identify measures and record the data that will 
help identify needs, adoption, and results.
Issues
Choosing the Best Organizational Consultant
External versus Internal Consulting
Many organizations will assign someone to complete 
the task of assessing the organization. When select­
ing this individual, the organization must evaluate 
the environment to determine whether or not it 
is best to use someone within the organization or 
outside of the organization. Facilitators, or consul­
tants, are requested as a result of their expertise in a 
given area as well as their ability to collaborate with 
others in order to accomplish a given task. Human 
Performance Technologists can facilitate the process 
if an organization is attempting to make a change 
with the workforce and systems that are currently in 
place. Human Performance Technologists are in var­
ious industries such as academia, financial services, 
manufacturing, government, and pharmaceuticals. 
In addition, their expertise covers many functions 
such as human resources, training and development, 
and line management. Given the vast number of 
sources for finding these individuals, organizations 
will have to decide what works best.
Although most references on organizational con­
sulting discuss the role of the external consultant, 
the role of internal consulting is becoming popular. 
External consultants are viewed as neutral because 
they do not have a history with the organization, 
and they tend to work on a project for a specific 
period of time. In other words, there is a beginning 
and an end. They are from outside the company, 
work for the duration of the contract, and may leave 
(Kleinberg, 1992). In some cases, part of the external 
consulting contract is to transition the outcomes into 
a “Train the Trainer” workshop for a select group of 
employees. Once they have completed their mission, 
they may train employees to maintain the changes 
once they are gone. These employees can become 
the internal organizational consultants. However, 
depending on the organization’s culture, the man­
agement team may elect to use external consultants 
on a continual basis in order to maintain a sense of 
trust and objectivity.
Internal consultants are organizational devel­
opment professionals who work exclusively for 
one organization and are direct reports to a des­
ignated level of management (Lacey, 1995). These 
individuals may work alone or as part of a team. 
In addition, there may be others such as specialists 
in organizational development, human resources, 
training or communications who report to the 
internal consultant in an effort to complete the 
assigned tasks.
Both external and internal organizational con­
sultants are challenged with developing a systematic 
approach to managing change in an organization. 
As they go through each phase of the consulting 

Principles of Business: Management
Organizational Consulting
315
process, they will be faced with obstacles that they 
must overcome. There are advantages and disadvan­
tages for using internal and external consultants to 
evaluate an organization.
Cummings and Worley (1993) created a process 
consisting of five phases in the consulting process. 
These phases are entering, contracting, diagnosing, 
intervening, and evaluating.
1. Entering
a.  External Consultant — This stage tends to be 
the most difficult stage for the external consul­
tant because the individual needs to market him­
self and build a client base. Once clients have 
been identified, the external consultant must 
build relationships and become familiar with the 
organization.
i.  Advantage: Select projects based on their 
criteria
ii.  Disadvantage: Need to learn company
b.  Internal Consultant — Little time is spent on 
entry for the internal consultant since he is con­
sidered an insider of the organization.
i.  Advantages: Ready access to clients
ii.  Disadvantages: Obligated to work with everyone
2. Contracting
a.  External Consultant — The consultant must work 
with the client to develop a mutual understanding 
of what the expected outcomes and deliverables 
will be. At this stage, the consultant and client com­
municate expectations and create a legal contract 
that both will be bound by. The purpose of the 
contract is to clarify goals, roles, use of resources, 
and ground rules (Block, 1981).
i.  Advantages: Can terminate project at anytime; 
maintain “outsider” role
ii.  Disadvantages: May incur “out of pocket” 
expenses, especially if unexpected events occur.
b.  Internal Consultant — The internal consul­
tant works under a contract as well. However, 
most are verbal versus written. The internal 
consultant has internal clients that require ser­
vices. However, one of the disadvantages is that 
the internal consultant must be sensitive to the 
“personalities” and politics of the organization. 
An external consultant can be more vocal with 
their opinions because they will eventually leave. 
However, the internal consultant has to remain 
within the organization and be sensitive to back­
lash and retaliation.
i.  Advantages: Information can be open or 
confidential
ii.  Disadvantages: 
Must 
complete 
projects 
assigned; may experience client retaliation and 
loss of job
3. Diagnosing
a.  External Consultant — During this stage the 
external consultant will start collecting data such 
as employee surveys, meeting with focus groups to 
get follow-up information and feedback, and con­
ducting individual meetings in order to develop 
an analysis and make recommendations for 
change. The consultant may also evaluate leader­
ship styles of key players (Darling & Heller, 2012). 
Once the plan has been developed, the consultant 
will schedule a meeting to provide the client, and 
special guests, with feedback on what needs to 
occur in order to implement the plan.
i.  Advantages: Prestige from being external
ii.  Disadvantages: Confidential data can increase 
political sensitivities
b.  Internal Consultant — This phase is the same for 
both the internal and external consultant.
i.  Advantages: Has relationships with many orga­
nization members
ii.  Disadvantages: Openly sharing data can reduce 
political intrigue
4. Intervening
a.  External Consultant — The design of what issues 
need to be addressed are the focus of this stage. 
It’s important that the external consultant can get 
the participants to buy-in to the process because 
authentic information is required at this point. 
There has to be commitment on the part of the 
participants, and the external consultant may 
include this request at the beginning when the 
contract is being written. The external consultant 
needs to be assured that there will be individuals 
taking ownership of the outcomes and the process 
will be implemented and maintained once he has 
left.
i.  Advantages: Can insist on receiving authentic 
data and internal commitment
ii.  Disadvantages: Must confine activities within 
boundaries of client organization

Organizational Consulting
Principles of Business: Management
316
b.  Internal Consultant — Although this phase is the 
same for both the external and internal consul­
tant, there is one exception for the internal con­
sultant. Buy-in is key for the external consultant. 
However, the internal consultant considers it a 
luxury. Many employees do not have the oppor­
tunity to be authentic and recognize the politi­
cal ramifications if they are completely honest. 
The internal consultant recognizes this dilemma. 
“Although most change projects begin with test­
ing the waters of opportunity, hoping to build crit­
ical mass that will sweep in all members and result 
in commitment to change, all projects are not 
successful in generating enthusiasm for change” 
(Lacy, 1995).
i.  Advantages: May run interference for client 
across organizational lines to align support
ii.  Disadvantages: Cannot require information 
and internal commitment is a luxury.
5. Evaluating
a.  External Consultant — During this phase, the 
external consultant is constantly assessing the pro­
cess and results while making revisions to the plan. 
The external consultant may make some assump­
tions and solicit feedback from the client to see 
what level of customer satisfaction is present.
i.  Advantages: Can use project success as a means 
of gaining repeat business and customer 
referrals
ii.  Disadvantages: Seldom see long term results
b.  Internal Consultant — This phase is similar for 
both types of consultants. The client will require 
more measurable results as the amount of money 
spent on the project intervention increases. In 
addition, there are potential personal rewards 
for the internal consultant. If the project is suc­
cessful, there are opportunities for an increase in 
salary as well as promotions. However, there is a 
down side. Being an internal consultant can be 
lonely because many people within the organiza­
tion may not understand the job. There will be 
questions regarding what the consultant actually 
does and whether or not the work adds value to 
the bottom line.
i.  Advantages: 
Can 
see 
change 
become 
institutionalized
ii.  Disadvantages: Little recognition for a job well 
done
Both external and internal consultants perform 
many of the same functions throughout the con­
sulting process as each attempt to create a plan of 
improvement for the organization However, each 
will face unique sets of challenges and obstacles as he 
attempts to obtain his goals.
CONCLUSION
If one has a desire to lead change in an organization, 
he/she must have the ability to see the organization 
from the “big picture” perspective. Understanding 
the mission and vision will assist consultants in deter­
mining the best course of action for the organization 
at any given time. “Effective managers and profes­
sionals in all walks of life have to become skilled in 
the art of reading the situations they are attempting 
to organize or manage” (Morgan, 1995).
Human Performance Technology is a technique 
that both external and internal organizational con­
sultants may use in order to assist companies with 
achieving the bottom-line, implementing process 
improvement, and navigating change throughout 
the organization. Jacobs (1987) provided 11 proposi­
tions that emerged as a result of his research on HPT.
1.	 Human performance and human behavior are 
different, and knowledge of the difference is im­
portant for achieving the goals of the field.
2.	 Any statement about human performance must 
also include organizational performance.
3.	 Costs of improving performance should be re­
garded as investments in human capital, yielding re­
turns in terms of increased performance potential.
4.	 Both organizational and individual goals must 
be considered in order to determine the desired 
performance.
5.	 Human performance technology consists of 
management functions, development functions, 
and systems functions.
6.	 Knowing how to engineer human performance 
and the conditions that affect it is as important as 
explaining why the behavior occurred.
7.	 In order to diagnose problems in an organiza­
tion, the consultant must analyze the present 
system first, then examine the differences be­
tween the present and ideal system.
8.	 Exemplary performance provides the most log­
ical referent for determining job performance 
standards.

Principles of Business: Management

9.	 Human performance problems can have dif­
ferent root causes, and these causes are generally 
classified as either originating from the person, 
from the person’s environment, or from both.
10.	 Performance of one subsystem affects the perfor­
mance of other subsystems in predictable ways, 
which will require problem causes to be analyzed 
at more than one level of an organization.
11.	 Many different solutions may be used to improve 
human performance. Selection of any one solu­
tion is dependent upon the cause and nature of 
the performance problem, and the criteria used 
to evaluate a solution must include its potential 
to make a measurable difference in the perfor­
mance system.

Organizational Learning
ABSTRACT
Organizational knowledge is a concept that rep­
resents the sum total of all of the knowledge and 
experience that members of the organization both 
possess and bring to the table as they engage in the 
work of the organization. Organizational learning is 
the process developed by an organization with the 
goal of increasing the overall amount of organiza­
tional knowledge available, and of making sure that 
this organizational knowledge is applied in the most 
timely and effective ways possible.
OVERVIEW
Organizational learning can be thought of as an 
aggregation of the process of individual learning 
by members of a larger group—the organization. 
As individuals acquire experience at various tasks, 
the accumulation of this experience eventually pro­
duces knowledge. When many individuals are work­
ing together in an organization, their acquisition of 
individual experience and the subsequent produc­
tion of knowledge at the level of the individual also 
benefits the organization, because the organization 
acquires experience and knowledge at the same 
time as the individuals who compose it do. Seen 
in this way, organizational learning can seem as an 
almost natural process that occurs without the need 
for intentional drive to motivate it, almost like sedi­
ment accumulating on the ocean floor. Yet there is 
also a deliberate aspect to organizational learning, 
because organizations can choose to focus their 
knowledge management efforts in ways designed 
specifically to improve their own learning capacity.
An organization might recognize that one of its 
weaknesses is in being able to retrieve and analyze 
sales data for transactions using foreign currency. The 
organization could either continue to operate “as is,” 
in this area, or it could implement changes in its prac­
tices to make such information easier to get a hold of 
and to analyze (Wellman, 2013). This type of thinking 
about the ways in which one thinks, whether at the 
level of an individual or of an organization, is known 
as metacognition, or “thinking about thinking.”
APPLICATIONS
Organizations operate within an environment 
characterized by constant change, whether due to the 
weather, the economy, social and political develop­
ments, or some combination of these factors. Because 
the environment is perpetually in flux, organizations 
cannot afford to approach that environment with 
the same ideas and thought processes used years or 
even decades ago. Instead, organizations must con­
tinue to build their knowledge by using information 
acquired through experience operating in the ever 
changing world. An organization that continues to 
learn by acquiring experience and analyzing it to 
produce knowledge will be better equipped to deal 
with changing circumstances (Gino & Staats, 2015).
Another major motivation for organizations to opti­
mize their learning is to help them stay ahead of their

competitors. Many types of organizational knowledge 
pertain to ways in which the organization can operate 
more efficiently and more effectively (Argyris, 2012). 
For example, a company that operates a chain of cof­
fee stores might focus entirely on constant expansion 
into new markets, while its competitor, who possesses 
many more years of experience in the coffee business, 
may have learned to take a slower approach and con­
duct thorough market analysis of every region it con­
siders moving into, before committing to the move. 
This methodically analytical, go slow approach could 
help the more established company avoid rushing 
into economically unstable regions just for the sake 
of short-term expansion. In this way, the older compa­
ny’s ability to put its own knowledge to more effective 
use helps the company to outperform its competition 
in the long run, by avoiding the unnecessary expense 
of opening stores in areas where there will not be 
enough business to sustain them at a profitable level 
(Cameron & Spreitzer, 2012).
Knowledge management is an umbrella term used 
to describe all of the different ways that an organiza­
tion manipulates knowledge, from acquiring it and 
organizing it to distributing and storing it. Generally 
speaking, the more adept an organization is at knowl­
edge management, the greater will be that organiza­
tion’s aptitude for organizational learning.
The experience curve describes a theoretical 
model that explains the tendency for overall produc­
tion costs to decrease as the volume of production 
increases. In other words, the experience curve shows 
how an organization learns how to operate more effi­
ciently and more effectively, the more it engages in 
a particular type of production. Often, it may not be 
immediately clear how the savings are being achieved, 
but the reality of the savings is beyond question.
VIEWPOINTS
The fundamental mechanism of organizational 
learning is change. This does not refer to any kind of 
gradual evolution that occurs randomly and without 
direction. The change at the heart of organizational 
learning is caused by the process of the individuals 
who make up the organization acquiring experience 
through the course of their regular work on the orga­
nization’s behalf, and sharing that experience with 
others in the organization (Anderson, 2010). As this 
experience accumulates it is also analyzed by various 
sectors within the organization (e.g., the finance 
department, the marketing department, the research 
and development department) and the product of 
this analysis is knowledge.
An example of such knowledge in the scenario 
discussed above might be the realization that coffee 
stores do not do well when they are located in zip 
codes that have experienced more than seven per­
cent unemployment within the last three years. This 
piece of information is no doubt interesting, but it 
does not really mean much unless it is put to use by 
the organization to make a change in its behavior. 
This is the type of change that is central to organi­
zational learning. Perhaps the more experienced 
coffee chain, after realizing the importance of the 
seven percent unemployment metric for predicting 
the success of its location, would decide to change its 
business practices to exclude from consideration and 
potential location that has experienced greater than 
seven percent unemployment in the last three years. 
This change would be the result of organizational 
learning—that is, observing information in the real 
world, analyzing that information and making pre­
dictions about it, and then adjusting company behav­
ior based on those predictions (Boonstra, 2013).
Single and Double Loop Organizations
Because organizational learning is a field that lends 
itself to multiple layers of abstraction, there have been 
several theories developed to try to explain the dif­
ferent mechanisms used by organizations to acquire, 
store, process, and transfer knowledge. Some of 
these are the single and double loop theories, which 
analyze the ways in which organizations respond to 
failure. Single loop organizations that experience a 
failure in their efforts respond by adjusting the meth­
ods used in those efforts and trying again to see if 
the change produces a success. An example of this 
might be a company that tries to increase sales of its 
products by advertising on the radio, only to find this 
method ineffective. The company might decide to 
try again, but using television advertising instead of 
radio.
Conversely, a double loop organization in this situ­
ation would be unlikely to try a different advertising 
medium, and more likely to reconsider whether the 
product being marketed was actually viable in the 
marketplace. This is because double loop organiza­
tions, upon experiencing failure, tend to reconsider 

Organizational Learning

the overall goal of their efforts rather than question 
the methods used.
While these two different types of organizational 
learning may seem very different, they actually exist 
at different times and at different levels of most orga­
nizations, and can even be employed side by side 
under some circumstances (Godwyn & Gittell, 2012).
Learning Curves
A learning curve in the context of organizational 
knowledge management is a graph that repre­
sents how an organization’s performance of a task 
improves over time, as the organization gains experi­
ence at performing the task. Often this improvement 
is due to the organization discovering ways that it 
can perform the task more efficiently, though other 
factors may also play a role. The factors that play the 
most significant role in an organization improving 
its performance typically fall into one of three cat­
egories: individual, structural, and technological. 
Technological changes are enabled by advanced 
in technology (Iyengar, Sweeney & Montealegre, 
2015). The classic example is of a sales force, in the 
days before the Internet, receiving personal digital 
assistants that enable them to collect and share their 
sales data much more quickly and easily. Individual 
changes are also fairly straightforward, as these 
include the experience acquired by individual mem­
bers of the organization while they perform their 
duties.
The more complex concept is that of structural 
change (Eddy, 2014). This refers to adaptations 
the organization makes in response to information 
it receives, because these changes affect the struc­
ture of the organization’s operations and processes. 
Each of these factors is at play in every organization 
as it interacts with its environment, but the particu­
lar nature of an organization influences the degree 
to which it responds to information. This explains 
why different organizations exhibit faster or slower 
responses to the information they receive, and why 
some organizational responses are more effective 
than others.
Different theorists have tried to explain variations 
in organizational performance using a variety of 
models.
The models that have garnered the most attention 
are those developed by John F. Muth, Bernardo A. 
Huberman, and Christina Fang. Muth’s main area of 
focus was on adaptations that increase an organiza­
tion’s cost effectiveness. Huberman continued this 
general approach, but sought to simplify the number 
of steps used in the analysis conducted by the orga­
nization. Fang’s model explores the propagation of 
credit throughout the organization as part of the ana­
lytical process, making it possible for the organiza­
tion to more accurately identify information that will 
help improve institutional processes (Lewis, 2015).
Explicit and Tacit Knowledge
Not all types of information and knowledge that are 
used in organizational learning are equally acces­
sible. Many researchers acknowledge the distinction 
between knowledge that is explicit within the orga­
nization, and that which is tacit. Explicit knowledge 
consists of information that the organization “knows 
that it knows.” This is information that the orga­
nization is aware of and deliberately tries to put to 
good use, whether it is sales data, transcripts of focus 
groups discussing the relative merits of potential 
products in development, or responses to an annual 
employee satisfaction survey. The foremost quality 
that makes explicit information easier to deal with is 
that the organization knows it exists and has a place 
to keep it so that it can be put to good use.
This is not the case with tacit knowledge. Tacit 
knowledge is the organization’s set of unwritten 
rules; those who need to know a particular rule are 
aware of it, but these rules are not written down 
anywhere, and might even be at odds with the com­
pany’s official position statements. An example of 
tacit knowledge might be the fact that every scientist 
working for company X’s research and development 
department knows that the only way to get a research 
proposal approved is to have someone from market­
ing included as a co-author of the proposal (Burke, 
2014). This is not the company’s official policy, and 
the company might prefer not to have this informa­
tion about its internal workings made public knowl­
edge, but it remains a “fact of life” known to all of the 
company’s employees that are affected by it.
Companies that wish to take fullest advantage of 
their learning opportunities must make every effort 
to pay as much attention to tacit organizational 
knowledge as they do to knowledge that is explicit. 
Tacit knowledge is often possessed by those mem­
bers of the organization with the longest tenure or 
the deepest insight into the hidden machinations of

the institution. As such, it tends to be some of the 
most precious information that the organization pos­
sesses, and this means that it is vital to try to capture 
it before it disappears, either through the departure 
from the organization of those in possession of it or 
through its tendency to fade away as more pressing 
matters confront the organization and demand its 
collective attention (Argote, 2013).

Performance Appraisal
ABSTRACT
Performance appraisal is the process of evaluating 
an employee’s performance and providing feedback. 
Appraisals are necessary not only for employees to 
understand and improve their performance on the 
job and for employers to adequately evaluate and 
select their employees for rewards (e.g., money, pres-
tige, promotion), but it is also important so that the 
organization can determine the degree to which its 
employees are contributing toward meeting strategic 
goals and objectives. There are many ways to judge 
an employee’s performance on the job ranging from 
objective performance data to global rating scales 
to more detailed rating scales that represent each 
of the important aspects of the job. No matter the 
method used, however, it is vital that the rating scales 
be anchored to objective, well-defined criteria of job 
success. This will help ensure that the performance 
appraisal system is not only accurate but also fair.
OVERVIEW
There is an old saying that advises, “if you do not 
know where you are going, you will never get there.” 
Certainly, nowhere is this truer than in a business or 
organizational setting. From an employee’s perspec-
tive, knowing where one wants to go may mean want-
ing to do the things on the job that will help ensure 
a pay raise or promotion. From the organization’s 
perspective, knowing where one is going may mean 
wanting to do the things that will improve its effective-
ness and efficiency and, in general, help it become a 
high-performing organization. However, neither the 
employee nor the organization can meet these goals 
unless they know how they are currently performing 
and can determine what changes must be made in 
order to improve overall performance. For the indi-
vidual, this information usually comes in the form 
of feedback from a performance appraisal or review. 
Performance appraisal is the process of evaluating an 
employee’s work performance and providing feedback 
on how well he or she is doing, typically against some 
standard of performance for that job. Performance 
appraisal can also provide the organization with some 
of the information that it needs in order to make stra-
tegic decisions to help it succeed in the marketplace.
Uses for Performance Appraisal Information
Performance appraisal is one of the key functions 
of an organization’s human resources department. 
Organizations use the data collected in performance 
appraisal systems for several purposes. Perhaps the 
most well known of these is to establish standards and 
an evaluation system that can be used to form the 
basis of judgments as to whether to reward employees 
for good performance or punish them for poor per-
formance. For example, management might set an 
individual productivity target of manufacturing two 
hundred widgets per day. Those who meet this stan-
dard might be given a pay raise or bonus and those 
who do not might not receive a monetary reward or 
may be put on probation. Performance appraisal data 
are also used to provide the criterion information that 
is used to select new candidates for the job. For exam-
ple, the results of a job analysis might tell management 
what tasks a production worker needs to perform on 
the job. This information is used in conjunction with 
performance appraisal data that provide information 
regarding the standards to which employees must be 
able to perform these tasks in order to develop criteria 
to be used in hiring new employees for the job.
Another use for performance appraisal data is to 
provide objectives for organizational training pro-
grams. For example, if a department-wide perfor-
mance appraisal finds that widget makers do not 
have the necessary skills to meet the organization’s 
goal of two hundred widgets per employee per day, 
the human resources department might design or 
contract for a training program that would teach line

workers the skills necessary to be better able to meet 
this goal. Finally, performance appraisal data can pro-
vide management with the data needed to provide 
feedback to employees and to better control their 
behavior on the job. In most cases, both the employ-
ees and management would like to see improved 
performance on the job. From the employees’ per-
spective, improved performance can be the key to 
raises, bonuses, perks, and promotions. Such things 
can help them better meet their needs on the job or 
in other areas of their lives. Similarly, management 
would like to see improved performance because it 
helps to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of 
the organization, improves the return on investment 
for hiring and training, and helps the organization 
reach its strategic goals and become a high-perform-
ing organization.
Job Analyses
Before an objective performance appraisal system 
can be developed, one must first perform a job analy-
sis to determine what tasks are actually performed 
on the job, the standards to which these tasks need 
to be performed, and the knowledge, skills, abili-
ties, and other characteristics necessary in order to 
adequately perform these tasks. Job analysis is the 
systematic, empirical process of determining the 
exact nature of a job, including the tasks and duties 
to be done; the knowledge, skills, and abilities nec-
essary to adequately perform these tasks and duties; 
and the criteria that distinguish between acceptable 
and unacceptable performance. The results of a job 
analysis are typically used in writing job descriptions, 
selecting new employees for hire, and setting stan-
dards for use in performance appraisals.
Performance appraisals need to be based on the 
tasks that are actually required to be performed on 
the job rather than on some general impression of 
the performance of the employee. These tasks and 
the standards to which they must be performed are 
usually based on a solid job description based on an 
objective, thorough job analysis. Good job descrip-
tions and the performance appraisals that are based 
on them are competency based, describing the job in 
terms of measurable, observable, behavioral compe-
tencies that the employee must demonstrate in order 
to perform the job well. For example, rather than say-
ing that a salesperson needs to have good customer 
rapport, the employee would be required to do such 
things as greet the customer within thirty seconds of 
entering the store, immediately drop any tasks not 
directly related to helping customers in the store if 
a customer needs help, or any other requirement 
found to be important to good work performance 
as determined by the job analysis. The performance 
standards developed as a product of a thorough job 
analysis are then used not only to frame the perfor-
mance appraisal criteria but also to communicate to 
employees what kind of behavior will be rewarded 
(or not rewarded) by the organization. Performance 
appraisal data are then used to give employees feed-
back on how well they are meeting the standards in 
order to encourage high performance.
Further Insights
Methods of Data Collection
There are many sources of data that can be used in 
developing a performance appraisal system. For 
some jobs, empirical, quantitative data are available 
to objectively judge the quality of an employee’s work. 
For example, for production workers, one might 
use a combination of quantitative data such as the 
average number of widgets produced per hour, the 
amount of waste material produced as a byproduct of 
manufacturing that number of widgets, and the num-
ber of widgets produced that are within specification.
In addition to objective production data, in some 
situations there are personnel data that are available 
that need to be taken into account when judging an 
employee’s performance. For example, one might 
want to consider the number of days the employee 
was late to work, excessive days taken off, or other 
hard data that might be found in the employee’s 
personnel file that address the employee’s level of 
performance on the job. Although sometimes per-
sonnel data can be useful adjuncts when judging per-
formance, they are typically not a substitute for more 
directly related data concerning performance.
Of course, not every job can be neatly reduced to 
quantifiable data. Although one can judge the per-
formance of manufacturing workers, for example, 
based on the number of widgets they produce per 
hour, such objective data are not available for every 
position. In the twenty-first century, an increasing 
number of employees are knowledge workers and 
deal in the realm of information and expertise rather 
than in the realm of tangible products. For example, 

Performance Appraisal
Principles of Business: Management
324
although it is possible to collect data on the number 
of calls a technical support employee takes on a help 
line, this datum does not provide information on 
how difficult the problem was, how well it was solved, 
how polite the employee was to the customer, or how 
satisfied the customer was with the service. As most 
of us who use technical support lines know, these are 
important pieces of information and are not captured 
in the easily collectible “number of calls per hour” 
statistic. To help management make better-informed 
decisions regarding an employee’s performance, it is 
often necessary to collect subjective, judgmental data 
regarding performance. An example of this kind of 
data collection instrument is the “short survey” that 
often pops up after an online interaction with a sales 
or support employee.
Rating Scales
There are many approaches to designing a rat-
ing scale to be used in performance appraisal. The 
simplest of these is the global rating scale in which 
each employee is given a single score that rates his 
or her overall performance. However, global ratings 
do not give the employee sufficient data for how to 
improve his or her performance. In addition, such 
scales are prone to various kinds of rating error (see 
below). Therefore, many organizations develop 
rating scales based on job-related data and stan-
dards. One can use a job description, for example, 
to break out the major aspects of the job and then 
rate employees on each of these aspects. However, 
without well-defined standards for poor, acceptable, 
and outstanding performance, such rating scales can 
also be highly subjective in nature and prone to rat-
ing errors. Behaviorally anchored rating scales and 
mixed standards rating scales are two techniques 
that can be used to increase the objectivity of rating 
scales and link them to tangible, job-related criteria. 
Both these methods are based on the collection of 
critical incidents to discern between good and poor 
performance on the job. These critical incidents are 
used to anchor the rating scales and judge current 
employees against these criteria of success or failure 
on the job.
As mentioned above, rating scales and other 
instruments that are used to collect subjective data 
can be easily affected by various rating errors. The 
most common of these are halo error, leniency error, 
and central tendency error.
The halo error (sometimes referred to as the 
halo/horn error depending on which direction the 
error is made) occurs when a manager or other rater 
judges a person in all aspects of job performance 
based on a single aspect of the job or, on whether he 
or she likes the individual. For example, if someone is 
seen as an excellent worker (or nice person) in gen-
eral, the rater may overlook performance problems 
in the individual’s work and rate him or her highly on 
all aspects of the job.
The leniency error (sometimes referred to as 
the leniency/severity error) occurs when a rater 
tends to rate employees in general higher (or lower) 
than they would be if the rater had been objective. 
For example, some supervisors tend to be lenient 
in the ratings because they want to be kind to their 
employees and, as a result, rate them higher than 
they deserve. Similarly, some supervisors believe that 
everyone can always improve and, therefore, tend to 
rate their employees more severely than they objec-
tively deserve.
The central tendency error occurs when a super-
visor tends to give ratings toward the middle of the 
scale, believing that although the employees have 
room for improvement, they also do not deserve to 
be punished for their performance.
Management by Objectives (MBO)
It is important to evaluate an employee’s perfor-
mance by measuring it against a predetermined stan-
dard or set of specific goals to be achieved during 
the appraisal period. Rating scales are one way to do 
this; another popular way is through a method called 
Management by Objectives (MBO). In MBO, manag-
ers or the manager and employee together set objec-
tives for the employee to meet during the upcoming 
appraisal period. Employees are evaluated in terms 
of how well they have met these goals in the inter-
vening period. MBO can be used not only to evalu-
ate the performance of an individual employee, but 
also that of a workgroup, department, or the orga-
nization as a whole. Under this approach, organiza-
tion-wide goals and objectives based on its strategic 
plan (e.g., increase company profits from the wid-
get product line by $500,000 over the next year) are 
first set. Using this information, each department or 
workgroup then sets its own goals and objectives to 
support the organization’s goals (e.g., increase sales 
of widgets in the Eastern Region by 10 percent over 

Principles of Business: Management

325
the next year). Managers and individual employees 
then discuss these goals and possible contributions 
that can be made by each individual and set specific, 
short-term goals (e.g., obtain ten more customers 
per quarter; call on five more potential customers 
per week; include two more cities in the region), and 
individual objectives are set.
Like rating scales, however, MBO is not with-
out its drawbacks. One of the most frequent is the 
development of objectives that are either unclear 
or unmeasurable. For example, in the example of 
“good customer rapport,” if there is no operational 
definition of the concept, then the objective is as 
open to rating error as a poorly written rating scale. 
Similarly, some objectives are unreasonable, such 
as the objective for a research scientist to develop a 
cure for cancer within the next year. Another diffi-
culty with setting MBO objectives is that supervisors 
tend to set objectives that are too difficult to meet 
while employees tend to set objectives that are too 
easy to meet.
360-Degree Feedback
To help ensure fair evaluations under a perfor-
mance appraisal system, human resource policies 
or procedures are developed and implemented 
to help increase the objectiveness of the appraisal 
feedback or give the employee feedback from mul-
tiple sources. A technique called 360-degree feed-
back (because the feedback comes from people who 
work all around the employee, not just from one 
person working above him or her) gives employees 
feedback on their job performance from represen-
tatives of the major groups with whom they interact 
on the job both inside and outside the organization. 
Under 360-degree feedback, for example, employ-
ees may receive feedback not only from their super-
visors but also from their subordinates, coworkers, 
customers, and other groups with whom they work. 
By doing this, an employee receives more feedback 
than he or she would receive under the traditional 
supervisor-only appraisal system. This approach to 
feedback can also help neutralize biased opinions of 
one person by giving the employee and the supervi-
sor and range of reactions to look at so that they can 
look at the preponderance of evidence rather than 
reactions from just one person and, in general, give 
the employee a better idea of how s/he can improve 
performance.
Issues
Pay-for-Performance
Performance appraisal tools and systems are not ends 
in and of themselves. Among the major purposes 
of performance appraisal are the ability to provide 
employees with measurable criteria of success on the 
job and to provide feedback on how they can improve 
their performance in order to better meet their perfor-
mance goals and objectives. One of the ways in which 
performance appraisal data are frequently being used 
is to link pay to performance. Under this paradigm, 
an employee is rewarded financially for high perfor-
mance and contributing to the organization’s goals. 
Pay-for-performance systems can be used at all levels 
of the organization, including “C-level” personnel 
(e.g., chief executive officer, chief operating officer).
The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
has investigated the viability of pay-for-performance 
systems and has found a number of factors that make 
them successful. First, it is important to use objective 
competencies to assess the quality of the employee’s 
performance. As discussed above, this means that 
performance objectives need to be based on the 
empirical data developed through a thorough job 
analysis and be written in such a way that employees 
can achieve them. Second, employee performance 
ratings need to be directly tied to pay increases or 
awards so that employees can see a direct, positive 
consequence of their actions. In this way, employees 
are more likely to continue to perform at a level that 
will bring rewards. Third, fair pay-for-performance 
systems need to consider both the employee’s current 
salary and his or her contribution to the organization 
so that rewards for similar contributions are equita-
ble. Finally, pay-for-performance systems needs to be 
clear and well published so that employees know the 
basis on which decisions are made and what kind of 
awards are made across the organization.
CONCLUSION
Performance appraisal is one of the key elements of 
the human resources function within an organiza-
tion. This process of evaluating an employee’s perfor-
mance and providing feedback is necessary not only 
for the individual to improve his or her performance 
on the job so that he or she can earn the rewards for 
which he or she is working, such as a promotion or

raise, but it is also important so that the organization 
can determine the degree to which its employees are 
contributing to meeting its strategic goals and objec-
tives. Performance appraisal data can also be used for 
other purposes as well, including as inputs into train-
ing programs or to develop criteria on which to hire 
new employees.
There are many ways to judge an employee’s per-
formance on the job ranging from objective perfor-
mance data to global rating scales to more detailed 
rating scales that represent each of the important 
aspects of the job. However, whenever a subjective 
rating method is used, it is vital that the rating scales 
be anchored to objective, well-defined criteria of job 
success. This will help ensure that the performance 
appraisal system is not only accurate but fair.

Personal Lines Insurance & Risk Management
ABSTRACT
People face risks in everyday life that carry the poten-
tial of economic ruin. Automobile accidents can cause 
severe injury, loss of property and liability for injury 
to another. Sickness and personal injuries can cause 
significant expenses and prevent a person from work-
ing, thereby hastening an economic demise. Houses 
and possessions can be wiped out without warning and 
can leave a person homeless or an injury on a person’s 
premises can result in life altering legal liability debt. In 
the face of all these potential sources of disaster, a per-
son can and should manage the risk they face in their 
personal lives. Judicious use of the personal lines insur-
ance form a powerful set of tools for the individual 
to manage risk by exchanging a potentially huge and 
uncertain future expense for the piece of mind and 
certainty that the fixed premium payment can bring. 
This article discusses the nature of insurance, the most 
common types of personal lines insurances and how 
individuals may use them to effectively manage risk.
OVERVIEW
The normal activities of daily life can carry the risk 
of enormous financial loss for individuals and their 
loved ones. While most of these events are rela-
tively rare and uncertain for a particular individual, 
they are real and often occur without warning. 
Therefore, most people are willing to pay a small 
and predictable fixed amount for protection against 
the occurrence of an unpredictable event that car-
ries catastrophic economic consequences. This is 
the basic nature of insurance. Personal lines insur-
ance refers to a subset of insurance products that 
are purchased by individuals for their personal pro-
tection. Popular types of personal lines insurance 
are home, automobile and health insurance. This 
article will overview the nature and history of insur-
ance as well as the features and benefits of some 
popular personal lines mentioned.
Insurance is a contract, commonly called a policy, 
in which an individual or entity makes regular pay-
ments, called a premium. In return for premiums, an 
insurer promises to reimburse or compensate against 
losses incurred by the insured. Parties involved in an 
insurance policy are the insured (individual or entity 
paying premiums), the insurer (usually an insurance 
company), and the beneficiary (party designated to 
receive payment under the policy). The insured and 
beneficiary may be the same person or a different 
person, as in the case of life insurance where benefits 
are paid to one person upon the death of another. 
The range of occurrences that can result in payment 
by the insurance company under the policy are some-
times called covered events. The terms of the policy 
determine the amount of the payment and define the 
range of covered events; therefore, recovery under 
the policy may be in either whole or in part upon the 
happening of a covered event.
This insurance arrangement, in a broad economic 
sense, transfers the risk of loss from an individual to a 
larger group that is better able to pay for the losses. In 
fact, the sharing of risk between members of group is 
the defining feature of an insurance policy. In other 
words, a contract that distributes risk is an insurance 
policy. Insurance companies create insurance poli-
cies by grouping certain risks together. This group-
ing provides the uniformity that covered risks which 
allows insurers to predict their potential losses and 
set premiums accordingly. For example, drivers that 
have been in accidents and who have been ticketed 
for violations of the traffic law may form a high-risk 
group that are more likely to collect benefits from the 
insurance company. Therefore, an insurance policy 
to protect such drivers would be more expensive. The 
insurance company profits by investing the premiums 
it receives. A well-developed area of law governs insur-
ance. Insurance policies are subject to the require-
ments of statues, administrative agency regulations, 
and the court decisions interpreting both of them.
To satisfy the insurance needs of the American 
public, the insurance industry is composed of 
roughly 1600 life and Health Insurance companies 
and possibly 3000 property and casualty reinsurance 
companies. The United States is the world’s largest 
insurance market, accounting for approximately 
34% of all the 2.3 trillion dollars of premiums paid 
in world at the end of the twentieth century. Life 
and Health Insurance in the United States repre-
sents approximately 20% of the worldwide market, 
second to Japan’s roughly 29% and far ahead of the

United Kingdom’s 10% ranked third (Encyclopedia 
of Business & Finance, 2008).
Life Insurance
The life insurance industry reports date back to the 
colonial times. Early colonists were initially skeptical 
of life insurance as many considered it a gambling 
and against their religion. However, the expan-
sion of the United States economy from 1830 to 
1837 increased the American need to protect their 
financial prosperity. Four large mutual companies 
were founded during that period. The first was 
the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York 
(founded in 1843) and it is currently the oldest prac-
ticing insurance company. As the insurance indus-
try became an increasingly important component 
of the economy, governments began to legislate in 
the area. Massachusetts was the first state to estab-
lish an insurance department in 1855, by 1890 most 
states had established insurance departments and by 
1940 all states regulated insurance (Encyclopedia of 
American History, 2008).
Life insurance provides financial benefits to a 
specified person, the beneficiary, upon the death of 
the insured party. There are several types of life insur-
ance. A major distinction between the types of life 
insurance policies is whether they are term or whole 
life. Term life insurance provides benefits for a ben-
eficiary if the insured dies within a specific period 
of time, or “Term,” such as twenty years. Because a 
person may outlive the defined term of the policy, 
payment on the policy is not assured. Premium pay-
ments are required throughout and those premiums, 
once paid, are not refunded even if the insurance 
company does not pay out on the policy. For this rea-
son, term life insurance is typically far less expensive 
than whole life.
Term life insurance policies have several impor-
tant uses related to ensuring adequate financing dur-
ing a specific period of time. For example, a young 
person that just starting in the working may be take-
out a 20 year term policy to protect young children 
against the economic losses that would arise if the 
insured died while the children were still minors. 
Lenders may also require that debtor buy an insur-
ance policy as a term o f a loan to ensure repayment 
in the event of the debtors death, In that situation the 
lender would likely require to named beneficiary of 
the insurance policy.
Whole Life
Whole life insurance is the other major category of 
life insurance and has several variants. The defining 
features of whole life insurance are the guaranteed 
eventual pay out of the agreed upon benefit and 
the policy accumulation of cash value on the policy. 
The cash value of policy can generally be recovered 
by the insured by surrendering the policy for the 
cash. The cash value can also act as collateral that 
the insured may borrow against. For this reason, a 
whole life policy is considered an investment vehicle 
in addition to an insurance product. The whole life 
policy has several varieties including “universal life” 
and “variable life.” Universal life allows the insured 
to vary the amount and timing of premium pay-
ments that are otherwise fixed under a traditional 
whole life model.
Health Insurance
Health Insurance began in the mid 19th century with 
accident insurance and protection from a small num-
ber of diseases. The Travelers Insurance Company, 
founded in 1863, receives credit for writing the first 
insurance policy in the United States. This first pol-
icy contained a schedule of benefits payable to the 
insured for each particular illness or injury. In the 
beginning of the twentieth century, states began to 
enact workers’ compensation laws to protect employ-
ees from the economic effects of injury on the job. 
These laws raised interest in group health insur-
ance contracts for illnesses and non-work related 
injuries. Towards the middle of the twentieth cen-
tury, employer provided health insurance plans for 
employees became an important fringe benefit in 
collective bargaining agreements. With the costs of 
medical care rising, Major Medical Insurance devel-
oped in response to the increased demand for poli-
cies that would protect families against prolonged 
and serious illnesses.
The insurance industry faced and overcame a 
number of challenges in the end of the twentieth 
century. After the 1992 presidential election, health 
insurance companies came under attack from 
the Clinton Administration which argued that the 
insurance industry’s methods harmed the medical 
community. President Clinton advocated a com-
petitive model known as managed competition. The 
insurance industry, however, launched a successful 
television campaign against the proposed reform. 

Personal Lines Insurance & Risk Management
Principles of Business: Management
330
Larger insurers responded by developing health 
maintenance organizations (HMO) to regulate care 
and costs.
The extreme rises in medical costs, neverthe-
less, remained a problem and Americans increas-
ingly lost or dropped their unaffordable insurance 
policies. Barack Obama campaigned on a pledge to 
deliver universal healthcare to Americans in 2008, 
and in 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act was passed over the vehement protests of 
many Republicans in Congress and leaders of the 
rising Tea Party movement. The act required pri-
vate coverage in order to spread the cost over a large 
and healthier pool of insureds, but forbid restric-
tions based on pre-existing conditions. Government 
exchanges were created at the federal and state lev-
els for the convenience of shoppers, high-deductible 
plans were eliminated, and subsidies were made avail-
able for low-income Americans. Critics on the Left 
asserted that the act was a gift to private insurance 
companies while those on the Right pronounced 
it socialism. Many of the provisions of the act were 
well received, but with a rocky rollout of the federal 
exchange, healthcare.gov, wariness of the new system 
was widespread (Custer2013).
Property & Casualty Insurance
For most people, their homes are their most valu-
able assets, biggest investment and potential source 
of liability. Prudent financial planning and savings 
can be wiped out overnight by natural disaster, fire 
or legal liability for injury that occurred on a per-
son’s property. Property and casualty insurance is 
intended to protect people from these types of risks. 
While mortgage lenders typically require borrow-
ers to insure their homes as a condition of the loan, 
many homeowners may be underinsured against 
these types of risks, particularly for catastrophic 
risks to their homes. Homeowners in certain areas 
of the country must be certain that policies cover 
the risks specific to their geographic area. For 
example, Californians may be exposed to risk from 
brush fires, mudslides, and earthquakes. Floridians 
must ensure protection from hurricanes and floods. 
In certain situations when a house may be particu-
larly valuable or unique, securing an appraisal by an 
appraiser approved by the insurance company may 
be an important step to avoid a gap in insurance 
coverage (Stolz, 2007).
To avoid or minimize risk, especially with respect 
to catastrophic losses, homeowners would be wise 
to analyze and understand the extent of their cov-
erage in the event of a disaster. For example, a 
homeowner may be responsible for a “windstorm 
deductible” in the event of a hurricane. Insurance 
companies began including these deductibles after 
the massive losses caused by Hurricane Andrew. As 
opposed to other deductibles that are stated in dol-
lar amounts, this deductible may appear as a per-
centage of the policy value. A 1% deductible would 
mean that on a $400,000 policy, a homeowner 
would have to pay $20,000 before the insurer 
would incur any liability.
Automobile Insurance
The first automobile insurance policy was issued by 
the Travelers Insurance Company in 1898. As the 
number of drivers in the United States increased, 
the value of automobile insurance became apparent. 
Indeed, automobile insurance became so broadly 
accepted that most states required vehicle owners to 
carry insurance on their vehicles. The state required 
insurance is generally considered a bare minimum 
and well below the recommended amount of cover-
age for a vehicle. Following consumer dissatisfaction 
with automobile insurance rates in the late 1980s and 
1990s, some states implemented no-fault automo-
bile insurance to reduce litigation. A no-fault system 
requires all drivers to carry insurance for their own 
protection, requires the insurance carrier to pay, up 
to policy limits, for the insured injuries, medical bills 
and property damages, regardless of who caused the 
accident. The typical no-fault system limits the abil-
ity of drivers to sue one another perhaps except in 
cases of severe injury. Typical no-fault state insur-
ance laws allow accident victims to receive reimburse-
ment for financial losses such as medical and hospital 
expenses as well as lost income from their own insur-
ance companies and often place restrictions on the 
right to sue.
APPLICATIONS
The internet has transformed business and society 
in general; the insurance industry has likewise been 
affected by the internet, to the benefit of the con-
sumer. In the past, purchasing insurance meant a 
visit to a local agent who may or may not have the best 

Principles of Business: Management
Personal Lines Insurance & Risk Management
331
rates or coverage for a particular consumer. Shopping 
around for the ideal coverage and rate meant actu-
ally meeting with a number of agents. The internet 
has enabled consumers to shop and compare offer-
ings of many different insurance companies almost 
instantly with the use of aggregator cites that rapidly 
compare quotes from different companies either live 
on the screen or by email.
However, consumers should understand that this 
rapid flow of information may not always cause prices 
to fall into line among competitors as one might 
expect. Using the internet for an insurance purchase 
removes the potentially valuable advice and resources 
of an insurance agent and an inattentive consumer 
may pay too much for an insurance product that inad-
equately addresses their needs. For example, auto 
insurance quotes can vary widely between insurers for 
the same vehicle, with the difference between the low-
est and highest price being as much as 85%. Different 
insurers also vary widely on the degree of control a 
consumer may have over the specific content of their 
policies. To minimize the chances of making an error 
with an online purchase, consumers may consider 
visiting many different websites, calculating precisely 
what rates, plans or special offers actually cost, under-
standing what a plan actually covers despite its name, 
remaining weary of ubiquitous promises to save the 
consumer money, and finally a consumer should con-
sider asking an insurance agent for explanation of 
foreign concepts and to help in negotiations for the 
bet rates possible (Trembly, 2007).
In addition to rapid comparison shopping to dis-
cover the lowest prices, consumers also benefit from 
a more rapid and simplified purchasing experience 
that is powered by interactive forms. The information 
flow enabled by the internet allows insurance compa-
nies to increase efficiency and accuracy with online 
data collection. Insurance companies are deploying 
powerful technology to increase overall efficiency in 
other areas of their business as well. Consumers may 
now pay premiums, file and track claims and change 
deductibles online. Insurers use modern information 
technologies to streamline loss reporting. Insurance 
company online activity indirectly benefits the con-
sumer both in terms of convenience and by allowing 
the insurance companies to reflect the efficiency in 
lower prices The insurance companies are then able 
to pass on the advantage of those efficiencies to con-
sumers in the form of lower rates.
CONCLUSION
When considered together, there appears to be an 
overwhelming number of risks in everyday life that 
carry the potential for personal economic ruin. 
Automobile accidents can cause severe injury, loss of 
property and liability for injury to another. Sickness 
and personal injuries can cause significant expenses 
and prevent a person from working, thereby hasten-
ing an economic demise. Houses and possessions 
can be wiped out without warning and can leave a 
person homeless, or an injury on a person’s premises 
can result in life altering legal liability debt. In the 
face of all these potential sources of disaster, a person 
can and should manage the risks they face in their 
personal lives. Judicious use of personal lines insur-
ance forms a powerful set of tools for the individual 
to manage risk by exchanging a potentially huge and 
uncertain future expense for the piece of mind and 
certainty that the fixed premium payment can bring.
While some types of insurance, e.g. house and auto-
mobile, may be required by the government or a lender, 
the consumer should be attentive to personal needs and 
must not rely on required coverage without understand-
ing their personal needs and the insurance products 
offered. Effective risk management must include an 
analysis of the understanding of the risk and attendant 
losses that a person may face. Fortunately, the internet 
provides a powerful tool to learn about our insurance 
needs and make purchases to fulfill those needs.

Principles of Management
ABSTRACT
This article examines how managers execute the 
primary functions of management including strat-
egy development, business planning, organization, 
control, and leadership. The impact of contempo-
rary factors such as globalization and information 
technologies is reviewed and the new methods that 
managers use to execute primary functions are 
explained. The use of metrics as a tool to develop 
strategies and plan and organize business activi-
ties is examined. The use of analytics as a tool to 
control business processes and optimize business 
resources and opportunities is also examined. The

importance of developing human resources is exam-
ined along with popular contemporary methods for 
staff development.
OVERVIEW
The functions and activities of managers have 
remained relatively unchanged over time. Managers 
have always had to develop strategy, plan business 
activities, organize business functions, control pro-
cesses, and lead and develop people, all in a manner 
that successfully drives businesses. However, what has 
changed over time is how managers have viewed and 
executed these functions (Hill & McShane, 2008). In 
addition, the challenges faced by managers have also 
changed as technologies and business conditions 
have evolved.
Technological innovation can play a significant 
role in determining how well a company performs. 
To what extent a company decides to pursue inno-
vative methods may depend on available resources 
as well as competition in the business arena. From 
a strategic perspective, companies can commit to a 
high level of innovation in order to discourage new 
competitors from enter a business as well as to sig-
nal existing competitors that the cost of maintaining 
a product or service could become more costly for 
them (Corts, 2000).
Effects of Global Markets
Corporate Governance Systems
Corporate governance is related to corporate per-
formance (Chun-Yao, Zong-Jhe, & Chun-Yi, 2013). 
Globalization certainly increases competition but it 
also expands the marketplace. However, increased 
competition and expanding markets can also strain 
corporate governance systems that have become 
accustomed to a smaller sale of operation as well as 
not having to contend with additional and perhaps 
previously unknown competitors. Corporate gov-
ernance systems are also structured differently in 
some countries, especially those settings where the 
national governments control competition or are 
heavily invested in large corporations in those coun-
tries. Since companies in countries where the econ-
omy is largely market-oriented may be able to achieve 
greater degrees of efficiency and thus be more com-
petitive over companies in settings where national 
government ownership or control of companies hin-
ders economic performance, competition with these 
foreign firms will significantly impact firms.
Organizational Structure
Globalization of competition and of markets may also 
spur companies to create more decentralized man-
agement and control structures. This could result in 
network-like structures where central management 
functions may not be able to meet the needs of local 
operations. This could create some redundancy in 
functional departments in order to meet local needs, 
while still maintaining a central headquarters or a 
primary location for company operations. To a cer-
tain extent, the company’s divisions or business units 
located in other countries can become highly inde-
pendent for centralized control and the oversight of 
the corporate governance structure (Börsch, 2005).
Historically, corporate structures have fluctuated 
from highly centralized control structures to strong 
autonomy at the division level and sometimes back 
again. Globalization has contributed to shifts in these 
structures, but it is important to recognize that fluctua-
tions in the level of control that corporate headquarters 
has over business units are likely to continue to occur.
Global Standards
A global economy has also led to the emergence 
of global standards. In December 2000, the 
International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) issued revisions to the ISO 9000 Standard 
series. These revisions had a substantial change in 
focus, which actually makes the standard more useful 
for organizations seeking to improve performance 
and profitability (Vragel, 2001). The year 2000 revi-
sions changed both the structure and focus of the 
standard. The auditable portion of the standard has 
changed from 20 sections to five, specifically:

 Quality management system.

 Management responsibility.

 Resource management.

 Product realization.

 Measurement, analysis and improvement (Vragel, 
2001).
Competitiveness
While it is important to observe and embrace the 
global quality improvement movement, the “search 

Principles of Management
Principles of Business: Management
334
for competitiveness and competitive advantage 
appears to be endless. The pressures of the complex, 
unpredictable, and dynamic business environment, 
global market competitions, and organizational 
change have promoted and sustained the search for 
competitiveness. The factors influencing and deter-
mining competitiveness are numerous and diverse” 
(Mathews, 2006, p. 158).
Competitiveness is achieved by blending a wide 
range of processes into a winning combination. The 
goal is certainly to increase productivity and to oper-
ate more efficiently. A firm’s economic performance 
is connected to the performance of a certain sector, 
region or nation (Hategan, 2012). However, compa-
nies need to identify areas in which they can actually 
become competitive and maintain profitability. As 
corporate executives examine various business strate-
gies they need to simultaneously assess productivity, 
efficiency and profits.
A true competitive advantage is achieved when 
a company develops a value-creating strategy that 
other competitors are not pursuing. Once the strat-
egy is worked out it can be difficult for competitors 
to mimic the strategy and achieve the same level of 
benefits from it (Mathews, 2006).
Decision Making
Managers must continuously make decisions. At almost 
every moment during every day, most executives are 
involved in some phase of decision making. They col-
lect and exchange information, review and analyze 
data, develop scenarios, evaluate alternative business 
tactics and strategies, and review results of activities that 
were undertaken based on previous decisions.
At lower levels, decisions focus on day-to-day 
operations. At higher levels, decisions are focused on 
long-term goals of the company (Brousseau, Driver, 
Hourihan & Larsson, 2006). As information technol-
ogy has evolved, so has the ability of managers to use 
technology to help in the process of developing strat-
egy, planning business activities, organizing business 
functions, controlling processes, and leading and 
developing people. Two new powerful technology-
based tools can assist managers in the decision mak-
ing process — metrics and analytics. Metrics enable 
managers to develop strategies and plan and orga-
nize business activities. Analytics enable managers 
to control business processes and optimize business 
resources and opportunities.
APPLICATIONS
Performance Measurement
For decades corporate executives in every industry 
have worked to fine tune how they affect the perfor-
mance of their businesses. Managers fully understand 
that to improve the efficiency of their operations 
and the effectiveness of their business strategy that 
they need measurement systems. One major shift in 
performance measurement perspectives was to go 
beyond just looking at financial figures and relying 
on a wide array of measurements to judge how well a 
company is performing. Customer satisfaction, cash 
flow, manufacturing effectiveness, and innovation 
are all part of the new perspective of performance 
measurement and management. The dissatisfaction 
with using solely financial measures to evaluate busi-
ness performance started to develop over 50 years 
ago. General Electric, among others, developed 
high-level task forces to identify and analyze alterna-
tive corporate performance measures (Eccles, 1991).
Lack of Preventative Action
Many managers worry that income-based financial 
figures are better at measuring the consequences 
of yesterday’s decisions than they are at indicating 
tomorrow’s performance. Events of the past decade 
substantiate this concern. In the 1980s, some execu-
tives saw the strong financial corporate records fall 
behind due to declines in quality or customer sat-
isfaction which weren’t considered important, or 
because global competitors gained market share. 
Even managers who have not been hurt feel the need 
for preventive action. A senior executive at one of the 
large money-center banks, for example, grew increas-
ingly uneasy about the European part of his business, 
its strong financials notwithstanding. To address 
that concern, he nominated several new measures 
(including customer satisfaction, customers’ percep-
tions of the bank’s stature and professionalism, and 
market share) to serve as leading indicators of the 
business’s performance.
Solutions
Quality Management
Discontent turns into rebellion when people see 
an alternative worth fighting for. During the 1980s, 

Principles of Business: Management
Principles of Management
335
many managers found such an alternative in the qual-
ity movement. Manufacturers and service providers 
have come to see quality as a strategic weapon in their 
competitive battles. Thus, they have delegated signif-
icant resources to develop measures such as defect 
rates, response time, and delivery commitments to 
evaluate the performance of their products, services, 
and operations. Quality management has been one 
of the most popular research areas in the twenty-first 
century (Ebrahimi & Sadeghi, 2013).
In addition to pressure from global competitors, a 
major impetus for these efforts has been the growth 
of the Total Quality Movement and related programs 
such as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. 
(Before a company can even apply for a Baldrige 
Award, it must devise criteria to measure the per-
formance of its entire operation — not just its prod-
ucts — in minute detail.) Another impetus, getting 
stronger by the day, comes from large manufacturers 
that are more and more likely to impose rigid quality 
requirements on their suppliers. Whatever the stimu-
lus, the result is the same: quality measures represent 
the most positive step taken to date in broadening 
the basis of business performance measurement.
Customer Satisfaction
Another step in the same direction comes from 
embryonic efforts to generate measures of customer 
satisfaction. What quality was for the 1980s, customer 
satisfaction was for the 1990s. Work on this class of 
measures is the highest priority at the two manu-
facturing companies discussed earlier. It is equally 
critical at another high-tech company that recently 
created a customer satisfaction department report-
ing directly to the CEO. In each case, management’s 
interest in developing new performance measures 
was triggered by strategies emphasizing customer 
service. Some studies have shown that, to improve 
service quality and maintain customers, organiza-
tions must ensure their employees’ job satisfaction 
(Pansoo & Jang-Hyup, 2013).
As competition continues to stiffen, strate-
gies that focus on quality will evolve naturally into 
strategies based on customer service. Indeed, this 
is already happening at many leading companies. 
Attention to customer satisfaction, which measures 
the quality of customer service, is a logical next step 
in the development of quality measures. Companies 
will continue to measure quality on the basis of 
internally generated indexes (such as defect rates) 
that are presumed to relate to customer satisfac-
tion. But they will also begin to evaluate their per-
formance by collecting data directly from customers 
for more direct measures like customer retention 
rates, market share, and perceived value of goods 
and services.
Competitive Benchmarking
According to Eccles, “just as quality-related metrics 
have made the performance measurement revolu-
tion more real, so has the development of competitive 
benchmarking” (1991, p. 133). First, “benchmarking 
gives managers a methodology that can be applied 
to any measure,” financial or nonfinancial, but that 
emphasizes nonfinancial metrics. Second (and less 
obvious), it has a transforming effect on managerial 
mind-sets and perspectives.
Benchmarking involves identifying competitors 
and/or companies in other industries that “exemplify 
best practice in some activity, function, or process and 
then comparing one’s own performance to theirs. This 
externally oriented approach makes people aware of 
improvements that are orders of magnitude beyond 
what they would have thought possible.” In contrast, 
internal yardsticks that measure current performance 
in relation to prior period results, current budget, or 
the results of other units within the company rarely 
have such an eye-opening effect. Moreover, these 
internally focused comparisons have the disadvan-
tage of breeding complacency through a false sense of 
security and of stirring up more energy for intramural 
rivalry than for competition in the marketplace.
Information Technology
Finally, information technology has played a critical 
role in making a performance measurement revo-
lution possible. Thanks to dramatically improved 
price-performance ratios in hardware and to break-
throughs in software and database technology, orga-
nizations can generate, disseminate, analyze, and 
store more information from more sources, for 
more people, more quickly and cheaply than was 
conceivable even a few years back. Newer technolo-
gies include handheld computers for employees in 
the field and executive information systems for 
senior managers. Overall, the range of measurement 
options that are economically feasible has radically 
increased.

Implementation
Placing these new measures on an equal footing 
with financial data takes significant resources. One 
approach is to assign a senior executive to each of 
the measures and hold him or her responsible for 
developing required methodologies. Typically, these 
executives come from the function that is most expe-
rienced in dealing with the particular measure. But 
they work with a
“multifunctional task force to ensure that man-
agers throughout the company will understand the 
resulting measures and find them useful. Another, 
less common, approach is to create a new function 
focused on one measure and then to expand its man-
date over time. A unit responsible for customer satis-
faction might subsequently take on market share, for 
example, or the company’s performance in human 
resources” (Eccles, p. 1991, 134).
In companies that practice pay-for-performance, 
compensation and other rewards are often tied fairly 
mechanically to a few key financial measures such as 
profitability and return on investment. Convincing 
managers that a newly implemented system is really 
going to be followed can be a hard sell. The presi-
dent of one service company let each of his division 
general managers design the performance measures 
that were most appropriate for his or her particular 
business. Even so, the managers still felt the bottom 
line was all that would matter when it came to promo-
tions and pay.
Aligning incentives to performance is difficult 
because the formulas for tying the two together 
are “rarely effective.” Formulas have the advantage 
of “looking objective, and they spare managers the 
unpleasantness” of having to conduct truly frank per-
formance appraisals. But if “the formula is simple 
and focuses on a few key variables, it inevitably leaves 
some important measures out. Conversely, if the for-
mula is complex and factors in all the variables that 
require attention, people are likely to find it confus-
ing and may start to play games with the numbers. 
Moreover, the relative importance of the variables is 
certain to change more often — and faster — than 
the whole incentive system can change” (Eccles, 
1991, p. 135).
Analytics as a Competitive Tool
Many organizations around the world have been 
implementing a system of analytics to better measure 
performance. There are several companies that have 
achieved a high level of performance measurement 
in industries such as consumer products, finance, 
retail, and travel and entertainment. Notable com-
panies have included Marriott International, United 
Parcel Service, and Progressive Insurance.
Marriott International
Marriott International has worked to fine tune its 
performance measurement and analytics systems for 
over two decades. One of the primary focuses of the 
Marriott system is to establish an optimal price for 
guest rooms and drive revenue. Marriott has taken 
the system further and worked to develop a “Total 
Hotel Optimization program.” This system has 
helped Marriott maximize revenue in conference 
facilities and catering. Analytics has helped the com-
pany develop offerings for frequent customers as well 
as assessing the potential of its frequent and valued 
customers defecting to competitors.
Progressive
Progressive Insurance created value and revenue for 
analyzing insurance industry data in new ways and 
using those results to improve performance. The 
company has identified small niches of potential cus-
tomers. One example is motorcycle riders over age 
30, college educated, high credit scores, and no traf-
fic accidents to date. For each niche group of poten-
tial customers, Progressive performs a regression 
analysis to identify factors that can help to predict 
the likelihood of insured losses that each group will 
experience. These data are used to set policy prices 
for the niche groups that will likely enable the insur-
ance company to realize profits from the combined 
groups of customers.
United Parcel Service
United Parcel Service (UPS) realized decades ago 
that to manage its parcel delivery business in an effi-
cient and effective way and maintain profitability will 
require an ongoing analysis of performance data 
and the application of analytics to help identify new 
business opportunities. UPS also applies its analyt-
ics systems to maximize the use of its parcel moving 
capacity as well as to understand what influences how 
customers will respond to services and the likelihood 
of customers defecting to other carriers. UPS has 
established a Customer Intelligence Group which is 

Principles of Business: Management
Principles of Management
337
able to predict customer defections through review-
ing their service use patterns and complaints. This 
analysis is continuously generated and if a customer 
is flagged for potential defection a customer repre-
sentative contacts that customer and consults on 
problems and devise solutions to improve customer 
satisfaction. This approach can reduce the number 
of accounts the company may see defect.
The Leverage of Commonality
A traditional view of business intelligence is often 
limited to small narrowly focused analytical activi-
ties conducted by functional departments or busi-
ness units that are looking for guidance in tactical 
situations. However, the unbridled growth of user-
developed analytical tools generally leads to many 
variations of internal performance indicators that 
are so disparate that they cannot be integrated into 
a big picture view of organization performance. In 
addition, research has repeatedly shown that large 
percentages of use-developed analytical tools such as 
spreadsheets contain errors, some of which are very 
serious. So the more user-developed tools there are, 
the more errors in analysis and thus decisions made 
on faculty data.
The key to leveraging analytics is to have a com-
mon set of data and analytical resources that are 
used across the organization. This enables different 
departments and business units to easily share data. 
In many organizations this may represent a cultural 
change as departments are pushed to give up their 
solitude and independence of data and analytical 
control.
Issue
The Challenge of Developing People
Achieving competitive differentiation through inno-
vation, not Imitation, is difficult to accomplish with-
out a close relationship between people management 
and business strategies (Appleby & Mavin, 2000). 
Each employee has talents, strengths, and weak-
nesses. These talents and strengths need to be inte-
grated into a well designed skills set that best serves 
the organization. It is also necessary to continuously 
assess an individual’s weaknesses and, using training 
tools and mentoring, transform the employee into 
a stronger executive. The changes that occurred in 
the marketplace over the past 70 plus years are excep-
tional and represent significant shifts in the way 
executives run global hyper competitive enterprises 
(Heames & Harvey, 2006).
Most highly competitive organizations take 
into consideration numerous factors that impact 
their overall competitiveness. Competitiveness is 
clearly influenced by numerous factors, and human 
resources is one of the key building blocks for a com-
petitive organization. Employees all have unique 
abilities, attitudes, behaviors, and experiences and 
the human resource management process should be 
designed to improve skills and leverage those skills 
into a competitive advantage.
A traditional and effective approach of transfer-
ring knowledge and skills in an organization is the 
process and practice of mentoring. This technique 
is recognized as a valuable approach to staff develop-
ment as well as socializing new employees into the cor-
porate culture. A well structured mentoring program 
is a very structured way to communicate the expecta-
tions of management strategy, goals, and objectives. 
Although it is only one of many methods to facilitate 
learning for new employees, the mentoring process 
provides a guided learning experience that, if done 
properly, can expose employees to new skills and 
knowledge as well as reinforcing good management 
habits. Mentoring can contribute to develop a high 
performance work force and establishing and main-
taining a competitive advantage (Mathews, 2006).
CONCLUSION
The functions and activities of managers have 
remained relatively unchanged over time. Managers 
have always had to develop strategy, plan business 
activities, organize business functions, control pro-
cesses, and lead and develop people all in a manner 
that successfully drives businesses. However, what has 
changed overtime is how managers have viewed and 
executed these functions. In many industries, tech-
nological innovation is an important determinant of 
firm performance, and the level of innovative activity 
is therefore a significant choice for the firm. Global 
competition means greater access to markets on an 
international scale and can exert pressures on coun-
tries and corporate governance systems that rely on 
non-market coordination to a significant degree.
This shift from treating financial figures as the 
foundation for performance measurement to treat-
ing them as one among a broader set of measures is 

Principles of Management

rather widespread. The “ranks of companies enlisting 
in this revolution are rising daily. Senior managers 
at one large, high-tech manufacturer recently took 
direct responsibility for adding customer satisfaction, 
quality, market share, and human resources to their 
formal measurement system” (Eccles, 1991, p. 131). 
As quality-related metrics have enhanced the perfor-
mance measurement revolution, so has the develop-
ment of competitive benchmarking. Benchmarking 
gives managers a methodology that can be applied to 
any measure, financial or nonfinancial, yet empha-
sizes nonfinancial metrics. It also has a transform-
ing effect on managerial mind-sets and perspectives 
(Eccles, 1991).
History clearly shows that highly competitive 
organizations take into consideration numerous fac-
tors that impact their overall competitiveness, and 
human resources is one of the key building blocks 
for a competitive organization. Employees should be 
considered assets and managers should recognize 
that each employee has unique abilities, attitudes, 
behaviors, and experiences and the human resource 
management process should be designed to improve 
skills and leverage those skills into a competitive 
advantage.

Principles of Risk Management
ABSTRACT
This article focuses on the principles of risk man-
agement and the current day application of them. 
The first step is to identify risks; potential and real-
istic ones. The next step is to prevent or manage the 
risks. Three common risks are information technol-
ogy, weather and business ethics. Information tech-
nology risks relate specifically to online data theft 
issues, identity theft and computer viruses. Weather 
concerns involve all forms of precipitation that can 
affect businesses like, too much rain, too little rain

and not enough snow. This is very impactful to the 
agricultural, vacation/resort and restaurant business 
market. All businesses would be adversely impacted 
due to catastrophic weather that could destroy 
large geographical areas like Hurricane Katrina did 
(Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama). Company 
leadership entails business ethics and the problems 
that arise due to the lack of them in the workplace. 
The banking industry is an example of an industry 
that is greatly impacted by the risks mentioned in this 
article because of the great financial impact brought 
on by the use of technology and the unpredictability 
of weather. Due to these reasons, it is quite obvious of 
the need to assess risk in all business industries.
OVERVIEW
Principles of risk management are needed even more 
today than ever before. In the past, many organiza-
tions either ignored the risks altogether or simply 
lived through the unfortunate consequences caused 
by them. In many cases, these organizations didn’t 
have anyone dedicated to look at or out for potential 
risks that could adversely impact the company. It was, 
for lack of a better word, an afterthought. This apa-
thetic way of conducting business, in turn, has caused 
many companies to go bankrupt and some to perma-
nently close their business doors. Therefore, a closer 
look at the topic of risk management is essential.
Two Types of Risk
The process of identifying risk entails examining the 
likelihood of two types of risk: Potential risk and real-
istic risk. Regardless of the industry impacted, such 
an assessment is needed to not only identify risks, but 
to address them.
 Potential Risks — these types of risks may or may 
not occur, but a plan must be put in place to stop 
or reduce the impact. Examples are: Stock market 
crashes, unusually high-levels of precipitation in a 
typically dry area, employees leaving the department 
or company and poor executive level decisions. 
These risks can come from internal and external 
forces as shown by the above mentioned examples.

 Realistic Risks — these risks are based on known 
threats. Typically these threats are common for 
a specific industry or all industries. Examples 
are: loss of profits, legislative decisions, overseas 
regulations, information theft and computer vi-
ruses. Many times these risks come from external 
forces and can, as a result, cause quite a challenge 
to manage.
Prevention & Management of Risk
Now that the risk has been identified, steps must be 
taken to prevent or manage the risk. There are four 
main categories to consider. They are elimination, 
limitation, acceptance and transfer.

 Elimination — This technique involves avoiding any 
and all activity that could create a risk. Therefore, a 
company may choose not to sell products and ser-
vices in a certain geographical location due to his-
torically inclimate weather. Another example would 
be a company choosing not to use the Internet as 
a means of selling their products and services due 
to concerns of information theft. The decision to 
eliminate an activity is one that comes with a great 
deal of consideration. Loss of profits and market 
capitalization could result from such a decision.

 Limitation — This method entails the reduction 
of an actual exposure to a risk. A company or en-
tity decides to limit the likelihood of suffering 
severe losses by taking precautionary steps to re-
duce risks. One example would be a company that 
chooses to sell a limited amount of products on-
line to limit its exposure. Those products would 
most likely be high selling items and ones most 
commonly sold online. Another example is re-
mote office locations put in place to reduce the 
impact of catastrophic losses of offices in areas 
where the weather could become volatile. Office 
daycares instituted to offset employee absenteeism 
due to childcare issues could impact work produc-
tivity and could prove helpful. Also, work safety 
programs implemented to educate employees on 
how to properly operate equipment to reduce em-
ployee injuries and/or deaths would be beneficial.

 Acceptance — This method involves accepting 
certain losses incurred. In particular, risks that 
can’t be insured against and are not worth it in the 
long run because the expense to insure it will not 
cover the overall exposure. Common examples 
are damages caused by War. In most cases, these 
damages are not covered by insurance and as a 
result must be accepted as a loss by businesses. 
Another example is a national catastrophe like a

341
tsunami. Events like these could potentially bring 
about a total loss.

 Transfer — This is the process of transferring a 
risk to another party. One common way of doing 
this is by obtaining insurance coverage. When 
contractors are utilized, a contract is established 
to assign the contractor the appropriate risk re-
sponsibility. Consultants are also utilized by some 
organizations to better manage risk due to the 
expertise they bring for their respective industry. 
Attorneys help companies to stay compliant and in 
proper legal standing. Over the past decade, many 
industries have incorporated the use of derivatives 
to hedge potential losses, protect themselves and 
manage the risk.
Common Risks Companies Face
Some areas that commonly create risk are:

 The weather is a risk in itself due to the poten-
tial damage it can cause. The main problem that 
comes from this risk is a company’s inability to do 
anything about the potential damage. Even if they 
see something coming, time may not be on their 
side to properly address it.
 Legislation can be introduced at any time, which 
could adversely impact a business’ practices, produc-
tivity and profitability. What was once a normal prac-
tice or way of doing business may have to be com-
pletely revamped, which could be extremely costly.

 The economy is always a tumultuous factor for 
businesses. If consumers are unemployed or are 
dealing with other financial constraints, this will 
greatly impact their buying power. It can also 
make the market share even more competitive for 
businesses. 

 People resources are always unpredictable and 
that in itself is a huge risk for companies. Hiring, 
training and retaining quality employees is a chal-
lenge for companies and causes the biggest ex-
pense. An employee’s lack of productivity or un-
expectant departure can greatly impact project 
work and plans for implementing new products 
and services.

 Technology is both exciting and risky. The use 
of new technology can be very expensive and if 
it doesn’t work properly it can take an organiza-
tion down. This could cause loss of profitability 
and consumer retention. Yet, if an organization 
doesn’t keep up with new technology it could be 
left behind and become uncompetitive.
APPLICATIONS
There are several types of risks an organization faces 
today. This article will discuss a few of them. These 
risks involve information technology, weather and 
business ethics.
Information Technology
Technological advances have improved and made life 
more enriching for everyone who has taken advan-
tage of them. In particular, the information highway, 
also known as the Internet, has been a huge contribu-
tor to such improvements. The conveniences that a 
click and a few keystrokes make are priceless to many 
consumers each day. The Internet is used to conduct 
research, make purchases, communicate with friends 
and family across the world, find directions, store 
data and countless other processes.
Information Theft
Along with access to endless quantities of information 
comes the risk of such information falling into the 
wrong hands. This information includes addresses, 
phone numbers, bank accounts, credit card account 
numbers and business data. Computer hackers have 
repeatedly been able to infiltrate confidential data 
from consumers and businesses. As a result, there 
have been frequent reports of computer viruses that 
have crippled companies and in some cases put them 
out of business. Business transactions conducted on 
the Internet can be quite profitable and convenient, 
but at times also very dangerous. That’s why infor-
mation theft has come to the forefront of what con-
cerns corporate executives and consumers as a whole 
today. It can take months, if not years to clear up this 
type of information theft problem. Credit reporting 
information may take even longer to restore.
Cyber-risk Insurance Policies
Though there are issues, businesses have found a sav-
ing grace because now they have an option to purchase 
cyber-risk insurance policies. These policies pro-
vide coverage for companies that have experienced 
breaches in information security on the Internet. This 
type of insurance provides some relief for businesses, 
which they haven’t had before. Some things cyber-risk 

Principles of Risk Management

insurance protects against are theft of trade secrets, 
destruction of hardware, software, data and extortion 
of hackers. Some third-party risks that are covered are 
computer viruses inadvertently forwarded internally, 
failure to provide products because a hacker or virus 
stopped the insured’s delivery system, unauthorized 
contents placed on the company Website and the 
theft of credit card records. A business seeking this 
type of insurance coverage can obtain multi-million 
dollar coverage, which offers a great deal of relief to 
an ongoing problem (Gordon, Loeb & Sohail, 2003).
Weather
It is estimated that four-fifths of all economic activity 
worldwide is directly or indirectly affected by weather. 
Also, the US Department of Commerce says that at 
least $1 trn of the US economy is weather-dependent. 
With this type of monumental impact, it is no wonder 
why businesses should factor in this topic when dis-
cussing risk management. Virtually every industry is 
impacted by the weather. If a major storm (hurricane, 
tornado or thunderstorm) were to occur the destruc-
tion of crops would adversely impact food service, res-
taurant and grocery store industries, to name a few. 
This could bankrupt a business, especially the smaller 
mom and pop businesses. Severe damage could 
occur if a major earthquake occurred in California 
destroying homes, roadways, and businesses. Cities in 
this state could be virtually shutdown. It is very appar-
ent, directly or indirectly, that most industries have 
the potential to be impacted and must do something 
to protect themselves (Triana, 2006).
Weather Derivatives
Due to the impending dangers that weather related 
risks could cause, many companies have adopted 
the use of weather derivatives. These financial 
instruments can be customized to determine the 
amount of risk a company may be exposed to when 
it comes to weather. Electricity and power firms were 
the pioneers of using these derivatives to hedge 
their risks and they are still the leaders of using 
these tools. With this type of protection, a business 
dependent on snow (like a ski resort) would be pro-
tected if there were a very limited supply during the 
ski season. This would also be the case for various 
food service industries if crops did not get enough 
rain. Companies utilizing these tools would receive 
compensation due to covered losses. The two most 
commonly used weather derivatives are temperature 
risks and rain hedges. The examples stated above 
would use these two types of weather derivatives 
(Fischer-Rief & Ward, 2003).
Business Ethics
The onslaught of lawsuits against company lead-
ers has been alarming. Something that used to be 
unheard of has become fairly common. Companies 
like WorldCom, Enron and Arthur Andersen gained 
popularity in recent years not due to profitability, but 
because of falsified accounting reports. One by one, 
companies were the topic of discussion by the media 
for this very reason. In particular, what came to light 
and became the focus were company leaders and 
their unethical and illegal practices. They abused 
their authority and stockholders and employees paid 
the price. This issue has fueled the discussion on eth-
ics and the risks involved when they are not in opera-
tion. It has been proven with the above companies that 
extremely harmful and sometimes irreparable dam-
ages may result.
Developing a Code of Ethics
It is critical for a company to develop and enforce a 
code of ethics. The following should be done as a way 
to create such a code of ethics:

 Educational materials should be created to pro-
vide structured ethical training in all levels in the 
business

 Documentation and evaluation of risk manage-
ment using an ethical performance framework

 Inclusion of ethical codes of practice in organiza-
tional handbooks

 Inclusion of self-assessment on ethics in appraisals

 Appointment of ethics officers.
These efforts would show from the top down that 
good ethical behavior is required and taken seri-
ously. The next course of action would be to address 
improper behavior immediately. This may mean 
additional training, job demotion or termination for 
the employee. If immediate action isn’t taken, other 
employees will not take the ethics code seriously. It 
is because of disparities in the above practices that 
company leaders had the impression they could do 
anything without repercussions. Such an attitude cre-
ates great risk (Robertson, 2005).

Principles of Business: Management

Since company leaders have been under fire 
in the scandals mentioned above, it would benefit 
businesses to consider getting directors and officers 
(D&O) liability insurance. This insurance and varia-
tions of it provide protection for the directors and 
officers’ individual assets, defense costs and pay-
outs. Relief and closure are two main benefits that 
would derive from this coverage. With the influx of 
record-breaking settlements, this insurance is criti-
cal. It could be the difference of staying in or going 
out of business. Although it provides definite bene-
fits, company leaders should not allow this insurance 
coverage to cloud their view of doing what is ethi-
cally right. The best defense of risk management is 
to not put the company leader and company at risk 
(Ferrillo, 2005).
Issues
Information Technology
As stated above, Internet use poses a serious risk to 
companies. Since the availability of the Internet is 
so vast, it can be very difficult to catch culprits in 
wrongful acts. The Internet can be used at home, 
on the job (usually), in the public library, at school 
and at a friend’s house. Therefore, it would be dif-
ficult to determine who performed the illegal activ-
ity. Add to the mix the variety of wireless technology 
available today, and it is clear why the issue is so com-
plex. Some individuals have multiple aliases and are 
quite capable of getting around firewalls to cause 
damage to individuals’ and companies’ data. The 
more safeguards that are created and put in place 
to protect potential victims, the more innovative 
criminals become to counter them. This will con-
tinue to be a problem for years to come since the 
Internet is so heavily used today. Some businesses 
are strictly run on the Internet and some businesses 
have achieved greater profit levels because of the 
availability of the Internet. The need for this tool 
would make one think that the world has never 
been without it.
Weather
As discussed above, weather derivatives have bene-
fited businesses. They have allowed those businesses 
to continue to function and operate inspite of 
losses due to weather. Without these tools, it would 
be virtually impossible for some businesses to suc-
ceed. However, the unpredictability of the weather 
will challenge the validity of the weather derivative 
results. The weather derivatives cannot supersede 
Mother Nature’s will. Meteorologists have access to 
some of the most up to date technology to make 
weather predictions for the world. Making predic-
tions a week or two in advance has become the stan-
dard. Meteorologists also report on weather trends 
and provide historical data regarding record-break-
ing temperatures and symbolic weather events of 
the past. With all of this information at their fin-
gertips, it would appear that they have everything 
they need to get it right, but this is not the case. 
Unfortunately, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, 
snow and ice storms suddenly appear, change direc-
tions and escalate without warning or notice. It’s 
a part of life that no one can truly prepare for no 
matter how much information is available. Due to 
this reason, the weather will always be a factor for 
both the consumers and the businesses alike.
Business Ethics
Companies and company leaders have options to off-
set the risk associated with their business. Developing 
and implementing a code of ethics program is great, 
but if the board of directors and senior leadership 
don’t buy-in from the beginning, the code of eth-
ics will not work as intended. Accountability is key 
regardless of a person’s position in the company. 
D&O liability insurance is a great asset to company 
leaders and companies, but since there have been 
so many companies charged with securities lawsuits 
the courts have been awarding hundreds of millions 
of dollars to the financial detriment of businesses. 
Can insurance companies afford to pay untradition-
ally high payouts? How much premium will need to 
be paid to ensure proper coverage? Can businesses 
afford it? Tough questions for tough times as compa-
nies consider their risks.
VIEWPOINTS
Banking Industry
The banking industry as a whole has been greatly 
impacted by various risks. Some of those risks come 
from the economy, environment and technology. 
Arguably, this industry is one of the riskiest ones to 
be in due to the great potential for turbulent results. 
Taking a deeper look at two of the risks mentioned 
in this article will explain why this is the case.

Principles of Risk Management
Principles of Business: Management

Information Technology & the Banking Industry
Online banking is very popular today. People enjoy 
the convenience of taking care of their financial 
affairs online. Benefits include the elimination of 
postage costs, reduced gas consumption and time 
savings. Other benefits include online bank state-
ments that can be reviewed or printed at any time 
as well as an online bank ledger that takes away the 
need for keeping paper records. These banks also 
allow the account holder to review scanned images of 
handwritten checks to verify account transactions. All 
of these perks seem like a win win situation for con-
sumers until such convenience is violated by informa-
tion theft. Personal financial exposure is an obvious 
impact, but the potential loss of business due to this 
problem could prove even more damaging. This risk 
comes from taking advantage of growth opportuni-
ties through the Internet which could prove to be 
very profitable or expensive. The banking industry 
or individual banks considering the growth opportu-
nities provided by the Internet must determine if the 
benefits outweigh the risks.
Weather & the Banking Industry
The banking industry can be severely effected by 
natural disasters. Hurricane Katrina is a prime 
example. Banks financed many of the homes that 
were destroyed due to the hurricane. As a result, 
those banks had to deal with loan defaults from 
those impacted states (Louisiana, Mississippi and 
Alabama) as many home sites were abandoned and 
the owners relocated. The average homes in those 
states were valued between $85,000 and $125,000. 
Had a disaster on the same scale happened in a 
more expensive area of the nation, such as California 
where the median home value was $500,000, losses 
could have been devastating for the banking indus-
try (Esola, 2007).
Unlike the insurance industry, banks haven’t had 
a plan in place to address these risks in the past. As 
stated above, some businesses don’t have a plan and 
don’t appear to be developing one any time soon to 
deal with or alleviate risks. Banks should consider 
following the lead of insurance companies. The 
insurance industry has exclusions and limitations to 
protect themselves. Instead, banks have made inaccu-
rate assumptions by relying on emergency state and 
federal programs that have limits on how much they 
will pay. There will be even greater limitations when 
catastrophic damages occur like Hurricane Katrina 
due to the large number of payouts. The business 
industries can’t take this lightly. The potential impact 
is too great too bear alone. The banking industry 
must begin to follow the principles of risk manage-
ment to reduce their exposure (Esola, 2007).
CONCLUSION
The process of evaluating the principles of risk man-
agement is essential to a company’s success. As shown 
throughout the article, success in risk management 
could be the difference of simply going through the 
motions and being proactive. The need is there and 
due to the risks that companies are facing today, risk 
management must be taken seriously. There are a vari-
ety of risks that affect the various business industries. 
Three main risks are information technology, weather 
and company leaders. Each poses its own serious threat. 
Fortunately, there are methods to overcome or counter 
them. The first step is to identify risks, both the known 
and the potential. Once this has been done, prevention 
or management should be implemented. The key to 
effective risk management is doing something about it. 
It’s very important to seek solutions and adjust accord-
ingly. It is equally important to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of those solutions and make changes when 
needed. The solutions available today are vast. As more 
data is collected, trended and evaluated, the continued 
effort of developing innovative risk management solu-
tions will create the most effective means of diminish-
ing risk and eliminating it altogether when feasible. 
Ultimately, this is the goal for every organization.

Process Management for Quality
ABSTRACT
Successfully producing products and delivering ser-
vices requires adherence to some standard or level of 
quality. Quality is an attribute that can be measured 
and is equivalent to meeting or exceeding customer 
expectations. It can be built into the act of managing 
processes to design, produce, deliver, maintain and 
service products of all kinds. However, process com-
plexity may impact the ability to continuously rede-
sign processes for efficiency and quality. Quality tools 
are useful in determining current quality status and 
quality philosophies are valuable in order to approach 
business process management from a holistic view. A 
concern for quality determines how processes will be 
managed and controlled. Interaction with customers 
to collect feedback is essential in monitoring quality. 
Technology can help master the modification of pro-
cesses and reduce complexity. But, technology is only 
one factor that affects process management success. 
People who use the processes must be included in the 
management and modification activity and can bene-
fit from quality training. Senior management must set 
the tone for organizational emphasis on quality and 
the integration of quality into managing processes.
OVERVIEW
Businesses of all types have processes that run opera-
tions, produce products and services and that com-
municate with customers. Processes can range from 
simple to complex. The more efficient the processes 
the more value a company can create and the faster 
a product can go to market. Efficient processes are 
clear and communication flows easily about them. 
An effective system of managing processes allows 
these processes to be modified and to easily adapt to 
the constantly changing environment. Effective pro-
cess management can provide a benefit in the mar-
ketplace to a business because the business will be 
easily able to integrate information about the market 
into its operations (Cleaveland, 2006; Sly, 2004).
Businesses can attract customers by exceptional 
positioning of products, attractive advertising, and 
skillful promotion and pricing. However, the oppor-
tunity for a product to experience longevity depends 
on the true quality of the product and the ability of 
the company to keep quality high or improve qual-
ity over time. Introducing high levels of quality and 
maintaining those levels can be costly and time con-
suming, especially if the quality levels required mean 
product redesign and process redesign.
The hidden cost of redesign in production is the 
retraining workers and productivity loss when things 
have been done a certain way for a period of time 
and then are changed. The manner in which com-
panies manage processes with quality in mind can 
help in meeting the challenges companies face today. 
Some of these challenges are demands from the mar-
ketplace for new products even faster and customers 
demanding new features and functionality (Huang 
& Stohr, 2007). In addition to market and customer 
demands, industry and government regulations 
require “proactive compliance” by companies and 
cause processes to become more complex. Proactive 
activities can help companies anticipate changes, 
become leaders in their market space and avoid the 
cost of reactionary activity. According to Huang & 

Principles of Business: Management
Process Management for Quality
347
Stohr, once processes become complex, it becomes 
more difficult to manage them because the reasons 
processes are designed a certain way or even exist is 
lost. In addition, every layer of complexity requires 
new business rules that influence or even constrain 
the processes (Huang & Stohr, 2007). For example, a 
new government regulation may require tracking of 
information about the age of an applicant for insur-
ance. To meet this requirement, a process may have 
to add a new business rule that says if age equals some 
value then move to another action.
Complexity also influences how companies can 
allocate resources. If a task of monitoring or manag-
ing a process is very complex, the level of knowledge 
of the worker assigned the task must be high; a factor 
that limits who can work on what task. In addition, 
there is natural turnover in companies and docu-
mentation of business processes and rules is needed 
since new workers may not understand the required 
flow of a particular process.
Business Process Management & Total Quality 
Management
Yu-Yuan Hung (2006) likened Business Process 
Management (BPM) to Total Quality Management 
(TQM). Both require a broad strategic view as well 
as a connection between internal processes and the 
external environment. An article about process man-
agement programs called TQM a “strategy” where 
the whole organization is consumed with continuous 
improvement. This strategy was an outgrowth of U.S. 
manufacturers trying to thwart Japanese competition 
by mimicking the Japanese emphasis on quality. Keck 
(2006) noted that the Total Quality Movement of late 
1970s and 1980s inspired quality tools.
Tools for Total Quality Management
According to Keck, quality is meeting or exceeding 
customer expectations. The quality tools developed 
during the quality movement were used to help com-
panies understand processes, what variability existed 
in these processes, and to help in measuring defects 
and deciding what to do about these situations. The 
initial quality tools were more concerned with the 
operational status of processes and the ability to iden-
tify and correct process issues. When quality tools are 
applied to business process management, there is an 
operational and strategic element to process design. 
Keck (2006) identified Six Sigma, a management 
philosophy that measures defects and improves 
quality as a key quality tool. Since the invention of 
Six Sigma in 1986 by Motorola, it has become much 
more comprehensive as a business improvement 
tool. Keck (2006) noted that Six Sigma involves:

 Understanding 
and 
managing 
customer 
requirements.

 Aligning key business processes to achieve those 
requirements.

 Utilizing rigorous data analysis to minimize varia-
tion in those processes.

 Driving rapid and sustainable improvement to 
business processes.
Six Sigma
Applying Six Sigma to business process management 
starts with a comprehensive evaluation of current 
processes in order to identify what is not adding value 
or causing errors, etc. (Keck, 2006). Technology is 
also effective in the analysis required by Six Sigma. 
Hydrocarbon Processing compared and contrasted 
Six Sigma to TQM by noting the use of statistical 
methods and problem solving techniques for process 
improvement. However, TQM has a company wide 
focus with involvement by all employees while Six 
Sigma is the domain of experts called black belts.
ISO 9000
Another popular quality program called ISO 9000 
requires documented standard processes for every-
thing a company does. The ISO 9000 approach 
requires organizations to ask questions about what is 
done, how accurate it is and why it is done. Activity 
like ISO 9000 preparation may result in process rede-
sign as formerly unknown details are captured and 
scrutinized. With ISO 9000, everything you do must 
be documented. If you are doing something and it 
is not documented, this omission is picked up. ISO 
9000 certification also has the cache` of having docu-
mented processes certified by a third party.
Importance of Consistency
Even measuring the quality of current processes is not 
enough to completely introduce quality into business 
process management. Consistency of delivery (Keck, 
2006) is a critical factor to measure quality in busi-
ness processes. Keck suggested the outsourcing of cer-
tain functions to ensure quality in business processes, 

Process Management for Quality
Principles of Business: Management
348
especially those that aren’t part of the organization’s 
core skills. Quality product and service delivery is depen-
dent on the following key principles (Keck, 2006):

 Management commitment.

 Understanding expertise in process management.

 Unwavering discipline in the organization to apply 
quality principles.

 Use of quality tools and methodology.

 Creating a quality culture.
Role of Top Management
Top management is the key to achieving these 
principles in a real world environment. Top man-
agement must understand the concepts of quality 
and business process management, value expertise 
in these areas of their organization, recognize the 
value of tools (technology and quality) and must 
value and support people. There appears to be 
limitations on the widespread use of process man-
agement improvement techniques (“Can process 
management,” 2006). After some period of time, 
the gains in efficiency, cost and competitive advan-
tage appear to dwindle. Strategic managers may 
need to take another view and look for new methods 
of achieving competitive advantage instead of using 
the same one over and over again.
What is Quality & is it Important?
Quality is an important concept in business and 
there are many measures of quality in various indus-
tries. Quality is dependent upon what the customer 
believes constitutes quality. Landryovà & Irgens 
(2006) defined product quality as “a product’s fitness 
for purpose.” Keck (2006) saw a direct relationship 
between quality and customer satisfaction and noted 
that even cheap prices do not cover up for poor qual-
ity. This is traditionally referred to in quality termi-
nology as the total cost of quality.
The Cost of Quality
The total cost of quality is made up of two types of 
costs. The first is the cost of conformance (COC) and 
the second is the cost of nonconformance (CONC) 
(Keck, 2006). The cost of conformance is the price 
a company pays to adhere to quality standards. The 
cost of nonconformance is the price a company pays 
when a product is found to be not fit while in the 
hands of the customer. Nonconformance is costly 
because for any product or service, the farther into 
the process, the costlier the product or service. If 
a quality error is caught early and prevented from 
reaching the customer, the company saves money in 
processing and packaging a product and the multiple 
labor cycles in the case of a service.
Taguchi Principles of Quality
Landryovà & Irgens (2006) outlined four quality 
concepts devised by Taguchi called the Taguchi prin-
ciples of quality and are often referred to as the most 
effective quality principles in the world. These prin-
ciples are:

 Quality should be designed into products not in-
spected in.

 Quality is realized by minimizing deviations from 
specification and reducing uncontrolled factors as 
a cause for deviation.

 Quality measurements are not a result of the fea-
tures or functional performance of a product.

 The cost of quality is measured by deviations in 
performance and life-cycle costs.
Reasons for Process & Quality Management
Like other quality guidelines, Taguchi’s principles 
emphasize preventing loss where it occurs and not 
allowing deviation, variation and lack of control 
of tolerance to continue through the production 
process.
So why should companies manage processes and 
why should they manage them for quality? Hammer 
(2007) noted that focus on processes yields benefits 
and improvements in cost, quality, speed and profit-
ability among other key areas where businesses need 
positive activity. Keck (2006) quoted quality guru Philip 
Crosby’s view that investing in quality is less costly than 
the ramifications of poor quality. Companies need a 
balance between short term process management and 
investment in new opportunities for the future (“Can 
process management,” 2006). Balance is difficult 
because of the tendency to focus on one process or the 
other and it is difficult to know when to make appro-
priate shifts. It is very difficult for an organization to 
keep the entire organization’s focus on anything for a 
long period of time and once it is set in one direction, 
it is difficult to change it.
Quality is important because it emphasizes what 
the customer wants. If customer wants are not

addressed, opportunities for competitors open up 
and the value of products and services is reduced. 
However, an organization’s approach to addressing 
quality issues and integrating quality into business 
process management may not succeed in meeting 
customer expectations.
Sustainable Competitive Advantage
Yu-Yuan Hung (2006) describes business process 
management as a principle that helps companies 
“sustain competitive advantage.” A sustainable com-
petitive advantage is one that occurs when a company 
finds ways to continuously adapt to new demands. 
The key to this competitiveness is to make business 
processes strategic in importance and recognize the 
role that people play in business process manage-
ment (Yu-Yuan Hung, 2006).
Dangers of Business Process Management & Quality 
Management Technology
There are dangers when engaging in business pro-
cess management and using quality tools to man-
age the process. Professors from Wharton School 
of Business and Harvard have performed research 
which suggests that adhering to process manage-
ment causes organizations to become stagnant 
and “dampens innovation” (“Can process man-
agement,” 2006). The reasons for these problems 
are that an organization’s focus is exclusively on 
efficiency at the expense of creative thinking. 
In addition, the method and pattern of process 
improvement can become entrenched and stale 
meaning that the previous ways gains were made 
no longer work. Companies can even apply the 
techniques they’ve learned and used to the wrong 
situation. This is especially true when discovering 
new products and when designs are impacted by 
new technology. Anything brand new can skew the 
equation in ways organizations may not be able to 
imagine.
Viewpoint
How Processes are Managed for Quality
Although it seems obvious that quality is important 
and managing processes is essential, transforming 
business processes with an eye on quality is not easy 
to do. Hammer (2007) found that executives respon-
sible for these areas failed regardless of time, man-
power and money spent. The reason is due to the 
difficulty in determining what should be changed, 
when and by how much. Process transformation is 
not an exact science.
Process & Enterprise Maturity Model
Hammer worked for five years on a model of how 
executives could measure progress on transform-
ing processes. This model, called the Process and 
Enterprise Maturity Model (PEMM) has been used 
successfully in process management at companies 
including Michelin, CSAA, Tetra Pak, Shell, Clorox, 
and Schneider National (Hammer, 2007). PEMM 
identifies two groups of characteristics that help pro-
cesses perform well over the long term. The first group 
of characteristics is called process enablers which 
affect how well individual processes function. Process 
enablers depend on each other and if any don’t func-
tion well or are missing, it can affect the ability of the 
others to function well. The second group of char-
acteristics is organizational capabilities that support 
high performance processes. Even if process enablers 
are in place, an organization can work against itself 
for effective process management, monitoring and 
improvement.
Process Enablers
Hammer (2007) identified five process enablers and 
four enterprise enablers. Process enablers are:

 Design — how comprehensive the process in 
making a product.

 Performers — who executes the processes as well 
as their skills and knowledge.

 Owner — the senior leader responsible for the 
process and results.

 Infrastructure — information and systems to sup-
port the process.

 Metrics — the measures a company uses to track 
the process’s performance.
The companies that can identify these enablers 
are more likely to put actions in place to support 
the process management activities going on within a 
firm. However, management cannot be the only ones 
who possess the knowledge and ability to categorize 
the attributes that enable processes. The operational 
employees must understand the connection between 
these enablers and their daily work to be effective 
contributors to process management.

Enterprise Capabilities
The Enterprise Capabilities are:

 Leadership — senior executives who support pro-
cess creation.

 Culture — organizational values: Customer focus, 
teamwork, personal accountability, and willing-
ness to change.

 Expertise — process redesign capabilities.

 Governance — how complex projects and change 
initiatives are managed.
These enterprise capabilities are less tangible 
and harder to influence than the process enablers. 
Strategic leaders have to develop multiple ways to 
communicate these capabilities and to obtain infor-
mation and feedback on them. Hammer (2007) 
tested these enablers and capabilities with several 
leading companies and found the PEMM model 
a successful way to guide, plan and evaluate pro-
cess transformation. The biggest problem Hammer 
(2007) saw with the enablers and capabilities was that 
the intensity with which each was active in an orga-
nization varied and affected the outcomes. So, if a 
company was strong in the capability of leadership 
but weak in governance, problems would occur.
Importance of Process Design
Hammer (2007) felt that the way a process is designed 
impacts the performance of the process. The design 
of processes includes who is performing what task, 
when the task is done, where and how. Hammer rec-
ommended using quality tools to make sure processes 
are being executed the way they should, but pro-
moted process redesign as the real way to transform 
processes and improve their performance. One com-
pany Hammer (2007) tested with the PEMM model 
was Schneider National, a large trucking company. 
Schneider’s interest in process improvement was due 
to a decline in growth. Schneider identified the five 
core business processes important to the company. 
One process captured all activity related to sales from 
the identification of a lead to the ultimate purchase 
of a product. Schneider identified a key performance 
indicator that could reverse the decline in growth. 
This indicator was the time needed to respond to a 
request for a proposal from a customer. The redesign 
process reduced the time for a bid or response to the 
customer’s proposal by 90% and increased the bid 
opportunities that resulted in sales by 70%. This is sig-
nificant and could influence companies like Schneider 
to go further in business process transformation.
Tarí (2006) observed public sector integration of 
quality in operations and documented process man-
agement and business process reengineering used 
to improve public sector service quality in police 
services. Tarí pointed to TQM as being especially 
applicable to the public sector because it emphasizes 
the human component and service delivery is con-
cerned with managing and deploying the appropri-
ate human resources as needed. TQM has been used 
by police departments in Europe to improve police 
services. TQM emphasizes openness towards the 
community in service delivery.
Importance of Employee Support/Education
The literature has shown many examples of com-
panies using quality tools to improve processes but 
doesn’t show efforts by companies to help people 
adapt to the improved processes (Tarí, 2006). 
Hammer (2007) agreed noting that management is 
typically ready to pay for teaching people a new pro-
cess but not ready to pay for helping people under-
stand how the new process works or fits into the 
larger organizational processes. Another key mistake 
is changing processes without changing the associ-
ated management responsibility that is also likely to 
change. Other methods of improving police services 
for quality include process mapping and using the 
balanced scorecard. Niven (2003) described the bal-
anced scorecard as a measurement system that comes 
from the organization’s strategy and can also be used 
as a communication tool. The goal is to create bal-
ance between financial indicators of success, internal 
and external stakeholders, and performance indica-
tors. Process mapping gives a clear, universal view of 
existing processes and how they relate to each other. 
Tarí’s (2006) research ultimately showed that process 
management helps the service quality improvement 
process but is dependent upon the right kind of 
input from people. Improving the service quality of 
policing depended heavily on a positive relationship 
with citizens. In some cases, this means establishing a 
relationship in the first place before it is possible to 
move to a positive one.
Hammer (2007) argued that process manage-
ment also means changing the way an organization 
looks at goals and rewards. These must also change 

Principles of Business: Management

with processes. People must be held accountable for 
a broader set of the objectives and held to a higher 
standard of understanding.
Tools to Manage Processes while Ensuring Quality
Part of the success of business process management 
(BPM) is becoming knowledgeable about BPM, BPM 
tools, strategies and processes. Yu-Yuan Hung (2006) 
defined twelve principles for successful business pro-
cess management. Some of these principles include:

 Looking at BPM in a holistic way rather than 
piecemeal.

 Making BPM strategic.

 Using information technology to manage BPM.

 Recognizing that BPM has corporate-wide impact 
on every part of the organization.

 Cross functional managing of processes needed 
instead of specialization in managing processes.

 Aligning processes.

 Aligning structure.

 Executive commitment.

 Involving people.
The difficulty with building these success princi-
ples is that someone at the strategic level must under-
stand the breadth and depth of them and must be 
willing to train and allocate the appropriate financial 
and people resources. Many companies are unwill-
ing to take on a task this complex and end up only 
scratching the surface in BPM. Others may try to do 
too much too quickly.
Application of Technology to Business Process 
Management
Ross (1995) defined business process management 
(BPM) as “an integrated management philosophy 
and set of practices that includes incremental change 
and radical change in business process, and empha-
sizes continuous improvement, customer satisfaction, 
and employee involvement.” Part of quality manage-
ment is the selection of technology tools to man-
age the business process management activity. The 
demand for this technology is strong and expected to 
grow two and one half times in the next 5 — 7 years.
Oil Refineries & Business Process Management
Landryovà, & Irgens emphasized the support of prod-
uct quality by the new generation of knowledge about 
processes (2006). The authors discussed how rule 
based expert systems combined with SCADA systems 
(supervisory control and data acquisition) were used in 
the oil refinery industry to generate information about 
processes and equipment and then used in process 
management activities. The reason process knowledge 
generation and data collection is important and diffi-
cult in the oil refinery industry is that the process indus-
try, unlike discrete manufacturing, does not have clear 
and distinct processes or an easily identifiable design 
phase. Variations in manufacturing are costly and must 
be controlled. The ability to develop knowledge about 
manufacturing and variability assists in predicting and 
controlling quality issues. In this case, the tools that 
help manage processes are collaborative tools that work 
in concert to provide usable information on demand.
The Health Care Industry & Business Process 
Management Technology
Another application of technology to business pro-
cess management is that of clinical decision intelli-
gence (CDI). It has a goal of improving healthcare 
quality and reducing costs by discovering, managing 
and applying the multitude of data increasingly avail-
able from many sources (Wang, Nayda, & Dettinger, 
2007). These sources can include the latest research, 
clinical observations, laboratory tests and so on. CDI 
changes healthcare processes by integrating impor-
tant process components including:

 Business intelligence

 Business rule management and

 Business process management.
CONCLUSION
The concern with quality in healthcare was highlighted 
by several trade and non-profit organizations in the 
1990s whose findings showed unnecessary medical 
errors that even ended in death. Errors, inconsistent 
and poor quality coupled with high costs indicated 
a need to take dramatic action. One of the ways to 
address the healthcare crisis was an attempt to utilize 
technology more effectively. CDI systems are unique 
because they combine knowledge discovery and acqui-
sition, knowledge management, and decision support. 
No technology before CDI had this capability (Wang, 
Nayda, & Dettinger, 2007). These three subprocesses 
are challenging to integrate because the people who 
do them vary in skill, expertise, and what they are

trying to achieve, but the ability to connect these pro-
cesses can yield better care for the patient. The patient 
gets better care because instead of the traditional 
approach of dependence on the knowledge a physi-
cian has or has among colleagues, the latest research 
and techniques are also available. The ability to share 
the information with other clinicians and providers is 
also seamless. CDI systems also improve the quality of 
provider knowledge and allows for faster integration 
of new knowledge, improving overall healthcare pro-
vider skill. Hammer noted that improving processes 
is a dramatic way to improve performance because of 
the elimination of anything that is the source of cost or 
errors. In the case of healthcare quality, cost and errors 
can lead to serious consequences and even death. 
Every industry has reasons to improve processes and 
inject quality in the process transformation.
Freeing an organization from unnecessary steps 
can also lead to creativity and innovation which can 
lead to what the customer actually wants — new and 
better products and high quality service.

Productivity
ABSTRACT
This article focuses on productivity. The relationship 
between inputs, outputs, and productivity levels is ana-
lyzed. This article provides an analysis of the main types 
of productivity measures, including average labor pro-
ductivity and total factor productivity, and a discussion 
of how productivity is managed and promoted in orga-
nizations. The relationship between productivity and 
growth is explored. The main productivity measures, 
including productivity growth indexes, productivity 
level indexes, and subjective productivity measures, 
are described and the issues associated with productiv-
ity measurement are discussed.
OVERVIEW
Productivity is a measurement of economic effi-
ciency that analyzes whether economic inputs are 
being turned into outputs in an effective manner. 
Output refers to products or services and input 
comprises materials, labor, capital, and energy. 
Economic analysts study productivity as a means of 
understanding the current economy. In addition, 
economic analysts engage in productivity projec-
tions as a means of predicting the future health and 
strength of the economy in aggregate and by sec-
tors. Productivity is the foundation of the economy. 
Productivity slows inflation and contributes to the 
financing of health, education, and social welfare 
programs (Schreyer, 2005). The future growth of 
productivity is linked to the evolution of technol-
ogy and business investment patterns. Productivity 
drives economic growth. For example, the U.S. 
experienced technology-driven productivity growth 
in the 1990s (Jorgenson, 2006).
Organizational performance is linked to “effec-
tiveness, efficiency, quality, productivity, quality of 
work life, innovations, and profitability” (Kemppila & 
Lonnqvist, 2003, p.1). Productivity is linked to inputs 
and outputs while profitability is linked to inputs, out-
puts, and price. Organizations measure productivity 
as a means of assessing organizational strength and 
planning for increased productivity. Organizations

prefer to measure total productivity whenever pos-
sible. The total measure of productivity is the overall 
output divided by the totality of inputs. Challenges 
to effectively measuring total productivity arise 
when inputs and outputs overlap or evolve quickly 
(Kemppila & Lonnqvist, 2003). Industries with diffi-
cult productivity levels and outputs include banking, 
insurance, computer production, and communica-
tion services. These industries are characterized by 
quickly evolving technologies (Schreyer, 2005).
The following sections provide an overview of the 
main types of productivity measures, including aver-
age labor productivity and total factor productivity, 
and a discussion of how productivity is managed and 
promoted in organizations. These sections serve as 
the foundation for later discussion of the relationship 
between productivity and growth. The main productiv-
ity measures, including productivity growth indexes, 
productivity level indexes, and subjective productivity 
measures, are described and the issues associated with 
productivity measurement are discussed.
Types of Productivity
There are numerous categories of productivity includ-
ing labor productivity, firm or organizational pro-
ductivity, and individual or employee productivity. 
Knowing that human capital is formed by investments 
to build individual or organizational skills that drive 
productivity growth (Hazan, Marston, & Rajah, 2013), 
economists tend to focus on measures and projections 
of labor productivity. Labor productivity refers to the 
ratio of output to inputs. Labor productivity reflects the 
efficiency with which labor is used in production rather 
than the effort per worker. Economists study the aver-
age labor productivity (ALP), which refers to the ratio 
of output to hours worked. The growth of average labor 
productivity has three sources: capital deepening, labor 
quality, and total factor productivity (TFP) growth.

 Capital deepening refers to the increase in capital 
services per hour worked.

 Labor quality refers to labor input per hour 
worked.

 Total factor productivity growth reflects the labor 
productivity growth not attributable to capital deep-
ening or labor quality gains (Jorgenson, 2006).
Economists focus on labor productivity rather than 
more complex measures of complexity in large part 
due to the relative ease of gathering and computing 
labor productivity data (Diewert & Nakamora, 2005). 
Labor productivity is an important economic indica-
tor because the health and demographics of a nation’s 
labor force affect the nation’s productivity and poten-
tial for economic growth. National economies rely 
on steady, and in most instances, growing labor sup-
ply and demand. Economic growth is often created 
by increased productivity from a larger labor supply. 
Individual and aggregate labor supply is determined by 
individual and aggregate appetite for leisure and con-
sumption as well as wage rates. The public sector can 
manipulate wage rates and institute labor policies, con-
trolling work related issues such as child labor and work 
visas, to raise or lower the labor supply. Labor supply 
policies are often developed to address the public prob-
lem of intractable poverty. Labor supply policies, such 
as welfare reform, job training, and the Earned Income 
Tax Credit (EITC), are developed to increase the labor 
supply, job skills, or wages of the poor (Bartik, 2001).
Productivity & Management
Productivity is one of the main factors influencing 
the success of organizations. Productivity influences 
economic growth and living standards. Increases in 
productivity levels and outputs strengthen profits 
and the economy in general. As a result of the impor-
tance of productivity levels to the public and private 
sectors, organizations actively manage their produc-
tivity. Productivity is managed in large part through 
ongoing quantitative productivity measurement. 
Organizational productivity is influenced by the fol-
lowing factors and variables: work habits, work climate, 
personnel feelings and attitudes, new skills, advance-
ment, initiative, and physical work environment.

 Work habit considerations include absenteeism, 
tardiness, and safety rule violations.

 Work climate includes the number of grievances, 
employee turnover, and job satisfaction.

 Personnel feelings or attitudes include attitude 
changes, favorable reactions, and perceived 
changes in performance.

 New skills include decisions made, conflicts 
avoided, listening skills, reading speed, frequency 
of use of new skills.

 Advancement includes increases in job effective-
ness, number or promotions and pay increases, 
and request for transfer.


 Initiative includes number of suggestion sub-
mitted implemented, and successful completion 
of projects.

 Physical work environment includes order and ti-
diness, ergonomics, walkways, noise, and lighting 
(Kemppila & Lonnqvist, 2003).
Productivity is managed and promoted in numer-
ous ways in different firms, sectors, and industries. 
For example, in the private employee benefit plans 
sector, benefit plan administrators and manag-
ers promote productivity by educating their per-
sonnel about the cost of employee benefits. The 
International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, 
which encourages employers to engage in employee 
benefit plan education, believes that employee 
appreciation of and knowledge about benefits con-
tributes to workplace productivity. To fully appreciate 
the employee benefits that they receive, employees 
must become familiar with their value. Similarly, an 
employer can provide the optimal level of pay mix 
and benefits to improve employee engagement 
(Davidson, 2013). Employers spend significant finan-
cial and human capital resources on benefit plan 
coverage and administration. For example, in 2003, 
private sector employee benefit costs averaged 42.3% 
of payroll. The employee benefit costs for small com-
panies averaged 31.9% of payroll. The employee ben-
efit costs averaged 44.9% for large companies. Few 
employees realize that, in 2003, employees received 
approximately $18,000 of employee benefits over and 
above their earned wages. Health care benefits gen-
erally make up approximately 35% of total employee 
benefit costs. Employers, in 2003, spent an average 
of $6,277 per employee on health care related ben-
efits. Ultimately, employees who understand the 
true costs and expenses associated with employer-
sponsored benefits plan may appreciate the financial 
commitment made by their employers and be more 
productive employees (Feldstein, 2005). In 2014, out 
of a total of 571 organizations both large and small 
from approximately twenty different industries sur-
veyed by the International Foundation of Employee 
Benefits, employee benefit costs averaged 32 percent 
of payroll costs (”Benefit survey highlights,” 2015).
Promoting Productivity
Economists, businesses, and governments recognize 
that productivity can be promoted and facilitated 
through technical change and increased trade. 
Technical change increases economic growth and 
productivity. As a result, businesses and governments 
actively promote technical change at the corporate 
and industry levels. Governments actively diffuse new 
technologies into society and industry in an effort to 
increase productivity in their nations and increase 
their level of international competition. Economists 
encourage the public and private sectors to cooper-
ate and work together to promote technical change. 
Governments and firms work together to promote 
the transfer and diffusion of new technologies in an 
effort to counteract and address market failures that 
inhibit the invention, innovation, and diffusion of 
new technologies (Curlee & Goel, 1989).
In addition to technical change as a means of 
promoting productivity, nations increase trade as 
a means of increasing productivity. In the years fol-
lowing World War II, nations have been engaging in 
trade agreements as a means of increasing economic 
efficiency, productivity, and growth. Regional trade 
zones facilitate commercial expansion. Today, trade 
relationships between nations are also political rela-
tionships. Trade relationships, as expressed in cus-
toms unions, have become political-economic unions 
for the world’s major trading powers including the 
United States, the European Union, Japan, China, 
and South Korea as well as developing nations.
APPLICATIONS
Productivity & Growth
Measuring Economic Growth
Policymakers and private sector investors recog-
nize that productivity is a key indicator of economic 
growth. As a result, these stakeholders require sig-
nificant information about productivity levels and 
projections (Schreyer, 2005). Nations around the 
world are working to increase their competitiveness 
in the global economy and marketplace. Economic 
competitiveness of nations is measured and tracked 
with tools such as the Growth Competitiveness 
Index and the Business Competitiveness Index. As 
global competition increases and influences eco-
nomic growth, these indexes are being eclipsed by 
the Global Competitiveness Index, which tracks and 
measures both macroeconomic and microeconomic 
factors of a country’s performance in the global 
marketplace. Competitiveness refers to the set of

institutions, policies, and conditions that decide 
productivity levels.
There are also alternate measures such as that made 
possible by images of “the earth at night.” Looking at 
such images, one sees that the brightness of visible 
lights is strongly related to both population density 
and income per capita. The observation that income 
per capita is one of the determinants of visible light 
suggests that visible light may have a use in helping to 
measure income. Some have suggested that lights data 
can augment or entirely replace data on gross domes-
tic product (Henderson, Storeygard and Weil, 2011).
Increased productivity creates growth (Snowdon, 
2006). Productivity is the key to the competitiveness of 
nations. Productivity growth can be input driven or total 
factor productivity driven. Growth in output per worker 
is related to advances in physical and human capital per 
worker, technology, and institutional change.
Extensive vs. Intensive Economic Growth
Economic growth, according to the World Bank, refers 
to a quantitative change or increase in development in 
a country’s economy. The economic growth of a nation 
is determined by measuring the percent increase in its 
gross domestic product over the course of one year. 
Economic growth occurs in two distinct ways. Economic 
growth of a nation occurs when a nation grows exten-
sively by using more physical, natural, or human 
resources or intensively by using resources more effi-
ciently or productively. Economic growth is generally 
considered to be either extensive or intensive in nature.

 Extensive economic growth refers to growth sce-
narios in which an increase in the gross domestic 
product is absorbed by population increase 
without any increase in per capita income.

 Intensive economic growth refers to growth sce-
narios in which gross domestic product growth 
exceeds population growth, creating a sustained 
rise in living standards as measured by real income 
per capita (Snowdon, 2006). According to the 
World Bank’s approach to promoting and facili-
tating the economic growth of nations, intensive 
economic growth of nations requires economic 
development.
Labor Productivity & Economic Growth
Economic growth is a focus of study and concern 
for economists, governments, and private sector 
development organizations. Economists are con-
cerned with forecasting and measuring economic 
growth. Governments and private sector develop-
ment organizations focus on forecasting and pro-
moting economic growth of regions and nations. 
Economic growth is generally promoted through 
efforts to increase labor productivity. Labor produc-
tivity growth is crucial to the strength and growth of 
economies.
Labor productivity is promoted in four main ways 
(Vanhoudt & Onorante, 2001):

 Organizations expand the physical capital of 
workers through the purchase of better machines, 
tools, and infrastructure.

 Organizations improve the knowledge capital of 
the workforce through education and training.

 Organizations foster a new economy by intro-
ducing new technologies to improve the produc-
tivity of all workers.

 Organizations 
strengthen 
relations 
between 
public and private sectors to facilitate the working 
of the labor market and limit economic distortions 
caused by taxes and passive labor market policies.
Tracking Economic Growth
Economic growth is generally tracked and measured 
by national governments and non-governmental 
economic research organizations. For example, in 
the United States, the National Bureau of Economic 
Research (NBER), the United State’s leading non-
profit economic research organization, determines 
and records dates for economic growth cycles and 
business cycles in the United States. The National 
Bureau of Economic Research published its first 
business cycle dates in 1929. The National Bureau 
of Economic Research, established in 1920, is a pri-
vate, nonprofit, nonpartisan research entity commit-
ted to fostering a better understanding of how the 
economy operates. National Bureau of Economic 
Research associates, including 600 professors of 
economics and business, develop new statistical 
measures, estimate quantitative economic behavior 
models, assess the impacts of public policies on the 
U.S. economy, and project the impacts of alternate 
policy proposals. The National Bureau of Economic 
Research established itself as the predominant 
research organization on the topic of U.S. business 
cycles and economic growth tracking through the

bureau’s early research on the aggregate economy, 
business cycles, and long-term economic growth in 
the United States.
Theories of Economic Growth
The two main theories of the economic growth of 
nations, neoclassical growth theory and new growth 
theory, connect growth and productivity levels.
 Neoclassical growth theory, also referred to as the 
exogenous growth model, focuses on productivity 
growth. The neoclassical growth theory was the 
predominant economic growth theory from the 
nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. Exogenous 
growth refers to a change or variable that comes from 
outside the system. Technological progress and en-
hancement of a nation’s human capital are the main 
factors influencing economic growth. Technology, 
increased human capital, savings, and capital ac-
cumulation are believed to promote technological 
development, more effective means of production, 
and economic growth (Brinkman, 2001).

 New growth theory, also referred to as the en-
dogenous growth theory, began in the 1980s as 
a response to criticism of the neoclassical growth 
theory. Endogenous growth refers to a change or 
variable that comes from inside and is based on 
the idea that economic growth is created and sus-
tained from within a country rather than through 
trade or other contact from outside the system. 
The new growth theory identifies the main en-
dogenous factors leading to sustained growth of 
output per capita including research and design, 
education, and human capital (Park, 2006).
Issues
Measures of Productivity
Economists engage in growth accounting and pro-
ductivity accounting to assess the strength of the 
economy and make economic projections. The main 
productivity measures include productivity growth 
indexes, productivity level indexes, and subjective 
productivity measures. Productivity measures include 
both objective and subjective efforts. Objective pro-
ductivity measures are based on quantitative data 
gathered from operations. Subjective productivity 
measures are based on personnel beliefs, percep-
tions, or attitudes as described on questionnaires 
(Kemppila & Lonnqvist, 2003).
Productivity Indexes
There are four different types of productivity level 
indexes: Single factor productivity (SFP), labor pro-
ductivity (LP), multifactor productivity (MFP), and 
total factor productivity (TFP).

 Single factor productivity refers to the measure-
ment of output quantity in relation to a single input.

 Labor productivity refers to the measurement of 
output quantity in comparison to a specified quan-
tity of labor, such as total amount of hours worked.

 Multifactor productivity refers to the measure-
ment of input quantity which can be used to esti-
mate total inputs.

 Total factor productivity refers to the measure-
ment of total output quantity in relation to a mea-
surement of the total input quantity.
Examples of productivity indexes include the 
Laspeyres productivity index and Paasche productiv-
ity index. These productivity indexes both control 
for price change. Productivity level index values are 
a useful tool as the values can be manipulated and 
compared as needed.
Productivity growth indexes measure changes in 
productivity over time. Standards of comparison, 
such as comparison over time, are pre-determined 
and explicit. As a result, productivity growth indexes 
invite and facilitate data comparison (Diewert & 
Nakamora, 2005). Labor productivity measures 
include the total number of hours worked divided by 
labor type and category. International development 
organizations, such as the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD), gather 
and publish productivity data. The Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development keeps an 
online productivity database, referred to as a statistics 
portal, that includes the following information on 
economies worldwide: The growth of gross domestic 
product (GDP), labor productivity growth, and labor 
productivity levels (Schreyer, 2005)
When total productivity cannot be measured, partial 
productivity measures, physical productivity measures, 
or indirect productivity measurement are undertaken.

 Partial productivity ratios are figured by dividing 
total output by a given input factor.

 Physical productivity measures are figured by di-
viding a typical output by an essential input.

Productivity
Principles of Business: Management
358

 Indirect productivity, also referred to as surrogate 
productivity, measures are used in situation where 
it is impossible to get the data needed for partial 
and physical productivity measures. Indirect pro-
ductivity measures should be taken in situations 
that include high defect rates, machine defects, 
unused capacity, high material scrap, unnecessary 
transports, poor atmosphere, and long waiting 
times (Kemppila & Lonnqvist, 2003).
Published Reports
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes 
productivity estimates for the business, non-farm 
business, and manufacturing sectors of the U.S. econ-
omy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics gathers its data 
from a monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). 
The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the Current 
Population Survey, which gathers information on the 
labor force, employment, and unemployment, for 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPS data sample 
includes 60,000 households from all U.S. states. The 
productivity index reports business sector productiv-
ity on a quarterly and annual basis. The Bureau of 
Labor Statistics productivity index does not measure 
the specific production factors such as the contribu-
tion of labor or capital and reflects the performance 
of the economy as a whole. This index only includes 
half of the industries in the business sector. The 
main industries reported are manufacturing, min-
ing, wholesale and retail trade, and transportation. 
Industries with less reliable data sources, such as 
health care, legal, financial, insurance and real estate 
services, are not represented in the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics productivity index (Kedrova, 2004).
Subjective Productivity Measurement
Traditional productivity measurement is a quantita-
tive endeavor in which inputs and outputs are reduced 
to quantifiable data. In addition to the quantitative 
measures, described above, subjective productivity 
measurement is emerging in the field of productivity 
measurement and assessment. Subjective productivity 
measurement refers to a process of obtaining produc-
tivity data by researching and examining the reports of 
pertinent stakeholders in relation to direct or indirect 
productivity. Subjective productivity measurement is 
based on the subjective assessments of organizational 
personnel. Assessment data is gathered through ques-
tionnaire and interview methods. At this point in the 
development of the subjective productivity measure, 
the method has been most often applied to work envi-
ronment and productivity studies.
Critics of subjective productivity measurement 
argue that the method lacks validity, reliability and 
practical applications. Validity refers to the ability of 
an approach to successfully measure what it intends 
to measure. Reliability refers to the consistency of 
measurement data. Subjective productivity measures 
are influences by respondents’ attitudes, values, and 
social phenomena. Supporters of subjective produc-
tivity measurement argue that the method operates 
as a managerial tool with which organizational man-
agement can gather unique insight about the connec-
tions between personnel and productivity. Subjective 
productivity measures may be best suited to the follow-
ing situations characterized by a lack of output-related 
information. Examples of ideal subjective productivity 
measurements include the following: Output is gener-
ated after a long time delay; large variations in the qual-
ity of input or output; large variations in the quantity 
of input or output; no tradition of productivity measur-
ing operations; no indirect factors that could relatively 
easily be measured (Kemppila & Lonnqvist, 2003).
CONCLUSION
In the final analysis, productivity is considered by 
economists to be one of the main factors in maintain-
ing and promoting economic growth. Economists 
focus on labor productivity measures as the chief pro-
ductivity indicator in large part because of the avail-
ability of data. In the United States, the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census gather monthly 
wage and labor data. The importance of productivity 
as an engine for growth is illustrated by the efforts 
of international development organizations, such as 
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development and the World Bank, to increase pro-
ductivity levels in nations worldwide.

Project Management
ABSTRACT
Project management is the process of planning, mon-
itoring, and controlling a unique set of tasks that have 
a discrete beginning, end, and outcome. The project 
management process is performed within the three 
constraints of time, costs, and scope. The goal of proj-
ect management is to produce a technically accept-
able product that is both on-time and within budget. 
To do this, project management attempts to reduce 
the risks associated with the project and maximize the 
benefits, including profit and marketability. A num-
ber of tools and techniques are available to help the 
project manager monitor and control projects.
OVERVIEW
A project is a unique, discrete set of tasks with a 
defined beginning, end, and outcome. This may be as 
simple as completing a paper for class or as complex 
as designing, developing, and testing a new destroyer 
for the Navy. No project is accomplished in a vacuum, 
however. Each task must be accomplished under the 
three constraints of time (e.g., the paper is due on 
Friday; the first destroyer must be operational and 
in the fleet ten years from the start of the contract), 
cost (e.g., research for the paper must be done in the 
local library rather than paying to download articles 
from professional sites; the destroyer must be built 
within the budget set by Congress), and scope (e.g., 
the paper can only be 5,000 words long, so needs to 
be limited to a narrow topic even though the back-
ground information is very interesting; the destroyer 
needs to be built to the specifications set at the begin-
ning of the project even though the customer or the 
project team think that additional features would 
make it better). Project management is a process that 
helps the project team accomplish its goals within 
the three constraints of time, cost, and scope. Using 
the principles and tools of project management, one 
can plan, organize, and manage the tasks to be done 
within the given constraints in order to accomplish 
the goal of the project.
Unfortunately, not every project is run using 
sound project management principles. Instead, many 
companies manage projects by doing the organiza-
tional equivalent of putting out brush fires, paying 
attention to whichever problem is most pressing at 
the time, while letting other problems grow only to be 
dealt with later at the expense of other project tasks. 
In a well-run project, on the other hand, the project 
manager — the project authority for planning, coor-
dinating, and managing the project — needs to be 
proactive rather than reactive, keeping a constant 
eye on all aspects of the project so that no one area is 
allowed to develop problems that could sabotage the 
overall project, and accomplishing the project goals.
Project management is essentially the art of proj-
ect control, with the continuing goal of keeping the 
project on time and within budget. This is often the 
interactive process of keeping the project within tech-
nical scope (i.e., not adding work to the project out-
side that which was originally planned), within the 
budget negotiated for accomplishment of the project 
tasks, moving along according to the predetermined 
schedule, and balancing the risks associated with 
changes in any of these areas and how they affect the 
accomplishment of the overall goal of the project. To 
do these things, project management activities focus 
on three things: the project and its goals, the process 
of how these goals are met, and the performance of 
individuals and organizations to accomplish these 
goals. If a project is managed well, its goals can be 
accomplished on-time and within budget, not only 
giving the organization a profit in the short-term, but 
enhancing its reputation for good work at a reason-
able cost; thereby enhancing its ability to continue to 
make a profit in the future.

APPLICATION
There are a number of tools available to help project 
managers manage their projects efficiently and effec-
tively. Several project management software packages 
are available that help project managers crunch the 
required numbers associated with risk management 
and other project management activities. However, 
project management is not a task that can be com-
pletely automated; human experience and judg-
ments are necessary.
To successfully manage a project, one must first 
understand the scope of the project (what needs to 
be done, what the end result should be and the limits 
placed on these elements by the schedule and bud-
get). In many cases, technical specifications will have 
been provided by the customer. For the example of 
the research paper, this may be simple: The paper 
needs to be 4,900–5,100 words long, follow a spe-
cific broad outline, be on a given topic, and use at 
least three professional references cited in APA for-
mat. For the example of the destroyer, however, the 
task is more complicated. Although the customer 
undoubtedly will provide technical specifications for 
what they want the new ship to be able to do, such 
specifications are long and complex, and need to be 
distilled and synthesized so that they can be tracked 
for project management purposes. One way to do 
this is through the use of a work breakdown struc-
ture (WBS). A good WBS provides a solid foundation 
for performing the tasks of project management on 
a complex project. By developing a thorough WBS, 
project management can be better prepared to con-
trol the project proactively, rather constantly react in 
emergency mode to unforeseen problems.
At its most basic, a WBS is a list of all the tasks 
that need to be done to complete the project. This 
is written as a hierarchy, starting with general tasks 
and then breaking these general tasks into more 
specific steps that need to be taken. For the proj-
ect of writing a paper, the general outline of the 
project might be to define the topic, collect data, 
write the paper, do quality control on the paper, 
and submit the paper. The initial step of defining 
the topic could further be broken down into sub-
steps such as scanning the textbook and materi-
als provided by the professor to narrow the topic 
into areas of interest, bounding the problem by 
doing preliminary research in the library or on the 
Internet to see what the components of the topic are, 
and developing an outline defining the sections of 
the paper that will be used both for data collection 
and for writing the paper itself. An example of a por-
tion of a WBS for writing a paper is shown in Figure 1.
In addition to developing a WBS, for more com-
plex projects it is often helpful to determine the 
critical path that defines which activities are critical 
to accomplishing the project in a timely manner. 
Critical path management (CPM) is a tool that helps 
project managers analyze the activities that need to 
be performed to accomplish the project and when 
each needs to be accomplished so that the rest of 
the project can proceed in a timely manner. This 
includes determining the order in which the tasks 
need to be accomplished, what tasks feed into them, 
and how long each task will take to accomplish. In 
the example of writing a paper, the critical path 
might include a target date for finishing the library 
research that allows sufficient time to synthesize 
the material before actually writing the paper. For 
example, a target date for finishing the first draft of 
the paper should be in place to leave sufficient time 
to do quality control on the paper, checking it for 
coherence and flow, grammar and spelling errors, 
and inclusion of all needed data. In the more com-
plicated example of ship design and development, 
the development of the critical path would allow the 
project manager to determine that the training com-
ponent could not be started until it was determined 
what tasks needed to be performed both in normal 
operations and in battle. An example of a portion of 
a critical path diagram for writing a paper is given in 
Figure 2. Note that there are two tasks that cannot be 
performed until the previous task is accomplished.

Another technique that may be of help in proj-
ect management is resource loading, the process of 
examining the project to determine which resources 
are most critical to the success of the project, and 
proportioning them among the various activities. 
In the example of the paper, most students find that 
their most critical resource is time. Resource alloca-
tion for writing the paper might include determin-
ing how much time can be devoted to the paper 
from start to finish while still getting other necessary 
activities accomplished (e.g., eating, sleeping, doing 
homework for other classes), then allocating that 
limited time appropriately within the project to each 
of the activities. For the development of the ship, of 
course, resources are not limited to time, but also to 
personnel available to work on the project, materi-
als necessary to perform the activities associated with 
the project (e.g., computer workstations, software 
licenses; steel, fiberglass, and other building materi-
als), and the money to acquire both. So, for example, 
if the budget only allows for the hiring of ten pro-
grammers, it must be determined which program-
ming tasks are the most critical and how much of the 
programmers’ time should be allocated to each to 
best keep the project on time and within budget.
Another widely used project management tool is 
the program evaluation review technique (PERT). 
PERT is a variation on the critical path method, 
and estimates not only the expected length of time 
to complete each activity in the project, but also the 
shortest and longest times that each activity could 
take. This gives project managers a window for each 
activity and helps them better predict future impact 
on the project if schedule estimates are not met. This 
system also helps project managers determine the 
exact status of the project and predict any potential 
trouble areas that might negatively impact either the 
schedule or budget of the project. To do this, PERT 
divides the project into separate, detailed tasks on a 
schedule. These tasks are then put together as part 
of an integrated network that shows how each task 
impacts the others as well as the overall critical path 
for the system. Each task is also associated with the 
appropriate resources — including time, manpower, 
and capital — that it has been allocated. After the 
system has been put into place, PERT implements a 
reporting system so that project managers can com-
pare actual performance and planned progress, and 
can continually check the status of the project.
Another popular scheduling tool for projects is 
the Gantt chart. On the vertical axis, the Gantt chart 
lists all the tasks to be accomplished for the project. 
On the horizontal axis, the chart lists the time for 
the accomplishment of these tasks, usually broken 
down into some pre-defined unit such as days, weeks, 
or months. Within the body of the chart, the various 
tasks to be performed are placed on the time line with 
an indication of the projected start and end dates for 
each activity. An example of a simplified Gantt chart 
for part of the paper writing task is shown in Figure 3.
When managing a project, cost and schedule 
often interact, affecting project performance. For 
example, budget constraints that prevent the orga-
nization from hiring additional programmers mean 
that there is less programming work that can be done 
on the project. Alternative solutions could include 
asking programmers to work overtime, hiring tempo-
rary or part-time workers for the short-term, or using 
only the current programmers and letting them fin-
ish their tasks as they can. Each alternative, however, 
has risks associated with it. The overtime option 
might require additional money or reduce the effec-
tiveness of overworked human beings, impacting 
both budget and schedule. The temporary employee 
option would also require additional funds for per-
sonnel, but would minimize these by using the addi-
tional personnel on an as-needed status. The option 
of working only with the current employees without 
overtime could run the risk of missed deadlines while

still requiring additional funds as the programmers 
work not longer hours in the day, but more hours 
in the project. Risk management is a generic term 
applied to considering such alternatives and balanc-
ing the impacts on the cost, schedule, and design in 
order to determine which alternative has the least 
impact on the overall performance of the contract.
The risks associated with not meeting the sched-
ule or budget of a project can affect not only the 
organization in the short term, but also its long-term 
viability as well as the career of the project manager. 
Business risks are the risks that could damage the 
organization in either the short term or long term if 
the project fails. Short-term risks might include such 
things as incurring unexpected expenses on a fixed 
price contract or not earning an expected incentive if 
a delivery schedule is not met. In addition, not meet-
ing deadlines or technical requirements could have 
long-term impact on the organization’s reputation 
and ability to obtain future business. For the project 
manager, there are also the personal and career risks 
incurred if the project fails. For all involved, there-
fore, it is important that risks be honestly recognized 
before hand and plans put into place so that their 
negative impact can be minimized if a task or activity 
runs into trouble.
Some of the risks associated with a contract depend 
in part on the type of contract that is in place for the 
project. The two basic types of contracts are the fixed 
price contract and the cost-reimbursable contract. 
In the fixed price contract, all project costs are built 
into the contract and the contractor must pay for any 
costs incurred over and above the contract amount. 
This type of contract is generally used where the con-
tract requirements are well-defined in advance and 
the associated costs can be predetermined. The cost-
reimbursable contract, on the other hand, is typically 
used in situations where the costs associated with the 
project cannot be adequately and accurately esti-
mated beforehand. In this type of contract, the con-
tractor is reimbursed for costs allowable under the 
terms of the contract and, therefore, incurs less risk. 
Contract type is actually a continuum from contracts 
where the risk is incurred by the contractor (e.g., 
firm fixed price contracts, fixed price with redeter-
mination contracts, and fixed price incentive con-
tracts in decreasing order of risk) or on the customer 
(e.g., cost plus fixed fee, cost plus incentive fee, and 
time and material, in order of increased risk for the 
customer). Contracts with high risk for the contrac-
tor require better risk management.
There are two aspects to risk management. Risk 
analysis is a planning activity to determine the pos-
sibility of risk and ways to reduce its impact. As part 
of this process, the project manager and key person-
nel determine three things: (1) what factors could 
cause the project to fail, (2) what the consequences 
of such failure might be, and (2) how likely failure is 
to occur. Various formulas are available to then deter-
mine the comparative severity and importance of 
each risk. For example, an activity that is likely to go 
wrong but that has little impact on the overall com-
pletion of the project is probably less important than 
an activity that has a smaller chance of failing but that 
would prevent successful completion of the project. 
After such determinations are made, a plan can be 
developed and implemented to handle the possibil-
ity of failure at any one of these points.
It is not enough to know what to do if a task or 
activity on a project fails. Good risk management 
also requires risk control. This project management 
responsibility includes such activities as monitoring 
the project risks so that they can be caught earlier 
rather than later in the process so that the contin-
gency plan can be put into effect as soon as possible. 
To maximize the effectiveness of the risk monitoring 
process, particularly on larger projects, also requires 
having a risk reporting structure in place so that 
those working closely on the at-risk activities can 
report problems to management in a timely manner.
There are a number of tools and techniques avail-
able for project risk management including software 
programs and risk calculation formulas. Computer 
simulations alone, however, are not adequate to pre-
dicting the impact of risk or for preventing it. Large 
projects typically build in periodic formal reviews 
held between both the contractor and the customer 
to jointly determine the status of the project and 
whether or not mid-course corrections are needed. 
Two major reviews that are often built into the sched-
ule are the preliminary design review (PDR) and the 
critical design review (CDR). The PDR is conducted 
after the preliminary design is complete but before 
the detail design is begun. During the PDR, the con-
tract describes any changes made to the original 
design along with the rationale for these changes. 
At PDR, the contractor may also provide a hands-on 
demonstration or proof-of-concept for the product.

Principles of Business: Management
364
The CDR is conducted before the design is released 
for manufacturing. Progressive or incremental CDRs 
may occur for subsystems of the project, followed by a 
system-level CDR to determine the completeness and 
feasibility of the design as a whole.

Resource Planning
ABSTRACT
This article examines resource-planning practices that 
are used to assure the proper timing and availability 
of resources. The concepts of optimal and maximum 
operational velocity are explained and the role of 
resource planning in the maintenance of operational 
velocity is examined. The importance of capacity plan-
ning and inventory management is reviewed along 
with methods that many organizations use to man-
age safety stock in order to smooth production flow. 
How resource planning practices and methods can be 
applied to service organizations is also examined.
OVERVIEW
Business Strategy
The business goals of a company as well as the busi-
ness goals of the channels in which it is a member, 
dictate overall corporate strategy. The grand strat-
egy, or master strategy, is a result of an analysis of the 
environment in which the company operates. The 
grand strategy is the mechanism by which the sepa-
rate entities within the firm develop their strategies 
and operational plans and determine their resource 
requirements. When a company implements its 
grand strategy it then has a path to follow and has set 
out long-term goals and a means to measure to what 
extent those goals have been achieved.
After the grand strategy has been developed and 
goals and measurement process of goal achievement 
have been established, then functional strategies 
can be developed. Each department in the company 
develops its functional strategy that guides activi-
ties in the department that are all designed to help 
the company achieve its overall strategy. Functional 
strategies must be consistent with the grand strategy 
as well as consistent with one another. The resource 
planning process assures that the acquisition of 
resources is planned in a manner that facilities effi-
cient work flow across functions.
Goals
Many departments share goals such as making a 
product available when needed, at the location it is 
needed and in the quantity it is needed. When the 
functional strategies of the manufacturing, logis-
tics, sales, and marketing departments are aligned 
to meet the overall goals of the company then the 
company is better able to meet customer service 
demands. These departments and their functional 
strategies also need to be integrated into the compa-
ny’s supply chain, which includes firms that provide it 
goods and services as well as its customers to which it 
supplies goods and services. Thus resource planning 
goes beyond the activities inside the company and 
resource needs are highly dependent on sources out-
side the company (Novack, Dunn & Young, 1993).
Business Processes
Strategies are accomplished through the execution of 
business processes. Each business process is a collection 
of activities that combine different inputs to create an 
output that is of value to the customer. Meeting customer 
expectations in a timely manner can be challenging if 
business processes are widely dispersed and inconsis-
tent. Consistent core business processes and data rep-
resentation are essential to allowing decision makers to 
respond quickly to the changing market (Singh, 2012).
Businesses generally engage in three main pro-
cesses: Acquiring and paying for resources, converting 
resources into goods/services, and acquiring cus-
tomers, delivering goods and services, and collecting 
revenues (Klamm & Weidenmier, 2004). Successful 
implementation of strategies requires that business 
processes be properly timed and appropriate resources 
be available when and where they are needed. Both the 
timing and availability of resources are accomplished 
through well-managed resource planning.

Resource Planning
One of the major objectives of resource planning 
is for a business to reach and maintain optimal 
operational velocity. At this point, the business has 
sufficient speed in delivering products or services 
to market, while simultaneously meeting all cus-
tomer expectations in a timely manner, and obtain-
ing a positive revenue stream from each activity. If 
addressed appropriately, maximization of opera-
tional velocity will drive the enterprise to achieve 
greater market share and revenue as operational effi-
ciencies are instituted (Stephenson & Sage, 2007). 
Achieving optimal operations velocity requires that 
the appropriate resources be in the right place at the 
right time. This requires advanced planning for the 
procurement of production materials, production 
capacity including facilities and equipment, and the 
workforce necessary for production, operations, dis-
tribution and sales.
Birshan, Engel, and Sibony (2013) provide some 
novel strategies for effective resource planning, 
including creating a corporate-resources map, 
benchmarking “resource inertia,” and reframing 
budget meetings as resource reallocation sessions, to 
name three.
APPLICATIONS
Managing Capacity & Resources in a Changing 
World
In high-tech industries that are highly competitive, 
a company’s ability to manage and adjust capacity 
as needed is critical for the long-term success of the 
company. Demand for products can change rapidly 
and there are many factors that can impact demand. 
Some companies and products have demand shifts 
based on seasons while others may be more tied to 
long-term economic conditions and still others may 
be influenced by short term economic shifts.
In addition, product life cycles can be very short 
for some products which means that companies that 
produce these products are planning for resources 
at least one if not several models ahead in the future. 
In such cases where life cycles are short it is critical 
that a manufacturer not hold excessive inventory of 
parts or supplies that may not be usable in the next 
iteration of the product. On the other hand, if parts 
or supplies can be used in several iterations in the 
future, it may be prudent to buy parts when demand 
for them is low and prices are not rapidly rising.
It is also important to carefully plan the introduc-
tion of product innovations. If a company introduces 
an innovation too soon then they may find that cus-
tomers are not ready for the innovation, which could 
impact sales. However, if an innovation is introduced 
too late and the product line lags behind competitors 
in functionality, then market share could be lost and 
sales decline.
So-called reverse innovation, in which an innovative 
product is introduced and adopted first in the devel-
oping world before migrating into mature markets, 
is gaining attention. Pioneered by such companies 
as GE, Procter & Gamble, and Levi’s, the strategy 
and its successes are described by Natalie Zmuda of 
Advertising Age (2011).
The Semiconductor Industry
The semiconductor industry faces many capacity and 
resources management issues that other industries 
do not. Although profit margins on semiconductor 
products can be attractive the initial costs of intro-
ducing a new product can be very high. The majority 
of this cost is manufacturing equipment and plants 
which in the semiconductor can be in the billions of 
dollars. This means that a semiconductor manufac-
turer needs to have high enough sales levels to justify 
investing in new plants. Added to the cost are also 
recent trends of relatively short life cycles for semi-
conductor products which mean frequent retooling 
of plants and equipment.
The Biotech Industry
The biotech industry faces similar challenges to 
that of the semiconductor industry. Although profit 
margins are favorable, developing manufacturing 
capacity is expensive with new facilities costing in the 
hundreds of millions of dollars. Any company in the 
biotech field must also have sufficient market share 
and a healthy customer base in order to sustain sales 
in volume and over time that allows for a return on 
investment for new manufacturing technology. Many 
biotech manufacturers and the companies that use 
their products have developed long-term supplier 
and purchaser agreements which helps the manu-
facturer lock in the long term customer and have a 
steady cash stream. Such agreements can also help 
the customer of the biotech manufacturer by assuring 

Resource Planning

368
supply and locking in a favorable price (Wu, Erkoc & 
Karabuk, 2005).
Resource Planning Optimization Techniques
Supply chain and resource planning optimization 
techniques are generally used to improve resource 
planning and maintain a desired level of profitability 
(Sourirajan, Ozsen & Uzsoy, 2007). As supply chain 
modeling methods have improved over time a more 
accurate forecast the need for raw materials, parts, 
and supplies. Modern supply chain simulation mod-
els can account for substitution of parts, time lags in 
the delivery of supplies or other delays in manufac-
turing as well as a wide range other resource planning 
issues (Gresh, Connors, Fasano & Wittrock, 2007).
Safety Stocks
When handling the problem of safety stocks sizing 
and positioning, safety stocks kept to face demand 
uncertainty are often positioned on pull managed 
resources, or the resources that are used to produce 
items. Positioning for safety stocks on push managed 
items (those items that are produced and sold by a 
company) can be expensive for a number of reasons. 
If parts are customized with company logos or brand 
names cost will certainly be higher. If parts are perish-
able or fragile in some way breakage or other dam-
age to the parts can easily occur. If demand for a part 
suddenly goes up and forecast for an additional sup-
ply of the same part is not modified upward safety 
stock could be depleted and production jobs may be 
delayed.
When order due dates equal the length of time of 
the manufacturing pipeline, there is no impact on 
the lower levels of BOMs, since the time allotted for 
the replenishment orders makes it possible to manu-
facture the items unavailable because of resource 
shortages. As a consequence, safety stock sizing and 
management are two issues that need to be solved 
together during the resource planning process. In 
particular, the best compromise between two alter-
native scenarios is to be found. On the one hand, 
replenishment of order due dates can be set equal 
to the end item lead times. This makes it possible to 
keep a reduced amount of safety stocks at the lower 
levels of BOMs. On the other hand, replenishment 
order due dates can be set equal to the overall length 
of the pipeline (Caridi & Cigolini, 2002).
The Supply Chain Approach
The supply chain approach to inventory and parts 
management is designed to reduce the amount of 
parts inventory and thus to rely on parts suppliers to 
have a predictable delivery time. In 1995 in the plan-
ning and procurement organizations of the Hewlett-
Packard Colorado Springs Division, a supply chain 
project was launched. The objectives of this resource 
planning effort were to provide planning and pro-
curement organizations with a methodology for set-
ting the best possible resource planning. This was all 
based on a cost benefit analysis tied to being able to 
accurately predict the amount of material to have on 
hand to meet production needs. The success of the 
system also relied on the ability of suppliers to meet 
previously agreed upon delivery schedules for parts 
and materials.
The fundamental challenge was to be able to deter-
mine a relatively accurate amount of various prod-
ucts to meet forecasted customer demand. Demand 
can certainly fluctuate so the supply chain system 
needed to have a highly predictable turnaround time 
on parts orders to meet production schedules that 
could change very quickly. So any company that is 
going to attempt to keep inventories of parts as low 
as a possible will always be at some degree of risk that 
sales forecast will be predicable and that suppliers 
can meet expected delivery schedules and if neces-
sary accelerate those schedules to meet fluctuations 
in demand.
Front-end Overdrive
Manufacturing planners have often attempted to 
hedge their risk of fluctuating demand and the need 
for parts to meet production schedules by adding a 
near-term overdrive effort to their production plan-
ning. This was usually done by increasing material 
requirements above the normally expected level 
of orders. Thus planners create what they feel is an 
adequate buffer of materials on hand at a production 
facility. This was a way to beat the existing systems 
without making permanent modifications to the nor-
mal safety stock system.
Although artificially increasing demand may serve 
short-term purposes the benefits of the supply chain 
and the previously calculated and determined deliver 
time on various parts is not utilized and parts inven-
tories may become excessive and impact the cash

flow of the company. Production planners work dili-
gently to meet schedules and often without serious 
regard to the impact of excessive parts on the long-
term profitability of a company. In addition, there is 
a strong possibility that the parts mix on hand may 
not take into to account those parts that have longer 
lead times and when the safety stock system is circum-
vented the imbalance of parts may cause production 
delays in the future.
The statistical methods utilized by purchasing 
departments to develop safety stock calculations are 
designed to make sure that parts are available for 
completed products. In many situations there are 
different limits on order sizes for different suppliers. 
These limits may be set by suppliers of by the pur-
chasing department in the buying organization. IN 
some cases there are minimum order quantities of 
the same part and in other cases there are minimum 
dollars amounts per order. When the production 
department is inflating projections for demand and 
parts orders become disorganized it can cause prob-
lems in procurement as well as driving parts costs up 
(Kruger, 1997).
Issues
Resource Planning in Service Industries
IBM and other service organization planners use a 
Resource Capacity Planning (RCP) Optimizer to 
provide managers with a adaptable framework to 
help model what has become known as the human 
resource supply chain. This type of system can help 
forecast and schedule human resources in a service 
environment as well as do double duty as a part of 
the invoicing process by creating bills of material 
(BOMs) for customers to whom which services are 
provided.
This is similar to the process of invoicing cus-
tomers for whom which a hard product such as a 
computer or special manufacturing machine was 
built. In the manufacturing case the invoice would 
include design, parts, materials, custom program-
ming, testing, and perhaps installation. In a ser-
vices environment were specialized human skills 
are provided on a production, as needed, or other 
special contracting situation the BOM covers the 
quantity of skilled personnel and their hours and 
other expenses required to meet the terms of the 
contract.
In general, a RCP is deployed in a service orga-
nization to address several types of problems includ-
ing dealing with where there are resource or talent 
gaps. The RCP can also help to reassign staff when 
there is an excess of specific types of talents o a proj-
ect or perhaps even a particular city or region. The 
primary goal is to make sure that human resources 
are deployed in a manner that adequately covers con-
tractual obligations across clients or across projects 
based on expected demand.
Human Resource Considerations
Human resource capacity planners in service orga-
nizations rely on the RCP to make decisions on how 
to address talent shortages, deal with the shortages 
and decide what to do with personnel that have 
talent and are abundant in the organization (or 
at least not in short supply). When there is excess 
supply of physical goods and materials the added 
cost, until they are eventually used, is for facility 
space. However, when there is an excess of human 
resources that cannot be immediately utilized and 
placed on a project for which there is billable time, 
the service organization still faces the cost of salary 
and benefits, and in some cases, if personnel are not 
at a customer’s site, the company may need to also 
provide office space and computer resources. This 
is often much higher than the overhead of storing 
physical materials. Thus an excess in a service orga-
nization is far more costly than an excess of materi-
als in a manufacturing company.
Another major difference between managing 
material resources and human talent is that in the 
case of material resources there is a very limited 
range of what most materials can be used for espe-
cially if they are fabricated-to-order parts. In the case 
of human talent it is entirely possible and very likely 
that employees of a service organization can have 
more than none talent. When dealing with informa-
tion technology, for example, many professionals 
have built a career by moving through the ranks and 
the various levels of their profession gaining skills 
and experience as they go through their career. Thus 
depending on the parameters and complexity of 
a contract some personnel may be able to fill more 
than one talent requirement. This means that the 
RCP needs to be able to take into account the various 
talents that all staff have as well as their proficiency 
level in their different areas of expertise.

Resource Planning
Principles of Business: Management
370
The Resource Action Problem
In addition to understanding the need for specific 
talents and who in a service company can perform 
those talents well, it is also necessary to be able to 
assign talent to the highest priority project. The chal-
lenge at this phase is to have a matrix that can accu-
rately depict what the highest priority project is.
Due dates on projects is certainly one way to deter-
mine which projects get which talent first. However, 
it is not just due dates that count. The importance of 
performing a certain function during any particular 
phase of a project may set the stage for the rest of 
the project plan to be smoothly executed. If a task or 
module of work takes only two days but four hundred 
additional days of human time is required to finish the 
project, and those days cannot proceed until a mod-
ule or task is done, then the importance of a talent 
to that project may outweigh considerations on other 
projects (Gresh, Connors, Fasano & Wittrock, 2007).
CONCLUSION
The business goals of a company as well as the busi-
ness goals of the channels in which it is a member, 
dictate overall corporate strategy. The grand strat-
egy, or master strategy, is a result of an analysis of the 
environment in which the company operates. The 
grand strategy is the mechanism by which the sepa-
rate entities within the firm develop their strategies 
and operational plans and determine their resources 
requirements.
Each of the functional entities within the firm, and 
in many manufacturing industries within the supply, 
must develop and then integrate their strategies in 
a coordinated manner in order to combine their 
efforts to accomplish the grand strategy. Each of the 
departments’ strategy must be consistent with the 
overall grand strategy and complement each other to 
achieve timely task completion and ultimately higher 
levels of customer service and satisfaction.
One of the major objectives of resource plan-
ning is for a business to reach and maintain optimal 
operational velocity. At this point, the business has 
sufficient speed in delivering products or services to 
market, while simultaneously meeting all customer 
expectations in a timely manner, and obtaining a pos-
itive revenue stream from each activity. If addressed 
appropriately, maximization of operational velocity 
will drive the enterprise to achieve greater market 
share and revenue as operational efficiencies are 
instituted.
Supply chain and resource planning optimization 
techniques have long been used to model the behav-
ior of manufacturing supply chains in order to allow 
better resource planning and improve profitability 
and efficiency (Sourirajan, Ozsen & Uzsoy, 2007). If 
a model does not actually depict the reality in which 
the organization works then the flow of resources will 
not be managed well enough to optimize a compa-
ny’s performance.
Service industries also face complex resource 
planning challenges and issues. However, these chal-
lenges and issues require a different mindset than 
required for manufacturing physical objects regard-
less of how complex that object may be. The matrix 
of human talent is sometimes difficult to inventory 
and talents, although they can be identified, may 
not be equal from employee to the next. Thus ser-
vice organizations not only need to know what their 
employees can do they need to have an understand-
ing of well they can actually perform a job.

Scenario Planning
ABSTRACT
Scenario planning is a way to help organizations 
think through their assumptions and become better 
prepared to flexibly respond to possible future condi-
tions. A scenario is a description of a possible future 
that identifies possible significant events that may 
happen in the future, major parties involved in that 
future, and the assumed motivations of those parties. 
The intuitive approach to scenario planning is based 
on the assumption that scenarios are not forecasts 
about the future, but possible alternative pictures of 
how organizational environments may develop. The 
formal style is more closely aligned with forecasting 
and uses computer modeling in an attempt to attach 
probabilities to the alternative scenarios. Although 
some organizations find scenario planning to be a 
useful tool, it is not without its detractors. However, 
if one is careful to avoid the various potential pro-
cess and content pitfalls that can affect the quality of 
the scenario, this approach to strategic planning can 
be very useful in helping an organization transcend 
its blind spots and give it the tools to be flexible in 
responding to future events.
OVERVIEW
The need for an alternative plan has become almost 
axiomatic in our constantly changing society. 
Alternative plans may be as simple as planning on 
staying close to home for vacation if the price of a 
barrel of oil continues to rise or as complex as plan-
ning how to operate in the global market if oil prices 
continue to rise. The need for planning against vari-
ous contingencies has even infiltrated our entertain-
ment media as exemplified by the thought bubble 
above the cartoon character falling over the cliff say-
ing: “Time for Plan B.”
One approach to future planning for business is 
called scenario planning. In this context, a scenario 
is a description of a possible future that identifies 
some significant events, the major parties involved 
in that future, and the assumed motivations of those 
parties for their actions in that future. Scenario plan-
ning is an approach to strategic planning in which 
a limited number of possible scenarios are drawn to 
describe possible alternative futures that may affect 
the functioning of the organization. Scenario plan-
ning helps the organization to better understand the 
nature and impact of forces driving its future. This 
process emphasizes the open exchange of knowledge 
from all involved parties and a mutual understand-
ing of issues that are central to the healthy function-
ing of the organization. Scenario planning has been 
an important tool for military planning for centuries 
and more recently has been used in making strategic 
business decisions. The use of scenario planning can 
help organizations make decisions based on likely 
futures such as whether to invest in more brick-and-
mortar retail locations or to move more of their retail 
selling online instead.
Schools of Scenario Planning Thought
There are two general schools of thought on how 
best to approach scenario planning.
Intuitive Approach
The intuitive approach, taken by such companies as 
Shell Oil, is based on the assumption that scenar-
ios are not forecasts about the future. Rather, this 
approach is based on the assumption that the future 
is uncertain and unknowable. Scenarios developed 
using the intuitive approach are possible alternative 
pictures of how the organization’s environment may 
develop. For example, Shell Oil’s approach to sce-
nario development is an iterative process compris-
ing five activities. The first phase in this approach to 
scenario planning is preparation. During this stage 
of the process, the organization articulates its goals 
and resources. This phase includes planning the 

Scenario Planning
Principles of Business: Management
374
project, allocating responsibilities, securing time 
for the process, setting research priorities, and con-
ducting interviews with key stakeholders. Phase 2 
of the scenario development process is pioneering. 
During this phase, the organization gathers infor-
mation across disciplines in order to challenge the 
conventional wisdom and address its blind spots. 
During this phase, themes are identified and sce-
narios outlined and built. Phase 3 of the process 
is mapmaking. During this phase, dynamics of the 
situations are clarified, illustrating information is 
gathered, and endorsements are gained. Phase 4 
is navigation. During this phase, the organization 
navigates its way to the actual events as they unfold. 
During this phase, scenarios provide a common lan-
guage that can be used to discuss complex issues 
and shape strategic conversations. The next phase 
of the scenario planning process is reconnaissance. 
During this phase, data are gathered concerning 
the viability of the scenario and the implications of 
the scenarios are tested. These steps are repeated in 
a continuing process over time to improve the sce-
narios in response to changes in the organization’s 
environment.
Formal Approach
An alternative approach to scenario planning is 
offered by the formal style used by Rand Corporation 
and other organizations. Although similar in many 
ways to the intuitive approach, the formal approach 
is more closely aligned with forecasting than is the 
intuitive approach. The formal approach also uses 
computer modeling in an attempt to attach probabil-
ities to the alternative scenarios.
Shortfalls of Scenario Planning
Scenario planning is not without its detractors. This 
approach to strategic planning requires decision 
makers to be willing to set aside their assumptions 
and preconceptions and to look objectively at pos-
sible futures that may run counter to their existing 
plans and philosophies. In addition, scenario plan-
ning requires research and the insights of external 
experts. As a result, the development of good scenar-
ios requires more work than some organizations are 
able or willing to devote to the task. Further, scenarios 
are only possible futures, not infallible predictions. 
Peter Schwartz — one of the leading proponents of 
scenario planning — once famously made a predic-
tion that “our view of the future is positive — but no 
more so than the times warrant. We live in extraordi-
nary times. The opportunities that are opening up 
in the next 20 years are enormous” (Stauffer, 2002). 
This statement, made in 1999, was followed by the 
first recession in a decade, the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, and the Enron scandal.
Strengths of Scenario Planning
Despite the fact that some events are simply not reason-
ably predictable, scenario planning remains a useful 
tool if one understands its goals. Scenario planning is 
used to improve the organization’s ability to be flexible 
in responding to rapidly changing environments, not 
to predict single-point changes in the organization’s 
environment. There are several reasons why scenario 
planning remains relevant for organizations.

 First, scenarios can help organizations ensure that 
they are focusing on opportunities that may be 
provided by a changing environment. Scenario 
planning is not a substitute for crisis planning. 
Rather, scenario planning is a long-range plan-
ning technique that allows decision makers to in-
vestigate the opportunities presented by likely fu-
tures. This allows organizations to better plan for 
both negative and positive future situations.

 Second, scenario planning enables organiza-
tions to more prudently allocate their resources. 
Scenario planning allows the organization to ex-
amine a range of potential futures, so that it can 
be better prepared to respond to any of the envi-
sioned plausible scenarios.

 Third, scenario planning allows the organization 
to preserve its options. If one understands that the

Planning

Principles of Business: Management
Scenario Planning
375
future is not certain, as well as how to prepare for 
some of this uncertainty, one can react to future 
events in a more timely and proactive manner.

 Fourth, scenario planning helps organizations to 
look ahead rather than to merely assume that the 
future will be a simple extrapolation of the past. 
The scenario planning also helps organizations to 
articulate and question their assumptions as well 
as to take into account the insights from other 
stakeholders so that a more realistic picture of the 
future can be painted.

 Finally, scenario planning offers organizations 
the opportunity to rehearse for the unexpected. 
Although the future scenario envisioned will most 
likely never be exactly the same as the actual fu-
ture, by envisioning and planning for likely sce-
narios, the organization can be better prepared to 
respond to what the future actually brings.
APPLICATIONS
Potential Pitfalls of Scenario Planning
Scenarios are based on the insights of experienced 
stakeholders as they attempt to consolidate and 
express their observations of past experience and 
future trends. As opposed to forecasting — which is 
an attempt to scientifically quantify and synthesize 
the data affecting a particular situation — scenario 
planning is more qualitative. This can be both a ben-
efit and a hindrance for strategic planning.
Integration Problems
Shoemaker (1990) lists a number of potential pit-
falls that can be experienced when attempting to do 
scenario planning for business. These pitfalls stem 
from two primary sources: process problems in the 
activities related to scenario development that unfold 
and build over time and problems with the quality 
of the content of the scenarios themselves. Process 
problems include issues related to the failure to inte-
grate the scenario-planning process into the other 
activities of the organization. For example, as with 
any organizational change activity, the failure to gain 
the support and involvement of top management 
early in the scenario-planning process can derail the 
process before it even begins. If top management is 
not a stakeholder in the process and its outcomes, 
it is unlikely that the process will receive either the 
resources or support necessary from other stakehold-
ers. Similarly, even if the scenario-planning process 
leads to valid and important predictions that require 
changes in the way that the organization does busi-
ness, if top management is not vested in the process 
and its outcomes, it is unlikely that these will be acted 
upon. In addition, when doing scenario planning, 
it is important to remember that these activities are 
only one part of the overall planning and decision-
making processes within the organization. Activities 
such as risk assessment and simulation can help inte-
grate the scenario-planning process into the overall 
organizational decision analysis process.
Incomplete Inputs
A second category of process pitfalls in scenario plan-
ning is an outgrowth of the failure to include all the nec-
essary inputs into the mix when developing scenarios. 
Scenarios are typically centered on external changes, so 
it is important to get the inputs of representatives of the 
communities that may affect change in the future (e.g., 
customers, suppliers, government regulators, academ-
ics, and other analysts) to provide their insights to the 
process. Similarly, it is important to secure the support 
of both line and staff members in the scenario-planning 
process. These two groups of people view the organiza-
tional universe through different lenses, and the inputs 
of both are needed. There is often an unfortunate 
tendency to emphasize the inputs of staff members. 
However, although staff personnel may understand the 
“big picture” better, it is the line personnel who under-
stand the minutia of organizational operations that can 
make an organizational plan a success or failure. It is 
important to have both line and staff personnel equally 
involved in the scenario-planning process.
Misunderstandings
Another cluster of potential pitfalls related to process 
issues in scenario development arises from a lack of 
understanding of the scenario-planning process and 
its outcomes. Some organizations, for example, enter 
into scenario planning without a clear understanding 
of the process and roles of the various participants in 
the process. Scenario planning is typically a time-con-
suming process that requires research and the abilities 
to abandon one’s assumptions and to see situations 
from alternative perspectives. Scenario planning is 
not a process that translates into a quick fix for the 
ills of the organization. The primary purpose of the 

Scenario Planning
Principles of Business: Management
376
process is to help stakeholders and decision makers 
to better understand the ramifications of various pos-
sible scenarios on their strategic plans. In addition, 
scenario planning is only one potential step in strate-
gic planning. To assist in this process, it is helpful to 
articulate a clear roadmap for the participants so that 
they know what to expect. Failure to do this can result 
in participants who are unwilling or unable to put in 
the work necessary to make the process a success.
Failure to Take All Necessary Steps
Another group of process-based pitfalls that can be 
encountered in scenario planning stems from not 
doing all the required steps necessary for the develop-
ment of realistic scenarios. Scenario planning is — at 
its core — a learning process that cannot be rushed. 
Sufficient time needs to be allowed for learning 
about trends and factors that can affect the organiza-
tion’s future plans. Unlike a math problem, the goal 
of scenario planning is not to get the “right” answer 
the first time. Adequate time needs to be allowed 
to explore various likely alternative scenarios and 
play them off each other to help participants better 
understand the underlying factors and assumptions. 
Because of this, it is also important not to develop 
too many scenarios. Scenarios should be distinctly 
different from each other in order to maximize the 
usefulness of the technique (usually between three 
and five). Finally, scenario planning can be a con-
tinuing process as more data are acquired and pro-
cessed. Scenarios and resultant strategies alike need 
to be refined to better fit the continuing stream of 
data and changes in trends over time.
Failure to Address Underlying Issues/Problems
In addition to process-based pitfalls, the scenario-plan-
ning process can also suffer from problems with the 
quality of the input to the process. For example, it can 
be difficult for many organizations to objectively think 
about long-term scenarios when they already are suc-
cessfully thriving in the marketplace. Too many orga-
nizations tend to deal with the symptoms (i.e., “put out 
fires”) rather than the underlying problems. Although 
this may be a successful strategy in the short term, 
it tends to be counterproductive in the long term. 
Particularly in this age of rapidly emerging technology, 
emphasis on information, and increasing globaliza-
tion, it is essential that organizations carefully con-
sider the impacts of such changes in the marketplace 
on their strategies. To do this, the organization must 
take into account the historical perspective without 
being bound by it. It can be helpful, for example, for 
the organization to compare itself with other indus-
tries that have experienced unexpected discontinui-
ties or progressed further in terms of various issues of 
concern (e.g., regulation, technological advances). 
However, focusing too intently on trends can lead to 
scenarios that simply project the past into the future 
without truly applying the type of out-of-the-box think-
ing required for the development of good scenarios.
Lack of Diverse Viewpoints
Another problem that can be experienced during sce-
nario development is that all the scenarios are merely 
variations on a single theme. A set of scenarios should 
represent the full range of viewpoints both within and 
outside of the industry. In particular, scenario develop-
ment should take into account the viewpoints of cre-
ative and innovative thinkers. In addition, in order for 
scenarios to be useful, they need to be internally consis-
tent. One should make sure that the main trends within 
a scenario are mutually consistent with each other and 
that the key uncertainties within a scenario are com-
patible. For example, it is unlikely that the near future 
will include a situation where there is full employment 
and zero inflation. Similarly, when postulating possible 
actions of major stakeholders, one should make sure 
that these actions are consistent with their interests. 
One way to help in the development of a realistic sce-
nario is to try to understand the underlying problems 
and factors that can affect the future rather than merely 
brainstorming a wide-ranging list of possible symptoms.
By its very nature, a good scenario will often fly 
in the face of the conventional wisdom of the orga-
nization. Although organizational management may 
have legitimate political, emotional, and other con-
cerns, the development of the good scenario must 
be predicated on intellectual honesty and an objec-
tive look at all the relevant factors that may affect the 
organization’s future.
However, a good scenario is not merely a snapshot 
of what the future might hold. Rather, it is a roadmap 
showing how the situation may develop from its cur-
rent state to the projected future state.
Lack of Decision-Maker Input
Finally, good scenarios need to be relevant to the 
key decision makers within the organization. It is the 

Principles of Business: Management
Scenario Planning
377
responsibility of those who develop the scenarios to 
make sure that decision-makers understand its rel-
evance. For example, the implications of the rising 
cost of a barrel of oil may not be immediately appar-
ent to widget manufacturer. However, if that manufac-
turer is involved in the global economy, the rising cost 
of a barrel of oil will translate into rising transporta-
tion cost both upstream and downstream in the sup-
ply chain that could potentially price the organization 
out of competition. Similarly, even if the widgets are 
only sold locally, rising fuel costs could translate into a 
situation where fewer potential customers are willing 
to pay for the fuel necessary to go to the widget store to 
purchase a widget. However, if the decision makers do 
not understand such facts, they may dismiss a realistic 
scenario out of hand.
CONCLUSION
Scenario planning is an approach to strategic plan-
ning helps the organization better understand 
the nature and impact of forces driving its future. 
Scenarios are based on the insights of experienced 
stakeholders as they attempt to consolidate and 
express their observations of past experience and 
future trends. Scenario planning has been suc-
cessfully used by many Fortune 1000 companies. 
However, it is often not used more widely because 
scenario planning requires decision makers to think 
“out of the box” and envision possible likely futures 
that may run counter to current corporate plans and 
philosophies. In addition, scenario planning is not 
universally successful due to a number of potential 
pitfalls stemming from both the process used for 
developing the scenarios as well as the quality of the 
content of the scenarios themselves.

Service Operations Management
ABSTRACT
An increasing number of businesses are offering ser-
vices rather than tangible goods. Although custom-
ers’ opinions of service quality are directly related 
to a company’s profitability, many organizations fail 
to control and improve their customer service pro-
cesses. These processes tend to be difficult and costly 
to control because of their intangibility, heterogene-
ity, and inseparability. However, operations manage-
ment principles can be applied to service industries 
in an effort to improve quality. One must first under-
stand what the customer wants from the customer 
service process and then identify fail points in the 
process where it is likely to go wrong. No matter how 
well the customer service process is designed and 
implemented, problems are unavoidable. Customer 
dissatisfaction as a result of errors, however, is not. 
There are a number of ways to recover from customer 
service problems and maintain customer loyalty.
OVERVIEW
As the state-of-the-art 21st century technology con-
tinues to expand and high tech solutions proliferate, 
more and more businesses offer services instead of, or 
in addition to, tangible products. In fact, the service 
industry is the largest and fastest growing business 
sector in the United States. Despite the opportunities 
offered by this growing sector, however, businesses 
are faced with the problem of determining how to 
manage operations where the products are intan-
gible. As a result, research has found that most con-
sumers are dissatisfied with the customer service they 
receive from these businesses. This fact, combined 
with the increasing service competition that arises 
out of the growing trend toward globalization, means 
that increased emphasis needs to be placed on opera-
tions management in service organizations just as it is 
in manufacturing organizations.
Operations Management & the Service Sector
Operations management comprises those areas of 
management that are concerned with productiv-
ity, quality, and cost in the operations function (i.e., 
those activities necessary to transform inputs such as 
business transactions and information into outputs 
such as completed transactions) as well as strategic 
planning for the organization. The service sector 
has been described in many ways. In its essence, the 

Principles of Business: Management
Service Operations Management
379
service sector includes those industries and busi-
nesses that provide services rather than tangible 
products for individual consumers, businesses, or 
a combination of the two. These can include physi-
cal, mental, or aesthetic activities (e.g., legal services, 
entertainment, auto repair) or the transformation 
of something through such an activity (e.g., hair cut-
ting, education, management consulting).
Like defining the service sector itself, defining 
operations management for the service sector is more 
problematic than defining operations management 
for other sectors (i.e., transportation, communica-
tions, and utilities; wholesale or retail trade; finance, 
insurance, and real estate; public administration). It 
is relatively easy to determine when a widget is not 
of acceptable quality. The manufacturer will have a 
manufacturing specification that describes what the 
tolerances are for the product and quality control 
will accept or reject the product based on whether 
or not it is within the specifications. Similarly, a man-
ufacturing process can be evaluated to see where 
there is waste in the process or where efficiencies can 
be introduced. However, it is not so obvious where 
to improve quality or cost-effectiveness for service 
industries. For example, how does one specify the 
quality of a new hairstyle? Although in some cases a 
bad haircut can be obvious to all, a new hairstyle may 
be a matter of aesthetics: What looked good in the 
magazine on the 20 year-old model may not look so 
good on the middle-aged customer with a different 
bone structure. Similarly, how does one evaluate the 
cost of creating a new work of art or the training of a 
hotel employee? Yet, the quality of customer service 
must be operationally defined in order for the orga-
nization to be consistently effective.
Quality Improvement & Control
Despite the fact that research has shown that custom-
ers’ opinions of service quality are directly related to 
company profitability, many service organizations do 
not try to control and improve quality. This is due in 
part to the fact that service quality is often difficult 
and costly to control and improve. It is also due to 
the differences between the activities and products 
of the service industry and those of the manufactur-
ing industry. In manufacturing, results are tangible 
and can be quantified. This fact makes it easier to 
control quality than in the service industry where the 
“product” is intangible. Further, in manufacturing, 
statistical quality control methods can be built into 
the process so that quality is monitored and cor-
rected at several key points in the process. In most 
manufacturing processes, there are typically several 
points at which the product can be quality tested so 
that substandard parts or products can be rejected or 
the process can be rectified as necessary before the 
products reach the consumer. This approach, how-
ever, is not possible in the service industry: One can-
not do a quality control check on services before they 
reach the customer.
Three Reasons for Control Difficulties
There are three reasons that services are difficult to 
control: intangibility, heterogeneity, and inseparabil-
ity. The quality of customer service is not based on a 
product that one can touch. Characteristics of good 
customer service more often have to do with speed 
of delivery of the service, the competence with which 
the service is delivered, and the courtesy with which 
it is offered. Such factors are difficult to quantify for 
a number of reasons, not the least of which is the 
perceptions and expectations of the customer. It can 
be difficult to operationally define good customer 
service. For example, does walking the customer 
through a troubleshooting procedure step-by-step 
in an attempt to be thorough constitute good cus-
tomer service, or does listening to the customer in an 
attempt to find out what s/he has already tried con-
stitute good customer service? The former situation 
is apt to antagonize someone who is knowledgeable 
about the process while the latter approach is likely 
to miss important steps with a customer who only 
thinks s/he is knowledgeable. In some situations, 
there are, of course, some aspects of customer service 
that are tangible (e.g., receiving starter checks when 
opening a new bank account). However, these tend 
to be much poorer predictors of customer satisfac-
tion than are the intangible factors.
Factors that Affect Quality of Service
In addition to being intangible, services tend to be 
heterogeneous in nature, and not consistently per-
formed. Quality of service depends on a number of 
factors, including the personalities and expectations 
of each of the parties involved. For example, when 
a technophobe calls a technical support help line 
to troubleshoot what is wrong with his computer, he 
expects and needs to be treated with a step-by-step, 

Service Operations Management
Principles of Business: Management
380
hand-holding approach that will allow him to trust 
the person on the other end to walk him through 
the steps. If an experienced computer programmer 
calls the technical help line, however, the same step-
by-step approach based on the assumption that the 
customer is clueless is more apt to be irritating than 
helpful. Similarly, the retail assistant who greets the 
customer at the door and follows her throughout 
the shopping experience may be perceived as help-
ful to some customers and intrusive by other cus-
tomers. Human nature makes customer service a 
complicated process. What works with a given cus-
tomer today (e.g., when the customer wants help) 
may not work with the same customer tomorrow 
(e.g., when the customer is in a hurry and does not 
want to linger over the process).
A third characteristic of customer service is 
inseparability. Customer service is performed 
in the presence of the customer and becomes 
inseparable in the customer’s mind from the orga-
nization as a whole. So, for example, if a software 
manufacturing company provides poor customer 
service to someone logging on to the support 
database or calling the technical help line, in the 
customer’s mind, the service will be inseparable 
from the product. Most customers do not differenti-
ate between the quality of the product and the quality 
of the service. An overview of the dimensions of cus-
tomer service is given in Table 1.
Steps to Improving Customer Service
Despite the more nebulous nature of service versus 
manufacturing, operations management principles 
can be applied to service industries in an effort to 
improve quality. The first step in improving customer 
service is to ascertain whether or not one is offering 
the service that the customer wants. For example, no 
matter how good an automated troubleshooting sys-
tem is, if the customer wants the personalized service 
of talking to a live person, the automated system will 
never be sufficient. Another action taken to improve 
customer service is to improve the service system 
itself. Various program management techniques 
including PERT charts and Six Sigma programs can 
be used in an attempt to regularly assess and ensure 
quality. However, when dealing with the service 
industry, these tools tend to miss one of the major 
components of the system: The customer’s interac-
tion with the service.
The Blueprint Method
Once the service for which the customer is looking 
has been determined, one can next determine how 
to better provide that service for the customer. One 
of the ways to overcome this omission is through the 
“blueprint” method. The various steps part of this 
method are:
Flowcharting
The first step in the blueprint method is to specify 
the complete service process in a flow chart. This 
schematic should distinguish between those opera-
tions or activities that are seen by the customer and 
those that are not. Even though part of the process is 
not seen by the customer, it still can affect overall cus-
tomer satisfaction with the service. For example, the 
computer software used by a credit card company will 
probably never be seen by the customer. However, if 
the software prints out credit card statements in a for-
mat that the customer finds difficult to decipher, the 
software will negatively impact customer satisfaction. 
Similarly, many grocery stores use software to help 
design the store layout in order to give customers eas-
ier access to certain items or to give designated stock

a place of prominence for promotional purposes. 
Although the customer will probably never see that 
software, either, if s/he has to search for the Nutty 
Crunchy cereal for the third time in two months, 
s/he is not likely to be satisfied with the store’s cus-
tomer service.
Determining Fail Points
Once the service process has been flowcharted, the 
next step in the blueprint method is to analyze it to 
determine where there are fail points — the criti-
cal points in the process where the provider has the 
opportunity to make a serious mistake that can neg-
atively impact the customer’s satisfaction with the 
process or his/her perception of quality. This allows 
the provider the opportunity to design fail-safe sub-
processes that can be integrated into the overall 
service process so that potential missteps are caught 
before they affect the customer’s perceptions of the 
service or the process. The determination and elimi-
nation of fail points is one of the most difficult steps 
in the blueprint process. One of the reasons for this 
is that it is important to determine the time frame 
of the fail points since time is an important factor 
in service cost. However, the more complex the ser-
vice process, the more difficult it is to pinpoint time 
frames.
Determining Time Frame
To do this part of the analysis, it can be helpful to first 
determine how long it takes to perform the process 
when all aspects of the situation are normal. From a 
customer’s point of view, satisfaction with the process 
or service decreases in direct relations to the degree 
to which the process or service takes longer than 
expected. Once this “ideal” time frame is developed, 
time frames can be developed for various foresee-
able deviations from the normal case. For example, 
a grocery store could determine the amount of time 
it should take a checkout clerk to ring up an order 
with a given number of items. From there, it could 
be determined how long it would take if one of the 
items were not marked with the price or the SKU had 
not been entered into the system. This process could 
be performed for other deviations from the “ideal” 
checkout situation such as the use of coupons, the 
customer not having picked up sufficient items to 
qualify for a sale price, and so forth.
Profitability Check
Once the ideal and deviation time frames have been 
determined, the blueprint should next be checked 
for profitability. This activity involves quantifying 
the cost of various deviations on profitability. For 
example, the situation where an item is not entered 
into the computer means that the transaction needs 
to be stopped while someone is sent to look for the 
correct price on the shelves or in the sales flyer. This 
person needs to return to the checkout line or call 
the checker with the correct price. This deviation not 
only affects the time frame for service of the person’s 
order with the undocumented item, but also affects 
the time frame for service for the people standing in 
line behind that person.
Use of Technology
In some instances, there are ways to speed up pro-
cesses or increase efficiency through the use of 
technology. For example, to help get the customer 
through to the correct person on a telephone help 
line, many businesses use an automated telephone 
answering system. From the organization’s point of 
view, the use of this technology can get customers 
help in a more timely manner while reducing the 
number of employees that the organization needs to 
hire to answer the phones. The automated system can 
even offer the customer answers to frequently asked 
questions while they are waiting on hold. However, 
if from the customer’s point of view the answering 
system is too impersonal or cumbersome, then cus-
tomer satisfaction decreases and counteracts the effi-
ciencies gained by implementing the system. When 
dealing with customer service issues, the object of the 
exercise is not only to increase the efficiency of the 
process, but to do so while not decreasing the cus-
tomer’s perception of quality.
APPLICATIONS
No matter how well the customer service process is 
designed and implemented, errors and problems are 
unavoidable. Customer dissatisfaction as a result of 
these things, however, is not. It may be tempting to 
consider the one complaining customer as an out-
lier who does not represent customers in general or 
whose opinion does not reflect badly on the organi-
zation’s service process. However, such customers 

Service Operations Management

should not be dismissed. Such customers typically 
represent a silent number of other customers who 
did not bother to complain. In addition, according 
to industry experts, it costs five times more to replace 
a customer than to retain one. Therefore, customer 
satisfaction is important to the success of the business.
At virtually every fail point, there is a concomi-
tant opportunity for recovery. To take advantage of 
these opportunities, however, appropriate mecha-
nisms need to be in place. The best way to recover 
from problems with customer service is to empower 
front-line employees to handle them as they arise. 
Being told that the problem is not the fault of the 
employee and that s/he can do nothing about it is 
not going to soothe the customer. The customer 
sees the front-line employee as a representative of 
the organization at large; if the front-line employee 
is powerless or incompetent, the customer is more 
likely to take the same view of the business in general. 
Therefore, although it is important to manage ser-
vice operations well, it is equally important to be able 
to manage service recovery well for those inevitable 
situations where problems arise.
There are several ways to do this. First, manage-
ment needs to understand the costs associated with 
mismanaged customer service as well as the costs 
to recover from the situation. For example, at Club 
Med, a satisfied customer typically visits the resort 
chain four more times after the initial visit whereas a 
dissatisfied customer does not. On average, for every 
customer who does not return, Club Med loses $2400 
in income. This loss is in addition to the expenses of 
marketing to find replacement customers.
Another way to improve customer service is to lis-
ten closely to what the customer has to say. One way 
to do this, of course, is to listen to customer com-
plaints and take them seriously. These are opportu-
nities to learn how to improve the service process. 
However, although some customers freely complain 
to the organization about poor service, most do not, 
and just slip quietly away. To help overcome this prob-
lem, the business should make it easy for customers 
to complain. Asking customers how the service was 
is one way to do this, as are toll-free 24-hour com-
plaint hot lines. However, no matter the medium, it 
is important to really listen to the customer so that 
the complaint and the underlying problem are well 
understood and appropriate action can be taken. It 
is also important that this action be taken quickly 
before the customer’s negative reaction to the busi-
ness becomes solidified.
Although management is sometimes required to 
intervene in order to solve a customer service prob-
lem, the best way to handle problems quickly and to 
minimize negative impact is to train employees to 
identify problems and empower them to respond to 
them. Training can help employees know where the 
fail points in the process are and help them learn to 
detect when a problem occurs. In addition, employ-
ees who deal with customers need to be given both 
the authority and responsibility to react to customer 
service problems and rectify the situation appro-
priately. To further encourage trained, empowered 
employees to give excellent service, it is helpful to 
put incentives in place to encourage good customer 
service and to recognize those who rectify problems 
quickly, quietly, and well. Through this combination 
of actions, the impact of inevitable customer service 
problems can be minimized and the business can 
keep and expand its customer base.

ABSTRACT
This article will focus on special topics in man-
agement that cut across management fields and 
areas of expertise. The special topics of this arti-
cle, which include human-resource management, 
information management, crisis management, and 
issues management within organizations, will be 
of special interest to students, scholars, and prac-
titioners of management. An overview of the field 
of management, including the history of manage-
ment, management careers, and management 
roles and skills, will be provided and serve as the 
foundation for the discussion of special topics in 
management.
OVERVIEW
Management refers to the work or act of directing 
and controlling a group of people within an organi-
zation for the purpose of accomplishing shared goals 
or objectives. People in management positions con-
trol and coordinate organizational activities, employ-
ees, processes, resources, goals, and objectives in 
every field and industry. Managers of all kinds work 
within organizations. The structures of organizations,

from financial investment firms to industrial produc-
tion facilities to colleges and universities to hospi-
tals and medical facilities, have similarities in areas 
such as established work flow, clear leadership, and 
shared objectives. The study of management reveals 
that managers in all industries must handle employ-
ees, information, change, crisis, and ethical issues. 
Special topics in the study of management reveal 
what unites managers in their work and what issues 
unite the field of management studies.
The following sections — history of management, 
management careers, and management roles and 
functions — will serve as the foundation for a discus-
sion of the management issues of human-resource 
management, information management, crisis man-
agement, and issues management that cut across all 
fields and industries. These special topics may be of 
critical interest to all those concerned with the effec-
tive management of people, information, material 
resources, time, and money.
The History of Management
The focused study of management began during 
the late 19th century in an effort to increase the effi-
ciency of the labor force. The Industrial Revolution, 
a period characterized by the adoption of large-
scale factory production, changed labor practices 
throughout the world. The creation of large-scale 
production facilities necessitated the creation of the 
role of manager to coordinate the efforts and labors 
of large groups of people.
The study of management during the late 19th to 
mid-20th century was conceived of as an applied sci-
ence intended to increase worker and organizational 
efficiency. Classics in the study of management include 
Frederick Taylor’s scientific management, Henri Fayol’s 
theories of administration and labor, Max Weber’s clas-
sical organization theory and bureaucracy model, the 
Hawthorne studies’ human-relations model, Douglas 
McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y, and Abraham 
Maslow’s model of hierarchy of human needs.
Management, as defined and understood by 
classical management theorists such as Fayol and 
Taylor, leads, enforces, and plans in the interest of 
efficiency and profit. Fayol, along with Taylor and 
other classical management theorists, developed a 
deeply entrenched theory, approach, and practice 
of management appropriate for hierarchical and 
bureaucratic organizations. Classic management, 
as defined by Fayol, consists of five main functions, 
roles, or actions:

 Planning: forecasting, strategizing, and deciding 
what needs to happen in the future.

 Organizing: making efficient use of human and 
material resources.

 Leading: motivating, commanding, and exhib-
iting skills to inspire and lead employees.

 Coordinating: unifying and harmonizing all orga-
nizational activity and effort.

 Controlling: monitoring and checking employee 
performance for conformity and uniformity.
The study and practice of management from 1960 
to 1990 was characterized by psychologically focused 
management strategies such as the management grid 
and job-enrichment programs. Management theory, 
practice, and scholarship since 1990 has been char-
acterized by a focus on issues of leadership, group 
dynamics, and employee motivation. Managers in 
modern organizations must respond to new tech-
nologies, new organizational models, the economic 
forces of globalization, and increased diversity in the 
workforce (Zuidema, 1994).
Management: Functions, Roles, & Skills
The field of management includes numerous areas of 
expertise and influence. Managers work in business, 
industry, education, and social-service organizations. 
Examples of management occupations, as described 
by the US Department of Labor, include the following:

 Administrative services managers

 Advertising, marketing, promotions, public rela-
tions, and sales managers

 Computer and information systems managers

What is a manager’s job? While the exact skill set 
required of a manager varies by industry, there are simi-
larities in designated managerial functions, roles, and 
skills. Management theory, as described in the previous 
section, was first defined in the early 1900s. Classic theo-
ries and approaches to management continue to influ-
ence both management curriculum and practice.
As described by Henri Fayol’s 14 principles of 
management, first published in General and Industrial 
Management (1917), classical management the-
ory of the 20th century was characterized by pro-
scribed rules, expectations, demeanor, and values as 
described below:

 Division of work: specialization of work and 
labor will increase personal and organizational 
productivity.

 Authority: management has the right to give or-
ders and the power to expect obedience.

 Discipline: employees must obey, and manage-
ment must provide good leadership.

 Unity of command: each employee has only one 
boss, with no challenges to lines of reporting and 
command.

 Unity of direction: workers engaged in the same 
activities must receive the same direction and 
objectives.

 Subordination of individual interests: workers and 
managers must work for and toward the goals of 
the organization.

 Remuneration: payment for services is required 
for reasons of ethics and motivation.

 Centralization: management functions are gener-
ally centralized and consolidated at one level of 
the organization.

 Chain of authority: a formal and hierarchical chain 
of command should structure the organization.

 Order: formal organization of material and 
human (or personnel) resources is required.

 Equity: employees of an organization should re-
ceive equitable treatment.

 Personnel tenure: stability of employment and 
limited turnover of personnel strengthen an 
organization.
 Initiative: employees should be allowed opportuni-
ties to demonstrate initiative within the organization.

 Esprit de corps: morale, harmony, and cohesion 
should be facilitated and encouraged within the 
organization.
While modern approaches to management still 
include these 14 principles, they also require the 
ability to manage change, information, and organi-
zational values. Modern management, particularly 
in information technology (IT) and service sector 
fields, is characterized by adaptability, flexibility, and 
responsiveness.
Modern business organizations, responding to 
new technology, increased competition, and changes 
in trade regulations around the world, are transi-
tioning from hierarchical and centralized forms 
to group-model and decentralized organizations. 
In response to the new forms of business organiza-
tions, such as high-tech companies and multinational 
corporations, managers and management theory 
have evolved their skill sets to include greater facil-
ity for managing change, information, and human 
differences.
Ultimately, the job of management includes plan-
ning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling, 
motivating, communicating, coaching, problem solv-
ing, decision making, and leading. In any of the com-
mon modern branches of management, including 
clinical management, financial management, facil-
ity management, operations management, human-
resource management, information management, 
information systems management, and general 
retail, business, and industry management, manag-
ers will be challenged by the special issues described 
in the following section (Wartenberg, 1996).
Issues
Managing Employees, Information, Crises, & 
Ethical Issues
There are numerous topics and issues that cut across 
management fields and careers. In particular, man-
agers in all industries encounter issues associated 
with managing employees, information, crises, and 
ethical issues. These management challenges belong 
to established fields of management study:

 Human-resource management

 Information management

 Crisis management

 Issues management

The following sections analyze these special topics 
in management.
Human-Resource Management
Human-resource management (HRM), also called 
personnel management, refers to how organizations 
manage the valuable resource of human capital. HRM 
is considered to be a source of competitive advantage 
for organizations and is linked to increased produc-
tivity and employee performance. Organizations that 
explicitly value employees as a source of competitive 
advantage have been found to have better perfor-
mance than other firms.
Organizations may choose between traditional and 
high-involvement human-resource strategies. High-
involvement HRM strategy emphasizes the value of 
employees as a source of competitive advantage in 
the marketplace. HRM strategies are employed by 
multinational corporations and local firms alike in 
organizations around the world. The field of strategic 
human-resource management (SHRM) focuses on 
the relationship between motivation and employee 
performance (Bae & Lawler, 2000).
The management of employee performance cen-
ters on the organizational gains created from extrin-
sic and intrinsic motivation. Employees vary in their 
inclination and ability to be satisfied from extrinsic 
and intrinsic motivation. Savvy human-resource 
managers match the motivation and reward to the 
employee’s temperament and disposition. Extrinsic 
motivation occurs when employees are able to satisfy 
their needs indirectly from rewards such as monetary 
compensation. Organizations that link employees’ 
monetary motivation to the goals and objectives of 
the organization are said to have achieved extrinsi-
cally motivated coordination. Intrinsic motivation 
occurs when an activity is undertaken for the sole 
purpose of satisfying one’s needs. Intrinsic motiva-
tion is self-sustaining and generated by commitment 
to work itself. Human-resource managers who wish 
to generate intrinsic motivation in employees will 
match employee intellect and abilities to appropri-
ately challenging and structured work opportunities.
Employee motivation must be managed in order to 
create the necessary and desirable balance between 
intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic moti-
vation, if not monitored and nurtured, risks being 
obscured and squashed by strong monitoring and 
incentives such as piece rates and bonuses. Complex 
jobs require intrinsic motivation to allow the creative 
and intellectual leaps that produce invention, inge-
nuity, and growth in organizations (Osterloh, 2003).
Human-resource managers shape the organi-
zational culture in ways that promote pro-social 
behavior by employees. They work to promote orga-
nizational citizenship behavior (OCB) as a means of 
facilitating organizational effectiveness. OCB, also 
known as pro-social organizational behavior (POB), 
refers to the helpful, cooperative behaviors that are 
not explicitly required of employees. Examples of 
pro-social behaviors in the workplace include assist-
ing new employees and self-limiting sick days. There 
are three key management issues related to OCB:

 Perceptions of fairness and trust in the workplace

 Norms of helpfulness and cooperation in the 
workplace

 Fair reward systems based on broad contributions. 
(Schneider, 1994)
In addition to the focus on employee motivation 
and pro-social behavior, HRM acknowledges and 
incorporates differences in employee values, ethics, 
and perceptions. In all fields and industries, HRM 
works within a given organizational set of values. 
Managers have the job of mediating the relationship 
between these organizational values and diverse and 
sometimes opposing employee values.
Information Management
Managers in all fields and industries are respon-
sible for information and knowledge management. 
What do managers do with company information or 
knowledge such as data, company history, produc-
tion processes, and financial reports? Information 
management, or knowledge management (KM), 
is a relatively new area of study about an age-old 
process and need. KM refers to the systematic and 
explicit management of vital information. The work 
of KM includes the creation, organization, diffu-
sion, and use of information within an organization. 
Knowledge sharing is vital to the operation of the 
self-directed work-group models that characterize 
many modern organizations.
Managers in modern organizations are increas-
ingly applying information technologies (IT) to the 
problems and challenges of KM. IT helps organiza-
tions create knowledge-management systems (KMS) 

Principles of Business: Management
Special Topics in Management
387
that structure information storage, use, and distribu-
tion within an organization. Organizational KMSes 
include elements such as data mining, learning tools, 
intranets, e-mail, telecommunication and video-con-
ferencing technologies, knowledge directories, deci-
sion support tools, expert systems, workflow systems, 
social network analysis tools, and knowledge codifica-
tion tools. KMSes create searchable digital storage to 
facilitate the retrieval and distribution of an organi-
zation’s information.
KM tools must be matched to the technological 
interests and abilities of the organization. The pri-
mary difficulty of using IT to create KMSes may be 
the multiplicity of knowledge. Much contemporary 
research in IT and KM focuses on developing a core 
set of KM tools for use across organizations, fields, 
and industries (Butler & Murphy, 2007).
Crisis Management
Organizational crises and vulnerabilities, such as 
extortion, hostile takeovers, product tampering, 
copyright infringement, security breaches, bribery, 
information sabotage, sexual harassment, plant 
explosions, counterfeiting, boycotts, or natural 
disasters that destroy production facilities, affect all 
types of organizations. An organizational crisis is an 
unlikely yet possible event that would threaten the 
viability of the organization. It is characterized by 
uncertainty of cause, effect, and method of solution 
as well as by the certainty that decisions must be made 
expeditiously to save the organization.
Organizational crisis management refers to an 
attempt by organizational members with external 
stakeholders to both avoid crises and effectively solve 
any crises that do happen. An organization’s crisis-
management framework or model for analyzing 
often includes the 4C frame of causes, consequences, 
caution, and coping:

 Causes: the immediate failures that triggered the 
crisis.
 Consequences: the immediate and long-term results.

 Caution: the procedures taken to avoid or curtail 
the impact of a possible crisis.

 Coping: the responding actions to a crisis that has 
happened.
Criteria for evaluating crisis-management effec-
tiveness centers on evaluating the perceptions of key 
stakeholders. The effectiveness of organizational 
crisis management is demonstrated when potential 
crises are averted or when the major stakeholders of 
an organization believe that the success outcomes of 
short-term impacts outweigh the failure outcomes. 
Crisis-management outcomes are often evaluated on 
a success-failure continuum based on the idea that all 
organizational crises result in degrees of success and 
failure.
The predominant trend in developing crisis-
management models for organizations is a multidis-
ciplinary approach that incorporates psychological, 
socio-political, and techno-structural perspectives. 
Multidisciplinary models of crisis management 
explicitly recognize the objective, subjective, and 
perceptual components of organizational crises 
and acknowledge the complexity of crisis outcomes 
(Pearson & Clair, 1998).
Issues Management
Managers in all fields and industries must handle 
ethical issues that arise in the workings of an orga-
nization. Issues managers are responsible for inte-
grating business decisions and ethical decisions. The 
field of issues management, which is based loosely on 
Emmanuel Kant’s (1724–1804) philosophy of ethics, 
refers to the “executive function of strategic public 
relations that deals with problem solving, organiza-
tional policy, long-range planning, and management 
strategy as well as communication of that strategy 
internally and externally” (Bowen, 2005). Strategies 
for handling ethical dilemmas in organizations 
involve the identification of issues, research, analy-
sis, and the creation of responsive organization-wide 
policies. Issues management provides a framework 
for analysis of ethical dilemmas and situations that 
arise in the workplace. Managers committed to ethi-
cal issues management operate with a working defini-
tion of Kantian concepts such as ethics, autonomy, 
principle of reversibility, duty, intention, respect for 
others, and symmetrical communication.
One of the main challenges of ethical issues manage-
ment involves the practical implementation of strategies 
and policies. Issues managers must match the degree of 
ethics formality to the style of organization. They may 
strengthen their ethical issues-management process by 
adopting a formal code of ethics for the organization 
and conducting issues-management meetings. Ethics 
statements articulate the values with which employees

should make work-related decisions. In addition to an 
ethics code, issues managers may work with employ-
ees to evaluate work-related decisions prior to making 
definitive and final decisions. This decision-making 
model is a less formal approach to ethical decision mak-
ing than an ethics code (Bowen, 2005).
CONCLUSION
The relevance of the special topics introduced in 
this article extends to managers in almost every 
field and industry. Managers who work in a variety 
of roles, such as operations managers, sales manag-
ers, financial managers, merchandising managers, 
management analysts, corporate planners, human-
resource managers, and small-business operators, 
have common challenges and similar concerns. What 
unites them is the need to handle and embrace orga-
nizational change. The economic climate is shifting. 
The competition created by the globalization of eco-
nomic markets challenges business organizations to 
produce rapid product innovation, cost efficiency, 
and increased customer responsiveness.
In response to new market demands, old models of 
hierarchical organizations are being replaced by new 
forms of organizations, such as self-managed teams, 
cross-functional teams, and self-directed work groups. 
These new team-based work groups are increasingly 
restructuring and distributing management respon-
sibilities, such as production schedules, budgeting, 
and problem solving, throughout the work group and 
organization. Examining special topics in manage-
ment that cut across industry differences and apply to 
all types of managers may provide a competitive advan-
tage for modern managers in the global marketplace.

Statistical Principles for Problem Solving
ABSTRACT
Problem solving and decision making are important 
aspects of running a business. One of the tools that 
can help in solving real world problems is statistics. 
Descriptive statistics include graphical techniques to 
organize and summarize data so that they are more 
easily comprehensible and simple processes to sum-
marize basic parameters of distributions. Inferential 
statistics helps decision makers solve problems in more 
complex situations and to draw conclusions about 
what the data signify rather than merely describing 
what they look like. Statistics can also be of help in 
business problem solving through the development 
of mathematical models. To meaningfully apply statis-
tics to real world data, the researcher needs to do two 
things: Control the situation so that the research is only 
measuring what it is supposed to measure and include 
as many of the relevant factors as possible so that the 
research fairly emulates the real world experience.
OVERVIEW
Just as in the rest of life, problem solving and decision 
making are important aspects of running a business. 
Changes in the economy, innovations by one’s com-
petitors, and new demands and expectations of the 
marketplace all mean that the organization needs to 
constantly adjust how it does business in order to stay 
competitive and gain or maintain its market share. 
For example, implementation of new technology 
to become more competitive may require an invest-
ment, and the savvy organization needs to determine 
whether or not the benefits of the investment will 
exceed its costs. Similarly, if a long-standing business 
process cannot keep up with expanding customer 
demands, management must determine whether 
to try to repair the existing process or develop and 
implement an entirely new one. If the engineering 
department proposes a new widget to be added to 
the product line, it must be determined whether or 
not potential customers are likely to buy the product 
as well as whether or not the addition will compete 
with the existing product line or enhance it.
Many times, decisions such as these are made 
subjectively based on the insights of experienced 
managers and other decision makers. This is not 
necessarily a bad idea: veteran managers can take 
advantage of years of experience to extrapolate 
trends in ways that are still not possible through the 
use of quantitative techniques alone. In addition, in 
some situations there may be insufficient data to use 
quantitative techniques, necessitating the use of qual-
itative forecasting methods. However, not every man-
ager or decision maker has the skills or experience to 
make such decisions unaided. In addition, real world 
problems are complex, and insightful managers use 
every tool at their command to make the best deci-
sions possible. One of these tools is statistics.
Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with 
the analysis and interpretation of data. Mathematical 
statistics provides the theoretical underpinnings 
for various applied statistical disciplines, including 
business statistics, in which data are analyzed to find 
answers to quantifiable questions. Applied statistics 
uses these techniques to solve real world problems. 
In general, there are two types of statistical tools:

 Descriptive statistics helps one describe and 
summarize data so that they can be more easily 
understood.

 Inferential statistics is used in the analysis and in-
terpretation of data to make inferences from the 
data and help in the processes of problem solving 
and decision making.
Descriptive Techniques: Graphing Techniques
Descriptive statistics helps describe data through 
graphical techniques that organize and summarize 
them so that they are more easily comprehensible. 
Descriptive statistics also include various processes to 
simply summarize basic parameters of distributions 
including various techniques to find the “average” 
or mathematically describe the shape of the distribu-
tion. There are many graphing techniques available.
Frequency Distribution
One of the most frequently used methods is the 
frequency distribution. In this type of graph, data 
are divided into intervals of typically equal length, 
thereby decreasing the number of data points on the 
graph and organizing the data to make them easier

to comprehend. Other types of graphing techniques 
used in descriptive statistics include histograms, 
Pareto diagrams, scatter plots, and graphs.
Histograms
Histograms are vertical bar charts that graph fre-
quencies of objects within various classes on the y axis 
against the classes on the x axis.
Pareto Diagrams
Pareto diagrams are vertical bar charts that graph 
the number and types of defects for a product or ser-
vice against the order of magnitude (from greatest to 
least). Pareto charts are often shown with cumulative 
percentage line graphs to more easily show the total 
percentage of errors accounted for by various defects.
Scatter Plots
Scatter plots graphically depict two-variable numeri-
cal data so that the relationship between the vari-
ables can be examined. For example, of one wanted 
to know the relationship between number of defects 
observed in a given month and the cost of the loss 
of quality to the company, these two values (number 
of defects and concomitant cost) could be graphed 
on a two-dimensional graph so that one could bet-
ter understand the relationship.
Examples of a histogram (with frequency distri-
bution), Pareto chart (with cumulative percentage 
line graph) and scatter plot are shown in Figure 1.
Descriptive Techniques: Central Tendency
In addition to graphing techniques, descriptive statis-
tics can be used to describe the central tendency and 
the variability of a sample. Measures of central tendency 
estimate the midpoint of a distribution. These mea-
sures include the median (the number in the middle 
of the distribution when the data points are arranged 
in order), the mode (the number occurring most often 
in the distribution), and the mean (a mathematically 
derived measure in which the sum of all data in the dis-
tribution is divided by the number of data points in the 
distribution). For example, as shown in Figure 2, for 
the distribution 2, 3, 3, 7, 9, 14, 17, the mode is 3 (there 
are two 3s in the distribution, but only one of each of 
the other numbers), the median is 7 (when the seven 
numbers in the distribution are arranged numerically, 
7 is the number that occurs in the middle), and the 
mean (or arithmetic mean) is 7.857 (the sum of the 
seven numbers is 55; 55 / 7 = 7.857).

Descriptive Techniques: Variability
In addition to measures of central tendency, descrip-
tive statistics include measures of variability that sum-
marize how widely dispersed the data are over the 
distribution. The first of these statistics is the range, 
which is the difference between the highest and low-
est scores. By knowing the range in addition to one 
of the measures of central tendency, one can better 
understand the data. For example, two distributions 
with a mean of 10 would be quite different if the 
range of one was between 1 and 100 and the range of 
the other was between 9 and 11. However, although 
the range does help one better understand the data, 
it is not a very refined statistic. To better understand 
the shape of the distribution, one can calculate the 
standard deviation. This is a mathematically derived 
index of the degree to which scores differ from the 
mean of the distribution and describes how far the 
typical score in a distribution is from the mean of 
the distribution. The standard deviation is obtained 
by determining the deviation of each score from the 
mean (i.e., subtracting the mean from the score), 
squaring the deviations (i.e., multiplying them by 
themselves), adding the squared deviations, and 
dividing this number by the total number of scores. 
The larger the standard deviation, the farther away it 
is from the midpoint of the distribution.
Shewhart Control Charts
These two types of descriptive statistics can be 
combined into a technique called Shewhart con-
trol charts that help quality control engineers and 
managers solve problems regarding quality of a 
product and whether or not a process is under 
control. An example of this kind of chart is the 
X-bar chart (so named for X¾, the mathematical 
symbol for the arithmetic mean). This is a chart 
of the means of some characteristic of the prod-
uct (e.g., acceptability of solder joints) of small 
random samples taken from the production 
line over time. As shown in Figure 3, the means 
are plotted over time on a chart that contains a 
center line (i.e., the mean for the process) and 
upper and lower control limits that are three 
standard deviations on either side of this line. 
X-bar charts help quality control engineers and 
managers determine where problem areas lie 
in a production process. If all the points plotted 
on the chart fall between the upper and lower 
control limits, the process is considered to be in 
control. However, if sample means fall outside the 
control limits, the process is considered to be out of 
control and the process is stopped so that an assign-
able cause can be determined. In addition to X-bar 
charts that keep track of processes by examining the 
means of samples, quality control charts include R 
charts that keep track of the range, p charts track the 
proportion of defective products, c charts track the 
number of defects, and s charts that examine sample 
variance.
Inferential Statistics
Although descriptive statistics are useful in helping 
one better understand data, inferential statistics help 
decision makers to problem solve based on data for 
more complex situations.
Inferential statistics helps decision makers to draw 
conclusions about what the data signify rather than 
merely describing what they look like. Through the 
use of inferential statistics, one can analyze various 
characteristics of a random sample to determine 
whether or not any observed differences are due to 
chance or because of a real difference in the sample 
from the population. Inferential statistics includes a 
wide range of tests of statistical significance to help 
solve problems and make decisions by estimating 
the degree to which it is probable that the observed 
results occurred by chance alone or are due to an 
experimental manipulation or other predetermined 
factor.

Correlation
Another frequently used statistical tool with real 
world applications is correlation. This tool allows one 
to determine the degree to which two events or vari-
ables are related. For example, a market researcher 
may want to know if people with greater disposable 
income are more likely to buy luxury items. The cor-
relation coefficient is the statistical method for deter-
mining this relationship. Correlation may be positive 
(i.e., as the value of one variable increases the value 
of the other variable increases), negative (i.e., as the 
value of one variable increases the value of the other 
variable decreases), or zero (i.e., the values of the 
two variables are unrelated). Correlation does not 
imply causation, however: Just because two variables 
are related does not mean that one caused the other. 
Both may be caused by a third, unknown factor.
Mathematical Models
Another way that statistics can be of help in busi-
ness problem solving is through the development 
of mathematical models. Regression is a statistical 
technique used to develop a mathematical model for 
use in predicting one variable from the knowledge of 
another variable. There are a number of regression 
techniques available for models to be used in prob-
lem solving ranging from simple linear regression to 
more advanced techniques that allow the analyst to 
use both multiple independent and dependent vari-
ables. No matter the technique, the resulting regres-
sion equation is a mathematical model of a real world 
situation. This can be invaluable for forecasting and 
learning more about the interaction of variables in 
the real world. The use of models is particularly help-
ful for problem solving in complex situations that 
cannot be solved intuitively. Models are very useful 
tools that create a representation that can be exam-
ined and manipulated to include relevant variables 
and relationships in the decision making process 
to reflect various alternate solutions to a problem. 
However, models need to be validated at each step 
and consequently adjusted as necessary and revali-
dated in order to optimize their use in decision mak-
ing. This process is illustrated in Figure 4.
APPLICATIONS
Inferential statistics allow one to problem solve by 
determining the answers to real world questions. The 
goal of research is to describe, explain, and predict 
behavior. For example, the marketing department 
may need solve the problem of which of two pro-
posed new company logos will be most memorable 
and will have the most positive image in the minds 
of prospective customers, or the engineering depart-
ment may need to determine which of two graphical 
user interfaces is more user friendly. Inferential sta-
tistics can help answer such questions.
Research Requirements
To solve these or other real world problems, the 
researcher needs to do two things: Control the situ-
ation so that the research is only measuring what it 
is supposed to measure and include as many of the 
relevant factors as possible so that the research fairly 
emulates the real world experience. As shown in 
Figure 5, in experimental research, a stimulus (e.g., 
a new graphical user interface) is presented to the 
research subjects (e.g., potential customers) and 
a response is observed and recorded (e.g., which 
interface they liked better). Researchers look at the 
independent variable (i.e., the stimulus or experi-
mental condition that is hypothesized to affect 
behavior — such as the type of graphical user 
interface) and the dependent variable (i.e., the 
observed effect on behavior caused by the inde-
pendent variable — such as the user’s response 
to the interfaces). However, real world problems 
are rarely this clean, and one must also consider 
extraneous variables — variables that affect the 
outcome of the experiment (i.e., whether or not 
the people questioned like the new interface) that 
have nothing to do with the independent vari-
able itself. For example, if a person is in a hurry 
to get somewhere else or has something else on 
(from Plane & Kochenberger, p. 14)

his or her mind, he or she may not give the alterna-
tive interfaces all the consideration that is needed 
to tell which is better. Although it is impossible to 
control for every possible extraneous variable, a 
well-designed experiment controls for as many of 
the extraneous variables as possible.
Laboratory Research
Laboratory research allows one the most control over 
variables. However, it often is far-removed from real 
life and the actual problems that need to be solved. 
Although controlling variables is important, it is just 
as important to conduct research in a setting as close 
to the real world as possible. For example, users will 
typically use a user interface in less than ideal condi-
tions, such as when they are tired or distracted, not 
just when they are at their best. In order to be able 
to extrapolate research results to the real world and 
have them be meaningful, it is important to design 
an experiment that not only controls extraneous vari-
ables, but is as realistic as possible.
Field Simulation & Experimentation
In addition to laboratory research, there are sev-
eral research techniques that can be used to inves-
tigate real world business problems. A more realistic 
approach to real world research is offered by simula-
tion. This technique allows the researcher to bring 
in more real world variables while still controlling 
many of the extraneous variables. For example, peo-
ple could be asked to do a set number of tasks with 
the new graphical user interface in an environment 
that simulates they way will actually would use it in 
the real world (e.g., while doing other tasks or being 
exposed to various distractions). Another approach 
to real world research is the field experiment in 
which people are given the product to try at work 
under the actual conditions in which they would use 
it. However, although this approach has the advan-
tage of being more realistic, it has the concomitant 
disadvantage of giving the researcher less control 
over extraneous variables.
Field Study & Survey Research
The laboratory experiment, field experiment, 
and simulation give the experimenter some con-
trol over the variables. However, it is not always 
possible to do research in such settings. There are 
other approaches to studying business problems 
that trade more realism for less control. One of 
these approaches is the field study. This approach 
examines how people behave in the real world. For 
example, if both interface designs are already on the 
market, the researcher could observe what type of 
people bought each design and use this informa-
tion to determine how to target the marketing of the 
product. The field study can also be combined with 
another research technique called survey research. 
Subjects could be interviewed by a member of 
the research team or asked to fill out a question-
naire regarding their preferences, reactions, hab-
its, or other questions of interest to the researcher. 
Although it is possible in theory to develop a very 
detailed research instrument that could be used to 
collect all the data that the researcher needed for 
analysis, in practice, such detailed instruments are 
often more lengthy than the potential research sub-
ject’s attention span. Survey research and interview 
techniques have the additional drawback of not 
being based on observation. Because of this fact, 
there is no way to know whether or not the subject 
is telling the truth for any number of reasons (e.g., 
s/he did not have much time to answer the ques-
tionnaire, was not really interested in helping in the 
research, did not like the company, wanted to please 
the researcher).

Team Management
ABSTRACT
This article will focus on the complexities of manag-
ing teams in today’s contemporary organizations. 
With organizations shifting from tall hierarchical 
functional structures to flatter team and network 
structures, managers are faced with some new chal-
lenges. These challenges include how to manage 
team types, team stages, communication strategies, 
and team leadership strategies and styles. The man-
ager is faced with juggling between advocating 
change and controlling/evaluating team perfor-
mance. It appears that the new manager should 
emphasize transformation rather than transaction 
when managing a team environment.
OVERVIEW
Role of Teams in Contemporary Organizations
Many environmental forces, such as information, 
technology, and new decision-making strategies, have 
caused organizations to move towards integrating 
employee work teams into their structural makeup. 
One such environmental force has been the shift 
from the industrial worker to the knowledge worker 
as a result of the information boom (Drucker, as 
cited in LaRue, Childs, & Larson, 2004). With the 
speed, availability, and accessibility of information, 
a need to share knowledge within organizations has 
been a prime driving force for creating an atmo-
sphere of teamwork. Technology advancements 
make it possible for social capital to be as strategically 
important to organizations as intellectual capital. 
Never in history has the technological infrastructure 
made it so easy to implement collaborative strategies 
such as cross-functional teams, self-managed teams, 
committees, and virtual work groups. The way deci-
sions are made transformed from a top management 
activity to a responsibility of all employees (LaRue et 
al., 2004). These forces, among others, have created 
a need for employees to work together, formally or 
informally, in order to share information and employ 
interdependency as a means for accomplishing orga-
nizational objectives. The use of teams, groups, com-
mittees, and other collaborative work structures are 
gaining in use as organizations attempt to adjust to 
these environmental changes. As such, leaders and 
managers must consider their approach to teams 
(their style, behaviors, strategies, role, and their dis-
position towards the team structure) as part of their 
leadership and management framework.
Team Formation Decision Factors for Managers
The decision to implement a team within the con-
fines of an organization should not be taken lightly. 
Creating work teams is an investment in people, 
time, energy, resources, and workspace. As such, the 
conditions that favor the creation of organizational 
teams should be well understood before making the 
risky leap into team implementation. Steps should 
be taken to ensure that the conditions are right; the 
decision to implement a team structure is often con-
sidered a crucial strategic decision.
Several conditions should exist before creating a 
team. First, a clear and concise team vision and mission 
should be defined and closely aligned with the overall 
organizational strategy (Caplan et al., 1992). Second, 
the business needs goals and objectives that are com-
plex and require high quality decisions (Pitman, 
1994). Third, the benefits of pooling knowledge must 
outweigh the efficiency lost because of group engage-
ment (MacNeil, 2003). Fourth, mutual commitment 
by those recruited to the team is possible and desired 
(Pitman, 1994). Fifth, the organization must have a 
trusting environment that allows for mutually effec-
tive collaboration between team members (Politis, 
2003). Finally, the team needs to have the full support 
from the management and leaders of the organization 
(Jones & Schilling, 2000). Organizational managers

and leaders need to engage in a research phase to 
ensure that these conditions exist. Otherwise, the 
organization may simply be setting the team up for 
subsequent and unanticipated failure.
Management & Leadership in Teams
In a team environment, an organizational manager/
leader should consider two things; (1) the type of 
team, and (2) the stage of development in which the 
team resides.
Team Type
Different team types include cross-functional teams, 
self-managed teams, virtual teams, task forces, com-
mittees, ad hoc groups, quality circles, and process 
improvement teams, among others. Managers should 
consider team type as part of their management style. 
For example, the management required for a cross-
functional product development team, for example, 
would likely be more directive than the leadership 
and management required for a virtual self-managed 
team, where the leadership roles are shared between 
the members. Using the wrong leadership or man-
agement behavior while interacting in a particular 
team type can be catastrophic — such as the man-
ager recruited to participate in a self-managed team 
who behaves in a directive and authoritarian man-
ner. Understanding the team stage is also important. 
Beck and Yeager (1996) described four team stages: 
team orientation, clarifying roles and responsibilities, 
doing the actual work or project, and solving prob-
lems. Depending on the stage that the team is in, the 
leader should be directing, delegating, empowering, 
or developing, or some combination thereof.
Team Stage
In addition to leadership/management behaviors 
and style, a manager’s communication strategy 
should also be based on team stage. The most widely 
recognized model for organizational team stages was 
developed by Tuckman (Kinicki, 2003), and consisted 
of five stages; (1) forming, (2)storming, (3) norming, 
(4) performing, and (5) adjourning. The forming 
stage is the initial break-in stage of the team mem-
bers. Members try to determine where they fit in, 
what the team focus is, and what their individual role 
will be. In the storming stage, the power within the 
group is ironed out, and individuals start to under-
stand what their roles and influences on the team 
will be. In the norming stage, teams begin to come 
together as a cohesive group. Cooperative group dis-
cussions replace bids for power. In the performing 
stage, the group has matured, and is operating in a 
tight-knit committed group that holds each other 
mutually accountable. The project goal becomes the 
main task at hand, rather than relationships and lead-
ership concerns. Once complete, the team adjourns, 
where an evaluation and “post mortem” analysis can 
often lead to the dismantling of the team.
Ranney and Deck (1995) developed a useful 
matrix for a communication strategy when leading 
teams — a strategy that is dependent on the team 
stage. Their examples included (1) being a coach 
and promoter in the forming stage, (2) being a 
coach, giving frequent feedback, reinforcing vision, 
and reviewing boundaries in the storming stage, (3) 
managing team membership and coaching in the 
performing stage, (4) being encouraging, recogniz-
ing achievement, and being supportive in the high 
performance stage, and (5) expressing appreciation 
in the completing stage. Successful management and 
leadership approaches often emphasize the impor-
tance of being conscious of team type and process 
stage in order to apply the most effective leadership/
management methodology.
Leadership Strengths & Weaknesses
A manager’s strengths and weaknesses should also 
be considered when managing teams. For example, 
a manager’s strengths might be his or her ability to be 
rational, pragmatic, logical, practical, and emotion-
ally stabile. His or her weaknesses might be a need for 
perfection, micromanaging, and lack of delegation. 
Strengths and weaknesses such as these take on an 
entirely new meaning when evaluating management 
and leadership from a team perspective. As such, 
there are additional considerations that should be 
modified and included in this plan.
Team Member Perspective
A manager who is pragmatic and focused on logic can 
easily conflict with a fellow team member’s style on a 
self-managed team. A team member who is creative, 
works at a quick pace and is outgoing, may have diffi-
culty with the aforementioned behavior. The manag-
er’s need for perfection might be an excellent style to 
use in a quality circle, but is likely very ineffective in 
a new product think tank. A manager should create a 

Team Management
Principles of Business: Management
398
process in which he or she is always conscious of the 
team type, team stage, and his or her own leadership 
strengths and weaknesses and how they match with 
the team needs.
Team Leader Perspective
Conger (1999) presented nine leadership styles that 
portray a convergence of three main leadership 
theories. The leadership dimensions were: Creating 
vision, providing inspiration, role modeling, intel-
lectual stimulation, meaning -making, appealing to 
higher-order needs, empowering, setting high expec-
tations, and fostering collective identity. These par-
ticular dimensions of leadership seem even more 
appropriate for the team environment. In particular, 
creating vision and fostering collective identity will be 
extremely beneficial to a team leader. In creating and 
implementing an organizational team, a clear and 
concise team vision and mission should be defined 
and closely aligned with the overall organizational 
strategy (Caplan et al., 1992). High performance 
teams require mutual commitment and account-
ability (Pitman, 1994). This will result in the desired 
collective identity. In addition, the other dimensions 
will also help lead a team, especially when creating 
change or transformation. The nine dimensions 
identified by Conger help team managers and lead-
ers determine their approach and style.
Leading Change within a Team
Using the wrong leadership style at the wrong 
time can be a roadblock to team success. Some 
research suggests that team leadership is one of the 
major reasons why teams fail within organizations 
(Katzenbach, as cited in Sivasubramaniam, Murry, 
Avolio, & Jung, 2002). Some researchers suggest 
that leaders use a style that was less transactional 
and more transformational (Kinicki, 2003), based 
on the leader-follower relationship. In the team con-
text, especially when driving change through a team 
effort, the leadership style and behaviors should 
emphasize the transformational leadership style as 
much as possible. Another word for change is to 
transform. This is the essence of transformational 
leadership — to drive continuous change through 
the organization. In a team environment, once the 
team has become familiar with their roles and mis-
sion, an effective team leader will focus on trans-
formational behavior, and only use transactional 
behavior when an adjustment to the team is 
required, or when the results are not acceptable.
Yukl opened that transformational leaders “for-
mulate a vision, develop a commitment to it among 
internal and external stakeholders, implement strat-
egies to accomplish the mission, and imbed the new 
values and assumptions in the culture of the organi-
zation” (as cited in Strang, 2005, p.76). Formulating 
the vision is the first and likely the most important 
step in driving change through the implementation 
of teams. Nanus (2003) described what vision is and 
what vision is not. He defined vision as a perspec-
tive that is appropriate for the organization, clarifies 
purpose and direction, sets standards of excellence, 
inspires enthusiasm and commitment, is easily artic-
ulated and understood, is different, and ambitious. 
He opined that vision was not a prophecy, not a mis-
sion, not factual, not true or false, not static and not a 
constraint. Kouzes and Posner (2003) discussed find-
ing your voice as a key leadership behavior in creating 
vision and inspiring and motivating others. Other 
research suggests that employing a transformational 
leadership style will result in a team that trusts leader 
judgment, comprehends their mission, supports 
team values, and has strong emotional ties (Avolio, 
Waldman, & Einstein, 1988). This certainly appears 
to be a formula for success in driving organizational 
change through teams, and is the framework that 
managers and leaders can embrace in creating an 
effective vision for leading change within a team.
Evaluation & Control
Performance evaluation is often considered a man-
agement function, rather than a leadership function. 
One of the major differences between management 
and leadership in Kotter’s (2001) model is that 
managers control and problem solve while leaders 
motivate and inspire. Evaluating performance and 
making adjustments to improve performance would 
seem to fall under the management function of con-
trolling. Popular management textbooks continue 
to emphasize controlling as a managerial function. 
However, part of the leadership construct in the team 
environment is to do exactly that—evaluate and con-
trol performance.
The element that links evaluation and con-
trol to leadership is trust. Bennis (1991) suggested 
that developing trust is one of the key ingredi-
ents for achieving personal growth in others. The 

Principles of Business: Management

team evaluation process builds this trust. Jones and 
Schilling (2000) stated, “The team-performance 
measurement process shows management the results 
of team performance, so management can trust that 
teams are doing the right things” (p.2). Even in self-
managed teams, evaluating performance is critical 
for maintaining the support of the management 
team, which is an important component to team 
success. Mintzberg opined that the leadership and 
management components of one’s job cannot be 
separated from a behavioral standpoint. The model 
suggested that leadership is simply a component of 
the management framework. In this context, there 
is little difference between team management and 
team leadership.
Managing Performance in Self-managed Virtual 
Teams
There are three main areas that relate to leadership 
performance in a self-managed virtual team. The 
first evaluation area relates to the type of leadership 
that the team uses within the virtual team environ-
ment. The second area relates to shared account-
ability for individual contributions and overall team 
results. The last area relates to the decision-making 
methods employed by the team to complete work 
assignments.
Management and leadership in a self-managed, 
self-directed, virtual learning team is quite different 
from the traditional management/leadership role in 
workplace teams. Traditional teams in the workplace 
had one leader/manager who would act as the direc-
tor, facilitator, coach, guide and conduit to the rest of 
the organization. Self-managed, self-directed, virtual 
learning teams are a “different animal.” In general, 
leadership is a shared responsibility in a self-man-
aged team. In a shared leadership environment, the 
first priority of team leadership is the task itself (Bell 
and Kozlowski, as cited in Carte, Chidambaram, & 
Becker, 2006). Carte, et al. (2006) posited that there 
are two primary modes of leadership in a self-man-
aged team environment. The first is expertise leader-
ship, where team members tend to adopt leadership 
roles in their areas of expertise. The second is collec-
tive participatory management. The study indicated 
that in addition to individual leadership that stems 
from respective expertise, the team members need 
to collectively move the team towards the goal in a 
participatory way.
Mutual Accountability
Part of the shared leadership in a self-managed virtual 
team is mutual accountability. Team members have 
the task of holding each other accountable for his or 
her role and expected deliverables and members are 
expected to manage any resulting conflict effectively 
within the team. In academia, for example, Hackman 
(1990) asserted that academic teams have the chal-
lenge of managing differing work styles and work 
pace. This team phenomenon leads to the team hav-
ing to “fit an indeterminate amount of work into a 
fixed amount of time” (Hackman, 1990, p.110). One 
effective way to manage this challenge in a virtual 
self-managed team is to hold each other accountable 
for individual tasks and expected content, timely sub-
mission of individual contributions, and involvement 
in the integration of individual ideas into a team 
product. High expectations of accountability in this 
team environment leads to each member trying to 
go above and beyond expectations in order to please 
and support their fellow team members.
Decision-Making
One of the major challenges that a self-managed team 
faces is the desire by team members to have an envi-
ronment of conformity, consensus, and cohesiveness. 
As such, oftentimes self-managed teams find them-
selves engaged in the phenomenon of groupthink 
(Kinicki, 2003), where team members make decisions 
that they do not believe in, simply to be agreeable 
and pleasing to others on the team. The team might 
also engage in making satisficing decisions, where 
team members agree to decisions that satisfy a prob-
lem need without evaluating all the alternatives from 
which the best solution or decision may evolve. Part of 
the shared leadership in a self-managed virtual team 
is to ensure that the team consciously engages in con-
structive decision-making methods.
Creating an environment for effective decision-
making is essential for the success of self-managed 
virtual teams. Manz and Neck (1995) created a deci-
sion-making model that can prevent groupthink and 
satisficing decision-making called Teamthink. The 
model presented 8 steps in the decision-making pro-
cess. These included: “encouragement of divergent 
views, open expression of concerns/ideas, awareness 
of limitations/threats, recognition of each member’s 
unique value, recognition of views outside of the group, 
discussion of collective doubts, adoption/utilization 

Team Management
Principles of Business: Management
400
of non-stereotypical views, and recognition of ethical 
and moral consequences of decisions” (Manz, et al. 
1995, p.7). An effective self-managed team will adopt 
these behaviors and expectations. During the brain-
storming, each team member should be encouraged 
to provide critical input regarding approach, content, 
and project interpretation. All team members should 
accept constructive criticism gracefully and should 
be open to new ideas that conflict with their own 
beliefs and assumptions. One area that can proactively 
improve the process is to actually formalize these steps. 
Such an approach might make sense if the team were 
to remain together for a long time — more than just a 
few weeks.
APPLICATION
The discussion concerning team management and 
leadership revolved around four areas. First, an acute 
understanding of team type and team stage has a 
direct impact on the leadership style, behaviors, and 
communication strategies that one should employ in 
a team environment, both as a team manager/leader 
and as a team participant. Second, the manager 
should consider development areas that relate to his 
or her strengths and weaknesses and how these fit 
within an organizational team. Third, it would seem 
that the mix of transformational and transactional 
leadership behaviors needs to emphasize transfor-
mational leadership in a team environment, more so 
than in a traditional leader/constituent relationship. 
Finally, a new paradigm emerges; one in which the 
leadership falls under the management umbrella, 
rather than a separate entity. This paradigm shift was 
the result of analysis regarding how evaluation and 
control of team performance is critical to team suc-
cess and critical to developing organizational trust.
As organizations have moved from employing a 
traditional mechanistic form into a more modern 
and contemporary form, formal organizational hier-
archies and centralized decision-making structures 
have been replaced by hybrid, matrix and network 
forms that include the incorporation of high perfor-
mance work teams. Modern day managers and lead-
ers need to be prepared to understand the nature 
of teams, including when to implement teams, how 
to set teams up for success, and how to make teams 
integrated as an organizational cultural norm. The 
author of this paper presented ideas to facilitate the 
understanding of managing teams, including orga-
nizational context, framework and processes. Team 
creation and implementation within an organiza-
tion is complex, as there are social, behavioral and 
process dynamics. The discussion helps the reader 
understand this complexity, making the decision to 
implement a team less risky.

Teams & Team Building
ABSTRACT
Increasingly, teams are the foundation of the 21st 
century workplace. The philosophy behind this wide-
spread use of teams is that their use can create an 
environment in which synergy is achieved and the 
final outcome is greater than that which would have 
been achieved by individuals alone. Team develop-
ment comprises several stages. However, this process 
is not always linear, and teams may experience multi-
ple stages simultaneously or revert to previous stages. 
Team building efforts conducted by an outside party 
can help teams acquire the knowledge, skills, and abil-
ities necessary for functional teamwork and achieving 
synergy, and to avoid pitfalls of team situations such 
as group-think. Team building efforts usually focus 
on defining the roles of team members, setting team 
goals, problem solving, and interpersonal processes.
OVERVIEW
Groups vs. Teams
At one time or another, most people in the twenty-first-
century workplace will find themselves working as part 
of a team. Teams in an organizational setting can be 
as simple as two people working together to write a 
white paper or technical document or as complex as 
multiple businesses working together to bid a proposal 
or build the next-generation destroyer for the navy. 
However, not every group of people who work 
together can be considered a team. In general, groups 
in the workplace comprise two or more individuals 
who are interdependent and who interact over time. 
So, for example, the sales staff of a retail store might 
be considered a group. They interact with each other, 
ask each other for help (e.g., ring up a customer, find 
an item in stock or inventory), and support each other 
in accomplishing the tasks necessary for running a 
successful retail store. Groups work toward a common 
goal, are accountable to a manager, and may (ideally) 
accomplish their goals. Leadership of a group is held 
by a single individual. However, groups do not have a 
clear, stable culture, so conflict may be frequent.
Teams, on the other hand, are a special type of 
group. In a team, there is a differentiation of skills 
where one individual does a specific part of the task 
and other individuals do other specific parts of the 
task. Another way teams are differentiated from 
groups is that the members of a team perform their 
work in the context of a common fate. For example, 
although the members of the retail staff may help 
each other in the context of doing their jobs, they 
also all tend to do the same job. For the most part, 
dealing with one salesperson in a retail store should 
be the same as dealing with another person in the 
retail store. Further, members of a sales group typi-
cally do not share a common fate. For example, 

Principles of Business: Management
Teams & Team Building
403
if Harvey does not do his job adequately, it will be 
Harvey—and not the rest of the sales staff—who will 
be reprimanded or fired.
On the other hand, some sales and marketing 
staffs are truly teams where there is differentiation of 
skill among the team members. For example, when 
trying to sell a learning management system for a 
computer-based training system, one member of the 
marketing team may specialize in comparing the 
business’s system with that of the competition, while 
another team member might specialize in answering 
technical questions regarding the programmability 
of the system. If the remuneration of the team mem-
bers is based in part on commission for making the 
sale, then the fate of the individual members of the 
team depends on the fate of the team as a whole (i.e., 
whether or not they sell the system). Leadership of a 
team is shared, and members are mutually account-
able to each other. Because of these team charac-
teristics, team members are committed to the goal 
and mission of the team, trust each other, and have 
a more collaborative culture than groups in general. 
As a result, teamwork often leads to a situation of syn-
ergy (Nahavandi, 2000).
Types of Teams
In general, four types of teams can be found in the 
workplace:

 Manager-led teams,

 Self-managing teams,

 Self-designing teams, and

 Self-governing teams (Hackman, 1987).
In manager-led teams, the design of the organiza-
tional context, the design of the team as a perform-
ing unit, and the monitoring and managing of the 
performance processes of the team is all a responsi-
bility of the team manager. In self-managing teams, 
the design of the organizational context in which 
the team works as well as the design of the group as 
a performing unit are both done by management. 
However, the self-managing team not only executes 
the task, but also monitors and manages the perfor-
mance processes used in the performance of the task. 
In a self-designing team, the organizational context 
in which the team operates is designed by manage-
ment. However, all other aspects of the team func-
tioning (i.e., design of the group as a performing 
unit, monitoring and managing of performance pro-
cesses, and executing the task) are the responsibility 
of the team. In self-governing teams, all aspects of the 
team -- including its design within the context of the 
organization -- are the responsibility of the team.
Further Insights
Team Development
Although organizations sometimes act as though 
teams can be created by fiat, team development 
is in fact a multistage process (Robbins, 1996). As 
illustrated in Figure 1, before a team is formed, it is 
a collection of individual entities. They may be part 
of a group (e.g., a sales staff), or they may not even 
know each other (e.g., individuals from two or more 
business who will write a proposal together). Once it 
is decided that a team will be formed (Stage 1), the 
team members still have a great deal of uncertainty 
concerning the nature of the team such as its mission 
and purpose, the capabilities of the other team mem-
bers, what processes will best result in synergy, and 
the leadership of the team. During the forming stage 
of team development, members of the team try to 
determine the answers to these and other questions. 
Members learn to know each other better, determine 
each other’s areas of expertise and experience, and 
try to determine what types of behavior is acceptable 
within the group. The forming stage is completed 
once the members no longer consider themselves to

be a random collection of individuals, but as part of 
a team.
According to this theory, the second stage in team 
development is storming. This is often a stage of con-
flict within the team as members struggle with the 
constraints placed on them as individuals. For exam-
ple, every semester, a teacher requires her students 
to do a team research project. Within these broad 
parameters, they are allowed to divide the tasks of the 
group in any way they want, are able to establish indi-
vidual or team leadership, and, in general, perform 
the tasks of the team in whatever way they determine 
will best allow them to develop a project that will earn 
them a good grade. Every semester, at least one of 
these teams rebels and announces unequivocally that 
it is unfair to require them to depend on each other 
for a grade on the project. However, since satisfac-
tory completion of the project is necessary to pass the 
course, these teams must use their conflict manage-
ment skills in order to come to some level of mutual 
understanding about the leadership hierarchy within 
the group. This situation mimics that of the real-
world workplace in which team members must learn 
to relinquish some of their individuality in favor of 
the potential that can be gained through teamwork 
and establish an acceptable leadership hierarchy in 
order to accomplish its tasks.
During the norming stage, the team develops 
norms—standards or patterns of behavior that are 
accepted as normal within the team—so that the 
team can accomplish its tasks. During this stage of 
team development, the team members bond with 
each other within the context of the team and its tasks 
and become a cohesive team. Another characteristic 
of this stage of team development is the development 
and assimilation of a set of common assumptions and 
expectations about what defines acceptable behavior 
within the group. For example, a project team in one 
class might decide that all members are expected to 
complete and submit their portion of the project on 
time according to a mutually agreed upon schedule 
and that each of the members is responsible for writ-
ing a specific part of the final report. In the work-
place, a team may make similar arrangements for the 
development of a technical document or proposal.
The fourth stage of team development is perform-
ing. By this phase, the members of a functional team 
will have learned to know each other (forming), 
worked through the initial conflicts (storming), and 
determined how the team will operate (norming). It 
is time for the team to actually do the work for which 
it was brought together: conduct the research proj-
ect, write the proposal, build a working model, etc. In 
some cases, teams are set up on a permanent basis to 
perform a certain kind of task. For example, an engi-
neering team might be established to develop proto-
types of new products. After the completion of one 
prototype, the team is then assigned to develop the 
prototype for another product. For such permanent 
teams, team development ends at this point.
However, a great many teams are established on 
a temporary basis. Once the project (or the class) 
is over, members (or students) are unlikely to con-
tinue to work together on other projects. Similarly, 
in the workplace, there are temporary teams such as 
Red Teams, task forces, and temporary committees. 
When the work of such teams has been accomplished, 
they move into the final stage of team development: 
adjourning. The team no longer needs to focus on 
accomplishing its task and, instead, focuses on the 
tasks necessary to wrap up the project and disband 
the group (e.g., final reports, distribution of prod-
ucts). As the work of the team winds down, the bonds 
between the members dissolve as the team disbands 
and members go back to other activities that do not 
involve the entire team. At this point, the team mem-
bers once again become unassociated individuals.
Team Building
Although there is always the potential for teams to be 
dysfunctional and produce a lower-quality outcome 
than an individual, the concept of synergy result-
ing from teamwork is an attractive one, and many 
organizations use teams in order to foster this syn-
ergy and produce a superior outcome. Similarly, it 
is virtually impossible for many single organizations 
to be successful in meeting the needs of large con-
tracts (e.g., development of a new destroyer), so the 
establishment of functional teams is essential. The 
question, then, becomes how to best help a team to 
work together harmoniously while reducing the like-
lihood of group-think and increasing the likelihood 
of synergy.
Team building is the process of turning a group 
of individuals who work together from a collection 
of individuals doing related tasks to a cohesive unit 
where the efforts of the team members act synergisti-
cally to yield results that could not have been done 

Principles of Business: Management
Teams & Team Building
405
by the individuals alone. Typically, team-building 
efforts focus on defining the roles of team mem-
bers, setting goals for the team, problem solving, and 
interpersonal processes (McShane & Von Glinow, 
2003). Team building often comprises such activi-
ties as physical exercises that force team members to 
depend on each other in order to achieve a desired 
goal, communication exercises to teach team mem-
bers to be better communicators, and small group 
sessions in which team members get to know each 
other in a nonthreatening situation.
Knowledge, Skills & Abilities (KSA)
Team-building efforts can take the form of many 
different types of activities targeted toward helping 
team members to manage conflict, avoid groupthink, 
and become synergistic. Although the methods used 
may differ, in general there are certain interpersonal 
and self-management knowledge, skills, and abilities 
(KSAs) that need to be present in a team -- or taught 
through team building -- that can help achieve these 
goals. According to Stevens & Campion (1994), from 
an interpersonal perspective, team members need 
to have strong conflict management KSAs, collab-
orative problem-solving KSAs, and communication 
KSAs. For conflict management, team members need 
“to be able to recognize and encourage desirable, 
but discourage undesirable, team conflict.” In addi-
tion, team members need to be able “to recognize 
the type and source of conflict confronting the team 
and to implement an appropriate conflict resolution 
strategy.” Finally, team members need to be able to 
“employ an integrative (win-win) negotiation strat-
egy rather than the traditional distributive (win-lose) 
strategy” (Stevens & Campion, 1994, p. 505).
In addition to conflict management KSAs, team 
members also need the KSAs to collaboratively solve 
problems in order for the team to be functional. 
Specifically, team members need to be able to iden-
tify situations requiring “participative group problem 
solving and to utilize the proper degree and type of 
participation” (p. 505) and recognize the obstacles to 
collaborative group problem solving and implement 
appropriate corrective actions.
Further, team members need the KSAs neces-
sary for clear communication. This means that team 
members need to be able to understand commu-
nication networks and to utilize decentralized net-
works to enhance communication where possible; 
communicate openly and supportively (i.e., send 
messages that are behavior- or event-oriented, con-
gruent, validating, conjunctive, and owned); listen 
nonjudgmentally and appropriately use active lis-
tening techniques; maximize consonance between 
nonverbal and verbal messages; recognize and inter-
pret the nonverbal messages of others; and engage 
in ritual greetings and small talk, with a recognition 
of their importance (Stevens & Campion, 1994, p. 
505).
High functioning teams need to not only possess 
the interpersonal KSAs discussed above, but must 
also have the appropriate KSAs for self-management 
of the team. Specifically, team members need to be 
able to set goals and manage performance within the 
team. KSAs necessary for this aspect of team func-
tionality include the KSAs to help establish specific, 
challenging, and accepted team goals and to moni-
tor, evaluate, and provide feedback on both overall 
team performance and individual team member 
performance. In addition, team members need to 
possess the KSAs to plan and coordinate the tasks of 
the team. These include the abilities to “synchronize 
activities, information, and task interdependencies 
between team members and to help establish task 
and role expectations of individual team members, 
and to ensure proper balancing of workload in the 
team” (Stevens & Campion, 1994).
VIEWPOINTS
The five-stage model of team development described 
by Robbins has been popular since the 1960s. 
However, although it does describe the general pro-
gression of team development, it does so at a simplis-
tic level. For example, it is unlikely that all conflict 
will be permanently resolved at the conclusion of the 
storming stage. In fact, many experts believe that con-
flict is necessary to accomplish the synergy desired 
from teamwork. Otherwise, a situation of groupthink 
can arise in which group members tend to have the 
same opinion as each other in order avoid conflict, 
reduce interpersonal pressure, or maintain an illu-
sion of unity or cohesiveness without thoroughly 
thinking through the problem. This condition works 
against the process of good decision making and can 
result in a poorer product from a group effort rather 
than the synergy desired from teamwork. Similarly, 
the five-stage model presents team development as a

406
linear process, proceeding neatly from one stage to 
another. In actuality, many teams return to previous 
stages or even exist in multiple stages at the same time 
(e.g., storming and performing simultaneously).
For most of us, teams are a reality of the twenty-
first-century workplace. The goal of teams is typically 
to develop a physical, written, or conceptual product 
that is better than that which any one individual could 
have developed alone. However, the development of 
a functional team takes work and each team must go 
through several stages before it becomes optimally 
functional. External team-building efforts can help 
teams become more functional, avoid potential pit-
falls such as groupthink, and work together synergisti-
cally to produce a better product. Research continues 
into the dynamics and performance of teams and 
other groups, with companies and other organiza-
tions continually looking for ways to improve team-
work and therefore overall efficiency, productivity, 
and satisfaction. For example, psychological tests may 
be used to evaluate employees or contractors in an 
effort to identify the best members for an ideal team.

Types of Business Organizations
ABSTRACT
This article will focus on different forms of business. 
There are a number of ways to structure a business—
these include sole proprietorships, different types of 
partnerships, limited liability companies, and cor-
porations. Each form of business organization has 
advantages and disadvantages and these are largely 
influenced by the purpose of the enterprise as well as 
a number of other factors. Each type of organization 
poses different legal ramifications and income tax 
considerations. This article will provide an analysis 
of the different types of business organization as well 
as a brief discussion of the advantages and disadvan-
tages of each structure.
OVERVIEW
There are a number of ways to structure a business, 
and the factors involved in choosing the appropri-
ate legal structure include: the purpose of the orga-
nization; the size of the entity; the costs involved in 
starting the entity; state, federal and local laws and 
rules governing the business; and tax considerations. 
Essentially, there are four types of legal structures for 
business:

 Sole Proprietorship

 Partnership

 Limited Liability Company

 Corporation
There are advantages and disadvantages to each 
type of business organization and these are driven by 
a number of factors. The following is an analysis of 
the four legal structures.
Sole Proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is the most basic business form 
and is frequently utilized by a single person owning or 
running a business on his or her own. Such business 
enterprises are often run from the person’s home. 
Owners pay taxes on the business profits and this is 
reflected on individual tax returns (Form 1040 and 
Schedules C and E). In some states, the costs of a busi-
ness that is being operated from an individual’s home 
may be deducted from income taxes. However, at the 
same time, certain counties and states may require a 
sole proprietor to pay property taxes on the value of 
any office equipment used for the business. In addi-
tion to tax liabilities, sole proprietors are also respon-
sible for the debts of the business (Butow 2004).
Partnership
A partnership is the legal structure for a business 
enterprise when two or more people start a busi-
ness. There are different types of partnerships, and 
these include general partnerships, limited partner-
ships and limited liability partnerships. In order to 
set forth how the business will operate, the partners 
should enter into a partnership agreement. The part-
nership agreement should specify who the partners 
are, what their roles and responsibilities are, and 
most importantly spell out how the profits will be 
divided between or among the partners.
A general partnership is a business structure where 
each partner is liable beyond what he or she has 
invested in the enterprise. Also, each partner can take

actions that may bind the entire partnership. A general 
partnership is not a taxable entity because the income 
and losses pass to each partner who, in turn, reports 
the profit and loss on individual tax returns. Because 
the income and losses pass to each partner, these enti-
ties are also referred to as “pass-through” enterprises. 
In a general partnership, the profits and losses are 
normally distributed equally between or among the 
partners. At the same time, each partner is jointly and 
severally liable for all the obligations of the partnership. 
That means a person suing the partnership can choose 
to collect from any partner and does not have to collect 
an equal amount from each partner. (Rianda, 2011).
On the other hand, a limited partnership (LP) 
is one where two or more partners agree to oper-
ate a business jointly. In this structure, each part-
ner is liable only to the extent of the amount each 
has invested in the business. This entity is also pass-
through enterprise. A limited partnership can also 
include both general and limited partners. In these 
cases, the general partners usually are responsible for 
running the operations of the business while the lim-
ited partners are essentially investors. Further, each 
partner shares the profits and losses according to the 
partnership agreement (Butow 2004).
Another type of partnership is a limited liability 
partnership or LLP. These structures are normally 
used by professional organizations such as law firms 
and accounting companies. An LLP has similar 
features to a partnership, but the partnership as a 
business entity is responsible for any debts and the 
individual partners are shielded from these liabilities. 
Some US states also recognize limited liability limited 
partnerships (LLLPs), which mix features of limited 
partnerships and limited liability partnerships.
Limited Liability Companies (LLC)
A limited liability company is a cross between a cor-
poration and a partnership. This type of business 
organization offers more protection from creditors’ 
claims than a partnership. In this way, it is similar to 
a corporation, but it is also a pass-through entity so it 
shares the features of a partnership. However, LLCs 
have distinct features and requirements. In an LLC, 
the owners are called members. Members, in turn, 
can be individuals or corporations. However, unlike 
a partnership where profits and losses are evenly dis-
tributed according to the partnership agreement, 
there is greater flexibility in this regard for a limited 
liability company.
Further, in order to establish an LLC, it is neces-
sary to file articles of organization with the secretary 
of state. Another way that LLCs are similar to partner-
ships is that a limited liability company is required to 
have an operating agreement. The operating agree-
ment should specify who the members are, what the 
role and responsibility of each member will be and 
how profits will be shared between or among the 
members. The operating agreement should also con-
template changes in ownership if other members are 
invited to join the enterprise or if an existing mem-
ber decides to sell his or her interest. Finally, because 
this is also a pass-through structure, members report 
income and losses on personal income tax returns.
Some states require that certain types of profes-
sionals that provide special types of services, such as 
doctors, lawyers, or architects, do not form normal 
LLCs; this ensures that their liability for their ser-
vices is not limited in way that could potentially harm 
consumers. Instead, these professionals may register 
as a professional limited liability company (PLLC), 
which restricts the limitations on liability to business 
matters.
Corporations
A corporation is essentially an entity that exists sep-
arate and apart from its owners. Corporations are 
required to have at least one owner, and owners 
are called shareholders or stockholders; ownership 
interests are referred to as stock. Because a corpora-
tion exists separate and apart from the owners, the 
owners are protected from debts and liabilities. The 
corporation itself assumes liability for the debts and 
obligations of the business, putting aside the issue of 
personal guarantees (Rianda, 2011).
A corporation is established when articles of incor-
poration are filed with the secretary of state. This 
document establishes the reason for the enterprise 
and in some states it is referred to as a certificate of 
incorporation or a company’s charter. The articles 
should clearly state the business purpose, but at the 
same time that description should also allow the busi-
ness flexibility to grow and evolve. The basic infor-
mation that should be stated in the articles includes 
the business’ name and address, the name of the 
incorporators, the intended duration of the business

entity (either perpetual or of limited duration) and 
the purpose of the business (Arend 1999).
An incorporator is the responsible individual for 
filing the articles with the secretary of state. In many 
states, the incorporator cannot be an owner, officer 
or director of the business entity. A legal agent is a 
third party who is not affiliated with the business 
entity who will be responsible for accepting any legal 
process papers filed against the business. A legal 
agent can be a law firm, but there are also profes-
sional organizations that perform these duties.
Corporations are also required to have written by-
laws. This is the governing document of the business 
and it establishes the operating procedures for the 
entity. By-laws describe the management structure 
and what the roles and responsibilities of the officers 
and directors will be. Generally, directors are senior 
executives or managers who are responsible for the 
day-to-day operations of the business while officers 
are the individuals appointed to implement the 
policies and procedures established by the directors. 
Officers report to the directors who are ultimately 
accountable to the owners, that is, the shareholders. 
By-laws should also specify the voting procedures, 
notice requirements, proxy, and the minimum num-
ber of people who must be present for a vote to be 
effective—this is referred to as a quorum.
Corporations are required to have an annual 
meeting, but meetings can also be held once every 
quarter, once a month, or at any time an action is 
taken that affects the operations of the business. 
Such action includes mergers, establishing new busi-
ness ventures and promoting or terminating officers 
and directors. Minutes, or a written record of the 
meeting, must be prepared and the actions taken 
during these meetings are often memorialized in a 
written resolution. Resolutions, minutes and notices 
are required to be maintained with the company’s 
books and records along with the articles of incorpo-
ration and by-laws.
There are two types of corporations: “C” corpora-
tions and “S” corporations. The former refers to a 
business that meets the minimum requirements for 
the definition of a corporation established by the 
Internal Revenue Service tax code while the latter is 
a designation for a business that is established pur-
suant to subchapter “S” of the code. A subchapter 
“S” designation allows a business to be taxed like a 
partnership where the profits and losses are passed 
through to the shareholders. At the same time, own-
ers are provided with protection from debt liability. 
Finally to qualify as an “S” corporation there must be 
one or more, but fewer than seventy-five owners.
On the other hand, a “C” corporation does not 
have a limit to the number of owners; however, these 
businesses are not pass-through entities and the 
corporation’s profits are taxed. Because of this, “C” 
corporations are subject to what has been termed 
“double taxation.” In addition to the profits being 
taxed, shareholders are taxed on the dividends that 
are paid on the stock that they own. Further, share-
holders are also taxed on any profits they receive on 
shares of stock that they sell. This is known as a capi-
tal gains tax. Corporations are required to pay sala-
ries to the directors, officers and employees, who are 
also required to pay taxes on that income (Barney 
1997). Finally, unlike pass-through entities, C corpo-
rations do not separately state income or loss items. 
These are instead taken together to arrive at total tax-
able income, with the same tax rates applying to ordi-
nary income and capital gains. Since income does 
not retain its original character in a corporation, 
many of the benefits available at the individual level 
are unavailable when the corporate form is chosen 
(Wong & Zambrano, 2012).
Corporations may also be subdivided, combined, 
and controlled in various ways. Holding companies 
are often formed as the owner of a corporation’s 
stock in order to reduce ownership risk. Corporations 
may merge into one larger entity, sometimes requir-
ing government approval due to antitrust measures. 
Corporations may also be considered conglomerates, 
in that they own and run many smaller, often seem-
ingly unrelated businesses.
APPLICATIONS
The type of legal structure that is appropriate for 
individuals starting a business depends on a number 
of factors. The following is a comparative analysis of 
the advantages and disadvantages of each form of 
business organization.
The most basic form of business, the sole propri-
etorship, is the best option for a single owner of a 
business. These entities are relatively easy to estab-
lish since they do not require extensive documents 
to be filed. At the same time, some states require 
certain business enterprises to be licensed. This

includes, but is not limited to, electricians, plumbers, 
home-improvement contractors, real estate brokers, 
mortgage brokers, financial planners and even hair-
dressers. Some of the advantages of a sole proprietor-
ship are that individuals can start these businesses 
without significant initial costs. Further, taxes are not 
paid by the business, but rather by the owner, and 
any profits are reported on individual tax returns. 
Therefore there is no need for extensive financial 
statements to be prepared.
The main disadvantage to this form of business 
organization is that the individual is responsible for 
any debts incurred by the business as well as other 
legal claims that can be initiated in the courts. This 
is especially relevant if the sole proprietor is a home-
owner or owns other residential property. If the 
individual running the business does not pay debts 
or if a lawsuit is commenced against the business, a 
judgment can subsequently attach these debts to the 
person’s dwelling. In short, a sole proprietor exposes 
their real property and other assets to debt and legal 
liabilities.
Another form of business organization that has 
been discussed is the partnership. This legal structure 
is frequently used by family businesses. Other than 
the possible licensing requirements, there is no need 
for extensive documentation and filings. Moreover, 
the profits of the business are not taxed since these 
are passed through to the individual partners. One 
disadvantage to this type of legal structure is that 
each partner is subject to a certain amount of liability 
for debts. Further, unless the partnership agreement 
states what should occur in the event of the death of 
a partner, partnerships do not provide for continuity 
of life. So if one of the partners dies, the partnership 
agreement may need to be renegotiated, and the 
surviving partner can find him- or herself doing busi-
ness with people who were not originally part of the 
business.
A hybrid of partnerships and corporations is what 
is commonly known as a limited liability company, 
and this type of business draws on the advantages 
of partnerships and corporations. The main advan-
tage is that the operating agreement can establish a 
flexible means for the members to share the profits 
and losses. Some of the factors in making this deter-
mination include the financial investment of each 
member as well as his or her role and responsibili-
ties. Like a corporation, members of limited liability 
companies are protected from debts. Thus members 
can protect their assets from claims arising from 
creditors or lawsuits. However, this legal structure 
does not provide the flexibility that is available to a 
corporation with respect to arranging for financing 
the business operations.
Finally, there are a number of advantages for 
establishing a corporation. An “S” corporation is 
probably the best option for a business with one 
owner or where few people are involved in the busi-
ness. The main benefit is that the profits are not 
subject to double taxation. More importantly, an “S” 
corporation enables owners to protect their private 
property and other assets. This designation is well 
suited for a small business, and as stated above, is only 
available to business entities that have seventy-five or 
fewer owners. A “C” corporation has a great deal of 
flexibility to finance its operations. Corporations can 
sell more stock, issue debt, and obtain lines of credit 
from a variety of financial institutions. Another ben-
efit of such corporations is that they provide conti-
nuity of life. This means that the business entity will 
continue in the event of the death of an owner or if 
an owner decides to sell his or her ownership interest 
(Barney 1997).
As mentioned above, however, the main disad-
vantage of a corporate structure is that the entity is 
subject to double taxation. At the same time, corpo-
rations have a number of means at their disposal to 
mitigate tax consequences. Many of the expenses 
associated with running the business can be deducted 
from income taxes, and an array of financial and 
accounting mechanisms enable corporations to 
mitigate tax liabilities. Further, many states offer cor-
porations tax relief in order to attract these entities 
to do business in the state. If a corporation is large, 
generates sufficient revenue, and offers employment 
opportunities to a number of people, such incentives 
ultimately benefit a state’s economy. Oklahoma, for 
example, offers a tax incentive that exempts hori-
zontally drilled oil and gas wells from the state’s 7% 
production tax for a limited period of time (Watts, 
2013).
Another way for a corporation to mitigate its tax 
liability is to incorporate in a state in which it is not 
actually located. For instance, many Fortune 500 
companies incorporate in the state of Delaware. 
This is so because this state has procedures in place 
that enable business entities to establish themselves

quickly. Further, Delaware does not tax the profits of 
the corporation if business is not actually conducted 
in the state (Vinzant 1999). Such states, or even other 
countries, with favorable tax laws that attract many 
businesses are often referred to as corporate havens. 
Some regulators see these and other tax loopholes as 
unfair, however, and some jurisdictions have penal-
ties for businesses that seek to exploit them.
CONCLUSION
In the final analysis, the type of legal structure busi-
ness people choose depends on a number of vari-
ables that have been discussed herein. There are 
numerous legal and tax implications to consider, as 
well as federal, state and local laws that may apply 
to a particular business. This is an important point 
because some types of business are subject to a great 
deal of oversight. Moreover, for corporations that 
are also publicly traded entities, that is, a company 
whose shares of stock are bought and sold on one of 
the stock exchanges or other trading outlet, there are 
substantial financial and reporting requirements that 
stem from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Further if 
deficiencies are discovered in a corporation’s finan-
cial statements, the business and the responsible 
individuals (chief executives and the like) are subject 
to felony prosecution.
Another matter to consider is the potential for law-
suits. Sole proprietors who fail to fulfill their obliga-
tions in a business transaction expose themselves to 
legal actions and if the person suing them prevails, 
the business person’s real property and other assets 
will not be protected. In this regard, business enter-
prises can also be exposed to product liability law-
suits. A partnership or small business that makes toys 
for children, for example, can be sued if those toys 
cause harm or injury to a consumer. While the own-
ers of corporations can protect their real property 
and assets from such legal claims, large corporations 
that generate a lot of profit are invariably the targets 
of class action lawsuits — and whether or not these 
lawsuits have merit, such legal actions can be costly.
Ultimately, the appropriate form of business 
organization depends on the purpose of the busi-
ness, the number of people who will have an owner-
ship interest, the amount of profit or revenue that 
will be generated, and finally the number of people 
that the business will employ. At the end of the day, 
the final factor that needs to be considered is that 
any type of business consists of people and the suc-
cess of the enterprise will be significantly affected 
by the roles and responsibilities of these individu-
als, and the relationships that they create. In short, 
business people should carefully consider all of 
these variables and, moreover, rely on the advice of 
financial advisers and legal counsel. In this regard, 
the matters discussed in this article are for informa-
tional purposes only and should not be construed as 
financial or legal advice.

GLOSSARY 
360-Degree Feedback: An approach to giving em­
ployees feed­back on their job performance in which 
representatives of the major groups working with a 
person provide feedback on his or her performance. 
In 360-degree feedback, employees receive feedback 
not only from their supervisors, as in the traditional 
per­formance-appraisal paradigm, but also from 
their subordinates, coworkers, customers, and other 
groups with whom they work.
3PL Management: The process of choosing and man­
aging relationships between the firm and any third-
party logistics man­agement providers.
5G Workplace: This is a shorthand phrase referring 
to the fact that the labor force has members of five 
different generations working side by side: tradition­
alists, baby boomers, generation X, generation Y, and 
generation Z.
Accommodation: An approach to conflict management 
in which one party completely gives in to the position 
of the other party or acts with little or no attention to 
its own interests. Accommo­dation can be a functional 
conflict management approach if the opposing party 
has substantially more power or if the issue is not as im­
portant to the first party as it is to the opposing party.
Acquisition: The process in which one company pur­
chases another and incorporates its human and cap­
ital resources.
Active Listening: An approach to improving com­

based man­agement tool used in management 
accounting.
Actuarial Science: Branch of knowledge dealing with

important that we look at Administrative law, since 
Administrative agencies create rules, regulations, 
orders, and act as the primary interpreters and en­
forcers of business regulatory schemes.
Affective Organizational Commitment: Affective 
organizational commitment is the degree to which 
a member of the organization is dedicated to the 
organization’s success, not just at an intel­lectual 
or practical level, but also at an emotional level. 
Studies suggest that leaders who use an inclusive 
leadership style tend to produce higher levels of 
affective organizational commitment among their 
followers.
Alliance: A contractual grouping together of people 
or entities based on some common interest in which 
all parties will invest. A strategic alliance is a business 
collaboration that satisfies some strategic goal of the

Avoidance: An approach to conflict management in 
which the parties attempt to manage their differences 
by smoothing them over or avoiding or minimizing 
the situations in which conflict might arise. Although 
avoidance is not a functional long-term solution to

a way to temporarily cool down heated disputes or for 
situations where the issue causing conflict is trivial. 
Avoidance approaches are low in both assertiveness 
and cooperativeness.
Baby Boomers: Baby Boomers are members of the 
generation born between 1946 and approximately 
1964. When soldiers returned home from World War 
II, they were anxious to get mar­ried and start a family,

mutual gain through problem solving, both parties 
have equal power, and there are time pressures to 
settle the conflict.
