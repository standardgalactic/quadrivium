An evil force of monster machines has risen to conquer the Galaxy.
One by one the peaceful races of the Galaxy have been
enslaved by the Cyborg Monsters, No race has the str
against the power of the Cyborgs. One lone rebel rises
the ranks of the mechanised monsters. Part dragon. part mac
the Cyborg Warrior ﬁghts back against the tyrant masters. The
Galaxy has a Hero. Hope returns to the hearts of the people at
the rise of the armoured champion they call "ST IN<A( ;ON'.
f haven't seen a decent shoot-em-up for ages (in fact Silliwomt
wag probably the last). Now this looks set to end with a product
from the very same Silkworm programmers that could
challenge the mighty R-Type itself!'

one place where the Russians
could be, and that was on thehill

COLOURg a me sreviews.A n d n o t o n lythatb u t TWO free
cassettes full of EIGHT complete games and loads of COLOUR throughout
the rest of the magazine. But if we fade back into the realms of seriousness
for one brief nanosecond I think you'll agree that this issue of YC is a little
different from the rest. ITS A WHOPPER!
So how did this incredible change come about? This is a rough
description of what happened...
I was twiddling my thumbs one day when I suddenly realised that YC
would be even more rad, even more bodacious, if it had even more colour. So
I trotted into the publisher's ofﬁce and said "I want more colour NOW!"
When I came round, I picked myself off the ﬂoor outside the said ofﬁce
and went to Woolys and bought a packet of crayons. When the mag came in
the ofﬁce I stayed awake for a couple of weeks, drinking loads of cans of
coke and tonnes of tea, and coloured in all the mono pages, and most of the
screenshots.
Now I'm going to go to bed to sleep for a year, and if anybody disturbs me
they'll be very sorry!
Zzzzzzzz Z z z z z z z z  Z z z z z z z z  ( " W a k e  up! Wake up! WAKE UPI" -
The readers!)
Oh erm, sorry, before I go I'd better explain that next issue will have a
completely free comic with it, called YOINKS COMIC, and it features strips
about Post Apocalypse, Flame Head, Cedric The Barbarian (before his recent
demise) and a few other Ye favourites. And also that January's YC is the new
look, bigger magazine than ever before! See ya in thirty (years)...

And so the CES passed for yet another year.
And Rik was the poor sucker that suffered
the onslaught of the bubble gum brigade. He
managed to stay conscious long enough to
bring us this report...
M
in i Millwall
supporters on
drugs was how I
ﬁrst described the crowds
at Earls court, and there
were so many that on
Saturday afternoon the
doors were forcibly closed
and around ﬁve thousand
of them were turned away,
heaven only knows what
it'd been like if they were
let in too. Apart from this
slightly marring fact, and
that the ﬂoor-space this
year was obviously a lot
more restricted (it was tiny,
mate) a lot of juicy games
were on show, and all the
coin-ops were on free play.
Read on for a few snippets
from the best stands, and
details on the games to be
released up until
Christmas and beyond.
OCEAN
The Stand
Possibly the weakest
stand they've ever had. A
few arcade machines
scattered around, and a
couple of employees
ﬂinging carrier bags into
the crowd. There was no
new tangled munchy bits,
just a long wall with a
couple of video screens
and a wacking great piccy
of Robocop. hurrn... not
very impressive but the
kids still ﬂocked around it
like wasps around a jam
jar.
The Games
October
Plotting - According to the
blurb this is an obscure
puzzle game (where have
we heard THAT before?),
but no guy honest, its
ﬂaming
obssscccuuurrrreee!!!
You've got this ﬂuffy helper
(who said ''ooer"? Come
on, own up!) who, well
helps really. This is 'cause
these blocks come pouring
down in formation from the
top of the screen and you
must eliminate them by
hitting each one with a
block of the same peculiar
type. Simple? Not on your
nelly, if you want to know
more go check out your
local arcade, it's been a
coin-op for a while. Also
it'll be one of the ﬁrst
games being released on
CMGS cartridge only.
( See review in this issue!)
The Nightbreed -
Based on the Clive Barker
directed ﬁlm that has been
put back from release
since last October (the
ﬁlm, not the game) and
unfortunately only adults
can see it because it's a
little on the gory side.
Expect the game to be
much of the same. ( Also
reviewed in this issue!)
Total Recall - Another
ﬁlm licence of another
gory movie that only adults
could see. This'un will be
very gory as you play the
part of Arnie as he travels
to Mars to ﬁnd his real
identity.
Special Criminal
Investigation (Chase HO II)
- Much the same as the
ﬁrst coin-op, Chase HQ II
though has big munchy
weaponry to allow you to
shoot at the other cars as
well as ramming them.
Expect it to be nigh-on
perfect as it's being
programmed by Probe.
Also on cartridge only!
November
NARC - And another
arcade licence, this time
set in the depraved world
of hard drugs (nope they're
not smarties), expect this
to be HUGE!!!
Puzznic - Another
puzzle game and another
coin-op conversion. There
are more blocks to be
manoeuvred and more
ATA SPECIAL
quick thinking is to be had
here.( See review!)
Robocop 2 - The biggie!!!
And one of the tips for
Christmas no. 1. You are
Robocop again and you
must do your thang
against another Robocop
(a nasty baddy Robocop).
Cartridge only.
December
Toki - This is a very
Japanese style cutesy
arcade machine that is
once again due to
be converted to
the commie 64.
There are wacking
great end-of-level
meanies to be
destroyed too.
Cartridge only.
Pang - Yep it's
an arcade licence,
and yep it's cute.
You have a
harpoon and you
must shoot

1
1
balloons, hurrn... And
guess what? it's cartridge
only!
To Be Announced
Navy S.E.A.L.S. - Based on
the ﬁlm of the same name
with Charlie (Platoon)
Sheen and Michael (Aliens)
Biehn. As the heroes you
have to enter the Middle
East, kill loads of nasty
people and come home
again, just the sort of fun
that you'd want
cartridge only.( Previewed
in 'Thangs to Come!)
on
ACTIVISION
The Stand
Erm... Er... Didn't really
have a stand, just a luverly
suite where journos could
go and scoff sandwiches.
The Games
October
Atomic Robokid - Go and
read the review, we ll
wait...
November
Dragon Breed - An arcade
conversion of the !rem hit.
You ﬂy along sitting on top
of a huge dragon and you
smeg just about
everything, and it's even
got end-of-level monsters.
(See preview)
Early /99/
Beastbusters - Truly the
most violent and bad taste
coin-op of them all, and
now it s to be converted to
the commie 64. A bit like
Op Wolf, but you wander
around killing zombies and
other assorted undead,
and boy do they explode
when you shoot them.
R-Type II Y e h ,  it had
to come didn't it? A-Type
was so successful that the
sequel is to follow just
Over two years
later. It's got even
more chunky bits
too.
STORM
The Stand
Again Storm didn't really
have a stand, but their
suite was easier to ﬁnd.
The Games
October
Saint Dragon - The ﬁrst
product to be released on
The Sales Curve's own
label, and what a stonker it
is too. Five levels of shoot-
em-up action that has
even more to offer than R-
Type, and is smoother too.
( Reviewed this issue!)
November
SWIV - NOT Silkworm 4,
but ﬂipping close! This
time the action is vertically
scrolling but you still have
a jeep and a helicopter to
control. The action is fast,
fast, FAST! Expect it to be
a winner. (See preview)
Early 1991
Rod-Land - More cutesy
characters,
aaarrrgggghhhhIll A coin-
op game that offers
simultaneous two-player
action, and that can't be
bad.
Big Run - A conversion
of the excellent driving
arcade machine (driving as
in "It drives us round the
bend, mate") that proved
so popular 6 months back.
Double Dragon III: The
Sacred Stones - Expect
this to be the ﬁrst Double
Dragon game that is any
good.
Solar Jetman - The
hero of those ancient
classics Jetpac and Luna
Jetman is back.
Asylum - Described as
a top view three player
interactive heavy metal
fantasy action adventure
coin-op, hurm...
Brute Force - Beat-em-
to-bits action in a big city
aptly titled 'Big City!
VIRGIN
The Stand
This was right near the
escalator, and dead brill it
was too. All the games
were on show, and
available for the public to
play, and there was a
wicked thumping beat
blaring from a few
camouﬂaged speakers.
There were loads of

goodies being given away
too, such as Sega bubble
gum and posters, what a
laugh eh?
The Games
October
Super Off Road Racer -
Otherwise known as Ivan
'Ironman' Stewart's Super
Off Road Racer. This was a
humungous arcade hit,
and I used to spend so
much money on it (that's
'cause I was no good). It's
a bit like Super Sprint with
dirt and mucky bits.
Judge Dredd - Based
on the immensely popular
comic strip hero (anti-
hero?) of the same name,
and has you patrolling the
streets of Mega City One,
keeping crime levels down
and wasting those fatties,
Monty Python -
Reviewed a couple of
issues ago, remember???
November
Golden Axe - A truly
awesome arcade
conversion of one of the
best slice in d ice  games
ever. Again coded by
Probe.
Early 1991
Viz - Paaarpp!! This is the
big one (ooer!). You can
play Johnny Fartpants,
Buster Gonad or Biffa
Bacon in this game based
on the best comic ever,
yoinks!
Spot - All we know is
that it's puzzly, its
addictive, and it's not
about acne, hmmm...
Supremacy - Already
available on the 16-bits.
This is one big, big, BIG
strategy game, that is
again coded by Probe
(they don'alf get about
don't they!)
DOMARK
The Stand
One of the better stands. It
had a great cave effect
(some people calling it a
grotto) and was covered in
excellent Tengen arcade
machines, all on free play.
It was also one of the rare
stands that was selling it's
back product too.
The Games
October
The Spy Who Loved Me -
The Bond game that has
been promised for so long
is ﬁnally upon us. It should
be a tad like Licence To
Kill but tonnes better.
Wheels Of Fire - A
compilation of the three
top driving games last year
and one that has never
been released before.
Chase HQ, Turbo Outrun,
and Power Drift were all in
the Christmas charts last
year, and Hard Drivin'
ﬁnally makes it onto the
C64.
November
Wings Of Fury - The
Broderbund game where
you, in your Hellcat plane,
can bomb little Japanese
huts and strafe the little
blighters as they come
running out. Great
animation here!
Badlands - Super
Sprint with weaponry and
munchy bits. A conversion
of the Tengen coin-op.
V
S.TU.N. Runner - Also
a Tengen coin-op, in the
Hard Drivin' vein (ie. it's
got vector ﬁlled graphics),
bit of a wet ﬁsh in the
arcade but promises to be
an accurate version,
Early 1991
3D Construction Kit - You
too can design your own
Freescape games with this
construction kit. It allows
you to do things that even
the games using it in the
past couldn't do.
Mid 1991
Skull And Crossbones -
Pirate inspired Tengen
coin-op fun in a hack in'
slash game for two
players.
Hydra - Another Tengen
game, and this'un is a
water based driving game,
is roughly the same mould
as Chase HQ, 'cept with
hoverboats.
Thunder Jaws - A
moist-em-up as you shoot
loads of things that reside
underwater. And surprise
surprise, it's a Tengen
coin-op.
R.B.I. 2 - A baseball
sim, and that's all you
need to know.
GREMLIN
The Stand
A cool stand indeed. Made
even more cool due to the
fact that they had the
Lotus Esprit Turbo
Challenge Challenge (if
you get what I mean). This
meant that two people at
any one time could race
against each other whilst
Sean Kelly (Ye contributor,
and Gremlin employee)
hurled abuse at them in his
own special way. The top
time of the day won £50.
The Games
October
Lotus Esprit Turbo
Challenge - A racing game
with smooth graphics and
split screen two player
action.
10 Pack - An ultra cool
compilation of TEN games,
read them and weep...
Butcher Hill, Footballer of
the Year II, Gary Lineker's
Hot Shot, Side Arms,
Street Fighter, Super
Scramble, HA TE ., Road
Runner, Dark Fusion, and

Skate Crazy!
November
Supercars -
More Super
Sprint style
gameplay, but on
a larger scale and
tonnes more fun.
Switchblade -
Arcade style
slash-em-up, with a little
bit of weapon collecting on
the side.
IVERRORSOFT
The Stand
TURTLES, that's the
catchphrase for Mirrorsoft.
Turtles and lots of them,
apart from that there were
games on display and
Jonathan Ross presenting
the company's
promotional video.
The Games
November
Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles - Cowabunga!
Need I say more?
Early 199/
Predator 2 - Based on the
ﬁlm that is the sequel to
one of my favourite ﬁlms
ever so I think I'll leave it
there.
Back To The Future III -
This has got to be better
than II, its based in the
wild west, based on the
movie, and guess what?
Its being coded by Probe
(my God those boys'll
drop)!
US GOLD
The Stand
Very, very, VERY big!!! Not
a Ferrari in sight, just a
wacking great
Lambourgini, and loads of
grafﬁti art everywhere.
Tonnes of arcade
machines all on free play,
and there was even a
grafﬁti art demonstration
to announce US Gold's
latest licence.
The Games
October
Dragonstrike (SSI) -
Dragon-em-up as you ﬂy a
dragon and breath your
deadly phlegm over the
nestles.
Buck Rogers (SSI) -
Biddy biddy biddy, it's
Buck and his chums in a
Role-Playing Game that is
based on a Role-Playing
Game.
November
Platinum - A truly
wicked compilation
containing Ghouls and
Ghosts, Strider, Forgotten
Worlds, and Black Tiger
(which has never been
released on C64 before).
Strider II - Sequel to
the excellent original game
that was so good that
Capcom have decided to
make it into an arcade
machine. This'll be a coin-
op too.
ESWAT - Elite Special
Weapons And Tactics is
what it stands for, and
superior mashing is what it
offers. A coin-op
conversion naturally. (See
preview!)
Line Of Fire - Based on
the ever popular Op Wolf
style arcade machine, as
you just shoot, kill or maim
everything in your way.
ACCOLADE
The Stand
A humble but exciting
stand. Everything on show
was on the PC (as
Accolade are moving into
that area) but the games
were great. An enormous
picture of king of the
mama, Elvira, was draped
along the back, proudly
displaying that Accolade
had won the licence. And
the video of Elvira the ﬁlm
was playing for those who
were too tired to move on.
The Games
October
Accolade In Action -
Another of those Accolade
compilations (although I
thought they should have
called it 'All-Time Big
Stonky Ones') this time
featuring Grand Prix
Circuit, Fast Break, 4th
and Inches, and Blue
Angels.
November
Star Control - A strategy
cum shoot-em-up cum 3D
doofer, in space. A little for
everyone.
December
Stratego - Based on the
ancient MB games
boardgame that gets
everybody arguing and
usually ends up with the
dog wandering off with the
pieces in it s gob and my
sister having the board
forcibly rammed down her
throat.
ET FaURONIC
ZOO
The Stand
In the corner of the stand
was a dummy holding a
ball and standing on a
plastic base. At one point
Stewart Bell (erstwhile MD
of the company) decided
to stand on the base too
and dummy, ball, base and
Stewart all decided to go
their separate ways, a real
source of mirth and
entertainment.
The Game
October
Subbuteo - Erm... This is
just about the only release
on the C64 for some time,
but it's ﬁnger ﬂicking good
(groan)! (

least your objective is pretty clear,
destroy absolutely everything that
gets in your way!!! Even the extra
weapon pods need to be smegged
before you can build up your arsenal
(which is strange 'cause George
Graham managed it with E5.50 and a

The aim is to ﬁght to the end of
the level, but not in typical
horizontally scrolling fashion (well,
not all the time anyway). There is a
bit of exploring to be done for you to
ﬁnd the right route too, but without
the blasting it'd be a pretty boring
game. There's small enemy robots to
frag, big robots to frag and gigantic
robots to frag, and at the end of
every three levels there's a screen

But apart from the frantic
gameplay and the many varied
sprites, it is the graphics that are
mega impressive. In the arcade the

in their detail and colours. Uncannily
the commie 64 version does the job

whilst not detering too much from

available for use (some of
which are very impressive

doesn't take too much away
from the intensity of the
play.

CRIBBAGE
MASTER
It's time to roll out the green baize,
because your C64 is waiting to
challenge you at Cribbage. I am sure
most readers are familiar with at
least the basic rules of Cribbage (I'm
not - Ed), but for the complete
novice here's a short introduction to
get you started.
A Brief Introduction
Cribbage is a card game played
either between two players or four.
playing as two pairs. The program
does not support the doubles
version, so this complication can be
Ignored. The object of the game is to
score 121 points before your
opponent. Traditionally the score is
indicated on a pegboard, but if you
ﬁnd this confusing, the computer
also shows the score in digital
format.
You can score points in two ways:
1. Scoring combinations in your
hand
2. Du rin g  pegging
Before looking in detail at the scoring
of points, we will look at the format
of a game. At the start two players
cut for deal. The Ace counts as a low
card and the player who cuts the
highest card deals ﬁrst. The dealer
then deals a hand of six cards to
both players. Each player examines
his hand to try to calculate the
highest score which can be achieved
with any four of the cards and the
other two are discarded. The four
discarded cards form a third hand
called the 'box', which becomes the
second hand of the dealer. When

both players have discarded, the
non-dealer cuts the pack and the top
card is turned face up. This will be
used later with the cards in the
hands, but if it is a Jack the dealer
scores 2 points. This is termed "2 for
his heels".
The next stage of the game is the
pegging. The players take it in turn to
lay cards starting with the non-
dealer. Points can be scored during
pegging as follows:
* I f  the total sum of the points of all
cards played = 15 (all picture
cards count 10), the player who
played the last card scores 2
points.
* I f  the last two or more cards
played have the same rank, the
player who played the last card
scores 2 points for each pair (eg.
three eights = 6 points).
* I f  the last n cards are
consecutive, the player who
played the last card scores n
points (n being a constant).
* I f  the total sum of points of all
cards played = 31, the player who
played the last card scores 2
points.
This process continues until the total
reaches 31 o r no player holds a card
which can increase the current total
without exceeding 31. When 31 is
not reached the last player to lay a
card scores 1 point, the cards are
then turned face down and the
process continues until both players
have played all their cards.
This probably sounds rather
confusing (probably? - Ed), but the
program won't let you make illegal
plays and you should soon get the
hang of it.

ORSITAL
You are trapped inside a base on an
abstract world known as 'Orsitar.
Your objective is to escape this
unfriendly environment.
You start at the base exit (that
seems logical) which must be
unlocked by collecting the numbers
1 to 9. These numbers are scattered
about the base in no particular
order.
Once you have collected all nine
numbers, you make your way back
to the exit which will now be
opened, enabling you to escape to
the outside world. This is not easy
feat, because the numbers must be
collected in ascending order. It is
advisable to search out and locate
just where the numbers are, before
you start collecting them.
Control is quite simple. Plug a

Big place, the galaxy. But not big

It's all summed up in
Semionovich's First law, a
sociological corollary of the famous
Lorentz-Fitzgerald equations.
Semionovich broadly stated that,
just as it is completely unfeasible to
achieve the speed of light within the
constraints of normal space-time, it
is similarly impossible for any
intelligent lifeform to attain the point
at which it is satisﬁed with its supply
of resources and living space.
Of course, just as the Lorentz-
Fitzgerald equations were
overthrown by Grace's
Hypergeometry Theory in 2243, so
Semionovich may yet be disproved.
Tell it to the Space Marines. Our
job, as an unbiased multi-racial
peacekeeping force is to keep those
lifeforms who insist on obeying the
Semionovich dictums in line (the

Now you too can sample the

FORTRESS
The object of the game is to guide
your hypercraft through the enemy
fortresses (6 in all) and reach the
teleport at the end of each.
Whilst ﬂying through the fortress
there are some obstacles which have
to be eliminated. To do this, ﬁre your
laser at the blocks which will then
disappear.
There are also several small gaps
which your ship must manoeuvre
through without touching any of the
side walls, as this will make the
fortress unstable, resulting in the
demise of your ship and crew.
An extra ship will be gained on
the third level, and if all 6 are
completed the speed at which the
fortress moves is doubled, making
your task a heck of a lot harder!!! The

This starts the game. Throughout the
game, the computer converses with
you through a variety of noises. The
ﬁrst one you will hear is like a
gunshot, and it precedes every game.
It is asking who is going to move ﬁrst,
player 1 or player 2 (decided by
pressing 1 or 2). The other gameplay
noises are...
Ping - Player i s  turn.
Twang - Player 2's turn.
Seven Pings, each one lower than
the last - The computer is thinking.
SURROUND
Surround is inspired by that early
19th century English game, 'Reversi'.
The game is played on a normal
chess board, and each player has 32
counters or discs. Normally black
and white are used, although they
can be any two colours. The object
of the game is to capture as many of
your opponents pieces as possible.
Ultimately, you want to gain control
of all the squares on the board. The
game starts off with the four centre
squares being covered by 2
white pieces and 2 black
pieces, at
diagnols to

If you forget whose turn it is, press
the spacebar to hear the noise again.

have chosen (shown in the blue bar
just above the columns). Pressing F8
will abort the current game in
progress.
If you play against the computer,
which is not hard to beat, you will
notice that it can take some time for it
to make a move. To speed this up
considerably use a C128 in 64 mode.

You use a joystick

Don't these
things drag on.
Oh ho ho, very
punny... Rik looks at the
latest game with Dragon in
the title.
S
before! Sounds more like
something BBC weathermen
ignore than a label for excellent
computer games, but a label it is and
excellent software it produces. Does
this sound a little pompous? Tough,
I've seen St Dragon and you haven't,
so there (tongue out, and rasping
sound caused by vibration of said
organ).
But does the world need yet
another 'collect the icons' style of
shooty? Probably not, but it doesn't
do any harm does it? I mean, while
not everybody can boast that they've
completed 'Psycho Ninja Space
Ships From Hell' some games get
rather stale when your stuck on a
certain point, so it's better to
progress onto something else for a
while. And St dragon is the best bet
for doing so at the moment.
Why? It's cooler than an Eskimo's
toilet ring (have you ever sat down
on a toilet when it's cold? Think what
an Eskimo has to go through) and
faster than Ben Johnson's chemist. It
also offers a little more than the
average with the addition of a tail to
the main body of your craft (more on
this later).
Another similarity this game has
to countless others in the genre is a
plot that sounds like something
George Lucas may have written on a
bog roll the day after a savage
Vindaloo. The races of the galaxy
(yawn!) have been enslaved by an
evil force of Cyborg monsters,
cunningly called The Cyborg

is the only part of the body that can

monsters in other
games. For
instance, at the
end of the ﬁrst level
is a giant bull (with a
touch of BSE) that once
the head has been shot off
will continue to spout laser
ﬁre in a more vigorous manner.
And although St Dragon doesn't
offer THAT much that's new, it offers
much more than most counterparts
and concentrates on quality as well
as quantity. And it's from the same
programming team as Silkworm,
Ninja Warriors, and quite a few other
arcade licences that emulated the
coin-op counterparts very
adequately. St 'Dragon was one of
the better arcade machines in the
past and the commie version is just

Dragons are big mythological
creatures that have scaley green
skin and breath ﬁre. It is also
rumoured that they used to rule the
country with a reign of terror. Any

killing a dragon, so they named
many pubs after him. It is very
doubtful that there'll ever be any
pubs named 'Nell Kinnock'.

gameplay slows down
when there are tons of
sprites on the same
screen, but it copes
admirably most of the
time, and when it does it
can be VERY fast! The
action is all there and so

Breed, and ﬁnally kill 'The Mask' in
the ﬁnal battle, when you have
transformed into one of the Breed

This is done on three levels, each
containing loads of locations, all of
which must be mapped before you
can really do much. And although
that's about it, it'll take you

In some ways the piece of software
is better than the movie.
It keeps your interest for a longer
period, and would not turn your
stomach as much in the gory stakes.
The graphics can sometimes be a
little too garish, and not macabre
enough for my liking, but the
intensity of the puzzles makes this a
grade a game for those who don't
mind staying awake all night, nay

Renegade Ill - Much the same as the other Renegade games.
Encore
Airwolf Again! Ancient arcade adventure/shoot-em-up that still cuts it.
Bombjack - Again. Superb arcade conversion that other magazines gave an
undeserving hard time.
Frank Bruno's World Championship Boxing - Good old Frank, ain't he a card
eh?
Kixx
Outrun - Classic racing game that did far too well at full-price for its quality.
California Games - Probably the greatest of the Epyx games series.
Tiger Road - Good arcade conversion with tonnes of noodles.
Delta - One of the best shoot-em-ups ever, honest!
Oue-Dex - Absolutely, stonkingly, fantabulously, excellent think-ern-up!
Zeppelin
Arcade Trivia - Aaargh! Not another triv' game surely?
Edd The Duck - Cute Rainbow Islands style platform game featuring that
squeaky toy from the Beeb.
Cuemasters Team Snooker - What can I say? A snooker garnet
Kenny Dalglish Soccer Manager - Average management game that doesn't
live up to its sponsor.
G.T.I.
The Manager - A soccer management game that offers
more than the norm.
Erm, thanks to lack of space and
absolutely tonnes of budget of games
released this month, the reviews are tad
shorter than normal. Ho well, on with the
show...

I know Op Wulf when I see
it, and this is undoubtedly
Op Wulf in every respect.
They've
not even tried to
disguise it, and even the
title is a dead giveaway
isn't it?
Mind you, it's a very good
Operation Wulf clone but
that still doesn't say much
because I thought that the
original sucked! If you've
been out of the country for
a very long time, Operation
Wulf and Operation Hanoi 21

scrolls horizontally while
enemies (who are spraying
lead everywhere) run onto
the screen and you must
mow them down using a
sight controlled by joystick,
and that is essentially it.
The joystick control is too
sluggish and the game is
mediocre!

RASTAN S K O R E  73
The Hit
Squad E2.99
A rerelease and one of the
poorest that The Hit Squad
has in its library, but that
said it's not THAT bad.
It's a scrolly hack-em-up
kind of arcade adventure,
with very little adventuring
to be done. You've got to
make
your way towards Karg, a
wicked geezer who has
opened a portal which has
spewed loads of baddies
into the land and therefore
blocking your path to get to
him. So that's it, stroll,
smeg, stroll, smeg!
The graphics are pretty poor
to be fair, and the gameplay,
although monotonous is
based on an arcade
machine that was just as
monotonous, so we can't
blame the programmer for
that. An okay game that
would be more attractive at
a pound cheaper.

This is another of those

that you're meant to get a
friend round for and see if
you can bet on the nice
horsies. Unfortunately I've
yet to come across one of
them on budget that makes
me want to
so, and this is no
exception, although G.T.I.
do make an attempt.
The most annoying thing
about Classic Punter is the
lack of options, if there

It was also all too easy to

This would be okay if you

otherwise it's probably

This'un was reviewed as
part of the Heroes
compilation last issue, and
that was as scathing as I'd
like to be. The game is
based on the arcade
version of the ﬁlm, and
although I spent many many
days in my misspent youth
recording high-scores on it,
the commie 64 version is a
bit too slow for my liking.
This doesn't mean that it's
any easier, or that the
graphics are any worse
(they are nigh-on identical)
but the speed of the game
reﬂects very badly on the
playability, and it has a very
high yawn factor.
At a budget price it is
probably worth the dosh,
and for somebody who's
looking for the 3D varied
gameplay that it offers
C2.99's not too much to pay.
BARBARIAN II
Kixx E 2 . 9 9
Also part of the Heroes
compilation
and was undoubtedly the
highlight of that affair.
For those that were
comatose last month and
missed the review I shall
recap. Barbarian ll is
absolutely brilliant. It's a
hack-em-to-bits with some
great arcade adventure
playability thrown in, and
not only that but you get to
play Maria Whittiker too (I
said play, not play with),
although this was, on its
ﬁrst release, a very thin
excuse to have her and her
hub caps displayed
prominently on the
packaging, although Kixx
has quite rightly done away
with such ﬂagrant sexism.
This all detracts from the
game though, which of
course is excellent.
The graphics are very well
animated and the action is
a good variation
of search-and-
collect and
sheer violence.

If it wasn't for a completely
useless tape loader this
game would be absolutely
excellent, as it is it's more
than a tad annoying. And
this is a shame because the
gameplay is spot on.
There are three types of
game here, one is
similar to Super Sprint, one
is like erm, Super Sprint,
and one is not like Super
Sprint, it's a little bit
original.
Also it's based on the TV
Show of the same name
(ﬁrst released when Martin
Shaw presented it) and it's a
darn sight better as a game
than that. But the tape
loader is diabolical and you
are not only subjected to
long waits, but a large
amount of tape reversal and
position ﬁnding is called for.
If you're a very patient sort
then you might ﬁnd
something you like at a
cheap price, but if not

This was featured in last
month's guide to shooties
and I have to agree with
Sean, Salamander was
and IS one of the best
shoot-em-ups to be
released (or rereleased for
that matter).
And the strangest thing is
that this passed on full
price with a bit of a
whimper, luckily though,
thanks to The Hit Squad,
you can rush out and grab
one of the best slices of
arcade action for a very
small sum of money
indeedy. We all know the
format by now, icons to be
collected, meanies to be
shot, end-of-level baddies
to be destroyed, and
bigger munchier weaponry
to be used.
It's a multi-loader but that
SKORE 95
hardly notices, and the
levels are so varied and
ﬁendish that it'll keep you
going for ages and ages.
It's the sequel to Nemesis
and it's the best shoot-em-
up to released on budget
ever!!!

There's no sport more boring to
watch on tele than golf, apart from
bowls, cricket and possibly snooker,
but you give me a set of clubs, a
rather natty V-neck sweater and
some hi-tech chequered ﬂares and
away I go. In fact there's nothing
more relaxing than a good game of
pitch and putt, although I'm probably
seen more often down Margate with
a windmill between me and the hole.
And as for computer games, golf
is a very enjoyable sport to be
converted, and we need only look at
the success of Leaderboard to
realise this. And since that, now
ancient, game was released, there
has been nothing that has even
attempted to better it. A few tries,
but they've all fallen down on some
feature of gameplay or whatever.
But now Greg Norman's Ultimate
Golf comes along, and for once
Leaderboard, and any other sport
sim come to think about it, can lie in
the shade of somebody else's
shadow. To say the game was big is
putting it mildly (no pun intended,
well maybe a little bit), the disk is
certainly chocker with ﬁles. There are
two 18 hole courses to be played,
and a large database of players that
can be used.
But before you can ﬂap your wide
trouser legs and shout "FORE" to
down the fairway, you have to
choose your options. You can
practice, play matchplay, strokeplay,
or singles (and it's variations). You
can choose to have up to four
players, any of them being human or
computer controlled, and also set
GOLF
their handicaps. The weather effects
can be chosen too, as can a caddie,
ball effects, and the wind (it builds up
in the troosers).
When you get out on the green
though, you realise the ﬁrst (and
really only) fault of the game. It takes
quite a while to draw the current
scenery, but it's so beautifully
depicted that you'll soon get used to
it. And you will also notice that there
are tons of options, like swing
alteration, map, club choosing,
absolutely everything is there bar the
pub for a quick bevvy afterwards.
The graphics are truly gorgeous,
and it is so like the Amiga version in
every aspect that you would be

more could you possibly want?

The Volkswagon Golf Gil is often

probably wanted a car that is just

ADVENTURE PROBE
CONVENTION SPECIAL
REPORT
Remember the very wonderful
Adventure Probe fanzine mentioned
last month? Well, on September 15
the ﬁrst Probe Convention was held
within a plush hotel in sunny
Birmingham.Wingling amongst the
thousands of attendees was yours
truly. All the starts of stage and
screen were there. Mandy
Rodrigues, illustrious editor of
Adventure Probe; Sandra Sharkey,
the very ﬁrst probe editor and
columnist for the glossies, who is
now looking after the ST's STOS PD
section; the Balrog, from Amstrad
Action, who I locked in the loo until
he admitted that YC was a far better
read; Tom Frost, well known
adventure author on something
called a Spectrum (Eh? No, never
heard of it I'm afraid); Dicon Peeke,
graphic artist for Level 9; Mike
Brailsford, editor of Spellbreaker (see
next month's issue for details on this
excellent mag) and, 00000h,
hundreds of thousands of other
celebs who didn't pay me the
required ﬁver needed to give 'em a
mention.
During the convention a number of
awards were given out. They are
signiﬁcant as all of the voters are
Riggers plays Adventures!
Paul is back with this months
delve into the YC dungeons
(we've got Shergar down there
you know!)
adventure players, also the votes
were cast on games actually played
in the last year, which accounts for
one or two old titles creeping in.
Again, this is signiﬁcant as it gives
you an idea on what games have
stood the test of time. They are as
follows:
THE MOST HELPFUL
ADVENTURER OF THE YEAR
This award was given to those
wonderful chaps who run a 'phone
line help service from home and who
also respond to adventure queries by
post. In third place was Alf Baldwin,
second was my old meter Walter
Pooley (well done Walt) and ﬁrst was
a lovely lad by the name of - Joan
Pancott. The prize being presented
by Mandy Rodrigues.
THE BEST TEXT-ONLY GAME
OF THE YEAR (8 BIT)
In third place was FSF's Magnetic
Moon, in second place as another
FSF adventure - Starship Quest, and
in ﬁrst place was a game written by
Ken Bond called The Test. This
adventure was written for the
Amstrad CPC but I believe there is a
strong possibility that it will be
converted by the cuddly C64. I'll
keep you posted on that one.
THE BIGGEST GAME LET
DOWN OF THE YEAR
In third place was Level 9's Lancelot.
I agree with this wholeheartedly.
Lancelot was bug-ridden and lacking
in a decent plot-line. Strange
considering Level 9's assertions that
they'd researched the Arthurian
legends thoroughly. Second was
Domark's Not a Penny More No a
Penny Less (total and utter dross)
and the winner was Midﬁghter. A
confusing game that came packaged
with a poorly written novel. The
"prize" was presented to Joan
Pancott - and she is the only living
soul to have actually ﬁnished
Mindﬁghter!
BEST GRAPHIC/TEXT GAME
8 BIT
Third was a game from Zenobi
software called Crack City. Second
was Agatha's Folly. The winner
was Level 9's Scapeghost. The
prize being presented to Dicon
Peeke, the Level 9 graphic artist.
THE MOST HELPFUL
SOFTWARE COMPANY OF
THE YEAR
Third was Topologika. Second was
FSF but the winner was Zenobi
software who are establishing
themselves as a growing force (by
sheet numbers alone!) in
independent adventures. Krazy
Kez Gray (editor of Splett! - see
elsewhere - and cartoonist)
accepted the prize on behalf of
Zenobi supremo, John Wilson.
THE LEAST HELPFUL
SOFTWARE COMPANY OF THE
YEAR
In third place was Armageddon &
Cream, who've established an
unhealthy reputation recently. In
second place was Activision - a
reaction to their drop-ing Infocom?
But in ﬁrst place was good 'ol CAL.
Probe reader, Alan Philips, was going
to present the award to CRL at the
recent CES\show but true to form -
they didn't show up!
THE BEST GRAPHIC/TEST
ADVENTURE (16-BIT)
Third was Whiplash and Wagonwheel
(ST) from Zenobi Software. In second

place was the very wonderful
Beyond Zoric from Infocom (Amiga,
ST &PC). But the winner, again from
Infocom, was Zork Zero (Amiga &
PC).
It was at that point that all the lights
went off and a strange, slavering
creature, calling himself the Grue (a
horribly frightening creature found in
dark areas of numerous Infocom
games), appeared to take the prize.
Several ladies fainted at the sight of
this fearsome beast - who sported a
trendy baseball cap, but this
nightmarish apparition was kept at
bay by strategically held chairs and a
large amount of dutch courage
obtained at the bar. If someone
hadn't of managed to retrieve the
lights we would never have seen our
next issue of YC!
BEST ANIMATED ADVENTURE
OF THE YEAR (16-BIT)
In third place was Leisure Suit Larry
3 (Sierra), second was Castle Master
(Domark/Incentive) but the winner
was Lucasﬁlm's Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade.
BEST R O L E
In third place was Bloodwych

Actually this section wasn't reserved
as a category but was initiated at the
demands of the voters. All of the
votes being given to Jim McBrayne's
Holy Grail for the Amiga. Which is
about as landslide a victory as your
likely to get! That slimy Grue thing
accepted the award on behalf of Jim
- then we had to ﬁnd some fresh light
bulbs as all of the others had
simultaneously blown for some
reason.
Then there were the special awards.
Mandy Rodrigues received a well-
deserved award in appreciation of
her services to Probe. Keith
Campbell, received an award for
services to adventuring. Hello Keith
wherever you are! Playtester of the
year was presented to Lorna
Patterson. Tom Frost received an
award for being the ﬁrst adventure
author who was unable to complete
his own adventure! Nick Rumsey,
who appeared in a wonderful
adventurer's outﬁt (lamp, cloak,
rope, the whole bit!) received the
order of the boot (a large concrete
one - you should see the size of his
feet!). Neil Shipman received the
From of the year award, for making
the most incredible attempts to solve
puzzles in infocom games. The
gurgling Grue was then presented
with a special " F r

under observation in the local
hospital, after this ﬁnal encounter.
The convention was a rip-roaring
success and was enjoyed by all,
including your very own YC
newshound. In fact, why not join me
at the second convention, next
year? Everyone's welcome, you
don't have to be a member or
anything silly like that. You can
bring as many friends as you want,
too.
For the buyer, there were lots of
stalls at the convention, selling new
and second-hand adventures on all
formats. In addition, adventure
authors were available for help,
advice and offers of large drinks.
Incidentally, it was nice to see so
many ladies of all ages - attend. I
reckon adventuring is one of the
very few areas of computing that
has a balance of men and women
participants. Didn't see any female
Grues, thought!
Don't forget, if anyone wishes to
purchase the Adventure Probe just
send .50 to Mandy Rodrigues,

ADVENTURE MAG ROUND-UP
(PT.2)
Well, actually, this particular mag is
not reeeaaallyy an adventure mag.
But the editor is a true-blue
adventurer and the publisher is
Mandy Rodrigues and the mag was
available at the Probe convention so
I thought - well, alright then.
Splatt! - ﬁr it is she - is produced by
a stunningly beautiful cartoonist by
the name of Krazy Kez Grey. How
come these adventure editors are all
foxy ladies, hmm? The mag is full of
erm... well, cartoons, comic strips,
TV soap skits, jokes, puzzles and, oh
other bits that I can't describe
without reference to the Big Red
Swahili Colouring Book. You'll meet
characters such as Aunty Nancy
Noah!, Floyd, Spooky Ray and Kez
herself. Anyone who wishes to
subject themselves to this amazing,
incredible, implausible, absurd... er,

WHITER THAN WHITE
I am a new reader of your, what I
think, brillo mag and I have a small
favour to ask. Please could you try to
use Street Surfer as one of the
games on your tape? I would be most
grateful!
Ross Dawson. Nowhere in particular
PA: Why are you so preoccupied

us to stick a pair of Marigold
rubber gloves to the front. Maybe
you should be buying Bella

TOTAL POWER
I have just started to collect your
wonderful magazine and I think it's
totally brill!!! When I saw the ad on
page 11 immediately sent away for it.
It was, of course, the Power
Cartridge.
After 2 weeks I got it, and being
new to computers I did not
understand much of the instructions.
As far as I can see there are no
instructions on how to enter pokes,
as that is what I want it for most. So
please please please could you give
me instructions on how to work
pokes_ Thank you.
Ronan Power, Eire
PA; Apt name. Why is everybody
so fond of using the three
identical words "please please

for now, I'm as thick as a boar's

phoning BDL on (091) 490 1975,
they'll be more than willing to give
you a few pointers on how to use
this excellent utility (it's got more
uses than just for pokes you
know)!
LOGICAL SOLUTION
Hi there! If you're answering problems on
Logic don't be selﬁsh, spread yoursetf
about a bit
You may be dealing with the same query
- how comes the reward for getting the
right answer is to have to re-load?
I had the tape replaced but still no
joy - second copy was same as the
ﬁrst - get the answer right, try to type
in your name and what do you get? A
crashed out Commodore!
Could be a lot more readers with the
same problem - think about it!
Eric Stockwell, Northampton
PA: I've had a chat with our
Technical Adviser and he says that
because the game was originally a
disk based one, after one load and
one game it tries to access the
disk. Not ﬁnding one it immediately
crashes, therefore there is no
solution to the problem, and
anyway nobody likes a smart ass!
GOVERNMENT ELF WARNING
I am only 8 and I am just learning a
computer Please please please can I have
some hints and tips on Elven Watrior?
Kevin Yates, Nowhere in particular.
PA: If somebody could send them in
to us, yes! Look out for some in the
Scum of the Earth section.
JUST IN CASE
IRANGATE
I want to subscribed YC magazine.
If it is possible, please send me a
proforma invoice of this magazine.
Thanking you in advance and looking
forward to hearing from you soon.
Amir Naghdi, Kerman, Iran
PA: Er... We'll try but don't be
surprised if it hasn't been opened
several times, debugged, deloused,
and had quarantine messages
stamped all over it before it reaches
you.
KRON AND ON AND ON...
I have just bought September's issue
of YC, everything is brill apart from
the games tape. Its not gone wrong
it's just that I have a problem with
one of the games, Kron, that brilliant
text and graphics game. The problem
is that I can't get off of the ﬁrst
screen. Would you please send me
details telling me what to type in so
that I can get somewhere?
Tony Gallant, Norwich
PA: Nope! Oh all right then, check
out the Misadventures column
and Uncle Pauly will give you a
few pointers, that IS what he's
there for you know!
LETTA O F  THE M U N I F I
Yo Posty with the ultra cool mag, I've just read September's VC, great!
Bung in the tape, wicked (had some trouble getting it)! I've got a couple of
suggestions:
1) Why don't you put the tape in a case?
2) You should have a tip line for people that need help or to send things in.
Shaun Parrish, Bristol
PS. Here's a joke. How do you kill an elephant that's been bitten by a
werewolf?
Shoot it in the heart with a silver peanut.
PA: Here, I've got a few suggestions too... 1) If we put the tape in a
case then we'd have to charge more money for the mag, consider
the case closed! 2) To have a tip line, we'd have to charge you 38p
per minute peak and 25p per minute standard rate (like certain
other magazines) just for the privilege Wh a t's  wrong with Scum of
the Earth? 3) As for your joke, why don't you... (CUT - Ed)

W
explosives this turned out to
be, everything from driving,
blasting, nicking crirns to water
warehouse raves - all top Tengen
arcade conversions.
I always thought Hard Drivin was
getting my poor old Renault up
Muswell Hill until I test-drove the
computer game which has been kept
in Domarli's garage especially for this
compilation and no wonder! The
controls were frustratingly difﬁcult
enough without having to cope with
maniacally programmed trafﬁc which
came at you last minute with no
warning and the wishy washy chunky
coloured, spectrum quality graphics
gave me quite a headache. My  MOT
revealed the conversion to be a bad
attempt from an arcade smash to a
Robin Reliant simulator,
Onto Dragon Spirit, the vertically
scrolling shoot-em-up with an Oriental
ﬂavour. You play a ﬁrey Dragon with

special powers, by shooting the
enemy and collecting their eggs
(spells), the more ﬁre power or extra
heads you gain and the closer you will
be to saving a damson in distress.
After each of the eight levels you will
have a nasty to blasty. Fo r a good or
shoot-em-up the graphics are shoddy,
the playing area is so small that you
cannot avoid the enemy ﬁre and it has
as much spirit as ﬂat ginger beer.
Xybots in comparison is a jolly
good ol' blast, set in a huge
underground maze and equipped with
a laser gun to 'wipe out' and Zapper to
stun, your mission is to penetrate the
complex, picking up energy pods,
coins and keys and ﬁnally to overcome
the master Xybot. At the end of each
action-packed level you can trade in
coins for a multitude of goodies to help
you on route. More fun can be had
with two-players (oo-erl) turning it into
a Gauntlet style game of co-operation.
A starring role in Police Academy is
yours in APB - a fantastic conversion
from the cartoon-style chase-em-up in
the arcades. You play poor Ofﬁcer Bob
who is set a daily quota of offenders to
nick from litter louts, drunks, and
hitch hikers to the toughest of all
crims. It's sure tough out on the
streets acting out wild Starsky and
Hutch car chases, however there's
always detours and donut shops to
earn you extra credits. I t s  fast it's fun
and you may make Miami Vice by the
end!
Toobin' is a unique water rave-up
as you play Biff or Jet, two cool tube
dudes as they cruise the baddest
rivers in this world. Against the clock
you paddle down stream picking up
cans to chuck at baddies like punks,
ﬂy ﬁshermen, swamp monsters and
even kamikaze penguins who get in
your damn way and cruise through
gates for extra bonuses. Toobin' is a
wet'n'wild, fun and mega addictive
splash-em-up!
Apart from a few duds TNT is a
pretty hot Tengen mix-em-up, and
well worth the cassette price.

pair of balls. This time they
are dead set on destroying a
load of nasty monsters. This time it's
going to be different. No-one's going
to push this spherical duo around,
not without a damn good reason
anyway...
What is Helter Skelter? Well, it's a
silly name for a bouncy ball arcade
puzzle game. Why Helter Skelter?
Who knows. Presumably the idea of
a helter skelter simulation was too
far fetched to be workable. Anyway,
name aside, you have to control one
of the balls to wipe out loads of
monsters
Monsters really have it tough. Not
only are they the villains of the piece
(as usual) but they also have arrows
pointing to the one who you have to
kill next. You do this by bouncing
heavily upon the hapless creature
wherupon it vanishes. Some people
are born unlucky. Fortunately for
monsterkind there are disadvantages
to bouncing on the wrond monster.
What happens then is that the
monster splits into two halves. This
is obviously painless because he
carries on running around regardless
of his new shorter size. Some
monsters can only be split once
whilst others have many splits (if you
give them the chance of course).
Each of the eighty screens is made
of platforms. The balls (because you
can invite a friend to control your
other ball) ﬂy around the screen,

often getting
in each
others' way,
racing to grab
the points. On
each level
there is a
bonus score.
This is halved
each time you
use the option
to make the
ball bounce
unaided, so
and rebounds
it's wise to use gravity
as much as possible.
For each monster killed there is a
bonus scored, so in theory the more
monsters you create the more the
score that can be obtained. But
there's the chance that you will make
a slip and miss out on the last
monster before time runs out.
Didn't I mention the rather strict time
limit? Well, there is a rather strict
time limit on each level. This makes
the task that little bit more exciting.
Oh come on, hitting the monsters
doesn't kill you, so there's got to be
some drawback to it all.
Another drawback is the rather
ﬁddly control method. This is a
problem at ﬁrst, but after a while you
pick it up. Pressing ﬁre at the bottom
of a bounce makes the ball leap ever
higher. To get bouncing in the ﬁrst
place requires either a steep drop or
a small ledge to ram. Ramming a
ledge makes you jump just a little but
it's enough to get you started.
The other thing about the controls is
the inertia. You have only limited in-
ﬂight control of your ball as the
speed it was travelling has an effect
on the directions that you use. It
feels 'real' in that you can't just
change direction without a bit of
slowing down and
accelleration.
Some screens
have a really nasty
time limit and one
wrong move can
spell disaster.
Others have
plenty of time but
loads of tricky
monsters to get
to. So the game
always keeps you
on your toes. With
eighty to play
through I don't
think that Helter
Skelter is going to
be completed
overnight.
Good graphics, great sound and
a very addictive game. Once you get
used to the controls, of course,
things get better, and you'll want to
come back for more. Try playing with
a friend and watch the competitive
spirit come ﬂooding out...

Comics only this month as Flame On returns as Speakeasy's
editor Stuart Green once more graces us with his cunning wit
and bag of goodies...
JUDGE DREDD: THE
MEGAZINE #1
Fleetway, £1.50, various
Amidst the rash of new
titles from the
Galaxy's Greatest
Publishing House (well,
that's what they would
have us believe) the option
of publishing a solo comic
featuring the nation's favourite
facist seemed to have been
overlooked. But not for long.
Here, at last, in full zarjazz colour
are Dredd and the other denizens of
Mega-City; Chopper, Judge Death
and our Kenny, the hapless would-be
artist; with the Angel family to come
soonest
Best stories are, America, John
Wagner and Cohn McNeil's further
exploration of the Democracy theme,
started way, way before Dredd took the
Long Walk. It's a scene setter, like most
of the meg, but this promises good
things as Dredd belatedly examines his
role as a Judge, jury and executioner.
Cam Kennedy returns to drawing Dredd
after what seems a decade long wait in
'Our Kenny'. Ironically, with a satirical
tale that takes creator rights as its
theme as Kenny again seeks work in
Mega-City. Chopper, the skysurfer last
seen supposedly fatally injured during
the climax to Superourf 11 (Available in
book form, E5.95 and worth every cred),
rises phoenix-like to clean up the Oz
Radback.
The other two stones, Midnite's
Children and Young Death haven't really
clicked in yet, so I'll suspend judgement
(ha, puns doncha just
love'em). Overall, it's
a hit and should see
Dredd well into the
twenty-ﬁrst
century, when
time'll start to
catch up to
the old
bugger I
suppose.

LOBO #1
DC, 65p, Keith Gillen, Alan Grant,
Simon Sisley
Well if Alan Grant can't quite get
himself excited about writing
another Dredd story just yet
(he wrote Midnite's
Children) he certainly
comes up with the
space freight on this
one. Plotted by Giffen,
who gives you the
knockabout comedy of the
Justice League, Grant is left with
the simple task of coming up with the
smart assed one-liners.
Lobo is one mean mutha who guns
the spaceways on his hog. Lobo killed off
every other inhabitant of his home planet
just for the sheer thrill kill. Except one. His
grey haired, diciplinatian fourth-grade
teacher who just happens to have written
a libelous biography of the "Assassin to
Royalty and Scourge of the Cosmos". His
task? To escort his teacher across the
galaxy to safe keeping. In one hilarious
scene she ticks off the bad guys for using
the word "ain't'. Lobo's not pleased.
Simon Bisley is. Revelling in the
lunacy of Grant's script, he turns in art
that swings from the skewed
perspectives of Kevin (Marshal Law)
O'Neil to the outright insanity that is Gary
Larson.

HARD BOILED #1 (of 4)
Dark Horse, E.2.95, Frank Miller, Geof
Darrow
This is a less serious affair than Miller's
current collaboration with Dave Gibbons,
Give Me Liberty. Whereas Liberty is all 'do
the apocalypse with a social conscience'
in the same way as Crisis' Third World
War, HB is pure sci-ﬁ hi-tee overkill.
There is a higher body count in the
ﬁrst two pages of this ﬁrst issue than in
the whole of Total Recall, as Nixon, a
c-yborg whose programmed to believe
he's human, or a hume who dreams that
he's a cyborg, goes on a killing spree
downtown. The story realty is as simple as
that, with Miller paring down even further
his normally terse script to allow new art
wunderkind, Darrow, the space to really
let rip.
Darrow's art is the realty exciting thing
here. Every shard of broken glass, tattered
clothing and ﬂying bullet incredibly
detailed. An obsessive ﬁlling every comer
of every page. Darrow gives new meaning
to the phrase "Wow, sheer carnage!"
Another must in a bumper month for great
comics.
CADILLACS AND
DINOSAURS #1 (of 4)
Epic, Elko°, Mark Schultz
Maybe not to everyone's taste this one,
harping back to the dawn of comic art
with a deﬁnite thirties look to it. But then
that's what's brought Schutt heaps of
comic awards.
The twenty-sixth century, Earth is
recovering from The Bomb that has
reaped huge and total
environmental mutation
on the planet. The age of
Dinosaurs has returned.
Originally published
as part of Kitchen Sink
Press' Xenozoic Tales,
the three stories that
comprise this issue
provide the perfect
introduction to
Mark Schultz's
world of
twentieth-century
technology meets pre-historic
life forms.
DARKMAN #1 (of 3)
Marvel, El, Machio, Hall, Texeira
Much more of your standard Marvel
comic this, but it does its job of adapting
Sam Raimi's latest horror smash into
comic form adequately enough. The
Darkman has been hideously disﬁgured
in a chemical accident (like a certain
Swamp creature, y'understand) and is left
at the end swearing revenge on all those
responsible for his new found ugliness.
As I say, its okay but nothing to run
out and beg for extra pocket-money for.
All titles available from Forbidden
Planet, 21 New Oxford Street,

THALAMUS -
E9.99 Tape,

Aaaah, ain't he
cute? Likkle
cutesy wootsy
pookams. Rik isn't but he
looks at the cutest game
ever, probably!
Cute games, don't they make you
puke eh? They certainly get on my
wick, that is, unless they're so
absolutely stonkingly good that I
have to lock myself in a room not to
emerge for three million years.
Summer Camp is a right stonker,
make no mistake.
But its so damn cute! The main
character, Maximus Mouse, looks a
tad familiar to fans of Tom and Jerry,
although this mouse doesn't have a
thicko cat running after him with a
frying pan. Nope, he's got bigger
problems than that indeed. You see,
he's found himself in one of those
Summer Camps, you know the
centres that American parents send
they're kids to each and every
summer in order to get them out
from beneath they're feet (sort of a
cross between Butlins and
Nuremberg). Now, the kids
themselves absolutely hate this sort
of concentration camp, so a small,
cuddly, cartoon-like rodent isn't
going to ﬁnd it any less tasteless or
anything but completely tacky.
So what would you do? Yep, get
outta there! But the great question is,
how? Scattered around the many
platform-like screens are ACME
crates, each containing a part of a
mode of transport that would help
you get away from this hell in
backwatersville. You must collect all
the parts and you will ﬁnd yourself
faced with a sub-game (a blueprint of
the vehicle that must be arranged)
which earns you bonus points, and
then a new level with another vehicle
to collect and a different setting.
There are four of these levels, but
you'd better concentrate on the ﬁrst,
because it's no easy job grabbing
crates, you have to earn them and
sweat (although the game's so cute,
you probably sweat lemonade) for it.
There are many hazards on each
screen, and absolutely tons of
meanies out to stop you from
leaving. These mainly come in the
form of other animals (anything from
skunks to chickens), but there are
also killer helicopters, whirlwinds and
the occasional insect or two. And

you must try your hardest to avoid
them while bouncing around the
landscape. Another hazard that you
should be aware of is that you can't
fall too far, else Maximus Mouse
becomes Maximus Sp'at!
Fortunately, also scattered
around are icons that can be
collected and they'll either have a
bad effect on you, or a darn good
one. For instance there is a piece of
melon, when once in your inventory,
you can shoot the pips at the enemy.
There's a parachute too, that allows
you to make one lethal drop without

Complete And Utter Fib
I once had an uncle who went to
the moon in a rocket built out of old
cereal packets and egg cartons.
Then he circled Mount Everest in a
balloon sewn together using Nuns'
frilly undies. No he didn't really, I
made that up! He circled Mont
Blanc.

This game is predominantly
aimed towards the younger market,
with excellent graphics in a very
Warner Bros. cartoon style, and as
such has the handy facility to offer

hints along the way, so that you get
help in sussing out what you should,
or should not, do. The computer
does not control the joystick though,
that's completely down to you, which
is just as well as you'll be addicted
very quickly indeed.
If you're old enough to remember
Manic Miner, or Jet Set Willy, you'll
recognise the style of gameplay
immediately, and Thalamus has
succeeded in doing a great job in
bringing that theme to the 90s. A
gorgeous game that has such
breathtaking graphics and great
playability that it could be the
biggest shock this Christmas.

PLOTTING
OCEAN - E29.99
Cartridge Only
Rik is plotting
the downfall of
the poll tax, but
w
h
i
l
e
he'sdoing
so he gives Ocean's ﬁrst
cartridge game a whizz...
S
commercially released
cartridge is here, and boy is it a
luxury compared to normal loading.
Just plug it in the back of your
machine and Bob's your uncle and
Fanny's a rude word, it appears
immediately on screen as soon as
you turn the computer on. Not only
that but Plotting contains zillions of
levels and there is absolutely no
multiload whatsoever, no siree, it all
goes with the ﬂow. But is this luxury
worth the extra cost? I mean, it's
easy to raise a tenner for an
excellent game, but 25-30 quid? That
kind of cash only comes around
birthdays or Christmas time.
Fortunately, Plotting is released
around the festive season so many
people WILL be able to afford it, and
quite rightly so because it's a bit of a
stonker. And in fact, compared to
Puzznic, it's the most playable
puzzle game since Tetris (and I mean
that most sincerely kids).
The idea is also quite original in the
fact that you have a screen of a
block of different types of small

and for his trouble he ended up

must do is shoot the same kind of
block with a block that the helper
carries, but it's not really as
simple as that.
Once a similar
block has been
shot, the block next
to, or underneath it
will then become the
next block that you
carry, so you must
avoid shooting a block
that will release a block
of a type where there is
no visable match. If you
do so you will lose a life
and be given a super block
out of your store
(this can shoot any type of
block). If this is getting confusing to
you you're not the only one, Mark is
currently walking around the ofﬁce in
a daze after reading this.,.
The way to get more points is to
shoot a row of similar blocks, and
you get a bonus score. And as the
levels get harder, the time limit
decreases and the screen changes
slightly so that you cannot access as
many of the vertical rows of blocks.
The graphics are very reasonable
indeed, and far above the average
set by this type of thang, but the
muzak is slightly irritating.
Playability is where this little baby
cooks, it's a real delicious gem of
puzzling and action, and it's the
addictive thing to appear on the
market since Jelly Tots (I just can't
get enough of them). One would be
wary though of such an outlay in
money though, but at least the
product is completely brill.

W
for this'un, haven't we? I
mean, it's been out on the
other computers for ages, and
owners of 'inferior' machines have
all been singing "nah, nah nee nail,
nah!" to our faces for quite a while.'
But at least it's now arrived, and
it's our turn to turn our buttock
cheeks towards them and promptly
pull our troosers down because it's
not just good, it's moon worthy.
But why was it so late? Ah, this is
because the programmer said, when
he was half way through the C64
version, "Hmmm. I think I'll do
something else for a while and make
loads and loads of luverly cash!" So
he did, and now that he's ﬁnished
that project, he's also ﬁnished the
last version of this coin-op
nversion, and we're mighty
grateful that he has.
Midnight Resistance is a game
and a half, and it's that extra half that
makes it whole (there goes my GCSE
maths). But the plot certainly does
not add to the game, then again they
seldom do, do they?
A scientist has been grabbed by
the undesirables (brings tears to your

There are some ﬁendish large

the levels like most other games. But
fortunately, just like the arcade
machine itself, there are safe points
which, when found, allow you to
dispense your own form of justice
without receiving so much as a small

What are you reading this for
then? Clever people don't need
to cheat at games, they're clever 'int
they! But those that have contributed
to this new look Scum of the Earth,
well they get prizes don't they! If you
want prizes then you'll have to get it
together won't ya.
RANKINGS
Private Prat - The lowest rating for
Scum, they get a badge if they're
lucky! (Coo... it's a bit like Blue Peter
'int it!)
Corporal Crud - We're moving into
T-Shirt territory here.
Sergeant Slime - A free game on
cassette or disk for those rasing to
this unbelievable level. This month

it's the truly awesome E-Motion from
US Gold.
Captain Colostomy - Two free

we?)
General Gunge - If anybody
produces tips this hot I'll eat my own
spot juice! A day out live roleplaying
awaits for those that get to this level.
MYTH (System 3)
Douglas McArthur supplies us
creepy fellows with a few choice
nibbles that no Myth player could go

Private. Douglas, and enjoy your very
shiny badgeroony.
Tip One - While loading in level 1,
have Shift Lock down. When it has
loaded, kill yourself (what really? -
Ooze) and this will put you on the
next section. Keep doing this all the
way through with Shift Lock still
down until you reach the end of level
1. Take it off when you start to load
level 2.
Tip Two - From level 2 onwards you
should hold down the A key and
press ?. This'll give you most of the
weapons you need for almost
everything.

(Krisalis)
Here's Glenn Bryant with a blatantly
obvious tip that's almost worth
asking him to send US some goodies
just for printing it, but seeing as he
also supplies the Turrican and Power
Drift tips that follow I suppose he
gets a copy of E-Motion for being a
Sergeant.
If you're losing with only seconds to
go (especially in a cup match) just
plug a joystick in the other port and
press ﬁre. Now the other team will
stand still and you can boot the ball
in at the other end, yaaaaahhh!!!
TURRICAN
(Rainbow Arts)
Glenn again...
WARNING! - Only people with three
hands from the planet Fishton can
get this cheat to work!
When you start the game (or on any
level come to think of it) press the
pause key (Control) and hold it down
(Better still, use some sellotape).
Now hold the ﬁre button down as
well and you can go roaming around
the levels with no aliens to bother
you! But you still have to kill the big
end of level guardians (Well, nobody
said that life was a cheap 'n' tacky
Neighbours set).
POWER DRIFT
(Activision)
You may have been thinking that this
game is ancient, but it's on the

LORDS OF CHAOS
(Blade)
Thanx to another Sergeant, a certain
K. Smith, here's loads of wicked tips
for the YC Fun One that impressed
those rabble in the ofﬁce last ish...
Creatures
Dragons - The hardest of all
creatures! Although they are hard to
summon, their strength is worth it.
Their ﬁre spreads fast, but be careful
when using it on the ground.
Humanoids and Weapon Users
(Harpy, Giant, Troll, Goblin, Dwarf,
Pixie, Centaur) - These animals can
use weapons and most of them can
ride other animals. Giants, Harpies,
Trolls and Goblins are the only
worthwhile beings here. Pixies may
be invisible but they are useless.
Mounts (Elephant, Gryphon,
Pegasus, Unicorn) - The horse-allkes
of L.O.C. Elephants and Gryphons
are very powerful and high stamina
helps them cover large distances.
The Pegasus and Unicorn should not
be used continually as they will get
tired rapidly.
Undead (Demon, Ghost, Zombie,
Vampire, Spectre) Un d e a d  are very
dangerous enemies and it is a good
idea to always have a couple of
Vampires or Spectres as guards for
your wizard or party. Ghosts can
travel through walls and make
excellent scouts. Zombies are no
good. Demons are extremely
dangerous, although it is possible for
a Spectre to kill a Demon.
Misc. Animal (Crocodile, Giant Bat,
Bear, Lion, Gorilla, Spider) -
Crocodiles are sturdy ﬁghters. Bears
and Lions are extremely dangerous
enemies and useful allies (the Lion
has a very high A.P. and can run very
fast). Bats and Gorillas should not be
used, as they are no good. The
spider is very powerful and should
not be tackled by anything less
dangerous than a Gryphon.
Spells
Magic Fire, Gooey Blob - 2 very useful
spells which can destroy large amounts
of enemies. The higher the level the
faster it spreads. Fire does more
damage, but the blob is tougher and is
harder to destroy. Do not cast these
spells near objects as they too will be
destroyed.
Tangle, Vine, Flood - Useful, but only on
higher levels. Flood can be fatal as
creatures may drown.
Enchant - get it! Always have a spare
enchant spell so that you can deal with
unexpected undead.
Subversion, Magic Attack - Pretty
useless unless above level 4, but don't
count on it.
Curse - Very good, but save it for
wizards, Make sure it's above level 2.
Magic Bolt, Lightning - 2 very good
spells, at high levels they can be
devastating. When casting make sure
your army is well out of the way of
lightning as it covers quite an area.
Teleport - Immensely useful spell, but
make sure the target area is a clear
space, away from walls as this spell is
inaccurate at low levels.
Magic Eye - Quite useful, but short range.
Magic Shield - Could save your life, but
doesn't last very long and weakens
easily.
Scenarios
1. The Many Coloured Land - An easy
task, but a tight time limit. You will be
able to locate Torquemada in the
second round by looking at the map
at the other houses and ﬁnding the
one with at least one open door. He
will make 2 goblins, 2 vampires, 1
troll, 1 centaur, 1 elephant, 1 giant bat
and a bear for his army. Beware the
vampires.
Once you have killed him search the
land for 4 chest keys and 1 door key.
Then go to the house with four
locked doors, but beware, 2 giant
spiders roam through the wood, and
there is one in the house. Unlock the
four chests, grab the treasure (make
sure it's your wizard that is carrying
it) and get in the portal. Experience -
520 max.
2. Slayer's Dungeon - Tricky this one.
Split your party into 2 and search the
place for a door key. Before doing
this make sure each part of the party
has 1 or 2 powerful undead guarding
them as Elbo Smogg will make a
demon and there are many spectres
wandering around, Beware of the
invisible and make sure your wizard
is mounted, preferably on a gryphon_
Take the key to the locked room with
the ring of lava and enter it. Kill the 2
vampires, open the chest, take the
keys and go to the other locked
room. Kill the demon, cross the lava,
get the treasure and RUN!
N.B. Kill Elbo Smogg before he casts
gooey blob, as this will prevent you
from reaching the portal without the
aid of a teleport spell.
3. Ragaril's Domain - The last, and
hardest, of the scenarios. Do not
attempt it with a wizard below level
three. When you ﬁrst appear go
straight up and right, but do not walk
into the middle of the room between
the corridor as it ﬁres a tangle weed
trap.
Get the key from the second room
and go to the room with an altar. Put
a weak creature on the altar. Next
turn he will be gone.
Unlock the 3rd door, open the chest
and take the key. Break the glass
cases and arm your soldiers. Ignore
the ﬂashing ﬂoor (red herring) and go
to the room with the head - never
enter the middle of a square room -
and hit the head. Walk on and magic
bolt or shoot the creatures over the
chasm with bows.

Go up and unlock the chest then kill
the three zombies in the small rooms.
Go through the walls (search for the
fake ones) until you ﬁnd the
transporter. After you have been
transported get the diamond and
ﬂood the ﬁre. Go right and set ﬁre to
the ﬂoor. Fly down to the room with
four circles and kill Ragaril.
BLOOD WYCH
(Image Works)
Here's another bloody obvious tip,
this one from Simon Pestell, who
earns himself a badge and the
rank of Private.
To get extra armour, gold, etc. on
Bloodwych all you have to do is
choose a 2 player game, do the
selections as usual, then make
one of the groups drop all their
possessions. The other character
can now pick them up and wander
off (this is not advised when 2
people are playing!)
LASER SQUAD
(Blade)
David Walker, the latest Sergeant to
come our way and the latest scum to
earn himself a copy of E-Motion,
deals with another excellent Blade
game. And these are "the most
comprehensive tips ever"...
Scenarios
1. The Assassins - This scenario
is, to be blunt, simple and should not
pose any trouble for even the poorest
player. However, if you're really stuck
(or if you are playing against a good
human player) then this will help to
complete the mission.
The only problem is that you only get
the basic guns, but then so do the
enemy. Give your Corporal a 4
armour, then give him a rocket-
launcher with at least 3 extra rockets.
Give all the other men marsecs if you
can, but if you can't afford them go
for M-4000s or pistols if you really
have to. Don't forget a few grenades!
It really doesn't matter which side of
the house you start, but for some
strange reason I prefer the right side.
The ﬁrst step is to pump a few
grenades into the house. Then, when
a few droids poke their heads out,
blow them away with rockets if
possible, if not use grenades. Once
you are out of rockets. march your
men into the house moving slowly to
keep your men on opportunity ﬁre.
When you are in the main corridor of
the house throw a few grenades
around, this should kill Sterner. If not
just hunt him down, he usually ends
up in the top left room.
2. Moonbase - In this scenario it
is far easier to wipe out the
opposition than destroy the
computers and other objects. Head
for the central room and chuck a few
grenades around, this will draw the
enemy to you, and as long as you
have men looking in all directions you
should be able to pick them off with
ease. If you cannot see the last man
and time is running short send about
3 of your men off in different
directions. When one of them gets
shot you'll know where the enemy is
and send all of your squad after him.
The best weapons are the marsec or,
for the paupers among you, the M-
4000. The sniper riﬂe can be handy
but only have one or two of your men
with these. Grenades are vital, of
course, and you need loads of them.
3. Rescue From The Mines - This
is the ﬁrst mission that makes life
hard for the beginner. A few attempts
are needed before you can kick ass.
The enemy seem very good at
picking off your men with their
inaccurate guns, and your men seem
to lack the skills needed to match
them. It takes a lot of practice before
you can beat them. One of the best
methods seems to be to spend as
little time as possible in the long
tunnels. If you stay in the short ones
you can beat them at their own
game. Another problem is the
explosives. They are very heavy so
only carry 3. Swap the explosives
round so not just 3 people get
knackered.
Don't put the prisoners straight into
the lifts, I hardly ever deposit one I
just use them as reinforcements while
I wipe out the enemy.
Grenades are once again vital. I
would stick with the marsecs but
bring along one riﬂe for long range
combat. One handy tip is that one of
the enemy has a security key. Use
this to turn on the screen in one of
the large rooms to the right of the
map. As long as he is standing in
front of the screen you can see all the
enemy!
4. The Cyber Hordes (This is on
the Expansion Kit along with scenario
5. The order form is in the back of
your manual) - The big problem in
this scenario is the Battle Droid, it's
very, very tough. The only way to
dispose of him that is even slightly
safe is to drop one of those spanking
new AP-75 grenades right on top of
him.
To make things more difﬁcult is that
all the normal droids only earn
brownie points on destruction. You
have to destroy the battle droids a
number of times.
Also, why not try out a few of your
new weapons? The MS-Auto Cannon
is very powerful, but you should be
careful in thin corridors as you could
blow away half of your team (I don't
usually bring along this gun on this
mission)! The other new gun is the
Mk 1. This is one accurate gun, and
it's pretty powerful, it makes the
marsec auto useless. But you must
not forget your mission. You must
protect those cores, meaning you'll
have to bring loads of AP-75s.
5. Paradise Valley (Expansion Kit)
- This is a tough scenario, although I
do ﬁnd it a tad easier than number
four. The ﬁrst part is easy. Move your
men to the ﬁrst transporter and put
them all down it. Now, if you are on
level 1 go straight to the underground
lake, you do not need to be on
opportunity ﬁre until then, but if you
are on a high level you need to be
careful from the start. If you
encounter the water dweller in the
ﬁrst lake, kill him! He may look
harmless enough but, although he
can't ﬁre, if you let him get close he
will kill your men in close combat.
Then you must get Out of the water
as he, like all the other water dwellers
and splurges, will reappear after 3
turns.
Shoot all the sectoids before going
up onto the river. Keep all your men
in a circle around the man carrying
the security device, while moving
slowly. If you keep your stamina up
you will make it.
Choosing your guns in this scenario
is very important to your survival.
Give everyone an MS auto cannon for
the surface of the planet, but give
them pistols for the easier
underground section. Keep Hansen
at the front so he can use his Mk 1.
When you are on the surface use
your MS cannons to blow away
chunks of bushes and splurges even
if you can't see them.
This is the ﬁrst and only section in
which you don't have to take
grenades in order to survive.
6. The Stardrive - (This and
scenario 7 are on Expansion Kit
2)This scenario, to the experienced
player, is not too hard. It is only the
second in which you can use a rocket
launcher, but don't give this to a
corporal. Give it to someone who has
little or no armour so they don't have
too much weight to lug around.
Give your corporals the brand new
lethal Mk 2s, these are very accurate
and powerful. Give your men either
HP-50 lasers or karsec autos, these
are both good guns and the karsec is
very cheap. The pumps are getting,
by this time, very outdated so don't
bring them. Also grenades are not
that vital so don't bring many.
When going through the sewers keep
moving but go slowly, while picking
off droids from long range if possible.
The rocket launcher is good at this as
it does not actually need to hit the
droid to kill it, and it will kill it with
only
one shot. Try to avoid shootouts with
the droids as they normally come off
better. And watch out as they do

reappear after a few turns.
Once inside the complex, hunt down
all the men and search them for the
stardrive. One thing, the laser cutter
is needed to get into the complex,
and don't attempt to give anything
else to the man carrying this as the
cutter is so heavy. Also, don't try to
shoot anyone with it as it only ﬁres at
a very short range.
7. Laser Platoon (Expansion Kit 2)
- This is, as the manual suggests, the
ultimate scenario. It is also one of the
hardest.
The main thing that you need to do if
your team are getting blown away is
run off into hiding! If you can survive
long enough you will receive
reinforcements. Another important tip
is if you have got the opposition
scared don't be frightened to go into
attack.
Try and put a few guards near to
where the enemy reinforcements
come from, this way you can pick off
the storm commandos before they
even get into combat. I always ﬁght
in the central room (the one with the
pillars) because the pillars get in the
way and you can pick the enemy off
before they even see you, but they
can do the same to you.
You must make your reinforcements
take the weapons off of their dead
buddies as you cannot expect them
to survive with just their riﬂes.
As before, Mk 2s and karsecs are
important and most of your team
should have these. H-30 lasers are
good. Give 2 of your men MS auto
cannons, and they should get behind
the armoury droid and pump about 4
rounds into it. Don't try to shoot it
from the front. Grenades are quite
useful.
One other point, when deploying
reinforcements, just make them
sprint towards your men. As long as
your main squad are keeping the
enemy's hands full, they shouldn't
experience any problems. This does
tire them out though, so when they
get properly armed up you should
put them on a bit of guard duty to
get them relaxed.
General Tips - Arm all corporals
with 4 rated armour and a good, but
light, gun, don't load them down too
much. Give the troopers no armour
but heavier guns.
Probably the most important and
vital tip, and I can't stress this
enough, is that whenever possible
you should leave your men on
opportunity ﬁre. If you don't your
team will just get blown away. Also
when you go through tunnels always
cover your back, you'll get some
nasty surprises if you don't!
I normally spend more money on
guns than armour, and just
remember to keep your cool and
move slowly.

D
games, Think-Em-Ups, well
they've got to have a label as
there's so many of the blighters. And
Ocean has got two on the way itself,
with Puzznic being the slightly more
adult of them (Plotting is the other, in
case you hadn't sussed). Another
similarity is that both games are
based on arcade machines and they
both owe an awful lot to the success
of Teths.
Puzznic is more adult than most
puzzle games because it requires an
awful lot more cranial activity than
arcade reﬂexes, although those are
required too because the whole
caboodal is based on the clock
(which ticks away too damn fast if
you ask me). The idea is to match up
blocks of the same kind, they've all
got different sorts of symbols inside
them to allow you to distinguish
(even on a black and white TV), by
moving your controller over a block
and moving it from left to right. You
cannot move a block up, and if there
is nothing underneath it it will fall due

to the force of gravity.
Each level is vastly different from
each other, with the playing area a
varying shape. There are also all
sorts of obstacles and moving
blocks to be encountered too. But
the idea, no matter how complicated
the extras sound, is still very simple.
To match a block up you must
move a similar block beside or on
top of it and they will disappear,
either hampering if you've done the
screen in the wrong order, or helping
to release another match up.

Puzznic sounds like a Polish name,

you can
start that screen
again.
Otherwise you
have to wait
for the time
to run
down and
it is game
over.
Fortunately
for those
who become
very addicted,
like most of the
games playing
•  Some people are meant to become doctors, lawyers and other such high
pressure occupations, others just play ﬁendish puzzle games in the small hours
of the morning, we call them 'vegetables'l
population, there are also extra
credits allowing for a same screen
restart anyway, but when they run out
it is beginningsville for you.
There are absolutely tons of
levels, the ﬁrst few being very easy
indeed, all split into real levels and
sub-levels. There are 8 real levels
with more sub-levels being available
per real level (ie. level 1 has 4 sub-
levels, level 8 has 64) so there'll be
plenty of brain sapping fun to be had
for those with a rather masochistic
taint.
But Puzznic, on the later levels, is
so ﬁendishly difﬁcult that your head
can really start to ache, and the worst
thing about this is that it has that "Oh
damn. Just one more go, I'll get it
right this time" kind of
addictiveness. It's advisable that
you don't play this too close to
your bedtime, so you won't
be up half the night trying
to right the silly mistakes
that you make (and if
you,re like me, you make
even more mistakes
when you,re slightly
dozey).
Graphically is not as
impressive as its
stablemate, but is twice
as cunning. If your into
the more arcade kind of
game, I'd probably steer well
clear, it'd only infuriate you. But
if you liked Tetris, Klax, or any of
the current trend of puzzle games,
you won't get anything more
demading than Puzznic.

D
i d  you know that Subbuteo
has been around for 47
years? Neither did I, so the
question is; why am I reviewing an
old game? Well, the answer is.... I'm
not sure. But I am sure that
Subbuteo is now more popular than
ever before and that I'm still not sure
why Electronic Zoo has released a
computer simulation of a table-top
simulation of a real game. There
must be money in it. Oh that's it, I
know why I'm reviewing this product,
I'm being paid to - that's it ( that's
what you think -ED).
Of course, one reason why these
kind of games do so well on
computers is because you can play
the computer at it's own game and
don't need a friend to play against.
Although Subbuteo offers human
against human contests as well as
human against electronic wizardry.
When playing against the
Commodore you can choose the
computer's level of play from
amateur to International with league
slap-bang in the middle. I could just
about manage to score a few goals
in amateur mode. In league, I was a
walk over and on International the
computer just started laughing.
If you're not sure how you play
Subbuteo, here's what you do. All the
players are pseudo plastic
characters mounted in small plastic
domed bases, rather like Weebles.
What you do is ﬂick these players
with your ﬁnger towards the ball and

attempt to score a
goal or two. Each
player takes turns to
ﬂick and it's not a
free-
for-all
like
the real game with Gazza and the
rest of the boys (apparently the
England team took a few Subbuteo
games to the world cup so that they
could play without Bobby Robson's
stupid tactics) There's a knack to
playing the tabletop version of the
game and the same rule applies to
the C64 game. Talking of rules, the
computer version adheres to the
rules as laid down by the Football
International Subbuteo Association
(ELSA) and will vary somewhat from
those of the Football Association.
You can choose your team's
formation from the few that are given
by the computer. These are 4-3-3, 4-
2-4, 4-4-2 and 2-3-5. The formation
you choose at the beginning will
remain throughout the game without
any opportunity to change it.
Fax
Load of Balls
Subbuteo is a table-top simulation
of Football. Football is an
international game which involves
two teams of 11 players on a ﬁeld
marked with white paint. The
players have a ball which they try
to kick into each other's goal.
To limit the chances of each
player, the game is governed by a
time limit, both on the player (to
prevent time wasting) and on the
game as a whole. Each player gets
30 seconds to make his or her or it's
ﬂick and the game can be played
over a selectable time of up to 90
minutes (45 minutes each way) but if
you prefer you can play for just 10
minutes. If a player does not make a
ﬂick in the 30 seconds a penalty
indirect free kick is awarded.
Once you have selected the
player to be ﬂicked you get a
directional pointer which circles that
player so that you position your
"ﬁnger" for the ﬂick. From here on
you get to control the strength of the
shot using a power bar which rises
until you stop it. Then you get to
control the spin on the player using
another bar which rises. This one has
a half way marker. Flick at this and
your player should head straight.
Below the mid point and
he'll veer off to the right
and above, to the left.
The goal keepers in the
game are computer
controlled and will try to
anticipate shots and try
to save them.
Subbuteo certainly is
a strange game on both
the table-top and
keyboard. I quite
enjoyed my few games
against the computer but
would much rather put A .
my skills (minimal as
Subbuteo - it's ﬂickin paradise,
mat&
they are) up against another player.

What's large and growing,
resides in the wilds of the
west country and has the
initial's MP? No it's not
Michael Parkinson, nor the
military police or a Member
of Parliament - it is, of
course, MicroProse. We
sent Andy Banner along to
see what dirt he could dig...
A
them than through the loud
shirt of Martin Moth, one of
MP's games designers. Martin is
wearing a colourful number up-top,
and is often overcome by the
insatiable urge to take his scrambler
off road and beat the hell out of a
chicken farm. But Martin is a quiet
fellow at heart, just don't let him near
your drum kit!
From tiny acorns, mighty oaks
grow. Well, Wild Bill Stearly certainly
sowed his seeds well over here.
MicroProse began in 1982 in the
good ole U.S of A. Bill Steady and
Sid Mier were at their local coin-op
arcade one day when Sid pointed
out a gun-em-down dogﬁght game.
"I could write you something better
than that." Bold claims, but in not
much time Sid had come up with
Hellcat Ace for the Atari 800. Bill
liked it and placed a few classiﬁed
adverts in computer mags. It's sold
very well and one day his wife took a
call from a "distributor".
"Can you supply 5000?"
"Well, yes I suppose so,"
"What discount will I get?"
Cripes, what's this about
discount? Micro Prose had
been born. Hellcat
Ace found it's way
on to the shelves
of computer shops
in developed
countries and Wales.
What has happened
since then? A bloody
lot.
Micro Prose UK
was started by Stewart
Bell in 1986. It began as
a one man operation
from his home in
A BUNCH 9F.
OLD PROSE
Chalford, just a
few miles
from Micro Prose's new plush ofﬁces
in the quaint and picturesque town of
Tetbury, Gloucestershire From those
humble beginnings it grew and
ﬂourished and bedded itself into new
ofﬁces in the centre of Tetbury.
But Micro Prose UK was just a
British agent for Yanky (I said Yanky)
software. Surely us Brits can write
games as well. After-all it was us lot
that came up with the utterly brilliant
(?) idea of Horace Goes Skiing! But
Micro Prose were going to be no
pushover when it came to accepting
games for publication. Micro Style
and Micro Status labels were
launched in April 1989 to broaden
the scope of the company. Games
such as RVF Honda and Stunt Car
Racer were to become hits.
In an expected move, British
Telecom announced it's plans to off
load Telecomsoft. The speculation
mounted se e me d  certain that
Telecomsoft would go to the plump
Robert Maxwell his huge empire (and
Mirrorsoft). Some cheque writing and
hand shaking later and Rainbird,
Firebird and Silverbird were securely
in the hands of Micro Prose. This all
happened in May 1989.
Take it away, Martin, "We then
took over Telecomsoft, and all of a
sudden we had ﬁve labels, which is a
bit much for anybody."
Five? Well, it's not that many
actually. Hold on, Micro Prose, Micro

Status, Micro Style, Rainbird, Firebird
and S ilv e r
Martin, "Because we are not a
budget company, we deliberately
didn't have any dealings with
Silverbird at all, so it effectively
stopped trading when we took it over.
"Firebird was always a slightly
budget label. We don't believe
ourselves as being budget so we will
be phasing out Firebird software."
Oft
Reiterating he said, "We will not be
developing software for Firebird,
there are a few games in the pipeline
- like Fire & Brimstone." I got the
feeling that there would not be a glut
of Firebird games in the future as
there was when BT owned it.
Are there to be any budget games
from Micro Prose? A steadfast "No,
none at all" came the immediate
reply so don't expect to be able to
buy Red Storm Rising for E2.99 in the
next year. However, Silverbird
software may appear at some time in
the future but the releases will be of
old budget software and will not be
cheaper versions of any Micro Prose
game.
Just as MicroProse UK publish
software that originated in America,
Bill's lot over there will publish games
,,ascﬂESE
t
developed over here, but only a
choice few. Why? Ain't our stuff good
enough then?
Micro Prose has a reputation for
producing quality games; games that
are playable, enjoyable and
addictive. Such is Mid Winter, and
Weird Dreams. I can't comment how
some software houses work, but I'm
almost convinced that many don't
test the games before they start
charging loadsadosh for a damn
awful piece of tat. You won't get that
from Micro Prose. It employs a
number of full-time games testers
who's sole jobs are to sit on their
arses and play the games non-stop.
Don't get the idea it's easy either.
They liaise directly with the software
developers telling them how the
game plays and report on any bugs
they might ﬁnd. If the game is as
exciting as a night out with Janet
Street-Porter then the programmer is
told so. One poor chap had been
playing Mid Winter for about a month
when I spoke to him but he didn't
complain. It's lucky for him that he
doesn't work at Activisionl
MicroProse also has a team of in-
house programmers who work in
conjunction with the games testers.
So no game leaves the
MicroProse ofﬁces without having
been thoroughly tested. While the
games testers sit over a hot
computer every day, next door the
design department sit at the drawing
board, drawing. Micro Prose designs
it's own posters, adverts and boxes
in-house to improve on efﬁciency.
The rear of MicroProse's building
boasts a huge stonking 20,000
square foot warehouse, piled high
with software goodies. This gives the
marketing and sales departments the
necessary resources to be able to
ship orders within the day.
Yes, yes but what can C64
readers expect to see now? Well,
MicroProse has already released
Weird Dreams, the popular arcade
fantasy game and P47 Thunderbolt,
the JaiIco coin-op conversion this
year on the C64. To come for the
Christmas market is the utterly,
utterly brilliant Rick Dangerous 2
which is likely to held away from the
number one spot buy awful ﬁlm
licences and coin-op conversions.
The Trail should also be in the
shops by Christmas. This is a tail of a
power struggle in medieval times. It
was described to me as being
everything that Defender of the
Crown should have been. There's a
lot to this game and although it hasn't
got all the pretty pictures of Defender
of the Crown, it's got much more in-
depth gameplay and strategies. Up to
four players can play and optional
arcade style battle sequences can be
used to spice up the action.
So there you have MicroProse, a
company who began with simulations

you only have to be about 18 months
old to remember the original game.
Rick Dangerous Ills the kind of
platform game that I really like. Good
graphics, great sound effects and a
real element of humour. Matched
with puzzles galore and a great deal
of skill, Rick Dangerous II beats the
life out of other platformers.
Rick Ills bigger and better than
ever before. Rick's dress has been
brought up to date - well, he now
looks like something out of a sixties
rock group and bears more than a
passing resembelance to Flash
hotwires the craftiand blasts off for
the planet Bart in search of the Fat
Guy.
The cost of petrol was at an all
time high when The Fat Guy ﬁlled up
this spaceship and he only had a
Gordon, it's the blonde quiff that
does it! The ardened explorer hasn't
aged much though and he's still a
ugly as ever.
The storyline is that Rick has
returned from saving London from a
fate worse than the Tory party only to
ﬁnd that Hyde Park has been
invaded by ﬂying saucers.
Determined to get to the bottom of
this alien visitation he trecks to the
Royal park and inﬁltrates one of the
ships. The defences on the
underside of the saucer are a bit
mean,Ispecially for the ﬁrst screen. A
bit of experimenting here soon sees
you to the boarding ladder where a
robot in on patrol and determined to
see off any unwelcome strays. Bang!
and he squeals
with pain and
leaps off the
screen. Once in
the ship, the
puzzles begin,
easy at ﬁrst but

progressively
more difﬁcult as
you get into

water. At the end
of the level, Rick

ﬁver in his jeans so Rick ﬁnds that
the ship runs out of fuel and crash
lands on the ice planet of Freezia. At
the end of the Freezia level Rick tries
to teleport directly to the Fat Guy's
hideout but fails, miserably. Rick
then ﬁnds himself falling through the
trees of the world of Vegatabilia.
Level four sees Rick embark upon
his toughest quest yet as he heads
for the Atomic Mud Mines beneath
the Fat Guy's HQ.
In between levels, there's a short,
funny, cartoon ﬁlm of the next
situation which is a great touch to
the game. The mud mines are great,
the most humourous of all the levels.
Mud Monsters roam the caverns
moving from place to place nearly
invisibly through the mud and then
slomp! The Ice level contains the

However you can play any of the
other four levels in any order as you
can choose which one to play at the
beginning.
Rick Dangerous is just great,
fabby, stonkingly good in fact. You'll
not ﬁnd a better platform game this
Christmas and unless there's a Rick
III, I doubt whether you'll see a better
game next year either.

you encounter weird oil drums that
suddenly get up and ﬂatten you.
To make life easier, your bombs
have been updated and you can now
slide them along the ﬂoor before they
explode. This means that in difﬁcult
situations you can lob the bomb and
it will blast the guy on the level
below.
The ﬁfth and ﬁnal level sees Rick
inconspicuously enter the Fat Guy's
hideout. From the ﬁrst part of this
level, it's tough. But to get to this
stage you must have completed the

shooty to beat all shooties (or at least that's what Storm said during a recent visit), and if it looks as good
hen YC saw it we'll be forced to agree. It looks as if it'll be a real stonker 'cause it is the fastest, most

ing the idea from Silkworm (but deﬁnitely not the name, no siree) it allows two players to take part, one in a
copter and one in a tank. The helicopter can ﬂy over all the obstacles and the tank, er, can't. There are end-of-

To add to confusion Activision will

Dragon Spirit (Domark) and St

like the latter than anything else. But
unlike St Dragon, you aren't the

BADLANDS
TENGEN
The ofﬁcial sequel to Super Sprint,
and another Tengen arcade
conversion, Badlands is the
one we've been waiting for for
absolutely yonks! It is very like
the original Super Sprint in the
respect that you have a car,
you are racing against other
cars, the action is displayed
from top-down and the whole
of the track is seen on one
screen. Apart from that there
are many new features that
make it even more playable
than the original.
For a start it's based in the
near future and typically after
the nukes have made
wasteland of the Earth.
Tooccupy themselves, the
post apocalyptic inhabitants
(before you even ask, Posty
has told me that this is not the
favourite sport in the future, his
is ﬂower pressing) have
constructed large racing tracks,
but these tracks are not the legal
safe kind that you ﬁnd at
Silverstone.
To help you in this sport of
imminent death, you've got
missiles and extra things that you
can buy in the shop to help you
stay alive, and even win the races.
And that's about it. It's programmed
by Toque (famous for loads of
product, such as Space Harrier II and
Manchester United), and we should
see it in November.
N A V Y  S E A L S
VC recently got a look at one of Ocean's Christmas
releases and boy, were we impressed. At ﬁrst glance we were sure that it was the ST version of the game based
on the ﬁlm with Charlie Sheen and Michael Biehn, but nope sitting there behind his trusty See Sixty Four was
Johnny Meegan (the programmer of NS and other such games as Rastan and The Untouchables). "Listen to the
muzak" he said, so we did and we were awed. "Look at the graphics" he said, so we did and we were stunned.
"Jump out the window" he said, and because we were so awed and stunned we found ourselves lying in a
Manchester back alley with blood and phlegm caked to our faces.But seriously this is one cooking platform,
puzzle, shoot-em-up with extra munchy bits. There are six levels in which you must wander around and charge
the stinger missiles that have been left, in order to blow a few
undesirables off of this planet. But
you can't do this in any old order
(you'll get your nuptials blown off
if you try), you have to ﬁnd the
pattern in which to complete it.
This game is only going to be
available on cartridge, and
therefore t a price of about £20,
but if cartridge games allow them
to be as good as this, b u y  that
for 30 dollars (allowing for
ﬂuctuating exchange rates).

bloody 'ate acronyms me, they ﬂy
around taking away peoples teeth and
being mischievous amongst daisies
and buttercups, er, what was that? Oh
that's what it means, I bloody 'ate them
an'all!
Elite Special Weapons And Tactics,
that's what E-SWAT stands for, why?
Frankly Frank I don't give a poodles
whatsit! What we do know is that this
is gonna be one of US Gold's
Christmas releases, and is most likely
to be in the Chrissy top ten.
It's a beat-em-up and shoot-em-up
and arcade adventure style of game all
rolled into one and you must (along
with a friend if you like) progress along
the levels (15 in all) dispense the
Glasgee kiss to all and Rip e r (Fragged
Up Beyond All Recognition) the end of
level guardian (let's face it he's Spam!).
Thalamus
C R
•••••
Okay, let's face it. When whoever created the universe dished out the bodies,
he was not all that fair, was he? After all, he wouldn't have made one lot of
creatures more cute than another if he was. But that's what he's done to the
Creatures in this cutesy game from Thalamus.
As a Creature with scouting tendencies, you take it into your head that you
should be the one who searches for the food. So off you trek into the woods to
pick berries. On your return, you ﬁnd that a race of particularly nasty and
uncute Demons has kidnapped the entire village! Oh no!
Luckily you are also the bravest Creature in history and, armed with nothing
but the barest of magic missiles, you follow the trail that the Demons have
rather stupidly left you and decide to rescue the others from their lives of
to
Creatures is basically another cute platform game. Your hero is a great little fellow who looks like a cross between a
Gremlin and a teddy bear. He wanders around the landscape with a determined look on his little chops and lobs magic
missiles with carefree abandon. They curve into the ground quite close to the Creature but upgrades can be bought, more we ll
on that later.
As you explore the landscape you won't be able to help but notice the myriad of Demons. Despite their Hellish 
g
r
a
p
upbringing they are fairly cute too, but don't let their looks deceive you - they are every bit as deadly as their ﬁery (and ugly)plaw
cousins. Contact with a Demon means one thing - death - and an exclaimation of disgust or pain or surprise (very much likereacl
FRAK!, for anyone who can remember it) from the heroic Creature, before the next life comes in.

Hello again from Castello
Audlogenic. Ash here again and,
under extreme pressure from Gary
Sheinwold, I've been forced to tell
you how good another of the
Harrovians' games are. So here
goes. Put the kettle down Gary_
Loopz looks set to make history,
as the ﬁrst ever game to be
converted to the arcades from
home computer instead of the
other way around. However, an
all-time fave game of mine,
Boulderdash, was the ﬁrst I
thought. Still, perhaps I won't
say that whilst Gary's looking
through in one piece. This ain't
gonna be easy though. 'cos
there are loads of Demons
literally crawling over every
available surface. There are
jellybean like Demons,
Demons with seriously bad breath, Demons
with (gasp) warts and some that are even
un-cute! A few even inhabit Demonic hot air
balloons and drop bombs onto you!
Getting through a level is rewarded with
a visit to a shop. There a witch will mix up
the baby Demons that you have collected
from the level (what baby Demons? The
little ones that don't move of course!). Providing that you have enough baby
Demons she can mix them up into a magic spell to grant you better weapons.
These include ones that ﬂy straight, ones that curve upwards, swirling ones and a
huge ﬂame thrower that blasts them back to Hell.
Every so often there is a torture screen. This is where your efforts can really be
rewarded, because one of your folk is being tortured. To rescue him you need to
solve a graphical puzzle. In one, for example, there is a Creature on a platform that
is being pumped up by a Demon. If it gets too high then the swinging axe above it
will chop your chum. To remove the Demon, you'll need to shoot him with a
cannon, but how do you get the cannonball into it?
Creatures was programmed by the same team that did Retrograde for
Thalamus way back at the begining of the year. They are hopeful that Creatures
will be even bigger, because it will appeal to platform freaks and cute lovers as
well as shoot-em-up fans.
The whole game features music that runs along behind it, and loads of lovely
graphics. Gameplay is very addictive, with just the right level of difﬁculty to
playability. Deﬁnately a game worth forking out for, though non-cute lovers will be
reaching (literally) for the bucket. Look out for this one - don't let it get forgotten in
the big names race at Christmas. Put Creatures way up on Santa's list and you'll
be playing it well into 1991.

so mean.
I think the exclusivity of it is that
it's being made into a skill with prizes
game too. Okay, so that's never been
done before. So what of the game?
Well, as you might be forgiven for
assuming the game involves loops.
Not just any old loops, these are
special. How? Well, because you
have to make them from what look
like bits of old pipe. In fact the whole
game's feel reminded me of
Pipemania (sorry Gazz, but it did -
just a little bit anyway).
According to the game type
selected and the skill level, you have
a limited amount of time to place
each pipe that is randomly given to
you by the computer. You can move
it around the screen to place it and
rotate it. Holding down the ﬁre
button and pushing right rotates the
shape and pushing left drops it into
place.
The catch is that if the time runs
out before you place the piece you
lose a life. At the highest level you
only get 1.5 seconds to think so you
can see the problem! Completing a
loop with the straight, corner, I-
shaped and z-shaped pieces is
rewarded by the loop disappearing
and a score for the loop being
awarded. This varies according to
how big the loop is and how
crowded the screen is. Big is
beautiful in Loopz.

moving ofﬁce. Still, he was
accommadating enough,
despite the coffee which
tasted like mud - or worse!
Exterminator is
Audiogenic's ﬁrst ever
arcade conversion. The
game is basically a fantasy
story set in modern times.
The insects are fed up with
being used as ﬁsh bait and,
in some of the more extreme
and barbaric Northern
software houses, food, and
are at last ﬁghting back.
Along the way they've
recruited the help of toy
tanks too.
Armed with nothing but
your ﬁsts and a ﬂy spRAY
gun you have to
decontaminate all of the
houses in a street room by
room. On the ﬂoor of each
room there is a chessboard
style pattern. Well, you know
what the ideal home
exhibition has done for
fashion. This pattern is yet
stranger because it is
An annoying little ditty tinkles
along in the background - in fact
there are three tunes to choose from.
There are also two other types of
game. The ﬁrst is not really like
Loopz at all, and also is a bonus
stage in the game proper. There is a
pre-deﬁned pattern that gets
randomly destroyed, and you have to
rebuild it. Looks a bit boring, that
does.
The third is the most interesting
because its the one that the arcade
consoles will use. Every time you
complete ten loops the game speeds
up. Every 25 loops an extra life is
Audiogenic
Bugs, bugs, bugs. The Audiogenic
carpets are full of them...
What was I doing in Harrow on a
cold autumn morning, armed with
nothing but a joystick and a can of
Floret? Well, to be honest I didn't
really know what to expect when
Peter Calver of Audiogenic called me
up to be an Exterminator. Inthgued, I
went off in search of some really
nasty creepy crawlies. Peter wasn't in
however, so I had to make do with
Gary Sheinwold instead.
He was in bouyant mood, still
recovering from an apendix
op and in the process of
awarded.
Loopz
looks very
nice, plays
well and is
quite
ston kingly
addictive. It's
bound to
wake up
puzzle freaks
whilst they
wait for
Boulderdash
V and Tetris 3
appear.
EXTERMINATOR
constantly moving towards you.
When a tile hits the bottom of the
screen it wraps back around to the
top again, just like the escalators in
Marks and Spencers.
As the nestles come in towards
you, you can kill them in a variety of
ways. Shooting them is nice and
satisfying, and crushing them in your
hand can be fun (and painful at
times), but the main method of killing
is the ﬁst slam. This squashes the
creatures onto the tiles, and turns the
tile to your colour. If you complete a
line of tiles then the level is over and
you have to go to the next.
It's fun, frantic and quite squirmy.
The graphics are great, with suitably
crawly creatures running around
everywhere. Sound is sampled
directly from the 16-bit version which,
according to Gary, is "Very rare
indeed". So expect the squishes,
screams of pain (as you get stung
and your energy is depleted) and
buzzing sound effects to be state-of-
the-art.
If Audiogenic's ﬁrst attempt at an
arcade licence is anything to go by
then they'll be doing a few more in
their time. I wish the same could be
said of most companies who do
arcade conversions. Right on,
Exterminator
