optimizing performance
Editing video is memory- and processor-intensive work for a computer. A fast 
processor and a lot of RAM will make your editing experience faster and more effi-
cient; 4 GB of RAM is the minimum, and 8 GB or more is best for high-definition 
(HD) media. Adobe CS6 Production Premium takes advantage of multicore proces-
sors on Windows and Macintosh systems.
A dedicated 7200 RPM or faster hard drive is recommended for HD media.  
A RAID 0 striped disk array or SCSI disk subsystem is strongly recommended for 
HD. Performance will be significantly affected if you attempt to store media files 
and program files on the same hard drive. Be sure to keep your media files on a 
second drive if at all possible.
The Mercury Playback Engine in Adobe Premiere Pro and the Global Performance 
Cache in Adobe After Effects can operate in software-only mode or GPU accelera-
tion mode. The GPU acceleration mode provides significant performance improve-
ment. GPU acceleration is possible with select video cards. You can find a list of 
these video cards on the Adobe website at www.adobe.com/products/premiere/
tech-specs.html.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 5
Copying the lesson files
The lessons in Adobe Creative Suite 6 Production Premium Classroom in a Book
use specific source files, such as video clips, audio files, and image files created 
in Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Illustrator CS6. To complete the lessons in 
this book, you must copy all the files from the Adobe Creative Suite 6 Production 
Premium Classroom in a Book DVD (inside the back cover of this book) to your 
hard drive. You’ll need about 11.3 GB of total storage space. This includes 780 MB 
for the file from the DVD in addition to the 10.5 GB you need to install Adobe CS6 
Production Premium. It is also recommended that you have at least 10 GB of addi-
tional storage space for disk cache, preview files, and other working files.
Although each lesson stands alone, some lessons use files from other lessons, so 
you’ll need to keep the entire collection of lesson assets on your hard drive as you 
work through the book. Here’s how to copy those assets from the DVD to your 
hard drive:
1 Open the Adobe Creative Suite 6 Production Premium Classroom in a Book 
DVD in My Computer or Windows Explorer (Windows) or in Finder (Mac OS).

relinking the lesson files
It is possible that the file path to the lesson files may need to be updated.
If you open an Adobe Premiere Pro project and it cannot find a media file, a dialog 
may open and ask Where is the File MEDIA.mov? If this happens, you’ll need to 
navigate to one of the offline files to reconnect. Once you’ve reconnected one file in 
the project, the rest should reconnect.
If you open an Adobe After Effects project and it cannot find a media file, a window 
will open telling you that a number of files are missing. Look through your Project 
panel to find italicized filenames of imported media. Double-click on each of these 
filenames and navigate to the offline files to reconnect them. To find the files:
• You can navigate to the same location where you put the files you copied from 
the DVD. You may need to look in some of the included folders to find the 
media file.
• You can use the search field in the OS dialog to search for the file by name.
When you locate a file, just select it and click the Open button.
how to use these lessons
Each lesson in this book provides step-by-step instructions for creating one or 
more specific elements of a real-world project. The lessons stand alone, but most of 
them build on previous lessons in terms of concepts and skills. So, the best way to 
learn from this book is to proceed through the lessons in sequential order.
The organization of the lessons is workflow-oriented rather than feature-oriented, 
and the book uses a real-world approach. The lessons follow the typical sequential 
steps that creative media makers use to complete a project, starting with script 
writing, acquiring video, laying down a cuts-only sequence, adding effects, creat-
ing a motion graphic sequence, sweetening the audio track, color-correcting video 
clips, and ultimately exporting the project to the web, a portable device, a DVD, a 
Blu-ray Disc, or Flash.

A final motion graphic created in Adobe After Effects CS6.  
Using the applications in the Adobe CS6 Production Premium, 
you’ll assemble raw sample video footage and a music track 
into a rough cut, add some visual effects, animate a motion 
graphic, create a final audio mix, and then generate exports 
of the final video.

lesson 1 Working in Adobe Creative suite 6 Production Premium
the “planning to playback” video-
production workflow
The tools for creating and broadcasting a professional-quality video have never 
been as accessible as they are today, thanks to more affordable and accessible 
recording equipment and computers, broadband Internet, and user-friendly software.
Adobe Creative Suite 6 Production Premium offers industry-standard applications 
for project organization, video and audio editing, animation, and final encoding  
for delivery.
The lessons in this book take you through the process of creating a promotional 
video for the San Francisco-based music collective Afrolicious, featuring an inter-
view with the band leader and DJ, Joey. Assets provided include interviews, music 
clips, and footage from a recording session and from a live performance. Using all 
of the applications in the Adobe CS6 Production Premium, you’ll assemble the  
raw video footage and a music track into a rough cut, add some visual effects, ani-
mate a motion graphic, create a final audio mix, and then generate exports of the 
final video.
This book is intended for those who have some experience in part or all of the  
creative process or who have never used the Adobe Creative Suite. After complet-
ing these lessons, you’ll have a basic understanding of the creative process and how 
the applications in Adobe CS6 Production Premium can play an integral role in 
that process.
The creative process of making a broadcast-quality video consists of three phases— 
preproduction, production, and postproduction. Each phase has its own procedures.
Preproduction
In preproduction you generate all of the big-picture ideas and concepts, and 
establish general creative guidelines and styles. Once you formulate a concept, you 
then write your scripts and draw your storyboards. These will serve as your points 
of reference as you proceed to the production phase. As a result, preproduction 
can be the most creative phase of the entire process, and it will establish a general 
direction for all work to follow.
In Chapter 2 you’ll learn how to use Adobe Story to create and format a film script.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 13
Production
In the production phase you shoot any video footage and record any audio that is 
unique to a given project. This is also when you gather additional media—stock 
images, logo graphics, music and sound effects—that you want to include in your 
project. Just as much care and planning should go into the production phase as the 
preproduction phase because without good video, audio, and other media to work 
with, the next phase of the creative process cannot happen.
Also in Chapter 2 you’ll learn how to use Adobe Prelude CS6 to ingest raw footage 
to your computer’s hard drive, which is a task that, thanks to video cameras with 
tapeless media, is now possible during the production phase.
Postproduction
When you have all of your raw media, you are ready to put all of the pieces together. 
Postproduction is when you edit your video, mix your audio, animate your motion 
graphics, generate final composites, apply color-correcting techniques, output your 
final video master file, compress your video for web and mobile devices, and deliver 
your final output to the client or end user.
The lessons in this book use raw video footage and audio that has already been  
created and provided for you, and primarily focus on the postproduction phase:
• In Chapter 3 you’ll create a rough edit of your movie with Adobe Premiere Pro.
• In Chapter 4 you’ll refine your Adobe Premiere Pro edit by applying video 
effects and transitions.
• In Chapter 5 you’ll edit a layered image with Adobe Photoshop Extended and 
convert that layered image into a motion graphic with Adobe After Effects. 
You’ll add this motion graphic to your edit in Adobe Premiere Pro.
• In Chapter 6 you’ll refine your motion graphics sequences in Adobe After 
Effects by adding a vector graphic from Adobe Illustrator.
• In Chapter 7 you’ll create a final audio mix with Adobe Audition.
• In Chapter 8 you’ll use Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe SpeedGrade to apply 
color-correcting techniques. You’ll also use Adobe Media Encoder to export 
your final edit for optimized playback on multiple devices.
• In Chapter 9 you’ll use Adobe Encore to create a DVD menu for your movie that 
can be mastered to a standard DVD. You’ll also use Adobe Flash Professional  
to apply a media playback skin so that your final movie can be embedded in a 
web page.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 15
The lessons in this book touch on all of these applications to help you become 
familiar with them; however, they do not go deeply into using each one. Rather, this 
book focuses on the recommended workflows and the right tools for the job when 
using the applications together for your video projects. You’ll learn video-making 
concepts along the way, and this book will point out other Classroom in a Book
titles for your reference if you want more in-depth information on particular Adobe 
software applications.
understanding the Creative suite user interface
Although each application performs a different function and features differ-
ent tools, the overall look and feel of the applications in Adobe CS6 Production 
Premium share many common elements. We’ll touch on these elements here, but 
you’ll learn more about each one in context with the particular application covered 
while going through the lessons in the book:
• Toolbars. Each application has its own set of tools located in a toolbar at  
the top of the interface. The Selection, Hand, Zoom, Pen, and Type tools all 
work the same way across the suite. By hovering your cursor over a tool in  
the toolbar, you can see a tool tip that shows the keyboard shortcut to access 
the tool.
• Workspaces. All CS6 applications have customizable workspaces that allow 
you to move interface panels to fit your needs, as well as convenient presets for 
commonly used workspaces.

16 
lesson 1 Working in Adobe Creative suite 6 Production Premium
• Timelines. Time-based applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, 
Audition, Encore, Prelude, and Flash all have a Timeline panel that enables you 
to play back and quickly scan through layers or footage by adjusting a current 
time indicator (CTI).
• Layers. Image applications like Photoshop 
Extended and Illustrator allow a single image 
document to contain a stack of multiple layers 
of image data; each can have its own unique 
settings. After Effects compositions also use 
layers as objects stacked in a Timeline.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 17
• Folders and bins. These are commonly used across Adobe CS6 Production 
Premium to organize project media within an application.
using Dynamic Link
Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Encore all feature Dynamic Link, which 
enables you to send project elements between applications without any intermedi-
ate rendering. This greatly speeds your workflow and saves you time.
For example, if you create a motion graphic in After Effects and want to add it 
to a sequence in Adobe Premiere Pro, you can import the raw unrendered After 
Effects composition into your Adobe Premiere Pro project. Any changes you make 
to the After Effects composition reflect automatically in your Adobe Premiere Pro 
sequence. This is explained in further detail in Chapter 5.
You can also send your projects from Adobe Premiere Pro to Encore using 
Dynamic Link without rendering or saving an intermediate file. You’ll learn more 
about this in Chapter 9.
Working with media files in video production
It’s important to know the difference between the types of media files and the ideal 
applications you use to edit them:
• Video clips are movie files that originate from a video camera or exist as 
prerendered animations or other edited videos. Typical formats for these 
include .mov, .mp4, and .avi. These are typically used in Adobe Premiere Pro, 
After Effects, Encore, Flash, and Prelude.

18 
lesson 1 Working in Adobe Creative suite 6 Production Premium
• Audio clips are audio files that usually contain music, sound effects, and voice-
over recordings. Typical formats for audio clips include .aiff, .wav, and .mp3. 
Although these can be used in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Flash as 
raw media, editing and mixing of audio clips should be done in Audition. Be 
advised that .aiff and .wav allow for uncompressed audio data, whereas .mp3 is 
 a compressed format and should not be used for raw audio in your edits.
• Bitmap images are still images that are pixel-based and are typically photographs 
or still frames from video. Some bitmap image file formats include .jpg, .tif, 
.png, and .tga. There are a few factors to consider when using one bitmap image 
format over another. For instance, consider whether you need a bitmap image 
format that supports layers (.psd and .tiff support layers, whereas .jpg, .png and 
.tga do not); whether you need a bitmap image format that supports embedded 
transparency, also referred to as an alpha channel (.psd, .tif, .png, and .tga 
do, whereas .jpg does not); and whether the format supports uncompressed 
image data (.psd, .tif, .png, and .tga do, whereas .jpg does not). You should 
use Photoshop to edit bitmap image files. Photoshop’s native .psd format can 
contain layers, alpha channels, and uncompressed image data.
• Vector images are still images or graphics that are vector based, meaning 
they are resolution independent. Because of this versatility, vector images are 
typically used for logo graphics. Typical vector image formats are .eps and the 
Adobe Illustrator native format, .ai. You should use Illustrator to create or edit 
vector images. By default, Adobe Illustrator CS6 will save graphics as a .ai file, 
which may not be compatible on systems that don’t have Adobe Illustrator 
installed. However, because the .eps format is not application-specific, these 
images are good to use as deliverable vector images.
video format compatibility
Some video files will not play back on your system if the appropriate software is not 
installed. Formats like .avi and .wmv were developed for playback on the Windows 
operating system and may not play back on Mac OS X. Apple’s .mov format is native 
to the Apple QuickTime media player, and the .mp4 format is cross-platform. They 
each have different ways of storing video data, which may result in compatibility 
issues when transferring from one device to another. Fortunately, Apple QuickTime 
can be downloaded to Windows and Linux machines to provide them with the  
ability to play .mov files. Media players like VLC by VideoLAN are available for down-
load on Mac computers to provide support for Windows-based .avi files. Adobe 
Premiere Pro CS6 is able to edit nearly any type of video file that is playable on your 
computer, and Adobe Media Encoder can convert these playable media files into a 
grand array of different formats.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 19
Codecs and extensions
The video codec, as its etymology “compressor-decompressor” indicates, com-
presses information into a convenient file and then later reverses the process by 
decompressing the data for interpretation by a playback system. Codecs are like  
languages; if your computer does not have a specific codec installed, it will not be 
able to read or write in that particular language. As newer codecs introduce better 
ways of encoding and decoding media, older codecs become antiquated and are 
less commonly used. The most commonly used codec for video sharing today is 
H.264, which is rooted in the cross-platform MPEG-4 format. Unlike other codecs 
that were developed for one specific usage, H.264 is renowned for its versatility 
among web, mobile, Blu-ray, and high-definition recording.
A video’s codec relates to its file extension, but they are not synonymous. A video 
file’s extension (like .mp4, .mov, .avi) reflects how data is stored and organized 
within its file. The container format also determines how the metadata and audio/
video components interrelate. A container format like .mov can be encoded in one 
of many different codecs. Therefore, the extension does not describe how the file 
is encoded and decoded but rather how the data is internally structured. Both the 
codec and the file extension are elements that have a direct impact on the quality 
and the accessibility of a file.
You’ll learn more about the importance of compression and file formats when 
exporting files in Chapter 8. 
Adobe Photoshop Extended and Adobe Illustrator documents (.psd and .ai,  
respectively) exist as self-contained files. As new layers and additional graphics  
are introduced into these multilayered documents, their file sizes will, in turn,  
get larger.
However, link-based project files, like those generated by Adobe Premiere Pro, 
After Effects, Encore, and Flash, are not self-contained and act as “hubs” for all 
related project media. Project files exist separately from media files on your com-
puter. This means that for a project file to function properly, it must be linked with 
all related media on your system.
Self-contained files, like .psd or .ai, can be moved from system to system and edited 
without requiring linkage to any other media files. Link-based project files, like 
those used by Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Encore, and Flash, do require 
active links to all associated media files. When you’re working with link-based 
project files, it’s best to store all associated media in a local project folder accompa-
nied by the project files. This will make it easier to move projects between systems 
without breaking links to the media files.

20 
lesson 1 Working in Adobe Creative suite 6 Production Premium
Linking a project with media files
Let’s do an exercise that will give you a glimpse of working with Adobe Premiere 
Pro CS6 and also show you how to link a project to media files. Make sure you’ve 
copied the Adobe CS6 Assets folder from the DVD to your hard drive.
1 Launch Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. You’ll see the Welcome screen with a list of 
recently opened projects (if any) as well as three buttons at the bottom.
2 Click the Open Project button. Navigate to the Lesson 01 folder (Adobe 
CS6 Project Assets > Lessons > Lesson 01) on your hard drive. Select the 
Lesson_01 Start.prproj file and click Open.
The Adobe Premiere Pro user interface appears.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 21
At the bottom left you’ll see a Project panel with a list of folders (called bins) 
that have media organized in them. You’ll also see a Timeline panel at the 
bottom right that has clips in an edited sequence. The Timeline has a CTI that 
looks like a red vertical line with a yellow handle at the top. At the top right of 
the interface, you’ll see a Program Monitor that shows the frame of your edited 
sequence that the CTI is currently parked on.
3 Click on the CTI’s yellow handle and drag to the right, thereby moving through 
time in your sequence. This action is referred to as scrubbing. As you do this, 
notice that the Program Monitor shows many offline clips in the Timeline.
This is a fairly common occurrence, especially if a project file and project media 
have been copied to a different computer than the one on which the project 
originated. Although the project file opens and references to the media exist in 
the project, it still needs to be linked to all of the related media files for you to 
work with the media in the project.
Fortunately, link-based project files, like those from Adobe Premiere Pro and 
After Effects, allow you to easily fix the links in the project to the media files on 
your hard drive.
4 Using Finder on Mac OS X or Explorer on Windows, navigate to your Adobe 
CS6 Project Assets folder. Notice the subfolders for Audio, Exports, Footage, 
Graphics, and Lessons. It’s good working practice to keep all of your project-
related files organized so that they are easy to find when you need them.

22 
lesson 1 Working in Adobe Creative suite 6 Production Premium
5 Switch back to Adobe Premiere Pro.
If you have a project file open and you are about to make one or more changes 
to it, it’s also good working practice to save a version of your project file so that 
the older version is preserved in case you need to reference it later.
6 Choose File > Save As. Navigate to your Lesson 01 folder and type 
Lesson_01_Relinked in the Save As dialog. Then click the Save button.
Let’s fix the offline media links in this project. You’ll first open the bin for the 
offline media.
7 In the Project panel, double-click on the Live bin.
It will open as a floating panel in your interface and show a list of all of the Live 
clips, which are the ones currently offline. Notice that the icon next to each 
of these media files, or clips, currently looks like a document with a question 
mark, indicating that the media is offline.
E Tip: Press 
Command+Tab 
(Alt+Tab) to switch 
between open 
applications quickly.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 23
8 Because you need to relink all of these clips to files on your hard drive, select 
them all by pressing Command+A (Ctrl+A).
All of the clips in the bin will become highlighted, indicating that they are 
selected. Often, operations can only be performed on project items, such as 
clips in a bin or in the Timeline, if they are selected. On the other hand, it’s 
important to keep track of what is selected in your interface so that you don’t 
accidentally apply changes to them.
9 With all of the clips in the Live bin selected, choose Project > Link Media.
10 A file navigation window appears. Navigate to Adobe CS6 Project Assets > 
Footage, select Live_01.mp4, and click Open.
Conveniently, because all of these offline clips were in the same folder, relinking 
one of them relinks all of them.
11 Select the Live bin and press Command+W (Ctrl+W) to close it.
12 Now scrub the CTI through your Timeline. You should see that all of the Live 
clips have been relinked and now appear in your Program Monitor.
13 Press the Home key or scrub your CTI all the way to the left to go to the 
beginning of the edited sequence. Press the spacebar to play the sequence.
Note that there are a couple of clips in sequence that may not play back in real 
time, particularly the very last clip in the sequence. These are Dynamically 
Linked clips from Adobe After Effects, and they will be explained in 
forthcoming lessons in this book.
14 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your Adobe Premiere Pro project file.
You should now be familiar with the concept of linking a project file with 
project media on your system.
15 Choose Premiere Pro > Quit Premiere Pro (File > Exit) to quit Adobe Premiere 
Pro because you won’t need it for the remainder of this lesson.
E Tip: Press the 
spacebar to start 
and stop playback of 
a sequence in your 
Timeline.
E Tip: It’s a good idea 
to save your work often.

real-time playback and editing
Improvements in Adobe CS6 Production Premium yield speed enhancements  
to Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop Extended, and 
Adobe Illustrator.
the mercury Playback engine
The Mercury Playback Engine brought extraordinary performance and stability to 
Adobe Premiere Pro CS5 and CS5.5. In Adobe Premiere Pro CS6, performance and 
stability have been boosted yet again, thanks to optimizations and enhancements 
that let you smoothly play and scrub through multilayer, multiformat sequences 
that include HD, 5K, and even higher-resolution footage containing effects. The 
enhanced Mercury Playback Engine is dynamically scalable, natively 64-bit, GPU-
accelerated, and optimized for today’s multicore CPUs—and has improved support 
for third-party hardware. It delivers this kind of performance with or without 
a GPU. This allows you to work on dense, complex projects using a fast, GPU-
enabled workstation, and then bring them onto a lesser-powered computer and 
continue working without missing a beat.
To check whether you are using GPU acceleration in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6, 
under Video Rendering and Playback, choose Project > Project Settings > General.
Only systems with GPUs that support CUDA technology or OpenCL technology 
allow Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 to utilize the Mercury Playback Engine.
For more information on the Mercury Playback Engine and supported GPUs, go to 
www.adobe.com/products/premiere/mercury-playback-engine.html.

Global Performance Cache
The Global Performance Cache feature is a revolution “under the hood” that makes 
Adobe After Effects faster and more responsive by taking full advantage of your 
computer’s hardware. Global Performance Cache comprises a set of technologies:  
a global RAM cache, a persistent disk cache, and a new graphics pipeline.
The Global Performance Cache is covered in more depth in Chapter 5.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 25
mercury Graphics engine
The new Mercury Graphics Engine in Photoshop CS6 Extended uses the power of 
your computer’s GPU to speed up the performance of Photoshop. Many features 
in Photoshop Extended take advantage of the Mercury Graphics Engine, includ-
ing the all-new Crop tool, Puppet Warp, Liquify, Adaptive Wide Angle, and the 
Lighting Effects Gallery. Doing 3D work in Adobe RayTrace mode in Photoshop 
CS6 Extended is also quickened thanks to the Mercury Graphics Engine.
mercury Performance system
The new Mercury Performance System in Adobe Illustrator CS6 speeds up your 
workflow when creating and editing your vector graphics. Native 64-bit support 
on Mac OS and Windows provides access to all the available RAM on your system. 
Overall performance optimization is apparent when you open, save, and export 
large files. Previews are faster, and interaction in general is more responsive.
Creating a disk image to back 
up your system regularly
Your system hard drive holds your operating system files and your applications. 
After continual use of the applications, cached data and preference files tend to 
accumulate and slow your computer’s performance. It is recommended that you 
create an archive of your system hard drive that has a fresh install of the operating 
system and all regularly used applications. Such an archive can be saved as a disk 
image file on a separate hard drive.
To do this, you first create a fresh install of your operating system and applications 
on your system hard drive. Don’t copy any project files or media to your system 
drive after you do this. Your system drive should only have the operating system  
and applications, nothing else. Then you create an archive of your system drive.  
On Mac OS X, you can use Disk Utility to create a disk image of your system drive.  
On Windows, you can use the “Back up your files” feature to create a system image.
In the event that you’d need to restore your operating system and applications  
due to unbearably slow performance or a complete hard drive failure, all you’d  
need to do is simply restore your system drive from your system archive rather than 
be forced to spend time reinstalling your operating system and applications one at 
a time.
To go one step further, if your computer allows you to easily remove the physical 
system hard drive and replace it with another, it’s recommended that you have at 
least one spare hard drive that has your operating system and applications already 
installed on it. Restoring your system hard drive should be done monthly or on an 
otherwise regular basis.

review questions
1 What is the difference between a Timeline and a bin?
2 What is Dynamic Link?
3 What are some common file formats for video clips?
4 What is a codec? 
5 In Adobe Premiere Pro, how do you relink offline media in your project?
review answers
1 A bin is used to store raw project media that can be included in multiple Timelines, 
whereas a Timeline contains instances of project media that were added from bins.
2 Dynamic Link is a feature that enables users to send project elements between  
Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Encore without any intermediate rendering.
3 Common file formats for video clips include .mov, .avi, and .mp4.
4 A codec is a compression/decompression algorithm that allows a video file size  
to be shrunk so that the video clips are more manageable on a wider range of 
computer systems. 
5 To relink media, select the clips in a bin that need to be relinked (a document with 
a question mark indicates the media is offline) and choose Project > Link Media. 
Navigate to the media you want relinked when the file navigation window opens. Select 
the media and click Open. The clips will relink and appear in your Program Monitor.

lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
about adobe Bridge
Adobe Bridge CS6 digital asset management software provides integrated, central-
ized access to your project files and enables you to quickly browse through your 
creative assets visually—regardless of what format they’re in—making it easy for 
you to locate, organize, and view your files.
In addition, Adobe Bridge CS6 allows you to add searchable keywords to your files 
to make these files easier to find. You can add frequently accessed folders on your 
system to a Favorites list as well. Adobe Bridge CS6 also can do batch processing of 
media files, such as applying a Photoshop Action to a folder of images or renaming 
several files for more efficient organization.
naming and managing your project and media files
Having a strategy for how you name and organize your files is fundamental. When 
possible, use clear, simple naming that describes what is in the file or folder. 
Organize your media files into folders based on category.
You’ll use Adobe Bridge to browse through the media files that we’ve included for 
you to work with in this Classroom in a Book. We’ve named the files and organized 
them into folders based on a simple, effective strategy that you can use in your  
own productions.
navigating and previewing media
When you’re beginning the postproduction of a video project, it’s good working  
practice to look at all of the footage and media before you start editing. You become 
familiar with the material you’ll be working with and also discover anything that 
might be wrong with the footage.
Adobe Bridge CS6 allows you to browse through your footage and other media, 
and it can provide technical details about your footage and media.
1 Launch Adobe Bridge.
2 Using the Favorites panel in the upper-left corner of the interface, navigate to 
the Adobe CS6 Project Assets folder.
3 Double-click on the Adobe CS6 Project Assets folder to reveal its contents.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 31
The assets are organized by category: Audio, Exports, Footage, and Graphics. 
This is a simple way to organize assets at a high level in any video project.
4 Double-click on the Footage folder, and then double-click on the Interview 
folder to reveal its contents.

32 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
The interview clips are all named “interview” with the take number. They are 
grouped together in this folder for easy access later in the editing process.
5 Click the clip Interview_01.mp4 to select it.
The clip is now visible in the Preview panel.
6 In the Preview panel, click the Play button to preview the clip. When you’re 
finished, click the Pause button to stop playback. 
media asset management 
storage and integration
If you work in a facility with other video professionals, it is usually advantageous to 
have a shared asset management and storage system to streamline workflow and 
minimize costs.
Many Adobe partners offer products and services to help you do just that, such as 
online storage, asset management, hardware solutions for video acquisition and 
conversion, and software solutions for creating broadcast graphics.
You’ll find a current list on the Adobe website at www.adobe.com/solutions/broad-
casting/partners.html.
E Tip: You can also 
drag the playback bar 
to scrub forward and 
back through the video, 
which is useful when 
you’re choosing which 
clips to use.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 33
Working with metadata
Simply put, metadata is data about your data.
Looking at a video file, you’d have no idea what is contained within the file without 
metadata. For example, what video format is it? What is the frame size and frame 
rate? What is the duration? Is this a good take or a bad take? Metadata describes 
these and other attributes of the media files you use in video production.
One of the advantages of using Adobe Bridge as a file management tool is that you 
can create custom metadata fields, and then add them to your media files. Because 
the metadata stays with the media, it will be usable in all facets of your workflow 
down the line. For example, if you enter comments about the video in Adobe 
Bridge, you’ll be able to see those comments when you’re working with that video 
later in the other components of Creative Suite 6 Production Premium.
In the Metadata panel in Adobe Bridge, you’ll see some of the metadata attached to 
the Interview_01.mp4 clip that you currently have selected.
You can add your own metadata to any file using Adobe Bridge.

34 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
adding metadata to your media
Adobe Bridge CS6 provides an easy way to add metadata to your footage for future 
reference when editing.
Metadata can include information like scene description, shot number, and 
shooter’s name. You can also add a comment about qualitative information, such as 
whether a take is usable or not, which can help streamline the editing process. This 
process of adding comments to your media is known as logging clips. 
Let’s look at the basics on adding metadata by adding a “Best Take” comment.
1 Using the scroll bar in the Metadata panel, scroll down until the Video category 
is visible.
2 Click the gray space directly to the right of Log Comment.
3 Type Best Take.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 35
4 In the Content panel, click on the clip’s thumbnail.
5 In the dialog that appears, click the Apply button to apply your metadata changes.
6 The comment is now attached to the file and will stay with it throughout the rest 
of the workflow.
When you’re logging clips, it’s very useful to add notes about camera angles or dif-
ferent takes, making it much easier to find and work with your clips. 
about adobe story
Now that we’ve discussed some basics about naming files and adding metadata, 
let’s change gears and talk about Adobe Story, which is an application that simpli-
fies formatting scripts for film, television, and other outlets so that you can focus 
on writing your story.
Adobe Story is more than just a script writing application. During the preproduc-
tion phase of a project, scriptwriters can use Adobe Story to store their scripts in 
the cloud. After all of the footage has been shot, video editors can import an Adobe 
Story Script Format file to Adobe Premiere Pro to compare the dialogue in the 
script with a speech analysis of selected clips. This makes it easier for editors to 
locate segments of footage with certain dialogue. 
With a paid subscription to Adobe Story Plus, you can automatically synch scripts 
and other Adobe Story documents with other collaborators. Because scenes are 
numbered in the script, this information can be used during the production phase. 
Producers can use Adobe Story Plus to automatically generate production reports 
and schedules that relate to certain scenes.
The first exercise in this section is intended to give you a brief overview of how to 
properly format film script page elements with Adobe Story, and the subsequent 
exercise covers some of the collaboration features found in Adobe Story Plus.

36 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
Basic film script page elements
A screenplay is more than just a script with scene descriptions and character  
dialogue: It’s also a blueprint for producers and directors that makes it easy for 
them to break down what is needed to shoot a movie and helps them to budget 
costs for equipment, actors, locations, and so on. A screenplay follows a certain 
format that is based on standards that were established in the 1980s. These stan-
dards have been adopted in screenwriting software and are still in use today.
 Note: The definitive 
guide to formatting 
film scripts is The 
Complete Guide to 
Standard Script Formats 
by Judith H. Haag and 
Hillis R. Cole (CMC 
Publishing,1989).
Scene Heading
Character
General
Dialogue
Action
Parenthetical
Shot
Transition

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 37
The following is a brief list of screenplay formatting elements that you can use in 
your script when you’re writing with Adobe Story:
• Scene Heading. This is a brief indicator of the location of a scene and what 
time of day it takes place. Interior and exterior locations are denoted by the 
abbreviations INT and EXT.
• Character. When a character is introduced in a screenplay, it is important to 
clearly indicate this to the reader, which is why the character’s name is written 
in capital letters. This element also allows a producer to see at a glance how 
many actors will be needed to shoot a scene or a movie when a script is being 
budgeted.
• General. At the beginning of a scene, it’s a good idea to describe what you 
intend the viewer to see. If your script needs to indicate the presence of props, 
visual effects, sound effects, or anything that the producer might need to 
include in the production’s budget, indicate those items with capital letters.
• Dialogue. When a character has a spoken line of dialogue, the character’s name 
(using capital letters) and the dialogue are indented to the center of the page.
• Action. When something happens in a scene that is not dialogue, write a brief 
visual description of it. Be as concise as possible; a screenplay is not a novel.
• Parenthetical. This element is brief stage direction that is indented on the page 
with dialogue so that the flow of the scene is not interrupted with a separate 
general description. Keep parenthetical directions very brief.
• Shot. Whenever a specific camera direction (pan, zoom, dolly, etc.) is needed 
for a shot, indicate this using capital letters. The producer can then see at a 
glance if any extra camera equipment (special lenses, camera crane, etc.) will be 
required and needs to be included in the production budget.
• Transition. This element indicates a specific type of transition (cut, dissolve, 
wipe, etc.) at the end of a scene as a general guideline for the editor(s).

lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
starting a new script in adobe story
To become familiar with what Adobe Story can do, let’s write a sample page of  
film script.
1 Open your web browser.
2 In the Address field, type the URL story.adobe.com and press Return (Enter).
3 On the Adobe Story homepage, click Sign In.
4 In the Sign In window that appears, enter your Adobe ID and Password, and 
then click Sign In. If you don’t already have an Adobe ID, follow the onscreen 
instructions to create one. Accept the terms of use as well.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 39
Your web browser will load the Story interface.
5 Click the Projects menu at the top left of the interface and choose New Project.
6 In the Create New Project dialog enter a name for your project (you can type in 
The Big Thing That Happened, which is the name of our hypothetical script, 
or any other name of your choosing), and then click Create.
7 At the top of the Story interface, click the + New button to create a new script 
in your project.
8 In the Create New Document - Adobe Story window, click the Type menu and 
choose Film Script.

40 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
9 Double-click in the Title field and type The Big Thing That Happened.
10 Click Create. The script’s title page appears.
11 Notice that Adobe Story has formatted your title page by placing your script 
title and your name automatically.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 41
12 Scroll down to the first page of the script to where you see the placeholder 
text ENTER SCENE HEADING. Click on that text and type in the new scene 
heading EXT. CITY STREET – DAY.
As you are typing the word EXT, Story anticipates that you want to type a 
commonly used scene heading by showing the word EXT in a floating menu 
below your cursor. You can either continue typing, or you can choose the 
desired word from the floating menu.
13 Press Return (Enter) to start a new line of text.
Next, you’ll write a brief bit of action. 
14 Type TOM and JANE exit a sidewalk cafe.
Note that in the Formatting menu at the top right of the interface, Story has 
automatically formatted this line of text as Action.
15 Choose from the Formatting menu to manually format any text in your script. 
Let’s write some dialogue.
16 Press Return (Enter), click the Formatting menu, and choose Character.
17 Type jane and then press Return (Enter). The formatting automatically changes 
to Dialogue.
18 Type that sure was delicious, wasn’t it?
Notice that Story automatically and conveniently formats character names with all 
capital letters and adds a capital letter to the start of the dialogue.
Collaborating with others on your script
The free version of Adobe Story, which is available with your Adobe ID account, 
gives you the ability to craft your story using industry-standard formatting. However, 
many collaboration features are only available with a paid subscription to Adobe 
Story Plus.
The following exercise takes advantage of these collaboration features. If you do not 
have a paid subscription to Adobe Story Plus, proceed to the next exercise in the 
section “About Adobe Prelude.”

42 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
adobe story Plus 
If scriptwriting is a regular part of your workflow, it might make sense to upgrade 
to Adobe Story Plus. Not only does it feature enhanced scriptwriting tools, like 
trackable history of changes, customizable script templates, and industry-standard 
formatting, but it also allows you to collaborate with project team members online. 
Many of the online features include tools for scheduling and reporting, such as per-
mission assignment, email notifications, and the ability to organize and synch scene 
elements like props and costumes.
One of the primary advantages of using Adobe Story Plus to write your scripts is 
that it enables you to collaborate with others and track changes in a single interface. 
This removes the “what version is this” factor of sharing and working on the same 
document with multiple contributors.
Adobe Story Plus helps to ensure that any changes to dialogue, shot lists, or  
other copy in a script is associated with a specific user and when those changes 
were made.
1 Choose File > Share.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 43
2 In the dialog that appears, enter the email addresses of people you want to 
collaborate with, and assign them roles (co-author, reviewer, or reader).
3 Select the Send E-Mail Notification check box.
4 Click OK to add your collaborators and send them an email inviting them to 
collaborate on your script.
5 Choose Review > Start Tracking Changes.
6 Choose View > Track Changes Toolbar.
Now you’ll be able to see, in red text on your script, what changes have been made 
and by whom.
about adobe Prelude
With modern digital video cameras that use memory cards, it has become possible 
during the production phase of a project to not only view footage immediately after 
it is shot, but to transfer the footage to a computer’s hard drive while on set.
Adobe Prelude CS6 allows you to begin organizing your footage right after the footage 
has been transferred to a computer from a camera. Prelude was also designed for 
producers (and non-editors) to be able to mark up clips for their editors, as part 
of a collaborative workflow. You can ingest entire raw clips or selected portions of 
clips to a Prelude project. Once clips are ingested to Prelude, you can add descrip-
tive metadata to them, mark subclips, and insert searchable comments. This added 
metadata will be saved with the clips when you send your rough cut from Adobe 
Prelude to Adobe Premiere Pro, which can help streamline the editing process.

44 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
In this exercise you’ll ingest the Afrolicious raw clips to a project in Adobe Prelude 
CS6, apply metadata to some clips, create a rough cut of the clips, and then send 
the rough cut to Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.
Ingesting footage
Let’s go through the process of ingesting the raw footage for the project into  
Adobe Prelude CS6 so that you can begin logging and commenting on the footage.
1 Launch Adobe Prelude and click New Project.
2 By default, Adobe Prelude saves a new project to its own Projects folder. But 
instead, navigate to the Lesson 02 folder (Adobe CS6 Project Assets > Lessons > 
Lesson 02) and open it.
3 Name your project Afrolicious Ingest, and then click Save.
4 Click the Ingest button. The Ingest panel opens.
Similar to Adobe Bridge, you’ll see a list of the contents of your computer’s hard 
drive(s) on the left of the interface. 
5 Navigate to the Adobe CS6 Project Assets folder and then to the Footage folder 
to reveal its contents.
By default, the contents of the Footage folder are displayed as a list, but it can be 
more useful to display the contents as thumbnails.
6 Toggle the Thumbnail view by clicking the Thumbnail button.
You can hover your cursor over a thumbnail and scrub through it to preview  
its contents.
7 Drag your cursor to one of the thumbnails and park it there, but do not click on 
the thumbnail.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 45
8 Move your mouse left and right to scrub through the video.
If you want to ingest just a portion of a video clip, you set In and Out points, 
defining the portion of the video to be ingested.
9 Click on any of the thumbnails in the Ingest panel.
10 Drag the scrubber to a frame toward the beginning of the clip.
11 Press the I key to set an In point.
12 The thumbnail now shows a shortened Timeline, indicating that the portion of 
the video prior to the In point will not be ingested.
13 Drag the scrubber to a frame toward the end of the clip.
14 Press the O key to set an Out point.
Note that to ingest only part of a clip, Prelude would need to make a trimmed 
copy of the file, and it would only do that if the Transfer Clips to Destination 
check box is selected along with Transcode.
Because you actually want to ingest this entire clip, reset the In and Out points 
to their original locations.

46 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
15 Drag the scrubber to the beginning of the clip and press the I key.
16 Drag the scrubber to the end of the clip and press the O key.
17 You can select which clips and folders you want to ingest simply by selecting  
the check box under their corresponding thumbnails. Deselected clips and 
folders will not be ingested into your project. However, in this exercise you’ll  
be ingesting all the clips and folders contained within the Footage folder.
18 Click the Check All button at the bottom of the ingest window to select all  
the clips.
19 Click the Ingest button to ingest your selected clips.
E Tip: The shortcut  
for marking clips is to 
press the V key. You can 
then select multiple 
clips and press the V 
key to mark all selected 
clips for ingest.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 47
Copying and transcoding 
footage to a new location
In most scenarios you’ll be ingesting media from data cards or a hard drive and 
copying it to a different location. Prelude can automatically copy your media to your 
destination of choice as part of the ingest process.
To set Prelude to do this, locate the Transfer Options on the right side of the Ingest 
dialog, and select the Transfer Clips to Destination check box. Then choose a Primary 
Destination folder on your computer. You can add more destinations by clicking the 
Add Destination button.
In some cases you may receive media that needs to be transcoded—or saved as a 
different file format and/or with different video and audio settings—to work with 
Adobe Premiere Pro. If this is the case, select the Transcode check box in the Ingest 
dialog and use the Transcode presets to save the media with your desired settings 
upon ingest.
adding notes to footage
The log comment you added in Adobe Bridge, in the earlier section “Adding meta-
data to your media,” remains attached to the file as metadata. You can view this 
comment in Prelude and add new comments.
A typical workflow involves ingesting files and then adding the notes or log com-
ments. Prelude is perfectly suited for this.
1 In the Project panel, double-click the first clip Interview_01.mp4.
2 Choose Window > Metadata. Click the disclosure triangle next to Dynamic 
Media, and then scroll down the list until the Log Comment field is visible.
Note that the comment you entered in Adobe Bridge is still attached to the file.
3 In the Project panel, double-click the clip Interview_02.mp4.
4 In the Metadata panel, type 
Alternate take in the Log 
Comment field, and then press 
Return (Enter). Close out of the 
Metadata panel in preparation 
for the next lesson.
The comment is added to the file 
and will be attached to the clip 
throughout the rest of the workflow.

48 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
Creating bins
In film and video production, the folders you create to organize your media files  
are called bins. The term bins dates back to traditional film editing when you liter-
ally sorted your physical clips of film into bins.
It’s essential when starting a video editing project to organize your media into  
bins. This will help you to quickly locate specific clips when the editing process  
is underway.
1 In the Project panel, click the New Bin icon. A new bin appears in the  
Project panel.
2 Name the bin Joey, and then press Return (Enter) to confirm.
3 Click on the Joey_01.mp4 clip to select it, and then hold down the Shift key 
and click on the Joey_02.mp4 clip to select it.
4 Drag the selected clips into the Joey bin.
5 Now create a new bin by clicking the New Bin icon. Name this new bin 
Interview. Select Interview_01.mp4, hold down the Shift key, and then 
click Interview_08.mp4 to select all clips in between. Drag these selected 
interview clips into the Interview bin.
E Tip: Bins can be 
placed inside other bins 
for better organization.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 49
assembling a rough cut
You can begin creating simple, assembly edits in Prelude, either to get a head start 
on editing or to assemble clips for another editor if you’re working on a project as 
part of a team.
1 Click the Create a New Rough Cut icon.
2 In the Create Rough Cut  dialog, enter the name Studio Assembly and save  
the rough cut to your Lesson 02 folder. The rough cut now appears in your 
Project panel.
3 Double-click the Studio Assembly rough cut to open it in the Timeline.
Let’s add some clips to the rough cut.
4 Drag the clip Studio_01.mp4 to the Timeline panel.

50 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
5 Drag the clip Studio_02.mp4 to the right of the first clip in the Timeline panel 
and drop it there. The second clip is now inserted after the first clip.
6 Drag the clip Studio_03.mp4 to the left of the first clip in the Timeline panel and 
drop it there. The third clip is now inserted before the first clip.
7 Drag the clip Studio_04.mp4 in between the first two clips on the Timeline. The 
fourth clip is now inserted in between the existing clips.
8 Drag and drop the clips on the Timeline to rearrange them in any order.
9 Press the spacebar to play back your rough cut.
10 Choose File > Save to save your project.
adding time-based comments
You may want to specify which segment of a clip you want to use in the edit. You 
can enter comments on clips in your Prelude Timeline that pertain to specific parts 
of your clips. These comments will be available in Adobe Premiere Pro when you 
move to the editing part of the workflow.
1 In your Timeline, double-click the clip Studio_01.mp4.
2 In the Marker Type panel, click the Comment button.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 51
3 Type use this section to enter the comment, and then press Return (Enter).
You’ll see the comment in the Timeline starting at whatever frame your current 
time indicator (CTI) was parked on. You can adjust the In and Out points of the 
comment to indicate which portion of the clip it pertains to.
4 Drag the left edge of the comment to a new location on the Timeline to set its  
In point.
5 Drag the right edge of the comment to a new location on the Timeline to set its 
Out point.
E Tip: It’s helpful to add comments about camera movements and live audio.

52 
lesson 2 
organizing the media Files for Your Project
It’s also possible to set comment In and Out points by scrubbing your CTI  
in the Timeline and then clicking the In and Out buttons in the Marker 
Inspector panel.
6 To return to the rough cut, click the underlined text Rough Cut (Studio Assembly) 
at the top of the Timeline.
sending your project to adobe Premiere Pro
All of the work you’ve done so far is prep work for the next step of the workflow, 
which is to edit your project in Adobe Premiere Pro. A single menu selection is all 
it takes to move your project from Prelude to Adobe Premiere Pro.
1 Click the Project panel.
2 Choose Edit > Select All to select all of the items in the project.
If you want to send just certain items to Adobe Premiere Pro, not your entire 
project, simply select those items in the Project panel. Any items not selected 
will not be sent to Adobe Premiere Pro.
3 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project. Then choose File > Send to 
Premiere Pro.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 53
Adobe Premiere Pro will launch, if it is not already open, and will create a new 
project for you.
4 In the New Project dialog, click the Browse button.
5 Navigate to your Lesson 02 folder and click Choose.
6 In the Name field type Afrolicious Edit and click OK.
All of your footage (with metadata still attached), the 
bin you created, and the rough cut you created are 
now in your Adobe Premiere Pro project.
 Note: If Adobe 
Premiere Pro is already 
open when you send a 
rough cut from Prelude, 
the currently open 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
project will receive the 
rough cut.

lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
about adobe Premiere Pro
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 is your nonlinear video editing system. It offers lots of 
intuitive and powerful features that simplify the postproduction phase of your 
project.
As the hub of your postproduction workflow, Adobe Premiere Pro is not only 
where you compose your edited piece, but it’s also where you bring together the 
rest of the work that you will create in the other components of Creative Suite 6 
Production Premium.
In addition, Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to link dynamically to project assets 
from other applications in Adobe CS6 Production Premium so that intermediate 
rendering is not required.
Linear editing vs. nonlinear editing
Linear editing is a method of editing video using a system in which you record each 
edit sequentially onto videotape. If any changes are required to an edit that has 
already been recorded to tape, all edits after that change need to be re-recorded in 
sequence onto the tape. Linear editing systems are largely obsolete now due to the 
introduction of nonlinear editing systems in the 1990s.
Nonlinear editing is a method of editing video using software on a computer that 
enables you to manipulate the sequence of digitized video clips before exporting 
the entire sequence to videotape or as a digitized movie file. Changes can easily 
be made in the software before output, allowing for maximum flexibility. Adobe 
Premiere Pro CS6 is an example of nonlinear editing software.
One way to summarize the difference between linear video editing and nonlinear 
video editing is to compare them, respectively, to typing onto a piece of paper with 
a typewriter versus using a word processor on a computer.
optimizing performance
Your hardware requirements for running Adobe Premiere Pro will largely depend 
on which video file formats you will be editing, as well as the types of tasks you are 
performing. Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 is able to perform well on high-end systems 
as well as lower-spec machines, such as laptops, thanks to the Mercury Playback 
Engine (see Chapter 1 for more details).
The video files we’ve provided for you to work with in this Classroom in a Book
are H.264 files, which were encoded to a bitrate that will play back in real time on 
most computers. However, in film production, you’ll likely encounter other video 
formats, such as 2K and 4k, which require much more horsepower to play back in 
real time.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 59
What is h.264?
H.264 is a standard for video compression and has become widely used as a stan-
dard for web video on sites such as YouTube and Vimeo, allowing high-definition 
(HD) video to play online. H.264 is also a standard compression used on Blu-ray 
Discs. Modern video cameras commonly use H.264 as a means of internally com-
pressing raw footage.
2k, 4k, and high frame rates
The terms 2K and 4K refer to video standards that describe the pixel width of a 
digitized frame of film. For example, a 4K frame can have 4096×3072 pixels, whereas 
a 2K frame can have 2048×1080 pixels.
Many cameras on the market today can acquire imagery at high frame rates and at a 
resolution that is higher than standard HD.
Acquiring video footage at resolutions higher than the standard 1920×1080 pixel 
frame size gives you the flexibility to crop regions of the frame in postproduction 
and create simple postproduction pans and zooms. High frame sizes may also be 
required when producing movies for theatrical release. However, as a result of hav-
ing a greater amount of pixels per frame, 2K and 4K footage can be a bit unwieldy 
and require more storage space, transfer speed, and processing power.
Shooting at a high frame rate yields more frames per second of playback, which can 
be interpreted in Adobe Premiere or Adobe After Effects to achieve a dramatic slow-
motion look. When shooting at a high frame rate, there is less time to capture each 
frame; therefore, more light is required.
Many of the cameras made by RED can shoot at frame rates of up to 300 frames per 
second, whereas cameras manufactured by Phantom HD can shoot close to 10,000 
frames per second. These cameras tend to be more expensive than digital SLR 
cameras (which can shoot at up to 60 frames per second) and require more camera 
support, such as rigging and additional crew assistance.
The most current tech specs for Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 can always be found on 
the Adobe website at www.adobe.com/products/premiere/tech-specs.html.
The general rules of thumb for improving performance in Adobe Premiere Pro  
CS6 are:
• Add as much RAM as your computer is capable of taking.
• Keep your media on a separate drive from the hard drive that your OS and 
applications are on. A RAID is recommended if you are editing a media format 
that has a high data rate, or at the very least a 7,200 RPM hard drive.
• Add an Adobe-certified graphics card for GPU acceleration.

lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
What is a raID?
A Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a combination of multiple hard 
drives recognized by a RAID hardware controller or by the operating system as a 
single hard drive. RAID configurations were originally developed for the purpose of 
security and redundancy where multiple disks would store redundant data. Because 
hard drives tend to fail over time due to physical friction and heat, redundancy of 
data decreases the probability of data loss.
Today, RAID configurations are signified by a number from 0 to 6. Common RAID 
configurations include the following:
• 
raID 0. Two or more hard drives configured to alternate in reading and 
writing of data in small blocks. A RAID 0 offers no redundancy but can achieve 
exponentially higher speeds with the inclusion of more physical hard drives. 
RAID 0 configurations are ideal for media storage in video postproduction. It’s 
important to accompany RAID 0 configurations with some external means of 
redundancy, because a RAID 0 has no inherent redundancy. 
• 
raID 1. Two or more hard drives configured to mirror each other for maximum 
redundancy and security. A RAID 1 is ideal for archiving media, because it 
provides inherent redundancy that a RAID 0 does not.
• 
raID 5. Three or more hard drives configured for speed and redundancy. A RAID 
5 is capable of operating even if one hard drive in the array has failed. 
Creating a new project in adobe Premiere Pro
If you’re continuing from the previous lesson in Lesson 2, you’ll already have the 
media, bins, and rough cut you created in Prelude in your Adobe Premiere Pro 
project. In a real-world workflow you would continue building your edit from here.
If you’re continuing from Lesson 2, skip these steps that follow and begin with the 
section “Understanding the Adobe Premiere Pro user interface.”
Let’s start by exploring how to create a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro!
1 Launch Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.
The Welcome screen appears.
 Note: P Note: For 
in-depth coverage on 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
CS6, it’s recommended 
that you read Adobe 
Premiere Pro CS6 
Classroom in a Book. 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 61
2 Click the New Project icon to open the New Project window.
3 Click the Browse button. Navigate to the Lesson 03 folder on your hard drive 
and click Choose. 
4 Double-click in the Name field to select the default name, type Afrolicious 
Promo, and click OK.
 Note: Refer to  
the section “Copying 
the lesson files” in  
the “Getting Started” 
section at the begin-
ning of the book.

lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
5 The New Sequence dialog appears. On the left, you’ll see a list of Available 
Presets to match the specifications of various video footage standards.
You can create your first sequence here by selecting the format you created  
your footage in from the Available Presets. A sequence is a series of edits 
arranged in the Timeline panel that when played from beginning to end shows 
the order of your chosen clips and transitions. You’ll learn more about them 
later in the chapter.
In most cases it’s easier to create your sequences directly from the footage you’ll 
be importing, so you’ll skip this step.
6 Click Cancel.
Your new project is now open in Adobe Premiere Pro.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 63
understanding the adobe Premiere Pro user interface
Now that you have a project open in Adobe Premiere Pro, let’s take a look at  
the interface. 
When you launch Adobe Premiere Pro for the first time, you’ll be presented with 
the default Editing workspace. This workspace puts the most commonly used pan-
els at your fingertips. Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to configure the layout panels 
in multiple ways, to suit your particular way of working, and those configurations 
are saved on a file-by-file basis.  
To reset the Editing workspace to its default settings, do the following:
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Editing.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace.
3 In the dialog that appears, click Yes.
Six panels are visible on the surface of the Editing workspace:
• The Source Monitor is where you preview your footage, audio, and graphics 
clips, and set In and Out points for editing them into your sequence.

64 
lesson 3

• The Program Monitor is where you view the edit that you assemble on  
your Timeline.
• The Project panel is where you organize your media files, sequences, and  
other components of your project, as well as create bins.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 65
• The Tools panel is where you select different tools used in the editing process.
• The Timeline panel is where you compose and adjust your edit. You work on 
sequences within the Timeline.
• The Audio Meters display the master audio level of your edit.

Importing footage and other media 
using the media Browser
The Media Browser is where you browse the contents of any of the drives or cards 
connected to your computer, and it provides one way to add those files to your project.
1 Click the Media Browser tab.
2 Navigate to your Adobe CS6 Project Assets folder, click the disclosure triangle 
next to Adobe CS6 Project Assets to expand the list of folders (also referred to 
as twirling down), and then click on your Footage folder.
The contents of the Footage folder appear in the Media Browser.
You can display the contents of a folder in List view or Thumbnail view.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 67
3 Click the Thumbnail View icon at the bottom of 
the Media Browser.
You can preview the content of the footage by 
hovering your cursor over any clip’s thumbnail and scrubbing left to right.
4 Drag your cursor so it’s over the Joey_01.mp4 clip and park it there.
5 Move your cursor left and right to preview the contents of the clip. This is called 
a hover-scrub. This is a new feature in Adobe Premiere Pro that was added in 
the CS6 release. By doing this, you can scrub through the frames of this clip for 
faster previewing.
6 You can import individual clips or entire folders full of clips. In this case, import 
the entire contents of the Footage folder, including clips and subfolders.
7 Click on the Joey_01.mp4 clip to select it.
8 Press Command+A (Ctrl+A) to select all the clips.
9 Right-click and choose Import.
10 Click on the Project panel.
All of the media is imported into your project.
11 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.

lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
Capturing from tape
The workflow you are learning in this Classroom in a Book uses media that was 
captured in a file-based format. Most modern video cameras record video to a 
memory card or other type of solid state media. Older cameras record to a tape-
based format.
If you are editing media from a videotape, you’ll need to capture that media with 
Adobe Premiere Pro to create files that you can edit on your computer.
The standard workflow is to connect your camcorder or tape deck to your computer 
via FireWire, and then open the Capture tool in Adobe Premiere Pro by choosing  
File > Capture.
In this workflow, you use the Capture tool to control your camcorder/tape deck and 
tell Adobe Premiere Pro which section of the tape to capture and what you want to 
name the resulting files.
If your workflow involves capturing media from tape, you can find more detailed 
instruction in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 Classroom in a Book (Adobe Press, 2012).
understanding the Project panel
The Project panel is where you organize all of the assets in your project. By default, 
it displays all of the items in Icon view, which can be useful because this view 
displays thumbnails, giving you a visual representation of what is contained within 
each file.
Viewing your Project panel in List view is also useful, because it gives you an over-
view of information about each clip and also makes it easy to organize your clips. 
Let’s explore the Project panel.
1 In the Project panel, click the List View button at the bottom left.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 69
The items in the Project panel now display as an alphabetized list. You can click 
on the column headings to sort your Project panel in a variety of ways.
2 Click on the right edge of the Project panel and drag it to the right to make  
it wider.
3 Click on the Media Duration heading.
The clips are now sorted based on their duration, from shortest to longest.
4 Click on the Name heading.
The clips are once again sorted alphabetically.
If you completed the previous chapter, you know that any metadata you add 
to a video clip in Adobe Bridge or Prelude stays attached to that clip and can 
be used in Adobe Premiere Pro as well as the other components of Production 
Premium. The Log Notes entered on these clips can be viewed in the Log Note 
column of the Project panel.

70 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
5 Using the scroll bar at the bottom of the Project panel, scroll to the right until 
the Log Note column heading is visible.
6 Twirl down the Interview bin to reveal its contents.
Note that the Log Notes entered on the Interview_01.mp4 and Interview_02.mp4 
clips are visible.
You can reorder the columns of information in the Project panel so you can 
easily access the information most important to you.
7 Click on the Log Note column heading, and drag it to the left.
8 Drop the Log Note column heading to the left of the Label column.
The Log Note column now displays next to the file name, making it easy to view 
your Log Notes.
E Tip: By hovering 
your cursor over a panel 
and pressing the tilde 
(~) key, you can toggle 
maximizing the panel 
to fill your screen.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 71
Interpreting Footage
Most of the video clips that you imported were shot at a frame rate of 23.976 
frames per second (fps). Your final movie will be set to play back at that same frame 
rate; therefore, the clips that were originally shot at 23.976 fps will play back at that 
same speed, and the motion in the clips will appear to be at a normal speed.
about seconds and frames
When a camera records video, it captures a series of still images of the action. If 
there are enough images captured each second, it looks like moving video when 
played back. Each picture is called a frame, and the number of frames each second 
is usually called frames per second (fps). The fps will vary depending on your camera 
format and settings. It could be 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 50, or 59.94 fps. Some cameras 
allow you to choose between more than one frame rate with different options for 
accompanying frame sizes. Adobe Premiere Pro will play back video at all common 
frame rates.
However, you have a few video clips that were shot at 59.94 fps. If these clips were 
played back at 59.94 fps, the motion in the clips would appear normal as well. But 
if these clips were played back at 23.976 fps, the motion in the clips would appear 
slower than normal.
Adobe Premiere Pro can interpret the native frame rate of a video clip as a different 
frame rate. By interpreting these 59.94 fps clips as 23.976 fps, they can be slow-
motion clips in your sequence and give your final movie added production value. 
In this exercise, you’ll interpret the footage and set the frame rate to 23.976.
1 Deselect all clips by pressing Command+Shift+A (Ctrl+Shift+A).
2 In the Project panel, select the clip Live_23-60.mp4. Hold down the Command 
(Ctrl) key and select Live_24-60.mp4 and Live_25-60.mp4.
3 Choose Clip > Modify > Interpret Footage. The Modify Clip window appears. 
This is where you’ll set the clips’ interpreted frame rate.

72 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
4 Select “Assume this frame rate,” and type 23.976 in the fps field. Click OK.
5 Double-click on Live_23-60.mp4 to open it in the Source Monitor. Press the 
spacebar to play the clip to verify that it is now in slow motion.
Creating bins
As mentioned in Chapter 2, bins are folders you create to sort and contain your 
media files. For an efficient workflow, it’s essential to sort your media into bins in  
a way that will make it easy to find the clip you need when you need it.
Importing assets as a bin
In some cases you may already have your media sorted into folders on your hard 
drive. We’ve provided a folder called Audio with your assets that you’ll now import 
into your project as a bin.
1 Click the Media Browser tab.
2 Navigate to your Adobe CS6 Project Assets folder, and then click on the Audio 
folder to select it.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 73
3 Choose File > Import from Media Browser.
4 Click the Project tab.
You’ll see that the Audio folder has been imported into your project as a bin.
5 Double-click the Audio bin.
The Audio bin opens in a new floating panel. You’ll see two audio files contained 
within, which you’ll use later on.
6 Press Command+W (Ctrl+W) to close the Audio bin panel. Press 
Command+Shift+A (Ctrl+Shift+A) to deselect all.
E Tip: Use the 
keyboard shortcut 
Command+Option+I 
(Ctrl+Alt+I) to import 
the selected item from 
the Media Browser.

74 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
Creating a new bin
Now you’ll create a new bin from scratch.
1 In the Project panel, click the New Bin icon.
A new bin appears in the Project panel.
2 Type Studio to name the bin, and then press Enter.
You now have a new bin called Studio. You’ll put the clips from the Studio shoot 
into this bin.
3 Scroll down until all the Studio clips are visible (you may need to make your 
Project panel bigger to see them all).
4 Place your cursor to the left of the first Studio clip, click and drag down and to 
the right until all seven Studio clips are selected, and release the mouse button. 
This is called marquee-selecting.
 Note: After naming 
a bin, if you press 
Return, Adobe Premiere 
Pro will highlight the 
next bin. Pressing Enter 
will register the name of 
the current bin. If you’re 
using a laptop and have 
no Enter key, click on a 
blank area in the Project 
panel to register the bin 
name.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 75
5 Click and drag your selected clips into the Studio bin. Press Command+Shift+A 
(Ctrl+Shift+A) to deselect all.
Continue by creating bins called Joey and Live, and dragging the corresponding 
clips into these bins. Be sure not to have a bin or any items in that bin selected 
when you click the New Bin icon, or the new bin will appear in the selected bin.
You can also select items in your Project panel, and then drag to the New Bin button, 
and a new bin will be created with the selected items contained within.
viewing your footage
A good work practice as an editor is to take some time looking at all of your clips. 
Familiarize yourself with all of the well-composed moments that would help tell 
your story. Also become familiar with the mistakes and flubbed takes that you’ll 
want to avoid using.
For this exercise, you’ll review the raw footage for the Afrolicious promo and look 
at various features that might help you tell your story.
You can view your clips in the Source Monitor.
1 In the Project panel, double-click on your Interview bin to open it.
2 In your Interview bin, double-click on Interview_01.mp4. It will open in the 
Source Monitor.
3 Press the spacebar or click the Play icon to play the clip.
 Note: If you are 
continuing from 
Chapter 2, you should 
already have a Joey bin.

76 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
Listening to your footage
As you view your clips, look and listen for moments that stand out in terms of 
usable sound bites. View all of the Interview clips, one at a time, to become familiar 
with them.
1 Double-click on Interview_03.mp4 in the Interview bin to open it in the Source 
Monitor.
2 Press the spacebar to play the clip. Notice that there is an anomalous “click” 
sound that is not Joey’s voice. Make a mental note that this will need to be  
fixed later.
Because these clips were shot with Joey in front of a green screen background, 
they may not be ideal for use as a visual element in your edit, but the audio  
has lots of good sound bites. You’ll use these clips primarily for the audio, not 
the video.
3 Select your Interview bin and press Command+W (Ctrl+W) to close it.
Now let’s review the Studio clips. Again, you are looking and listening for 
moments that would help tell your story, as well as for anomalies in your 
footage that you need to either fix or avoid using.
4 Go back to the Project panel, and double-click on your Studio bin to open it.
5 In your Studio bin, double-click on Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4. It will open in the 
Source Monitor.
6 Press the spacebar or click the Play icon to play the clip.
This clip shows a nice moment of interaction between Joey and a singer in the 
studio. We hear them talking about recording a vocal. Also notice that there is  
a low hum of background noise in this clip. That will have to be fixed later.
7 Go back to your Studio bin. Double-click on Studio_01.mp4. It will open in the 
Source Monitor.
8 Press the spacebar to play the clip, which shows the singer from the previous 
clip at the microphone, recording a vocal. So here you have two pieces of a story 
that would match well together in your edit.
9 View the rest of the Studio clips. Notice that all but these two don’t have  
any audio.
10 Select your Studio bin and close it by pressing Command+W (Ctrl+W).
E Tip: Depending on 
how much screen space 
you have, you may 
need to move the Bin 
panel on your screen so 
that the Source Monitor 
is not obstructed. To 
move it, click the top of 
the panel interface and 
drag it elsewhere.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 77
viewing your Live footage
Now let’s look at the Live clips. This footage was recorded during a live performance 
by Afrolicious, and some of it can be enhanced with visual effects.
1 In the Project panel, double-click on your Live bin to open it. 
There are a lot of Live clips, so rather than viewing them as a list of clip names 
in the bin, switch to Icon view.
2 At the bottom left of the Live bin, click the Icon View icon. All of the clips will 
display as icons. You can adjust the size of the icons by using the Zoom In / 
Zoom Out slider next to the Icon View icon.
3 Hover-scrub Live_01.mp4.
When viewing your clips, you should also be looking for moments that could be 
fixed or even enhanced with a visual effect.
4 Double-click on Live_18.mp4 to open it in the Source Monitor. Press the 
spacebar to play it.
This clip shows the back of a musician on stage. It also shows a bright stage light 
shining at the camera. Symbolically, a bright light could serve to illustrate a moment 
of revelation or a transition of mood. This shot could be enhanced with a visual 
effect made in Adobe After Effects CS6, which you’ll learn to do in Chapter 5.

78 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
5 Double-click on Live_26-Lights.mp4 to open it in the Source Monitor.
6 Press the spacebar to play it. You’ll see that this shot is rather blurry, showing 
only blobs of colored light. This could have been shot by accident when the 
videographer pressed the Record button on his camera without realizing it.  
That doesn’t mean you can’t use it.
7 View all of these clips by double-clicking each one to open them in the Source 
Monitor. Press the spacebar to play a clip.
8 Set your Live bin back to List view by clicking the List View icon.
9 Close your Live bin by pressing Command+W (Ctrl+W).
Green screen footage
Now look at the Joey clips. These clips were shot with a green screen background.
1 In the Project panel, double-click on your Joey bin to open it. This bin has only 
two clips.
2 Double-click on Joey_01.mp4 to open it in the Source Monitor.
3 Press the spacebar to play it. The clip shows Joey doing a little dance in front of 
a green screen background. This has obvious potential for use in a visual effect 
shot, because a green screen background can be removed from a clip and the 
foreground subject can then be placed in front of a different background.
You’ll learn about using green screen footage in Chapter 4.
4 Select your Joey bin. Close it by pressing Command+W (Ctrl+W).
5 Return to the Project panel.
E Tip: When viewing 
your footage, keep 
your eye open for 
quick camera pans or 
movements, blurry 
lights, and other 
unintended abstract 
moments in your clips. 
You can intersperse 
these moments 
throughout your 
edit to give a stylistic 
dimension to your story.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 79
music and sound effects
You’ve imported a couple of clips that are just audio with no video. Let’s become 
familiar with these clips.
1 Double-click on the Audio bin to open it. There are two audio clips in this bin. 
2 Double-click on Can’t_Listen_Edited_Even.aif to open it in the Source Monitor.
3 Press the spacebar to play it. This can obviously be used as the main music track 
in your edit.
4 In your Audio bin, double-click on Large Crowd Applause 02.wav to open it in 
the Source Monitor.
5 Press the spacebar to play it. This is a short sound effect clip of crowd applause. 
This could be used to enhance one of the Live clips.
You’ll learn about editing audio using these clips in Chapter 7.
6 Select your Audio bin and close it by pressing Command+W (Ctrl+W).
After you’ve looked at all of your clips, think about how you’d create a compelling 
story with them.
about subclips
Sometimes you may have a very long clip in your bin that has two or more seg-
ments in it that can serve as stand-alone clips. You can extract these segments as 
subclips. Although a subclip is a reference to a segment of the master clip, Adobe 
Premiere Pro shows a subclip in a bin as a self-contained clip.
You can use a subclip in your project much like a master clip but with a few 
exceptions. For instance, you can trim a subclip only within its initial start and 
end frames. You can set new In and Out points for a subclip but only if they fall 
between the In and Out points you set when you first created the subclip.
A subclip is a reference to the master clip’s media file. If the master clip is taken 
offline or deleted from the project, any subclips derived from it will remain online. 
However, if you remove the master clip’s media file from your system, its subclips 
will go offline.
E Tip: Be warned that 
if you relink a subclip 
that has been taken 
offline, it becomes a 
master clip, and all 
connections to the 
original master clip are 
broken.

80 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
Creating a subclip
Especially with longer takes, creating a subclip is an efficient method of breaking 
down a piece of footage to just the components you want to use in your edit.
The first interview clip we’ve provided in your Adobe CS6 Project Assets folder is a 
long interview with Joey that you need to grab some sound bites from. So, let’s do 
that now.
1 In your Project panel, twirl down the Interview bin triangle to reveal its contents.
2 Double-click the clip Interview_01.mp4 to open it in the Source Monitor.
3 Press the spacebar and view the contents of the clip.
This clip contains a variety of random statements about Afrolicious. You’ll 
create some subclips containing only the best sound bites for use in your edit.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 81
4 In the Source Monitor, drag the current-time indicator (CTI) to 00:00:22:00.
5 Press the spacebar to begin playback, and then press it again to stop playback 
when the CTI reaches 00:00:31:00.
The first sound bite you’ll create a subclip for is “DJs and drummers, MCs,  
horn players, and all tied in to the dancers.”
6 Drag the CTI back to 00:00:22:00 and click the Mark In icon, or press the I key.
7 Drag the CTI to 00:00:31:00 and click the Mark Out icon, or press the O key.
The sound bite is now selected in the clip.

8 Choose Clip > Make Subclip.
9 In the dialog, type djs and drummers, and then click OK.
The subclip is now in the Interview bin in your Project panel.
10 Double-click the djs and drummers subclip to load it into the Source Monitor.
11 Press the spacebar to play back the subclip.
speech to text workflow
If you are editing interview footage, you may want to try the Speech to Text feature 
in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. This feature analyzes the audio and attempts to create a 
text transcript.
Simply right-click any clip containing audio in the Project panel, and choose Analyze 
Content.
Make sure the Speech check box is selected, as well as the language your audio is in. 
When you click OK, Adobe Media Encoder will launch, analyze the clip, and then put 
the Analysis Text into the Metadata panel in Adobe Premiere Pro. Selecting the clip in 
the Project panel and then opening the Metadata panel will reveal the analyzed text.
Of course, in the event that the Speech to Text feature makes a few errors, they can 
be edited manually.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 83
Creating the first sequence
In terms of editing in Adobe Premiere Pro, a sequence is a series of edits arranged 
in the Timeline panel that when played from beginning to end shows the order of 
your chosen clips and transitions. Clips can easily be added, removed, trimmed, 
and rearranged in a sequence. Because clips are merely instances of project media, 
any edits performed on clips in a sequence are nondestructive to the raw media on 
your system.
The easiest way to create a new sequence in Adobe Premiere Pro is to drag a clip 
to the New Item button. This will create a new sequence in the same video format, 
frame size, and frame rate as the clip.
1 Click and drag the djs and drummers subclip from the Interview bin to the New 
Item button.
A new sequence called djs and drummers appears in the Timeline. Adobe 
Premiere Pro names the sequence the same as the clip used to create it. Now 
you’ll rename the sequence.
2 In the Interview bin, click the name of the djs and drummers sequence to 
rename it.
3 Type Afrolicious Promo Edit 01 and then press Return (Enter).
Next, you’ll create a bin called Sequences to contain the sequences you’ll create 
for this project.
4 In the Project panel, click the New Bin button.
5 Type Sequences and then press Return (Enter). 

84 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
6 Drag the Afrolicious Promo Edit 01 sequence into the Sequences bin.
Note that the new bin is contained in the Interview bin, because that bin was 
already selected when you created the Sequences bin. Now you’ll move the 
Sequences bin out of the Interview bin.
7 Click and drag the Sequences bin to the left, out of the Interview bin, so that it’s 
listed above the Studio bin.
Working in the timeline
The Timeline is where you’ll do most of the work when you are editing. It’s where 
you assemble and arrange your footage, add transitions and effects, and do most of 
the creative work involved in editing film and video.
Preparing to edit in the timeline
The sequence you just created contains only a single video clip at this point. To 
fully understand the Timeline, you need to add more clips to your sequence.
1 In the Interview bin, marquee-select the clips Interview_03.mp4 through 
Interview_08.mp4.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 85
2 Click and drag the selected clips into the sequence, directly to the right of the 
existing clip.
3 Make sure the edge of the new clips snap to the edge of the existing clip, and 
then drop the new clips.
Now you have a sequence with multiple clips.
the components of the timeline
The main components of the Timeline that you’ll be working with in Adobe 
Premiere Pro are:
• Video tracks. Contain your visual elements, such as video, titles, and graphics. 
• Audio tracks. Contain your audio, such as dialogue, soundtrack, and sound effects.

86 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
• Current-time indicator. Indicates which frame in your sequence you are 
viewing in the Program Monitor. You can drag the CTI around to change your 
position in time.
• Work Area bar. Defines the active part of the sequence in your Timeline. It is 
typically used to select a portion of the Timeline to render previews or export.
editing on the timeline
Now that you have the first set of clips on your Timeline, you’ll remove one of the 
extraneous words from the subclip you created by marking that section of the 
sequence and then extracting it.
1 Drag the CTI to the beginning of the sequence, or press the Home key.
2 Press the spacebar to begin playback, and then stop playback after the first clip.
You’ll edit out the word and in Joey’s interview to make this sound bite  
flow better.
3 Park the CTI at 00:00:05:00.
4 Zoom in on your Timeline by pressing the equal (=) key on your main keyboard 
(not the numeric keypad) three times.
E Tip: If you are using 
a reduced size keyboard 
on an Apple iMac or 
MacBook, press Fn+left 
arrow to adjust your 
CTI to the beginning 
of your sequence and 
Fn+right arrow to 
adjust your CTI to the 
end of your sequence.
E Tip: To adjust your 
CTI to a specific frame 
in your sequence, click 
once on the Playhead 
Position at the top left 
of the Timeline panel, 
type in the desired 
timecode, and press 
Return (Enter).

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 87
5 Drag the CTI to the right and then back to the left again, so you can hear where 
he says the word and.
When you’re editing a sound bite, it can be helpful to view the audio waveform 
to identify when a word or phrase begins or ends.
6 Click on the Collapse-Expand Track triangle to twirl down Audio 1.
7 Hover your cursor over the divider line between Audio 1 and Audio 2 so that 
your cursor changes, and then drag downward to stretch Audio 1 vertically in 
the Timeline.
The audio waveform is now clearly visible. Next, you’ll set an In and Out point 
to select the word and.
8 Drag the CTI back and forth over the word and so you can identify it in the 
audio waveform.
9 Park the CTI at 05:17.
10 In the Program Monitor, click the Mark In button.
11 Park the CTI at 06:04.

88 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
12 In the Program Monitor, click the Mark Out button.
13 Now let’s remove the video and audio from this region of time. Click the Extract 
button. This will cut the selected region from the Timeline and move all clips in 
all unlocked tracks to the left to fill in the gap.
The video and audio of Joey saying the word “and” is removed, and all of the 
video and audio following it is moved backward in time to fill the gap.
14 Drag the CTI to the beginning of the sequence, or press the Home key.
15 Make sure that the Program Monitor is set to show the entire frame. Choose Fit 
from the Set Zoom Level menu at the bottom left of the Program Monitor.
16 Press the spacebar to play back the first 15 seconds of the edit, and then  
stop playback.
You’ll notice that the sound bite sounds great, but the video jumps where you 
cut it. That’s OK; you’ll be replacing the video of Joey with b-roll from the live 
show and the recording session. Joey’s audio will mainly serve as a narration; 
viewers won’t be seeing him onscreen at this point.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 89
Working with tracks
In Adobe Premiere Pro you can add multiple layers, or tracks, of video, audio, 
graphics, titles, and other elements. In this exercise you’ll be adding b-roll to the 
Video 2 track to cover the video of Joey’s interview.
1 Press the backslash (\) key to zoom the sequence to fit the Timeline panel.
2 In the Project panel, double-click the Live bin to open it.
3 Select Live_01.mp4. Hold down the Shift key and select Live_25-60.mp4. This 
will select all clips in between. The clips Live_26-Lights.mp4 and Live_27-
Lights.mp4 should not be selected. You’ll be using those later. Drag the Live_01.
mp4 clip to the Timeline, and then drop the series of clips on Video 2. These 
video clips have no accompanying audio.
You can turn the visibility of a track on and off by clicking the Toggle Track 
Output button.
4 Click the Toggle Track Output button for Video 2 to 
make it invisible.
5 Click the Toggle Track Output button for Video 2 again 
to make it visible.
6 Close the Live bin by selecting it and pressing 
Command+W (Ctrl+W).

lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
reordering clips on the timeline
You added the clips to the Timeline from the Live bin in the order in which they 
were listed in the bin. Now you’ll rearrange some of the clips on the Timeline so 
they play in the desired order.
Creating the overwrite edit
To begin with, you’ll move a clip to replace another clip on the Timeline.
1 Press the backslash (\) key to zoom your sequence to fit the Timeline panel.
2 Click the last clip on the Timeline in Video 2, Live_25-60.mp4, to select it.
3 Click and drag the clip to the beginning of Video 2.
The video that was previously in that part of Video 2 has been overwritten by the 
clip you just dragged and dropped. This is called an Overwrite edit. But in this 
instance you want to insert the new clip, so you need to push the rest of the clips 
down the Timeline without overwriting what’s already there.
Creating the Insert edit
Now you’ll learn a technique that allows you to insert a clip between other clips 
without overwriting.
1 Choose Edit > Undo to undo your Overwrite edit.
2 Click the last clip on the Timeline in Video 2, Live_25-60.mp4, to select it.
3 While holding down the Command 
(Ctrl) key, click and drag the clip 
to the beginning of Video 2. Notice 
how the cursor changes while you 
do this.
The clip is now inserted at the 
beginning of the video and has 
pushed the rest of the items to the 
right, or later in the sequence. This 
is called an Insert edit. The only 
problem is that it moved all of the 
items on all of the video and audio tracks. In this example, you want just the 
items on Video 2 to adjust when you insert this clip. To do this, you need to lock 
Video 1 and Audio 1.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 91
4 Choose Edit > Undo to undo your Insert edit.
5 Toggle on the Lock button on both Video 1 and Audio 1.
6 Click the last clip on the Timeline in Video 2, Live_25-60.mp4, to select it.
7 While holding down the Command (Ctrl) key, click and drag the clip to the 
beginning of Video 2.
reorder an additional clip
You’ve successfully rearranged the clips on Video 2 without overwriting existing 
content on the Timeline or rearranging the other video and audio tracks. Now 
you’ll reorder an additional clip.
1 Click the next-to-last clip on Video 2, Live_23-60.mp4.
2 While holding down the Command (Ctrl) key, click and drag the clip so it lines 
up with the beginning of the Live_01.mp4 clip on Video 2.
3 Release the mouse button.
The clip has now been inserted between the first and second clips on the 
Timeline.
4 Select the Live_02.mp4 clip on your Timeline, and while holding down the 
Command (Ctrl) key, drag it to the beginning of the Live_01.mp4 clip and drop 
it there.
E Tip: You can zoom 
in on your Timeline 
using the equal (=) key. 
Zoom out by using the 
minus (–) key.

lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
5 Move your CTI to the beginning of the sequence, and start playback to review 
your changes.
6 Stop playback.
removing clips
Nonlinear editing is nondestructive; therefore, anything that you delete from your 
sequence can be put back later if you change your mind. There is a rather long clip 
at the end of your sequence that can be removed.
1 Press the backslash key (\) to show your entire sequence.
2 Select the clip at the end, Live_24-60.mp4.
3 Press the Delete key. The clip is deleted from your sequence.
Let’s remove another clip from the sequence.
4 Find what is now the second-to-last clip in Video 2, Live_21.mp4, and select it. 
This clip shows the back of Joey’s head and is not very interesting.
5 Press the Delete key.
The clip is now removed, but notice that there is a gap where it was.
You can easily remove this gap by making any clips that appear later in the 
Timeline move to the left to fill in the gap. This is called a Ripple Delete.
6 Zoom in to your Timeline by pressing the equal (=) key.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 93
7 Click on the gap between Live_20.mp4 and Live_22.mp4.
8 Right-click on this selection and choose Ripple Delete. Live_22.mp4 
automatically moves to the left and fills in the gap.
You can use Ripple Delete to remove clips from your sequence, as well as 
remove gaps. Instead of deleting a clip and then Ripple Deleting the gap left 
behind as two separate operations, you can do both in one step.
9 Select the Live_01.mp4 clip on your Timeline.
10 Right-click on the clip and choose Ripple Delete.
The clip is now deleted from the sequence, and the clips that came later have 
filled in the empty space.
Working with audio
A well-known saying in filmmaking is audio is half the picture. It’s essential to give 
the same attention to audio in your productions as you do to the visual components.
In the Afrolicious Promo project, you’ll be working with audio from Joey’s interview, 
a track from the Afrolicious CD, as well as a sound effect.
Earlier in this lesson, you imported the Audio bin into your project. Now you’ll add 
one of the files in that bin to your sequence.
1 In the Project panel, twirl open the Audio bin.
E Tip: You can 
perform a Ripple Delete 
by selecting a clip or 
a gap and pressing 
Shift+Delete.

2 Double-click the file Can’t_Listen_Edited_Even.aif to load it into the  
Source Monitor.
3 Press the spacebar to preview the audio file.
4 In the Timeline, click the disclosure triangle on the Audio 1 track to collapse the 
track and hide its waveform.
5 In the Source Monitor, click and drag the Drag Audio Only button to the Audio 2  
track on your Timeline.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 95
6 Make sure the beginning of the audio file lines up with the beginning of the 
sequence, and then release your mouse button.
7 Adjust your CTI to the beginning of your sequence. Press the spacebar to 
preview the sequence with the new audio added. Stop playback when you’re 
finished previewing.
Note that the volume of the music makes it difficult to hear what Joey is saying. 
You’ll use the Audio Mixer to bring down the level of the music track so it’s at 
an appropriate volume relative to Joey’s voice.
8 Choose Window > Audio Mixer > Afrolicious Promo Edit 01. The Audio Mixer 
panel appears.

96 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
9 Press the spacebar to play back the sequence, and note how the meters in the 
Audio Mixer indicate the level of each audio track.
10 With the sequence playing back, click and drag down the volume fader for 
Audio 2 in the Audio Mixer until the volume is low enough so you can hear 
Joey’s voice clearly. This will be in the area of –12dB.
11 Press the spacebar to stop playback.
When adjusting audio levels, your first impulse might be to raise the level on 
the track you want to make louder. It’s usually a better idea to lower the level on 
the track you want to make quieter, because it will help avoid over modulated 
audio, which will distort and degrade in quality.
12 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
refining your story
Now that you have all of your sound bites placed on your Timeline, let’s explore 
ways to make a more dynamic story. In this exercise, you’ll learn techniques that 
will help you refine timing in your sequence.
using gaps in audio
Joey is telling a story about his experience and inspiration as a musician. One way 
to make his story more compelling is to create gaps in the talk track so that the 
music can occasionally attract the viewer’s attention. 
1 In your Timeline, unlock Video 1 and Audio 1 by clicking their Toggle Track 
Lock switches.
 Note: Audio editing 
will be covered in more 
detail in Chapter 7.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 97
2 Press the Home key to move your CTI to the beginning of the sequence. Press 
the spacebar to play your sequence. Listen carefully to the interview audio. The 
last clip, Interview_08.mp4, in which Joey says, “My confidence comes from 
the music. We can’t lose with that music behind us” is a good conclusive and 
uplifting statement; it should go at the end.
3 Select Interview_08.mp4 and drag it to the right with the Selection tool—toward 
the tail (end) of the music clip in Audio 2—to put it aside for later.
The sound bite in Interview_06.mp4 is not very good. Joey makes a somewhat 
redundant statement, and he is mumbling.
4 Select Interview_06.mp4 and press Delete. Doing so leaves a gap in the 
interview audio.
5 Now click on the Toggle Track Output switch for Audio 1 to mute it.
6 Twirl open Audio 2 to show its waveform.
7 Press Home to set your CTI at the beginning of the sequence. Press the spacebar 
to play. This time listen closely to the music track. Pay close attention for 
moments in the music that stand out and would sound good during gaps in the 
interview audio.
For instance, at 0:00:16:00, you should hear a bass riff in the music. That would 
serve as a moment for the music to be heard while there is a brief pause in the 
interview audio.
8 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:18:11.
9 Select Interview_04.mp4, hold down the Shift key, and select Interview_05.mp4.  
With the Selection tool, drag these clips to the right so that the head of 
Interview_04.mp4 lines up with the main bass riff in the music at 0:00:18:11.

10 Click the Toggle Output switch for Audio 1 to unmute it. Click the Toggle Track 
Lock switches for Video 1 and Audio 1 to lock them.
11 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
trimming edits
When you have a number of clips in your sequence, you’ll normally 
start trimming the heads (beginnings) and tails (endings) of each clip 
to adjust the pace and timing of your edit. In the third clip on your 
sequence, you’ll trim the head to remove the first 12 frames from the clip.
1 Choose the Ripple Edit tool from the Tools panel.
2 Zoom in on your Timeline using the equal (=) key. Place the cursor 
at the beginning of the Live_23-60.mp4 clip on the Timeline. Note 
that it changes to indicate a Ripple Trim.
3 Click and drag the head of the clip to the right (do not release the mouse  
button yet).
As you drag, note that the Program Monitor has changed to show you the last 
frame of the previous clip on the left and the first frame of the clip you are 
trimming on the right. This makes it easy to preview your edit.
E Tip: You can also 
press the B key to 
access the Ripple Edit 
tool.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 99
4 Move the mouse until you have trimmed 12 frames from the head. The timecode 
in the Program Monitor will show you how many frames you have trimmed.
Also notice that a tool tip next to your cursor indicates how many frames are 
being trimmed.
5 Release the mouse button.
Note that the sequence updates to represent your edit.
6 Move your CTI to the beginning of the sequence, and play back the first few 
cuts to review your changes.
using Dynamic timeline trimming
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 introduced a new feature called Dynamic Timeline 
Trimming, which allows you to trim your cuts in real time as the edit is playing 
back. You’ll use this feature to perform additional trimming.

100 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
The goal with this trim is to get the beginning of the clip Live_23-60.mp4  
to line up with the audio of Joey saying “MCs.”
1 Choose the Rolling Edit tool from the Tools panel.
2 On the Timeline, marquee-select around the edit point between 
Live_25-60.mp4 and Live_23-60.mp4 to select it.
Marquee-selecting one or more edit points automatically puts Adobe Premiere 
Pro into Trim mode.
3 Press the spacebar to begin playback.
Note that the playback loops around your edit point. As the edit plays, you can 
trim the edit point by clicking the buttons in the Program Monitor.
4 Click the –1 button to trim the edit point back in time by one frame.
Note that the edit point on the sequence moves back as you trim. As the 
sequence loops, pay attention to where Joey says the word “MCs”; this is where 
you want to trim the edit point to.
5 Click the –1 button four more times, so that you trim the edit point back in 
time by a total of five frames.
You’ve now successfully trimmed the edit point so it lines up properly with  
the audio.
E Tip: You can also 
press the N key to 
access the Rolling Edit 
tool.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 101
6 Click in any gray space in the Timeline panel to leave Trim mode.
7 Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
8 Press the backslash key (\) to show your whole sequence in the 
Timeline.
9 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
multicam editing
The project you are creating in this Classroom in a Book was shot with a single DSLR 
camera. If you are editing a project shot with multiple cameras, the Multicam edit-
ing features of Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 will help you cut between your cameras in 
real time, similar to editing a live TV show. Previously, you could work with multicam 
footage from four cameras, but now you’re limited only by the formats you’re work-
ing with and the power of your editing machine.
In Adobe Premiere Pro CS6, the process of creating a multicamera sequence has 
been greatly simplified. For more information, we recommend Adobe Premiere Pro 
CS6 Classroom in a Book (Adobe Press, 2012).
using markers
There are times when you’ll want to mark specific frames for future reference, 
either to indicate when something happens in a clip or when you want something 
to happen in your sequence.
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 lets you add markers to clips as well as to your sequence.
adding a marker to a clip
In Chapter 7 you’ll create an audio transition in your edit that will start with live 
audio of a singer recording a vocal and blend into the recorded version of the same 
song. So you’re going to add a marker in this next exercise which you’ll use later in 
Chapter 7.
1 In your Project panel in your Audio bin, double-click on Can’t_Listen_Edited_
Even.aif to open it in the Source Monitor.
2 Play the clip, and you’ll hear the vocal start at 0:00:50:09. Let’s add a marker to 
this frame in the clip.
E Tip: You can also 
press the V key to 
access the Selection 
tool.

102 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
3 At the bottom of the Source Monitor is a row of icons. Click the Add Marker icon.
You should see a marker in the Source Monitor at the current frame.
You should also see a marker on the music clip in the Timeline at the same 
corresponding frame.
This marker will indicate for us later when to start the video clip of the singer 
recording the same vocal.
adding a marker to a sequence
In Chapter 5 you’ll create a motion graphic in Adobe After Effects CS6 that will be 
exactly five seconds long. You’ll want the end of that motion graphic to coincide 
with the end of the music clip in your sequence. And you’ll want to save the last 
five seconds of your edit for the motion graphic and not put any other video clips 
in those last five seconds. Therefore, you need to add a marker to your sequence to 
indicate when the motion graphic will begin.
1 Select your Timeline and press the End key. Your CTI will jump to the last 
frame of your edit, which is at 0:01:09:04. Move your CTI backward exactly five 
seconds to 0:01:04:04.
At the bottom of the Program Monitor is a row of icons similar to the row of 
icons on the Source Monitor.
E Tip: Press the M key 
to add a marker at the 
current frame to a clip 
in the Source Monitor.
E Tip: Pressing 
Shift+left arrow moves 
your CTI backward five 
frames; Shift+right 
arrow moves your CTI 
forward five frames.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 103
2 Click the Add Marker icon to add a sequence marker at the current frame.
You’ll add one more marker to your sequence to mark where another shot will go.
3 In your Project panel in the Joey bin, double-click Joey_01.mp4 to open it in the 
Source Monitor. In Chapter 4 you’ll add this clip to your sequence toward the 
end, right before where the end motion graphic will go. 
4 Select your Timeline and go to 0:01:01:04. Add a new marker at this frame by 
clicking the Add Marker icon in the Program Monitor or by pressing the M key. 
This marker indicates where Joey_01.mp4 will go later and will remind you not 
to place any other video clips on the Timeline after this marker.
5 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
Clip markers vs. sequence markers
A sequence marker is attached to a specific frame in the sequence, whereas a clip 
marker is attached to a specific frame on a clip. Sequence markers do not move as 
clips move in the sequence. However, if a clip with a marker on it is moved in the 
sequence, its marker will move in time with it.
E Tip: Press the M 
key to add a marker at 
the current frame of a 
sequence.

104 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
using snap
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 has a handy Snap feature, which makes it easy to move 
your CTI between edit points in your sequence as well as add clips to your 
sequence and move clips in your sequence.
snapping between edit points
The Snap feature is turned on by default and can be toggled on and off by pressing 
the Snap icon at the top left of the Timeline.
1 Scrub your CTI through your Timeline with the Shift key held down. You’ll 
notice that the CTI “snaps” between edit points and markers automatically.  
Edit points and marker locations appear as white triangles when the CTI is 
snapped to them.
2 Click the Snap icon to deactivate it. Now scrub through your Timeline. Notice 
how the CTI no longer snaps to edit points and markers.
3 Click the Snap icon to reactivate it.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 105
snapping clips into a sequence
The Snap feature also simplifies adding clips to your sequence. You’ll use the Snap 
feature as you place clips in Video 3.
1 In your Project panel, twirl open the Studio bin, if it isn’t already open.
2 Double-click on Studio_01.mp4 to open it in the Source Monitor. Play the  
entire clip.
You’ll see the singer at the microphone as he records his vocal. The first ten 
seconds of the clip show some erratic camera movement as well as the singer 
stopping to recompose himself. You won’t use that part.
However, you will use the segment starting at 00:00:11:11, as he begins singing 
“I can’t listen…” all the way to 00:00:21:06, as he finishes singing “… I could 
never go for that.”
3 In the Source Monitor, adjust the CTI to 00:00:11:11 and set the clip’s In point 
by pressing the I key.
4 Adjust the CTI to 00:00:21:06 and set the clip’s Out point by pressing the O key.
5 Select your Timeline, hold down the Shift key, and adjust your CTI to snap at 
the clip marker on the music clip in Audio 2. You may want to zoom in on your 
Timeline by pressing the equal (=) key a few times to make sure that your CTI is 
on the clip marker.

106 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
6 Go back to the Source Monitor, click on the video frame, and drag the clip 
directly into the Timeline on Video 3 so that the clip’s head snaps to the clip 
marker and the CTI. The accompanying audio should land in Audio 3. 
7 Adjust your CTI to a few seconds before Studio_01.mp4 and press the spacebar 
to play the clip.
Listen closely; you’ll notice that the timing of the singer and the vocal on the music 
track are practically in synch. Also notice, again, how tracks operate in Adobe 
Premiere Pro. Because Studio_01.mp4 is on a track above Live_18.mp4, you do not 
see Live_18.mp4.
snapping clips within a sequence
If Snap is enabled, when you move clips within a sequence, the clip’s head or tail 
will snap to markers or edit points.
Let’s move Interview_08.mp4 so that its tail snaps to the sequence marker at 
0:01:04:04.
1 Deactivate the locks on Video 1 and Audio 1 by clicking their Toggle Track Lock 
switches.
2 Double click on Interview_08.mp4 in the Timeline. It will appear in the Source 
Monitor.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 107
3 Play the clip. At 00:00:04:19, after Joey says, “We can’t lose with that music 
behind us,” press the O key to set the clip’s Out point. You’ll see that the clip’s 
Out point has been trimmed in the Timeline as well.
4 Select your Timeline. Hold down the Shift key and scrub your CTI so that it 
snaps at the marker at 0:01:04:04.
5 Click and drag the Interview_08.mp4 clip in the Timeline so that its tail snaps 
to the CTI.

lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
You’ve now set markers indicating where clips will go eventually in your Timeline, 
and you’ve set clips at specific frames in relation to markers either on other clips or in  
the sequence. These clips and markers will not move or have their timing adjusted. 
As you can see, the snap feature allows you to make precise edits to your sequence, 
and you are encouraged to use it.
Finishing Your rough edit
The rest of the edit will be motivated by moments in the interview audio or the 
music. If you’re editing a movie that has a voice-over that drives the story, it’s 
logical to edit video clips in your sequence that supplement what the voice-over 
mentions. Also, if your edit has an underlying music track, certain moments in the 
music, such as tempo transitions, can be enhanced by applying video edits at the 
same time in your sequence.
adding more studio clips
Let’s go ahead and add some clips to accompany the voice-over.
1 Adjust your CTI to the head of Interview_07.mp4 in the Timeline and press the 
spacebar to play the clip.
Joey says, “We try to take some of that inspiration from a gig and turn it into a 
song in the studio.” This sound bite could serve as a transition point to the shots 
of Joey and the singer in the recording studio.
2 In the Project panel, double-click on the Studio bin to open it.
3 Click the Icon View icon to display all of the clips in the bin in Icon view.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 109
Only two of these clips have audio. You can determine this by the waveform 
icon at the bottom right of a clip’s icon.
trim a clip with a sound bite
As an editor, always be looking and listening for moments in your clips that could 
match together and give your story a consistent narrative flow.
Let’s trim a clip to a usable sound bite. You’ll use trimming techniques that were 
covered earlier in this lesson.
1 Double-click on Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4 to open it in the Source Monitor.
2 Press the spacebar to play it. In this clip, Joey and the singer are talking 
enthusiastically about recording a vocal. This shot would fit perfectly in your 
edit after the sound bite of Joey’s mention of bringing inspiration from his live 
shows into the studio.
4 Set the CTI in the Source Monitor to 00:00:01:09 as Joey is about to say  
“Yo, man, we should do that vocal.” Press the I key to set this clip’s In point.
5 Set the CTI in the Source 
Monitor to 00:00:03:15 
after the singer says, “Let’s 
do it, man.” Press the O key 
to set this clip’s Out point.
6 Click on the video frame 
in the Source Monitor and 
drag the clip into your 
Timeline in Video 3, so 
that its tail snaps to the 
head of Studio_01.mp4. 
The accompanying audio 
will be put in Audio 3.

110 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
add a studio sound bite to your sequence
Now you’ll take that sound bite you just created and add it to your sequence.
1 Adjust your CTI to just before the Interview_07.mp4 clip, and then press the 
spacebar to play the clip.
Notice that there is roughly a one-second pause between Joey saying “turn it 
into a song in the studio” and the Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4 clip of Joey saying 
“Yo, man, we should do that vocal.” This pause should be removed to maintain 
the pace of the narrative.
2 Select Interview_07.mp4 in the Timeline with the Selection tool. Drag it to the 
right so that its tail snaps to the head of Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4.
3 Adjust your CTI to just before the Interview_07.mp4 clip, and then press the 
spacebar to play the clip.
The pause is now gone. Also, because you moved Interview_07.mp4 in the 
Timeline, there is now more of a gap between it and Interview_05.mp4, allowing 
the music to be heard in that gap of time.
Bridging the Live clips to the studio clips
There are a few other Studio clips that you could use to smooth the visual transition 
from the Live clips to the Studio clips. Let’s go ahead and edit these clips together.
1 In the Studio bin, hover-scrub Studio_03.mp4 to preview the frames in this clip, 
which shows Joey in his studio working with audio software on his computer.
2 Hover-scrub Studio_04.mp4 to preview the frames in this clip, which shows a 
close-up of Joey’s hands on a synthesizer keyboard.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 111
These two clips would not only match well together in your edit, but also 
reinforce the sound bite of Joey talking about working in the studio, and thus 
serve as a logical visual transition between the Live clips and the Studio clips.
3 Select Studio_03.mp4, hold down the Command (Ctrl) key, and select 
Studio_04.mp4. Drag these clips into Video 3 in your Timeline so that the tail  
of Studio_04.mp4 snaps to the head of Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4.
4 Adjust the CTI in your Timeline to just before Interview_07.mp4, and then 
press the spacebar to play back your changes.
When Joey says the word “inspiration,” that could serve as an edit point between 
the Live clips and the Studio clips.
5 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:43:12.
6 Select the head of Studio_03.mp4 in Video 3.
7 Using the Selection tool, trim the head of this clip to the right until the cursor 
snaps to the CTI.

112 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
applying an L-cut
A common editing technique called an L-cut entails letting the audio of one clip 
play over the video of the following clip. This type of edit not only helps quicken 
the visual pace of a story, but provides a narrative connection between two shots 
that might be unrelated.
Your viewers probably don’t need to see the entire Studio_01.mp4 clip in your 
sequence, because the action is clearly established. You can insert other Studio  
clips on Video 3 that will show as the audio of the singer continues.
1 Scrub your CTI through the Timeline over Studio_01.mp4. Find the moment 
before you hear the singer take a breath, at 0:00:54:23.
2 Make a new marker at this frame by pressing the M key.
3 In the Studio bin, hover-scrub Studio_02.mp4. It shows the singer at the 
microphone recording a vocal. You probably don’t want to use this clip because 
his visible lip movements wouldn’t match the vocal heard in the edit, and that 
would be distracting to the viewer.
4 Hover-scrub Studio_05.mp4, which shows the singer at the microphone and 
Joey dancing to the music. This was taken at a reverse angle from Studio_01.mp4, 
so it would be a good edit match.
5 Hover-scrub Studio_06.mp4, which shows them sitting at the computer 
listening to their recorded track. This would logically follow Studio_05.mp4, 
because it shows a progression of action.
You saw them recording the song and now they are listening to it. The magic of 
editing allows you and the viewer to skip ahead in time.
6 Select Studio_05.mp4, hold down 
the Command (Ctrl) key, and select 
Studio_06.mp4 so that they are both 
selected.
7 With the Selection tool, drag these 
clips to Video 3 in the Timeline, 
so that the head of Studio_05.mp4 
snaps to the marker you had made at 
0:00:54:23.
Notice that by doing this, the last half of 
the video frames of Studio_01.mp4 have 
been over-written, yet the audio remains 
in Audio 3.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 113
removing flash frames
A flash frame is either a very short clip (only a few frames long) or a short gap 
in-between clips that causes a brief “flash” during playback, which can be quite  
distracting to the viewer. Since we have a flash frame here, let’s remove it.
1 Scrub the CTI in your Timeline back several seconds, and then press the 
spacebar to review your changes.
If you were paying close attention, you may have noticed that a couple of 
frames from Studio_01.mp4 were not overwritten by performing this edit in the 
previous exercise and are visible after Studio_06.mp4.
2 Scrub your CTI to the end of Studio_06.mp4. Press the equal key (=) several 
times to zoom in to show one-frame increments in your Timeline.
3 Select this bit of frames of Studio_01.mp4 on Video 3 and press Delete.
Final trimming
Studio_06.mp4 could probably be shortened a little, so let’s do that now.
1 Zoom out by pressing the minus key (–) four times.
2 Scrub your CTI to the head of Studio_06.mp4 in your Timeline. Scrub your  
CTI forward and find the moment in the audio when you hear “I could never  
go for that.” Park your CTI on the frame right before where you hear the word 
“go,” at 0:00:58:13.

114 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
3 Select the tail of Studio_06.mp4 with the Selection tool. Drag to the left to trim 
the tail of this clip until it snaps to the CTI.
4 Select your Studio bin and press Command+W (Ctrl+W) to close it. 
5 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
For now, you’re finished editing the Studio clips on Video 3.
editing the Live clips
Now let’s concentrate on editing the clips in Video 2.
1 Click the Toggle Track Output switch for Video 3 to turn it off.
2 Press the backslash key (\) to show your entire sequence in the Timeline.
3 Press Home to adjust your CTI to the beginning of your sequence. Press the 
spacebar to play the sequence. Pay attention to moments in the Interview sound 
bites that would serve as logical edit points for the clips in Video 2.
For instance, in Interview_03.mp4 when Joey says, “blurring lines between 
audience and performer,” you could use that as a moment to cut between a shot 
of the crowd and a shot of the musicians on stage.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 115
4 Adjust your CTI to the frame after Joey says “audience,” at 0:00:11:05, and create 
a marker by pressing the M key.
Conveniently, the next clip on Video 2, Live_03.mp4, is a shot of the crowd.
5 Zoom in on your Timeline by pressing the equal (=) key as many times as 
needed to see the clip names.
6 Select Live_03.mp4, and then drag it to the left until its head snaps to the marker 
you just made. This will create a small gap in Video 2.

116 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
7 Now scrub the CTI forward to when Joey begins to say, “and performer,” at 
0:00:13:00. This is where you will place a shot of performers on stage, of which 
there are many.
8 Create a marker on this frame by pressing the M key.
9 Scrub forward to Live_18.mp4 on Video 2. This is the clip that shows a bright 
light shining on one of the musicians.
using empty space in video tracks to rearrange clips
In Premiere Pro CS6, you can temporarily place clips in an empty region of a video 
track while you move other clips around in an occupied track to make room for the 
clips you want to place in the occupied track. While this technique may not be the 
most elegant way to work, sometimes rearranging clips in your sequence requires 
making good use of empty space in your Timeline interface. That said, be careful not 
to leave clips in your Timeline where they should not be. Stay organized as you work.
1 Select Live_18.mp4 in Video 2 and drag it into Video 3 so that its head snaps to 
the marker at 0:00:13:00.
2 Show your entire sequence by pressing the backslash key (\).
E Tip: Press the equal 
key (=) to zoom in to 
your Timeline. Press the 
minus key (–) to zoom 
out of your Timeline.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 117
3 Marquee-select all of the clips in Video 2 from Live_04.mp4 to Live_17.mp4.  
Be careful not to accidentally select anything in Video 3 and Video 1.
4 Click and drag these clips so that the head of Live_04.mp4 snaps to the tail of 
Live_18.mp4.
5 Now select Live_18.mp4 in Video 3 and drag it 
down into Video 2, making sure that you are not 
also adjusting its timing in the sequence.

118 
lesson 3 
Creating a basic edit
Finding a good edit point
Let’s find another point in the music track that could motivate a visual edit.
1 Adjust the CTI forward to 0:00:29:06. The music increases tempo right here, 
which could help motivate another edit in the video.
2 Press the equal (=) key to zoom in so that you can see the clip names in  
the Timeline.
3 Marquee-select Live_08.mp4 through Live_13.mp4 in Video 2.
4 Drag these clips to the left until the head of Live_08.mp4 snaps to the CTI.
5 Press Space Bar to play your sequence and review your edit.
removing clips
Now let’s remove some clips in Video 2 that aren’t needed. Don’t be afraid to make 
editing decisions that may seem brutal, because in most cases, no matter how good 
the footage is, you can’t use it all.
1 Live_14.mp4 just shows a stage light. It doesn’t add anything to the story, so 
select it and press Delete.
2 Live_15.mp4 is another shot of a turntable. It’s redundant because there is 
already a shot like this. Select Live_15.mp4 and press Delete.
3 Live_16.mp4 is a crowd shot and is mostly in silhouette. Select it and press 
Delete.
4 Live_17.mp4 is another redundant shot of an instrument. Select it and press 
Delete.
5 The framing in Live_19.mp4 is off balance, and it only shows Joey’s arm. Select  
it and press Delete.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 119
6 The lighting in Live_20.mp4 is a bit dark. Select it and press Delete.
Removing these clips leaves a large gap in Video 2, but the clips in Video 3 cover 
the gap.
adding a closing shot
Now you need a closing Live shot to go before the marker at 0:01:01:04.  
Live_22.mp4 is a well-composed shot from the crowd’s point of view, because  
it shows Joey smiling on stage.
1 Select Live_22.mp4 and drag it to the left until its tail snaps to the marker at 
0:01:01:04.

review answers
1 Bins are where you organize your media, making it easy to find what you’re looking  
for during the editing process.
2 A subclip is a portion of an existing clip. Making subclips allows you to extract sound 
bites from a long interview clip.
3 Toggling the Lock button on Video and Audio tracks in the Timeline will prevent you 
from making any unwanted changes on those tracks.
4 In the Audio Mixer you use the Volume fader to raise or lower the volume of an  
Audio track.
5 Dynamic Timeline Trimming allows you to loop playback of an edit point and trim  
it in real time. This can help you line up edit points with audio or other visual or  
aural cues.
6 The Snap feature allows the CTI to easily adjust to edit points in the Timeline. It also 
allows easy adjustment of the CTI to clip markers and sequence markers.

lesson 4 
Advanced editing techniques
versioning your edit
If you are continuing from the previous lesson, feel free to continue with the Adobe 
Premiere Pro project you already have open. If you are starting at this lesson, navi-
gate to the Lesson 04 folder on your hard drive and open the Adobe Premiere Pro 
project Lesson_04 Start.prproj. Save your Adobe Premiere Pro project file in the 
Lesson 04 folder as Afrolicious Promo.prproj.
Because you are continuing with a previous version of this edit, you’ll first save a 
new version of your sequence. This allows you to go back to the original version if 
need be and is a recommended best practice in the video editing workflow.
1 In the Project panel, twirl open the Sequences bin.
2 Click on the Afrolicious Promo Edit 01 sequence to select it. Choose Edit > 
Copy to copy it to your clipboard. Then choose Edit > Paste.
This will make a duplicate of this sequence outside of the Sequences folder.
3 To modify the name of the sequence, click on the name of the sequence to  
select it.
4 Change the name of the sequence to Afrolicious Promo Edit 02, press Return 
(Enter) and drag it into the Sequences folder.
E Tip: Press 
Command+C (Ctrl+C) 
to copy; press 
Command+V (Ctrl+V) 
to paste. 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 125
5 Double-click the Afrolicious Promo Edit 02 sequence to load it in your Timeline.
Note that the sequence appears in a new tabbed Timeline panel in front of your 
original sequence.
Having multiple Timeline panels open simultaneously can be useful in certain 
situations, but it can also be confusing. For the time being, you’ll close the 
first Timeline to eliminate the possibility of accidentally modifying the wrong 
sequence.
6 In the Timeline panel, click the Afrolicious Promo Edit 01 tab to select it.
7 Press Command+W (Ctrl+W) to close this sequence. You can also click on the x 
in the corner of the tab to close it.
The new sequence is now the only one visible in the Timeline, which will ensure 
that you are working on the most recent iteration.
adding transitions
In the previous lesson, you created a basic edit containing “hard cuts,” meaning that 
each clip cuts directly into the next. In many instances, you can move between cuts 
more gracefully with a transition. A transition can serve as a storytelling device to 
indicate the passage of time or a change of location.
The most commonly used transition is a dissolve, which blends the tail of one clip 
with the head of the next clip. The term dissolve dates back to traditional film 
editing where the frames of celluloid were literally dissolved together in a chemi-
cal bath to merge them together. With Adobe Premiere Pro, you can add a dissolve 
simply by clicking and dragging.

126 
lesson 4 
Advanced editing techniques
Because the first few clips in the edit happen over a calm portion of the music, 
transitioning between them with dissolves will help give a calmer feeling to that 
portion of the edit. Let’s add those dissolves now.
1 Click on the Timeline panel, and then press the backslash (\) key to zoom your 
sequence to fit the Timeline panel.
2 Drag the current time indicator (CTI) to the beginning of the sequence, and 
then play back the first 10 seconds of the edit.
At about 9 seconds, the music track starts to pick up energy, and the existing 
straight cuts will work well from that point forward. For the edit points before  
9 seconds, you’ll add a dissolve.
3 Press Shift+7 to open the Effects panel.
4 In the search field, type dissolve.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 127
Note that as you type, Adobe Premiere Pro filters out the list to show you only 
those effects containing the text you are typing. In this case, you’ll see the 
dissolve effects after typing the first few letters; it is not necessary to type the 
entire word dissolve.
Also, note the yellow square around the icon for Cross Dissolve. This yellow 
square indicates that this transition is set as the current default Video Transition.
5 Make sure that the Track Header for Video 2 is highlighted in the Timeline.  
If it is not, click it. Doing this will ensure that transitions will be applied to  
clips in this track when using the Apply Video Transition keyboard shortcut or 
menu command.
6 In the Timeline, hold down the Shift key and scrub the CTI so it snaps to the 
first edit point, which is between the clips Live_25-60.mp4 and Live_23-60.mp4.
7 Zoom in by pressing the equal (=) key on your keyboard (not the numeric keypad).
8 Drag and drop the Cross Dissolve effect from the Effects panel onto the edit 
point on your Timeline. You can also use the Apply Video Transition keyboard 
shortcut, Command+D (Ctrl+D). Verify that the transition overlaps both clips.
9 Use the Play Around shortcut (Shift+K) to automatically adjust your CTI two 
seconds before the current frame (or preroll), and then play two seconds after 
the current frame (or postroll). This allows you to preview your transition.
Next, you’ll add a transition at the beginning of the edit so it fades in from 
black. This will make for a more graceful start to the piece.
Because you’ll be applying a similar transition as before, you can copy that 
Cross Dissolve that you just made and paste it here.
E Tip: To change the 
default transition, right-
click on a transition 
in the Effects panel, 
and then choose Set 
Selected as Default 
Transition from the 
context menu.
E Tip: You can zoom 
in on your Timeline 
using the equal (=) key. 
Zoom out by using the 
minus (–) key.
E Tip: Change the 
preroll and postroll 
values in the Playback 
preferences to set how 
many seconds before 
and after the current 
frame that Adobe 
Premiere Pro will play 
back after pressing 
Shift+K.

10 Select the transition clip between Live_25-60.mp4 and Live_23-60.mp4. Press 
Command+C (Ctrl+C).
11 Press Home to adjust your CTI to the beginning of the sequence. Press 
Command+V (Ctrl+V) to paste the transition.
12 Press Shift+K to play back the first few seconds.
Note that the video in Video 1 is visible during the transition. Because you are 
only using the audio from Joey’s interview, not the video, you’ll toggle off the 
visibility of Video 1.
13 Click the Toggle Track Output button on Video 1.
14 Go to the beginning of the sequence and play back the first few seconds.
Now the video fades in from black. Next, you’ll modify the duration of the 
transition so it lasts one second.
15 In the Timeline, double-click on the transition clip.
Doing this will show the Effect Controls for the transition, which shows the 
duration is currently 12 frames.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 129
16 Click on the duration value to make it editable. Type 100 and press Return 
(Enter). Notice that Adobe Premiere Pro translates 100 to 00:00:01:00.
17 Play back your changes to review them.
the most-used transitions
As tempting as it might be to use the video transitions with wild abandon, in terms 
of style, it’s probably not a good idea. Apart from a standard cut transition, only a 
few video transitions should even be considered unless there are special project-
specific circumstances:
• 
A Cross Dissolve fades out clip A while fading in clip B. Cross Dissolves can also 
work well at the beginning or end of a clip when you want to fade in or out from 
black. A Cross Dissolve can indicate passage of time or a change in location to 
the viewer.
• 
A Wipe transition replaces clip A with clip B by revealing clip B in a linear or 
radial fashion. A Wipe is generally used to indicate a change in location.
• 
An Additive Dissolve functions much like a Cross Dissolve. However, in an 
Additive Dissolve, the luminance values of clip A and clip B are gradually 
added together so that at the halfway point of the transition there is a peak of 
brightness. This makes the transition a bit more noticeable and stylized than a 
Cross Dissolve.
Creating effects in adobe Premiere Pro
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 comes bundled with several dozen effects that enable you 
to perform simple and complex tasks, such as color correction, blurring and sharp-
ening, audio enhancement, texturing, chroma keying, and a variety of other effects 
to enhance your edit. Having the ability to apply effects to clips in Adobe Premiere 
Pro yields efficiency in your workflow, because you don’t always have to use another 
program, such as Adobe After Effects, to create visual effects for your edit.
The most relevant and most important use of effects by far, for most editors, is the 
ability to adjust contrast and exposure, and make color correction enhancements. 
The Three-Way Color Corrector effect in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 has been greatly 
enhanced and will be covered in Chapter 8.

130 
lesson 4 
Advanced editing techniques
Let’s do a simple exercise that demonstrates some of the general rules about effects 
in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. You’ll apply multiple effects to a clip to give it an “old 
film” look, and then save those effects and their settings as a preset.
applying an effect to a clip
First up is applying a simple effect to a clip. You’ll apply the Black & White effect in 
this exercise.
1 Press Shift+7 to access the Effects panel. You need to find the Black & White 
effect, which desaturates a clip.
2 In the search field, type the word black, which will reveal all effects with that 
word in their names.
3 Select the Black & White effect, and drag it onto the first clip in your sequence, 
Live_25-60.mp4.
4 Press Shift+5 to access the Effect Controls panel of this selected clip. The Black 
& White effect is a very basic effect and has no controls.
5 Now let’s give this clip a bit of sepia tone. In the Effects panel, type tint in the 
search field.
6 Select the Tint effect and drag it onto Live_25-60.mp4.
Change the Tint settings so black is mapped to orange.
E Tip: Double-click 
to apply an effect to a 
selected clip, or series 
of selected clips.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 131
7 In the Effect Controls panel, click on the Map Black To color swatch. In the 
Color Picker, choose a fully saturated bright orange, and then click OK.
8 In the Tint Effect Controls panel, set Amount to Tint to 25%.
The clip should now look sepia toned.
Changing render order of effects
The top-to-bottom stacking order of effects in the Effect Controls panel determines 
their rendering order. Currently, Black & White is stacked above Tint; therefore, 
Black & White renders and then Tint renders. You can change the rendering order 
by adjusting the stacking order of effects.

132 
lesson 4 
Advanced editing techniques
1 In the Effect Controls panel, select the Tint effect. Drag it above the Black & 
White effect.
Notice that the clip is no longer sepia toned as before. The reason is that the clip 
is being tinted, and then the result of that is made black and white.
2 Press Command+Z (Ctrl+Z) to undo this last action.
Copying and pasting effects
You can copy and paste effects between clips in the Timeline. Doing this can ulti-
mately save you time if you need to apply the same effect(s) with the same setting(s) 
on multiple clips.
1 Select the Black & White effect in the Effect Controls panel. Hold down 
the Command (Ctrl) key and select the Tint effect. Both are now selected. 
Press Command+C (Ctrl+C) to copy.
2 In your Timeline, select the Live_23-60.mp4 clip. Press Command+V (Ctrl+V) 
to paste.
3 Press the Home key, and then press the spacebar to play your sequence from the 
beginning. The first two clips in your sequence now appear sepia toned.
The first two clips in your sequence have these two effects applied to them. But 
what if you wanted to apply these effects to all of the clips in your sequence? 
You could copy and paste these effects to each clip in your sequence. However, if  
you changed the effect settings on one of the clips to maintain consistency, you  
would then have to change the settings on all other clips, which would be tedious 
and time-consuming. There is a better way and that’s by using adjustment layers.
adjustment layers
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 now features Adjustment Layers, which are special layers 
that allow you to apply one or more effects to several clips at the same time using 
the same effect settings. Let’s see how these Adjustment Layers work.
1 Press Command+Z (Ctrl+Z) to undo pasting the effects to Live_23-60.mp4.
2 Click the Project panel tab. Make an Adjustment Layer by choosing File > New >  
Adjustment Layer.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 133
3 In the Adjustment Layer window that appears, make sure that the settings 
match your sequence settings. The Width should be 1280, the Height should 
be 720, the Timebase should be 23.976 fps, and Pixel Aspect Ratio should be 
Square Pixels (1.0). Click OK.
This new Adjustment Layer should appear in your Project panel.
4 Select this Adjustment Layer and drag it into your Timeline, on Video 3, so its 
head snaps to the beginning of the sequence.
5 By itself, the Adjustment Layer is not visible. However, if one or more effects are 
applied to the Adjustment Layer, those effects are rendered on the clips in the 
track(s) below the Adjustment Layer.
Now let’s apply the Black & White and Tint effects to the Adjustment Layer. 
You can cut them from the Live_25-60.mp4 layer and paste them onto the 
Adjustment Layer. In this example, you don’t want the effects on the video clip 
if they will be applied to the Adjustment Layer.
6 Select Live_25-60.mp4 in the Timeline. Press Shift+5 to access its Effect 
Controls panel.
7 Select the Black & White effect. Hold down the Command (Ctrl) key and select 
the Tint effect.
 Note: If a bin is 
selected in your Project 
panel when you create 
an Adjustment Layer, 
the Adjustment Layer 
will appear inside 
the selected bin. The 
Adjustment Layer can  
then be dragged else-
where in the Project panel.

8 Press Command+X (Ctrl+X) to cut the effects from the video clip.
In your Program Monitor, notice that the effects are not rendering on  
Live_25-60.mp4 anymore.
9 In your Timeline, select the Adjustment Layer. Press Command+V (Ctrl+V) to 
paste the effects.
10 Scrub the CTI in your Timeline to Live_23-60.mp4. Notice that the effects 
applied to the Adjustment layer render on it because the clip is in a track below 
the Adjustment Layer.
Now that these two effects are on the Adjustment Layer, you can extend the tail 
of the Adjustment Layer to render the effects on more clips in Video 2.
11 Show your entire sequence in the Timeline by pressing the backslash (\) key.
12 Select the tail of the Adjustment Layer and drag to the right so the Adjustment 
Layer covers more clips in Video 2.
13 Scrub your CTI forward in the Timeline to verify that more clips in Video 2 are 
now sepia toned. Because the Adjustment Layer is a single clip, you need to 
adjust only its Effect Controls to modify how its effects render on all clips in the 
track(s) below it.

saving and exporting presets
Effects and their settings can be saved as a preset, which allows you to easily apply 
the effects and their settings on clips in your Timeline without having to copy and 
paste them between layers. Also, because presets can be saved as files on your hard 
drive, they can be copied between different computers and applied by other users 
in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. Let’s save and export a preset now.
1 Select the Adjustment Layer in your Timeline. Press Shift+5 to access the Effect 
Controls panel.
2 Select the Black & White Effect, and then hold down the Command (Ctrl) key 
and select the Tint effect.
3 Right-click on either of these effects and choose Save Preset.
4 In the Save Preset window that appears, type Old Film in the Name field to 
name the preset. Click OK.
5 To verify that this preset works, press Delete to remove the two selected effects.
6 Press Shift+7 to access the Effects panel. Select any text that may be in the 
search field and press Delete.
7 Click the disclosure triangle next to the Presets folder to twirl it open. You 
should see a preset called Old Film.
8 Select this preset, and then drag it onto the Adjustment Layer in the Timeline. 
The saved effect settings are once again applied to the Adjustment Layer.
This exercise was just a demonstration. You really don’t want to use this old-film 
look or this Adjustment Layer in your sequence, so let’s modify the sequence now.
 Note: Presets can 
also save settings for 
Motion and Opacity.

9 In the Project panel, select the Adjustment Layer, and then press Delete. Click 
Yes in the warning window that appears to confirm that you want to remove the 
Adjustment Layer from the project.
The Adjustment Layer should no longer be in your Timeline.
10 Press Shift+7 to access the Effects panel again. Notice that the Old Film preset is 
still there and could be utilized later if desired.
But it can also be exported and shared with other users.
11 Right-click on the Old Film preset and choose Export Presets.
12 In the Export Presets window, navigate to your Lesson 04 folder. Save the Preset 
as Old Film and click Save.
third-party effect plug-ins
In addition to the effects that come bundled with Adobe Premiere Pro, many third-party effect plug-ins can be 
installed separately. These third-party effect plug-ins are useful because sometimes the features available with 
native Adobe Premiere Pro effects are insufficient for your project’s needs. Third-party effect plug-ins are some-
times available as a free download from the Internet, but there are also some popular effects that are available 
as a separate purchase. Often, third-party effect plug-ins for Adobe Premiere Pro are also available for Adobe 
After Effects.
Here is a short list of third-party effect plug-ins that are available for Adobe Premiere Pro CS6:
Red Giant Software (www.redgiantsoftware.com)
• 
Magic Bullet Suite is a bundle of color-correction effects that enable you to easily color correct and add 
different grades to your project. The suite also includes Colorista II, a professional color-grading tool, as well 
as multiple presets for Magic Bullet Looks.
• 
Trapcode Shine, as the name suggests, enhances the luminance of a clip by creating the visual effect of 
bursting light. This is useful, for example, in adding style to text or for creating interesting science fiction 
visual effects.
Digieffects (www.digieffects.com)
• 
Delirium is a bundle of 45 different effects for generating particles, performing color correction, distorting 
and displacing, and enhancing Premiere Pro’s compositing capabilities.
• 
Damage is a bundle of various effects for making your clean video footage look degraded and aged.
Boris FX (www.borisfx.com)
• 
Boris Continuum Complete AE is a bundle of over 200 effects for image restoration, color correction,  
3D particle effects, blurs, glows, and more.

keying and compositing 
green screen footage
One of the most useful techniques to learn in video postproduction is convincingly 
inserting a subject recorded in front of a green (or blue) background into a scene, 
thereby creating the illusion to the viewer that the subject is actually part of that 
scene. The most common and effective method of achieving this effect is called 
chroma keying.
The typical workflow for chroma keying starts by recording the subject in front of 
an evenly-lit green or blue background. After importing the footage into Adobe 
Premiere Pro, you remove the background with a Chroma Key effect (and some-
times a garbage matte), which enables the compositing of the subject with another 
shot or scene. This technique is used on a range of media—from major motion 
pictures to the weather report on your local TV news.
How easy or difficult it is to pull a “clean key” (which is essential to achieve a con-
vincing final result) depends on a variety of factors having to do with the quality of 
the footage:
• Was the background evenly lit? Proper lighting while shooting green screen 
footage is crucial. Chroma Key effects work by sampling the color of the green 
screen and then making that transparent. If the green screen was not evenly lit, 
it will appear as more than one shade of green. Therefore, sampling one area of 
the green screen will not make the whole green screen transparent.
• Was the footage recorded in a video format optimal for chroma keying? You 
should record your green screen footage at the highest resolution possible and 
with minimal compression, so that the foreground subject has smooth edges 
and no image artifacts.
• Was the foreground subject semitransparent? If your foreground subject has 
long flowing hair or is wearing semitransparent clothing, the color of the green 
screen showing through the semitransparency will not be consistent with the 
unobstructed areas of green screen in frame and will result in more time spent 
pulling a clean key.
These and other factors will determine whether you can achieve a satisfactory 
result with a single click, or if you’ll need to make some adjustments to get the look 
you want.

138 
lesson 4 
Advanced editing techniques
Creating the garbage matte
In some green screen footage, you can remove objects in the shot by simply crop-
ping out that part of the frame. This is known as creating a garbage matte.
In the following exercise, you’ll include a green screen shot in the edit and apply a 
Chroma Key effect to it. Then you’ll composite another clip in a video track below 
the Chroma Key clip that will show through the transparency.
1 In the Project panel, twirl open the Joey bin and find the clip Joey_01.mp4. 
Double-click on this clip to display it in the Source Monitor.
2 Play the entire clip. 
Don’t use the beginning of the clip when the camera zooms out. Instead, trim 
the clip to the desired segment.
3 In the Source Monitor, adjust the CTI to 0:00:07:00 and press the I key to set 
this clip’s In point. Adjust the CTI to 0:00:09:23 and press the O key to set this 
clip’s Out point.
4 Click the Drag Video Only icon at the bottom of the Source Monitor, and then drag  
this trimmed clip into the Timeline on track Video 3 so the head of the clip snaps 
to the marker at 0:01:01:04. You want to leave a gap in Video 2 directly below.
5 In your Timeline, adjust your CTI to just before this clip. Press the spacebar to 
play the sequence.
Notice that at the end of the shot the camera pans left, and you see the corner of 
the wall behind the green screen. You’ll remove this extraneous object from the 
shot by creating a garbage matte. 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 139
6 Press Shift+7 to make the Effects panel active. 
7 Type crop in the search field to quickly locate the Crop effect. 
8 Select the clip on the Video 3 track in the Timeline, and then double-click the 
Crop effect to apply it. 
9 Press Shift+5 to open the Effect Controls panel.
10 In the Effect Controls panel, click the Crop effect to select it.
Notice that in the Program Monitor you can now see a bounding box around 
the video frame with handles on the top, bottom, left, and right.
11 In the Timeline, scrub the CTI to the end of the Joey_01.mp4 clip when the wall 
behind the screen is most visible in the frame.
12 In the Program Monitor, drag the left handle of the bounding box to the right 
until the wall in the upper-left corner of the frame is no longer visible.
13 In the Effect Controls panel, click in the empty space below the Crop effect to 
deselect it.
Now let’s add a clip to Video 2. Once the green screen in Joey_01.mp4 is 
chroma keyed and thus transparent, you want to have something that shows 
through the transparency.
14 In the Project panel, twirl open the Live bin and find the clip Live_26-Lights.mp4. 
Double-click on the clip to open it in the Source Monitor. Press the spacebar to 
play the clip. This is what will appear behind Joey.
 Note: Double-
clicking to apply an 
effect to a selected clip 
is a new feature in CS6.

140

15 Drag Live_26-Lights.mp4 into the Timeline on track Video 2, directly below 
Joey_01.mp4 so the head of Live_26-Lights.mp4 snaps to the head of Joey_01.mp4.
16 Click the Selection tool and trim the tail of Live_26-Lights.mp4 so it lines up 
with the tail of Joey_01.mp4.
In the Program Monitor, you should see Live_26-Lights.mp4 through the 
cropped area of Joey_01.mp4.
Next, you’ll apply a Chroma Key effect so that the green background of Joey_01.mp4 
is transparent.

using keylight in  
adobe after effects
For doing basic green screen composites that include a simple video background, 
the Ultra Key effect in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 is usually sufficient.
However, for those times when the Chroma Key effects in Adobe Premiere Pro are 
insufficient for the needs of a challenging green screen composite, you can use the 
Keylight keying effect in After Effects CS6. In addition to offering more sophisticated 
control of a clip’s alpha channel, it has its own color-correction and edge-cropping 
controls as well. Also, if you are using After Effects to do chroma keying, you could also 
use the masks, mattes, and layer modes that make After Effects an industry-standard 
compositing application.
applying the ultra key
The Ultra Key is a Chroma Key effect that makes it easy to pull a “clean key” from 
footage shot with a green screen background. You’ll first define the background 
color and then make some minor adjustments that will make Joey appear as if he is 
part of the background on the Video 2 layer in the Timeline.
1 Select Joey_01.mp4 in the Timeline.
2 Press Shift+7 to make the Effects panel active.

142 
lesson 4 
Advanced editing techniques
3 Type ultra in the Search field to quickly locate the Ultra Key effect.
4 Double-click the Ultra Key effect to apply it.
5 Press Shift 5 to bring up the Effect Controls panel. Locate the Ultra Key effect  
(it will be on the bottom of the stack) and click the Eyedropper to activate it.
Look at the shot in the Program Monitor and note that the green screen was not 
lit evenly. The background is lighter on the right side of the frame and gradually 
gets darker toward the left side of the frame. This is a common scenario that 
editors have to deal with. 
The best approach in this situation is to select a shade of green in the frame that 
is approximately median luminance so that a maximum area of the green screen 
background will be made transparent.
6 In the Program Monitor, click on a green value that’s halfway between the 
lightest and darkest areas of green in the frame. In this clip it would be just to 
the left of Joey’s face.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 143
The green background disappears from the frame, and you can see the 
background clip on Video 1 showing through. However, it’s not a “clean key” yet 
because you can still see some darkness in the background to the left where the 
green screen was lit darker. Making some minor adjustments will fix this.
7 In the Effect Controls panel, locate the Ultra Key effect and change the Output 
menu setting from Composite to Alpha Channel.
In the Program Monitor, you can now see the alpha channel, or transparency 
information, of the clip. The black areas are transparent; the white areas are 
opaque.
The goal when you are adjusting the controls in the Ultra Key effect is to make 
the entire background completely black while keeping the subject completely 
white (with the exceptions of the edges of the subject, which should be halfway 
between white and black to avoid a “hard edge” on the subject that can make 
the composite look fake and unconvincing).

144

Advanced editing techniques
8 In the Effect Controls panel, click the disclosure triangle next to Matte 
Generation in the Ultra Key effect to reveal its properties.
9 Click on the value of the Pedestal property and drag it to the right until its value 
is 100. As you drag, notice how the background becomes nearly entirely black 
while the subject remains white.
In this case, adjusting the Pedestal property achieved a threshold for the key, 
which made most of the green pixels transparent. But you’ll still notice an area 
in the upper-left corner of the background that has not turned completely 
black. To finish the job, you need to adjust the Shadow property.
10 Click on the value for Shadow and drag it to the left until its value is 25 or until 
the background area of the frame is completely black. As you drag, notice how 
the remaining white pixels in the background fade to black.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 145
11 Click on the Output menu and change the setting from Alpha Channel back to 
Composite.
Notice that the edge of Joey’s hat in the frame looks a bit too sharp. Because 
Joey’s head is not actually flat, this edge sharpness looks unconvincing and 
could use a bit of softening.
12 Twirl open the settings for Matte Cleanup and adjust the value for Soften to 50.
13 In the Timeline, drag the CTI to the beginning of the sequence, and then press 
the spacebar to play it back.
Joey is now convincingly composited into the background. 

146 
lesson 4 
Advanced editing techniques
Had this clip been shot with an evenly lit green screen, the fine-tuning you just did 
would likely not have been necessary. The reality in the world of film and video 
production is that editors have to work with green screen footage recorded in a 
variety of optimal, and not-so-optimal, situations. The good news is that with the 
Ultra Key effect, it’s usually just a matter of selecting a “middle ground” color when 
you start the process and then making some minor adjustments (like you just did) 
to get the desired result.
adding titles with the  
adobe Premiere Pro title tool
Adobe Premiere Pro gives you the ability to create simple title clips that you can 
add to your edit. These are typically used as onscreen text to identify a location or 
someone who is speaking on camera. Although other applications in Adobe CS6 
Production Premium, such as Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop Extended, 
allow you to create text that you can then import to Adobe Premiere Pro, using the 
native type engine in Adobe Premiere Pro can save you the trouble of switching back 
and forth between applications, and having one more media file to keep track of.
The type engine in Adobe Premiere Pro is quite robust and can employ all kinds of 
different fonts and presets for styles, as well as apply text on a vector path. Titles 
can either be still or animated.
You’ll create a simple static title clip to identify the nightclub that you see in the video.
1 Choose Title > New Title > Default Still. The New Title window appears. Leave 
the current values for Width, Height, Timebase, and Pixel Aspect Ratio as is. In 
the Name field, type Name of Club and click OK.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 147
The Titler will appear with a collection of panels, all of them related to title 
design. A Tools panel contains a Selection tool and a Type tool along with Font 
Family and Font Style fields, Font Size value, type alignment buttons, Spatial 
Transform properties, and Type Color properties.
Also, a miniature monitor allows you to see how your title will look when 
superimposed over the current clip in your Timeline. This monitor shows two 
concentric rectangles that represent the action safe area (the outer rectangle), 
as well as the title safe area (the inner rectangle). In most cases, you don’t want 
to place titles on the edge of a frame. These rectangles provide a general visual 
guide to ensure that the titles you create will reliably show in the final video 
with a sufficient space buffer around them.
2 Click the Type tool in the Tools panel and click once in the Title Monitor. A 
type field appears. Type Boku Room and press Return (Enter) to create a line 
break. Then type San Francisco, CA. Select this second line of type and reduce 
the Font Size value so that Boku Room is more prominent. Click the Selection 
tool to commit your changes to the type.
Let’s apply a few more adjustments to the title.
E Tip: Scrub the CTI 
in your Timeline when 
the Title panel is open 
to show how a title 
will look over different 
shots.

Advanced editing techniques
3 Press Command+A (Ctrl+A) to select all text. Click the Left Align button so the 
type is left aligned. Set the Fill Type to Solid and set the Fill Color to white.
4 As a general rule, when you’re choosing a type font that will appear in a video, 
choose an easily legible sans serif font. Set the Font Family to Helvetica Neue 
and the Font Style to Bold. Click the Selection tool to commit the changes to 
your type.
5 With the Selection tool, click once in the type box and drag it to the bottom left 
of the title safe area.
6 Close the Titler panels.
7 In the Project panel you should see the Name of Club title clip. Drag this into 
your Timeline on Video 3 so its head aligns with the In point of Live_02.mp4. 
With the Selection tool, click on the tail of the title clip and trim it so it aligns 
with the tail of Live_02.mp4.
 Note: If a bin is 
selected in your Project 
panel when you create 
a title clip, the title 
clip will appear inside 
the selected bin. The 
title clip can then be 
dragged elsewhere in 
the Project panel.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 149
8 Adjust the CTI to the beginning of the sequence, and press the spacebar to play. 
You should see the static title clip composited with the video clip below it in 
Video 2.
serif fonts vs. sans serif fonts
A serif is a typographic detail on the ends of some of the strokes that make up letters 
and numbers. A serif leads the eye to the next letter, but they are only visible at high 
resolutions, such as in print. When displayed with limited pixels, serif fonts can create 
visual artifacts in video frames and thus affect legibility.
Sans serif fonts can sometimes look more modern and were developed specifically 
to be used in electronic media. They feature even spacing between letters and even 
thickness of the font elements, resulting in legible type onscreen.

stabilizing footage with the Warp stabilizer
Now let’s look at a technique that will improve the look of your footage instantly. 
While this may not seem like an “advanced” technique, it’s in this section because 
performing this level of clean up makes your project look even more professional. 
A common issue that occurs with footage recorded on handheld cameras is that it 
can be shaky and uneven, making it difficult to watch. The Warp Stabilizer, intro-
duced in Adobe After Effects CS5.5 and now available in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6, 
is an incredibly advanced stabilization tool that can make this type of footage look 
as if it was recorded with a sophisticated camera rig. 
What makes the Warp Stabilizer easy to use is its automatic analysis of the footage, 
which allows for minimal customization. The advanced image analysis, which takes 
place “behind the scenes” in Premiere Pro, does all the heavy lifting for you.
Sometimes, editors will encounter a video clip that is well composed but unsteady 
and not favorable because the videographer did not hold the camera steady or an 
isolated bump to the tripod occurred. In such situations, the video clip may still be 
salvageable by removing the camera shake with the new Warp Stabilizer effect in 
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.
The Warp Stabilizer works by analyzing a shaky video clip and automatically apply-
ing motion to the clip to counteract the unstable motion in the raw clip.
Let’s apply the Warp Stabilizer to a clip in the sequence.
1 Find and select the clip Studio_03.mp4 in Video 3. This is a short clip of Joey 
sitting at his recording studio workstation as he makes adjustments to an audio 
recording. Notice that about halfway through the clip is a considerable amount 
of camera shake, which would ordinarily make this shot unusable. 
2 Press Shift+7 to make the Effects panel active. 
3 Type warp in the Search field to quickly locate the Warp Stabilizer effect. 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 151
4 Double-click the Warp Stabilizer effect to apply it to the selected clip.
The Warp Stabilizer effect immediately starts analyzing the clip, and a blue bar  
across the image in the Program Monitor indicates that the clip is being analyzed. 
5 Press Shift+5 to open the Effect Controls panel. 
Progress analyzing the clip, in number of frames and percentage, is displayed in 
the Effect Controls panel. When the analysis process is complete, an orange bar 
appears across the image, indicating that it is being stabilized.

152 
lesson 4 
Advanced editing techniques
6 When the stabilization process is complete, play the clip. 
Notice how the camera shake is completely gone, and the pan from right to left 
at the end of the shot is smooth and fluid, as if the camera had been mounted 
on a tripod with a high-quality head. However, it must be mentioned that the 
Warp Stabilizer zooms into the clip slightly, which can risk making it appear 
soft. Scaling of up to 110% is usually acceptable.
In many cases (such as this one), you don’t have to change any of the default set-
tings in the Warp Stabilizer effect to get a good result. If necessary, the effect has 
multiple advanced settings to adjust clips with varying levels of shake.
rolling shutter repair effect
In digital video cameras with CMOS sensors, video is recorded one scan line at a 
time; therefore, not all video in a given frame is recorded at the same time. This can 
cause a distortion called rolling shutter if the camera is moving quickly while record-
ing or if the recorded subject is moving quickly.
New in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 is the Rolling Shutter Repair effect, which fixes this 
distortion.
rendering your timeline
If you are using Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 on a machine with a GPU that does not 
support the Mercury Playback Engine, your playback may not be smooth and 
uninterrupted. Premiere Pro can create preview renders, which are cached video 
files on your hard drive that allow you to play back your edit in real time if playback 
is not smooth.
During playback, you may see red and yellow bars at the top of your Timeline with 
a gray bar above them. What do they mean?
The gray bar is called the Work Area bar. It defines the range of time in your 
Timeline for which Premiere Pro will create a preview.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 153
The yellow bar(s) indicate source files that are computationally difficult. For exam-
ple, footage from a DSLR camera may yield a yellow bar in your Timeline. These 
frames will sometimes play back in real time, but not always. That depends on the 
speed of your computer.
The red bar(s) indicate clips that have effects applied to them or unrendered clips 
from Adobe After Effects. These frames will most likely not play back in real time, 
and need to be rendered.
Let’s generate a preview render of your Timeline.
1 Select your Timeline. Press the backslash key (\) to view your entire sequence.
2 Double-click on the Work Area bar so it includes your entire edit.
3 Choose Sequence > Render Entire Work Area.
You’ll see a Rendering window with a progress bar indicating how much render 
time remains.
When the progress bar finishes, the yellow and red bars at the top of your 
Timeline will be green, indicating frames that have been preview rendered.
4 Press Home and then press the spacebar to play your edit.
5 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.

open workflows with other  
applications, such as Final Cut 
and media Composer 
As you work in Adobe Premiere Pro, you can collaborate more efficiently with col-
leagues by importing and exporting Apple Final Cut Pro and Avid projects.
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 allows you to import and export a Final Cut Pro XML 
project file but with certain limitations. For example, audio keyframes, blur effects, 
color wipes, and cross dissolves all transfer intact from Final Cut Pro 7 to Adobe 
Premiere Pro via XML 5.0, but the Three-Way Color Corrector doesn’t transfer cor-
rectly because Final Cut Pro processes color correction in RGB, whereas the Premiere 
Pro Three Way Color Corrector processes it in YUV. Additionally, Final Cut Pro text 
transfers to Adobe Premiere Pro’s title tool but loses the formatting. Also, crops in 
the Final Cut Pro Motion Tab lose their feathering, because the crop filter in Premiere 
Pro doesn’t have soft edges.
It’s also possible to import and export an Advanced Authoring Format (AAF) mul-
timedia file between Adobe Premiere Pro and Avid nonlinear editing systems that 
support AAF files. Exchanging projects to and from Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 and 
other non-Adobe systems offers the advantage of using the Adobe Suite of applica-
tions on projects that did not originate in Premiere Pro.
Exchanging project files between Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro or Avid soft-
ware often requires additional but minor project organization and media manage-
ment due to the native incompatibility of these systems.

lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
Preserving your rough edit 
in adobe Premiere Pro
If you are continuing from the previous lesson, feel free to continue with the Adobe 
Premiere Pro project you already have open. If you are starting at this lesson, navi-
gate to the Lesson 05 folder on your hard drive and open the Adobe Premiere Pro 
project Lesson_05 Start.prproj. Save your Adobe Premiere Pro project file in the 
Lesson 05 folder as Afrolicious Promo.prproj.
Because you are continuing with a previous version of this edit, you’ll first save a 
new version of your sequence. This allows you to go back to the previous version if 
need be and is a recommended best practice in the video editing workflow.
1 In the Project panel, twirl open the Sequences bin.
2 Click on the Afrolicious Promo Edit 02 sequence to select it. Choose Edit > 
Copy to copy it to your clipboard. Then choose Edit > Paste.
This will make a duplicate of this sequence outside of the Sequences folder.
3 To modify the name of the sequence, click on the name of the sequence to  
select it.
4 Change the name of the sequence to Afrolicious Promo Edit 03, press Return 
(Enter), and then drag it into the Sequences folder.
5 Double-click the Afrolicious Promo Edit 03 sequence to load it in your Timeline.
Note that the sequence appears in a new tabbed Timeline panel in front of your 
original sequence.
Having multiple Timeline panels open simultaneously can be useful in certain 
situations, but it can also be confusing. For the time being, you’ll close the first  
Timeline to eliminate the possibility of accidentally modifying the wrong sequence.
6 In the Timeline panel, click the Afrolicious Promo Edit 02 tab to select it.
E Tip: Press 
Command+C  
(Ctrl+C) to copy.  
Press Command+V 
(Ctrl+V) to paste. 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 159
7 Press Command+W (Ctrl+W) to close this sequence.
The new sequence is now the only one visible in the Timeline, which will ensure 
that you are working on the most recent iteration.
8 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your Adobe Premiere Pro project.
about adobe after effects
After Effects is the “Swiss army knife” of motion graphics and effects tools. It has 
a wide range of uses, from creating simple animated text to creating elaborate title 
sequences for motion pictures. After Effects is the industry-standard tool for creat-
ing motion graphics and compositing visual effects.
the “link” between  
motion graphic artists and video editors
Note that as a video editor, it is possible to launch Adobe After Effects directly from 
your Adobe Premiere Pro Timeline by replacing a clip in your sequence with an After 
Effects composition. As a motion graphic artist, you generally spend more time 
working in After Effects than in an Adobe Premiere Pro project, and as a result, you 
would likely begin many projects in After Effects and not Adobe Premiere Pro. For 
those users who are more familiar with Adobe After Effects but not as familiar with 
Adobe Premiere Pro, the Dynamic Link workflow between these two applications 
has allowed motion graphic artists to become better editors and editors to become 
better motion graphic artists.
In this lesson, you’ll learn some of the basic skills you’ll need to create basic graph-
ics and effects for your video production projects. This lesson only scratches the 
surface of the capabilities of After Effects. If motion graphics and/or visual effects 
are a significant part of your workflow, we strongly recommend obtaining Adobe 
After Effects CS6 Classroom in a Book (Adobe Press, 2012) and Adobe After Effects 
CS6 Visual Effects and Compositing, by Mark Christiansen (Adobe Press, 2013).
Creating a new project in adobe after effects Cs6
Let’s get started in Adobe After Effects!
1 Launch After Effects CS6 and click File > Save As > Save As.
2 Navigate to the Lesson 05 folder (Adobe CS6 Project Assets > Lessons >  
Lesson 05), type in the project name Afrolicious_Promo_01, and click Save.

lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
the concepts of compositing 
and animation
When you’re working in After Effects, you’ll be spending most of your time assem-
bling visual elements into a composition and animating them. Put simply, the crafts 
of compositing and animation can be defined as follows:
•
Compositing is the merging of multiple images from different sources. For 
example, your After Effects composition may include video clips, photographs, 
vector graphics, and text, each with their own unique settings. Sometimes it’s 
necessary to composite layers in a composition so there is a seamless blend 
between them to create the illusion that multiple layers are a single visible 
element.
•
animation is the rapid display of images to create the illusion of motion. Adobe 
After Effects allows you to animate the motion of not just visible layers but also 
the properties of the layers. For example, you could have a text object moving 
across the frame while a blur effect animates on the text object simultaneously. 
optimizing performance
After Effects is extremely flexible in the ways it can render and display your com-
positions. The more powerful your hardware, the better After Effects will perform. 
You can do all the basic tasks in After Effects on modest hardware, but the process-
ing required for more advanced tasks generally means you’ll have a better experi-
ence by using more powerful hardware.
One important fact about After Effects is that it does not play back your composi-
tions instantly, in real time, like Adobe Premiere Pro can. It needs to render the 
frames first before playing them back.
After Effects CS6 has made significant strides in making the best use of the hard-
ware you have to render and cache frames in the background while you work.
The main components of your hardware that will affect performance in After 
Effects are:
• RAM. After Effects loves RAM, and you simply cannot have enough. The 
performance of the software, in general, as well as the number of frames you 
can cache in RAM for previews and playback greatly depends on having a good 
amount of RAM in your system.
• Open GL. After Effects takes advantage of the Open GL graphics language to 
offload certain rendering tasks to the GPU.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 161
• Graphics card. A graphics card with a powerful, Adobe-approved GPU can 
handle multiple rendering tasks in After Effects, freeing up your CPU to handle 
other tasks, which results in better performance.
• Hard drive. A fast hard drive is especially important if you work with high-
resolution, high-bitrate, video formats. The faster your drives can read and write 
data, the faster your system can render and display frames. Although After 
Effects can run on a laptop with a single hard drive, for optimum performance, 
it is recommended that you run After Effects CS6 on a workstation with a 
separate hard drive for your system drive (with your operating system and 
applications), another hard drive or a RAID for your media and renders, and a 
third hard drive for your cache. Ideally, the cache drive would be a solid state 
drive to achieve the fastest render that would utilize the Global Performance 
Cache (see the next section, “Global Performance Cache”). Any standard hard 
disk drive (HDD) in your configuration should operate at 7200 rpm or faster.
solid-state drives (ssDs)
Thanks to advances in solid-state memory technologies, it is now possible to obtain 
a computer or external storage device with a solid-state drive. These have their 
advantages and disadvantages when compared to standard hard disk drives (HDDs) 
of similar storage capacity.
Pros of SSDs:
• 
Faster performance
• 
Lighter weight
• 
Smaller form factor
• 
Silent operation
Cons of SSDs:
• 
More expensive
• 
Smaller capacity
Global Performance Cache
New in After Effects CS6 is the Global Performance Cache. This feature greatly 
speeds up your workflow by taking full advantage of your computer’s 64-bit CPU 
cores, RAM, and hard drive(s). For instance, if you have made a preview render of 
an animation in After Effects and you then make a change to that animation, you 
can revert to the previous state of the animation without having to make another 
preview render of it. Also, the Global Performance Cache will save RAM pre-
views of your After Effects compositions so you can access them the next time you

reopen your project. The Global Performance Cache makes your workflow more 
efficient and allows you more time to be creative.
In order to make the most of the Global Performance Cache, your system needs a 
supported GPU installed. You can find a list of supported graphics cards at www.
adobe.com/products/premiere/tech-specs.html.
setting preferences for Global Performance Cache
If you have a supported graphics processor, you should optimize some of your 
After Effects preferences.
1 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Media & Disk Cache (Edit > Preferences > 
Media & Disk Cache) to view and set your Media & Disk Cache preferences.
2 Select Enable Disk Cache, and click the Choose Folder button. Navigate to a 
folder on your system that is on a fast hard drive, preferably an SSD that is 
separate from your system and your media.
3 Set the Maximum Disk Cache size to as high as your cache drive will allow.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 163
4 Select the Memory and Multiprocessing preferences.
5 Based on your Installed RAM, allocate at least 2 GB for each CPU core on  
your system.
6 Select Render Multiple Frames Simultaneously. With this feature activated, 
After Effects will devote the allotted amount of RAM, divided among each CPU 
core, to dramatically speed up your render times.
7 The Installed CPUs (processor cores) accounts for actual CPU cores as well as 
virtual CPUs that are available due to hyper-threading. Without getting too 
technical, you ideally want After Effects to render your frames with actual CPUs, 
so set “CPUs reserved for other applications” to the number of actual CPUs on 
your system.
8 Click OK.

understanding the after 
effects user interface
When you launch After Effects for the first time, you’ll be presented with the 
default Standard workspace. This workspace is a combination of the most com-
monly used panels.
To reset the Standard workspace to its default settings, follow these steps.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Standard.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset “Standard.”
3 In the dialog that appears, click Yes.

164 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
On the surface of the Standard workspace, seven panels are visible: 
• The Project panel is where you store and organize all of your assets, such as 
footage and compositions.
• The Composition panel is where you view your graphics and make spatial 
manipulations to layers. 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 165
• The Timeline is where you adjust your layer order, layer properties, and time-
based animations.
• The Tools panel is where you select different tools used in the animation process.
• The Info panel is where you view data about 
action, such as spatial coordinates, color values, 
and numerical changes in layer properties.
• The Preview panel is where you manipulate 
playback and preview settings for the active 
composition.
• The Effects & Presets panel is where you access 
and apply effects and presets to the selected 
layer or layers.
Notwithstanding the obvious differences, you may notice some similarities between 
the user interfaces of Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects. For instance, 
both applications have a Project panel, a Timeline, and a Tools panel, all of which 
serve the same basic respective functions. The Composition panel in After Effects 
works much like the Program Monitor in Adobe Premiere Pro.

166 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
using Dynamic Link: from adobe 
Premiere Pro to after effects 
Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects are designed to work seamlessly together 
so that you can bring an element from one to the other without having to do a 
full render beforehand. For instance, you can bring a clip from Adobe Premiere 
Pro into After Effects and apply changes to it, and those changes will dynamically 
update in Adobe Premiere Pro.
For more information about Dynamic Link, refer to Lesson 1.
In this exercise, you’ll bring a video clip from your Timeline in Adobe Premiere Pro 
CS6 into Adobe After Effects CS6 and then apply an effect to it.
1 Switch back to Adobe Premiere Pro by pressing Command+Tab (Alt+Tab).
2 In your Adobe Premiere Pro Timeline, select the clip Live_18.mp4—the clip 
that shows a point of view from on stage with a bright light shining toward the 
camera.
3 Right-click on the clip and choose Replace With After Effects Composition.
In your After Effects project that is already open, a new composition will 
appear in the Project panel along with the clip Live_18.mp4.
If you switch back to Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll see that the clip in your 
Timeline has been replaced by a linked After Effects comp.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 167
Back in After Effects, look in the new comp that has been created. This video 
clip shows a stage light shining into the camera.
If a light is shining into a camera lens, the light will refract through the layers 
of glass in the lens, producing an artifact called a lens flare. Although this type 
of visual artifact should generally be avoided while shooting video, sometimes 
adding a visual effect that simulates a lens flare can add an element of subtle 
(or not-so-subtle) interest for the viewer.
Let’s create a lens flare to make the shot look “shinier.” To do this, you’ll use 
the Lens Flare effect. Because this composition is Dynamically Linked in your 
Adobe Premiere Pro project, the Lens Flare effect you apply to it in After Effects 
will automatically show in the corresponding clip in your Adobe Premiere Pro 
sequence.
4 Select the Live_18.mp4 layer in your After Effects comp, and then choose  
Effect > Generate > Lens Flare. The lens flare will appear on the video layer.

168 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
third-party lens flare effect plug-ins
If you want to create lens flares in your After Effects compositions and have a wider 
array of effect controls for lens type, flare color and brightness, additional lens 
artifacts, plus a variety of bundled lens flare presets that the native Lens Flare effects 
do not provide, you may want to look into some of the third-party lens flare effect 
plug-ins available for Adobe After Effects:
•
Knoll Light Factory from Red Giant Software (www.redgiantsoftware.com/
products/all/knoll-light-factory)
•
Optical Flares from Video Copilot (www.videocopilot.net/products/opticalflares)
You should see the Effect Controls panel, which shows the properties for the 
Lens Flare effect.
The Lens Flare effect has its own spatial coordinate for Flare Center. Notice  
that if the name of the effect is selected in the Effect Controls panel, the Flare 
Center shows as a crosshair in the Composition panel.
You can click on this crosshair and drag it to a new location in the  
Composition frame.
5 Press the Home key to make sure that your current time indicator (CTI) is at the 
first frame of your composition.
6 Click on the Flare Center crosshair and drag it to the center of the bright yellow 
light that shows in Live_18.mp4.
Now you’ll animate the Flare Center. If you’ve never done any kind of animation 
before, don’t panic. This will be simple. Keyframe animation will be covered in 
more detail later in this lesson.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 169
7 Click the stopwatch icon for Flare Center in your Effect Controls panel. The 
stopwatch icon will change.
8 Scrub your CTI through the Timeline as you look at the Composition panel. 
Notice that there is some slight camera movement in the raw clip. The camera 
moves to the right, but at 0:00:01:21 the camera stops moving.
9 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:01:21 in your Timeline.
10 Select the Lens Flare effect in the Effect Controls panel. In your Composition 
panel, click and drag the Flare Center crosshair so it’s on the bright yellow light, 
accounting for the slight camera move.
11 Scrub your CTI forward and notice that toward the end of the composition is 
a quick but slight camera move. The Flare Center should move to follow the 
yellow light in the shot to maintain the illusion that it was originally in the shot.
12 With the Lens Flare effect still selected in the Effect Controls panel, press the U 
key. This keyboard shortcut tells After Effects to show all animated properties 
on the selected layer (or layers).
You should see the Lens Flare effect along with its Flare Center property listed 
in the Timeline.
The small diamond icons are the keyframes for the Flare Center property. For 
now, just understand that they hold the values for the Flare Center at certain 
frames in the layer’s duration.
E Tip: To navigate 
in your After Effects 
Timeline by single 
frames, click the Next 
Frame or Previous 
Frame button in the 
Preview panel. You can 
also press Page Down 
to move your CTI to the 
next frame, and press 
Page Up to move to the 
previous frame.

170 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
13 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:03:17. Practice using the Page Up and Page Down keys 
to move your CTI backward and forward one frame.
14 To the left of the Flare Center property name in the Timeline, click once on the 
empty diamond to add a new keyframe at the current time.
You should see another keyframe icon appear at the current frame.
15 Now press the End key to adjust your CTI to the last frame of the composition.
16 Select the Lens Flare effect in the Effect Controls panel. In your Composition 
panel, click and drag the Flare Center crosshair so it’s on the bright yellow light, 
accounting for the final slight but sudden camera move.
17 Scrub backward and forward through your timeline to see the Flare Center 
animate.
using ram Preview
Whenever you create anything in After Effects, you should preview your work to 
make sure it looks the way you intended. In most cases, what you apply in After 
Effects will not instantly play back in real time unless you render it first. After 
Effects allows you to render your composition frames and store them in your com-
puter’s RAM so you can preview the composition—hence, the term RAM Preview.
Let’s do a RAM Preview of your composition so that we can preview the Lens Flare 
effect on the video clip you brought over from Adobe Premiere Pro. There are a 
couple of ways of activating a RAM Preview in After Effects: You can either press the  
0 key on your numeric keypad, or (if you are using a laptop that doesn’t have a 
numeric keypad) you can go to the Preview panel and click the RAM Preview button.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 171
1 Activate a RAM Preview using one of the aforementioned methods.
You’ll see a green line creep along the right at the top of your Timeline, which 
indicates frames that are stored in RAM that can be played back in real time. 
After Effects will then play back these frames.
2 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your After Effects project so the changes 
you applied here will dynamically update in your Adobe Premiere Pro Timeline.
3 Switch back to Adobe Premiere Pro to verify that the Lens Flare effect you 
applied in After Effects appears on the corresponding clip in your Premiere Pro 
Timeline.
4 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your Adobe Premiere Pro project.
reducing resolution  
for ram Previews
In some cases, After Effects will not make a RAM Preview  
of all of the frames in your composition. This is not a bug.  
There are a couple factors to consider when doing a RAM  
Preview. First, because After Effects stores frames in your  
computer’s RAM, you need to determine how much RAM  
your computer has. Second, you need to determine how  
much of this RAM is being allocated to other applications  
currently open.
Although this composition is fairly short, you may end up  
working with compositions that are longer, and no reasonable amount of RAM on 
your computer will be enough to preview all of the frames. In such a scenario, you 
might consider reducing your composition’s resolution from Full to Half (or even 
Third or Quarter) so that, at the expense of RAM Preview image quality, After Effects 
can render more frames with greater speed.

172 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
Working with text and animation 
presets in after effects
The title that you created in Adobe Premiere Pro back in Lesson 4 may look fine as 
a placeholder, but let’s create some animated text to replace it. You’ll create this text 
in After Effects, animate it using an animation preset, and then Dynamically Link 
this text from After Effects to Adobe Premiere Pro.
In your Adobe Premiere Pro project, there should already be a static title graphic 
that shows the name of the nightclub where Afrolicious was performing.
This static text is what you’ll be replacing with animated text in After Effects.
1 Switch to After Effects and create a new composition by choosing Composition >  
New Composition.
2 In the Composition Settings dialog, type in the Composition Name Text_Name_ 
Of_Club. With Lock Aspect Ratio unchecked, set the width to 1280 and the 
height to 720. Set the frame rate to 23.976 fps. Set the Duration to 0:00:05:00. 
Set Pixel Aspect Ratio to Square Pixels.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 173
3 Set the background color to black by clicking on the Background Color swatch. 
Choose black in the color picker. Click OK to close the color picker, and then 
click OK again to close the Composition Settings dialog.
Adobe applications let you copy and paste text between them with the fonts and 
formatting intact. Therefore, you can simply copy the text of the static title in 
Adobe Premiere Pro and paste it into After Effects.
4 Switch back to Adobe Premiere Pro.
5 In your Timeline, double-click on the Name of Club text object.
The Titler window opens showing this text.
6 Double-click in the text field and press Command+A (Ctrl+A) to select all  
the text.
7 Choose Edit > Copy. Close the Titler window, and then switch back to  
After Effects.
8 In the Text_Name_Of_Club composition, you need to create a text layer. Do so 
by choosing Layer > New > Text. Then choose Edit > Paste.
The text you had in Adobe Premiere Pro should now be in your text layer in 
your After Effects composition with the font and formatting intact.
E Tip: To make a 
new text layer in 
After Effects, press 
Command+Opt+Shift+T 
(Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T).

174 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
9 Click on a blank area in your Timeline to register your change, or press Enter on 
your numeric keypad.
Note that when you create a text layer, the Character panel and Paragraph panel 
appear in the interface. You can change the font and formatting of the text in 
After Effects by adjusting the settings in these panels.
You should see a text layer in your composition called Boku Room San 
Francisco, CA. Conveniently, After Effects automatically names text layers 
based on the content of the layer.
 Note: When editing 
a text layer in After 
Effects, the Return key 
makes a line break, 
whereas the Enter key 
registers your changes.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 175
10 In the row of icons and menus at the bottom of the Composition panel, make 
sure that the Toggle Transparency Grid is deactivated, so that you can see your 
text against a black background.
11 Activate the Title/Action Safe guides by clicking the Choose grid and guide 
options icon and then choosing Title/Action Safe.
12 Select the text layer and press the P key to show the layer’s position. Press the 
V key to activate the Selection tool. In the Composition panel, click on the text 
once to select it, and then move it so that its bottom-left corner is aligned with 
the bottom-left corner of the title safe area (the inner rectangle).
Now it’s time to animate the text. After Effects comes equipped with a very 
powerful text-animation engine. The complexities of this text-animation 
engine can be somewhat daunting. Fortunately, After Effects also comes with 
animation presets, many of which are designed specifically for text layers and 
enable you to easily apply complex animation.
13 Press the Home key to make sure that your CTI is at the beginning of  
your Timeline.
E Tip: Toggle the 
Title/Action Safe 
guides by pressing the 
apostrophe (’) key.

14 In the Effects & Presets panel, type Fade Up Characters in the search field.  
You should see an animation preset with this name listed below.
15 Select the Fade Up Characters preset, and drag and drop this preset directly 
onto the text layer, either in the Composition panel or the Timeline. Select the 
text layer in the Timeline to register this change. 
16 Do a RAM Preview. You should see each character of your text fade in one at  
a time over a span of two seconds.
Now adjust this animation so that it happens over one second instead of  
two seconds.
17 Select your text layer and press the U key to show all animated properties and 
their keyframes in the Timeline.
18 With your Selection tool, draw a marquee around the last of the two Range 
Selector 1 Start keyframes on your text layer, and adjust your CTI to 0:00:01:00.
E Tip: To adjust your CTI to a specific timecode in an After Effects composition, click once on the 
timecode at the top left of the Timeline panel, type the timecode, and then press Return (Enter).
19 Hold down the Shift key and drag the selected keyframe to the left until it snaps 
to the CTI.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 177
20 Do another RAM Preview and notice that the text animation now happens over 
one second.

using Dynamic Link: from after 
effects to adobe Premiere Pro
Just as you can Dynamically Link elements from Adobe Premiere Pro to After 
Effects, you can also link elements from After Effects to Adobe Premiere Pro.
In this exercise, you’ll import your currently open After Effects composition into 
your Adobe Premiere Pro project and replace the static text clip in your Timeline 
with the animated text composition that you made in After Effects.
1 Switch back to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2 Choose File > Import, navigate to the Lesson 05 folder (Adobe CS6 Project 
Assets > Lessons > Lesson 05), select Afrolicious_Promo_01.aep, and  
click Import.
An Import After Effects Composition panel appears.
3 Select the Text_Name_Of_Club composition and click OK. The composition 
will appear in your Adobe Premiere Pro Project panel.
Let’s replace the original Adobe Premiere Pro text object with this imported 
After Effects composition with animated text.
4 In your Adobe Premiere Pro Timeline, select the Name of Club clip.
5 Select the imported Text_Name_Of_Club After Effects comp in your  
Project panel.
6 Hold down the Option (Alt) key, and drag and drop the comp directly onto  
the Name of Club clip in your Timeline. This will replace the original clip with 
the new animated text clip.

Creating a motion graphic 
with adobe after effects
A motion graphic is, simply, an animated graphic design. It can incorporate 
abstract graphics, photographs, vector logos, video clips, and text, all of which can 
be animated separately to convey an overall message.
Motion graphics are used for a variety of purposes, most commonly for titles in 
motion pictures and television programs; animated graphics in advertisements  
and corporate presentations; photographic slide shows; and user interfaces for 
mobile applications.
Adobe After Effects has been available since the 1990s and has established itself as 
the industry-standard application for creating motion graphics, largely due to its 
tight integration with Adobe Photoshop Extended and Adobe Illustrator.
In this lesson, you’ll create a motion graphic that will go at the end of the 
Afrolicious promo that you are editing in Adobe Premiere Pro. Because the motion 
graphic will appear at the end, we’ll refer to it as an outro (as opposed to an intro, 
which would go at the beginning). The motion graphic will show the components 
of the Afrolicious CD cover animate into place.
The first step is to import some footage items to After Effects that you’ll be using in 
the outro.
Importing media files
After Effects enables you to import and work with many different file types and 
formats of still images, video clips, audio clips, and vector graphics.
1 Choose File > Import > File and navigate to the Graphics folder (Adobe CS6 
Project Assets > Graphics).
2 Select afrolicious_logo.png. Hold down the Command (Ctrl) key, select

4 Select Live_23-60.mp4. Hold down the Command (Ctrl) key, select  
Live_25-60.mp4, and click Open.
You should now see all of these imported items listed in your Project panel, includ-
ing items that have already been imported, namely Live_18.mp4.
Importing layered Photoshop files into after effects
One of the convenient aspects of using Photoshop images in After Effects is that 
After Effects can recognize and maintain the layers built into a Photoshop image. 
After Effects will let you import any individual layer of a Photoshop image. It will 
also let you import a layered Photoshop image as a composition, which can greatly 
speed up your workflow.
1
Choose File > Import > File and navigate to the Graphics folder.
2
Select Afrolicious_cover.psd.
3
Set Import As to Composition-Retain Layer Sizes and click Open.
A window appears prompting you to choose whether you want to maintain 
editable layer styles or merge layer styles into footage. Because no layer styles 
were used in any of the original Photoshop layers in this image, this doesn’t 
apply. However, if there were layer styles, such as Drop Shadow or Gradient 
Overlay, in your imported Photoshop document, then you would need to direct 
After Effects on how to interpret Photoshop layer styles on import.

180 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
4 Select Editable Layer Styles, and click OK.
Notice that After Effects has automatically created a new composition 
named Afrolicious_cover, as well as a folder in the Project panel called 
Afrolicious_cover Layers.
5 Twirl open the Afrolicious_cover Layers  
folder, and you’ll see a list of the original 
Photoshop layers.
6 To verify that After Effects has indeed 
imported the PSD file with all layers intact, 
select any of the layers—bottom_brush_fill,  
for example—and then choose Edit >  
Edit Original.
Photoshop Extended CS6 opens the 
Afrolicious_cover image. Here, you can see all 
of the original Photoshop layers. Notice how 
all of the layer names in Photoshop Extended 
are the same as the imported Photoshop items 
in After Effects. Keep this image open in 
Photoshop Extended for later reference.
7 Switch back to After Effects, and in the Project 
panel, double-click on the composition 
Afrolicious_cover to open it.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 181
You should see all of the same layers with the same layer names and the same 
stacking order as in the original Photoshop image.
organizing the Project panel
So far you’ve imported multiple graphics and footage items, as well as created a 
couple of compositions in your After Effects project. It’s a good idea to organize 
your project items as you work so you can easily find what you’re looking for later.
You can create folders within the After Effects Project panel that you can place your 
footage items into.
1 At the bottom of the Project panel, click the Create a New Folder button. A new 
untitled folder will appear in the Project panel.
2 Replace the default Untitled 1 name with Footage and press Return (Enter).

182 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
3 Select the footage files Live_18.mp4, Live_23-60.mp4, and Live_25-60.mp4, and 
drag these items onto the Footage folder.
You’ll create another folder in the Project panel, but you’ll do it a bit differently.
4 Select afrolicious_logo.png, and then hold down the Command (Ctrl) key and 
select crowd01.png so both files are selected.
5 Drag these items directly onto the Create a New Folder button.
A new untitled folder will automatically be created and contain these two files.
6 Change the default Untitled 1 folder name to Graphics and press Return (Enter).
After Effects allows you to organize your footage items further by letting you 
place folders within other folders.
7 Select the Afrolicious_cover Layers folder and drag and drop this folder onto 
the Graphics folder.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 183
8 Twirl open the Graphics folder, and you should see the Afrolicious_cover Layers 
folder as well as afrolicious_logo.png and crowd01.png within it.
It’s also a good idea to create a folder for your compositions.
9 Select the Afrolicious_cover composition item. Hold down the Command (Ctrl) 
key and select Afrolicious Promo Linked Comp 01 and Text_Name_Of_Club 
compositions.
10 Drag and drop these compositions onto the Create a New Folder button.
11 Change the default Untitled 1 folder name to Comps.
12 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
Creating a new composition
A composition in Adobe After Effects is analogous to a sequence in Adobe Premiere 
Pro in that it’s your main work interface where you would add layers (still images, 
video clips, vector graphics, text, etc.) and then manipulate the timing and proper-
ties of those layers to create an animation.

184 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
In case you hadn’t noticed, After Effects allows you to create multiple compositions 
within the same project.
Let’s create a composition that you’ll use later. This new composition will serve as 
the final composition for the animation you’ll be creating with the Afrolicious_cover 
composition later in this lesson.
1 Choose Composition > New Composition.
A Composition Settings dialog appears.
2 Change the Composition Name to Afrolicious_Outro.
3 Change the Width setting to 1280 and the Height setting to 720. You may  
need to deselect the Lock Aspect Ratio check box to enter the specific settings 
you want.
4 Set Pixel Aspect Ratio to Square Pixels.
5 Set Frame Rate to 23.976. You can choose this standard frame rate from the 
“frames per second” drop-down menu.
6 Set Start Timecode to 0:00:00:00 (assuming it isn’t already), and set Duration  
to 0:00:05:00.
7 Click OK. The new composition will open.
Because there are currently no layers in it, all you’ll see is a blank  
Composition panel.
In the Project panel, you’ll see an Afrolicious_Outro composition item. If your 
Comps folder was still selected, this new comp will automatically be placed 
E Tip: Remember to 
keep your Project panel 
organized as you work. 
Making a habit of this 
early on will save you 
time and headaches in 
the long run.

inside it. Otherwise, select this comp, and drag and drop it onto the  
Comps folder.
8 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
adding video clips to a composition
Now you’ll add some video clips to the Afrolicious_Outro composition. These 
imported media items will be layers that will show in the background of the final 
outro graphic. These video clips will supplement the look of the final animation 
with moving video.
1 In the Project panel, in the Graphics folder, select crowd01.png, and drag it into 
the Timeline of Afrolicious_Outro.
2 In your Footage folder, select the item Live_25-60.mp4, and drag it into the 
Timeline of Afrolicious_Outro, directly above crowd01.png.
3 In your Footage folder, select the item Live_23-60.mp4, and drag it into the 
Timeline of Afrolicious_Outro, directly above Live_25-60.mp4.
adding a still image to a composition
You’ll return to the Afrolicious_Outro composition shortly. Now add a graphic to 
the Afrolicious_cover composition. This graphic is the Afrolicious logo that will 
show prominently in the outro.

186 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
1 The Afrolicious_cover composition should still be open. If it isn’t, go into your 
Comps folder and double-click it to open it.
You should see this composition in the Composition panel as well as all of its 
layers in the Timeline panel below.
2 Make sure your CTI is at the beginning of the Timeline. If it is not, press the 
Home key.
3 In your Project panel, in the Graphics folder, select afrolicious_logo.png.
4 Drag and drop this file into the Timeline of the open Afrolicious_cover 
composition so that it appears in the layer stack directly below the layer 
called Levels Adjustment. You should also see this graphic in the center of 
the Composition panel.
5 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 187
Working with layers
Layers can be still images, video, vector graphics, and text. A layer can be an 
imported graphic created in another program, such as Adobe Photoshop Extended 
or Adobe Illustrator, or created natively in Adobe After Effects. Most layers contain 
visual content. However, in some cases, as with Adjustment Layers or Null Objects, 
they can be used to affect other layers.
As in Photoshop or Illustrator, layers in an After Effects composition can be stacked 
on top of one another. The top-to-bottom stacking order of layers in a composi-
tion generally corresponds to its front-to-back visibility. In other words, if a layer is 
stacked above another, it will generally appear in front of the other. If you want to 
change the front-to-back visibility of layers in your composition, you can adjust the 
stacking order of layers by dragging them up or down in the layer order.
Layers in After Effects not only have spatial visibility to consider, but also tempo-
ral visibility, or duration. Each layer has its own duration within the time of the 
composition that they’re in. All layers in a composition don’t need to have the same 
duration within the composition’s duration.
You’ll animate several of the layers in the Afrolicious_cover composition so that 
they move into frame and/or appear separately to give the animation a bit of vari-
ety. If all of the layers appeared at the same time, that would not be very interesting 
to the viewer.
Before you animate the layers, you’ll adjust their starting times—or In points—in 
the Timeline.
1 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:02:20, and then select the layer afrolicious_logo.png.
2 Hold down the Shift key and drag the afrolicious_logo.png layer so its In point 
snaps to the CTI, or press the [ key.
E Tip: To adjust the 
selected layer’s In point 
to the current time, 
press the left bracket 
key ([). To adjust the 
selected layer’s Out 
point to the current 
time, press the right 
bracket key (]).

21 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
understanding keyframes
In traditional cel animation, the term keyframe refers to a single frame (or drawing) 
that illustrates key points in an animation. After the keyframes were drawn by a 
senior animator, the junior animators would draw all of the in-between frames.
In After Effects, keyframes work similarly to their traditional counterparts:  
A keyframe refers to a fixed property value at any given moment in time. After 
Effects automatically calculates all of the values in between two or more keyframes.
To create keyframes for a property, you must first activate the stopwatch icon next 
to the property’s name in the Timeline or in the Effect Controls panel.
The stopwatch icon acts as a switch to toggle whether the property is animated or 
not. When a property’s stopwatch is activated, After Effects makes a keyframe at 
the current time. This keyframe will have the property’s current value. Changing 
the property’s value while the CTI is on a frame without a keyframe will create a 
new keyframe at the current time.
You may change any property’s value at any given frame in your composition. 
Making these changes will automatically add or modify a keyframe for that prop-
erty at the current time. To put it plain and simple, you would click a property’s 
stopwatch to begin animating a property.
If you are more familiar working with clips in a timeline and not keyframes, this 
general workflow may not feel intuitive. However, the more you practice with it,  
the more you will become familiar with this process.

192 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
animating your layers
Now that you have adjusted the In points of many of the layers in Afrolicious_cover, 
it’s time to animate them into place.
Let’s start with the Afrolicious logo.
animating the afrolicious logo
You’ll animate the layer’s scale and opacity so that it shrinks down and fades  
in simultaneously.
1 Select the afrolicious_logo.png layer and press the S key to show the layer’s 
scale.
2 Hold down the Shift key as you press the T key to show the layer’s opacity and 
then the P key to show the layer’s position.
3 Press the I key to go to the layer’s In point, adjust the Position value to 
778.5,1175, and adjust the Opacity value to 0%. Leave the Scale at 100, 100%.
4 Click once on the stopwatch icons for Scale and Opacity to toggle animation for 
these properties. Notice that Scale and Opacity now have diamond-shaped icons 
at the current frame. These diamond-shaped icons are keyframes.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 193
5 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:03:04 and adjust the Opacity to 100%.
Notice that once a property’s stopwatch has been activated, any change to the 
property’s value will cause a new keyframe to be created automatically at the 
current frame.
By animating a layer’s Opacity property between 0% and 100%, you are making 
the layer gradually appear over the span of time between these keyframes.
6 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:03:08 and adjust the Scale value to 70%.
Scrub through your Timeline. Notice how animating Scale causes a layer to grow 
or shrink in size. Also note that both Scale and Opacity are animated. Indeed, it 
is possible to animate multiple properties on the same layer.
7 Select the second Scale keyframe icon on the afrolicious_logo.png layer. Then 
right-click on the keyframe and choose Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease.
Notice how this keyframe icon is no longer diamond shaped. Anytime a 
keyframe is not diamond shaped, it means that the speed of animation going 
into and/or out of that keyframe is not constant.
When Easy Ease is applied to a keyframe, the speed of animation going into the 
keyframe gradually slows down, and then the speed of animation going out of 
the keyframe gradually speeds up. Easy Ease lends a bit of realism to animation, 
because moving objects in the real world typically speed up and slow down 
gradually rather than move at a constant speed.
E Tip: Do not 
deactivate a property’s 
stopwatch once you  
have created keyframes. 
Doing so will auto-
matically delete all 
of that property’s 
keyframes!

194 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
animating Pleasuretime
Now you will animate the Pleasuretime text object so that it moves and gradually 
appears, simultaneously.
1 Select the layer Pleasuretime, and press the P key to show the layer’s position.
2 Hold down the Shift key and press the T key to show the layer’s opacity.
3 Press the I key to go to the layer’s In point, adjust the Opacity to 0%, and adjust 
the Position value to 1289.0,1290.5.
4 Click once on the stopwatch icons for Position and Opacity.
5 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:03:12, adjust the Opacity to 100%, adjust your CTI to 
0:00:03:16, and adjust the Position to 1055.0,1290.5.
6 Select this position keyframe icon. Right-click on it, and choose 
Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease.
Scrub through your Timeline, and you’ll notice that this layer is moving from 
right to left as it gradually appears.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 195
animating the character layers
The character layers will all fade in at the same rate but at different times. Because 
the same animation will be applied to all of them, you can create keyframes for 
one of them, copy those keyframes, and then paste the keyframes to the rest of the 
character layers individually.
Let’s first apply keyframes to character4.
1 Select the layer character4.
2 Press the T key to show the layer’s opacity, press the I key to go to the layer’s In 
point, and adjust the Opacity to 0%.
3 Click once on the stopwatch icon for Opacity.
4 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:01:03 and adjust the Opacity to 100%.
5 With your Selection tool, draw a marquee around these two opacity keyframes.
6 Press Command+C (Ctrl+C) to copy these keyframes.
7 Select the layer character3.

196 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
8 Press the I key to go to the layer’s In point, and then press Command+V 
(Ctrl+V) to paste. Press the U key to show all animated properties and their 
keyframes for character3.
The opacity keyframes that you copied from character4 are now pasted on 
character3. Note that you didn’t have to activate the Opacity stopwatch for 
character3 because pasting keyframes onto a layer will automatically activate 
the stopwatch for the property that is getting the keyframes.
Now do the same for character2 and character1.
9 Select the layer character2. Press the I key to go to the layer’s In point, and then 
press Command+V (Ctrl+V) to paste. Press the U key to show all animated 
properties and their keyframes for character2.
10 Select the layer character1. Press the I key to go to the layer’s In point, and then 
press Command+V (Ctrl+V) to paste. Press the U key to show all animated 
properties and their keyframes for character1.
adjusting an anchor point
You’ll animate the cityscape layer so that it appears to grow from the ground, 
stretching upward and then shrinking back down as if attached to a spring. This 
will lend a bit of cartoonish motion to your outro.
To do this, you’ll need to adjust the cityscape’s anchor point. An anchor point is the 
coordinate in a layer’s space around which the layer will scale or rotate. To make 
the cityscape layer appear as if it’s growing upward from its bottom, you need to 
adjust its anchor point to the bottom of the layer.
1 Select the layer cityscape.
2 Press the A key to show the layer’s anchor point.
3 Hold down the Shift key and press the P key to show the layer’s position, and 
then press the S key to show the layer’s scale.
4 Press the I key to go to the layer’s In point.
 Note: Keyframes will 
be pasted onto a layer 
at the current time.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 197
5 Adjust the anchor point to 789.5,606.0.
But wait! By adjusting this layer’s anchor point, you’ve shifted it upward in the 
composition’s frame! No problem. This is easily fixed.
6 Adjust the Position to 789.5,975.
Now preview your work.
7 Do a RAM Preview by clicking on the RAM Preview icon in the Preview panel, 
or by pressing 0 on your numeric keypad.

lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
Deactivating constrained proportions
By default, a layer’s width and height scale are linked together. But what if you  
want to adjust or animate a layer’s height and width separately? You can do this 
easily enough.
On the cityscape layer, click once on the chain link icon next to the Scale value to 
deactivate constrained proportions.
animating vertical scale only
Let’s make the cityscape layer animate as if it is growing upward, achieving an 
extended height, and then springing back down to its resting height.
1 Select the cityscape layer and press 1 to adjust your CTI to its In point. Adjust 
the Scale value to 100.0,0.0%. Click once on the stopwatch icon for Scale.
2 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:00:12 and adjust the Scale to 100.0,120.0%.
3 Select this scale keyframe, right-click on it, and then choose 
Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease.
4 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:00:17, adjust the Scale to 100.0,90.0%, adjust your  
CTI to 0:00:00:21, and adjust the Scale to 100.0,100.0%.
Notice that once a property’s keyframe is set to Easy Ease, all keyframes made 
later in time will automatically be set to Easy Ease.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 199
Finishing the outro
Now you’ll finish the outro motion graphic that will appear at the end of your edit 
by employing a few useful techniques in Adobe After Effects.
using nested compositions
A layer can be an imported footage item, and it can also be another composition!  
If you create an animation with several layers in one composition and then put that 
composition into a second composition, the layers of the first composition will be 
flattened into one layer in the second composition. This is called nesting a composi-
tion. Nesting compositions in After Effects is a way to group multiple layers, much 
like creating a folder of layers in Photoshop Extended.
1 In your Timeline, click on the Afrolicious_Outro tab to open that composition.
2 In the Comps folder, in your Project panel, select Afrolicious_cover and drag it 
into the Timeline of Afrolicious_Outro, directly above Live_23-60.mp4.
3 You’ll be animating this composition later. For now, turn off its visibility switch 
(or eye icon).

200 
lesson 5 
Creating basic motion Graphics and visual effects
time-stretching
In the Timeline of Afrolicious_Outro, notice how the two video clip layers, 
Live_23-60.mp4 and Live_25-60.mp4, are not the same duration as this composi-
tion. You want to extend their durations, thereby slowing them down in the process, 
so that these layers don’t end abruptly before the animation is done. This is called 
time-stretching.
1 Select the layer Live_25-60.mp4.
2 Activate its solo switch so that all other layers are temporarily made invisible.
3 Choose Layer > Time > Time Stretch. In the Time Stretch dialog, set the New 
Duration to 0:00:05:00 and click OK.
4
Turn off this layer’s solo switch.
5
Select the layer Live_23-60.mp4.
6
Choose Layer > Time > Time Stretch. In the Time Stretch dialog, set the New 
Duration to 0:00:05:00 and click OK.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 201
Finishing touches
Now you’ll add the final adjustments and animations to the layers in your final 
comp. You’ll first shrink the two video layers and place them in frame. 
1 Select the layer Live_25-60.mp4. 
2 Press the P key to show the layer’s position. Hold down the Shift key and press 
the S key to show the layer’s scale.
3 Adjust the Position to 320.0,360.0 and adjust the Scale to 50.0,50.0%.
4 Select the layer Live_23-60.mp4.
5 Press the P key to show the layer’s position. Hold down the Shift key and press 
the S key to show the layer’s scale.
6 Adjust the Position to 960.0,360.0 and adjust the Scale to 50.0,50.0%.
Now you’ll animate the Afrolicious_cover nested comp into place.
1 Press the Home key to make sure your CTI is at the beginning of your comp.
2
Select the layer Afrolicious_cover.
3
Click its eye icon to make it visible again.
4
Press the S key to show the layer’s scale and adjust the layer’s Scale to 81.0,81.0%.

5 Click once on the stopwatch icon for Scale.
6 Adjust your CTI to 0:00:03:00 and adjust the layer’s Scale to 35.0,35.0%.
7 Select this scale keyframe, right-click it, and then choose Keyframe Assistant > 
Easy Ease.
Notice that all of the animation in Afrolicious_cover is still visible, and by 
animating this nested comp, you are compounding the animation.
8 Now preview your work. Go to the Preview panel and click the RAM Preview 
button, or press 0 on your numeric keypad.

Incrementing your after effects project
If you are continuing from the previous lesson, feel free to continue with the After 
Effects CS6 project you currently have open. If you are starting at this lesson, you’ll 
open an After Effects project file provided for you.
When working in Adobe After Effects CS6, it’s good work practice to regularly save 
a new version of your project file, especially before making any substantial changes 
to the project. You can then revert to an earlier version if you need to. Also, if your 
current project file becomes corrupted, you won’t have lost everything. You can 
restore lost work based on an earlier saved version.
After Effects gives you a simple way to save a new version of your project file by 
creating an increment. An increment is merely a new copy of the current project 
file with a “2” added to the end of the filename. If your project filename already 
ends with a number, incrementing your project file will add one to that number.  
For example, by incrementing Afrolicious_Promo_01, you’ll create a new copy 
called Afrolicious_Promo_02.
1 Launch Adobe After Effects CS6.
2 Choose File > Open Project. Navigate to Lesson 06 (Adobe CS6 Project Assets > 
Lessons > Lesson 06) on your hard drive.
3 Select Afrolicious_Promo_01.aep and click Open.
4 Choose File > Increment and Save to automatically save the currently open 
project file as Afrolicious_Promo_02. 
The project file Afrolicious_Promo_01 is still on your hard drive.
Keep this project open in Adobe After Effects for now as you dive into Adobe 
Illustrator CS6.
about adobe Illustrator
Adobe Illustrator is the industry-standard application for creating static vector 
graphics for print, video, and the web. With it, you can create layered images that 
can be integrated with other layers in Photoshop, Flash, and After Effects.
A great new feature in After Effects CS6 allows you to convert an imported 
Illustrator image into an editable shape layer, which can then be extruded using 
After Effects CS6’s new Ray-traced 3D Render engine. The following exercises will 
show you the basics of how to do this.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 207
Creating vector imagery with Image trace 
The motion graphic outro that will appear at the end of the Afrolicious promo 
video currently displays the Afrolicious logo as a flat graphic. You’ll enhance the 
look of the logo graphic—and with it the motion graphic and the final Afrolicious 
promo video—by giving it some 3D thickness, or extrusion. An extruded graphic 
can be more visually interesting than a flat graphic, and with the new extrusion 
feature in Adobe After Effects CS6, creating an extruded graphic is very easy.
To do this, you must first convert the current raster logo graphic into a vector 
graphic in Adobe Illustrator CS6 using the Image Trace feature.
Image Trace allows you to easily convert a raster image, such as a photograph or 
other pixel-based graphic, into a vector graphic. This vector graphic can be brought 
into Adobe After Effects, which allows vector graphics to be scaled up without 
getting pixelated artifacts. In addition, using a new feature in After Effects CS6, 
an imported vector graphic can be converted into an editable shape layer, which 
means you don’t need to return to Adobe Illustrator to make changes to the origi-
nal vector graphic.
You’ll import the Image-traced logo vector graphic to Adobe After Effects CS6 
where you’ll then convert it into a shape layer, which you’ll then extrude.
raster images vs. vector images
It’s important to know the difference between raster images and vector images. 
Here is a brief explanation of the difference and what they are typically used for.
A raster image is made up of a finite grid of pixels. Typically, this would be a digi-
tized photograph, but it could also be a frame from a video clip or a scanned draw-
ing. A raster image can be saved in a variety of different file formats, such as a .jpg, 
.png, .tiff, or in the native Adobe Photoshop Extended .psd format. Raster images can 
offer high-resolution photorealistic detail but are limited by their native image size. 
If a raster image is scaled larger than its native size, the edges in the image will look 
jagged and pixelated.
A vector image is made up of paths; each path is defined by an underlying math-
ematical formula, which determines how the path is shaped. The paths are assigned 
colors as strokes on the paths or fills within the paths. A vector image would 
typically be a logo graphic saved as a .eps file or in the native Adobe Illustrator .ai 
format. The advantage of vector graphics is that they can be scaled without showing 
pixelated edges, thus retaining their image quality.

Converting the graphic to a vector image
Let’s use the afrolicious_logo.png image in the Graphics folder and convert it into  
a vector graphic using Illustrator’s new Image Trace feature.
1 Open Illustrator CS6.
2 Choose File > Open. Navigate to the Graphics folder, select afrolicious_logo.png, 
and click Open.
Notice that many of the tools in Illustrator, such as the Selection tool, are 
similar to tools that you would see in other Creative Suite applications, and they 
function the same way.
3 Select the graphic using the Selection tool.
You want to convert this raster (or pixel-based) image into a vector image 
that has a transparent background. This is important because the current logo 
graphic has no background, and you want to maintain consistency in the design 
of your motion graphic.
4 Click the Image Trace button at the top of the interface.
The image will become a vector graphic with a white background.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 209
5 Click the Layers panel button on the right side of the interface to open the 
Layers panel.
    
6 Twirl open Layer 1 by clicking the disclosure triangle. You’ll notice that the 
resulting white background cannot be selected and removed.
7 Undo this Image Trace by pressing Command+Z (Ctrl+Z).
8 With the graphic still selected, choose Object > Image Trace > Make and Expand.

210 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
Doing so will not only image trace the bitmap graphic, but it will make every 
visible element into a separate editable object. This is what you want to do so 
you can easily remove the white background, thus keeping the background of 
the resulting vector graphic transparent.
editing the Image-traced logo
Now you’ll do a bit of cleanup to the Image-traced logo graphic.
1 Click the Layers panel button. In the Layers panel within Layer 1, twirl open 
Group.
2 Scroll down to the bottom of the Layers panel to find the bottommost object, 
which is the white background. Turn off this object’s visibility switch (or eye icon).
E Tip: Raster images 
with distinct color 
contrast yield more 
detailed Image-traced 
vector graphics.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 211
Notice how the graphic no longer has a white box behind the letters.
Also notice how the inner paths of some of the letters—the inner hole of the O, 
for example—have a white fill. You want to remove those.
3 From the Tools panel, choose the Direct Selection tool, or press the A key.
4 Deselect all by pressing Command+Shift+A (Ctrl+Shift+A), or click on a blank 
area of the image.
5 Using the Direct Selection tool, click on the inner white fill of the first O to 
select it, and press Delete to get rid of it.
6 Select the inner white fill of the last O with the Direct Selection tool and press 
Delete. Do this with the small inner white fills of the A, R, and S.
7 Choose File > Save As, navigate to the Graphics folder (Adobe CS6 Project 
Assets > Graphics), name this new file afrolicious_logo.ai, and click Save.

8 In the Illustrator Options window that appears, click OK.
Importing your vector logo to after effects
Now that the vector logo is cleaned up, you’ll take it into After Effects where you 
will use it to replace a layer that is already in a composition.
1 Switch to After Effects.
2 Choose File > Import > File, navigate to the Graphics folder, select the 
afrolicious_logo.ai file that you just made, and click Open.
E Tip: Switch between   
open applications by  
pressing Command+ 
Tab (Alt+Tab).

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 213
3 The graphic should appear in your Project panel. Double-click on it to display it 
in the Footage panel.
Here you encounter a slight problem. Notice that you’re not seeing the entire 
graphic! You’re only seeing the center section, and the rest of the graphic 
appears cropped.
 Note: Some image formats, such as the Adobe Illustrator native .ai format, .tiff, or .psd 
contain metadata that determines the size of their artboards when these images are opened 
in Illustrator. However, other image formats, such as .png or .jpg, do not contain such metadata 
and the default size of the artboard in Adobe Illustrator CS6 is determined by the size of the 
last artboard used. Your afrolicious_logo.png graphic may not appear cropped exactly as in the 
figures shown.
Making motion graphics is rarely a smooth and flawless process, and little 
problems like this are a typical occurrence. Don’t panic! You can fix it.
4 Switch back to Illustrator.
Look closely and you’ll see a white rectangle in the background of the graphic. 
This is called the Artboard, and it determines the visible area of this graphic. 
You’ll need to expand the Artboard to the bounds of the graphic, and then 
resave the file.
E Tip: Paths from 
Illustrator can be 
copied and pasted to 
After Effects as motion 
paths, mask paths, or 
shape paths.

214 
lesson 6

5 Choose Object > Artboards > Fit to Artwork Bounds. The Artboard expands to 
the outer edges of the entire graphic.

Save your file by pressing Command+S (Ctrl+S).
7
Switch back to After Effects.

Select the already imported afrolicious_logo.ai footage in your Project panel.
After Effects conveniently gives you the ability to reload an imported graphic to 
reflect any changes that you have saved to it in another program. You don’t need 
to reimport the graphic and reapply any changes you may have made to it in any 
compositions.
9 Choose File > Reload Footage.
10 At the bottom of the Footage panel, click the Magnification menu and choose 
Fit up to 100%. You should see the refreshed changes to the graphic.
11 Click the Toggle Transparency Grid button to see the graphic against its 
transparent background.
swapping a layer with a different media item
Now let’s add this graphic to the Afrolicious_cover composition. Recall that you’ve 
already applied some animation to the original afrolicious_logo.png layer.
Another convenient feature in After Effects is the ability to swap a layer in a com-
position with another footage item. You don’t have to reapply all of the changes and 
animations you may have already made to a layer. All of these changes and anima-
tions will remain intact when you replace the layer with different footage.

216 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
1 In the Afrolicious_cover Timeline, select the afrolicious_logo.png layer.
2 In the Project panel, select the afrolicious_logo.ai graphic.
3 Hold down the Option (Alt) key, and drag and drop the afrolicious_logo.ai 
graphic into the Timeline.
The afrolicious_logo.png layer is replaced by afrolicious_logo.ai.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 217
4 Scrub through your Timeline, and you’ll notice that everything you had applied 
to the original afrolicious_logo.png layer remains intact on this new layer.
5 In the Project panel, select the afrolicious_logo.ai graphic, and drag and drop it 
into the Graphics folder. Try to keep your Project panel organized as you work.

Creating 3D extrusions in after effects Cs6
New in After Effects CS6 is the Ray-traced 3D Renderer, which allows for vector 
shape layers and text layers to be extruded as well as rendered with reflections and 
environment maps.
Although it is not required, it is recommended that your system have a supported  
graphics processor to utilize the increased productivity and speed of GPU rendering.
Now that you have the vector graphic in the composition, let’s convert it into a 
shape layer and then extrude it.
1 Select the layer afrolicious_logo.ai.
2 Click Layer > Create Shapes from Vector Layer.
You should see a new shape layer in your Timeline 
called afrolicious_logo Outlines. Also, notice that the 
afrolicious_logo.ai layer is turned off but is still there.  
This is convenient because you may end up changing  
your mind and decide to turn it back on.
 Note: For a list of 
supported GPUs for  
use with the Ray-traced 
3D Renderer, go to 
www.adobe.com/
products/aftereffects/
tech-specs.html.

218 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
3 Drag this shape layer below the Levels Adjustment layer.
4 To apply an extrusion to this shape layer, you must turn on its 3D switch.  
Click once on the 3D switch for the afrolicious_logo Outlines layer.
5 The extrusion feature also requires the Ray-traced 3D Renderer to be activated 
because the Classic 3D Renderer does not support extrusions. Do this by 
clicking the Classic 3D button at the top right of the composition window (if the 
Ray-traced 3D Renderer isn't already activated).
The Composition Settings window opens showing the Advanced settings. 
3D in after effects
By default, layers in After Effects CS6 have two-dimensional spatial coordinates. 
However, you have the option to activate a layer’s 3D switch so that the layer has 
three-dimensional spatial coordinates. A 3D layer can be moved horizontally, verti-
cally, and forward and backward in z-space, and can also be rotated on three sepa-
rate axes of rotation. Using 3D space in After Effects allows for the use of camera 
layers and light layers, making your motion graphics more compelling to the viewer.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 219
ray-traced 3D renderer
After Effects CS6 introduces a new Ray-traced 3D rendering engine, allowing you 
to simply and quickly design fully ray-traced, geometric text and shape layers in 3D 
space. These enhanced 3D capabilities include:
•
Beveled and extruded text and shape layers, adding depth to graphic designs 
without compromising animations
•
Bending of footage and composition layers, adding dimension and yielding 
more interesting lighting effects for otherwise flat content
•
Environment map support for photorealistic reflections of virtual imagery in 
addition to the layers included in a composition
•
Additional material options, including reflection, transparency, and index of 
refraction to mimic light traveling through glass and other translucent materials
The Ray-traced 3D Renderer works best on systems that have a supported graphics 
processor. Systems without a supported GPU will rely on CPU rendering and the 
new Ray-traced 3D features will render much more slowly.
For more information on which graphics processors support the new Ray-traced 3D 
rendering in Adobe After Effects CS6, go to www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/
tech-specs.html.
6 From the Renderer drop-down menu, choose Ray-traced 3D, and click OK at 
the bottom of this window.

7 Adjust your current time indicator (CTI) to 0:00:03:04.
8 Twirl open the afrolicious_logo Outlines layer to reveal the Geometry Options 
and set the Extrusion Depth value to 200.
Notice how this shape layer has a thickness to it, as if the logo is not just a flat 
part of the CD cover but is a 3D object extending toward the viewer.
9 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
shape layers in after effects
Adobe After Effects features a versatile type of layer called a shape layer. These are 
vector layers that enable you to create vector graphics natively in After Effects. With 
these, you don’t need to create all of your vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator and 
import them to After Effects.
Shape layers continuously rasterize, which means that they can be scaled at any size 
without suffering from jagged pixelated edges.
Shape layers have their own set of effects that allow you to:
•
Generate simple and complex shape paths
•
Apply solid or gradient stroke colors
•
Apply solid or gradient fill colors
•
Animate strokes along paths
•
Distort and merge paths
•
Create repetitions of shapes
•
Create groups of different paths and properties on the same layer
 Note: Unless  
your system has a 
supported GPU, using 
the Ray-traced 3D 
Renderer in After Effects 
uses your system’s CPU 
cores and can result in 
slow previewing and 
final rendering.

about adobe Photoshop extended
Adobe Photoshop Extended is the industry-standard application for creating still-
image composites and for doing photographic color corrections and manipulations. 
It is used by graphic designers, web designers, motion graphic designers, and video 
editors, and it can play an essential role in your workflow when you’re using other 
applications in the Adobe Creative Suite, including After Effects, Flash, InDesign, 
and Adobe Premiere Pro.
useful features in  
Photoshop Cs6 extended
Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended includes several new features that can enhance the 
workflow of video editors and motion graphic artists. These include:
•
mercury Graphics engine, which uses the processing power of your graphics 
card to greatly speed up your image editing tasks.
•
3D controls, which allow you to create and even animate 3D artwork, such as 
extruded text.
•
new Blur Gallery, which gives you more options to apply blurs to your still 
images and video frames. Create tilt-shift blur effects, manipulate versatile blur 
focal points, and more.
•
reflections and draggable shadows, which enable you to add 3D realism to 
your images. 3D objects can reflect on the ground plane in your images, and 
shadows can be realistically manipulated as you adjust virtual light sources.
using Liquify in Photoshop
Let’s take a close look at the design of the 
Afrolicious_cover graphic and see if there’s 
anything in it that could use a little touching 
up in Photoshop. Notice that there is a slightly 
repetitive brush stroke on the far right of the 
image on the bottom_brush_fill layer.
In this exercise, you’ll perform retouching to 
the Afrolicious_cover graphic using the Liquify 
effect in Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended.
Although this layered Photoshop image has 
already been imported to After Effects and has been used as a layer in a composi-
tion, you have the ability to edit any of the original layers in Photoshop and easily 
refresh your changes in After Effects.

222 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
If a graphic has been imported to After Effects, you can access the original file and 
open it in its native application without having to first find the file on your hard drive.
1 In the Afrolicious_cover composition, select the bottom_brush_fill layer.
2 Choose Edit > Edit Original. Photoshop Extended opens the original 
Afrolicious_cover image.
E Tip: Press 
Command+E (Ctrl+E) to 
edit a selected footage 
item or layer in a 
supported application.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 223
3 Select the bottom_brush_fill layer, hold down the Option (Alt) key, and click on 
this layer’s visibility switch to make it the only visible layer. This will prevent any 
accidental edits to the other layers.
  
Now let’s focus on the brush stroke 
on this layer that you want to fix.
You’ll smooth out this brush stroke 
using the Liquify filter. Photoshop 
CS6 Extended takes advantage 
of the Mercury Graphics Engine, 
which accesses the power of your 
computer’s GPU to calculate complex 
image manipulations with great 
speed. Using this engine, the Liquify 
filter can make visible changes in  
real time.

224

4 Choose Filter > Liquify to activate the Liquify filter.
The filter window appears, and you’ll see a brush icon that resembles a  
circular crosshair.
5 With this brush, click and drag across the layer until the repetitive brush stroke 
is smoothed over. Repeat as you deem necessary.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 225

using transfer modes in after effects
After Effects gives you many different ways of compositing layers to achieve desired 
results. For instance, it offers different ways of blending layers through the use of 
layer opacity (with masks, for example, which you’ll explore later). Another way 
that you can composite layers is through the use of Transfer Modes, which are very 
effective at removing the white or black areas of grayscale layers.
Transfer Modes work by blending color values of layers, including color brightness, 
hue, or saturation.
Let’s take a look at some of the layers in the Afrolicious_cover composition and 
determine how Transfer Modes are being utilized.
1 Click the Toggles Switches/Modes button at the bottom of the Timeline.
E Tip: Toggle between 
showing the Switches 
and Modes in your 
Timeline by pressing 
the F4 key.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 227
Notice how some layers are set to the default Normal mode, and others are set 
to Screen or Soft Light. How did these settings get there?
This is another example of how well Photoshop Extended and After Effects 
integrate seamlessly. If a layer in a Photoshop image has a Blend Mode applied 
to it and that Photoshop image is imported to After Effects as a composition 
(as you have done), the Blend Mode remains intact in the corresponding After 
Effects layer as a Transfer Mode.
2 Click on the solo switch for the brush1 layer.
3 At the bottom of the Composition panel, click the Toggle Transparency Grid 
button to activate it.
Notice that the brush1 layer is now the only layer visible (because its solo switch 
is on). But more important, notice that this layer has its own black background 
along with the light-gray brush stroke. Why didn’t you see this black area on the 
layer before?
The Screen mode applied to the layer uses the layer’s color brightness and 
blends it with the visible layers below it. The Screen mode is a form of additive 
blending whereby darker colors approach transparent while brighter colors 
are retained. Modes such as Add, Lighten, and Color Dodge will yield similar 
results with different subtleties. So although the layer has a rectangular black 
 Note: Blend Modes 
in Photoshop Extended 
are analogous to 
Transfer Modes in After 
Effects.
E Tip: Toggling solo 
switches on layers in 
Adobe After Effects 
allows you to make all 
other layers invisible in 
the same composition.

228 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
background, instead of masking or keying the black region, all you need to do  
is apply the Screen mode and the black background disappears.
4 Deactivate the solo switch for the brush1 layer to confirm that, indeed, the 
Screen mode is causing the black background to disappear.
understanding and applying motion Blur
Motion blur is a visual artifact that occurs in varying degrees based on the speed  
of a camera’s shutter. Objects in motion will appear blurry, especially at lower  
shutter speeds.
After Effects can easily simulate this visual effect on a layer in motion. Let’s apply 
Motion Blur to some of the layers in the Afrolicious_cover composition as well as 
the Afrolicious_Outro composition to give these moving layers a subtle touch  
of realism.
1 In After Effects, Open the Afrolicious_cover composition, and click the Toggle 
Switches/Modes button at the bottom of the Timeline so that the Switches  
are visible.
Notice the three columns of switches that appear as empty boxes. The left 
column, underneath an icon of a ball in motion, is the Motion Blur switch.  
To activate Motion Blur for a layer, click inside its Motion Blur switch.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 229
2 Turn on Motion Blur for all of the layers in this comp except for Levels 
Adjustment and afrolicious_logo.ai (because these layers are not visible).
3 To see motion blur in your RAM Preview, you must also click the large Motion 
Blur button at the top of the Timeline to activate it.
4 Do a RAM Preview by clicking the RAM Preview button in the Preview panel  
or by pressing the 0 key on your numeric keypad.
Watch your RAM Preview and notice how the layers appear slightly blurred 
while they are moving.
E Tip: To activate the 
Motion Blur switch—or 
any other switch—for 
multiple layers in the 
Timeline, click one 
switch and then drag 
up or down along the 
same switch for other 
layers in the layer stack.

230 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
5 As a comparison, turn off the Motion Blur switch for the Pleasuretime layer and 
do another RAM Preview.
6 Reactivate the Motion Blur switch for the Pleasuretime layer.
7 Open the Afrolicious_Outro composition, and activate the Motion Blur switch 
for the Afrolicious_cover layer.
It should be noted that because you did a RAM Preview of the Afrolicious_cover 
composition, After Effects would render the Afrolicious_Outro composition 
more quickly because it does not need to recalculate the preview for the nested 
Afrolicious_cover composition.
8 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
Simply by activating the Motion Blur switches on layers that are moving, your final 
motion graphic will have an added subtle touch of realism.
A word of warning; although motion blur will yield a more realistic and visually 
attractive result, having motion blur turned on will also significantly increase your 
render time. On the other hand, using motion blur is less time-consuming than 
hand keyframing a blur on each layer. There is no reason to activate motion blur  
for layers that are not in motion.
E Tip: The amount 
of motion blur that 
renders on a layer is 
determined by the 
Shutter Angle property 
in the Advanced tab in 
Composition Settings.

the most-used effects
Although Adobe After Effects ships with dozens of effects for doing color correction, 
blurring and sharpening, texturing, and shape generation, chances are that you 
won’t use all of these effects. However, you’ll probably use a handful of these effects 
on a regular basis. Your mileage may vary, but the following effects are generally 
accepted as the most-used because they can be applied to projects for motion 
graphics, visual effects compositing, and video editing: 
•
Levels. This is a general purpose effect for adjusting brightness and contrast on 
discrete Red, Green, and Blue color channels, or all color channels combined. 
This effect has a histogram control that functions like that of the Levels image 
adjustment in Adobe Photoshop Extended.
•
Fast Blur. This is a Gaussian Blur effect with very simple controls that can be 
used to soften the details of a layer to reduce video noise or grain, create a 
“dreamy” look, or make a layer look like it’s far away and out of focus.
•
hue/saturation. This effect is used for adjusting the hue and saturation color 
properties of a layer. This has a multitude of uses, including applying a duotone 
look to a layer, enhancing or reducing the saturation of a layer’s colors, and 
remapping the hues of a layer’s colors to different hues.
•
Drop shadow. This effect is used to create the illusion of depth on a 2D layer 
to make what appears to be a shadow being cast behind the layer. This is very 
useful to create a subtle separation between a layer in the foreground and layers 
behind it.
•
ramp. This creates a two-colored gradient on a layer that can be a linear 
gradient or a radial gradient. The Ramp effect is useful for making simple 
gradients for a background layer.
adding and animating effects 
with after effects
After Effects comes with hundreds of effects—analogous to filters in Photoshop—
that can be applied to layers to perform a multitude of operations, such as color 
correction, blurring and sharpening, texturing, and image distortion. Don’t be 
daunted by the sheer number of effects, because you’ll probably use only a dozen  
or so on a regular basis.
Let’s apply a Blur effect to some layers in the Afrolicious_Outro composition. This 
is a simple way of making layers in the background appear out of focus and far 
away, lending an illusion of depth to your composition.

232 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
1 Open the Afrolicious_Outro composition, and press the End key to adjust your 
CTI to the last frame in the Timeline.
2 Select the crowd01.png layer.
3 Choose Effect > Blur & Sharpen > Fast Blur.
4 Twirl open the crowd01.png layer to reveal the Fast Blur Effect and all of its 
controls.
5 Adjust the Blurriness value to 5, and change Repeat Edge Pixels to On. This 
setting ensures that the edges of an applied layer do not appear softened, and 
that layers below do not show through the blurred layer’s edges.
E Tip: To show all 
effects on a layer, select 
the layer and press E.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 233
In your Composition panel, notice how the crowd01.png layer in the 
background now appears slightly blurred.
Let’s also apply a Fast Blur effect to the layers Live_23-60.mp4 and Live_25-60.mp4. 
You could apply the Fast Blur effect to these layers separately, but there’s an 
easier way to apply one effect to multiple layers: You use an Adjustment Layer, 
which is a special type of layer. When one or more effects is applied to an 
Adjustment Layer, those effects are rendered on all visible layers stacked below 
the Adjustment Layer.
6 Create an Adjustment Layer by choosing Layer > New > Adjustment Layer.

234 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
A new Adjustment Layer 1 appears at the top of the layer stack in your Timeline.
7 With your Selection tool, drag this layer so that it is below the Afrolicious_cover 
layer but above the Live_23-60.mp4 layer.
Incidentally, you may notice that the Adjustment Layer is not a visible object in 
your composition window.
8 With the Adjustment Layer still selected, choose Effect > Blur & Sharpen >  
Fast Blur.
The Fast Blur effect will be applied to the Adjustment Layer.
9 Twirl open the Adjustment Layer in your Timeline to reveal the Fast Blur effect 
and all of its controls.
E Tip: To apply  
the last effect used,  
press Command+ 
Option+Shift+E 
(Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E). 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 235
10 Adjust the Blurriness value to 5, and change Repeat Edge Pixels to On.
Notice that the layers Live_23-60.mp4 and Live_25-60.mp4 now appear slightly 
blurred, but the Afrolicious_cover layer does not. The reason is that the effects 
applied to an Adjustment Layer will only render on the visible layers stacked 
below it.
Also notice that the file crowd01.png appears slightly more blurred than before. 
Again, the reason is that it has a Fast Blur effect already applied to it, but it is 
also stacked below the Adjustment Layer with its own Fast Blur effect.

Creating static and animated 
masks in after effects
A mask is a vector shape that you can draw on a layer so that the layer is visible  
or invisible based on the area of the layer that is masked. This is an operation that  
is available in Photoshop. However, in After Effects, a mask can either be static  
or animated.
Using masks in After Effects gives you more control over visibility for each layer. 
For instance, you can crop out areas of a layer that you don’t want the viewers to 
see. In addition, by using an animated mask, you have a customizable method of 
making a layer appear or disappear over time, so that a layer does not have to be 
revealed all at once or animated from offscreen. In its simplest form, this can look 
like a Wipe transition.
Let’s apply masks to some of the layers in the Afrolicious_cover composition and 
animate these masks by keyframing the Mask Shape property to gradually reveal 
these layers along the horizontal axis.
1 Open the Afrolicious_cover composition.
2 Select the brush1 layer, and activate its solo switch.
E Tip: Adjust your CTI  
one frame backward 
by pressing the Page 
Up key or one frame 
forward by pressing  
the Page Down key. 
Adjust your CTI ten 
frames backward by 
pressing Shift+Page Up 
or ten frames forward 
by pressing Shift+ 
Page Down.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 237
3 Making sure your layer is selected, press the I key to adjust the CTI to the layer’s 
In point. Press Shift+Page Down to move ten frames ahead, and then press  
Page Down twice to move ahead two more frames for a total of 12 frames or a 
half second.
4 In the Tools panel, click the Rectangle tool. 
5 Starting at the top left of the brush1 layer in the Composition panel, click and 
drag with the Rectangle tool down and to the right so that the resulting mask 
encloses the visible, gray brush stroke. Try to make your mask slightly larger 
than the layer.

238 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
6 Press MM (two Ms quickly) to reveal the mask properties.
7 Click the chain link icon next to the Mask Feather values to unconstrain their 
proportions.
8 Set the horizontal Mask Feather value to 20 to soften the edges of the mask.
9 Click the stopwatch icon for Mask Path.
10 With the brush1 layer selected, press the I key to go to its In point.
11 With the Mask Path property still selected, press Command+T (Ctrl+T) to 
activate the mask’s free transform bounding box.
12 Press the V key to activate the Selection tool.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 239
13 Hold down the Shift key and drag the free transform bounding box to the right 
until it is outside of the composition frame. Holding down Shift while you move 
a mask constrains the movement to either the horizontal or vertical axis.
14 Select the second Mask Path keyframe on brush1, right-click on it, and choose 
Keyframe Assistant > Easy Ease.
Now that you’ve animated a mask on one of the brush layers, you can save some 
time by copying and pasting its mask properties to the other brush layers.
15 With the Mask 1 properties visible on brush1 in the Timeline, along with the 
keyframes for Mask Path, use the Selection tool to draw a marquee around 
the Mask Path and Mask Feather properties. Note that by selecting Mask Path 
you’re also selecting its keyframes.
16 Press Command+C (Ctrl+C) to copy these settings and keyframes. Turn off the 
solo switch for brush1.
Now it’s just a matter of pasting this animated mask onto the remaining two 
brush layers.

lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
17 Select the brush2 layer. Turn on its solo switch and press the I key to adjust your 
CTI to its In point.
18 Press Command+V (Ctrl+V) to paste the animated mask.
19 Scrub your CTI through the Timeline to confirm that the animation looks fine 
on brush2. Turn off its solo switch.
20 Select the brush3 layer. Turn on its solo switch and press the I key to adjust your 
CTI to its In point.
21 Press Command+V (Ctrl+V) to paste the animated mask.
22 Scrub your CTI through the Timeline to confirm that the animation looks fine 
on brush3. Turn off its solo switch.
23 Do a RAM Preview by clicking the RAM Preview icon in the Preview panel or 
by pressing the 0 key on your numeric keypad.
You should see all of the brush layers animate along with the animation of the 
other layers in this composition.
24 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
Finishing the outro motion graphic
The final graphics you’ll create for your outro will appear to be stage lights roam-
ing through the frame. These will enhance the look and feel of the video clips in the 
background of the outro that show a live performance in progress.
using shape layers
To create the stage lights, you’ll use yellow circles on shape layers. These layers will 
animate their positions horizontally back and forth across the frame.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 241
Let’s create a shape layer in the Afrolicious_Outro composition.
1 Your Afrolicious_Outro composition should still be open. Click on its tab in the 
Timeline to reveal its layers.
2 Click on the visibility switch (eye icon) for the Afrolicious_cover layer so you 
can see your work.
3 Create a new shape layer by choosing Layer > New > Shape Layer.
This empty shape layer will appear in the Timeline at the top of the layer stack.
4 Click and drag this shape layer directly below the Adjustment Layer.
5 Twirl open the shape layer in the Timeline to reveal the Add button.
6 Click on the Add button and a context menu will appear. This context menu lists 
all of the objects and various shape effects that can be added to the shape layer.
7 From this list, choose Ellipse.
An Ellipse Path property will now be listed under the Contents of the shape 
layer. Twirl open Ellipse Path.
You should see the property for Size, which determines the width and height of 
the Ellipse Path 1. By default, these values are constrained, so adjusting one will 
adjust the other to maintain a constant aspect ratio.

242 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
8 Adjust the Ellipse Path Size to 720 pixels.
In the Composition panel—with the shape layer still selected—you should see 
that the Ellipse Path is the same height as the composition frame.
Now you’ll give the elliptical shape a yellow fill color.
9 In the Timeline, click once again on the shape layer’s Add button, and then 
choose Fill from the list.
Your shape layer now has a solid fill color. By default, the fill color for a shape 
layer is red. You’ll change this to white.
10 Under the shape layer Contents, twirl open the Fill properties. Click on the 
Color swatch.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 243
11 A Color window appears. Choose a pale yellow, and then click OK on the  
Color window. 
Your circle now has a yellow fill color.
Because this shape is supposed to resemble a spotlight landing on a surface,  
let’s give it a bit of blur to soften its edges.
12 With your shape layer selected in the Timeline, choose Effect >  
Blur & Sharpen > Fast Blur.

244 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
13 In the Effect Controls panel, under the Fast Blur properties, set Blurriness to 50.
expressions explained
An expression is a script that you can apply to a layer’s property to manipulate the 
property’s underlying numerical value. Expressions use a scripting language that is 
based on JavaScript. Expressions can have many different functions, ranging from 
the very simple to the incredibly complex, including but not limited to:
•
Assigning a static value to a property
•
Generating a random value for a property
•
Linking one property’s value to another property’s value
•
Translating one range of values into a different range of values
•
Performing Boolean operations (e.g., if x=1 then y=2)
•
Analyzing the content of a text layer
•
Using the value of the current time to apply an ever-increasing numerical value 
to a property
•
Using layers’ stacking order in the Timeline to apply incremental values to the layers

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 245
using the wiggle expression
You won’t animate the shape layer with keyframes. Instead, you’ll create the  
animation with an expression.
An expression is a script that manipulates the underlying numerical value of a 
property to perform various operations. One such operation—using a wiggle
expression—allows you to animate a property by adding randomly generated  
interpolating values to its current value at set intervals of time. 
1 In the Timeline, select the shape layer and press P to show its Position property. 
Because you only want to animate the horizontal position, you’ll need to 
separate the Position property into separate properties for horizontal and 
vertical position.
2 Right-click on the Position property and choose Separate Dimensions.
You should now see separate properties for X Position and Y Position.
To apply an expression to a property, hold down the Option (Alt) key and click 
once on the property’s stopwatch icon.
3 Press Command+Shift+A (Ctrl+Shift+A) to de-select all. Hold down the  
Option (Alt) key and click the stopwatch icon for X Position. This will change 
the Timeline interface slightly. A text field will appear next to X Position that 
has a default script in it.
4 Click once in this field to select the entire script. Using lowercase letters, type 
wiggle(.5,1000).
Translated to English, this means Every .5 seconds interpolate this property’s 
value within a range of plus or minus 1000 pixels.

246 
lesson 6 
Advanced still and motion Graphics techniques
5 Press Enter on your numeric keypad, or click on a blank area in the Timeline 
panel, to register the expression.
6 Do a RAM Preview by pressing 0 on the numeric keypad, or click the RAM 
Preview icon in the Preview window. You’ll see the yellow circle move back and 
forth randomly across the frame. Note that this animation was achieved without 
applying keyframes.
adding motion Blur
Now you’ll add motion blur to the shape layer.
1 Click on the shape layer’s Motion Blur switch.
2 Do a RAM Preview. Notice that the shape layer doesn’t appear to have motion 
blur. The reason is that you need to activate the switch at the top of the Timeline 
to enable Motion Blur for all layers with the Motion Blur switch set.
3 Do another RAM Preview; the shape layer should now have motion blur.
applying a transfer mode
Because you’re supposed to be simulating a stage light, you don’t want it to look 
like a solid yellow circle. You can use a Transfer Mode to blend the yellow fill with 
the layers stacked below.
1 Click the Toggle Switches/Modes button. Click the Modes menu to the right of 
Shape Layer 1 and choose the Add mode.
The Add mode blends the colors of a layer with the visible layers below it, 
resulting in brighter colors than on any contributing layer. By applying the Add 
mode to a bright yellow shape, the result resembles a bright, yellow light shining 
on other colored areas.
2 With the shape layer selected, press the T key to reveal its Opacity setting.
 Note: Remember 
that motion blur can 
significantly increase 
your render times.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 247
3 To decrease the brightness of this layer, adjust the Opacity value to 20%.
Duplicating layers
Now you’ll make more of the stage light shape layers. Fortunately, you won’t have 
to go through all of the previous steps again. You can duplicate After Effects layers, 
and any properties and their values (and animations) will be duplicated with them.
If a layer with a wiggle expression applied to it is duplicated, After Effects will call 
on a different set of random values for the duplicate’s wiggle expression. In other 
words, if you duplicate your shape layer, the duplicate will not wiggle in synch with 
the original, and you’ll end up with several shape layers that move differently. All of 
these shape layers will be made by simply duplicating the one you now have.
1 With your shape layer selected, press Command+D (Ctrl+D) four times to make 
four duplicates. You should now have five of these wiggling shape layers.
2 Turn the Afrolicious_cover layer back on by clicking once on its visibility switch.
3 Do a RAM Preview and watch your composition play in real time.
4 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your After Effects project.

Integrating your after effects composition 
into your adobe Premiere Pro timeline
If you’re continuing from the previous lesson, you should still have your project open  
in Adobe Premiere Pro. If you started at this lesson, navigate to the Lesson 06 folder 
on your hard drive and open the Adobe Premiere Pro project Lesson_06 Start.prproj. 
Save your Adobe Premiere Pro project file in the Lesson 06 folder as Afrolicious 
Promo.prproj.
In your Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 project, you’ll need to import your outro motion 
graphic that you created in Adobe After Effects CS6. Then you’ll add your outro to 
the end of your edit.
Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects can work seamlessly together thanks 
to a feature called Dynamic Link (see Lesson 5 for more details), which allows  
you to import a composition from After Effects into Adobe Premiere Pro without 
having to do any intermediate rendering beforehand. Once your After Effects com-
position is brought into your Adobe Premiere Pro project, any changes you make  
to the composition in After Effects will automatically refresh in your Adobe 
Premiere Pro project.
1 In Adobe Premiere Pro, choose File > Import, or press Command+I (Ctrl+I). 
In the Import window, navigate to your Lesson 06 folder and select your After 
Effects project file Afrolicious_Promo_02.aep. Click Import.
2 An Import After Effects Composition window appears. Click the disclosure 
triangle next to the Comps folder to twirl it open. Select the Afrolicious_Outro 
composition, and then click OK.

How many masks can you have on a layer?
review answers
1 Raster artwork is made up of pixels, and if you scale up your artwork in size, it will 
degrade in image quality. Vector artwork is made up of coordinates and can scale up 
and down to infinite proportions.
2 Image Trace is the Illustrator feature that converts raster artwork to vector artwork.
3 To open a graphic from After Effects in Photoshop, select the graphic in the Project 
panel, and then choose Edit > Edit Original.
4 Motion Blur is important because it simulates the blur that would occur when the 
shutter opens and closes in a real camera lens. Applying Motion Blur in After Effects 
can make computer-generated animation look more realistic.
5 You can have an unlimited number of masks on an individual layer.

Lesson overview
In the previous lessons, you learned some of the basics of video edit-
ing using Adobe Premiere Pro, as well as some of the basics of motion 
graphics using Adobe After Effects. Creating engaging audio is 
essential in video production, because it produces an emotional con-
text through music and sound design, and moves the story forward 
through dialogue and natural audio. In this lesson, you’ll take your 
skills a step further and learn how to do the following:
• Understand the difference between audio clip editing and audio 
track editing
• Keyframe the relative loudness of an audio clip in  
Adobe Premiere Pro
• Send audio clips between Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Audition
• Apply noise reduction to audio clips in Audition
• Create and export a final audio mixdown in Audition
• Add a final audio mixdown to a sequence in Adobe Premiere Pro
This lesson will take approximately 90 minutes to complete.

making your final edit sequence 
in Premiere Pro
If you are continuing from the previous lesson, feel free to continue with the Adobe 
Premiere Pro project you already have open. If you are starting at this lesson, navi-
gate to the Lesson 07 folder on your hard drive and open the Adobe Premiere Pro 
project Lesson_07 Start.prproj. Save your Adobe Premiere Pro project file in the 
Lesson 07 folder as Afrolicious Promo.prproj.
Because you are continuing with a previous version of this edit, you’ll first save a 
new version of your sequence. This allows you to go back to the previous version if 
need be and is a recommended best practice in the video editing workflow.
1 In the Project panel, twirl open the Sequences bin.
2 Click on the Afrolicious Promo Edit 03 sequence to select it. Choose Edit > 
Copy to copy it to your clipboard. Then choose Edit > Paste.
This will make a duplicate of this sequence outside of the Sequences folder.
3 To modify the name of the sequence, click on the name of the sequence to select it.
4 Change the name of the sequence to Afrolicious Promo Edit 04, press Return 
(Enter), and drag it into the Sequences folder.
5 Double-click the Afrolicious Promo Edit 04 sequence to load it in your Timeline.
Note that the sequence appears in a new tabbed Timeline panel in front of your 
original sequence.
Having multiple Timeline panels open simultaneously can be useful in certain 
situations, but it can also be confusing. For the time being, you’ll close the first  
Timeline to eliminate the possibility of accidentally modifying the wrong sequence.

that you are working on the most recent iteration.
8 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your Adobe Premiere Pro project.
monitoring audio
If you’re editing audio with the Adobe Creative suite of applications, it’s impor-
tant to use recommended methods and quality equipment. You should make sure 
that the audio in your Timeline is not too loud or too soft, and that there isn’t any 
unwanted noise. A simple way to determine if your Timeline audio is too soft is 
to listen to your playback and compare it to another mastered audio source, for 
example, a video playing on a website or music playing in an MP3 application. If, 
by comparison, your Timeline audio is too soft, consider adjusting your Timeline 
audio settings to a higher level. To determine if your Timeline audio is too loud, 
play your Timeline while listening closely with headphones on and pay close atten-
tion to your Audio Meters panel (covered in the next section of this lesson). If you 
hear distortion or if your Audio Meters peak continually into the red indicators, 
your audio is too loud. If this is the case, adjust your Timeline audio settings to a 
higher level.
You also want to ensure that what you are hearing in your Timeline is what end 
users will experience when they hear the finished content. To do this, you must 
work with quality studio monitors (or speakers) and studio headphones to guaran-
tee that your audio sounds the way you want it to under optimal conditions.
Bear in mind that end users may not be using the best equipment, so you should 
also listen to your audio using equipment that is not of the highest quality. For 
example, monitor your audio with inexpensive earbuds that come with an MP3 
player, or perhaps use the internal speakers of a laptop. Consider who your listeners 
are and anticipate their listening environment.
Above all, trust your ears! If you’re hearing anomalies or artifacts, such as distor-
tion or unwanted noise, end users will probably hear them, too. Consider making 
the appropriate adjustments.

256 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
understanding the audio tools in 
adobe Premiere Pro and audition
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 and Adobe Audition CS6 offer optimal tools for editing 
audio, including:
• A redesigned Audio Mixer in Adobe Premiere Pro that gets its new look and 
functionality from Adobe Audition
•
An enhanced Audio Meters panel in Adobe Premiere Pro
•
Easy transfer of audio clips between Adobe Premiere Pro and Audition
•
Noise-removal effects in Audition
Before you do anything in Adobe Premiere Pro, you need to change your workspace, 
set your preferences, and open the Audio Mixer.
Changing your workspace in adobe Premiere Pro
Your workspace is an assortment of panels that displays a graphical representation 
of your controls. Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 comes with a set of preset workspaces 
that were designed to maximize productivity based on certain tasks.
Up until now you’ve been using the workspace for editing. Because you’ll be work-
ing with audio in this lesson, it’s best to change your workspace in Adobe Premiere 
Pro to help streamline your work. To change your workspace, follow these steps.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Audio. 
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace. Click Yes in the 
window that appears.
Notice that by doing this your user interface has changed slightly. Most notably, 
the Audio Mixer panel is now prominent. You’ll explore the Audio Mixer later 
in this lesson.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 257
Let’s add another panel to your workspace.
3 Choose Window > Audio Meters. The Audio Meters panel appears in the 
workspace.
4 Hover your cursor between the Timeline panel and the Audio Meters panel 
until the cursor changes shape. Drag to the left to stretch the Audio Meters 
panel horizontally.

258 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
5 Now scrub your current time indicator (CTI) across the Timeline. Notice that 
if the Audio Meters panel is stretched wider than its height, the green meters 
bounce horizontally, whereas if the height of the Audio Meters panel is longer 
than its width, the meters bounce vertically. This feature allows for very precise 
readings on audio levels.
If you want to adjust the scale of units to yield even more precise measurement 
of volume, right-click on the Auto Meters panel to select from a list of options.
6 Stretch your Audio Meters panel so its height is longer than its width.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 259
verifying your preferences
Your audio monitoring may already be configured properly. However, you should 
verify your preferences to make sure you can hear your audio output from  
Premiere Pro.
Regardless of whether you’re listening to your computer’s sound through studio 
monitors or headphones (or earbuds!), set a preference in Adobe Premiere Pro that 
will use your operating system audio output setting.
1 Choose Premiere Pro > Preferences > Audio Hardware to select your audio 
monitoring device. 
2 Choose your Default Device and click OK.
viewing audio waveforms
An audio waveform is a graphical representation of the frequency and volume of 
an audio clip. Generally, where the graphic is thin, the volume is low, and when the 
graphic is thick, the volume is high. If you play your movie and listen carefully as 
you watch your CTI move across the audio waveform, you can get an idea of when 
sounds occur just by looking at the waveform.

260 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
1 In the Timeline, click the disclosure triangle next to Audio 1 and Audio 2 to 
twirl them open and see the audio waveforms.
2 Zoom in by pressing the equal (=) key on your keyboard (not the numeric keypad).
3 Play the sequence by pressing the spacebar.
This blocky graphic becomes a line that moves up and down over time. This is 
a visual representation of the vibration on the capsule of a microphone when 
recording audio, as well as the vibration of a speaker when playing back audio.
opening the audio mixer
The Audio Mixer panel in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 has a sleek new look that 
provides fast, accurate visual feedback about your audio signal levels and includes 
revamped Mute, Solo, and Record buttons and pan controls, as well as an improved 
channel strip layout. Now, double-clicking a fader returns it to 0dB, and the 
Mixer includes separate decibel level scales for the meters and faders. In addition, 
right-clicking on the Audio Mixer reveals context menus that provide a number of 
options, including the ability to reset the peak level indicators, show valleys at low 
amplitude points, change the displayed decibel range, and choose between dynamic 
peak indicators that update every three seconds or static peak indicators that hold 
the loudest peak until reset or playback is restarted. And—when signal is present—
peak levels are displayed numerically below each meter, giving you precise visual 
feedback about your audio signal levels. Let’s open the Audio Mixer.
E Tip: You can zoom 
in on your Timeline 
pressing the equal (=)  
key. Zoom out by press-
ing the minus (–) key.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 261
1 Press Shift+6 to show your Audio Mixer panel.
2 In your Timeline, click on the CTI and drag it to the right to scrub through  
your sequence.
You’ll see a green line in the audio meters moving up and down at varying 
degrees based on the level of the audio on a given track. 
reset your fader
In a previous lesson, you adjusted the Audio Mixer to temporarily compensate  
for the music audio levels. Later in this lesson, in the section “Audio Clip Editing  
in Premiere Pro,” you’ll perform audio editing operations on track Audio 2 in  
your Timeline
1 Press Shift+6 to show your Audio Mixer panel.
2 Option-click (Alt-click) on the fader icon for Audio 2 to reset it to 0.

lesson 7 Working with Audio
adobe Premiere Pro effects
Just as Adobe Premiere Pro offers many effects for video, it also offers many effects 
for audio. Audio effects can be applied to audio clips in the same way that video 
effects can be applied to video clips in your Timeline, as demonstrated in Lesson 4. 
You can apply the following effects and more:
• Dynamics effect. Provides a set of controls that allow you to adjust audio, 
including Limiter, Compressor, and Expander settings. The dynamics effect is  
a good way to fix problems with audio levels that vary too much.
• Parametric Equalization effect. Allows you to adjust frequencies in relation to 
a Center frequency. This can be used to simulate a more expensive microphone  
or reduce an unwanted hiss from a high frequency.
• Reverb effect. Can apply a simulation of the acoustics of audio playing in  
a room.
• Delay effect. Creates an echo of an audio clip’s sound. This can be useful to 
simulate the sound of an audio clip as if it were played in a cavernous space.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 263
These audio effects, and others, are located in the Effects panel within the Audio 
Effects category.
Track-based effects when applied affect entire tracks and are accessed via the 
Effects and Sends menu in the upper region of the Audio Mixer panel.

264 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
Clip editing vs. track editing
There are two general ways of editing audio during postproduction: clip editing and 
track editing.
Clip editing entails making changes to the audio of a specific audio clip by adjust-
ing its volume, adding an effect, or performing some other operation. You use clip 
editing when you want to make changes to a certain clip and not necessarily to any 
others. Clip editing is common when one clip has a lower or higher volume than 
the other clips on the given track. It can also be useful when noise is present in one 
clip but not others. Adjustments made on the clip level are applied only to the clip’s 
instance on the Timeline and will not affect the master clip. Therefore, by moving  
an instance of a modified clip in the Timeline, any changes applied to it will move 
with it.
track editing entails making changes to an entire track, which applies a second-
ary adjustment to the signal flow of the given track. For instance, by adjusting the 
volume of an audio track, the output level is the compounded volume of the clip(s) 
and then of the track.
When applying automation (i.e., keyframing volume changes over time) to a clip, 
the time-based changes to a clip are attached to the clip regardless of which track or 
where in time the clip exists. Whereas automation applied to a track is independent 
of clips and is fixed to that track regardless of which clips are on that given track. 
Although you can apply keyframes to a clip manually, Automation Modes apply 
keyframes to the track rather than the clip.
audio clip editing in adobe Premiere Pro
Editing audio clips in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 is just as simple and intuitive as 
editing video. Clip volume and duration can be adjusted in the Source Monitor as 
well as in the Timeline.
Now let’s dive into clip editing. You’ll be automating the volume of the music clip 
so that as Joey—the interview subject—speaks, the music volume is reduced but is 
raised when he is not speaking.
In your Afrolicious Promo Edit 04 Timeline, look closely at the Audio 1 track. All of 
the clips in that track have a yellow horizontal line, which indicates a clip’s current 
volume level.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 265
1 Press the Home key to set your CTI to the beginning of your edit.
2 With the Selection tool, click on the yellow line for the music clip in Audio 2,  
and drag downward until your tool tip reads between –3 and –4dB. Notice that 
it’s challenging to achieve a precise result making this adjustment on  
the Timeline.
audio Gain
The term “gain” refers to the input level of a clip or clips, whereas volume refers to 
the output level. You can adjust the gain of a clip using the Audio Gain command, 
which is accessible by selecting one or more audio clips in the Timeline and then 
right-clicking on a clip and choosing Audio Gain from the context menu. By adjust-
ing gain, you are compounding this adjustment with the volume of the clip and the 
track volume. Here are some of the adjustments you can make:
•
set Gain to allows you to set the gain of a clip or clips to a specific value.
•
adjust Gain by allows you to adjust the gain of a clip or clips by a relative 
amount.
•
normalize max Peak to allows you to adjust the peak amplitude of a clip or clips 
to a value below 0dB and all other peaks in the audio will adjust by an amount 
relative to that.
•
normalize all Peaks to allows you to adjust all peaks in the amplitude of a clip 
or clips to a value below 0dB.
•
Peak amplitude indicates the selected clip’s highest dB level.

lesson 7 Working with Audio
3 With the music clip in Audio 2 selected, press Shift+5 to open the Effect 
Controls panel and notice the corresponding volume adjustment for the Level 
property. Here you can set precise values for your volume adjustments. Change 
the Volume Level to –3.0dB. By making this adjustment in the Effect Controls 
panel, Adobe Premiere Pro makes a new keyframe at the current time.
Notice the stopwatch icon next to Level. This is activated by default. If you 
deactivated it, Adobe Premiere Pro would not automatically create new keyframes.
You’ll continue to add keyframes to the Volume Level of the music clip on 
Audio 2 in this fashion. By automating the music clip, you can set different 
adjustments at different points in time so the music doesn’t overpower the 
interview and the music is prominent when there is no interview audio.
4 Advance your CTI to approximately 00:00:01:12. Adjust the Volume Level in  
the Effect Controls panel to –12dB.
5 Play your Timeline from the beginning, listening carefully and noticing that the 
music level is louder at the beginning than it is for the remainder of the clip. 
Also, listen to the interview audio. Stop right after you hear Joey say, “blurring 
lines between audience and performer.”
6 Keep the music clip selected. Go to the Effect Controls panel and set a value of 
–12 for Level by clicking the Add/Remove Keyframe icon.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 267
You could also click the corresponding Add/Remove Keyframe icon in  
the Timeline.
7 Adjust your CTI one second ahead when there is no interview audio and 
only music. Adjust the Level to –3dB. This will make another keyframe at the 
current time.
8 Play back your sequence from the beginning. The music gets louder as Joey 
finishes saying, “audience and performer.”
9 Scrub your CTI to the right until it snaps to the head of the next interview  
audio clip in which Joey says, “Afrolicious began five years ago.” Adjust your  
CTI backward 12 frames.
Let’s make the music softer as Joey begins speaking again.
10 With the music clip selected, click the Add/Remove Keyframe icon next to the 
Level value. Again, this makes a new keyframe using the current value, which 
should be –3dB.
11 Move your CTI forward one second. Adjust the Level to –12, making another 
keyframe with this value.
12 Play back the sequence to hear the music get louder and then softer again. 
As you work through making these volume adjustments, be sure to play back 
your audio and make any adjustments needed to create a seamless audio edit. 
This could mean overlapping volume changes to the music track during the 
beginning and end of the interview segments.
13 Do the next edit on your own so that the music gets louder during the next 
break in the interview audio. Keyframe your music Level between –12dB and 
–3dB over one second to make it louder and then between –3dB and –12dB 
over one second to make it softer.
14 Find the point in your Timeline when the singer at the studio microphone sings 
the line “I can’t listen.” From here, keyframe your music Level from –12 to –3 
over a span of one second.
E Tip: Press 
Shift+right arrow 
to adjust your CTI 
forward five frames. 
Press Shift+left arrow 
to adjust your CTI 
backward five frames.

268 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
15 Advance your CTI forward. Right before Joey says, “My confidence comes 
from the music,” keyframe the music Level over one second between –3dB and 
–12dB. Then as Joey finishes saying, “with that music behind us,” keyframe the 
music Level over one second between –12dB and –3db.
16 Twirl open Audio 3, and select Studio_01.mp4. Move your CTI back to when  
the singer finishes singing “when they tell me.” Go to the Effect Controls panel 
and set a Volume Level keyframe for 0dB at this frame. Advance your CTI 
forward to right before he sings “I can’t make it….” Adjust the Volume Level 
to the lowest possible value, making a keyframe with this value, so that the 
audio for this clip dips down as the music gets louder, thus blending with the 
music track.
17 Press Home to jump to the beginning of your sequence. Press Shift+6 to show 
the Audio Mixer so that you can see the meters. Press the spacebar to play your 
sequence. Notice that the green meters for Audio 2 get higher and lower as the 
Level keyframes for this clip automate upward and downward.
18 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.

audio clip editing in adobe audition
Adobe Audition is a cross-platform, high-performance multitrack audio editor with 
a versatile arsenal of sound-restoration and editing tools, strong integration with 
Adobe Premiere Pro, and dozens of new features, such as real-time clip stretch-
ing, parameter automation, and automatic speech alignment, that increase your 
efficiency and control.
Although you can use Adobe Premiere Pro in the clip editing and finishing stages of 
audio production, you’ll be using Adobe Audition for its more robust and efficient 
tools to resolve issues such as clicks and background noise.
examining clips for distractions
Let’s closely examine the interview and natural audio track to determine what 
needs to be fixed in the sequence Afrolicious Promo Edit 04.
1 In your Adobe Premiere Pro Timeline, mute Audio 2 by clicking its Toggle Track 
Output switch, so that you can listen closely to the interview audio in Audio 1 
and the natural audio in Audio 3. Click Play.
2 Listen closely to when Joey says, “blurring lines.” Immediately after he says that 
is an audible click sound. This is distracting and should be removed.
3 Toward the end of the video is a clip of Joey and the singer sitting in the studio 
(Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4). As Joey says, “We should lay down that vocal,” 
notice that there is an audible low-frequency hum produced by a poorly 
grounded microphone or cable. This noise should also be removed.
For this lesson, you’ll use Adobe Audition to remove the click sound from 
Interview_03.mp4 and the low-frequency hum from Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4.

270 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
sending audio clips from adobe Premiere 
Pro to audition for cleanup
Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to easily send an audio clip to Adobe Audition.
Let’s first work with the Interview_03.mp4 clip. Select that audio clip in your 
Timeline. Right-click on it, and then choose Edit Clip In Adobe Audition.
Adobe Premiere Pro automatically renders this as a .wav file and replaces the 
original audio clip within the Timeline. This new .wav file, Interview_03 Audio 
Extracted.wav, will open in Adobe Audition.
Any changes applied to Interview_03 Audio Extracted.wav in Audition will auto-
matically update in your Adobe Premiere Pro sequence.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 271
understanding the spectral Frequency Display
In Adobe Audition, Interview_03 Audio Extracted.wav will appear in the Editor 
panel. At the top of the Editor panel you’ll see a stereo waveform. Below the 
waveform is the Spectral Frequency Display. It offers a different way of visualizing 
frequencies and volume in the left and right channels of the clip.
E Tip: If you are seeing the waveform but not the Spectral Frequency Display, click the small 
triangle icon at the bottom right of the Editor panel, just above the zoom tools, to reveal the 
horizontal interface divider, which you can then drag upward.
Play the clip and pay close attention to the Spectral Frequency Display. There are 
separate (but in this case, largely identical) spectra for the left and right audio  
channels. Frequency is represented on the vertical axis, whereas amplitude is  
represented by a range of colors and brightness. Notice the range of frequencies 
displayed on the right side of the Spectral Frequency Display. Also, notice that 
louder sounds are represented by yellow and orange areas, whereas softer sounds 
appear red and purple.
As you play the clip a few times, watch the CTI and pay close attention to which 
areas of the spectrum correspond to the sounds you hear. Try to visually isolate 
where the click sound is in the spectrum.

272 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
removing transient sounds using the 
spectral Frequency Display
The click noise that should be removed from Interview_03.mp4 is visible in the 
Spectral Frequency Display as a narrow vertical orange area. You’ll remove it using 
the Lasso tool.
1 From the Tools panel at the top, select the Lasso tool.
2 Adjust your CTI to just before the click sound. Zoom in to the spectrum by 
pressing the equal (=) key several times.
3 Using the Lasso tool, draw around the click sound in the spectrum. Try to 
isolate it without selecting any spectrum of the audio of Joey speaking.
4 Press the Delete key.
Play back the clip from the beginning and verify that the click sound is gone and 
the audible voice frequencies or natural noise floor is still intact.
5 Save your .wav file in Audition by pressing Command+S (Ctrl+S). Then switch 
back to Adobe Premiere Pro.
E Tip: To switch 
between open 
applications, press 
Command+Tab 
(Alt+Tab).

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 273
6 Play your sequence and notice that the changes you saved in Audition are 
indeed applied, and that the click sound has been removed.
removing background noise from your audio
You need to edit one more audio clip in Adobe Audition. Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4 
has a low-frequency hum. This time you can’t simply select and delete an unwanted 
bit of audio. The low-frequency hum is audible throughout and is interlaced with 
frequencies that are essential to keeping the quality of dialogue. To remove it, you 
must select a region of the audio spectrum that represents the room tone, or the 
background noise only, which captures a snapshot of these unwanted frequencies. 
Then you’ll use a noise-removal effect in Adobe Audition. The background noise 
will be removed from the whole clip, leaving the dialogue audio intact.
Based on the edit you currently have in the Timeline, Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4 has 
been tightly trimmed to Joey saying, “Let’s lay down that vocal.” To sample some room 
tone from this clip, you need to temporarily extend the In point of this audio clip.
1 In the Adobe Premiere Pro Timeline, you need to extend the head of the audio 
but not the video of Studio_07-Dialogue.mp4. To do this, hold down the Option 
(Alt) key, and with the Selection tool, click and drag the head of this clip in 
Audio 3 to the left 12 frames.

274 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
2 Now select that audio clip. Right-click on it, and then choose Edit Clip In Adobe 
Audition. Again, you should see its replacement audio clip, Studio_07-Dialogue 
Audio Extracted.wav, open in Adobe Audition.
3 Listen to the audio and find a region of time at the beginning of the clip that is 
only room tone and nobody speaking.
4 You can define your region of selection by setting In and Out points. Adjust 
your CTI to 0.082 seconds and press I to set the In point. Adjust your CTI to 
0.191 seconds and press O to set the Out point.
5 Choose Effect - Noise Reduction Process > Noise Reduction / Restoration > 
Noise Reduction Process.
6 In the Noise Reduction Process window, click the Capture Noise Print button  
to sample the room tone.
7 Now click the Select Entire File button so that any changes you make with the 
sampled room tone will apply to the entire file.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 275
8 Click the Play button at the bottom of the Effect - Noise Reduction window to 
hear the audio with the noise removed.
The Noise Reduction slider controls the percentage of noise reduction in 
the output signal. Fine-tune this setting while previewing audio to achieve 
maximum noise reduction with minimum artifacts. Reduce By determines the 
amplitude reduction of detected noise.
Noise Reduction is a frequency value, whereas Reduce By is a decibel value. 
Basically, you want to capture the frequencies you want to remove while 
maintaining integrity of the frequencies that are integral to the sounds you’d 
like to preserve. It helps to try increasing the Noise Reduction value to the 
point at which the sound degrades. Listen for destructive qualities to the sound 
you’re trying to preserve, and then ease back the value to a nominal threshold 
that sounds good to your ears. Use the Reduce By value to reduce the selected 
frequencies more or less. It is recommended to use the Noise Reduction and 
Reduce By values in an inverse fashion.
Remember that the goal here is not to reduce noise completely, but to reduce it 
so that the speaker is clearer and still sounds natural. There is a balance between 
clarity and overprocessed audio.

276 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
9 Once the noise reduction sounds satisfactory, click Apply.
The Noise Reduction effect offers many capabilities to refine your noise reduction, 
but in most cases you’ll only need to slightly adjust the Noise Reduction and 
Reduce By properties. Again, trust your ears as you identify the optimal balance 
between destructive and effective changes.
10 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your .wav file, and then switch back to 
Adobe Premiere Pro.
11 Now you need to re-trim this audio clip in your Timeline. Hold down the 
Option (Alt) key, and click and drag the In point forward 12 frames, back to  
its original state.
12 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your Adobe Premiere Pro project.

real-time track mixing in adobe 
Premiere Pro and audition
Just as you have keyframed volume changes to clips over time, audio tracks can also be keyframed as well as 
receive real-time automation, so that the volume of an overall track can be increased or decreased regardless of 
which clip or clips are on the Timeline.
Much like other DAWs (digital audio workstations), the Audio Mixer in Adobe Premiere Pro and the Mixer 
in Adobe Audition offer a unique feature to allow users to make these volume changes in real time during 
playback by dragging the fader icon up and down. Although this is a great feature and is useful in some cases, 
this records precise keyframes to the track, yielding a large number of keyframes, which you can manage in the 
Adobe Premiere Pro Audio Preferences under Automation Keyframe Optimization.
To do this, you’ll need to adjust the mode of the track you want to keyframe from Read to Latch, Touch, or Write 
based on the nature of the track automation you want to perform. For music producers and audio engineers, 
this tool works the same as other DAWs. You would play your  
sequence and adjust an Audio Mixer slider in real time to  
generate track keyframes. An audio track in the Timeline  
can show track keyframes instead of clip keyframes simply  
by clicking the Show Keyframes icon in the audio track and  
then choosing Show Track Keyframes from the context menu.

lesson 7 Working with Audio
multitrack mixing and finishing 
in adobe audition
At the point in postproduction when your picture is locked—that is, when the  
edit is complete and no further adjustments to timing will be made—it is stan-
dard procedure to finish the audio mix by balancing levels between tracks and 
maximizing overall amplitude without introducing distortion.
You’ll finish the audio mix in Adobe Audition using its multitrack mixing  
features. You’ll also add a sound effect to the final mix. Then you’ll export a  
final stereo mixdown from Audition and replace the original clip audio with  
the final stereo mixdown in the current Adobe Premiere Pro Timeline.
Let’s send the entire sequence into Audition.
1 In your Adobe Premiere Pro sequence, make sure that all of your audio tracks 
are turned on.
2 In the Project panel, in the Sequences folder, select Afrolicious Promo Edit 04.
3 Choose Edit > Edit in Adobe Audition > Sequence.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 279
4 In the window that appears, select the Export Preview Video check box and 
match the rest of the settings in the following figure. Click OK.
You are exporting preview video with your audio mix so that in Audition you’ll 
have a visual cue for when to insert a sound effect.
Adobe Premiere Pro exports the video and Audition opens showing all of your 
tracks and clips from your Timeline.
Note that a few operations happened automatically. The video track is exported 
as a single video clip that is only for reference in Audition. All audio clips are 
exported as .wav files. These are then brought into an Audition multitrack 
project with all automation keyframes intact and all effects rendered in the 
copied audio clips. All original media remains on your computer and will not  
be affected.
5 Change your Audition workspace to show the video preview. Choose Window >  
Workspace > Edit Audio to Video. Then reset the workspace by choosing 
Window > Workspace > Reset “Edit Audio to Video.” Click Yes.
You’ll first add a sound effect to the final audio mix in Adobe Audition. Then 
you’ll add the sound of a crowd cheering toward the end of the video.
 Note: Exporting 
preview video when 
sending a sequence  
to Adobe Audition  
may result in a long 
render time.

280 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
6 Choose File > Import > File. Navigate to the Audio folder in the Adobe CS6 
Project Assets folder. Select Large Crowd Applause 02.wav and click Open. 
You’ll see this clip in your Files panel.
7 You need to add a new track for the sound effect, so click Multitrack > Track > 
Add New Stereo Audio Track. This new track appears in the Editor panel below 
Audio 3.
8 Click the Video tab near the top left of the interface. This allows you to see the 
edit of the video so that you can synch sounds with visual cues.
9 Adjust the CTI to 00:00:58:13 to when you see Joey on stage smiling at the 
crowd. This moment would be good for the crowd applause to be heard.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 281
10 Drag the file Large Crowd Applause 02.wav into the Editor panel in the new 
audio track. Press V to activate the Move tool. Click on the Large Crowd 
Applause 02 clip in the Editor panel so that its head snaps to the CTI.
11 Now you’ll need to trim the tail of the sound effect clip. Adjust your CTI to 
00:01:07:15, right before the last four bass notes in the music. With the Move 
tool, click and drag the bottom-right corner of the Large Crowd Applause 02 
clip until the tail of the clip snaps to the CTI.
12 A yellow horizontal line indicates this clip’s volume. With the Move tool, click 
and drag this yellow line to –12dB.
The Zoom tools at the bottom of the Editor panel can be used to expand the 
tracks horizontally or vertically, making it easier to adjust volume or make  
time-based edits.

282 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
13 Now let’s fade the clip in and out. Select the clip and choose Clip > Fade In > 
Fade In. Choose Clip > Fade Out > Fade Out.
14 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your Audition session. Name your file 
Afrolicious Promo Final Audio Mix.sesx and save it in the default location. 
Click OK.
Dynamic and condenser microphones
There are two basic types of microphones: dynamic and condensor.
Dynamic microphones are typically used on stage or in noisy environments. 
Dynamic microphones are more durable and usually cheaper than condenser 
microphones and do not require their own power source.
Condensor microphones are of higher quality and more expensive. They are often 
used for voice-over and music recording in controlled, noise-proof environments. 
They are highly sensitive and thus susceptible to background noise, or other noises 
like breathing or nearby traffic. Condensor microphones require their own power 
source.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 283
recording and editing a voice-over
Dialogue can come from many different sources, including 
on-camera interviews and candid moments captured between 
subjects. It’s common in cases like these for the quality of the 
audio to be compromised in favor of capturing good video. If 
you don’t intend to use video and only need a voice track to 
move the story forward, Adobe Premiere Pro and Audition can 
be used to capture a voice-over.
To do this, you’ll need a microphone with a digital connection to 
your host system. This could be as simple as a USB microphone 
and a laptop, or as complex as a multichannel audio interface 
with analog microphone pre-amps and analog-to-digital 
converters. It’s best to use a cardioid condensor microphone. 
You’ll also need a set of headphones to monitor while record-
ing and a quiet space. Configure your audio device in the audio 
hardware preferences in Adobe Premiere Pro or Audition. You 
may also have to adjust settings in the audio preferences for 
your computer’s audio hardware. For example, a Mac user may 
have to select the specified audio device in the input and out-
put settings in the System Preferences for sound. Once you’ve 
configured your device, add a new empty audio track in your 
sequence and record-enable the selected track in the Audio 
Mixer. Then click the Record button in the Transport controls of 
the Audio Mixer.
You can edit voice-over in either Adobe Premiere Pro or 
Audition, depending on your needs for sophisticated editing 
tools and effects. Editing a voice-over in Adobe Premiere Pro is 
performed in much the same way as editing a video clip, and 
edits can be made in the Timeline or Source panels.

284 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
audio track editing in adobe audition
Now it’s time to do the final multitrack mix. To reiterate, applying changes to a 
track affects the entire audio output of that track. You’ll apply an effect to the music 
track as well as to the interview track. Then you’ll apply an effect to the Master 
track, which will affect the output of all tracks.
1 Select track Audio 2. Choose Effects > Filter and EQ > Parametric Equalizer to 
open the Rack Effect window. Set Presets to Loudness Maximizer. This preset 
will boost the low and high frequencies, leaving the midrange frequencies 
between 100 Hz and 4 kHz (the frequency range of the human voice) unchanged.
2 Close the Parametric Equalizer window.
3 Select track Audio 1. Rather than use the menu, this time click the Effects Rack 
panel tab to access it. 
You’ll see several empty rows with a number on the left and triangle icons on 
the right. These rows represent slots where audio effects would appear as a list.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 285
4 Click the first triangle icon and a menu will appear. From the menu choose 
Filter and EQ > Parametric Equalizer. It will show as the first effect in the rack.
5 In the Rack Effect – Parametric Equalizer window that appears, set the Preset 
to Vocal Enhancer. This preset enhances the vocal range of audio frequencies by 
making a subtle increase to frequencies associated with the human voice while 
reducing unwanted frequencies so that the resulting vocal sounds are audible 
and clear. Close the Parametric Equalizer window.

286 
lesson 7 Working with Audio
6 Select the Master track in the Editor panel. Choose Effects > Amplitude and 
Compression > Hard Limiter. In the Rack Effect window, set the Preset to Limit 
to –.1dB to ensure that audio in the entire mix is at maximum loudness without 
clipping or distortion. Close this window.
7 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your Audition session.
Creating the final audio mix
The final task you want to do in Audition is export the final audio mix.
1 Choose File > Export > Multitrack Mixdown > Entire Session.
2 In the Export Multitrack Mixdown window, name your file name Afrolicious 
Promo Final Audio Mix_mixdown.wav. Set Location to the Lesson 07 folder.
3 You’ll need to change the Sample Type so that your sample rate is 48 kHz, the 
standard for audio and video production. Click the Change button to the right  
of the Sample Type values.
4 In the Convert Sample Type window, 
click the Presets menu and choose 
Resample to 48000 Hz.
5 Click OK to close the Convert Sample 
Type window. Click OK again to 
close the Export Multitrack Mixdown 
window.
 Note: Limiting refers 
to setting a maximum 
audio output threshold. 
With limiting applied, 
no clip in a track can 
be louder than this set 
volume.

the basics of color correction
Before rendering and outputting a final movie, it is standard procedure to spend 
some time adjusting the color in your video. You should do this to ensure that  
all video clips in a given sequence are consistent in terms of hue, saturation,  
and brightness. 
Color correction is also a very important step in meeting broadcast standards. 
Color correction may involve a variety of processes. The most common is white 
balancing. White balancing is the process of adjusting the hue of a video so that  
any object in a shot that appears white in reality also appears white in the video. 
This is often necessary if lighting exposure was miscalculated during production. 
Many color-correcting tools include white balancing controls as well as saturation 
and contrast controls.
Similar tools for color correction may be used in the process of color grading to 
achieve stylistic adjustments to hue, saturation, and brightness.
Color grading entails selectively adjusting the color of a video using masks and 
color-correcting tools to enhance the colors that were captured in-camera. This is 
done to draw attention to specific subjects in frame and further evoke the desired 
emotional tone of a story.

lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
For example, color grading can be used to colorize a sequence to make it appear as  
though it was shot on old film stock or to make a scene that was shot during the day  
appear to take place during twilight. Color grading can be a simple process driven by  
presets, or it can be a complex set of operations that is artistic and highly technical.
using color-correction techniques 
in adobe Premiere Pro
Adobe Premiere Pro comes equipped with a variety of color-correction tools and 
effects that will serve the needs of most projects.
In this exercise, you’ll learn the basics of using the YC Waveform monitor in Adobe 
Premiere Pro CS6 as well as how to perform simple color correcting with the 
Three-Way Color Corrector effect.
Before you start color-correcting the clips in Adobe Premiere Pro, it is recom-
mended that you change your workspace so the related panels are showing in your 
Adobe Premiere Pro interface.
setting up for color correction
Adobe Premiere Pro, along with the other applications in Adobe CS6 Production 
Premium, comes with preset workspaces so that you can quickly change your user 
interface without having to open all of the relevant panels manually. By enabling a 
workspace, the relevant panels are placed for you automatically.
There are workspaces in Adobe Premiere Pro for various tasks, including one for 
color correction.
1 Change your Adobe Premiere Pro workspace by choosing Window >  
Workspace > Color Correction.
You want your user interface to correspond to the instructions in this lesson, so 
you’ll reset your Color Correction workspace to its default setting in case the 
workspace had been modified on your system.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 295
2 Reset this workspace by choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Current 
Workspace, and then click Yes.
3 At the bottom right of the interface, you should see a Reference panel. You want 
to bring up the YC Waveform monitor in this panel. Click the wrench icon at 
the top right of the Reference panel and choose YC Waveform from the menu.
using the YC Waveform
The YC Waveform displays a graph showing the signal intensity in the video clip. 
The horizontal axis of the graph corresponds to the video image (from left to 
right), and the vertical axis is the signal intensity in units called IRE (named for the 
Institute of Radio Engineers).
The YC Waveform displays luminance information as a green waveform. Bright 
objects produce a waveform pattern (bright green areas) near the top of the graph; 
darker objects produce a waveform toward the bottom. Generally, luminance and 
chroma values should be about the same and distributed evenly across the 7.5 to 
100 IRE range.
The YC Waveform also displays chrominance information as a blue waveform.  
The chrominance information is overlaid on the luminance waveform.

296 
lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
When you scrub through your Timeline, you should see that the luminance of all 
of the shots fall within this broadcast-safe range. In projects that use raw media 
with extended dynamic range, the footage may not be broadcast safe and the editor 
would need to spend considerable time color correcting it. However, in this lesson 
you’ll be using the YC Waveform monitor to make sure that any color corrections 
that you apply to the clips do not cause the luminance of these clips to fall outside 
the broadcast-safe range.
using scopes to monitor  
color information
Several different scopes are built into Adobe Premiere Pro, aside from the YC 
Waveform. Among them are the RGB Parade, YCbCr Parade, and Vectorscope. Each 
one has a different way of displaying color information, and each has a different 
usage. Like the YC Waveform, the RGB Parade and YCbCr Parade scopes display a 
rectangular grid with waveform information, whereas the Vectorscope is character-
ized by a circular chart:
•
RGB Parade. In this chart the distribution of the three cardinal colors of light is 
represented by three respective waveforms. The red, green, and blue patterns 
indicate the levels of each color channel that make up the image. Ascending on 
the vertical axis is the value of the color, and the horizontal axis corresponds to 
the position on the image. You use this scope to visualize the presence of each 
color from left to right. For example, an image that is grayscale will show all 
three charts with the same waveform pattern, because in the absence of color 
all RGB patterns are identical.
•
YCbCr Parade. This chart displays three distinct waveforms, each indicating 
a different relationship between color and luminance levels. The first of the 
three is a cyan graph that simply tracks the overall luminance in the image. The 
middle chart in magenta represents the blue minus luma, and the yellow chart 
on the right indicates the red minus luma.
•
Vectorscope. This scope displays the distribution of chrominance in an image. 
The positions of each point on the scope are determined by two variables: hue 
and saturation. The saturation of the color is displayed on the Vectorscope by 
the distance of a point from the center, and the direction, or angle, of the point 
indicates the hue on the color wheel. An image populated by vibrant colors will 
produce a pattern farther out from the center, whereas more bleak colors will 
appear closer to the center of the chart.
Note that the YC Waveform is the only scope that indicates the broadcast-safe 
threshold for luminance. The horizontal dotted line positioned at 7.5 IRE is the lower 
limit, meaning that if any part of an image falls below that line, it is too dark for 
broadcast and should be adjusted accordingly. If an image peaks above the 100 IRE 
mark, it also must be corrected before it can be broadcasted as it was intended to 
be viewed.

Warm and cool colors
Common light sources—for example, household incandescent bulbs, candlelight, 
halogen, tungsten, and direct sunlight—all have different color temperatures on 
a spectrum from “warm” to ”cool.” Lower color temperatures like 2800 Kelvin (K) 
appear warm, or contain more oranges and reds, whereas higher temperatures 
like 5800K appear cool with a higher concentration of blue tones. In the event that 
a video wasn’t properly white balanced at the time of recording, the colors in the 
image might appear different from how they would look naturally—either too 
warm or too cool—and what you would naturally perceive as gray instead appears 
orange or blue, respectively.
Unfortunately, due to the fact that almost all video systems record compressed 
video (with the rare exception of raw file formats, such as R3D), attempts to perform 
white balance color correction in postproduction will not yield perfect results 100 
percent of the time. However, tools like the Three-Way Color Corrector effect can 
make a phenomenal improvement to clips that have an unpleasant color cast over 
the scene.
using the three-Way Color Corrector
Next, you’ll do some white balancing to the video clips of the inside of Joey’s 
recording studio because these shots appear a bit too warm—that is, the hue of the 
colors in the shot is a bit too orange/yellow—and could use a bit of overall bright-
ening. Select the second of these shots, Studio_04.mp4. The clip shows Joey’s hands 
on a synthesizer keyboard.
1 Press Shift+7 to access the Effects panel. In the Effects panel search field, type 
three to find the effect called Three-Way Color Corrector. Double-click on the 
effect to apply it to the selected clip in your Timeline.

2 Press Shift+5 to access the Effect Controls panel and look at the controls for the 
Three-Way Color Corrector.
the three-Way Color Corrector effect
The redesigned Three-Way Color Corrector effect in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 makes 
precise color work directly inside Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 easier than it’s ever been. 
Key elements in the effect’s interface have been enhanced and repositioned, expos-
ing essential controls the moment you apply the Three-Way Color Corrector to a clip 
and open the Effect Controls panel.
The Three-Way Color Corrector effect is also GPU-accelerated, so when you have a 
supported NVIDIA or AMD graphics card in your system, you can view results in real 
time as you work. And thanks to the enhanced Mercury Playback Engine, the new 
Uninterrupted Playback feature lets you make color corrections while your footage 
plays. Although this can be used on even the most challenging of color-correction 
jobs, you’ll use it for some subtle and simple changes.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 299
3 Adjust your CTI to Studio_04.mp4. This clip just needs a bit of brightening. 
In the Three-Way Color Corrector effect controls, you’ll see a slider for Input 
Levels, which has a black slider handle on the left, a white slider handle on the 
right, and a gray slider handle in the middle. Adjust the white slider to the right, 
keeping an eye on the Program Monitor to see the changes. You should notice 
that the clip now appears brighter overall. While making the adjustments, also 
look at the YC Waveform monitor to make sure that the luminance peak doesn’t 
go higher than 100 IRE.
When color correcting, it’s also important to maintain consistency and 
continuity in your edit. If you’re color correcting a clip that shows the same 
location or intended lighting conditions as other clips in your edit, make sure 
that the color correcting you do doesn’t make the shots look different in terms 
of brightness, contrast, and color hue.
4 Adjust your current time indicator (CTI) to show the previous shot,  
Studio_03.mp4. Is there color consistency between these two shots? Adjust  
the input sliders on the Three-Way Color Corrector effect on Studio_04.mp4 
until the lighting of the shots match.
5 When you’re done, scrub the CTI in your Timeline ahead to clip Studio_06.mp4,  
and select the clip. Notice how this shot is a bit warmer in hue than the previous 
studio shots. You can use the Three-Way Color Corrector effect again but this 
time to apply white balancing.
6 Press Shift+7 to access the Effects panel. Your previous search results should 
still be visible. If not, type three in the Effects panel search field to find the 
Three-Way Color Corrector effect. Double-click on the effect to apply it to the 
selected clip in your Timeline.
7 Press Shift+5 to access the Effect Controls panel. Notice the three color wheels 
in the Three-Way Color Corrector: one for Shadows, one for Midtones, and 
one for Highlights. Each has its own eyedropper color sampler. You can achieve 
white balance in a clip with this effect by using the Highlights eyedropper 
to sample an area in frame that is pure white or close to pure white. White 
balancing can be enhanced by using the Shadows eyedropper to sample an area 
in frame that is pure black or close to pure black.
8 Use the Highlights eyedropper to sample an area in Studio_06.mp4 that is close 
to pure white, such as a white area on the computer monitor. Use the Shadows 
eyedropper to sample an area in frame that is close to pure black, such as the 
black outer frame of the computer monitor or the black speaker hanging on 
the wall in the background of the shot. Use the Midtones eyedropper to sample 
an area in frame that is of medium luminance, such as the singer’s beige shirt. 
Adjust the middle slider under Input Levels to the right to brighten the shot a 
bit and match the other Studio clips in the sequence.

Color Finesse in adobe after effects
There may be instances when you’ll be working primarily in After Effects, not Adobe Premiere Pro, in which case 
it might suit your workflow to do your color correcting in After Effects. The Synthetic Aperture Color Finesse 
plug-in included with After Effects has excellent color-correction tools, including waveform and vectorscope 
monitors, histograms, tone curves, and levels adjustments. Even if they are working predominantly in Adobe 
Premiere Pro, many editors prefer this self-contained, color-correction tool, because it is accompanied by the 
host of tools in After Effects and offers some advantages over the color-correction effects in Adobe Premiere Pro.
For instance, Color Finesse has its own separate full interface with built-in vectorscopes and waveform moni-
tors. Color Finesse can measure and control colors with Hue/Saturation/Lightness settings, Red/Green/Blue 
settings, and even Cyan/Magenta/Yellow settings for easy conversion of print color values to video color values. 
Histogram and curves controls are also in Color Finesse, giving users options between color controls they may 
already be familiar with from working in Photoshop Extended. In fact, Color Finesse even allows users to import 
curve color control presets from Photoshop Extended to allow their video colors to maintain consistency with 
colors in their still images, which the RGB Curves effect in Adobe Premiere Pro cannot do.
9 To see the subtle changes that you’ve made to this shot, click the “Toggle 
the effect on or off” button for the Three-Way Color Corrector in the Effect 
Controls panel. Make sure that this button is left on after reviewing.
10 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.

about speedGrade
Adobe SpeedGrade is a high-end, color-grading application that is a recent addi-
tion to the Adobe Creative Suite of applications. Adobe SpeedGrade lets you 
handle technical grading tasks like matching shots and creating consistent color 
across a scene. The GPU-accelerated, 64-bit LumetriTM Deep Color Engine deliv-
ers real-time playback as you grade footage regardless of its resolution or frame 
size. SpeedGrade supports file-based workflows and includes support for raw and 
high dynamic range (HDR) footage. HDR support retains the bit-depth of your 
image files, whereas the ability to work directly with raw images—recorded straight 
from the camera sensor—lets you pull details from blacks and highlights that might 
otherwise have been crushed or blown out.
Adobe SpeedGrade does not yet Dynamically Link with other Adobe applications, 
but it will in future releases.
using color-correction presets in speedGrade 
Color grading is a specialized skill that requires knowledge of advanced color- 
compositing techniques. This book will not explore SpeedGrade’s more advanced 
features, but we’ll briefly cover how to take advantage of one of its simpler features, 
applying a Look preset to a clip. Get ready to do that now!
1 In your Adobe Premiere Pro Project panel, in the Live folder, find the clip 
Live_06.mp4. Double-click this clip to display it in the Viewer. Play the clip to 
see how it looks without a color correction adjustment.
2 With this clip selected, go back to the Project panel and choose File > Send to 
Adobe SpeedGrade. A file navigation window opens.
3 Navigate to the Lesson 08 folder, and then click Save.
A progress bar window appears as Adobe Premiere Pro renders out all of the 
frames in this clip as .dpx image files. SpeedGrade will open automatically.
32-bit color
Many of the color-correction effects in CS6 are able to take advantage of ultra high 
precision 32-bit color. A huge step up from 24-bit “true color,” 32-bit “deep color” 
is capable of producing over a billion different colors as compared to true color’s 
roughly 16 million. In the Color Correction window (Effects > Color Correction) you’ll 
notice that several effects display an icon with the number 32 to the right. This 
means that Adobe Premiere Pro processes an incredibly very rich color depth while 
performing the specified effect, allowing editors to feel confident that their color 
correction is not hurting the original image or creating unwanted artifacts.

4 Once in SpeedGrade, you’ll encounter a user interface that looks different when 
compared to the other applications in the Adobe Creative Suite. Click the 
Monitor tab at the top of the interface to see the clip you’ll be working on.
Below the Monitor is a row of Transport buttons, a Timeline, and a row of tabs 
that allow you to view and apply various settings.
5 In the Timeline, click on the gray bar that represents the video clip.
6 Click the Look tab. You should see a row of buttons labeled Overall, Shadows, 
Midtones, and Highlights. Choosing one of these buttons determines which 
range of color luminance you want to affect. Leave Overall highlighted.
At the bottom of the Look panel is a row of tabs for preset Look Examples that 
includes Cinematic, Desaturation, Style, and Temperature.
7 Choose any one of the preset Look Examples, and then select any preset within. 
To apply the chosen preset, you must press Return (Enter).
These presets are a series of color correction adjustments saved into presets and 
can be applied to a shot to achieve a specific look. Using presets saves you time 
and you don't need to make multiple adjustments manually. 
Now you need to output your clip from SpeedGrade. You’ll also need to do 
an intermediate render, because SpeedGrade does not yet Dynamically Link 
objects in its Timeline with Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects.
 Note: Luminance 
values of any video 
frame can be broken 
down to three 
categories. Darkest 
regions are shadow 
areas, brightest 
are highlights, and 
everything in between 
is midtone range.

8 At the top right of the interface, click the Output tab to see all of the  
Output settings.
9 You need to tell SpeedGrade where to save your rendered frames. In the Folder 
settings, click the arrow to the right of the Desktop icon to show a folder 
navigation menu that will list the hard drives on your system. Choose the hard 
drive where your Adobe CS6 Project Assets folder is, and then continue clicking 
the arrow icons to the right as you navigate deeper into your system’s folder 
structure until you reach the folder Live_06 Media in the Lesson 08 folder.
10 Name the file Live_06_cc, and set the Format & Options to TGA (no alpha).
11 Click Render to render a new .tga image sequence. Doing this will render a .tga 
image file for every frame in the clip, and you’ll end up with many .tga images, 
all numbered chronologically according to their order of appearance in the clip.

using a clip from speedGrade in adobe Premiere Pro
Next, you’ll import your rendered .tga image sequence to Adobe Premiere Pro and 
perform a couple of simple operations so that you can use it to replace a clip that’s 
in your Timeline.
Importing and interpreting an image sequence
To begin, follow these steps to import the sequence:
1 Switch back to Adobe Premiere Pro. Choose File > Import. Navigate to the 
Live_06 Media folder, and select the first frame that you rendered from 
SpeedGrade, Live_06_cc0000.tga. At the bottom of the Import window, select 
the Image Sequence check box and click Import.
2 The new clip appears in your Project panel. If you had any item in the Live bin 
selected, this .tga sequence will be put in the Live bin.
For any clip that you import to your Adobe Premiere Pro project, you want to 
make sure that its native frame rate matches the frame rate of the sequence that 
you would put it in.
Look at the Frame Rate column in the Project panel to confirm that, indeed, the 
imported .tga sequence has a frame rate of 29.97 fps.
3 Your edited sequence, however, has a frame rate of 23.976 fps. Confirm this by 
selecting your Timeline panel and then choosing Sequence > Sequence Settings.
 Note: Do not get 
confused between an 
image sequence and an 
edited sequence in your 
Premiere Pro project. 
This lesson uses the 
term “sequence” to refer 
to both, but they are 
not the same.
E Tip: Press 
Command+Tab (Alt+ 
Tab) to switch between 
open applications.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 305
4 In the Sequence Settings window, confirm your sequence’s frame rate at the top.
5 Click OK at the bottom of the Sequence Settings window to close it.
6 For your imported .tga sequence to conform to the different frame rate on your 
edit, you must modify it so that Adobe Premiere Pro interprets its frame rate as 
some rate different from its actual frame rate. Right-click on it in your Project 
panel, and then choose Modify > Interpret Footage.
7 In the Modify Clip dialog, select “Assume this frame rate,” and then enter 
23.976 in the field next to it. Click OK.
replacing a clip in your timeline with a different source
Using a simple shortcut, you can replace a clip in your Timeline with a different clip 
in your Project panel. Any effects that are applied to the original clip are retained 
on the replacement clip.
1 Double-click Live_06_cc0000.tga in your Project panel to open it in the Viewer, 
and then play it to verify that the Look preset in SpeedGrade was rendered 
properly. Next, you’ll replace a clip in your Timeline with this clip.

2 Scrub through your timeline and find the clip Live_06.mp4 on track Video 2. 
Select this clip.
3 Hold down the Option (Alt) key as you click on the video frame in the Source 
Monitor, and then drag into your Timeline.
This exercise was intended as a brief exposure to applying a preset to a clip in 
SpeedGrade. Because the color graded clip may not match the look and feel  
of the rest of your edited sequence, let’s remove it.
4 Press Command+Z (Ctrl+Z) to undo the clip replacement. Then select  
Live_06_cc0000.tga in your Project panel and press Delete.
sending a sequence from adobe 
Premiere Pro to speedGrade
It’s possible to send an entire sequence to SpeedGrade by clicking a sequence icon 
in the Project panel and choosing File > Send to Adobe SpeedGrade. This com-
mand first exports a .dpx sequence for all of the source media found in the selected 
sequence and then shows all clips in a corresponding Timeline in SpeedGrade. 
Using this method creates a new copy of the media, which occupies hard drive 
space. Alternatively, SpeedGrade supports the import of edit decision lists (EDLs) 
and thus allows you to apply color grading to instances of the original media with-
out doing an intermediate render.
To create an EDL, select the sequence in your Project panel, and then choose File > 
Export > EDL. To import this EDL to SpeedGrade, click the Open SpeedGrade project 
icon at the top left of the interface, change the session type from Composition files 
to EDL Conform files, navigate to where your EDL file is, select it, and then click Open.
understanding compression and 
other factors for exporting files
When exporting a sequence, it is important to bear in mind the way you intend 
to share or broadcast the media, for example, whether you want to upload it to a 
streaming website or burn it to a DVD or Blu-ray Disc. The codec used to compress 
the video, the frame rate, and file size are all factors that need to be accounted for 
when exporting. 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 307
Compression
An infinite number of colors exist in light, but only so many can be captured by 
video cameras and represented on monitors. Because light carries such an incred-
ibly unwieldy amount of visual information, it will always need to be compressed 
before it is practical for viewing and distributing as digital media content. To that  
effect, the highest quality that a video file can be is the quality of the initially captured 
and compressed source file. To understand video compression, you’ll focus on the 
exporting stage of media: from the editing platform to a self-contained media file. 
Through an understanding of how and why compression works, you can control 
the balance between the quality and size of your media, and also avoid unwanted 
outcomes in the process of exporting. Video compression is the process of com-
pacting sound and image information, whether compressing it as a lossless file (no 
loss of quality from original) or a lossy file (some loss of image and sound quality).
During the process of editing footage in applications such as Adobe Premiere 
Pro and After Effects, the video does not undergo any compression in addition 
to the compression that inevitably occurred in-camera. Compression only occurs 
when the video is rendered or exported. When you export a video using lossless 
compression, the file experiences only “data compression,” a process of analyzing 
and eliminating redundancies on the binary level. It does not experience “image 
compression,” or a visible deterioration from the original quality. A lossless export 
yields a very large file size that is unwieldy for web sharing, yet is an essential part 
of rendering a master copy for screening, or for subsequent stages of compression 
in a variety of formats. It is important to note that you cannot improve the original 
quality of footage (create information) by any conventional methods; however, you 
can create information by adding graphics and effects.
Lossy compression, on the other hand, squeezes the sound and image information 
for more practical file sizes. When you export a video using H.264 or MPEG-4, 
you lose a certain amount of information but in varying degrees depending on the 
settings. Lossy, like lossless, puts the source files through routine data compres-
sion to conform the video to a self-contained file. Unlike lossless, however, lossy 
compression is also characterized by image compression. For example, a lossless 
image will store information for each pixel of each frame uniquely, whereas a lossy 
video export (depending on the amount that it is compressed) might lump clusters 
of color data together to make them easier to store and thus allow for a smaller file 
size. For example, instead of saving a multitude of different magenta hues as sepa-
rate pieces of information, it may analyze them and decide to attribute them to the 
same color value, forever discarding the subtle differences between the unique col-
ors to reduce the amount of memory needed to store the information. Depending 
on the codec, it may also compress across time, meaning that certain regions of the 
frame retain the same information over a series of frames. During lossy compres-
sion, the video codec analyzes the frame and compacts the information for play-
back and sharing convenience.
 Note: When 
evaluating the best 
settings to use when 
performing a lossy 
export, it is good 
practice to consider 
the file format at which 
it was captured to 
minimize unnecessary 
compression.

lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
Format 
As the demand increases for higher-quality video at quicker loading speeds, indus-
tries develop video format standards to continuously improve the way that digital 
video is viewed and shared. Different codecs and file formats use different methods 
to store color and light information. A standard video compression is H.264, which 
is used for web streaming on sites such as YouTube and Vimeo. It is the standard 
compression used in Blu-ray media and is the format that many HD video cameras 
natively record to, such as several of the latest DSLR models. In most cases, export-
ing in H.264 is ideal because of its versatility and quality in relation to its file size. 
Frame rates 
A video’s frame rate is indicative of the number of frames that are displayed 
sequentially during one second. For example, at a typical frame rate of 30 fps, 30 
still images are projected in rapid succession in the duration of one second. Thirty 
frames per second has become the standard NTSC speed for video in DVD and 
online media, which was changed to 29.97 fps, because of a slight change in broad-
cast frequency to account for FM interference. The typical frame rate used in film 
cameras is 24 fps, which is the frame rate that many videographers choose to shoot 
at to emulate the consistency of film. When exporting video it is important to note 
the frame rate at which the video was originally shot, or else the export might have 
choppy playback.
File size 
When exporting a video, one of the most important variables you want to control 
is the file size of the exported file. For instance, a normal DVD is capable of storing 
only 4.7 GB of information, and YouTube recommends a file size of 2 GB or less. If 
you want your video to load quickly, it needs to be relatively smaller than either of 
these examples. An easy way of controlling the size of the video file is to manually 
set the bitrate of the export in the Video tab at the bottom right side of the Adobe

video in proportion to your target file size when evaluating the best bitrate to use.
exporting the final output with 
adobe Premiere Pro
After editing your video, creating a motion graphic, finalizing your audio mix, 
and doing some color correcting, you’re ready to export your sequence as a movie 
file. Before you dive into the finer details of rendering, you’ll export the sequence 
directly from Adobe Premiere Pro using simple presets.

1 With the Afrolicious Promo Final Color Correction sequence in the Timeline 
panel, choose File > Export > Media to open the Export Settings window.
E  Tip: Press Command+M (Ctrl+M) to export media from Premiere Pro.
As its name suggests, this window allows you to apply settings to export your 
sequence in a range of file formats, frame rates, frame sizes, and video and 
audio compression settings. You can configure all of these settings manually, or 
you could choose from a list of presets. Let’s use presets for this simple render.
2 At the top right under Export Settings, choose H.264 from the list of presets 
in the Format menu. Choose HD 720p 23.976 from the Preset menu. Click on 
the filename next to Output Name, and name your output Afrolicious Promo 
Final. Navigate to the Exports folder (Adobe CS6 Project Assets > Exports) and 
click Save.
3 Without changing anything else, click Export at the bottom of the Export 
Settings window.
 Note: See  
Lesson 1 for more 
details on H.264.

lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
An Encoding window appears with a progress bar that shows how much time 
remains for the render to finish.
Because the movie is just over one minute in duration, this render shouldn’t take 
very long. That said, render times will vary depending on the speed of your com-
puter’s processor(s), how much RAM is installed in your computer, and whether 
or not your computer has a supported graphics card for the Mercury Graphics 
Engine, among other factors.
When your render is finished, you’ll find the Afrolicious Promo Final.mp4 movie 
file in the Exports folder on your computer’s hard drive. You should be able  
to open this file with the Apple QuickTime player or other supported media  
player software.
This movie file was rendered using a preset for web video compression. But what 
if you wanted to render your Adobe Premiere Pro sequence as an archival quality 
copy plus other versions using different export settings without having to render  
them one at a time directly from Adobe Premiere Pro? That’s when you’d use 
Adobe Media Encoder CS6.
the .mp4 file type
The .mp4 video format is a cross-platform standard that can be played back on 
nearly every type of device, from Mac to Windows and Linux operating systems, 
streaming websites, and even among an array of mobile and multimedia devices. 
An integral component of the widespread H.264 format, .mp4 is ideal for many 
types of usage.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 311
about adobe media encoder
Adobe Media Encoder (AME) CS6 is a separate, 64-bit software application that 
saves you time by automating the process of creating multiple encoded versions of 
source files, Adobe Premiere Pro sequences, and After Effects compositions. The 
new Preset Browser, improved batch-encoding performance, more new presets, 
and user interface enhancements in Adobe Media Encoder CS6 make outputting 
your work to multiple formats and devices a faster, more intuitive process.
Adobe Media Encoder CS6 has a new yet familiar “panelized” user interface like 
that of Adobe Premiere Pro and other Adobe Creative Suite applications. For 
example, you can group panels in frames; position, size, and float panels and frames 
to your liking; and save workspace configurations.

312 
lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
using ame across the suite
AME is the central encoding tool used in the Adobe CS6 Production Premium Suite. 
You’ll discover that it is very helpful for video editing tasks, such as:
•
Exporting final sequences
•
Batch transcoding of raw clips
•
Batch compression of master files
•
Encoding files that are put in a predesignated watch folder which is a directory 
that's specified to be polled periodically by an encoding platform for new content. 
When new content arrives, the system will pull the file and convert it to the type 
of video you have requested.
•
Uploading an exported file to an FTP server
rendering master files
It’s a good idea as an editor to have a final export of your edit that could serve as 
the master file that other copies can be made from. Simply by copying this master 
file, you can easily and quickly make other copies without having to do all of the 
raw rendering for each, particularly if your sequence requires a long render.
Therefore, your master file should be of the highest possible quality, because a  
master file cannot make copies that are of higher image quality than itself. Once 
image quality of a movie file is lost as a result of data compression or reduction in 
frame size, it cannot be regained. And, in a worst-case scenario, if your raw project 
files get lost or corrupted, you would at least have your master movie file.
In this exercise, you’ll render a master file of your final Adobe Premiere Pro 
sequence, but this time you’ll use Adobe Media Encoder CS6. You’ll also render 
other versions of your movie—one for mobile devices and one for the web— 
using AME.
1 In Adobe Premiere Pro, with the Afrolicious Promo Final Color Correction 
sequence in the Timeline, choose File > Export > Media. The Export Settings 
window appears. Let’s create a preset for minimal data and image compression, 
and no audio compression.
2 Under Export Settings, choose QuickTime from the Format menu. QuickTime 
is an industry-standard movie file format that is compatible with most 
nonlinear editing systems, including Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.
If you are using a Windows system, you must have the QuickTime Player 
installed to export QuickTime files from AME. To download the QuickTime 
Player go to http://support.apple.com/downloads/#quicktime.
 Note: If you want to 
export using QuickTime 
for Windows, you'll need 
to purchase the Pro 
version of QuickTime.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 313
3 In the Video tab below Export Settings, set Video Codec to Animation. 
The Animation codec applies minimal compression to the movie’s file size  
and to its image quality, thereby making it suitable for yielding a master file.  
Be warned, however, that because of minimal compression, the output file size 
will be huge.
4 Under Basic Video Settings, uncheck the box next to the Width and Height 
dimensions to unlock their proportions. Set Width to 1280 and Height to 720. 
These dimensions denote the frame size of the rendered movie, which you want 
to be no smaller than your sequence frame size in Adobe Premiere Pro.
5 Set Frame Rate to 23.976. Again, this was the frame rate in your Adobe Premiere 
Pro sequence, and you want to maintain that.
6 Set Aspect to Square Pixels (1.0). This refers to whether or not the pixels would 
be stretched horizontally to meet certain video broadcast standards.
7 Click the Audio tab to access all of the Audio Export settings. Set Audio Codec 
to Uncompressed. Set Sample Rate to 48000 Hz, Channels to Stereo, and 
Sample Size to 16bit. These are all standard settings for audio in a movie file 
that yields optimum quality. 
 Note: A codec is 
a data compression 
algorithm that can yield 
a movie file that still 
has high-image quality 
even though the actual 
movie file size isn’t 
unmanageably large. 
Codecs, like the popular 
H.264, have allowed 
high-definition video to 
stream on the Internet 
while maintaining good 
image quality. 

314 
lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
aspect ratios
The aspect ratio of an image refers to the proportion between the width and the 
height of the frame. Standard aspect ratios used in video are 4:3 and 16:9, which are 
referred to as “fullscreen” and ”widescreen,” respectively. Fullscreen is the standard 
frame size for television broadcast and also the increasingly obsolete Standard 
Definition digital video (DV). The standard HDTV aspect ratio, also known as Full 
HD, has a frame size of 1920 by 1080 pixels and is composed of square pixels at the 
standard widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. With the growing popularity of HD video 
sizes, such as 720p and 1080p, the widescreen ratio has become a preference over 
the older fullscreen ratio.
Because different cameras record at different sizes and have varying ways of 
capturing pixels in an image, it is critical to input the correct aspect ratio settings 
when exporting your media, or else your image may appear stretched or have an 
unwanted crop. Some cameras that capture to tape tend to record pixels slightly 
stretched to conform a fullscreen image to a widescreen image. However, for the 
purposes of displaying video on the web, it is optimal to use Square Pixels, because 
this is the standard used on the majority of computer video monitor and mobile 
device. If your final video is stretched, make note of the size of the frame and the 
pixel size selected in the Export Settings.
saving a preset
Now let’s save all of the settings we configured as a preset that can be used  
again later.
1 At the top of the Export Settings window, for Output Name, save this movie 
as Afrolicious Promo Final Master in the Exports folder (Adobe CS6 Project 
Assets > Exports). Next to the Preset menu, click the Save Preset button.
2 In the Choose Name window that appears, name this preset QuickTime 
Lossless 1280x720. Click OK.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 315
3 At the bottom of the Export Settings window, next to the Export button, click 
the Queue button to open Adobe Media Encoder CS6.
A Queue panel lists your Afrolicious Promo Final Color Correction sequence from 
Adobe Premiere Pro. The Queue in AME allows you to render several movies at the 
same time. Not only that, but AME can use the Dynamic Link between it and other 
applications in the Adobe CS6 Production Premium Suite. This means that you can 
have sequences from Adobe Premiere Pro in the Queue as well as compositions 
from After Effects.
Next to the Queue is the Preset Browser where you can choose among dozens of 
render presets for various devices and outputs.
Before you render your master file, let’s add a few more renders to the Queue using 
various presets.

316 
lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
encoding video for web and mobile
There was a time not too long ago when the dominant devices for viewing movies 
were televisions and film projection systems in movie theaters. Today, movies can 
not only be produced by anybody with a video camera and a computer, but can be 
shown on a variety of different devices, including high-definition computer moni-
tors, tablet devices, and smartphones.
To ensure that your movie will download as quickly as possible and look as good as 
it possibly can on any given device, it’s best to create separate rendered movie files 
that are intended to play on specific types of devices. Because screens for mobile 
devices and computer monitors vary in size, and because higher-quality movie files 
are larger files to download, you want to give the end users options so they can 
make efficient use of their bandwidth and the capabilities of their movie viewing 
devices.
Encoding a movie file to be played on a variety of devices requires compressing the 
raw video in your edited Adobe Premiere Pro sequence to yield a movie file that 
can be streamed or downloaded as fast as reasonably possible from the Internet, 
yet still maintain maximum image quality.
In this exercise, you’ll apply a variety of export presets in AME to your final edited 
sequence in Adobe Premiere Pro to create separate exports for different types  
of devices.
1 With the Afrolicious Promo Final Color Correction sequence in the Queue, 
select it, and then browse through the Preset Browser. Let’s apply a render 
preset to the Queue for Android tablet devices.
2 Under Devices, twirl open Android, and then double-click on the preset 
Android Tablet - 720p 23.976. Doing so creates another render instance in the 
Queue for your Adobe Premiere Pro sequence. Click on the Output File name 
for this new render, navigate to the Exports folder, and name this Afrolicious 
Promo Final - Tablet. Click Save.
3 Let’s add a render for smartphones. Also under Devices, twirl open Apple, and 
then double-click on the preset Apple TV, iPad, iPhone 3G and newer - 360p 
Widescreen 23.976. This should create yet another render instance. Click on the 
Output File name for this render, navigate to the Exports folder, and name this 
Afrolicious Promo Final - Smartphone. Click Save.
4 Now let’s add another render that could easily be uploaded to YouTube. Select 
Afrolicious Promo Final Color Correction in the Queue. Under Web Video, 
twirl open YouTube, and then double-click on the preset YouTube HD 720p 
23.976. Another instance will appear. Click on its Output File name, navigate  
to the Exports folder, and name it Afrolicious Promo Final - YouTube.  
Click Save.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 317
5 Under Web Video again, twirl open Flash, double-click on the preset  
Web - 1280×720, 16×9, Project Framerate, 4500kbps, and Format F4V. A fifth 
instance appears in the Queue. Click on its Output File name, navigate to the 
Exports folder, and name it Afrolicious Promo Final - Flash. Click Save.
AME
As mentioned earlier, AME allows you to queue up not only Adobe Premiere Pro 
sequences but also After Effects compositions.
In this exercise, you’ll add an After Effects composition to your Queue in AME and 
render it as a master file.
1 Click the Add Source button at the top left of the interface to bring up a 
navigation window. Navigate to the Lesson 06 folder, select Lesson_06_Finish.aep, 
and click Open.

lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
2 In the Import After Effects Composition window that appears, you need to 
choose which composition in this project you want to add to the Queue. 
Click the disclosure triangle next to Comps to twirl it open, and then select 
Afrolicious_Outro. Click OK.
This After Effects composition will now be in the Queue under the five render 
instances you added previously.
3 Each item in the Queue has two down arrow menu buttons. Under  
Afrolicious_Outro, click the left menu button and choose QuickTime. Click  
the menu button to the right and choose the preset you made, Quicktime 
Lossless 1280×720.
4 Click on the queued item’s Output File name, and navigate to the Exports folder. 
Name this render Afrolicious_Outro Master.mov, and then click Save.
5 Click the Start Queue button. You should see multiple progress bars in the 
Queue panel as each of the movie files renders.
6 When the renders are complete, navigate to the Exports folder and verify that 
they are there.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 319
As you’ve witnessed, Adobe Media Encoder CS6 allows you to easily set up exports 
of an Adobe Premiere Pro sequence and an After Effects composition using a 
library of export presets, so that you can make master copies for your archives as 
well as copies that will play on a variety of web and mobile devices.
streaming vs. download
There is an important difference between streaming video and downloading video 
as it relates to creating video for the web:
•
Downloading video involves copying a video file from one computer or server 
to another. The file then exists locally and can be copied elsewhere.
•
Streaming video is video content that is a live playback of the video on a 
remote server that is then accessed via a web browser by the user. The movie file 
is not stored locally on the end user’s computer and therefore cannot be copied. 
This is not the same as a progressive download, which does cache the video file 
on the user’s computer and allows the user to start watching the video as the 
video is still downloading.
rendering your compositions in after effects
With its multiprocessor rendering engine, After Effects CS6 has the power to tackle 
even the most complicated compositing and motion graphics render tasks, saving 
you time and allowing you to meet your deadlines.
1 Open After Effects CS6. Choose File > Open Project, navigate to your  
Lesson 06 folder, select Lesson_06 Start.aep, and click Open. Now let’s open  
the Render Queue.
2 Press Command+Option+0 (Ctrl+Alt+0) to bring up the Render Queue.  
Much like the Queue in AME, the Render Queue in After Effects allows you to 
line up multiple compositions to be rendered and/or multiple instances of the 
same composition to be rendered.
3 In the Project panel, open the Comps folder, and then select and drag the 
Afrolicious_Outro composition into the Render Queue.

320 
lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
4 Any composition that is added to the Render Queue is given default settings. 
Click the disclosure triangles next to Render Settings and Output Module to 
twirl them open and see these defaults.
For the sake of simplicity, let’s use a preset.
5 Click the menu button next to Output Module and choose H.264 from the menu.
6 Click on the “Not yet specified” text next to Output To, navigate to the Exports 
folder, and name this render Afrolicious_Outro - h264.mp4. Click Save.
After Effects CS6 has a render engine that gives you the option to use all of  
your CPU cores—not just one—and allocate a specified amount of your 
computer’s RAM to each core. This enables After Effects to render multiple 
frames simultaneously, dramatically increasing the speed of your render.
7 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Memory & Multiprocessing (Edit > 
Preferences > Memory & Multiprocessing) to activate the multiprocessor  
render engine in After Effects CS6. Select the Render Multiple Frames 
Simultaneously check box. The RAM allocation per background CPU setting 
determines how much RAM will be allocated to each CPU core. Set this to  
0.75 GB and click OK.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 321
8 In the Render Queue, click Render. When Multiprocessor Rendering is turned 
on, it may take a few moments for the rendering to start. Once it starts, you 
should see a yellow progress bar move across the top of the Render Queue. 
When the yellow line gets all the way across, your render is finished.

322 
lesson 8 
Finishing, rendering, and outputting
Sometimes you might need to render an After Effects composition but simultane-
ously continue to do other work in After Effects. In this case you could add an After 
Effects composition to the Queue in AME and have that render while After Effects 
is free to do other work.
Proxy rendering in  
adobe after effects
There may be times when you are working with an After Effects composition, either 
in After Effects or with an imported composition in Adobe Premiere Pro, in which 
you might want to have either a prerendered temporary low-resolution version or 
a final high-resolution version. The reason for these two scenarios is that having a 
completed render of your After Effects composition can greatly speed up the export 
of the final edit in Adobe Premiere Pro or a final composition in After Effects in 
which your prerendered composition is nested.
Adobe After Effects allows you to render out a composition and then automatically 
link the composition to the render on your hard drive. After Effects will then access 
the render and not do the raw calculations whenever the composition is accessed 
in the After Effects project or the Adobe Premiere Pro project in which the composi-
tion is imported.
A render of an After Effects composition that is linked in this manner is called a Proxy.
To set up a render of a Proxy in Adobe After Effects, go to the Output Module set-
tings in the Render Queue, and choose Set Proxy in the Post-Render Action menu. 
After rendering the composition, After Effects automatically links the composition 
to the Proxy render on your hard drive. A link to a Proxy can be deactivated if further 
editing to the composition is required.
archiving your project
When you finish a video project, it is good work practice to archive it properly.  
This ensures that, should you ever need to revisit the project in the future, you  
have everything you need in terms of project files and raw media to pick up where 
you left off.
When you’re ready to archive your project, Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 and Adobe 
After Effects CS6 offer simple ways to bundle your project materials and project 
files. In Adobe Premiere Pro, use the Project Manager by choosing Project > Project 
Manager. In After Effects, use the Collect Files feature by choosing File > Collect Files.

Preparing your final output sequence 
in adobe Premiere Pro
If you are continuing from the previous lesson, feel free to continue with the  
Adobe Premiere Pro project you already have open. If you are starting at this 
lesson, navigate to the Lesson 09 folder on your hard drive and open the Adobe 
Premiere Pro project Lesson_09 Start.prproj. Save your Adobe Premiere Pro  
project file in the Lesson 09 folder as Afrolicious Promo.prproj.
Change your workspace to the standard Editing workspace.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Editing.
You want your user interface to correspond to the instructions in this lesson, 
so you’ll reset your Editing workspace to its default setting, just in case the 
workspace had been modified on your system.
2 Reset this workspace by choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Current 
Workspace, and then click Yes.
Because you are continuing with a previous version of this edit, you’ll first save a  
new version of your sequence. This allows you to go back to the previous version 
if need be and is a recommended best practice in the video editing workflow.
3 In the Project panel, twirl open the Sequences bin.
4 Click on the Afrolicious Promo Final Color Correction sequence to select it. 
Choose Edit > Copy to copy it to your clipboard. Then choose Edit > Paste.
This will make a duplicate of this sequence outside of the Sequences folder.
5 To modify the name of the sequence, click on the name of the sequence to  
select it.
6 Change the name of the sequence to Afrolicious Promo Final Output, press 
Return (Enter), and drag it into the Sequences folder.

about adobe encore
Adobe Encore CS6—a separate software application included with Adobe Premiere 
Pro CS6—allows you to create DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, and web DVDs, all from a 
single project.
Standard DVDs display movies in standard definition, or 720×480 pixels. This for-
mat is still in use, although it is being supplanted by the more modern Blu-ray Disc, 
which can display a movie in high definition (HD), or 1920×1080 pixels. A web DVD 
is a Flash .swf file that allows you to embed in a web page the same user experience 
as with the standard DVD or Blu-ray Disc.
Encore is now a fully native 64-bit application, enabling you to take advantage of all 
available RAM in your system, open and save projects faster, and get better, more 
responsive performance when handling large files and projects. DVD and Blu-ray 
Disc authoring enhancements include support for 8-bit color for highlight buttons; 
the ability to create much larger slide shows than before; and support for upper 
field-first video for better support of certain HD-format source files.

lesson 9 
Authoring for dvd, blu-ray, and the Web
using Dynamic Link to send 
your edit to encore
Adobe Encore CS6 allows you to Dynamically Link an Adobe Premiere Pro sequence 
within an Encore project. This precludes having to do a video export of your Adobe 
Premiere Pro sequence before bringing it into Encore. In addition, after importing  
an Adobe Premiere Pro sequence to Encore, any changes that you make to the 
sequence in Adobe Premiere Pro automatically refresh in all instances of this 
sequence in Encore.
1 In your Adobe Premiere Pro project, select the Afrolicious Promo Final Output 
sequence in your Project panel. Choose File > Adobe Dynamic Link > Send to 
Encore. Encore will open if it wasn’t already open.
You should see a New Project window prompting you to enter a name for your 
Encore project and a location to save it.
2 Name your Encore project AfroliciousPromo_DVD and browse to your Lesson 
09 folder. Select DVD for Authoring Mode.
 Note: An HD movie 
that is mastered to a 
standard DVD will not 
play in HD because 
standard DVDs only 
play at standard 
definition (i.e., NTSC 
720×480 pixels or PAL 
720×576 pixels). To 
output an HD movie so 
it will play from a disc 
in HD, you must set up 
your Encore project for 
Blu-ray. 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 329
PaL system
DVDs distributed in North America and much of Central and South America con-
form to the NTSC standards, namely the standard definition frame size of 720×480 
and a frame rate of 30 fps. However, DVDs produced for playback in a majority 
of other regions of the world, like much of Africa, most of Asia, and virtually the 
entirety of Europe, use the PAL (Phase Alternating Line) system. PAL is a video 
standard that is characterized by a 625-line image that plays back at 25 fps; a larger 
frame size yet lower frame rate than NTSC’s standard definition. You have the ability 
to burn DVDs in Encore by using either the NTSC or PAL standard.
3 For Television Standard, choose NTSC or PAL, depending on the standard 
where you are located or the region in which your DVD would need to play. 
Click OK.
4 To ensure that your interface conforms to the instructions in this lesson, 
you’ll choose a preset workspace. Because the first set of tasks you’ll be doing 
involve creating the DVD menu layout, choose Window > Workspace > Menu 
Design. Then reset this workspace to its default setting by choosing Window > 
Workspace > Reset “Menu Design.” In the window that appears, click Yes.
The Encore interface has a Project panel in which you should see a Timeline object 
as well as an Adobe Premiere Pro Sequence object.

Project panel, you can see that object’s properties in the Properties panel.
DvD region codes
You are able to use region codes to restrict certain areas of the world from accessing 
media. For instance, if a film is slated for a spring release in Japan and a fall release 
in the United States later that year, the Japanese distributors can restrict American 
playback devices from accessing the media on the disc. You are able to set up this 
type of digital-rights management through Encore. The following is a list of all

A Tools panel contains a Selection tool, a Move tool, and a Type tool.
Now that you have a basic familiarity with the interface, let’s create some DVD 
menu pages.
Creating a simple auto-play DvD
There will be times when you’ll want to create a simple DVD that has no interactive 
menus. It will simply play automatically when you put it in a DVD player.
Encore makes doing this very easy. Just import a video clip or Adobe Premiere Pro 
sequence into Encore, and put it in a Timeline. In the Flowchart panel, set the proj-
ect’s First Play to be your Timeline, and set the Timeline’s End Action to loop back to 
the beginning of the Timeline (or No Action for a single play). Then do a build  
to disc.

Dynamic Link between encore and adobe Premiere Pro
To demonstrate the Dynamic Link between your imported sequence in Adobe 
Encore and the corresponding sequence in Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll perform a 
simple operation.
1 In your Encore interface, click the Monitor tab to reveal it. If the Monitor tab 
isn't available, choose Window > Monitor to open it. Press the spacebar to play 
your Timeline. You should see your edited sequence in the Monitor.
The edit starts with a fade up from black, yet it ends without a fade. What if you 
removed this opening fade-up in your Adobe Premiere Pro sequence? Would 
you have to reimport this sequence to Encore for this change to appear in your 
Encore Timeline? The answer is no.
2 Switch back to Adobe Premiere Pro. In your Afrolicious Promo Final Output 
Timeline, press Home to adjust your current time indicator (CTI) to the beginning 
of your sequence. Zoom in on your Timeline by pressing the equal (=) key until 
the first Cross Dissolve is visible on Video 2. Select this Cross Dissolve.
3 Press Delete to eliminate the Cross Dissolve. Save your Adobe Premiere Pro 
project by pressing Command+S (Ctrl+S).
4 Switch back to Adobe Encore. Select your Timeline and press the Home key. 
In the Monitor you should see that the opening fade-up no longer exists here 
either.
Any change that you save in your Dynamically Linked Adobe Premiere Pro 
sequence will automatically update in Encore. This feature is very useful for when 
you need to continue making changes to your edit even after you’ve started your 
DVD authoring in Encore.
overview of DvD navigation
For the end user to navigate between DVD menu screens and to ensure that all of 
the DVD buttons function as intended, a fair amount of programming is required 
in Encore. Fortunately, programming the DVD navigation is very straightforward to 
do using Encore’s intuitive tools.
E Tip: Press 
Command+Tab 
(Alt+Tab) to switch 
between open 
applications.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 333
In this lesson, you’ll create a DVD menu system that has two pages, a Main page 
and an About page. The Main page will have two navigation buttons: one to play 
the movie and the other to go to the About page. The About page will display a 
block of text and have a button that sends the user back to the Main page.
using Preset menus
Although you could create the static layout for the DVD menu pages in Photoshop 
Extended or Adobe After Effects, you’ll use a menu preset that comes with Encore 
and then customize that preset.
Let’s look at some of the presets to get an idea of how easy they are to use. You 
should see two panels at the lower right of the interface, Library and Styles.
In the Library panel, you can choose from different sets of DVD menu presets that 
include background images, placeholder text, and button rollover states. Browse 
through these in the Set drop-down menu.
1 For this lesson, choose the Entertainment set in the Library panel. Double-click 
the Electric Menu and locate Electric Menu in the Project panel.

334 
lesson 9 
Authoring for dvd, blu-ray, and the Web
If you do not see these or any other DVD menu presets, you may need to 
download and install them first. Go to http://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/
multi/library-functional-content-missing.html and follow the instructions.
2 Double-click on Electric Menu. Its properties will appear in the Properties panel 
and its layers will display in the Layers panel. Click the Properties panel’s Basic 
tab and change the name of this menu to AfroliciousPromoDVD_MAIN.
3 Notice that the Layers panel shows all of the layers and folders. Twirl open 
the folder (+) 6. The Final Chapter. It contains a Highlight sublayer and a text 
sublayer. As you might have guessed, this DVD Menu preset was created in 
Photoshop. Each of the layer groups has a sublayer for the DVD navigation 
button rollover states.
Next, you’ll customize this DVD Menu preset for your project.
Creating a custom DvD menu
A custom DVD menu, depending on the needs of a particular project, can be quite 
complex and include multiple menu screens, animated transitions between screens, 
photo slide shows, optional subtitles or closed captioning, chapter markers, alter-
nate audio tracks, and even hidden “Easter eggs.”
The example project will not require a complex DVD menu design but does require 
a bit of work on your part to customize it.
You’ll need to edit and reformat the placeholder text on the 
AfroliciousPromoDVD_MAIN page. Then you’ll replace the background image 
with one of your own.
1 In the Layers panel, you’ll see six button sets, which look like folder icons with 
names. Hold down the Command (Ctrl) key and select the button sets 6. The 
Final Chapter, 5. Bellissimo, 3. Sci-fi Lullabies, and 2. The World of Music. Then 

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 335
press Delete. All that should remain are the background image, the Electric 
Playground text layer, 1. The Beginning, and 4. Worlds of Wonder.
2 Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel. Click once on the Electric Playground 
layer in the Menu Viewer to make the text editable. Select all of this text by 
pressing Command+A (Ctrl+A) and change it to Afrolicious. To commit 
changes to this text object, click on a blank spot in the Layers panel.

336 
lesson 9 
Authoring for dvd, blu-ray, and the Web
3 Now you’ll change the text on the two button objects. In the Layers panel, 
double-click on the button set 4. Worlds of Wonder. A Rename Layer window 
appears. Type in the name About Afrolicious and click OK. Double-click on 
the button set 1. The Beginning and type in the new name Play Movie.
4 Twirl open the two button sets in the Layers panel. Note the two Highlight 
sublayers. Select the Highlight for About Afrolicious; you should see a green 
rectangle around the text as well as a thin, blue rectangle underneath the text. 
This thin, blue rectangle indicates the size of the menu button rollover state, 
which shows as a red underline. With the Selection tool, adjust the right edge  
of the blue rectangle until it is the same width as the About Afrolicious text.
5 Do the same for the Play Movie button. Select its Highlight sublayer, and then 
adjust the width of its thin, blue rectangle so that this button’s rollover state is 
the same width as the text.
6 Select the Afrolicious text layer, hold down the Command (Ctrl) key, and click 
the About Afrolicious and Play Movie text sublayers. In the Character panel, 
set the font to Helvetica Neue bold. This will change the font to one you already 
used in your edit.
7 Deselect all, and then select just the Afrolicious layer. Press the M key to 
activate the Move tool from the Tools panel, and then click and drag the 
Afrolicious text layer so that its left edge aligns with the left edge of Play Movie.
8 Press the V key to activate the Selection tool again. Hold down the Command 
(Ctrl) key and select the Play Movie and About Afrolicious layers in the Layers 
panel, so that all three text layers are selected. In the Styles panel, choose Basics 
from the Set menu, and then double-click on Drop Shadow Black (text) to give 
the text a black drop shadow.
E Tip: As you move 
objects by dragging 
them in the Menu 
Viewer, hold down the 
Shift key to constrain 
movement to either 
the horizontal or the 
vertical axis.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 337
Aside from changing the background, you’ve adjusted the preset to create a 
customized layout. Because the About menu page will have the same basic 
layout, let’s duplicate the Main menu page.
9 In the Project panel, select the AfroliciousPromoDVD_MAIN menu object.  
Choose Edit > Duplicate, making a new menu object called Afrolicious-
PromoDVD_MAIN copy. Double-click the copy, and then in the Properties 
panel, change the name to AfroliciousPromoDVD_ABOUT.
10 With the layers for AfroliciousPromoDVD_ABOUT showing in the Layers 
panel, double-click the Play Movie folder and rename it to Back to Main 
Menu. Select its Highlight sublayer, and use the Selection tool to adjust the 
width of the thin, blue rectangle so that it’s the same width as the text. Deselect 
the button box for the About Afrolicious folder so that this text object is not 
interactive. Select the Highlight sublayer for About Afrolicious and press Delete.

338 
lesson 9 
Authoring for dvd, blu-ray, and the Web
11 Click the Show Safe Area button on the Menu Viewer. These safe guides show 
the title and action safe areas of a frame.
12 Select the About Afrolicious text layer, and then use the Move tool to drag the 
About Afrolicious text object to the top left of the title safe area.
13 In Mac OS Finder or Windows Explorer, navigate to the Additional Assets 
folder (Adobe CS6 Project Assets > Lessons > Lesson 09 > Additional Assets). 
Open the AboutAfrolicious file in a text editor. Select all of the text and choose 
Edit > Copy. Switch back to Encore.
14 Select the About Afrolicious text layer in the Layers panel. With the Type tool, 
click once in the Menu Viewer panel on the About Afrolicious text and press 
Command+A (Ctrl+A) to select all of the text. Then choose Edit > Paste. All of 
the text from the text document should now be on this layer, although it is not 
all visible. Adjust the bottom-right corner of the thin, blue rectangle around the 
text to increase the rectangle to the width of the title safe area and the height to 
the top half of the title safe area.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 339
Next, you need to replace the background image of the About menu. To do this, 
you must first export a still from your edit.
15 Switch to Adobe Premiere Pro. In the Timeline for Afrolicious Promo Final 
Output, set your CTI on a frame that would serve as a good still image 
background for the About menu page. At the bottom of the Program viewer, 
click the Export Frame button. In the Export Frame window, name the exported 
frame AboutMenuBG and save it as a TIFF to your Lesson 09 folder. Click OK.
16 Go back to Encore. Choose File > Import As > Asset. Navigate to your Lesson 09  
folder, select AboutMenuBG.tif, and then click Open. AboutMenuBG.tif will 
appear in your Project panel. Select it. With the AfroliciousPromoDVD_ABOUT 
menu open, drag and drop AboutMenuBG.tif into the Menu Viewer.
17 You’ll see this image cover up everything else in the menu. Double-click on the 
AfroliciousPromoDVD_ABOUT menu in the Project panel to show its layers in 
the Layers panel. Select the AboutMenuBG.tif layer at the top, and then choose 
Object > Arrange > Send to Back.
18 Adjust the Zoom Level of the Menu Viewer to 50% to see the outer edges of  
the selected AboutMenuBG.tif layer. With the Move tool active, hold down  
Option+Shift (Alt+Shift) as you drag a corner of the image until its height matches  
the height of the menu frame. Adjust the position of the AboutMenuBG.tif layer 
so it is centered in frame. Set the Menu View magnification to Fit and deactivate 
the Show Safe Area button.

19 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your Encore project.
Programming navigation in DvD menus
Now that you’ve created the basic layout of your menu pages, it’s time to program 
the buttons and playback options.
1 In the Layers panel for the AfroliciousPromoDVD_ABOUT menu page, select 
the Back to Main Menu button set and view its properties in the Properties 
panel. Among them is a Link property. Click the right arrow for the Link 
property, and choose AfroliciousPromoDVD_MAIN > Play Movie. This will 
ensure that clicking the Back to Main Menu button will send the user back to 
the Main menu and make the Play Movie button active.
2 In the Project panel, double-click on AfroliciousPromoDVD_MAIN. If there is 
anything still selected, press Shift+Command+A (Shift+Ctrl+A) to deselect all.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 341
3 In the Layers panel, select the Play Movie button set. In the Properties panel, set 
the value for Link by using the pick-whip, which is the little swirl icon next to 
the word Link. Click once on the pick-whip and then, without letting go of your 
mouse button, draw a line all the way to the Afrolicious Promo Final Output 
Timeline in the Project panel.
 Note: A pick-whip is an intuitive user interface feature that allows you to link one project 
object with another by drawing a line between them.
4 When you see this Timeline object highlighted by a green rounded rectangle, 
release the mouse pointer and verify that the value for Link is the Afrolicious 
Promo Final Output Timeline : Chapter 1. When the DVD menu is activated, 
clicking the Play Movie button will play the movie.
5 In the Layers panel, select the About Afrolicious button set. In the Properties 
panel, set the Link to AfroliciousPromoDVD_ABOUT > Back to Main Menu. 
When the DVD is activated, clicking this button will send the viewer to the 
About menu.

342 
lesson 9 
Authoring for dvd, blu-ray, and the Web
In the Flowchart panel you should see a DVD (or Project) icon labeled Untitled 
Project with a blue arrow linking it to a Timeline icon.
6 Select the untitled disc icon and go to its Properties panel. Change its Name to 
Afrolicious Promo DVD. Change First Play to AfroliciousPromoDVD_MAIN 
: Play Movie by clicking the right arrow icon for First Play and then accessing 
the menus. Notice how this changes the Flowchart so that when the DVD is first 
loaded, the Main menu plays first, not the Timeline.
7 In the Flowchart panel or in the Project panel, select the Afrolicious Promo 
Final Output Timeline, and then go to its Properties panel. Set the End Action 
to AfroliciousPromoDVD_MAIN > Play Movie. When the movie is done 
playing on the DVD, the Main menu will appear again.
8 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.
adding motion to DvD menus
DVD menus can be more engaging to the viewer if they include some motion, 
either with video clips or animations. Let’s add a video clip to the background of 
the Main menu to give it some motion.
In the Menu Viewer panel, set the Zoom Level of AfroliciousPromoDVD_MAIN 
to 100%. Currently, there is a still image in the background. To replace this with a 
video clip, let’s first import that video.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 343
1 Choose File > Import As > Asset. Navigate to the Footage folder (Adobe CS6  
Project Assets > Footage), select Live_01.mp4, and click Open. This clip is  
approximately 20 seconds long, which is sufficient as a looping video background. 
More important, this clip is a well-composed shot that encapsulates the overall 
mood of the movie being presented on the DVD.
2 Select AfroliciousPromoDVD_MAIN in the Project panel. In the Properties 
panel, click the Motion tab. Using the Video property’s pick-whip tool, select 
Live_01.mp4 in the Project panel, which should appear highlighted with green 
when selected. When you release your mouse pointer, you should see the first 
frame of Live_01.mp4 as the background of the Main menu page.
3 Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to save your project.

Authoring for dvd, blu-ray, and the Web
testing your project
If you create a navigation system on a DVD menu, it’s important to make sure that 
all of the button links and other functionality work as intended before you output 
your project on an optical disc or as a Flash movie for the web.
In Encore, you can verify all of the links and other menu properties by checking 
and previewing your project.
1 Choose File > Check Project. A panel appears with properties that when chosen 
here, will be verified. Click Start to check your project. Any errors will show in 
the field at the bottom of the window. Close this panel.
2 Now do a preview. Click the Preview button at the top of the interface to bring 
up a Project Preview window that has DVD menu controls at the bottom.
3 Because the Main menu contains motion, you need to click the “Render current 
motion menu or slideshow” button so you can see the video background in  
the preview.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 345
This render may take a while, because the HD video content is being converted 
to standard definition. When it is done, you should see your DVD menu design 
as it would appear when viewed from a mastered DVD. Use the DVD menu 
controls to test your buttons and to otherwise make sure that the DVD pages 
look the way you want them to.
4 When you’re finished, click Exit Here.
5 If everything looks good, you’re ready to output. Press Command+S (Ctrl+S) to 
save your project.
outputting your DvD or Blu-ray Disc
Encore enables you to output your project in a few different formats, including 
standard DVDs and the more modern Blu-ray Discs.
Although on-demand streaming HD video is now possible, Blu-ray Discs can play 
HD movies at a higher bitrate than on-demand streaming movies on the Internet; 
hence, Blu-ray Discs yield better image and sound quality.
Choose File > Build > Disc to open the Build panel. Here, you can burn your project 
to a blank DVD. You can also verify any settings related to encoding for different 
Region Codes or Copy Protection.
 Note: To see a 
finished state of how 
your Encore project 
should look, choose 
File > Open Project, 
navigate to the DVD 
Final folder (Adobe 
CS6 Project Assets > 
Lessons > Lesson 09 > 
DVD Final), and open 
AfroliciousPromo_DVD_
Finish.ncor.

346 
lesson 9 
Authoring for dvd, blu-ray, and the Web
To burn a project to a blank DVD, click Build. Encore then prepares all of the files 
to format onto the blank DVD. 
When authoring for DVD or Blu-ray, consider the amount of content that you need 
to put on the disc, and based on that, use the appropriate blank media.
Standard DVDs, which are used for standard definition video content, can have mul-
tiple layers on each side and can even be written on both sides of the disc, making 
the capacity as much as three times that of a single-sided, single-layer standard DVD. 
For instance, a single-sided, single-layer standard DVD holds approximately 4.7 GB, 
whereas a dual-sided, dual-layer standard DVD can hold approximately 17 GB.
Blu-ray Discs, which are used for HD video content, can also have multiple layers, 
and can hold between 25 GB and 50 GB, although new technologies are being 
developed to allow up to 128 GB capacity on Blu-ray Discs.
The amount (number of minutes) of video content that can fit on either of these 
types of discs depends on the bitrate at which the video was encoded before out-
put. The capacity of a blank optical disc is measured in bytes, not minutes.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 347
Should your project require more space than a blank disc allows, you can access 
your Encore Project Settings and adjust the Maximum Audio/Video Bitrate in the 
Default Transcode Settings. Generally, you would encode a standard DVD with  
a bitrate of between 3 Mbps and 8 Mbps. You would encode a Blu-ray Disc with a 
bitrate of between 5 Mbps and 15 Mbps.
If you intend to master to disc very little content relative to the capacity of your 
blank media, encode your DVD or Blu-ray content at the highest maximum bitrate 
possible to ensure the best possible image quality.
the balance between data 
compression and image quality
When you’re at the output stage of creating a DVD for a lengthy movie, the capacity 
of the blank media and whether all of your content can fit on it is a primary factor to 
consider. Adobe Encore lets you adjust the data compression rate so your content 
can be reduced in file size to fit in the limited capacity of your blank optical media. 
However, the more that data is compressed, the more you sacrifice the image qual-
ity of your video content. You should strike a balance between a data compression 
rate that allows all of your content to fit on a blank disc while maintaining as good 
image quality as possible. These considerations need to be assessed on a project-
by-project basis.
Flash content on the web today
The Adobe Flash Player software allows content encoded as .swf files to play in  
web browsers. The Flash Player software is still available for desktop operating  
systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. However, it has been steadily  
losing ground as a mode of sharing video content online as a result of H.264/MPEG-4 
rapidly taking over the market of web video in recent years. In addition, Flash 
content is not supported on mobile browsers that run on Apple iOS-based devices. 
Although a version of the Flash Player is currently still available for the Linux-based 
Android mobile operating system, Adobe has discontinued development of its Flash 
Player for mobile devices in favor of HTML5.
Although the Flash Player is less favorable to an HTML5 solution due to its lack of 
compatibility on mobile devices, Adobe Flash Professional CS6 is still widely used 
and is at the cutting edge in the development of apps, games, and other desktop 
and mobile content.

348 
lesson 9 
Authoring for dvd, blu-ray, and the Web
outputting your project as Flash for the web
Encore also enables you to output your project as an interactive Flash file for the 
web, so that all of the project content and menu functionality can be embedded in 
a web page and no optical media is required. Additionally, the Flash .swf file format 
can contain searchable metadata, allowing a web-embedded .swf to show up in 
search engines. Also, .swf files are still widely compatible with web browsers that 
run on desktop operating systems.
Let’s output your Encore DVD menu as a website with embedded Flash content.
1 To do this, choose File > Build > Flash. Set your Destination Location as your 
Lesson 09 folder. Under Settings, choose FLV as your format. Set the Preset to 
FLV 1280×720 29.97fps Widescreen Medium Quality. Click Build.
A Build Progress window shows the progress bars.

Adobe CreAtive suite 6 ProduCtion Premium ClAssroom in A book 349
2 When all rendering is done, click OK. Then close the Build panel.
3 To find your Flash movie output on your hard drive, go to the Afrolicious 
Promo DVD folder in your Lesson 09 folder. You’ll see an index.html file. 
Double-click that file to open it in a web browser. To see your Flash movie, you 
must have the Flash Player installed.
Introducing Flash Professional
Adobe Flash Professional CS6 is an authoring environment that is generally tailored 
for creating games, websites, animation, and multimedia content for desktop com-
puters and mobile devices.
For a comprehensive tutorial on using Adobe Flash Professional CS6, check out 
Adobe Flash Professional CS6 Classroom in a Book (Adobe Press, 2012).
Creating interactivity with Flash Professional
Although this book can’t cover all the tasks you can do with Flash Professional, you 
can perform a basic task. Let’s say you want to embed your movie in a web page 
without the menu functionality. All you want is the movie with playback controls in 
a customized skin. To do that is very simple.
1 Open Flash Professional and choose File > New. In the Templates, choose Media 
Playback, and then choose Title Safe Area HDTV 720. Click OK. A new stage 
appears with title and action safe guides.
Next, you want to take a .mp4 export of your movie and bring it directly into 
your Stage.
2 Choose File > Import > Import to Stage. Navigate to the Additional Assets 
folder (Adobe CS6 Project Assets > Lessons > Lesson 09 > Additional Assets), 
select Afrolicious Promo Final.mp4, and then click Open. You’ll see an Import 
Video window.
3 Under “Where is your video file?” choose “On your computer” and “Load 
external video with playback component.” Then click Next, which will bring you 
to the Skinning settings. Choose a Skin preset, click Next, and then click Finish.
You should see an instance of your video in your Stage with playback controls at 
the bottom. In order to see the entire frame, you may need to change the view 
magnification, at the top right of the stage, to Show All.

folder icon to open the Select Publish Destination window and choose the 
Lesson 09 folder. Then in the Save As field in this same window, name your file 
AfroliciousPromoFlash.swf. Click Publish.
5 In your Lesson 09 folder, you should see AfroliciousPromoFlash.swf ready  
to be embedded in a web page. If you drag this file into a web browser  
window, you’ll see your final movie with the playback controls you selected  
in Flash Professional.
