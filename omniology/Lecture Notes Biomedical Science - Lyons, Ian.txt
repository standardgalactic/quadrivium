Preface
The medical curriculum has undergone signiﬁcant
change in recent years. Most noticeably, it has
broadened, even since we started at medical school
early in the twenty-ﬁrst century. As students we
noticedthatthevast majorityof textbooksformedi-
cal sciences focused on a very narrow area, often at
a level of detail far beyond what we required. We
have endeavoured to provide a resource of the
essential facts, without too much additional detail.
The book follows the areas of medical science in
which tomorrow’s doctors are examined. It fol-
lows the Lecture Notes format of short prose and
bullet points. Many of the illustrations have been
kept intentionally concise so that they can be
reproduced by the students in an exam or as an
aide memoire.
The book helps draw together the various areas
of medical science. We hope that this will help the
consolidation of knowledge gained from more de-
tailed works, thus drawing together the knowledge
we are all required to understand as medical stu-
dents and as doctors.
First, I would like to thank my four co-authors
who wrote signiﬁcant portions of particular chap-
ters in this book: Sarah Cook (Endocrinology and
Reproduction),CatherineHildyard(Neuroscience),
David McCartney (Physiology and Pharmacology)
andImogenStaveley(Anatomy).Inadditiontotheir
skills and expertise as applied to those chapters,
their comments on the book as a whole have been
instrumental in shaping it. Furthermore, their sup-
port and persistent endeavour in this project has
been greatly appreciated.
Second, I would like to acknowledge the senior
editorial team: Profs. Christopher Lote, Paola
Domizio and Donal McNally. The other student
authors and I had little idea of the task we were
undertaking when we began this project; their
insight and advice has been enormously helpful.
Third, I am grateful for the input and support of
Miss Rebecca Anderson, Mr Jonathan Best, Mr
David Grant, Miss Rachel Humphreys, Dr Michael
Lyons, Mr Stuart Lyons, Mrs Young-Ja Lyons,
Mr Samuel Offer, Mr Jack Pottle, Miss Charlotte
Seymour, Miss Claire Strauss, Miss Rebecca Ting,
Miss Laura Watts and Sub-Lt Dr Timothy Wills, and
(though they were unaware of their assistance) all
the members of 2009 Tingewick Firm. They have
all helped in some way with the preparation of
this manuscript.
Finally, it has been a pleasure to work with Laura
Quigley, Beth Bishop and all the staff at Wiley-
Blackwell who have aided and assisted us through
what has been a long creative process. Special
thanks must be reserved for Karen Moore – she has
been directly involved in both the development and
production of this project since its inception. Her
advice and cooperation have been truly invaluable.

1
Cell biology
The cell is the basic unit of living organisms; while
some organisms are made up of a single cell (e.g.
protozoa and bacteria), others are made up of
many cells, organised into tissues and organs, that
perform speciﬁc functions.
Individual cells in humans and other eukary-
otic organisms are organised into functional
areas – organelles – that perform a speciﬁc func-
tion. Cells usually divide by mitosis to produce
identical daughter cells to allow the develop-
ment of tissue or the replacement of dying cells.
However, for the purpose of reproduction, they
divide by meiosis in which the daughter cells
each possess half a full set of chromosomes. In
developed tissues, mitosis occurs to replace
those cells that have become damaged; if such
cell division occurs in an unregulated fashion,
cancer may result.
Organelles: structure
and function
A cell contains specialised regions that take on
speciﬁc functions. These organelles are discussed
below; however, the biochemical interactions that
occur are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.
The cell membrane
The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer
that surrounds the cell, deﬁning its boundaries. The
membrane contains many specialised molecules
embedded within it, for the transport of molecules
across it, as well as regulating the properties and
behaviour of the membrane itself (Fig. 1.1).
Structure
The formation of the bilayer relies on the proper-
ties of the constituent phospholipids. They are
made up of two parts:
1 A polar head region, which is soluble in
water (hydrophilic). This region often contains
a charged group which mediates its hydrophilic
nature.
2 A non-polar tail region, which is insoluble in
water (hydrophobic). This hydrophobic property
results from the long uncharged fatty acyl chains.
These properties promote phospholipids to form
a bilayer, in which the hydrophilic head regions are
in contact with water while the hydrophobic tail
regions accumulate in the middle of the bilayer.
The ﬂuidity of the membrane is regulated by the
presence of cholesterol.
The cell membrane is a dynamic structure, with
the various protein components free to rotate and
diffuse laterally around the lipids, allowing their
aggregation, which is often required for signalling.
These proteins can be grouped into two types:
1 Integral
proteins
are
embedded
in
the
membrane.
2 Peripheral proteins are associated with the sur-
face of the membrane as a result of non-covalent
interactions.

The precise proteins associated with the mem-
brane differ depending on the cell specialisation,
other external signals that have been received and
the speciﬁc state of the individual cell.
Both proteins and lipids in the membrane may
be glycosylated, whereby carbohydrates are added
to the molecule. These carbohydrates may be
involved in the interaction between the cell and
the environment or other cells.
The cytoplasm
The organelles are contained in the cytoplasm,
which is made up of a wide variety of ions and
solutes, as well as a complex cytoskeletal structure.
This structure maintains the cell shape and reg-
ulates various transport and trafﬁcking pathways
in the cell. The cytoplasm is also the site of most
cellular metabolic reactions.
The nucleus
The nucleus contains almost all the genetic infor-
mation necessary to produce any cell in the human
body; this genetic information is densely packed as
chromatin. The nucleus is separated from the rest
of the cell by a nuclear envelope, which is made up
of two lipid bilayers – the outer membrane being
continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum.
Transport of molecules across the nuclear mem-
brane is tightly regulated by many nuclear pores in
the nuclear envelope.
Despite its important function, the nucleus
usually occupies a relatively small volume, often
around 5% of the total cell volume.
The nucleolus, which is the site of synthesis of
ribosomal RNA and the assembly of ribosomes, is
one of the few structures visible in the nucleus (by
light microscopy).
The endoplasmic reticulum
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of
tubes continuous with the outer membrane of the
nuclear envelopes. It produces lipids and protein
for secretion or use in cellular organelles. There are
two types of ER:
1 Rough ER is the site of protein production. Its
‘rough’ appearance under an electron micro-
scope comes from the presence of protein-
synthesising ribosomes on its surface. The
resulting proteins are secreted into the ER
lumen, from where they are transported for
further modiﬁcation
2 The

the mitochondria – are found in several copies within the cell, although they have been represented only a single

Cell biology

contribute to the cellular membranes, and also
the production of steroids. Smooth ER is asso-
ciated with detoxifying reactions, particularly in
the liver, and is also the site from which compo-
nents are transported to other organelles by
vesicular transport.
The proportions of rough and smooth ER may
reﬂect the specialisation of the cell, e.g. in the
adrenal cortex, which is responsible for the
production of steroid hormones, the smooth ER
accounts for most of the cell volume.
The Golgi apparatus
The
Golgi
apparatus
modiﬁes
many
cellular
proteins, through the addition of carbohydrates.
It resembles a series of sac-like structures –
cisternae – which receive proteins from the
rough ER by vesicular transport. As proteins are
transported between the different cisternae, they
receive carbohydrate modiﬁcations; transport may
be forwards or backwards between compartments,
before the proteins are packaged into vesicles for
secretion or transport to speciﬁc organelles. This
process, trafﬁcking, relies on the presence of
speciﬁc signals in the proteins themselves, which
target them to their ﬁnal destination.
Mitochondria
Mitochondria synthesise ATP and other phosphate
compounds
that
power
cellular
reactions
through the catabolism of a variety of metabolic
compounds.
Structure
Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles.
The outer membrane is smooth whereas the inner
membrane possesses a series of projections –
cristae – that impinge on the interior of the mito-
chondria, known as the matrix.
Mitochondria contain a primitive genome that
encodes some of the proteins not found in the
nuclear genome that are necessary for their func-
tion. This, and their replication independently of
the nucleus of the cell, may reﬂect their endosym-
biotic origin. However, many of the proteins that
mitochondria require are solely encoded in the
main genome in the nucleus of the cell.
Unlike the main human genome, the mitochon-
drial genome is always inherited entirely from the
mother; mitochondria in sperm do not contribute
to the zygote.
DEFINITION Endosymbiotic theory of
the origin of mitochondria
The mitochondrial genome has been sequenced
and has many features consistent with a bacterial
genome. It has been suggested that, at some
point in the past, a bacterium became engulfed by
a primitive cell and remained within it, resulting in
a symbiosis between the two organisms. It is
thought that this symbiotic bacterium evolved into
the mitochondria of today.
Function
Mitochondria meet the energy needs of the cell.
In the matrix the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle
occurs, which supplies the electron transport
chain with the reduced co-factors necessary
to generate ATP, the main energy currency of
the cell.
The number of mitochondria present in the cell
reﬂects its energy need; muscle cells and neurons
have high energy demands and frequently have
many mitochondria, whereas cells with lower en-
ergy requirements may possess very few.
CLINICAL Myoclonic epilepsy with
ragged red ﬁbres
Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red ﬁbres (MERRF)
is a rare condition characterised by myoclonus,
epilepsy and ataxia, usually manifesting in the teens
or student age. Further symptoms include muscle
weakness, deafness, dementia and seizure. The
cause has been traced to a decrease in the function
of the electron transport chain resulting from
mutation in a mitochondrially-encoded protein. As
such, the condition is maternally inherited, although
the mother may express a weaker phenotype than
her child.
Ribosomes
Ribosomes are minute organelles, around 20 nm
in diameter, that synthesise amino acids. They
are found free ﬂoating in the cytosol, or on
the rough ER, where the proteins produced are
destined for secretion or transport to another
organelle.
Cell biology 3

Lysosomes and the endosomal
compartment
The endosomal compartment consists of many
membrane-bound compartments in the cyto-
plasm that package and transport molecules to
other regions of the cell or to the external environ-
ment. They can also isolate reactions that may be
damaging to the cell as a whole – often involving
degradative enzymes.
Lysosomes
Lysosomes
are
membrane-enclosed
compart-
ments, involved in the degradation of some mole-
cules and old organelles, so that the components
can be broken down and reused to synthesise new
macromolecules. They contain a variety of acid
hydrolases, potent degradative enzymes that act in
an acid environment. Consequently, the interior of
the lysosome is acidic, typically pH 5.
In phagocytic cells, lysosomes have developed
a more speciﬁc role. The enzymes can degrade
bacteria and other pathogens that have been in-
gested to control infection.
Cellular processes
The cell survives and performs its role through the
functionofthevariousmacromoleculeswithinit.The
synthesis and chemical properties of these macro-
molecules are discussed in Chapter 3, although the
following major processes are discussed below:
. Transport across a membrane
. Enzymes – catalysis of the chemical reactions
. Trafﬁcking of proteins to their site of action.
DEFINITION Osmosis
Osmosis can be deﬁned as ‘the ﬂow of water across
a semi-permeable membrane’. The cell membrane
is permeable to water, though not to many of the
solutes found within it. The presence of different
solutes in different concentrations on either side
of the membrane contributes to a concentration
gradient. This gradient must be equilibrated by
movement of water across the membrane. As such,
the volume of a compartment is altered due to the
ﬂow of water down the concentration gradient.
Membrane transport
Membranes can regulate the movement of mole-
cules across them. Although the phospholipid
bilayer is insoluble to most polar molecules,
non-polar molecules and small polar molecules
can traverse the membrane by diffusion. This
diffusion is crucial for the regulation of the cel-
lular volume by osmosis.
Diffusion
Diffusion is the movement of molecules down
a concentration gradient (osmosis is diffusion of
water). Diffusion continues until the concentra-
tion gradient has been abolished and a dynamic
equilibrium established, where the ﬂow across
the membrane in each direction is the same. There
are a number of factors that govern the rate of
diffusion:
. The rate of diffusion is proportional to the square
of the distance.
. The size – small particles diffuse faster.
. The rate of diffusion is proportional to the
concentration gradient.
. A thicker membrane will slow the rate of
diffusion.
Non-polar molecules (e.g. steroid hormones) can
dissolve within the bilayer and are capable of
diffusing across the membrane, as are small par-
ticles such as H2O and O2. Polar molecules (and
large molecules in general) cannot pass unaided
through the lipid bilayer.
Mechanisms of membrane
transport
Large or charged molecules cannot diffuse across
the lipid bilayer and must be helped by speciﬁc
transport proteins; some molecules must be trans-
ported against the concentration gradient, through
active transport. Membrane transport is achieved
through the presence of channels and carrier pro-
teins in the bilayer.
Channels are pores that let speciﬁc water-
soluble molecules across the membrane while
in solution. Channels may be gated to restrict
the ﬂow of their target molecule to speciﬁc
periods.
Gating
may
be
in
response
to
a
ligand (e.g. acetylcholine), voltage or another
stimulus.
4
Cell biology

Carrier proteins bind their target molecule and
transport it across the bilayer by a conformational
shift. Three different types of transport can be
distinguished:
1 Facilitated diffusion allows the movement of
molecules that cannot diffuse directly through
the lipid bilayer to move down their concentra-
tion gradient. The binding of the ligand to its
carrier protein is sufﬁcient to induce a confor-
mation change so thatit canmovethemolecule(s)
across the membrane without using the cell’s
energy. Alternatively, the transporter may ‘ﬂip’
between two states, allowing the movement of
molecules across the lipid bilayer if they are
bound
at
the
moment
of
conformational
change. Facilitated diffusion is used by many
ion exchangers (e.g. Cl , HCO3
 exchanger)
and by transporters of larger molecules (e.g. the
glucose transporters)
2 Primary active transport is the transport of
molecules against their concentration gradient,
directly using ATP to power the process. This
generates a large concentration gradient that
can power other cellular processes. It can also
allow the compartmentalisation of harmful
molecules and their removal from the cell. The
Na þ/K þATPase works through primary active
transport.
3 Secondary active transport is the movement of
a molecule against its concentration gradient
that is powered by a different concentration
gradient generated by primary active transport,
e.g. the Na þ/Ca2 þ exchanger transports Ca2 þ
againstitsconcentrationgradientduetotheﬂow
of Na þ down the gradient, which was previously
generated through the action of the Na þ/K þ
ATPase.
Enzymes and catalysis
Enzymes are proteins that catalyse a chemical
reaction. All enzymes contain an active site in
which catalysis of the reaction takes place. This
active site is deﬁned by the amino acid residues in
the molecule and the folding patterns that emerge.
Two distinct types of region can be identiﬁed in
the active site:
1 The binding sites hold the substrate on the
active site.
2 The catalytic site is the region of the active site
where the reaction takes place.
Two distinct theories of how the active site
contributes to catalysis have been put forward:
1 The ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis
2 The induced ﬁt hypothesis
The 'lock-and-key' hypothesis
This hypothesis suggests that there is a high com-
plementarity between the enzyme and its substrate
– similar to a lock and key. The speciﬁcity is deter-
mined by the amino acid residues in the active site
that are not involved in binding or catalysis of the
substrate. These interactions may be the result of
complementary shape, the presence of chemically
complementary charges, or a combination of both.
The induced ﬁt hypothesis
The induced ﬁt hypothesis suggests that interac-
tions between an enzyme and its substrate result in
a conformational change, ‘steric strain’ that pro-
motes the catalysis of the reaction. In multi-
subunit proteins, the binding of a ligand to one
subunit may induce a conformational change in
the other subunits to promote binding further, e.g.
in haemoglobin.
Multienzymes
Enzymes are often found in large multimeric com-
plexes. These multienzymes consist of several
copies of each subunit and co-factors that are
required. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is an example
of a multienzyme.
Multienzymes may also express different sub-
unitsinatissue-speciﬁcmanner.These isoenzymes
may have different kinetic properties or slightly
different kinetic functions. Lactate dehydrogenase
is a tetramer made up of two different types of
subunit:‘H’formsubunitsarefoundpredominantly
in the heart, whereas ‘M’ form subunits are found in
the muscles. The different subunits have different
properties – ‘H’ subunits catalyse the conversion of
lactate to pyruvate, whereas the ‘M’ forms are re-
quired for anaerobic glycolysis and catalyse the
conversion of pyruvate to lactate. As a result of these
two subunit types, ﬁve different proteins may be
produced: H4, H3M, H2M2, HM3, M4.
Co-factors
Co-factors are non-protein molecules that aid the
function of an enzyme:
Cell biology 5

. Metal ions are frequently used as electron
donors/acceptors because they can exist in a
variety of oxidation states.
. Organic molecules are referred to as coenzymes
and bind a substrate required for the reaction, or
may be reduced or oxidised during the enzymatic
reaction. NAD þ and NADP þ are examples of co-
factors that become reduced, and can be used in
other reactions.
Protein trafﬁcking
Proteins must be targeted to the correct sites in
the cell to perform a function. This information
is contained in the amino acid sequence of the
protein. The following are two broad methods by
which this information is encoded:
1 The signal peptide results from a chain of
around 15–60 amino acids typically located at
one end of the polypeptide. This signal sequence
encodes the destination of the protein and is
recognised by various proteins to trigger the
transport of the protein. After targeting of the
protein, the signal peptide is be cleaved from
the polypeptides by enzymes known as signal
peptidases.
2 Signal patches are a less well-understood
method of targeting. The fully folded protein
encodes a region in its structure that is recog-
nised and targets the protein to a speciﬁc
location. Signal patches are difﬁcult to identify,
because they rely on the folded nature of the
protein, and are not identiﬁable solely from the
amino acid sequence.
Targeting of protein to the
endoplasmic reticulum
All protein synthesis is initiated on free-ﬂoating
ribosomes, yet the protein synthesis must be tar-
geted to the correct location as a result of a signal
peptide encoded at the start of the amino acid
chain. This ER-targeting sequence produces a se-
ries of changes:
. The signal peptide rapidly folds around the
ribosome such that it pauses in translation.
. The signal peptide allows the binding of the
ribosome to speciﬁc pores in the ER.
. Cleavage of the signal peptide permits the con-
tinuation of translation, with the protein product
being secreted into the ER lumen.
Targeting of proteins to other
compartments
Many different signals have been identiﬁed that
target proteins to different compartments. Often,
these rely on signals in the protein sequence;
however, the protein may promote an additional
modiﬁcation that targets the protein. This can be
seen in lysosomal targeting, where the addition of
the sugar mannose 6-phosphate is responsible
for the targeting of the protein to the lysosome.
Deﬁciencies in protein targeting may contribute
to serious diseases.
Cellular transport and secretion
CLINICAL I-cell disease
I-cell disease is a very rare inherited disease that
results from the presence of non-functioning lyso-
somes. These become engorged because they
are unable to break down their contents. The cells
become non-viable, which is manifested grossly in
skeletal deformities, restricted joint movements
and hepatosplenomegaly. The conditioniscurrently
untreatable and therapy focuses on limiting symp-
toms. Nevertheless, death results early in infancy.
I-cell disease results from a deﬁciency in the
enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransfer-
ase, which is involved in the carbohydrate modiﬁ-
cationstargetingaproteintothe lysosomes.Instead
the enzymes are secreted from the cell and unable
to perform their essential function in the lysosome.
Vesicular transport
Transport of molecules to their target in the cell
often requires the passage of a molecule through
a lipid bilayer. Vesicular transport allows the
transport of a molecule from the interior of
one membrane-bound organelle to the interior of
another in a lipid capsule.
The future contents of a vesicle are often aggre-
gated together on the lipid bilayer and the vesicle is
formed around them. The newly formed vesicle is
then transported to the target, where the lipid
bilayer of the vesicle fuses with the membrane,
releasing its contents.
Vesicular transport is important in the mainte-
nance of cellular membranes; fusion of a vesicle
to a membrane contributes to the lipid bilayer.
Fusion of a vesicle with the cell membrane also
6
Cell biology

results in release of the vesicular contents – as is
seen in the constitutive and regulatory secretory
pathways.
Exocytosis and endocytosis
Vesicular transport to and from the cell membrane
is required for the release or accumulation of
molecules by the cell, as well as the redistribution
of the lipid bilayer:
. Exocytosis is the process by which vesicles fuse
with the cell membrane releasing their contents
into the external environment. Exocytosis is also
important for the contribution of a vesicle-
derived bilayer and membrane-associated pro-
tein to the cell membrane.
. Endocytosis is the reverse of exocytosis, whereby
vesicles are generated on the surface of the cell.
This allows the recovery of membrane or cell sur-
face proteins from the cell surface or, through the
aggregation of receptor-bound molecules, the
transport of speciﬁc molecules into the cell. Two
distinct forms of receptor-mediated endocytosis
exist:
– pinocytosis results from the ingestion of small
vesicles, typically 100 nm in diameter; pinocy-
tosis can occur in all cell types
– phagocytosis is the ingestion of large particles
into specialised vesicles, known as phago-
somes; this process is restricted to a few
specialised cell types and allows the uptake of
particles that may be over 1 mm in size.
DEFINITION Clathrin-mediated
transport
Clathrin is a protein associated with the formation
of endocytic vesicles. It binds to the membrane
proteins via a series of speciﬁc adapter proteins.
The clathrin molecules interact with each other
to form a lattice structure that progressively
deforms the membrane into a vesicle. Formation
of the vesicle allows it to bud from the mem-
brane, at which point the clathrin coat dissoci-
ates and the vesicle travels to the endosomal
compartment.
Transcytosis
Epithelial cells are found at barriers between
the body and the environment. There is often
a necessity to transport molecules from one side
of the cell to the other. This process is mediated by
speciﬁc receptors that trigger receptor-mediated
endocytosis of the target molecules and their
transport to the endosomal compartment. Mole-
cules are then transported to the other side of the
cell by exocytosis.
Secretion
Two major secretory pathways have evolved to
regulate the secretion of proteins from the cell:
1 Theconstitutivesecretorypathwayispresentin
all cells. This is the default secretory pathway
that targets proteins to the cell membrane, if
they do not possess a signal that targets them
elsewhere.
2 The regulated secretory pathway is seen only in
cells specialised for secretion – such as in neu-
rons or hormone-secreting cells. Such cells tend
to produce large amounts of their secretory
product and store them in secretory granules.
Cell division and the
cell cycle
Everyonedevelopsfromasinglezygoteasaresultof
cell division, differentiation and cell death. During
the proliferation required for this development,
cells divide to produce two daughter cells that con-
tainthefullcomplementofchromosomes–diploid
cells. This form of cell division is named mitosis.
During reproduction, a sperm and an ovum,
which express only one copy of each chromosome,
must fuse to produce a zygote that bears a full
complement of 46 chromosomes. The production
of the haploid cells that contain only one copy of
each chromosome is essential for reproduction,
and occurs by meiosis.
Some cells are constantly replenished through-
out an individual’s life as a result of cell division,
e.g. epithelial cells are constantly sloughed off as a
result of wear and tear and must be replenished by
the division of stem cells and their differentiation.
The cell cycle
The life of the cell can be described in the cell cycle,
which is split into four stages: G1, M, G2 and
S. Cells may also leave the cell cycle and become
Cell biology 7

non-dividing differentiated cells, G0, or through
cell death (Fig. 1.2):
. G1 and G2 reﬂect the parts of the cell cycle where
the cells are not dividing and there is no synthesis
of DNA. This is the period in which cells spend
the most time.
. The S stage of the cycle is the period during which
DNA is synthesised.
. The M stage of the cycle is the point at which cell
division occurs.
Cell division
There are structures and features of meiosis and
mitosis that are common to both, and reﬂect key
processes in cell division:
. The aggregation of chromosomes must occur
after DNA replication. The DNA becomes tightly
packaged so that each chromosome becomes
easily distinguishable.
. Migration of the centrioles to opposite ends of
the cell is essential to form the spindle. These
structures are made up of microtubules and
exhibit a nine plus two arrangement: nine pairs
of microtubules arranged in a circle around an
additional two microtubules.
Mitosis
Mitosis occurs as a series of stages. As mitosis is
a dynamic process the determination of when one
stage becomes the next is difﬁcult; however, there
are certain key features that can be identiﬁed at
each stage of mitosis (Fig. 1.3):
. Interphase – the period during which the cell is
not dividing. During this period the chromo-
somes exist in their normal disaggregated state.
. Prophase – the ﬁrst stage of replication. The
centrioles migrate to the poles and the spindle
begins to form. The nuclear envelope begins to
break down and the DNA condenses such that
the individual chromosomes are visible.
. Metaphase – the chromosomes align along the
centre of the cell,wherethey attachtothe spindle.
. Anaphase – the spindle pulls the chromosome,
such that one chromatid from each chromo-
some migrates to each pole. The cytoplasm
begins to contract as the cells start to divide.
. Telophase – the cells become two separate
daughter cells, as cleavage of the cytoplasm is
completed.
After mitosis the cells return to the G1 phase of the
cell cycle.
Meiosis
Meiosis generates haploid cells, which contain
only one of each pair of chromosomes. This pro-
cess occurs through two special cell divisions that
produce four haploid (1n) cells from a single parent
diploid cell (2n).

Figure 1.2 The cell cycle. The cell cycle consists of
four phases that occur in sequence. Mitosis occurs in
the M phase and is followed by the G1 phase. The cell
spends most of its time in this phase, although the
length of the phase may vary depending on the cell.
The S phase is the point at which the synthesis of DNA
occurs, so that each chromosome is made up of two
identical chromatids and is followed by a short G2
phase before the cell division. This cycle can continue,
or the cell may exit the cycle into G0 when it is fully
differentiated and not considered part of the cell cycle.
However, rarely, cells may re-enter the cycle from G0.
Cells may also leave the cell cycle through cell death.
DEFINITION The spindle
The spindle is a microtubule structure associated
with cell division. The microtubules are organised
by two centrioles, which are positioned at either
end of the cell and form a network of microtubules
between them. This spindle becomes associated
with the chromosomes and regulates their move-
ment to the opposite poles of the cell, ensuring
that the correct chromosome complement occurs
with both mitotic and meiotic cell division.

Interphase
During interphase, the cells are at rest. For 
ease only two pairs of chromosome are 
represented within the cells.
Prophase
During prophase, the processes that occur 
during meiosis and mitosis are very similar. 
The spindle starts to form, following the 
migration of the centrioles, and the nuclear 
envelope starts to degrade. The chromosomes 
start to aggregate.
Metaphase
The crucial difference between the two forms of 
cell division is that within mitosis the chromo-
somes align on the equator of the cell. During 
meiosis the chromosomes match up in their 
homologous pairs, such that one of each 
chromosome pair is situated either side of the 
equator. 
Anaphase
The spindle pulls the chromosomes to the 
poles. In mitosis, one chromatid from each 
chromosome is pulled to either pole, whereas, 
in meiosis, one chromosome from each 
chromosome pair is pulled, halving the number 
of chromosomes in the daughter cells. 
Contraction of the cytoplasm occurs during 
anaphase.
Telophase
Separation of the cells is completed and the 
nuclear structures start to reform. In meiosis, 
however, a second round of cell division occurs 
immediately; meiosis II is similar to mitosis and 
completes the production of four haploid cells 
from a single diploid cell.
Figure 1.3 Mitosis and Meiosis. The two different forms of cell division have similar steps. Whilst mitosis
produces two identical daughter cells, meiosis produces two cells with half the number of chromosomes of its
parent cell.
Cell biology 9

Meiosis I
The ﬁrst division in meiosis results in the separa-
tion of homologous chromosomes after the repli-
cation of the DNA to produce chromosomes that
have two chromatids, as for mitosis. The resultant
division is referred to as ‘reduction division’ be-
cause it reduces the number of chromosomes in
the cell from 46 to 23:
. Prophase I – the chromosomes condense and
then pair up with their homologous chromo-
somes such that one chromosome of each
homologous pair lies on either side of the midline
of the cell. At this stage recombination between
the homologous chromosomes may occur as
a result of ‘crossing over’.
. Anaphase I – as a result of the random division of
maternal and paternal chromosomes one either
side of the midline, the separation of the
chromosomes
leads
to
each
daughter
cell
possessing one chromosome from each pair,
although it is random whether each chromo-
some is maternally or paternally derived.
Meiosis II
The second division in meiosis closely resembles
mitosis. Each of the chromosomes aligns on the
midline of the cell, and the chromatids separate to
the poles. The result of the two divisions of meiosis
istheformationoffourdaughtercells,eachwithhalf
the chromosome complement of their parent cells.
DEFINITION Chromosome structure
For most of the cell cycle, chromosomes are
diffusely distributed in the nucleus; however, during
cell division they become tightly condensed.
Although the molecular mechanisms underlying
this packaging are covered in detail in Chapter 2,
the gross structure is important to the process of cell
division. The tightly packaged chromosome con-
sists of two identical chromatids. These are joined
together at a region known as the centromere.
During the anaphase of mitosis and meiosis the
chromosomes or chromatids are pulled to the poles
by the spindle:
. Separation of chromatids results in the production
of two identical daughter cells.
. Separation of chromosome pairs results in the
movement of both chromatids to the same pole.
This occurs in meiosis I to generate a haploid cells.
Cell differentiation
Cells may leave the cell cycle and become differ-
entiated, expressing speciﬁc patterns of genes
such that the cells can perform a particular func-
tion. The genes expressed result in speciﬁc protein
complements, e.g. in nerve cells, they will be very
different from those in a muscle cell.
The zygote is totipotent and has the potential to
become any cell in the body or placenta. The po-
tency of a cell decreases as it becomes pluripotent,
capable of generating a wide variety of cell types,
althoughnotall(e.g.ahaematopoieticstemcellcan
generate all types of blood cell, but is unable to
generate other tissues, such as epithelium or ner-
vous tissue). Finally, a cell becomes unipotent
when it is irreversibly committed to a single fate.
Regulation of differentiation
Differentiation is regulated by various develop-
mental signals received by the cell from its sur-
rounding environment (e.g. signalling molecules
such as transforming growth factor b (TGF-b))
which interact with the existing pattern of gene
expression in the cell.
Cell growth
Cells in the body, and the tissues that contain
them, may grow and shrink in response to stimuli,
while remaining at the same stage of differentia-
tion. Both atrophy (the reduction in size of a tissue)
and hypertrophy (the growth in size) are physio-
logical occurrences, although they may also occur
pathologically.
Atrophy
The progressive reduction in the size of a tissue or
organ – atrophy – is an important process during
development. Shortly after birth, the ductus arter-
iosus must decrease to prevent blood bypassing
the lungs; the tissue then atrophies, forming the
ligamentum arteriosum.
Many pathologies are associated with a decrease
in size of an organ or tissue, which may represent
a generalised effect or be speciﬁc to a tissue.
Generalised atrophy can occur as a result of
chronic starvation and can also be seen in the ad-
vanced stages of malignant disease (e.g. cachexia).
10
Cell biology

CLINICAL Cachexia
Cachexia is associated with a variety of chronic
diseases, and is characterised by loss of weight,
weakness and a generalised deterioration of the
condition of the body. The mechanism underlying
cachexia is thought to be associated with the high
levels of cytokines and hormones.
Tissue-speciﬁc atrophy reﬂects changes affect-
ing a speciﬁc tissue or organ system in the body,
and is due to changes directly affecting that organ,
e.g. skeletal muscles atrophy if they are not used;
the size of the individual myocytes (and therefore
the force that the muscle can generate) reduces
rapidly.
Atrophy restricted to a speciﬁc tissue or site can
be the result of a variety of causes, including:
. Ischaemia – lack of blood ﬂow and related
nutrients to nourish the tissue
. Disuse
. Neuropathy – lack of nervous impulse to stimu-
late the tissue
. Idiopathic.
Increased growth
The increased growth of a tissue can be broken
down into hyperplasia (increase in cell number)
and hypertrophy (increase in cell size). Both occur
physiologically in response to external stimuli and
are usually reversible when the external stimulus
is withdrawn.
Hypertrophy
Hypertrophy is commonly seen where there is
relatively little cell turnover (e.g. muscle). It can
also occur in response to a pathological change in
another part of the body, e.g. in aortic stenosis the
left ventricle is required to work harder to over-
come the additional pressure cause by the con-
striction; as a result left ventricular hypertrophy
occurs.
Hypertrophy may become a pathological pro-
cess: in those who exercise, generalised cardiac
hypertrophy is often seen. However, the coronary
circulation may not develop sufﬁciently rapidly to
respond to the additional tissue mass. Athletic
heart syndrome may occur in young individuals,
in whom there is a sudden failure of the coronary
circulation to adequately supply the myocardium.
Here what was initially a physiologically advanta-
geous hypertrophy has developed into a patholog-
ical condition.
Hyperplasia
Increased growth through an increase in cell
numbers is commonly seen in tissues that are
constantly being renewed. This allows an in-
crease in production of the required terminally
differentiated cell, e.g. increased production of
red blood cells in those exposed to chronic
hypoxic conditions. Hyperplasia is often seen
in endocrine tissues, when increased produc-
tion of a hormone associated with that tissue is
needed.
Cancer
There may be changes in a cell that contribute to its
excessive multiplication. This change, neoplasia,
is different to the changes seen in hyperplasia,
because there is no useful function attributed to
the cell growth – the cells involved will often have
an abnormal histological appearance. The growth
is rarely reversible. Cancerous growth is a serious
cause of death – it is currently the second biggest
killer in Britain – and can occur in almost every
tissue in the body. Tumours may be deﬁned as
benign or malignant.
Benign tumours
Benign tumours are well deﬁned from the sur-
rounding tissue and often encapsulated. They are
frequently harmless because they do not spread
to other sites and in rare cases (e.g. skin warts)
may regress. Benign tumours may cause illness as
a result of local and systemic effects:
. Local effects may result from the occupation
of space, generating pressure on a location
(e.g. intracranial tumours pressing on the brain).
Similarly, tumours may obstruct crucial vessels
or ducts, restricting blood ﬂow depending on
their location.
. Systemic effects may occur in hormone-secret-
ing tumours, e.g. a phaeochromocytoma is an
adrenaline-secreting tumour that leads to severe
hypertension.
Cell biology 11

Malignant tumours
Malignant tumours are distinguished from benign
tumours because they directly invade the host
tissue. They can spread rapidly, and may produce
metastases in distant sites. The cells in malignant
tumours
are
usually
less
well
differentiated
than benign tumours and are often made up of
histologically abnormal cells, showing features of
stem cells.
Spread of malignant tumours
Local invasion into the tissue surrounding the
tumour may be aided by the de-differentiation of
the cells:
. They express altered adhesion molecules; this
has two effects to:
– increase dissociation and release from the pri-
mary tumour
– promote adherence to the seeding site in new
tissue.
. They secrete enzymes to degrade the extracellu-
lar matrix.
. The reduced dependence of the tumour for
growth factors (which are often tissue-speciﬁc)
aid its survival and proliferation.
There are a variety of routes through which a
malignant tumour may spread into local tissue:
. Direct invasion into tissue
. Growth into a body cavity
. Growth along a fascial plane
. Growth into blood or lymphatic vessels – this
process can contribute to the formation of
metastases.
Metastasis
Metastasis is the generation of secondary tumours
at distant sites. This form of spread is found only in
malignant tumours and is often associated with
a very poor prognosis. There are three main routes
through which metastases can occur:
1 Cells may enter the bloodstream and lodge in
a remote tissue site.
2 Lymphatic involvement can lead to cells enter-
ing the lymph nodes and from there entering the
bloodstream
3 Tumour cells may seed in body cavities; they
may grow in suspension in ﬂuid within the cavity
and from there seed to a distant organ.
The distribution of metastases will often reﬂect
the location of the primary tumour and the route
of spread. Locations of metastatic growth also
rely on speciﬁc interactions between the tumour
and the tissue, which contributes to the speciﬁc
locations favoured by particular tumours, e.g. mel-
anomas typically form metastases in the liver
or brain.
The liver is a common site of metastases for most
tumours (except brain tumours); this is thought to
be due to its rich blood supply to carry cells, and
also due to the expression of many growth factors
that aid the survival and promote the proliferation
of metastatic tumour cells.
The local effects of metastases are similar to the
local effect for other tumours, although, as they are
disseminated and invasive, destruction of the host
tissue as a result of the outgrowth of the metastases
also occurs.
The genetic basis of malignancy
Tumours occur as a result of the accumulated
genetic changes within a cell that lead to its de-
differentiation
and
uncontrolled
proliferation.
These
changes
require
the
loss
of
tumour-
suppressor genes and the activation of oncogenes.
Tumours are generally the result of malignant
changes in a single cell, reﬂecting the rarity of
the events.
Asalongperiodoftime isrequired forsuchevents
to occur, most tumours become more common
with age – as the pro-malignant changes develop.
There are a variety of factors and stimuli that have
been identiﬁed to increase the likelihood of cancer:
. Chemical stimuli can increased the risk of
cancer by damaging DNA, e.g. smoking is linked
with the occurrence of lung cancer.
. A variety of physical stimuli has been identiﬁed
that promotes malignant changes:
– ionising radiation (e.g. X-rays) causes single-
stranded breaks in DNA; if such damage is
incorrectly repaired by cellular mechanisms,
it may contribute to cancer
– ultraviolet (UV) light can promote base
changes in the DNA; UV commonly leads to
cytosine conversion to the RNA base uracil;
DNA repair mechanisms, however, recognise
the uracil as incorrect and will replace it with
a thymine base. The exposure to UV light
has been linked with an increased risk of de-
veloping skin cancer.
12
Cell biology

. Trauma has been implicated in cancer, because
the increased cell growth may promote malig-
nant changes. This is extremely rarely seen in the
development of skin cancers at burn sites.
There are a number of tumours that are asso-
ciated with childhood and for which the fre-
quency decreases with age. These tumours are
likely to affect young people for one of two
main reasons:
. The tumour is derived from a stem cell, the
number of which decrease as the individual ages.
. The
individual
has
inherited
a
mutation
associated
with
the
development
of
the
tumour (e.g. the Wilms’ tumour gene is associ-
ated with the development of renal cancer in
children).
Oncogenes
Oncogenes are genes that are often activated in
cancerous cells. These genes have a physiological
role during development; however, their inappro-
priate expression can lead to uncontrolled prolif-
eration. Oncogenes may be activated as a result of
a variety of changes:
. Mutations in the genes may alter the nature
or activity of the protein product, which can
contribute to malignant changes within the
cell, e.g. the molecule CD117 is a receptor
for cytokine stem cell factor and signalling
through it stimulates cell survival and prolif-
eration. Mutation of this protein so that it
signals without binding its ligand is associated
with the development of cancer, in particular
leukaemia and some forms of testicular germ
cell cancer.
. Over-expression of a gene can lead to cancerous
changes. This may be seen as the result of
a
chromosomal
translocation,
leading
the
oncogene to become translocated to a site on
a different chromosome that is highly expressed.
The ‘Philadelphia translocation’ is associated
with many leukaemias and results from a trans-
location between chromosome 9 and chromo-
some 22.
Tumour-suppressor genes
The activation of oncogenes in not sufﬁcient to
result in malignancy. In most cases tumorigenesis
also requires loss of tumour-suppressor genes.
These genes are often associated with DNA repair
or regulation of the cell cycle, preventing damaged
cells proliferating.
A commonly lost tumour-suppressor gene is
p53, which is involved in regulating the entry of
cells into the cell cycle. It acts to detect DNA
damage, preventing damaged cells from entering
the cell cycle.
Several changes are required in an individual cell
for malignancy to result. Many oncogenes must be
activated and several tumour-suppressor genes
must be lost. This is known as the ‘multi-step
theory of malignancy’.
Infectious causes of cancer
There are speciﬁc viral infections that have been
established as causing cancer – in particular, the
human papillomaviruses (HPVs). The production
of viral proteins is aided by the proliferation of
cells; HPVs inactivate a number of tumour-
suppressor genes (e.g. p53) so increasing the entry
of cells into the cell cycle to aid replication of HPV,
although at the same time this can lead to tumour
formation. Most HPV strains are associated with
warts, although others are associated with more
serious conditions such as cervical cancers – in
particular HPV-16 and HPV-18.
Infectious diseases may cause an increased risk
of cancer through repeated damage to a tissue –
repeated replication of the tissue can increase the
likelihood of errors occurring during DNA repli-
cation, and thus enhance the risk of malignant
changes. This is illustrated by hepatitis B infec-
tion;
chronic
carriers
are
at
an
increased
risk of primary hepatocellular carcinoma due to
the constant damage and regeneration of the
liver as a result of the immune response against
the infection.
Treatment of cancer
Treatment of tumours focuses on destruction or
removal of the neoplastic cells from the body.
Three methods may be used:
1 Surgical excision of the tumour
2 Radiotherapy to destroy localised tumours
3 Chemotherapy to destroy tumour cells and treat
metastases, because they cannot be removed
adequately by surgical/radiotherapeutic means.
Cell biology 13

Mechanisms of chemotherapy
Chemotherapy targets features of the cells that
are different from normal differentiated cells,
primarily through targeting dividing cells. This
contributes to the high toxicity, because many
stem cells in the body are also affected. Despite
the severe side effects, chemotherapy is the only
method that can effectively target metastatic
cancer. The drugs used in chemotherapy act in
a variety of manners to promote the destruction
of cancerous cells:
. Alkylating agents (e.g. cisplatin) bind to and
cross-link DNA to prevent further replication of
the tumour cells.
. Antimetabolites (e.g. methotrexate) replace key
components in the synthesis of DNA or RNA.
Methotrexate blocks the synthesis of purine
bases. However, this action also contributes to
the side effects of the drug, such as myelosup-
pression and nephrotoxicity.
. Antitumour antibiotics act primarily through
binding to DNA to prevent its uncoiling, which
leads to breakage of the helix and inhibits repli-
cation of the cells. Such drugs (e.g. doxorubicin)
may also inhibit topoisomerases.
. Spindle
tubule
inhibitors
(e.g.
vincristine)
destroy
microtubules,
preventing
spindle
formation that is required for the chromosome
segregation in cell division. Similar to other
chemotherapy agents, they are associated with
severe side effects of nephrotoxicity and bone
marrow suppression.
Monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy
Owing to their de-differentiated state, many
malignant cancers express molecules that are not
seen commonly in adult individuals (although they
may be expressed during embryonic development
and early life). These molecules, if expressed on
the cell surface, may be used to target the cancer
speciﬁcally (e.g. Herceptin targets HER2 which is
expressed on some breast cancers).

Molecular biology
and genetics
The human genome contains all the informa-
tion necessary to generate all the components
of the human body; it is found in almost every
cell in the body. This information is encoded
through the four different nucleotide types in
deoxyribonucleic
acid
(DNA).
DNA
contains
functional units known as genes, which encode
protein or nucleic acid molecules with a speciﬁc
function.
The process by which a gene is converted into its
product is well established, as are the mechanisms
that regulate the expression of a gene. Changes to a
gene, or deletions of parts of the genome, can result
in disease, through changes to the proteins
produced.
DNA and genes
The basic unit of genetic information is the
gene. Genes are stretches of DNA that encode
protein or RNA molecules with a speciﬁc func-
tion (or group of functions). The DNA in a cell
(in almost every case) is the same as the
DNA found in the zygote and possesses all
the genetic information for creating a complete
organism; the ability to reliably copy DNA to
ensure accurate transmission of the genome is
aided by the structure of DNA and its method of
replication.
Structure of nucleic acids
DNA and RNA are made up of chains of nucleotides
that are linked together to form a long continuous
molecule. Each nucleotide base has common ele-
ments (Fig. 2.1):
. A phosphate group
. A deoxyribose (in DNA) or a ribose (in RNA) sugar
. A base group made up of carbon–nitrogen
rings; there are two types of bases used in nucleic
acids:
– purine bases (adenine and guanine) are made
up of two carbon–nitrogen rings. The bases differ
in the side chains attached to the rings
– pyrimidine bases (cytosine and thymine) are
made up of a single carbon–nitrogen ring; the
different pyrimidine bases also have different
side chains.
The bases are the only part of the nucleotides that
vary, and this variation stores information in the
genetic code.
The precursors for DNA synthesis are the deox-
ynucleotide triphosphates. During DNA synthesis
two phosphate groups are removed so that only a
single phosphate group is incorporated into DNA.
The phosphate group forms a covalent bond with
the 30-carbon atom on the next nucleotide,

Figure 2.1 The structure of nucleotides. The nucleotides within DNA contain sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate
units. The nucleotide is distinguished by the base that is attached to the sugar. The body utilises adenine and
guanine, purine bases, and thymine and cytosine, pyrimidine bases. Within RNA, the sugar (ribose) found in
the nucleotides possesses a hydroxyl group on its 20-carbon. In addition, uracil is used instead of thymine.
Polymerisation of the bases is through the formation of a bond between a phosphate group on the 50-carbon, and the
hydroxyl group on the 30-carbon of a different nucleotide.
16
Molecular biology and genetics

resulting in a string of 30,50-phosphodiester bonds.
This occurs throughout the DNA molecule, with
the exception of the ﬁrst and last bases; this allows
distinction between the two ends of the DNA
molecule:
1 The ﬁrst base has a 50-phosphate not bonded to
any other nucleotide – the 50 end of the DNA.
2 The last base has a free 30-hydroxyl group
not bonded to a phosphate – the 30 end of the
DNA.
A base can form different numbers of hydrogen
bonds
with
one
speciﬁc
base
on
another
‘complementary’ nucleic acid strand. This process
is known as ‘base pairing’:
. Adenine always pairs with thymine through two
hydrogen bonds.
. Guanine and cytosine are always paired through
three hydrogen bonds.
DNA is arranged in two strands that are
complementary
to
each
other.
The
two
strands run in opposite directions – one runs
from 50 to 30, whereas the other runs 30 to 50;
the bases from the two strands form hydro-
gen bonds with each other’s complementary
bases.
The double-helical structure of DNA
The
complete
DNA
molecule
is
twisted,
forming a double helix, with around 10 nu-
cleotides in each complete turn of the mol-
ecule. The double-helical structure has two
grooves in which the bases are accessible
from outside the molecule: a narrow minor
groove and the wider major groove – an
important site for the binding of proteins to
speciﬁc sequences.
Genomic organisation
A complete copy of the human genome contains
around
3  109
nucleotides.
This
DNA
must
be tightly packaged in the nucleus of the cell
through the association of DNA with histones
and other structural proteins. Most cells are hap-
loid, possessing two complete copies of the ge-
nome, one from the mother and one from the
father. There are three groups of cells that do not
contain two complete copies of the human
genome:
. Cells that lack a nucleus (e.g. red blood cells)
. The gametes, which possess a haploid nucleus
with effectively a single copy of the genome
. Lymphocytes, which undergo a recombination
of speciﬁc genes during their development.
Chromosomes
DNA is grouped into molecules known as chromo-
somes. In humans, there are 46 chromosomes.
These chromosomes are arranged into 23 pairs,
where one is maternally derived and the other
paternally derived, which can be identiﬁed by
karyotyping. Twenty-two pairs are the autosomal
chromosomes, normally containing the same
genes. The ﬁnal pair of chromosomes is the sex
chromosomes:
. Females have two X chromosomes, one from
each parent.
. Males inherit one X and one Y chromosome – the
Y chromosome is derived from the father and
contains the genes required to regulate the de-
velopment of a male child.
A single X chromosome is required by both
sexes to be viable, whereas the Y chromosome
encodes genes allowing the development of male
characteristics.
The X and Y chromosomes possess a small
region that is homologous (around 2.5 million
bases (Mb)), which encodes those genes where
both male and female individuals require two
copies.
DEFINITION Karyotyping
Chromosomes are identiﬁed in a process called
karyotyping. Cells from an individual are isolated
and drugs are used to halt the cell cycle during cell
division, so that the highly condensed structures of
the chromosomes are identiﬁable. Staining the
chromosomes on the slides results in speciﬁc band-
ing patterns, which are unique to a chromosome
pair. The absence, or duplication in particular, of the
pattern allows the identiﬁcation of abnormalities and
missing portions of chromosome, through abnormal
patterns.
Molecular biology and genetics 17

Structure of chromosomes
A single chromosome is made up of two identical
chromatids joined by a centromere. The position
of the centromere along the length of the chromo-
some creates two arms – one short and one long
arm. Chromosomes can be classiﬁed based on the
location of their centromere. Three such classes
are deﬁned (Fig. 2.2):
. Metacentric. The centromere is located close
to the centre of the chromatids.
. Submetacentric. The centromere of the chro-
mosomes is located off-centre.
. Acrocentric. The
centromere
of
the
chro-
mosome
is
located
near
one
end
of
the
chromosome.

DNA
The two strands of DNA associate as a result of the 
hydrogen bonds formed between the complementary 
bases. 
DNA forms a double-helix structure, which is then 
coiled around histone proteins to form a nucleosome, 
with the H1 histone protein binding to the regions of 
DNA between the nucleosomes. The nucleosomes 
then mediate the aggregation into 30nM fibres.
The 30nM fibres of DNA can be assembled by 
scaffold proteins into higher-order packing within the 
chromosome.
Chromosome
The chromosomes are usually found to be decon-
densed and not visible within the cell. During cell 
division they condense and can be easily 
distinguished by light microscopy. The chromosome 
consists of two identical chromatids, which are linked 
by a centromere – the point of attachment to the 
spindle.
Based on the proximity of the centromere to the 
telomeres (the ends) of the chromosomes, three 
classes of chromosomes can be identified. In the 
metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes, there 
are large numbers of genes found in the shorter arms. 
Within the acrocentric chromosomes, the short arms 
contain junk DNA and copies of the ribosomal genes 
(of which there are many copies within the genome).
Figure 2.2 Chromatin and chromosomes.
18
Molecular biology and genetics

The location of speciﬁc regions in the chromosome
is labelled in reference to morphological markers,
e.g. the banding patterns produced in staining.
. Locations on the short arm are labelled ‘p’ (petit)
and those on the long arm ‘q’ The chromosome
arms are divided into smaller regions labelled p1,
p2, q1, q2, etc. The numbers of the regions count
outwards from the centromere.
. Regions
are
further
subdivided
into
bands
labelled p11, p12, p13, etc. (p one–one, etc.).
Smaller resolution is then achieved through
further subdivision, e.g. p11.1, p11.2, etc.
Chromosomes exist as a single chromatid for
most of the cell cycle – the second chromatid is
produced during the S phase of the cell cycle,
and separation of the chromatids occurs during
mitosis, and during meiosis II. The arms of the
chromosomeareonlyeasilyvisibleduringthestages
of cell division, where they are highly condensed.
During the rest of the cell cycle, the chromosomes
are in a more ‘open’, decondensed state, and are not
distinguishable by microscopy.
Chromatin
DNA is tightly packaged around protein to form a
condensed form of DNA known as chromatin. The
modiﬁcation of the packaging proteins, as well as
the DNA, alters the packaging, which is an impor-
tant mechanism to allow the regulation of the
expression of genes (Fig. 2.2).
The best understood packaging mechanism is
that of the histone proteins, which are the most
numerous of DNA packing proteins. There are ﬁve
distinct types of histone protein: H1, H2a, H2b, H3
and H4:
. Two molecules each of H2a, H2b, H3 and H4
form a nucleosome around which DNA can wind
nearly two times.
. Between nucleosomes are regions of ‘linker
DNA’ to which the H1 proteins bind. These H1
proteins are thought tobe involved inhigher level
organisation of the chromatin.
The nucleosomes are not ﬁxed to the DNA and
their location can change. In addition, the histone
proteins possess long tails, which can wrap around
the DNA to reduce its accessibility. The histone
tails can be modiﬁed by the covalent addition or
removal of various groups, which can allow the
histone tails to become more or less attached to the
DNA.
The
enzyme
histone
acetyltransferase
(HAT), which acetylates histone tails, has a well-
understood
mechanism.
This
promotes
their
association with the DNA, typically inhibiting
expression of genes in that region.
Higher organisation of chromatin
A series of different levels of organisation of the
DNA occur, following the packaging of DNA on to
nucleosomes:
. Nucleosomes are packaged together to produce a
series of ﬁbres around 30 nm in size. It is thought
that this package takes the form of a spiral,
whereby H1 proteins form a rod-like structure
down the centre of the spiral.
. The 30-nm ﬁbres are packaged into loops by
‘scaffold proteins’. These structures allow re-
gions of DNA to be rapidly decondensed, allow-
ing proteins to gain access to the DNA. The loops
allow distant parts of the chromosome to inter-
act, such that genes with similar functions and
roles can be concentrated in a small spatial area
of the cell, along with any protein factors that
may modulate their expression.
. Speciﬁc regions of chromatin may be attached to
structures within the nucleus, such as the nucle-
olus, which is associated with the production of
ribosomal RNA.
The density of the packaging of chromatin in the
cell can reﬂect the transcriptional activity of the
DNA. Through their packaging, chromatin is
classed into two broad categories: euchromatin
and heterochromatin. In particular, one copy of
the X chromosome is sufﬁcient for the cell’s tran-
scriptional needs (as illustrated in males, who have
only a single X chromosome); in females, one copy
of the X chromosome is usually densely packaged,
forming the Barr body.
DEFINITION Euchromatin and
heterochromatin
There are two broad classes of chromatin, in relation
to how densely they are packaged:
. Euchromatin makes up most of the chromatin in a
cell and is relatively loosely packaged.
. Heterochromatin is much more densely pack-
aged, and is typically located close to the nuclear
envelope. It is thought that transcription factors
can less easilybindtothe DNA in heterochromatin,
reducing expression of the genes that it contains.
Molecular biology and genetics 19

Other elements within the genome
Only 1–10% of the human genome has been
identiﬁed as encoding genes. However, recent es-
timates suggest that around 70% of the human
genome is transcribed. Extragenic DNA refers to
those regions of DNA that are not part of genes.
Some of these regions have been classiﬁed and, in
some cases, a function has been found:
. Satellite DNA consists of large series of short
repeated sequences of DNA and are clustered
around the centromeres.
. Minisatellite DNA is made up of two types of
element:
– telomeric DNA is found at the telomeres
and consists of the same repeating sequence
of six base-pairs which aids the replication
of chromosomes without the loss of genetic
information.
– hypervariable minisatellite DNA is made up
of polymorphic repeating patterns of a short
nucleotide sequence (typically around 10–100
base-pairs in length).
. Microsatellite DNA consists of repeats of one to
six nucleotides. The number of repeats is highly
variable between individuals, although it is often
stable between parents and children, and forms
the basis of DNA proﬁling
Microsatellite
and
minisatellite
DNA
are
together referred to as variable nucleotide tandem
repeats.
Highly repeated interspersed repetitive DNA
sequences are found throughout the non-coding
region of the genome, and make up around a
third of the whole genome. The function of these
elements is not well understood, although they
have been suggested to have roles in disease.
Two main classes of these elements have been
identiﬁed:
1 Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs)
make up around 5% of the human genome and
are typically around 300 base-pairs (bp) in
length.ThemostcommonareAlurepeats,which
contain a repeat sequence that can be cut by the
restriction enzyme Alu I.
2 Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs)
are much longer regions of DNA – typically
around 6000 bp per repeat. The most common
example is the LINE-1 sequence, which resem-
bles the sequence of a retrovirus and encodes a
reverse transcriptase.
Genes may be found as single or multiple copies:
. Single-copy genes are the normal form of genes.
They code for a speciﬁc polypeptide, such as
enzymes, receptors.
. Multiple-copy genes usually encode products
that must be expressed rapidly. This permits the
rapid production of huge numbers of mRNA
transcripts, thus allowing rapid generation of the
protein product. This is particularly evident with
the histone genes where many copies of the
protein must be synthesised rapidly during DNA
replication.
DNA replication
The replication of DNA in eukaryotes is mediated
by DNA polymerase, which catalyses the stepwise
addition of deoxyribonucleotides to the 30 end of
the DNA chain. There are four requirements for
replication:
. A DNA template, from which a copy can be made.
. The presence of all four precursor nucleoside
triphosphates
. A primer (a small sequence of RNA complemen-
tary to the DNA template) to start the process, to
which nucleotides can be added.
. Mg2 þ ions are also required for the appropriate
function of DNA polymerase.
The polymerase recognises the next base in the
template strand and adds acomplementary base to
the 30 end of the nascent DNA molecule. In this
process, two phosphates are released and a 30,50-
phosphodiester bond is created. This stepwise
process is repeated along the length of the mole-
cule, to generate a new copy of the DNA template
in a 50 to 30 direction.
RNA Primers
DNA polymerase requires a primer sequence to
initiate DNA elongation. Each primer is a short
stretch of RNA that is synthesised by the enzyme
primase. The RNA primer is extended by DNA
polymerase on both the leading and the lagging
strands. After synthesis, the RNA primers are re-
moved by the exonuclease activity of DNA poly-
merase I which then synthesises DNA to ﬁll in the
gaps that have been left. The DNA fragments are
then joined by DNA ligase.
20
Molecular biology and genetics

Okazaki fragments
Synthesis of DNA occurs in a 50 to 30 direction; it
cannot occur in a 30 to 50 direction. As a result, one
strand of DNA can be elongated as a single con-
tinuous piece of DNA; this is known as the leading
strand. On the other strand (known as the lagging
strand), the complementary DNA is synthesised as
a series of short segments (around 1000 nucleo-
tides in length). Each fragment requires its own
separate primer and the resulting fragments of
DNA are known as Okazaki fragments.
Other proteins involved in DNA
replication
Proteins, in addition to DNA polymerase, are re-
quired in replication to unwind and unpackage the
chromosome. This is achieved by three groups of
proteins:
1 DNA helicase unwinds DNA to produce two
single strands of DNA.
2 Single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) proteins
bind to single-stranded regions of unwound
DNA to prevent them rebinding. This allows the
DNA polymerases and other enzymes access to
the base sequence.
3 Topoisomerases: unwinding DNA can cause
other regions to become ‘supercoiled’ – over-
wound. To reduce this, topoisomerase I creates
a single-stranded break in the DNA, to allow the
DNA to rotate about the intact strand. Topo-
isomerase I can then reform the single-stranded
break.
After synthesis of the DNA, the two strands of DNA
may need to be separated. This is achieved by a
double-stranded DNA break, made transiently by
the enzyme topoisomerase II. Topoisomerase II
then re-joins the ends of the chromosome.
Proofreading during DNA replication
Proofreading mechanisms are crucial to ensure
that mistakes in the copying of the DNA do not
occur; such changes are likely to affect the survival
of the daughter cells – potentially leading to either
cell death or malignancy. Three mechanisms work
to reduce the error rate:
1 DNA polymerase ensures the ﬁdelity of replica-
tion because it relies on the higher-afﬁnity bind-
ing of a correct nucleotide to its complementary
base. Between the binding of the nucleotide and
the formation of the covalent bond, the DNA
polymerase undergoes a conformational change
that encourages the dissociation of an incorrect
nucleotide pairing.
2 Exonucleotide proofreading occurs when an
incorrect nucleotide is added during DNA syn-
thesis. A separate catalytic site exists in the DNA
polymerase that ‘proofreads’ the DNA sequence,
andremovesmismatchednucleotidesina30 to50
direction, until a correct match is reached. The
section is then re-synthesised in a 50 to 30
manner.
3 Strand-directed mismatch repair relies on the
semiconservative mode of DNA replication. The
presence of incorrectly matched bases can be
detected as distortions in the DNA helix, due to
the incorrect hydrogen bonding between the
non-complementary bases. The template strand
can be distinguished from its daughter strand,
due to the presence of nicks in the sugar–
phosphate backbone of the daughter strand.
The detection of an error triggers degradation
of the DNA from the ‘nick’ back to the site of
the error. The degraded region of DNA is then
re-synthesised.
DNA replication in eukaryotes must occur before
each cell division. In multicellular organisms, there
are differences in the length of the cell cycle with
different cell types. Some cells (e.g. nerve cells)
may enter G0 and stop dividing.
The process of DNA replication can be split into
a series of steps, similar to those in prokaryotic
cells:
. The initiation of replication by the splitting of
DNA strands.
. The assembly of the DNA polymerase complex
which mediates the replication process and the
production of RNA primers that allow the DNA
polymerases to add DNA to start the elongation
and replication of the DNA.
. The elongation of the new DNA strands through
the action of the DNA polymerase.
. The removal of the RNA primer fragments, their
replacement with DNA and the joining of the
DNA fragments, to produce a full length.
. Repackaging of the new DNA molecules with
histones and other associated proteins.
There are around 100 sites of initiation of replica-
tion on a single chromosome in eukaryotes, where
the large replication complexes bind during the S
phase of the cell cycle.
Molecular biology and genetics 21

Elongation of DNA
DNA replication in eukaryotes is always from 50 to
30 and the two strands are synthesised in slightly
different manners:
. The leading strand is synthesised as a complete
molecule.
. The lagging strand is synthesised as a series of
short ‘Okazaki fragments’, as sufﬁcient template
is exposed to 50 to 30 synthesis.
The DNA polymerase
DNA polymerase is an extremely error-free mech-
anism of copying, although initially it requires a
small RNA primer to allow it to initiate transcrip-
tion. Primers are around 10 nucleotides long and
are produced bythe enzyme DNA primase which is
found as asubunit on DNA polymerase a. Although
the leading strand requires only one such primer,
several will be required on the lagging strand – one
for each Okazaki fragment.
DNA polymerase recruits bases complemen-
tary to those in the template strands and then
catalyses the formation of the sugar–phosphate
bond to permit elongation. After generation of
the DNA chain, the RNA primers are replaced by
DNA through the action of the polymerase, and
the DNA fragments then joined by DNA ligase.
To ensure that the DNA polymerase remains
attached to the template and is not impeded
during replication, clamp proteins and topo-
isomerase enzymes ensure that the DNA poly-
merase is maintained attached to the DNA and
that it is untangled.
Clamp proteins
The DNA polymerase tends to dissociate rapidly
from the DNA molecule so that it can be recycled at
a different site. During replication, it must be held
on the strand by a ‘clamp’. This protein is made up
of two halves that assemble around the DNA mol-
ecule in an ATP-dependent process. This ring
structure is then able to move freely with the
polymerase.
Replication of telomeres
At the end of linear chromosomes there is no space
for primase to produce an RNA primer for the
lagging strand during replication – over the course
of several cell divisions DNA is progressively lost
from
the
chromosome
ends.
Telomeres,
the
regions at the end of chromosomes, contain a
repeating
six-nucleotide
sequence
GGGTTA,
which may repeat for 10 000 nucleotides. The en-
zyme telomerase is capable of binding and synthe-
sising new copies of the repeat using an RNA
template that is part of the enzyme itself, prevent-
ing loss of the chromosome ends during DNA
replication.
Telomeres ensure that the nucleotide sequences
encoding genes or regulatory elements are not
lost during cell divisions. However, in many tis-
sues, the telomerases are inactivated resulting in
loss of approximately 100 nucleotides with each
cell division. In normal cells this leads to cell
senescence where the cells withdraw from the cell
cycle before there is loss of information in the
genome.
Reformation of nucleosomes
During replication DNA is tightly packaged around
histone proteins, however theDNApolymerase and
associated machinery must pass through the his-
tones to synthesise new DNA. How this is achieved
is not clearly understood, though following synthe-
sis the nucleosomes remain predominantly with
the leading strand, which new nucleosomes are
assembled on the DNA molecules derived from the
lagging strand.
A huge number of histone proteins must be
produced to package the DNA. Around 20 sets of
histone-encoding genes, which encode for all ﬁve
proteins, have been identiﬁed at different sites in
the genome to enable rapid generation of RNA
transcripts.
While the resulting protein products are very
stable, the histone RNA itself is actually very un-
stable ensuring translation is rapidly stopped such
that unneeded histone proteins are not produced,
which would be a waste of the cell’s resources.
RNA and transcription
RNA has a very similar structure to DNA. It is made
up of a series of nucleotides joined by 30,50-phos-
phodiester bonds. There are two main differences
with DNA:
. The bases in RNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine
and uracil. Uracil has a very similar structure to
thymine and forms base-pairs with adenine.
22
Molecular biology and genetics

. The sugar in RNA is ribose rather than the de-
oxyribose seen in DNA.
RNA is typically single-stranded, but regions can
form where the RNA loops back on itself. Here
complementary base pairing can occur in the RNA
molecule to produce ‘hairpin’ secondary struc-
tures. The resulting double-stranded regions form
helices and may interact with each other to pro-
duce complex three-dimensional structures. The
resulting RNA molecules can have speciﬁc func-
tions themselves, and do not encode for protein.
These include the ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and the
transfer RNAs (tRNAs).
Transcription
The eukaryotic nucleus contains three distinct
forms of RNA polymerase that have speciﬁc
functions:
1 RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) is responsible for
the synthesis of rRNA in the nucleolus.
2 RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) mediates mRNA
synthesis.
3 RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III) synthesises
smaller RNAs, e.g. tRNA, and some rRNA.
The basic mechanism of transcription in eukar-
yotes is very similar to that in prokaryotes:
. Initiation is directed by a promoter site 50 to the
transcription initiation site.
. Transcription does not require a primer to start.
. Synthesis occurs 50 to 30.
Transcription of protein-encoding
genes
Protein-encoding
genes
are
transcribed
into
mRNA by RNA Pol II; the mechanisms by which
transcription occurs are similar to those in pro-
karyotic cells. Other forms of RNA are transcribed
by different polymerase complexes and are dis-
cussed later in the chapter.
Structure of protein-encoding genes
The protein-encoding genes of eukaryotes are
made up of two distinct regions:
1 Exons encode amino acid sequences that will
produce a protein product.
2 Introns are regions of the gene that do not code
for proteins; they separate the exons and are
removed in the post-transcriptional processing
of the RNA.
During transcription a pre-mRNA contains all
the introns and exons of the gene. This is processed
by the removal of introns, and the addition of a 50
cap and usually a poly(A) tail at the 30 end. The roles
of this and the mechanisms by which they are
generated are discussed later.
Initiation of transcription
The
promoter
for
RNA
Pol
II
transcription
classically contains a TATA box located around
25 nucleotides upstream of the transcription ini-
tiation site (  25 position). Many genes do not
possess a TATA box and have an initiator element
instead which is not well deﬁned (Fig. 2.3).
The key process in transcription initiation is
the assembly of the initiation complex. Crucial
to this is the general transcription initiation
factor, TFIID, which binds to the TATA box.
After the binding of TFIID, other factors are
recruited that contribute to the initiation of
elongation:
. Many factors make up elements of the functional
polymerase.
. Some factors alter the chromatin structure to
improve the access to other factors.
. Factors may recruit histone acetylase proteins,
which acetylate the histone tails, reducing their
interaction with the DNA.
Elongation
Many factors involved in the assembly of the ini-
tiation complex are not directly required for the
formation of the nucleotide chain Many of these
factors are released during elongation, allowing
RNA Pol II to escape the promoter and transcribe
the gene.
A subunit in the RNA Pol II possesses a long
repeated region of amino acids containing many
serine residues. This region can be phosophory-
lated and the resulting negative charge causes
dissociation of some transcription factor subunits,
which permits elongation. DNA is thought to move
through the immobile transcription complex and
is unwound by topoisomerase enzymes, as is the
case in DNA replication.
The RNA polymerase does not require a primer
to start transcription; it is capable of directly ini-
tiating transcription from the template. However,
it is more error prone, typically making an error on
1 in 105 bases. This high error rate is permissible,
because RNA is not inherited.

The first stage in transcription is the binding 
and activation of specific transcription factors 
to the promoter region of a gene, such that 
the general transcription complex is 
recruited, where it binds to the TATA box.
Initiation
After assembly of the transcriptional complex, 
the long repeating tail of the C-terminal 
domain is phosphorylated, causing it to 
change conformation and trigger the loss of 
some of the subunits of the transcriptional 
complex, allowing the initiation of transcrip-
tion. 
Rapidly after the initiation of transcription, the 
cap-binding proteins are transferred from the 
polymerase to the primary transcript.
Processing
The primary RNA transcript must be 
processed, which requires the removal of 
the introns (in blue) and the production of a 
poly(A) tail. 
The first stage of the process is the 
production of the poly(A) tail is the binding 
of the protein CPSF to the 3`?end of the 
transcript, which recruits the other proteins 
that regulate polyadenylation.
Splicing
The introns of the transcript are recognised 
by the splicesomes, through consensus 
sequences found at either end of the intron. 
The splicesome mediates the excision of the 
intron and the ligation of the two neighbour-
ing exons.
Export
After capping, polyadenylation and splicing, 
the mRNA transcript is ready for export. It 
enters the cytoplasm where it can bind to 
ribosomes, which mediate translation of the 
mRNA into protein.

Termination
In RNA Pol (II) transcription, termination is
associated with the addition of the poly(A) tail to
the mRNA during processing. The other transcrip-
tion
enzymes
have
different
mechanisms
of
termination.
Regulation of transcription by RNA
Pol (II)
There are some protein-encoding genes that are
required in all cells. These housekeeping genes
perform essential functions, such as glycolysis, the
tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport
chain. Other genes are expressed only in speciﬁc
cells, e.g. the TCR (T-cell receptor) genes are ex-
pressed only in T cells.
Regulation of transcription is achieved through
transcription factors, which are proteins that
bind to speciﬁc regulatory sequences (control
sequences) associated with the genes. The control
factors can be classiﬁed into two types:
1 Cis-acting elements are thought to be located
close to the gene on the same chromosome.
2 Trans-actingelementsaremoredistantlyacting
regulatory sequences, which are often found far
from the gene that it regulates. These trans-
acting elements may be found on different
chromosomes.
The binding of transcription factors may increase
(promote or activate) or decrease (repress) the
transcription of the target gene. A single gene
in a eukaryotic cell typically has several control
elements in its promoter. Transcription factors
may interact on a single gene and also interact
with each other to modulate transcription of the
target gene.
Cis-acting elements
Many
positive
control
elements
are
located
immediately
upstream
of
the
transcriptional
start site to increase the level of transcriptional
activity. There are some elements that are in many
genes:
. SP1 is a transcription factor that interacts with a
component of TFIID
. CAAT box.
Other elements are found in only very few genes,
which may limit the expression of a gene to speciﬁc
tissues (where the transcription factor is ex-
pressed) or to certain stimuli.
Enhancers
Long-distance positive control sequences are re-
ferred to as enhancers. These elements are made
up of several sequences, often hundreds of base-
pairs long. Enhancers work through the looping of
DNA, which brings the enhancer sequence (and the
factors that it has bound) into close proximity to
the gene, allowing protein–protein interaction to
occur between the transcription complex and the
enhancer.
Repressors
Repressor proteins inhibit the genes that they tar-
get, by binding to speciﬁc sequences in the pro-
moter. Those that have a long-distance action are
referred
to
as
silencers.
Repression
can
be
achieved in a variety of ways:
. Blocking the binding site of an activator protein
. Masking the activation domain of a protein,
preventing the domain binding DNA or interact-
ing with other transcription factors
. Forming a non-DNA-binding complex with the
activator proteins
. Inhibiting transcription directly.
mRNA processing
The initial RNA transcript must be processed into
functional mRNA for translation. Four major steps
can be identiﬁed in this process:
1 50 capping of the mRNA transcript
2 Splicing of pre-mRNA
3 RNA editing
4 Polyadenylation of the mRNA tail.
After transcription, the primary transcript rapidly
associates with speciﬁc proteins found in the nu-
cleus to form a ribonucleoprotein. These proteins
regulate of many of the subsequent processing
steps and ensure the stability of the transcript.
After processing, the mature mRNA is exported
from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
50 Capping
The 50 end of a mature mRNA transcript possesses
a methylated GTP residue covalently attached to
it ‘the wrong way round’. This ‘capping’ occurs
during
transcription,
through
a
cap-binding
complex which is associated with the RNA poly-
merase. In addition, the ﬁrst two bases in the RNA
must be methylated. The 50-cap structure is a
Molecular biology and genetics 25

crucial signal to trigger the movement of mRNA
out of the nucleus through the nuclear pores.
Splicing
The transcribed regions of genes can be divided
into introns and exons. Although the introns are
almost always absent from a mature mRNA tran-
script, the exons present within the transcript may
vary. As a result, one gene can produce many
different proteins.
The process of splicing removes introns from
the mRNA transcript. It is regulated by a com-
plex known as the splicesome which is made
up
of
proteins
and
small
nuclear
RNAs
(snRNAs). Splicing is initiated by consensus
sequences at either side of the intron, although
other protein factors may inﬂuence the splic-
ing, contributing to the formation of alternative
splice variants.
Alternative splicing explains the surprisingly
small number of genes that have been found
within the human genome in comparison to
less complex organisms. It allows a single mRNA
to potentially produce several different proteins
with
different
functions.
The
mechanisms
that regulate alternative splicing are not fully
understood.
DEFINITION The splicesome
The splicesome mediates the splicing reaction and
is made up of both RNA and protein. The speciﬁcity
of the splicing reaction is maintained through the
complementarity of the splicing consensus se-
quences to a sequence found in one of the RNA
components of the splicesome.
Splicing occurs through breaking the phos-
phate backbone of the RNA molecule at either
end of the intron, to allow the joining of two exons,
via re-annealing of the sugar–phosphate back-
bone of the RNA.
There are also rare group II introns which have
self-splicing activity. The RNA in these introns is
capable of mediating its own splicing from the
primary RNA transcript. This process is seen in
some protein-encoding genes, as well as rRNAs
and tRNAs. Self-splicing requires the assistance of
maturase enzymes, although this is a far less
complex form of assistance than is seen from the
splicesome.
RNA EDITING
There are other changes to the nucleotide se-
quence that result from mechanisms other than
RNA splicing. In the liver, apolipoprotein B100
(Apo B100) is produced because the apolipo-
protein B mRNA is not edited. However, in the
small intestine, RNA editing causes the conver-
sion of a cytosine in the mRNA to a uracil by
deamination, and generates a premature stop
codon, resulting in a smaller protein product,
apolipoprotein B48, which lacks a low-density
lipoprotein
(LDL)-receptor-binding
domain.
Apo B100 is used to package LDL and high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) which can be bound
by LDL receptors, whereas Apo B48 is used to
package chylomicrons, which are not taken up
by the LDL receptor.
Polyadenylation
A crucial step in the processing of mRNA is the
cleavage of the 30 end of the RNA transcript and
the addition of a poly(A) tail. The poly(A) tail allows
the binding of a variety of proteins, which reduce
its breakdown. The proteins that regulate polya-
denylation are associated with the tail of the RNA
polymerase, allowing their rapid transfer to the
RNA on recognition of the relevant sequences in
the transcript.
Polyadenylation is triggered by the binding of
the cleavage-and-polyadenylation factor (CPSF) to
a consensus sequence located upstream of the
poly(A) site. Other protein factors are recruited to
cleave the RNA transcript. Additional adenine re-
sidues are added to the end of the transcript, by a
poly(A) polymerase – which does not require a
template. The addition of the poly(A) tail allows
the binding of many copies of the poly(A)-binding
protein II (PABII), which stabilises the transcript.
In the cytosol, the poly(A) tail is gradually de-
graded by nucleases. Once the tail reaches a length
of around 30 nucleotides, it triggers the removal of
the 50 cap, precipitating the rapid degradation of
the mRNA. Degradation can also be mediated by
factors that cleave off the poly(A) tail at speciﬁc
sites. This mechanism permits rapid alterations in
protein production through control of the rate and
levels of translation.
26
Molecular biology and genetics

Translation
Translation is the production of a polypeptide
chain from an transcript mRNA by a ribosome,
located in the cytoplasm. Translation is reliant on
many forms of RNA:
. messenger RNA (mRNA)
. ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
. transfer RNA (tRNA).
Formation of ribosomes and tRNA
The ribosome is the site of translation. It consists of
two subunits, each made up of protein and rRNA,
which catalyse the formation of a polypeptide
encoded by an mRNA transcript. The amino acids
required for this process are supplied by tRNA
molecules.
Ribosomal formation
The cell possesses many ribosomes – typically
around 10 million – and many copies of the ribo-
some genes are required to allow sufﬁcient syn-
thesis. The rRNA molecules are produced in the
nucleolus by RNA Pol I and Pol III. These RNAs are
chemically modiﬁed and cleaved in processes reg-
ulated by a class of small nucleolar RNAs (snoR-
NAs). Many bases in rRNA are methylated and
many of the uridine bases are converted to
pseudouridine.
In a cell that synthesises large amounts of
protein, the nucleolus may make up around
25% of the nuclear volume, reﬂecting the amount
of ribosomal production required by the cell. The
ribosomal proteins are produced in the cyto-
plasm and then transported back into the nucle-
us for assembly with the rRNA, to produce two
subunits.
Formation of tRNA
Transfer RNA (tRNA) is produced by RNA Pol III
and is highly processed before becoming function-
al. Around 25% of tRNA bases are modiﬁed, either
through conversion to inosine or pseudouridine or
through methylation. The tRNAs are produced
from a larger precursor molecule and must be
spliced, trimmed and folded to generate a func-
tional molecule.
The tRNAs are folded into a ‘clover-leaf’ struc-
ture. Most of the bases in tRNA are paired, although
two important unpaired regions exist:
1 The anticodon consists of three unpaired bases
on the tRNA, which bind to a complementary
codon.Thecodonisathree-basesequenceinthe
mRNA that is speciﬁc for an amino acid, and it is
this interaction that is at the heart of the trans-
lational mechanism.
2 Amino acid attachment site is a short single-
stranded region found at one end of the RNA
molecule.
Amino acids are attached to tRNA by aminacyl-
tRNA synthetase in an ATP-dependent reaction.
A different synthetase exists for each amino acid.
The molecular mechanism
of translation
The genetic code
The mRNA sequence of a gene encodes the order
of the amino acids as they should be encoded in
the protein; this is the genetic code. From 50 to 30
the mRNA sequence can be divided into blocks
of three nucleotides, referred to as codons:
. Most codons specify an amino acid. There are
20 amino acids used in the human body, although
there are 64 (43) potential codon sequences, so a
single amino acid may be represented by more
than one codon; however, a single codon encodes
for only one amino acid.
. The codons UAG, UGA and UAA terminate pro-
tein synthesis, and do not encode an amino acid.
They are referred to as termination codons.
The ﬁrst codon, AUG, is referred to as the initiation
or start codon; all polypeptides start with methi-
onine (although in prokaryotes this is modiﬁed to
N-formylmethionine), but this may be removed
subsequently.
In the case of each codon, it is complementary to
the anticodon located on the tRNA molecule. The
speciﬁcity of the ﬁrst two bases is strictly regulated,
but the requirements of the third base are less well
deﬁned; this is known as the wobble position and
allows some tRNAsto bind tomore than one codon.
Initiation of translation
The initiation of translation is mediated by the
small ribosomal subunit and always starts at a
Molecular biology and genetics 27

codon encoding methionine. The initial methio-
nine is usually contained within a consensus se-
quence known as a Kozak sequence, which aids
the initiation of translation (Fig. 2.4).
. An initiator tRNA (methionine) is loaded into
the small subunit, which is associated with
translation initiation factors (eIFs). Methionyl-
tRNA is the only tRNA capable of binding to the
small ribosomal subunit without the presence of
a complete ribosome.
. The small subunit recognises the 50 cap and
binds to the mRNA.
GTP
Initiation 1
Translation begins when a small ribosomal 
subunit binds to the 5` end of the transcript 
and begin to ‘scan’ the mRNA. Methionine-
tRNA is pre-loaded into the subunit, which 
initiates translation by binding to the AUG 
with its complementary anticodon. 
Initiation 2
The binding of the small subunit to the 
mRNA allows the recruitment of a large 
subunit. The ribosome is then able to shift 
along the transcript by three bases such 
that the tRNA vacates the ‘A’ Site and 
another tRNA may enter the complex at 
that site.
Elongation
The recruitment of a new tRNA-amino acid 
molecule with the correct anticodon to the 
‘A’ site triggers the formation of a bond 
between the two amino acids, and the 
simultaneous breakage of the bond 
between the first tRNA and its amino acid. 
The ribosome advances three more bases 
and the first tRNA leaves the ribosome. 
This sequence of events is repeated, 
resulting in the generation of a polypeptide 
chain.
Termination
Termination is achieved by one of three stop 
codons, which recruit a ‘release factor’ 
protein, and not a tRNA. The binding of 
release factor triggers the hydrolysis of the 
bond between the polypeptide chain and the 
tRNA, allowing the release of the polypeptide 
and the dissociation of the ribosome from 
the mRNA.

Molecular biology and genetics

. The subunit scans the mRNA, its movement
powered by ATP-hydrolysing initiation factors.
. Thesmall subunit stops on encountering an AUG
codon and its surrounding consensus sequence,
and recruits the large ribosomal subunit.
If the sequence surrounding the initiation codon
differs from the consensus ribosomal binding se-
quence, it may promote ‘skipping’ in the tran-
script, such that a subsequent AUG becomes the
site of initiation of translation. This may allow the
production of different proteins – and in particular
different leader sequences – from a single mRNA.
These different leader sequences may target one
protein to two different cellular compartments.
As the base-pairing code is arranged in groups of
three (the size of the codon), there are three po-
tential sequences that can be produced from a
string of nucleotides. Each of these is known as a
reading frame. There is usually only a single func-
tional reading frame because the others are likely
to introduce premature stop codons to generate
a very small protein product; however, in some
viruses there are overlapping reading frames, as a
result of the limits on genome size. In vivo, the
correct reading frame is determined by the pres-
ence of the AUG initiation codon.
Elongation
Afterinitiationoftranscription,aminoacidsmustbe
bound to together to produce a polypeptide chain.
Three tRNA-binding sites are identiﬁable in the
ribosome – A, P and E; the movement of tRNAs
through these sites and the catalytic activity associ-
ated are responsible for the production of the poly-
peptide chain. The tRNA complementary to the
mRNA is recruited to the A and P sites; a hydrolysis
reactionthenoccurstoformthepeptidelinkandthe
ribosome moves three bases down the mRNA, with
the now empty tRNA exiting from the E site.
The termination of translation is signalled by
one of the three termination codons (UAA, UAG,
UGA)forwhichnotRNAisspeciﬁc.Instead,‘release
factor’ proteins bind to the A site and induce the
addition of H2O to the polypeptide chain, mediat-
ing its release from the ribosomal complex. The
ribosome then dissociates from the transcript.
As the 50 and 30 ends of mRNA are closely asso-
ciated, the ribosome is able to rapidly reassociate
with the 50 end of the molecule to begin translation
once again.
Polysomes
The synthesis of a single copy of a protein by
a ribosome may take many minutes. To increase
the production of protein, many ribosomes trans-
late a single mRNA. As soon as one ribosome is
sufﬁciently clear of the AUG, a second will
start translation. Thus, mRNAs are found in
polysomes – large clusters of many actively trans-
lating ribosomes, allowing the rapid production of
many copies of a protein from a single mRNA
transcript.
Post-translational modiﬁcation
Proteins
can
be
covalently
modiﬁed
by
translation. These modiﬁcations may be crucial
for the function of the protein or can modify
its efﬁcacy. The most common forms of modiﬁca-
tion are:
. The addition of phosphate, which is commonly
used in second messenger pathways to activate or
repress the performance of individual proteins.
. Glycosylation is commonly regulated through
the recognition of speciﬁc amino acid sequences
in the protein. The addition and removal of
carbohydrates occurs in the rough endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus.
. Other groups can also be added. For example,
ubiquitin is often covalently added to a protein
to signal targeting of the protein to the protea-
some for degradation.
Protein targeting
Sequences in the polypeptide regulate whether
translation occurs in the cytoplasm or the rough
ER to produce a protein for secretion or trafﬁcking
to a subcellular compartment. The mechanisms of
trafﬁcking are discussed in detail in Chapter 1.
Regulation of gene
expression
Differentiation results from long-term changes in
gene expression. This is caused by modiﬁcations of
the packaging of the genome, ensuring that a
particular transcription pattern is achieved. It is
this pattern that allows an individual cell to take on
a distinct phenotype – despite containing exactly
Molecular biology and genetics 29

the same DNA, many different specialised cell
types may result. Cells may also differentiate in
response to speciﬁc stimuli (e.g. an immune re-
sponse) as part of the body’s response to a homo-
eostatic change.
The expression of speciﬁc genes may be altered
in response to speciﬁc stimuli. Such modiﬁcations
can occur through signals such as hormones.
These modiﬁcations allow cells to respond to the
changing environment, while still maintaining an
overall pattern of gene expression that keeps them
in the same differentiated state.
Mechanisms of gene expression
The expression of genes, and hence their protein
product, can be regulated. It is this process that
allows one genome to permit the development of
many different types of differentiated cell.
Regulatory proteins bind to speciﬁc sequences
through many weak interactions, which contribute
to produce a strong binding. These proteins may
bind several thousand bases from the promoter in
the target gene and can act in many ways to
inﬂuence the level of transcription:
. Transcription factors
. Promoter and repressor elements
. Modiﬁcation of histones and structural genes
. Chromatin condensation.
Genetics of disease
The pathology of many diseases involves a genetic
component: in some cases, mutations or abnormal-
itiescanoccurspontaneouslyandmaycontributeto
adisease,throughthealteredfunctionorexpression
ofproteinsandtheirinteractionwithenvironmental
factors. The nature of such a mutation can vary
from chromosomal abnormalities to the change in
a single nucleotide base. Many such mutations are
inherited. There are some key terms related to ge-
netic disease:
. Allele – different forms of the same gene, found at
the same location on homologous chromosomes
. Genotype – the genetic constitution of an
individual
. Phenotype – the appearance of an individual,
which results from the interactions of the envi-
ronment and the genotype.
Chromosomal abnormalities
It is possible that, through abnormal meiosis,
large-scale abnormalities may occur. Chromo-
somal abnormalities are usually extremely severe.
Fetuses
carrying
chromosomal
abnormalities
rarely survive to birth; they are thought to account
for around half of all early miscarriages.
Polyploidy
Polyploidy
is
the
most
severe
abnormality,
when additional complete sets of chromosomes
may be inherited. Triploid (3n) embryos are some-
times seen, as a result of the simultaneous fusion of
two sperm with an egg. Polyploidy usually results
in miscarriage or stillbirth. In some rare cases –
particularly with a double maternal contribution –
the infant may survive to birth. There is severe
growth retardation and widespread developmen-
tal abnormalities, and the infant dies shortly after
birth.
An abnormal diploid (2n) embryo may form
from only one parental set of chromosomes. These
embryos do not survive, because the imprinting
on the chromosomes necessary for development
requires one male and one female set. Hydatidi-
form moles may develop from these abnormal
diploid embryos.
Numerical abnormalities
Abnormalities of the autosomal
chromosomes
Single chromosome numerical abnormalities of
the autosomal chromosomes occur when the
wrong numbers of a speciﬁc chromosome are
inherited, as a result of incorrect separation, usu-
ally during meiosis (they may very rarely occur in
an early mitosis):
. All cases where there is only a single copy of an
autosomal chromosome (monosomy) are em-
bryonically lethal.
. There are three trisomies (where an extra copy of
a chromosome is inherited) that survive until
birth, although only Down’s syndrome (trisomy
of chromosome 21) permits survival into adult-
hood. In Patau’s syndrome (trisomy 13) and
Edwards’ syndrome (trisomy 18) death usually
occurs within a few weeks of birth. These chro-
mosomes have the least number of genes,
30
Molecular biology and genetics

accounting for their greater viability than other
trisomies.
CLINICAL Down's syndrome
Down's syndrome (trisomy of chromosome 21)
occurs in around 1 in 600 births, and may be of
varying severity. Typically, there is some degree of
learning disability and abnormal facial features.
Down’ssyndrome isalso associatedwith congenital
heart defects, a wide gap between the ﬁrst and
second toes, and ﬂattened facial features. The oc-
currence of Down’s syndrome is associated with
increased age of the mother.
Numerical abnormalities within the sex
chromosomes
These abnormalities are compatible with life into
adulthood. This is reﬂected in the sufﬁciency of one
X chromosome in men and that womendo not have
a Y chromosome. Turner’s (XO) syndrome is the
result of abnormal numbers of X chromosomes.
CLINICAL Turner's syndrome
Turner’s syndrome is monosomy of chromosome X
in women– XO. It is relatively common at conception
and usually leads to spontaneous abortion, al-
though some cases survive to birth (around 1 in
3000 births). Patients with Turner’s syndrome are
infertile, not going through puberty, and are gener-
ally abnormally short. Coarctation of the aorta is
often seen. If detectedearly, Turner’s syndrome can
be treated by hormone therapy and most problems
associated with the condition can be corrected,
except infertility.
CLINICAL Cri-du-chat syndrome
Cri-du-chat syndrome is caused by deletion of the
short arm of chromosome 5, and occurs in around 1
in 50 000 births.
The features of cri-du-chat syndrome appear
early in life: a cat-like cry, from which the syndrome
derives its name; short stature; and facial abnor-
malities. There are often breathing problems and
congenital heart defects, and there may be some
learning disability.
Structural abnormalities
Structural abnormalities are common in chromo-
somes. Four main sets of structural abnormalities
of chromosomes may occur:
1 Translocations
2 Duplications
3 Deletions
4 Inversions.
Translocations
Translocations are the result of the exchange of
segments
between
non-homologous
chromo-
somes, which typically occurs between the long
arms of the chromosomes. If the break point in the
DNA does not disrupt a gene, carriers of a trans-
location are phenotypically normal – they express
all genes normally because no genetic material has
been lost. Some translocations may be unbalanced
and result in gametes that do not express the
correct complement of genetic material.
DEFINITION Robertsonian
translocations
The small acrocentric chromosomes may become
fused, such that the long arms of one chromosome
fuse with the long arms of another. The short arms of
the chromosomes are lost, although do not produce
a phenotype, because the short arms contain only
the genes for rRNA, of which there are enough
copies on other acrocentric chromosomes. Robert-
sonian translocations are relatively common and
may be seen in around 1 in 800 live births, most
without a phenotype.
Unbalanced gametes possess two or no copies
of the chromosome which can lead to monosomies
or trisomies.
Deletions
Deletions are the loss of part of a chromosome –
there is effectively monosomy for a section of the
chromosome. Large deletions are not compatible
with life, although smaller deletions can lead to
certain conditions. Some deletions are visible mi-
croscopically, e.g. cri-du-chat syndrome.
Molecular biology and genetics 31

Small, submicroscopic deletions have been
identiﬁed through the use of sequencing probes
speciﬁc for a single locus. Angelmann’s and
Prader–Willi syndromes are both diseases that
may result from submicroscopic deletions.
Inversions
An inversion is the reversal of a section of a
chromosome, as a result of it becoming broken
at two points. The inversions are balanced chro-
mosome rearrangements, causing a disease phe-
notype only if one of the break points disrupts a
gene. Inversions may be pericentric – involving the
centromere – or paracentric, where only one arm of
the chromosome is affected.
Ring chromosomes
Ring
chromosomes
may
occur
when
there
are breaks within each arm of a chromosome
and the exposed ends then unite, forming a
ring. The distal fragments are lost, which can
lead to serious phenotypes in the autosomal
chromosomes.
Ring chromosomes are quite unstable during
mitosis, and may be found in a proportion of cells;
other cells have lost the ring chromosome and are
monosomic.
Imprinting and associated
abnormalities
It is essential that , in each pair, one chromosome is
derived from the mother and one from the father.
The nature of covalent modiﬁcation to the DNA
and its associated proteins may differ. In particu-
lar, the methylation of some of the bases varies
between chromosomes.
The importance of this imprinting can be illus-
trated by two syndromes: Prader–Willi syndrome
and Angelmann’s syndrome. Although the dis-
eases have very distinct features, they are both
the result of deletion of chromosome 15 – the
difference in the conditions depends on whether
the deletion occurs on the maternally derived
or the paternally derived copy of chromosome
15. The precise roles that the deletions play in the
development of the syndromes is not clear. These
diseases show that paternal and maternal chro-
mosomes may have different roles at different
times, and may be preferentially expressed in
different cell types, and at different points in
development.
CLINICAL Prader–Willi syndrome
Prader–Willi syndrome is associated with a deletion
in the paternally-derived chromosome 15, and is
associated with severe hypotonia shortly after birth.
Shortstature,obesityandlearningdisabilityarealso
features. People with Prader-Willi syndrome often
develop type 2 diabetes.
CLINICAL Angelman's syndrome
Angelman’s syndrome results from a deletion in the
maternally-derived chromosome 15. The symp-
toms of the syndrome are very different from those
of Prader–Willi syndrome, featuring an apraxic gait,
jerky movements, epilepsy and severe learning
disability, and an inability to speak.
Single-gene abnormalities
Several thousand single-gene abnormalities have
been identiﬁed; most are extremely rare, although
together it is thought they may affect 1–2% of the
population. Diseases that can be inherited as the
result of changes associated with a single gene
exhibit ‘mendelian characteristics’. In relation to
atraitthatisgovernedbyasinglegenemutation,the
trait may be referred to as dominant or recessive:
. Dominant traits are seen when a single copy of
the mutated gene is inherited.
. Recessive traits require both alleles to contain
the mutation for the trait to become apparent.
The inheritance of such diseases within a speciﬁc
family can be illustrated diagrammatically, each
type of disease showing a speciﬁc pattern of in-
heritance (Fig. 2.5).
Autosomal dominant traits
Autosomal dominant traits are those disorders
where the inheritance of a single faulty copy of a
gene is sufﬁcient to induce a phenotype. In most
cases, an individual with an autosomal dominant
disorderhasa50%chanceofpassingthedisorderon
to their children, if the other parent is not affected.
Autosomal dominant disorders may arise from a
spontaneous mutation, in which case the relative
risk of siblings being affected is almost zero, al-
though this varies between speciﬁc diseases.
32
Molecular biology and genetics

DEFINITION Homozygotes and
heterozygotes
Individuals are referred to as homozygous with
respect to a speciﬁc gene if they have inherited two
alleles that are identical. In heterozygotes the al-
leles inherited are different.
Most individuals with these disorders are het-
erozygous for the relevant gene; however, in some
cases individuals who are homozygous for an au-
tosomal dominant trait have been reported (e.g.
familial hypercholesterolaemia). The phenotype
is more severe and often lethal, although such
individuals are rare due to the low occurrence of
autosomal dominant disorders in the general
population. A typical autosomal dominant condi-
tion is achondroplasia.
CLINICAL Achondroplasia
Achondroplasia is the result of an autosomal
dominant
mutation
affecting
the
ﬁbroblast
growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene; it leads
to abnormalities in the formation of cartilage, in
particular, the growth plates, abnormally in the
long bones, and accounts for the short stature
characteristic of the condition. Achondroplastic
individuals have a disproportionate stature as
membranous bone forms normally, leading to
the formation of a normally sized axial skeleton.
Homozygous achondroplasia is lethal as the
FGFR3 protein has some essential functions re-
quiring at least a single copy of the gene.

Figure 2.5 Genetic inheritance. The sex of an individual in a genetic pedigree is determined by shape. The genetic
status is determined by shading – healthy individuals who do not carry the disease allele are hollow, whereas
affected individuals are shaded. In recessive diseases, a carrier state may arise, which is indicated by a dot. If an
individual within the pedigree has died, this is indicated by a diagonal line striking through the individual’s marker.
Different individuals are labelled by roman numerals, and individuals within that generation are labelled with Arabic
numerals. The pedigree shown in the ﬁgure represents one that may be typical of an autosomal recessive disorder.
Molecular biology and genetics 33

Autosomal recessive
Autosomal recessive phenotypes are expressed
by those homozygous for the disease allele. As
a result, there are heterozygous carriers, who
are phenotypically normal (or express a mild
phenotype, as in sickle cell anaemia). The offspring
of two carriers of a recessive trait have a 25%
chance of developing the disease phenotype,
through being homozygous for the recessive allele.
Similarly, 25% are likely to be homozygous for the
wild-type allele and 50% will become heterozygous
carriers.
When one parent has an autosomal recessive
disorder, all children are likely to be heterozygous
carriers; they will all inherit one disease allele. In
cases where the other parent is also a carrier for the
same disease, pseudodominance will occur: 50%
of the children will be homozygous for the muta-
tion and the other 50% will be heterozygous
carriers.
Often, recessive diseases result from muta-
tions in genes, leading to a loss of function of
the encoded protein. Many recessive mutations
occur in genes encoding enzymes, where the
functional 50% of the enzyme derived from the
wild-type allele is sufﬁcient to compensate for
the non-functional allele.
There may be heterogeneity in the nature of
the
mutation
causing
autosomal
recessive
disorders:
. Locus heterogeneity refers to the fact that an
inherited disorder can be caused by mutations
in more than one gene. This occurs in deaf-
ness, which can be caused by mutation of
one of many different genes. As a result of
schooling and interactions in the deaf com-
munity, deaf people often have children with
other deaf people. Their children may be phe-
notypically normal: they will be heterozygotes
for two different genes, at different genomic
locations.
. Mutational heterogeneity results from the fact
that more than one mutation exists that can
result in a non-functional protein product. A
variety of alleles may be associated with a
speciﬁc disease. Most autosomal recessive dis-
orders are likely to result from compound het-
erozygous alleles – two different mutations at the
same locus have been inherited. It is unlikely that
an individual is truly heterozygous (where both
alleles have the same mutation) unless there
is some consanguinity – the disease-causing
allele having been inherited from a common
ancestor.
CLINICAL Cystic ﬁbrosis
Cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) is the most common autoso-
mal recessive disorder in the western world.
Around 5%of white people are estimated to be
carriers of the disease. The cystic ﬁbrosis trans-
membrane conductance regulator (CFTCR) gene
is the site of mutation, and encodes a chloride
transporter, although it may also have a role in
regulating other membrane proteins. Depending
on age of presentation, the main sites of pathol-
ogy are the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas,
or within the lungs.
In infants, CF may present as meconium ileus,
where there is intestinal obstruction due to the
hindered passage of meconium. Alternatively, pan-
creatic pathology can lead to the infant failing to
gain weight despite an adequate diet. There is no
detectable abnormality within the lungs at birth.
In later life, lung pathology is the predominant
symptom of CF, due to the production of abnormal
mucus, which can lead to pneumonia and other
infections. Repeated damage can lead to destruc-
tion of the lungs.
X-LINKED DISORDERS
Disorders associated with mutations at loci on
the X chromosome show a particular inheri-
tance pattern. Only males are usually affected,
because they possess a single X chromosome;
the mutation cannot be masked by a wild-type
allele. Females carrying the mutation are almost
always heterozygous carriers with a normal
phenotype.
Affected sons will have carrier mothers, un-
less the child represents a new mutation –
there will never be father-to-son transmission
of an X-linked trait (they must inherit the Y
chromosome), although daughters of afﬂicted
fathers are obligate carriers of the condition
(they must inherit the affected X chromosome).
Some X-linked conditions may be predomi-
nantly transmitted by the mother because af-
fected males may not survive to reproductive
age.

CLINICAL Duchenne muscular
dystrophy
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the result of
mutationthe geneencodingdystrophin.The disease
is usually identiﬁed in the third or fourth year, when
the child encounters difﬁculty in walking and falls
regularly. Affected individuals typically begin to walk
relatively late (often later than 18 months). Contrac-
tures of muscles are particularly prominent in DMD;
weakening of the anterior muscles of the leg leads to
individuals walking on their toes. Intellectual im-
pairment is also seen in some cases.
A similar, although milder, condition – Becker
muscular dystrophy – is also caused by mutations
in the dystrophingene; however,suchmutationsare
usually in-frame, resulting in a protein with de-
creased function. Mutations causing DMD are com-
monly due to a deletion or substitution mutation,
which produces a short, non-functional product,
through the premature generation of a stop codon.
Expression of X-linked disorders within females
can occur occasionally as a result of a variety of
situations, often caused by inactivation of the
healthy X chromosome:
. Skewed X-chromosome inactivation may result
in carrier females expressing a mild phenotype of
an X-linked disorder – a manifesting carrier. As
X-chromosome inactivation is arandom process,
it can be that, by chance, most of the cells in the
body express the mutant allele. Such cases have
been reported in haemophilia and DMD.
. Numerical X-chromosome abnormalities can
lead to the manifestation of an X-linked disease
in females. Typically this occurs in Turner’s syn-
drome, where the inheritance of a single mutant
X chromosome will lead to a phenotype.
. X-autosome translocation occurs when there is
the translocation of the X chromosome on to an
autosomal chromosome. When the breakpoint of
theX chromosomedisrupts agene,itmayresultin
the female being afﬂicted with an X-linked disor-
der. Both copies of the autosomal chromosome
must be transcriptionally active. As such, the non-
translocatedX chromosome may be preferentially
inactivated, because there is a greater need to
transcribe the autosomal genes translocated on
the X chromosome (as a result it, and the X
chromosome that contains it, must remain tran-
scriptionally active). Such translocation has been
observed in some females with DMD – where
there has been translocation of the short arm of
the X chromosome at the site of the DMD gene.
X-linked dominant inheritance is very rare. The
sons and daughters of affected women both have a
50% chance of being affected. An affected father
will transmit the trait to all his daughters, although
to none of his sons. The inheritance of such traits
leads to an excess of affected females. This can be
seen in vitamin D-resistant rickets.
Mitochondrial inheritance
The mitochondria contain a limited genome that
encodes proteins essential for the function of the
mitochondria. Given the role of mitochondria in
energy generation, if there is a mutation in the
mitochondria, affected tissues are usually those
with high-energy demands. A well-studied mito-
chondrial disease is MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy
with ragged red ﬁbres), which is associated with
hearing loss, optic atrophy, dementia and respira-
tory failure. Mitochondrial DNA has a higher rate of
spontaneous mutation, which is probably due to
the oxidative damage resulting from higher expo-
sure to oxidative species.
Mitochondria are maternally inherited. If the
motherisaffected,thereisa100%riskofinheritance
by the offspring, although the age of onset and the
severity of the phenotype may vary through inter-
actions with other genes and the environment, and
as a result of heteroplasmy. There are many mito-
chondria in the body and it is unlikely that all will
contain the mutation – only cells with a high pro-
portion(around70–80%ofmitochondriacontaining
the mutation) are likely to exhibit a phenotype.
Thesymptomscanbedifferentindifferenttissues
asaresultofportioningoftheaffectedmitochondria

unevenly
segregate
mitochondria,
and
some
cells may develop regions of tissue that have a high
proportion of affected mitochondria, leading to se-
vere phenotypes. Other regions may carry very few
affected mitochondria and exhibit no phenotype.
Single-base mutations
The alteration of a single nucleotide base in a gene
is sufﬁcient to cause a distinct phenotype. These
substitution mutations are classiﬁed depending
on the type of change and its effects:
. Missense – the mutation leads to a different
amino acid being encoded.
Molecular biology and genetics 35

. Silent – the mutation has no effect on the ﬁnal
product, usually because it alters a nucleotide in
a degenerate position.
. Frame-shift – the insertion or deletion of a nu-
cleotide results in a shift in the entire reading
frame during translation.
. Nonsense – the mutation leads to the formation
of a stop codon.
These mutations show a mendelian inheritance
pattern and can occur during DNA replication.
Mispairing of bases during DNA replication can
be categorised to two forms:
1 Transition
mutations
are
purine-to-purine
changes, i.e. A to G, or vice versa
2 Transversion mutations are purine-to-pyrimi-
dine chances, e.g. A to T.
Substitution mutations may lead to changes in the
amino acid code of the protein, which can be
sufﬁcient to cause a phenotype (e.g. sickle cell
anaemia). Substitutions can cause more serious
consequences if they lead to the production of a
stop codon, e.g. b thalassaemia.
DEFINITION Polymorphism
Polymorphism occurs when more than one version
of a speciﬁc version exists within a species. Poly-
morphisms must also be heritable traits and not
spontaneous mutations that subsequently disap-
pear from a population. This is typically taken to
mean that at least 1% of the population expresses
the allele.
Deletion mutations
Deletion mutations are less common than sub-
stitutions, although frequently more severe. If
the deletion is of a three-base-pair multiple,
it will lead to the loss of one or more amino
acids. However, if the amino acid is not a three-
base-pair multiple, it will alter the reading frame
downstream of the mutation, leading to the
formation of a completely different C terminus
to the amino acid, most rapidly containing a
stop codon. This type of mutation is the basis
for many cases (around 65%) of Duchenne Mus-
cular Dystrophy, most of the rest (30%) being the
result of point mutation.
Triplet repeat mutations
Although DNA polymerases are highly accurate,
there are sequences that can increase the like-
lihood of copying errors. The occurrence of long
regions of single-, di- or trinucleotide repeats
can lead to mutations as a result of slippage
of
the
DNA
polymerase
during
copying.
Two conditions resulting from triplet repeat
mutations are Huntington’s disease and fragile
X syndrome.
CLINICAL Fragile X syndrome
Fragile X syndrome accounts for a large proportion
of
developmental
intellectual
impairment.
The
name is derived from the ‘fragmented’ appearance
of the X chromosome (under light microscopy) in
these individuals – physically the chromosome
does remain intact. This ‘fragile site’ is located in
the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome, which is
involved in regulating the translation of RNA in
neuronal cells; absence of FMR1 leads to abnormal
synapse formation, which accounts for the syn-
drome. The FMR1 gene contains a number of CGG
triplet repeats.In the normalgene15–40 repeatsare
seen, although in afﬂicted individuals the number
may be more than 200.
Although fragile X syndrome usually affects
males, if a particularly high number of repeats are
inherited there may be a mild phenotype seen in
heterozygote females; this is also modulated by X-
chromosome inactivation in females.
Learning disability is the most common symptom
of fragile X syndrome. Large testes are also char-
acteristic, as is an elongated face. A stutter is com-
mon and loss of muscle tone has been reported.
Polygenic diseases
Many traits result from the combined effects of
more than one gene. Polygenic traits account for
much of the variation seen in the population, such
as hair colour and height. Polygenic traits often
have a continuous distribution in the population
and often rely on interactions of the individual’s
genotype with the environment.
The environmental and genetic component of
polygenic traits can be investigated by looking
at concordance within monozygotic (MZ) and di-
zygotic (DZ) twins. As MZ twins share an identical
36
Molecular biology and genetics

genome, whereas DZ twins are likely to share only
50% of genes – similar to siblings – traits where
there is a large inherited component are likely to be
much more frequent in MZ twins than in DZ twins.
Traits where the heritable component is low are
likely to show similar inheritance in MZ and DZ
twins.
Susceptibility genes
It is possible to identify speciﬁc loci in polygenic
diseases that increase the likelihood of developing
the disease. Many diseases show a familial clus-
tering of inheritance, although there is obviously
no form of mendelian inheritance. Type 1 diabetes
represents the prototypic polygenic disease, and
many of the ‘susceptibility loci’ for the condition
have been identiﬁed.
Population genetics
It is important to understand how a disease may
occur and be sustained in a population.
The Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium
In a large, randomly mating population, where
there are no outside inﬂuences, the relative
proportions of individual who are heterozygous
and homozygous for a given trait can be de-
scribed by the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.
For an autosomal locus where there are only
two alleles, A (the dominant allele) and a (the
recessive allele), with frequencies p and q, re-
spectively, the frequency of each genotype can
be calculated as:
ðp þ qÞ2 ¼ p2 þ 2pq þ q2 ¼ 1
p þ q
¼ 1
because A and a are the only two alleles at this
locus.
This allows the calculation of each phenotype
and genotype within a population (Table 2.1).
The Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium is, however,
an ideal situation and certain conditions are as-
sumed for it to be true:
. There is completely random mating in the
population.
. The population is inﬁnitely large.
. There is no preferential survival of genotypes.
. No new alleles will emerge in the population.
Disturbances of the Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium
There are a few cases where the Hardy–Wein-
berg equilibrium does hold – notably blood
groups. However, in the study of genetic dis-
eases, there are four ways in which the Hardy–
Weinberg equilibrium is disturbed within a
population:
1 Non-random mating
2 Mutations
3 Genetic drift
4 Selection.
Non-random mating
Humans are likely to choose mates who share
characteristics, such as height, intelligence and
racial origins. This assortative mating can be ex-
tended to some genetic traits, e.g. autosomal re-
cessive deafness, which accounts for a large pro-
portion of congenital hearing loss. Such assortative
mating will lead to an increase in the allele
frequency.
Consanguinity can also alter the
Hardy–
Weinberg equilibrium. In small communities,
individuals are likely to share common rela-
tives, and may inherit recessive alleles from
them. This increases the occurrence of indivi-
duals who are homozygous for the recessive
alleles, which leads to a relative decrease for
heterozygotes.

CLINICAL Sickle cell anaemia
Sickle cell anaemia results from a substitution mu-
tation in the gene encoding the b-chain of haemo-
globin. In equatorial Africa 10–40% may carry the
sickle cell gene, although in Europe this number is
much lower (around 0.25% or less). The gene con-
veys a resistance to malaria in the heterozygote.
However, in the homozygote it causes crippling
sickle cell disease as a result of the polymerisation
of haemoglobin, inducing ‘sickle-shaped’ red blood
cells in a low-oxygen environment. These lead to
occlusion of the blood vessels, causing crises. The
precise nature of the crisis depends on the site
affected, e.g. bone pain can result from bone mar-
row infarcts. The most severe crises are sequestra-
tion crises, where a large number of blood cells
become trapped within an organ (commonly the
spleen,liverorlungs),causingwidespreaddamage
to that organ and also a severe anaemia. Chronic
complications result from the repeated occlusion of
the vessels in the organ.
Sickle cell anaemia may affect individuals to a
varying degree. In its most severe form, it may be an
extreme haemolytic anaemia. Jaundice often oc-
curs and an elevated white blood cell or platelet
count is not uncommon.
In heterozygotes, the sickle cell trait causes no
symptoms, except occasionally in extreme hypoxia.
Mutations
Mutations occur naturally, although the equilibri-
um does not allow for the entry of new alleles into
the population. If a locus has a particularly high
mutation rate, there will be an increase in the
proportion of mutant alleles in the population. If
a mutation is detrimental to survival, it is likely to
be quickly eliminated from the population.
Genetic drift
Genetic drift is the effect of ﬂuctuations in the
reproduction of individuals in a population. In
large populations, the average number of children
produced by individuals of a given genotype is
normally relatively similar – the frequencies of the
genotype are likely to remain constant. In a small
population, random ﬂuctuations in the number of
offspring inheriting the allele can alter this con-
stancy. If a new allele occurs, even if it is advan-
tageous, it will not survive if none of those indivi-
duals who carry it has any children who carry the
allele. The effects of these random events on the
survival of an allele is called genetic drift.
Selection
Selection ensures that the proportion of an allele
that conveys a survival advantage is likely to in-
crease within the population. In Africa there is
selection for the sickle cell mutation, as hetero-
zygotes have an increased resistance to malaria
although homozygotes have a decreased survival.
However, there is no such advantage in non-ma-
larial countries and the sickle cell allele occurs at a
much lower frequency.
Genetic techniques
Gene mapping
Many polymorphisms are found in non-coding
regions of DNA. Such polymorphism can be used
to detect different alleles of genes due to linkage,
and also allow the prediction of inheritance of
genetic diseases in which the gene involved has
not been deﬁnitively identiﬁed. A variety of differ-
ent polymorphisms can be used:
. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(RFLPs) occur when the variation in the DNA
sequence occurs at a restriction enzyme site.
Two alleles will exist – one that can be cut by the
speciﬁc restriction enzyme, and one that cannot.
. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are
single base changes found in the DNA, and as
such can be identiﬁed directly through DNA
sequencing.
. Micro- and minisatellite DNA (also known as
variable number tandem repeats or VNTRs) are
sequences of DNA made up of arepeated pattern,
where the number of repeats varies. Such poly-
morphisms are very heterozygous and can be
found spread throughout the genome.
Despite these polymorphisms occurring predom-
inantly in non-coding DNA regions, they can be
used to detect different alleles of genes. If two
genes are found on a chromosome, they are gen-
erally inherited together. If there is crossing over of
the chromosomes during meiosis, the genes may
be passed into different cells.
The closer the two genes are located on the
chromosome, the greater the chance of the two
genes being inherited from the same parent. If any
38
Molecular biology and genetics

two loci (such as a gene and an SNP) are placed
closely together on a chromosome, they are more
likely to be inherited together because there is less
chance of crossing over.
The deviation can be determined as a measure of
genetic distance, based on the number of recom-
binants – where crossing over has prevented the
inheritance of both loci – within the population.
The measure of genetic distance is a centimor-
gan (cM); 1 cM of distance represents a 1% prob-
ability that the two loci would be separated by
recombination. A centimorgan does not correlate
to a precise physical distance – speciﬁc regions
of DNA recombine with different frequencies –
although 1 cM is typically around 1 megabase.
Genetic maps
Using genetic markers, a map can be constructed to
identify inheritance of speciﬁc alleles. In principle,
any DNA marker can be used. RFLPs and SNPs are
limitedintheirusefulness,becausethereareonlytwo
alleles – the presence of heterozygotes at a speciﬁc
location cannot be greater than 50% as determined
by the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and, if an in-
dividual is homozygous for a speciﬁc marker, then
genetic analysis is not informative, because recom-
bination events at that site cannot be detectable.
VNTRs are more advantageous because hetero-
zygosity is frequently greater than 90%. The pres-
ence of individuals homozygous at a speciﬁc VNTR
is very low.
The production of genetic maps allows the de-
tection of the region of DNA where the gene re-
sponsible for a condition is likely to reside. It allows
prediction of the inheritance of a condition, when
the gene responsible has not been identiﬁed. How-
ever, the accuracy of such analysis is never 100%,
because there is a risk of crossing over. In autoso-
mal recessive disorders, a limited number of mu-
tations are likely to be responsible, and associated
markers can be used as a direct test.
In dominant conditions the disease is likely to
have resulted from a new mutation – each family
may possess a different mutation. Linkage analysis
may allow identiﬁcation of markers in this case, if
sufﬁcientnumbersoffamilymemberscanbetested.
Molecular techniques: PCR and
sequencing
The understanding of the human genome has been
helped, by development techniques, to identify
speciﬁc sequences and the polymorphisms that oc-
cur in genes. Four techniques have been crucial to
the early development of genetics, and are used
nowadays
in
the
identiﬁcation
of
inherited
disorders:
1 Gel electrophoresis
2 PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
3 Sequencing
4 Southern blotting.
Gel electrophoresis
Electrophoresis allows the separation of DNA mo-
lecules based on their charge and size. DNA mo-
lecules are drawn towards a positive charge as a
result
of
their
negatively-charged
phosphate
groups. The DNA fragments are passed through
a porous gel under the electric charge, the migra-
tion speed depending on the size of the fragment
and the overall charge of the molecule.
PCR
The PCR ampliﬁes a speciﬁc DNA sequence. With-
in a reaction the following are required:
. Sample DNA which acts as a template for the
DNA ampliﬁcation
. Taq DNA polymerase which catalyses the repli-
cation of DNA and can survive the high temper-
ature of the reaction – necessary to separate the
DNA strands
. Nucleotides which are polymerised in the poly-
merase reaction
. Primers which bind speciﬁcally to the DNA tem-
plate and permit further elongation to create new
copies of the DNA sequence in question.
The PCR occurs through the sequential cycling
of the reactants through three temperatures:
. 95C allows the separation of the DNA strands
such that they are accessible to the primer
sequences
. a lower temperature (often around 55C) permits
the annealing of the primers to the strands (the
precise temperature depends on the sequence of
the primers themselves, because that determines
the temperature at which they bind)
. 72C allows binding of the polymerase and then
elongation of the DNA chains at the primer sites
to produce new copies of the DNA sequence.
Repeated cycling through these three tempera-
tures allows the exponential ampliﬁcation of a
Molecular biology and genetics 39

speciﬁc DNA sequence. The primers allow PCR to
be speciﬁc, permitting the detection of poly-
morphisms, or the presence/absence of the gene:
. If the primers are complementary to the target
sequence of DNA, there will be ampliﬁcation of
DNA and a band will be detectable by gel
electrophoresis.
. If the primers are not complementary (as a result
of the target sequence being absent), then am-
pliﬁcation will not occur and hence no band will
be detectable.
Sequencing reaction
Understanding of the genome sequence has been
aided by the development of a method to establish
the precise nucleotide sequence. This process uses
dideoxynucleotides at low concentrations in a PCR
reaction.
Dideoxynucleotides can be added to the growing
nucleotide chain, yet lack the necessary hydroxyl
group to continue the growth of the chain. When
added into a reaction at a concentration of about
1%, it ensures that some of the chains of nucleo-
tides are terminated each time that the speciﬁc
nucleotide is added.
Four reactions are run for each sequence; in each
case a normal PCR reaction is set up and a small
(about 1%) concentration of a single dideoxynu-
cleotide added (e.g. ddATP). Only one primer is
added so that only one sequence is produced. The
completed reactions are then run out by gel elec-
trophores and several bands will be detected. Each
band signiﬁes the presence of the chain-terminat-
ing dideoxynucleotide at that position in the nu-
cleotide sequence.
The sequencing process has been further sped up
by the use of ﬂuorescent molecules in the termina-
tion of the DNA chains, which can be read by a
computer, allowing automation of the reading
process.
Southern blotting
Southern blotting is a method by which speciﬁc
genes or polymorphisms can be detected – in light
of more modern techniques, this is becoming in-
creasingly rare. The genomes of cells can be isolated
and broken into fragments by restriction enzymes.
The resulting DNA fragments are separated by gel
electrophoresis. The DNA fragments can then be
transferred on to a membrane through blotting of
the membrane directly on to the electrophoretic gel.
DEFINITION Restriction enzymes
Restriction enzymes are endonuclease enzymes
that cut DNA at a speciﬁc palindromic DNA se-
quence, where the sequence on the complemen-
tary strand is identical (e.g. EcoR1, a very commonly
used restriction enzyme, cuts DNA with the se-
quence GAATTC). These enzymes are found in
many species of bacteria, where they are thought
to be part of the defence against viral infection. The
target sequenceof the enzymes may be found in the
cell’s DNA, but they are protected through methyl-
ation of the bacterial cell DNA, which does not occur
in viral DNA.
In molecular biology, restriction enzymes allow
speciﬁc cutting of DNA fragments, through the
relatively rarity of the target sequence, and this can
be used to isolate speciﬁc fragments of DNA, or
detect polymorphisms.
The fragments can then be ‘probed’ for a speciﬁc
sequence. A probe DNA is constructed with a
sequence exactly complementary to the region in
question, which is then conjugated to a marker –
typically a radioactive label. Once the excess probe
is washed away an X-ray ﬁlm can be applied, and
the sites where the probe has bound to its com-
plementary sequence will be detectable.
Southern blotting has been used to detect many
of polymorphisms that are used in genetic linkage
studies and can be used to determine allele of a
gene that someone possesses. The northern and
western blots are similar techniques that have
been developed to investigate RNA and protein,
respectively. In the case of a western blot, the
presence of a particular protein can be detected
by an antibody that is speciﬁc to it.

Biochemistry
All processes in the body rely on complex interac-
tions between macromolecules, the precursors of
which are obtained through the diet. There are four
classes of macromolecules:
1 Proteins are made up of amino acids. Some
proteins have a structural or transport role,
whereas others are enzymes that catalyse met-
abolic reactions.
2 Lipids provide a concentrated store of energy, as
well as making up a large component of the cell
membrane and – as steroids – have a crucial role
in signalling.
3 Carbohydrates
provide
a
store
of
energy
and may be involved in signalling through
their action as ligands for many cell-surface
receptors.
4 Nucleic acids encode the genetic information
necessary for the synthesis of all other molecules
in the cell. Their role is described in more detail
in Chapter 2.
Proteins
Proteins are made up of amino acids linked by
peptide bonds. The different amino acids in pro-
teins interact to cause a speciﬁc folding pattern
resulting in a molecule with a complex structure
and a speciﬁc function.
The structure of an amino acid is conserved,
with a basic ‘skeleton’ and a single group (the ‘R’
group) which differs between molecules. It is a
zwitterion, a molecule containing both positively
and negatively charged groups. Although around
50 different amino acids are found in nature, only
20 are used by the body. The classiﬁcation of an
amino acid is based on its ‘R’ group. Amino acids
may be classiﬁed by charge (Fig. 3.1):
. Charged polar – the ‘R’ group is ionic (e.g.
glutamic acid)
. Uncharged polar – the ‘R’ group is a dipole (e.g.
glycine)
. Non-polar – the ‘R’ group carries no charge (e.g.
alanine).
Proline is an unusual amino acid, because its
side chain is bonded back on to the molecule. This
creates an unusual shape that can greatly alter
protein structure.
The carbon in the skeleton of amino acids is a
chiral centre (except in glycine), around which the
amino acids exhibit stereoisomerism. In the
human body, all amino acids are of the L form.
DEFINITION Stereoisomerism
In organic molecules, a carbon atom is bonded
to four different groups. This carbon atom is known
as a chiral centre and produces stereoisomerism.
The four groups are arranged tetrahedrally in
three dimensions around the chiral centre. It is
possible to generate two different arrangements
that cannot be superimposed on each other, no
matter how the whole molecule is arranged in
space. When drawn in two dimensions, the isoforms
appearidentical;however,theyhavedifferentstruc-
tures in three dimensions. This is stereoisomerism.
Each stereoisomer has two forms: D and L; these
refer to their properties in refracting light. The body
uses only the L form of amino acids, whereas many
microorganisms can utilise the D form (e.g. in the
formation of a peptidoglycan).

DEFINITION Dipole
A dipole is a molecule that has mild changes in
charge; this is usually the result of an electronega-
tive molecule, such as oxygen, attracting electrons
to create this mild difference in charge. Although
these differences are mild compared with those
caused by the gain or loss of electrons, they can
create signiﬁcant effects in interactions between
molecules.
Protein structure
There are ﬁve forces that contribute to folding of a
protein into its three-dimensional structure:
. Van der Waal’s forces are result from changes of
electron density (and thus minute changes in the
charge) between neighbouring groups. The sum
of all these forces can be signiﬁcant, although
each individual interaction is very weak.
. Hydrogen bonding is a non-covalent interaction
in polar molecules resulting from the interaction
of hydrogen atoms with an electronegative atom,
such as nitrogen or oxygen. Hydrogen groups are
found in both the backbone of the protein and
the side chains, and help to stabilise the
structure.
. Electrostatic interactions can occur between
the different ‘R’ groups and are found in three
types;
they
are
often
stronger
than
the
interactions resulting from hydrogen bonding.
The different types are a result of combinations
of dipoles and charged groups which may
interact; from the strongest to the weakest,
these are:
– charge–charge interactions
– charge–dipole interactions
– dipole–dipole interactions.
. Disulphide bonds are an extremely strong cova-
lent interaction resulting from bonding of sul-
phide groups on cysteine side chains. These
bonds help to stabilise the protein structure.
. Hydrophobic interactions rely on the interac-
tions of the ‘R’ groups and the water in the
protein’s immediate environment. Hydropho-
bic regions of a protein interact to pack closely
together,
and
reduce
direct
contact
with
water molecules. These interactions result in
the formation of hydrophobic pockets within
a protein.
Levels of proteins organisation
There are four sequential levels of organisation
that are used to explain the structure of a
protein.
First, the primary structure is the order of
the amino acids in the polypeptide chain. It is
these amino acids that determine the features
of the higher level of structure.
Second, the secondary structure results from
the complex interactions of amino acids in the
protein, as a result of hydrogen bonding, electro-
static interactions, van der Waal’s forces and
hydrophobic interactions. These contribute to
the production of a structure with the lowest free
energy. Three forms of secondary structure can be
identiﬁed:
1 a Helices are the most common form of sec-
ondary structure. The amino acids form a right-
handed helix with the side chains located on
the outside of the helix. a Helices form as a
result of hydrogen bonding between the C¼O
and N–H groups in the amino acid backbone.
Some amino acids, such as alanine and methi-
onine, preferentially form a helices. Others,
such as serine and tyrosine, tend not to. Proline
disrupts the a-helix structure because its cyclic
structure prevents the formation of a hydrogen
bond.
2 b Sheets are made up of many lengths of poly-
peptide lying next to each other. The side chains
of the amino acids appear on alternate sides of
the b sheet. Strands in the sheet may be parallel –
each
strand
runs
in
the
same
direction
in reference to its N and C termini; or they may
be antiparallel, when they run in opposite
directions.

ture regions; typically they contain polar resi-
dues,becausetheyarelikely tobeincontact with
water. Loop regions may also have a functional
role, forming the binding sites on antibodies and
some forms of receptor.
The tertiary structure is produced by the orga-
nisation of secondary structural regions into func-
tional domains. Such domains are often encoded
by individual exons in a gene. Again, there are
common structural arrangements the tertiary

Amino acids
Amino acids share the same conserved 
structure, varying only in the side chain, 
marked by the ‘R’. It is this chain that 
contributes to the different properties of 
the amino acid. Linkage of molecules is 
through the formation of peptide 
linkages.
Fats
The triglyceride fat is made up of one 
molecule of glycerol that is linked to 
three fatty acids by ester linkages. This 
produces a highly compact molecule, 
used for the storage of energy. 
Phospholipids have a similar structure, 
although one of the fatty acyl chains is 
replaced by a polar head group and 
phosphate molecule.
Carbohydrates
The most common form of carbohy-
drates in the body is the hexose sugars 
– of which glucose and fructose are 
common examples. These hexose 
sugars are a significant energy source 
within the body and can be bound 
together by a glycoside bond to 
produce sucrose – the form in which 
sugar is commonly ingested. in 
addition, there may be five-carbon and 
three-carbon sugars. They have a 
similar shape, with a central ring 
consisting of carbons and a single 
oxygen molecule.

Biochemistry 43

complex folding and mediate the structure of the
protein. The side chains may have hydrophobic
regions that mediate the tight packing, minimis-
ing contact with water molecules.
. b Domains are found where there are collections
of the b sheets
. a/b-Domain structures form from a mixture of
a-helix and b-sheet regions and represent a very
common structural motif. They often have a
structural or a functional role.
Finally a protein may be made up of several
distinct polypeptide chains. The way in which these
interact is known as the quaternary structure.
Lipids
Lipids are non-polar molecules that have a role in
the formation of the cell membrane and the stor-
age of energy, as well as in signalling. Three types of
lipids with distinct functions can be identiﬁed:
. Triglycerides
. Phospholipids
. Sterols.
Triglycerides
Triglycerides are made up of a glycerol molecule
joined to one to three fatty acids through ester links
(Fig. 3.1). The fatty acid chains contain a long
carbon chain that is non-polar and a carboxylic
acid group that is charged. The high concentration
of carbon in fats makes them a compact energy
store. Both saturated and unsaturated fats are used
in the human body.
DEFINITION Saturated and unsaturated
lipids
Lipids can be deﬁned as saturated and unsaturat-
ed, as a result of the presence or absence of double
bonds in their acyl chains. Saturated lipids have no
double bonds – the carbon chain is fully saturated
with covalently bonded hydrogen.
Phospholipids
Phospholipids make up much of the cell mem-
brane. These are made up of glycerol, which binds
two fatty acid chains at C-1and C-2. C-3 isbound to
a phosphate and a head group which may be basic,
neutral or polar.
Sterols
Sterols contain a well-deﬁned ring structure: three
six-carbon rings, a ﬁve-carbon ring and a side
chain. Sterols can be synthesised in the body, and
may be found free or attached to long-chain fatty
acids. They form the basis of many hormones and
also make up bile salts which help with the ab-
sorption of fats.
The role of lipids
Lipids fulﬁl three major roles in the body:
1 Energy source: lipids generate around seven
ATP molecules for the oxidation of one carbon,
as opposed to ﬁve ATP molecules per carbon in
carbohydrates
2 Structural roles: lipids form barriers to prevent
the diffusion of polar molecules. Phospholipids
are specialised for the production membranes
because their amphipathic nature (having both
hydrophobic and hydrophilic components) pro-
motes the formation of a phospholipid bilayer.
3 Signalling molecules: steroid hormones, which
are derived from sterols, cause widespread
changes in the body. They are able to diffuse
freely into cells and bind cellular receptors that
alter gene expression. Signalling is also achieved
through other forms of lipids, such as phospha-
tidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is
crucial for calcium signalling. In addition,
leukotrienes and prostaglandins, mediators of
inﬂammation, are derived from the lipid arachi-
donic acid.
Carbohydrates (sugars)
Sugars are made up of a carbon ring, and take the
basic form (CH2O)n:
. Hexose (six-carbon) sugars are important as an
energy source in the body.
. Ribose (ﬁve-carbon) sugars are important for
the production of nucleic acids.
. Triose (three-carbon) sugars may be used in
some steps of glycolysis.
Types of carbohydrate
Carbohydrates are built up of single sugar blocks –
monosaccharides. The most important monosac-
charide in the body is glucose (see Fig. 3.1). This is
used in glycolysis and can be converted to ﬁve-
carbon sugars via the pentose phosphate pathway.
44
Biochemistry

Monosaccharides may be linked together to
produce disaccharides, through the formation of
a glycosidic bond. Three particularly important
disaccharides are:
1 Sucrose – formed from fructose and glucose
2 Maltose – formed from two glucose molecules
3 Lactose – formed from glucose and galactose.
The formation of further glycosidic bonds allows
the formation of polysaccharides; in particular
glycogen, a rapidly mobilised energy source, is
produced in the liver and muscles. In the diet
starch, a plant polysaccharide, is an important
source of carbohydrate.
The role of carbohydrates
Carbohydrates have a role in four main areas:
1 Energy through glycolysis and further down-
stream processes. Much of this carbohydrate is
obtained by the breakdown of ingested starch.
2 Structural, in particular through its contribu-
tions to the extracellular matrix.
3 Modiﬁcation of other molecules involved in cell
signalling, especially those in the surface.
4 Nucleotide synthesis.
Metabolic biochemistry
Principles of metabolism
Metabolismisthe processthatlivingsystemsuseto

cules necessary for their continued function and

pounds to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the
energy currency in the cell. ATP releases energy

ingadenosinemonophosphate(AMP)oradenosine

DEFINITION Anabolism and catabolism
Metabolic reactions can be divided into two types:
1 Catabolic reactions break down a substrate.
2 Anabolic reactions are ones in which a mol-
ecule is synthesised from substrate.
Control of metabolism
There are different levels of regulation of metab-
olism from global control to regulate entire body
processes, to controls to meet the needs of indi-
vidual cells.
Short-term controls
These controls allow tight control of metabolism in
the individual cell, in response to the speciﬁc
conditions experienced:
. Allosteric regulation involves the non-covalent
interaction of various compounds, triggering
conformational changes in the enzyme. Such
interactions may enhance or inhibit the function
of the enzyme, and allow almost instant changes
in response to rapid changes in the immediate
environment of the cell.
. Covalent modiﬁcation provides a slightly lon-
ger-term form of regulation, which may be in
response to the effects of stimuli external to the
cell (e.g. hormones). In this case the activity of an
enzyme may be modulated by the addition or
removal of covalently bound groups (e.g. phos-
phate) to an enzyme – altering its activity.
Long-term controls
These are the result of chronic changes in the
conditions experienced by the cells, or a response
to widespread signals such as hormones. This in-
volves modulation of gene expression in a cell, and
may take days to come fully into effect.
Cycles between organs
Biochemical cycles can occur between two or more
organs. These are controlled by the rate at which a
substrate can be delivered to the target organ. This
can be illustrated by the Cori cycle, in which
lactate, produced by anaerobic respiration of
glucose, may be converted back to glucose in the
liver. Here the rate-limiting step is often the rate of
delivery of lactate.
The tricarboxylic acid cycle
Thetricarboxylicacid(TCA)cycleisthecentralstep
of aerobic respiration. The products of fat, amino
acid and glucose metabolism feed into this cycle,
which produces reduced co-factors to drive the
electron transport chain. Intermediates of the cy-
cle are used in a variety of other reactions (Fig. 3.2).
The TCA cycle represents the point at which
energy production focuses on the mitochondria.

TCA cycle
The tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle accepts 
acetyl-CoA, which 
binds to oxaloacetate 
to produce citrate. 
Each step of the 
reaction is catalysed 
by different enzymes, 
and results in the 
conversion of citrate 
back to oxaloacetate. 
In the process, two 
carbons are lost as 
CO2 and a molecule of 
GTP synthesised from 
GDP. Importantly, 
several co-factors are 
reduced that generate 
more ATP via their 
transfer of H+ and 
electrons to the 
electron transport 
chain.
The electron transport chain
The electron transport chain is the final acceptor 
for the reduced co-factors NADH and FADH2 
which are produced through many of the metabolic 
reactions within the cell. NADH contributes its 
electrons to complex I in the chain, whereas 
FADH2 is found located within complex II, which is 
not part of the electron transport chain, although it 
donates electrons to coenzyme Q. Electrons travel 
through the chain, being carried between the large 
complex by coenzyme Q and cytochrome c. The 
electrons contribute to the reduction of ion centres 
within the complex, which powers the transport of 
H+ ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane. 
The final acceptor of the electrons is complex IV 
(cytochrome oxidase) which catalyses its reaction 
with H+ and O2 to generate water.
H+ gradient
The H+ gradient generated by the electron 
transport chain can be discharged through a 
variety of proteins to power a variety of cellular 
processes. The vast majority of the gradient is 
discharged through the enzyme ATP synthase, 
powering oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to 
ATP. In addition, the H+ gradient may be use to 
generate heat or to mediate the transport of 
molecules across the inner mitochondrial 
membrane.
Figure 3.2 The tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
46
Biochemistry

It occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria and
accepts intermediates that are generated in the
cytosol or other parts of the cell.
The products of glycolysis and b oxidation of
fatty acids enter the TCA cycle as acetyl-coenzyme
A (acetyl-CoA). A single acetyl-CoA molecule con-
tributes two ATP molecules and two CO2 mole-
cules, as well as generating reduced co-factors that
contribute to the electron transport chain.
Amino acid metabolism also contributes to the
TCA cycle; however, depending on the speciﬁc
amino acid, the resulting metabolites can enter
the cycle at a variety of sites. Similarly, removal of
speciﬁc TCA cycle intermediates may be used for
the synthesis of new amino acids.
Electron transport chain
Throughoutthemetabolicprocesses,co-factorsare
reduced by hydrogen. These reduced co-factors
donate H þ ions and electrons (e ) to the electron
transport chain in the mitochondria (see Fig. 3.2).
The electron transport chain is located on the
inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of
three major complexes (I, II and IV) linked by
mobile electron carriers, which accept e  and use
it to generate an H þ gradient across the inner
mitochondrial membrane.
NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucle-
otide) is a co-factor generated during the TCA cycle
(and other cellular processes). It donates electrons
to complex I, whereas FADH2 (another co-factor,
reduced ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide) is part of
complex II, and does not contribute to the move-
ment of as many H þ ions because its electrons join
the chain at a later point than those of NADH. The
ﬁnal acceptor is cytochrome oxidase (complex IV),
which catalyses the transfer of electrons from cy-
tochrome c to oxygen and H þ to produce H2O.
The energy released in the electron transport
chain is used to transport H þ across the inner
mitochondrial membrane to create an H þ gradi-
ent; this may be as large as 10 000:1.
Utilisation of the H þ gradient
The H þ gradient produced by the electron trans-
portchainhasthreephysiologicallyimportantuses:
1 Synthesis of ATP
2 Inner membrane transport
3 Thermogenesis.
Synthesis of ATP
Much of the H þ gradient is converted into ATP as it
ﬂows through ATP synthase. This enzyme is made
up of F1 and F0 subunits; the addition of phosphate
to ADP is catalysed in the F1 subunit, whereas the
ﬂow of electrons through the transmembrane F0
subunit catalyses the release of ATP from the
protein’s active site. The F1 particle consists of six
subunits which make up three active sites in a
rotary arrangement. The reaction is highly efﬁ-
cient: one NADH molecule capable of producing
three ATP molecules.
Inner membrane transport
The transport of molecules across the inner mito-
chondrial membrane is highly regulated; many
substances must be transported actively using
energy derived from the H þ gradient. This is an
extremely expensive process – around 25% of the
H þ gradient is thought to be expended in the
movement of ATP and ADP across the inner
mitochondrial membrane.
The proton gradient is used electrogenically – to
neutralise an electric charge. In the case of the
adenine nucleotide translocator, ATP is translo-
cated out of the mitochondrion for one molecule of
ADP  and one H þ is expended to neutralise the
extra negative charge.
Thermogenesis
The brown adipose tissue, which is particularly
prominent in newborn babies because they are
incapable of shivering, can utilise the H þ gradient
for heat generation. Thermogenesis is mediated
by proton ﬂow through the protein thermogenin,
which converts the released energy into heat.
Carbohydrate metabolism
Carbohydrates in the diet must be broken down
into monosaccharides by a variety of enzymes in
the gut. The major carbohydrate metabolised in
the body is glucose, although fructose and galac-
tose
are
also
signiﬁcant
additional
sources
(Fig. 3.3).
In an average individual, a little less than 200 g
glucose is essential for the body each day. This may
be as glucose, or another sugar (such as fructose)
that is converted to glucose.

Biochemistry

A supply of glucose is essential for the body, be-
cause some tissues are capable of using only glucose:
. The brain – aerobic respiration, although ketones
can be used in starvation
. Red blood cells – anaerobic respiration
. Renal medulla – anaerobic respiration, due to
the low oxygen environment found at the inter-
face of the renal medulla and cortex.
Uptake of glucose
Glucose enters cells by passive diffusion. There are
5 classes of GLUT transporter which are respon-
sible for uptake into many cells of the body:
1 GLUT1: found on red blood cells and not regu-
lated by insulin. These transporters constantly
take up glucose from the blood.
2 GLUT2: expressed in pancreatic b cells and the
liver. GLUT2 transporters can transport large
amounts of glucose, allowing rapid sensing of
changes in the body’s glucose levels; GLUT2 is
also expressed in the intestines to help absorp-
tion of glucose.
3 GLUT3: similar to GLUT1 transporters and
found in the brain. These transporters also con-
stantly take up glucose in an insulin-indepen-
dent manner.
4 GLUT4: regulated tightly by insulin and respon-
sible for the uptake of surplus glucose to main-
tainaconstantbloodglucoselevel.GLUT4trans-
porters are expressed inthe muscles andadipose
tissue; a large number of transporters are stored
in vesicles in the cell, such that they can be
rapidly expressed on the cell surface.
5 GLUT5: transporters are responsible for the
uptake of fructose from the gut. Glucose is
not taken up in the gut by a GLUT transporter,
but by a sodium co-transporter (SGLT).
Glycolysis
Glycolysis is the process by which glucose is
broken down; Glycolysis directly generates two
ATP molecules per glucose molecule, although the
products and reduced co-factors formed can con-
tribute to the formation of far more ATP molecules
in aerobic respiration. In the glycolytic pathway,
there are three critical reactions that regulate the
process:
1 Phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase or
glucokinase
2 Phosphorylationbyphosphofructokinase(PFK)
3 Phosphorylation by pyruvate kinase.
Hexokinase and glucokinase
Both hexokinase and glucokinase phosphorylate
glucose; this commits the use of the glucose to that
cell, although not necessarily to glycolysis. The
presence of two different enzymes with the same
task reﬂects the different needs and roles of the
cells in which they are expressed.
Hexokinase is expressed in most cells in the
body and capable of phosphorylating many sugars
other than glucose. It is inhibited by its own prod-
uct, glucose 6-phosphate, preventing commit-
ment of too much glucose to an individual cell.
Hexokinase has a high afﬁnity for glucose, so it is
capable of trapping glucose in a cell at low con-
centrations. The rate at which the enzyme can
catalyse its reaction (Vmax) is very low, preventing
it from phosphorylating large amounts of glucose.
Glucokinase has a similar speciﬁcity for sugars
to hexokinase, and is expressed in the liver and b
cells of the pancreatic islets. It isadapted for coping
with large amounts of glucose and has a much
higher Vmax than hexokinase; however, it also has a
lower afﬁnity for glucose, so that it operates effec-
tively at high glucose levels. Its action is not in-
hibited by the reaction product.
Phosphofructokinase
The phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to
fructose 1,6-bisphospate is the crucial enzymatic
step that commits a molecule to glycolysis.
Figure 3.3 Glycolysis. Glucose can be used for a variety of reactions. Glycolysis is crucial for the generation of
energy and produces a net gain of two molecules of ATP per glucose, although under aerobic conditions it also
contributes two NADH molecules and two molecules of acetyl-CoA which may enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle. Under anaerobic conditions, the NADH is required to convert pyruvate into lactate. Glucose synthesis is
possible in these cells by the conversion of pyruvate or oxaloacetate to phosphenolpyruvate. The three regulatory
reactionsof glycolysis maybe bypassedby the useof alternativeenzymes.Glucosecan alsobe sequestered for the
production of glycogen or converted to other forms of sugar by the pentose phosphate shunt.

Biochemistry 49

The enzyme is regulated by many substances that
reﬂects the energy needs of the cell:
. PFK is inhibited by ATP, signalling a plentiful
energy supply in the cell, and hence no need for
increased metabolism. It is also inhibited by
citrate, an intermediate of the TCA cycle, another
indicator of high-energy concentrations.
. PFK activity is promoted by AMP, a product of
the breakdown of ATP, signalling low energy levels.
In many cells (particularly the liver) the typical
concentration of ATP is too high to allow PFK to
function. This is overcome by the presence of an
activating molecule – fructose 2,6-bisphosphate –
which increases the afﬁnity of PFK for fructose
6-phosphate,
overcoming
the
ATP-mediated
inhibition of PFK.
Generation and regulation of fructose 2,6-
bisphosphate are by the enzyme phosphofructo-
kinase-2; it is broken down by fructose bispho-
sphatase-2. Both enzymes are found as discrete
domains on a single protein molecule. While it is
phosphorylated, the phosphatase domain is active;
when it is dephosphorylated, the kinase domain is
active. This process allows very tight regulation, so
that the level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and
thus the rate of glycolysis, can be rapidly altered.
Pyruvate kinase
This enzyme controls the release of pyruvate from
the glycolytic pathway to the TCA cycle. It is in-
hibited by ATP, reﬂecting control in relation to the
energy needs of the cell. Pyruvate kinase is also
inhibited by alanine, an amino acid that can con-
tribute to the TCA cycle at the same point. In
addition, pyruvate kinase is upregulated by fruc-
tose 1,6-bisphosphate, anticipating its require-
ment further down the pathway.
The fate of pyruvate
In aerobic conditions the products of glycolysis
can be further oxidised by pyruvate dehydroge-
nase to release more energy. This leads to the
breakdown of pyruvate, the end-product of glycol-
ysis,
into
acetyl-CoA
in
the
mitochondrion.
Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a large multienzyme
complex that contains several copies of the three
protein subunits, and the necessary co-factors,
including NAD þ and FAD. The regulation of py-
ruvate dehydrogenase is inhibited by its products –
NADH and acetyl-CoA – through their action to
promote
activity
of
the
associated
pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase. The presence of AMP – a
signal of low energy within the cell – promotes the
activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase.
In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate cannot be
converted to acetyl-CoA and is converted to lac-
tate, by lactate dehydrogenase. In sites of low
oxygen (e.g. the renal medulla) this is common.
The conversion of pyruvate to lactate requires the
oxidation of NADH. As such, the net gain of ATP per
glucose molecule is two ATP molecules released
during glycolysis. Lactate formation occurs in
muscles under exercise – this is released into the
blood, where it can be converted back to glucose in
the liver or used as a source of energy.
The utilisation of lactate
Lactate dehydrogenase is a tetrameric isoenzyme
made up of two types of subunits. The M subtype is
prevalent in muscle, which catalyses the conver-
sion of pyruvate to lactate, as occurs in anaerobic
glycolysis. In the liver and heart, the H subtype is
prevalent which promotes the conversion of lac-
tate to pyruvate; this generates ATP through the
TCA cycle. In the liver lactate is used to generate
glucose by gluconeogenesis.
Metabolism of other
monosaccharides
Although glucose is the major monosaccharide
used by the body, a normal diet contains signiﬁ-
cant quantities of other monosaccharides, in par-
ticular fructose and galactose. These sugars are
converted into intermediates that are appropriate
for breakdown via the glycolytic pathway.
Fructose makes up 10–20% of a normal western
diet; it enters cells in an insulin-independent manner
and is phosphorylated by the enzyme, fructokinase.
Fructose then joins the glycolytic pathway, after its
breakdown byaldolaseB,to produceglyceraldehyde.
CLINICAL Hereditary fructose
intolerance
Aldolase B is responsible for the breakdown of
fructose 1-phosphate. This enzyme is missing in
those individuals with hereditary fructose intoler-
ance, leading to accumulation of fructose. This
results in hypoglycaemia, vomiting, jaundice and
haemorrhage; liver failure may result.
Treatment is by removal of fructose and sugars
that contain fructose (such as sucrose) from the diet.
50
Biochemistry

Galactose is derived from dairy products and,
similar to other monosaccharides, requires phos-
phorylation for metabolism. The conversion of
galactose to uridine diphosphate (UDP)-galactose
allows it to be transformed to UDP-glucose which
can be used for glycolysis.
Pentose phosphate pathway
Five-carbon sugars are an essential component in
nucleotide bases and produced from glucose.
The ﬁrst reaction in the pentose phosphate
pathway (PPP), catalysed by glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, commitsthe molecule to this path-
way. Molecules of glucose 6-phosphate are oxidised
to form ribulose 5-phosphate and CO2. Two mole-
cules of NADPþ are also reduced to NADPH.
The second series of reactions are reversible and
produce a series of different length sugars. These
reactions are regulated to ensure there is a sufﬁ-
cient supply of different length intermediates
which may be required by other metabolic path-
ways in the cell.
The regulation of the diversion of sugars to the
PPP is through the NADP þ/NADPH balance. The
reduced form (NADPH or reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate) of the co-factor
inhibits
the
function
of
glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase.
NADPH is a critical co-factor in the body; it is
used in the liver in the production of fatty acids and
in the adrenal cortex for the production of steroid
hormones. It is also involved in the protection
against damage by reactive oxygen intermediates.
CLINICAL Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deﬁciency
NADPH is a crucial co-factor that can mediate the
removal of reactive oxygen intermediates. Glucose-
6-phosphate dehydrogenase deﬁciency is an X-
linked recessive disorder in which individuals are
less able to detoxify these intermediates due to
reduced levels of NADPH. This leads to a chronic
anaemia caused by repeated damage to red blood
cells, in which the sole means of generating NADPH
is via this pathway. Often the deﬁciency is mild, and
does not manifestclinicallyunlessoxidant drugsare
used or fava beans are ingested; these require
NADPH in their breakdown. In both cases a hae-
molytic anaemia results.
Storage of glucose as glycogen
The majority of excess glucose is converted to fat, a
much more compact storage medium. A small
amount of glucose is stored as glycogen. This large
polymer can be rapidly broken down to glucose to
regulate blood glucose levels. The key synthetic
reaction is the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate
to glucose 1-phosphate, and then its integration
into
glycogen.
The
addition
of
glucose
1-
phosphate to glycogen is mediated by glycogen
synthase.
Glycogen is generated by the progressive addi-
tion of glucose to a primer protein, glycogenin.
This reaction requires UDP-glucose as the glucose
donor and is catalysed by the enzyme glycogen
synthase.
The
glycogen
molecule
is
highly
branched through the action of a branching en-
zyme. Branching is beneﬁcial because it:
. makes glycogen highly soluble
. increases the number of terminal residues for
breakdown of glycogen into glucose.
Glycogen is broken down from the terminal
residues to produce glucose 1-phosphate, which
is rapidly converted to glucose 6-phosphate.
Regulation of glycogen synthesis and degrada-
tion is achieved through the activation of glycogen
synthase by glucose 6-phosphate, ensuring that
glycogen is synthesised when there is excess sub-
strate. Similarly, glucose 6-phosphate inhibits
glycogen breakdown by inhibiting glycogen phos-
phorylase, as does ATP.
Gluconeogenesis
Gluconeogenesis, the process by which glucose is
generated from non-carbohydrates, occurs in the
liver. Those substrates that enter at an intermedi-
ate point in the TCA cycle are not completely
metabolised before they can be removed from the
cycle for gluconeogenesis. Fatty acids enter the
TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA and cannot be used to
generate glucose; the acetyl-CoA must undergo
the complete series of TCA reactions to reach the
point where a suitable metabolic intermediate can
be removed for gluconeogenesis; in this time
two-carbon molecules of acetyl-CoA have been
metabolised into CO2.
The process of gluconeogenesis is very similar to
glycolysis; however, the three points of control in
Biochemistry 51

glycolysis are bypassed by different reactions
(see Fig. 3.3):
1 Hexokinaseisbypassedbyahydrolysisreaction.
2 PFK is bypassed by a hydrolysis reaction.
3 Pyruvate kinase is bypassed by two reactions.
The gluconeogenetic pathway occurs in all
tissues, but glucose-6-phosphatase is expressed
only in the liver. Non-liver tissue lacks this
enzyme, so any glucose that is produced by glu-
coneogenesis must be retained in the cell.
Bypass of pyruvate kinase
Bypass of the reaction mediated by pyruvate kinase
is achieved in two stages:
1 Pyruvate carboxylase triggers the formation of
pyruvate from oxaloacetate.
2 Oxaloacetate is removed from the mitochondri-
on by the malate shuttle (where is it reduced
to malate for transport and then converted
back in the cytoplasm) and is converted to
phosphenolpyruvate.
Bypass of PFK and hexokinase
The PFK-mediated phosphorylation of fructose 6-
phosphate is reversed by a hydrolysis reaction
mediated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.
The phosphorylation by hexokinase is reversed
by
glucose-6-phosphatase.
Most
tissues
lack
glucose-6-phosphatase, so that any glucose pro-
duced by the gluconeogenetic pathway is retained
in the tissues and not released into the blood.
However, the liver expresses glucose-6-phospha-
tase which allows it to contribute glucose to the
blood if needed.
Control of glucose metabolism
Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis must be tightly
regulated to prevent the generation of a futile
cycle in which the products of one are immediately
used by the other, resulting in the expenditure of
energy for no useful gain. Glycolysis yields two ATP
and two NADH molecules per glucose molecule,
whereas two pyruvate molecules in gluconeogen-
esis require two NADH and six triphosphate
molecules (four ATP and two GTP) to produce one
glucose molecule, representing a net loss of
energy.
Control of glucose pathways is through cAMP
(adenosine cyclic 30:50-monophosphate) signalling
in the liver, in response to glucagon. The resulting
rise in cAMP and associated signalling stimulates
gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycolysis:
. Pyruvate kinase is inhibited by cAMP-dependent
protein kinase.
. PFK is activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
which is reduced in response to cAMP, prevent-
ing glycolysis during glucagon signalling. Con-
versely, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is inhibited
by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and is thus activat-
ed during the cAMP-associated events of gluca-
gon signalling.
Fat metabolism
Fats account for around 75% of the total energy
stores. They are easily mobilised and there is no
loss of body function if such stores become de-
pleted. Each carbon atom in carbohydrates con-
tributes around ﬁve ATP molecules, whereas each
carbon atom in fats contributes around seven ATP
molecules.
Absorption of fat
Fats are insoluble in water and tend to accumulate
in globules on the intestinal lumen. They are emul-
siﬁed by bile salts toincrease their surface area; this
improves the activity of pancreatic lipase which
breaks triglycerides into two fatty acid chains and a
monoacylglycerol molecule for absorption into the
epithelial cells.
The fatty acids are packaged in micelles – small
spherical particles that are produced as a result of
the interactions between water and the hydropho-
bic elements of fatty acids.
Transport of fatty acids around the
body
Fats represent an easily mobilised energy store that
can be transported from adipose tissue to sites
where energy production is required. The trans-
port of fats is mediated by lipoproteins.
After absorption of fats by the intestinal cells,
they are packaged into chylomicrons, which are
secreted into the lymphatic vessels and trans-
ported around the body to sites of storage.
52
Biochemistry

DEFINITION Chylomicrons
Chylomicrons are particles made up of a high pro-
portion of lipids packaged around proteins. These
particles are produced by the intestinal cells after
absorption of dietary fats. They are released into the
lymph and taken up by adipose tissue. The latter
expresseslipoproteinlipasesontheendothelialcells
ofitscapillaries,toreleasethecomponentfattyacids
from chylomicrons for absorption and storage.
Transport of fatty acids into the cell
As fatty acids are lipid soluble, entry into the cell
across the cell membrane occurs by diffusion.
Fatty acid molecules are rapidly converted to fatty
acyl-CoA in the cytosol by fatty acyl-CoA synthe-
tase. Fatty acids and acyl-CoA molecules can be
transported around the cytoplasm by fatty acid-
binding proteins, allowing their transport in the
cytoplasm, in which they are otherwise insoluble.
The polar nature of the acyl-CoA prevents its
transport across the inner membrane, so a spe-
cialised carnitine shuttle is required to transport
the fatty acyl chain into the mitochondrion
(Fig. 3.4).
Carnitine acyltransferase I is located in the cy-
tosol and catalyses the transfer of the fatty acyl
group from the acyl-CoA to the carnitine molecule,
forming O-acylcarnitine; a similar enzyme, carni-
tine acyltransferase II, catalyses the reverse reac-
tion in the mitochondrial matrix. Transport of
carnitine (with or without the fatty acid molecule
attached) is mediated by a speciﬁc carrier protein
in the membrane.
Malonyl-CoA, a substrate for the generation of
fatty acids, inhibits the action of carnitine acyl-
transferase I, preventing the simultaneous degra-
dation and synthesis of fatty acids.
b Oxidation of fatty acids
After their transport into the mitochondrial matrix,
fatty acids are broken down into two-carbon
blocks to release acetyl-CoA, for metabolism by
the TCA cycle. As there is less oxygen in fat than in
carbohydrates, it is possible to produce more ATP
molecules per carbon through aerobic respiration.
b Oxidation occurs for fatty acids that are no longer
than 16–18 carbon atoms in length. Fatty acids
longer than 16–18 carbon atoms in length are ﬁrst
processed in peroxisomes, although this does not
provide any energy for the cell.
Oxidation of other forms of fatty acid
chains
The basic b-oxidation pathway is capable of re-
leasing energy from saturated fatty acids with even
numbers of carbon atoms. Many fatty acids in the
diet are not in this form:
. Oxidation of fatty acids with odd numbers of
carbons is achieved by b oxidation until a three-
carbon molecule remains. This is metabolised to
produce succinyl-CoA, an intermediate of the
TCA cycle.
. Branched-chain fatty acids cannot always be
oxidised in the two-carbon blocks seen in b
oxidation. The enzyme a-hydroxylase is used to
remove single carbon units, allowing b oxidation
to proceed. This is particularly important for the
metabolism of the plant-derived fatty acid phy-
tanic acid.
. Longer chain fatty acids (>16–18 carbon atoms
in length) are ﬁrst oxidised in the peroxisomes,
before being transferred to the mitochondria for
b oxidation.
Fatty acid synthesis
Excess glucose and amino acids are converted to
fatty acids, which are ultimately stored in adipose
tissue. The reactions that mediate the production
of fatty acids are very similar to those in b oxida-
tion,
although
there
are
several
important
differences:
. Different enzymes catalyse the two processes.
. Different locations: synthesis occurs in the cy-
toplasm; b oxidation occurs in the mitochondrial
matrix
. Different carriers: in b oxidation, the intermedi-
ates of the reaction are carried by coenzyme A
whereas, in synthesis, the intermediates are car-
ried by the acyl-carrying protein.
. Different co-factors: NAD þ and FAD are co-
factors for b oxidation, whereas NADPH is the
co-factor for synthesis.
The key regulatory step is the production of
malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The re-
maining synthetic reactions proceed to add two-
carbon units on to the fatty acid chain. These
reactions are all catalysed by a single enzyme
complex, fatty acid synthase.
Biochemistry 53

Fatty acid synthase contains several subunits
on a single complex; the growing fatty acid chain is
retained by an acyl-carrier protein, which is itself
part of the complex. This allows rapid production
through minimisation of the loss of intermediates.
The ﬁnal product of fatty acid synthesis is the
16-carbon palmitate. After production, palmitate
is bound to glycerol molecules to produce a
triacylglyceride, which is how fat is stored in the
body.

Figure 3.4 The transport and metabolisms of fatty acids. The important steps of transport, and the key metabolic
reactions involving fatty acids, occur in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. Transport of fatty acids to the mitochondria
is achieved via the carnitine shuttle because fatty acyl-CoA (the form in which it is found within the cell) cannot be
transported across the cell membrane. The product of the breakdown of fatty acids by b oxidation is acetyl-CoA,
which may be used to generate energy through entering the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It may also be used to
produce ketone bodies, which are an important source of energy in infants and in adults under starvation. Transport
of acetyl-CoA to the cytoplasm allows its conversion into fatty acids by the fatty acid synthase enzyme complex, and
its subsequent conversion to triglycerides for storage.
54
Biochemistry

Ketogenesis
Fatty acids are mobilised and metabolised during
fasting through the production of ketones by the
liver. These four-carbon derivatives are water sol-
uble and can reach high levels in the blood in
prolonged fasting. In addition, they are preferen-
tially metabolised by a wide variety of tissues,
maintaining the glucose for tissues incapable of
switching to another energy source. Ketone bodies
are taken up by cells, where they are converted
back to acetyl-CoA.
Regulation of fat metabolism
The regulation of fatty acid synthesis and b oxida-
tion of fats by internal and hormonal signals must
be integrated:
. The presence of malonyl-CoA in the cytoplasm
inhibits the transport of fatty acids into the mi-
tochondria, to prevent b oxidation.
. Internal signals may alter the activity of acetyl-
CoA carboxylase. Citrate, a sign of surplus in the
TCA cycle, activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to
promote the production of fatty acids. Convers-
ely, AMP inhibits the enzyme to signal the lack of
energy. Palmitoyl-CoA also inhibits acetyl-CoA
carboxylase – this prevents the production of
fatty acids in a cell that has already taken up
large amounts of fat from the surroundings.
. Hormonal signals modulate the process, reﬂect-
ing the state of readiness of the body as a whole.
Adrenaline and glucagon both signal a need for
energy and inhibit the action of acetyl-CoA car-
boxylase. Conversely, the presence of insulin
signals the plentiful supply of glucose and pro-
motes its conversion into fatty acids through
activation of the enzyme.
Amino acid metabolism
Proteins are broken down into small peptides that
are one to three amino acids long, for absorption in
the gut. After this, they are converted into free
amino acids for release into the circulation; these
amino acids are used to synthesise new protein.
Digestion of proteins
Digestion of proteins starts in the stomach, where
pepsin cleaves protein to produce peptone, a mix-
ture of oligopeptides, which is released into the
small intestine for further digestion.
The digestion of peptides in the intestines is
mediated by the enzymes secreted by the pancre-
as. Endopeptidases, such as trypsin, cleave the
peptides at speciﬁc sites to produce a series of
small peptides, which can be acted on by carbox-
ypeptidases; these remove peptides from the C
terminus of a peptide chain.
Di- and tripeptides, the end-products of amino
acids, are transported into the cells of the gut by
speciﬁc transporters, where they are broken down
into free amino acids, before release into the portal
blood.
Amino acids in the diet
Many amino acids can be synthesised in the body;
however, there are a few that are ‘essential’ – no
synthetic pathway exists for them in the body. The
essential amino acids include methionine, phenyl-
alanine and tryptophan.
Excess amino acids are not easily stored so in-
stead theyare used bythe TCA cycle. Depending on
the site at which the amino acid joins the TCA
cycle, it may contribute to the formation of fatty
acids and/or glucose. During this process, the
removal of nitrogen from the amino acid is essen-
tial. This occurs by producing ammonia and con-
verting it rapidly to urea for excretion from the
body.
Transamination and oxidation of
amino acids
Only the carbon skeleton of amino acids is used for
oxidation, so the amino element must be removed
by a transaminase which transfers the amine group
of the amino acid to a 2-oxoacid (Fig. 3.5).
The
transaminase
process
typically
uses
2-oxoglutarate (a-ketoglutarate) as a recipient for
the amine group. 2-Oxoglutarate is itself generated
from glutamate, through a reaction catalysed by
the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase. It is the
generation of 2-oxoglutarate that regulates much
of the transamination (and thus oxidation) of ami-
no acids.
. ATP and GTP are inhibitors of glutamate dehy-
drogenase activity.
. ADP and GDP are activators of glutamate dehy-
drogenase activity.
The transaminases are speciﬁc to a limited range
of amino acids, although almost all use 2-oxoglu-
tarate as the acceptor.
Biochemistry 55

Metabolism of the carbon skeleton
The carbon skeleton of amino acids provides a 
source of energy; as amino acids cannot be 
stored this breakdown provides the potential for 
the synthesis of other molecules through the entry 
of intermediates into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) 
cycle. The precise point(s) of entry of the amino 
acid varies, due to the varying structure of the 
carbon skeleton. Many amino acids contribute to 
the formation of TCA cycle intermediates, which 
have the potential to produce glucose, or other 
amino acids. Others contribute to the formation of 
acetyl-CoA, which can be metabolised or used to 
generate fat stores.

Urea cycle
The ammonium that is derived from amino acid 
metabolism is highly toxic and must rapidly be 
converted to a more stable form. Within the 
body, it is transported as glutamate and 
converted in the liver to urea via the urea cycle. 
This series of reactions accommodates two 
ammonia molecules in its formation. Urea is 
tolerated at much higher concentrations than 
ammonia, and can be transported freely within 
the bloodstream for excretion by the kidneys.
Figure 3.5 The metabolism of amino acids. The initial step in the metabolism of amino acids is the removal of the
amine group – which enters the urea cycle. The remaining portion of the amino acid is processed such that parts of
the carbon skeleton are broken down to a form that can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
56
Biochemistry

Breakdown of D-amino acids
Although animal cells use L-amino acids in their
proteins, plants and microorganisms may use
D-amino acids, which humans may ingest. D-Amino
acids are deaminated in an oxidative process cat-
alysed by the FAD-dependent enzyme D-amino
oxidase. After oxidative deamination, the resulting
2-oxoacids
may
be
reaminated
to
produce
L-isoforms, or broken down for energy.
Generation of ammonia
The
excess
amine
groups
produced
by
the
transamination reactions must be removed from
the body, either as ammonia or after its subse-
quent conversion to urea. Free ammonia is very
toxic and is transported around the body in
glutamate.
The urea cycle
Most of the ammonia produced in the body is
converted into urea by the periportal cells of the
liver. Urea accounts for around 90% of the nitrogen
that is released in the urine. Both the ammonia and
aspartate that contribute to urea formation are
derived from glutamate:
. Ammonia is released from glutamate through
deamination by glutamate dehydrogenase.
. Aspartate is produced by transamination of ox-
aloacetate by aspartate transaminase.
The reactions of the urea cycle are shared be-
tween the mitochondria and the cytosol of the
cell:
. Glutamate
dehydrogenase
is
found
in
the
mitochondria.
. The ﬁrst two reactions of the ammonia cycle
occur within the mitochondria, because they
provide ammonia that can be used to produce
carbamoyl phosphamide.
The remainder of the urea cycle occurs in the
cytoplasm. After synthesis, urea is released into the
blood, where it is excreted from the body via the
kidneys.
Regulation of the urea cycle is achieved by
altering the enzyme activity at the point of entry.
There is more chronic control of the cycle: high
protein intake results in the upregulation of the
urea cycle enzymes, and a fourfold increase may
occur in 36 hours.
Location of amino acid metabolism
Metabolism in the liver
Most amino acids are ingested in amounts surplus
to the body’s needs in terms of protein synthesis,
although a few are required in larger amounts than
are typically ingested. Consequently, many amino
acids are converted to other types or used to pro-
vide the body with energy. The breakdown and
conversion of amino acids occur in the liver. In
particular, around 30% of the amino acids ingested
in the diet are glutamate or aspartate, yet these
make up a very small proportion of the amino acids
released from the liver.
Metabolism in the renal cortex
The kidney can deal with citrulline and glycine
using them to form glucose and arginine. The
production of arginine is critical to counteract its
usage within the liver in several processes:
. Creatinine synthesis
. Urea synthesis
. Protein synthesis.
Functional compartmentalisation
of metabolism
The organelles of a eukaryotic cell have adapted to
perform speciﬁc metabolic tasks. This compart-
mentalisation allows the localisation of the various
enzymes required to mediate a speciﬁc process. By
isolating a speciﬁc pathway to a single location,
regulation is helped by mediating the rate of sub-
strate transport. Furthermore, isolation prevents
potentially damaging processes in metabolism
from affecting the general cell environment,
through its limitation to one compartment in the
cell (Fig. 3.6). Although the metabolic roles of
organelles are discussed below, a more generalised
outline of the function of organelles is covered in
Chapter 1.
The cell membrane and the
cytoplasm
The cell membrane regulates the entry into and
exit from the cytoplasm of substances via the
presence of transporters and channels. The cyto-
plasm contains many enzymes that can commit
molecules to speciﬁc fates and locations.
Biochemistry 57

Storage of some molecules is possible within the
cytoplasm, particularly glycogen which can be
mobilised for glucose. In addition, the presence
of signalling proteins allows the cytoplasm to in-
tegrate metabolism within the cell to ensure that
conﬂicting pathways are not both activated.
The mitochondria
Complementing its role as the major site of energy
generation in the cell, the mitochondrion is the site
of breakdown of many molecules, leading to re-
lease of energy. In particular, b oxidation of fatty
acids and the oxidation of amino acids occur in the
mitochondrial matrix.
These processes (along with glycolysis, which
occurs in the cytoplasm) feed into the TCA cycle,
which also occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. The
ﬁnal pathway in the generation of ATP is the
electron transport chain, located on the inner mi-
tochondrial membrane.
In the liver, the mitochondrial membrane is the
site of the early reactions of the urea cycle,
separating the ammonia from the rest of the cell,
to reduce the damage that it may cause.
The endoplasmic reticulum and the
Golgi apparatus
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi
apparatus are involved in synthetic processes.
First, they are responsible for the production of
the proteins needed for the metabolic processes
occurring in the rest of the cell. More directly, the
ER and Golgi apparatus are responsible for the
following:
. Synthesis of phospholipids
. Synthesis of membrane proteins
. Detoxiﬁcation
. Assembly of sugars on glycoproteins and lipids.
The lysosomes
Lysosomes are responsible for the breakdown of
molecules into their constituent parts. These can

Biochemistry

then be transferred to other regions of the cell for
reuse in synthetic reactions. Lysosomal enzymes
require an acidic environment to function pro-
perly, which prevents them from acting on other
regions of the cell and damaging the cell’s
integrity.
Peroxisomes
Peroxisomes contribute to both the oxidation
of substrates and the synthesis of lipids and
carbohydrates.
. Oxidation of long-chain fatty acids can occur in
peroxisomes. This does not produce ATP; instead
it produces H2O2 which is removed by catalase in
the peroxisome, to restrict any damage that may
occur if the H2O2 were to enter other compart-
ments of the cell.
. Breakdown of
D-amino acids
is aided
by
peroxisomes, where they are converted into
2-oxoacids.
. Synthesis of lipids can occur within per-
oxisomes; in particular bile salts are produced
in
peroxisomes
through
modiﬁcations
to
cholesterol.
CLINICAL Zellweger syndrome
Zellweger syndrome results from the lack of func-
tional peroxisomes. The features of the condition
vary, but include motor abnormalities, high fore-
head, epicanthus and other facial abnormalities,
epileptic seizures, cataract and hepatomegaly.
Given the severe nature of the condition, few
individuals live longer than 6 months.
Structural biochemistry
Many of the molecules in the body are concerned
with metabolism and generation of energy, and
others with the reactions that maintain the state of
the cell. However, other molecules contribute to
the architecture and organisation of the cell, pro-
viding a framework to allow transport and com-
partmentalisation of the cell. The cell itself can
contribute molecules to inﬂuence the architecture
of the tissue in which it resides.
Intracellular architecture
In the cell, structural components contribute to
three main areas:
1 The organisation of DNA
2 The cytoskeleton
3 The organisation of cellular compartments.
These areas are closely linked, but each is asso-
ciated with a particular group of structures allow-
ing a (somewhat artiﬁcial) distinction to be made.
Histones
DNA in the cell nucleus is an enormously long
molecule, yet it is efﬁciently organised and pack-
aged into the nucleus. Much of this packaging is
achieved by histone proteins, which associate with
the DNA to aid packaging and also act to regulate
gene expression. The role of histones is discussed
in detail in Chapter 2.
Cytoskeleton
The cytoplasm of the cell is not merely made up of
ﬂuid and ions; it contains a complex protein ar-
chitecture that organises the various cellular com-
partments through a scaffold of ﬁbres, allowing
transport between them. Three major classes of
ﬁbres can be identiﬁed:
1 Microtubules (around 20 nm in diameter) con-
tain the protein tubulin and are particularly
important in intracellular transport.
2 Intermediate ﬁlaments (around 10 nm in diam-
eter) are found throughout the cell, reinforcing
cells and organising them within tissues, by
supporting the cell membrane.
3 Actin ﬁlaments (around 7 nm in diameter) rap-
idly polymerise to produce microﬁlaments.
These can regulate the formation of protrusions
incells, suchaslamellopodia –projections of cell
membranes that aid cellular migration – and
changes in cell morphology, as occurs in
phagocytosis.
Organisation of cellular
compartments
Cellular compartments are held in place through
being tethered to the cytoskeleton. This also aids
vesicular transport of materials between cellular
compartments. Special families of proteins allow
Biochemistry 59

the transport and trafﬁcking of compartments, by
exploiting the cytoskeleton’s ﬁlamentous network.
Kinesin is a protein that binds to vesicles through
the kinesin receptor. The other end of kinesin con-
tains two globular heads that bind to microtubules.
Hydrolysis of ATP is required to power the repeated
binding and unbinding that allows a ‘stepping’
process; this moves the kinesin proteins along the
microtubule. Microtubule ﬁbres are deﬁned as hav-
ing a ( þ ) end, which is the end at which the
microtubule is polymerised, and a (  ) end where
the microtubule is broken down. Kinesin is a motor
protein capable of moving towards the ( þ ) end.
There are processes that require movement of
vesicles in the opposite direction, towards the (  )
end of the microtubule. This retrograde process is
achieved by dyneins which work in a similar way to
kinesin.
Extracellular architecture
Cells are organised into tissues that may be con-
nected directly with each other and/or bathed in a
surrounding material, the extracellular matrix.
There are many key components in the extracel-
lular matrix that are crucial for the organisation
and integrity of the tissue. Two key components
that make up a large proportion of the extracellular
matrix can be observed:
. Collagen
. Proteoglycans.
Collagen
Collagen accounts for up to a third of the protein in
the body. A collagen ﬁbril is made up of a repeating
unit of glycine–X–Y (where, frequently, X is proline
and Y is hydroxyproline). This repeating unit of
three amino acids produces a polypeptide helix
with a left-hand twist. Three identical chains make
up a collagen ﬁbre, which is held together by
hydrogen bonding between the different chains
– there is no hydrogen bonding between residues
on the same chain. The resulting ﬁbre is a triple
helix with a right-hand twist.
The collagen ﬁbres align themselves in strong
ﬁbrous sheets, which form a large portion of the
connective tissues in the body. There are different
chains of collagen that can contribute to ﬁbres. The
composition of chains within a ﬁbre allows them to
associate in a variety of ways to generate covalently
linked collagen ﬁbrils or sheets with various prop-
erties. There are at least 13 types of collagen in the
body, which may be found as ﬁbrils, as sheets or in
a variety of other arrangements; this is governed by
the types of chain making up the ﬁbres and the
orientation of the ﬁbres in relation to each other.
Collagen synthesis occurs from the production
of procollagen chains, with large additional amino
acid sequences at both their N and C termini.
These regions allow chain alignment and promote
the proper folding of the chains into a collagen
ﬁbre. In the extracellular space, the N and C
termini are removed and collagen is linked into
another collagen ﬁbril by covalent association.
Hyaluronan and proteoglycans
Proteoglycans – large molecules made up of pro-
tein and carbohydrates – are found in all extracel-
lular matrices. A key component is hyaluronan.
Hyaluronan
Hyaluronan is made up of repeating subunits of
the disaccharide gluronic acid-b–N-acetylglucosa-
mine-b. An individual molecule may have over
50 000 repeats within it, and the whole molecule
folds into a coiled structure about 500 nm in di-
ameter. The constituent subunits of hyaluronan
are negatively charged, which allows the repulsive
forces between the subunits to produce regions
that are rigid, within the coiled structure.
Hyaluronan can provide stiffness to the extra-
cellular matrix and yet act as a lubricant in other
areas, such as joints. This is aided by the hydro-
philic nature of the molecules, which allows them
to bind large amounts of water to produce a hy-
drated gel. Hyaluronan can be bound by the cell
surface receptor CD44, aiding the migration of
cells in the extracellular matrix.
Proteoglycans
Proteoglycans consist of a central protein core to
which large numbers of glycosaminoglycans are
attached. Similar to hyaluronan, they may contrib-
ute to the nature of the extracellular matrix. Of
particular importance is the molecule aggrecan,
which is found in cartilage. This proteoglycan
associates with hyaluronan to generate an enor-
mous macromolecule that is responsible for the
weight-bearing and gel-like nature of cartilage.
Some forms of proteoglycans – particularly those
found in the basement membranes of epithelia –
may be attached to cells, anchoring them into
place in the matrix. Proteoglycans can also bind
many signalling molecules (e.g. cytokines and
60

growth factors), which retain them in the area
where they were secrete, maintaining and prolong-
ing their effect.
DEFINITION Glycosaminoglycans
Glycosaminoglycansarelongunbranchedpolysac-
charidesthataremadeupofrepeatingdisaccharide
units. Typically one sugar is either D-glucosamine or
D-galactosamine, where the amino group has been
acetylated, eliminating the positive charge of the
molecule.
The negative charge in the molecule ensures that
it efﬁciently recruits large amounts of water as well
as ensuring that neighbouring glycosaminoglycan
molecules are repulsive, to allow them to move past
each other with ease.

Physiology
The function of the human body depends on ions,
most importantly sodium (Naþ), potassium (K þ)
and calcium (Ca2 þ). In particular, the asymmet-
rical distribution of Naþ and K þ is responsible for
the electrical excitability of cells, which allows
transmission of nervous signals. Ca2 þ is a crucial
intracellular messenger that regulates many pro-
cesses including release of chemical mediators at
synapses and muscular contraction.
Membrane potential
The membrane potential is the voltage (electrical
potential) difference across the cell membrane. In
most cells, the interior of the cell is negative with
respect to its exterior. Cells have different mem-
brane potentials; the typical resting membrane
potential of a neuron is 70 mV.
Ion distribution across
a membrane
Three ions, Naþ, K þ and Cl , are the main
species that generate the membrane potential.
Ca2 þ has no role in the formation of the mem-
brane potential, although it is a crucial second
messenger, controlling many cellular processes.
In each case, the function of the ion is aided by
an electrochemical gradient that exists across
the cell membrane.
Generation and maintenance
of the resting potential
These processes are closely related and the relative
contributions of different mechanisms are dis-
cussed below:
. The resting potential may be gradually dis-
charged due to the small ﬂow of ions across the
membrane. To prevent this, the gradient must be
maintained by the further active transport of
ions.
. Following an action potential, the distribution of
ions across the membrane differs considerably
from their resting potential; the electrochemical
gradients of Naþ and K þ must be re-established
through active transport.

DEFINITION Active transport
Active transport can move molecules against their
natural diffusion gradient, so it requires energy.
It is mediated by transport proteins in the cell
membrane:
. Primary active transport is powered by energy
derived directly from the hydrolysis of ATP.
. Secondary active transport is not powered di-
rectly by ATP and so is not really active. It uses
energy stored in the electrochemical gradient
of another molecule created by primary active
transport.
DEFINITION Electrochemical gradient
The electrochemical gradient for any ion de-
scribes the combined energy stored as a result
of the difference in both ionic concentrations
and electrical potentials. The electrochemical
gradient is released to power important cellular
functions.
The electrical and ionic concentration gradi-
ents can be in either the same or opposing
directions. If the electrical and concentration
gradients are opposite and balance each other,
there will be no net movement of ions across the
cell membrane (i.e. the movement of ions in one
direction balances the movement of ions in
the opposite direction). The ion is said to be in
electrochemical equilibrium.
Ionic basis of the membrane
potential
Three mechanisms contribute to the resting mem-
brane potential:
1 Passive ionic diffusion
2 Active ionic transport
3 The Gibbs–Donnan equilibrium.
Passive ionic diffusion
Passive ion movements contribute most of the
effect of the membrane potential. Charged ions
can cross the membrane passively via protein
channels embedded in the lipid bilayer. The
passive diffusion of an ion (e.g. Naþ) across the
membrane via a protein channel is determined by
two factors:
1 The electrochemical gradient
2 The permeability of the membrane to the ion,
resultingfromthenumberofchannels thatallow
the ion to ﬂow through.
The principles of ion movement can be applied to
demonstrate how passive ionic diffusion can gen-
erate a membrane potential. Consider an idea-
lised cell that contains a high concentration of
non-diffusible negatively charged proteins and
that is permeable only to K þ ions, so that there
is a high concentration of K þ inside the cell
(140 mmol/L) and a low concentration of K þ
outside (4 mmol/L). The concentration gradient
of K þ from the inside to the outside of the cell will
tend to drive K þ ions out of the cell before they
can completely neutralise the negative charges on
the proteins. This creates a negative membrane
potential – the inside of the cell is negatively
charged whereas the outside is positively charged.
The K þ ions will eventually reach electrochemical
equilibrium as described above. The equilibrium
potential can be modelled by the Nernst equa-
tion (see below).
Only a few ions need to cross the cell membrane
to maintain an electrical potential, e.g. to change
the membrane potential of a cell by 100 mV, about
0.001% of the total number of K þ ions inside the
cell will cross the membrane.
Active ionic transport
Na þ/K þATPase pumps three Naþ ions out of a cell
for every two K þ ions that it transports. This results
in the net movement of a single positive charge,
which directly contributes to the generation of the
resting membrane potential. Naþ/K þ ATPase is
electrogenic because it directly moves charge
through its action. However, in the short term, this
direct contribution is small – if the activity of Naþ/
K þ ATPase is stopped, the membrane potential
drops by around 10 mV. Naþ/K þ ATPase also con-
tributes indirectly by establishing and maintain-
ing ion gradients across the cell membrane.
The Gibbs–Donnan equilibrium
The Gibbs–Donnan equilibrium describes the con-
tribution of impermeant (those that cannot cross
the membrane) cellular anions, such as proteins, to
Physiology 63

the resting membrane potential. The cytoplasm of
most cells contains many impermeant anions that
contribute around  10 mV to the resting mem-
brane potential.
The Nernst equation
The Nernst equation can be used to calculate the
equilibrium potential:
EX ¼ RT
zF ln ½Xi
½Xo
where Ex is the equilibrium potential for the ion
‘x’, R and F are constants (gas and Faraday’s con-
stants, respectively), T is the absolute tempe-
rature in kelvins (K), z is the charge of the ion
(e.g. þ 1 for Naþ, þ 2 for Ca2 þ and  1 for Cl ),
ln is logarithm to the base e – the natural logarithm,
[X]i is the intracellular concentration of the ion,
and
[X]o is the extracellular concentration of
the ion.
If the logarithm to the base e is converted to
logarithm to the base 10, and it is assumed that the
temperature is 37.5C and the ion has a single
positive charge (e.g. Naþ), the Nernst equation
can be simpliﬁed to:
Ex ¼  61:5 mV log10
½Xi
½Xo
If the intracellular and extracellular concentra-
tions of K þ are 140 mmol/L and 4 mmol/L respec-
tively, as was the case in the idealised cell described
above, permeable only to K þ ions, the equilibrium
potential is:
Ex ¼  61:5 mV log10
½140i
½4o
¼  95 mV
:
If the intracellular and extracellular concentra-
tions are varied, the equilibrium potential will be
different.
Naþ, K þ and Cl  all contribute to the mem-
brane potential in real cells, generating a mem-
brane potential determined by not only the
equilibrium potential of each ion, but also the
relative permeability of the ions. The more perme-
able the membrane to an ion, the greater its
ﬂow across the membrane, and the greater its
contribution to the membrane potential. When
considering multiple ions, the membrane poten-
tial (Em) can be determined by:
Em ¼ PK þ
Ptot
EK þ þ PNa þ
Ptot
ENa þ þ PCl 
Ptot
ECl 
where Ex is the equilibrium potential of that ion, Px
the relative permeability of that ion and Ptot the
total permeability, which is the sum of the relative
permeabilities.
The permeability of a cell membrane to an ion is
determined mainly by the availability of ion chan-
nels through which a particular ion can pass:
membranes tend to be most permeable to K þions
because cell membranes contain many protein
channels known as K þleak channels. As a result,
the typical membrane potential of  70 mV lies
close to the equilibrium potential of K þ.
Action potentials
An action potential is a rapid depolarisation of the
cell membrane potential which travels along the
length of the cell without decrease in magnitude. It
occurs in excitable cells, where rapid transmission
of a signal is essential; it is caused by the opening of
voltage-gated channels which change membrane
conductance and therefore alter the membrane
potential (Fig. 4.1a). Action potentials are an all-
or-nothing response, triggered once a threshold
level of depolarisation has been reached.
DEFINITION Membrane conductance
Membrane conductance is a measure of how easily
ions are able to cross the cell membrane and is
altered by the opening of membrane channels.
Mechanism of the action potential
Action potentials can be divided into four phases
(Fig. 4.1):
1 Initiation: a stimulus that changes membrane
permeability causing a depolarisation which
reaches threshold.
2 Upstroke: arapid increase in membrane poten-
tial to a peak of about þ 40 mV.
64
Physiology

3 Repolarisation: a decay in the membrane po-
tential. After hyperpolarisation – a transient
undershoot occurs, in which the membrane
potential falls below the resting membrane
potential before returning to it.

Figure 4.1 (a) Membrane potential changes during the action potential of a typical neuron. The cell is
depolarised to threshold and then ﬁres an action potential. A maximum potential of around þ 50 mV is reached
before the neuron repolarises. The absolute and relative refractory periods are shown. During the absolute
refractory period the neuron is unable to ﬁre another action potential as voltage-gated channels are inactivated,
although, during the relative refractory period, a larger than usual stimulus is required to generate an action
potential. (b) Changes in membrane conductance associated with the action potential of a typical neuron.
There is a rapid increase in Na þ conductance associated with opening of voltage-gated Na þ channels, which
corresponds to depolarisation. This is followed by a slower and smaller increase in K þ conductance caused by
opening of voltage-gated K þ channels and a decrease in Na þ conductance as Na þ channels inactivate. These
changes correspond with the repolarisation of the neuron.
Physiology 65

DEFINITION Depolarising and
hyperpolarising currents
A depolarising current causes the membrane po-
tential to become more positive, e.g. from  55 mV
to  40 mV.
A hyperpolarising current causes the mem-
brane potential to become more negative, e.g. from
 55 mV to  60 mV.
Initiation of the action potential
Action potentials are initiated by a localised
depolarisation of the cell membrane as a result
of the opening of cation channels, leading to an
increased ﬂow of cations into the cell. In a
neuron, this change usually results from the
binding
of
a
transmitter
to
a
ligand-gated
ion channel although other stimuli, such as
heat and pressure, can also alter membrane
permeability.
An action potential will occur if the membrane is
depolarised to a threshold value. Those currents
that do not reach the threshold value will not cause
an action potential and are deﬁned as local circuit
currents; they rapidly decrease as they spread
along the length of the cell.
DEFINITION Threshold value
The threshold value is the value to which the
membrane potential of a cell must be depolarised
to cause an action potential through opening of
voltage-gated channels.
Upstroke of the action potential
When the membrane is depolarised to its threshold
potential it triggers the opening of voltage-gated
Na þchannels, greatly elevating the conductance
of the membrane to Naþ. As more and more
Naþ channels open, Naþ ions move into the cell
down their electrochemical gradient and the mem-
brane potential rapidly heads towards the equilib-
rium potential of Naþ, which is about þ 65 mV.
The peak of the upstroke of the action potential is
usually around þ 40 mV.
Voltage-gated ion channels
These channels are sensitive to membrane poten-
tial and can exist in one of three states:
1 Closed: there is no movement of ions but the
channel will open if stimulated.
2 Open: ions can freely pass into or out of the cell.
3 Inactivated: after channel opening, voltage-
gated channels become inactivated. In this state
the channel does not allow the ﬂow of ions, and
cannot be opened again until the cell membrane
repolarises, allowing the channel to return to its
closed state.
CLINICAL Local anaesthetics
Local anaesthetics (e.g. lidocaine) bind to the
open voltage-gated Naþ channels and, while allow-
ing them to become inactivated, prevent them
returning to a ‘closed’ state. As a result, local anaes-
thetics prevent voltage-gated Naþ channels from
reopening
and
stimulating
subsequent
action
potentials.
Repolarisation
During repolarisation the membrane potential re-
turns towards its resting value through two
processes:
1 The inactivation of voltage-gated Naþ channels
2 The opening of voltage-gated K þ channels.
As the membrane potential becomes more
positive, voltage-gated Naþ
channels become
inactivated
and
conductance
of
Naþ
ions
decreases.
Membrane
depolarisation
to
the
threshold also affects voltage-gated K þ channels,
increasing the probability that these channels will
be open. The activation of these K þ channels is
much slower than that for voltage-gated Naþ chan-
nels, occurring at around the same time as the Naþ
channels become inactivated (see Fig. 4.1b). For
this reason, they are known as delayed-rectiﬁer
channels; they cause an outward ﬂow of K þ ions
which, together with inactivation of the voltage-
gated Naþ channels, quickly drives the membrane
potential towards the equilibrium potential for K þ.
This is usually slightly more negative than the
membrane resting potential, resulting in the phase
know as after hyperpolarisation.
66
Physiology

After hyperpolarisation
There is usually a hyperpolarising after-potential,
in which the membrane potential is lower than the
usual resting membrane potential due to the ele-
vated permeability to K þ ions. As the delayed
rectiﬁer channels close, the membrane potential
returns to its resting value.
Refractory period
During the refractory period the resting ionic gra-
dients are re-established, restoring the excitability
of the cell. This can be divided into two important
periods:
1 The absolute refractory period: no further ac-
tion potential can be elicited because the chan-
nels are inactivated.
2 The relative refractory period: a stronger than
usual stimulus is required to elicit an action
potential because many channels are still in an
inactivated state. A greater proportion of the
closed channels must therefore be stimulated
to cause sufﬁcient depolarisation.
Conduction of the action
potential
There are two forms in which a depolarisation can
be propagated along an axon:
1 Local circuit currents are the result of a mem-
brane of a depolarised region drawing the charge
from neighbouring regions. As this process does
not require channel opening, local circuit cur-
rents move extremely rapidly along the cell
membrane; however, as there is no movement
of ions across the cell membrane, these currents
rapidly diminish.
2 Action potentials are propagated along the
axons of neurons through opening of volt-
age-gated channels, which reinforces the de-
polarisation of the cell membrane. As the
channels must open, the speed of conduction
is less rapid than for local circuit currents, but
action potentials are capable of travelling along
the length of an axon.
The speed of conduction increases as the cross-
sectional area of the axon increases due to a
decreased internal resistance; however, to achieve
the conduction velocities required by this means
alone, nerves cells would have to be exceedingly
large.
In humans, most neurons are myelinated
which increases the speed of conduction. The
myelination of neurons is achieved by different
cells in the peripheral and central nervous systems
(CNS):
. Schwann cells myelinate peripheral nervous sys-
tem neurons. These wrap tightly around a single
axon.
. Oligodendrocytes
myelinate
CNS
neurons.
These cells myelinate several different axons
because they project processes that wrap around
the neuron to generate a myelin sheath.
DEFINITION Myelin
Myelin is a phospholipid layer produced within
Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes; it plays an
important role in insulating neurons because the
cells wrap their cell membrane (containing myelin)
around the neurons.
Myelin insulates the neuron and increases mem-
brane resistance. This causes conduction along
myelinated areas of the membrane by (faster) local
currents. At regular intervals in a myelinated neu-
ron, there are gaps in the myelin sheath known as
nodes of Ranvier. Only action potentials that ex-
press a high density of voltage-gated Naþ channels
can occur at the nodes of Ranvier. Local circuit
currents are set up between adjacent nodes of
Ranvier so action potentials ‘jump’ rapidly be-
tween nodes, missing out whole sections of the
axon. This is called saltatory conduction. In this
way, a long nerve ﬁbre can conduct an action
potential very rapidly.
CLINICAL Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a CNS disease in which
there is gradual loss of the myelin sheath surround-
ing neurons, affecting nerve conduction. This
causes the characteristic symptoms of blurred vi-
sion, limb numbness and vertigo. MS is thought to
be caused by an autoimmune response to myelin
proteins.
Physiology 67

Synapses
A synapse is the junction between a neuron and
its target cell, over which a signal can be trans-
mitted. Synapses typically occur between two or
more neurons, or between a neuron and a muscle
cell. However, there can be synapses between
other cell types. There are two important types of
synapse:
1 Electrical synapses: the action potential passes
directly between the two cells via gap junctions.
2 Chemical synapses: the signal is transmitted
between cells by a neurotransmitter.
Electrical synapses
The transmission at electrical synapses is rapid
and can be bidirectional. Electrical synapses
can be seen in the heart where gap junctions
are found between neighbouring cardiac mus-
cles and for which the rapid spread of current is
important in coordinating contractions. Electri-
cal synapses do not allow for integration of
signals in the same way as chemical synapses.
They are predominantly found in smooth and
cardiac muscles to aid coordinated contraction
of the tissues.
DEFINITION Gap junctions
Gap junctions provide a direct physical connection
between two cells, permitting passage of small
molecules, such as ions and water. A gap junction
is made up of two connexons, one from each
connecting cell. Each connexon is formed from six
protein subunits known as connexins. A complete
gap junction made up of two connexons contains
12 connexins.
Chemical synapses
Chemical synapses allow communication be-
tween cells by the release of neurotransmitters
across the synapse. The arrival of an electrical
signal at the nerve terminal causes release of a
neurotransmitter from transmitting cells, which
diffuses across the synapse to the receiving
cells; there it binds to receptors, altering the
membrane permeability, and thus the mem-
brane potential. The nerve terminals of neurons
are typically unmyelinated and contain neuro-
transmitters within vesicles at the nerve termi-
nal (Fig. 4.2).
DEFINITION Neurotransmitter
A neurotransmitter is a chemical released in re-
sponse to the depolarisation of a nerve terminal,
which diffuses across a synapse. The neurotrans-
mitter binds to receptors on the postsynaptic cell
membrane, triggering an inhibitory or excitatory
response.
In contrast to electrical synapses, chemical
transmission is less rapid and unidirectional – at
a synapse most synaptic membranes will only be
able either to release neurotransmitters or to
express the receptors that allow a response, not
both (though the pre-synaptic membrane, which
releases the neurotransmitter, may express some
receptors related to the regulation of further neu-
rotransmitter release). However, chemical synap-
ses allow the integration of many inputs into a
single target neuron, which is crucial for proces-
sing of signals. Chemical synapses can also be
modulated presynaptically, altering its behaviour
in future action potentials.
Neuromuscular junction
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialised
chemical synapse between a motor neuron and a
skeletal muscle ﬁbre. It is one of the best-under-
stood synapses.
Anatomy of the NMJ
Although each skeletal muscle ﬁbre is innervat-
ed by only one neuron, each neuron may
branch and innervate many skeletal muscle
ﬁbres (the motor unit). The ﬁne demyelinated-
terminal branches that innervate individual
skeletal muscle ﬁbres release acetylcholine at
the NMJ. The space between the motor neuron
and the skeletal muscle cell is known as the
junctional cleft. The membrane of the postsyn-
aptic skeletal muscle cell is highly folded into
junctional folds.
68
Physiology

Physiology of the NMJ
The neurotransmitter at the NMJ is acetylcholine.
There are several important steps involved in
transmission at the NMJ (Fig. 4.3, overleaf):
. Synthesis of acetylcholine
. Release of acetylcholine from the nerve ending
. Receptor activation and depolarisation of the
muscleﬁbreafterbindingoftheneurotransmitter
. Deactivation of acetylcholine.
Synthesis of acetylcholine
Acetylcholine (Ach) is synthesised and stored in
the
nerve
ending.
The
enzyme
choline-O-
acetyltransferase catalyses its formation from
choline and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA):
. Acetyl-CoA is synthesised within the nerve
ending.
. Choline cannot be synthesised by the neuron
and is actively transported into the neuron.
Release of acetylcholine
The arrival of an action potential at a nerve ending
triggers the opening of L-type voltage-gated Ca2 þ
channels, resulting in an inﬂow of Ca2 þ ions.
Increased intracellular Ca2 þ triggers the release
of ACh into the synapse by exocytosis, where it
diffuses into the muscle cell.

receptors are either ligand gated or G-protein coupled and alter membrane conductance. This results in either an
excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). An EPSP is when the
change in membrane conductance causes the cell to depolarise, whereas an IPSP is when the change in membrane
conductance causes the cell to hyperpolarise. The action of the neurotransmitter is terminated by reuptake into
the presynaptic axon, diffusion away from the synaptic cleft or enzymatic breakdown by a speciﬁc enzyme.

into the neuron, down its electrochemical gradient. (3) Acetylcholine (ACh) is released into the junctional cleft by
exocytosis in response to a rise in Ca2 þ. (4) ACh diffuses across the junctional and binds to nicotinic ACh receptors
found on the postsynaptic membrane of the skeletal muscle ﬁbre. These are known as ligand-gated ion channels,
because the bindingofthe ligandwillcausethe channel toopen. The bindingofACh directlycausesthe openingofan
ion channel. (5) The skeletal muscle ﬁbre is depolarised. The depolarisation spreads to the surround cell membrane,
which expressesvoltage-gated Naþ channels, triggeringanactionpotential (6)thattravelsalong the skeletalmuscle
ﬁbre. ACh is broken down to form choline and acetate by acetylcholinesterase and the products recycled.
CLINICAL Botulinum toxin
Botulinum toxin is a poisonous bacterial exotoxin
that prevents the release of ACh from the nerve
ending and causes severe motor and parasympa-
thetic paralysis.
Receptor activation and
depolarisation
Acetylcholine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors on the muscle ﬁbres. These are ligand-
gated cation channels which open in response to
binding of ACh. The membrane conductance to
both Naþ and K þ is increased and the skeletal
muscle ﬁbre is depolarised; this is known as an
end-plate potential (EPP). An action potential
cannot occur at the NMJ itself, because it does not
express voltage-gated Naþ channels. Instead, the
positive charge spreads by local circuit currents to
the membrane surrounding the NMJ, where volt-
age-gated Naþ channels are expressed, allowing
initiation of an action potential. The action of ACh
is terminated by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase
which hydrolyses ACh to form choline and acetate.
The components of the breakdown are reabsorbed
by the synapse cells, and recycled to produce more
neurotransmitter.
70
Physiology

Pharmacology of the NMJ
There are two ways of blocking the NMJ:
1 A depolarising blocking agent (e.g. suxametho-
nium) activates the nicotinic ACh receptor to
cause sustained depolarisation of the end-plate
region. After an initial action potential, the
membrane is unable to repolarise, preventing
triggering of subsequent action potentials; the
voltage-gatedchannelsinthemusclecellremain
inactivated. Depolarising blocking agents may
be metabolised by acetylcholinesterase present
at the NMJ.
2 A non-depolarising blocking agent (e.g. atra-
curium) is a competitive antagonist at the NMJ
and so prevents the binding of ACh to its
receptors.
There are two important differences between
using a non-depolarising and a depolarising
blocking agent:
1 Depolarising blocking agents cause transient
fasciculations (muscle twitches) when used,
which is not seen with non-depolarising agents.
2 Inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, such as eser-
ine, are effective at reversing non-depolarising
blockingagents,whereasdepolarisingagentsare
unaffected by these drugs.
CLINICAL Myasthenia gravis
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease
characterised by generalised muscle weakness. It
is caused by antibodies that destroy the ACh re-
ceptors at the NMJ. Treatment is by anticholines-
terases, which prevent the breakdown of ACh, so
increasing the effective ACh concentration which
helps transmission, counteracting the decreased
number of receptors at the NMJ.
Skeletal muscle
Three important types of muscle – skeletal,
smooth and cardiac – can be distinguished ac-
cording to their properties and organisation, al-
though the basic contractile mechanism is similar
in each type of muscle. Both skeletal and cardiac
muscles are classiﬁed as striated muscle, whereas
smooth muscle is classiﬁed as non-striated.
DEFINITION Striated and non-striated
muscle
Striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac muscle) con-
tains ﬁlaments that have an alternating light and
dark appearance when viewed under a micro-
scope,and are saidto havea characteristic ‘striated
pattern’. This is due to the orderly organisation of the
contractile elements within the cells. In contrast,
there is no regular arrangement of the contractile
elements in smooth muscle and these striations are
not visible.
Skeletal muscle is generally attached to the bones
of the skeleton, where it maintains posture and
initiates movement. It is also found in the oesoph-
agus, where it is involved in the voluntary phase of
swallowing, and in the anal and urethral sphincters.
Structure of skeletal muscle
Skeletal muscle is made up of muscle ﬁbres, re-
sponsible for contraction and the protective cov-
ering. There are also various sensory structures to
provide feedback on the state of the muscle; these
are discussed in Chapter 17.
The connective tissue that protects the muscle’s
contractile elements comprises:
. The epimysium: a layer of connective tissue that
surrounds skeletal muscle
. The perimysium: another layer of connective
tissue that surrounds bundles (fascicles) of skel-
etal muscle ﬁbres or myoﬁbres
. The endomysium: a layer of connective tissue
that surrounds individual myoﬁbres bundled
within the fascicles.
Ultrastructure of myoﬁbres
Myoﬁbres are multinucleate cells formed during
embryonic development from the fusion of many
earlycellsknownasmyoblasts.Inmyoﬁbres,thecell
cytoplasmiscalledthemyoplasmandthecellmem-
braneiscalledthesarcolemma.Deepinvaginations
in the sarcolemma, called T-tubules, are closely
associated to sac-like structures known as the sar-
coplasmicreticulum(anadaptedformofendoplas-
micreticulum),whichcontainastoreofcalciumions
that are released to initiate muscular contraction.
Each myoﬁbre contains many myoﬁbrils, which
are bundles of protein ﬁlaments or myoﬁlaments
Physiology 71

arranged in parallel along the length of the cell,
giving the cell a striated appearance. The ﬁlaments
bundled within the myoﬁbrils are known as
myoﬁlaments
and
these
are
the
contractile
elements of the cell.
Myoﬁlaments
There are two types of myoﬁlament in the sarco-
meres – thick and thin ﬁlaments:
1 The thin ﬁlaments are composed primarily of
actin, but also contain troponin and tropo-
myosin. Troponin is a regulatory molecule that
binds actin, tropomyosin and Ca2 þ ions. Tropo-
myosinregulatesthebindingofactinandmyosin.
2 The thick ﬁlaments are made of myosin mole-
cules. Each myosin molecule consists of two
head regions and a tail region. In a chain of
myosin molecules, the tail regions are bundled
together, leaving the head regions free to bind
actin.
The myoﬁlaments are divided into functional units
known as sarcomeres (Fig. 4.4) which are distinct
contractile units organised in a speciﬁc way:
. The Z-line is the site where the thin ﬁlaments
attach to the edge of the sarcomere.
. The I band is the region to which the thin ﬁla-
ments do not extend, appearing light under a
microscope.
. The M-line is found in the centre of the sarco-
mere and is the site of attachment of the myosin-
containing thick ﬁlaments, which do not extend
to the very edge of the sarcomere.
. The A band is where the thin and thick ﬁlaments
overlap, appearing as a dense region under a
microscope.
When there is a muscular contraction, the I band
shortensasthethinﬁlamentsare drawntogether by
the contractile myosin in the thick ﬁlaments. As a
result, the overlapping A band will become thicker.
Mechanism of contraction
The molecular mechanism of contraction is similar
in all three types of muscle. In order to contract,
muscles require ATP, as a source of energy, and
Ca2 þ, as a link between excitation and contraction.
Excitation–contraction coupling
Excitation–contraction coupling links the action
potential with muscular contraction through the
release of Ca2 þ. The chain of events is as follows:
1 The action potential travels down the motor
neuron to the NMJ.
2 ACh is secreted into the neuromuscular cleft and
binds to nicotinic receptors on the postsynaptic
membrane, causing an end-plate potential in
the myoﬁbre through inﬂux of Naþ.
3 Local depolarisation spreads down the myoﬁbre
and triggers an action potential, which is prop-
agated along the length of the myoﬁbre.
4 The action potential spreads down the T-
tubules, spreading the action potential to the
interior parts of the cells.
5 Depolarisation of the T-tubules allows Ca2 þ to
be released from the closely associated sarco-
plasmic reticulum (SR) through ryanodine
receptors (RyRs) which are Ca2 þ channels an-
atomically coupled to the T-tubular system. The
activation of Ca2 þ channels in the membrane
triggers the release of further Ca2 þ ions from
intracellular SR.
6 Ca2 þ ﬂows into the myoplasm down the elec-
trochemical gradient. Troponin C, a domain of
troponin, then binds four ions of Ca2 þ; this
causes conformational changes in several com-
ponents in tropomyosin, exposing binding sites
are and allowing myosin and actin to interact to
form cross-bridges (links between myosin and
actin) and allow cross-bridge cycling.
7 The muscle relaxes when Ca2 þ is pumped back
into the SR by Ca2 þ ATPase. Intracellular calci-
um levels are lowered, so that actin and myosin
can no longer interact.

Physiology

DEFINITION Troponin
Troponin is a protein made up of three subunits:
troponin C, I and T. Troponin C is capable of binding
four Ca2 þ ions, troponin I binds to actin and tropo-
nin T binds to tropomyosin. The latter two are both
involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle
contraction.
Cross-bridge cycling
The sliding-ﬁlament theory describes the molec-
ular basis of contraction. During contraction, actin
(thin ﬁlaments) slides across the myosin (thick
ﬁlaments), which remains stationary, shortening
the overall length of the myoﬁbre. The movement
of actin across myosin is generated by cross-bridge
cycling. Myosin and actin can interact only with
each other when intracellular Ca2 þ is raised. The
chain of events during cross-bridge cycling is re-
presented in Fig. 4.5.
CLINICAL Rigor mortis
Rigor mortis is muscle rigidity after death; it is
caused by the failure of myosin to dissociate from
actin because there is no ATP. The ﬁlaments are
joined for up to 72 hours after death, after which the
proteins begin to degrade.
Force of contraction
It is important that the amount of force generated
by a muscle can be varied. The force of contraction
can be varied both physiologically and mechani-
cally. It can be altered physiologically in two ways:
1 The number of motor units recruited can be
varied:themoremotorunitsrecruited,thegreat-
er the force generated.
2 The frequency of stimulation can be changed. A
single stimulus causes a twitch tension. A train
of stimuli allows summation of tension, increas-
ing the contractile force – there is a progressive
increase in cytoplasmic Ca2 þ because there is
insufﬁcient time to remove all the Ca2 þ released
in response to the previous stimulus. If the train
of stimuli is at a high enough frequency, they
may cause a fused tetanus, which is a prolonged
contraction. There is no decline in calcium levels
during a fused tetanus, allowing cross-bridge
cycling to generate a maximal force.
There are three mechanical factors that inﬂuence
the force generated by a muscle.
1 There is an optimal resting muscle length at
which the maximum number of cross-bridges
can be formed, so that the most force is

generated by cross-bridge cycling. If a muscle is
stretched, there will be less overlap between
actin and myosin ﬁlaments; consequently fewer
cross-bridges will form during contraction, re-
ducing the force generated.
2 The shortening velocity will affect the force
generated: the faster the velocity, the greater the
force. The shortening velocity is dependent on:
(a) the type of muscle ﬁbre
(b) the load against which it is acting: the heavier
the load, the smaller the shortening velocity.
A muscle may contract but not shorten at all –
this is isometric contraction which is differ-
ent to isotonic contraction, in which there is
shortening against a constant load.
3 A myoﬁbre with a larger cross-sectional area
will contain many myoﬁbrils, so there will be a
larger number of myoﬁlaments contributing to
contraction. Training increases the cross-sec-
tional area of myoﬁbres rather than the number.
Cardiac muscle
Cardiac muscle generates contractile force in the
heart. It shares many features of both smooth and
skeletal muscle but there are also important differ-
ences: cardiac muscle is myogenic – contraction
arises in the muscle itself and not from a motor
neuron, unlike skeletal muscle.
The link between excitation and contraction in
cardiac muscle again relies on Ca2 þ. However, in
cardiac muscle the source of Ca2 þ is different.
During the cardiac action potential, Ca2 þ enters
the cell via specialised calcium channels. This
triggers the release of more Ca2 þ from intracellular
stores, a process known as calcium-induced
calcium release. In a similar way to skeletal mus-
cle, intracellular Ca2 þ changes are able to regulate
cellular contraction although the cardiac troponin
molecule has only three Ca2 þ ions.
CLINICAL Calcium channel blockers in
the treatment of hypertension
Antagonists of voltage-gated calcium channels,
such as amlodipine, can be used in the treatment
of hypertension because they reduce tone in the
smooth muscle present in blood vessel walls.
Smooth muscle
Smooth muscle is non-striated and found in the
walls of blood vessels and the lining of hollow
organs; it is adapted to contract tonically for sus-
tained periods of time. The degree of contraction
that smooth muscle achieves is greater than both
cardiac and skeletal muscle. Smooth muscle does
not always require an action potential to contract
and can be generally classiﬁed as two types:
1 Neurogenic smooth muscle which shows no
spontaneous electrical or mechanical activity. It
isinnervatedandcontractsonlyafterstimulation.
2 Myogenic smooth muscle shows spontaneous
mechanical activity, although its activity can
be
modulated
by
the
innervation
that
it
receives.
Structure of smooth muscle
Smooth muscle tissue consists of sheets of
smooth muscle cells that are adapted for tonic
contraction. They can contract to a much shorter
length but the speed of contraction is much less
important. Smooth muscle cells have character-
istic features:
. They are small, spindle-shaped cells 4–8 mm in
diameter and 80–200 mm long, with a single
nucleus. Smooth muscle cells do not possess any
T-tubules and have a much smaller SR.
. There are no cross-striations because the thick
and thin ﬁlaments are not arranged in an orderly
way. Thin ﬁlaments insert into dense bodies
rather than a Z-line. There is a much higher ratio
of actin:myosin ﬁlaments which allows a greater
degree of contraction.
. Gap junctions allow coordinated contraction of
muscle cells by linking depolarisation.
. Dense bands allow mechanical coupling be-
tween the cells.
Coupling in smooth muscle
There are two forms of coupling in smooth
muscle:
. Excitation–contraction coupling where con-
traction of smooth muscle follows membrane
depolarisation. Depolarisation of the cell acti-
vates voltage-gated Ca2 þ channels. Increased
Ca2 þ subsequently activates myosin light chain
kinase (MLCK).
. Pharmomechanical coupling where contrac-
tion is linked to the binding of a molecule to a
cellular receptor; this can either be through the
direct activation of ligand-gated Ca2 þ channels
or via a second messenger system that triggers
Ca2 þ release, such as the Gq protein.

Mechanism of contraction
The basic molecular mechanism of contraction
in
smooth
muscle
is
similar
to
that
in
skeletal muscle, although the sequence of events
that
triggers
the
cross-bridge
cycle
differs
markedly. The following steps lead to contrac-
tion (Fig. 4.6):
1 There is a rise in intracellular Ca þ caused by
either inﬂux from the extracellular ﬂuid (ECF) or
release from internal stores.
2 Ca2 þ binds to a protein known as calmodulin
which can then activate MLCK.
3 MLCK phosphorylates myosin light chains al-
lowing interaction between myosin and actin;
this leads to contraction through cross-bridge
cycling.
4 Contractionisterminatedbydephosphorylation
of myosin by myosin light chain phosphatase.
However, smooth muscle does not necessarily
relax because cells can maintain contraction
without cross-bridge cycling.
DEFINITION Myosin light chain kinase
MLCK phosphorylates myosin light chain allowing
cross-bridge cycling to take place; it is regulated by
Ca2 þ. In this way, it controls the contraction of
smooth muscle and can be compared with the
regulatory role played by troponin in skeletal
muscle.

Pharmacology
Pharmacology refers to the effects of chemicals on
living systems, through their binding to speciﬁc
targets. The chemicals may be endogenous (e.g.
neurotransmitters) or exogenous (e.g. drugs). As
a result pharmacology is applicable to every
pathway in the body and can be exploited in the
treatment of a condition.
Exogenousandendogenousmoleculesmayacton
a variety of targets, usually proteins, to modify their
function. Targets include speciﬁc receptors, en-
zymes, ion channels and carrier proteins. The pre-
cise interactions that occur may vary: in the case of
endogenous molecules, many are substrates for en-
zymes or carrier proteins, whereas others are signal-
ling molecules that bind and activate receptors.
Exogenous drug molecules can mimic or inhibit the
behaviour of endogenous molecules, or may act as
‘false substrates’ to subvert speciﬁc pathways.
Crucial to a drug’s action is the absorption,
distribution, metabolism and excretion of a mol-
ecule, which can alter the amount of active
molecule that reaches its target.
More recently the ﬁeld of pharmacogenetics
has emerged, whereby the drug and therapies
used exploit genetic variation of an individual to
improve the effectiveness of a treatment.
The principles of drug
action:
pharmacodynamics
The binding of a drug
For a drug or endogenous substance to act, it
must bind to its target site on the molecule. The
kinetics of drug binding can be explained by the
law of mass action, whereas the theory behind
how drugs bind is not well understood. Two
main theories have been used to explain this
interaction:
1 The lock-and-key hypothesis suggests that the
molecule and its target are complementary
and ﬁt together, much like a lock and key.
This explains how a drug and its receptor are
speciﬁc, but does not serve to explain the basis
of efﬁcacy.
2 The induced ﬁt hypothesis suggests that a
molecule bears an almost complementary
structure to its target. The interaction between
the two molecules induces conformational
changes that can promote or inhibit the acti-
vation of the target molecule; this gives rise to
the effect that the pharmacological agent has
on its target.
The kinetics of drug binding and
the law of mass action
The law of mass action explains the kinetics of
a drug binding to its target. It can be stated as:
The rate of a chemical reaction is directly
proportional to the effective concentrations
of the reacting molecules.
In this way, the binding between the free drug
molecule and its binding sites can be modelled
using this law, where the binding between the
drug and its receptor is reversible:

N is the number of drug-binding sites; XA

the number of sites binding the drug:
In almost all cases, the number of drug mole-
cules is far greater than the number of receptors,
such that the concentration of free drug is not
greatly changed by those drug molecules that
bind.
DEFINITION Drug potency, afﬁnity and
efﬁcacy
The potency of a drug is its ability to trigger an
effect at a speciﬁc receptor. More potent drugs
require much smaller doses to elicit a given effect.
Potency is determined by a variety of different
factors:
. Afﬁnity: the ability of a molecule to bind to its
receptor. In most cases this binding is non-cova-
lent and transient. The afﬁnity provides an indica-
tion of the proportion of receptors that will be
bound at any one time.
. Efﬁcacy: after binding, a drug must activate its
receptor. The ability of a drug to achieve this is its
efﬁcacy; although some drugs can induce a max-
imal response, having bound only a small propor-
tion of receptors, others are unable to induce
a maximal response even when all the available
receptors are bound because they have a lower
efﬁcacy.
. Potency: the effect of a drug. This is determined
by a combination of its afﬁnity and efﬁcacy, as well
as the number of receptors present on the tissue
and the access of the drug to its target.
Drug–receptor actions
For a drug to be effective it must, after binding,
induce a conformational effect that activates the
receptor molecule. The property is distinct from
the ability to bind to the target.
The effects of drugs can be described using a
log dose–response curve, where the dosage is
plotted (on a log scale) against the response.
The effects of drugs on the activation or inhi-
bition of receptors can be used to describe them
(Fig. 5.1):
. Antagonists bind receptors without activating
them. Antagonists typically have an efﬁcacy of
0 – having bound a receptor they are unable to
activate it.
. Agonists are drugs that activate the receptors to
which they bind.
Antagonists
Most drugs are antagonists – preventing the
activity of their target molecule. There are dif-
ferent forms of antagonists, based on the site
to which they bind and the nature of the
binding:
. Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the
same site as the substrate, without activating
the receptor. The molecules compete with the
agonists for receptor-binding sites, preventing
binding of the natural ligand. This is reﬂected
in the shift to the right of the log dose–
response curve, such that a higher concentra-
tion of agonist is required to generate an
equivalent effect.
. Non-competitive inhibitors act at a different
site on the target molecule to that of the
agonist, and prevent the action of the agonist,
triggering a conformational change in the
active site. The use of a non-competitive an-
tagonist causes a different effect on the log
dose–response curve. The maximal response
is reduced, although the ability of the agonist
to bind the receptor is not affected. Non-
competitive antagonists reduce the number
of receptors available, so a greater proportion
of the remaining receptors must be bound to
induce a maximal response.
. Irreversible inhibitors bind covalently to their
target, effectively removing the molecule perma-
nently as a target.
Pharmacology 77

DEFINITION Pharmacological agents
Two groups of pharmacological molecules can be
determined:
1 Endogenous agents are produced by the body
itself to elicit a change, such as hormones and
neurotransmitters.
2 Exogenous agents originate outside the body
but can exert an inﬂuence on an endogenous
system, by promoting or inhibiting its activation.
Some exogenous agents may act indirectly,
through modulation of the release or metabolism
of an endogenous agent.
CLINICAL Physiological antagonists
Some conditions can be treated by physiological
antagonists, which oppose the symptoms of a
problem, but do not act through the same recep-
tor pathway, e.g. in asthma, a bronchodilator is
administered to counteract the bronchoconstric-
tion
resulting
from
the
various
inﬂammatory
mediators.

Competitive 
The addition of a competitive 
inhibitor results in a rightward shift 
of the response curve, which is 
proportional to the concentration 
of the competitive inhibitor. As the 
name suggests competitive 
inhibitors compete for the same 
sites as the drug, such that a 
higher concentration of the agent 
is required to ensure that 
necessary number of sites are 
occupied to induce a response of 
particular magnitude.
Non-competitive
A non-competitive inhibitor acts on 
a different site of the target 
molecule to that of the normal 
ligand. As a result it effectively 
removes a proportion of the 
receptors from binding their natural 
ligand. The progressive increase in 
the dose can be such that a large 
enough proportion of the receptors 
can be effectively removed, so that 
the natural ligand will not be able 
to elicit a maximal response, at 
any concentration.
Figure 5.1 Drug dose-response under competitive and non-competivite inhibitors. When the response of
a pharmacological agonist is plotted against the log of the dose administered, a characteristic sigmoidal
curve is generated. The dose refers to the amount of agent reaching the receptor, and in a physiological
situation this may be modulated by the agent’s metabolism and the access that it has to its target receptor.
The administration of antagonists alters the properties of the log dose–response curve. Here for varying
doses of drugs competitive and non-competitive inhibitors have very distinct effects on the response at a
given dose. Here, the dose of the inhibitor (arbitrary units) is given next to the appropriate dose-response
curve.

Pharmacology

Agonists
Most endogenous signalling molecules are agonists:
. Full agonists elicit a maximum response from
target cells if given in an appropriate concentra-
tion. This is through a combination of a high
afﬁnity for the target and a high efﬁcacy to
activate the receptors once bound.
. Partial agonists are unable togenerate a maximal
response even if every available receptor is bound;
although they may have a high afﬁnity, they usu-
ally have a low efﬁcacy. Partial agonists can be
used as competitive inhibitors, by preventing the
binding of the natural agonist to sufﬁcient target
receptors to elicit a maximal response.
Targets of drug action
Any molecule in the body is a potential drug
target. Four classes of molecules, which cover the
majority of drug targets, can be identiﬁed:
1 Receptors
2 Ion channels
3 Enzymes
4 Carrier proteins.
Receptors
In the body, signals must be passed between
different tissues and organs by the transmission
of chemical or electrical signals around the body.
Chemical transmission requires the binding of
a transmitter to its target receptor.
Receptors can vary enormously in the response
that they elicit and its time course. Similarly, the
magnitude of the response may range from a brief
depolarisation of a cell to a massive change in the
entire gene expression proﬁle of the cell. Based on
the structure and nature of the downstream effects,
four types of receptor can be distinguished (Fig. 5.2):
1 Ligand-gated ion channels
2 G-protein coupled receptors
3 Enzyme-linked receptors
4 Nuclear receptors.
Ligand-gated ion channels
Ligand-gated ion channels are the fastest-acting
form of receptor. The binding of a ligand triggers
a rapid conformational change in the structure of
the protein, allowing a channel to open through
which ions ﬂow. A key role of such channels is in
the neuromuscular junctions, where depolarisa-
tion of the cell is triggered by the functions of the
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is a cation
channel. Ligand-gated ion channels exhibit a series
of features:
. Rapid response (milliseconds)
. Short-term
effect,
usually
complete
within
seconds, although channels can induce other
elements leading to longer-term effects
. The effects are speciﬁc, typically limited to
individual cells.
G-protein-coupled receptors
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) create a
slower,
although
larger,
response
than
the
ligand-gated ion channels. GPCRs are associated
with trimeric GTP-binding proteins in the cyto-
plasm. The binding of a ligand to its receptor
causes activation and release of the associated
G-protein, which modulates speciﬁc second mes-
senger pathways in the cell.
G-protein structure
G-proteins are made up of three subunits – a, b and
g. When associated with a GPCR, they are typically
in an inactivated state, in which the protein is
associated with a molecule of GDP. Activation of
the G-protein results from the displacement of the
GDP molecule by a molecule of GTP.
The binding of GTP to the G-protein causes it to
dissociate; Ga is released from Gbg. Ga travels
across the membrane and binds to speciﬁc en-
zymes, modulating a second messenger cascade.
The G-protein contains a GTPase that can
hydrolyse GTP to deactivate the G-protein. GDP-
Ga cannot activate second messenger enzymes
and reassociates with a Gbg subunit.
Types of G-protein
Various different G-proteins exist, which associate
with speciﬁc receptors, to modulate speciﬁc
second messenger cascades.
. Gs activates adenylyl cyclase to increase the
levels of cAMP in the cell.
. Gi inhibits adenylyl cyclase to reduce the levels
of cAMP in the cell
. Gq activates the protein kinase C (PKC), result-
ing in an increase in the cytoplasmic concentra-
tion of Ca2 þ.
Pharmacology 79

2nd
messenger
Ligand gated
Ligand-gated ion channels are the most rapidly 
acting class of receptor. The binding of the 
ligand to its binding site triggers a conformation 
shift in the receptor, opening a channel to allow 
the passage of ions into, or out of, the cell down 
their electrochemical gradient. The specificity of 
the ions is determined by the structure of the 
channel.
GPCR
Protein receptors bind a ligand on the extracellular 
side, which triggers the activation of G proteins, 
which are found on the cytoplasmic side. The 
activation triggers the separation of the α subunit 
from the βγ subunits and allows the α subunit to 
activate a variety of second messenger cascades 
or directly act on other proteins within the cell to 
modulate their function.
Tyrosine kinase
The binding of the ligand to the extracellular 
part of the enzyme-linked receptor, and its 
subsequent dimerisation with another receptor, 
allows activation of the downstream pathways. 
Typically this results in the phosphorylation of 
tyrosine kinases, which leads to a signalling 
cascade that alters the activation and transcrip-
tion of genes within the nucleus. Other 
downstream mechanisms may also be 
recruited. Instead of tyrosine kinases, some 
enzyme-linked receptors activate the second 
messenger molecule cGMP.
Steroid
Steroid hormones are lipid soluble and pass 
through the cell membrane to bind directly to their 
receptors in the cytoplasm. The binding of the 
ligand to its receptor triggers its translocation to 
the nucleus, where it can bind to specific DNA 
sequences and modulate the expression of 
genes. In this way steroid receptors can trigger 
huge changes in gene expression within a cell, 
although the induction of a response is relatively 
slow because new proteins must be synthesised 
subsequent to the modulation of transcription.

Pharmacology

Alternative methods of activation
of GPCRs
Although most GPCRs are activated by the binding
of an endogenous ligand, there are two major
exceptions in which other mechanisms trigger the
activation of proteins in this family:
1 Rhodopsin in the retina is activated by light,
causing a change in the conformation of the
pre-bound retinal molecule.
2 The thrombin receptor is activated by throm-
bin, cleaving a proportion of the N-terminus of
the receptor. This cleavage exposes a series of
residues that can bind to and activate the recep-
tor itself, as a ‘tethered agonist’.
Targets of G-proteins
G-proteins, depending on their subtype, can act
to promote or inhibit many different proteins.
There are three main paths through which they
act:
1 Cyclic nucleoside monophosphates
2 Calcium signalling
3 Modulating ion channels.
Enzyme-linked receptors
Enzyme-linked
receptors
develop
enzymatic
activity in their intracellular domain on binding
an appropriate ligand to the receptor’s extra-
cellular domain. The signal transduction of
enzyme-linked receptors typically requires the
receptors to dimerise, after the phosphorylation
of speciﬁc domains. The net result of this
phosphorylation is the activation and translo-
cation of transcription factors to the nucleus.
Many of these factors are associated with reg-
ulating cell growth and the cell cycle. The
following are two particularly common exam-
ples of this system:
1 Tyrosine kinases (e.g. the insulin receptor):
activation of a tyrosine kinase receptor results
in the enzyme catalysing the phosphorylation
of speciﬁc tyrosine residues on target proteins.
In turn, this modulates further enzymes down-
stream of the receptor to induce widespread
cellular effects.
2 Guanylyl
cyclase:
the
second
messenger
cGMP can be produced after the activation of
guanylyl cyclase in the cytosolic domain of
some receptors. The elevated cGMP activates
cGMP-dependent protein kinases to mediate a
variety of different effects through the phos-
phorylation of target proteins. The gaseous
messenger nitric oxide acts by triggering gua-
nylyl cyclase production in the target cell.
Intracellular receptors
Intracellular receptors are typically nuclear fac-
tors that cause long-term changes induced
over the course of hours and days. Due to their
intracellular location these receptors often bind
thyroid and steroid hormones which, being fat
soluble, are capable of diffusing directly into a
cell.
Intracellular receptors all share a similar struc-
ture and, in most cases, are found in the cytosol
until they bind their ligand, upon which they
travel to the nucleus. Typically, nuclear receptors
dimerise before they become active – the dimers
form with either the same receptor or different
factors. Occasionally, receptors are bound to
DNA in an inactive state, maintained by the
presence of an inhibitory complex. The binding
of the ligand triggers the inhibitory complex to
dissociate.
Binding of the ligand recruits activating pro-
teins, to initiate gene transcription. This initial
activation targets a few genes and occurs in the
course of minutes, resulting in the primary re-
sponse. The protein products of the primary
response will, in turn, act on other genes to
produce a larger, secondary response. The pre-
cise nature of the response caused depends on
both:
. Which intracellular receptor has been activated
. The molecules and transcription factors already
expressed in the cell, which can be determined
by both the cell type and other signals that it
receives.
Ion channels
Ions cannot pass across the cell membrane be-
cause of their charged nature. Any transport into,
or out of, the cell is achieved through the ion
channels or carrier proteins. There is a variety of
channels which can be categorised based on:
. their selectivity for an ion species
. the mechanism of gating
. their molecular architecture.
Pharmacology 81

Selectivity
Channels may vary in their selectivity. The nature
of the selectivity is determined by the size and
charge of the pore in the channel. Some channels
are broadly selective for ions (e.g. the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor is selective for cations),
whereas others may be far more restricted to
a single species of ion (e.g. the L-type Ca2 þ
channel):
Gating
The three main forms of ion channels classed by
gating are:
1 Voltage-gated ion channels
2 Ligand-gated ion channels
3 Mechanically gated ion channels.
Voltage-gated channels
Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to
changes in the cell membrane potential (usually
depolarisation), permitting the ﬂow of ions down
their concentration gradient. This is typically seen
in the propagation of an action potential in a cell.
Voltage-gated channels may also have an inacti-
vated state, to ensure membrane repolarisation
before they can reopen.
Ligand-gated ion channels
The binding of a speciﬁc ligand to its target
channel triggers a conformational shift in the
structure of the channel to promote opening.
The ligand that triggers the opening of the
channel typically binds to a site in the extra-
cellular domain of the receptor, and the rapid
opening that occurs is advantageous in synaptic
transmission.
There are some channels where the ligand-
binding site is found in its cytoplasmic portion,
allowing the channel to open in response to
changes in the cell’s internal condition (e.g. the
ATP-sensitive K þ channels in b cells).
Although ligand-gated ion channels are typi-
cally found on the cell membrane, they can be
found at other locations in the cell. In particular,
the endosomal compartment may be used as a
store for the release of Ca2 þ into the cytoplasm.
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or ryanodine
receptors
on
the
sarcoplasmic
reticulum
(a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum)
can bind IP3 or cytoplasmic calcium, respective-
ly, triggering the opening of channels and re-
lease of Ca2 þ from the stores; in the muscle this
is used to regulate contractions.
Mechanically-gated ion channels
Some channels open in response to mechanical
deformation of the tissue.
Modulation of receptor gating
Many drugs and pharmacological compounds
modulate the behaviour of ion channels. These
compounds do not directly trigger or inhibit
the opening of channels; rather they change
the response of the channel to its natural
ligand:
. Binding of ligand to modulatory sites: distinct
from the ligand-binding site. These increase or
decrease the likelihood of a channel opening in
response to the ligand binding.
. Indirect modulation of channel opening: many
compounds act through the modulation of
different pathways (particularly through the
opening or closure of G-protein-coupled chan-
nels) resulting in covalent modiﬁcation of the
protein, especially through phosphorylation, to
alter the channel’s behaviour.
. Intracellular signals: many channels possess
modulatory sites in their intracellular do-
mains, permitting internal signals such as
Ca2 þ or ATP to modulate the behaviour of
the channel.
Intracellular pathways
In most cases, the binding of a ligand to its appro-
priate receptor modulates a second messenger
pathway. Second messenger systems have two
main beneﬁts:
1 Ampliﬁcation of responses – the binding of
a single molecule to its receptor can contribute
to the activation of many second messenger
molecules.
2 Integration of responses – a variety of different
receptors may target a single second messenger
pathway, allowing many different stimuli to be
integrated through a common second messen-
ger pathway.
82
Pharmacology

Many different second messenger pathways exist,
although there are three particularly prominent
examples (Fig. 5.3):
1 Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
2 Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)
3 Ca2 þ.
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP)
Production
cAMP is produced from ATP by the enzyme ade-
nylyl cyclase.
Actions
cAMP activates a variety of proteins, in particular
protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is made up of four
subunits – two regulatory and two catalytic. The
binding of cAMP to each regulatory subunit results
in their dissociation from the catalytic subunits,
allowing PKA activity. The cAMP is rapidly inacti-
vated through the action of cyclic nucleotide phos-
phodiesterase, which converts cAMP into a 50-AMP
molecule. The action of PKA ceases with the re-
association of the regulatory subunits with the
catalytic subunits.
Effects
Increased cAMP levels result in the phosphoryla-
tion of many cellular proteins through the action of
cAMP-dependent protein kinases, causing many
effects, including:
. Activating phosphorylase kinase, which acts on
many metabolic enzymes to promote the break-
down of glycogen
. Promoting the breakdown of lipids through the
activation of hormone-sensitive lipase
. Activating L-type Ca2 þchannels in the cardiac
myocytes to promote cardiac contraction.
Pharmacological modulation of cAMP
The predominant mechanism by which cAMP
levels are modulated is through the activation or
inhibition of the GPRCs which act through Gi
or Gs. In addition, increased cAMP levels can be
achieved through inhibition of the phosphodies-
terase enzymes that degrade cyclic nucleotide
monophosphates.
Methylxanthines act in this manner. They are
occasionally used in the treatment of asthma. This
class of drug also includes active compounds
found in tea and coffee.
Cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(cGMP)
Production
cGMP is produced by the enzyme guanylyl cyclase
and is not usually regulated by G-proteins; rather,
it is directly coupled to a receptor. cGMP is a
more specialised messenger than cAMP. In addi-
tion, the gaseous messenger nitric oxide (NO) can
diffuse into cells and activate cGMP production.
This is a crucial mechanism in endothelium-
mediated vasodilatation.
Actions
cGMP mediates its effects through the activation of
a variety of different cGMP-dependent protein
kinases and is selectively degraded by the enzyme
phosphodiesterase type V.
Pharmacological modulation
There are relatively few drugs that target cGMP.
There are two main sites of action in the cGMP
pathway:
1 NO donors (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate) release NO,
which activates cGMP synthase. They are potent
vasodilators, often used to treat angina.
2 Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. sildenaﬁl
citrate), which inhibit degradation of cGMP,
are used to aid erection by causing vasodila-
tation in the blood vessels of the corpus
cavernosum.
Calcium
The concentration of free calcium is much higher
outside the cell than inside it (2.4 mmol/L vs 0.1
mmol/L). Ca2 þ is a crucial second messenger in
cells and can be either released from intracellular
stores or obtained extracellularly. Ca2 þ in cells is
commonlyregulatedthroughthephospholipaseC/
inositol phosphate pathway. This pathway is regu-
lated through the signalling of G-proteins, namely
Gq,whichregulatethebreakdownofthemembrane
lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
and activation of phospholipase C (PLC), through
G-protein subunits (Gq). PLC catalyses the break-
down of PIP2 into two subunits that promote an
increase in Ca2 þ:
. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate acts on the IP3 re-
ceptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, increasing
the concentration of free Ca2 þ
within the
cytoplasm.
Pharmacology 83

. Diacylglycerol (DAG) activates protein kinase
C (PKC), which phosphorylates many intra-
cellular proteins. Most PKC isoforms require
an increased level of Ca2 þ to become acti-
vated, which is induced through G-protein
signalling.
. Ca2 þ
itself is capable of binding to many
enzymes in addition to PKC, to modulate their
activity.
Other targets of drug molecules
There are a few other mechanisms by which drugs
may act that are usually speciﬁc to individual
classes of drugs. In particular:
. Sequestration of cellular proteins, e.g. colchi-
cine inhibits the structural protein tubulin
. Modulation of the osmolality of a ﬂuid com-
partment, e.g. osmotic diuretics.
Cell-to-cell communications
Cell-to-cell junctions permit the passage of small
soluble molecules and ions between cells. This is
important in the communication between some
epithelial cells, and also within cardiac and smooth
muscles to coordinate contractions. These junc-
tions are made up of many connexin proteins on
each cell, which are linked to form a connexin
channel. Many different connexin proteins exist,
which can give channels different permeabilities to
different molecules.
Modulation and regulation of
pharmacological responses
The repeated administration of a drug may result
in changes in the response elicited. In particular,
desensitisation and modulation occur widely in
the body.
Desensitisation
The repeated administration of a drug can result
in a decrease in the effect that a given dose has.
This desensitisation can be divided into two
types,
although
the
distinction
is
not
well
deﬁned:
1 Tachyphylaxis is a rapid desensitisation to a drug,
which may occur over the course of minutes.
2 Tolerance is a more gradual and long-term
decrease in the response to an agent.
A variety of mechanisms may be responsible for
desensitisation:
. Change in the receptors
. Loss of receptors
. Exhaustion of mediators
. Increased metabolic degradation
. Physiological adaptation.
Change in receptors
A change in the conformation of a receptor, or its
modiﬁcation (e.g. phosphorylation), can alter the
behaviour of the receptor. In ligand-gated ion
channels, such a change can be rapid – often a
conformational change in the receptor, such that it
binds to its ligand without resulting in channel
opening. This is seen in voltage-gated Na þ chan-
nels in the action potential; it results in a refractory
period to allow re-establishment of the ion gradi-
ents so that another action potential can be
propagated.
In GPCRs, three steps of modiﬁcation can occur
to modulate receptors. At each step, the desensi-
tisation is more pronounced and recovery takes
longer:
1 The phosphorylation of serine residues in the
receptor’s cytoplasmic tail can result in desen-
sitisation, such that the receptor is less able to
activate its G-protein, despite binding of the
appropriate ligand.
2 The protein arrestinmay bind to phosphorylat-
ed serine, which further limits receptor activity
and may mark it receptor for internalisation.
3 The
receptors
may
be
internalised
by
endocytosis.
Loss of receptors
Prolonged exposure to an agonist can promote
the gradual removal of receptors through endo-
cytosis. As a result, a progressively larger dose of
an agent is required to mediate a similar effect,
because there are fewer targets on which the
agent may act.
Exhaustion of mediators
Desensitisation can result from a decrease in
the availability of an endogenous ligand. This
can be through either release of the agent faster
than it can be produced or depletion of an
intermediate.

cAMP 
Cyclic AMP is a very common 
second messenger pathway. It is 
commonly altered by the G 
proteins Gs and Gi, which 
promote and inhibit the activity 
of adenylyl cyclase respectively. 
Adenylyl cyclase (AC) is the 
enzyme responsible for 
converting ATP in the cell into 
cAMP.
The cAMP primarily acts by 
binding to, and thus activating, 
the enzyme protein kinase A 
(PKA), which goes on to 
phosphorylate many other 
enzymes downstream, to trigger 
many other intracellular 
pathways. It is degraded via the 
action of phosphodiesterase 
(PDE), which converts cAMP 
into its active form AMP.
cGMP 
Cyclic GMP functions in a 
similar way to cAMP, and is 
produced from GTP, by the 
enzyme guanylyl cyclase 
(GC). GC is activated by a 
variety of methods, most 
notably by the gaseous 
molecule nitric oxide (NO). 
The resulting cGMP 
activates the enzyme protein 
kinase G (PKG), which 
triggers further pathways 
downstream. The cGMP is 
degraded to GMP through 
the actions of type V PDE.
Ca2+
The Ca2+ is a crucial signalling 
pathway, responsible for many 
biological processes, including 
exocytosis, and muscular 
contraction. The major trigger 
of Ca2+ is activation of the 
enzyme phospholipase C 
(PLC). This can be triggered 
by many methods, in 
particular, the G protein Gq. 
PLC triggers the breakdown of 
the phospholipid 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-
bisphosphate (PIP2) into 
diacyglycerol (DAG) and 
inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 
(IP3). 
IP3 acts on its specific 
receptor within the cell which 
triggers release of Ca2+ from 
the endoplasmic reticulum to 
increase the cytoplasmic 
concentration. At the same 
time the DAG, together with 
Ca2+, can activate the enzyme 
protein kinase C (PKC). Many 
different forms of PKC can be 
found, with different 
downstream targets. The 
activation of PKC triggers a 
downstream effect. In 
addition, the increased Ca2+ 
within the cytoplasm can bind 
to and activate a variety of 
other enzymes, such as the 
activation of calmodulin to 
trigger muscular contraction.

systems. In each case the pathways focus on the activation of

Pharmacology 85

Physiological adaptation
Many agents perturb homoeostatic systems. As
a result the body adapts to counteract the
response, e.g. the effects of thiazide diuretics
gradually decrease as the renin–angiotensin sys-
tem becomes progressively activated.
Action on enzymes
Enzymes are involved in the synthesis and/or
breakdown of compounds in the body; modulating
their activity can affect a wide variety of pathways
within the body which is a particularly common
drug target. Three main pharmacological actions
can target enzymes:
1 Enzyme inhibitors
2 False substrates
3 Prodrugs.
Enzyme inhibitors
Enzyme inhibitors are the most common form of
agent. Common examples of such drugs are the
cyclooxygenase COX-2 inhibitors used to treat
acute inﬂammation.
CLINICAL COX-2 inhibitors
COX-2 is an important inﬂammatory enzyme and
the target of many non-steroidal anti-inﬂammato-
ry drugs. These can be broken down into two
groups:
1 Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-2. This property
allows aspirin to be used as an anticoagulant,
because it can effectively remove platelet COX-2.
As platelets are not nucleated, they are unable to
synthesise new COX-2
2 Ibuprofen and other COX-2 inhibitors are com-
petitive inhibitors. Although they are able to re-
duce inﬂammation, they do not have the anti-
platelet activity of aspirin.
COX-2 inhibitors also inhibit the housekeeping
gene, COX-1. This can lead to damage to the gastric
mucosa, because COX-1 mediated production of
prostaglandins normally inhibits acid secretion. As
a result, gastric ulceration, nausea, bleeding and
vomiting are all well-recognised side effects of
treating with COX-2 inhibitors.
False substrates
False substrates are metabolised by their target
enzyme to produce a molecule that is not usually
found within the body. False-substrates exert ac-
tions in two ways:
1 Through competing with the natural substrate
for the enzyme
2 Through generating an abnormal product that is
improperly used by the downstream pathways.
Nucleoside analogues (e.g. lamivudine) used in
the treatment of HIV are examples of this type
of drug.
Prodrugs
Prodrugs are given to the recipient in an inactive
form and are activated by enzymatic conversion
in the body, e.g. L-dopa is given to treat parkin-
sonism and must be converted to dopamine at the
blood–brain barrier; this then acts in the substan-
tia nigra.
Action on carrier proteins
Many molecules used by cells are not lipid soluble,
and must enter cells through a variety of carrier
protein mechanisms. Through modulation of the
activity of a carrier protein, the availability of the
molecules that it transports can be altered, affect-
ing the rate of reaction of all pathways dependent
on that compound. Three major classes of agents
can target carrier proteins:
1 Inhibitors
2 False substrates
3 Normal compounds.
Inhibitors

False substrates

Pharmacology

appropriately used by the systems in the cell.
They act by out-competing the natural ligand
for the carrier protein or speciﬁc elements of
the downstream pathway, because they cannot
be fully metabolised into an active product.
Normal compounds
In some cases, where disease results from the deﬁ-
ciency of a speciﬁc molecule, treatment can be
efﬁciently managed through replacement of this
molecule. This is often used to treat hormonal dis-
orders such as Addison’s disease, whereby cortisol
is supplied by regular injection because the adrenal
gland is unable to produce sufﬁcient amounts.
Pharmacokinetics
The effect of a drug depends not only on its precise
actions with a target receptor, but also through the
administration, distribution, metabolism and ex-
cretion of the agent in the body. This can alter its
availability at the site of the target receptor. Phar-
macokinetics refers to the processes that affect the
availability of a drug to its target and can be divided
into four main areas:
1 Administration
2 Distribution
3 Metabolism
4 Excretion.
Administration of a drug
The rate at which a drug is absorbed into the body
is dependent on three major factors:
1 Route of administration
2 Chemical nature of the compound
3 Formulation.
DEFINITION Bioavailability
Bioavailability is the fraction of a drug dose that
reaches the systemic circulation via a speciﬁc
route, in comparison with intravenous adminis-
tration (which, by deﬁnition, has a bioavailability
of 1, whereas all other routes will be between 0
and 1).
The precise route of administration depends
on the target site of the drug, and the rate at
which absorption is required, as well as the
convenience of the individual taking the drug.
Four broad routes of administration can be
identiﬁed:
. Through the mucosa
. By inhalation
. By injection
. By topical application.
Mucosal absorption
Absorption of a drug through the mucosa is
the route of choice for most drugs. The large sur-
face area of the mucosa allows the drugs to be
absorbed into the bloodstream, and, although
slower and more difﬁcult to regulate than intrave-
nous routes, there is no need for injection.
Sublingual administration
Absorption by this route is directly into the blood-
stream, permitting a rapid effect and also avoiding
potential breakdown if the compound is unstable
at the low pH of the gut. In addition, the drugs
avoid entering the portal system enter the blood-
stream without the potential for metabolism
within the liver. Glycerol trinitrate is typically
administered in this fashion.
Oral administration
Many drugs are administered orally, because it is
a convenient way for patients to take them.
Absorption of the agent occurs typically in the
gastrointestinal tract, although little usually oc-
curs until the small intestine. Weak acids can be
absorbed in the stomach, although the vastly
larger (about 1000 times) surface area of the
intestines results in it being the favoured site of
absorption for almost all drugs. Absorption in
the gut relies on diffusion and the factors regu-
lating absorption are the same in the gut as for
any other barrier:
. Membrane solubility
. Diffusivity
. Concentration gradient.
There are some drugs (e.g. proteins) that cannot be
given orally. Passage through stomach acid and the
gastrointestinal enzymes is likely to break down
the agent so that it is not effectively absorbed.
Pharmacology 87

Partitioning through pH and the
Henderson–Hasselbalch equation
In general, lipid-soluble substances are better
absorbed; strong acids and bases are poorly
absorbed because they remain fully ionised in
the
gut.
Most
drugs
that
are
administered
through orally are weak acids or bases, which
exist within the body in both ionised and non-
ionised forms.
The weaker the acid or base, the more readily
absorbed it will be because less of the drug is in the
ionised form. Even if there is only a small propor-
tion in the non-ionised form, the large surface area
of the gut ensures that a signiﬁcant proportion can
be absorbed.
The kinetics of dissociation are determined by
the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. For a weak
base, in the body it exists in equilibrium:
For a weak base : XH þ () X þ H þ
For a weak acid : YY  þ H þ :
The dissociation constant for the reaction is
given as the pKa, which would be the pH if the
protonated and unprotonated forms of the drug
were to exist at the same concentration:
pKa ¼ pH þ log10½Protonated compound=
½Unprotonated compound:
In most cases the Henderson–Hasselbalch equa-
tion provides a good calculation of the pKa,
although it has two assumptions that may affect the
values at particularly high or low concentrations:
. The dissociation of H2O to H þ and OH  has no
effect.
. Once the concentrations of the protonated and
unprotonated forms of the compound have been
established, they do not change.
Factors affecting absorption of a drug
In general, around 75% of an orally administered
drug is absorbed in 1–3 hours. Three major factors
can alter this:
1 Gastrointestinal motility
2 Blood ﬂow
3 Particle size and formulation.
Gastrointestinal motility
The motility of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has
a potentially huge effect on absorption. Conditions
such as migraines and diabetic neuropathy can
reduce the GI motility, increasing absorption from
the gut. In addition, excessive GI motility may
result in impaired absorption if the drug has
insufﬁcient time for absorption.
Drugs themselves may alter GI motility and thus
affect their own absorption, or the absorption of
other agents that have been co-administered,
e.g. metoclopramide increases GI motility and is
often given with analgesics in those who have
migraines to counteract the GI stasis that occurs
in this condition.
Blood ﬂow
A reduced blood ﬂow decreases absorption as the
rate of diffusion from the gut is reduced. This can
be crucial in hypovolaemia where the absorption
of any drugs given orally will be reduced.
Particle size and formulation
The formulation of drugs can be altered to produce
the desired absorption characteristics. In some
cases, capsules can be designed to break down
slowly to delay release (and subsequent absorp-
tion) of a drug. A mixture of fast- and slow-release
particles can be produced to generate sustained
absorption over a longer period.
This may reduce the adverse effects that can be
seen at the peak high plasma concentrations of a
drug. However, such mechanisms may lead to a
higher concentration of drug in the gut, leading to
side effects at this site.
Rectal absorption
Rectal administration can be used for drugs
required to produce a local effect, or as a route
of administration for systemic drugs. Rectal
administration is often used to give diazepam
to patients who have status epilepticus be-
cause
it
is
difﬁcult
to
obtain
intravenous
access.
Topical administration of drugs
Most drugs are not very lipid soluble and
absorbed poorly through the skin. This can be
used to advantage to restrict local effects while
avoiding systemic side effects. Other drugs (e.g.
steroids)
are
absorbed
signiﬁcantly
through
the skin, which can be exploited through trans-
dermal administration (e.g. nicotine patches) to
generate systemic effects. Such patches are ap-
plied to areas of thin skin; they release the drug
88
Pharmacology

over a long period of time. Furthermore, the
patch can easily be removed from the skin if the
drug generates unwanted effects.
Administration to the eye
Drugs can be applied as eye drops, which are
absorbed through the epithelium of the conjunc-
tival sac. The absorption of drugs through this
route requires signiﬁcant lipid solubility. Systemic
side effects are generally limited.
Administration by inhalation
Three groups of drugs are typically administered
by inhalation for distinct reasons:
1 Volatile gases and anaesthetics exploit the
large surface area of the lungs to allow rapid
adjustments to the plasma concentration of
the drug, providing tight control of the drug
level. Here, the lungs are the site of both
administration and excretion of the drug
2 Drugs that target the lungs allow the develop-
ment of a high concentration in the target tissue,
while minimising the potential for systemic
effects. Drugs given by this route are often mod-
iﬁed to reduce the potential for absorption into
the system.
3 Drugs that would be susceptible to break-
down in the GI tract can be given nasally. This
allows rapid entry of the drug to the systemic
circulation without the need for injections.
This
route
of
administration
is
typically
used for peptide drugs (e.g. gonadotrophin-
releasing hormone [GnRH] and desmopressin,
a synthetic form of antidiuretic hormone
[ADH]) which work at relatively low concen-
trations, although they would be broken down
in the GI tract.
Administration by injection
Injection provides the most rapid and certain route
of administration of a drug to the desired body
compartment. Three main routes of injection are
typically used in medicine:
1 Intravenous injection
2 Subcutaneous or intramuscular injection
3 Intrathecal injection into the subarachnoid
space allows administration of drugs that
would not normally pass the blood–brain
barrier.
Intravenous administration
Intravenous injection is commonly used to admin-
ister drugs because it is reliable and rapid. How-
ever, the rapid delivery can present problems with
the dosage of drug. A single bolus injection can
result in a very high concentration of the drug,
before it becomes distributed evenly across the
body
compartment.
The
peak
concentration
depends on the rate of the injection – the more
rapid the injection, the greater the concentration.
To maintain a steady concentration of drug in the
plasma, a steady infusion must be given.
Subcutaneous and intramuscular
injections
Subcutaneous and intramuscular injections are
a signiﬁcantly slower route than intravenous ad-
ministration. The rate of absorption varies with the
tissue used, and in particular with the rate of blood
ﬂow through the tissue. These routes of injection
are often favoured for ‘slow-release’ preparations.
Subcutaneous and intramuscular administration
can also be used to generate local effects.
Intrathecal injection
Intrathecal injection is via a lumbar puncture nee-
dle. This is usually performed for drugs that target
sites in the central nervous system (CNS) but do
not cross the blood–brain barrier; this precludes
intravenous administration. Intrathecal injection
of local anaesthetics can be used to develop
a spinal or regional anaesthesia (e.g. epidural).
CLINICAL Epidural anaesthesia
In childbirth an epidural anaesthetic is often used.
For this the needle is inserted into the epidural
space, a potential space outside the dura that is
created by injection of the anaesthetic. The anaes-
thetic diffuses from this space and acts on the nerve
roots as they exit the spine. An epidural needle can
be attached to a catheter which allows repeated
infusion of the anaesthetic, whereas a spinal anaes-
thetic needle,which enters the spinalcanal, must be
removed immediately after injection.
Distribution of drugs in the body
The distribution of drugs in the body refers to
factors that affect the concentration of a drug at
Pharmacology 89

its site of action. The distribution of a drug between
the body compartments is affected by:
. The
compartment
into
which
a
drug
is
administered
. Movement between body compartments
. Fat solubility of the drug
. The binding of the drug to cellular and plasma
proteins.
The body can be modelled as four compartments,
which can be further subdivided (Fig. 5.4). Typi-
cally, total body water accounts for around 70% of
body weight; in a 70-kg individual the size of the
relevant body compartments can be estimated as:
Extracellular ﬂuids
Blood plasma
Interstitial ﬂuid
Transcellular ﬂuid
Intracellular ﬂuid
14 L
3 L
10 L
1 L
28 L
Intracellular ﬂuid is the ﬂuid contained within
all the cells in the body.
Transcellular ﬂuid includes the cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (CSF), intraocular, peritoneal, pleural and
synovial ﬂuids.
DEFINITION Volume of distribution (Vd)
Vd is the volume of plasma that would contain the
total body content of the drug at a content equal to
that in the plasma. This measure provides an indi-
cation of the distribution of a drug:
Drugs that are mainly protein bound stay mainly
in the plasma compartment, resulting in a
small Vd.
Drugs that accumulate outside the plasma may
have a large Vd, often greater than the total
body volume. This is often seen in lipid-solu-
ble drugs, which can accumulate in fats.
There are two main methods of drug transport
within the body:
1 Bulk ﬂow transfer (i.e. in the bloodstream) is the
mass movement of particles through a compart-
ment, and is not inﬂuenced by the chemical
nature of the drug.
2 Diffusion occurs over very small distances.
The differences in the pharmacokinetics of
drugs
are
the
result
of
their
diffusional
characteristics.
The body can be modelled as a series of compart-
ments. The crucial effects of distribution are
mediated through the movement of drugs across
the
diffusion
barriers
between
the
different
compartments.
Movement of drugs across
diffusion barriers
The barriers between different compartments are
made up of cell membranes:
. A single cell membrane separates intracellular
and extracellular compartments.
. Epithelial barriers between two extracellular
compartmentsaremadeupoftwocellmembrane
layers – the drugs must pass through both the
apical and the basolateral membranes. There is
limited scope for paracellular absorption be-
tweenthecells,duetothetightjunctionsinplace.
The nature of the endothelial barriers between the
bloodstream and the interstitial ﬂuid is more
complex:
. In most tissues capillaries are fenestrated,
such that small molecules do not need to pass
across a diffusion barrier. Larger molecules
(>30 kDa) cannot pass through fenestrations
(i.e. most proteins).
. In some sites continuous endothelium can be
found – especially in the central nervous system
(CNS) and the placenta. These sites require
transport or diffusion of all molecules across the
diffusion barrier, which can severely affect the
distribution of a drug.
Molecules can pass across cell membranes in one
(or more) of four ways:
1 Diffusion across the lipid bilayer
2 Transport across a bilayer by a carrier protein
3 By pinocytosis
4 Diffusion through aqueous pores in the lipid
bilayer.
Diffusion across lipid
As many drugs are weak acids or bases, the ratio of
ionised to unionised forms of a drug depends on
the pH.
The different pH in different body compart-
ments
can
modify
the
distribution
between
compartments. In each compartment, the ratio of
90
Pharmacology

ionised:unionised drug is determined by the pKa of
the drug and the pH of the compartment. The
resulting distribution of a drug can be predicted
using the assumption that unionised species can
freely cross the membranes, whereas ionised spe-
cies cannot cross the membrane. However, large
distributions between compartments are unlikely
to be as large as predicted, because small ‘leaks’

Administration
The majority of routes into the body focus on administering drugs 
directly or indirectly into the bloodstream. In particular, this may be 
achieved by intravenous injection, when drugs directly enter the 
bloodstream; or through inhalation, when the large diffusible area of 
the lungs assures rapid entry of drugs into the blood.
Oral
One of the most common 
forms of administration is 
orally, when drugs enter the 
portal circulation via the 
gastrointestinal tract. This 
route of administration is 
reliable and does not require 
individuals taking the drugs to 
be able to inject themselves. 
However, oral administration 
may not be effective if the 
drugs are readily metabolised 
by the liver (‘first-pass 
metabolism’).
Tissue
In most cases, specific cells 
in the tissues are the target 
of a specific drug – equilib-
rium is set up between the 
concentration of the drug in 
the blood and that in the fluid 
surrounding the tissue. In 
addition, drugs may be 
administered directly into the 
tissue, to slow the release 
into the blood or to generate 
specific localised effects.
Fat
Although most drugs are 
polar, and do not enter body 
fat, there are a few rare 
cases where the drugs do, 
and they can act as a 
reservoir in equilibrium with 
the blood. This may prolong 
presence of the drug in the 
body far longer than would 
otherwise be expected (fat: 
water coefficient).
Blood
The blood forms the central 
storage of most drugs within 
the body – it is in equilibrium 
with the fluid surrounding the 
tissues; it carries the drug 
from its route of administra-
tion to its site of action and 
also to the locations where it 
may be metabolised and/or 
excreted.
CSF
The brain is separated from 
the blood by the blood–brain 
barrier, and is bathed in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The 
blood–brain barrier prevents 
the movement of many drugs 
from the blood and, instead, 
access is often sought by 
intrathecal injection.
Figure 5.4 Distribution of drugs in differentbody compartments. Drugsare often administered to compartments
of the body different from the site at which they act. Between each compartment of the body, there is equilibrium
which alters partitioning of the drug. Furthermore, barriers between compartments may selectively prevent
movement of the drug, or, in some cases, result in its metabolism and inactivation. CSF, cerebrospinal ﬂuid.
Pharmacology 91

contribute to a signiﬁcant decrease in the gradients
that can be generated:
. Charged species are not totally impermeable.
A small degree of permeability can considerably
reduce the concentration
gradient
between
compartments.
. Equilibrium between the different body com-
partments is almost never achieved. The ﬂuid in
the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and renal tubule is
constantly in motion, leading to a ﬂux of drug
molecules.
Despite these obstacles, pH partitioning explains
many factors of drug distribution, particularly in
relation to the blood–brain barrier and renal excre-
tion. However, it is not a major factor in absorption
of drugs from the GI tract. The huge surface area of
the intestines abrogates any pH effect.
CLINICAL Exploitation of pH
partitioning
The partitioning of the pH can be exploited clinically
to concentrate drugs in a body compartment,
to increase their action or the rate of excretion:
. Urinary acidiﬁcation increases the excretion of
weak bases and inhibits that of weak acids.
. Increasing plasma pH causes the extraction of
weak acids from the CNS.
. Reducing pH can concentrate acidic drugs within
the CNS.
Carrier-mediated transport of drugs
Cells regulate the transport of physiologically im-
portant molecules (many of which cannot diffuse
across a lipid bilayer unaided) by carrier proteins.
Drugs may use these carrier systems, because they
are often structurally related to endogenous mo-
lecules. The transport of a drug may be active or
passive, and show similar kinetics to the transport
of endogenous molecules. Furthermore, the pres-
ence of the drug can act as a competitive inhibitor
for the transport of endogenous molecules, and
vice versa, because they compete for the same
binding sites.
Partitioning of drugs into body fat
Fat typically makes up around 15% of the body
weight and is essentially non-polar. Two major
factors inﬂuence the distribution of drugs between
the body fat and the plasma:
1 The fat:water coefﬁcient
2 Blood supply to the fatty tissue.
Fat:water coefﬁcient
The fat:water partition coefﬁcient determines the
distribution of a drug, at equilibrium, between the
fat and body water. Body fat can act as a large
store that communicates with the plasma, slowly
releasing a drug as it is cleared from the plasma.
Most drugs have a very low fat:water coefﬁcient;
as such this has little impact on the use of the
drug. Partitioning in body fat is a crucial consid-
eration in drugs with a high fat:water coefﬁcient
(e.g. thiopental).
Blood supply
Fatty tissue receives a very low proportion of the
blood supply (<5%), resulting in slow delivery to
the fatty tissues, requiring a long time to reach
equilibrium.
Accumulation of drugs in other tissues
There are rare instances of drugs that accumulate
in other locations within the body, and there are
three of particular importance:
1 Drugs with an afﬁnity for nucleic acids (e.g.
mepacrine, an antimalarial drug): these drugs are
typically taken up by the nuclei of hepatocytes.
2 Chloroquine has an afﬁnity for melanin. It is
alsotakenupintheretina,andcancauseretinitis
in overdose.
3 Tetracyclines accumulate in the bones and
teeth because they have a high afﬁnity for
calcium; this can result in bone and dental
deformities seen in children.
Binding of drugs to plasma proteins
Many drugs bind plasma proteins, effectively
reducing the concentration of free drug, which is
able to diffuse into another body compartment.
The bound drug acts as a reservoir, similar to the
effect seen in fat partitioning. The most important
molecule with regard to drug binding is albumin,
which binds a large proportion of acidic drugs, as
well as some basic drugs. The amount of drug
bound depends on three factors:
1 Concentration of free drug
2 Afﬁnity of the drug for binding sites
3 Concentration of binding protein, which deter-
mines the number of available binding sites.
92
Pharmacology

Binding of drugs to protein is a reaction similar to
drug–receptor binding, although more complex
because albumin has at least two binding sites:
. The normal concentration of plasma albumin is
about 0.6 mmol/L, although the existence
of two binding sites allows it to bind drugs at
1.2 mmol/L.
. In many drugs the therapeutic concentration
of the drug approaches saturation of binding
sites. Consequently, addition of more drug
results in a disproportionate increase in the
free plasma concentration. This is particularly
important when a patient is taking several
drugs.
The binding of a drug to plasma protein reduces
its potential for renal clearance because pro-
teins, and the molecules bound to them, are not
ﬁltered.
Metabolism of drugs
Drugs can be enzymatically modiﬁed or broken
down within the body to abolish their activity,
typically in the liver. Metabolism of drugs is less
crucial in polar drugs, which are typically excreted
in the urine in an unchanged state.
Drug metabolism is a relatively non-selective
system that is used to detoxify the body of both
exogenously and endogenously derived molecules.
The enzymes involved in detoxiﬁcation are com-
monly found on the smooth endoplasmic reticu-
lum (ER) of cells. The reactions can be broken
down into two phases, both of which take place
predominantly in the liver, which means that the
drugs have to cross the hepatocyte cell membranes
to be metabolised:
1 PhaseIreactionsoftenmakethedrugmolecules
more reactive. This helps their subsequent con-
jugation to other molecules for excretion and
also reduces the lipid solubility of the molecule,
retaining it in the plasma.
2 Phase II reactions utilise the reactive groups
added in phase I reactions to conjugate larger
groups to drug molecules. The resulting polar
groups aidexcretion ofthe moleculeandprevent
its diffusion to another body compartment.
Phase I reactions
Phase I reactions often result in the production of
a more reactive molecule, which may be more toxic
than the parent drug. Three major reactions that
occur in phase I can be identiﬁed:
. Oxidation
. Reduction
. Hydrolysis
Oxidation
Oxidative reactions include the hydroxylation of
nitrogen and carbon as well as oxidative deami-
nation. These reactions are usually catalysed by the
cytochrome P450 system on the smooth ER.
DEFINITION Cytochrome P450
system
The cytochrome P450 pathway is made up of
a series of closely related enzymes with broad
speciﬁcities. It is commonly used in the metabolism
of many drugs, and its inhibition can result in many
drug-related side effects. In particular, grapefruit
juice and St John’s wort contain chemicals that
inhibit the activity of P450, which accounts for their
potentially serious interactions with other drugs. The
net result is the addition of a hydroxyl group using
O2 as the oxidant and NADPH to provide a source of
H þ for H2O.
Reduction
Reduction is a less common method of drug
metabolism. Warfarin is one agent, the metabo-
lism of which involves reduction –a ketone group is
converted to a hydroxyl group. Reduction can also
be used to activate drugs: glucocorticoids may be
given as ketones but must be reduced to become
active.
Hydrolysis
Hydrolysis typically occurs in the plasma and
tissue, and does not involve the hepatic smooth
ER enzymes. Ester and amide bonds in drugs are
commonly hydrolysed.
Phase II reactions
The reactive groups added in phase I reactions are
used to allow the conjugation of larger groups to
the molecules. Phase II reactions commonly occur
in the liver but can also occur in other tissues.
Pharmacology 93

Sugar conjugation
Conjugation usually results in the addition of
glucuronide,
catalysed
by
UDP-glucuronsyl
transferases (UDP is uridine diphosphate). The
resulting conjugate can be excreted from the body
in the bile (e.g. chloramphenicol).
Sulphation
The addition of sulphur groups is catalysed by
sulphotransferase enzymes in the liver and blood
cells. Soluble conjugates resulting from this pro-
cess can be excreted in the urine or bile. An exam-
ple of a product metabolised by sulphation is
salbutamol.
Glutathione
Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide added to mole-
cules in a reaction catalysed by glutathione-S-
transferase, found in the cytosol, particularly of
the lungs. The resulting conjugate is metabolised
to mercapturic acid and excreted in the urine (e.g.
paracetamol). There is variability in the activity of
the transferase enzymes involved in this process,
particularly as a result of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deﬁciency.
Acetylation
Acetyl coenxyme A (acetyl-CoA) may be trans-
ferred as a conjugate using the enzyme N-acetyl-
transferase.
Acetylation
is
important
for
the
clearance of sulphonamides, with the resulting
conjugate being excreted in the urine.
Induction of metabolic enzymes
Many drugs can induce the activity of the phase I
and II enzymes if given repeatedly due to increased
synthesis of the metabolic enzymes. Although such
increases are usually restricted to the few enzymes
involved
in
metabolism
of
the
drug,
some
compounds (e.g. phenobarbital) cause a more
non-selective increase, resulting in a general
acceleration of the drug’s action.
The induction of metabolic enzymes can in-
crease
the
effects
of
a
drug.
Paracetamol
toxicity is predominantly the result of the phase
I metabolite of paracetamol. The induction of
additional enzymes results in more rapid produc-
tion of metabolites, increasing the likelihood of
toxicity.
DEFINITION First-pass metabolism
Drugs that given orally enter the body’s circulation
viatheportalsystemandmustpassthroughtheliver.
They can be metabolised and inactivated before
reaching the systemic circulation – this is known as
ﬁrst-pass metabolism. First-pass metabolism can
require a larger dose of a drug given orally, com-
pared with other routes. Also, marked variation in
the extent of ﬁrst-pass metabolism can lead to
unpredictability in the plasma level of the drug.
Metabolism of a drug may alter its effects: aspirin
(salicylic acid) is an anti-inﬂammatory drug that also
has anti-platelet activity. However, after hydrolysis
to salicylate, the platelet activity is abolished, due to
changes in the nature of its binding to its target
molecule.
Excretion of drugs
Drugs or their metabolites can be removed from
the body by several routes:
. Renal excretion – the major route by which drugs
are removed from the body
. Biliary and faecal excretion
. Milk – important in breastfeeding women
. Sweat – generally not signiﬁcant.
Renal excretion of drugs and
metabolites
In drugs that do not undergo signiﬁcant metabo-
lism, excretion is the major factor determining the
duration of action. This may have implications
in patients with impaired renal function. Renal
handling of drugs varies: penicillin can be cleared
almost entirely in a single pass through the
kidneys, whereas diazepam is cleared extremely
slowly. In most cases the products of phase I and II
metabolism are cleared more quickly than the
parent drug molecule. Three broad processes in
the kidneys can affect drug excretion:
1 Glomerular ﬁltration
2 Tubular secretion and reabsorption
3 Passive diffusion across the tubular epithelium.
Glomerular ﬁltration
The fenestrations in the glomerular capillaries
allow the ﬁltration of most free drug molecules
(a molecular weight or Mr of less than about
94
Pharmacology

20 000). Some drugs bind signiﬁcantly to plasma
proteins, which are not ﬁltered; as a result the
concentration of drug entering the nephron is
correspondingly reduced.
Tubular secretion and reabsorption
Around 20% of ﬂuid is ﬁltered from the plasma
into the nephron, the remaining 80% passing on to
the peritubular capillaries; here two systems may
transport drug molecules further into the nephron.
Both systems can transport a variety of molecules
against their concentration gradients, potentially
reducing the plasma concentration to close to 0.
This mechanism allows the clearance of drugs
that are mostly bound to plasma protein, over the
length of the peritubular capillaries.
Most drugs that are secreted share the same
transport system, so competition between drugs
for the transport system is possible, e.g. probene-
cid has been used clinically to reduce excretion of
penicillin because both molecules compete for the
same transporter.
Diffusion across the renal tubule
Water is progressively removed along the length of
the nephron. If the tubule is permeable to drug
molecules the concentration of the drug will
remain similar to that of plasma, such that large
proportions of the drug will be reabsorbed with the
water.
Diffusion trapping
Polar drugs are poorly lipid permeable, and can be
concentrated in the urine as water is removed.
Weak acids and bases change their ionisation with
pH, and this can be exploited to affect excretion.
Low pH will favour the ionisation of a basic drug,
increasing its trapping within the tubule.
Urinary alkalisation can be used to increase
the excretion of acidic drugs (e.g. aspirin in cases
of overdose)
Acidiﬁcation of urine can accelerate excretion
of basic drugs, although this has few clinical
applications.
CLINICAL Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetics is the study of the genetic
variation in an individual, to anticipate his or her
potential responsiveness to a drug. This may allow
doctors to predict which drugs are likely to be
effective and which will cause side effects.
Biliary excretion and circulation
Some drugs are excreted from the liver into the
biliary system. This can be achieved by one of three
systems:
. Acidic handling system – similar to that in the
renal tubule
. Basic handling system – similar to that in the
renal tubule
. Concentration of hydrophilic drug conjugates in
bile.
Drugs are frequently conjugated to glucuronide.
During release, glucuronide conjugates can
become hydrolysed in the intestine, allowing
the reabsorption of the free drug. This recircu-
lation can create a reservoir of a drug, prolong-
ing its action. Morphine is recycled in this
manner.
Variation of drug effect
between individuals
A similar dose of drug can affect different
individuals to different extents. Even if control-
ling for differences in size and weight, in one
individual a drug may function well, whereas
in another it can cause serious side effects.
Four major causes of such differences in drug
effect:
. Genetic differences
. Age
. Underlying diseases
. Drug–drug interactions.
Genetic differences
Differences in every individual’s genetic code
can affect the ability to process different drugs.
These differences are typically the result of ge-
netic variation in the drug target molecule, or
enzymes involved in processing of the drug.
Pharmacogenetics aims to proﬁle such differ-
ences in individuals, allowing prediction of an
individual’s susceptibility to a speciﬁc therapy.
Some genetic differences are already well known
to account for the side effects of drugs (e.g.
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deﬁciency
affects glutathione-mediated drug metabolism).
Pharmacology 95

Age
Age-related differences in drug tolerance are due to
the reduced kidney function of young children and
elderly people.
In
newborn
children,
particularly
those
born preterm, the kidneys function poorly.
This function rapidly increases in the ﬁrst few
months.
As people age, the glomerular ﬁltration rate
decreases. It is around 50% of its starting value at
the age of 70. Correspondingly, excretion of a drug
requires a signiﬁcantly longer period.
There is a similar factor of age in relation to the
metabolism of drugs and partitioning:
. Many liver enzymes involved in detoxiﬁcation
are not fully expressed until 8 weeks after
birth.
. In elderly people, the level of detoxifying
enzymes tends to be reduced. Furthermore,
the increased level of lipids in the body can
increase
the
partitioning
of
lipid-soluble
drugs.
CLINICAL Pregnancy and sensitivity to
drugs
Pregnancy is an important consideration with the
administration of drugs for three main reasons:
1 The fetus may be affected by drugs at much
lower doses than the mother, often causing seri-
ous developmental abnormalities.
2 During pregnancy, there is increased renal
excretion, as a result of the mother’s in-
creased cardiac output increasing systemic
blood ﬂow.
3 Plasma protein concentration is reduced dur-
ing pregnancy, altering drug binding in the
compartment.
The fetus effectively forms a separate compartment
and this can be exploited. Drugs that do not cross
the placenta can be used to treat the mother, while
not affecting the fetus.
Effects of disease on drug
sensitivity
Diseases can affect every step of drug sensitivity,
through altering both the pharmacokinetics and
the pharmacodynamics. All four processes that
alter the pharmacokinetics of a drug may be
affected by disease:
1 Absorption of a drug from the gut can be altered
if blood ﬂow to the gut has been affected or if
there is an abnormality in gut movement.
2 Distribution of a drug may be impaired by
breakdown of the barriers between compart-
ments (e.g. breakdown of the blood–brain
barrier in many infectious diseases).
3 Metabolism in the liver is affected by chronic
liver disease, because this reduces function.
4 Excretion is reduced by renal failure.
Disease can affect the pharmacodynamics of drug
interaction:
. In myasthenia gravis, the nicotinic acetylcho-
line
(ACh)
receptor
at
the
neuromuscular
junction is reduced due to the presence of auto-
antibodies. As such, drugs acting on this receptor
may require higher concentrations to elicit a
similar result to that seen in a healthy individual.
. Some individuals have diabetes insipidus due to
a mutation in their ADH receptor. Such indivi-
duals cannot be treated by synthetic ADH
molecules because their diabetes insipidus re-
sults from production of non-functional ADH.
Drug–drug interactions
Many patients, particularly those with chronic
conditions, are often treated by many drugs.
Should they also develop an infection or other
acute condition, additional treatment may be re-
quired. The use of multiple drugs (polypharmacy)
can result in interaction between the different
drugs, which can alter their effects.
Pharmacodynamic interaction
of drugs
There are many forms of pharmacodynamic
interaction, many of which are very speciﬁc. Al-
though some such interactions can be extremely
beneﬁcial, most are detrimental, due to either
excessive side effects or the drugs cancelling each
other out:
. Antagonist and agonist drugs that act on the
same receptor will cancel each other’s effects
(e.g. b blockers and b-adrenoceptor agonists).
. Drugs that target the same pathway may act
synergistically to cause an excessive response,
e.g.
sildenaﬁl
acts
by
inhibiting
type
V
96
Pharmacology

phosphodiesterase, which breaks down cGMP. If
used together with a nitric oxide donor, which
increases the activity of guanylyl cyclase, they
can cause extreme hypotension.
Many interactions are more complex than these
examples, as a result of the interaction between
different pathways in the body.
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Absorption
Drugs that alter the activity of the GI tract are likely
to affect the absorption of drugs through this route.
Absorption from intramuscular locations can be
modulated by adrenaline, which vasoconstricts
arterioles and reduces movement of drug into the
blood. This effect can be exploited by local anaes-
thetics, where conﬁning drugs can prolong their
effect.
Distribution
In general, drugs rarely alter the distribution of
a drug sufﬁciently to be clinically signiﬁcant.
The addition of a second drug to the plasma com-
partment may displace the drug from its binding
to plasma proteins; however, the free drug will
be rapidly cleared to restore equilibrium. In the
meantime, the elevated concentration may be
sufﬁcient to cause side effects.
Metabolism
As drugs can cause induction of enzymes or inhibit
enzymes, drugs that modify metabolism may be
hazardous or have potential beneﬁts:
. Enzyme induction can decrease the activity of
a drug, commonly through upregulation of en-
zymes in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system (see
earlier). The upregulation may also cause poten-
tially harmful side effects through an increase in
the production of metabolites (e.g. paracetamol
toxicity)
. Enzyme inhibition can reduce the metabolism
of drugs and increase their action. In addition,
some dietary elements – particularly grapefruit
juice – inhibit the CYP pathway, and can cause
reduce drug metabolism.
Excretion
There are three major mechanisms by which one
drug can affect the excretion of another:
. Altering ﬁltration is generally due to modulation
of the binding of a drug to plasma protein. In-
creasing the concentration of free drug will in-
crease the amount ﬁltered.
. Altering pH partitioning may aid or restrict
diffusion trapping. This can be used either
to reduce excretion of a drug or to increase
removal of a drug in an overdose (e.g. aspirin
overdose).
. Altering secretion into the nephron can be
achieved if both drugs are secreted by similar
transport systems. This will increase the clear-
ance time, particularly if one drug is preferen-
tially secreted.

Cardiovascular system
The cardiovascular system transports nutrients to
tissues, removes waste to be processed, and carries
hormones and other signals throughout the body.
It is made up of three components: the heart, the
vasculature and the blood.
Contraction of the heart forces blood from its
chambers into the pulmonary arteries and the
aorta,tobecarriedaroundthesystemiccirculation.
Blood ﬂows from the heart through the arteries to
thecapillaries,thenarrowvesselswherediffusionis
possible to allow movement of molecules between
the blood and tissues. After this, blood drains back
to larger veins before it enters the other side of the
heart to be pumped around the pulmonary circu-
lation. The distribution of the blood varies with the
need of the tissues themselves, and is achieved
through a series of regulatory mechanisms.
Given the important function that the cardio-
vascular system performs, it is not surprising that
many pathologies affect it. In particular, there is a
potential for fatty deposits to build up, leading to
the development of atherosclerotic lesions; these
cause narrowing of the vessels and restricted
blood ﬂow.
Functional anatomy
of the heart
External anatomy of the heart
The external anatomy of the heart and its relations
are covered in Chapter 14. However, a few struc-
tures of particular functional importance are
covered below. The heart is located in the medi-
astinum, enclosed within a ﬁbrous sac – the peri-
cardium. It is connected to the systemic circula-
tion by the aorta and the vena cava, and to the
pulmonary circulation by the pulmonary vessels.
DEFINITION Systemic and pulmonary
circulations
There are two circulatory systems in the body,
arranged in series so that blood from one circulation
ﬂows into the other:
. The systemic circulation carries the blood to the
tissues of the body to supply it with oxygen and
nutrients for respiration.
. The pulmonary circulation carries blood to and
from the lungs where waste CO2 can be removed
and the blood reoxygenated.
Pericardium
The pericardium is made up of two layers of tissue
surrounding a potential space:
. The visceral layer is attached directly to the heart
tissues.
. The ﬁbrous layer is attached to other mediasti-
nal structures.
The pericardial space between the two layers is
lined by a single layer of mesothelial cells, which
secrete ﬂuid to allow movement of layers of the
pericardium without friction.

The ﬁbrous pericardium is attached to other
mediastinal structures:
. The central tendon of the diaphragm
. The sternum, by the sternopericardial ligaments
. The posterior structures of the mediastinum
. The great vessels which must pierce the pericar-
dium to enter the heart.
The visceral layer of the pericardium is reﬂected
to become a parietal layer and forms two sinuses at
these folds:
1 The transverse pericardial sinus is located
where the aortic and pulmonary trunks leave
the heart.
2 Theobliquepericardialsinusisfoundwherethe
vena cavae and pulmonary veins enter the heart.
The pericardium is innervated by the phrenic
nerve (C3–5). As a result, damage to the pericar-
dium can result in referred pain to the shoulder on
the same side.
CLINICAL Cardiac tamponade
The pericardial space may become ﬁlled with ﬂuid
(i.e. blood) during trauma, which prevents ade-
quate ﬁlling of the heart if the pressure in the peri-
cardium exceeds that in the atria. This is cardiac
tamponade. Typically, mean atrial pressure is
0–3 mmHg, so little ﬂuid is needed to limit the ﬁlling
of the heart.
Great vessels entering and exiting
the heart
The heart is divided into right and left sides. The
large vessels entering and leaving the various
chambers of the heart receive blood from one
entire circulatory system and distribute it to the
other (Fig. 6.1):
. The aorta receives blood from the left ventricle.
The coronary arteries leave the aorta at the aortic
sinuses, located immediately distal to the aortic
valve.
. The systemic circulation drains into the right
atrium. The superior vena cava enters the right
atrium superiorly at the level of the third costal
cartilage and the inferior vena cava at the level of
the ﬁfth costal cartilage. The coronary sinus,
which drains the heart tissue itself, enters the
heart between the right atrioventricular (AV)
oriﬁce and the opening of the inferior vena cava.
. The pulmonary circulation drains into the left
atrium. Two pulmonary veins are derived from
each lung: one vein from each lung enters supe-
riorly and one inferiorly.
. The right ventricle pumps blood to the pulmo-
nary circulation, through the pulmonary trunk
which divides into the left and right pulmonary
arteries.
Interior anatomy of the heart
The heart contains four chambers, each with a
speciﬁc function. The atria receive venous blood
and transfer to the corresponding ventricle, to be
pumped around either the systemic or the pulmo-
nary circulation.
. The right atrium possesses an auricle, a muscu-
lar pouch that increases the volume of the cham-
ber. The atrial septum, which separates the left
and right atria, contains an oval-shaped depres-
sion, the fossa ovalis, which is the remains of the
foramen ovale in the fetus.
. The right ventricle receives blood from the right
atrium through the right AV oriﬁce, which is
sealed by the tricuspid valve. The right ventricle
expels blood through the pulmonary valve into
the pulmonary trunk.
. The left atrium receives blood from four pul-
monary veins. The atrial wall is smooth except
within the auricle, which has a different embry-
ological derivation. The left atrium has a slightly
thicker wall than the right atrium and dis-
charges blood through the left AV oriﬁce into
the left ventricle.
. The left ventricle receives blood from the left
atrium via the left AV oriﬁce, which is sealed by
the mitral valve. Contraction of the left ventricle
expels blood into the aorta.
Heart valves
There are two distinct types of heart valve with
different structures and functions:
1 The AV valves consist of ﬁbrous leaﬂets covered
in endothelium tethered by the chorda tendi-
nae. These mitral (two-cusp) and tricuspid
(three-cusp) valves permit the ﬂow of blood
from the atrium to the left and right ventricles
respectively, while preventing ﬂow in the oppo-
site direction.
Cardiovascular system 99

2 The semilunar valves are found between the
ventricles and their outﬂow vessels. They are
made of three semilunar cusps, which ﬁll and
close as blood attempts to regurgitate into the
heart chambers. The aortic valves are situated
in swellings in the aorta, known as the aortic
sinuses. The pulmonary valves are found at the
start of the pulmonary trunk.
DEFINITION
Chordae
tendinae
and
papillary muscles
During ventricular contraction, the pressure within
the chamber rises drastically. To prevent their open-
ing, the cusps of the mitral and tricuspid valves are
tethered by the chorda tendinae. These tendons
are linked to the papillary muscles found on the
ventricle walls; the muscles contract to oppose the
opening of the valve leaﬂets. The papillary muscles
are more developed in the left ventricle, to oppose
the greater force generated.
CLINICAL Valve sounds
The competency of the valves can be assessed by
listening at speciﬁc points on the chest surface.
These points reﬂect the transmission of the valve
sound, basedon theﬂow of bloodthroughthevalves,
and may be some distance from the site of the valve:
. The mitral valve is heard close to the apex beat.
. The tricuspid valve is heard close to the sternum
at the ﬁfth intercostal space.
. The aortic and pulmonary valves are best heard
at the second intercostal space on the right and
left sides, respectively.
Blood supply to the heart tissue
The heart requires a blood supply to its tissue,
provided through the coronary circulation. The
left and right coronary arteries arise at the aortic
sinuses and branch around the heart to supply the

entire tissue. Blood ﬂow is intermittent, entering
the coronary arteries as a result of turbulence in the
aortic sinuses during diastole. Although there are
side branches connecting the major coronary ar-
teries, these branches are rarely sufﬁcient to pro-
vide adequate blood ﬂow if a blockage develops in
the major supply vessel. The organisation of the
circulation discussed below is the most common
arrangement, although there is considerable vari-
ation between individuals.
Right coronary artery
The rightcoronaryartery(RCA)arisesfrom the right
aortic sinus and is usually the dominant artery (in
around 90% of individuals), in that it provides the
posterior interventricular artery. This branch tra-
vels towards the apex of the heart and supplies
much of the diaphragmatic surface of the heart and
the posterior part of the interventricular septum.
The RCA runs in the AV groove of the heart and
usually provides a branch to the sinoatrial (SA)
node of the heart. As the artery descends down
the AV groove it provides a right marginal branch,
which supplies the right border of the heart.
Left coronary artery
The left coronary artery (LCA) arises from the left
aortic sinus, passing through the coronary groove
before dividing into two branches:
1 The circumﬂex artery travels along the left bor-
der of the heart to the posterior aspect. In around
40% of people, the SA nodal branch arises from
the circumﬂex artery; this gives rise to the left
marginal artery which follows the left margin
of the heart and supplies the left ventricle.
The artery terminates on the posterior surface
of the heart, often anastomosing with the
posterior interventricular branch.
2 Theanteriorinterventricularbranchisthelarg-
er branch of the left coronary artery, and passes
along the interventricular groove towards the
apex of the heart. Its anterior interventricular-
branch supplies the anterior two-thirds of the
interventricular septum.
CLINICAL Myocardial infarction
The myocardial tissue is highly dependent on receiv-
ing a rich blood ﬂow to meet its metabolic needs. On
occasion, a blockage of one of the coronary vessels
may occur due to a blood clot, or other embolus. The
tissue downstream of the blockage initially becomes
ischaemic, causing pain – angina. If the blockage
continues it leads to death of a region of the heart.
Initial treatment of a myocardial infarction (MI)
is, where possible, by stenting open the blocked
vessel to restore blood ﬂow. At-risk patients may be
given long-term anticoagulant therapy to limit the risk
of thrombus formation. Myocardial tissue cannot re-
grow,sodamagedtissueisreplacedbyﬁbroustissue
and,eveniftheindividualsurvivestheheartattack,the
functionality of the heart is likely to be compromised.
Venous drainage of the heart
These veins draining the heart tissue eventually
drain into the coronary sinus which runs in the AV
groove of the heart and opens into the right atrium.
It receives venous blood from three main veins
within the heart:
. The great cardiac vein drains the regions sup-
plied by the LCA.
. The middle and small cardiac veins drain the
regions supplied predominantly by the RCA and
its branches.
Some parts of the heart do not drain into the
coronary sinus. Instead they are drained by other
vessels into the right atrium:
. The anterior cardiac veins arise on the anterior
surface of the right ventricle, and mostly drain
directly into the right atrium, although some
enter the small cardiac vein.
. The smallest cardiac veins, which are direct
communications with the capillary beds of the
heart muscle, may drain blood directly into the
heart chambers.
CLINICAL Valve abnormalities
Valve defects are detectable by changes in the
valve sounds. Two main classes of abnormalities
produce distinctive murmurs:
1 Stenosis. This is the narrowing of the valve
so that a higher pressure is required to force
the blood out of the chamber.
2 Incompetence. This occurs where the valve
does not shut efﬁciently. The regurgitation of
blood is detectable as a murmur during sys-
tole of that chamber.
Cardiovascular system 101

Histology of cardiac tissue
Cardiac myocytes are long, branched, cylindrical
cells that form a network throughout the tissue.
These cells typically contain one or two nuclei,
found in the middle of the cell, and are contained
in a collagenous extracellular matrix with large
numbers of capillaries.
Cardiac cells are connected to each other by
intercalated discs, which serve as points of inser-
tion for the contractile ﬁbres; they also contain
gap junctions allowing transmission of the cardiac
action potential between cells. There is marked
heterogeneity in the cardiomyocytes; most are
adapted for contraction, although others have
more nerve-like characteristics, reﬂecting their
role in coordinating contraction.
The cardiac impulse
Although most cells in the heart function to con-
tract and expel blood, this contraction is coordi-
nated by specialised bundles of tissue running
through the heart via the propagation of a cardiac
action potential. These cells do not contribute
directly to the contractile force of the heart.
The conduction system
in the heart
In anormal sinus rhythm it takes around 200 ms for
depolarisation of the sinoatrial (SA) node to result
in contraction of the ventricles. The conduction
system is relatively complex to ensure that the
correct sequence of contractile events in the heart.
The conducting system in the heart has ﬁve
components:
1 The SA node
2 The atrial conducting pathways
3 The AV node
4 The bundle of His
5 The Purkinje system.
The sinoatrial node
This small region of tissue is located in the right
atrium close to the entry point of the superior
vena cava. The SA node has the highest rate of
depolarisation of cardiac cells with intrinsic ac-
tivity, such that it acts as a pacemaker to the rest of
the heart, triggering impulses before depolarisa-
tion occurs in other regions. Autonomic nerve
ﬁbres directly synapsing at the SA node can mod-
ulate the heart rate.
The atrial conducting pathways
Conducting pathways carry impulses generated by
the SA node across the rest of the atrial tissue at a
relatively slow pace (around 0.3 m/s). Impulses
carried by the internodal bundles of the conduct-
ing system trigger synchronous contraction of the
atrial cardiomyocytes to pump blood into the ven-
tricles; they also transmit the cardiac impulse to
the atrioventricular node.
The atrioventricular (AV) node
The cardiac impulse is carried to the AV node by
the internodal bundles in the atrium. The AV node
is found in the right atrium, close to the septum
and inferior to the coronary sinus. It has a very
slow conduction velocity, ensuring that ventric-
ular contraction occurs subsequent to the atrial
contraction. The AV node is the only site that
allows an impulse to pass from the atria to the
ventricles; the ventricles and atria are separated
by the layer of non-conductive tissue at all other
points.
The cells around the AV node form the AV junc-
tion. In the event that the SA node loses its pace-
maker activity, it is these junction cells that have
the next highest intrinsic rate of ﬁring, and take
over the pacemaker responsibility.
CLINICAL Wolff–Parkinson–White
syndrome
The Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome results from
the presence of a second set of conductive ﬁbres
linking the atria and ventricles. This can result in the
formation of a re-entry loop through which the
action potential stimulates the ventricles by travel-
ling down one of the tracts; the impulse is then
retransmitted to the atria via the other tract. The
rapid rhythm may provide insufﬁcient time for relax-
ation of the ventricles. As a result, they do not ﬁll
adequately to sustain efﬁcient function. Treatment
of the Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome is by
cardiac ablation to remove the additional con-
ducting tissue.
102
Cardiovascular system

The bundle of His
The bundle of His is the sole group of ﬁbres that
carries the cardiac action potential to the ventric-
ular myocytes. Depolarisation of the bundle of His
is regulated by the AV node, with which it is
directly connected. At its lower portions the bun-
dle of His is divided into three conducting bundles
which propagate the cardiac action potential to
the ventricles:
. The right ventricle is supplied by a single group –
the right connecting bundle.
. The left ventricle is supplied by the remaining
two bundles: the left anterior bundle supplies
the anterior and superior parts, while the left
posterior bundle supplies the posterior and in-
ferior aspects.
The Purkinje system
The large ﬁbres in the Purkinje system rapidly
conduct impulses across the ventricular tissue to
ensure even and rapid ventricular contraction. The
Purkinje ﬁbres trigger depolarisation of neigh-
bouring cardiomyocytes, allowing contraction of
the whole ventricular mass.
Measuring electrical activity
of the heart: the ECG
The electrical activity of the heart can be detected
as very small potential changes in the skin which
can be monitored by an electrocardiogram (ECG)
and can help in the diagnosis of a variety of heart
conditions. ECG recordings may be made from
three leads, by comparing the potential differences
of the leads. However, for more accurate diagnosis
a 12-lead ECG is required, where 6 leads are placed
on the chest to measure the conduction changes
across the front of the heart and 6 monitor the
changes across the other planes.
A series of distinct waves can be identiﬁed within
the ECG (Fig. 6.2):
. The P wave is triggered by depolarisation of the
atria.
. The QRS complex is triggered by depolarisation
of the ventricles.
. The T wave is the result of repolarisation of the
ventricles.
The atrial repolarisation is not detectable on the
ECG, because it is masked by the greater electrical
activity of depolarisation of the ventricles, which
occurs at the same time.
Cardiac arrhythmias
Arrhythmias are pathological disturbances in car-
diac contraction as a result of abnormal generation
or transmission of an impulse. Such arrhythmias
are detected clinically by ECG. Treatment is by
either drug therapy or cardiac ablation.
CLINICAL Cardiac ablation
When an arrhythmia results from the presence of
abnormal conducting tissue in the heart, one meth-
od of treatmentis to remove the affected conducting
tissue. This is achieved through inserting a catheter
into the heart, typically through the femoral vein, and
then destroying the conducting tract responsible for
the pathology. Typically, cardiac ablation is used to
treat the Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome or
supraventricular tachycardia; both conditions re-
sult from abnormal impulse conduction to the
ventricles.
Abnormal impulse initiation
Arrhythmias may result from abnormal initiation
in the SA node, altering the frequency of impulse
generation. Typically, these are either sinus tachy-
cardia (fast heart rate) or sinus bradycardia (slow
heart rate), whereby the elements of the ECG look
normal but the interval between impulses is
altered.
AV conduction block
A block in the transmission of impulses from the
atria to the ventricles can generate severe distur-
bances in cardiac contraction. A block at the
AV node may vary in severity and lead to uncou-
pling of the atrial and ventricular contractions.
Three classes of AV block, differing in severity, are
distinguished:
1 First-degree AV block is characterised by a
lengthened P–R interval because impulse trans-
mission is delayed
2 Second-degree
AV
block
leads
to
some
atrial contractions not being followed by ventric-
ular contraction. On the ECG, all QRS complexes
Cardiovascular system 103

will be triggered by a P wave, although not all P
waves will lead to a QRS complex.
3 Third-degree AV block occurs when atrial im-
pulses are completely inhibited from being
propagated to the ventricles. The resulting
slow ventricular rhythm is not coupled to the
atrial contraction and requires treatment by a
pacemaker.

ECG
The electrical heart on the ECG can be 
divided into three main sections:
(1) the P wave is the result of atrial 
depolarisation. (2) The large wave of 
electrical activity, the QRS complex, is 
produced by depolarisation of the 
ventricles and masks repolarisation of 
the atria. (3) The later T wave is 
triggered by the repolarisation of the 
ventricles, followed by a refractory 
period where there is little electrical 
activity.
Specific conduction problems are 
associated with typical ECG patterns.
AV block
In an atrioventricular (AV) block, 
transmission of the action potential 
between the atria and the ventricles is 
impeded, which can result in only a 
proportion of P waves being followed by 
a QRS complex. In complete AV block, 
atrial depolarisation is completely 
unable to trigger ventricular depolarisa-
tion – as such the ventricles begin to 
depolarise intrinsically at a slow rate, 
which is not coupled to atrial depolari-
sation.
Fibrillation
In fibrillation the heart is contracting in 
an uncoordinated fashion. In atrial 
fibrillation, there is sporadic triggering 
of ventricular contractions, which can 
be detected on the background of a 
‘wavy’ ECG. Ventricular fibrillation is 
observable because there is no 
discernable pattern of features to the 
electrical currents detectable. 
Figure 6.2 The electrocardiogram. The ECG detects the electrical activity of the heart, which is achieved by
comparing the potentials between two of the three leads attached to an individual. The representations are ideal
ones, because actual ECGs are often signiﬁcantly different in shape as a result of variations between individuals in
measurement, although the major electrical complexes should always be visible.
104
Cardiovascular system

CLINICAL Cardiac pacemaker
In some conditions, the ventricles may contract
ineffectively. To overcome this problem, a pace-
maker may be ﬁtted. This device triggers regular
depolarisation of the ventricular tissue, through
electrodes that are implanted into the heart muscle
at appropriate positions. The precise nature of the
pacemaker and the location of the electrodes de-
pend on the condition that is being treated.
Abnormal depolarisation
The cardiac tissue has intrinsic electrical activity.
Although the SA node usually depolarises ﬁrst to
regulate cardiac contraction, premature depolar-
isations in other regions of the heart may occur.
This happens occasionally in healthy individuals,
although it is more common in some pathologies.
Depolarisations may be initiated at any point in the
heart tissue, and is followed by a prolonged refrac-
tory pause, because the SA nodal rhythm is not
disturbed but the other tissues in the heart have yet
to recover from the previous premature impulse.
Paroxysmal tachycardia
Paroxysmal, or ectopic, tachycardias start and end
abruptly and can arise from a variety of different
mechanisms:
. Therapid spontaneous ﬁring of impulses from a
region of the heart which results in it becoming
an ‘ectopic’ pacemaker
. Repetitive cycles of a re-entry loop
. An after-potential that reaches threshold va-
lues, immediately triggering further impulses.
DEFINITION Re-entry loop
Cardiac cells are capable of transmitting impulses in
all directions, although, due to their typical pattern of
depolarisation,inactivationimpulsestravel in a single
direction from the atria to the ventricles. In some
conditions, areas of the heart conduct the impulse
more slowly, such that they are capable of triggering
other parts of the heart (which have already repo-
larised) to carry the impulse in the reverse direction,
resulting in a circuit impulse being created. This ‘re-
entry loop’ can prevent adequate regulated contrac-
tion of the heart and may proceed for a signiﬁcant
time before a correct rhythm is re-established.
Fibrillation
Fibrillations occur when the muscle undergoes
irregular contractions in either the atria or the
ventricles; this results in no effective pumping of
blood through the affected chambers:
. Atrial ﬁbrillations can be detected on the ECG as
an irregular rippling potential interspersed by
ventricular depolarisations. The ventricular de-
polarisations occur at irregular intervals as the
AV node is activated intermittently. Although not
directly life-threatening, atrial ﬁbrillation in-
creases the risk of blood clots forming and can
lead to emboli in the pulmonary or systemic
capillary beds.
. Ventricular ﬁbrillation is a serious, immediately
life-threatening condition. The ﬁbrillations pre-
vent effective pumping of blood; the rhythm
must be rapidly corrected or death will result
through
lack
of
circulation.
Treatment
is
achieved by deﬁbrillation whereby a large elec-
trical current is used to depolarise the entire
myocardium, so that the SA node reasserts its
control over the cardiac rhythm.
Antiarrhythmic drugs
The drugs used to correct arrhythmias are classi-
ﬁed into four groups (Vaughan–Williams classiﬁ-
cation) based on their mechanisms of action, and
hence the types of arrhythmias that they can treat:
1 Class I antiarrhythmics (e.g. lidocaine) reduce
the excitability of cells by blocking the voltage-
gated Na þ channels ina use-dependent fashion,
inhibiting the generation of ectopic rhythms.
The drugs inhibit high-frequency rhythms but
do not affect the heart beating at normal
frequencies.
2 Class II drugs are b blockers (e.g. propranolol);
they suppress the arrhythmic effects of adrena-
line and sympathetic activity.
3 Class III drugs (e.g. amiodarone) increase
the length of the cardiac action potential by
inhibiting K þchannels in the myocytes, slowing
repolarisation of the cell and increasing the re-
fractory period during which the cell cannot be
restimulated.
4 Class IV drugs (e.g.verapamil) block the voltage-
gated calcium channels, shortening the cardiac
action potential and reducing the force of con-
traction via the subsequently decreased calcium-
induced calcium release.
Cardiovascular system 105

Treatment of bradycardia
Some pathologies result in an abnormally slow
heart beat and require treatment by agents to
increase heart rate and, potentially, cardiac
output. Typically atropine, an antagonist of
muscarinic
acetylcholine
receptors,
is
used.
This blocks parasympathetic stimuli to the
heart, restricting suppression of the heart rate
and contraction by the autonomic nervous
system.
Cardiac contraction
Cardiac contraction is coupled to the cardiac
action potential, which spreads through the con-
ducting tissue of the heart. The nature of the
cardiac action potential varies in different re-
gions of the heart, related to whether it is involved
in the regulation of cardiac rate or in triggering
and coordinating the contraction of the cardiac
myocytes.
The cardiac action potential
Two distinct action potentials, related to their
function in conduction or contraction, can be
identiﬁed (Fig. 6.3):
. Pacemaker action potential
. Ventricular action potential.
Pacemaker action potential
Cells throughout the heart will spontaneously
depolarise, although those of the SA node do so
at the highest rate. In the SA node depolarisa-
tion of the membrane potential to a threshold
potential occurs through four main factors, the
balance of which regulates heart rate (Fig. 6.3):
1 AnactivatingdepolarisinginﬂuxofCa2 þ ions– ICa
2 An efﬂux of K þ that restricts depolarisation – IK
3 An inﬂux of Na þ ions in response to hyperpolar-
isationofthecellknownasthe‘funnycurrent’–If
4 A background inﬂux of Na þ ions – INa.
Once the threshold potential has been re-
leased, an action potential is triggered through
the opening of voltage-gated channels, and
spreads between adjacent cells through the gap
junctions. Although ICa, IK and INa are also
present in the ventricular action potential, the
If is found in only pacemaker regions, and is the
result of expression of a speciﬁc Na þ channel
that opens in response to hyperpolarisation of
the cell.
Ventricular action potential
Most cells in the heart are specialised for con-
traction and this adaptation is reﬂected in the
nature of their action potential (see Fig. 6.3).
There are four stages to the ventricular action
potential:
1 Depolarisation
2 Plateau
3 Repolarisation
4 Refractory.
The general mechanisms of an action potential
are discussed in Chapter 4.
Depolarisation
Initial depolarisation of the myocyte is the
result of depolarisation of the neighbouring
cell membrane, which triggers the activation
of the voltage-gated Na þ channels. The sodium
current (INa) is the largest current in the mus-
cle, responsible for the sharp upstroke in the
membrane
potential.
Once
depolarised,
the
Na þ
channels are rapidly inactivated until
there is repolarisation of the membrane; this
initial depolarisation triggers the brief opening
of transient outward K þ channels, resulting in
a slight repolarisation.
Plateau
The outward ﬂow of K þ is matched by an inward
ﬂow of Ca2 þ (ICa) through L-type Ca2 þ channels,
resulting in a ‘plateau’ where the ﬂow of charge is
balanced, maintaining a constant potential for
100–300 ms. The entry of Ca2 þ couples depolar-
isation of the cell to its contraction. This plateau is
also maintained by the Na þ/Ca2 þexchanger
which transports one Ca2 þ ion for three Na þ
ions; this in turn maintains charge by transport-
ing Ca2 þ out of the cell, and Na þ into it, to
balance the Ca2 þ entering the cell across the cell
membrane.
Repolarisation
The ﬁnal repolarisation of the cell results from
increased inﬂow of K þ ions (IK) and reduced
106
Cardiovascular system

Ca2 þ ﬂow due to inactivation of the L-type
calcium channels. The Ca2 þ ions in the cell are
rapidly expelled or returned to the sarcoplasmic
reticulum to end the contraction. There is addi-
tional removal of Ca2 þ across the cell mem-
brane through the Ca2 þ ATPase, and the Na þ/
Ca2 þ exchanger.
Refractory phase
After the inactivation of the channels, there is a
refractory phase, in which there are insufﬁcient
closed (not inactivated) channels to permit depo-
larisation and trigger another impulse. The result-
ing refractory period of the myocytes is relatively
long, preventing the generation of tetany in the
heart muscle.
Excitation–contraction coupling
in the heart
Contraction of the myocytes is triggered by an
increase in free Ca2 þ in the cytoplasm. The action
potential results in a small inﬂux of Ca2 þ across the
plasma membrane, although this is insufﬁcient to
allow the contraction of the myocyte. T tubules
penetrate into the cell to ensure that that action
potential is carried to the interior of the cell, par-
ticularly to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The
Ca2 þ that enters across the cell membrane triggers
the release of large amounts of Ca2 þ from the SR,
an internal store of calcium, through activation
of ryanodine receptors. This process is termed
calcium-induced calcium release. The mechan-
isms relating increased Ca2 þ levels to contraction

SA potential
The depolarisation of the SA node occurs 
gradually, driven in particular by the outward 
flow of K+ ions and the inward Ca2+ current, and 
the ‘funny’ Na+ current, which is triggered by 
hyperpolarisation. On reaching a threshold 
potential, rapid depolarisation of the cell occurs 
(a) triggering an action potential that is 
propagated around the rest of the heart. After 
inactivation of the voltage-gated channels, 
repolarisation occurs and leads to the gradual 
depolarisation once again.
Altering the slope of the initial depolarisation by 
altering the rate of flow of ions across the cell 
membrane.  This can lead to an increased or 
decreased slope, resulting in shorter (red) or 
longer (blue) intervals between action 
potentials, respectively.
Ventricular action potential
The resting potential within a ventricular myocyte 
is maintained at a constant voltage, and the 
propagation of an action potential from the 
conducting fibres of the heart triggers the rapid 
depolarisation by opening of the voltage-gated 
Na+ cells (1).
Closure and inactivation of the Na+ channels is 
followed by a slight repolarisation as K+ outflow 
is also reduced (2). The long plateau phase of 
the action potential (3) is the result of the influx 
of Ca2+ ions through L-type Ca2+ channels being 
balanced by the outward flow of K+. It is this 
influx of Ca2+ that is responsible for calcium-
induced calcium release. 
Eventually, the plateau phase ceases, as the 
Ca2+ flow is decreased, and this results in 
repolarisation (4) of the cell followed by a 
refractory period where the cell cannot be 
restimulated because the voltage-gated 
channels have yet to recover from inactivation.

are very similar in skeletal and cardiac muscle and
are covered in detail in Chapter 4.
Physiological modulation
of cardiac contraction
The heart is regulated by the autonomic nervous
system and hormones.
The sympathetic response
The sympathetic innervation is derived from the
cervical and superior thoracic ganglia. There are
various effects caused by sympathetic stimulation
of the heart:
. Increased heart rate through effects on the SA
node
. Increased contractile force through actions on
the cardiac myocardium
. Dilatation of the coronary arteries to increase
blood supply to the heart muscle.
Sympathetic stimulation of the SA node
Noradrenaline release by sympathetic nerve ﬁ-
bres acts on the b1-adrenoceptors on the mem-
branes of SA nodal cells. These G-protein-coupled
receptors activate adenylyl cyclase production
and, in turn, increase the Ca2 þ current into the
cell to potentiate its depolarisation. Adrenaline
released from the adrenal gland may also act to
increase the heart rate by increasing both ICa
and If.
Sympathetic stimulation of the contractile
tissue
The release of noradrenaline from the sympathetic
nerves supplying the heart, as well as from circu-
lating
adrenaline,
can
modulate
contraction.
These hormones act on the b2-adrenoceptors,
increasing Ca2 þ inﬂux across the cell membrane
and a corresponding increase in release of Ca2 þ
from the SR. In addition, the Ca2 þ ATPase pro-
teins on the SR are upregulated, triggering great-
er uptake of calcium from the cytoplasm, and
allowing greater release in subsequent heart
beats.
The parasympathetic response
The parasympathetic innervation of the heart is
derived from vagus nerve ﬁbres, which act on
the SA and AV nodes and on the coronary
circulation. Parasympathetic stimulation of the
heart causes:
. a decreased rate of cardiac contraction
. a decreased force of contraction.
Parasympathetic effects on the SA node
The activation of muscarinic M2-receptors on the
SA nodal cells by the release of acetylcholine
(ACh) causes a decrease in the pacemaker cur-
rent; this happens via decreasing Ca2 þ inﬂux
because of the inhibition of cAMP production by
adenylyl cyclase. There is a direct action on a
ligand-gated
K þ
channel
which
causes
cell
hyperpolarisation.
Parasympathetic effects on the contractile
tissue
The released ACh binds to M2-receptors and re-
duces the inﬂux of Ca2 þ, thus reducing calcium-
induced calcium release, and hence the length and
force of the cardiac contraction.
Sensory innervation of the heart
Sensory innervation of the heart is provided
by nerve ﬁbres originating in the upper four
thoracic nerves. Damage to the heart leads to
referred pain to the left arm, neck and chest –
the sites in the skin innervated by the same
nerve roots.
Cardiac mechanics
Coupling of the cardiac action potential to con-
traction triggers a build-up of pressure in the
chambers of the heart, so that it expels blood into
the arteries. This process forms a cycle of ﬁlling
and relaxation that must be regulated to ensure
that the demands of the tissue are met and that
both sides of the heart adequately match their
output.
The cardiac contractile cycle
The mechanical events in cardiac contraction are
made up of four stages:
1 Atrial contraction
2 Ventricular contraction
3 Ventricular ﬁlling
4 Diastasis.
108
Cardiovascular system

Atrial contraction
Atrial contraction aids the movement of blood into
the ventricles. At rest, ﬂow into the ventricles
occurs passively with little contribution from atrial
contraction. However, as heart rate increases, the
period for ventricular ﬁlling decreases and atrial
contraction becomes essential to ensure adequate
ﬁlling. Atrial contraction produces pressure waves
that can be detected in the jugular venous pulse,
and may also be detectable as a fourth heart sound.
Ventricular contraction
During ventricular contraction, pressure in the
ventricles increases until it opens the outlet valves
and ejects blood into the circulation. This process
occurs in three phases:
1 Isovolumetric contraction. There is an in-
crease inthe pressure in the ventricular chamber
without a change in its volume
2 Ejection of blood from the ventricle into the
corresponding great vessel
3 Isovolumetricrelaxation. Thereisadecreasein
the pressure in the ventricular chamber without
a change in its volume.
Isovolumetric contraction
The initial phase of ventricular contraction results
in the increasing pressure of blood forcing the AV
valves closed. The closure of the AV valves causes
the ﬁrst heart sound and the ‘c’ pressure wave
within the jugular venous pulse. After closure of
the valves, the ventricles continue to contract, in-
creasing the pressure in the chamber without any
change in the volume. The isovolumetric phase
ceases when the pressure in the ventricle exceeds
that of the aorta, or pulmonary arteries, at which
point the corresponding valves are forced open.
Ventricular ejection
Initially, blood is expelled faster than can be ac-
cepted by the arteries and, as a consequence, the
vessels become distended. At rest, the ventricular
ejection phase lasts around 300 ms, most (75%) of
the blood volume being expelled in the ﬁrst 150 ms,
allowing efﬁcient expulsion at higher heart rates
when the interval decreases. Ventricular ejection
ends when the pressure of the ventricles falls to
below that of the corresponding artery. At this point,
the backﬂow of blood closes the semilunar valves,
which is detectable as the second heart sound.
Ventricular isovolumetric relaxation
Once the aortic and semilunar valves have closed,
the ventricles relax and the pressure falls without a
change in volume, until the pressure is exceeded by
that within the atria.
Ventricular ﬁlling
The AV valves have a large diameter to allow rapid
ﬁlling from the atria and veins. Most of the blood
ﬂow occurs early in the phase to allow shortening
of the ﬁlling interval during exercise.
Ventricular ﬁlling reduces the volume of blood
stored within the reservoirs of the great veins, and
the resulting decrease in pressure can be detected
as the ‘y’ wave in the jugular venous pulse.
Diastole
This phase is where the heart is relatively inactive.
The atria and the large veins ﬁll with peripheral
blood, although there is little electrical activity in
the heart. Diastole accounts for the reserve time,
which can be reduced as the heart rate increases
without compromising the heart’s function. Dias-
tole ends with the P wave of the ECG, when atrial
contraction occurs.
Regulation of stroke volume
of the heart
The stroke volume of the heart is regulated by two
factors:
1 The metabolic needs of the body
2 The stroke volume of the other ventricle.
The stroke volume of one ventricle in relation to
its counterpart is regulated by the Frank–Starling
mechanism.
The Frank-Starling mechanism
in the heart
It is essential that the cardiac output of both sides
of the heart be matched, otherwise there will be a
build-up of ﬂuid immediately in one side of the
heart – as seen in heart failure. If the ﬁlling of a
ventricle is increased, it results in greater con-
traction to clear the additional ﬂuid. This process
appears to contradict La Place’s law, because the
enlarged ventricle would be expected to be less
efﬁcient and thus expel a smaller volume of
blood.
Cardiovascular system 109

This process results from the force generated
during contraction and is proportional to the initial
length of the sarcomere before contraction. The
ideal length of a sarcomere for optimal contraction
is around 2.2 mm; either side of this length, the force
generated in contraction is decreased. This rela-
tionship applies for both cardiac and skeletal mus-
cles, although in the heart there is rarely stretching
of the sarcomeres beyond this point.
The Frank–Starling mechanism is apparent in
cases when premature ventricular ejection occurs –
as a result of early contraction, a smaller than
normal volume of blood is expelled. Consequently
a larger volume of blood ﬁlls the left ventricle – the
Frank–Starling mechanism results in the following
contraction being larger, returning the end-systolic
volume of the ventricle to normal.
Functional values of
cardiovascular performance
A series of normal values can be used to assess the
function of the heart. In particular, the amount of
ﬂuid expelled by the (left side of the) heart in a
given time – the cardiac output – provides a mea-
sure of the function of the heart and the strain that
it may be under.
The cardiac output
Cardiac output (CO) is deﬁned as:
Left ventricular stroke volume ðmLÞ
 heart rate ðbeats=minÞ ¼ Cardiac output ðmL=minÞ:
At rest, the cardiac output is around 5 L/min.
During exercise the increased metabolic demands
of the skeletal muscle result in an increase in both
the stroke volume and the heart rate, and can allow
the cardiac output to reach up to around 20 L/min.
Stroke volume
The stroke volume is the total amount of blood
expelled from the ventricles in a single contraction
and is determined by two opposing factors:
1 The contractile force generated by the myocar-
dial cells
2 The arterial pressure against which the blood is
expelled.
Not all the blood is expelled from the ventricles in
a single stroke; the end-systolic volume is retained
and can be used as a reserve to expel further blood
when increased cardiac output is required.
Assessment of the central venous
pressure
If a patient sits back and relaxes their neck, it is
possible to view the point at which the external
jugular vein collapses; the vertical height between
this point and the atria (estimated as 5 cm below
the manubrium of the sternum) gives an indication
of the central venous pressure (CVP).
In heart failure, the accumulation of ﬂuid behind
the affected ventricle can result in an increase in
the CVP. In right heart failure the accumulation of
ﬂuid will be reﬂected in the systemic circulation.
Afﬂicted individuals are likely to have a CVP that
can be viewed when they are upright. In normal
individuals, the point of collapse of the jugular
veins is usually occluded by the clavicle.
The jugular pulse
The pressure waves generated by the contraction
of the atria and closure of the AV valves are re-
ﬂected as pressure waves in the large veins. The
emptying of the veins to ﬁll the atria and ventricles
also results in pressure changes in the veins.
Assessment of the jugular pulse can provide an
indication of pathologies of the heart (Fig. 6.4).
Heart sounds
Four heart sounds may be detected; these reﬂect
the closing of valves and the movement of blood. In
normal individuals only the ﬁrst and second heart
sounds may be detected. The detection of the third
and fourth heart sounds, as well as changes in
quality of all the heart sounds, may be indicative
of pathology:
1 The ﬁrst heart sound is the result of closure of
the mitral and tricuspid valves.
2 The second heart sound results from closure of
the aortic and pulmonary valves. It is often a
‘split’ sound due to earlier closure of the aortic
than the pulmonary valve.
3 The third heart sound is caused by the movement
of blood from the atria to the ventricles during
relaxation. It is commonly heard in young people,
although it is of low frequency and relatively
difﬁculttodetect. Inolderpeopleitispathological
and may reﬂect a degree of heart failure.
4 The fourth heart sound just precedes the ﬁrst
heart sound and results from contraction of
the atria. The fourth heart sound is always
pathological.

Cardiovascular system

Functional anatomy of
circulation
The circulatory systems carry blood from the heart
to the tissues and lungs, where gas exchange oc-
curs. The vasculature shares a common design,
although this varies depending on the role of the
vessels. Arteries must be strong and muscular to
support the high pressure of the blood, whereas
capillaries are thin to allow efﬁcient diffusion.
Veins are distensible to accommodate varying
volumes.
There is insufﬁcient blood volume, or cardiac
output, to maximally perfuse every capillary bed.
Instead, the ﬂow of blood is regulated to best
serve the needs of the body at the time. During
exercise, the skeletal muscle beds are highly
perfused to supply the respiring tissue with the
oxygen and nutrients that it needs, whereas at
rest the ﬂow to the muscle beds is low and that to
the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys much
higher.

‘a’ wave
The peak pressure 
in the ‘a’ wave 
results from the 
contraction of the 
right atrium to 
expel blood into 
the right ventricle.
‘c’ wave
The contraction of 
the right ventricle 
forces the closed 
atrioventricular 
(AV) valve back, 
generating a brief 
increase in 
pressure.
‘x’ wave
The x wave is the 
lowest pressure 
in the jugular 
venous pulse, 
and occurs 
during ventricular 
contraction. Here 
the change in the 
heart draws 
blood into the 
atrium, with the 
AV valve 
remaining closed.
‘v’ wave
The pressure 
gradually rises in 
the veins as the 
atrium begins to 
fill. The ‘v’ wave 
represents the 
maximum 
pressure in the 
atrium, before 
the AV valve 
opens. This is 
accompanied by 
a transient drop 
in venous 
pressure as 
blood rushes into 
the ventricle.
‘y’ wave
The filling of the 
ventricle after the 
opening of the 
AV valve leads to 
a decrease in 
pressure. The 
pressure 
subsequently 
increases 
because the rate 
of atrial filling 
exceeds the rate 
at which blood 
leaves the atrium 
to enter the 
ventricle.

heart are reﬂected backwards in the venous blood. These changes are seen as a series of peaks in the venous
pressure and can be related to the function of the right side of the heart.

Structure of blood vessels
The
blood
vessels
share
a
similar
common
structure of three functional layers:
1 Tunicaintima. Asingle layerofendothelial cells
on a basement membrane
2 Tunic media. Themiddle layer characterised by
layers of smooth muscle
3 Tunica adventitia. The outermost layer, which
is continuous with surrounding connective
tissue.
There are three distinct types of blood vessels,
each with a different function:
1 Arteries are thick muscular vessels that carry
blood from the heart and regulate the distribu-
tion of blood to the capillaries. They have devel-
oped media to tolerate the high pressures gen-
erated by the heart.
2 Capillary vessels are very small, thin-walled
vessels. The intimal layer is the only layer found
in capillary vessels – reﬂecting the need for rapid
diffusion.
3 The veins receive blood from the capillaries and
return it to the heart. These vessels lack a pro-
nounced muscle layer because the blood is un-
der low pressure, and they are highly distensible
to accommodate changes in blood ﬂow.
Arteries
Arteries serve the dual function of tolerating the
high pressure of blood within the vessels and
regulating the distribution of blood to the different
capillary beds through muscular contraction. Two
forms of vessel can be distinguished which vary in
the constitution of the vessel walls; this is related to
the stress tow which the vessel must be subjected
and the function that it performs:
. Elastic arteries
. Muscular arteries.
Elastic arteries
Elastic arteries are the largest arteries in the body,
carrying blood at high pressure and ﬂow rates:
. There is a prominent layer of connective tissue
rich in elastin between the intimal and medial
layers of the vessel walls, allowing accommoda-
tion of large pressure changes.
. The elastic arteries are extremely large and
possess their own blood vessels to supply their
tissue – the vasa vasorum.
Muscular arteries
Muscular arteries are the vessels of larger distri-
bution. The vessel walls are well innervated and
have a highly developed muscular layer to modu-
late blood ﬂow, so that the blood can be appropri-
ately distributed as demand requires:
. The smooth muscle in the tunica media is ar-
ranged in a series of concentric layers for signif-
icant contraction and restriction of blood ﬂow.
. The tunica adventitia is made up of predomi-
nantly collagen and elastin, allowing contraction
to limit the ﬂow.
Arterioles
Arterioles are the major resistance vessels in the
vasculature; theycontrol blood ﬂow into individual
tissue beds through precapillary sphincters. The
arterioles have other features in common:
. The tunica intima consists of endothelial cells
and a very thin elastic lamina.
. The tunica media consists of a few rings of
concentric smooth muscle to allow further reg-
ulation of blood ﬂow to individual capillary beds.
. The tunica adventitia merges with surrounding
connective tissue and is of a similar thickness to
the media.
Capillaries
The capillaries are the major site of exchange of
substances across the endothelium and are made
up of three layers:
1 The endothelium
2 The basement membrane
3 The pericytes are that surround the intima and
can regulate both blood ﬂow and vessel growth.
They are also stem cells for endothelial cells.
Veins
Veins accept blood from the capillaries, carrying it
back to the heart:
. Small venules drain the capillary beds. These
vessels possess a limited tunica media and carry
the blood through progressively larger vessels as
it goes back to the heart. The venules around the
lymph node are distinct; these high endothelial
venules are the site of migration of lymphocytes
from the blood into the lymph nodes.
. Veins accept blood from the venules and possess
a thicker muscular wall to accommodate the
112
Cardiovascular system

larger volume of blood. The veins have a poorly
developed elastic lamina and the tunica adven-
titia is continuous with the surrounding connec-
tive tissue.
Special circulations
Some sites in the body require other circulatory
arrangements:
. Arteriovenous shunts are direct connections
between the arterial and venous systems, allow-
ing the bypass of an intervening capillary bed. By
opening a shunt vessel, blood bypasses the cap-
illary bed. Such shunts are common in the skin,
where they are important for thermoregulation.
. Portal systems involve a series of vessels that
connect two capillary beds together. The hepatic
portal system is particularly prominent; here
blood from the capillary beds in the intestinal
tract drains into the tributaries of the hepatic
portal vein, which transport the nutrient-rich
blood to the liver for processing. Portal blood is
transported to the sinusoids of the liver and from
there enters the hepatic veins, via which it re-
turns to the main circulation.
Endothelium: regulation
of the vasculature
Endothelial cells line the lumen of every blood
vessel. There are four broad functions to which
the endothelium contributes:
1 It acts as a barrier regulating exchange across the
vessel wall
2 It regulates haemostasis
3 It regulates vascular tone
4 It regulates angiogenesis.
Endothelium as a barrier regulating
exchange
Three classes of endothelial arrangement found in
capillaries have been deﬁned, related to the
‘leakiness’ of the vessels (Table 6.1):
. Continuous endothelium
. Fenestrated endothelium
. Discontinuous endothelium (sinusoids).
Transport across the endothelium
Transport across endothelium can occur by a va-
riety of routes:
. Passive diffusion of small non-polar molecules
occurs across the endothelium down their con-
centration gradient.
. Carrier-mediated transport may be through fa-
cilitated diffusion or by active transport.
. Pinocytosis is used to transport larger molecules
such as proteins.
. White blood cells are able to travel between the
endothelial cells (diapedesis) to leave capillary
vessels.
. Paracellular transport can occur between the
endothelial cells, down a concentration gradient.

regulated, although it does not have
the high energy costs

underlying cells (e.g. liver)
Endothelial cells are discontinuous
and lack a basement membrane
Cardiovascular system 113

The relative contribution of the paracellular
route is governed by the ‘leakiness’ of the tight
junctions that join the endothelial cells.
The endothelium in haemostasis
The endothelial cells are perfectly placed to detect
changes in blood ﬂow and damage to the vessel.
They can secrete and express molecules that may
be anti- or procoagulant, especially in response to
tissue damage.
Endothelium as a regulator
of vascular tone
Vascular tone is regulated by molecules and neural
signals. The endothelium is responsible for the
production of various substances that modulate
contraction, including:
. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas produced by nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) in the endothelium in
response to parasympathetic nervous stimula-
tion. NO diffuses to smooth muscle cells where it
causes relaxation through its activation of the
cGMP signalling cascade.
. Endothelin triggers long-term vasoconstriction
and is released by the endothelial cells.
. Angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, is con-
verted from angiotensin I by the angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) expressed on the en-
dothelial surface. In addition, ACE inactivates
several vasodilators, in particular bradykinin.
Blood
Blood is made up of four components, each with a
distinct role:
1 Red blood cells
2 White blood cells
3 Platelets
4 Plasma.
All blood cells are derived from haematopoietic
stem cells, which are found in different locations at
different ages:
. In the fetus, haematopoiesis occurs initially in
the yolk sac in the ﬁrst 8 weeks, and then pro-
gresses to the liver and spleen.
. By birth and during infancy, the major site of
haematopoiesis is the bone marrow (which is
found in almost every long bone).
. In adults, the sites at which bone marrow is
found are more restricted, primarily the ribs,
sternum, pelvis and more proximal parts of the
femur.
A single haematopoietic stem cell gives rise to
the cellular components of blood; however, two
major progenitor cells –both derived from the stem
cells – can be identiﬁed:
. The lymphoid progenitor cell generates lympho-
cytes – discussed in Chapter 15.
. The myeloid progenitor cell gives rise to all the
other cellular components of the blood.
Red blood cells
Red blood cells are enucleated cells responsible
for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the re-
spiring tissues. They contain large amounts
of the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin,
CLINICAL Anaemia
Anaemia is a defect in the oxygen-carrying capacity
of the blood, as a result of low haemoglobin. The
chief symptoms of anaemia are persistent tiredness
and pallor. In more severe cases, shortness of
breath on exertion may be noticeable, as well as
palpitations and sweating caused by the extra strain
put on the heart to maintain adequate oxygenation
of tissues. There can be many different causes of
anaemia, each of which may require a different
treatment:
. Inadequate production ofhaemoglobin, typical-
ly due to a lack of iron, is the most common
form of anaemia. This causes a microcytic anae-
mia, where the red blood cells are smaller than
usual.
. Anaemia can result through overall loss of hae-
moglobin, without changes in the red blood cells
(normocytic anaemia); this is often due to severe
chronic blood loss or excessive destruction of red
blood cells.
. In some cases, there may be defects in the
production of haemoglobin or of the red
blood cells themselves. This is particularly
apparent in pernicious anaemia, where there
is a deﬁciency in vitamin B12, which is essential
for DNA synthesis, and therefore impaired pro-
duction of the numerous precursor cells of
mature red blood cells.
114
Cardiovascular system

and make up around 45% of the blood volume.
These cells are biconcave ﬂattened discs, shaped
to generate a large surface area to allow rapid
diffusion, while maintaining high volume.
Red blood cells have a typical lifespan of 120
days and are found in the blood at a concentration
of approximately 7  107 cells/mL. Maintenance
of enough red blood cells is essential to maintain
effective oxygen transport around the body.
Shortage of haemoglobin, is referred to as anae-
mia, and may have many different underlying
causes.
Generation of red blood cells
(erythropoiesis)
Red blood cells (erythrocytes) form by erythro-
poiesis. Burst-forming units derived from the
myeloid progenitor cells differentiate through
three stages to develop into mature red blood
cells.
1 Normoblasts are the nucleated precursors of red
blood cells in the bone. The presence of normo-
blasts in the blood is abnormal.
2 Reticulocytes are the direct precursors of ma-
ture red blood cells. These cells lack a nucleus
although they possess large amounts of RNA, to
allow translation as the cells mature. These
cells are released into the blood, where they
account for around 1% of the circulating red
blood cells.
3 Erythrocytes are the mature red blood cells.
They possess no nucleus or RNA, and have
a short lifespan as a result. With no mito-
chondria,
energy
required
for
biological
processes is achieved solely by glycolysis,
making the cells dependent on glucose for
ATP generation.
Regulation of erythropoiesis
The major regulator of erythropoiesis is the hor-
mone erythropoietin (EPO), which is released by
the kidneys in response to low oxygen tension in
the blood. EPO triggers increased division of pro-
genitor cells, resulting in the production of more
erythrocytes. Dysregulation of EPO secretion
can result in overproduction of red blood cells
(polycythaemia).
CLINICAL Polycythaemia
Polycythaemia is a clinical condition in which there is
overproduction of red blood cells. Although some-
times symptomless, polycythaemia may present with
a generalised itching and classically, although rarely,
with burning pains in the limbs accompanied by
discoloration of the skin (erythromelagia).
The underlying cause of polycythaemia may vary:
. Primary causes are usually due to abnormal pro-
cesses in the bone marrow.
. Secondary causes are usually due to chronic low
oxygen or an EPO-secreting tumour.
Individuals with polycythaemia are at risk of in-
creased thrombosis:
. Treatment of primary polycythaemia focuses on
reducing the risk of clotting, such as through the
administration of aspirin or through removing the
excess blood cells via blood letting.
. Secondary polycythaemia is usually corrected
by treating the underlying pathology.
White blood cells
White blood cells make up the cellular part of the
immune system; their role and generation are
discussed in Chapter 15.
Platelets
Platelets are cell fragments around 2–3 mm in
size. They express many surface proteins and
receptors and regulating the clotting process.
Platelets are formed from the megakaryocyte
fragments. There are usually around 2.5  108
platelets/mL and they typically have a lifespan
of 7–10 days. Platelets carry numerous granules
containing a variety of factors associated with
their function:
. Alpha granules contain many mediators of
blood clotting (e.g. ﬁbrinogen and thrombos-
pondin), and are released on platelet activation.
. Dense bodies are electron dense when viewed
by an electron microscope, and are fewer in
number than the alpha granules. They contain
ATP, ADP and serotonin, all of which are im-
portant mediators released by platelets during
activation.
. Lyosomes.
Cardiovascular system 115

Generation of platelets
The megakaryocytes differentiate from the mye-
loid progenitor cells and go through nuclear rep-
lication, although with no cytoplasmic cleavage.
During this process the volume of the cytoplasm
increases markedly. The resulting cell may have
gone through several rounds of nuclear division,
having up to 32 times the normal copies of the
genome (64n). As the megakaryocyte matures, its
cytoplasm becomes more granular, and then frag-
ments to release many platelets into the blood. A
single cell may give rise to around 4000 platelets.
CLINICAL Thrombocytopenia
A reduced number of platelets can result in clotting
defects, and is associated with rapid bleeding and
bruising. The method of treatment varies with the
underlying cause of the condition, although in se-
vere cases transfusion of platelets may be used to
boost the circulating numbers.
Plasma
Plasma is the ﬂuid and medium that carries the
other components of the blood. It contains many
components involved in regulating and powering
cellular processes. Many ions also regulate pH
buffering of the blood. The protein components
are predominantly produced by the liver and per-
form many functions:
. Proteins, such as albumin, regulate the oncotic
pressure of the blood, regulating the ﬂuid volume
of the body’s compartments.
. Carrier proteins allow transport of ions or hor-
mones around the body in a more stable form, so
that they do not come out of solution or get
excreted inappropriately.
. Protein cascade precursors (e.g.complement and
blood clotting) are often contained in the plasma.
. Antibodies are found in the blood to protect
against pathogens.
. Hormones allow the regulation of the function of
widespread, dispersed tissues.
Haemodynamics
Haemodynamics refers to the movement of blood
through the vessels. The body must regulate the
distribution and ﬂow rate of the blood to ensure
that the needs of different tissues are met. Further-
more, the nature of the ﬂow can be determined by
the vessels and the properties of the blood, and by
the forces exerted.
Distribution of blood within
the systemic circulation
Typically the veins in the body act as a reservoir for
blood volume; they can undergo a large change in
volume relatively easily. The standard distribution
between the vessels is:
. about 20% in the arteries
. 5% in the capillaries
. 75% in the veins.
There is typically around 5 litres of blood in an
individual, although this varies with body size. The
total blood volume is insufﬁcient to maximally
perfuse all the capillary beds at the same time;
instead the arterioles supplying the capillary bed
are maintained at varying degrees of vasoconstric-
tion to provide an adequate balance of the perfu-
sion of the capillary beds so that the needs of the
respiring tissue are met but do not exceed the
limited blood volume.
The process of vasoconstriction relies on the
contributions of the smooth muscles and elastic
connective tissue in the arteriole walls. The factors
that regulate peripheral blood ﬂow through caus-
ing alterations in vessel tone are in three groups:
1 Local factors produced in response to the met-
abolic needs of the tissue itself
2 Extrinsic factors resulting from the regulation of
blood ﬂow to the different organ beds, ensuring
that demand does not exceed cardiac output
3 Global homoeostatic regulation of other sys-
tems, such as temperature, may require altera-
tions in the blood ﬂow that conﬂict with other
factors. This regulation may override the needs
of individual capillaries.
Local factors
Despite changes in the amount of blood passing
through it, constriction of the arterioles in the
vascular bed maintains a constant perfusion
pressure over a wide range of systemic blood
pressure. This process is called autoregulation
and is most prominent in the vascular beds
where the tone is not vastly altered by neural
signals (e.g. the brain).
116
Cardiovascular system

There are various local factors that regulate pe-
ripheral blood ﬂow. These are mainly vasodilatory
agents which are produced in response to inade-
quate capillary perfusion:
. Myogenic effects result from changes in the trans-
mural pressure (the pressure difference across the
wall of the blood vessel). To prevent the vessel
walls expanding, the vessels oppose any increase
in transmural pressure by further constriction.
. Local metabolites (e.g. adenosine) promote vas-
cular relaxation to increase perfusion which
washes them from the tissue.
. Endothelial factors are produced in response to
changes in the tissue (e.g. acute inﬂammation) or
to circulating hormones.
Extrinsic regulation of peripheral
blood ﬂow
Extrinsic mechanisms acting via the autonomic
nervous system promote control of blood ﬂow, and
function through three sets of autonomic ﬁbres:
. Sympathetic vasodilator ﬁbres
. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor ﬁbres
. Parasympathetic vasodilator ﬁbres.
Neural control dominates in capillary beds, which
tolerate ischaemia and have vastly variable meta-
bolic requirements, depending on tissue activity,
e.g. skeletal muscle. Tissue beds that do not tolerate
ischaemia, e.g. the heart and brain, are predomi-
nantly regulated by intrinsic mechanisms to ensure
adequate perfusion at all times.
Hormones may modulate vascular resistance.
Within skeletal muscle, adrenaline acts via the b1-
adrenoceptors to trigger vasodilatation, in readiness
for anticipated physical activity. At high concentra-
tions, adrenaline may also act on a1-adrenoceptors
in vascular beds that supply tissues not required
for physical activity. The action of adrenaline on
a1-adrenoceptors triggers vasoconstriction.
Regional circulation
If all tissues were to receive sufﬁcient blood to
operate at maximal capacity, the oxygenated blood
required would be vastly greater than the maxi-
mum pumping capacity of the heart. Control sys-
tems are in place to ensure that the needs of
different tissues are met as far as possible.
Starling's forces
Fluid travels from the capillaries into the intersti-
tial tissue as a result of bulk ﬂow. The rate of ﬂow
into the tissues is far higher than can happen by
diffusion alone, and results from differences in the
osmotic and hydrostatic pressures between the
capillaries and tissue. The net transfer of ﬂuid
between the body compartments is governed by
Starling’s forces.
Four factors contribute to Starling’s forces:
. Oncotic pressure of the blood
. Oncotic pressure of the tissue
. Hydrostatic pressure of the blood
. Hydrostatic pressure of the tissue.
The blood pressure within the capillaries forces
large volumes of ﬂuid out of them. In contrast, the
hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial spaces is
very low and is counteracted by the oncotic pres-
sure of the blood, which is maintained by the
presence of proteins within the ﬂuid. In the blood,
the oncotic pressure is high, because plasma
proteins are too large to be forced out of the
fenestrations in the endothelial cells. This high
concentration of proteins contributes a pressure
equivalent to around 25 mmHg.
The balance of forces results in a small net
volume of ﬂuid entering the tissues. This tissue
ﬂuid enters the lymphatic system and is eventually
returned to the blood.
DEFINITION Oncotic pressure
Oncotic pressure is generated by proteins in the
ﬂuid. Although small ions will be easily ﬁltered out of
blood vessels, proteinsare retainedinthe blood. The
proteins increase the osmolality of the compartment,
drawing ﬂuid into it to equalise the osmotic gradient.
CLINICAL Oedema
When the balance of Starling’s forces is affected,
the rate at which ﬂuid enters the tissue may in-
crease; this can cause loss of function within the
tissue. This oedema can be caused by a variety of
different factors:
. Increase in the hydrostatic pressure of blood
. Decreased concentration of plasma proteins,
leading to a lower blood oncotic pressure
. Increased permeability of capillaries
. Increased extracellular ﬂuid volumes
. Blockage of lymphatic vessels, preventing drain-
age of tissue ﬂuid.
Cardiovascular system 117

Blood pressure
Blood pressure is given as two values: the systolic
blood pressure is the highest arterial pressure, and
is reached during ejection of blood from the heart.
The diastolic blood pressure is the lowest arterial
blood pressure, and is reached immediately before
the next ejection phase starts in the heart. The
effects and regulation of blood pressure are dis-
cussed in Chapter 11.
The difference between the systolic and diastolic
blood pressures is referred to as the pulse pres-
sure; the pressure wave associated with the
changes in blood pressure during the heart beat
can be felt at points on the body’s surface that lie
close to major arteries. The characteristics of the
pulse wave can reﬂect the characteristics of dis-
tension of the aorta and the proﬁle of ejection of
blood from the heart.
Mean arterial pressure
Much of the time the blood pressure is far closer to
the diastolic value than to the systolic value. A
true average can be determined by dividing the
area under the pulse pressure wave proﬁle by
the number of heart beats, although in practice
the diastolic pressure þ a third of the pulse
pressure provides a good estimate. Using ideal
values, the mean arterial pressure can be calcu-
lated as around 93 mmHg.
Total peripheral resistance
As blood must be pushed through a series of
branching tubes, there is signiﬁcant resistance to
the ﬂow of blood. Over the entire systemic circu-
lation this resistance is referred to as total periph-
eral resistance (TPR):
TPR ¼ ðMean aortic pressure  Mean right atrial
pressureÞ=Cardiac output:
However, for most purposes this right atrial
pressure is negligible, so this can be simpliﬁed to:
TPR ¼ Blood pressure=Cardiac output:
The main sites of such resistance are the arter-
ioles which regulate the ﬂow of blood into speciﬁc
capillary beds. For a given cardiac output to be
sustained, the greater the TPR, the higher the blood
pressure that must be reached.
Haemostasis and vascular
pathologies
Haemostasis is the series of physiological changes
that prevent blood loss as a result of injury to blood
vessels. Blood loss is limited by formation of a clot,
although this clot must eventually be removed to
allow tissue repair. There are four mechanisms that
contribute to haemostasis:
1 Vasospasm
2 Endothelial changes
3 Platelet activation
4 Coagulation of blood.
Vasospasm
Vasospasm is the contraction of arterial vessels due
to the actions of the vascular smooth muscle. Ini-
tially, injury to the vessel and tissue triggers constric-
tion,whichissubsequentlymaintainedbythefactors
produced by the platelets to reduce blood loss.
Endothelial changes
Damage to a blood vessel will result in loss of or
damage to the endothelial lining, which triggers
several regulatory changes:
. Loss of endothelium exposes the basement
membrane of the vessel to blood. This exposed
surface can recruit platelets and promote blood
clotting, because it is negatively charged, stim-
ulating the intrinsic pathway.
. Activation of endothelium can cause the upregu-
lation and expression of various proinﬂammatory
molecules on the surface. The von Willebrand
factor (vWF) can bind platelets, whereas tissue
factor activates the extrinsic pathway of blood
coagulation.
CLINICAL The Von Willebrand factor
This factor is a glycoprotein produced by the en-
dothelial cells, and stored in Weibel–Palade bodies
until activation. It is also found in platelets and the
subendothelial space. The vWF binds factor VIII to
stabilise it, bind the glycoprotein Ib, recruit platelets
and promote their aggregation. It can also bind
collagen to promote clotting at sites where the
endothelium has been disrupted, exposing the un-
derlying basement membrane.
118
Cardiovascular system

CLINICAL Von Willebrand disease
Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common
genetic clotting diseases. It results from a defect in
vWF. The severity of the disease is related to the
speciﬁcmutationorproductionofautoantibodies.In
mild cases of the disease individuals bruise easily,
and may suffer from heavy blood loss during men-
struation. In more severe forms of the disease there
is no detectable vWF, resulting in severe internal
bleeding, particularly at the joints.
In severe cases of von Willebrand disease, factor
VIII is administered as a long-term treatment.
Platelet activation
Platelets contribute to haemostasis through many
different mechanisms:
. Adherence to damaged endothelial cells and sub-
endothelial tissues by binding to collagen and vWF
. Activation of platelets triggers release of gran-
ules; both ﬁbrinogen and ADP are released and
cyclooxygenase-2
is
activated
to
synthesise
thromboxane A2 (TxA2)
. Aggregation of platelets to form a ‘plug’: this in-
teraction is the result of glycoprotein IIb and IIIa,
expressed on the surface of platelets, binding to
ﬁbrinogen to stabilise the aggregation of platelets.
Blood clotting
The end-stage of clotting is the formation of a mesh
of ﬁbrin by the cleavage and binding of many ﬁbrin-
ogen monomers (Fig. 6.5). Commonly blood factors
are referred to by a number (e.g. factor VII) and if
activated are denoted by an ‘a’ (e.g. factor VIIa). The
coagulation cascade can be divided into three parts:
. The extrinsic pathway is the main trigger of
blood clotting. It is initiated by the release of
tissue factor, which cleaves factor VII to VIIa.
Widespread activation of the extrinsic pathway is
prevented by the presence of the extrinsic path-
way inhibitor, which restricts the activation of
factor X.
. The intrinsicpathway is activated by negatively
charged surfaces, which can cause coagulation
on surfaces such as artiﬁcial heart valves, hence
the need for anticoagulant drugs. The crucial
stage in the intrinsic pathway is the activation
of factor VIIIa, which may also be activated by
enzymatic cleavage by thrombin, serving to
amplify coagulation responses that have been
triggered by the extrinsic pathway.
. The common pathway in blood clotting is respon-
sible for the production of thrombin (factor IIa)
from prothrombin (factor II). Prothrombin is ac-
tivated by factor Xa, which is itself activated from
factor X by factor Va in a Ca2þ-dependent fashion.
Deﬁciencies in factors VIII or IX, which are part of
the intrinsic pathway, are the normal causes of
haemophilia.
CLINICAL Haemophilia
Haemophilias are inherited deﬁciencies in one of the
bloodclottingfactors.Inmostcases(around90%)this
is factor VIII. The disease is inherited in an X-linked
recessive fashion. Afﬂicted individuals have very poo-
rly clotting blood so that the smallest bruise becomes
a serious injury. Thankfully treatment is now possible
by giving patients the deﬁcient human blood factor.
DEFINITION Fibrinogen
Fibrinogen is a large plasma protein. On cleavage
by thrombin there is a conformational change in the
molecule; it becomes insoluble and rapidly aggre-
gates. This aggregation is aided by cross-linking
catalysed by factor XIIIa to form a large meshwork.
Production of clotting factors
Clotting factors are produced by the liver, and their
activation catalyses further cleavage of the pathway,
to amplify the response. The production of many
clotting factors (II, VII, IX and X) relies on vitamin K.
The anticoagulant warfarin acts through inhibition
of vitamin K’s role in the synthesis of these factors.
CLINICAL Warfarin
Warfarin is a commonly used anticoagulant. It in-
hibits the enzyme vitamin K reductase, to prevent
the reduction of vitamin K – essential for the pro-
duction of many clotting factors. Warfarin takes a
signiﬁcant time to establish its effect. Heparin,
which works by a different mechanism and acts
immediately, is often given until the anticoagulant
effect of Warfarin has been established.

Intrinsic pathway
The intrinsic pathway is so 
named because all components 
of it are found within the blood. It 
is triggered by factor XII, which 
is activated when it comes into 
contact with a negatively 
charged surface. The intrinsic 
pathway is not crucial for blood 
coagulation in vivo because it 
serves to reinforce coagulation 
through the extrinsic pathway.
Extrinsic pathway
The extrinsic pathway is 
triggered by tissue damage, 
through the release of a tissue 
factor. The tissue factor, 
together with Ca2+, binds and 
catalyses the cleavage of 
factor VII into its active form 
VIIa.
Common pathway
The common pathway is 
activated by either the intrinsic 
or the extrinsic pathway. The 
two pathways converge 
through their cleavage of factor 
X to Xa, which in turn activates 
thrombin (factor IIa). This is the 
crucial step, because thrombin 
can activate fibrinogen, and 
also contributes to the action 
of many other factors in the 
cascade, promoting their 
activity.
Thrombin
Prothrombin (factor II) becomes 
activated to thrombin (factor IIa) 
and acts to cleave fibrinogen 
into fibrin, which polymerises to 
form clots. Thrombin also acts 
on factor XIII which, when 
activated, stabilises the fibrin 
clots. Thrombin also has other 
roles. It can bind to specific 
receptors on platelets and 
smooth muscle, activating 
platelets and promoting 
vasospasm. It also promotes the 
activation of many other clotting 
factors in the cascade.
Thrombin may also have 
anticoagulant roles, through 
binding to thrombomodulin, 
which allows it to activate 
promoters of fibrinolysis.
Fibrin
The final stage of 
the coagulation 
cascade is the 
production of fibrin 
from its precursor, 
fibrinogen. The 
fibrin molecules 
polymerise to form 
a tight meshwork of 
fibres. These are 
stabilised through 
the action of factor 
XIIIa to generate a 
stable clot, 
preventing the loss 
of blood.

Regulation of clotting
Theendotheliumistypicallyanticoagulanttorestrict
the development of thrombi in healthy vessels:
. Endothelial cells secrete antithrombin III which
inactivates thrombin.
. Endothelial
cells
express
thrombomodulin,
which binds thrombin, modifying its activity to
activate protein C, which is ﬁbrinolytic.
. Endothelial cells are coated in heparan sulphate,
which has a similar structure and function to
heparin.
DEFINITION Heparin
Heparin refers to a family of glycosaminoglycan
molecules that have potent anticoagulant proper-
ties. Heparin binds antithrombin III which promotes
its action. Heparin and antithrombin III can bind
thrombin, or factor Xa, inhibiting their action and
reducing coagulation.
Clinically, low-molecular-weight heparin is adminis-
tered as an anticoagulant.
Fibrinolysis
Once bleeding has stopped, it is necessary to re-
move the clot, because it no longer serves a pur-
pose, and is likely to impede both repair and
function of the tissue. Clot breakdown (ﬁbrinoly-
sis) is achieved using plasmin, which is generated
by cleavage of plasminogen.
It is also essential to ensure that clotting does not
continue in healthy vessels. This can be achieved
through the interaction of antithrombin III and
heparin. Heparin and ‘heparin-like’ molecules can
bind antithrombin III, which in turn recruits and
inactivates thrombin.
Thrombosis
In some situations haemostatic mechanisms may
be activated inappropriately, which can lead to
severe clinical consequences:
. Arterial thrombosis results from the activation
of platelets, often due to disruption of the endo-
thelium in atherosclerosis.
. Venous thrombosis results from blood clotting.
The factors that promote venous thrombosis can
be described in Virchow’s triad:
. Changes in the surface of the blood vessels can
lead to activation of the endothelium. Systemic
inﬂammation is itself a major risk factor for
thromboses through endothelial activation.
. Changes in the pattern of blood ﬂow, in terms of
both speed and turbulence, may increase the
propensity for thrombus formation. Stasis of
blood within the veins promotes blood clotting,
as is seen in deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Tur-
bulent ﬂow of blood across the endothelium can
activate the endothelium to express procoagula-
tory factors.
. Changes in the constituents of blood are likely
to vastly alter the risk of thrombosis. Increased
viscosity of the blood, as in dehydration, will
affect the pattern of ﬂow and hence alter the risk
of the thromboses.
Virchow’s triad applies to both arterial and venous
thromboses, although the precise changes vary in
different conditions.
CLINICAL Deep vein thrombosis
The deep veins of the leg require the action of
surrounding muscles to return blood to the heart.
During periods of physical inactivity, blood may
pool and become susceptible to clotting. Dehydra-
tion increases the blood viscosity, further promoting
clotting. On moving with a DVT, there is a signiﬁcant
risk that the thrombus may detach and lodge at
another site as an embolus.
Embolism
An embolus is a mass that is transported by the
bloodstream. It may lodge in vessels and prevent
blood ﬂow to capillary beds. Emboli may form
from many different materials:
. Detached thrombus
. Air
. Fat
. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture.
Figure 6.5 Blood clotting factors. The coagulation cascade is made up of a series of proteolytic enzymes, which
each become activated (denoted by an ‘a’) and cleave one or morefurther enzymes in the cascade.The coagulation
cascade can be broken down into three pathways – the intrinsic and the extrinsic, both of which converge through
the common pathway.
3
Cardiovascular system 121

As over 95% of all emboli result from detached
thrombi, the major risk factors of embolism are
very similar to those associated with thrombus
formation.
Pulmonary embolism
An embolus may pass through the right side of the
heart and occlude the pulmonary vessels, restrict-
ing adequate blood ﬂow to the lungs for oxygen-
ation. If the embolus is sufﬁciently large, death will
result. The most common cause of pulmonary
embolism is a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Systemic embolism
Typically originating as an arterial thrombus,
often in the left side of the heart, systemic
emboli
may
block
systemic
capillary
beds.
Thrombus formation may commonly be trig-
gered by atrial ﬁbrillation or myocardial in-
farction, both of which will result in abnormally
turbulent blood ﬂow. The precise effect of the
thrombus depends on the capillary bed that is
blocked.
Treatment of thrombi
Treatment of thrombi focuses on three different
mechanisms, the use of which varies depending on
the type of thrombus (e.g. whether it is arterial or
venous):
1 Angioplasty to open blocked vessels
2 Thrombolytic
agents
to
break
down
the
thrombus
3 Antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin) to prevent
platelet activation and aggregation; they are ef-
fective in inhibiting arterial thrombosis
. Anticoagulants to prevent coagulation and
promote ﬁbrinolysis: heparin is often given,
although it is associated with uncontrolled
bleeding due to the inactivation of the clotting
cascade; warfarin is given as a long-term
treatment for venous thrombosis.
Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerotic lesions are fatty deposits that ac-
cumulate in vessels, leading to their gradual oc-
clusion. These legions may rupture and trigger
formation of an arterial thrombus. Such thrombi
may further occlude the vessel, or break off and
block a downstream vessel. The precise symptoms
of an atherosclerotic lesion depend on the vessels
that it affects.
Mechanisms of atherosclerotic
formation
Atherosclerosis can be viewed as an unusual form
of chronic inﬂammation initiated by the entry of
cholesterol-rich, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)
into the subendothelial space between the tunica
intima and media (Fig. 6.6). There are three crucial
phases in the development of an atherosclerotic
lesion:
1 Initiation
2 Progression
3 Complication.
Initiation
Initiation of the formation of a lesion is caused
by the entry of LDL into the subendothelial
space. Oxidative damage to the LDL can trigger
inﬂammation and activate endothelial cells. As a
result, the endothelium recruits monocytes that
migrate into the tissue and differentiate into
macrophages.
Macrophages express scavenger receptors and
take up modiﬁed LDLs. They become progressively
laden with oxidised LDLs and develop into ‘foam
cells’, forming a fatty streak – a preatherosclerotic
lesion – because they are unable to leave the sub-
endothelial space in the fatty state.
Progression
The progression of a fatty streak into an athero-
sclerotic lesion is the result of continued recruit-
ment of foam cells. This recruitment progressively
forms a necrotic core of tissue. Furthermore,
smooth muscle cells migrate into the tissue and
form a ﬁbrous cap which stabilises the lesion. The
long-term accumulation of cells generates raised
plaques which narrow the vessel. These plaques
may indirectly cause thromboses downstream,
due to the turbulent blood ﬂow that they create.
Complications
Atherosclerotic plaques are associated with two
main complications:
1 Rupture of the plaque can trigger platelet activa-
tion on an exposed core, promoting an arterial
thrombus. Rarely, material from the ruptured
plaque may enter the bloodstream asan embolus.
2 Aneurysms or arterial rupture can result from
weakening in the vessel wall caused by the pres-
ence of the plaque.
122
Cardiovascular system

Initiation
LDL carried in the blood may enter 
the subendothelial space, and 
become oxidised to Ox-LDL. These 
molecules become taken up by 
macrophages in the vascular tissue. 
The macrophages ingest the Ox-LDL 
molecules and become overloaded 
as they are unable to process the 
LDL, resulting in their conversion to 
‘foam cells’. The gradual accumula-
tion of foam cells in point in the 
arteries leads to fatty streaks. 
Progression
Fatty streaks further develop as more 
macrophages ingest Ox-LDL, resulting 
in the accumulation of foam cells . This 
process recruits more macrophages 
and also smooth muscles cells from 
the media. The smooth muscle cells 
secrete various connective tissue 
components, such as collagen, and 
act to stabilise the lesion. Due to the 
increasing number of cells, the lesion 
bulges out into the vessel, which can 
occlude blood flow downstream. The 
additional shear stresses occurring in 
an atherosclerotic lesion result in 
activation of the overlying endothe-
lium, further increasing recruitment of 
macrophages and other cells.
Complication 
Atherosclerotic lesion may progress 
such that foam cells begin to die and 
produce a necrotic core. This may 
destabilise the lesion such that it 
ruptures, exposing the necrotic core 
directly to the blood. The ruptured 
lesion rapidly attracts platelets to 
form a thrombus , and the contents of 
the lesion may also escape into the 
blood supply as a fatty embolus .

Cardiovascular system 123

Risk factors for atherosclerosis
Atherosclerotic processes occur within everyone,
although there are risk factors that increase their
occurrence. Key modiﬁable risk factors that have
been identiﬁed are:
. High plasma LDLs
. Low plasma HDLs (high-density lipoproteins), a
type of lipoprotein that can acquire cholesterol,
so reducing its deposition in the tissues
. Physical inactivity
. Smoking which increases the oxidation of LDLs,
promoting the inﬂammatory processes initiating
atherosclerosis
. High blood pressure: this is likely to increase the
shearstress towhich the endothelium is exposed,
increasing its propensity to be activated
. Diabetes.
Other non-modiﬁable risk factors have been
identiﬁed:
. Being male
. A family history of atherosclerosis
. Age: atherosclerosis is a process that takes many
years to manifest, so older people are more likely
to develop such conditions
. Genetic disorders, such as familial hypercho-
lesterolaemia (FH), in which there is altered
regulation of lipoproteins, vastly increase the risk
of atherosclerosis.
Prevention of atherosclerosis
Much of the treatment of atherosclerosis is
through lifestyle and dietary changes to reduce the
risk factors associated with an increased risk of the
condition. Drugs may be used to reduce the levels
of cholesterol (and, hence, LDLs) within the body:
. Diet is a crucial factor to manage the develop-
ment of atherosclerosis. The typically western
diet contains far more fat and cholesterol than
the body has evolved to tolerate. As a result
cutting down cholesterol can slow the progres-
sion of developing atherosclerotic lesions.
. Exercise.
. Statins inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-
CoA reductase, which is crucial for the endoge-
nous synthesis of cholesterol. Increases in the
expression of LDL receptor on the liver have been
observed which are likely to further reduce plas-
ma levels. Statins have proved to be extremely
effective drugs with few side effects.
CLINICAL Familial
hypercholesterolaemia (FH)
FH is a genetic disorder resulting from mutations
in the proteins regulating the transport and
uptake of LDLs. High levels of LDLs result, which
are taken up by scavenger receptors on macro-
phages, so promoting atherosclerosis. There
are a number of common features for people
with FH:
. Family
history
of
atherosclerosis
and
heart
disease
. Early onset cardiovascular disease
. Cholesterol deposition in the tissues, in particular:
– tendon xanthomas – yellow cholesterol deposits
in the tendons
– deposition of cholesterol in the eyelids, disco-
louring them
– discoloration of the iris.
Mutations resulting in FH occur either in the
LDL receptor, making it non-functional, or in the
transport
protein
ApoB100.
Individuals
who
are hetero- and homozygous for FH mutations
have
been
reported;
these
require
different
treatments:
. Heterozygous FH individuals still express the
LDL receptor, allowing statins to be used as
treatment.
. Homozygous FH individuals are extremely rare,
and have signiﬁcantly more severe symptoms.
Apheresis may be used instead, in which LDLs
are removed directly from the patient’s blood, or a
liver transplantation may be undertaken, repla-
cing the patient’s liver with one that expresses
functional LDL receptors.
Treatment of atherosclerosis
Surgical intervention is required if an atheroscle-
rotic
lesion
prevents
sufﬁcient
blood
from
reaching the tissues. Three major procedures are
commonly used:
1 Balloon angioplasty. a
balloon
is
inserted
through an incision in the femoral artery up
to the stenosis. The balloon is then inﬂated
to open the lumen of the affected vessel.
There is a signiﬁcant risk, with a balloon
angioplasty,
that
the
vessel
will
collapse
again because there is nothing to hold the
vessel open.
124
Cardiovascular system

2 Stenting. A vessel is opened by a balloon angio-
plasty and a metal tube placed at the site of
stenosis to hold the vessel open. Although this
guarantees that the vessel will remain open, the
body is likely to react against the stent, despite
being coated in drugs to prevent this. Smooth
muscle cells may migrate to the site and con-
tribute to further stenosis, which must be cor-
rected by more drastic intervention.
3 Coronary artery bypass graft(CABG). A blocked
vessel can be bypassed by the attachment of a
grafted vessel
either side of
the
blockage.
Typically, an artery from the thoracic wall is used
because it can cope with the high-pressure arte-
rialblood ﬂow and does not severelycompromise
blood ﬂow to the thoracic wall tissues.

Respiratory system
The respiratory system’s principal role is ensur-
ing the oxygenation of the blood and the removal
of carbon dioxide from the body through gas-
eous exchange which occurs in the alveoli of the
lungs.
The gaseous exchange that occurs in the lungs
relies on diffusion, and is reﬂected in the large
surface area that the lungs provide, through the
many millions of small alveoli which are the sites of
gas exchange.
Although carbon dioxide is readily soluble in the
blood, the transport of oxygen is through a spe-
cialised transport protein – haemoglobin. In the
lungs the ventilation of the alveoli is matched to the
blood ﬂow, to allow sufﬁcient time for the diffusion
of oxygen. This large blood ﬂow and surface area
also allow the regulation of many other processes:
in particular, the short-term regulation of pH, as a
result of the effect of CO2 in bicarbonate buffering
of the blood, and as a site of enzymatic activity
allowing the modulation of protein hormones car-
ried in the blood.
Anatomy of the respiratory
system
The gross anatomy of the lungs and their rela-
tion to other thoracic structures is discussed in
the anatomy chapter, whilst the detailed anat-
omy of the airways and lungs are discussed
below.
The pleura
The pleurae cover the lungs to allow their move-
ment against the chest wall during breathing, with-
out causing irritation. They are made of two layers
surrounding a potential space:
. The visceral pleura surrounds the lungs, and
protrudes into the ﬁssures, so that all the lobes
are covered. They receive their blood supply from
the bronchial arteries.
. The parietal pleura lies outside the visceral
pleura. It is in contact with structures directly
adjacentto the lungs –the mediastinum, thoracic
wall and diaphragm. The parietal pleura is vas-
cularised by the thoracic wall blood.
. The pleural sac is the potential space between
the two layers of pleurae. It contains a layer of
pleural ﬂuid which acts as a lubricant. The sur-
face tension of the pleural ﬂuid is sufﬁcient to
ensure that the pleural layers (and, hence, the
lungs and thoracic wall) remain in contact so that
the lungs expand as the chest does.
The airways
The airways transport air to the sites of gas ex-
change while limiting entry of pathogens and
harmful particles into the fragile lung tissue, as
well as moistening the air to aid diffusion. The
airways can be divided into three sets of structures:
1 The upper airways and sinuses are found in the
head and neck, and share many conduits with
the gastrointestinal tract.

2 The larynx connects the upper airways to the
respiratory tree and is separate from the gas-
trointestinal tract.
3 The respiratory tree is the branching structure
of airways that carries air from the trachea to the
alveoli – the site of gas exchange.
CLINICAL Pneumothorax
Pneumothorax is an accumulation of air in the pleu-
ral cavity, reducing the vital capacity; this causes a
‘collapsed lung’. Occasionally, a one-way valve
forms that causes air to be drawn into the pleural
space, although it prevents it from leaving. This
tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency
and causes rapid inﬂation of the pleural space and
an accompanying shift of the mediastinum, detect-
able by deviation of the trachea at the neck.
Treatment of a pneumothorax depends on its
size:
. A small pneumothorax will resolve spontan-
eously.
. Larger pneumothoraces require the insertion of
a chest drain – a tube containing a one-way valve
to remove air from the pleura.
. Tension pneumothorax is treated rapidly by the
insertion of a needle into the chest (at the second
intercostal space in the midclavicular line) to allow
removal of air from the chest. A chest drain is then
inserted to clear the pneumothorax.
The upper airways and sinuses
The nose and sinuses are the site of entry of air, and
are responsible for warming inhaled air. In addi-
tion, they are involved in removing particles by the
hairs and mucus present in the nose.
The trachea
The trachea is the large single tube through which
inhaled air ﬂows. The trachea starts directly below
the larynx at the level of C6, and ends at the
carina, where it bifurcates into the two bronchi;
this occurs at the level of the T4–5 intervertebral
disc. The trachea is held open by incomplete rings
of cartilage, which contain gaps posteriorly
(where the oesophagus lies) to allow expansion
of the oesophagus for passage of food to the
stomach.
The respiratory tree
The respiratory tree is a series of branching
tubes, which form in the lungs by branching mor-
phogenesis. The 23 generations of branches
carry air from the trachea to the millions of alveoli;
gas exchange occurs in only the last six genera-
tions. The ﬁrst few branches of the respiratory tree
reﬂect the gross anatomical organisation of the
lungs:
. The trachea is the ﬁrst airway in the respiratory
tree.
. One bronchus carries air to eachlung, entering at
the hilum of the lungs. The bronchi are sup-
ported by rings of cartilage in their walls.
. Lobar bronchi are branches of the main bronchi.
There are two lobar bronchi on the left and three
on the right.
. The segmental bronchi are the branches of the
lobar bronchi. Each segmental bronchus sup-
plies a distinct bronchopulmonary segment.
. The bronchioles branch into progressively smal-
ler branches in each bronchopulmonary seg-
ment, carrying air to the alveoli.
The lungs
For gas exchange to occur, inspired air must be
brought close to the blood in the pulmonary
capillaries, so that diffusion can occur. The
branching structure of the airways terminates
in small air sacs – the alveoli – which are sur-
rounded by blood vessels The numerous alveoli
generate an enormous surface area to facilitate
diffusion.
Gross anatomy of the lungs
The lungs are found on either side of the medias-
tinum and are broadly pyramidal in shape. Three
sides can be identiﬁed (Fig. 7.1):
. The costal surface is the large curved surface that
lies adjacent to, and follows the course of, the
sternum, ribs and costal cartilages.
. The mediastinal surface is adjacent to the me-
diastinum. The left lung has a ‘cardiac notch’ in
its mediastinal surface, which accommodates
the pericardium.
. The diaphragmatic surface forms the bottom of
the lung which lies on the superior surface of the
diaphragm.
Respiratory system 127

A variety of structural features of the lungs can be
identiﬁed:
. The lungs are divided into lobes. The left lung
has two lobes separated by the horizontal ﬁs-
sure, whereas the right has three lobes, separat-
ed by horizontal and oblique ﬁssures.
. The hilum of the lungs, located on the medial
surface, is the site of entry of the bronchi, vas-
culature and nerves.
. The apex is the blunt superior end of the lungs
which ascends above the level of the ﬁrst rib and
into the lower part of the neck.
Bronchopulmonary segments
Both lungs are organised into 10 bronchopulmon-
ary segments separated by connective tissue; each
receives its own blood supply and airway:
. A segmental bronchiole carries air to each
bronchopulmonary segment.
. A segmental pulmonary artery supplies each
segment.
. Pulmonary veins run in the connective tissue
between the segments, and receive blood from
both segments.
The respiratory zone
The respiratory zone contains the last 6 genera-
tions (17–23) of the respiratory tree. These airways
are lined with alveoli, which account for around
10% of the gas exchange surface. The ﬁnal gener-
ation of airways terminates in many alveoli, which
accounts for the remainder of the gaseous ex-
change surface.
Alveoli
The alveoli are the basic functional unit of the
lungs. Each lung contains around 300 million,
the development of which is not completed until
the age of around 8 years. The alveoli are made up
of a single cellular layer, which is closely apposed
to capillary vessels, containing blood in the
pulmonary circulation.

and medial sides. The apex of the lungs ascends into the neck. Although the right lung has both horizontal and
oblique ﬁssures, the left lung has only an oblique ﬁssure because it is divided into just two lobes. The oblique ﬁssure
runs from the level of T2 on the posterior aspect to the level of the sixth costal cartilage anteriorly. The horizontal
ﬁssure runs along the level of the fourth rib. The left lung possesses a pronounced cardiac notch on the medial side.
The pleurae (red) surround the lungs. Should a wound occur allowing air to enter the pleura, a pneumothorax
occurs. The presence of air between the pleurae prevents the proper expansion of lungs, limiting ventilation.

Respiratory system

Vasculature and innervation
of the lungs
Arterial supply
The lungs receive two arterial supplies:
1 The pulmonary arteries carry blood from the
heart for oxygenation.
2 The bronchial arteries carry oxygenated blood
to supply the tissue of the lungs.
The pulmonary arteries
The right and left pulmonary arteries originate
from the pulmonary trunk and enter the lungs at
the hilum. They descend posterolaterally to the
main bronchus and divide progressively following
the bronchial tree, with the arterial branch running
anterior to its corresponding bronchiole.
The bronchial arteries
The bronchial arteries are part of the systemic
circulation, oxygenating the lung tissues:
. The left bronchial artery arises from the thoracic
aorta.
. The right bronchial artery arises from either the
superior branch of the left bronchial artery or an
intercostal artery.
The bronchial arteries supply the bronchial tissue
as far as the respiratory bronchioles.
Venous drainage
There are two different venous systems in the
lungs:
. Two pulmonary veins leave each lung and carry
oxygenated blood to the left atrium.
. The bronchial veins drain part of the blood
supplied by the bronchial arteries whereas the
remainder is drained by the pulmonary veins.
The right bronchial vein drains into the azygos
vein whereas the left drains into the hemiazygos
vein.
Lymphatic drainage
The lymphatic drainage of the lungs contains two
main groups of lymphatics in the connective tis-
sue, one superﬁcial and one deeper. Both drain to
the hilar lymph nodes. Lymph from the parietal
pleura drains to the lymph nodes of the thoracic
wall. In the cervical region, there is some drainage
to the axillary lymph nodes.
Innervation
The lungs receive sensory innervation from both
arms of the autonomic nervous system:
. Sensory ﬁbres are derived from the vagus nerve.
These sense stretching of the vessels and bron-
chi, and can detect irritation that may initiate a
cough reﬂex.
. Sympathetic ﬁbres cause relaxation of the bron-
chial smooth muscle and decrease secretion.
Sympathetic stimulation also triggers pulmonary
vasoconstriction.
. Parasympathetic ﬁbres from the vagus nerve
trigger bronchoconstriction as well as dilatation
of the pulmonary vessels. They also stimulate
secretion in the bronchioles and alveoli.
The parietal pleura receives a rich sensory inner-
vation resulting in pain on irritation:
. The phrenic nerves supply the mediastinal side
of the lungs and the central part of the diaphrag-
matic surface. Those areas innervated by the
phrenic nerve develop referred pain over the
C3–5 dermatomes – the base of the neck and
shoulder.
. The intercostal nerves supply the costal surface
of the lungs and the peripheral regions of the
diaphragmatic surface. Regions innervated by the
costal nerves have referred pain from the area of
skin innervated by the same intercostal nerves.
The
visceral
pleura
receives
no
sensory
innervation.
Tissue types in the lungs
There is pronounced specialisation of the respira-
tory tract. Three distinct groups of tissues with
different functions can be identiﬁed:
1 The respiratory epithelium allows carriage of
air to the alveoli while removing any debris
present.
2 The alveolar cells are adapted to ensure that the
alveoli
are
open
and
capable
of
gaseous
exchange.
3 The connective tissue of the lungs supports the
rest of the structures involved in ventilation.
Respiratory epithelial cells
The predominant cells in the airways are the
ciliated
epithelial
cells;
however,
these
are
Respiratory system 129

interspersed with secretory cells which release
mucus and other secretions to protect the airways:
. The ciliated epithelial cells provide a physical
barrier to the movement of mucus, and anything
caught within it, out of the respiratory tract. The
cells are classiﬁed as pseudostratiﬁed columnar
epithelial cells.
. Goblet cells contain mucus droplets, which they
secrete into the lumen of the airways. The mucus
catches debris in the air and facilitates its remov-
al through the mucociliary escalator.
. Clara cells produce surfactant and express de-
toxifying enzymes to protect the airways. They
are also the stem cells that replicate and differ-
entiate to replace other cell types that may be lost
through damage.
. Brush cells have microvilli on their apical surface
and are innervated, suggesting that they have a
sensory role.
. Neuroendocrine cells may have a sensory role in
the lungs, as well as secreting regulatory factors.
DEFINITION Mucociliary escalator
Inhaled particles in the lungs are trapped by mucus
secreted by the goblet cells. This is then moved out
of the respiratory tract by beating of the cilia on the
epithelium. This movement draws the mucus to the
epiglottis where it is swallowed.
CLINICAL Emphysema
Emphysema is the destruction of the alveolar walls,
decreasing the available surface for gas exchange.
Many inhaled pollutants from smoking and air pol-
lution damage the alveoli and cause emphysema,
which decreases surface area for gas exchange to
the point where it is inadequate to meet the body’s
needs. Emphysema is a major cause of death in the
industrialised world.
Alveolar tissue
The alveolar surface is extremely thin (less than
1 mm thick), and can be divided into three layers:
1 Surface epithelium
2 Basement membrane and supporting matrix
3 Capillary cell wall.
The alveolar walls contribute to the high surface
area and contain pores that allow the passage of
alveolar
macrophages
between
the
different
alveoli.
The surface epithelium
Two cell types are found in the diffusion surface of
the alveoli:
. Type I pneumocytes make up around 95% of the
surface area of the alveoli.
. Type II pneumocytes are the most numerous
cells in the alveoli, yet account for <5% of the
alveolar surface area. The two main roles of the
type II cells are secretion of surfactants and
being precursors of type I pneumocytes.
The basement membrane
The basement membrane of the pneumocytes and
the capillaries contains collagen and elastin ﬁbres,
to provide recoil for expulsion of air from the
alveoli during expiration. As with other alveolar
layers, the basement membrane is thin, to help
diffusion.
Alveolar capillaries
The pulmonary capillaries form a plexus of thin
vessels around the alveoli to minimise the diffu-
sion distance. The alveolar capillaries are contin-
uous and do not contain fenestrations, to prevent
ﬂuid leaving the capillaries as a result of Starling’s
forces.
Alveolar macrophages
Alveolar macrophages do not contribute to the
diffusion surface of the alveoli. Instead, they pro-
vide innate immune protection and are responsi-
ble for the clearance of particulate matter that
reaches the alveoli. These cells are derived from
circulating macrophages and can travel between
alveoli, through pores in the alveolar wall.
Supporting tissue of the lungs
The airways contain connective tissue that sup-
ports and maintains the airways as conduits to the
alveoli:
. Cartilage reinforces the large branches of the
respiratory tree. These branches maintain the
vessels during expiration, when the increased
130
Respiratory system

force can cause collapse, preventing further ex-
pulsion of air. Initially cartilage is found as rings,
although, as the bronchioles become narrower,
they are found in small plates before disappear-
ing entirely.
. Smooth muscle cells are found throughout the
respiratory tree. These receive autonomic inner-
vation, allowing regulation of the size of the air-
ways, and of the vessel resistance.
. The elastic connective tissue provides the lungs
with the recoil to contract and expel air during
expiration. This elasticity also allows the expan-
sion necessary for inspiration.
Ventilation
Ventilation is the physical process by which air is
drawninto the lungs so that gas exchange can occur
in the alveoli. It is achieved by contraction of the
diaphragm and ribcage, increasing the volume of
the thoracic cavity. This, in turn, causes expansion
of the lungs, which reduces the pressure, allowing
the inﬂow of air down the pressure gradient.
DEFINITION Ventilation
Ventilation (V) is deﬁned as the volume of gas
breathed out in 1 min, which is determined by the
formula:
VðmL=minÞ ¼ Volume of one breath ðmLÞ
Breaths=min:
A better measure of the air entering the lungs is the
volume available for gaseous exchange – alveolar
ventilation (VA) – which takes into account the
volume of dead space (VD) in the lungs:
VAðmL=minÞ ¼ ðVolume of one breath  VDÞ
Breaths=min:
Mechanics of ventilation
There are two stages to ventilation: inspiration,
when air is drawn into the lungs, and expiration,
when air is expelled. Inspiration is always an active
process, requiring contraction of muscles, whereas
expiration is initially a passive process, relying on
the elastic properties of the lung tissue. At higher
rates of breathing, forced expiration occurs.
Inspiration
The following are two main groups of muscles
involved in inspiration:
1 The diaphragm contracts and ﬂattens to in-
crease the size of the thorax.
2 The external intercostal muscles pull the ribs
upwardsandoutwards,toincreasethevolumeof
the thoracic cavity.
On inspiration, the sternocleidomastoids and oth-
er neck muscles aid breathing, particularly if the
individual’s arms are braced against a surface,
allowing the pectoral muscles to contribute to
inspiration.
Expiration
Expiration is mainly a passive action, relying on the
elastic nature of the tissues to expel the air, al-
though the internal intercostal muscles can con-
tract, pulling the ribs downwards and inwards.
During exercise, forced expiration increases the
rate of expiration. Contraction of the abdominal
muscles aids the expulsion of air from the lungs by
forcing the roof of the diaphragm up into the
thorax.
Static mechanics of ventilation
The static values measured in respiration refer to
those determined by the static properties of the
lungs, and are not a direct measurement of the rate
of air ﬂow through the airways and the related
effects. A variety of different lung volumes can be
measured by spirometry or helium dilution.
These static volumes reﬂect the total volume avail-
able in the lung as well as that proportion usually
used in ventilation (Fig. 7.2):
. The total lung capacity (TLC) is the total volume
of air that the lungs can accommodate; however,
not all the air can be removed, even during
maximal ventilation.
. The residual volume (RV) of the lungs is the
volume that remains at maximal expiration.
. The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the
volume of gas that is in the lungs at the end of a
normal breath. This cannot be calculated with-
out knowledge of the RV of the lungs.
. The vital capacity (VC) is the maximum volume
of air that can be inhaled and expelled by the
lungs.
Respiratory system 131

. The tidal volume is the volume of air that is
ventilated during normal breathing.
DEFINITION Spirometry
A spirometer is used to measure breath functions.
There are two sets of values that a spirometer may
measure: volume and ﬂow rate. Spirometers require
the patient to breathe into a tube attached to the
machine, and the volume of air in relation to time
taken is measured. From these data many different
values can be calculated.
DEFINITION Helium dilution
It is not possible to measure the total lung volume
(and the residual volume) using spirometry. In-
stead, helium dilution is used. The patient breathes
from a spirometer containing a known volume of
helium. As helium is effectively insoluble, repeated
re-breathing allows the helium to become evenly
diluted between the lungs and the spirometer. The
magnitude of the dilution of the helium, together with
the initial concentration and volume of the spirom-
eter, can be used to calculate the total lung volume.
Dead space
Gas exchange occurs only in the respiratory
zone
which
is
made
up
of
the
last
six
generations of the respiratory tree (branches
17–23). Before this point, the airways of lungs are
anatomical dead space in which no diffusion
occurs:
. The anatomical dead space has a volume of
around 150 mL.
. The respiratory zone has a volume of around
3000 mL.
Physiological dead space
Physiological dead space is a better measure of the
volume in the lungs that does not permit gas
exchange. It consists of two components:
1 The airways in the anatomical dead space,
which do not contribute to diffusion
2 The alveolar dead space, which is the area in the
respiratory zone where there is little perfusion or
ventilation, preventing adequate gaseous ex-
change. In situations where there is damage to
the alveolar tissue, there may be a signiﬁcant
contribution from the alveolar dead space, as in
emphysema.

Respiratory system

Partial pressures
The partial pressures of O2 and CO2 vary between
the arteries and the veins. Gas exchange is a passive
process, and occurs through diffusion down a
concentration gradient. In most cases, there is
sufﬁcient time to allow equilibrium between the
arteries and the alveoli. The values of arterial O2
and CO2 pressures are virtually identical to those of
the alveoli (Table 7.1).
DEFINITION Partial pressure
This describes the concentration of a gas in the air,
or dissolvedin a ﬂuid.The partialpressureof a gasis
deﬁned as the pressure that it would exert if all other
gases were removed, yet the volume in which it is
contained were kept constant.
The partial pressure of a gas can be calculated
by multiplying its relative concentration by the
total pressure of the gas in which it is found.
However, the pressure resulting from water must
also be accounted for. The lungs saturate the air
with water vapour, resulting in a partial pressure of
water of 47 mmHg, which must be ‘removed’ from
the initial gas pressure. Thus the partial pressure of
a gas is:
ðAtmospheric pressure ðmmHgÞ  47Þ
 Relative concentration of gas ¼ Partial pressure:
To get the partial pressure in the correct units of
kilopascals, 1 mmHg ¼ 133 Pa.
The contribution
of water vapour becomes
more signiﬁcant at high altitudes, because it
effectively removes a proportion of the air that can
carry O2.
Regional ventilation
Ventilation of the lungs is altered by:
. Gravity: the weight of the lung tissue alters the
interpleural pressure, resulting in a more nega-
tive pressure at higher regions. The lower regions
are more compressed, have a greater potential to
expand and can draw in a greater volume of air,
proportionally increasing the ventilation that
they receive.
. Speed of inspiration: fast breathing promotes
better ventilation of the higher regions of the
lungs at FRC. Under slow breathing, the lower
regions of the lungs are better ventilated.
Dynamic respiratory mechanisms
The dynamic effects on ventilation are the result of
the airﬂow through the airways, and the changing
resistance, which depends on the pattern and rate
of ﬂow.
At low velocities air ﬂows through a tube in a
smooth stream – laminar ﬂow. At higher ﬂow rates
the air becomes turbulent, resulting in a disrupted
stream, and large changes in the resistance of the
airﬂow. Although the airﬂow is laminar, the resis-
tance of the ﬂow through the tube can be deter-
mined by Poiseuille’s equation:
R ¼ ð8hlÞ=ðpr4Þ
where h is the coefﬁcient of viscosity, P the pres-
sure difference, l the length and r the radius.
The tube size has a huge effect on the resistance
during laminar ﬂow – halving the radius of the tube
increases the resistance 16-fold.
The nature of the airﬂow tends to vary through-
out the lungs. Pure laminar ﬂow occurs when the
air is moving in parallel stream lines, with the air at
the centre moving far faster than the air at the
edges. In contrast, turbulent ﬂow is more disorga-
nised and lacks the high-velocity ﬂow seen at the
centre of tubes with laminar ﬂow:
. Airﬂow is turbulent in the trachea.
. Most of the respiratory tree carries air in tran-
sition (neither truly laminar nor truly turbulent).
. True laminar ﬂow is seen only in the smallest
bronchioles.
Airway resistance
Airway resistance is governed by the total cross-
sectional area. The point at which the maximal

resistance is encountered is in the ﬁrst seven gen-
erations of branching. After this point, the large
number of airways generates a larger total cross-
sectional area, although each individual airway is
of a very small diameter. The cross-sectional area
of the lung airways may vary during breathing,
altering resistance:
. The lung volume alters the support that the
connective tissue ﬁbres provide to the lung,
drawing open the airways.
. The tone of the airway smooth muscle can be
altered by a variety of stimuli – from both the
environment and the body.
Measurement of airway resistance
Measurement of airway resistance allows detec-
tion and diagnosis of pathologies in the lungs.
Airway resistance can be determined by the differ-
ence between mouth pressure and alveolar pres-
sure. Two key values are used to assess the airway
resistance:
1 The forced expiratory volume in 1 second
(FEV1) is the maximum volume of air that an
individual can expel in 1 second. Changes in this
ratio allow the distinction between restrictive
and obstructive pulmonary diseases.
2 Peak expiratory ﬂow (PEF) provides a measure-
ment
of
airway
resistance.
It
is
relatively
constant regardless of the force with which one
tries to expire. As the pressure on the lungs
increases,theairwaysareconstricted,increasing
the potential resistance for a given airﬂow
velocity.
DEFINITION Restrictive and obstructive
pulmonary diseases
In restrictive diseases (e.g. ﬁbrosis) the ability of
the lung to expand has been impeded. As such,
people with the condition are likely to have a
markedly reduced FVC, although their FEV1 is prob-
ably quite normal, because the airways themselves
are not obstructed.
Obstructive diseases lead to the obstruction of
airﬂow through the lungs. As a result the FEV1 of
infected individuals is likely to be rather lower than
average, although the vital capacity is unlikely to be
as affected as in restrictive disorders.
CLINICAL Asthma
Asthma is an obstructive pulmonary disorder
caused by a chronic inﬂammatory response within
the lungs. The closure of the airways in people with
asthma can be managed by steroids to reduce
inﬂammation and also acutely by the administration
of salbutamol, a b2-adrenoceptor agonist, which
causes dilatation of the bronchial smooth muscle.
Compliance and airway closure
In normal breathing, the lungs are very compliant.
At higher volumes, the lungs become less compli-
ant – there is an increased amount of effort re-
quired to allow further tissue expansion.
DEFINITION Compliance
Compliance of the lungs is measured as the change
in volume of the lungs for a change in pressure. This
provides a measure of how easily the lungs can be
inﬂated. The compliance of the lungs and the chest
wall differ slightly, because they are separated by
the pleura.
Changes in compliance can be associated with
pathology and tissue damage. Common causes of
reduced compliance are:
. Pulmonary ﬁbrosis due to the increased ﬁbrous
tissue hindering expansion
. Pulmonary oedema which causes increased
compliance through prevention of the inﬂation
of some of the alveoli, as they become ﬁlled
within ﬂuid
. Emphysema which leads to increased compli-
ance as a result of loss of connective tissue in the
alveoli, including the elastic ﬁbres
. During asthma attacks there is an increase in
compliance although the mechanisms are not
fully understood
. Normal ageing of the lungs which leads to in-
creased compliance, due to changes in the alve-
olar connective tissues.
The relationship between the interpleural pressure
and the lung volume at a given pressure differs on
inspiration and expiration (Fig. 7.3). This is known
as hysteresis and results from airway closure.
134
Respiratory system

In less well-ventilated regions (i.e. base of the
lung), it is not possible for all the air to be expelled
from the lungs, because the smaller airways
tend tocollapsebeforethealveoli.Inelderly people,
this effect may be signiﬁcant during normal breath-
ing, due to changes in the elastic connective tissue.
Regions where airway closure occurs are poorly
ventilated and, as a result, have poor gas exchange.
Surfactant in the alveoli also contributes to hyster-
esis because it alters the alveolar surface tension.
Movement of air in the respiratory
zone
The later branches of the respiratory tree are termed
the respiratory zone, because they are the site of
gaseous exchange. At this point the cross-sectional
area of the airways is so large that the movement of
air by diffusion is greater than that occurring as a
result of ventilation. The result is that gas partial
pressures of in this region remain relatively con-
stant and do not change with each breath.
Alveolar ventilation
In the respiratory zone, the partial pressures of CO2
and O2 remain relatively constant, and can be
calculated by the alveolar gas equation:
PAO2 ¼ PIO2  PaCO2½FIO2 þ ð1  FIO2Þ=R
where PIO2 is the partial pressure of inspired O2,
PACO2 the partial pressure of alveolar CO2, FIO2 the
fraction of air, i.e. O2 and R the respiratory quotient.
DEFINITION Respiratory quotient
The respiratory quotient (RQ) provides a ratio of
CO2 production and oxygen consumption:
RQ ¼ CO2 production=O2 consumption:
At rest, the average man consumes around 250 mL
O2/min and has a respiratory quotient of 0.8. In
exercise his RQ may increase to 2, and his intake
of O2 increases to around 3000 mL, and thus CO2
production increases to 6000 mL.

Figure 7.3 Intrapleural pressure during ventilation. The intrapleural pressure of the lungs differs on inspiration
and expiration and at different lung volumes, as a result of the effect of surfactant and the collapse of the smaller
vessel before complete expulsion of air from the lungs. There is a difference in the effort (as reﬂected in the changes
in intrapleural pressure) required to inﬂate and deﬂate the lungs. This hysteresis becomes progressively more
pronounced for bigger breaths.
Respiratory system 135

Surfactant and surface tension
The alveoli are all lined with ﬂuid, resulting in
a surface tension due to the stronger interactions
of the liquid molecules with each other than
with the gases. As a result the liquid surface
area tries to contract, generating a pressure in the
gas in the alveoli. This is determined by La Place’s
Law:
Pressure ¼ 2  Surface tension=Radius:
As the alveoli are not all the same size, the
tension should trigger the smaller alveoli to col-
lapse because the increased pressure causes the
gases within to be expelled into the neighbouring,
larger alveoli. This is overcome by the presence of
surfactant within the alveolar ﬂuid.
Surfactants are unusual in that the surface ten-
sion changes with the volume. It is made up of a
phospholipid – dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
(DPPC). The molecules of DPPC repel each other.
As a result the more tightly the molecules are
packed, the more strongly they repel each other,
opposing the effects of surface tension. Surfactant
contributes to lung function by:
. increasing compliance of the lungs such that
the work required to inﬂate the lungs is reduced
. promoting alveolar stability by opposing the La
Place equation
. preventing the transduction of ﬂuids into
the alveoli. Surface tension promotes the ac-
cumulation of liquids in a discrete location.
By disrupting surface tension, surfactant hin-
ders this accumulation of ﬂuids within the
alveoli.
CLINICAL Respiratory distress
syndrome
Preterm babies frequently lack surfactant produc-
tion, which causes collapse of the alveoli within
the lungs so the work required for inspiration is
correspondingly increased. As the neonate is un-
able to breathe well, he or she becomes under-
ventilated and retains CO2, which can contribute to
damage to the respiratory epithelium and pulmo-
nary capillaries; it forms a ﬁbrous tissue that gives
the disease its other common name, hyaline mem-
brane disease.
Perfusion
The pulmonary circulation is the low-pressure
circulation pumped by the right side of the heart.
It carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs for gas
exchange. The blood then ﬂows into the tributaries
of the pulmonary veins, which carry the reoxyge-
nated blood back to the heart for the systemic
circulation.
Regulation of pulmonary
perfusion
The pulmonary circulation transports blood a
short distance but must carry the same volume
as the systemic circulation with each beat. As
a
result,
the
pulmonary
blood
pressure
is
low, although it ﬂuctuates markedly with each
heartbeat.
. Pulmonary systolic blood pressure is typically
25 mmHg.
. Pulmonary diastolic blood pressure is typically
8 mmHg.
The low pressure of the pulmonary circulation is
essential because the pulmonary vessels have
much thinner walls than their corresponding sys-
temic vessels, reﬂecting two major differences in
the roles of the circulation:
1 There is little need to distribute the blood
asymmetrically: in the systemic circulation the
blood is allocated depending on the metabolic
needs of different tissues. In the pulmonary
circulation, all the blood requires oxygenation,
so there is little need to direct it. As a result the
blood vessels do not possess a signiﬁcant mus-
cular layer. The pulmonary circulation remains
in the chest.
2 The
transmural
pressure
of
the
alveolar
capillaries must be kept low: the alveolar ves-
sels are effectively surrounded by gas – there is
little interstitial ﬂuid as there is around the en-
dothelium of systemic capillaries. As a result
there is little hydrostatic force in the interstitium
to prevent ﬂow of the plasma into the alveoli
through Starling’s forces. There is a small net
pressure in the lungs forcing ﬂuid from the
capillaries. This is reﬂected in the small lymph
ﬂow drained by the lymphatic system. Increased
pulmonary blood pressure can increase the
136
Respiratory system

movement of ﬂuid out of the capillaries and lead
to pulmonary oedema in severe cases.
CLINICAL Pulmonary oedema
An increase in the pressure inside the pulmonary
capillaries can result in increased ﬂuid leaving the
capillaries. This increased ﬂuid is pulmonary
oedema. The oedema may directly damage the
fragile alveolar tissue, as well as ﬁlling the alveoli
with ﬂuid, thereby reducing the available surface for
gas exchange.
Pulmonary oedema is treated by reducing the
pulmonary blood pressure, which is
typically
achieved by improving cardiac function. Although
the pulmonary function is being corrected, oxygen
is typically given to ensure adequate oxygenation of
the blood.
Distribution of blood ﬂow in
the pulmonary circulation
The level of perfusion of the lungs varies across the
height of the lung as a result of the hydrostatic
pressure differences, the weight of lung tissue and
ﬂuid on the vessels. As a result, in the upper regions
of the lungs, the pressure within the alveoli tends to
exceed that in the pulmonary vessels, constricting
blood ﬂow. Further down, towards the bottom of
the lungs, the pulmonary arterial pressure is
greater, exceeding the alveolar pressure, which
allows for increased perfusion. The difference in
pressure between the top and bottom of the lungs
may be around 25 mmHg.
Regulation of pulmonary
vascular resistance
The pressure in the pulmonary circulation must be
kept low. However, there is a vasoconstrictive re-
sponse in hypoxia. Regions of low alveolar O2
trigger vasoconstriction of the arterioles in this
region. It is thought that this mechanism may
ensure that pulmonary blood ﬂows to well-venti-
lated areas of the lungs, allowing gas exchange and
diverting it from regions of the lungs where the
airways are compressed or blocked.
The hypoxic vasoconstriction response can pres-
ent a clinical problem at high altitude, where the low
oxygen levels may trigger a widespread vasoconstric-
tion, which leads to increased pulmonary pressure.
Matching of ventilation
and perfusion
To ensure that there is efﬁcient gaseous exchange,
both the ventilation of the lungs and the perfusion of
the pulmonary capillary beds must be regulated so
that sufﬁcient O2 reaches the alveoli and the blood
ﬂow allows effective loading of O2 on to haemoglobin:
. Ventilation ensures that sufﬁcient O2 reaches
the diffusion surfaces within the alveoli. If the
amount of gas reaching the alveoli is reduced,
less diffusion will occur.
. Perfusion of the alveoli will affect loading. If the
blood ﬂow is too low, there is sufﬁcient time for
equilibration of the blood gases, although total
oxygen transport to the tissues must still be suf-
ﬁcient to meet its requirements. At high perfusion
levels, more blood ﬂows through the alveoli al-
though there may be insufﬁcient time for equil-
ibration of the gases between the alveoli and the
blood. In general, perfusion is the limiting factor.
The matching of ventilation ( _V ) and perfusion ( _Q)
is stated by the ratio
_V = _Q. The necessity for a
regulated
_V = _Q can be illustrated by the three-
compartment model, modelling a normal alveolus
and the two extremes (Fig. 7.4):
. Pulmonary shunt
. Alveolar dead space
. Matched ventilation and perfusion.
Pulmonary shunt
The situation in which there is no ventilation is seen to
a small extent within the body and contributes to a
small reduction in the ﬁnal arterial PO2. The main
physiological causes result from systemic venous
blooddrainingintothepulmonaryvenouscirculation:
. A small amount of bronchial arterial blood is
drained by the pulmonary veins.
. Some coronary venous blood drains directly into
the left ventricle. There are pathological reasons
that may result in alveoli with adequate perfu-
sion but inadequate ventilation:
. Blockage of airﬂow to a region of the lungs pre-
vents ventilation. Asthma can also contribute to
a similar mismatch, although not a complete
blockage of ventilation. The natural response of
the body is to divert airﬂow to better-ventilated
Respiratory system 137

regions, which can contribute to hypoxic pulmo-
nary vasoconstriction.
No perfusion
Regions of the lungs with adequate ventilation but
no perfusion can occur, often as a result of pulmo-
nary emboli; they cause the blockage of blood ﬂow
toportionsofthealveoli.Ventilationofthis alveolar
dead space causes two downstream effects:
1 An alkalosis develops in the surrounding tissue,
due to the loss of CO2, which causes bronchiolar
constriction. The constriction contributes to re-
turning the _V = _Q ratio to a suitable value.
2 Alveolar cells become starved due to the lack of
blood reaching them. A prolonged decrease in
perfusion can result in a loss of surfactant
production, which can reduce compliance and
ventilation in an attempt to rematch _V = _Q.
Matched ventilation and perfusion
The vast majority of alveoli in the lungs have a _V = _Q
within acceptable values. The ventilation and per-
fusion of the alveoli vary from the top to the bottom
of the lungs:
. The top of the lungs is well ventilated and rela-
tively poorly perfused, generating a high _V = _Q –
typically around 3.
. The lower regions of the lungs are less ventilated,
although better perfused, resulting in a much
lower _V = _Q – often 0.5.
No perfusion
Should a blockage occur 
within the pulmonary 
vessels, alveoli may be well 
ventilated although, due to 
the lack of perfusion, unable 
to contribute to gaseous 
exchange. Such a situation 
may arise pathologically 
through an embolus.
Shunt
In some cases blood may not 
reach ventilated alveoli, so 
gaseous exchange cannot 
occur and such blood results in 
a depression in the overall PO2 
in arterial blood. 
Matched V/Q
The majority of alveoli receive 
adequate ventilation and a good 
supply of blood, and allow 
gaseous exchange to occur 
supplying the tissues with 
oxygen. The precise ventilation-
perfusion (V/Q) ratio varies 
throughout the lungs between 
around 0.5 and 3.0. Within this 
range the lungs are well adapted 
for efficient gas exchange.
V/Q = ∞
V/Q ≈ 1
V/Q = 0
Figure 7.4 The three-compartment model. The importance of matched ventilation and perfusion is best shown by
comparing the three situations (the two extremes and a balanced system). At the extremes blood will not be
adequately oxygenated as a result of failure of perfusion or ventilation.

Respiratory system

Iftheoverall _V = _Qacrossthelungsismismatched,
it prevents adequate transport of O2 into the blood,
and may also restrict removal of CO2. As a result
both hypoxia and respiratory acidosis may occur.
Gaseous transport
Gaseous exchange in the alveoli
Once gases have reached the respiratory regions of the
airways, their movements into the alveoli and then
into the blood depend primarily on diffusion. The rate
of diffusion is determined by a variety of factors:
. The gradient of the concentrations of the
substance
. The solubility of the substance
. The surface area of the diffusion surface and the
diffusion distance.
Conditions
altering
the
available
diffusion
surface can severely impede the body obtaining
sufﬁcient O2 to function properly. This is seen in
both emphysema and pulmonary oedema.
Oxygen transport
Oxygen reaching the alveoli must diffuse into
the blood for transport to tissues where respiration
can occur. O2 is very poorly soluble in water, so
adequate amounts of oxygen cannot merely dis-
solve. O2 is transported by haemoglobin, which is
contained within erythrocytes, to overcome this
and allow adequate transport.
Dissolved oxygen
A small amount of O2 dissolves in the ﬂuid pro-
portional to the partial pressure. At a PO2 of
100 mmHg (13.3 kPa), there is typically 0.3 mL
O2/100 mL blood, which is insufﬁcient for the
needs of the body.
Erythrocytes
Erythrocytes (red blood cells) are biconcave disc-
shaped cells that are specialised for the transport of
O2 from the respiratory regions of the lungs to the
respiring tissues. The formation and other features
of these cells are discussed in Chapter 6. The struc-
ture of erythrocytes helps their function:
. Erythrocytes contain large amounts of the oxy-
gen-carrying protein haemoglobin.
. Erythrocytes lack a nucleus which would in-
crease the volume available for haemoglobin.
. The biconcave shape of erythrocytes provides a
large surface area to help diffusion while main-
taining a large volume in the cell.
Haemoglobin
Haemoglobin is a globular protein made up of four
polypeptide chains – typically two a chains and
two b chains. Each chain is attached to a haem
group, which is the site of oxygen binding; here O2
binds reversibly to the Fe2 þ irons carried by the
haem group to form oxyhaemoglobin. In the ge-
nome there are typically four copies of genes en-
coding the a chain, and two copies of the genes
encoding the b chain.
Different types of haemoglobin result from
the
presence
of
different
chains
within
the
haemoglobin molecule; three are particularly
signiﬁcant:
1 a chains are found in adult haemoglobin.
2 b chains are found in adult haemoglobin.
3 g
chains
replace
the
b
chain
in
fetal
haemoglobin.
CLINICAL Fetal haemoglobin
In adults, adult haemoglobin (HbA) makes up
around 98% of the haemoglobin found in the body.
In the fetus the predominant type is fetal haemoglo-
bin (HbF), which is made up of two a chains and two
g chains. HbF is not regulated by 2,3-diphospho-
glycerate which allows it to bind O2 with a higher
afﬁnity than HbA.
Haemoglobin disorders
Disorders in haemoglobin cause defects in oxygen
transport. There are two genetic disorders that are
particularly common:
1 Sickle cell anaemia is an autosomal recessive
disorder that is the result of a point mutation in
the b chain of haemoglobin. This causes poly-
merisation of haemoglobin at low oxygen ten-
sions. The clinical implications and basis of the
condition are discussed in Chapter 2.
2 Thalassaemia is caused by the underproduction
of
either
of
the
chains

haemoglobin.
Respiratory system 139

CLINICAL Thalassaemia
Thalassaemia resultsfroma disruptedproductionof
one of the chains in the haemoglobin molecule.
Thalassaemias can be classiﬁed based on the
genes affects:
. a-Thalassaemia: results from disrupted produc-
tion of the a chain. This leads to production of a
haemoglobin molecule containing four b chains.
The phenotype may vary in the number of copies
of the a chain gene that are affected. Although
disruption of a single copy of the gene results in a
silent carrier phenotype, disruption of all four
copies is not compatible with life.
. b-Thalassaemia: is categorised into b-thalas-
saemia minor and b-thalassaemia major. The for-
mer is the heterozygotic phenotype and is usually
asymptomatic, although it can cause a mild mi-
crocytic anaemia. Where there are mutations in
both alleles, b-thalassaemia major results, which
causes a severe hypochromic/microcytic anae-
mia; this requires treatment by blood transfusion.
The oxygen dissociation curve
The four polypeptide chains of haemoglobin act
cooperatively, so that binding of oxygen to one
chain increases the afﬁnity of the other chains for
O2. A sigmoidal relationship results between the
partial pressure of oxygen and its haemoglobin
saturation – the percentage of available oxygen-
binding sites that have been ﬁlled.
At normal arterial PO2 there is almost complete
O2 saturation. In highly metabolising tissues, the
PO2 is lower and this promotes even more rapid O2
unloading. In addition, other factors associated
with active metabolism can promote oxygen dis-
sociation, by shifting the oxygen dissociation curve
(Fig. 7.5):
. Temperature: increases
in
temperature,
as
generated in actively respiring tissues, promote
oxygen dissociation. Active cells undergo more
respiration, thus requiring more oxygen. During
hypothermia, the body’s metabolism slows, the
need for O2 is less and more remains in the
blood.
. H þ ions: increases in respiration can result in
the occurrence of anaerobic respiration, of which
lactic acid is a by-product. In addition, CO2
readily forms carbonic acid. Both signals lead to
an increase in the H þ concentration, which acts
directly on haemoglobin to promote oxygen
dissociation.
. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate: (2,3-DPG)
is
pro-
duced by an isomerase enzyme from 1,3-dipho-
sphoglycerate, an intermediate in glycolysis.
Increased levels of 2,3-DPG act directly on hae-
moglobin to reduce its oxygen afﬁnity. Many
hormones associated with increased metabolism
promote the production of 2,3-DPG, e.g. thyrox-
ine, adrenaline and human growth hormone.
Fetal haemoglobin has a higher afﬁnity for O2
than maternal haemoglobin; as a result of its
ability to bind 2,3-DPG less well, O2 is readily
transferred from mother to child.
Transport of carbon dioxide
Although it is around 20 times more soluble than
O2, only a relatively small proportion of CO2 trans-
port is mediated directly by dissolving into solu-
tion. Three main mechanisms contribute to CO2
transport by the blood:
1 Bicarbonate-mediated transport of CO2
2 Transport by carbamino compounds
3 Dissolution of CO2.
Bicarbonate-mediated transport
Bicarbonate (HCO3
) is responsible for transport
of around 60% of the body’s CO2 through an equi-
librium in the plasma of CO2, carbonic acid
(H2CO3) and bicarbonate; this equilibrium is im-
portant in the regulation of pH. The formation of
H2CO3 from CO2 is catalysed by the enzyme car-
bonic anhydrase and carbonic acid rapidly dis-
sociates into bicarbonate and H þ:
H2O þ CO2 () H2CO3 () H þ þ HCO 
3
HCO3
 is capable of diffusing out of the cell;
however, the cell membrane is impermeable to
H þ, so transport of Cl  into the cell is required
to maintain neutrality of the overall electric charge
across the cell membrane. As H2CO3 is constantly
being removed from the cell, it allows its contin-
uous production from H2O and CO2.
Transport of CO2 by carbamino
groups
The N-terminus of proteins (such as haemoglobin)
contains a free NH2 group, which can combine
with CO2 to produce a carbamino group on the
140
Respiratory system

N-terminus of the protein molecule. This effect is
thought to contribute to around 30% of total CO2
transport.
Dissolution of CO2
Although CO2 is soluble, allowing signiﬁcant trans-
port, in normal conditions this transport mecha-
nism accounts for only around 10% of the total CO2
transport in the blood.
The CO2 dissociation curve
CO2 carriage in the blood related to its partial
pressure forms a much more linear arrangement
than seen with O2. However, there is also a shift in
the dissociation curve related to O2 saturation of
haemoglobin. Haemoglobin reduced through un-
loading O2 more readily accepts H þ ions produced
by splitting of H2CO3. The reduced haemoglobin is
a much better acceptor of H þ ions than oxyhae-
moglobin, promoting the formation of HCO3
 in
low oxygen conditions. Conversely, in oxygenated
blood the ability of haemoglobin to bind Hþ is
reduced, and so in the lungs this promotes the
unloading of CO2 from the blood. The effect of
haemoglobin on CO2 loading is known as the
Haldane effect.
Gaseous exchange between
the blood and respiring tissues
The transport of O2 and CO2 between the blood
and respiring tissues also relies on diffusion.
The respiring tissues are not as highly vascularised
as the lungs; the diffusion distanceto some cells may
be around 40mm, whereas in the alveoli the ﬁgure is
<1 mm. As the demands of the respiring tissues
increase, extra capillary beds open to increase blood
ﬂow and therefore O2 supply. The additional
capillaries also increase the surface area available
for diffusion and reduce the diffusion distance.

Respiratory system 141

Regulatory functions of
the lungs
The lungs are unusual in that the whole circulation
goes through a single organ. This allows the lungs
to regulate and mediate changes to the blood
rapidly. In particular, regulation of gaseous com-
pounds can be achieved by rapid exchange with
the atmosphere. Although most of these processes
are concerned with breathing, regulation of CO2
contributes to pH regulation. The large blood ﬂow
and surface area of the lungs can also be exploited
in the metabolism of blood components.
Acid–base regulation
The major pH buffer in the blood is bicarbonate
(HCO3
) which is in equilibrium with H2O and
CO2 in the blood. Due to this equilibrium, alter-
ation in the CO2 level can be used to temporarily
correct blood pH. Alterations in the dissolved CO2
can shift the equilibrium to modulate H þ levels.
The systemic regulation of this mechanism is dis-
cussed in Chapter 11, although the mechanism
employed by the lungs is described brieﬂy below.
Ventilation of CO2 removes it from the body,
preventing the reaction with H2O and subsequent
generation of Hþ. However, any change in this
mechanism is relatively limited. In the longer term,
alterations to the Hþ balance require changes in
the excretion of Hþ ions from the kidneys; respi-
ratory mechanisms to regulate pH may also be
employed to compensate for metabolic distur-
bances of pH.
Respiratory alkalosis
In cases where there is excess removal of CO2 from
the blood (e.g. prolonged periods at high altitude),
the shift in the equilibrium reduces the H þ con-
centration, causing a respiratory alkalosis. The
lungs also act to compensate for changes in H þ
resulting from other systems, because an increase
in ventilation will be seen to compensate for a
metabolic acidosis.
Respiratory acidosis
If there is restricted ventilation, the PCO2 of the
blood will increase, causing a respiratory acidosis.
The body may restrict ventilation as compensation
secondary to a metabolic alkalosis.
Metabolic function
The large surface area of the lungs can modify
substances and variables in the blood. As a result
a variety of enzymes and signalling molecules may
be altered, inactivated or cleared in the blood:
. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II
predominantly by the angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) expressed on the pulmonary en-
dothelium.BradykininisalsoinactivatedbyACE.
. Prostaglandins,
serotonin
(5-hydroxytrypta-
mine or 5-HT) and noradrenaline are inacti-
vated or removed from the blood by uptake in
the lungs.
. Blood clots and debris may become lodged in
the lungs, removing them from circulation where
they may occlude capillaries in the brain or other
vessels. Although the pulmonary vessels may
become occluded as a result, the blockage can
often be cleared and there is sufﬁcient functional
tissue to avoid signiﬁcant long-term damage.
Rarely, large clots may occur which result in
pulmonary embolism.
Control of ventilation
Ventilation is unusual in that it is under automatic
control which can be heavily overridden by higher
functions. It is possible to hold one’s breath for a
signiﬁcant length of time, or to voluntarily hyper-
ventilate. Most of the time, an individual is not
consciously aware of breathing, and it is regulated
automatically.
Sensors involved in the
regulation of breathing
Automatic control of ventilation ensures that suf-
ﬁcient O2 enters the lungs and CO2 is adequately
removed. There are four types of sensors that pro-
vide information in the regulation of ventilation:
1 Central chemoreceptors
2 Peripheral chemoreceptors
3 Stretch receptors
4 Irritant receptors.
Central chemoreceptors
The central chemoreceptors are located on the
surface of the medulla, near the exit of cranial
142
Respiratory system

nerves IX and X. The chemoreceptors detect
changes in the pH of the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF).
As CO2 freely diffuses across the blood–brain bar-
rier, where it combines with H2O to generate
HCO3
 and H þ. A corresponding change due to
increased CO2 results in a larger pH change in the
CSF than in the blood, as a result of less buffering
by proteins. Central chemoreceptors are thought
to drive over 80% of the breathing response caused
by a change in PCO2.
Peripheral chemoreceptors
The peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the
aortic arch and carotid bodies, at the site of the
bifurcation of the common carotid artery. In hu-
mans, the carotid bodies have a more signiﬁcant
contribution
to
breathing
than
their
aortic
counterparts.
The peripheral chemoreceptors respond to O2,
pH and changes in PCO2 and respond rapidly
enough to detect changes during each breath. They
are responsible for the increased drive that is seen
in hypoxaemia. The carotid bodies are able to
respond to a fall in arterial pH, whereas the aortic
bodies are not.
CLINICAL Response to hypoxaemia
The body’s drive in response to hypoxaemia is
relatively weak. As CO2 is the main regulator of
ventilation, PaO2 must fall to <60 mmHg (8 kPa) for
it to trigger signiﬁcant increases in ventilation so that
loss in O2 is detectable through the signiﬁcant
unloading of oxygen from haemoglobin; this is
reﬂected in the oxygen dissociation curve. Hypo-
xaemia is detected by type I cells in the peripheral
chemoreceptors.
Stretch receptors
Pulmonary stretch receptors in the smooth muscle
of the airways sense distension of the tissues,
signalling via the vagus nerve afferent ﬁbres. The
stretch receptors trigger the Hering–Breuer reﬂex,
which regulates the volume of the lungs to prevent
overinﬂation. If the lungs are inﬂated more than
usual, there is a slowing of breathing such that the
next breath is not as big. Similarly, if the lungs
are deﬂated excessively, the Hering–Breuer reﬂex
anticipates the next breath to promote inﬂation of
the lungs. The Hering–Breuer reﬂex contributes
signiﬁcantly to breathing shortly after birth, but
contributes little in adults.
Irritant receptors
The airways are in contact with the outside world,
which presents a risk of irritants and harmful
particles entering the lungs. Irritant receptors lo-
cated in the walls of the airways sense noxious
stimuli such as cigarette smoke, dust particles and
cold air. The nervous impulses from irritant recep-
tors are transmitted up the vagus nerve and trigger
bronchoconstriction to reduce the risk of the irri-
tant travelling deeper into the airways; the in-
creased breathing aids the expulsion of the irritant
from the lungs. Irritant receptors show rapid ad-
aptation to stimuli and may also respond to me-
chanical stimuli, such as the presence of a foreign
body within the airways.
J receptors are a group of chemoreceptors that
respond to the presence of chemicals within the
blood. Stimulation of the J receptors by the pres-
ence of chemical stimuli within the pulmonary
circulation triggers rapid shallow breathing. J re-
ceptors appear to be activated by an increase in
ﬂuid volume in the alveoli, and may contribute to
the shallow breathing seen in left heart failure and
interstitial lung disease.
C FIBRES
C ﬁbres are found in the connective tissue of the
lungs. These ﬁbres detect mechanical distortion of
the tissue which may becaused byinﬂammation or
oedema, or an irritant. The activation of the ﬁbres
triggers a rapid hyperventilation as well as in-
creased mucus secretion and bronchoconstriction
in an attempt to remove the irritant from the lungs.
Respiratory centres in the brain
In the medulla a natural breathing rhythm is gen-
erated; the medullary respiratory centre is located
in the reticular formation of the medulla. There are
two main groups of cells: those located in the
dorsal region of the medulla are associated with
inspiration, and those in the ventral area are in-
volved in expiration.
The cortex can inﬂuence and override the ac-
tions of the respiratory centres to allow voluntary
control of breathing. Hyperventilation is possible
such that PCO2 can be reduced to half its normal
values, causing respiratory alkalosis. It is possible
to consciously hypoventilate, although to a lesser
Respiratory system 143

extent than seen with hyperventilation. Other re-
gions, associated with emotion (e.g. the limbic
system), can also modulate breathing, as shown
in fear and anger. Two modulatory centres have
been identiﬁed in the pons. Although neither is
essential for breathing, ablation of either results in
abnormal ventilation:
. The apneustic area appears to promote inspira-
tion by exciting the inspiratory area of the
medulla.
. The pneumotaxic centre acts to inhibit inspira-
tion in response to inspired volume.
Disorders of breathing during
sleep
Breathing disorders during unconsciousness result
from the cessation of breathing – an apnoea. Ap-
noeas may be due to a central error in the regula-
tion of breathing or obstruction of the airways.
Some apnoeas may be mixed.
Obstructive sleep apnoeas
Obstructive sleep apnoeas result from the decrease
in muscle activity that occurs during sleep. The
relaxation of the palate may completely obstruct
the airﬂow, despite the activity of the inspiratory
muscles. This state may continue for many sec-
onds and the PO2 will drop whereas the PCO2 rises.
The apnoea ends in arousal as a result of chemical
and mechanical stimuli associated with lack of
ventilation and the increased breathing cycle. Ap-
noea usually causes transition to a lighter stage of
sleep which increases the activity of the airway
muscles. Apnoeas may occur many times an hour,
leading to a poor quality of sleep, and can cause
tiredness during the day.
Central sleep apnoeas
Central sleep apnoeas occur when breathing stops
but the airway remains open – there is no attempt
to breathe and no activation of the inspiratory
muscles. Types of central sleep apnoea can be
described in three groups:
. A defect in the respiratory control system
. Transient ﬂuctuations in the respiratory drive
. Reﬂex inhibition of the central respiratory drive.
Periodic breathing
This is a form of central apnoea in which ventila-
tion increases and decreases in a periodic fashion
due to changes in the respiratory drive.
Cheyne–stokes breathing
This is a type of periodic breathing characterised
by a periodic apnoea in which there is decreased
ventilation, or a series of apnoeas interspersed with
hyperventilation. As a result of this varied pattern
of breathing, the levels of CO2 and O2 within the
blood and alveoli may vary. During consciousness
there is an internal threshold for the level of CO2
within the blood, and during sleep this value is
reset to a different level. Cheyne–Stokes breathing
may occur during the transition to sleep as the new
threshold is set.
CLINICAL Ondine's curse
There are rare cases where there is congenital or
acquired disruption of the automatic control of
breathing. This failure, Ondine’s curse, may become
apparent only while the individual is unconscious,
because, while awake, a patient is consciously able
to control breathing. Such individuals may need to
be ventilated while asleep, because the brain-stem
centres are unable to regulate breathing.
CLINICAL ‘Locked‐in syndrome’
Locked-in syndrome is caused by a lesion that
severs the brain stem from the spinal cord. All four
limbs are paralysed. The patient is also unable to
voluntarily regulate their breathing; the patient can-
not speak as they cannot regulate their breathing
voluntarily. Although the patient experiences emo-
tion and has thoughts, their only way of expressing it
is through their eyes (the oculomotor nucleus that
controls eye movements is intact).

Gastrointestinal system
Thegut breaks food down and absorbsthe products
of digestion in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, while
the waste is compacted and eliminated from the
body. The GI tract is a single tube, around 15 metres
long that is responsible for all these processes.
Supporting organs produce a variety of secretions
toaiddigestion andprocess theabsorbednutrients.
The GI tract also provides a route for removal of
substances not readily cleared by the kidneys.
Features of the abdominal
cavity
The GI tract and its supporting organs are located
mainly in the abdominal cavity, contained within a
thin membranous structure, the peritoneum. The
abdomen also contains organs not associated with
the function of the GI tract. These are discussed in
Chapter 14.
Anatomy of the GI tract
TheGItractis asingle,convoluted tubethatconveys
and processes food. It is aided by the pancreas and
salivary glands which produce enzymes to help
break down ingested material, and the gallbladder
aids the digestion and absorption of fats through the
storage of bile, which acts to emulsify fats. Regions
of the GI tract are specialised to perform speciﬁc
functions that are discussed later in the chapter.
The gut wall
The wall of the GI tract has a common structure
throughout its length, although individual areas
are specialised for particular functions. It is a
muscular tube lined by a mucous membrane
and can be divided into four distinct portions
(Fig. 8.1):
1 The mucosa
2 The submucosa
3 The muscularis propria
4 The adventitia.
The mucosa
The mucosa is the tissue in contact with the lumen
of the gut. It is responsible for the absorption of
digested nutrients through its walls, and is richly
innervated and vascularised to perform this func-
tion. Three distinct layers can be identiﬁed in the
mucosa:
1 The epithelium forms the interface between the
tissue and the lumen and is lined by different
cell types, depending on function of the GI tract
at that point.
2 The lamina propria is the layer of loose connec-
tive tissue beneath the epithelium. It is highly
cellular, containing many lymphocytes and
plasma cells. The lamina propria is highly vas-
cularised and possesses many capillaries and
lymphatic vessels, which transport absorbed
nutrients from the mucosa.
3 The muscularis mucosa is made up of smooth
muscle. The superﬁcial layers are made up of
circular muscle layers whereas the deeper layers
run parallel to the lumen. The activity of
the smooth muscle keeps the glands and tissue
constantly moving, preventing the clogging of
crypts in the tissue and helping the luminal
contents to be in contact with the epithelium
for absorption.

Intestine
The wall of the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract is made up of many different 
layers. The most internal layer is that 
of the GI epithelium, which is arranged 
in a series of folds, to increase the 
surface area in contact with the lumen. 
Immediately below the epithelium is 
the connective tissue in the lamina 
propria, which contains many of the 
vessels supplying and draining the 
epithelium, and the mucosal plexus of 
nerve. Muscularis propria is respon-
sible for contracting the epithelium to 
generate the villi.
Below the mucosa is the submucosa, 
a layer of connective tissue carrying 
the vessels and nerves supporting 
mucosal layer. The major smooth 
muscle of the GI tract is made up of 
two layers: the inner is circularly 
arranged, while the outer is longitudi-
nally arranged. The outermost layer of 
the GI tract is the adventitia, a 
connective tissue covering.
There are three nerve plexus found 
within the GI tract – the most 
prominent are the myenteric plexus, 
found between the circular and 
longitudinal layers of muscle, and the 
submucosal plexus, located in the 
inner layers of the submucosa. Finally, 
there is a plexus of nerves in the 
lamina propria that involved regulating 
the behaviour of the epithelial cells, 
and the secretion and transport of 
substances.
Villi
The epithelial cells on the surface of 
the villi possess a thick brush border of 
microvilli which further increases the 
surface area available for transport. 
The epithelial cells express a wide 
variety of proteins on the surface for 
the transport of nutrients, as well as 
enzymes involved in processing some 
of the substrates.
Transitional region
The cells that form the 
epithelia on the villi are 
derived from the division of 
stem cells within the crypts 
and must replace the villi 
epithelium as it is removed 
by mechanical trauma from 
the ingested material passing 
over it. Those cells that 
develop into absorptive cells 
migrate out of the crypts, and 
as they do so develop the 
characteristic features of the 
villous cells – expressing the 
relevant proteins, and 
developing a brush border. 
The life of a villus epithelial 
cell is typically around 2–4 
days.
Crypt cells
Cells can be grouped into those with one of two
major functions. First, stem cells located at the
base of crypts are those proliferating cells with
progeny that develop into the other cell types found
in the intestinal epithelial layer. The other cell types
found in the crypts are primarily involved in secretion:
• Paneth cells form part of the innate immune
   response, through the secretion of defensins.
• Enteroendocrine cells are involved in the release of
   GI hormones.
• Goblet cells are responsible for the production of
   mucus to lubricate the passage of material
   through the gut.
The basic structure of the mucosa throughout the
gut is conserved, although in each region the
precise structure of the villi and crypts, and the cell
types, vary. Nevertheless, the tissue layers below
the mucosa remain, to an extent, very much
conserved. Within the mucosa the villi vary in terms
of the nature of the cells, while in the small intestine
they possess large numbers of microvilli to allow
absorption; in the large intestine the microvilli are far
less prominent, because mass absorption of
nutrients is no longer needed.
146
Gastrointestinal system

The submucosa
The submucosa is made up of supporting tissue,
namely elastin and collagen, which links the mu-
cosa to the muscular wall of the GI tract. It contains
many of the large blood vessels and lymphatics
that supply the lamina propria as well as the nerve
plexus of the mucosa. The many small parasym-
pathetic ganglia found in the submucosa form the
submucosal plexus.
The muscularis propria
The muscular layer of the gut consists of two layers
of smooth muscle: an inner circular layer and an
outer longitudinal layer. Between the layers is the
myenteric plexus of nerves.
The muscularis propria undergoes synchro-
nised contraction to produce peristaltic waves
that move food through the gut. Although peri-
staltic activity is intrinsic to the smooth muscle,
it is regulated by the enteric nervous system and
hormones, as well as by other environmental
factors.
The role of the gut mucosa
The role of the GI tract gradually changes down its
length and allows classiﬁcation of its mucosa into
four types, based on function:
1 Protective epithelium, found in the oral cav-
ity, pharynx and anal canal, is squamous
in nature and has no role in absorption or
digestion. It acts merely as a conduit or stor-
age region.
2 Secretory epithelium is found only in the stom-
ach and is typiﬁed by many glandular structures
for secreting acid and other factors.
3 Absorptive epithelium is found throughout the
entire small intestine. The mucosa is arranged
in a series of pronounced folds, ‘villi’, which
increase the surface area of the mucosa to in-
crease absorption.
4 Absorptive/protective epithelium in the large
intestine is more closely packed and there are
fewer glands. The cells are specialised primar-
ily for water reabsorption. Clara cells, which
secrete mucus, are also present to lubricate
the gut.
Regional specialisation
of the GI tract
The GI tract contains distinct regions specialised
for distinct functions. Four main regions with dif-
ferent functions can be identiﬁed:
1 The oral cavity is the site of food ingestion.
Physical breakdown occurs through the action
of the teeth, while enzymatic breakdown and
lubrication result from secretions of the salivary
glands.
2 The stomach contributes to physical breakdown
of food and the digestion of proteins. Due to its
low pH, the stomach plays a protective role by
killing pathogens that may contaminate in-
gested food.
3 The small intestine digests food into its consti-
tutive components. It also absorbs the products
of digestion into the blood and lymph for pro-
cessing and use by the body.
4 The large intestine packages the waste from
digestion and regulate of ions through both
secretion and absorption. It predominantly ab-
sorbs water to produce faeces for excretion.
The oral cavity
Food is ingested through the mouth; and detailed
anatomy of the mouth is discussed in Chapter 14.
The mouth performs several functions related to
the breakdown of food:
. Mechanical breakdown of food is achieved by
the action of the teeth.
. Secretion of saliva aids the shaping of food into a
bolus and lubricates it for travel to the stomach
via the oesophagus.
. Salivary
amylase
initiates
the digestion
of
carbohydrates.
Figure 8.1 The basic structure of the mucosa. The basic structure throughout the gut is conserved, although
in each region the precise structure of the villi and crypts, and the cell types of which they are composed, vary.
Nevertheless, the tissue layers below the mucosa remain very much conserved. Within the mucosa the villi
vary in terms of the nature of cells; although the small intestine possesses large numbers of microvilli to allow
absorption, in the large intestine they are far less prominent, because mass absorption of nutrients is no longer
needed.

Gastrointestinal system 147

The oesophagus
The oesophagus is a long muscular tube that con-
nects the mouth with the rest of the GI tract. It runs
in the neck posterior to the trachea and slightly to
the left of the midline. After this it runs within the
posterior mediastinum, through the thorax, before
penetrating the diaphragm and joining with the
stomach.
The oesophagus is made up of an inner circular
layer of muscle and an outer longitudinal layer and
is lined with squamous epithelium. The type of
muscle making up the oesophagus walls changes
down its length:
. The upper third is made up of striated (skeletal)
muscle.
. The lower third is made up of smooth muscle.
Stomach
The stomach is a dilated region of the gut, with a
distinct role and structure. It secretes many com-
pounds, in both an endocrine and an exocrine
manner, performing a variety of functions:
. It continues digestion of carbohydrates initiated
within the oral cavity.
. It adds acid to the food to kill pathogens and
promote protein digestion.
. It helps digestion of lipids by the production of
gastric lipase.
. It secretes intrinsic factor to enable absorption
of vitamin B12.
. It breaks down food into a thick soup –chyme – to
increase the effective surface area available to the
enzymes that continue digestion.
The stomach, when empty, is not much bigger in
diameter than the large intestine, although it is
capable of expanding signiﬁcantly so that it may
hold 2–3 litres of food in an average individual.
Grossly, the stomach is a dilated region of the
intestines, in the shape of the letter J.
Mucosa
In places the surface epithelium of the stomach
protrudes into the lamina propria to form gastric
pits, into which many glands enter. Different
regions of the stomach contain different cell
types with different functions. Six main cell
types related to digestion are found within the
stomach:
1 Simple epithelium lines the gastric mucosa.
The cells secrete mucus which forms a thick
layer to protect the stomach walls from the
stomach acid.
2 Parietal (oxyntic) cells are found in the upper
parts of the gastric glands. These pyramidal cells
have a single central nucleus, many mitochondria
and a deep central invagination. Their major role
is the secretion of acid, produced from the disso-
ciation of H2CO3 mediated by the enzyme car-
bonic anhydrase. The secretion is regulated by a
variety of mechanisms discussed elsewhere. In-
trinsicfactor,whichis crucialfor the absorption of
vitamin B12, is also produced by the parietal cells.
3 Mucous cells are located in the neck of gastric
pits, between the parietal cells. They possess
many granules at their apical surface and have
their nuclei located near to the base. Their pre-
cise function is not clear.
4 Chief (zymogenic) cells are found in the lower
regions of the gastric glands. The cells have large
amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
and contain granules of the protein pepsinogen.
When released into the acidic stomach, the pep-
sinogen becomes activated by cleavage to form
the enzyme pepsin.
5 Enteroendocrine cells in the base of gastric
glands secrete a variety of hormones.
6 Stem cells are mainly found in the neck region of
the gastric glands. These cells divide rapidly to
replace epithelial cells in the gastric pits and on
the surface of the stomach.
The pylorus of the stomach possesses gastric pits
with many glands that secrete lysozyme as well as
the products discussed earlier, and there are many
gastrin-secreting cells (G-cells), which are involved
in stimulating acid secretion. Other enteroendo-
crine cells are also present, secreting many differ-
ent hormones.
Small intestine
The small intestine is the ﬁnal site of food diges-
tion. It absorbs the products of digestion and
secretes hormones regulating appetite and other
processes. This part of the GI tract is 6–7 metres
long and consists of three main sections, which
share many common adaptations:
1 The duodenum
2 The jejunum
3 The ileum.
148
Gastrointestinal system

The duodenum
The duodenum is the ﬁrst and shortest part of the
small intestine, immediately distal to the stomach.
It forms a C-shaped region located near the head of
the pancreas.
The duodenum provides the point of entry of
the common bile duct into the intestines at the
ampulla of Vater; it marks the boundary between
the derivation of the intestines from embryological
foregut and the midgut.
The jejunum and ileum
The jejunum and ileum together contribute a
huge length to the intestines – around 6–7 metres
in an average individual. The jejunum starts at
the duodenojejunal ﬂexure and the ileum ends
at the ileocaecal junction, which marks the tran-
sition from small to large intestines. Although
there is no deﬁned boundary that demarcates
the transition, there are a variety of clinically
important distinctions between the jejunum and
ileum:
. The jejunum is slightly wider than the ileum.
. The jejunum is more vascularised.
. The vascular arcades, the loops of arterial vessels
that supply the intestinal tissue, differ. In the
jejunum, the arcades consist of a few large
arterial loops, whereas in the ileum there are
many much shorter loops.
. The mesentery of the jejunum is less fatty than in
the ileum.
. Peyer’s patches are more commonly found in
the ileum
Organisation of the mucosa in the
small intestine
The small intestine is adapted for the absorption of
nutrients into the body. The surface area is in-
creased in the small intestine though the formation
of villi and crypt structures:
. The small intestine is also pulled into large
folds, each of which further increases the poten-
tial area of contact between the digestive mixture
and the tissue.
. Villi are ﬁnger-like projections of the mucosa,
which are produced through contraction of the
muscular tissue within the mucosa.
. The apical surfaces of the villous epithelial
cells possess many microvilli. These minute
projections further increase the surface area in
contact with the intestinal lumen.
The progressive damage caused by food results
in the progressive loss of cells from the villi, which
must be replaced by new cells derived from stem
cells in the intestinal crypts.
The crypts of Lieberk€uhn
Deep crypts between the villi contain many cells
types that differ from those found on the villi.
They have a variety of different functions,
including:
. Production of secretions to help digestion and
lubricate the mucosal surface
. Replacement of cells lost from the villi or crypts.
These are produced by differentiation of stem
cells at the base of the crypts.
The cell types in the small intestines
The cell types found in the villi are mainly involved
in the absorption of digested substances. Within
the crypts of Lieberk€uhn there are other cells that
are differentiated for secretion:
. Absorptive cells make up almost all the cells
on a villus. The cells possess a ‘brush border’
on the apical surface, which is made up of a
layer of densely packed microvilli. Moreover,
there are enzymes and transporters bound
to the apical surface to facilitate the last
stages of digestion ready for mediation of
absorption.
. Goblet cells are found between the absorp-
tive cells and increase in frequency along the
length of the small intestine. The goblet cells
secrete mucus that lubricates the lining of
the gut.
. Paneth cells are located deep in the crypts
of Lieberk€uhn. They secrete lysozyme and
other antimicrobial substances (e.g. defen-
sins) to control the growth between the in-
testinal ﬂora and prevent the colonisation of
pathogens.
. M (microfold) cells are specialised cells found
over Peyer’s patches. The M cells do not have a
basement membrane to help transport antigens
to Peyer’s patches.
. Stem cells located at the base of the crypts
proliferate at a constant rate. The rate of prolif-
eration is relatively slow, because the daughter
Gastrointestinal system 149

cells also possess signiﬁcant proliferative activ-
ity. Daughter cells progressively differentiate as
they travel up the walls of the crypt to replace the
absorptive cells that have been removed through
mechanical damage. They also replace all the cell
types found in the crypts.
Lamina propria and serosa of the small
intestine
The lamina propria of the small intestine projects
into the villi carrying blood vessels, lymphatics,
nerve ﬁbres and smooth muscle cells. Many
leukocytes, found below the lamina, provide
an
immunological
barrier
to
protect
against
infection.
The muscularis mucosa is relatively consistent
throughout the small intestine. However, in the
duodenum the submucosa contains many coiled
tubular glands, known as Brunner’s glands. These
glands secrete an alkaline ﬂuid, which contributes
to the neutralisation of the stomach acid and cre-
ates an environment for the optimum activity of
pancreatic enzymes.
The lamina propria and submucosa of the small
intestine possess regions of lymphoid tissue in-
volved in the immune response – Peyer’s patches.
These are important in the adaptive immune re-
sponse in the gut and are found on the side of the
tissue opposite the mesentery. There are usually
around 30 Peyer’s patches in the small intestine,
mostly in the ileum.
Large intestine
The large intestine does not contain the folds or
villi seen in the small intestine. Glands in the large
intestine are characterised by many goblet and
absorptive cells, and a few enteroendocrine cells.
The cells of the large intestine have three main
functions:
1 The large numbers of the goblets cells produce
mucus to lubricate the intestinal surface.
2 Theabsorptive cells reabsorb waterfrom the gut
lumen for the active transport of Na þ out of the
lumen.
3 The large intestine is the site of formation of
faecal mass for subsequent elimination.
The large intestine contains many lymph cells
that extend into the submucosa, and are likely to be
required to control the large bacterial population
present.
Features of the large intestine
The large intestine is made up of the caecum,
appendix, and the ascending, transverse, descend-
ing and sigmoid colon. There are four major fea-
tures that allow the distinction of large intestine
from small intestine:
1 Taeniae coli: these are three thickened bands of
muscle that make up most of the longitudinal
muscle in the large intestine. As the taeniae are
shorter in length than the large intestine, they
cause the large intestine to adopt a sacculated
shape.
2 Haustra: these are large folds (sacculations) that
are found within the large intestine as a result of
the short nature of the taeniae coli.
3 Omental appendices: small fatty projections are
found inthe omentum aroundthe largeintestine.
4 Calibre: the large intestine has a far greater
diameter than the small intestine.
CLINICAL Appendicitis
Acute inﬂammation of the appendix is a common
cause of acute abdominal pain. Appendicitis may
be caused in young people by hyperplasia of the
lymphoid nodes locatedaround the appendix. With-
in older individuals appendicitis probably results
from accumulation of faecal matter. The blockage
causes swelling of the appendix, resulting in irrita-
tion of the visceral peritoneum.
Initially, appendicitis causes referred pain to the
periumbilical region of the abdomen – the appendix
and the periumbilical skin are both innervated by
nerve roots entering the spinal cord at T10. More
acute pain develops later due to direct irritation of
the peritoneum. Thislocalisesto a point two-thirdsof
the way from the umbilicus to the midinguinal point –
referred to as McBurney’s point.
Acute infection may sometimes result from throm-
bosis of the appendicular artery. This can lead to
ischaemia or gangrene and perforation of the in-
ﬂamed appendix, which can contribute to infection
of the peritoneum – peritonitis.
Acute appendicitis is often treated surgically
through an appendicectomy.
The vasculature of the gut
The vascular supply of the gut develops in accor-
dance with the embryological derivation of the gut
150
Gastrointestinal system

tissue. Three major vessels supply the gut, each
arising directly from the abdominal aorta:
1 The coeliac artery supplies foregut derivatives
and originates from the abdominal aorta imme-
diately after it passes through the diaphragm.
2 The superior mesenteric artery supplies the
midgut and arises at the level of L1.
3 The inferior mesenteric artery supplies the
hindgut derivatives, and arises at the level of L3.
The course and details of their supply are
covered in Chapter 14.
The hepatic portal circulation
Blood draining from the intestines is rich in ab-
sorbed nutrients, many of which require processing
before being released into the systemic circulation.
As a result, a specialised circulation has evolved
whereby the blood from the GI tract drains into the
hepatic portal vein, which transports it to the liver.
In the liver, the portal blood passes through a
second capillary bed, allowing the absorption of
the products of digestion into the hepatocytes, and
the subsequent release of suitable products of pro-
cessed nutrients into the systemic circulation. The
liver is drained by the hepatic veins, which drain
directly into the inferior vena cava.
The portosystemic anastomoses
The portal and systemic venous circulation must
meet at various points. These anastomoses can
form varicosities – swellings – in the case of portal
hypertension. There are three major sites of
anastomosis:
1 Oesophageal veins may drain into either the left
gastric vein (part of the portal circulation) or the
azygos vein (part of the systemic circulation).
2 The veins draining the rectum contribute to
bothcirculations.Thesuperiorandmiddlerectal
veins drain into the portal vein, whereas the
inferior rectal vein contributes to the systemic
circulation.
3 The paraumbilical veins in the anterior abdom-
inal wall may anastomose with the superior
epigastric veins of the portal circulation.
Enteric nervous system
The gut possesses its own complex system of neu-
rons, which make up the enteric nervous system.
The enteric nervous system is thought to contain
over 100 million neurons, arranged in a complex
fashion. These receive inputs from both the sym-
pathetic and the parasympathetic nervous sys-
tems, as well as receiving sensory afferents and
sending out effector neurons.
The enteric nervous system is localised in two
plexus:
1 The myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus is found
between the longitudinal and circular layers of
muscleinthemuscularispropria.Itisinvolvedin
regulating motility within the gut.
2 The submucosal (Meissner’s) plexus is found
between the circular muscle layer in the muscu-
laris propria and the longitudinal muscle layer in
the muscularis mucosae. It is associated with the
regulation of transport of ﬂuid and ions across
the luminal boundary.
Though it receives a whole host of inputs, an
isolated enteric nervous system can respond to
internal stimuli to control peristalsis, secretion and
absorption effectively. The ENS also triggers re-
lease of secretions from supporting organs, such as
the gallbladder.
Supporting organs
in the gut
The gut requires the support of many organs, to
provide enzymes that mediate digestion and se-
cretions to modulate the conditions within the GI
tract so that they are optimal. Moreover, the ab-
sorbed products of digestion must be processed to
allow them to be used by the rest of the body. Four
CLINICAL Portal hypertension
Theﬂowofbloodthroughtheportalveinmaybecome
blocked – most frequently due to ﬁbrosis and scar-
ring within the liver itself (e.g. cirrhosis). As pressure
in the portal vein rises, the ﬂow of blood through
anastomotic sites within the systemic circulation
will increase. The increased pressure causes the
walls of the anastomoses to swell and potentially
rupture. In particular, rupture of the oesophageal
varices causes severe, often fatal, bleeding.
The enlargement of the paraumbilical veins can
lead to the formation of caput medusae – which look
like snakes radiating from the umbilicus.
Gastrointestinal system 151

main organs can be identiﬁed that help the func-
tion of the gut:
. The liver is responsible for receiving and proces-
sing most of the products of digestion. It also
produces bile, which is essential for the absorp-
tion of lipids
. The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile.
. The pancreas is the main secretory gland of the
GI tract, producing many of the enzymes essen-
tial for the breakdown of ingested food.
. The salivary glands release many digestive en-
zymes into their secretions. Unlike the other
structures, the salivary glands are not located
within the abdomen.
Liver
The liver is a large solid organ located in the upper
right quadrant of the abdomen. It receives the
blood supply draining from the intestines, and
hence most nutrients that have been absorbed
from the gut. The liver also contributes secretions
to the intestinal tract.
Features of the liver
Theliveristhelargestsolidorganinthehumanbody
and is made up of left and right lobes which are
delineated by the falciform ligament that attaches it
to the peritoneum. The right lobe is further subdi-
vided into quadrate and caudate lobes by the gall-
bladder and the ﬁssure for the ligatmentum teres.
The hepatic blood supply
The liver receives two blood supplies, each with
different functions:
. The hepatic artery is a branch of the coeliac
trunk that contributes around 30% of the total
blood ﬂow to the liver. The hepatic artery sup-
plies the tissue with oxygen for respiration, being
derived directly from the aorta.
. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 70% of
the total blood to the liver. It is formed from the
veins draining the gut, spleen and pancreas, and
carries the nutrients absorbed from the gut to the
liver, as well as hormones secreted by the endo-
crine pancreas.
Histology of the liver
The liver is covered by thin connective tissue, the
stroma, which encloses the hepatocytes, the basic
cell type. The capillary vessels in the liver, sinu-
soids, have a particularly irregular vessel wall, so
that the blood cells may escape the vessels and
bathe
the
liver
cells
themselves.
Specialised
macrophages – the Kupffer cells – are found in the
sinusoids (Fig. 8.2).
The hepatocyte
The hepatocyte is the predominant cell type within
the liver. Hepatocytes group together into liver
lobules, which usually have portal spaces at their
corners, where the portal triad can run. The he-
patocytes are responsible for performing most of
the functions of the liver. Functionally, the liver
may be split into units known as acini, which
represent regions that deliver blood to the same
draining vein.
The hepatocyte itself is a cell with six or more
sides and is around 25 mm in diameter. It pos-
sesses many mitochondria and large amounts
of smooth ER, although there are differences
depending on the distance of the cells from the
portal triad. Each hepatocyte is in direct contact
with blood through gaps in the endothelium of
the sinusoids.
At sites where hepatocytes meet they generate a
space between them – a bile canaliculus. This is
the ﬁrst stage of the bile duct system and is sealed
by tight junctions. Gap junctions between hepa-
tocytes are common, allowing communication be-
tween the cells.
The portal triad
About three to six portal triads supply an individual
liver lobule. Each triad consists of three vessels – a
venule, an arteriole and a lymphatic vessel – and a
duct:
. The venule is derived from the hepatic portal
vein and normally represents the largest vessel in
the triad.
. The arteriole is a branch of the hepatic artery.
. The duct carries bile to the hepatic duct from
where it may enter the gallbladder or gut.
Sinusoids
The sinusoids are made up of irregular blood ves-
sels that contain plates of endothelial cells, so that
blood can leak out of the vessel and surround the
hepatic cells. Blood can enter the subendothelial
space of Disse where it is in direct contact with the
hepatocytes, allowing rapid exchange of solutes as
152
Gastrointestinal system

well as uptake and secretion of many macromo-
lecules. The sinusoids also contain many macro-
phage-like Kupffer cells which are involved in the
removal of senescent red blood cells and the di-
gestion of haemoglobin, as well as having immune
functions.
The biliary ductal system
The bile ductal system carries liver secretions to
the intestine. The cells lining the bile duct are
remarkably similar throughout. These epithelial
cells are joined by tight junctions that limit the
ﬂow of water or solutes between the bile and the
plasma. They are adapted for secretion and ab-
sorption, allowing them to regulate the composi-
tion of the bile. The biliary tree is organised as
follows:
. The initial ducts that contribute to this system
are the small bile canaliculi on the opposing
surfaces between two hepatocytes.
. The canaliculi contribute to progressively larger
vessels which anastomose to drain into the in-
terlobular bile ducts, which are carried in the
portal triads.
. The common hepatic duct emerges from the
liver and merges with the cystic duct to form the
common bile duct.
The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct
both emerge in the small intestine through the
sphincter of Oddi at the ampulla of Vater.
Gallbladder
The gallbladder is a small organ located between
the left and right lobes of the liver. It stores and
concentrates bile. The body and neck of the gall-
bladder are surrounded by peritoneum that binds
it to the liver. The liver and the gallbladder are also
connected by ﬁbrous tissue layers.
The gallbladder is supplied by the cystic artery,
a branch of the right hepatic artery, and is

vessels provide hepatocytes with a mixture of nutrient-rich portal venous blood and oxygen-rich arterial blood,
which bathes them. Hepatocytes process the nutrients and release the products into the blood, which is drained into
a central vein and carried to the hepatic vein. The portal vein also contains a bile duct that drains bile to the
gastrointestinal tract and gallbladder.
Gastrointestinal system 153

drained by the cystic vein into the portal circula-
tion. It receives innervation from the parasympa-
thetic and sympathetic nervous systems, as well
as sensory innervation through the right phrenic
nerve.
CLINICAL Gallstones
If bile is too concentrated it may accumulate into
deposits of gallstones. Although small gallstones
easily pass into the gut, larger stones may block one
of the ducts or damage the wall of the gallbladder
itself. Surgical removal of the gallbladder may be
required to prevent repeated inﬂammation. Gall-
stones are particularly common in women aged
over 40 and in obese individuals, as a result of
excess cholesterol.
Pancreas
The pancreas is the main secretory gland in the GI
tract. It can be divided into two components:
1 An endocrine pancreas is involved in the regu-
lation of blood sugar and other metabolic pro-
cesses – discussed in Chapter 10.
2 An exocrine pancreas which secretes digestive
enzymes.
Structure and location
The pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ that lies
behind the stomach across the abdomen, sothat its
head is located between the spleen and the duo-
denum, with the transverse colon attached to its
anterior margin.
The histology of the exocrine
pancreas
The exocrine tissue of the pancreas, similar to the
salivary glands, is made up of acini. These are
consist of several serous cells that empty into a
central duct. Between the acini of the pancreas are
centroacinar cells, which are the terminal cells
lining the ducts. The acinar cells are highly po-
larised and possess many zymogen-containing
granules.
The supporting tissue of the pancreas is made up
largely of collagen and contains many capillaries to
supply the acinar cells. The pancreas itself is sur-
rounded by a capsule of connective tissue which
penetrates the pancreas, dividing it into lobules.
The acini are separated from each other by a richly
vascularised basal lamina.
Salivary glands
Salivary glands are exocrine glands that secrete
into the mouth. The saliva produced has a role in
lubricating the passage of food and initiating di-
gestion as well as some immunological functions.
Many small salivary glands are found throughout
the mouth. In addition, there are three large pairs
of glands:
. The submandibular
. The sublingual
. The parotid.
The secretory cells of the salivary
glands
There are two main groups of cells that can be
identiﬁed within the gland structure, these con-
tribute different components to the saliva:
. Serous cells
. Mucous cells.
Serous cells
Serous cells are pyramidal – they have a narrow
apical membrane that has small microvilli. Serous
cells contain many mitochondria, reﬂecting the
energy requirements for transport of ions. Typi-
cally the cells are formed in a spherical mass – an
acinus – which has a lumen at the centre leading to
the duct.
Mucous cells
Mucous cells are cuboidal or columnar and re-
sponsible for the secretion of mucus-like compo-
nents into the salivary gland secretions. In the
submandibular gland, the tubules are organised
in a characteristic pattern – mucous cells are found
in tubules that are capped at the ends with serous
cells.
Myoepithelial cells
These are often known as basket cells and sur-
round the acini of serous cells. Myoepithelial cells
possess muscular elements that allow contraction
to expel the glandular secretions.
154
Gastrointestinal system

The ductal system of the salivary
glands
The secretory portions of the glands empty into
intercalated ducts, which are lined by cuboidal ep-
ithelium. The intercalated ducts join to form inter-
lobular structures, which further converge to form
striated ducts and then excretory ducts. The main
ducts of the salivary glands empty into the mouth.
The large salivary glands are encased in ﬁbrous
connective tissue, which also divides them into
lobes.
Vasculature and innervation
of the salivary glands
The vessels and nerves enter the glands and form a
branching structure to supply the lobules. The duc-
tal systemof theglandsisalsohighly innervated and
vascularised. Parasympathetic innervation directly
stimulates secretion of the glands. There is no direct
sympathetic innervation to the secretory tissue of
the duct;sympatheticstimulationofthevasculature
alters blood ﬂow to the gland, although this has less
effect than parasympathetic stimulation.
Gut motility: transport
and mechanical
breakdown of food
The gut must efﬁciently transport food along its
length, so that the different functions that contrib-
ute to the digestion and absorption of nutrients
from food and the formation of faeces from waste
can occur. The muscular action of the gut also
contributes to the breakdown of food, particularly
within the stomach where the muscular actions
contribute to converting ingested food into chyme.
Chewing and swallowing
The ingestion of food occurs in the mouth which is
the site of the initiation of digestion – both chem-
ical and mechanical. The resulting bolus of food is
shaped by the tongue and passed into the rest of
the gut through the act of swallowing.
Mechanical breakdown of food begins with the
action of the teeth, three types of which are found:
Incisors are located at the front of the mouth and
possess a single thin cutting edge, allowing the
cutting of food such as fruit and vegetables.
Canines are located further back in the mouth and
possess a single point or cone, adapted for the
tearing of meat.
Premolar and molars are wider teeth located in the
backofthemouth.Theirﬂatterandwidersurface
area allows the grinding and crushing of food.
Children typically have 20 primary (milk teeth)
which are lost as they grow and replaced by per-
manent secondary teeth. On either side of each jaw
children possess (from front to back):
. Two incisors – one medial and one lateral
. One canine
. Two premolars.
Adults possess 32 teeth. On each side of the jaw,
thepermanentteethontheupper andlower jaware:
. Two incisors
. One canine
. Two premolars
. Three molars: these include the ‘wisdom teeth’
which may not erupt until the later teens and
frequently have to be removed because there
may not be sufﬁcient space for them to sit in the
mouth.
The structure of a tooth
Each tooth has a common structure of three dis-
tinct parts:
1 The root is located beneath the gingiva (gums)
and attaches the teeth into the jaw.
2 The crown is the part of the tooth that is exposed
within the mouth and is responsible for the
chewing action of the tooth.
3 The neck connects the crown to the root.
Most of the tooth is made up of dentine, a
calciﬁed tissue that contains hydroxyapatite in
higher concentrations than found in bone. The
exterior of the tooth is covered in a layer of enamel,
which is the hardest substance in the human body,
consisting of over 90% calcium salts. At the centre
of the tooth is the pulp, a connective tissue con-
taining the supporting cells in the tooth. The pulp
is highly innervated and vascularised.
Vasculature and innervation
The superior and inferior alveolar arteries supply
the upper and lower teeth, and are supplied by the
maxillary and mandibular arteries, respectively.
The teeth are innervated by the maxillary and
mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve.
Gastrointestinal system 155

Swallowing
After ingestion of food and its mechanical break-
down in the mouth, it must be swallowed and
transported to the stomach via the oesophagus.
There are a series of steps that transport food from
the mouth to the stomach:
. The tongue pushes the food up against the roof of
the mouth to form a bolus.
. The ﬁrst stage of swallowing is voluntary and
causes the muscles of the larynx and tongue to
guide the food into the oesophagus, as a result of
constriction of the constrictor muscles in the
pharynx. The epiglottis prevents food from en-
tering the trachea.
. The bolus of food is pushed down the oesopha-
gus by a wave of constriction behind the food.
Stomach motility
The food enters the stomach through the oesoph-
agus. The stomach is responsible for mixing the
food and adding many secretions to help digestion,
particularly of protein. Mixing occurs mainly in the
pylorus of the stomach. Small amounts of food can
be forced into the small intestine through the
pyloric sphincter for continued digestion and ab-
sorption of nutrients.
The fat and acid contents of the stomach can be
sensed, as can the state of breakdown of the bulk of
the food. Local hormone secretion can alter the
rate of gastric activity while chemoreceptors signal
to the central nervous system (CNS); this can mod-
ulate activity, particularly via activity of the auto-
nomic nervous system.
Storage of food in the stomach
The release of food from the stomach into the
small intestine occurs slowly. The stomach re-
tains food to release it into the bowels at a slow
rate, even after ingestion of large quantities of
food. If too much food has been ingested, a
dumping syndrome may result, when the stom-
ach empties too early leading to dramatically
altered osmolality in the gut.
Peristalsis
Peristalsis is the process by which food is propelled
through the gut. The process is tightly regulated
and also involves non-propulsive contractions of
the gut, which help both the breakdown and the
absorption of the food.
GI motility in the small intestine
The small intestinal smooth muscle can generate
both propulsive and non-propulsive movements.
Non-propulsive movements
Such movements are associated with mixing of the
food:
. Segmentation occurs as a result of contraction of
the circular smooth muscle in the muscularis
mucosa. The gut divides into compartments
around 5–10 cm long; this allows mixing of food
in the gut and modulation of the properties of
individual compartments.
. Pendular motion can be induced in individual
compartments, whereby the compartment and
its contents are moved back and forth vigorously
to mix the contents.
Propulsive movements
Food is passed along the intestines as a result of
contraction of the circular muscle behind the bo-
lus. The longitudinal muscles in the gut also help
the process by moving the walls of the intestine
over the food. In the small intestine peristaltic
movements that move the food from the duode-
num to the jejunum result from myenteric reﬂexes
and not from CNS involvement.
Movement of food from the small intestine to
the large intestine occurs through the ileocaecal
valve. Several reﬂexes and stimuli
aid this
process:
. Sensors within the gut may detect stretch (me-
chanoreceptors), chemical stimuli (such as lipids
or aromatic amino acids) or irritants.
. Intrinsic smooth muscle activity results from
large migrating motor complexes. These are
waves of electrical activity (accompanied by
muscular contraction) that migrate down the
small intestine during fasting.
. Hormonal signals can modulate the motor
activity in the gut.
Defecation
The rectum stores faeces until a suitable time for
voiding. The peristaltic actions that aid the
156
Gastrointestinal system

expulsion of faeces are coordinated in part by the
enteric nervous system.
Retention of faeces and voiding
Faeces are stored in the rectum at low pressure,
although pressure can be rapidly increased by the
myenteric reﬂexes. There are both voluntary and
autonomic components to voiding: reﬂex path-
ways can increase the abdominal pressure and
allow relaxation of the sphincters, although the
pelvic ﬂoor is under somatic control.
The anal sphincter is made up of two layers.
1 The inner layer is made up of both circular and
longitudinal layers of smooth muscle, under
involuntary control.
2 The outer layer is made up of striated muscle
controlled by both involuntary and voluntary
pathways.
Both layers are maintained by a variety of inhib-
itory nerves, which release acetylcholine or nitric
oxide. During voiding, adrenergic nerves release
noradenaline which acts on a1-adrenoceptors
found on the muscle cells in both layers to trigger
contraction.
During
voiding,
peristaltic
activity
in
the
colon triggers the movement of the contents of
the colon into the rectum. The sensory nerve ﬁbres
in the gut wall provide the CNS and enteric nervous
systems with information about the state of the
rectum which, when appropriate, signal the need
for voiding. This triggers the rectosphincteric re-
ﬂex which both stimulates the inhibition of the
anal sphincters and triggers reﬂex peristalsis in the
rectum to expel the contents. To prevent voiding,
the external anal sphincter can be voluntarily stim-
ulated to contract, i.e. prevent unwanted voiding of
faeces, until a suitable time.
Pharmacological modulators
of gut motility
Conditions may arise that result in either de-
creased or increased gut motility.
Laxatives
Laxatives are used to help gut immotility resulting
from inadequate hydration or decreased bowel
movement. Initial treatment attempts to counter
the precipitating factors, through alteration of the
hydration and ﬁbre within the diet. In addition,
some drugs may cause constipation, as can
immobility. There are four major classes of laxative
with different mechanisms of action:
1 Lubricants
2 Bulk formers
3 Osmotic laxatives
4 Motility stimulants.
Lubricants
The typical lubricant laxative is liquid parafﬁn.
Lubricants help the motility of faeces through the
gut, although they do nothing to rectify the under-
lying cause of the constipation.
Bulk formers
Bulk formers stimulate activity in the gut, decreas-
ing the transit time of food through the gut. This
helps the retention of water within the colon,
which in turn helps lubricate the gut. Fibre in the
diet is a bulk former, and where possible such
natural bulk formers (e.g. oats and bran) are used.
Sterculia, a large polysaccharide that is not di-
gested, is often used clinically.
Osmotic laxatives
Osmotic laxatives act by promoting the retention
of water in the colon, increasing both the faecal
bulk and the lubrication. They are rarely used as a
front-line treatment for constipation because it is
difﬁcult to control the dose so that diarrhoea does
not result. Osmotic laxatives do not address the
underlying cause of the constipation.
Motility stimulants
Motility stimulants act to vigorously promote peri-
staltic activity through either direct actions on the
gastrointestinal smooth muscle or stimulation of
the enteric nervous system. Motility stimulants can
promote extremely strong contractions and, as a
result, are frequently contraindicated after gut sur-
gery. Bisacodyl is an example of a motility
stimulant.
Treatment of diarrhoea
Diarrhoea can result from a variety of different
causes which may warrant different treatments.
Frequently, treatment focuses on the correction
of water loss or ion imbalance by oral administra-
tion of isotonic solutions. Often this is accompa-
nied
with
glucose
or
starch,
which
helps
absorption.
Gastrointestinal system 157

If diarrhoea is a result of infection, treatments
that reduce gut motility are contraindicated be-
cause there is a risk that they may prolong infec-
tion. In diarrhoea caused by diet, kaolin, an ad-
sorbent agent, may be used.
Antiemetics
Drugs that prevent vomiting act by antagonising
receptors which may contribute to triggering vo-
miting. H1- and H3-receptor histamine antagonists
and muscarinic antagonists all have antiemetic
effects.
Antiemetics are often used to combat the side
effects of other therapeutic agents:
. Domperidone, the dopamine antagonist can be
used with chemotherapy drugs, which frequently
trigger vomiting.
. Prochlorperazine, another dopamine receptor
antagonist maybe administered to prevent the
vomiting and nausea that results from adminis-
tration of morphine for pain relief.
Secretion and digestion
in the gut
Most digestive enzymes enter the gut through the
ducts at the ampulla of Vater that link the gut to the
gallbladder, pancreas and liver. These organs pro-
vide most of the secretions responsible for catalys-
ing the breakdown of food into its constituents.
The secretory organs supporting the GI tract recy-
cle the ﬂuid and secretions, so that the total volume
of ﬂuid that is secreted into (and reabsorbed from)
the gut each day far exceeds the volume of ﬂuid
ingested.
Salivary enzymes
The total secretion of the salivary glands is around
1 litre of ﬂuid a day – most of which (80–90%) is
produced by the major salivary glands: the parotid,
submandibular and sublingual. Saliva contains a
mixture of ions, mucins and enzymes with both
protective and digestive qualities, and has a variety
of functions:
. Moistening of the mucosa
. Salivary amylase is responsible for initiating
digestion of carbohydrates
. Lubrication – for eating and for speech
. Protection from potential pathogens.
Formation of saliva
Initially, the secretion from serous cells of the
salivary glands is isotonic. Anions (Cl , HCO3
)
are secreted by a symporter (although not the
classic cystic ﬁbrosis Cl  transporter), as is K þ.
The movement of Na þ is passive, following the
movement of anions. Human saliva is typically
alkaline as a result of the presence of HCO3
 in
the secretions. The ionic composition of saliva
varies with the ﬂow rate, due to the progressive
reclamation of ions:
. At low ﬂow rates Na þ and Cl  are reabsorbed
while K þ is secreted. This generates a hypotonic
solution.
. At higher ﬂow rates the salivary secretions are
more similar to plasma in their composition,
because there is less time for the transporter to
remove secreted ions. Nevertheless human saliva
is typically hypotonic and contains higher levels
of K þ than plasma.
Proteins in saliva
Protein components are secreted into saliva, which
can be divided into three main groups:
1 Enzymes are secreted to initiate the ﬁrst steps of
digestion. In particular a-amylase breaks down
starch, whereas salivary lipase initiates fat
digestion.
2 Mucins are antimicrobial and lubricate the food,
to allow easy passage in the pharynx and
oesophagus.
3 Proline-rich proteins are antimicrobial and lu-
bricants. In addition they have been implicated
in
binding
Ca2 þ
and
strengthening
tooth
enamel.
Regulation of secretion
Secretion is regulated in a complex manner, re-
quiring the integration of both central and sensory
inputs. The CNS nuclei regulating salivation are
located at the junction of the pons and medulla.
They receive inputs from taste buds and tactile
senses, as well as from higher centres. The salivary
nuclei stimulate the parasympathetic system to
trigger secretion. Sympathetic stimulation can af-
fect blood ﬂow to the gland to reduce activity.
158
Gastrointestinal system

The stomach and gastric acid
The secretions of the stomach into the GI tract can
be broken down into four groups:
. Stomach acid is secreted to kill pathogens and
help the activity of other secretions.
. Mucus is secreted to protect the mucosa from
acid.
. Pepsin and other enzymes are secreted to digest
food.
. Intrinsic factor is secreted to protect vitamin B12
from degradation by acid.
The mechanism of gastric acid
secretion
The secretion of gastric acid is due to the activity of
the Hþ/Kþ ATPase, which actively transports Kþ
into the parietal cells in return for secretion of Hþ.
The K þ is able to leave the parietal cells through Kþ
channelsallowingittore-enterthestomach(Fig.8.3).
Regulation of H þ secretion
The pH of the stomach is around 2.5, creating a
potentially dangerous environment. As a result the
level of H þ secretion is tightly regulated at a variety
of different levels:
. Paracrine regulation is achieved by the entero-
chromafﬁn-like (ECL) cells, which secrete hista-
mine; this triggers H þ release through its action
on H2-receptors.
. Parasympathetic nerves derived from the vagus
can release acetylcholine, which acts directly on
M3-receptors on parietal cells to stimulate H þ
release. In addition, acetylcholine can act on the
ECL cells to stimulate histamine release.
. Gastrin, a GI hormone, is released by cells within
the GI tract, and can act through the cholecys-
tokinin B (CCK-B) receptor found on both pari-
etal cells and ECL cells.
In most cases, increased acid secretion results
from a second messenger cascade within the pa-
rietal cells, which in turn results in the insertion of
additional H þ/K þ ATPase proteins into the cell
membrane.
Enzyme secretion in the stomach
The chief cells of the stomach release pepsins into
thegut.Thesearestoredwithinthecellsasgranules
of inactive zymogens (known as pepsinogen). The
low pH of the gut triggers cleavage of the inactive
pepsinogens into their active pepsin form, which is
irreversiblyinactivatedinthesmallintestinesbythe
neutral pH. The action of pepsins in the gut ac-
counts for around 20% of protein digestion.
CLINICAL Peptic ulcers and
Helicobacter pylori
An ulcer is an area of damage within an epithelium. In
thestomachthismayoccurasaresultofacideroding
away the mucosa if the mucus layer is insufﬁcient.
A peptic ulcer may lead to a haemorrhage, which is a
relatively common complication. The continual dam-
age and repair of the mucosa can promote neoplas-
tic changes in the epithelial cells, which may result in
the formation of a gastric carcinoma.
The typical causes of gastric ulcers are:
. Diet: smoking, alcohol and hypoglycaemia have
all beenlinkedto an increasedrisk of developing a
stomach ulcer
. Excess acid: this may be due to hypoglycaemia
or, very rarely, a gastrin-secreting tumour in
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome
. Loss of mucosal protection due to defective
mucus secretion
. The presence of H. pyl ori infection has been
shown to be a common factor in gastric ulcer.
Elements of the bacterium are thought to mimic
molecules expressed by the gastric epithelium,
promoting an autoimmune attack.
Treatment of gastric ulcers aims to remove the
predisposing factors. Typically antibiotics are given
to treat H. pyl ori infection. Dietary factors such as
alcohol and smoking must also be removed. Finally,
stress is a signiﬁcant predisposing factor that can
be targeted.
CLINICAL Zollinger–Ellison syndrome
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is an extremely rare
condition that results from the presence of a gas-
trin-secretingtumour,oftenwithinthe pancreas. The
tumour triggers the unregulated secretion of stom-
ach acid, which precipitates damage to the lining of
the stomach and the small intestine.
Secretion of mucus
Mucus is made up of large numbers of mucin
glycoproteins that are secreted by the neck cells
of the gastric glands. It lines the stomach in a
thick coat to protect it from the highly acidic
environment that it has developed. To help

H+ regulation
The ion transport processes resulting in production 
of HCl by the parietal cells have three major steps 
associated:
1. CO2 and H2O are able to freely enter the cell    
by diffusion where carbonic acid catalyses the          
production of H+ and H2CO3. The H2CO3 leaves  
the cell by exchange with Cl–, which enters the 
stomach lumen through an apical channel. H+ is 
pumped out of the basolateral membrane by 
exchange with Na+, allowing the regeneration of 
H2O and CO2 from the H+ and HCO3–.
2. The Na+ that enters the cell through the Na+/H+ 
exchanger has done so down an electrochemical 
gradient generated by the Na+/K+ ATPase, which 
has transported K+ into the parietal cell.
3. K+ leaves the cell through channels in the    
apical membrane and is then returned to the 
cytosol by the K+/H+ exchanger, allowing the 
pumping of H+ into the stomach to lower the pH.
Hormone regulation
The secretion of H+ to acidify the stomach lumen 
is tightly regulated. This regulation involves 
inputs from both the nervous and the endocrine 
systems, which may work directly on the parietal 
cells, or indirectly via the enterochromaffin-like 
(ECL) cells.
Direct stimulation of the parietal cells is achieved 
by the actions of the hormone gastrin, or through 
the release of acetylcholine from nerves that 
synapse with the parietal cells. These stimuli 
trigger an increase in acid secretion.
Indirect stimulation occurs through the release of 
histamine from ECL cells, which triggers 
increased H+ secretion by parietal cells. The 
release of histamine is triggered either by gastrin 
or through acetylcholine released from nerves 
that synapse with the ECL cells.
Figure 8.3 Stomach acid. This is produced by the parietal cells, which transport H þ and Cl  into the cell lumen
through a complex series of ion transports. The process of H þ transport is tightly regulated directly by nervous and
hormonal signals or through paracrine interactions with enterochromafﬁn-like cells.
160
Gastrointestinal system

protection, the secretion of mucus and stomach
acid is regulated by similar stimuli.
The surface epithelium of the stomach also se-
cretes a watery ﬂuid that is high in K þ and HCO3

which makes the mucus alkaline, further protecting
thestomachliningfrom the acid. The mucins retain
the HCO3
 close to the lining of the stomach,
preventing it from neutralising the stomach acid
entirely. This arrangement allows the surface of the
stomach to be maintained at a neutral pH, despite
the cavity of the stomach having a highly acidic pH.
The pepsins active in the stomach are capable of
cleaving some of the bonds in the mucins; as a
result the mucus lining of the stomach must be
constantly replenished.
Intrinsic factor
Although the highly acidic environment helps to
kill potentially harmful bacteria, and the digestion
of proteins, it is also capable of mediating the
breakdown of vitamin B12 which is essential for
correct synthesis of DNA and fatty acids.
The body has developed a method of overcom-
ing this degradation, through the production of
intrinsic factor. This glycoprotein is produce by
the Parietal cells and binds Vitamin B12 within the
stomach, protecting it from the action of stomach
acid and degradative enzymes.
Production of intrinsic factor is the only essential
function of the stomach, because it safeguards vita-
min B12, without which pernicious anaemia results.
CLINICAL Pernicious anaemia
Vitamin B12 is essential for cell division. Owing to
their large turnover, red blood cells are the ﬁrst cells
affected by a lack of vitamin B12. Pernicious anae-
mia results from a deﬁciency in intrinsic factor,
usually caused by the body’s production of auto-
antibodies against it. As a result, vitamin B12 is
degraded in the stomach. Treatment is typically
regular injections of vitamin B12, thus bypassing
the need for intrinsic factor.
Digestion of protein
There are groups of enzymes responsible for the
digestion of proteins:
1 Stomach: digestion of protein is mediated by the
acid-dependent enzymes secreted into the gut,
e.g. pepsin.
2 Pancreatic and intestinal secretions mediate
most protein digestion, cleaving large polypep-
tide chains into many small peptides.
3 The membrane-bound enzymes include many
aminopeptidases
and
dipeptidases,
which
cleave small peptides into single amino acids
for transport out of the lumen.
Pancreatic enzymes
The pancreatic secretions contain many en-
zymes, secreted in their inactive form as proen-
zymes. The major proenzymes secreted are
trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen and procarbox-
ypeptidase which are activated in a series of
cleavage reactions initiated by enterokinase in
the intestinal mucosa. Enterokinase acts on
trypsinogen to convert it to active trypsin. Tryp-
sin is, in turn, capable of cleaving trypsinogen,
chymotrypsinogen and procarboxypeptidase in-
to their active forms.
Trypsin, chymotrypsin and other pancreatic
enzymes cleave proteins into small fragments,
accounting for about 50% of protein digestion.
Trypsin, chymotrypsin and proelastase are all en-
dopeptidases, which cut the polypeptides at inter-
nal sites to produce oligopeptides. In contrast,
procarboxypeptidases cleave amino acids directly
from the carboxyl terminal of the peptide to release
single amino acids for absorption.
The role of brush border peptidases in
the digestion of peptides
The action of the various gastric and pancreatic
proteases results in the formation of single ami-
no acids and many small peptides. The brush
border peptidases cleave the small peptides into
single amino acids for transport out of the
lumen.
The digestion of carbohydrates
Carbohydrates supply around 50% of body en-
ergy requirements. They are ingested in varying
lengths, from single sugar monosaccharides up
to long polysaccharides, which are made up of
many monosaccharides joined by glycosidic
links. As the intestines can absorb only single
sugar
monosaccharides,
polysaccharides
are
broken down into their constituent monosac-
charides. There are some large polysaccharides
that the body is unable to break down; these
form ﬁbre.
Gastrointestinal system 161

Much of the carbohydrate in the diet is supplied
as starch, which is broken down by three series of
enzymes:
1 Salivary amylase initiates the breakdown of
starch into oligosaccharides. Salivary amylase is
not crucial to the breakdown of polysaccharides,
and is inactivated by stomach acid.
2 Pancreatic a-amylase hydrolyses internal links
in the starch to release many oligosaccharides.
Pancreatic amylase secretion is triggered by the
gut hormone CCK.
3 Membrane-bound enzymes act in combination
to convert a variety of oligosaccharides into their
constituent monosaccharides which are readily
absorbed into enterocytes.
Membrane digestion of
oligosaccharides
The brush border of the small intestine expresses a
variety of enzymes that can break down oligosac-
charides into their constituent monosaccharides:
. Sucrase splits sucrose into glucose and fructose,
. Maltase breaks down the a-1,4 linkages found in
straight chains of oligosaccharides,
. Lactase breaks down lactose into glucose and
galactose.
. Isomaltase is found bound to the enzyme su-
crase and can catalyse the breakdown of a-1,6
linkages found in polysaccharides.
CLINICAL Lactase deﬁciency
Lactase deﬁciency is relatively common, and oc-
curs after weaning. In people with the condition,
ingestion of lactase results in cramps and diar-
rhoea. Many factors may alter the effect of lactase
deﬁciency, including colonisation of the gut by
lactose-metabolising bacteria. Treatment of the
condition is to reduce intake of dairy products or
to use products treated with lactase.
Bile and the digestion of fats
Bile is a product of the liver that serves three
functions:
1 To emulsify fat in ingested food to aid its ab-
sorption from the gut
2 To neutralise stomach acid, producing a mild
alkaline environment in which pancreatic en-
zymes function optimally
3 As a mechanism to excrete the products of the
breakdown of haemoglobin and other sub-
stances not removed by the kidneys.
Bile is made up of a variety of different
components:
. Bile acids act to emulsify lipids, which increases
the surface area on which the lipolytic enzymes
may act. Once a high enough concentration is
reached, the bile acids can induce the lipids to
form micelles.
. Lecithin increases the amount of cholesterol that
can be solubilised within the micelles.
. Bile pigments are excreted products of haem
metabolism.
The formation of bile and its reabsorption form a
cycle, allowing a large volume of bile to be secreted
while the total pool of bile in the body is kept low,
and little is lost in the faeces (Fig. 8.4).
Formation of bile acids
Bile salts and bile acids are synthesised by hepa-
tocytes. Cholesterol derivatives may also be con-
verted into bile acids, providing the major route for
excretion of cholesterol from the body.
Bile pigments
Bile pigments are the excreted products of the
breakdown of haem. The release of iron from the
haem group of haemoglobin releases a carbon
structure that is rapidly processed into bilirubin.
The cytochrome P450 pathway and other path-
ways in the hepatocytes can conjugate bilirubin
to other molecules, such as glucuronate. A variety
of organic ions is also secreted into bile, in partic-
ular, anions, various prostanoids and derivatives of
eicosanoic acid, as well as organic cations. Many
antibiotics and other drugs are broken down by the
liver, and the resulting components of breakdown
are often secreted into the bile.
The storage and concentration of bile
The gallbladder stores bile and concentrates it for
release during digestion. The Na þ/K þ ATPase on
the basolateral membrane of gallbladder epithelial
cells draws H2O out of the lumen by transcellular
and paracellular routes. The net action of the
transporters in the biliary epithelium leads to the
progressive addition of H þ into the bile, neutralis-
ing the HCO3
 that is already present.

Liver
The liver is the major site of processing of bile. It is capable of 
producing bile from the cholesterol, as well as absorbing other 
cholesterol derivatives from the blood which, in turn, are converted to 
bile salts. Finally, those bile salts that have been reabsorbed from the 
intestines are returned to the liver through the portal circulation. 
Bile is secreted out of the bile ductal system and stored in the gall 
bladder until it is required for release to the intestines to aid the 
emulsification and absorption of fats.
Gall bladder
The gall bladder is located in 
contact with the liver and serves 
as a repository for bile, in 
between meals. Within the gall 
bladder, the epithelium aids the 
concentration of bile through the 
removal of water and ions from 
the fluid. Bile is released from 
the gall bladder and enter the 
intestine through the common 
bile duct into the second part of 
the duodenum.
Intestine
In the intestine, bile emulsifies 
ingested fats to aid their 
absoprtion. As a result a large 
proportion of the bile released 
through the bile duct is 
reabsorbed into the bloodstream, 
though a small proportion 
escapes and is excreted.
Blood
Bile and its precursor 
molecules are transported on 
the blood stream at low 
concentrations. In particular, 
those bile molecules 
reabsorbed from the gut reach 
the liver through the portal 
vessels. A small amount of bile 
will reenter the systemic 
circulation, where it can be 
excreted by the kidneys. In 
cases where is are defects in 
the excretion and processing of 
bile by the GI tract the body 
becomes more dependent on 
the kidney as a mechanism of 
bile excretion, and this is 
associated with jaundice, since 
the kidneys are less able to 
fulfil this function.
Kidney
Physiologically the vast 
majority of processing of bile is 
achieved by the liver, though a 
small amount  can be 
processed and removed from 
circulation by the kidneys. The 
resulting metabolites are 
excreted within urine. If there is 
a defect in the GI processing of 
bile, the kidneys become the 
major route of excretion – as is 
reflected by the darkening of 
the urine associated within 
increased bile.
Blood
Figure 8.4 The enterohepatic circulation. The pool of bile salts is small; as a result several times the total volume
is secreted and reabsorbed from the gut each day, with only a small proportion being excreted. This process
occurs primarily in the gut, although a small amount of bile that is reabsorbed is also excreted by the kidneys.
Gastrointestinal system 163

DEFINITION Conjugated and
unconjugated bilirubin
Bile pigments are categorised as conjugated and
unconjugated, which affects their fat and water
solubility:
. Unconjugated bile pigment is not joined to an
acid. Haem released from the breakdown of se-
nescent red blood cells is converted into uncon-
jugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bile pigments are
fat soluble and transported around the body
bound to albumin. If the level of free unconjugated
bile rises in the body jaundice may result.
. Conjugated bile pigment is attached to charged
molecules such as taurocholate. These are water
soluble, although they can be reclaimed from the
gut by a Na þ-dependent transporter. This regu-
lation and the inability to diffuse across lipids
account for the preferential excretion of conjugat-
ed bile salts from the gut.
CLINICAL Jaundice
Jaundice describes the yellow colour, particularly
prominent in the eyes and the skin, that results from
high levels of bile pigment present in the blood and
extracellular spaces.
Bilirubin, the breakdownproduct of haemoglobin,
is responsible for causing jaundice. Typically un-
conjugated bilirubin is present at <0.5 mg/L. Jaun-
dice becomes apparent at levels around three times
higher than this and often results from the destruc-
tion of red blood cells, leading to the rapid release of
bilirubin from the breakdown of haemoglobin.
Ifthereisdamagetotheliverorbileductsystem,the
excretion of conjugated bilirubin may not be possible,
resultinginitenteringthesystemiccirculation.Inthese
cases, the soluble conjugated bilirubin can be ﬁltered
by the kidneys, causing urine to become very dark in
colour, often accompanied by a light colour in the
faeces. A measurement of the free and conjugated
bilirubin in the blood allows determination of whether
or not jaundice has an obstructive origin.
The circulation of bile
Only a small proportion of bile salts is excreted;
most are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and
transported back to the liver, from where they are
re-secreted by the hepatocytes. The total bile acid
pool is relatively small, and may be secreted several
times over during the course of a meal. Each day,
around 20% of the bile acid pool must be replen-
ished to make up for what has been excreted from
the body.
The breakdown of fats
Lipids are hydrolysed in the gut through reactions
catalysed by lipases, to generate fatty acids and
glycerol, which can be readily absorbed in the
intestines. The action of bile helps to maintain a
stable emulsion, which prevents formation of mi-
celles and coalescence of the lipid droplets. Bile
acids are relatively insoluble in either lipids or
water, although at the interface between the two
they are very soluble. Lipases are secreted all along
the GI tract to break down fats:
. Gastric lipase functions well at the low pH of the
stomach and breaks down triglycerides into a
fatty acid and a diglyceride. There is no absorp-
tion in the stomach, and the products of break-
down are transported to the small intestines.
. Pancreatic lipase is responsible for most lipid
digestion outside the stomach. The gut mucosa
releases CCK in response to fats entering the
intestine, and this triggers the release of bile from
the gallbladder and of pancreatic lipases from the
pancreas.
. Other lipases are secreted by the pancreas, such
as cholesterol esterases, which can hydrolyse
lipid esters and phospholipase A2; this can act
against glycerophospholipids.
Absorption of nutrients
After ingestion and breakdown into its consti-
tuents, food must be absorbed into the body for
processing and use in a variety of metabolic
processes.
Absorption from the stomach
Water and ethanol and some other small mole-
cules can be absorbed from the stomach itself. The
stomach is also the site of absorption of some
classes of drugs. However, for most substances,
signiﬁcant absorption does not occur until the
small intestines where the surface area is vastly
greater.
164
Gastrointestinal system

Absorption of carbohydrates
After the action of various amylases and other en-
zymes, saccharides must be absorbed from the gut.
The rate-limiting step is the transport of the sugars,
not the hydrolysis reaction to generate monosac-
charides. As a result, there can be a build-up of
monosaccharides in the lumen during digestion.
There is a variety of transport mechanisms that
absorb monosaccharides from the gut and trans-
port them to the portal circulation (Fig. 8.5):
. Glucose and galactose compete for transport by
the sodium–glucose transport proteins (SGLTs)
expressed on the brush border. The SGLT1
transporter transports monosaccharides via sec-
ondary active transport as a result of the Na þ
gradient. The transport of glucose and galactose
out of the cells across the basolateral membrane
occurs in a Na þ-independent manner by the
low-afﬁnity GLUT2 transporter.
. Fructose transport from the gut lumen is
achieved through Na þ-independent facilitated
diffusion by the glucose transporter GLUT5. This
transport does not compete with glucose across
the
luminal
membrane,
although
transport
across the basolateral membrane is competitive.
Absorption of proteins
A variety of different mechanisms of protein ab-
sorption occurs in the gut. Although, in most cases,
the amino acids are required for the synthesis of
new proteins, there are occasions when the ab-
sorption of a whole protein is crucial.
Pinocytic transport of proteins
In newborn babies, passive immunity in the gut
and bloodstream is mediated by maternal antibo-
dies carried in the milk. These antibodies can be
transported intact across the gut mucosa by
pinocytosis.
Peptide transport in the gut
There is a H þ-driven system of transport in the gut
to allow the transport of small peptides across the
enterocytes.
Amino acid transport system
in the gut
The amino acids generated by the cleavage of
peptides are transported across the brush border
Na+
SGLT1
GLUT5
GLUT2
2K+
3Na+
The three major monosaccharides – 
glucose, galactose and fructose – may be 
absorbed across the apical surface by one 
of two proteins. Glucose and galactose are 
transported into the cell by the SGLT1 
transporter, where transport is driven by 
co-transport of Na+ down its concentration 
gradient. Fructose is transported across the 
apical surface of the cells by the Na+-
independent GLUT5 transporter. All three 
monosaccharides leave the cell across the 
basolateral membrane through the 
Na+-independent GLUT2 transport protein, 
which allows the sugars to enter the portal 
circulation from where they are transported 
to the liver and around the body.
Figure 8.5 Carbohydrates. These are broken down into small chains of saccharides. Enzymes on the epithelial
surface further these oligosaccharides down break to single monosaccharide blocks.
Gastrointestinal system 165

by various proteins with overlapping speciﬁcities.
These speciﬁcities ensure that all the required
amino acids can be absorbed by the body.
There are both Na þ-dependent and -indepen-
dent transporters. In particular, there are Na þ-
independent transporters for cationic and large,
branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, many
of which are essential because they cannot be
synthesised in the body. There are genetic defects
that result from the absence of a functional version
of one or more of these amino acids transporters.
These disorders are often associated more with
defects in the production of urine, because many
of the same proteins are expressed in the gut and
kidney.
CLINICAL Hartnup's disease
Hartnup’s disease is an autosomal recessive con-
dition caused by a defect in the neutral amino acid
transporter. This protein is expressed in the intes-
tines and the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of
the kidneys, and is particularly important in regu-
lating the transport of tryptophan. Defects in this
transporter result in increased excretion of trypto-
phanin theurine, becauselessisreclaimedfromthe
nephron, which compounds the decreased absorp-
tion from the gut. There is still some uptake of
tryptophan from the gut through oligopeptide trans-
port systems – which function normally.
Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and the
precursor for such molecules as serotonin and
melatonin, as well as being a component of many
proteins. Defects in its transport are detected early
as a failure to thrive and photosensitivity. In addition,
there are neural symptoms, particularly tremor, nys-
tagmus and intermittent ataxia.
Treatment is through tryptophan supplements
and a high-protein diet.
Absorption of lipids
Most lipids in the gut are found in a liquid phase. In
the diet, lipids are made up of triglycerides, free
fatty acids, cholesterol and cholesterol esters, as
well as the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K). In
the gut, the lipids are formed into micelles for
absorption (Fig. 8.6):
. The effects of mechanical and enzymatic break-
down of lipids lead to the generation of a lipid
droplet emulsion.
. Progressive addition of bile salts promotes the
conversion of droplets into vesicles that contain
many concentric lipid bilayers.
. These develop into single bilayer vesicles and
ﬁnally into mixed micelles, made up of bile salts
and mixed lipids.
Mixed micelles are able to diffuse close to the
surface of the enterocytes, where they encounter
an acidic environment generated by the Na þ/H þ
exchanger. The acidic environment is thought to
help transport lipids into the cells. It is not clear
which route is predominant in the transport of
lipids out of the GI tract:
. Direct diffusion across the brush border
. Incorporation into the lipid bilayer
. Protein-mediated transport.
Processing of lipids in the enterocyte
The enterocytes absorb the components of lipid
breakdown and package them with proteins to
form chylomicrons – a large form of lipoprotein.
Chylomicrons are released from enterocytes and
enter the lymph because they are unable to pass
through the windows/pores in the blood capillar-
ies. They pass to the thoracic duct and re-enter the
blood supply at the left subclavian vein from when
they are taken up and absorbed by other tissues, in
particular the adipocytes.
Essential fatty acids
Although the body can easily synthesis most lipids
required for membrane structures, only limited
fatty acids must be obtained from the diet. The
body is unable to insert a double bond in a fatty
acyl chain beyond carbon-9, which is required in
some fatty acids associated with signal transduc-
tion, particularly the arachidonic acid metabolites.
As a result, the precursor fatty acids, linoleic acid
and linolenic acid, are essential components of
the diet.
Absorption of vitamins
The transport of vitamins differs for those that are
water soluble and those that are fat soluble.
. Water-soluble vitamins (B and C) are trans-
ported mainly by protein transporters although,
if they are ingested in high enough doses, they
may be absorbed by simple diffusion. Vitamin
B12 absorption requires the presence of intrinsic
166
Gastrointestinal system

factor, which protects the molecule from break-
down in the gut.
. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) are ab-
sorbed from mixed micelles. They are able to
diffuse directly into the intestinal epithelial cells
even in the absence of bile salts. The vitamins are
then released into the portal blood for transport
from the gut.
Lipids
The lipids are not water 
soluble. As a result the 
body produces bile salts 
and other molecules that 
organise the lipids into 
small micelles in the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, 
which diffuse into the 
acid zone surrounding 
the epithelium. Here 
many components can 
be protonated and enter 
the cells through 
carrier-mediated 
transport. In addition the 
micelles may be 
absorbed by diffusion 
across the cell 
membrane, or incorpora-
tion into the cell 
membrane
Emulsion 
Ingested lipids are broken down to fatty 
acids and other derivatives by lipases. 
This, coupled with the mechanical action 
of the GI tract, results in the formation of 
an emulsion, where large droplets of 
lipids, consisting of several bilayers 
coating a lipid core, are produced.
Multilamellar vesicle
The progressive addition of bile salts to 
an emulsion produces multilamellar 
vesicles, which bud off from the larger 
droplets. They share a similar basic 
structure to the droplets, consisting of 
many concentric lipid bilayers surround-
ing a lipid core.
Unilamellar vesicle
Further addition of bile salts to the 
vesicles results in a ‘thinning out’ of the 
vesicle so that it consists of a single 
bilayer.
Micelle
The progressive addition of bile salts to a 
unilamellar vesicle produces a micelle, 
which consists of a single layer of lipids 
with the hydrophilic heads facing 
outwards, in contact with the water, 
whereas the hydrophobic tails all point 
inwards. Micelles are able to diffuse  
close to the epithelium. Here compo-
nents may become protonated and enter 
the cell by carrier-mediated transport, or 
the micelle may enter the cell by diffusion 
and/or through incorporation into the cell 
membrane.
Unstirred layer

Ca2+
Ca2+ is absorbed across the 
apical surface of the epithelium 
through an intestinal epithelial 
channel. However, within the 
cell high levels of Ca2+ are 
highly toxic, due to its role as a 
major second messenger. To 
overcome this problem, high 
levels of the Ca2+-binding 
protein, calbindin, are 
expressed to ‘ferry’ Ca2+ across 
the cell.
Transport across the basolateral 
surface is achieved both by the 
Ca2+ ATPase in an active 
transport mechanism, or 
through the Na+/Ca2+ 
exchanger, which is driven by 
the presence of a Na+ gradient 
across the cell membrane. The 
transport of Ca2+ out of the cell 
generates a gradient between 
the intestinal lumen and cell 
interior that promotes the entry 
of Ca2+ into the cell from the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
Iron transport
Iron can be obtained from the 
diet in two forms: as Fe2+ ions, 
or complexed within haem. In 
each case, there are specific 
proteins for the transport of the 
ion complex into the cell. Here 
the enzyme haem oxygenase 
promotes the breakdown of 
haem, to release Fe2+.
The Fe2+ must be complexed to 
calreticulin within the cell, 
because free Fe2+ is highly 
toxic. This mechanism allows 
transport across the cell for 
release into the bloodstream. 
Fe2+ is not transported within 
the blood as a free ion; rather it 
is release bound to the protein 
transferrin.
Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 is bound to intrinsic 
factor in the gut to prevent its 
breakdown, and it remains 
bound to this molecule on its 
passage through the GI tract, 
where it is absorbed into the 
cells through a receptor 
recognising the vitamin 
B12–intrinsic factor complex. In 
the cytoplasm of the intestinal 
cells, the vitamin B12 and the 
intrinsic factor are separated, 
and the vitamin B12 molecule 
released into the portal 
circulation.
168
Gastrointestinal system

Absorption of minerals and water
The vast majority (around 99%) of the water and
mineral present in food and gastrointestinal secre-
tions is absorbed. Typically, around 2 litres of ﬂuid
is ingested each day, and about 7 L of secretions is
released into the gut, yet only 100 mL water is lost
in faeces each day. The remainder is absorbed
along the GI tract (Fig. 8.7):
. The duodenum does not contribute much to
reabsorption of water, because the ﬂuid present
is predominantly isotonic.
. The jejunum and ileum absorb a signiﬁcant
proportion of ﬂuid.
. The colon accounts for most of the ﬂuid reab-
sorption from the gut.
Reabsorption of Na þ
The net ﬂow of Na þ is out of the GI tract into the
blood, although both secretion and reabsorption
occur. Absorption occurs down an electrochemical
gradient across the apical membrane of the intes-
tinal epithelium. This electrochemical gradient is
created by the Na þ/K þ ATPase expressed in the
basolateral membrane. The rate and mechanism of
absorption vary along the length of the gut:
. Thenet rate of absorption of Na þ is highest in the
jejunum, where it is coupled to the transport of
glucose, galactose and amino acids in Na þ-
dependent secondary active transport.
. In the ileum, there is less absorption, due to the
lower concentration of amino acids and sugars,
as well as less Na þ being present.
. In the colon, the Na þ is reabsorbed against a
large electrochemical gradient. Although plasma
Na þ is around 120 mmol/L, in the lumen of the
colon Na þ may be around 25 mmol/L.
Absorption of Cl  and HCO3

Absorption of these anions occurs mostly in the
jejunum. Although Cl  continues to be reabsorbed
in the ileum, HCO3
 is secreted only when the
concentration in the lumen is less than about
45 mmol/L, after which the net effect is reabsorp-
tion. Transport of anions in the colon is similar to
that in the ileum.
Absorption of K þ
K þ is reabsorbed partly by solvent drag in the
jejunum and ileum, resulting from the reabsorp-
tion of H2O, which generates a K þ gradient. In the
colon, there is usually net secretion of K þ as a
result of the negative electrical potential in the
colon.
Absorption of Ca þ
Ca2 þ can be rapidly absorbed in the duodenum
and jejunum over a large concentration gradient,
which is generated as a result of active transport of
ions across the basolateral membrane. The Ca2 þ is
transported across the cells by the Ca2 þ-binding
protein calbindin, which allows the transport of
high levels of Ca2 þ across the cytosol, generating
insoluble salts within the cell.
Transport of Ca2 þ across the basolateral mem-
brane is achieved by three mechanisms:
1 The Ca2 þATPase transports Ca2 þ across the
basolateral membrane, using energy generated
by the hydrolysis of ATP.
2 The Na þ/Ca2 þexchanger also removes Ca2 þ
from the cell.
3 Ca2 þ contained in vesicles may be extruded
across the basolateral membrane via exocytosis.
Ca2 þ reabsorption is tightly regulated by vita-
min D and parathyroid hormone; it forms part of a
far larger and more complex system of calcium
homoeostasis, including effects on Ca2 þ absorp-
tion in the gut.
Absorption of iron
The level of iron in the body is regulated at the
point of absorption. Although about 15–20 mg iron
is ingested per day, only about 0.5–1 mg of this is
absorbed by normal men. Iron depletion, such as
Figure 8.7 The transport of many essential molecules and ions across the gut wall is achieved through a variety of
transport mechanisms, requiring specialised transporters and channels. Carbohydrates need transportby a variety
of mechanisms, some of which are driven by a Na2 þ gradient. Many ions present a problem because they are toxic
tocells inhighconcentrations; inthe caseofcalcium,thisproblemisovercomeby a transportproteinin thecells and,
in the case of iron, by a blood-borne transport molecule. Finally, vitamin B12 needs the presence of intrinsic factor for
its passage through the gut, to avoid degradation in the stomach.
3
Gastrointestinal system 169

from haemorrhage, promotes increased absorp-
tion of iron from the gut. Growing children and
pregnant women, in particular, absorb greater
amounts of iron than men.
Iron is ingested in inorganic iron salts or as part
of haem groups. About 20% of the ingested haem
iron is absorbed – enzymes in the gut can release
the haem groups from their attached proteins, and
haem is then taken up in the gut by facilitated
diffusion. Iron is released from haem in the epi-
thelial cells, so that no intact haem enters the
bloodstream from the gut.
Absorption of haem
Haem (Fe3 þ) iron can bind a speciﬁc transporter
on the surface of the enterocytes, or alternatively
may be absorbed by endocytosis. In the entero-
cyte, the Fe3 þ ion is released by enzymatic cleav-
age of the haem ring and reduction to Fe2 þ
Absorption of Fe2 þ
Iron absorption is hindered because it tends to
form insoluble salts and complexes, which are
more soluble at lower pH, so the low pH of the
stomach promotes iron absorption.
Vitamin C promotes the absorption of iron; it
associates with Fe3 þ and its acidic nature reduces
Fe3 þ to Fe2 þ, which forms fewer insoluble com-
plexes. There are two methods of absorption of
Fe2 þ:
1 Transferrin can bind to Fe2 þ in the gut. The
Fe2 þ–transferrin complex can then be taken up
into the enterocyte by receptor-mediated endo-
cytosis. In the cell Fe2 þ and transferrin dissoci-
ate and the Fe2 þ (including that derived from
haem degradation) is transported in the cell
bound to the protein mobiliferrin.
2 A divalent cation transporter in the duodenum
can
transport
free
Fe2 þ
directly
into
the
enterocytes.
Fe2 þ ions are then transported across the baso-
lateral membrane where they can bind plasma
transferrin for transport around the body within
the plasma.
Absorption of other ions
Other ions that are required body are obtained
from the diet, in particular:
. Magnesium is absorbed along the length of the
intestine. About 50% of the dietary intake is
absorbed.
. Copper is absorbed in the jejunum, so that about
50% of the ingested amount is absorbed. Copper
may also be secreted in the gut, bound to some
bile acids.
Changes in ion transport along
the villus
The nature of transport changes along individual
villi in relation tothe maturity of the epithelial cells:
. The mature cells towards the tips of the villi are
net absorbers of ions and water.
. Immature cells nearer the crypts are net secretors
of ions and water.
Processing by the liver
The liver is a major metabolic organ in the body,
and at rest receives about a quarter of the total
body’s blood ﬂow, accounting for about 20% of the
total oxygen consumption of the body. The blood
from the gut drains into the portal circulation, a
series of veins that unite into the hepatic portal
vein, which carries venous blood to the liver. Here
it is processed by the hepatocytes before being
released into the bloodstream for use elsewhere.
The liver regulates the storage and distribution of a
variety of substances absorbed from the gut:
. Glucose
. Proteins and amino acids
. Cholesterol
. Iron
. Triglycerides and lipids – although the liver reg-
ulates these, it is not the ﬁrst site of processing
after absorption from the gut.
Glucose
Glucose is an essential requirement of many cells
in the body. Nevertheless, the level of glucose
release must be regulated, particularly through
coordinated action of the endocrine pancreatic
hormones.
The liver expresses both glucokinase and hexo-
kinase, allowing it to commit large amounts of
glucose to glycolysis for the production of fatty
acids; these can be stored in the adipocytes across
the body. The liver can synthesise and store gly-
cogen, which can be released into the bloodstream
to supplement the blood glucose during periods of
starvation.
170
Gastrointestinal system

Amino acids
The composition of the amino acids taken up by
the liver differs markedly from amino acids re-
leased. The metabolic pathways regulating the
processing of amino acids in the liver are discussed
in Chapter 3. The liver is integral is ensuring that
free amino acids in the blood are enough to supply
the body with the necessary building blocks for
protein synthesis, while helping process toxic
amine derivatives produced during amino acid
metabolism. The liver is also a major site of protein
synthesis, producing many of the plasma proteins,
including:
. Albumin
. Clotting factors
. Acute phase proteins
. Transport proteins, e.g. lipoproteins, transferrin.
Triglycerides and lipids
Triglycerides and lipids are not directly processed
by the liver after their ingestion. Instead, they are
packaged into chylomicrons and transported to
adipose tissue, where the fatty acids are extracted
and stored. The liver has three roles related to the
processing and storage of fats:
. During periods of starvation, fatty acids from the
adipocytes can be released and processed as an
energy source. In the liver, the breakdown of
fatty acids can be used to generate ketones
which are released into the blood as a supple-
mentary energy source in starvation.
. The liver is the site of lipoprotein synthesis,
required in the transport of lipids. It takes
up the remnants of chylomicrons after they
have transported fatty acids to the fatty adipose
tissue.
. Excess glucose can be taken up by the liver and
converted to acetyl Co-A, from which fatty acids
can be produced.
Cholesterol
The liver processes cholesterol, which can be
obtained from the uptake of cholesterol-rich chy-
lomicron remnants or through new synthesis in
the liver. The key process in the synthesis of cho-
lesterol is regulated by the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutarate (HMG)-CoA reductase. It is this
enzyme that is inhibited by the ‘statin’ class of
drug, the standard therapy for reducing high
cholesterol, a common risk factor of ‘western dis-
eases’. The liver produces cholesterol for a number
of functions throughout the body:
. The liver produces bile acids from cholesterol.
These are used for the emulsiﬁcation of lipids
and provide a mechanism for the excretion of
cholesterol.
. Cholesterol can be converted into vitamin D,
involved in the regulation of total body calcium
in a process involving reactions in the skin, liver
and kidneys.
. Steroid hormones, which have widespread ef-
fects throughout the body, are produced from
cholesterol.
Iron
The liver produces transferrin, which binds iron in
the intestines for absorption and is also responsi-
ble for iron transport via the bloodstream to tis-
sues. The liver is capable of taking up and storing a
limited amount of iron, most of which is retained
bound to the protein ferritin.
Regulation of
gastrointestinal function
Many organs and functions must be coordinated to
allow the ingestion, digestion and absorption of
nutrients followed by packaging and removal of
waste from the body. This activity is controlled by a
series of signals, which include neural and hor-
monal signals from both the gut and other sites in
the body. There is also regulation of when and how
much an individual ingests. This is the regulation
of appetite and satiety, which happens in response
to many different stimuli.
Control of appetite
The control of appetite, i.e. the desire to eat food, is
complex. It integrates psychological cues, neural
cues, olfactory and gustatory inputs, and hor-
mones. Control occurs at three levels:
Short term – terminating eating when you are ‘full’
Medium term – knowing when it is time for break-
fast, lunch and dinner
Long term – adapting to the environment (e.g.
temperature, amount of food available).
Gastrointestinal system 171

All the factors discussed interact to control
appetite; it is not yet known which are most
important and how exactly these interactions
occur.
The
mesolimbic
reward
system
is
involved, and the desire to eat is thought to be
processed in corticolimbic structures, e.g. the
amygdala, prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum.
Certain foods make you feel ‘good’ so you eat
more of them, even if you are not physiologically
hungry.
Control of appetite is thought to be integrated
within
the
hypothalamus.
The
ventromedial
nucleus is known as the ‘satiety centre’ (preventing
excess
intake
of
food)
while
the
lateral
hypothalamus is known as the ‘feeding centre’.
The
major
outputs
controlling
feeding
behaviour are two sets of neurons in the arcuate
nucleus:
1 POMC/CART neurons release pro-opiomelano-
cortin (POMC), the precursor of a-melanocyte-
stimulating hormone (a-MSH), which is known
to be anorexigenic
(i.e.
decreases
feeding
behaviour).
2 NPY/AgRP neurons release neuropeptide Y, a
potent orexigenic agent (stimulates feeding).
A number of factors come together in the hypo-
thalamus and act to control feeding via these
mechanisms.
Short-term control
The presence of food in the stomach leads to the
release of hormones and results in stomach dis-
tension, both of which stimulate the vagus nerve.
Oral factors also play a role:
. Oral factors related to feeding, e.g. chewing,
salivating, swallowing and taste, have been
shown to have short-term effects, reducing food
intake.
. CCK is a peptide hormone released by the en-
teroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract in
response to lipid in the duodenum. CCK activates
receptors on the afferent sensory ﬁbres of the
vagus nerve.
. The presence of food in the stomach leads to
glucagon and insulin release, both of which de-
crease feeding signals.
. Distension of the GI tract sends stretch inhibi-
tion signals via the vagus to the hypothalamus to
suppress the desire for food. This integrates with
CCK signals.
Medium-term control
A number of molecules either released from the GI
tract or found in the lateral hypothalamus act
within the hypothalamus to control food intake.
Anorexigenic molecules
Peptide YY is released from L-enteroendocrine
cells about 15 min after food ingestion, and levels
remain high for about 6 hours. It is thought to have
anorectic effects.
Orexigenic molecules
Ghrelin – secreted from the endocrine cells of
stomach and GI tract – levels fall after a meal,
although the stimulus for this is unclear. When
body weight decreases, ghrelin production and
plasma levels increase, which makes it difﬁcult to
diet!
Long-term control
Leptin is a protein hormone secreted by adipose
cells responsible for the long-term control of ap-
petite. It maintains body weight by ensuring that
we increase food intake and decrease metabolism
when faced with starvation.
Secretion
Levels of leptin correlate with body fat mass and do
not seem to increase or decrease with food con-
sumption. Insulin may also stimulate leptin
production.
Action in appetite
Leptin is an anorectic and increases activity in
brown fat adipose tissue, increasing metabolism;
however its role is not to decrease food intake/
stimulate weight loss.
A falling level of leptin promotes energy intake,
decreases
energy
expenditure
and
promotes
CLINICAL Leptin deﬁciency
Very rarely, leptin deﬁciency is responsible for obe-
sity due to frameshift mutations in the leptin gene. In
these cases, administration of leptin results in
weight loss, mainly due to altered feeding behav-
iour. However, administration of leptin to obese
individuals without this deﬁciency is ineffective due
to leptin resistance.
172
Gastrointestinal system

partitioning of energy towards fat. When weight is
increased, leptin levels rise until ‘leptin resistance’
occurs. This means that leptin is unable to have
anorectic effects so body weight is maintained for
future times of starvation.
Gastrointestinal hormones
Many regulatory processes in the intestines rely on
chemical signals, allowing the coordination of a
large portion of the GI tract, as well as supporting
organs. GI hormones act primarily in the GI tract to
coordinate motility, digestion, secretion and ab-
sorption. They are released from:
. the enteric nervous system
. enteroendocrine cells found throughout the GI
tract in the crypts. Most of the cells have sensory
microvilli open to the gut lumen, and the hor-
mone is secreted basally.
There are two families of gut hormones, which
act by different mechanisms:
1 Gastrin-like hormones (gastrin, CCK) act via
camp.
2 Secretin-like hormones (secretin, vasoactive
intestinal peptide [VIP], gastric inhibitory poly-
peptide [GIP], glucagon) act via alterations in
intracellular Ca2 þ levels.
Release of these hormones is often in response to
release of acetylcholine from the enteric nervous
system
(ENS).
This
is
stimulated
vagally
in
response to sight, smell and taste of food. Also
distension of the stomach after eating triggers
mechanoreceptors, resulting in vagal stimulation
of ACh release from the ENS.
Histamine
This amine acts to increase HCl secretion.
Release
Secreted from ECL cells in the gastric mucosa in
response to either ACh release from the ENS or
gastrin.
Action
Histamine acts on H2-receptors of the stomach’s
parietal
cells
to
stimulate
a
rise
in
cAMP.
This triggers an increase in K þ channels, hyper-
polarising the cell and increasing the driving force
for Cl  secretion. Histamine also increases the
conduction and insertion of Cl  channels. The
result is increased HCl secretion.
Gastrin
This is a protein hormone that acts to increase HCl
secretion, pepsin secretion and antral motility.
Release
Gastrin is produced from progastrin in the G-cells
of the gastric antrum (some are also found in the
duodenum). Release is stimulated by: protein di-
gestion products, ACh release from the vagus
nerve, gastrin-releasing peptide (released from the
ENS) and distension of the stomach. Release is
inhibited by stomach pH <2.5 (gastrin acts to
increase H þ secretion – so H þ feeds back to inhibit
gastrin secretion) and somatostatin.
Action
Gastrin acts on the CCK-B receptor of parietal cells
to increase intracellular calcium so increasing K þ
channel insertion and resulting in increased acid
production. It stimulates pepsinogen secretion
from chief cells and histamine release from ECL
cells, and acts on the smooth muscle cells of the
stomach to increase antral motility.
Cholecystokinin
This is a protein hormone that acts to increase
secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile and trig-
gers satiety.
Release
Enteroendocrine type I cells in the gut and jeju-
num, and enteric nerves can secrete CCK. Release
is stimulated by the products of protein and fat
breakdown in the duodenum.
Actions
CCK stimulates secretion of pancreatic enzymes
and contraction of the gallbladder; it potentiates
the actions of secretin and also has a role in satiety.
Other gastrointestinal hormones
There are several other GI hormones that have
been identiﬁed, and more are continually being
identiﬁed; their roles are being explored further.
Other
prominent
gut
hormones
include
the
following:
Gastrointestinal system 173

. Secretin stimulates pancreatic and biliary secre-
tion and neutralises stomach acid.
. Somatostatin has an inhibitory role.
. VIP is released from the gut, pancrease and
hypothalamus, and has actions throughout the
body. VIP acts in the GI system to relax the
cardiac sphincter and stomach, and inhibit gas-
tric acid secretion.
. GIP (Gastric inhibitory polypeptide; also known
as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide) is
released from neuroendocrine K cells in the duo-
denum and jejunum. It increases insulin release
and at high levels inhibits gastric acid secretion.
. Motilin is produced by endocrine M cells
(distinct from immune M cells) in the duodenum
and jejunum. Motilin stimulates gastric acid se-
cretion, production of pepsin, and contraction of
the gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi.
. Peptide YY is a small peptide released by the
ileum and colon in response to feeding and
appears to reduce appetite.

Urinary system
The urinary system processes waste products from
the blood and stores them for excretion. At rest, the
kidneys receive around 25% of cardiac output,
allowing them to ﬁlter large volumes of plasma.
The large blood ﬂow also allows the kidneys to
sense changes in blood composition and trigger
homoeostatic responses through the release of
hormones.
Anatomy of the urinary
system
The urinary system, located in the abdomen and
pelvis, consists of four structures:
1 The kidneys are located in the abdomen and
produce urine.
2 The bladder is located in the pelvis and stores
urine.
3 The ureters drain urine from the kidneys to the
bladder.
4 The urethra links the bladder to the external
environment for the removal of urine.
The gross anatomy and relations to other organs
are covered in Chapter 14.
Kidneys
The kidneys are located retroperitoneally on the
posterior abdominal wall, in the paravertebral gut-
ters on either side of the spine. The adrenal glands
are located on the upper pole of the kidneys,
although separated by a thin fascial layer.
The kidneys are surrounded by fat and a fascial
layer that is continuous with the interior surface of
the diaphragm. This attachment accounts for the
slight movement of the kidneys (about 2.5 cm)
during breathing.
Thekidneys are bean-shaped and approximately
10 cm from pole to pole. The hilum in the medial
aspect is the site where three vessels supplying and
draining the kidney enter its interior (Fig. 9.1):
. The renal artery
. The renal vein
. The ureter.
Segmental organisation of the renal
pelvis
The nephrons drain urine into the collecting ducts,
which progressively unite into larger vessels. The
branching structure of the ureter and its tributary
vessels follows a segmental organisation:
. Urine from the collecting ducts drains into the
minor calyces.
. There are about 12–14 minor calyces in the
kidney, which fuse to form 2–4 major calyces.
. The major calyces drain directly into the renal
pelvis.
In a healthy individual, urine drained from the
collecting duct system ﬂows rapidly into the blad-
der; the collecting ducts are usually in a collapsed
state in the kidney.

Kidney vasculature
The renal arteries
The renal arteries arise from the abdominal aorta at
the level of L1–2 and branch as they enter the hilum;
each is an end-artery to a separate renal lobe:
. The segmental arteries are the initial branches
of the renal artery. They are short and divide
immediately into interlobar arteries, which pass
between the lobes of the kidney.
. The interlobular arteries supply the cortex and
project towards the surface of the kidney, at right
angles to the arcuate.
. The arcuate arteries arise from the interlobar
arteries and course along the boundary the cor-
tex and the medulla, roughly parallel to the kid-
ney surface.
. The afferent arterioles are branches of the in-
terlobular arteries, each forming a bundle of
capillaries, the glomerulus, which is the site of
blood ﬁltration into the nephron.
The kidneys contain a portal system, because the
vessels draining the glomeruli are efferent arter-
ioles. These supply a second capillary bed in the
renal cortex, which carries the ﬂuid reabsorbed
from the nephron. A few capillaries enter the renal
medulla as the vasa recta. The medulla of the
kidney receives only about 10% of the total blood
ﬂow to the kidney, all of which is derived from the
efferent arterioles.
The vasa recta
The vasa recta carry ﬂuid from the renal me-
dulla. These capillaries are derived from the
efferent arterioles, forming a series of loops
that descend into the medulla of the kidney,
and remove water and solutes from the tissue.
The cross-sectional area of the vasa recta as
they leave the medulla is much larger than
the area as they enter the medulla, because
a
volume
of
ﬂuid
is
recovered
from
the
interstitium.
The renal vein
Several veins are produced from the vessels
draining the peritubular capillaries and vasa
recta. These progressively unite to form the renal
vein, which lies anterior to the renal artery and
drains into the inferior vena cava. The left renal
vein is longer than the right, passing across the
aorta to reach the inferior vena cava. The left
renal veins accept branches from other struc-
tures, reﬂecting the comparatively long course
that this vessel must take to reach the inferior
vena cava:
. The left suprarenal vein drains the adrenal
glands.
. The left inferior phrenic vein drains parts of the
diaphragm.
. The left testicular (or ovarian) vein drains the
gonads.
Lymphatic drainage of the kidney
The renal lymphatic vessels follow the course of the
renal veins and drain into the aortic lymph nodes.
Lymph from the upper part of the ureters also
drains with the renal lymph.
Figure 9.1 (a) The kidneys are located retroperitoneally in the abdomen at the level of T11–12 and are attached to
various fasciae. At the hilum of the kidney three vessels can be located. The renal artery is a branch of the abdominal
aorta and enters the kidney, splitting into many branches to feed the various regions. The renal vein is located
anteriorto the renalartery and drainsinto the inferiorvenacava. The ﬁnalvessel found atthe hilumis the ureter, which
drains urine to the bladder. In addition, the suprarenal gland is located on the posterior aspect of the kidney and
receives blood derived from the renal, suprarenal and inferior phrenic arteries. Its drainage is directly to the inferior
vena cava on the right-hand side, and via the renal vein, on the left-hand side. (b) The interior of the kidney can be
divided into two areas – the inner medulla and the outer cortex. Within the kidney a segmental series of pyramids can
be identiﬁed, where the apex is within a minor calyx. These represent the sites where urine from the collecting duct
drains into the ureteric system. The minor calyces coalesce to form major calyces; these drain into the renal pelvis
which is continuous with the ureter. (c) The arterial supply to the kidneys reﬂects its formation by branching
morphogenesis. Each renal pyramid is supplied by an interlobar artery, which branches to give off arcuate arteries.
These in turn branch to interlobular arteries, which give rise to numerous afferent arterioles. The afferent arterioles
supply the glomeruli of the nephron. A single nephron is demonstrated in the ﬁgure, although each kidney contains
around 1 million of them. The nephron tubule descends into the renal medulla, before returning to contact the
glomerulus. The nephron terminates in the collecting ducts which drain into the renal calyces.

Urinary system 177

Innervation of the kidneys
The kidneys have sensory and sympathetic inner-
vation, although they receive no direct parasym-
pathetic innervation:
. Sensory innervation is through the lower tho-
racic nerves, accounting for the referred pain to
T11–12. Pain tends to radiate from the small of
the back around to the front of the body in the
region of the groin.
. Sympathetic innervation is via the renal plexus of
nerves that branches around the renal artery. It is a
continuation of the coeliac plexus and also re-
ceives innervation via the least splanchnic nerve.
The ureters
Urine drains to the bladder via the ureters. These
muscular tubes run inferiorly from the renal pelvis
across the anterior surface of the psoas major
muscles to enter the posterior surface of the blad-
der. The muscular layers contract around every
30 s to propel urine into the bladder. The openings
of the ureters into the bladders are slit like and at an
angle, which helps them act like valves preventing
urine from reﬂuxing to the kidneys, particularly
when pressure in the bladder increases during
voiding. The precise course varies in men and
women due to the differences in pelvic anatomy
and reproductive organs. The ureters are made up
of three tissue layers:
1 The mucosal layer is innermost and contains
urothelium and lamina propria.
2 The muscularis mucosa contains longitudinal
and circular muscle layers.
3 A ﬁbrous connective tissue layer is outermost
and continuous with the peritoneum and renal
capsule.
CLINICAL Renal colic and blockage of
the ureters
Occasionally a ureter may become blocked, result-
ing in a sharp pain in the lower abdomen, often
radiating into the groin and upper thigh. The pain
has a colicky nature, getting progressively weaker
and stronger with contraction of the ureters.
Blockage of the ureter can lead to an increase in
pressure, causing severe pain and impeding renal
ﬁltration, because the hydrostatic pressure in-
creases within the collecting ducts and the nephron
as a whole.
The bladder
The bladder (Fig. 9.2) is a highly distensible sac
with strong muscular walls. It lies on the pubic
ﬂoor surrounded by fatty tissue and its superior
surface is covered by a layer of peritoneum. In
children, the bladder may protrude into the ab-
domen, but in adults the bladder is located en-
tirely in the pelvis. The epithelium and muscular
layers of the bladder are specially adapted to
allow storage and expulsion of urine; their de-
tailed histological structure is discussed later in
Chapter 14.
Gross anatomy of the bladder
When empty, the bladder is tetrahedral in shape,
with the apex facing downwards. The trigone is a
triangular region of the bladder wall located pos-
teriorly, with the ureteric and urethral openings at
Urachus

Trigone

Apex
Figure 9.2 The bladder is located posterior to the
pubic bone, such that the apex is superior to the
pubis. The superior surface of the bladder is covered
by the peritoneum, which continues posteriorly to
intestines, also covering the uterus in females. Below
the apex of the bladder is the body and the fundus,
which leads to the neck of the bladder – the site of the
urethra. The bladder is divided into many distinct
regions. The ureters and the urethra enter at the
corners of the trigone, which is found on the posterior
wall. The urethra ﬂows directly through the neck of
the bladder, which is surrounded by the prostate in
males. The ﬂow of urine out of the bladder is regu-
lated by the urethral sphincters. The urachus at the
apex of the bladder is an embryological structure
that has no function in the developed bladder.
178
Urinary system

the three corners. The trigone is derived from the
mesonephric ducts, whereas the rest of the bladder
is derived from the urogenital sinus, and cannot
expand and contract in the same way as the rest of
the bladder.
The superior surface of the bladder is covered
in a layer of peritoneum, which is continuous
with the anterior abdominal wall, although its
course posterior to the bladder varies between
the sexes:
. In males the peritoneum passes over the
superior surface of the bladder and the sem-
inal vesicles before forming the rectovesical
pouch and covering the superior part of the
rectum.
. In females the peritoneum extends from the
bladder to the uterus, forming the vesicouterine
pouch, and then from the uterus to the rectum,
forming the rectouterine pouch.
Vasculature of the bladder
The bladder, as with other pelvic organs, receives
its blood supply from the internal iliac arteries. The
precise course and nature of the arteries vary be-
tween the sexes, as they do that for the veins
draining the bladder.
Arterial supply of the bladder
The main arterial supply of the bladder is derived
from branches of the internal iliac arteries, which
supply the pelvic organs:
. The superior vesical arteries supply the superior
part of the bladder.
. The fundus and neck of the bladder are supplied
by the inferior vesical arteries in males and the
vaginal arteries in females.
Venous drainage
The venous drainage of the bladder broadly follows
the arterial supply:
. In males, the vesical venous plexus drains the
bladder and combines with the prostatic plexus.
The venous blood drains into the internal iliac
veins via the inferior vesical veins.
. In females, the vesical venous plexus also drains
the pelvic part of the urethra and the neck of the
bladder, and communicates with the vaginal and
uterovaginal venous plexus.
Lymphatic drainage
Lymphatic drainage of the bladder is to three
different sets of lymph nodes:
. The superior part of the bladder passes to the
external iliac nodes.
. The fundus is drained by the internal iliac nodes.
. The neck of the bladder drains to the sacral
lymph nodes.
The urethra
The urethra connects the bladder to the external
world for the voiding of urine. The urethra starts at
the neck of the bladder. Its course varies consid-
erably between the sexes and is discussed in
Chapter 14.
Urine production in the
kidneys
The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. In
each kidney there are approximately 1 million
nephrons which perform two major homoeostatic
functions:
. The removal of waste products
. The regulation of many homeostatic processes,
including total ﬂuid volume, ion content and
acid-base balance.
The formation of urine is intrinsically linked to
regulatory and excretory functions of the nephron
and four distinct processes can be identiﬁed:
1 Glomerular ﬁltration removes ﬂuid and solutes
from the blood into the kidney nephron.
2 Tubular reabsorption allows total reclama-
tion of many essential molecules from the
tubular ﬂuid. Other components are reab-
sorbed under the inﬂuence of hormones to
maintain homoeostasis.
3 Tubular secretion of some compounds into
the tubule increases their removal from the
body.
4 Hormonal production to maintain homoeosta-
sis can be triggered by the nephron in response
to changes in the composition of the tubular
ﬂuid.
Each nephron consists of ﬁve distinct regions,
which are involved in performing these functions:
Urinary system 179

1 Renal corpuscle
2 Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)
3 Loop of Henle
4 Distal convoluted tubule (DCT)
5 Collecting duct.
The renal corpuscle
The renal corpuscle is the ﬁrst stage of the neph-
ron. It is made of a cluster of capillaries – the
glomerulus – surrounded by the start of the neph-
ron tubule, a structure known as Bowman’s cap-
sule. The interface between the glomerulus and
Bowman’s capsule ﬁlters the components of blood
into the nephron (Fig. 9.3).
Some parts of the renal corpuscle are directly
involved in the process of ultraﬁltration; addition-
al cell types regulate the ﬂow of blood through the
glomerulus and the rate of ﬁltration of the ﬂuid into
Bowman’s capsule, including:
. Cells at the ﬁltration barrier
. Supporting cells
. The juxtaglomerular apparatus.
DEFINITION Ultraﬁltration
This is the process by which ﬂuid is ﬁltered from the
blood under high pressure in the glomerulus. As a
result, around 20% of the plasma delivered to the
kidney is forced into the nephron. Components with
a molecular weight <7 kDa can cross, whereas the
cells and protein components cannot cross the
ﬁltration barrier.

Figure 9.3 The renal corpuscle: this is the ﬁrst structure in the nephron, and is responsible for ultraﬁltration. The
blood ﬂows from the afferent to the efferent arteriole at high pressure, through the glomerular capillaries. The high
pressure forces the soluble components of plasma out into Bowman’s capsule. The layers contributing to the
ﬁltration barrier are the endothelium of the glomerular capillaries, the basement membrane and the podocytes,
which are derived from the visceral layer of Bowman’s capsule. The ﬁltrate ﬂows into the proximal convoluted tubule
(PCT) of the nephron. The more distal region of each nephron feeds back to its glomerulus through the
juxtaglomerular region, where it is in contact with the macula densa and the extraglomerular mesangial cells.
These regulate function through hormonal release. Mesangial cells in the glomerulus can regulate blood ﬂood to
help control ultraﬁltration.
180
Urinary system

Supporting cells in the renal corpuscle
Mesangial cells may be found between the glomer-
ular capillaries.
These
cells
are
responsible
for
producing
components of the extracellular membrane and
have contractile properties that may allow the reg-
ulation of blood ﬂow through the capillaries. Other
roles of the mesangial cells are not clear, although it
is thought that they may function as scavengers in
the glomerulus, to remove matter that gets stuck in
the basement membrane during ﬁltration.
The juxtaglomerular apparatus
The juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) is formed from
cells of both the DCT and the afferent arteriole
supplyingtheglomerulus of the samenephron.This
apparatus has important roles in the regulation of
ﬂow rate within the nephron and blood pressure,
and in Na þ reabsorption. Three cell types are par-
ticularly prominent in the JGA:
1 The macula densa is a region of tightly packed
cells of the DCT that are directly associated with
the afferent arteriole. These cells detect changes
in both the composition and the ﬂow rate of
the ﬂuid – a decrease in the ﬂow rate of the
ﬁltrate results in a decrease in the Na þ ions
reaching the JGA, providing direct feedback of
the tubular ﬂow and composition downstream
of the glomerulus.
2 Juxtaglomerular(granular)cellsarespecialised
smooth muscle cells that are found around the
afferent arteriole. These cells respond to signals,
including those from the macula densa, to re-
lease renin, which is involved in the regulation of
Na þ and ﬂuid balance.
3 Extraglomerular mesangial cells (sometimes
called Lacis cells) are found in contact with the
glomerular mesangial cells between the arter-
ioles. They are thought to aid transmission of
signals from the macula densa to the mesangial
cells within the glomerulus, which may contract
to alter the blood ﬂow.
Glomerular ﬁltration and the
ﬁltration barrier
Blood ﬂow and pressure regulate the rate of renal
ﬁltration. The kidneys can adjust their vascular
resistance to allow a relatively constant glomerular
ﬁltration rate. This is regulated by the two arter-
ioles between which the glomerulus is located.
There are three layers that water and solutes
must cross to reach the interior of the nephron;
they
are
responsible
for
the
selectivity
of
ultraﬁltration:
1 Endothelial cells are primarily responsible for
preventing cells from leaving the capillaries. The
capillaries are fenestrated, allowing many pro-
tein molecules to leave the vessels easily and, as
such, they do not contribute to ﬁltration of pro-
tein constituents of the plasma.
2 The basement membrane, composed mainly of
collagen, contains many negatively charged mo-
lecules, particularly glycosaminoglycans. As
many protein constituents of the blood are also
negatively charged, this barrier restricts their
movement into the nephron.
3 Podocytes envelope the endothelial cells and
possesslargeprojections(trabeculae),andmany
smaller projections (pedicles), which are inter-
laced, producing a series of narrow ‘slit pores’.
These are the ﬁnal barrier before the ﬂuid enters
the nephron tubule.
At some points in the glomerulus, particularly the
neck, the endothelium is surrounded by mesangial
cells instead of podocytes. The mesangial cells may
contract to alter ﬁltration area, and hence the
ﬁltration rate.
Selectivity of ultraﬁltration
Selectivity of the molecules ﬁltered depends on the
properties of the molecule and how they interact
with the ﬁltration barrier components:
. Size: molecules up to 7 kDa, are freely ﬁltered.
Those greater than around 70 kDa and of a mo-
lecular radius >4 nm are not ﬁltered.
CLINICAL Nephrotic syndrome
Nephrotic syndrome is deﬁned as the loss of more
than 3.5 g protein/day in the urine and occurs as a
result of damage to the glomeruli; this permits larger
molecules (i.e. proteins) to escape into the nephron.
Common causes are minimal change disease and
membranous glomerulonephritis.
Symptoms result from the loss of protein within the
urine, which alters the oncotic pressure of the blood.
As a result, systemic oedema occurs, particularly in
the legs and around the eyes. Fluid may also build up
in the lungs or peritoneum. Urine may become foamy
in cases where protein loss is particularly high.
Urinary system 181

. Charge: negatively charged molecules located in
the basement membrane particularly restrict the
passage of negatively charged large molecules
(>7 kDa) into the nephron.
CLINICAL Glomerulonephritis
Glomerulonephritis is aninﬂammation of the glomer-
uli which leads to a decrease in the function of the
ultraﬁltration barrier. The condition usually presents
as protein in the urine (proteinuria) or nephrotic
syndrome. There are a variety of causes of glomer-
ulonephritis (e.g. some infection, or autoimmune
conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus)
and the precise treatment varies with the underlying
cause.
Forces driving ultraﬁltration
Ultraﬁltration is driven by Starling’s forces, and
depends on the balance between the forces favour-
ing ﬁltration and those opposing it. The strong
driving force of ultraﬁltration is maintained by the
balance of Starling’s forces – the high hydrostatic
pressure in the glomerulus forces ﬂuid and solutes
into the nephron. This high glomerular capillary
hydrostatic pressure is opposed by the oncotic
pressure of the glomerular capillary protein and
the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule. As
negligible amounts of protein are ﬁltered, there is
normally no protein oncotic pressure in Bowman’s
capsule.
DEFINITION The coefﬁcient of ﬁltration
The coefﬁcient of ﬁltration (Kf) is an indication of the
permeability of a structure to water. It is determined
by two variables:
1 The surface area of the capillaries
2 The conductance by the capillaries of water.
A high Kf indicates that the vessels in question are
highly permeable to water.
Renal clearance
Renal clearance allows assessment of whether a
substance
is
being
excreted
or
reabsorbed
into
the
tubule, and can
be
an important
indicator of renal function. It is given as an
idealised value – the minimum volume of plasma
from which the amount of substance could have
been obtained. It can be an important indicator
of renal function.
DEFINITION Glomerular ﬁltration rate
This is the amount of a substance that passes into
the nephrons from the glomeruli in a given length of
time.
CLINICAL Measurement of glomerular
ﬁltration rate
The rate with which a substance is removed from
the blood can be used to assess the glomerular
ﬁltration rate (GFR) which, in turn, provides an
assessment of the state of the kidneys. Historically,
inulin was used to assess GFR, because it is
neither secreted nor reabsorbed. It provides very
accurate readings of GFR but has to be injected
into the patient. Currently in the clinic, glomerular
ﬁltration is typically assessed through creatinine
levels in the urine. This is a natural metabolite that
enters the blood at a relatively constant rate. There
is a small amount of active secretion of creatinine
that can result in an overestimation of renal function
(by about 10%).
Regulation of glomerular ﬁltration
Although renal blood ﬂow is variable, GFR re-
mains almost constant over a wide range of
arterial blood pressures. This regulation is pos-
sible because the glomerular pressure can be
controlled by both afferent and efferent arter-
ioles, e.g. if the afferent arteriole constricts and
reduces the renal blood ﬂow, constriction of the
efferent
arteriole
can
nevertheless
maintain
GFR. Two mechanisms are postulated to ac-
count for this regulation:
1 Myogenic regulation:increased pressure causes
stretching of the capillary smooth muscle. This
stretch triggers contraction of the smooth mus-
cle to reduce ﬂow.
2 Juxtaglomerular feedback: the JGA detects
the NaCl delivery rate by the nephron at the
182
Urinary system

macula densa in the DCT, so that ﬁltration can
be
altered
to
accommodate
changes.
In-
creased NaCl triggers the JGA to release aden-
osine which causes constriction of the affer-
ent arteriole.
The proximal convoluted tubule
The PCT is responsible for the reabsorption of
approximately two-thirds of the glomerular ﬁltrate
and reclamation of many essential molecules from
the ﬂuid.
It is made up of a single type of simple epithelium
that possess microvilli to increase the surface area
incontact withthelumen;itcontainsmanyvesicles,
which are involved in transport, and many mito-
chondria, reﬂecting the high energy usage within
the cells. The tubule cells rest on a thin basement
membrane, outside of which are many peritubular
capillaries. The junctions between the epithelial
cells are ‘leaky’, allowing movement of ﬂuid and
some solutes by the paracellular pathway.
Transport within the PCT
Reabsorption in the PCT occurs isotonically – the
osmolality of the tubular ﬂuid does not change,
although the volume decreases by about 70%. The
major substances that the PCT reabsorbs are
(Fig. 9.4):
. Na þ, Cl , HCO3
, glucose and amino acids via
speciﬁc transport mechanisms
. Water, through osmosis
. K þ, Ca2 þ and Mg2 þ and many other substances
by
movement
down
their
concentration
gradient.
Na þ ion gradient drives reabsorption
in the PCT
Na þ, Cl  and HCO3
 account for about 90% of
the osmotically active particles in the ﬁltrate.
Their reabsorption is essential to absorb the
large volumes of ﬂuid that are ﬁltered and would
otherwise be lost from the body. The high energy
requirement of PCT cells is largely a result of the
active transport of Na þ by the Na þ/K þ ATPase
on their basolateral membrane. Transport of
Na þ from the cell to the blood establishes a
concentration gradient between the cell and the
lumen, which aids facilitated diffusion. It is the
coupling of Na þ reabsorption to other transport
mechanisms that allows the reuptake of a range
of solutes:
. In in the ﬁrst part of the PCT organic solutes
(glucose and amino acids), phosphate and
HCO3
 transport are coupled to Na þ.
. In the later parts, Cl reabsorption occurs with
Na þ uptake.
Many other molecules are also reabsorbed by
secondary active transport driven by the Na þ
gradient.
Reabsorption of bicarbonate
The reabsorption of bicarbonate within the neph-
ron is essential to maintain pH balance in the
blood. The reabsorption occurs in two stages:
1 In the tubular lumen secreted H þ combines
with ﬁltered HCO3
 to form H2O and CO2, both
of which may diffuse freely into the epithelial
cells.
2 In the cells the reverse reaction can be catalysed
by
carbonic
anhydrase
and
the
resulting
HCO3
 is returned to the plasma. By the coop-
erative actions of two transporters:
(a) the Na þ/H þexchanger in the apical mem-
brane which transports a single H þ ion into
the tubule while reabsorbing a Na þ ion
(b) the Na þ /HCO3
symporter, located in the
basolateral membrane, which transports one
Na þ out of the cell (against its chemical
gradient) with the transport of three HCO3

out of the cell.
Chloride reabsorption
Chloride ions are reabsorbed by two different
mechanisms:
1 Paracellular route: Cl  reabsorption occurs in
the last parts of the PCT (S2 and S3) due to
movement down its concentration gradient, be-
cause the absorption of Na þ and HCO3
 has
caused H2O reabsorption in the S1 segment.
2 Transcellular route: Cl  reabsorption across
the epithelium is through a Cl /anion exchang-
er in the apical membrane and a K þ/Cl  sym-
porter in the basolateral membrane.
Calcium reabsorption
Ca2 þ is an essential ion in cell signalling and makes
up the matrix of the bone. As with Cl , Ca2 þ may

Sodium (Na+)
The reabsorption of 
sodium within the 
proximal convoluted 
tubule (PCT) is driven 
by the Na+/K+ ATPase in 
the basolateral 
membrane, generating a 
Na+ gradient. Transport 
of Na+ across the 
basolateral membrane 
can also occur through 
the transport of Na+ with 
HCO3–. The transport of 
Na+ across the apical 
surface occurs through 
the Na+/H+ exchanger 
and co-transport with 
other molecules, such 
as glucose and amino 
acids. Finally, a large 
proportion of Na+ can be 
transported between 
cells, being drawn out of 
the tubule down its 
electrochemical 
gradient.
Chloride (Cl–)
The transport of Cl– 
across the apical 
surface occurs through 
a Cl–/base exchanger. 
This base (e.g. HCO3 
or formate) is 
effectively recycled, 
because it can combine 
with H+ in the tubule 
and diffuse back into 
the cell as a non-polar 
compound; there it 
becomes deprotonated 
once again and is used 
to reabsorb another 
chloride molecule. At 
the basolateral 
membrane, Cl– 
transport can occur 
through a channel or 
through co-transport 
with K+. In the early 
parts of the PCT, a 
large proportion of Cl– 
is reabsorbed through 
solvent drag.
Amino acids 
Amino acids are rapidly 
reabsorbed from the 
tubule, through either 
their own specific 
transporters or 
co-transport that is 
driven by the Na+ 
gradient. Transport of 
the amino acids out of 
the tubule cells is 
through a specific 
transporter. In addition, 
significant metabolism 
of some amino acids 
occurs within the tubule 
cells such that the 
composition of amino 
acids entering the 
tubule cell will differ 
from that released into 
the bloodstream.
Calcium (Ca2+)
Ca2+ transport occurs 
due to the concentra-
tion gradient between 
the lumen and the 
epithelium, which is set 
up through the 
Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in 
the basolateral 
membrane and the 
Ca2+/H+ exchanger. In 
turn, these gradients 
are driven, in part, by 
the Na+/K+ ATPase 
present on the surface 
of the epithelial cells.
AA
Figure 9.4 The reabsorption of ions in the proximal convoluted tubule occurs through a variety of different
processes. In addition, much of the reabsorption can occur through the transcellular pathway between cells. In
this diagram, the reabsorption of each molecule is represented as it occurs in distinct cells, although in reality each
cell in the epithelium expresses the transporters to reabsorb all the compounds detailed, as well as those discussed
in this chapter.

Urinary system

be reabsorbed by both paracellular and transcel-
lular routes:
. Paracellular (between cells) reabsorption occurs
through movement down its concentration gradi-
ent and accounts for most Ca2 þ reabsorption.
. Transcellular (through cells) reabsorption oc-
curs at the apical membrane through the epithe-
lial Ca2 þ channel (ECaC), and the basolateral
membrane by a Ca2 þ/Na þ antiporter protein
which moves Ca2 þ out as Na þ enters the cell,
driven by the Na þ gradient.
Phosphate reabsorption
Phosphate (Pi) is required for the production
of nucleotides and contributes to the bone matrix.
Its transport is regulated by the Na/Pi symporter in
the apical membrane, which transports two Na þ
with each Pi molecule. Approximately 80% of the
ﬁltered phosphate is reabsorbed in the PCT and
about 10% in the DCT; the remainder is excreted. Pi
is hormonally regulated by parathyroid hormone
(PTH) which inhibits its reabsorption.
Glucose reabsorption
Reabsorption of glucose occurs through the
Na þ/glucose (SGLT) symporter found at the
apical membrane of PCT cells. The SGLT trans-
porters have a maximum rate of transport,
which can be saturated if the ﬁltered load of
glucose is too high – as may be seen in diabetes
mellitus. A failure to reabsorb glucose can lead
to problems in the regulation of ﬂuid levels,
because it results in a tubular ﬂuid with in-
creased
osmolarity,
so
causing
‘osmotic
diuresis’. Two types of SGLT exist, both speciﬁc
for D-glucose:
1 SGLT2 is found in the proximal parts of the PCT,
and transports a single glucose molecule per
Na þ ion.
2 SGLT1 is in the more distal part of the PCT and
requires two Na þ ions for the transport of a
single glucose molecule. The use of two Na þ
ions increases the driving force of transport,
allowing greater scavenging of glucose.
Reabsorption of amino acids
Amino acids are reabsorbed with Na þ by one of at
least four different symporters, each with a rela-
tively broad speciﬁcity.
Defects in each of these transporters have been
identiﬁed and that of cystinuria is particularly well
studied.
CLINICAL Cystinuria
Cystinuria is a rare condition that results from an
inability to reabsorb cysteine from the urine, due to
an autosomal dominant mutation in a component of
the basic amino acid transporter. This leads to the
formation of kidney stones through the crystallisa-
tion of cysteine in the kidneys, ureters or bladder.
Although other amino acids are also not reab-
sorbed, they do not produce crystals and so do not
cause symptoms.
Reabsorption of energy metabolites
Many intermediates of glycolysis and the tricar-
boxylic acid (TCA) cycle (e.g. acetoacetate, pyru-
vate and lactate) are ﬁltered out of the blood. These
molecules must be reclaimed to prevent the loss of
a potentially crucial source of energy.
Reabsorption of water
About two-thirds of water is reabsorbed in the PCT.
As a small osmotic gradient is sufﬁcient to drive
huge water ﬂows, any gradient is rapidly collapsed
by osmotic ﬂow:
. Transcellular ﬂow of water accounts for most
reabsorption. The epithelial cells in the kidney
tubule express aquaporins, specialised water
channels. Aquaporin I is constitutively ex-
pressed on both the apical and the basolateral
cell membranes in the PCT.
. The paracellular pathway also contributes to the
reabsorption of water, although to a lesser extent
than the transcellular pathway.
Secretory mechanisms in the PCT
Many waste products bind to plasma proteins and
are not readily ﬁltered; most of the removal of
such compounds occurs through active secretion.
Two distinct secretion systems exist in the PCT –
one secreting anions and the other secreting
cations.
The stereotypical example of active secretion is
that for organic acids. An example of such an acid is
p-aminohippuric acid (PAH). In a single pass
Urinary system 185

through the kidneys, about 90% of the PAH is
removed from the blood.
The systems employed for the excretion of PAH
are used for the excretion of a wide variety of
anions including:
. naturallyoccurringmetabolites,e.g.oxaloacetate.
. many drugs, e.g. penicillin
. conjugates of sulphates and glucuronate.
Back diffusion
Some substances are secreted in the PCT but re-
absorbed to varying degrees in the more distal
regions of the nephron. This occurs through simple
diffusion that is not mediated by carrier proteins.
In cases where compounds have both neutral and
charged species, the rate of back diffusion can be
inﬂuence by pH.
The loop of Henle
In humans only about 15% of the nephrons have
signiﬁcant loops of Henle. The loop of Henle pro-
trudes into the medulla of the kidneys and is
responsible for generating an extremely hyperton-
ic environment in the interstitium to aid antidiure-
tic hormone (ADH)-driven reabsorption of H2O
from the collecting duct. In addition, some direct
water reabsorption occurs in the generation of the
gradient. Three distinct parts can be identiﬁed in
the loop of Henle:
1 Thin descending limb
2 Thin ascending limb
3 Thick ascending limb.
The hypertonic environment generated by the loop
of Henle occurs through a countercurrent multi-
plier, which generates hypertonicity. The medulla
of the kidneys contains many vasa recta which
carry reabsorbed ﬂuid to ensure that it does not
dilute the medulla.
Structure and function of the loop of
Henle
The tubule cells in the loop of Henle have different
structural features related to their function. The
differential movement of H2O and Na þ in partic-
ular are discussed below (Fig. 9.5):
. The concentration of the ﬂuid in the nephron is
achieved by the thin descending limb, because it
allows the movement of H2O into the medulla,
while being relatively impermeable to both Na þ
and urea. As the medulla is highly concentrated
for both Na þ and urea, it provides a concentra-
tion gradient that draws H2O out of the descend-
ing limb into the medullary interstitium. Some
Na þ diffuses from the interstitium into the
tubule.
. The thin ascending limb is impermeable to H2O.
Thecells of the thin ascending limb are extremely
thin and lack the large numbers of mitochondria
seen in much of the rest of the tubule. This is
reﬂected in their absorption of Na þ which is
entirely by passive transport. This movement
relies on the high concentration of Na þ in the
tubular ﬂuid which is the result of movement of
H2O into the medulla in the descending limbs of
the loop.
. The cells of the thick ascending limb, which are
impermeable to H2O, help generate a hyperos-
molar medulla by transporting NaCl, driven by
the Na þ/K þ ATPAse in the basolateral cell mem-
branes. The main transporter in the apical cell
membranes is the Na þ/K þ/2Cl co-transporter
(NKCC). This transporter is the target of loop
diuretics.
The countercurrent multiplier
Although the PCT reabsorbs large amounts of wa-
ter and solutes, the ﬁltrate leaving the PCT is
isotonic. The generation of hypertonic urine is
achieved by the loop of Henle’s functions, which
DEFINITION Osmolarity and osmolality
These are often referred to interchangeably, al-
though there are potentially large differences be-
tween them:
. Osmolarity refers to the concentration of a mol-
ecule within a given total volume of solution, typ-
ically expressed in the units osmol/L.
. Osmolality is deﬁned as the concentration of a
substance in a deﬁned weight of water and is
expressed as the units osmol/kg.
The volume of a given weight of solute changes
with temperature, so the osmolarity of a solution is
also temperature dependent. Osmolality is the
preferred measurement, because it is temperature
independent and relates to a speciﬁc amount of
water.

Descending limb
The descending limb is 
permeable to water, 
but only slightly 
permeable to Na+; the 
water removed 
increases the 
osmolarity of the 
tubular fluid. The water 
that is removed is 
drained from the 
medulla by the vasa 
recta to prevent a loss 
of the high osmolarity 
in the interstitium.
Thin ascending limb
The thin ascending 
limb is permeable to 
Na+ although not to 
water. This allows Na+ 
to flow into the 
medulla, down its 
concentration 
gradient, to contribute 
to the high osmolarity 
there. 
Thick ascending limb
As in the thin 
ascending limb, the 
thick portion is 
impermeable to water 
although transport of 
Na+ occurs further, 
contributing to the high 
salt concentrations in 
the medulla. 
Medulla
The Na+ that enters the medulla from the ascending 
limbs contributes to the high osmolarity of the 
interstitial fluid. This allows the flow of water from the 
collecting duct under the influence of antidiuretic 
hormone (ADH). The reabsorbed water from the 
collecting duct and the thin ascending limb is 
removed by the vasa recta to prevent dilution of the 
medulla.
Collecting duct
ADH released from the 
posterior pituitary 
triggers the expression 
of aquaporin II in the 
surface of the collecting 
duct epithelium; this 
allows the flow of water 
into the cells as a result 
of the high osmolarity 
of the medulla, which 
has been generated by 
the loop of Henle. This 
water reabsorption 
allows regulation of the 
fluid balance.

cause the interstitial ﬂuid to be highly concen-
trated. The different permeabilities and transport
processes
of
the
ascending
and
descending
limbs of the loop of Henle allow the concentration
of solutes in the medulla. This concentration
occurs in a series of steps, which progressively
increase the concentration towards the tip of the
loop of Henle:
1 The ascending limb is impermeable to water
and (the thick part) transports Na þ and urea to
the medullary interstitium, to increase the os-
molarity in the interstitium.
2 The descending limb is permeable to water,
although relatively impermeable to Na þ and
urea, resulting in the movement of water from
the descending limb to the medulla. This ﬂuid is
removed from the medulla by the vasa recta. The
net result is a concentration of the ﬂuid in the
interstitium and the descending limb.
3 The cycle of movement of solutes from the as-
cending limb, movement of water from the des-
cending limb and its subsequent removal from
the medulla by the vasa recta causes a progres-
sive concentration of the medulla towards the
tip of the loop of Henle.
The contribution of urea to the
concentration gradient
Na þ and urea are the two main molecules respon-
sible for the hypertonicity of the medulla. The role
and transport of Na þ have been discussed earlier.
Handling of urea in the glomerulus and PCT
The handling of urea by the nephron varies along
its length:
. The glomerulus freely ﬁlters urea.
. The PCT reabsorbs about half the ﬁltered urea.
. In the thin ascending limb and most distal por-
tions of the descending limb of the loop of Henle,
urea moves from the interstitium into the tubule,
down its concentration gradient.
. The collecting ducts reabsorb urea in the inner
medulla,
raising
the
medullary
interstitial
osmolality.
Urea handling in the collecting duct is regulated by
the ADH. High levels of ADH trigger the reabsorp-
tion of H2O and urea into the medulla interstitium.
Although H2O is removed rapidly by the vasa recta,
much of the urea remains in the medulla – it can
account for up to 50% of total osmolality.
The high osmolality of the interstitium results in
urea transport from the interstitium into the des-
cending and thin ascending limbs, which contri-
butes to the high concentration in the collecting
duct. In conditions where there is less water reab-
sorption, the concentration of urea in the nephron
is lower due to the presence of more water. In turn,
this results in less reabsorption and a decrease in
the osmolality of the loop of Henle. As a result,
where there is little reabsorption of water, there is a
lower interstitial urea concentration and more
urea is excreted in the urine.
Recycling of urea
The urea in the collecting duct is processed and
moved by three routes, which vary in relation to the
homoeostatic needs of the body:
. A proportion of the urea (about 40%) is not
reabsorbed from the collecting duct and is ex-
creted in the urine.
. Urea is removed from the collecting duct ﬂuid,
regulated by ADH. This urea is dealt with by two
distinct mechanisms:
– some of the urea is re-secreted into the loop of
Henle in the descending and thin ascending
limbs and carried back to the collecting duct
– some of the urea is reabsorbed by the vasa
recta and returned to the circulation.
The distal convoluted tubule
The early DCT is a continuation of the thick as-
cending limb of the loop of Henle and is found in
the renal cortex. The DCT and the collecting ducts
are important in ﬁne tuning reabsorption to main-
tain homoeostasis. The major function of the DCT
is the reabsorption of Na þ from the tubules, which
is coupled to the secretion of K þ and H þ.
Morphology of the DCT
The macula densa is found in the ﬁrst part of the
DCT, closely related to the glomerulus of the same
nephron. It allows the tubule to feed back to the
glomerulus, which, in turn, allows rapid responses
to changes in the ﬂow rate or composition of
the tubule.
The cells in the DCT resemble those in the thick
ascending limb of the loop of Henle. They have
numerous tight junctions between them and many
mitochondria located towards the basolateral as-
pect to power the active transport processes. As the
188
Urinary system

net movement of ions is comparatively smaller
than in the PCT, there are fewer microvilli.
Ion transport in the DCT
The distal tubule still plays a signiﬁcant role in the
reabsorption of Na þ ions through a Na þ/Cl  co-
transport, which is responsible for around 7% of
Na þ reabsorption and is the target of thiazide
diuretics.
Collecting ducts
Distal tubules converge to form collecting ducts,
which merge to form progressively larger ducts,
eventually draining into the minor calyces. The
main function of the collecting duct is to concen-
trate urine by passive reabsorption, which is pro-
moted by the concentration gradient set up by the
loop of Henle.
Structure and morphology of the
collecting duct
Two main cell types are found in the collecting
duct, which are responsible for the reabsorption
that occurs there:
1 Principal cells are responsible for Na þ reab-
sorption, accounting for about 5% of the Na þ
reabsorbed. Principal cells also express selective
aquaporins, under the control of ADH, for the
reabsorption of H2O to regulate ﬂuid levels.
2 Intercalated cells play a role in the regulation
of pH, being capable of active secretion of H þ
or HCO3
.
Concentration of urine
The daily amount of urine produced by an indi-
vidual and its osmolality can vary enormously. The
volume of urine is related to the ﬂuid intake of the
individual, as well as to ﬂuid loss through other
routes. When ﬂuid intake is low, the ﬂuid volume of
the urine is small, resulting in the formation of
concentrated urine. In contrast, when water intake
is high, large amounts of hypotonic urine are pro-
duced to remove the excess ﬂuid from the system.
The body regulates a portion of the ﬂuid loss
from the body such that total intake and output of
water are balanced. In a typical individual, both the
intake and output of water per day are normally
around 2500 mL (Table 9.1).
The production of concentrated urine is related
to ﬂuid homoeostasis. Changes in osmolality in
the blood are sensed by cells in the supraoptic and
paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. The
detection of blood becoming hypertonic triggers
the release of ADH to reduce water loss.
The kidneys are the target organ for many hor-
mones involved in the regulation of ﬂuid and
solute balance. Fluid resorption in the proximal
parts of the tubule is under limited hormonal
control, because it follows Na þ absorption, which
is regulated by angiotensin II. Most of the regula-
tion occurs in the DCT and collecting duct.
Water reabsorption and ADH
The regulation of ﬂuid balance is achieved within
the collecting ducts in response to ADH (Fig. 9.6).
Synthesis and secretion
ADH, also known as arginine vasopressin (AVP), is
a small peptide hormone (nine amino acids). It is
produced in the neuronal cell bodies in the supra-
optic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothal-
amus and released from the axons of these cells,
which terminate in the posterior pituitary gland.

To ensure ﬂuid balance is maintained the amount of ﬂuid
taken in and lost from the body must be equal. The ﬁgures in
the table represent the approximate ﬂuid balance in a
normal adult at room temperature. The temperature will
alter the ﬂuid balance enormously: in hot conditions a larger
volume of ﬂuid will be lost through sweating, resulting in a
relative decrease in the volume of urine produced. Insen-
sible ﬂuid loss is that which we are not consciously aware of,
such as the water that evaporates from the lungs. This ﬂuid
loss is not regulated and, as a result, represents a volume of
ﬂuid that must always be recovered each day. In addition,
there is a minimum volume (around 500 mL) of urine that
must be produced each day to allow the body to remove
solutes. This minimum volume is governed by the body’s
ability to concentrate urine.

Angiotensinogen
Angiotensinogen is a plasma protein 
formed in the liver; it is cleaved into 
angiotensin I by the enzyme renin, 
which is produced by the kidney in 
response to either a fall in Na+ in the 
tubular fluid at the macula densa or a 
decrease in perfusion. Renin 
secretion is also increased in 
response to sympathetic stimulation 
of the kidneys. The production of 
renin to cleave angiotensin I is the 
rate-limiting step of the axis.
Angiotensin I is subsequently 
cleaved to angiotensin II through the 
actions of the angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) which is expressed in 
many capillary beds, in particular the 
lungs. Angiotensin II acts on a variety 
of targets to aid fluid and Na+ 
retention. In particular, it causes 
systemic vasoconstriction and acts 
on the kidneys, adrenal gland and 
lungs.
Brain
Angiotensin II provides a link with 
the control of fluid volume through 
stimulation of ADH secretion by the 
hypothalamus. ADH secretion is 
also directly stimulated by changes 
in the blood osmolarity, or a 
significant decrease in the circulat-
ing blood volume. These changes 
trigger the release of ADH from the 
posterior pituitary.
Adrenal
Angiotensin acts on the 
adrenal gland to stimulate 
the production of 
aldosterone, which 
promotes reabsorption of 
Na+ via the modulation of 
gene expression in the 
nephron, increasing the 
expression and activity of 
Na+ transporters.
Kidney
The kidney is both the start 
and the end-point for the 
renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone axis. It secretes 
renin to trigger retention of 
Na+ and fluid, and is the 
end-target of the cascade, 
receiving and integrating 
inputs from the brain (ADH) 
and adrenal gland 
(aldosterone) as well as from 
angiotensin II. This pathway 
allows cross-communication 
of the many different 
regulatory systems, 
providing net control of the 
regulation of ion and fluid 
levels within the body.
Blood
The blood and the extracellular fluid 
surround almost all the cells of the 
body, making it essential that the 
osmolarity remain constant. In 
addition, the blood must maintain 
adequate volume to support 
perfusion. To ensure this the blood 
osmolarity and effective circulating 
volume are monitored by the 
hypothalamus. Increases in 
osmolarity, or significant decreases in 
the effective circulating volume can 
trigger ADH release.
190
Urinary system

The secretion of the ADH is triggered by the two
major factors:
1 Osmolality of the blood: the osmoreceptors in
the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the
hypothalamus
are
extremely
sensitive
to
changes in blood osmolality.
2 Volume of blood: the loss of signiﬁcant (>5%)
amounts of the effective circulating blood vol-
ume is a powerful stimulus for ADH release.
Changes in effective circulating volume are de-
tected asaresultof achangein bloodpressure by
the baroceptors in the aortic arch and carotid
sinus, and the low-pressure receptors in the atria
of the heart, These receptors signal to the
hypothalamus.
Other factors may also act to modulate the release
of ADH:
. Pregnancy is associated with decreased osmo-
lality, as a result of the action of gonadotrophins.
These appear to modulate the sensitivity of the
osmoreceptors.
. Many drugs (e.g. morphine, barbiturates and
nicotine) are associated with triggering ADH
release. Other drugs, such as alcohol and those
drugs that antagonise the action of morphine,
can reduce ADH secretion.
Osmoreceptor cells also act on other cells in the
hypothalamus to stimulate thirst, triggering a
greater intake of water, to further regulate ﬂuid
balance. Decreased effective circulating volume
will also stimulate thirst.
Actions of ADH on the nephron
Water crosses the collecting ducts of cell mem-
branes through special water channels called
aquaporins. ADH acts on the cells of the collecting
duct by binding to V2 receptors which are G-pro-
tein-coupled receptors on the basolateral cell
membrane:
. Water transport across the apical membrane is
mediated by aquaporin II, which is incorporated
into the apical membranes in response to ADH
binding to V2 receptors on the collecting duct
cells.
. The basolateral membrane of the collecting
duct cells expresses aquaporin III channels
constitutively.
Short-term expression of aquaporin II istriggered
through the fusion of vesicles expressing the chan-
nel to the apical membrane, allowing rapid in-
creases in permeability. In the longer term expres-
sion of aquaporin II is achieved through increased
gene expression.
Due to the high osmolality of the renal medul-
lary interstitium, water ﬂows out of the collecting
duct
through
the
aquaporin
channels.
The
amount of water reabsorbed by the ADH-depen-
dent mechanism is relatively small (about 25 L/
day) compared with what is reabsorbed in the
PCT (>100 L/day), although it is crucial to main-
tain ﬂuid balance. Its importance is highlighted in
diabetes insipidus. ADH also acts on the collect-
ing duct cells in the inner medulla to increase
their permeability to urea, which aids the gener-
ation of a more hypertonic environment in the
medulla, further aiding water reabsorption from
the collecting duct.
CLINICAL Diabetes insipidus
Defects in the ADH pathway, through a lack of
production of ADH, or a defect in its receptors or
in the collecting duct cell response to receptor
binding, can lead to signiﬁcant production of dilute
urine, and this is known as diabetes insipidus.
Diabetes insipidus resulting from damage to the
neurons in the brain, which secrete the molecule,
can be treated by intravenous administration of
desmopressin, a form of ADH that acts only on the
V2 receptors and not the V1 ones (which promote
vasoconstriction). This treatment is not effective in
those forms of diabetes insipidus that result from
mutations in the ADH receptors or aquaporin II in the
kidneys.
Figure 9.6 The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone pathway. The kidney plays a crucial role as a regulator of ﬂuid
balance and blood pressure through both the production of hormones and its end-organ effects. The key hormonal
pathway is instigated by the production of renin, which activates the production of angiotensin from angiotensino-
gen. The subsequent production of angiotensin II leads to widespread effects on blood vessels and adrenal glands,
as well as the kidneys, which lead to increased ﬂuid and sodium retention and (both directly and indirectly) an
increase in blood pressure.

Metabolism of ADH
ADH has a relatively short half-life in the circula-
tion
(<20 min),
allowing
rapid
responses
to
changes in osmolality. It is broken down rapidly
in the kidney and the liver.
Regulation of Na þ and the
aldosterone axis
This feedback pathway is responsible for main-
taining the effective circulating volume in re-
sponse to loss of salt and water, e.g. as a result of
diarrhoea, vomiting, excess sweating, haemor-
rhage, heart failure. The major mechanism for Na þ
reabsorption is regulated by the renin–angiotensi-
n–aldosterone system, which is also crucial in the
regulation of ﬂuid volume. The axis is complex, as a
result of the many different signals that it inte-
grates, and is centred on three distinct factors:
1 Renin
2 Angiotensin II
3 Aldosterone.
Renin
Renin is produced in the kidney in response to
changes in the composition of the nephron’s ﬂuid
in the DCT.
Synthesis
Renin is an enzyme produced by the granular cells
of the afferent arteriolar component of the JGA. It is
not strictly a hormone because it acts by cleaving
another protein in the bloodstream, instead of
directly binding to a cellular receptor.
Mechanism of action
Renin acts on the plasma protein angiotensinogen
(also called a2-globulin or renin substrate), and
cleaves a 10-residue peptide (Angiotensin I [ATI])
from it. ATI is the rate-limiting step for the pro-
duction of angiotensin II (ATII).
Regulation of renin secretion
Release of renin is regulated by the following:
. b-Adrenergic stimulation via the renal sympa-
thetic nerves which increases renin production
and release.
. Pressure changes in the afferent arteriole, de-
tected by the smooth muscle cells of the JGA.
Decreased pressure (and hence decreased wall
tension) increases renin release.
. Cl and Na þconcentration in the distal tubule
detected by the macula densa – decreased NaCl
delivery to the macula densa will cause increased
renin secretion
Angiotensin II
ATII acts on a variety of receptors to regulate
further hormone release and act on the central
nervous system (CNS) and vasculature.
Production of ATII
The starting point for ATII production is the mol-
ecule angiotensinogen, a globular protein pro-
duced by the liver. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen,
to produce the molecule ATI. ATI is the direct
precursor for ATII, which is generated by the
removal of two amino acids by angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme (ACE). ACE is expressed on the
surface of endothelial cells, in particular in the
lungs, which are an important site of conversion,
due to its large surface area.
Function of ATII
ATII has many effects related to the regulation of
ﬂuid balance and Na þ regulation at many different
sites in the body:
. There is generalised constriction of vascular
smooth muscle in response to ATII to increase
blood pressure. However, this does not normally
decrease GFR because ATII preferentially con-
stricts the efferent arterioles.
. Increased reabsorption in the PCT occurs due to
increased activity of the Na þ/H þ exchanger in
the cells’ apical membrane.
. In the adrenal cortex, ATII triggers the release of
aldosterone
. At the hypothalamus ATII increases thirst and
promotes release of ADH.
Metabolism of ATII
The metabolism of ATII occurs in a series of steps
that alter and eliminate its biological activity:
. ATII is converted to ATIII. This seven-amino
acid molecule is produced by the enzyme angio-
tensinase on the endothelial and red blood cells.
It has less activity on vascular smooth muscle
although it has a similar potency in triggering
aldosterone production.
. ATIV is produced by the cleavage of ATIII. This
six-amino acid peptide has little biological
activity.

Urinary system

Aldosterone
Aldosterone is a steroid hormone secreted by
the adrenal cortex. It acts by modulating gene
expression in the DCT and collecting ducts,
which promotes the retention of Na þ, thus
increasing water reabsorption. Aldosterone also
acts within the parotid glands and the colon
to modulate gene expression and promote re-
tention of Na þ within the body. The synthesis
of aldosterone is covered with that of other
steroid hormones in Chapter 10.
Function of aldosterone
Aldosterone acts to increase the reclamation of
Na þ from the DCT, and promotes the secretion
of K þ or H þ. The mechanisms by which this is
achieved include altering the expression of speciﬁc
genes to:
. increase ENaC expression in the luminal surface
of the collecting duct cells
. increase the number of Na þ/K þATPases in
the basolateral membrane of tubular epithelial
cells
. increase production of ATP in the tubular epi-
thelium and so increase active transport
. increase expression of the thiazide-sensitive
Na þ/Cl transporter in the DCT.
Aldosterone can act through more rapid me-
chanisms that do not alter gene expression, in
particular by increasing the activity of the Na þ/
H þ antiporter (NXH) protein.
Regulation of aldosterone secretion
Aldosterone secretion is stimulated by a number of
stimuli:
. ATII which is the most potent stimulator of
secretion
. Increased plasma K þ concentration
. Increased
adrenocorticotrophic
hormone
(ACTH)
. Decreased atrial natriuretic peptide
. Decreased plasma Na þ concentration.
Modulation of systemic pH by the
kidneys
Plasma pH must be maintained within a very
narrow range, ideally between 7.35 and 7.45.
The ingestion of acids and alkalis from the
diet has the potential to seriously compromise
this balance. Although buffering and respiratory
correction can regulate pH in the short term, any
change in the production of H þ must result in
an equivalent change in regulation by the kid-
neys. The total systemic regulation of pH is
discussed in Chapter 11.
H þ handling by the kidneys
H þ handling in the kidneys contributes to the
regulation of pH in two manners:
1 Much of the H þ is recycled in the reclamation of
HCO3
.
2 H þ
is secreted into the tubule ﬂuid and
excreted in the urine to remove acid from
the system.
Removal of H þ by the kidneys
H þ is removed from the kidneys through the ex-
cretion of the ammonium ion (NH4
þ) and acid
phosphate (HPO4
). Ammonium may be either
produced in the tubules as part of the ornithine
cycle or generated in the nephron itself from
ammonia:
. NH4
þ is primarily produced as part of the
ornithine
cycle.
Glutamine
metabolism
in
the kidney tubule cells results in the produc-
tion of: 2HCO3

þ 2NH4
þ. The retention
of the two HCO3
 molecules is equivalent
to
the
extrusion
of
two
H þ
molecules.
NH4
þ is transported into the tubule by the
NXH – where it can substitute for the H þ
DEFINITION Diffusion trapping
Weak acids and bases may exist in equilibrium
between charged and uncharged states. This equi-
librium is governed by the H þ concentration (pH).
Although the uncharged variant of a molecule may
readily diffuse across the tubule membrane, its
charged variant may not. This difference can be
accentuated by the more acid nature of the nephron
tubule, in relation to the blood, which traps sub-
stances in one or other compartment. This can
occur physiologically, as in the handling of ammo-
nia, or, clinically, as in the treatment of aspirin
overdose.
Urinary system 193

ions. This process occurs mainly in the PCT,
although a proportion of NH4
þ is reabsorbed
in the loop of Henle.
. Ammonia (NH3) can also be produced in the
nephron. As it is not charged, NH3 freely
diffuses into the tubule, where it is protonated
to NH4
þ, allowing H þ removal by diffusion
trapping.
. HPO4
 is mainly ﬁltered in the form of alkaline
phosphate (Na2HPO4). Absorption of Na þ and
secretion of H þ into the lumen converts this
into acid phosphate (NaH2PO4), allowing H þ
removal.
CLINICAL Pharmacological modulation
of urinary pH
The pH of urine can be modulated to promote or
reduce the excretion of drugs, as a result of diffu-
sion trapping. The modulation of pH results in
different proportions of the drugs existing in pro-
tonated or unprotonated forms. Clinically, the mod-
ulation of pH can be used to treat aspirin overdose.
Bicarbonate is used to increase urinary pH, be-
cause it increases the trapping of salicylate from
the urine, through eliminating H þ ions donated by
aspirin (salicylic acid).
CLINICAL Renal tubular acidosis
Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a syndrome char-
acterised by metabolic acidosis resulting from a
defect in acid handling by the nephron. This can be
the result of:
. insufﬁcient recovery of HCO3

. insufﬁcient secretion of H þ.
There are a variety of causes of RTA, including:
. Genetic defects, such as a mutation of the H þ
ATPase
. An autoimmune condition
. Some toxins.
The symptoms
of
RTA include a metabolic
acidosis,
hypokalaemia
and
kidney
stones.
Treatment is by giving bicarbonate to correct
pH, and addition of potassium to correct the
hypokalaemia.
Kidney hormones
The high blood ﬂow in the kidneys allows it
to sense any changes in blood composition very
rapidly and release hormones in response. Other
than renin, which has been previously covered,
two factors are produced by the kidneys:
1 Erythropoietin which regulates production of
red blood cells
2 Vitamin D which is involved in the regulation of
Ca2 þ.
Erythropoietin
Erythropoietin (EPO) regulates red blood cell pro-
duction, and therefore the oxygen-carrying capa-
bility of the blood.
Synthesis and secretion
EPO is a glycoprotein that, in adults, is produced
almost exclusively by ﬁbroblast-like cells in the
kidney interstitium, although small amounts are
also produced in hepatocytes. In the fetus the liver
is the major source of EPO.
Functions and regulation
EPO is a mitogenic growth factor and induces
proliferation of red blood cell precursors in the
bone marrow. Production of EPO is stimulated
under
hypoxic
conditions
and
in
response
toanaemia–wheretherewillbealowerO2-carrying
capability. Excess EPO production can result in
polycythaemia, whereas failure to produce EPO
occurs in chronic renal failure and causes anaemia.
Patients with chronic renal failure need to be trea-
ted with recombinant human EPO.
Vitamin D
The kidneys form part of the series of organs that
process vitamin D into its active form. In the kidney
25-hydroxyvitamin D from the liveris hydroxylated
by 1a-hydroxylase to calcitriol (active vitamin D),
1,25-dihydroxy- vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2-vitamin
D3).
Calcitriol,
a
steroid
hormone,
increases
total body calcium; the mechanism of action and
its role in calcium homoeostasis are covered in
Chapter 10.

Urinary system

Pharmacological
modulation of kidney
function
The reabsorption of ﬂuid by the nephron is tightly
coupled with reabsorption of ions, in particular
Na þ. When the body retains too much ﬂuid, phar-
macological diuretics can be used to modulate
reabsorption of water, to reduce the total body
ﬂuid load, in particular to treat heart failure
or hypertension. Although diuretics reduce the
symptoms of both diseases, they do not actually
treat the underlying cause. The three main classes
of diuretic that are routinely used act on different
regions of the nephron, through inhibition of ion
transport, which subsequently hinders the reab-
sorption of H2O:
1 Loop diuretics
2 Thiazides
3 Potassium-sparing diuretics.
Two other classes of drug have diuretic effects,
although due to side effects they are rarely used
clinically:
1 Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
2 Osmotic diuretics.
Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide)
Loop diuretics are the most powerful form of di-
uretic, targeting the loop of Henle to mediate their
actions in the kidney.
Mechanism of action
Loop diuretics are actively secreted into the lumen
of the tubule, from where they act. They have both
a rapid onset of effect and a short half-life. A variety
of different actions contributes to the effectiveness
of loop diuretics, although the ﬁrst is the most
signiﬁcant:
. Inhibition of the Na þ/K þ/2Cl co-transporter
on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.
This reduces the concentration gradient gener-
ated within the medulla of the kidney, restricting
the reabsorption of ﬂuid from the collecting duct.
. Vasodilatation of the vasa recta increases the
blood ﬂow entering the medulla, and is thought
to further hinder the generation of a concentra-
tion
gradient,
because
it
increases
solute
‘washout’ from the renal medulla.
. Systemic vasodilatation leads to an increased
cardiac output, which increases renal perfusion,
particularly in individuals with cardiac failure,
and reduces the stimuli for ﬂuid retention.
Side-effects of loop diuretics
The side-effects of loop diuretics may be quite
severe, and affect a variety of processes:
. Hypokalaemia occurs due to the body’s at-
tempts to reclaim the extra Na þ reaching the
DCT. The elevated Na þ leads to increased activ-
ity of the Na þ/K þ ATPase in the basolateral
membrane. This pumps Na þ out of the cells and
recruits K þ from the interstitial ﬂuid into the
cells, from whence it is transported to the tubular
lumen. The rate of K þ secretion is also enhanced
by the high tubular ﬂow rate.
. Postural hypotension may occur as a result of
the decrease in systemic ﬂuid and also the vaso-
dilatory effects of loop diuretics.
CLINICAL Polycythaemia
Polycythaemia is the excess production of red blood
cells. This results in hyperviscosity and increased
effective circulating volume. Clinical measurements
such as the haematocrit are correspondingly in-
creased. Polycythaemia can be divided into primary
or secondary:
. Primary (polycythaemia rubra vera) is a myelo-
proliferative disorder resulting from excessive
production of normal marrow stem cells. There
may also be an increase in the number of gran-
ulocytes and platelets.
. Secondary is caused by an increase in EPO,
appropriately due to, for example, high altitude
or heavy cigarette smoking.
Symptoms of polycythaemia include hyperten-
sion, headaches, lethargy, itching, and risk of
haemorrhage and thrombosis. Patients are trea-
ted with venesection, which aims to decrease
the blood volume by removing red blood cells.
If there is an underlying cause (e.g. EPO-
secreting tumour) that can be corrected, suc-
cessful treatment usually results in resolution of
the polycythaemia.
Urinary system 195

. Loss of Mg2 þand Ca2 þ may result from loss of
the lumen-positive
electrochemical
gradient
across the cells of the thick ascending limb,
which drives the reabsorption process.
. Secondary hyperaldosteronism may result from
the activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
axis, which also further increases the loss of Kþ.
. Carbohydrate
intolerance
may result
from
the loss of K þ, on which insulin is dependent
for its action.
Thiazide diuretics (e.g.
hydrochlorothiazide)
These have a weaker action than loop diuretics,
inhibiting the reabsorption of Na þ from the DCT.
Mechanism of action
Thiazides inhibit the Na þ/Cl  co-transporter in
the DCT. Similar to loop diuretics, thiazides cause
vasodilatation, which is beneﬁcial in their use to
treat heart failure and hypertension.
Side-effects
The side-effects of thiazides are very similar to
those of loop diuretics, although milder, because
the loss of K þ is less severe.
. Hypokalaemia may occur, although less extreme
than in loop diuretics, because fewer Naþ ions
enters the DCT for reabsorption. Similarly, sec-
ondary hyperaldosteronism and carbohydrate in-
tolerance may also occur, as seen in loop diuretics.
. Gout may result because thiazides can compete
with the uric acid transporter.
. Ca2 þretention is associated with the use of
thiazides, although the mechanism is not clear.
CLINICAL Gout
Gout results from the deposition of uric acid crystals
within the tissues. These crystals form as a result of
high levels of uric acid in the blood and cause a
variety of symptoms, including arthritis, tenosyno-
vitis, kidney stones and hypertension.
Potassium-sparing diuretics
The loss of K þ ions through the use of loop and
thiazide diuretics can lead to many side effects. In
particular, K þ loss may be potentiated by the
actions of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone ax-
is to reclaim the excess Na þ in the distal parts of
the nephron. Two classes of K þ-sparing diuretics
with different mechanisms of action have been
identiﬁed:
1 Direct aldosterone antagonists (e.g. spirono-
lactone)
2 K þ channel blockers (e.g. amiloride).
Both drugs act at the more distal regions of the DCT
and have a relatively weak effect when used alone,
although they both act well to oppose high aldo-
sterone levels. K þ-sparing diuretics are often used
in combination with loop or thiazide diuretics,
which indirectly cause increased aldosterone le-
vels as a result of the high Na þ levels passing
through the DCT.
Side-effects
By acting to inhibit the loss of K þ, the major side
effect that may be caused is hyperkalaemia.
Other classes of diuretic
Although loop, thiazide and K þ-sparing diuretics
are the main classes of diuretic used clinically, two
other types are used in speciﬁc situations:
. Osmotic diuretics
. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
Osmotic diuretics (e.g. mannitol)
Mannitol is freely ﬁltered by the kidneys but can-
not be reabsorbed. As ﬂuid is reabsorbed from the
PCT, the concentration of mannitol in the lumen
increases and osmotically opposes water reab-
sorption (and therefore the absorption of many
ions). Osmotic diuretics are rarely used as a result.
However, they may be used in:
. the treatment of cerebral oedema
. patients who have not responded to other classes
of diuretic.
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
(e.g. acetazolamide)
Carbonic anhydrase catalyses the formation of H þ
and HCO3
 from H2O and CO2 in the nephron
cells, as part of the reclamation of bicarbonate. The
H þ produced in this process enters the ﬁltrate to
react with H2O and CO2 and generate further bi-
carbonate. Secretion of H þ is balanced by the
reabsorption of Na þ down its concentration gra-
dient, which promotes the reabsorption of H2O.
Thus, inhibition of carbonic anhydrase reduces
196
Urinary system

H þ secretion, leading to reduced Na þ absorption
from the PCT and reduced ﬂuid reabsorption.
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are no longer
commonly
used
because
their
inhibition
of
HCO3
 formation severely affects the pH balance
within the body, where HCO3
 is a major buffer.
Thus, a common side effect of carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors is metabolic acidosis. The decreased
reabsorption of Na þ in the PCT may lead to in-
creased reabsorption within the DCT, and can
potentiate the development of hypokalaemia.
Transport, storage and
expulsion of urine
The kidneys constantly produce urine, although
the body expels it infrequently. In the meantime, it
is stored in the bladder. As the osmolality of urine
may be quite variable, the bladder is adapted to
accommodate this and the varying volumes of
urine stored within it, and also develop sufﬁcient
pressure for urine expulsion. The adult bladder is
capable of storing around 500 mL of urine, though
this varies with the individual. Three structures are
involved in the storage and expulsion of urine:
1 The ureters
2 The bladder
3 The urethra.
The gross anatomy has been discussed earlier,
although their morphology and function are dis-
cussed below.
The ureters
The ureters are muscular tubes that exit from the
hilum of the kidney. They are retroperitoneal and
adhere to the posterior peritoneum within the
abdomen.
Histology of the ureters
The ureters contain three layers of particular func-
tional signiﬁcance:
1 The urothelium (transitional epithelium) is in
contact with urine, and protects the underlying
cells from potentially harmful substances within
the urine and prevents movement of water if the
urine is hypertonic.
2 The inner muscular layer is made up of longi-
tudinal smooth muscle.
3 The outer muscular layer is made up of circular
smooth muscle.
The muscular layers of the ureters are a functional
syncytium, allowing the coordinated contraction
of the muscle cells, forcing urine from the kidneys
into the bladder. These peristaltic waves occur
around every 10–30 s. The contraction of the ur-
eters is triggered intrinsically by the smooth mus-
cles cells at the proximal end of the ureter, al-
though they may be modulated by autonomic
innervation. Sensory pain ﬁbres also innervate the
ureters, and can be stimulated by blockages, such
as kidney stones. Such blockages trigger more
violent contractions in an attempt to force the
stone out of the ureter, and are associated with
severe pain.
CLINICAL Kidney stones
Kidney stones are crystals that form from high levels
of minerals in the urine. This is typically the result of
an underlying pathology which determines their
composition. Stones may range in size from minute,
which are passed without the individual being
aware, to much larger stones that may be many
centimetres in size.
Large stones may become lodged in the renal
pelvis, bladder, or the ureters or urethra. The result-
ing referred pain depends on the location where the
stone becomes lodged. The location may also ac-
count for other symptoms, e.g. a urethral kidney
stone is likely to decrease urine ﬂow, because it
blocks the outﬂow, whereas ureteric stones are
associated with renal colic, linked to peristaltic
contraction of the ureters.
Stones much larger than 5 mm require interven-
tion for their removal. This typically involves ultra-
sonic waves, or another form of stimulation, to break
down the stone. Particularly large stones may re-
quire surgical removal.
The bladder
The bladder wall is made up of two main
tissues:
1 The inner surface is lined with specialised ur-
othelial cells which can tolerate the wide range
of osmolalities found in the bladder.
2 The rest of the bladder wall is made up of the
detrusor muscle.
The trigone is a triangular region on the posterior
part of the bladder, which has a different embry-
ological origin to the rest of the bladder, and does
not expand.
Urinary system 197

The urothelium
The urothelial (or umbrella) cells must be resistant
to the hyperosmolarity of the urine and maintain
this resistance as the bladder expands and con-
tracts. They are characterised by a plasma mem-
brane which contains a series of plaques that are
folded within the surface membrane; this leads to
the presence of a series of vesicles in the apical
surface that can unfold and become incorporated
into the membrane to increase the surface area on
expansion of the bladder. The urothelial cells are
connected to each other by many junctional com-
plexes to maintain cohesion.
The detrusor muscle
The detrusor muscle in the wall of the bladder is
spontaneously active, such that the ﬁbres can alter
their length as the bladder ﬁlls. The cells of the
detrusor muscle are highly innervated and con-
nected by many gap junctions, allowing the rapid
conduction of an impulse to maintain contraction.
The length of the muscle ﬁbres may change by
about four times between an empty and a full
bladder. This constant changing of ﬁbre length
ensures that the bladder remains compact without
the internal pressure being too high, which could
potentially allow urine to pass back to the kidneys.
Innervation of the bladder
The walls and sphincters of the bladder receive
sensory and autonomic motor nerve ﬁbres that
sense ﬁlling of the bladder and regulate voiding.
The innervation of the walls ensures that the blad-
der remains contracted around the ﬂuid such that
it does not take up too much space within the body.
Contraction of the bladder must be even during
voiding to ensure that other regions of the bladder
do not expand under the increased intravascular
pressure. The different nervous ﬁbres have differ-
ent roles in regulating the bladder:
. Sympathetic innervation is mainly to the neck of
the bladder, where it regulates the contraction of
the urethra and internal urethral sphincter. This
may prevent voiding of urine and prevents entry
of seminal ﬂuid into the bladder during ejacula-
tion. The sympathetic innervation of the bladder
is carried by the hypogastric nerves.
. Parasympathetic innervation from S2–4 to the
bladder walls mediates contraction of the blad-
der, particularly during voiding.
. Sensory innervation is predominantly to the
fundus, to detect ﬁlling of the bladder.
. Somatic motor innervation is carried by the
pudendal nerves, and innervates the external
urethral sphincter, which provides voluntary
control of voiding.
Regulation of bladder tone
When the bladder is relatively empty, the detrusor
muscle has little tone, so that pressure within the
bladder is relatively low. At the same time, the
internal and external bladder sphincters are con-
tracted to prevent the unintentional expulsion of
urine into the urethra.
The trigone
The trigone is a triangular region found at the
posterior aspect of the bladder. Unlike the rest of
the bladder it is derived from the mesonephric
ducts, as opposed to the urogenital sinus. The
ureters and urethra enter the bladder at the cor-
ner of the trigone. In particular, the ureters enter
at an oblique angle which acts as a one-way
valve to prevent reﬂux of urine at higher bladder
pressures – in some individuals this angle is not
present, predisposing the affected individual to
reﬂux of urine to the kidneys, and infection.
The urethra and the control of
micturition
The urethra links the bladder to the external envi-
ronment and its course varies between the sexes.
Micturition is unusual in that it is an autonomic
process under a signiﬁcant degree of voluntary
control. As the bladder ﬁlls, sensory neurons report
the ﬁlling to centres within the brain stem which
reduce the signals, inhibiting contraction of the
detrusor muscle. Higher cortical centres are re-
quired to act to allow relaxation of the external
sphincter, which is required for the bladder to
empty at low pressure. This relaxation of the
sphincter and the simultaneous contraction of the
detrusor muscle trigger the expulsion of urine.
During ﬁlling, the bladder neck, which is made
up of circular smooth muscle, is closed. In addi-
tion, the urethra iskept closed byvoluntary sphinc-
ters made up of striated muscle:
. In males the membranous part of the urethra is
covered with striated muscle.
. In females the shorter urethra is covered in stri-
ated muscle across its length.
198
Urinary system

Urinary sphincters
Two sphincters separate the urethra from the
bladder:
1 The internal urethral sphincter is made up of
cells that form part of the syncytium of the
bladder walls. These muscle ﬁbres are arranged
in a radial pattern, so contraction causes open-
ing of the neck of the bladder.
2 The external urethral sphincter lies distal to the
internal sphincter. This band of muscle, which
surrounds, the urethra is under voluntary con-
trol and is innervated by the pudendal nerve.
Voluntary relaxation of the external sphincter is
required to allow micturition to occur.
The micturition reﬂex
Bladder function is regulated by the micturition
reﬂex, although this is inhibited by higher centres
to ensure that voiding occurs only when there is a
suitable opportunity. As a result, the control of
urination has two stages:
1 Autonomic control – the micturition reﬂex
2 Somatic control learned during infancy.
Autonomic regulation of urination
As the bladder ﬁlls, it expands such that the pres-
sure within it increases only when it is relatively
full. Increase in pressure is detected by stretch
receptors in the detrusor muscle. Sensory impulses
are carried to the spinal cord, where they trigger
parasympathetic outﬂow to the bladder:
. The detrusor muscle contracts to increase the
pressure.
. The internal urethral sphincter relaxes to allow
expulsion of urine.
The contraction of the detrusor muscle further
increases the pressure detected by the stretch re-
ceptors in the detrusor muscle, stimulating con-
traction of the detrusor until the urine is voided.
Somatic control of the urination
Control of urination can be learnt, to override the
autonomic reﬂex. There are two major points that
allow regulation of the micturition reﬂex:
1 Control of theexternal urethralsphincter –this
sphincter is made up of skeletal muscle, which is
under voluntary control. Contract of the external
sphincter prevents expulsion of urine regardless
of the state of the internal sphincter.
2 Higher centrescansuppresstheautonomicmic-
turition reﬂex. When voiding becomes possible,
this inhibition is relaxed to allow the autonomic
micturition relaxation to proceed as normal.
CLINICAL Urinary incontinence
Urinary incontinence is relatively common in older
patients, particularly those aged >75. There are
various causes of incontinence and these can be
categorised. Of particular signiﬁcance is overﬂow
incontinence,which is due to an underlyingobstruc-
tion of the urethra. This often occurs in older men as
a result of prostate hypertrophy obstructing the
urethra. Urge incontinence may result from pathol-
ogy of the detrusor muscle.
CLINICAL Prostatic hypertrophy
The prostate gland is part of the male reproductive
system and is located around the neck of the blad-
der. In older men hypertrophy of the prostate gland
isparticularlycommon,whichcanconstricttheneck
of the bladder and the urethra, resulting in difﬁculty
in urinating. Prostatic hypertrophy may be treated
by drugs to relax the neck of the bladder, or in more
extreme cases through surgery.

CLINICAL Voluntary control of
micturition
Voluntary control of bladder function has to be learnt
at an early age. In infants, the voiding of the bladder
is regulated solely by the autonomic reﬂexes that
are in place. In individuals with spinal injuries, par-
ticularly to the sacral region, elements of the mic-
turition reﬂex may be eliminated and can trigger
forms of incontinence.

Endocrinology
The endocrine system is network of multiple
organs
that
release
hormones
to
maintain
homoeostasis.
These chemical messengers are typically re-
leased into the bloodstream and inﬂuence many
cells of the body to induce a desired response.
Although they do not provide the same speed of
response as the nervous system, hormones can
travel throughout the body and trigger responses
in many different tissues – resulting in widespread
effects. In addition, many induce changes at
a genetic level.
Overview of
endocrinology
Hormones
Hormones are chemical signals secreted into the
bloodstream which act on distant tissues that ex-
press hormone speciﬁc receptors. Effects of hor-
mones can be classiﬁed depending on the site of
action relative to where the hormone was released:
. Endocrine – travels in blood to distant target
organ
. Paracrine – hormone released from one cell has
a biological effect on a neighbouring cell
. Autocrine – hormone has a biological effect on
the cell from which it was released.
Hormones themselves can be classiﬁed into
amines, peptides and steroids.
Amines (e.g. adrenaline)
. They are synthesised from the amino acid
tyrosine.
. They act via receptors on the surface of cells.
. They are stored as granules in the cytoplasm until
release is triggered by stimuli.
. Their effects are short term and they act within
minutes.
Peptides (e.g. insulin)
Peptides are lipophobic and bind to receptors on
the surface of cells:
. Formed
from
pre-prohormones
which
undergo
post-translational
processing
(e.g.
pre-proinsulin is converted to proinsulin and
then insulin).
. Secretion can be constitutive or regulated. In
constitutive secretion, the hormone is secreted
as it is synthesised; in regulated secretion the
hormone is stored within the cell in secretory
granules and released in response to stimuli.
. Their effects are mainly short term and they act
within minutes. They may also trigger longer-
term effects within the cell, e.g. upregulating
transcription.
Steroids (e.g. cortisol)
. They are lipophilic: they can cross cell mem-
branes and act on intracellular receptors.
. They are synthesised from cholesterol in the
adrenal cortex, gonads and placenta.
Biomedical Science Lecture Notes, First Edition. Ian Lyons.

. Once secreted, steroid hormones are rapidly re-
leased and not stored within the secretory cells.
. In general their effects are more long term; the
effects are seen after a few hours and may last for
days. More recently, it has also been demonstrat-
ed that steroid hormones may have some more
rapid effects via action on cell surface receptors.
Hormones are either transported freely (hydro-
philic hormones) or bound to carrier proteins.
These proteins are mostly globulins synthesised
in the liver, acting to prolong the half-life of the
hormone and allowing regulation of the activity
of the hormones through regulation of the levels of
free hormone.
Hormones are removed from the circulation
either by inactivation in the liver (followed by
excretion by the liver or kidneys) or degradation
at the target cell, via internalisation of the
hormone–receptor complex followed by lysosomal
degradation.
Hormone receptors
The site of action of hormones is determined
mainly by the chemical properties of the molecule –
those hormones that are lipid soluble can diffuse
through the cell membrane to act directly on intra-
cellular receptors, whereas those which are not
must bind to cell membrane receptors.
Cell membrane receptors
Hormone binding to cell membrane receptors
triggers an intracellular signalling cascade. There
are two types of these receptors:
1 Ligand-gated ion channels: binding stimulates
opening of ion channels and consequent ion
ﬂuxes
2 Receptors that regulate the activity of intracel-
lular proteins, e.g. G-protein-coupled receptors
or receptor protein tyrosine kinase.
Generally amines and peptide hormones act via
these receptors, and the effects are mediated very
quickly (within minutes). Recent evidence has
shown that some steroid hormones may act via
cell membrane receptors, in addition to their
better understood intracellular effects.
Intracellular receptors
These are transcription factors that have binding
sites for the hormone. They bind lipid-soluble
hormones
(which
can
pass
freely
through
the cell membrane) in the cytoplasm and migrate
to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription
by binding to hormone response elements. Gen-
erally, steroid hormones act via these receptors
and the effects take longer (hours to days) to be
mediated.
The pituitary gland
The pituitary gland is the major homoeostatic
gland, releasing hormones that can modulate
every system and process in the body. It integrates
hormonal signals in the blood from the hypotha-
lamic capillary beds with neural signals from
the brain, and releases hormones which enter the
systemic circulation through the jugular vein.
Development of the pituitary gland
The anterior and posterior parts of the pituitary
gland have different embryological derivations,
which fuse to form the pituitary gland during
weeks 4 and 5 of gestation:
. The anterior pituitary is formed from the ecto-
dermal tissue in the roof of the mouth which
grows upwards to form Rathke’s pouch.
. The posterior pituitary is formed from a down-
ward process of the forebrain vesicle, known as
the infundibulum.
The fusion of the anterior and posterior pituitary
is followed by the anterior pituitary budding off
from the ectoderm, leaving the entire gland
supported by the stalk of the posterior pituitary.
The anterior pituitary
The anterior pituitary gland contains many distinct
types of endocrine cells, which secrete hormones,
and folliculostellate cells, which have a glial
type
of
supporting
function.
Five
different
types of endocrine cell are found in the anterior
pituitary, each associated with a distinct regulatory
axis:
1 Thyrotrophs release thryotrophin (also known
as thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH). This
hormone regulates the release of thyroid hor-
mones through its actions on the follicular cells
in the thyroid gland.
Endocrinology 201

2 Corticotrophs
release
adrenocorticotrophic
hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the release
of cortisol, a steroid hormone, from the adrenal
cortex.
3 Somatotrophs
release
growth
hormone,
which regulates tissue growth. This is via
direct effects on the tissues, or through the
release of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)
from the liver
4 Gonadotrophs release luteinising hormone
(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
which are involved in the regulation of the re-
productive system. In women, the cyclic release
of these hormones is responsible for controlling
the menstrual cycle.
5 Lactotrophs regulate the production of milk in
breastfeeding women, and are also important in
breast development through the production
of prolactin. It is not clear if this hormone has
a signiﬁcant function in men.
Control of anterior pituitary hormones
The anterior pituitary integrates signals from the
body and the brain to regulate the release of
hormones. The major inputs are received from
three sources:
1 The hypothalamus releases neurohormones
into the portal vessels between the hypo-
thalamus and the anterior pituitary.
2 Systemic hormones released by other tissues in
the body may feed back to modulate the secre-
tion of signals from the pituitary.
3 The cells in the pituitary gland may act in
a paracrine manner to regulate each other.
The posterior pituitary
The posterior pituitary contains the ending of the
nerves cells located in the supraoptic and para-
ventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus which
directly release the hormones from their nerve
terminals:
1 Oxytocin regulates contractions during labour
and the production of milk by the breast. These
processes are discussed in the reproduction
chapter.
2 Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as
vasopressin, is crucial for the regulation of sys-
temic ﬂuid volume. The role of ADH in discussed
in more detail in relation to kidney function and
ﬂuid balance.
The thyroid axis
The thyroid axis regulates the basal metabolic rate
of an individual and is important in the young to
regulate growth and development. The crucial end
hormones are the thyroid hormones (triiodothy-
ronine or T3 and thyroxine or T4). Their widespread
effects are evident by the expression of the thyroid
hormone receptor in almost every cell in the body.
Structures in the thyroid axis
Three main glands are involved in this axis, each
releasing a speciﬁc hormone (Fig. 10.1):
1 The
hypothalamus
releases
thyrotrophin-
releasing hormone (TRH).
2 Thyrotroph cells in the anterior pituitary release
TSH in response to TRH.
3 The follicular cells in the thyroid gland produce
T4 in response to TSH. T4 is the end-hormone
of the pathway, and also suppresses secretion of
TRH.

The thyroid gland contains two prominent groups

Endocrinology

1 The follicular cells are crucial for the release of
T4. These are arranged to form spheres (follicles)
which contain thyroglobulin, a precursor to T4.
2 The interstitial C cells are sparsely distributed
between the follicles and responsible for the
release of calcitonin – a hormone involved in
the regulation of calcium and phosphate.
There are also many interstitial cells between the
follicles. The thyroid gland contains many capillar-
ies and lymphatic vessels. Thegross anatomy of the
thyroid gland is discussed in Chapter 14.
Synthesis and secretion of
thyrotrophin-releasing hormone
TRH is a tripeptide molecule released by the
paraventricular
nucleus
of the hypothalamus
as a regulator of metabolism, through stimulation
of the release of TSH from the pituitary gland
which, in turn, acts on the release of thyroid
hormones.
Thyrotrophin (thyroid-stimulating
hormone)
TSH is the major stimulus to act on the thyroid
gland triggering production and release of the
thyroid hormones.
Synthesis and secretion
TSH is a glycoprotein made in the thyrotroph cells
of the anterior pituitary, which make up about 10%
of the cells. The hormone is made up of an a
subunit, common to TSH, FSH and LH, and
a unique b subunit. TSH is stored in granules in
the cytoplasm of the thyrotroph cells.
Regulation of secretion
Release of TSH is triggered by TRH. TSH, in turn,
stimulates the production of thyroid hormones,
which act to negatively inhibit the production of
TRH and TSH. It is thought that the major mech-
anism of this negative feedback is through down-
regulation of TRH receptors on the thyrotroph
cells, in response to increased levels of thyroid
hormones. TSH production is also reduced by
somatostatin from the anterior pituitary.
Actions on target organs
TSH acts on the thyroid gland where it is the major
factor stimulating release of thyroid hormones.
TSH binds a G-protein-coupled receptor which
promotes the production of the second messenger,
cAMP.
CLINICAL Prenatal hypothyroidism
(formerly called cretinism)
Thyroid hormones are crucial to ensure correct
neural development. Thus, prenatal thyroid deﬁ-
ciency can lead to severe defects. This includes
learning disability, general poor neural develop-
ment, stunted growth and a protruding tongue. The
effects of deﬁciency are quite reversible if identiﬁed
at birth (using the Guthrie test). Treatment is through
giving thyroid hormones.
Synthesis and secretion
of thyroid hormones
There are two main thyroid hormones – T4 and T3 –
both of which are produced and released by
follicular cells in the thyroid gland.
Structure of thyroid hormones
A variety of thyroid hormones exists. Each shares
the same basic structure but varies in terms of the
number and location of sites that have been
iodinated. There are four important variants of
thyroid molecules (Fig. 10.2):
1 Thyronine is the carbon skeleton that is com-
mon to all the thyroid hormones. The varying
thyroid hormones consist of a thyronine skele-
ton, which possess iodine at up to four distinct
sites on the molecule.
2 T4 is the major product of the thyroid gland. It
consists of a thyronine skeleton iodinated at
all four available sites. It is relatively inactive
as a hormone, and serves primarily as a
reservoir for T3, a far more active variant of the
hormone.
3 T3 is the major active thyroid hormone and
contains three iodinated sites. It is primarily
produced by deiodination of T4 in tissues,
although in times of low iodine levels it may also
be produced at high levels by the thyroid.
4 Reverse T3(rT3) is an inactive thyroid hormone
that is produced by the deiodination of T4. The
deiodination of an alternative site yields rT3
which is incapable of binding the thyroid hor-
mone receptor.
Endocrinology 203

Speciﬁc tissues, such as the placenta and the
brain, express deiodinase enzymes themselves,
allowing them to regulate the relative proportions
of T3 and rT3 produced from T4. This allows those
tissues to control the amount of T3 that binds the
receptor, relatively independent of the circulating
levels of T4 and T3.
Synthesis and storage
The production of thyroid hormones is reﬂected
in the histological organisation of the gland. The
follicular cells are arranged in large spherical sacs
surrounding a ﬂuid suspension containing the
glycoprotein thyroglobulin, which is produced and
secreted by the follicular cells.
Active thyroid hormones are iodinated after the
transport of iodine from the blood into the follicles.
Once in the follicle, the iodine binds to speciﬁc
tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin catalysed by
thyroid peroxidase. After the addition of iodine,
the iodotyrosine residues become coupled to form
T3 or T4. Each thyroglobulin molecule produces up
to four thyroid hormone molecules.

Thyronine
Thyronine is the skeleton that forms the basis of 
all thyroid hormones, it is formed within the 
thyroglobulin protein and the thyroid hormones 
vary, depending on whether they are iodinated 
at four specific locations on the thyronine 
skeleton.
Thyroxine
Thyroxine (T4) is the major product of the thyroid 
gland, and is iodinated at all four available 
locations. It has little direct biological activity, 
although it acts as a precursor to triiodothyro-
nine (T3).
Triiodothyronine
T3 is the most biologically active thyroid 
hormone although it is present in much lower 
concentrations in the blood than T4. The thyroid 
gland usually releases 20-fold more T4 than T3. 
It is mainly formed in the periphery by the 
deiodination of T4.
Reverse triiodothyronine 
Reverse T3 (rT3) is a non-active isomer of T3 
and differs in the sites at which it is iodinated. It 
can be produced from T4 through a different set 
of deiodination reactions. In particular, when 
there is an excess of cortisol (e.g. under 
stressful conditions), the inhibited conversion of 
T4 to T3 results in shunting towards rT3, slowing 
metabolism and potentially producing features of 
hypothyroidism.
Figure 10.2 The thyroid hormonesall follow the same basic structure,made up of two conjugated tyrosine residues.
They vary in the number of sites of iodination (in blue), and the positions in which they have been iodinated. There
are three signiﬁcant structures – thyroxine (T4) which is the most commonly produced form, triiodothyronine (T3)
which is the most metabolically active, and reverse T3, which is a non-active form produced from T4.
204
Endocrinology

Thyroid hormones are stored in an iodinated
form as an integral part of the thyroglobulin mol-
ecule, until they are required for release. This is
achieved through endocytosis of thyroglobulin
into follicular cells. Lysosomes then fuse with the
thyroglobulin-containing vesicles and are enzy-
matically cleaved to release T3 and T4, in response
to TSH.
Regulation of thyroid hormone
release
Themainstimulusforthereleaseofthyroidhormones
is
the
TSH.
Regulation
of
the
hypothalamic–
pituitary–thyroid
axis
is
by
negative
feedback,
because T3 and T4 act on the pituitary and the
hypothalamus to reduce the release of TRH and
TSH, respectively, so that during adult life the levels
of each are maintained relatively constant.
Actions on target organs
Thyroid hormones bind strongly to serum pro-
teins, T4 binding slightly more strongly than T3.
Less than 0.5% of thyroid hormones are found free
in the plasma. As most cells do not take up bound
hormones, most of the effects of thyroid hormone
are mediated by free hormone.
Thyroid hormones are transported into cells by
a membrane-bound transport system (although
due to their lipid-soluble nature some movement
into the cell may occur through simple diffusion)
and bind to thyroid hormone receptors, which are
nuclear receptors. T3 binds more effectively than
T4. Activated thyroid hormone receptors bind to
speciﬁc DNA sequences – thyroid response ele-
ments (TREs) – which modulate the expression of
a variety of genes resulting in an increase in the
basal metabolic rate. Speciﬁc actions of thyroid
hormones include increases in:
. expression of Na þ/K þATPase
. protein production through increases in RNA
polymerases
. protein and carbohydrate metabolism
. breakdown of lipids and cholesterols.
Metabolism
T3 and T4 are inactivated through deiodination,
and then excreted. T4 can be converted into
the more pharmacologically active T3 through the
activity of deiodinase enzymes. T4 is converted
into both T3 and inactive rT3. This reaction is
responsible for production of about 75% of the
T3 in circulation. There are a variety of locations
where these enzymes are expressed:
. The liver and kidneys deiodinate the majority of
T4, to produce T3 or rT3.
. Cells in the pituitary gland are able to deiodinate
T4, which is important for the negative feedback
regulation of this axis.
. The brain and placenta express deiodinases
which directly inactivate T3 and T4, to prevent
the brain and fetus from excessively high thyroid
hormone levels.
Whether T3 or rT3 is produced is regulated by the
needs of the body:
. In starvation, a lower basic metabolic rate is
advantageous and is reﬂected in the increased
proportion of T4 being converted to rT3.
. In chronic stress, rT3 is preferentially produced
in response to increased cortisol levels, to main-
tain energy stores.
Final processing of the hormones is through the
complete deiodination to thyronine. The iodide
is reabsorbed by the kidneys for use in generating
future thyroid hormones.
Role of thyroid hormones
in development
Thyroid hormones are crucial for early develop-
ment, regulating a number of processes:
. Stimulating myelination and the production of
neurotransmitters
. Promoting the growth of axons
. Promoting the action of chondrocytes and thus
promoting the growth of long bones
CLINICAL Iodine deﬁciency and goitre
In much of the world iodine deﬁciency is a serious
problem. In children, iodine deﬁciency can be
particularly severe because thyroid hormones are
crucial for development. Where there are low levels
of iodine in the body the thyroid gland compensates
and secretesT3 in preferenceto the less active T4. In
an attempt to scavenge more iodine, the gland
tissue enlarges, producing a goitre. Treatment of
iodine deﬁciency has been achieved in many cases
through the supplementation of food with iodine,
particularly by the spraying of salt with iodine
solutions
Endocrinology 205

. Glucocorticoids act with thyroid hormones to
promote surfactant production to mature the
lungs.
CLINICAL Adult hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism, where there is a failure to produce
thyroid hormones, may occur as a result of:
. absence of TSH
. absence of TRH
. a mutation resulting in resistance to thyroid
hormone
. autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.
Typical symptoms of hypothyroidism reﬂect the
decreased metabolism due to the absence of the
hormones. In particular, there is a general apathy,
reduced pulse rate, weight gain, intolerance to cold
and muscle weakness.
CLINICAL Hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis, results in symp-
toms mainly reﬂecting an increased metabolism.
These include loss of weight, restlessness and
diarrhoea due to increased GI activity.
The major cause of thyrotoxicosis is the auto-
immune condition Graves’ disease, in which an
antibody
that
activates
the TSH
receptor
is
produced. In addition, thyroid tumours may oc-
cur – the tumour consists of complete follicles.
The adrenal hormones
The adrenal gland can be divided into two parts
with different roles:
1 The inner medullar region is responsible for the
production of catecholamines, which contrib-
ute to the sympathetic response.
2 The outer cortical region is responsible for the
production of the steroid hormones.
The adrenal cortex is responsible for the pro-
duction of three main hormones, by modiﬁcation
of cholesterol. Although the pathways by which
these hormones are regulated differ, they share
many common enzymes. The major rate-limiting
step in the production of these hormones is the
production of pregnenolone from cholesterol by
the cytochrome P450 pathway, which is regulated
by the pituitary hormone ACTH. Each hormone is
produced by a different layer of cells within the
cortex of the adrenal gland (Fig. 10.3):
. Aldosterone is associated with regulating Na þ
levels within the body. It is produced by cells in
the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, the
outermost layer of the cortex.
. Cortisol, responsible for the stress response, is
produced within the middle group of cells, the
zona fasciculata.
. The androgens are produced by the innermost
layer of cells, the zone reticularis.
The hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal axis
The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis regu-
lates the stress response. The adrenal cortex is the
end-effector organ through its production of cor-
tisol in response to ACTH. Although the other
steroid hormones also require ACTH, they are
further regulated at other points in their synthetic
pathways.
Structures in the axis
Three main secretory structures are present in the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis:
1 The
hypothalamus
releases
corticotrophin-
releasing hormone (CRH) which ﬂows to the
anterior pituitary gland
2 The corticotroph cells in the anterior pituitary
release ACTH in response to CRH.
3 The adrenal cortex is the main target of ACTH,
and stimulates synthesis and release of cortisol
by the adrenal cortex cells.
Corticotrophin-releasing hormone
CRH is a polypeptide released by the paraventri-
cular nucleus of the hypothalamus. It may also be
produced by the placenta during pregnancy, and is
thought to partially regulate the duration of preg-
nancy. Although CRH acts mainly on the pituitary,
receptors have been found in other areas of the
brain including the amygdala and the hypothala-
mus itself.
206
Endocrinology

ACTH
Synthesis and secretion
ACTH
is
a
peptide
produced
from
pro-
opiomelanocortin (POMC).
DEFINITION Pro-opiomelanocortin
POMC is a large precursor protein produced in the
pituitary gland. It can be cleaved to yield a number
of different proteins for release, in addition to ACTH.
The sequences encoding different proteins are
overlapping, with POMC producing vastly different
proteins in the anterior and intermediate lobes of the
pituitary, reﬂecting different cleavage patterns.
Function and regulation of ACTH
ACTH stimulates the conversion of cholesterol
to pregnenolone, a crucial precursor in steroid
hormone synthesis. The major inﬂuence on ACTH
release is the secretion of CRH from the pituitary
gland, although other stimuli, in particular the
posterior pituitary hormone vasopressin (AVP;
also known asanti-diuretic hormone [ADH]), can
promote its release.
ACTH release follows a circadian rhythm. The
highest levels are found in the morning, around
thetimeofwaking,andthenslowlydecreaseduring
thedayuntilaroundmidnight,atwhichpointlevels
start to increase towards the morning peak. Other
stimuli can alter the levels of ACTH, in particular
signals of starvation (e.g. hypoglycaemia) and cues
for psychological stress (e.g. fear and pain).

Endocrinology 207

CLINICAL ACTH-secreting tumours
Hormone-secreting
tumours
related
to
the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis disrupt the
usual regulatory systems. The presence of an
ACTH-secreting tumour triggers excessive produc-
tion of cortisol from the adrenal cortex, resulting in
Cushing’s syndrome.
CLINICAL ACTH deﬁciency
A deﬁciencyinACTHmayoccurthrougha tumouror
infection, or as a result of radiation treatment – the
hypothalamic–pituitary axis is very susceptible to
radiation damage. This deﬁciency affects all steroid
hormone production in the adrenal cortex, because
ACTH regulates the rate-limiting step of hormone
synthesis common to all hormones. As a result,
affected individuals have the defects associated
with loss of cortisol, and in addition have low an-
drogen levels.
Synthesis of steroid hormones
The adrenal cortex hormones are derived from
cholesterol, which is stored in lipid droplets. On
stimulation cholesterol is converted to pregeno-
lone
by
enzymes
expressed
on
the
smooth
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Pregnenolone is
subsequently converted to the different steroid
hormones by speciﬁc enzyme pathways within
the different cells of the adrenal cortex, to yield
the various steroid hormones.
Synthesis of cortisol
After the generation of pregnenolone, the next
stages of cortisol synthesis are speciﬁc for andro-
gens and cortisol, and are mediated by 7a-hydrox-
ylase. There are then two further hydroxylation
reactions speciﬁc to cortisol production. As the
hormone is lipid soluble, little is stored in the cells
and secretion is the result of new synthesis. Trans-
port of cortisol around the body is achieved by the
transport protein, transcortin.
Regulators of cortisol secretion
ACTH signals through a G-protein-coupled recep-
tor to stimulate cortisol production in the zona
fasiculata. A prolonged elevation in levels of ACTH
results in a generalised increase in the size of the
zona
fasiculata
to
cope
with
the
increased
requirements.
Cortisol itself acts as part of a negative-feedback
loop. It acts directly on the pituitary gland toinhibit
the production of ACTH, and on the hypothalamus
to inhibit the release of CRH. The regulation of
ACTH is linked to a diurnal pattern with a large
variation in the hormone levels. This is reﬂected
in the large changes seen in the levels of cortisol as
well.
Actions on target organs
Cortisol diffuses directly across the cell membrane
and binds to the intracellular glucocorticoid recep-
tor that is found in almost every cell in the body.
Cortisol is associated with prolonged stress, and it
induces changes in gene expression to maintain
vital functions and energy reserves. Cortisol coun-
ters stress by providing the metabolic substrates
required for the body as well as retaining essential
ions (e.g. Na þ) to promote the body’s readiness for
a ﬂight-or-ﬁght response. Non-essential processes
that are likely to increase burden on the body are
suppressed:
. The capacity for pregnancy, which would drain
metabolic resources, is reduced.
. Wound healing is suppressed, because this
requires materials that may be needed to
maintain the ﬁght-or-ﬂight response.
The major effects of cortisol are shown in
Table 10.1.
CLINICAL Cushing's syndrome
and disease
Cushing’s syndrome refers to the abnormalities
resulting from chronic excess of glucocorticoids.
There may be many causes for this; if it is due to
inappropriate
ACTH
secretion,
it
is
called
Cushing's disease. This is generally due to an
ACTH-secreting tumour in the pituitary, although it
may be caused by ectopic ACTH-producing tu-
mours in adrenal adenomas or adrenal carcino-
mas. For both, symptoms are similar to the normal
stress response but much more extreme. In par-
ticular, the syndrome is characterised by a change
in fat deposition around the trunk and back,
hypertension, a ‘moon-face’ (as a result of tissue
oedema), osteoporosis, and poor wound healing
and infertility.

Endocrinology

CLINICAL Addison's disease
Addison’s disease is the opposite of Cushing’s
syndrome – an absence of cortisol production,
typically resulting from autoimmune destruction of
cortisol-secreting cells. It is characterised by gen-
eral weakness and is associated with high levels of
ACTH, due to the aberrant regulation of the axis.
Patients with Addison’s disease are often highly
pigmented because the a-Melanocyte-stimulating
hormone (a-MSH) is secreted with ACTH.
Although cortisol is noted for its role in regulat-
ing the stress response, its secretion occurs even
without prolonged stress and has essential homo-
eostatic function, e.g. vascular tone maintained
by the sympathetic nervous system requires low
levels of cortisol.
Metabolism of cortisol
Cortisolisinactivatedintheliverwhere11b-hydro-
xysteroid dehydrogenase converts it to cortisone.
As it can bind to, and activate, the aldosterone
receptor, cells that are responsive to aldosterone
also express 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
Aldosterone
Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa
of the adrenal cortex and is responsible for the
regulation of Na þ. Aldosterone and its effects in
the regulation of Na þ are discussed in Chapter 9,
although its synthesis and triggers are outlined
below.
Synthesis and secretion of aldosterone
Aldosterone production does not require hy-
droxylation
by
the
17a-hydroxylase
enzyme
needed for the synthesis of cortisol and the
androgens. After the production of pregnenolone,
a
separate
enzymatic
pathway
synthesises
aldosterone.
Aldosterone is transported around the body in
the circulation, although only a small proportion
is bound to plasma proteins, resulting in it
being cleared more rapidly than cortisol from
the system. In addition, it is present in far
lower concentrations (around 100-fold lower)
than cortisol.
Triggers and inhibitors of aldosterone
secretion
The secretion of aldosterone is tightly regulated,
with three major factors having been identiﬁed to
promote aldosterone secretion:
1 Angiotensin II is the major stimulator of aldo-
sterone secretion.
2 ACTH is essential for the production of aldoste-
rone because it promotes the formation of the
precursor molecule.
3 Plasma potassium is linked to the secretion of
aldosterone.
There are two major inhibitory factors to the
release of aldosterone:
1 Atrial
natriuretic
peptide
is
produced
in
response to high ﬂuid levels and antagonises the
production of aldosterone.
2 Somatostatin inhibits aldosterone production.

Endocrinology 209

Adrenal androgens
The zona reticularis produces low levels of andro-
gens, in particular the hormone dehydroepian-
drosterone
(DHEA),
which
is
converted
to
testosterone in the tissues. DHEA is also an inter-
mediate in the production of oestrogen:
. In men, DHEA has relatively little effect due to
the larger amount of testosterone produced by
the testes.
. In women, adrenal DHEA production accounts
for around 50% of the sex steroid requirements.
Androgens in growth and puberty
Just before puberty the level of DHEA secretion
increases rapidly, and is associated with the growth
spurt seen around that time. DHEA secretion also
promotes the development of pubic and axillary
hair.
The adrenal medulla
The medulla of the adrenal gland is richly inner-
vated by preganglionic ﬁbres of the sympathetic
nervous system. This neural crest-derived struc-
ture can supplement the production of noradren-
aline, released by the sympathetic neurons with
adrenaline, which it releases directly into the
bloodstream.
Synthesis and secretion
The major catecholamine released from the adre-
nal gland is adrenaline, which accounts for around
80% of the release, although the remainder is
made up of noradrenaline. Both compounds are
produced in the cytoplasm of the chromafﬁn
cells of the adrenal medulla from the amino acid
tyrosine (Fig. 10.4):
. Tyrosine is converted to dopa (L-3,4-dehydroxy-
phenylalanine) and then to dopamine in the
cytoplasm.
. Dopamine is pumped into granules in the cyto-
plasm and converted to noradrenaline.
. Noradrenaline can be stored in the granules or
returned to the cytoplasm where it is converted
into adrenaline.
. Adrenaline is then pumped into granules and
progressively acidiﬁed and concentrated. The
granules also contain high concentrations of
ATP, which is a co-transmitter.

depolarisation and degranulation in a Ca2 þ-
dependent manner to release the granule’s
contents.
Function of adrenaline
Adrenaline acts to supplement the sympathetic
response. As a result of its different afﬁnity to the
receptors and its differential access to the tissues, it
produces a different response to that seen with
noradrenaline.
CLINICAL Phaeochromocytoma
This adrenaline-secreting tumour can arise from the
chromafﬁn cells. Typical features include hyperten-
sion, headache, tachycardia, tremor and anxiety,
due to uncontrolled secretion of catecholamines.
Treatment involves surgical removal of the tumour.
Growth hormone axis
Growth hormone promotes tissue growth in the
body. It can act directly as an effector of the growth
hormone axis, or through stimulation of the pro-
duction of IGF-1 in the liver (Fig. 10.5).
Three organs form the growth hormone axis:
1 The hypothalamus regulates growth hormone
through positive and negative signals through
growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH)
and somatostatin, respectively.
2 The pituitary gland releases human growth
hormone (hGH) from the somatotrophs in the
anterior pituitary gland.
3 The liver releases IGF-1 in response to hGH.
Growth hormone-releasing
hormone
GHRH is a polypeptide released by the hypothal-
amus in response to the integration of signals from
the body and those from the centre of the brain. In
addition, IGF-1, the secretion end-product of the
axis, suppresses the secretion of GHRH. GHRH acts
to increase GH synthesis through increasing intra-
cellular cAMP.
Growth hormone
Synthesis and secretion
Growth hormone (hGH) is a protein that is re-
leased by the somatotroph cells of the pituitary
gland. It is secreted in larger amounts than any
other pituitary hormone.
Regulation of growth hormone
Control of hGH secretion is primarily by the two
hormones, GHRH and somatostatin, both of
which are released from the hypothalamus. The
release of GHRH and somatostatin is tightly regu-
lated, integrating stimuli from the body (such as
the level of IGF-1) with signals such as stress, which
can modulate the release of hGH.
hGH secretion is closely associated with sleep; in
deep sleep, bursts of hGH release are commonly
seen at 1- to 2-hour intervals. In addition, fat,
carbohydrate and protein metabolites suppress
the secretion of hGH. Other hormones are also
crucial in the regulation of hGH secretion:
. Cortisol inhibits hGH secretion to prevent the
extra strains of growth under prolonged stress.
. Sex hormones are associated with increased
hGH secretion.
Actions on target organs
As the name suggests human growth hormone
promotes the tissue growth. Much of this is
achieved through the actions of IGF-1, although
CLINICAL Growth hormone-secreting
tumours
Growth hormone-secreting tumours result in exces-
sive tissuegrowth, although the nature of thisgrowth
varies with the age of the individual. There are some
common symptoms of a growth hormone-secreting
tumour at any age, e.g. blurred vision as a result of
pressure on the optic nerve, headaches and exces-
sive sweating. The presence of the tumour may
displace cells secreting other pituitary hormones,
leading to mild deﬁciencies. The presence of hGH
increases glucose in the blood and leads to pro-
longed elevated insulin levels that promote the
development of type 2 diabetes.
In a pubescent individual, a growth hormone
secreting tumour can lead to continued growth of
the long bones, such that affected individuals may
be over 7 feet tall.
In the adult, as the growth plates have fused,
lengthening of the long bones cannot occur,
although the soft tissues become enlarged and the
bones of the hands and feet thicken. This condition
is known as acromegaly.
Endocrinology 211

there are also direct actions of hGH, many of
which are basically antagonistic to insulin:
. Increased breakdown of fatty acids, to release
energy stores from adipose tissue for use
. Increased transport of amino acids to muscle
and liver for increased protein synthesis
. Reduction in the transport and metabolism of
glucose
through
reducing
insulin
receptor
expression
. Increased ﬁbroblast differentiation into adipo-
cytes and chondrocytes to promote the growth of
bone.
hGH receptors are single-chain protein mole-
cules on the surface of the cell membrane which
dimerise and bind a hGH molecule. On binding a
molecule of hGH, the receptors recruit the tyrosine
kinase JAK2, which triggers a cascade of phospho-
rylation reactions within the cell.
CLINICAL Loss of growth hormone
hGH levels decrease with age, and produce few
obvious symptoms. In younger individuals loss of
hGH can lead to a decrease in growth rate and
decrease in metabolism, causing increased body
fat and decreased muscle strength. This leads to
a characteristic short, fat appearance. Treatment
of hGH deﬁciency is through giving hGH by
injection.
Insulin-like growth hormone
Synthesis and secretion
IGF-1 is a polypeptide hormone with a high degree
of homology with insulin. It is produced by the liver
and exists in equilibrium in the blood between free
GHRH
The hypothalamus produces two signals that 
influence the growth hormone axis. Growth 
hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is 
negatively related to insulin-like growth factors 
(IGFs). Somatostatin can also be released by the 
hypothalamus to modulate the growth hormone 
cycle. Both GHRH and somatostatin release can 
be modulated as a result of activity in other 
centres of the brain, reflecting circadian rhythms 
and stress, for example.
Growth hormone
Growth hormone (hGH) is released from the 
anterior pituitary in response to GHRH; it is 
inhibited by somatostatin. In addition, IGFs can 
act directly on the anterior pituitary to reduce hGH 
release. hGH is carried around the body with 
around 50% bound to growth hormone binding 
protein. This reduces its excretion by the kidney, 
pronging its half-life. hGH may act directly to 
increase blood sugar and promote tissue growth.
IGF-1
Growth hormone acts on the liver to promote 
the release of IGFs. These act with hGH to 
promote tissue growth and increase blood 
glucose. IGFs also promote cartilage growth; 
they regulate the growth hormone axis by 
negatively inhibiting its activity at all levels.

hormone and those molecules bound to plasma
protein, with the free unbound form being respon-
sible for the activity of the hormone. There are also
IGF-binding proteins in the tissues that maintain
high local concentrations.
Actions on target organs
IGF-1 binds to a receptor that is closely related to
the insulin receptor – insulin and IGF-1 can bind
and weakly activate each other’s receptors. The
IGF-1 receptor signals through tyrosine kinase
activity. IGF-1 acts on almost every tissue in the
body to stimulate proliferation and differentiation.
Major mechanisms by which this occurs include:
. increases in glucose intake into the tissues (in
particular, the muscles)
. stimulation of protein synthesis within the
muscles
. synergy of IGF-1 with hGH to promote long
bone growth within children
. after puberty stimulation by IGF-1 of apposi-
tional growth of the long bones.
IGF-1 has many insulin-like effects, partly
through actions on its own receptor, but also
through partial activation of the insulin receptor.
Prolactin
Prolactin is secreted by the mammotroph cells of
the pituitary. It is important in breast development
and regulating milk production. In men and non-
pregnant women prolactin appears to have little
function. There are three major structures involved
in the regulation and function of prolactin:
1 Hypothalamus
2 Mammotrophs of the anterior pituitary
3 Breasts.
Dopamine
The regulation of prolactin is through the release of
dopamine from the hypothalamus. Unlike other
pituitary hormones, prolactin is under a dominant
negative control by dopamine. Stimuli such as
suckling and pregnancy trigger prolactin release
through inhibiting hypothalamic dopamine pro-
duction. Prolactin acts through a tyrosine kinase-
linked receptor, triggering development of breast
tissue and milk production. Prolactin also acts on
the pituitary gland and the gonads to reduce the
probability of pregnancy.
CLINICAL Prolactinoma
Prolactin-secreting tumours are the most common
form of pituitary tumour. They often present with
vision problems, due to impingement on the optic
nerves, as well as headaches. The high secretion of
prolactin may lead to unwanted milk production in
both sexes, and irregular menstruation in women
and impotence in men.
Treatment is usually with bromocryptine, a dopa-
mine agonist that inhibits the secretion of prolactin.
If drug treatment fails, a surgical or radiological
intervention is usually required.
Thepancreasanddiabetes
The pancreas is a large secretory gland in the
abdomen, having both exocrine and endocrine
functions:
. Most pancreatic cells have an exocrine function.
They produce digestive enzymes that enter the
duodenum at the ampulla of Vater. The exocrine
pancreas is discussed in Chapter 8 in relation to
digestion.
. Some 3–5% of cells have an endocrine function.
These cells aggregate around capillaries, forming
islets of Langerhans. A delicate connective tissue
capsule surrounds each islet, which can contain
up to 3000 cells.
The endocrine pancreas
The major endocrine function of the pancreas is
the control of glucose hom0eostasis. Glucose in the
body is derived from three sources:
1 Intestinal absorption as the result of carbohy-
drate digestion
2 Glycogenolysis – the release of glucose by the
breakdown of glycogen
3 Gluconeogenesis – the formation of glucose
from precursors such as lactate.
The pancreas detects the levels of glucose in the
blood and produces insulin, a glucose-lowering
Endocrinology 213

hormone, or glucagon, a glucose-raising hor-
mone, as necessary. If levels of glucose are not
controlled, as in diabetes mellitus, this can result
in hypo- or hyperglycaemia. The islets compose
only 3–5% of the mass of the pancreas, but receive
10–15% of the blood supply. Venous drainage is
via the hepatic portal vein, which means that the
liver is the major target for the endocrine products
of the pancreas and they will reach the liver at
much higher concentrations than for the rest of
the body.
CLINICAL Hypoglycaemia
In hypoglycaemia there is an abnormally low level of
glucose in the blood. This is due to either:
. excessive use of glucose/external losses or
. deﬁcient endogenous production when there is
lack of exogenous delivery, i.e. not making
enough glucose when the person hasn’t eaten.
Clinically, this results in sweating, hunger, tremor,
drowsiness, seizures and eventually coma.
CLINICAL Diabetic ketoacidosis
This occurs in patients with previously undiagnosed
type 1 diabetes, or patients with diabetes who do
not comply with their treatment or have an intercur-
rent illness. Due to insulin deﬁciency there is
hyperglycaemia (>11.1 mmol/L) which causes
osmotic diuresis, and increased catabolism of
fatty acids, resulting in uncontrolled production of
ketones.The combination ofthese twothingsresults
in metabolic acidosis. Patients present with symp-
toms of acidosis – hyperventilation, nausea, vomit-
ing, abdominal pain and eventually coma. They are
severely dehydrated. This is a medical emergency
and treatment is with urgent ﬂuid and electrolyte
replacement as well as insulin.
The islets of Langerhans are made up of four main
cell types, each associated with production of
a different hormone, which is secreted directly
into the bloodstream:
1 b cells – make up 60% of the islet mass and
produce insulin
2 a cells – make up 20% of the islet mass and
produce glucagon
3 d cells – make up <10% of the islet mass and
produce somatostatin
4 PP cells – make up <2% of the islet mass and
produce pancreatic polypeptide.
Insulin
Synthesis and secretion
Insulin is a polypeptide, produced as the result of
the cleavage of proinsulin by prohormone conver-
tase in the b cells and packaged into secretory
granules that are stored in the cytoplasm. About 5%
of these granules are stored as a readily releasable
pool. Insulin secretion occurs in two phases: the
ﬁrst phase is due to stimulation of the readily
releasable
pool
of
granules;
in
the
second
phase, more granules are recruited and then
released. Glucose can also stimulate proinsulin
gene transcription.
Triggers and inhibitors of release
Glucose and amino acids stimulate release of in-
sulin. b Cells havea K þ
ATP-dependent channel that
needs a high ratio of ATP:ADP to open:
. High glucose levels in the blood result in
increased glucose uptake into b cells.
. Increased cellular levels of glucose result in
increased metabolism, producing ATP.
. Increased levels of ATP causes the K þ
ATP-depen-
dent channels to close.
. The decrease in K þ entering the cells causes
depolarisation,
triggering
the
opening
of
voltage-gated calcium channels.
. Entry of calcium increases exocytosis of the
secretory granules containing insulin.
Amino acids act similarly by increasing the
ratio ATP:ADP. Other factors sensitise b cells to
the levels of glucose in the blood to stimulate
the release of insulin. These include acetylcholine,
cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like peptide
(GLP).
Actions on target organs
Insulin has a wide range of actions, all of which
work to promote anabolism and lower plasma
glucose levels (Table 10.2).
Diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus refers to the illness resulting
from inappropriate blood glucose control. This
214
Endocrinology

differs from diabetes insipidus, which is due to
a defect in ADH signalling. Diabetes is chronic
hyperglycaemia as the result of either deﬁcient
insulin production (type 1) or resistance to the
actions of insulin at the target organs, potentially
with some impaired production (type 2). Deﬁcient
levels of insulin mean that plasma glucose levels
are high and the body is unable to adequately store
glucose or decrease the production of glucose. It
can be divided into type 1 and type 2 diabetes
which have common symptoms:
. Polyuria (increased urination): blood glucose
levels exceed the renal threshold (9–10 mmol/L),
resulting in loss of glucose in the urine and there-
fore osmotic diuresis.
. Polydipsia (increased thirst) due to the loss of
ﬂuid and electrolytes in the urine.
. Weight loss due both to ﬂuid depletion and to
increased breakdown of fat and muscle.
Patients with diabetes are likely to experience
chronic hyperglycaemia. This increases the risk of
staphylococcal infections, retinopathy, polyneuro-
pathy, erectile dysfunction and arterial disease.
CLINICAL Type 1 diabetes
This normally presents in younger patients around
the time of puberty (it is therefore also known as
juvenile-onset diabetes). It occurs as a result of an
autoimmune reaction against the pancreatic b cells,
and has a genetic predisposition. Patients present
with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss, and may
present acutely with ketoacidosis, because they
are using fatty acids as an alternative energy
source.
CLINICAL Type 2 diabetes
This normallypresentsin patientsover the age of 40,
but is being diagnosed in increasingly younger
people and is associated with obesity and a family
history. Insulin can bind normally to target cells, but
abnormal cell signalling (possibly partly as a result
of obesity) means that the cells are insulin resistant.
Eventually, the pancreas is unable to secrete en-
ough insulinto overcomethis resistance, resultingin
loss of b cells and insulin deﬁciency. Insulin resis-
tance in these patients means that treatment with
insulin will eventually have no effect; the ﬁrst-line
treatment is with oral hypoglycaemics, such as
metformin, sulphonylureas and glitazones).
CLINICAL Hyperosmolar non-ketotic
state (HONK)
Severe
hyperglycaemia
that
develops
without
ketosis can typically occur in type 2 diabetes – this
is probably because, in these cases, insulin levels
are sufﬁcient to inhibit hepatic ketogenesis. Patients
present with dehydration, confusion or coma.
Glucagon
Glucagon is a polypeptide produced by a cells in
the islets, and has antagonistic effects to insulin.
Synthesis and secretion
Proglucagon in the pancreas is cleaved to produce
glucagon. In the intestine it is cleaved to produce
GLP-1.

Triggers and inhibitors of release
In contrast to insulin, which is stimulated by high
blood glucose, glucagon production is stimulated
by low levels of glucose.
Actions at target tissues
Glucagon acts mainly in the liver and adipose
tissue, with effects directly opposite to those of
insulin.
In
the
liver
it
acts
via
cAMP
to
stimulate gluconeogenesis and glycogen break-
down, and decreases glycolysis, so hepatic glucose
output is increased. In adipose tissue it increases
lipolysis.
Somatostatin
This inhibitory hormone is produced by the d cells
in the islets. In the pancreas it acts to suppress
the release of insulin, glucagon and exocrine
secretions. Somatostatin is also secreted by the
stomach, intestine and hypothalamus, although
the precise roles are not well understood.
Triggers of secretion
Secretion is stimulated by meals with high protein,
fat and carbohydrate content, and inhibited by
insulin.
Action at target organs
Somatostatin has different roles when secreted in
different organs:
. In the pancreas: inhibits both endocrine and
exocrine function
. In the stomach: inhibits gastrin release and
secretion of acid by the parietal cells
. In the pituitary: inhibits the response of soma-
totroph cells to GHRH.
Pancreatic polypeptide
Pancreatic
polypeptide
is
secreted
from
the
PP cells. This hormone is thought to antagonise
the effects of insulin.
Triggers of secretion
Food, exercise and parasympathetic stimulation
all trigger release pancreatic polypeptide.
Actions at target organs
PP stimulates production of glucocorticoids (thus
antagonising the effects of insulin) and GI motility.
It may have similar effects on appetite to neuro-
peptide Y (NPY) and peptide YY (PYY). It inhibits
pancreatic exocrine secretion and gallbladder
contraction.
Calcium, phosphate
and bone
Calcium is an essential mineral in the body. It
has roles including maintenance of membrane
stability and regulation of Na þ permeability of
CLINICAL Treatment of diabetes
. Diet: patients should eat complex carbohydrates
(e.g. potatoes, pasta) which are absorbed rela-
tively slowly, so that there aren’t rapid ﬂuctua-
tions in blood sugar. For the same reason meals
should be spread equally throughout the day. In
other respects the diet should be similar to a
normal healthy diet. Dietary regulation is impor-
tant in both forms of diabetes, and in type 2 may
be sufﬁcient in itself to provide adequate glucose
control.
. Sulphonylureas act to close the K þ
ATP-sensitive
channels in the b cells, stimulating insulin release,
and can be used in patients who still have
functioning b cells (i.e. some patients with type 2
diabetes).
Sulphonylureas
are
well
tolerated
although they can cause hypoglycaemia.
. Metformin acts to decrease gluconeogenesis
and also to increase insulin sensitivity; it is
useful in patients with type 2 diabetes. It also
lowers levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)
and
very-low-density
lipoproteins
(VLDLs).
There are few side effects, although there is
a risk of gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance and
lactic acidosis.
. Insulin injections can be long acting or short
acting depending on the preparation. In type 1
diabetes insulin replaces that produced by the b
cells. In type 2 diabetes it supplements the natural
release from the remaining functional b cells.
. Thiazolidinediones
(glitazones)
act
on
the
peroxisome
proliferator-acitvated
receptor-g
(PPARg) and trigger increased glucose uptake in
muscle and decreased hepatic glucose output.
They also trigger increased expression of insulin-
signalling genes.

cells, intra- and intercellular signalling, and skel-
etal mineralisation with phosphate to maintain
bone structure.
The adult human body contains approximately
1100 g calcium, 99% of which is deposited in
bones and teeth, complexed with phosphate to
form hydroxyapatite. The remaining 1% is found
mainly in the blood, with a minute amount
located intracellularly (in both the ER and the
cytoplasm). In normal individuals the range of
serum total calcium is 2.12–2.62 mmol/L. The
concentration of intracellular calcium is much
less than this, approximately 0.1 mmol/L. Peak
bone mass occurs at about 30 years in women
and is then lost at approximately 3% per decade.
This increases to 9% per decade postmenopaus-
ally. In men, peak bone mass occurs at about
40 years and is lost at approximately 3% per
decade throughout the rest of life.
In the blood calcium is found in three forms:
1 Ionised (50%) – calcium unbound in the blood
2 Protein bound (40%) – of this 80–90% is bound
to albumin and the rest to globulins; binding to
albumin is sensitive to pH changes
3 Complexed to citrate and phosphate-forming
soluble complexes (10%).
The regulation of bone is achieved by two cells:
1 Osteoblasts are responsible for laying down
bone, and as such are associated with locking
calcium into the bone matrix.
2 Osteoclasts are involved in the breakdown of
bone for remodelling and may be responsible for
the release of calcium from the bone matrix.
CLINICAL Hypercalcaemia
The symptoms of hypercalcaemia can be divided
into four organ systems:
1 Nervous
system:
fatigue,
lethargy,
coma,
depression,
psychosis,
decreased
concen-
tration
2 Musculoskeletal: weakness, bone/joint pain,
fractures
3 Gastrointestinal: polydipsia, anorexia, nausea,
emesis, weight loss, constipation, abdominal pain
4 Kidneys: polyuria, nocturia; kidney stones result-
ing in haematuria and dysuria (this occurs after
long-term hypercalcaemia).
CLINICAL Hypocalcaemia
Hypocalcaemia is clinically a more seriousproblem
than hypercalcaemia. It alters neuromuscular excit-
ability resulting in paraesthesia, seizures and
smooth muscle spasm (such as bronchospasm and
laryngospasm), and, if severe, may cause confu-
sion and psychosis.
As phosphate combines with calcium to form
hydroxyapatite, hyperphosphataemia results in
decreased levels of ionised calcium. Phosphate is
also an essential component of DNA, RNA, ATP,
phospholipids and many metabolic intermediates;
hypophosphataemia can limit ATP production and
cause muscle weakness.
Regulation of calcium and phosphate relies
on three hormones, the coordinated action of
which regulates both the total body levels and the

(Fig. 10.6):
. Parathyroid hormone increases Ca2 þ in the

. Calcitonin decreases Ca2 þ in the blood.
Parathyroid hormone
This
is
the
principal
hormone
involved
in
calcium homoeostasis, acting to normalise low
plasma calcium.
Synthesis and secretion
PTH is a polypeptide secreted by the cells of
the parathyroid glands, which sit posterior to the
thyroid. The glands contains chief cells, which
secrete PTH. PTH is preformed in the cells and
stored until release is triggered through changes in
levels of plasma calcium.
Triggers and inhibitors of release
Release of PTH is mainly controlled by the levels
of ionised calcium, which are detected by the
calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) in the parathy-
roid glands:
. Low
levels
of
ionised
calcium
inhibit
the
CaSR, resulting in secretion of preformed PTH,

intracellular PTH degradation. There is therefore
biphasic PTH secretion.
. High levels of phosphate increase PTH secretion.
This also occurs indirectly as high levels of phos-
phate will buffer calcium, decreasing calcium
levels.
. Magnesium regulates PTH secretion in a similar
manner (though to a lesser extent) to calcium.
Actions on target cells
PTH has two main target organs:
1 Bone
2 Kidneys.
Actions of PTH on bone
PTH acts to increase bone resorption for release
Ca2 þ into the blood. Osteoblasts express PTH
receptors. Binding of PTH stimulates production
of the RANKL receptor (also known as the
osteoclast differentiating factor or osteoprotegerin
ligand). RANKL binds to the RANK receptor found
on the precursors of osteoclasts, stimulating their
differentiation into functional osteoclasts.
At the same time PTH inhibits the production
of osteoprotegerin by osteoblasts. This soluble
protein competes with RANKL to bind to RANK,
although it has no effect on binding. The increase
in osteoclasts results in increased bone resorption,
leading to increased levels of free calcium and
phosphate.
Actions of PTH in the kidneys
PTH increases transcellular calcium reabsorption
in the distal tubule of the nephrons, through three
main actions it:

decreasing the expression of a Na þ/phosphate
co-transporter
3 Increases 1a-hydroxylase activity, thus upre-
gulating levels of active vitamin D. As vitamin
D acts to alter calcium absorption and secre-
tion in the gut, leading to increased absorp-
tion,
PTH
therefore
has
indirect
effects
in the gut.
CLINICAL Hyperparathyroidism
Hyperparathyroidism leads to hypercalcaemia:
. Primary hyperparathyroidism – inappropriate
levels of PTH, commonly due to hyperplasia,
adenoma or carcinoma of the parathyroid glands,
result in excess secretion of PTH.
. Secondary hyperparathyroidism – often oc-
curs in chronic renal failure. Phosphate cannot
be excreted renally, so levels of phosphate rise
and buffer calcium, resulting in decreased levels
of calcium and therefore increased PTH. At the
same time renal failure results in loss of 1a-hy-
droxylation of inactive vitamin D, so calcium levels
fall even lower and PTH levels are even more
raised. Over time this results in resistance to
the effects of PTH and loss of sensitivity of PTH
secretion to hypercalcaemia.
. Hypercalcaemia of malignancy – PTH-related
peptide is secreted by tumours such as breast
or lung carcinomas, and mimics the effects of
PTH.
CLINICAL Hypoparathyroidism
Hypoparathyroidism – a deﬁciency in PTH – leads
to hypocalcaemia and may result from a variety of
different causes:
. Acquired (post-thyroidectomy)
. Hereditary (congenitally absent parathyroids,
e.g. DiGeorge syndrome)
. Autoimmune destruction
. Hypomagnesaemia (may cause resistance to,
and eventually decreased secretion of, PTH).
Pseudohypoparathyroidism
can
also
occur,
where there are normal levels of PTH but an inability
to respond due to a genetic defect in the PTH
receptor.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D and its related molecules are responsi-
ble for regulating total body calcium and promot-
ing the mineralisation of bone, to store calcium
and phosphate in hydroxyapatite. The active form
of vitamin D is calcitriol.
Synthesis and secretion
Calcitriol is synthesised in a series of stages:
. Ergocalciferol which is obtained either from
plants, fatty ﬁsh and fortiﬁed milk, or as a result
of the action of UV light on cholesterol-derived
precursors in the skin
. This inactive precursor is transported to the liver
where it is 25-hydroxylated by 25-hydroxylase to
25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)-vitamin D3.
This is the major circulating form of vitamin D.
. In the kidney this is hydroxylated to calcitriol
(active vitamin D) – 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 – by
1a-hydroxylase which is regulated to control
calcitriol levels.
Triggers and inhibitors of release
An increase in ionised calcium inhibits the second
hydroxylation step, blocking calcitriol production.
Conversely low levels of ionised calcium stimu-
late PTH production, which in turn increases the
activity of 1a-hydroxylase. Calcitriol feeds back to
depress 1a-hydroxylase activity.
Actions on target cells
Calcitriol acts via altering gene expression to:
. stimulate calcium reabsorption from the intes-
tine and kidney distal tubules
. stimulate bone resorption (via osteoblastic
production of RANKL)
. repress transcription and secretion of PTH.
Calcitonin
Calcitonin is a peptide hormone that acts to
normalise high levels of ionised calcium in the
blood.
Secretion
Calcitonin is produced by the parafollicular cells
(C-cells) of the thyroid gland.
Endocrinology 219

Triggers and inhibitors of secretion
Increases in plasma calcium act on the CaSR of
the parafollicular cells to stimulate the release of
calcitonin.
Actions on target organs
Calcitonin acts on osteoclasts to inhibit motility,
differentiation and secretory activity, thus decreas-
ing bone resorption. The role of calcitonin has
been shown not to be essential; total removal of
the thyroid does not alter calcium homoeostasis.
Similarly, calcitonin-secreting tumours have no
major effect on calcium levels.
Other hormones
. Androgens and oestrogens decrease bone re-
sorption and increase osteoprotegerin synthesis.
. Growth hormone stimulates proliferation and
differentiation of osteoblasts and bone protein
synthesis.
. IGF-1
increases
proliferation
of
osteoblast
precursors.
. Thyroid hormone increases bone resorption.
. Glucocorticoids increase bone resorption and
decrease bone synthesis, possibly by inhibition
of osteoprotegerin.
CLINICAL Paget's disease
Paget’s disease is a localised disease of bone that
results in an imbalance between bone formation
and resorption, occurring mainly in the pelvis,
vertebrae, skull, mandible and tibia.
Treatment aims to relieve bone pain and gives
drugs such as bisphosphonates, which prevent
bone resorption. Finally, diet is monitored to
ensure that the patient is receiving adequate
calcium.
CLINICAL Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a condition in which there is de-
creased bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue
resulting in increased bone fragility and fracture
risk.
Osteoporosis most commonly occurs in ageing
women, as a result of decreased oestrogen levels.
Other endocrine disorders may also result in
osteoporosis (e.g. Cushing’s disease) and giving
corticoids can induce osteoporosis.
Treatment uses the administration of drugs to
reduce bone resorption (e.g. bisphosphonates)
and those to stimulate bone formation, most
commonly oestrogen.

CLINICAL Vitamin D deﬁciency
Vitamin D deﬁciency may be due to poor diet, lack
of sunlight, malabsorption or liver/renal disease,
and results in hypocalcaemia. Patients have vague
symptoms of bone pain and muscle aches, as well
increased susceptibility to fractures, high bone
turnover and bone loss or deformity. The deﬁciency
has
different
names
(and
different
features)
depending on the age of onset:
. If this occurs before the epiphyseal plates fuse
(i.e. in childhood) it is called rickets
. In adults it is osteomalacia.
Osteomalacia may also result from calcium or
phosphate deﬁciency.
CLINICAL Excess vitamin D
Excessive intake or excess production (rarely by
lymphomas,or ingranulomatousdisease)ofvitamin
D results in hypercalcaemia, calciﬁcation of soft

Integrative physiology
The organ systems function in concert to maintain
homoeostasis. Disturbance of a single variable
typically results in a complex and coordinated
response involving many systems to regulate the
change. Different systems use varied mechanisms
to regulate this change, with different time courses
of response.
Blood serves as the unifying factor in many
regulatory systems; it provides a reservoir of nu-
trients and a site to remove waste, and it can be
altered by all the organ systems in the body.
The individual organ systems and their physiol-
ogy have been discussed previously. This chapter
discusses the control of responses requiring the
coordinated and integrated function of several
organ systems.
Blood pressure
Blood pressure must be regulated: if it is too high,
there is serious risk of damage to the cardiovascu-
lar system due to the additional strain imposed; if it
is too low, adequate perfusion of the organs be-
comes impossible. The mechanisms regulating
blood pressure respond to both changes in the
requirements of the tissues and the total work
imposed on the cardiovascular system, while en-
suring that appropriate perfusion is maintained.
Two circulatory systems exist in the body, arranged
in series:
1 The systemic circulation
2 The pulmonary circulation.
This arrangement ensures that blood oxygenat-
ed in the pulmonary capillary beds is carried to the
systemic circulation. Changes in the perfusion of
one circulatory system directly impact on the per-
formance of the other.
In each circulatory system, almost all capillary
beds are arranged in parallel. A single red blood cell
passes through one capillary bed in a circulatory
system before entering the other circulation (the
exception being the portal systems and shunt ves-
sels). Each capillary bed is afforded some indepen-
dent control of its perfusion, over which systemic
regulation is imposed. The blood ﬂow through
each capillary bed is regulated by two major
factors:
1 Local control mechanisms responding to the
needs of the tissue
2 Systemic regulation of circulation to ensure
that there is adequate pressure in the whole
circulationsothatalltissuebedscanbeperfused.

minor mechanism of regulating blood pressure,
because neurological mechanisms ensure that the
dominant effect of increased venous return is
through an increase in cardiac output.
Short-term regulation of systemic
blood pressure
The systemic blood pressure is regulated by a
variety of mechanisms, which control itin the short
and long term. There are three steps in the short-
term regulation of blood pressure (Fig. 11.1):
1 Detection of changes in blood pressure, volume
and composition
2 Central control and processing
3 Effector mechanisms.
Detection of changes in blood
pressure and composition
Blood pressure is determined through a series of
different factors:
. Total peripheral resistance is determined by the
contraction of the arterioles.
. Cardiac output is governed by the force gener-
ated by the heart
Three types of receptor have been identiﬁed pro-
viding information on the volume and pressure of
the blood:
1 High-pressure receptors
2 Low-pressure receptors

lation of blood pressure through sensing the

Figure 11.1 Blood pressure is regulated as a result of sensing both local and systemic changes. The local changes
in the tissue beds can directly alter their perfusion, and contribute to a change in blood pressure. Systemic changes,
in terms of pressure and composition of the blood, are detected at various sites and integrated in the central nervous
system(CNS). TheCNS innervates manyorgansthatmodulatetheir functiontoalterblood pressure directlyor,in the
case of the lungs, can modulate ventilation to alter O2 and CO2; this, in turn, can alter the composition of blood. The
CNS can also stimulate the hypothalamus and adrenal gland, modulating the behaviour of the various effector
systems.

composition of blood gases; it is used as a mea-
surement of the metabolic demands of the
tissues.
High-pressure arterial baroceptors
Arterial baroceptors are the major detectors of
systemic changes in blood pressure. These clus-
ters of nerve ﬁbres ﬁre in response to stretch of
the blood vessels to which they are attached. They
are extremely sensitive and discharge with each
heart beat, detecting both changes in the blood
pressure and the rate at which this change occurs.
High-pressure baroceptors are found in two
locations:
1 The carotid sinus, at the bifurcation of the com-
mon carotids tothe internal andexternal vessels.
Innervation is through a branch of the glosso-
pharyngeal nerve and the ﬁbres project to the
nucleus tractus solitarius in the brain stem.
2 Those at the arch of the aorta are innervated by
the vagus nerve. The nerve ﬁbres project to the
nucleus tractus solitarius.
Low-pressure baroceptors
These receptors can, in effect, detect the effective
circulating volume of the blood. This is achieved
through a series of low-pressure baroceptors lo-
cated in the atria and the pulmonary circulation.
The best understood low-pressure receptors are
those found in the right atrium. These are made up
of two types of ﬁbre derived from the vagus nerve
(cranial nerve X) which are found within the walls
of the right atrium. The ‘A’ and ‘B’ ﬁbres respond to
different stimuli:
. ‘A’ ﬁbres respond to contraction of the atrium,
providing a measure of heart rate
. ‘B’ ﬁbres respond to distension of the atrium,
providing a measure of the venous return to the
heart.
Chemoreceptors in the regulation of
blood pressure
Peripheral and central chemoreceptors detect
changes in the composition of blood gases and act
to stimulate an increase in blood pressure and
heart rate, to maintain adequate perfusion of the
tissues with oxygenated blood, while removing
CO2 to the lungs so that it can be removed from
the body.
Peripheral chemoreceptors sense changes in
blood pH, CO2 and O2, and project this information
to the medulla. Peripheral chemoreceptors are
especially sensitive to low O2 and are found in two
locations:
1 The carotid bodies are found at the bifurcation
of the internal and external carotids, innervated
by cranial nerve IX.
2 Aortic bodies are found in the aortic arch at the
angle between the right subclavian and carotid
arteries, and under the concavity of the aortic
arch, innervated by cranial nerve X.
The central chemoreceptors are located in the
medulla of the brain and primarily detect changes
in pH in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), which are
associated with changes in PCO2.
Central areas regulating blood
pressure
The inputs from the high- and low-pressure bar-
oceptors project to the nucleus tractus solitarius
(NTS) in the brain stem. The cardiovascular cen-
tres are located in the ventrolateral part of the
medulla, where they receive interneurons from the
NTS, as well as signals from the hypothalamus to
provide information on the internal state of the
body, and from higher centres as well. Many re-
gions can be determined in the cardiovascular
centres, in particular:
. The vasomotor area is concerned with the reg-
ulation of vasoconstriction. The neurons ﬁre
tonically to maintain normal vessel tone; as a
result, inhibition of the vasomotor centre can
trigger vasodilatation.
. The cardioinhibitory area of the medulla de-
creases the heart rate when stimulated.
. The cardioacceleratory area increases heart rate.
Effector mechanisms
The neurons projecting from the cardiovascular
centres send efferent signals through the sympa-
thetic andparasympathetic nervous systems; these
systems focus on short-term regulation through
upregulation of the heart rate and contraction.
Sympathetic output occurs through the sympa-
thetic chain and the prevertebral ganglia and pro-
duces a number of responses:
. Vasoconstriction of the arterioles, via noradren-
aline release
Integrative physiology 223

. Increase in cardiac contraction and rate, via
noradrenaline release
. Release of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla.
Parasympathetic output produces the opposite
effect to that of the sympathetic nervous system. It
acts through ﬁbres in the vagus nerve to decrease
cardiac rate and contraction.
Vascular reﬂexes regulating blood
pressure
Many processes may secondarily alter the blood
pressure. In particular, changes in posture can
markedly alter the distribution –and therefore the
pressure – of blood. About two-thirds of the blood
volume is found in the veins. On standing, venous
pooling in the lower limbs will occur unless there is
compensation. Venous return will fall, conse-
quently leading to a decrease in arterial blood
pressure. The pooling of blood in the limbs would
lead to less being returned to the heart, preventing
atrial ﬁlling. A number of factors mediate this
orthostatic response:
. The blood vessels are not uniformly distensible.
Thesmallveinsarelessdistensiblethanthelarger
veins. The stiffness of the blood vessels is further
regulated by the contraction of smooth muscle in
the venous walls to improve venous return.
. Venous blood pools in the legs under the inﬂu-
ence of gravity. The contraction of the skeletal
muscles in the limbs, coupled to the valves pres-
ent in the veins, promotes return to counteract
this. Further movements result in further action
of the muscle pumps helping venous return.
. Autonomic reﬂexes: cardiac output tends to fall
by around 20% when one stands, decreasing
right atrial pressure and also stroke volume. This
is, in turn, detected by the high-pressure baro-
ceptors as a decrease in arterial pressure. The
resulting response triggers a generalised sympa-
thetic output that raises the vascular tone
throughout the body (including venous tone)
and increases heart rate and contraction. The
net effect is a return of the mean arterial pressure.
Long-term regulation of blood
pressure
There are two major factors that regulate blood
pressure in the long term:
1 Vascular tone
2 Fluid balance.
Regulation of vascular tone
A variety of signals act in paracrine and endocrine
manners to regulate the tone of smooth muscle:
. Adrenaline released from the adrenal medulla,
in the sympathetic response, acts predominantly
on the b2-receptors found on skeletal smooth
muscle
to
trigger
vasodilatation.
However,
through its actions on a-adrenoceptors on the
splanchnic blood vessels, it has the opposite
effect, triggering vasoconstriction
. Angiotensin II is produced as part of the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone
pathway
and
is
a
powerful vasoconstrictor. Angiotensin II also
modulates ﬂuid balance.
. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is released from
the atrial cells in response to stretch. It acts as a
vasodilator, in addition toitsrole inreducing ﬂuid
volume by promoting Na þ and water excretion.
. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH; also known as
Arginine Vasopressin [AVP]) has vasoconstrictive
effects, at very high concentrations.
Regulation of ﬂuid volume
Many signals provide information on the circulat-
ing volume of blood in the body: the high- and low-
pressure baroceptors. As ﬂuid volume is regulated
by the actions of the kidneys, they are the major site
of long-term regulation of blood pressure.
The primary effector mechanism by which the
kidneys regulate ﬂuid volume is through modulat-
ing the excretion of Na þ. Four systems are pre-
dominantly involved in this regulation, and have
been discussed in Chapter 9:
1 The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
2 Autonomic stimulation of the kidneys
3 Antidiuretic hormone
4 Atrial natriuretic peptide.
Pharmacological control of
hypertension
There are a number of sites that can be targeted to
manage blood pressure (although most current
therapies target three and four):
1 The baroceptors sensing changes in blood
pressure
2 The central areas coordinating the cardiovas-
cular response
3 The effector mechanism of the heart and
vasculature
4 Regulation of blood ﬂuid volume.

CLINICAL Hypertension
Hypertension is a chronically high blood pressure –
typically described as a pressure higher than
140/90 mmHg. It is associated with a number of
pathological changes. In particular, the additional
stress can damage the endothelium and promote
arteriosclerosis. Furthermore, hypertension predis-
poses to myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke
and coronary artery disease.
In most cases, people have ‘primary (essential)
hypertension’ when there is no identiﬁable speciﬁc
cause. In rare cases there is ‘secondary hyper-
tension’, when an underlying cause for the hyper-
tension can be identiﬁed and correction of the
underlying pathology results in correction of the
blood pressure. A major cause of secondary hyper-
tension is renal artery stenosis, where there is
reduced perfusion of the kidneys, due to a blockage
of the renal artery. This triggers the kidney to in-
crease the blood pressure because it is unable to
distinguish the localised loss of perfusion from a
systemic loss of pressure.
Modulation of baroceptor function
To date there are no therapies that modulate the
behaviour of the baroceptors to regulate blood
pressure.
Modulation of central coordinating
areas
The cells in the central cardiovascular areas are
rare targets of antihypertensive medication: cells
in these regions express presynaptic a2-adreno-
ceptors, which inhibit vasomotor function. Admin-
istration of the a2 agonist, clonidine, can be used to
reduce blood pressure.
The cells in the vasomotor areas express imida-
zoline receptors which, when activated, inhibit
vasomotor areas. The I1-receptor agonist moxoni-
dine can be used as a treatment for hypertension.
Moxonidine has fewer side effects than a2-
adrenoceptor agonists.
Regulation of mechanisms of the
heart and vasculature
Pharmacological modulation of blood pressure
can be divided into three areas of treatment:
1 Inhibition of the sympathetic response
2 Mimicking and promoting the actions of the
parasympathetic response
3 Directantagonism oftheintracellular calciumor
prevention of Ca2 þ entry into cells.
Inhibition of the actions of the sympathetic
nervous system
The catecholamines released by the sympathetic
nerves and the adrenal gland cause constriction
of the blood vessels and increase heart rate
and contraction. In addition, activation of b1-
adrenoceptors in the kidneys promotes renin
release
to
activate
the
renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone system. Two main classes of adreno-
ceptor antagonist are used to treat hypertension:
b Blockers
b Blockers (e.g. propanolol) antagonise the b-
adrenoceptors found in the heart. At rest, they have
little effect, although the reduce the ability of the
sympathetic system to increase heart rate. b Block-
ers have a gradual effect on the cardiovascular
system, leading to a reduction in cardiac output
and blood pressure, and on the kidney to reduce
the production of renin. As b-adrenoceptors are
not involved in regulating the orthostatic reﬂex,
postural hypotension is not seen in patients on
b blockers.
b Blockers are not without side effects. Fatigue is
common and in patients with heart failure the
sympathetic drive may be essential to maintain
cardiac output. There is also some bronchocon-
striction, which can be problematic in people with
severe asthma because the b blocker may antago-
nisetheactionofbronchodilators(e.g.salbutamol).
a1-Adrenoceptor antagonists
a1-Adrenoceptor antagonists (e.g. prazosin) inhib-
it the noradrenaline-mediated contraction of the
arterioles, which occurs through a1-adrenoceptors
on vascular smooth muscle. These drugs also
decrease LDL levels and increase high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) levels, reducing the risk of
atherosclerosis.
There are some side effects of a1-antagonists:
the inhibition of vasoconstriction promotes the
occurrence of postural hypotension. Impotence
is another side effect.
Mimicking the parasympathetic response
The parasympathetic response that triggers vaso-
dilatation
is complex. Parasympathetic ﬁbres
Integrative physiology 225

innervate the endothelial cells of some blood ves-
sels. They release acetylcholine (ACh) which binds
muscarinic (M3)-receptors on the muscle cells to
trigger an increase in Ca2 þ. This stimulates the
production of a variety of endothelial factors. Of
particular importance is the gaseous mediator ni-
tric oxide (NO) which diffuses to nearby vascular
muscle cells, where it triggers a cGMP-mediated
pathway activating the PKG (cGMP-dependent
protein kinase), which, in turn decreases Ca2 þ in
the muscle cells, reducing contraction.
NO donors are a common treatment of hyper-
tension; both glycerol trinitrate and sodium nitro-
prusside release NO into the body to stimulate
vasodilatation. It is also thought that the coronary
arteries are particularly dilated to increase the
perfusion of the cardiac tissue.
Direct antagonism of intracellular calcium
Contraction of muscle is linked to increased intra-
cellular calcium levels and many therapies target
this effect. They act to inhibit the L-type Ca2 þ
channel on the cell surface, reducing calcium entry
into the cell and limiting induced calcium release
from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Targeting differ-
ent tissues lowers blood pressure by different
mechanisms:
. Antagonism of intracellular Ca2 þ in the heart
reduces contraction and work done.
. Antagonism of intracellular Ca2 þ in the arter-
ioles reduces vascular tone and directly reduces
blood pressure.
Different classes of Ca2 þ antagonists favour dif-
ferent tissues:
. Dihydropyridines (e.g. nifedipine) act predom-
inantly on the vascular smooth muscle.
. Phenylalkylamines (e.g. verapamil) act predom-
inantly on the heart tissue.
. Benzothiazepines (e.g. diltiazem) has an effect
on both tissues.
Calcium antagonists may have antiarrhythmic
effects although they are also linked to atrioven-
tricular block, because they can act on conduct-
ing tissues in the heart. Despite inhibition of con-
traction in the heart, the total cardiac output is
relatively unchanged due to the decreased resis-
tance against which the heart must work.
Reducing ﬂuid volume
The volume of ﬂuid in the cardiovascular system
can vary; greater volumes of ﬂuid place additional
demands on the heart. Fluid volume is regulated by
the kidneys, which sense changes in the compo-
sition of the blood and respond to direct measures
of ﬂuid volume through the release of circulating
hormones such as ADH and ANP. It the effective
circulating volume, and not the actual blood vol-
ume, that is regulated.
In individuals with hypertension, the renin–an-
giotensin–aldosterone system is often targeted be-
cause it not only reduces ﬂuid volume, but also
decreases vasoconstriction. The major pharmaco-
logical target in this pathway is the angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE).
Heart failure
Heart failure occurs when cardiac output is no
longer sufﬁcient to supply the metabolic demands
of the body. Failure begins with insufﬁciency dur-
ing exercise, although it progresses so that the
heart is unable to meet demand during rest. Heart
failure may be caused by pathology in the myo-
cardium (usually ischaemic heart disease), or cir-
culatory defects. The prognosis for those with heart
failure is poor. Those with serious heart failure are
unlikely to survive more than 6 months and 50% of
individuals with milder heart failure may be dead
within 5 years.
Progression of heart failure
As cardiac output decreases in the affected side of
the heart, it causes a backlog of ﬂuid to build up in
the venous system of the opposite circulation:
serious failure of the left side of the heart may
result in pulmonary oedema because the left heart
is unable to clear the venous return quickly en-
ough. Increased ﬂuid volume may occur as a result
of the reduced renal blood ﬂow, stimulating the
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
axis
to
retain
Na þ, with consequent retention of H2O.
Classiﬁcation of heart failure
The severity of heart failure can be classiﬁed with
regard to the physical limitations of the patient; the
New York Heart Association (NYHA) classiﬁcation
is used for heart failure because it is a good indi-
cator of prognosis:
. Class I – no physical symptoms and no apparent
limitation of physical exertion. Symptoms of
heart failure are diagnosable by imaging (e.g.
chest radiograph).
. Class II – symptoms present during physical
activity, not affected under ordinary activity.
226
Integrative physiology

. Class III – symptoms manifest under ordinary
activity.
. Class IV – unable to perform any activity without
symptoms.
Treatment of heart failure
Treatment of heart failure is through the manage-
ment of symptoms. The therapies used do not have
a signiﬁcant effect on correcting the underlying
pathology:
. Diuretics reduce ﬂuid volume.
. Vasodilators reduce the resistance against which
the heart must pump. Nitrates donate NO to
trigger vasodilatation whereas ACE inhibitors act
through both inhibition of vasodilatation and
reduction in ﬂuid retention by the renin–angio-
tensin–aldosterone axis.
. b Blockers may be added to reduce the work that
the heart does, limiting the damaging effects of
sympathetic stimulation on the failing heart.
. Cardiac glycosides increase the contractile force
of the heart without signiﬁcantly increasing its
metabolic demands. These are often used in
patients with chronic atrial ﬁbrillation or who
have not responded sufﬁciently to treatment
with ACE inhibitors and diuretics. Although car-
diac glycosides do little to improve mortality, it
improves the symptoms and reduces hospital
admissions.

Shock is inadequate perfusion of the body’s or-
gans. It is a medical emergency with a high mor-
tality, even at specialist centres. In a normal phys-
iological response, the vasculature supplying es-
sential organs will dilate to increase blood ﬂow if
they are inadequately perfused. In shock, this re-
sponse can contribute to a further lowering of the
blood pressure – the hypoxia of the tissues leads to
the release of many vasodilatory mediators which
cause both capillary dilatation and increased vas-
cular permeability. There are many causes of shock
and they share similar symptoms:
. Shortness of breath and oedema
. Fatigue
. Cyanosis
. Enlarged heart
. Low blood pressure.
Shock may have one of many underlying causes,
including:
. Cardiogenic shock results directly from defec-
tive surgery of the heart so that it cannot generate
sufﬁcient contractile force, despite adequate ﬁll-
ing of the ventricles. The treatment of cardiogen-
ic shock depends on the underlying cause.
. Hypovolaemic shock results from an insufﬁcient
vascular volume, although signiﬁcant loss of
the circulating blood volume (around 10%) is
required. Treatment of hypovolaemic shock
focuses on restoring the circulating volume, and
repairing the underlying cause (e.g. surgery to
repair trauma).
. Anaphylactic shock results from the widespread
vasodilatation that occurs in a severe allergic
(anaphylactic) reaction. Treatment depends on
managing the underlying causes, while adrena-
line stabilises the blood pressure in the interim.
. Septic (toxic) shock results from bacterial infec-
tion causing a widespread vasodilatory response.
Antibiotics are crucial to clear the infection that
causes septic shock; activated protein C also
appears to be effective
The response to exercise
Increased physical activity dramatically increases
the metabolic demands of the tissues. This exer-
tion requires changes in the distribution and cir-
culation of blood and thermoregulation of the
body, as well as greater ventilation to supply suf-
ﬁcient oxygen to the blood and tissues and to clear
metabolic products. Exercise can be divided into
two types based on the utilisation of oxygen:
1 Anaerobic respiration utilises the muscles
stores of ATP. Additional ATP can be generated
through use of phosphocreatine and glycolysis
of glucose to produce lactate. Fast twitch muscle
ﬁbres generate force rapidly through anaerobic
respiration and are unable to maintain contrac-
tion for more than a few seconds, because their
energy stores are rapidly depleted.
2 Aerobic respiration is a more efﬁcient means of
generating ATP, allowing prolonged exercise,
although at a lower rate than is generated from
phosphocreatine stores. Aerobic respiration is
the dominant form of ATP production in skeletal
muscle over prolonged exercise, because it pro-
duces fewer toxic by-products.
During exercise, skeletal muscle must use large
amounts of ATP for contraction. At rest, skeletal
Integrative physiology 227

muscle typically uses less than 2 mL O2/min,
whereas at maximal exercise it can require more
than 150 mL O2/min. The dominant mechanisms
of ATP production during muscle contraction are
initially anaerobic:
. Stores of phosphocreatine in the muscle are
used to regenerate ATP without the need for
respiration, although these are very limited and
exhausted within seconds.
. Anaerobic generation of ATP through glycolysis
is also possible in small amounts. The process is
extremely inefﬁcient and can be sustained only
for a short while, due to the build-up of lactate as
a by-product.
Longer periods of activity require the generation
of ATP by aerobic respiration:
. Glycogen stores can be used to generate glucose
for aerobic respiration (as well as anaerobic gly-
colysis). This pathway occurs rapidly through the
breakdown of glycogen stores in the muscle.
. Energy supply during long-term exercise is
through glucose release from the breakdown of
glycogen in the liver and fatty acids released from
the adipose tissue.
Fatigue in exercise
Over long periods of exercise muscles become
fatigued, and are incapable of generating a con-
sistent contractile force. This fatigue results from a
decrease in the level of glycogen in the muscle
ﬁbres, although the reasons for this leading to
fatigue are not entirely clear. Athletes often eat
carbohydrate-rich meals before exercise to in-
crease stores of glycogen within the muscle, thus
delaying the onset of fatigue. During exercise there
are also changes that occur to the plasma levels of
lactate and potassium, which can limit exercise:
. Lactate levels are low at rest and mild exercise,
but rise during intense exercise through anaer-
obic respiration. Lactate limits exercise because
it lowers the pH of the blood and contributes to
the pain in fatigue. Training can reduce the
amount of lactate produced during exercise, re-
ducing fatigue.
. Potassium is released due to the continued cy-
cles of depolarisation of muscle cells. As a result,
potassium levels may reach 6–7 mmol/L, a level
that would be seen as very dangerous at rest.
However, the heart appears to be protected dur-
ing exercise.
Changes in the demands for
oxygen during exercise
Oxygen supply to the tissues usually limits the rate
of exercise in the long term. Increasing intensity
beyond the threshold to where anaerobic respira-
tion predominates rapidly leads to intolerable in-
creases in lactate and potassium. At rest, oxygen
consumption is about 250 mL O2/min, increasing
to more than 3000 mL/min at maximal exercise.
Three changes occur to provide the additional
oxygen required by the muscle:
1 Cardiac output increases so that more oxygen-
ated blood reaches the tissue during a given time
period.
2 Ventilation increases to allow more oxygen into
the blood.
3 Venous O2 saturation falls as the tissue removes
more O2 from the blood. Arterial O2 saturation is
almost maximal at rest, so there is little scope to
increase O2 in the blood by this means.
Changes to the cardiovascular
system during exercise
About a fourfold increase in cardiac output can be
achieved during exercise through increases in both
heart rate and stroke volume. Although heart rate
can rise signiﬁcantly (to around 200 beats/min),
stroke volume rapidly reaches amaximum (around
130 mL) at about a third of maximum ventilation.
The cardiac output and the total peripheral resis-
tance are responsible for determining systemic
blood pressure:
Cardiac output  Total ðsystemicÞ peripheral resistance
¼ Blood pressure:
During exercise, mean blood pressure does not
change signiﬁcantly. Although the cardiac output
increases, there is a corresponding decrease in the
total peripheral resistance (as a result of the dila-
tation of the vascular beds in the skeletal muscle).
The changes that occur in the vasculature system
are twofold, both due to the effects of the sympa-
thetic nervous system:
1 The vessels in the respiring skeletal muscle
dilate to allow increased blood ﬂow and there-
fore

delivery.
Circulating
adrenaline and sympathetic stimulation will
trigger vasodilatation of the skeletal muscle

228
Integrative physiology

2 The vessels in the viscera contract to maintain
some peripheral resistance and an adequate
blood pressure through activation of the a1-
adrenoceptors
expressed
on
the
vascular
smooth muscle.
The effects of sympathetic stimulation on the
skeletal muscle capillaries is accentuated by the
dilatation induced by local metabolic signals. In
exercise the blood passing through the skeletal
muscle may increase 20-fold to meet demand.
Changes in the respiratory system
Ventilation increases rapidly with exercise, reﬂect-
ing increased oxygen usage. At low-intensity
exercise additional ventilation is achieved through
increases in the tidal volume, whereas at higher-
intensity exercise the rate of ventilation also
increases signiﬁcantly. At rest, a blood cell spends
about 0.8 seconds in the alveolus. However, during
exercise this may be as low as 0.2 seconds (as a
result of the fourfold increase in cardiac output).
The time taken to equilibrate O2 between the blood
cell and the alveolus is around 0.25 seconds,
causing a slight discrepancy in alveolar and arterial
PO2 at high exercise.
In tissues, the additional oxygen gained is O2
extracted from the red blood cells by the tissue,
which is reﬂected in the lower venous O2 seen
during exercise. At rest:
. PaO2 is about 100 mmHg (13.3 kPa) and it is
similar at exercise
. PvO2 is about 40 mmHg (5.3 kPa) and will de-
crease further during exercise.
. PvCO2 is about 50 mmHg (6.7 kPa) and increases
during exercise, reﬂecting the increased respira-
tion in the muscles.
. PaCO2 is about 40 mmHg (5.3 kPa) and decreases
during exercise due to the increased ventilation.
Regulation of exercise
Respiratory and cardiovascular systems are con-
trolled by changes detected through the chemor-
eceptors and the baroceptors, yet in exercise rapid
changes are seen faster than would be detected by
these systems. This has lead to the deﬁnition of
three phases in exercise:
1 Phase I is characterised by increases in both
ventilation and heart rate. This process is cen-
trally controlled and may precede the initiation
of exercise.
2 In phase II there is a gradual increase in both
ventilation and cardiac output to reach a max-
imum. The responses appear to be driven by the
peripheral chemoreceptors and also through
afferent signals from the muscles and their re-
lease of K þ and H þ.
3 Phase III reﬂects steady-state exercise where
constant high levels of ventilation and cardiac
output are seen.
Regulation of pH
All the enzymatic processes in the body require
very speciﬁc pH values to function optimally.
Blood pH is maintained at about 7.4 and must
remain between 7.35 and 7.45. Typically, 50 mmol
of H þ is ingested per day and is closely related to
the
protein
(amino
acids)
ingested.
Around
70 mmol of H þ and 20 mmol of alkali are excreted
per day, predominantly through the kidneys and
the gut, respectively.
Acids produced in the body can be classed as
volatile and non-volatile:
. Volatile acids refer to CO2. This acidic gas is
carried in the blood as H2CO3 and can be
excreted in the lungs by ventilation, without the
loss of HCO3
.
. Non-volatile acids are those non-gas-derived
acids produced in metabolism. These are typi-
cally through the metabolism of amino acids,
leading to the production of H2SO4 and HCl.
Buffering of non-volatile acids uses HCO3

which must be replaced by new production of
HCO3
.
Three different mechanisms can compensate for
changes of pH over different timescales:
1 Buffering of H þ
2 Respiratory regulation of pH
3 Metabolic (renal) regulation of pH.
Buffering reduces the pH change seen through
the addition of acid, by reducing the number of free
H þ ions present. However, H þ must be removed
or
the
buffering
becomes

less
effective.
Buffering of H þ
In the blood H þ is buffered by bicarbonate. The
addition of H þ leads to the production of H2O and
Integrative physiology 229

CO2. As a result of this buffering, H þ can be tightly
controlled, although the pH of the blood is also
affected by PCO2 and the concentration of HCO3
.
H þ þ HCO3
 $ H2CO3 $ H2O þ CO2:
The buffering reaction for H þ takes place in two
stages:
1 The ﬁrst stage of this reaction, the conversion of
H þ and bicarbonate to carbonic acid, occurs
spontaneously and does not require enzymatic
catalysis.
2 The second reaction, converting H2CO3 to CO2
and H2O, is catalysed by the enzyme carbonic
anhydrase, which is found on the surface of red
blood cells.
In addition to bicarbonate, there are other mole-
cules that contribute to a lesser extent to pH buff-
ering, through similar reversible reactions:
. Inorganic phosphate:

. Ammonia

Regulation of intracellular pH
Intracellular pH is maintained through two processes:
1 Buffering by weak acids and proteins similar to
that seen in the blood
2 H þtransport across the cell membrane.
Buffering of intracellular pH
Buffering of intracellular pH is similar to that which
occurs in the blood, although the actual buffers and
their contributions vary slightly. The major mole-
cules accounting for buffering intracellularly are:
. Bicarbonate
. Phosphate
. Amino acids (predominantly histidine).
H þ transport across the cell
membrane
Two transporters contribute to the regulation of
H þ movement across the cell membrane:
1 The Na þ/H þexchanger extrudes an H þ ion
across the cell membrane by secondary active
transport, powered by the Na þ gradient across
the membrane.
2 The HCO3
/Cl exchanger is powered by the
Cl  gradient across the cell membrane to ex-
trude HCO3
, allowing the retention of H þ in
the cell as an acid-loading mechanism. Further-
more, H þ inhibits the function of the exchanger,
reducing its action in lower pH conditions.
Respiratory regulation of pH
The respiratory system aids regulation of pH
through alteration of the CO2 levels. Removing CO2
from the blood allows more H þ to be drawn into
the reaction, thus correcting, to some extent, the
pH. Although such compensation does not replen-
ish the HCO3
, it allows for rapid compensation of
pH to a greater extent than if there were a closed
buffering system, i.e. one where CO2 could not be
removed from the system.
Regulation of ventilation by pH
As a result of the equilibrium reaction between H þ
and HCO3
, which produces CO2 and H2O, a lower
pH increases ventilation, by increasing CO2 in two
locations, stimulating the respiratory drive:
1 The central chemoreceptors, which detect an
increase in CO2 in the CSF
2 The peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid
and aortic bodies.
CLINICAL Respiratory acidosis
Respiratory acidosis results from an inability of the
lungs to remove sufﬁcient amounts of CO2 from the
blood. It is associated with hypoventilation, either
through a decreased respiratory drive or through
obstruction of the airways or lung disease. The body
can compensate for a respiratory acidosis through
the actions of the kidneys, which extrude the addi-
tional H þ, althoughsuch compensation occursover
several hours or days.
Renal regulation of pH
Although volatile acids can be removed from the
blood without using up bicarbonate, non-volatile
acids require bicarbonate to neutralise H þ. New
bicarbonate must be produced to replace that
which is lost, or reclaimed by moving H þ directly
230
Integrative physiology

CLINICAL Respiratory alkalosis
Respiratory alkalosis occurs as a result of hyper-
ventilation, when too much CO2 is removed from
the circulation, thus drawing too much acid out.
Respiratory alkalosis can occur in anxiety when fear
induces increased breathing or through hypoxia
when the drive to obtain sufﬁcient oxygen triggers
greater removal of CO2. Physiological compensa-
tion of respiratory alkalosis is through the retention
of H þ by the kidneys.
out of the body. The kidneys perform two functions
related to the acid–base balance:
1 Reabsorption of ﬁltered HCO3

2 Production of HCO3
 which is used to buffer
non-volatile acids.
Different processes occur in different sections of
the nephron tubule:
. HCO3
 is released into the nephron by ultraﬁl-
tration of the blood in the glomerulus.
. In the proximal tubule most of the HCO3
 is
reabsorbed – about 80%. This is accomplished by
H þ secretion into the nephron (mainly by coun-
tertransport with Na þ).
. The distal tubule and collecting duct make a
smaller contribution to the reabsorption of
HCO3
, but are important for the secretion of
non-volatile acids.
Reabsorption of ﬁltered HCO3

HCO3
 combines with H þ in the nephron to form
carbonic acid. This is converted to H2O and CO2,
catalysed by carbonic anhydrase IV which is
found on the luminal surface of the nephron cells.
The resulting H2O and CO2 diffuse into the cell
where they are reconverted to H þ and HCO3
.
The HCO3
 enters the bloodstream, whereas the
H þ can be reused to reabsorb more HCO3
 from
the lumen. The reabsorbed HCO3
 is transported
across the basolateral membrane, mainly through
the actions of the HCO3
/Cl  anion exchanger
(Fig. 11.2).
There are three transporters that transport H þ to
the lumen of the nephron for the reabsorption of
HCO3
 or the excretion of H þ:
1 The Na þ/H þexchanger transports H þ into the
nephron lumen, driven by the Na þ gradient
from the lumen to the cell cytoplasm. In
particular, the NHE3 isoform of the transporter
is responsible for most H þ transport in the
kidney.
2 H þATPase is found mainly in the distal neph-
ron, and can move H þ against a signiﬁcant
concentration gradient using the energy gener-
ated by hydrolysis of ATP. H þ ATPase function
andexpressionappeartoberegulated,inpart,by
aldosterone, which promotes its expression.
3 The H þ/K þexchanger is mainly found in the
collecting duct and extrudes H þ ions while re-
absorbing K þ ions.
Regeneration of HCO3

HCO3
, which neutralises H þ derived from non-
volatile acids, must be regenerated, so that the
excess H þ is retained in the urine and excreted
from the body. H þ is secreted by the same process
used in the reclamation of ﬁltered HCO3
. How-
ever, instead of combining with HCO3
, the H þ
combines with either HPO4
2  or NH3. This occurs
mainly
in
the
distal
parts
of
the
nephron,
where much of the HCO3
 has already been
reclaimed.
Regulation of H þ secretion
Much of the net acid–base balance in the body can
be regulated by the secretion of H þ. This is con-
trolled by intercalated cells, which are classiﬁed by
the arrangement of their transporters (and hence
the direction in which they transport H þ and
HCO3
), although they can alter the polarity of
CLINICAL Metabolic acidosis
A metabolic acidosis is caused by an alteration in
the production or removal of non-volatile acids. In
particular, renal failure (when H þ excretion is re-
duced), diarrhoea (when HCO3
 is lost from the
gut) and diabetic ketoacidosis may cause a meta-
bolic acidosis. Intense exercise, resulting in the
production of large amounts of lactic acid, also
constitutes a metabolic acidosis.
The body rapidly compensates for a metabolic
acidosis through increasing ventilation to remove
CO2. However, this compensation is of limited effect
because it does not regenerate HCO3
, and merely
accommodates an increased amount of H þ in the
body before the pH is severely disturbed.
Integrative physiology 231

expression of proteins to suit the needs of the
nephron:
. Type A intercalated cells transport H þ across
their luminal surface and HCO3
 from their
basolateral surface, following generation of both
species by the cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase.
This allows them to increase the pH in the blood
through the removal of H þ from the body and
the addition of HCO3
.
. Type B intercalated cells possess the same ma-
chinery for acid transport as seen in the type A
cells, although reversed so that the H þ is trans-
ported into the blood, whereas HCO3
 is trans-
ported into the tubule.
The synthesis of ammonia is altered to maintain
a steady acid–base balance, through modulation of
the amount of H þ excreted, which alters the pH of
the blood.
Diffusion trapping
Diffusion trapping is the mechanism by which H þ
ions are retained in the nephron so that they can be
Reabsorption
H2CO3 is produced in the tubule from 
H+ and HCO3– and is converted to CO2 
and H2O catalysed by carbonic 
anhydrase. CO2 can freely diffuse into 
the cell where it is returned to H+ and 
HCO3– by an intracellular carbonic 
anhydrase. While HCO3 is returned to 
the bloodstream to replenish the 
buffering potential, the H+ can be 
re-extruded to the tubules, primarily 
through Na+/H+ exchange proteins on 
the cell surface.
Neutralisation
To remove H+ from the system it must 
combine with a urinary buffer other 
than HCO3. Typically, H+ combines 
with NH3 or H2PO4, because the 
resulting ions are trapped in the 
tubule and not transported back into 
the epithelium. The majority of H+ 
from non-volatile acids is processed 
in this way.
Type B cells
Type B cells possess the same protein 
systems as found on type A cells but in 
reverse. This allows removal of HCO3– 
into the urine, and corresponding 
secretion of H+ into the blood to lower 
the blood pH, counteracting alkalotic 
changes.

Regulation of potassium
Most K þ is found intracellularly and results in a
gradient that has important physiological roles:
. It accounts for much of the resting membrane
potential.
. Movement of K þ is the driving force behind
membrane repolarisation in the action potential.
Intracellular K þ ions regulate important cellular
variables:
. The osmotic potential of the cell, and hence the
cell volume
. Enzyme function
. Intracellular pH.
At rest, plasma potassium is typically 4 mmol/L,
whereas intracellular K þ is around 140 mmol/L.
The exclusion of Na þ from cells as a result of the
Na þ/K þATPase is essentially the cause of the high
intracellular K þ.
Normal potassium balance
Potassium is ingested in the diet and absorbed by
the gut – around 80 mmol/day is ingested, of which
70 mmol is absorbed. The major loss of K þ is
through the kidneys, where it is used by exchange
proteins. K þ can also be found in many of the
secretions in the body, and a small amount may be
lost in sweat, through shedding of skin and through
secretion of K þ in the distal sections of the gut.
CLINICAL Hyperkalaemia
Hyperkalaemia is deﬁned as a resting plasma po-
tassium concentration >5 mmol/L. It is typically
causedby renalfailure,preventingnormalsecretion
of K þ. Acidosis can also trigger hyperkalaemia (as
increased H þ excretion can result in retention of
K þ). The abnormal levels of K þ in the blood affect
many different systems. They:
. promote cardiac arrhythmia – prolonged QRS
complex and a peaked T wave
. reduce reabsorption of NaCl by the kidneys
. reduce
ammonia
production,
promoting
acidosis
. increase vasodilatation leading to hypotension
. promotes paraesthesia and muscle paralysis.
Treatment of high K þ is initially to stabilise the
heart through administration of calcium gluconate,
and then administration of insulin with glucose and b
blockers, both of which promote uptake of K þ into
the tissues. Finally a K þ-binding substance can be
used to sequester the K þ from the blood.
Short-term regulation of K þ
In the short term, K þ plasma levels can be
‘buffered’ by movement of K þ into or out of cells
by the concentration gradient, and to some extent
by the Na þ/K þ ATPase, which many hormones
regulate:
. Insulin
increases
intracellular
potassium
through stimulating the function of the Na þ/K þ
ATPase. Related to this, increased extracellular
K þ stimulates insulin release from the b cells.
. Catecholamines have differing effects on K þ
handling depending on the receptors through
which they act. The b2-receptors stimulate
Na þ/K þ
ATPase promoting
uptake of K þ,
whereas a-adrenoceptors trigger release of K þ
from the liver, which may lead to a transient
hyperkalaemia. Infusing adrenaline is likely to
trigger a mild hyperkalaemia ﬁrst, as a result of
the effects on the a-adrenoceptors, and then a
longer hypokalaemia, as a result of the actions on
the b2-adrenoceptors.
Integrative physiology 233

CLINICAL Hypokalaemia
Hypokalaemia is a resting K þ of <3.5 mmol/L
which may result from a lack of K þ in the diet. Many
diuretics can trigger loss of K þ secondary to in-
creased reabsorption of Na þ. Hypokalaemia can
have particularly severe consequences on the heart
because it hyperpolarises the sinoatrial node cells,
resulting in a bradycardia. This hyperpolarisation
may also reduce cardiac contraction and result in
the heart stopping in diastole. Treatment of hypo-
kalaemia is through increasing K þ in the diet and, if
necessary, infusing K þ-containing solutions.
Processes modulating the
regulation of the K þ balance
There are a number of systems that modulate K þ
levels to maintain the homoeostasis of other
variables. As a result, there can be considerable
alterationsinK þ levelsdueto manydifferentfactors:
. The acid–base balance regulates pH level through
the movement of Hþ ions; this often involves
movement of Kþ in the opposite direction, partic-
ularly in response to inorganic acids. In general, an
increaseinHþ resultsinadecreaseinKþ,although
the precise mechanisms are not fully understood.
. Cell volume is regulated by the distribution of
K þ and other ions across the cell membrane,
which triggers osmosis to maintain an osmotic
equilibrium.
. Cell lysis causes release of intracellular K þ to the
plasma. Severe trauma can cause hyperkalaemia
through the release of K þ from the ruptured cells.
. Exercise can lead to a transient increase in K þ.
Although the hyperkalaemia is marked, it does
not appear to have effects associated with a
similar hyperkalaemia at rest.
. Diarrhoea prevents the absorption of K þ from
the gut.
Long-term regulation of K þ
Although the short-term regulation of K þ
is
achieved by movement into and out of cells, the
longer-term regulation is through the kidneys. On
average, 100 mmol K þ is taken up by the body each
day; a similar amount must be excreted each day
from the kidneys, as a result of three processes:
1 Filtration: about 800 mmol K þ enter the ne-
phrons through glomerular ﬁltration each day.
A large proportion of the ﬁltered K þ must be
reabsorbed.
2 Reabsorption: in normal conditions, K þ is rap-
idly reclaimed in the early segments of the prox-
imal convoluted tubule. This occurs predomi-
nantly through the setting up of a concentration
gradient by Na þ (and ﬂuid reabsorption). To
ensure K þ absorption, K þ channels are rapidly
upregulated in response to upregulation of
Na þ/K þ ATPase.
3 Secretion: with normal diets, there is some se-
cretion of K þ in the distal convoluted tubule and
collecting ducts. This secretion is through K þ
channels andexpressed inthe apicalmembrane,
powered by the Na þ/K þ ATPase in the basolat-
eral membrane of principal cells. In low-K þ
diets, cells may reabsorb K þ to further reduce
K þ loss; this is achieved by intercalated cells,
which obtain K þ from the lumen via the K þ/H þ
exchanger.
Regulation of renal K þ handling
Renal K þ handling is associated with the reabsorp-
tion of Na þ from the nephron. Three major hor-
mone pathways modulate K þ handling in the
kidneys:
1 ADH promotes the uptake of Na þ, thus in-
creasing the electrochemical gradient between
the cell membrane and the nephron, by making
the interior of the cell less negative. This
change increases K þ excretion from the cells,
to offset the decreased excretion resulting from
the decrease in tubular ﬂow – allowing greater
exchange of K þ
for Na þ
by the Na þ/K þ
ATPase.
2 Aldosterone promotes K þ excretion by Na þ/K þ
ATPase activity in the principal cells of the neph-
ron. Unsurprisingly, hyperkalaemia stimulates
aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands.
3 Glucocorticoids

Temperature
Core body temperature is typically maintained
close to 37 C, although during sleep it may drop
234
Integrative physiology

markedly. If body temperature changes much from
36–37.5 C, it is a serious clinical problem. Both
hypothermia and hyperthermia are dangerous.
CLINICAL Hypothermia
Hypothermia is deﬁned as a core body tempera-
ture below 35 C; as body temperature falls, there
is progressive loss of CNS function. At around
30 C, loss of consciousness occurs and ventricu-
lar ﬁbrillation is likely at around 27 C. Neverthe-
less, should these risks be avoided, people may
survive low core temperatures without circulation
and be revived.
CLINICAL Hyperthermia
Hyperthermia is associated with a core body tem-
perature greater than 40 C. Elevations in temper-
ature may be caused by fever and exercise, and
illness may induce hyperthermia. The body is less
able to withstand increases in temperature – at
42 C there is a risk of death.
Regulation of body temperature
The ambient temperature is usually lower than
that of the body. As a result, there is a general loss
of heat from the body to its surrounding environ-
ment. The body aims to regulate its heat loss
within the thermoneutral zone, where the heat
loss from the body is roughly equal to the basal
metabolic rate, ensuring that the core body tem-
perature remains constant. The thermoneutral
zone is dependent on the regulation of three
factors:
1 The basal metabolic rate
2 The heat lost by the body
3 The ambient temperature.
Regulation of metabolic rate
The production of heat by the body is related to the
metabolic rate. Although heat production is related
to body mass, heat loss is related to the surface
area, which increases more slowly. As a result,
smaller individuals need a higher basal metabolic
weight to account for their proportionally larger
surface area related to their body mass.
The basal metabolic rate is regulated by many
factors. In particular, thyroid hormones play a key
role. Babies and children tend to have a higher
metabolic rate which is further accentuated by the
presence of brown fat, a tissue that is specialised
for heat generation. Metabolic rate may also be
upregulated during exercise and fever. In exercise,
the increased metabolism reﬂects the increased
activity of the body, whereas during fever it is a
systemic response to infection.
DEFINITION Basal metabolic rate
The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the energy ex-
pended to maintain function of the vital organs at
rest. The BMR makes up a large proportion of the
energy expenditure in a normal day – it is usually
quoted as around 2000 calories/day, although it
varies due to a number of factors:
. Decreases in BMR can occur with increasing age
and loss of muscle mass.
. Increases in BMR can occur with exercise and
increased muscle mass, as well as during infec-
tion, changes in environmental temperature,
stress, and ingestion of food and drink.
Heat loss
There are four processes by which heat can be
transferred to the external environment:
Radiation is usually the major source of heat loss.
The body also can absorb radiant heat, e.g. from
direct sunlight.
Evaporation results from the heating of water,
causing it to evaporate, thereby removing heat.
This form of heat loss accounts for around 20%
of the total. Sweating, as occurs during exercise,
can increase heat loss to around 20 times that of
the BMR, although it can also account for the
loss of up to 3 L of water/hour.
Convection is responsible for around 15% heat
loss. It results from heating of the air, which
rises and is replaced by cooler air. Forced con-
vection, as occurs in strong winds, can increase
the loss of heat by this means.
Conduction accounts for very little heat loss in still
air (around 5%). However, the conductivity of
water is more than 20 times greater than that of
air; this can account for hypothermia resulting
rapidly from cold water immersion.
Integrative physiology 235

DEFINITION Thermoneutral zone
The thermoneutral zone is the band of environmen-
tal temperature in which the heat lost to the envi-
ronment is balanced by the basal metabolic rate.
Although the body remains in the thermoneutral
zone, the core body temperature is maintained.
Regulation of the heat loss
Although core body temperature must remain
within a very narrow range, the skin itself is not
similarly constrained and acts as a heat exchanger
to ensure that heat lost maintains the body in the
thermoneutral zone. The skin alters how close the
blood ﬂows to the skin through modulation of the
distribution of blood ﬂow between the two plexus
(Fig. 11.3):
1 The dermal plexus is found at the dermal–
epidermal boundary so that much of the
heat from the blood can be transferred to the
ambient environment.
2 The subdermal plexus is found much further
fromthesurfaceoftheskinandcanactasashunt
to reduce heat loss through the opening of arte-
riovenous (AV) anastomoses.
The blood ﬂow through the skin can be varied
markedly to affect heat loss:
. In
the
thermoneutral
zone,
around
5–10
mL/min of blood ﬂows through every 100g of skin.
. At maximal vasodilatation, blood ﬂow may be as
high as 100 mL/min per 100 g of skin.
. To retain body heat, AV shunts in the skin can
open, reducing blood ﬂow near the surface of the
skin to as low as 1 mL/min per 100 g of skin.
Temperature receptors
The main site of temperature regulation is the
hypothalamus:
. Cells in the anterior region directly sense the
temperature in the blood itself. Stimulation of
this region triggers a response to increase heat
loss.
. Cells in the posterior region receive information
about temperature changes in the skin and other
distant sites. Stimulation triggers a response to
conserve heat, although the region itself contains
no thermosensitive areas.
Similar to pain stimuli, temperature stimuli are
carried on the thin Ad- and C-ﬁbres. The skin
contains two types of receptor:
1 Cold receptors detect decreasing temperatures,
with a peak response at around 30 C.
2 Hot receptors have an increasing response,
which peaks at around 40 C.
At higher temperatures (>42 C), heat can be
sensed as a painful stimulus through the activation
of the pain receptors. The conscious sensation of
temperature is adaptive: water in a swimming pool
initially feels very cool but rapidly becomes
comfortable.
Responses to high temperature
Three mechanisms can be used to accommodate
high temperatures:
1 Reduced heat production by reducing activity
and intake of food; this decreases heat genera-
tion through the breakdown of substrate to ATP.
Foodswithhighwatercontentbecomefavoured.
2 Increased heat loss is promoted through the
vasodilatation of the skin. Sweating is also in-
creased to promote heat loss by evaporation. In

Figure 11.3 The skin is the major site of temperature
regulation by balancing blood ﬂow through plexus
located at different depths in the skin. Blood ﬂow
through the dermal plexus allows a greater loss of heat,
whereas opening of arteriovenous shunts in the sub-
dermal plexus retains blood deeper in the tissue to
reduce heat loss. The arterioles supplying the skin are
particularly muscular and can reduce the net ﬂow of
blood to further limit heat loss. In times when greater
heat loss is required, the sweat glands in the skin can be
stimulated to promote evaporation.
236
Integrative physiology

humans, behaviour is also altered, e.g. varying
the clothes worn.
3 Increase in body temperature does not appear
to play a signiﬁcant role in humans, although it
occurs in many animal species.
It appears that some adaptation occurs to high
temperatures. After 1 month in a high temperature
environment, the amount of sweat produced has
markedly decreased.
Responses to low temperature
Many of the responses to low temperature are the
opposite of those seen at high temperature:
. Increased heat production is achieved by in-
creasing muscle activity. This may be voluntary,
as in hand rubbing or stamping, or involuntary
such as shivering. Thermogenesis can also be
achieved through the presence of brown fat, and
regulation of the thyroid hormones can alter
metabolic rate. Food intake is also increased –
particularly protein – to provide a source of
chemical energy.
. Decreased heat loss is achieved through vaso-
constriction of the vessels at the surface of the
skin and erection of the hairs to trap a layer of
insulating air. Also, behavioural changes include
wearing more clothes and turning up the heating
indoors.
. Reduction of body temperature is seen in some
individuals – particularly the Kalahari Bushmen,
who can allow their body temperature to drop at
night.
Unlike high temperatures, the body appears to
be unable to adapt to low temperature and is just as
sensitive after some 60 days of acclimatisation.
Regulation of external environment
Humans have been able to vary their external
environment to match the thermoneutral zone,
effectively increasing the climates in which they
can live. The major mechanism by which this is
achieved is through wearing clothes. Humans can
also modulate the ambient temperature of their
environment, through the use of central heating
and air conditioning.
Response to high altitude
At high altitudes the amount of oxygen available
decreases, due to both the lower amounts present
and the low gradient to drive diffusion from the air
to the blood to the tissues. Aseries of changes occur
that lead to a long-term acclimatisation to altitude-
induced hypoxia.
Detection of hypoxia
The major sensors of O2 change are the peripheral
chemoreceptors:
. The peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid
bodies can detect hypoxia and stimulate ventilation.
. The central chemoreceptors detect changes in
CO2 and H þ levels and are not driven by pure
hypoxia.
Changes induced by hypoxia
A number of body systems are involved in com-
pensating for hypoxia:
. Ventilation increases in hypoxia to ensure that
enough O2 is taken up in the lungs, resulting in
reducedalveolar andarterial PCO2.Thisdecrease
in CO2 acts on the chemoreceptors to suppress
ventilation; there is then a gradual increase in
ventilation as the set point of the peripheral che-
moreceptors changes during acclimatisation.
. Hypoxia induces a respiratory alkalosis through
the removal of CO2. To compensate, the kidneys
excrete HCO3
, although this is a relatively
slow process. In addition, higher levels of 2,3-
diphosphoglycerate are produced in the red
blood cells, to promote dissociation of O2 from
haemoglobin in the tissues.
. Haematocrit is increased in chronic hypoxia due
to elevated erythropoietin (EPO) production,
restoring potential O2 availability.
CLINICAL Acute mountain sickness
Acute mountain sickness can develop after ascents
of more than around 3000 m, particularly in those
undertaking strenuous physical activity shortly after
reaching high altitudes, and may be fatal, because
of the potential for cerebral and pulmonary oedema.
The symptoms include severe headache, insomnia,
rapid breathing (tachypnoea) and nausea, which
result from the oedema caused by respiratory alka-
losis which in turn results from hyperventilation
induced by hypoxia.
Symptoms may last for around a week, although
they may be reduced by giving acetazolamide,
which can oppose the alkalosis and promote bicar-
bonate loss in the kidneys.
Integrative physiology 237

. Cardiac output increases transiently at high
altitude to aid the transfer of O2 to the tissues
from the lungs. However, this is limited by the
necessity for diffusion in the alveoli to load the
blood cells with O2. During long-term acclima-
tisation, cardiac output returns to normal values,
ensuring sufﬁcient time for diffusion to be
completed.
CLINICAL Chronic mountain sickness
(Monge's disease)
During the long-term acclimatisation to high altitude
the haematocrit may increase, to help the oxygen-
carrying potential of the blood. A haematocrit >60%
causes a marked increase in the amount of cardiac
work required per millilitre of O2 delivered due to the
greater blood viscosity.
Monge’s disease occurs when the haematocrit
increase becomes detrimental. It is thought that this
is caused by a decrease in the sensitivity of the
ventilatorysystemto hypoxiawithouta similar loss of
sensitivity in the EPO system.
Stress
Stress is any change or event capable of disrupting
homoeostasis to an unusual degree. Humans are
unusual in that they can be stressed by anticipation
of future difﬁculties – such as exams – and respond
to these.
The nature of stressors and the
stress response
Stresses affecting the body may be acute or chron-
ic. Any sufﬁciently strong stressor invokes a gen-
eral response that affects many different systems
and is largely independent of the stimulus:
. Acute stressors can include trauma and the
resulting effects, extreme environmental condi-
tions (hot or cold), as well as infection and sleep
deprivation.
. Chronic stressors include many of the above
stimuli, although triggers can be more complex
and subtle, such as social problems. Such stresses
may affect people differently (e.g. phobias).
Initiation of stress response
The stress response is initiated by the hypothala-
mus
in
response
to
three
main
sources
of
information:
1 The
hypothalamus
provides
information
on the state of the body, receiving sensory
nervous input from tissues throughout the
body.
2 The higher centres of the brain provide infor-
mation on the state of the mind. Much stress is
the result of a perceived, and not necessarily
physical, stimulus.
3 The external environment can be detected by
the senses (e.g. touch, hearing, sight) to trigger
an appropriate stress response.
Three potential phases can be identiﬁed in a
stress response:
1 An acute response characterised as an ‘alarm’
reaction, associated with upregulation of the
sympathetic ‘ﬁght-or-ﬂight’ response.
2 A long-lasting resistance reaction regulated
predominantly by the hormone cortisol.
3 If the stressor is not eliminated exhaustion can
result, which may be terminal.
Acute stress response
The acute stress response prepares the body
for immediate activity in a ‘ﬁght-or-ﬂight’ re-
sponse. It can be divided into three interrelated
components:
1 Effects on the CNS
2 Effects on the sympathetic nervous system
3 Effects on the adrenal medulla.
Effects on the CNS
The acute stress response in the CNS is activated by
the hypothalamus. It induces the sympathetic re-
sponse, as well as promoting the activity of the
necessary cortical regions:
. Increases in heart rate and ventilation are trig-
gered by stimulating the medullary control
centres.
. The cerebral cortex is stimulated by the
release
of
noradrenaline
from
the
locus
ceruleus.
. The release of endorphins is triggered to blunt
the pain response.
238
Integrative physiology

. Release of ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hor-
mone) from the anterior pituitary gland is trig-
gered by corticotrophin-releasing hormone
(CRH) released from the hypothalamus. This
system is activated at the same time as the acute
response, although it is associated with the
chronic response due to the longer time that it
takes to reach a signiﬁcant effect.
. Release of ADH is stimulated in the posterior
pituitary gland to reduce water loss and trigger
glycogenolysis by the liver.
Activation of the sympathetic
nervous system
The sympathetic nervous system is activated to
ready the body for physical activity:
. Blood pressure, heart rate and force of cardiac
contraction are increased to aid oxygen and
glucose delivery to the tissues.
. Release of energy substrates is triggered. In
particular, glycogen is broken down to glucose
in the liver and lipid stores from the adipose
tissue are also mobilised.
. The blood vessels in the skeletal muscle
and skin dilate to increase ﬂow to the muscles
and remove potential heat from the body,
respectively. Vessels to non-essential tissues
are
constricted
to
divert
blood
to
the
muscles.
Effects on the adrenal medulla
Preganglionic sympathetic ﬁbres synapse with
chromafﬁn cells in the adrenal medulla. These
ﬁbres release acetylcholine to trigger release of
adrenaline and noradrenaline.
The chronic stress response
Long-lasting
stress
results
in
a
prolonged
‘resistance response’ that is distinct from the acute
‘ﬁght-or-ﬂight’ response. This resistance response
has evolved to conserve essential functions, allow-
ing the body to continue counteracting a stress
long after the acute response would have been
exhausted. The elements of this ‘resistance re-
action’ are triggered at the same time as the acute
phase of the stress response, although they take far
longer to manifest themselves.
The role of the sympathetic nervous
system in the chronic response
The sympathetic nervous system plays a smaller
part in the chronic stress response. It is responsible
for stimulating the juxtaglomerular apparatus of
the kidney to activate the renin–angiotensin–
aldosterone axis. The resulting angiotensin triggers
retention of both Na þ and H2O (via aldosterone) as
well as an increase in blood pressure, all of which
maintain the effective circulating volume.
The role of cortisol in the chronic
stress response
Cortisol, a glucocorticoid, is the major hormone in
the chronic stress response. It has a variety of
effects that preserve the body’s integrity and
function:
. Stimulates release of lipids and catabolism of
protein for energy
. Increases blood vessel sensitivity to constrictors
and reduces capillary permeability
. Maintains cardiac contractility
. Increases erythrocyte production.
Although glucocorticoids maintain body func-
tion, they also suppress repair because it is a costly
process in terms of materials. As a result, cortisol
triggers:
. reduced inﬂammation to avoid disruption of the
tissue function.
. decreased production of ﬁbroblasts to suppress
repair.
. inhibition of the immune response.
CLINICAL Stress-related illness
The stress response evolved to counter a physical
threat. As many of the stressors affecting us in
modern society are not physical, the stress re-
sponse is often counterproductive. High levels of
psychological stress may cause a mild physical
stress response, which may contribute to the de-
velopment of many ‘stress-related’ illnesses, such
as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Treatment of
such conditions can involve blunting of the stress
response (e.g. b blockers and ACE inhibitors).
Integrative physiology 239

Effects of stress on the regulation
of other hormone pathways
Although the adrenal gland is the major regulator
of the stress response, under the control of the
pituitary gland and the sympathetic nervous sys-
tem, other pathways are also important in the
regulation of the stress response:
. Thyroid hormones are elevated in the stress
response, as a result of increased release of
thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the
hypothalamus. The thyroid hormones increase
the metabolic rate and breakdown of glucose and
proteins and fats, to ensure that there is a readily
available energy source. In prolonged stress, glu-
cocorticoids reduce the conversion of thyroxine
(T4) to the more active triiodothyronine (T3),
reducing the catabolic response to lengthen sur-
vival by conserving energy stores.
. Growth hormone (GH) levels are increased dur-
ing the stress response, due to increased hypo-
thalamic
release
of
GH-releasing
hormone
(GHRH). Prolonged secretion of growth hor-
mone increases the release of glucose and fatty
acids into the circulation, to provide energy, and
also reduces the use of glucose by the tissues,
conserving it for the brain and blood where it is
an essential energy source.
Exhaustion
If the stress response continues without resolution,
the body or the CNS may no longer be able to
sustain it, resulting in exhaustion, which may be
fatal and manifests in obvious illness due to de-
pletion
of
the
body’s
resources.
Although
exhaustion of the stress response is not well un-
derstood, there are thought to be two major causes
of exhaustion:
1 Excessive
prolonged
aldosterone
activity
may lead to the loss of K þ through prolonged
attempts to conserve Na þ. This progressive
depletion can lead to a wide number of hypoka-
laemic problems and be fatal. High levels of
cortisol may exceed the activity of the deactivat-
ing enzymes present in cells expressing the
aldosterone receptor with which it can bind. As
a
result,
cortisol
may
potentiate
excessive
activation of the aldosterone response, and
further loss of K þ.
2 Adrenal medullary exhaustion results from de-
pletion of the catecholamine stores in the adre-
nal gland. This leads to a sudden fall in blood
glucose and loss of blood vessel tone and renal
function, associated withthe sudden withdrawal
of adrenaline. The resulting hypotension can
rapidly cause death. The standard treatment is
stabilisation by treatment with adrenaline to
restore blood pressure.

Reproduction
In humans, the sex chromosomes deﬁne the two
sexes. Males and females develop different sexual
organs to produce the gametes, and in the female
to allow the development of a baby from the single
fertilised cell, the zygote.
Following puberty, an individual becomes sex-
ually mature and capable of reproducing, which is
associated with a growth spurt, and the develop-
ment of mature gametes and the characteristic
differences between the sexes. The sex cells are
regulated by the production of sex hormones,
which stimulate continuous production of sperm
in men. In women, the sex hormone levels vary
in a cyclic fashion to coordinate maturation and
release of an egg, with preparation of the lining of
the uterus.
Advances in medicine have allowed individuals
to control their fertility through contraception or
sterilisation, and also allowed the induction of
abortion to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. In
addition conception through in vitro fertilisation
is possible.
Sexual differentiation
Sexual differentiation is the process by which the
undifferentiated fertilised egg (zygote) is commit-
ted to becoming either male or female. Sexual
differentiation
can be categorised into three
different types:
1 Genetic sex is determined by the presence or
absence of a Y chromosome.
2 Gonadal sex is determined by the presence of
ovaries or testes.
3 Phenotypic (‘legal’) sex is determined by the
external genitalia.
Male sex is determined by the presence of a Y
chromosome, more speciﬁcally the SRY region;
female sex is the default pathway in the absence
of a Y chromosome.
Gonadal development
Until week 6, gonadal development is the same for
both sexes. Primordial germ cells (the cells that
give rise to the gametes) are formed within the
primary ectoderm in week 2; in week 4 they detach
and move into the yolk sac. During weeks 5–6, they
migrate to form genital ridges – these are swellings
medial to the developing mesonephroi (Fig. 12.1).
The genital ridges consist of:
. Primordial germ cells which will develop into
oogonia or spermatogonia
. Primitive sex cords which are supporting cells,
stimulated by germ cells to form the adjacent
tissue. They are split into medullary and cortical
regions.
Adjacent to the genital ridges are the mesoneph-
ric (wolfﬁan) ducts, which will develop into the
ducts of the male reproductive system, and the
paramesonephric (m€ullerian) ducts, which will
develop into the uterus, fallopian tubes and vagina
in females.

Reproduction

DEFINITION Gametes
The gametes are the haploid reproductive cells
that fuse at fertilisation to produce a diploid zygote.
The gametes develop from the oogonia and sper-
matogonia in women and men, respectively. They
are produced by mitotic division of the primordial
germ cells.
DEFINITION The gonads
The gonads are the reproductive organs that
support the gametes:
. In men, the testes
. In women, the ovaries.
Development of the male gonads
The presence of the SRY gene stimulates develop-
ment of Sertoli cells, which form the testis cords
and release anti-m€ullerian hormone (AMH),
causing the paramesonephric ducts to regress.
Leydig cells develop and secrete testosterone,
stimulating the mesonephric ducts to form the vas
deferens, epididymis and seminal vesicles.
Week 7
. SRY protein production stimulates the medul-
lary sex cord cells to differentiate into Sertoli
cells,
and
the
cortical
sex
cord
cells
to
degenerate.
. The Sertoli cells form the testis cords. At puberty
the testis cords differentiate into seminiferous
tubules and rete testis.
Weeks 8–10
. Sertoli cells secrete AMH causing the parame-
sonephric ducts to regress. Sertoli cells also
inhibit germ cell development before meiosis
can occur.
. Leydig cells develop from the mesenchymal
cells
in
the
genital
ridge;
these
produce
testosterone, which promotes survival of the me-
sonephric ducts. At this stage maternal human
chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) controls secre-
tion of testosterone, although this is later con-
trolled by the pituitary gonadotrophs of the male
fetus.
Weeks 8–12
The mesonephric ducts differentiate into the vasa
deferentia and the epididymis.
Week 10
Seminal vesicles form from the mesonephric
ducts, near the attachment to the pelvic urethra.
The prostate is formed from endodermal evagi-
nations budding from the pelvic urethra.
DEFINITION Anti-m€ullerian hormone
(AMH)
AMH is a glycoprotein produced by Sertoli cells of
the male fetus. It suppresses the generation of
the paramesonephric (m€ullerian) ducts in the
male fetus during the ﬁrst 8 weeks, to ensure that
female genital structures do not develop.
Development of the female gonads
In the absence of the Y chromosome, development
of male gonads is not stimulated, resulting in
a female developmental pathway (see Fig. 12.1).
Week 7
The medullary sex cords degenerate and the
cortical sex cord cells differentiate into granulosa
cells.
Weeks 8–10
. The germ cells enter their ﬁrst meiotic division
and are surrounded by granulosa cells to form
primordial follicles. The granulosa cells subse-
quently arrest germ cell development until
puberty.
. The lack of testosterone results in regression of
the mesonephric ducts, whereas the absence
of AMH allows paramesonephric ducts to
develop and fuse at their caudal end to form
Reproduction 243

the uterus and the superior end of the vagina. The
unfused, superior portion of the paramesoneph-
ric ducts forms the fallopian tubes.
. The inferior end of the vagina is formed from
the sinuvaginal bulbs, a pair of swellings on the
posterior wall of the urogenital sinus.
Development of the external
genitalia
Development of external genitalia in the ﬁrst
12 weeks follows the same course in both sexes
(Fig. 12.2). At week 5, the cloacal folds develop on
either side of the cloacal membrane. These folds

meet anteriorly to form a midline swelling – the
genital tubercle. At week 7, the urorectal septum
fuses with the cloacal membrane to form the per-
ineum, dividing the cloacal folds into the anterior
urogenital membrane and the posterior anal mem-
brane. The area of cloacal fold ﬂanking the uro-
genital membrane is now called the urethral fold,
whereas that ﬂanking the posterior anal mem-
brane is now called the anal fold:
. Labioscrotal folds form either side of the cloacal
folds.
. The deﬁnitive urogenital sinus extends on to
the surface of the genital tubercle as the
urethralgroove.Inthemalethisislongandbroad,
whereas in the female it is shorter and tapered.
. The urogenital membrane ruptures so that
the cavity of the urogenital sinus is open to the
amniotic ﬂuid, and the genital tubercle elongates
to form the phallus.
Male external genitalia
From week 12, high levels of dihydrotestosterone,
converted from testosterone, trigger the develop-
ment into male genitalia.
. The deﬁnitive urogenital sinus forms the penile
urethra.
. The urethral fold fuses to enclose the urogenital
sinus, forming the penile urethra.
. The genital tubercle elongates to form the glans
and shaft of the penis.
. The labioscrotal folds fuse to form the scrotum.
DEFINITION Dihydrotestosterone
Dihydrotestosterone
(DHT)
is
a
metabolite
of
testosterone that is produced mainly in the testes
and adrenal glands by the action of the enzyme
5a-reductase. DHT is far more potent than testo-
sterone, and responsible for development of male
characteristics in utero.
Female external genitalia
In the absence of DHT, the primitive perineum
does not lengthen and the labioscrotal and urethral
folds do not fuse. The phallus bends inferiorly to
form the clitoris:
. The deﬁnitive urogenital sinus forms the vesti-
bule of the vagina.
. The urethral fold forms the labia minora.
. The labioscrotal fold forms the labia majora.
. The genital tubercle forms the glans and shaft of
the clitoris.
Migration of the gonads
The gonads descend from their original position at
the level of T10 due to shortening of the guber-
nacula. The arterial supply to the gonads does not
migrate, accounting for why the blood supply to
the testes (and the ovaries) is at the level of T10.
DEFINITION Gubernaculum
The gubernaculum is a ligamentous cord connect-
ing the gonads to the fascia by the labioscrotal
folds. The shortening of the gubernacula mediates
the descent of the testes in males, whereas it devel-
ops into the round and ovarian ligaments in women.
Migration of the male gonads
Between weeks 7 and 12 the gubernaculum short-
ens (by gettinglarger atthebases), pulling thetestes
down to the level of the deep inguinal ring. They
remain there until month 7, when testosterone
and other androgens cause further reduction and
regression, pulling the gonads into the scrotal sac.
CLINICAL Hermaphroditism
Defects in the development of the sexual organs
can result in individuals with both male and female
sexual tissue, or ambiguous genital organs.
True hermaphrodites have both ovarian and
testicular tissue. Most commonly this occurs in
mosaics.
Pseudohermaphrodites have the external gen-
italia of one sex and the gonads of another:
. Male pseudohermaphrodites are XY with femi-
nized genitals.
. Female pseudohermaphrodites are XX with mas-
culinised genitals.
Pseudohermaphroditism may occur as a result of
either abnormal levels of sex hormones or defects in
sex hormone receptors.
In
female
pseudohermaphrodites,
virilising
androgens cause clitoral hypertrophy and fusion of
the urethral and labioscrotal folds.
Reproduction 245

Migration of the female gonads
In week 7, the gubernaculum becomes attached
to the paramesonephric ducts. As the ducts fuse to
form the uterus, they sweep out peritoneal folds
(the broad ligaments) and pull the ovaries into
these folds.
Puberty and sexual
maturation
Puberty is the series of events that occur during
the transition from childhood into adulthood
and sexual maturity. Puberty occurs at about
8–13 years in girls and 9–14 years in boys. It is
characterised
by
physical
growth
and
pro-
nounced accentuation of sexual characteristics.
The sexual organs mature and become function-
al during puberty, although the order and time-
frame of these events may differ considerably
and can take many years.
Hormonal changes during
puberty
The developmental and physical changes that
occur during puberty are the result of hormonal
changes. Three major events occur:
1 The hypothalamus increases the production of
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH).
2 The anterior pituitary becomes more sensitive
to GnRH, triggering increased release of luteinis-
ing
hormone
(LH)
and
follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH).
3 The ovaries and testes become sensitive to FSH
and LH. As a result, the gametes begin to develop
and the sexual organs produce the sex hormones
in large quantities, triggering a growth spurt and
other changes.
Changes during puberty
The chronology of the changes that occur during
puberty varies greatly between individuals. The
production of sex hormones results in a number
of changes:
. Development of the genitalia
. Development
of
the
secondary
sexual
characteristics
. Actions of the central nervous system (CNS)
. Changes to the musculoskeletal and cardiovas-
cular systems.
Development of the genitalia
In men, the production of testosterone stimulates
the function of the prostate gland and seminal
vesicles. Testosterone promotes the growth and
development of the penis and testes, and initiates
spermatogenesis.
In women, the increased levels of oestrogen
stimulate development of the muscular tissue of
the uterus and increase development of the blood
vessels to the endometrium, as well as stimulating
cervical mucus production. The oestrogen surge
stimulates follicular development and the men-
strual cycle, although the initial cycles are not
associated with ovulation.
Development of secondary sexual
characteristics
The development of secondary sexual character-
istics of men and women differs due tothe different
hormones released, as well as the different tissues
present. However, there are some common events.
For example, the growth of thick hair around the
external genitalia and under the axillae occurs in
both sexes:
. In men, testosterone triggers lengthening of the
vocal folds which is associated with deepening of
the voice. In addition, testosterone stimulates
the production of thick terminal hairs on the face
and chest.
. In women, puberty also results in the develop-
ment of the breast tissue.
Actions on the CNS
At puberty the sex hormones activate the centres in
the CNS that regulate sex drive and sexual behav-
iour. These centres differentiate during the second
and third trimesters as a result of fetal secretion of
testosterone or oestrogen.
Development of the musculoskeletal
system
Puberty is associated with a marked increase in
height because the sex hormones increase bone
deposition and the growth of the long bones at the
246
Reproduction

epiphyseal plates. The sex hormones also promote
closure of the growth plates, effectively limiting the
height that can be reached:
. In men, growth is associated with broadening of
the shoulders and development of a male skeletal
frame.
. In women, oestrogen accounts for the growth
of the female frame, in particular the widening of
the pelvis. Oestrogens cause more rapid closure
of the growth plates, accounting for the shorter
height of women in adulthood.
The sex hormones also stimulate development
of the skeletal muscle ﬁbres to become stronger
and more durable, and lead to an increase in
muscle mass. As the effects of testosterone are
greater than those of oestrogen, the increase in
muscle mass is greater in males.
Effects of sex hormones on the
cardiovascular and respiratory
systems
Testosterone stimulates red blood cell formation
in the bone marrow and accounts for the increase
in blood volume and the haematocrit. Once men-
strual cycles have started, iron loss is associated
with menstruation, increasing the risk of iron-de-
ﬁciency anaemia in women.
CLINICAL Precocious puberty
Precocious puberty is the onset of puberty at
an extremely early age. This may be the result of
disease (e.g. a sex hormone-secreting tumour),
although in some very rare cases the individuals
may be otherwise medically normal. As well as
premature development of the sexual characteris-
tics, precocious puberty causes a decrease in
eventual height, due to early closure of the epiph-
yseal plates.
Generation of the male
gametes
There are two main processes in generation of the
male gametes:
1 Spermatogenesis is the process by which sper-
matid cells develop from the germ cells.
2 Spermiogenesis is the series of remodelling pro-
cesses that occurs without cell division, resulting
intheproductionofamaturespermatocytefrom
a spermatid.
Cells of the male sexual system
The seminiferous tubules are made up of a series of
distinct populations of cells:
. Sertoli cells are tightly apposed cells that form
the tubules.
. Leydig cells are found in the interstitium
between seminiferous tubules and regulate sper-
matogenesis through secretion of hormones.
. Germ cells are found in the basal compartment;
through differentiation and proliferation they
give rise to the mature sperm.
Sertoli cells
Sertoli cells enclose and support all the cells
undergoing spermatogenesis. These cells have
a large cytoplasm and an ovoid nucleus. They
contain large numbers of mitochondria as well as
lipid droplets and small amounts of rough endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER). Sertoli cells are connected
by a series of tight junctions found close to the
basal aspect of the epithelium, regulating the
movement between the two compartments. In
addition, Sertoli cells secrete a number of factors:
. Those
that
regulate
spermatogenesis
and
spermiogenesis
. Those that regulate hormone production – in
particular inhibin
. Factors
that
phagocytose
excess
spermatid
cytoplasm.
CLINICAL Delayed puberty
Puberty may be delayed for many reasons, includ-
ing malnutrition, a systemic disease (e.g. inﬂamma-
tory bowel disease) and a development defect (e.g.
pituitary or gonadal abnormality), or the individuals
may be medically normal.
If an underlying defect is detected, treatment of
this will often allow the onset of puberty (e.g. re-
dressing malnutrition). Puberty can also be induced
hormonally, if there is such a deﬁciency. If the
individual appears healthy and normal but with
delayed puberty, no intervention is warranted.

Spermatogenesis I
The Type A spermatogonia cells are found in the
basolateral compartment of the seminiferous tubules.
These cells proliferate mitotically to give rise to many
diploid Type B spermatogonia. During these divisions
the cells make their way to the adluminal compartment
of the seminiferous tubules. The subsequent divisions
of the cells are not complete – the cells retain a
cytoplasmic connection between each other until they
mature.
Spermatogenesis II
The primary spermatocytes develop from the Type B
spermatocytes as they enter into the prophase of the
first meiotic division . The resulting secondary
spermatocytes are haploid cells, containing only 23
chromosomes. The second meiotic division results in
the production of spermatids, the end product of
spermatogenesis, which are sculpted through the
processes of spermatogenesis to produce functional
spermatozoa.
Spermiogenesis I
The spermatids develop specific characteristics in
becoming spermatozoa. The first stage requires the
centrioles, which will organise the development of the
flagellum migrating to one end of the cells, whilst the
Golgi apparatus – which will develop into the
acrosomal vesicle - migrates to the opposite end of
the cell.
Spermiogenesis II
The centrioles organise the generation of the flagellum
and the mitochondria migrate around the first section
of the flagellum. In addition the nucleus progressively
condenses and the acrosomal vesicle fills with
enzymes and sits around the nucleus.  The volume of
cytoplasm progressively decreases and buds off as a
cytoplasmic droplet, which is removed by the Sertoli
cells.
Spermiogenesis III
The complete spermatozoa consist of a tightly
condensed nucleus surround by the acrosomal
vesicle. A mitochondrial sheath develops around the
first part of the flagellum containing the numerous
mitochondria to generate sufficient energy. The
complete spermatozoa have yet to be fully functional,
they develop motility as they pass through the
epididymis.
Figure 12.3 The generation of male gametes. The male gametes develop in Sertoli cells through a number of
stages to form spermatids, which are progressively remodelled to form the mature spermatozoa.

Reproduction

Leydig cells
Leydig cells in the interstitial tissue synthesise
and secrete the male sex hormones. The main
hormone that is produced is testosterone, se-
cretion of which is regulated by LH released
from the pituitary gland. Leydig cells have
large
nuclei
and
extensive
cytoplasm
with
eosinophilic granules and lipid droplets. Their
hormone-secreting function is reﬂected in the
rich plexus of blood and lymph that spreads
throughout the cells.
Spermatogenesis
To ensure continuous production of sperm, differ-
ent parts of a single tubule are involved in different
points of spermatogenesis (Fig. 12.3):
. Undifferentiated germ cells are termed type A
spermatogonia and are characterised by a
large
oval
nucleus
containing
condensed
chromatin with large nucleoli and a nuclear
vacuole.
. Type
B
spermatogonia
develop
from
the
division of Type A spermatogonia. They have
undergone several mitotic divisions and have
migrated to the adluminal compartment of the
tubules, to commence meiosis.
. The ﬁrst meiotic division takes around 3 weeks
to produce secondary spermatocytes which
are rarely seen as they divide rapidly to form
spermatids.
. Spermatids mature to produce sperm through
spermiogenesis. They progressively form sper-
matozoa as the cytoplasm is progressively
removed and the nucleus condenses.
Spermiogenesis
Spermiogenesis is the process by which sperma-
tids
develop
into
mature
spermatozoa.
This
process occurs in the seminiferous tubules and is
regulated and supported by Sertoli cells.
. The acrosomal vesicle develops from the Golgi
apparatus.
. The centrioles migrate opposite to the acroso-
mal vesicle and form the ﬂagellum.
. The cytoplasm and the mitochondria migrate
to the ﬁrst part of the ﬂagellum.
. The ﬂagellum elongates and the excess cyto-
plasm in the cell is progressively removed by
supporting Sertoli cells.
DEFINITION Acrosomal vesicle
The acrosomal vesicle is a specialised structure
that develops from the Golgi apparatus in sperma-
tozoa. This structure contains various enzymatic
secretions to help sperm penetrate the ovum for
fertilisation.
Maturation of sperm and
the production of semen
Developed spermatozoa are continuously released
from the tubules and pass through the rete testis to
the epididymis, where sperm are concentrated by
reabsorption of ﬂuid. In the epididymis further
secretions are added, in particular fructose and
carnitine, which act as energy sources, and various
glycoproteins, which coat the sperm.
The passage of the sperm through the epididy-
mis takes approximately 6–12 days, during which
they begin to acquire the ability to move. After
maturation, the fully activated sperm pass into the
vas deferens.
Semen
The combination of sperm and other secretions
released into the female reproductive tract is
known as semen. Although sperm taken from
the vas deferens are capable of fertilisation, the
secretions in semen help the sperm:
. They act as a ﬂuid vehicle for transport of the
sperm.
. They provide nutrition to the sperm.
. They act as an alkaline buffer to protect sperm
from the vagina’s acid environment.
. Enzymes trigger coagulation and decoagulation
of the semen in the vaginal tract.
Development of the
female gametes
A woman is born with a limited number of follicles
containing oocytes, the female gametes, which
mature progressively throughout her reproductive
life. At each stage of maturation only a small
proportion of follicles successfully progresses, en-
suring that only the most viable can be released at
Reproduction 249

ovulation. There are several distinct stages of
development:
. The primordial germ cells give rise to the
primary oocytes in the fetus and develop into
primordial follicles.
. Growing follicles develop after puberty. Groups of
primordial follicles begin to mature in a 3-month
cycle under the inﬂuence of hormones, in prepa-
ration for one to mature sufﬁciently for ovulation.
. A single mature follicle (secondary or graaﬁan
follicle) develops from each group of growing
follicles; this follicle develops completely and the
oocyte is released.
. After release of the oocyte, the follicle becomes
the corpus luteum, which, should fertilisation
occur, regulates the early stages of pregnancy
through hormonal secretion.
Primordial germ cells and
the development of primordial
follicles
The primordial germ cells migrate to the ovarian
tissue in early fetal development. Unlike the
development of sperm, which occurs throughout
life, there are a ﬁnite number of follicles that
mature progressively.
Primordial germ cells mature in the fetus
during months 4 and 5, developing into primary
oocytes, which start the ﬁrst stage of meiotic
division. During month 7 of fetal development,
primary oocytes becoming encapsulated by a sin-
gle layer of follicular cells, which stops meiotic
division of the primary oocyte until after puberty.
Growing follicles
During each menstrual cycle, coordinated secre-
tions of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland
trigger the maturation of about 20 primordial
follicles, although typically only one will mature
to release an oocyte (Fig. 12.4). Follicular growth
results in development of both the follicular
cells and the primary oocyte itself:
. The single matured oocyte rapidly enlarges, the
nuclear volume increases and the number of
mitochondria increases. The oocyte becomes
surrounded by a thick coat, the zona pellucida.
. The follicular cells develop and proliferate to
form the granulosa layer.
. The stromal cells surrounding the follicle differ-
entiate to form the theca folliculosa, which
itself develops into the theca interna and theca
externa.
DEFINITION Zona pellucida
The zona pellucida is a glycoprotein membrane
surrounding the oocyte, which is produced by the
oocyte and follicular cells. The major components of
the zona pellucida are involved in binding sperm
and triggered the acrosome reaction.
As the follicle develops, ﬂuid accumulates within
a cavity known as the antrum. The antral ﬂuid
contains steroid-binding proteins and high con-
centrations of steroids. In the granulosa layer cells
accumulate around the oocyte, forming the cumu-
lus oophorus. Expanding follicles will die unless
they receive a coordinated release of an LH surge
simultaneous with their expression of high levels of
LH receptors on the cell surfaces. LH acts on both
granulosa and thecal cells, leading to a variety of
changes to allow ovulation and the subsequent
generation of the corpus luteum.
Growth preovulation
The LH surge reactivates meiosis, allowing com-
pletion of the ﬁrst meiotic division. The cytoplasm
is divided extremely unevenly; the secondary
oocyte retains almost all the cytoplasm, whereas
the ﬁrst polar body is produced which contains
almost no cytoplasm.
The secondary oocyte immediately enters the
second stage of meiosis though arrests in meta-
phase. It is not clear how this process is directly
regulated – although the oocyte matures after the
LH pulse, it does not directly express LH receptors,
relying instead on signals from the surrounding
cells. The changes in the oocyte are accompanied
by changes in the follicular cells, in particular
they produce large amounts of extracellular ﬂuid,
resulting in an increased follicle size.
DEFINITION Polar body

a
structure
that

portioning
of
cytoplasm
during divisions of the ovum. These cells contain
chromosomes and very little cytoplasm. They serve

Reproduction

Mature follicles and ovulation
Mature (Graaﬁan) follicles are large structures –
about 2.5 cm in diameter – which can be found as a
large vesicle forming a bulge on the surface of the
ovary. The follicular cavity contains a large volume
of ﬂuid, and the oocyte is attached to the wall of
the follicle by a pedicle of granulosa cells.
The rapid growth of the follicle immediately
before ovulation leads to a bulge forming on the

Primary follicle
The follicles present before puberty are the 
primary follicles, made up of the oocytes 
surrounded by a thin layer of granulosa cells. 
These follicles are surrounded by the stromal 
cells of the ovaries.
Preantral follicle
During the menstrual cycle the sex hormones 
stimulate cohorts of follicles to develop. These 
growing follicles have a developed zona 
separating the oocyte from its supporting 
granulosa cells. In addition, the thecal cells that 
surround the granulosa are separated by a 
basement membrane. 
The dominant follicle in a cohort expresses 
increased numbers of luteinising hormone 
receptors, which allow them to further develop, 
while preventing the maturation of other 
follicles within the cohort. As a result the 
increased stimulation triggers secretion of fluid 
and development of a graafian, or secondary, 
follicle.
Graafian follicle
The mature follicle that releases its oocyte has 
a specialised structure. Distinct layers of the 
theca interna and externa can be found 
surrounding the membrane propria. The 
granulosa cells form a thin layer around a 
fluid-filled cavity and a stalk of cells connects 
the oocyte to the sides of the follicle. The 
oocyte itself is surrounded by a layer of 
granulosa cells forming the cumulus.
Figure 12.4 Development of the female gametes. The female gametes develop by a very different process to the
male ones. There are a limited number of follicles, containing an oocyte, present in each female at birth. This results
in a ﬁnite number of cells that can be fertilised. Indeed, only a limited number of follicles ever mature to the point
where the oocyte is released.
Reproduction 251

surface of the ovary. The epithelial layer that
separates the follicle from the abdomen starts to
thin and degenerate. Ovulation results from the
rupture of this layer. The ﬂuid and cells support-
ing the oocyte leak out of the ovary and bring
with them the oocyte, surrounded by cumulus
cells.
In humans, the surface of the ovary is directly
exposed to the peritoneal cavity. The ovary is swept
up into the fallopian tubes by the ﬁmbriae and
transported towards the uterus for fertilisation.
The remainder of the follicle in the ovary collapses
and becomes engorged by a blood clot to form the
corpus luteum.
Corpus luteum
The corpus luteum is approximately 1.5–2.5 cm in
diameter, and forms from the remainder of the
follicle not released during ovulation. It functions
transiently as an endocrine organ to support the
embryo:
. The granulosa cells secrete progesterone under
the inﬂuence of LH, which stimulates prolifera-
tion of the uterine endometrium, to prepare it for
implantation.
. The theca interna cells secrete oestrogen to
maintain the mucosa of the female reproductive
tract.
Progesterone production by the corpus luteum
is regulated by LH secretion from the anterior
pituitary. Without continued LH, the corpus
luteum degenerates after 12–14 days, and produc-
tion of oestrogen and progesterone ceases. This
cessation secretion results in the collapse of the
endometrium and the onset of menstruation. The
degenerated corpus luteum forms the corpus
albicans, which has no function.
If implantation of a fertilised ovum occurs, the
uterine cycle becomes interrupted. The developing
placenta begins to secrete hCG, which has an
analogous function to LH, maintaining the viabil-
ity of the corpus luteum until around week 12 of
pregnancy. After week 12, the placenta takes over
the secretion of oestrogen and progesterone, and
the corpus luteum regresses.
Atresic follicles
Follicular development may cease at any stage,
which could reﬂect the fact that only the most
viable follicles develop to ovulation. The precise
appearance of atresic follicles varies enormously,
depending on stage of development before atresia
occurs, developing into a collagenous structure
known as a corpus ﬁbrosum.
Menstruation
The menstrual cycle is the series of cyclic hor-
monal changes that regulate the development of
follicles and the uterus, to coordinate them for
release and implantation of a fertilised oocyte
(Fig. 12.5). The menstrual cycle can be divided
into four phases:
1 Menstruation
2 Follicular phase
3 Ovulatory phase
4 Luteal phase.
The development of each group of follicles takes
about 3 months, whereas development of the uter-
ine lining occurs in a monthly cycle. There are four
hormones that regulate each other’s secretion and
control the menstrual cycle (Fig. 12.6).
Menstruation
The ﬁrst day of menstruation deﬁnes the ﬁrst day
of the menstrual cycle. The decrease in proges-
terone secretion, following degeneration of the
corpus luteum, results in the shedding of the
endometrial lining of the womb.
Follicular phase
The follicular phase (and, thus, the whole men-
strual cycle) starts on the ﬁrst day of menstruation,
when the levels of oestrogen, progesterone and
inhibin all fall after collapse of the corpus luteum.
The absence of these luteal hormones promotes an
increase in FSH, and then LH, levels, which stimu-
lates the antral growth in the follicles; this results in
release of oestrogen and progesterone. In the uter-
us, the oestrogen released by the new cohort of
follicles stimulates the generation of the endome-
trium and also promotes generation of mucus in
the cervix.
252
Reproduction

DEFINITION Inhibin
Inhibin is a hormone produced by the granulosa of
ovarian follicles in women and by Sertoli cells in
men. It is of particular importance in suppressing
FSH secretion and is regulated by GnRH, which
suppresses secretion, whereas insulin growth fac-
tor 1 (IGF-1) promotes inhibin secretion. Decrease
in inhibin secretion after collapse of the corpus
luteum promotes a rise in FSH levels to stimulate
follicular development.
Ovulatory phase
In the ovulatory phase the production of FSH and
LH is triggered by the positive feedback of proges-
terone and oestrogen, leading to a surge in the
concentration of both hormones, which triggers
ovulation.
Luteal phase
Afrer ovulation the luteal phase occurs, when
androgen and oestrogen production falls. The
phase is characterised by a gradual increase in
progesterone, which peaks around 8 days after
the LH surge. Progesterone inhibits LH and FSH
production, suppressing the development of the
antral follicles, and acts on the uterus, triggering
a change in the endometrium so that it can
accept a fertilised egg for implantation. Should
implantation occur, the release for hCG from the
embryo maintains the corpus luteum, halting
the menstrual cycle. Otherwise, the corpus lu-
teum
rapidly
degenerates
and
menstruation
starts.

Figure 12.5 The hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle. The four phases of the menstrual cycle are
regulated by the varying secretions of the sex hormones. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising
hormone (LH) are responsible for regulating the development of the follicles, and the marked ‘spike’ in concentration
is crucial for triggering rupture of the Graaﬁan follicle and release of the oocyte. After ovulation, the production of
progesterone is responsible for promoting preparation of the endometrium in case fertilisation should occur. In the
absence of implantation, the corpus luteum degenerates and ceases to produce progesterone, triggering
breakdown of the endometrial lining and the onset of menstruation.

The release of gonadotrophin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus 
stimulates the secretion of luteinising hormone 
(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 
from the pituitary. These stimulate the 
secretion of oestrogen by the thecal cells of 
the granules, and inhibin by the granulosa 
cells. Both hormones inhibit LH and FSH 
release. However, close to ovulation oestrogen 
stimulates FSH and LH release to promote the 
maturation and release of the graafian follicle.
Following release of the oocyte, the 
predominant endocrine organ in the ovaries 
becomes the corpus luteum. This is 
stimulated to secrete progesterone and 
oestrogen by FSH and LH, which promotes 
development of the endometrium, while 
inhibiting the release of FSH and LH by 
actions on the pituitary and hypothalamus.
GnRH release from the hypothalamus 
stimulates LH and FSH release from the male 
pituitary, where they act on the Leydig and 
Sertoli cells, respectively, to stimulate their 
function. The release of testosterone from the 
Leydig cells acts on the hypothalamus and 
pituitary to negatively regulate GnRH, LH and 
FSH secretion.

Reproduction

Coitus
During coitus sperm are released into the female
reproductive tract. The process of coitus involves
physiological changes in both individuals.
Coital changes in the male
In the male the penis becomes erect as a result of
both physical and psychological stimuli. Three
nervous outﬂows inﬂuence erection:
1 The pelvic nerve carries parasympathetic ﬁbres.
2 The pudendal nerve is a somatic nerve.
3 The hypogastric nerve carries sympathetic
ﬁbres.
There are three processes culminating in the
release of semen:
Erection, largely mediated by parasympathetic
stimulation
Emission, mediated by sympathetic stimulation.
Ejaculation,
largely
controlled
by
somatic
stimulation.
Throughout this process there are simultaneous
changes in the rest of the body’s physiology. Heart
rate and blood pressure both increase. Just before
ejaculation, skin rashes may appear. At ejacula-
tion, the cardiovascular changes become more
pronounced and hyperventilation occurs.
Erection
Erection is achieved by the vasodilatation of
arterioles to allow ﬁlling with blood of the corpus
cavernosa of the penis. The parasympathetic stim-
ulation triggers dilatation of the vessel walls to
allow ﬁlling of the corpus cavernosa. This is further
augmented by closure of arteriovenous shunts to
divert blood into the sinus beds within the corpus
cavernosum. As a result of the increased pressure,
the venous vessels in the penis become com-
pressed, reducing venous outﬂow from the penis
and further promoting the erection.
Emission
Emission results from the contraction of the pros-
tate, seminal glands and vas deferens to release all
the components of semen into the urethra. As
ejaculation approaches, erection of the penis in-
creases and the circumference at the glans may
increase. The testes are also drawn into the peri-
neum and may enlarge due to vasoconstriction.
Ejaculation
Ejaculation is the ﬁnal release of sperm from the
urethra, as a result of contraction of the smooth
muscle of the urethra and the striated muscles
enclosing it. To prevent the release of semen into
the bladder, the sphincter at the entrance of the
bladder contracts.
Orgasm is associated with ejaculation and
releases sexual tension and arousal, resulting in
a feeling of intense sexual pleasure. After ejacula-
tion the man enters an absolute refractory phase
where re-arousal and orgasm are impossible. This
is accompanied by loss of erection due to the
decline in vasodilatation.
Coital changes in the female
Many of the changes seen in the man during coitus
are mirrored in the women. Tactile and psycho-
logical stimulation reinforce frictional stimulation
provided by the movement of the penis against
the walls of the vagina and the external genitalia. A
vascular response is evoked causing engorgement
of the cavernous tissue in the clitoris. Furthermore,
the vagina and labia become engorged and expand.
Similar to men, women experience increases in
heart rate and blood pressure, as well as skin
ﬂushes. In addition, there are rhythmic contrac-
tions of the pelvic muscle. After orgasm, clitoral
erection is lost, and the uterine and vaginal walls
relax to their original positions. Women do not
generally experience an absolute refractory phase
and can therefore be repeatedly aroused.
During coitus, semen is ejaculated into the va-
gina. The semen rapidly coagulates immediately
after deposition, as a result of the interaction of
prostatic enzymes with various components of
the seminal vesicle secretion. This process is
thought to aid retention of the sperm in the vagina
and protect against the vagina’s acidic environ-
ment. In normal circumstances the coagulum
rapidly dissolves after around 20 min through
the activation of proenzymes excreted in the
semen.
Fertilisation
Fertilisation is the process where the two haploid
germ cells – the sperm and the ovum – fuse to form
a diploid zygote.
This can be divided into four stages:
Reproduction 255

1 Motility
2 Activation
3 Acrosome reaction
4 Meiosis and fusion.
Motility
The ovum and sperm must meet in the female
reproductive tract so that fertilisation can occur:
. Ovum: at the time of ovulation the ciliated
ﬁmbria at the end of the fallopian tube transport
the cumulus oophorus into the oviduct. The
cumulus oophorus is then transported down
the fallopian tubes to the ampullary–isthmic
junction where it remains for 1–2 days, and
where fertilisation takes place.
. Sperm: approximately 250 million sperm are
released into the vagina at ejaculation. Only
about 50 of these will reach the oviduct. Sperm
motility depends on ﬂagellar movement, which
is helped by the increased ﬂuidity of cervical ﬂuid
around the time of ovulation. Ideally sperm
should reach the ampullary–isthmic junction at
the time of ovulation, but they can remain at the
isthmus for several days.
Activation ( 'capacitation')
Sperm are capable of fertilisation only when they
have been exposed to the female tract. Interaction
with the female tract triggers a series of changes in
the sperm membrane that increase its afﬁnity for
the zona pellucida, and may also increase its
motility.
Acrosome reaction
The sperm penetrates the cells of the cumulus
oophorus to reach the zona pellucida. The head
of the sperm binds to the zona pellucida glycopro-
tein ZP3, stimulating the acrosome reaction. The
release of the contents of the acrosome causes an
increase in extracellular calcium and release of
proteins from granules in the oocyte, which
hardens the zona pellucida to prevent a second
fertilisation of the egg (polyspermy).
Meiosis and fusion
Fusion of the sperm with the oocyte membrane
triggers the second stage of meiosis in the oocyte,
resulting in formation of a mature oocyte and
second polar body. The second polar body is
extruded from the egg and a haploid number of
chromosomes is present in both the egg and sperm
pronuclei. The two pronuclei fuse to form the
zygote.
CLINICAL Ectopic pregnancy
An ectopic pregnancy is one that occurs outside
the uterus. This is usually in the fallopian tubes, and
occurs when there is a delay in the progress of the
ovum from the fallopian tubes to the uterus. As the
muscular walls of the fallopian tube are not adapted
for embryonic growth, the trophoblast gradually
erodes the tubal wall, resulting in damage to blood
vessels. Tubal rupture may occur, resulting in intra-
peritoneal haemorrhage from erosion of an artery.
This is a clinical emergency.
Ectopic pregnancies may be absorbed naturally,
or tubal abortion may occur (where the products
of conception are expelled from the tube into the
peritoneal cavity). Ectopic pregnancies may also
occur in the ovary or cervix. Very rarely they may
occur in the abdominal cavity, and this can occa-
sionally proceed to a full-term pregnancy.
DEFINITION Zygote
The zygote is the cell formed by the fusion of the
male and female haploid pronuclei, generating
a single diploid cell. It is the cell from which all
structures in the embryo and placenta are derived,
and has the potential to differentiate into any tissue.
It is totipotent.
Implantation
Initial divisions of the zygote occur in the fallopian
tube. The embryo enters the uterine cavity as
a morula (16–64 cells) on days 3–4. At this stage
the embryo has differentiated into two different
groups of cells: an outer cell mass and an inner cell
mass. The inner cell mass is called the embryo-
blast; it gives rise to the embryo and the amnion.
The outer cell mass is called the trophoblast and is
the main source of placenta; on days 5–6 a cavity
forms within the morula and it is now called
a blastocyst.
256
Reproduction

On day 7, the blastocyst implants on the
endometrial lining:
. Contact with the endometrium
causes the
trophoblast
at
the
embryonic
pole
to
differentiate into a syncytiotrophoblast and
a cytotrophoblast.
. The syncytiotrophoblast cells secrete proteolyt-
ic enzymes such as heparin sulphate, proteogly-
cans, integrins and selectins, which erode the
endometrium to allow implantation.
. Progesterone and hCG induce the differentia-
tion of endometrial epithelial cells into decidual
cells, the cells that line the uterus during
pregnancy.
. Corticotrophin-releasing
hormone
(CRH)
produced by the trophoblast also promotes
implantation, and may have a role in immune
tolerance in early pregnancy.
There are only 4 days (days 20–24) of the men-
strual cycle when the blastocyst is able to implant
into the endometrial lining of the uterus.
DEFINITION Syncytiotrophoblast
The syncytiotrophoblast is made up of many fused
cells containing many nuclei. This component of
the placenta secretes hCG in the early stages of
pregnancy to maintain the corpus luteum. In addi-
tion, it contributes to the chorionic villi, which allow
nutrient
exchange
between
the
mother
and
fetus. Syncytiotrophoblast cells secrete proteolytic
enzymes to allow them to invade the uterine walls for
implantation.
DEFINITION Cytotrophoblast
The cytotrophoblast is the precursor layer to the
syncytiotrophoblast, and also makes up an interior
layer of the placenta. There cells contribute to the
placenta, playing a role in nutrient exchange and
also releasing CRH.
The placenta
The placenta is developed from trophoblast tissue
(Fig. 12.7). Lacunar spaces that are in immediate
contact with the maternal circulation form in the
syncytiotrophoblast. Within the lacunar spaces,
chorionic villi develop – these provide a large
surface area for nutrient and gas exchange. The
villi are bathed in maternal blood. The placenta has
three main roles:
1 Exchange: transport of nutrients and oxygen
from the mother to the fetus, and removal of
waste products from the fetus into the maternal
bloodstream. There is exchange of gases and
molecules, but not of cells.
2 Endocrine: hormone synthesis, transport and
metabolism.
3 Immune: the placenta acts to prevent immuno-
logical rejection of the fetus (which is an
allograft), possibly via secretion of hCG.
Pregnancy
The maintenance of pregnancy and the process of
parturition (birth) depend on complex maternal–
placental–fetal interactions. The structural devel-
opment of the fetus, which occurs particularly
during the ﬁrst trimester, is discussed in detail in
Chapter 13. The main hormones regulating preg-
nancy are progesterone, oestrogen, hCG and
human placental lactogen (hPL).
Hormonal regulation of pregnancy
Many hormones are involved in regulating the
growth of the fetus and placenta, as well as trig-
gering changes in the maternal body to support the
fetus during its growth and shortly after birth.
Progesterone
In the ﬁrst 6–8 weeks of pregnancy the corpus
luteum is the main source of progesterone; after
8 weeks the developing trophoblast takes over, and
levels increase throughout pregnancy. Progester-
one acts to:
. inhibit smooth muscle contractility and thus
prevent uterine contraction
. inhibit prostaglandin (PG) formation, which is
thought to be involved in parturition
. stimulate maternal appetite and alter the de-
position of fat reserves
. inhibit oxytocin release and downregulate oxy-
tocin receptor expression on uterine muscle,
preventing parturition.
Reproduction 257

Oestrogen
Levelsofoestrogenincreasethroughoutpregnancy.
The corpus luteum is the primary source of
oestrogen during the ﬁrst few weeks. After this the
fetoplacental unit is responsible for the production
of oestrogen, because neither the fetus nor the
placenta expresses all the enzymes necessary for
oestrogen production:
. The fetal adrenals synthesise dehydroepiandros-
terone sulphate (DHEA-S) from cholesterol.
. The fetal liver hydroxylates DHEA-S which
passes to the placenta as 16a-OH-DHEA-S.
. The placenta processes 16a-OH-DHEA-S into
oestrogen.
Oestrogen acts to:
. stimulate uterine growth
. stimulate prostaglandin synthesis
. thicken the vaginal epithelium
. stimulate growth and development of mammary
epithelium
. inhibit milk production.
Human chorionic gonadotrophin
This hormone is a glycoprotein hormone, similar
to LH in structure and action, binding to the LH
receptor. It is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast
into the fetal and maternal circulations. Levels are
high in early pregnancy (hCG is used in pregnancy
tests and levels can be detected 6–8 days after
ovulation) peaking at 9 weeks, then declining.
Human chorionic gonadotrophin acts to:
. maintain the corpus luteum in early pregnancy
to ensure production of progesterone until the
placenta takes over
. regulate testosterone production in fetal Leydig
cells in the male fetus, which is important for
fetal development.
Human placental lactogen
HPL is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the
syncytiotrophoblast. Levels increase throughout
pregnancy triggering changes related to milk pro-
duction. It acts to:
Umbilical artery
Umbilical vein
Umbilical cord
Amnion
Chorion
Chorionic villi
Lacunar space
Decidua
Myometrium
Uterine artery

Figure 12.7 The structure of the placenta. The placenta forms an interface for exchange between the mother
and fetus. In particular the placenta invades the uterine tissue and projects chorionic villi into the lacunar spaces of
the endometrial tissue. These spaces form in response to the placental formation and bathe the chorionic villi
in maternal blood, allowing exchange by diffusion. The lacunar spaces receive blood from the uterine vessels,
which supply the myometrium.
258
Reproduction

. stimulate lipolysis, increasing availability of
circulating free fatty acids
. inhibit glucose uptake in the mother
. inhibit gluconeogenesis in the mother; this
favours transport of glucose and protein to the
fetus.
Growth of the fetus during
pregnancy
The development of the major structures in the
fetus occurs early in development and is discussed
in Chapter 13. The growth and development of
the fetus can be in three 3-month phases or
‘trimesters’:
1 The ﬁrst trimester starts with implantation of
the embryo. During this phase, the growth and
development of structures in the embryo are
extremely rapid. Miscarriages are most common
during the ﬁrst trimester.
2 The second trimester occurs from month 4 to
month 6 and is associated with growth and
weight gain of the fetus. In addition, movement
by the fetus in the womb may be detectable.
3 Duringthethirdtrimesterthefetusgainsweight
and the ﬁnal development of the organ systems
occurs to prepare for birth.
Parturition
During pregnancy, the myometrium of the uterus
is inactive. At parturition, many factors act togeth-
er to cause coordinated contraction of the myo-
metrium, and remodelling and softening of the
cervix. The control of parturition in humans is not
well understood, although a number of contribut-
ing processes have been identiﬁed:
. The levels of prostaglandins in the uterus rise;
this occurs before the onset of clinical labour and
is thought to have a role in stimulating myome-
trial contractility.
. Other inﬂammatory mediators such as neutro-
phils and macrophages inﬁltrate the human
myometrium – they may increase prostaglandin
production and also facilitate tissue remodelling.
. Gap junctions form between the myometrial
cells so that there is rapid spread of contraction.
. Oxytocin stimulates myometrial contraction. At
term, oxyntinergic cells in the hypothalamus ﬁre
synchronously and oxytocin receptors in the
myometrium increase.
. Relaxin and prostaglandins act to soften the
uterine cervix.
CLINICAL Eclampsia and pre-eclampsia
Eclampsia is characterised by epileptiform ﬁts
and hypertension during pregancy. The patient
develops cerebral ischaemia, leading to ﬁts, as a
result of cerebral oedema, vasoconstriction and
hypoxia. Maternal mortality is rare but the fetus may
die during the ﬁt, or as a result of hypoxia or pre-term
birth.
Pre-eclampsia generally precedes eclampsia
and is deﬁned as a blood pressure of more than
160/110 mmHg and the presence of proteinuria. It
usually presents in the third trimester.
Lactation
After birth the mother produces milk to feed the
newborn baby. Milk is produced by the breast and
performs different functions at different points;
initially it has a primarily protective function,
although later its function is nutritional.
Structure of the developed breast
The developed mammary gland is made up of
a lobed mass of glandular and ductile tissue. There
are two type of duct found in the breast:
1 The lactiferous ducts are made up of a series of
ducts that converge at the areola. These ducts
open on to the surface of the breasts at the nipple
and expel milk for ingestion by the infant.
2 The Montgomery glands open on to the areola
and secrete lubricating ﬂuids during suckling.
The lactiferous ducts
The human breast is typically made up of 15–20
lobes; these contain lobules of milk-secreting
alveoli draining into the lactiferous ducts which
carry the milk to the nipple. The walls of the alveoli
are made up of the single layer of epithelial cells,
which synthesise milk and secrete it into the
lumen. The alveoli are surrounded by a basement
Reproduction 259

membrane and myoepithelial cells which con-
tract to drive the milk into the ducts for ejection.
Development of breasts
The tissue of the breast is minimal at birth, con-
sisting of very few lactiferous ducts. The breasts
develop during puberty and then further during
pregnancy, when they become functional and
begin to produce milk for the ﬁrst time.
Changes of the breast during puberty
At puberty, oestrogen stimulates the duct tissue to
divide and develop functional alveoli. As menstrual
cycles continue, the secretion of oestrogen and
progesterone triggers further breast tissue devel-
opment and promotes the growth of connective
tissue and the deposition of fat. The ductal tissue
also develops in response to corticosteroids.
Breast development during
pregnancy
During pregnancy, development of the breast is
stimulated under the control of a number of
hormones. During early pregnancy, estradiol and
progesterone act to mature the lactiferous glands
and ducts. The breasts then develop the capacity to
produce milk for the ﬁrst time, providing nutrition
to the newborn child. This is stimulated by pro-
lactin, human placental lactogen (hPL), oestrogen,
progesterone, insulin and glucocorticoids.
Milk
Synthesis of milk
In the last part of pregnancy hPL and prolactin
stimulate milk. However, secretion of milk by the
alveolar cells does not occur due to the inhibitory
activity of progesterone and oestrogen. Milk fat is
produced in the smooth ER of the alveolar epithe-
lium, and develops into droplets in the cytoplasm,
which move towards the luminal surface of the cell.
Milk protein passes through the Golgi apparatus
and is secreted by exocytosis. As the droplet moves
towards the surface of the cell, it ‘pinches off’ as
a membrane-bound droplet.
The composition of milk varies:
. Initially, colostrum is produced. This contains
high amounts of proteins, in particular antibo-
dies to provide protection before the infant’s
immune system develops.
. The composition of milk transitions during
the ﬁrst 2–3 weeks postpartum. Its production
of proteins and antibodies decreases whereas
nutrients in the milk, in particular lactose and
fats, increase.
Prolactin
Prolactin is a peptide hormone produced by the
anterior pituitary; it is primarily regulated by the
release of dopamine, an inhibitory signal, from
the hypothalamus. The main effect of prolactin is
to stimulate milk production from the breast.
Prolactin secretion increases during pregnancy,
although milk is not released due to the inhibitory
effects of progesterone. After birth, the levels of
progesterone decrease to allow milk release. After
parturition, levels of progesterone and oestrogen
fall due to the loss of the placenta; continued milk
production is due to high levels of prolactin which
is stimulated by suckling.
Milk ejection
The milk ejection reﬂex (MER) moves milk from
the glands to the surface of the nipple for ingestion:
. Stimulation of the nipple and the sensation of
suckling are the most potent triggers of milk
ejection. The sound of a baby crying can also act
as a stimulus.
. The various stimuli are integrated by the
hypothalamic neurons, which trigger oxytocin
release.
. Oxytocin acts on the mammary glands to cause
contraction of the myoepithelial cells that sur-
round the alveoli. This results in expulsion of
the milk into the ducts beneath the nipple and
a build-up of intramammary pressure.
The suckling stimulus also reduces the pulsatile
releaseofGnRH,whichcontrolsovulation,fromthe
hypothalamus, reducing the potential for a second
pregnancy. However, it is still possible for a woman
to get pregnant while she is breastfeeding.
Age and reproductive
capacity
There is a limited period of time during which
individuals are fertile; this fertile period starts
260
Reproduction

with puberty, although towards the end of life
fertility decreases. In women this cessation of
fertility is determined by the menopause – the
cessation of the menstrual cycle. In men, there
appears to be some decrease in fertility with age,
although it is not deﬁned, nor as deﬁnitive as the
menopause.
Women
The fertility of a woman begins and ends with
deﬁned events:
. The menarche – the ﬁrst uterine cycle – which
implies that a full oocyte development may
also have occurred. Early menstrual cycles
are not entirely regulated, often not associated
with ovulation and have a shortened luteal
phase.
. The menopause is the point at which menstrual
cycles and ovarian function ceases, altogether
typically occurring in the early 50s. The meno-
pause is associated with mood changes, irrita-
bility, loss of libido and hot ﬂushes, as a result of
reduced sex hormones.
The fertility of a woman is highest in her early 20s
and decreases gradually as she ages. This is
thought to be associated with an increased risk of
failed ovulation.
Men
Sperm can be continually produced by men into
later life, although loss of libido and impotence do
increase with age. Much of this is thought to be the
result of other age-related factors and not directly
through failure of the reproductive system.
Control of fertility
Sex has a role in society other than for reproduc-
tion. Mechanisms have been developed to reduce
the potential for conception as a result of sexual
intercourse. Three broad mechanisms of control-
ling fertility have been developed, although their
acceptance in different societies varies, as does
their effectiveness:
1 Contraception
2 Abortion
3 Sterilisation.
Contraception
Contraception is the prevention of fertilisation.
This can be achieved by many different means:
preventing ovulation, preventing the sperm from
reaching the egg by altering cervical mucus or
preventing the sperm from entering the uterus.
The main methods of contraception are:
. barrier protection
. hormonal control
. intrauterine devices
. natural rhythm method.
Barrier contraception
Barrier methods physically prevent the sperm
from getting through the cervix. They also protect
against sexually transmitted infections:
. The male condom is a sheath (normally latex)
which can be ﬁtted onto the erect penis. If used
correctly, around 3 pregnancies may result per
100 women per year.
. The female condom is a sheath that ﬁts inside
the vagina; failure rates are similar to a condom
and it is less acceptable to females.
. Diaphragms and caps are inserted just before
intercourse and ﬁt over the cervix. A dia-
phragm, also known as a Dutch cap, is a ﬂexible
latex dome with a spring, which is held between
the pubic bone and the sacral curve, covering
the cervix. A cervical cap also ﬁts over the
cervix.
. Spermicidal gels are often used with caps and
diaphragms to increase their success.
Hormonal contraceptives
These are contraceptives that use progestogen
and/or oestrogen to create an artiﬁcial hormonal
environment to prevent ovulation. The different
types of hormonal contraceptive are:
. the combined oral contraceptive (COC)
. progesterone-releasing contraceptives.
The combined oral contraceptive ( 'the pill')
This contains oestrogen and progestogen, which
negatively feed back on gonadotrophin release
from the pituitary, inhibiting ovulation. The direct
action of oestrogen and progesterone on the uterus
causes the endometrium to atrophy and alters the
Reproduction 261

cervical mucus, inhibiting the entry of sperm. The
pill is extremely effective if used correctly.
Normally, the pill is taken daily for 21 days at
approximately the same time each day. There is
then a 7-day break, when there is a ‘withdrawal
bleed’ (similar to a period) due to the withdrawal of
progestogen. Most women ﬁnd this reassuring to
know that they are not pregnant, even though it is
not a proper period. If a woman misses a pill by less
than 24 hours, the last missed pill should be taken
and the remaining tablets continued; she still has
contraceptive protection. If a woman misses a pill
by more than 24 hours, the last missed pill should
be taken and the packet ﬁnished as usual. How-
ever, she is no longer protected and should use
another form of contraception for the next 7 days.
Moreover, if there were fewer than seven pills left,
the next packet should be started without a break.
The pill also has non-contraceptive beneﬁts in-
cluding regular, lighter and less painful periods.
Minor side effects include weight gain, nausea,
headaches and breast tenderness. There may be
breakthrough bleeding in the ﬁrst month of taking.
Major side effects are very rare. The most impor-
tant are venous thrombosis and myocardial infarc-
tion; the risk of these increases with increased age
and smoking. Others include thromboembolic dis-
ease, and increased risk of liver, cervical and breast
cancer. The pill is contraindicated in anyone with
ahistoryofanyofthemajorsideeffectslistedabove,
and in smokers aged more than 35 years.
Progestogens
Progestogens cause the cervical mucus to become
hostile, and also prevent ovulation. In most women
menstruation also ceases. Progestogens can be
given in a number of forms:
. The progestogen-only pill (mini-pill) is taken at
the same time of day, each and every day. If a pill
is taken more than 3 hours late, it is necessary to
use another form of contraception for 7 days.
. Depot contraception can be given by injection
every 3 months – progestogens are released slow-
ly, bypassing the portal circulation.
. Implanon is a single 6-cm rod containing
progestogen, which is inserted subdermally in
the upper arm using local anaesthetic. It lasts for
3 years.
. Progesterone-containing intrauterine devices
(IUDs) – discussed below.
Side effects of progestogens include vaginal
spotting, weight gain, mastalgia and premenstrual
like symptoms. They do not have any of the contra-
indications associated with the COC.
Intrauterine devices
These devices are inserted into the uterine cavity in
an outpatient setting and can be left in place for up
to 5 years. Thin strings hang down from the open-
ing of the cervix, which allow the woman to
check that the IUD is still in place. IUDs are very
effective forms of contraception, resulting in less
than 0.5 preganancies per 100 women per year.
. Copper-containing
devices
are
normally
T-shaped and the copper has a toxic effect on
sperm
which
prevents
fertilisation.
Copper
devices can cause increased menstrual loss,
more painful bleeding and increased risk of
ectopic pregnancy (if pregnancy occurs).
. Intrauterine system (IUS): the Mirena coil is a
T-shaped device containing progestogen that is
released gradually over 5 years. It has progesto-
genic side effects. However, it decreases blood
loss and painful periods.
Natural contraception
The theory behind natural contraception is that a
couple will abstain from intercourse during a
woman’s fertile period, i.e. around ovulation. This
is judged by changes in basal body temperature,
cervical mucus and the cervix, and there are com-
mercially available kits to detect these changes.
However, failure rates are high because couples fail
to abstain and as a result of inaccuracies in the
mechanisms used to predict ovulation.
Therapeutic abortion
Therapeutic abortion is the medical termination of
pregnancy – as opposed to a spontaneous abor-
tion, known as a miscarriage. This is usually per-
formed before the age at which the fetus is able to
survive outside the womb, which is considered to
be 24 weeks. In the UK, abortion is essentially
offered ‘on demand’, although this is a contentious
issue.
Surgical abortion
The patient is put under a general anaesthetic. The
neck of the cervix is dilated and a small catheter
inserted through the cervix. Suction is used to
remove the fetal tissue from the uterus.
262
Reproduction

Medical abortion
Mifepristone, a drug that blocks progestogen
receptors in the uterus, is given; 48 hours later
a vaginal pessary of prostaglandins is given. As
progesterone acts to inhibit smooth muscle con-
tractility and decrease prostaglandin production,
keeping the uterus quiescent, antagonism of the
progestogen receptors removes this effect. The
products of conception are passed as they would
be during a spontaneous abortion. Ten per cent of
midtrimester medical abortions require subse-
quent surgical evacuation.
Sterilisation
Sterilisation is generally regarded as an irreversible
procedure and should be 100% effective.
Inmensterilisationisthroughligationorremoval
ofasectionofvasdeferens–avasectomy.Asaresult
the ejaculate produced rapidly becomes aspermic.
There are potential side effects of vasectomy as
a result of the continuing build-up of sperm, as the
seminiferous tubules remain effective:
. The build-up of sperm and ﬂuid can cause
chronic or periodic tenderness in the testes.
. Leakage of sperm antigens into the circulation
may trigger an immune response. This can result
in infertility even if the vasectomy is reversed.
In women, sterilisation is achieved through li-
gation or removal (either part or all) of the fallopian
tubes. This is a much more major procedure than
a vasectomy, requiring a general anaesthetic. Tub-
al ligation is, in most cases, reversible. Sterilisation
may also be achieved through a hysterectomy –
removal of the uterus.
Assisted conception
Thereareanumberofreasonswhyacouplemaynot
beable to reproduce. These can bebest understood
by looking at the requirements for conception:
. An egg must be produced. – the woman may
not ovulate.
. The sperm must have adequate function. –
sperm can have decreased motility, be abnormal
in form or not be present (azoospermia).
. The sperm must reach the egg. – the fallopian
tubes can be damaged, or there can be problems
with
the
cervix
or
the
mechanical
act
of
intercourse.
. The fertilised egg must implant. – there can be
problems with the uterus.
There are a number of options for assisted
conception depending on what the problem is.
The current methods are:
. in vitro fertilisation (IVF)
. intrauterine insemination
. intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
Assisted conception is often unavailable on the
NHS and is very expensive. Other options are egg
donation, surrogacy and adoption.
In vitro fertilisation
This is useful when there is anovulation or tubal
blockage. Endogenous LH and FSH production is
abolished and ovulation is induced with exoge-
nous gonadotrophins. The eggs are then removed
from the ovaries under ultrasound and incubated
with paternal sperm. The embryo is transferred to
the uterus 3–5 days later, and progesterone and
hCG given to support the pregnancy for the ﬁrst 10
weeks. The live birth rate is approximately 25%;
more than one embryo may be transferred to the
womb to increase the chance of implantation,
although this increases the potential for multiple
pregnancies.
Intrauterine insemination
As in IVF, ovulation is stimulated with exogenous
hormones. A semen sample is taken and the
best quality sperm are selected in a laboratory. The
sperm are then placed in the uterus at the time of
ovulation. Intrauterine insemination is often per-
formed when there are moderate abnormalities of
sperm, or when the cause of infertility is unknown.
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection
When there is male infertility with abnormal or
immotile sperm, intracytoplasmic sperm injection
may allow conception. Sperm is extracted from
the testis or epididymis, and injected directly into
the oocyte. The egg can then be implanted. The
success rate is 20% per cycle.

Embryology
Each individual is created from a single cell – the
zygote – formed by the fusion of an egg cell with a
sperm. The zygote divides and differentiates into all
the tissues in the body and the placenta. The
developmental programme is immensely complex
to allow for the formation of the many organs, some
of which must continue to develop while remaining
functional (Fig. 13.1). Four processes are crucial for
the correct development of the embryo: division,
differentiation, migration and apoptosis.
This chapter discusses the processes that follow
implantation of the embryo into the lining of the
uterus. The developmental process up to this
point, and the formation of the placenta, are cov-
ered in Chapter 12.
Concepts of embryology
Implantation occurs at around day 5. At this point
the embryo consists of a ring of cells, which con-
tains a clump at one point, and is known as the
blastocyst. From this structure, both the embryo
and the placenta develop. The blastocyst rapidly
grows to form the bilaminar germ disc – made up of
two layers of cells with a ﬂuid-ﬁlled cavity on each
side (Fig. 13.2).
The bilaminar germ disc develops into a three-
dimensional fetus. One of the crucial processes is
that of axis formation, whereby three axes are
generated in the embryo:
1 Rostrocaudal: head to tail
2 Dorsoventral: back to front
3 Left to right.
The ﬁrst crucial stage in axis formation occurs
with gastrulation. This provides the primitive
streak along the rostrocaudal (head-to-tail) axis,
and the primitive node is found at the rostral end,
which develops into the head.
Potency
The potency of a cell refers to its ability to generate
a range of tissues. In general the more differenti-
ated a cell, the less potency it has and the smaller
the range of cell types into which it is capable of
differentiating:
. A totipotent cell can give rise to all structures in
the embryo and placenta. Totipotent cells are
found only before formation of the blastocyst.
. A pluripotent cell is capable of dividing into any
cell. These embryonic stem cells are being inves-
tigated as a source of tissue for therapy.
. A multipotent cell is capable of dividing into
tissues in a related line of cells. Many adult stem
cells are multipotent, e.g. the haematopoietic
stem cell can generate all the blood cells, but
cannot contribute to nervous tissue.
. A unipotent cell is a fully differentiated cell,
although it may be capable of renewing itself
(e.g. the hepatocyte).
Formation of the amnion
and chorion
The ﬁrst signiﬁcant structure that consists purely
of embryonic (instead of placental) tissue is the
bilaminar germ disc. It develops from the prolif-
eration of both layers of the inner cell mass of the

Figure 13.1 During development of the embryo several processes must occur at the same time – to pattern the embryo and then allow the simultaneous development of all
the organ systems. The major features of the embryo develop in the ﬁrst 8 weeks whereas other parts of development, such as formation of the alveoli and ossiﬁcation of the
bones, may continue until well past birth.

Day 7
The blastocyst implants at day 7, where the 
syncytiotrophoblast develops in contact with the 
endometrium; it rapidly penetrates this layer which 
develops into the placenta. The blastocyst 
contains an inner mass of cells made up of two 
layers – the hypoblast develops into the yolk sacs 
and the epiblast develops into the structures of the 
embryo.
Day 9
By day 9, the embryo has fully implanted and the 
syncytiotrophoblast has developed spaces to 
allow the flow of maternal blood for exchange. The 
epiblast has proliferated and generated a small 
amniotic cavity that is rapidly filled with fluid, while 
the hypoblast proliferates around the edged of the 
cytotrophoblast.
Day 12
The cytotrophoblast has proliferated to form two 
layers of extraembryonic mesoderm surrounding a 
loose acellular tissue, while the hypoblast has 
completely coated the inner of the two layers to 
form the primary yolk sac.
Day 13
The extraembryonic mesoderm has grown to 
surround the chorionic cavity, while the embryo is 
suspended in the middle of this cavity by a 
connecting stalk of extraembryonic mesoderm. 
The primary yolk sac rapidly degenerates and 
further proliferation of the hypoblast leads to the 
formation of the definitive yolk sac. By this point 
the bilaminar germ disc is fully formed and the 
embryo ready to undergo gastrulation.
Figure 13.2 Immediately after implantation, the placenta develops to nourish the embryo and the important cavities
surrounding the embryo develop. These processes result in the formation of the bilaminar germ disc, deﬁnitive yolk
sac, and chorionic and amniotic cavities by the end of week 2.

Embryology

blastocyst, resulting in two layers of cell sur-
rounded on either side by ﬂuid-ﬁlled cavities
(Fig. 13.3):
1 The hypoblast forms the yolk sac.
2 The epiblast gives rise to the structures in the
embryo. It is the epiblast that undergoes
gastrulation.
Formation of the amnion
The amnion begins to form at around day 8. This
results from ﬂuid accumulating between the cells
of the epiblast. This cavity progressively grows
throughout the embryo’s development so that it
encloses the entire embryo by the end of the
second month. During this time it protects the
embryo and provides it with a space in which to
develop.
Formation of the chorion
The chorion is the cavity that develops to separate
the cytotrophoblast from the yolk sac. It forms
from the extraembryonic mesoderm cells arising
from the epiblast. Two layers of mesoderm are
separated by the extraembryonic reticulum, which
is a large region of acellular matter. This reticulum
then breaks down and ﬂuid progressively accumu-
lates between the layers to form the chorionic
cavity.
Formation of the yolk sac
The yolk sac has several important functions in
development:
. It gives rise to the germ cells that migrate into the
gonads.
. It is an early site of haematopoiesis.
. It
produces
some
serum
proteins
during
development.
. It may have some role in the early nutrition of the
embryo.
The yolk sac forms in two stages: there is pro-
duction of the primary yolk sac through the mi-
gration of hypoblast cells over the interior of the
cytotrophoblast. This is a transient structure that
begins to break down by day 13, as the deﬁnitive
yolk sac is produced by further proliferation from
the hypoblast.
The yolk sac is a developmental structure that, in
most cases, regresses before birth. However, it can
persist as Meckel’s diverticulum.
Gastrulation and
patterning
In gastrulation the bilaminar germ disc structure
develops into the three-layered trilaminar germ
disc. The cells in each layer are derived from the
epiblast, although they undergo different develop-
mental programmes and give rise to different tis-
sues. Gastrulation provides the ﬁrst gross sign of
orientation in the embryo.
Mechanism of gastrulation
. The bilaminar germ disc is fully formed by day
15, at which point a groove in the epiblast – the
primitive streak – develops. This midline struc-
ture consists of a long depression with a mound
of cells at the rostral end – the primitive mound.
The ﬁrst groups of cells that migrate differentiate
to form the deﬁnitive endoderm.
. Later, cells migrating through the primitive
streak migrate in between the endoderm and the
ectoderm to form the deﬁnitive mesoderm.
. The epiblast cells that do not migrate through the
primitive node develop into the ectoderm.
. The primitive streak regulates the development
of the different cell layers through the release of
signalling factors.
. Throughout most of the trilaminar germ disc the
three layers are found.
. At the extreme ends of the disc, the endoderm
and ectoderm are directly in contact; these sites
will form the ends of the gut tube.
The primitive streak rapidly disappears by the
middle of week 4.
Ectoderm
The ectoderm is the outermost layer of the embryo
and generates three major tissue groups:
1 Most of the ectoderm remains on the outside of
the embryo, and will give rise to the skin.
2 The ectoderm becomes folded during neurula-
tion and is responsible for forming the neural
tube which gives rises to the nervous tissues
within the body.
3 During neurulation, the ectoderm gives rise to
the neural crest cells, which contribute to spe-
cialised cells throughout the body, often those
involved in pigmentation (e.g. melanocytes).

Blastocyst
When the blastocyst implants into 
the uterine it rapidly forms the 
primitive structures of the 
placenta and embryo. The 
embryo develops from the 
bilaminar germ disc, which is 
found within the extraembryonic 
coelom, and is surrounded by the 
amniotic cavity and the primitive 
yolk sac.
Bilaminar
The bilaminar germ disc is made up of two layers 
of tissue, the hypoblast and the epiblast, both of 
which are derived from the embryoblast. The 
epiblast will generate all layers within the final 
trilaminar disc.
Gastrulation
During gastrulation a groove, the primitive streak, 
forms in the midline of the bilaminar disc. The 
cells of the epiblast proliferate and begin to 
migrate through the streak, where they replace 
the hypoblast to form the definitive endoderm. 
Later cells migrate into a space between the two 
layers and form the mesoderm.
Trilaminar disc
The trilaminar disc consists of the endoderm and 
mesoderm, which have formed from the cells that 
migrated through the primitive streak during 
gastrulation. The epiblast cells that do not migrate 
give rise to the ectoderm of the trilaminar disc. 
Although the endoderm and ectoderm are 
epithelial layers made of tightly apposed cells, the 
mesoderm is a mesenchymal cell layer made of 
cells suspended in an extracellular matrix.
Figure 13.3 The ﬁrst process in the embryo that demonstrates deﬁnite axes on a gross scale is gastrulation, by
which the bilaminar disc is converted to a trilaminar germ disc. The three resulting layers have different
developmental fates, each giving rise to speciﬁc lineages of tissue in the embryo.
268
Embryology

Mesoderm
The mesoderm is the middle, non-epithelial, lay-
er of the trilaminar germ disc; it forms much
of the connective tissue. Through the various
patterning that follows, the mesoderm becomes
segmented, giving rise to the bones and muscles
as well as the tissue of the internal organs.
Although the epithelial layers are often endo-
or ectodermally derived, the remainder of the
organs are mesodermal in origin. Unlike the en-
doderm and ectoderm, the mesoderm is found in
its own extracellular matrix and is not tightly
apposed. This arrangement of cells is known as
a mesenchyme.
Endoderm
The endoderm is the innermost cell layer in the
embryo and is continuous with the yolk sac. Sim-
ilar to the ectoderm it is an epithelial layer and will
go on to generate the gut and related structures,
including the lungs and biliary tree.
Neurulation
The spinal cord is the major structure that forms
along the rostrocaudal axis. Developmentally,
the vertebrae are derived from the mesoderm,
although the cells that go on to form the spinal
cord itself are derived from the ectoderm. This
‘inside-out’ structure is formed in neurulation
(Fig. 13.4):
. Formation of the notochord.
. Development of the neural plate.
. Folding of the neural plate into the neural
tube.
Formation of the notochord
Generation of the notochord is regulated by the
primitive streak. As the primitive streak regresses,
the primitive node migrates rostrally, and cells
proliferating in this region form the hollow noto-
chord. By day 20, this hollow tube structure is
completely formed and begins to remodel itself
into a solid rod in the mesoderm:
. The ventral surface of the tube fuses with the
endoderm, and then opens ventrally to form a
ﬂat bar of tissue in the midline – the notochordal
plate.
. The plate detaches from the endoderm at the
start of week 4 and becomes located within the
endoderm and develops into a more cylindrical
shape.
The notochord is thought to develop into the
nucleus pulposus, located within the centre of the
intervertebral discs.
Development of the neural plate
The neural plate is a thickened layer of ectoderm
cells that forms in response to signalling factors
released by the notochord and the underlying
mesoderm. As with the other patterning mechan-
isms discussed so far, the neural plate starts toform
at the rostral end of the embryo and migrates
caudally. The neural plate starts to develop from
the middle of week 4 of development and rapidly
becomes expanded at the cranial end, where it will
develop into the brain.
Folding of the neural plate
into the neural tube
The ﬁnal product of neurulation is the neural
tube which lies entirely within the mesoderm
along the rostrocaudal axis of the embryo. This
structure will give rise to the central nervous
system (CNS). The neural tube is crucial for the
segmental organisation of the embryo and reg-
ulates the development of many of the meso-
derm-derived structures found in the embryo.
Its formation from the neural plate occurs in a
series of steps:
1 The notochord acts as a hinge region for the
folding of the neural plate and governs the
process
through
the
release
of
signalling
factors.
2 The thickened neural plate tissue on either side
of the groove folds up and fuses to form the
neural tube.
3 Thesurfaceectodermalsofusesabovetheneural
tube, drawing the entire structure into the me-
soderm. The resulting tube remains open at the
rostral and caudal ends.
Neural tube closure is essential for proper for-
mation of the spinal cord and vertebrae and other
structures that surround it; failure of the neural
tube to close can lead to spina biﬁda.

Notochord 
During gastrulation, the primitive node at the head 
of the midline streak regresses caudally down the 
embryo. As this occurs, it signals to mesodermal 
tissue to proliferate and develop into a hollow tube – 
the notochordal process – which develops 
progressively along the length of the embryo. This 
tube briefly forms a plate on the endodermal 
surface before reorganising into the solid 
notochord in the mesodermal tissue.
Ectodermal proliferation
The notochord secretes signalling factors that 
stimulate the ectodermal tissue in the midline to 
proliferate and thicken to form the neural plate. 
Growth of the embryo stimulates folding along the 
rostrocaudal axis, which is hinged at the 
notochord and allows fusion of the neural plate 
along the midline.
Neural crest
As the neural plate folds to fuse, the cells at the 
interface between the neural plate and the 
ectoderm proper detach and migrate around the 
body; these neural crest cells give rise to many 
structures throughout the embryo. 
Neural tube
The folding of the neural plate leads to the edges 
of the neural plate fusing to form a cylinder through 
the midline – the neural tube. The neural tube 
remains open at both ends, although it migrates 
into the mesoderm of the embryo and will give rise 
to the structures of the central nervous system. In 
addition, the ectoderm fuses above the neural tube 
so that the ectoderm remains a continuous layer 
across the embryo’s surface.
Figure 13.4 Neurulation results in the development of the neural tube, which gives rise to the central nervous
system, and the neural crest, which gives rise to many structures throughout the embryo. Both these tissues are
derived from the ectoderm and form from a variety of complex folding reactions and signals, primarily regulated by
the notochord, a mesoderm-derived structure.

Embryology

CLINICAL Spina biﬁda
A failure of neurulation can lead to the neural tube
not closing completely. The defect may hinder the
development of tissue within the spinal cord and, in
severe cases, may be incompatible with life:
. Spina biﬁda occulta is the least serious defect
and often goes undetected (occurrence may be
as high as 10%). This is where there has been a
failure in the formation of the vertebrae, typically
resulting in the formation of a hemivertebra. This is
often associated with the presence of a tuft of hair
on the skin over the defect.
. Meningocele occurs where the neural tube has
not closed; the dura and arachnoid of the spinal
cord may protrude. This defect contains no neural
tissue and is usually relatively easily repaired.
. A meningomyeloceleis a seriousdefect,in which
neural tissue protrudes from the defect. If this
occurs in the cranial region, brain tissue may
protrude from the defect. These defects are often
not fatal; as a result of incomplete development,
there are likely to be long-term motor and mental
defects.
. Severe cases, in which the neural tube fails
completely to develop, are associated with
spontaneous abortion.
The neural crest
Those cells that exist at the interface of the ecto-
derm cells and future neural tube tissue develop
into the neural crest cells, which contribute in a
variety of manners to many different systems.
Neuronal tissue outside the CNS
Peripheral sensory neurons, which have cell bodies
within the dorsal root ganglia, can be:
. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons
. Postganglionic parasympathetic neurons
. Neurons in the lower part of the enteric nervous
system
. Sensory ganglia of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X
and XI.
Connective tissue structures
. Tissue in the spiral septum, which divides the
heart outﬂow tract into aortic and pulmonary
trunks
. Dermis of the head and neck
. Teeth
. Connective tissue of the head and neck glands,
including the lacrimal, pituitary, thyroid, para-
thyroid and salivary glands.
Other structures
. Calcitonin-secreting cells of the thyroid gland
(the C-cells)
. Chemoreceptor cells in the aortic and carotid
bodies
. Melanocytes.
CLINICAL Hirschsprung's disease
Hirschsprung’s disease (frequency approximately
1/5000 births) is characterised by an enlarged bow-
el segment, arising from the absence of peristalsis
in the more distal sections of bowel. This is a result of
the absence of migration of neural crest cells to the
gut, which contribute to the enteric nervous system.
The enteric nervous system regulates peristalsis
and other functions in the gut.
Segmentation in the
embryo
Many of the axial structures in the body are
organised in a segmental fashion, as illustrated
by the peripheral nerves that leave the spinal
cord regularly between the vertebrae. This seg-
mental organisation is seen in development,
particularly in the somites which form much of
the connective tissue structures in the body
(Fig. 13.5).
At the end of week 3, the paraxial mesoderm
coalesces to form a series of compact groups of
tissue on either side of the notochord, known as
somitomeres, which contribute to two major sets
of structures:
1 The seven most cranial somitomeres deve-
lop into the muscles found in the head and
neck.
2 The majority of the somitomeres develop into
42–44 pairs of somites which form more rapidly
at the cranial end of the embryo.
. Additional caudal somitomeres regress.

Mesoderm
The mesoderm differentiates into a series of 
regions, which give rise to different structures. The 
paraxial mesoderm will develop into the somites, 
which give rise to the vertebrae and much of the 
axial skeleton. The intermediate mesoderm 
contributes to the urogenital system. The lateral 
plate mesoderm of the embryo fuses in the 
midline, as a result of embryonic folding, and 
contributes to the body and gut walls.
Somitomeres
The paraxial mesoderm rapidly forms clusters 
arranged in pairs either side of the neural tube. 
These develop into hollow somites, which contain 
many mesenchymal cells in their interior. The 
somites rupture on their interior aspect and release 
the sclerotome.
Dermamyotome
The sclerotomal cells accumulate around the 
neural tube and develop into the vertebral body. 
The notochord becomes encased in the sclerotome 
and gives rise to the nucleus pulposus of the 
intervertebral discs. The remaining somite tissue 
coalesces into a band of tissue with each side of 
the future vertebral arch forming the dermamyo-
tome, which differentiates into the dermatome and 
the myotome. These give rise to the dermis of the 
back and lateral trunk, as well as the musculature 
of the axial skeleton. At the site of the limb buds, 
the myotome cells migrate into the limb bud to 
contribute to the future connective tissue.
Spinal nerve
The vertebral bodies develop from the sclerotome 
of two different somites. The rostral portion of each 
vertebral body is derived from its corresponding 
somite, while the caudal part is derived from a 
portion of the next somite. This splitting of the 
somites results from the migration of the spinal 
nerves, which must exit between the future 
vertebrae.

Figure 13.5 The mesoderm generates the connective tissue found in the embryo. It develops into different groups
of tissue which give rise to different systems and structures. In particular, the somites contribute to many of the axial
structures and, with the spinal nerves, give rise to the segmental organisation of the axial skeleton.
272
Embryology

The somites
The somites give rise to almost every structure in
the axial skeleton, as well as generating parts of the
overlying dermis. The somites can be classed into
ﬁve groups, travelling caudally along the embryo.
Each group gives rise to a different set of structures
(Table 13.1).
Cells in the somites also migrate to develop into
the limb muscles:
. The upper limb musculature is derived from the
cervical and thoracic somites.
. The lower limb musculature is derived from the
lumbar somites.
The development and differentiation
of the somites
The somites rapidly divide into speciﬁc compo-
nents. They form a hollow structure containing a
central core of cells, and start to open on their
medial side. Two main divisions of the somite can
be identiﬁed (Fig. 13.6):
. The sclerotome is made of the cells that migrate
to the notochord and neural tube and will de-
velop into the vertebrae.
. The dermamyotome is made up of the remain-
ing cells and rapidly differentiates into the der-
matome and the myotome.
The dermatome contributes to the dermis of the
neck, back and trunk, although most of the dermis
is developed from the lateral plate mesoderm.
The myotome develops into muscle structures,
aftertheirdivisionintotwodistinctgroupsoftissue:
. The epimere develops into the deep muscles of
the back.
. The hypomere develops into the lateral muscles,
such as the thoracic muscles.
Formation of the vertebrae
The vertebrae develop from the sclerotome of
two separate segments. The development of the
vertebrae occurs as the peripheral nerves migrate
out of the spinal cord:
. The vertebrae form intersegmentally, each be-
ing made up of elements from two somites.
. Between the vertebrae, the axial skeleton is sup-
ported by ﬁbrous intervertebral discs. Thecentre
of these discs is made up of the jelly-like nucleus
pulposus, derived from the notochord cells.
These cells become surrounded by sclerotomal
cells and develop into the annulus ﬁbrosus – the
tough outside layer of the intervertebral disc.
The development of the mesoderm
Although the paraxial mesoderm develops into the
somites, the remaining portion of mesoderm
forms many other structures. Two other groups of
mesoderm tissue have particular developmental
signiﬁcance:
1 Intermediate mesoderm is located close to the
somitesandgivesrisetothetissueformingmuch

Following neurulation, the embryo is a relatively flat 
structure. The lateral plate mesoderm, which will 
line the future body cavities, exists as two sheets 
at the extreme sides of the embryo – the 
somatopleure and the splanchnopleure. 
As the lateral sides of the embryo start to fold, the 
layers of the lateral plate mesoderm start to 
invaginate into the sides of the yolk sac. This 
process occurs as a result of the rostral and caudal 
folding of the embryo, as well as folding down the 
midline of the embryo, hinging at the neural tube 
and notochord. This folding progressively brings the 
edges of the lateral plate mesoderm on either side 
of the embryo together, as well as promoting the 
development of the gut tube from the endoderm.
After folding, the edges of the lateral plate 
mesoderm fuse such that the somatopleure lines 
the inside of the intraembryonic coelom, while the 
splanchnopleure lines the gut tube, which has 
formed from the endoderm. This structure remains 
entirely within the embryo, except at the point 
where it connects with the yolk sac, where the 
abdominal wall has not closed. Progressively, the 
abdominal wall closes such that the yolk sac 
becomes incorporated within the umbilical 
structures
Figure 13.6 The disc-like early embryo must develop into a three-dimensional structure. In this process the lateral
edges of the embryo must fuse with each other, generating the gut tube from the endoderm. In addition, the layers of
the lateral plate mesoderm fuse to form the tissue that lines both the interior of the abdominal cavity and the gut tube.
It is this tissue that gives rise to many of the connecting tissues within the abdomen.
274
Embryology

structure as a result of differential growth and
folding (Table 13.2). The process also converts the
ﬂat endoderm into the primitive gut tube:
. The trilaminar disc lengthens rapidly, although
the yolk sac does not, leading to folding at the
cephalic and rostral ends.
. The lateral edges of the embryo fold and fuse in
the midline to form the intraembryonic coelom.
Formation of the body cavities
All the major cavities in the body are derived from
the intraembryonic coelom. The peritoneal, peri-
cardial and pleural cavities form as a result of two
subdivisions:
1 The division of the intraembryonic coelom into
the abdominal and thoracic cavities occurs
through the rostral folding of the embryo,
which brings the septum transversum into po-
sition, dividing the two cavities.
2 The pericardium forms from the outgrowth of
foldsoftissue inthe lateralbodywall.Thesefolds
grow towards each other between the lungs
and heart. Upon fusing in week 5, they form
the pericardial cavity centrally and two pleural
cavities laterally, into which the lungs will
develop.
The development of the diaphragm
The diaphragm separates the thorax from the
abdomen. Developmentally, it prevents the intes-
tines from entering the thorax, affording the lungs
sufﬁcient space. Development of the diaphragm
occurs from week 5 to week 7, starting with the
caudal folding of the embryo. There are four origins
to the tissue in the diaphragm shown in Table 13.3.
Innervation of the diaphragm
The motor and sensory innervation of the dia-
phragm develops differently:
. Myoblasts migrate into the tissue at the level of
C3, -4 and -5, drawing their motor innervation
with them. The diaphragm continues to migrate

Patterning
The three axes of the limb bud must be patterned 
by the release of different signals. First, the 
proximal distal signals are the result of signalling 
between the ectoderm overlying the mesenchyme, 
in the apical ectodermal ridge, found along the tip 
of the limb bud. The rostral–caudal axis is 
patterned through the secretion of the morphogen 
sonic hedgehog (Shh) from the zone of polarising 
activity (ZPA). This high level of secretion from the 
ZPA results in the tissue differentiating into the 
more caudal structures – the fourth and fifth 
fingers. As the concentration of Shh decreases, the 
more rostral thumb and first finger form. Finally the 
dorsoventral axis is patterned through the 
secretions by the overlying epithelium.

It is thought that the length of time that cells spend 
close to the apical ectodermal ridge alters the 
structures into which they differentiate. The cells 
leaving the zone at a later point – as the limb has 
grown – result in the formation of more distal 
structures. Many different tissues types are found in 
the limb – as growth continues many tissues 
migrate in. The somatic mesoderm is recruited to 
give rise to the muscle and connective tissue 
structures in the limb, while the nerve cells migrate 
into the limb both to innervate the muscles and to 
provide sensory innervation.
Remodelling
After patterning and growth of the limb, there is a 
need for regulated cell death – the most prominent 
place being the tissue that exists between the digits 
in the developing limb. In addition, the limbs must 
rotate to reach their final orientation. In the upper 
limb this is a relatively small rotation, but in the 
lower limb a much more extreme rotation occurs.
Figure 13.7 The development of the limbs provides a prototype for the development of an organ. There are speciﬁc
regions or structures that pattern each axis, and tissue is recruited to generate the limb. Finally, after development of
the structure there is regulated growth and rotation of the organ to reach its ﬁnal orientation. The developmental
programmes of the limbs are very similar, although there are differences in the genes and signalling molecules
involved that reﬂect the differences in the ﬁnal structures of the organ.

to the level of the thoracic vertebrae, although
innervation from the cervical region is retained.
The phrenic nerve innervating the diaphragm
may be more than 30 cm long in adults.
. The sensory innervation of the diaphragm mi-
grates with the peripheral parts of the dia-
phragm and comes from a lower part of the
spinal cord.
CLINICAL Congenital diaphragmatic
hernia
During development the pleuroperitoneal mem-
branesmayfail tofusewith the septumtransversum,
resulting in a patent pleurocardioperitoneal canal.
As the thorax and abdominal cavities are not sealed
off from each other, intestines may develop in the
thorax and reduce development of the lungs.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernias occur in
around 1 in 2500 births. They are more frequent on
the left side of the diaphragm, because the pleur-
operitoneal membranes close later and must seal a
larger canal. The defect is corrected surgically at
birth, although in particularly severe defects the
damage during development may result in the
death of the child even though the defect has been
corrected. There are rare cases when surgery has
been performed in utero to correct the defect.
Limb development
Limb formation is one of the best-understood
developmental programmes. There are three basic
requirements for the formation of any structure
within the embryo and these occur in the forma-
tion of the limb:
1 The speciﬁcation of a group of cells to build the
organ
2 The
patterning
of
the
primitive
structure
to organise the processes required for correct
development
3 The differentiation and growth of the correct
cell types at the right time and location in the
developing organ.
Speciﬁcation of tissues
to form the limbs
The limbs develop from the limb buds which form
on the lateral walls of the embryo. These buds are
derived from lateral plate mesoderm, covered in an
overlying layer of ectoderm. Two paired limb buds
form on the ‘limb line’, which is deﬁned in the
dorsoventral axis of the embryo:
1 The upper limb buds appear at around day 24
and are located at C5–8
2 The lower limb buds appear at around day 28
and are located at L3–5.
Patterning of the limb
The organisation of the limb requires patterning in
three axes. Each axis is patterned in a different
manner through different signalling molecules
(Fig. 13.7):
. Proximal – distal (shoulder to ﬁngers)
. Anterior – posterior (thumb to little ﬁnger)
. Dorsoventral (back of hand to palm).
Patterning of the proximal–distal axis
The mesenchymal tissue within the limb bud in-
duces the ectodermal tissue to form the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER), which lies along the edge
of the limb bud. The signals from the AER maintain
the mesenchymal cells beneath it in an undiffer-
entiated, proliferating state. As the cells leave this
region they progressively develop into more distal
structures. The time spent in the proliferating
region determines the structures developed on
leaving the structure.
Patterning of the anterior–posterior
axis
The crucial structure for patterning within the
anterior–posterior axis is known as the zone of
polarising activity (ZPA). The ZPA is located on
theposteriorsideofthelimbbudclosetotheregion
that will develop into the bones and structures of
the little ﬁnger. The ZPA releases the protein sonic
hedgehog (Shh), which is a morphogen – a sub-
stance that inﬂuences development through the
gradient of chemical release. High levels of Shh
trigger the formation of the little ﬁnger and related
structures, whereas lower levels of Shh trigger the
development of the thumb and ﬁrst ﬁnger.
Patterning in the dorsoventral axis
The patterning of the dorsoventral axis is achieved
through signals released by the ectoderm. In
Embryology 277

particular, the product of the gene Wnt7a, which is
produced by the dorsal ectoderm of the limb bud,
has been implicated in the patterning.
CLINICAL Thalidomide
Thalidomide was a drug used in the 1950s and
1960s to treat morning sickness. However, it was
discovered that the drug was a teratogen and re-
sponsible for many defects in the developing em-
bryo. The limb defect, phocomelia, was particularly
common. The proximal structures of the limb fail to
develop, although the hands and feet develop nor-
mally. It is thought that thalidomide may have re-
duced the rate of proliferation of the cells located
underneath the AER, such that cells could not es-
capefromthe regionto formthe proximal structures,
although, as the cells survived, the distal structures
did form.
Speciﬁcation of limb type
The developmental programmes that pattern the
fore- and hindlimbs are very similar, although the
limbs that they produce are crucially different.
Although the upper limb is developed for range of
movement and grabbing, the lower limb is adapted
for load bearing.
The different development programmes are
speciﬁed by the expression of limb-speciﬁc genes.
It is thought that expression of the gene Tbx5
triggers the development of upper limb structures,
whereas expression of the gene Tbx4 triggers the
development of lower limb structures. The expres-
sion of these genes is induced through a signalling
pathway involving ﬁbroblast growth factor-related
genes and other genes implicated in whole-body
patterning, such as the Hox genes.
Development and differentiation
of limb structures
Cells from the mesoderm must contribute to the
bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments and vessels
found in the limbs.
The bones of the limbs are produced by endo-
chondral ossiﬁcation. A cartilaginous template is
ﬁrst laid down, and then converted into bone. The
ossiﬁcation of the bones continues after birth, e.g.
the carpal bones do not start to ossify until after the
ﬁrst year. The muscles of the limbs are derived
from somite tissue that migrates into the limbs.
The somatic tissue enters in two groups, one dor-
sally and one ventrally, which generate the ﬂexor
and extensor muscle compartments, respectively.
The muscle precursors develop around the skeletal
tissue and initially divide into myoblast cells which
fuse to develop into the long multinucleated myo-
cytes seen in skeletal muscle.
Migration of the nervous tissue
of the limbs
Innervation of the limbs is derived from the sites at
which the limb buds developed. The nerves sup-
plying the limbs are brought together from their
spinal roots andform two large plexus, in which the
nerve bundles are organised to the branches that
innervate the limbs:
. The brachial plexus receives nerve ﬁbres from
C5 to T1 and innervates the upper limb
. The lumbosacral plexus receives nerve ﬁbres
from L2 to S2 and innervates the lower limb.
The segmental plan by which the limb is inner-
vated is slightly confused by the rotation of both the
limbs during development, particularly the lower
limb in which the rotation is more pronounced and
the plan of innervation varies between the sensory
and motor neurons:
. The motor neurons migrate into the limb as it
develops, and the more distal structures within
the limbs are innervated by progressively more
caudal spinal segments.
. The sensory neurons migrate into the limb at a
later stage than the motor neurons, and hence
follow a different plan of innervation.
Rotation of the limbs
The limbs in the embryo begin their formation on
the same plane, and the developmental pro-
gramme resembles that of a quadruped. The limbs
rotate, reﬂecting our bipedal nature; if rotation did
not occur, the knee and elbow joint would be
identically oriented. Instead the upper limbs are
slightly rotated, whereas the lower limbs undergo a
pronounced rotation.
Sculpting of the limbs
In the following formation of required structures,
there is a signiﬁcant role for apoptosis in the
development of the limbs (as well as in other
organs). For example, webbing develops between
278
Embryology

the digits but this is removed through apoptosis
before birth.
Development of the gut
and lungs
The gut and lungs develop from the primitive gut
tube which is contained mainly within the abdom-
inal cavity. Throughout this process there are also
complex interactions with the mesodermal tissue
to form the many glandular structures associated
with the gut. Finally, the lungs must also develop
from the gut tube, again regulated through inter-
actions with the mesodermal tissue.
Precursors of the gut
The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is derived from the
endoderm, although regions of mesodermal and
ectodermal tissue must also contribute:
. The endoderm develops into the mucosa of the
GI tract.
. The splanchnopleure develops into the submu-
cosal layers of the gut tissue. As a result of the
embryonic folding the gut tube becomes sur-
rounded by a thin layer of mesoderm, derived
from the splanchnopleure.
The primitive gut tube itself can be divided into
three sections which will contribute different sec-
tions of the mature gut. These different develop-
mental sections are reﬂected within the vascula-
ture supplying them, both in the embryo and in the
adult (Table 13.4).
The furthest extremes of the GI tract do not
originate from the primitive gut tube:
. Themouth, jaw and pharynx are derived from the
pharyngeal arches.
. The lowest parts of the rectum and anus develop
from ectodermal tissue.
Rotation of the gut tube
The gut tube starts as a single straight tube, run-
ning along the dorsoventral axis of the embryo,
yet in the developed human it is convoluted and
tightly folded into the abdomen as a result of a
complex series of folds that occur outside the
abdominal cavity.
Folding of the gut starts with the lengthening of
the midgut at about week 6. This lengthening
results as the gut projects into the umbilical cord
and rotates in a series of continuous steps:
. As the gut lengthens it turns around 90 anti-
clockwise if viewed from a dorsal aspect.
. As the gut rotates the gut tube continues to
lengthen and form a series of folds.
. The gut tube continues to rotate as it returns into
the abdomen. The small intestine returns ﬁrst
and then the large intestine is drawn round,
resulting in the formation of the transverse and
ascending colons.
Formation of the mesentery
The mesentery carries the blood vessels supplying
the gut, as well as attaching it to the abdominal
wall:

mesenteric artery, to form a series of fan-shaped
folds and fuses with the posterior abdominal
wall. The mesentery runs from the left superior
aspect to the right iliac fossa.
. In the large intestine, the ascending and des-
cending colons become pressed against the pos-
terior abdominal wall, resulting in absorption of
the mesentery. As a result, the ascending and
descending colons develop into retroperitoneal
structures whereas the transverse and sigmoid
colons retain mesenteries.
Development of the omenta
The omentum of the gut is derived from the dorsal
mesentery, which suspends the gut from the body
wall during development. This layer of tissue
lengthens and twists as the stomach moves, so that
it forms the division between the lesser and greater
sacs of the peritoneum. The large growth of the
mesentery results in a folded loop that hangs from
the curvature of the stomach and lies over the
intestines, forming the greater omentum.
Development of the supporting
organs of the GI tract
The GI tract has many associated glands and or-
gans that are related to its function or derived from
the primitive gut tube. Developmentally, many of
these organs form as a result of interactions of the
mesoderm with the cells of the primitive gut tube.
Four prominent organs form as a result of such
actions:
. Liver
. Pancreas
. Spleen
. Lungs.
Development of the liver
The liver forms from a small diverticulum in the gut
tube at about day 22, and rapidly has a role in
haematopoiesis. Thehepatic diverticulum projects
into the septum transversum, and develops by
branching morphogenesis to produce liver cords
through interaction of the diverticulum with mes-
enchymal tissue within the septum transversum.
The different tissues contribute different compo-
nents of the liver:
. The liver cords develop into the hepatocytes and
the biliary system.
. The mesoderm develops into the blood vessels
and connective tissue within the liver.
. The septum transversum develops into the con-
nective tissue of the liver and forms the falciform
ligament and lesser omentum.
Development of the pancreas
The pancreas arises from the pancreatic buds. The
dorsal and ventral buds form at the caudal part of
the foregut, which will give rise to the duodenum.
During the rotation of the small intestine, the buds
fuse:
. The dorsal pancreatic bud contributes to most of
the pancreatic tissue.
. The ventral pancreatic bud gives rise to the un-
cinate process of the pancreas.
Four different tissues are found in the pancreas –
each with different developments:
. The ductal system throughout the pancreas
forms through branching morphogenesis, al-
though a great deal of the ductal system from
the dorsal bud degenerates, so that the main duct
from the ventral duct carries all the pancreatic
juices to the duodenum.
. The cells surrounding the ductal system form the
acinar tissue which makes up the exocrine
pancreas.
. At the bifurcations of the ductal system, portions
of tissue separate and develop into the islets of
Langerhans. The endocrine tissue is functional
by 20 weeks.
. The connective tissue within, and surrounding,
the pancreas is formed from mesenchymal tissue
into which the pancreatic buds grow.
Formation of the trachea and lungs
The trachea and lungs develop from a bud from the
gut tube during week 4. The endodermal tissue of
the GI tract gives rise to the respiratory epithelium
and the alveoli, whereas surrounding mesenchyme
is recruited to generate the connective tissue, in-
cluding the cartilage and muscular layers.
As the trachea develops and lengthens, two buds
arise at the end and begin to bifurcate, producing
therespiratorytree.Asthetissuebifurcates,itdraws
the surrounding mesenchyme to form the dividing
septa between the bronchopulmonary segments.
Development of the lung structure occurs through-
out gestation and into infant life (Table 13.5).

Embryology

Development of the heart
and vasculature
The formation of the heart and primitive vascula-
ture occurs relatively early in embryo develop-
ment, at the point where diffusion is no longer
sufﬁcient to meet the nutritional and excretory
requirements – about week 3. The heart must
continue to meet the supply demands that the
embryo places on it as it develops; this results in
a complex developmental programme to ensure
that the heart remains functional as it develops.
Formation of the early heart tube
The tissue that develops into the heart is initially
located at the rostral part of the embryo. This
‘cardiogenic’ region of tissue is rostral to the de-
veloping brain and is brought into its correct po-
sition in the embryo as a result of rostral folding,
driven by the increased growth of the brain and the
increasing size of the amniotic cavity.
Ataround3weeks,threeseparateprocessesleadto
theformationoftheprimitivecardiovascularsystem:
1 Pre-endothelial cells in the yolk sac differenti-
ate into haematopoietic stem cells that coalesce
to form ‘blood islands’. These groups of cells join
up to form the early blood vessels, as well as to
generate the blood cells required by the vascular
system.
2 Pre-endothelial cells in the embryo are located
on either side of the notochord. These cells
develop into two tubular structures: the right
and left dorsal aortas.
3 Endocardial tubes develop in the cardiogenic
region at the rostral end of the embryo.
Through embryonic folding, the endocardial
tubes fold down to the correct regions, and the
septum transversum comes to rest to divide the
intraembryonic coelom. The simplest form of
heart is merely a tube with contractile activity,
which can force blood to move in one direction;
by week 4 the primitive heart tubes have fused to
each other and with the aortas (Fig. 13.8). The
myocardial cells in the heart tubes have intrinsic
contractile activity that starts just before fusion.
The heart tube becomes surrounded by meso-
derm cells that differentiate into the myocardium.
The
myocardial
cells
secrete
an
extracellular
matrix – the cardiac jelly – which separates them
from the heart tubes. Finally, a layer of splanchnic
mesoderm encloses the heart tube, which forms the
epicardium.
The structure of the early heart
tube
The heart tube consists of four primitive different
structures from inﬂow to outﬂow:
1 The left and right horns of the sinus venosus
which receive venous blood
2 The primitive atrium
3 The primitive ventricle
4 The bulbus cordis, the outﬂow tract of the heart.
After leaving the bulbus cordis, the blood ﬂows
through the ﬁrst aortic arch and then runs through
the left and right aortas, either side of the notochord.
Development of the venous vessels
The sinus venosus receives three pairs of veins
from different systems that drain blood from the
embryo (Table 13.6).

Heart tubes
After the rostral folding of the embryo, the first structure that forms the 
heart is the paired dorsal aorta tubes. These are surrounded by a thick 
layer of cardiac jelly, which is crucial for the future development of the 
heart. 
After the fusion of the dorsal heart tubes the heart tube is formed. This 
has contractile activity and is made up of four main regions. The sinus 
venosus receives blood from the embryo and placenta, from where it is 
pumped through the primitive atrium and ventricle before entering the 
aortic arches through the bulbus cordis. 
Deformation
As the embryo grows, the sinus venosus starts to alter, with the right 
side enlarging to accommodate the blood from the body – it develops 
into the future vena cava. The left venous sinus regresses and 
develops into the coronary sinus. The resulting changes in the flow of 
blood causes deformation of the heart tube into the soft cardiac jelly 
that surrounds it. 
Looping
The progressive lengthening and folding of the heart tube result in it 
starting to loop around, developing the future left and right ventricles. 
Within the heart tube, the wall septa in the heart start to develop.
Septum primum
Septa must develop in the heart to separate the right and left sides of 
the heart. In the atria, this occurs by growth of the septum primum from 
the roof of the atria and fusion with the septum intermedium, which 
separates the atria from the ventricles. The septum primum then 
develops a perforation – the foramen ovale – towards its superior end 
to allow the flow of blood from the right to left sides of the heart to 
bypass the lungs.
Septum secundum
When the baby is born there is an instantaneous need for the lungs to 
become functional. This results in a massive change in the nature of 
the circulation, such that blood is no longer shunted from the right to 
the left side of the heart. This is achieved by the growth of the septum 
secundum on the left side of the septum primum. With the change in 
fetal circulation the pressure in the left atrium increases, pushing the 
septum secundum against the septum primum to prevent flow of blood 
between the sides of the heart. As the growth of the atrial septa 
continues, the muscular part of the interventricular (IV) septum begins 
to grow to separate the ventricles.
The finally developed heart consists of two discrete ventricles and two 
atria that are linked by the foramen ovale – which will close at birth. 
The atria are separated from the ventricles by the atrioventricular 
valves, which develop from endocardial swellings on the wall of the 
heart and the septum intermedium. The ventricles expel blood out of 
the pulmonary arteries and the aorta, to allow it to flow through the 
pulmonary and systemic circulations, respectively.

Figure 13.8 The development of the heart: the heart undergoes a particularly complex development because it

folding and remodelling throughout the pregnancy. In addition the fetal heart develops so that it can cope with the
rapid changes in circulation after delivery.

Embryology

Cardinal vein system
The cardinal vein system is made up of three paired
vessels:
1 The anterior cardinal system drains the head
and neck of the embryo.
2 The posterior cardinal veins drain the body of the
embryo and are progressively superseded by other
vessels to develop into the system present at birth.
3 The common cardinal veins are formed by the
fusion of the anterior and posterior cardinal
systems. The common cardinal system enters
the sinus venosus.
Development of the heart
The primitive heart tube must develop into a four-
chambered mammalian heart. The heart tube
grows and loops such that the precursors of the
four chambers are brought into the correct posi-
tion. This process occurs between weeks 3 and 5.
The heart looping is the ﬁrst process where asym-
metry is seen in the embryo.
Looping and heart asymmetry
The initial stage is elongation of the heart tube, so
that the primitive atrium moves dorsally and
bulges to form the left and right atria. The primitive
ventricle is displaced to the left and will develop
into the left ventricle, whereas the right ventricle
develops from the bulbus cordis.
Development of the heart chambers
The heart shape has developed by the end of week
5, although the chambers of the heart have not
been divided. The blood draining into the right and
left sides of the heart tube is at different pressures
and deforms the heart into the cardiac jelly that
surrounds it. At later stages in the development,
cells migrate into the cardiac jelly to form myo-
cardium, and neural crest cells also migrate, and
differentiate into postganglionic parasympathetic
cells and the tissue that forms the septum.
The right and left bloodstreams ﬂow through the
heart in a spiral path, shaping the septum which
divides the outﬂow tract of the fetal heart, to par-
tition the great vessels. Abnormal blood ﬂow
through the heart tubes can inﬂuence septation,
resulting in inappropriate division of the outﬂow
tract, as seen in tetralogy of Fallot.
CLINICAL Tetralogy of Fallot
Tetralogy of Fallot (3–5/10000 births) is a major
cause of ‘blue baby syndrome’ and is caused by
four main features resulting from inappropriate di-
vision of the outﬂow tract of the vessels:
1 Ventricular septal defect
2 Overriding aorta
3 Right ventricular hypertrophy
4 Pulmonary stenosis.
The resulting effect of these changes is that the
blood leaving the heart becomes mixed, and insuf-
ﬁcient blood from the heart travels to the lungs to
become oxygenated. This syndrome can now be
corrected surgically.
DEFINITION Cardiac jelly
Cardiac jelly is a non-cellular matrix that is secreted
by the primitive myocardium. It separates the en-
docardium from the developing myocardium and
provides space into which the endocardial tube
deforms during the looping and asymmetrical de-
velopment of the heart.

Septation of the ventricles
The ventricles separate during weeks 5–7 as a
result of the blood ﬂow that deforms and en-
larges the primitive ventricles. The interventric-
ular septum contains both a muscular and a
ﬁbrous part:
. The muscular portion of the interventricular
septum is formed between the enlarging ventri-
cles as they both grow in size closely apposed to
one another.
. The ﬁbrous portion is produced by the lowest
part of the outﬂow tract, which develops during
weeks 5–8 and grows to fuse with the muscular
portion of the septum.
CLINICAL Ventricular septal defects
Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are the most com-
mon form of congenital heart defect (6 in every
10 000 births). A VSD results from the failure of the
ventricular septum to fuse; a connection between
remains the two ventricles. This leads to two major
problems:
1 Theleftventriclebecomesoverloadedbecause
it is unable to efﬁciently pump blood from the
heart.
2 Pulmonary hypertension results from the move-
ment of the high-pressure blood from the left
ventricle into the right side of the heart.
Detection of a VSD is usually through detection
of a heart murmur caused by the ﬂow of blood
through the defect. This ﬁnding can be conﬁrmed
by ultrasonography. Treatment of a VSD can be by
surgery, although small defects often close as the
heart
grows,
allowing
more
conservative
management.
The septation of the atria
Septation of the atria occurs at the same time as
septation of the ventricles, in a series of continuous
steps:
. Septation starts with the formation of the septum
primum which grows down from the roof of the
atrium, forming a crescent-shaped sheet of
tissue.
. The septum primum becomes perforated su-
periorly through apoptosis, allowing ﬂow of
blood between the atria to continue.
. A septum secundum forms to the right of the
septum primum. This septum extends so that it
overlaps the perforation in the septum primum,
forming a valve that allows the ﬂow of blood from
the right atrium to the left, so bypassing the
lungs.
CLINICAL Atrial septal defect
Atrial septal defect (ASD): in about 6 in 10 000 live
births there is a persistent shunt between the left
and right atria. This results from the septum secun-
dum being too short to cover the ostium secundum.
As a result blood becomes shunted from the left
atria to the lower-pressure right atrium.
Initially, this defect occurs without symptoms;
however it causes progressive enlargement of the
right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk, and can
lead to development of heart failure.
An ASD is associated with many chromosomal
defects and is often seen in trisomy 21. Detection of
an ASD is by echocardiogram and it can be treated
by surgery.
Formation of the heart valves
The formation of the valves occurs shortly after
septation. The heart valves are all reinforced by
collagen ﬁbres, which are secreted by mesenchy-
mal cells:
. The aortic and pulmonary valves form from
swellings in the endocardium which develop at
the distal parts of the ventricles. The swellings
become hollowed out to form functional valves.
. The tricuspid and mitral valves form from the
tissue in the atrioventricular canals and the en-
docardial tissue.
The development of the outﬂow
vessels of the heart
In the primitive heart, blood exits the heart through
the paired ﬁrst aortic arches. As the embryo grows,
the blood ﬂows through the second, third, fourth
and sixth aortic arches, although they are never all
present at the same time within the embryo. The
ﬁfth aortic arch is not present in humans at any
time during development.
284
Embryology

The aortic arches in the embryo rapidly regress,
although some of the arches contribute to arteries
within the adult (Table 13.7).
By week 7 the separate aortic and pulmonary
trunks have developed, although within the fetus
the lungs are not required, resulting in most blood
being shunted through the ductus arteriosus into
the descending aorta.
The development of the circulation
During week 6 of development a shunt develops
that links the left umbilical vein to the right vitelline
vein. As a result, the right sinus venosum enlarges
because it must accept most of the blood from the
lower body, and will subsequently form the inferior
vena cava. The right umbilical vein gradually re-
gresses because it is not required to drain blood. By
week 10 the left sinus horn has regressed to drain
the heart tissue, forming the coronary sinus.
The left and right cardinal veins become linked
by the left brachiocephalic vein, which results in
blood being channelled to the right side of the
heart into the superior vena cava, which derives
from the right sinus horn.
Features of the fetal circulation
Before birth, there are sites of bypass in which little
blood passes through the lungs or liver because
they are not required. However, immediately after
birth the neonate must breathe and develop liver
function. This requires a rapid change.
Three prominent points of bypass exist within
the fetal circulation (Fig. 13.9):
1 The foramen ovale in the atrial septum allows
blood to pass from the right atrium to the left
atrium down the pressure gradient between the
two chambers.
2 The ductus arteriosus is a vessel that exists in
the fetus connecting the pulmonary trunk to the
aorta. This vessel allows blood pumped by
therightventricletoﬂowtotheaorta,backround
the systemic circulation, effectively bypassing
the lungs and the right side of the heart.
3 The ductus venosus allows the umbilical blood
from the placenta to bypass the liver.
The placenta is responsible for providing nutri-
ents and oxygen to the body, while helping the
removal of waste metabolites. After birth, the or-
gans inthe bodymust fulﬁlmanyof thefunctionsof
the placenta. The placenta is linked to the fetal
circulation through the umbilical vessels:
. The umbilical arteries form as branches of the
aorta, although they rapidly shift to originate
from the internal iliac arteries.
. The umbilical veins form symmetrically and
carry blood from the placenta to the sinus veno-
sus. By month 2, the left umbilical vein remains
whereas the right has regressed. The left umbil-
ical vein drains into the ductus venosus, which
drains into the sinuses of the liver.
Changes to the fetal circulation
at birth
Several changes occur at birth to remove the
placenta from the circulation and to ensure that
the body’s blood ﬂows through the lungs to oxy-
genate it:
. The baby tries to breathe: the act of ﬁlling the
lungs helps the opening of the alveolar vessel,
reducing the pressure within the pulmonary
circulation, and promotes blood ﬂow through it.
. The walls of the ductus arteriosus contract to
close the vessel. This prevents the right ventric-
ular blood from passing straight to the aorta,
rather forcing it through the pulmonary arteries
to the lungs. The ductus arteriosus develops into
the ligamentum arteriosum in the adult, which
is clinically signiﬁcant because the left recurrent
laryngeal nerve passes around it on its course to
the larynx.
. The foramen ovale closes as a result of the
drop in the pressure of the pulmonary circula-
tion, and the increased pressure of the systemic

Ductus arteriosus 
The ductus arteriosus is a conduit linking the 
pulmonary trunk the aorta. In the fetus it 
ensures that blood in the pulmonary 
circulation is transferred to the systemic 
circulation, bypassing the lungs, which have 
no function in the fetus. On birth, the lungs 
become essential for the oxygenation of the 
blood, and the ductus arteriosus rapidly 
closes to remove this shunt. The ductus 
arteriosus develops into the ligamentum 
arteriosum in the adult.
Foramen ovale 
The foramen ovale exists between the 
atria of the heart. In the fetus it allows 
blood to shunt from the right to the left 
atrium, to bypass the lungs. After birth, the 
foramen closes to allow adequate 
pulmonary circulation and sufficient 
oxygenation of the blood.
Umbilical cord
The umbilical cord connects the fetus to the 
placenta, and carries the umbilical vessels. 
These allow gas and nutrient exchange with 
the maternal circulation. In the fetus, the 
umbilical arteries arise from the internal iliac 
arteries and travel through the umbilical 
cord to the placenta; the nutrient- and 
oxygen-rich blood is then returned through 
the umbilical veins, which join the circulation 
at the liver through the ductus venosus. At 
birth the umbilical vessels rapidly contract to 
isolate the baby from the placenta; the 
umbilical arteries contract before the 
umbilical veins, to allow placental blood to 
return to the child’s circulation. In addition, 
the ductus venosus closes, because it is no 
longer required, and develops into the 
ligamentum venosum.
Figure13.9 Until birththe fetus depends on the placentaforits nutrition,removalof wasteand oxygenation of blood.
At birth rapid changes in the circulationoccur so that the lungs are used for oxygenation, and the placenta is isolated
from the child’s circulation. This occurs by rapid changes at three points in the circulation: the foramen ovale, ductus
arteriosus and umbilical cord.

circulation, due to the large volume of blood
being received in the left atrium. This closure
relies on the one-way valve nature of the foramen
ovale, with the septum secundum being forced
against the septum primum, to prevent ﬂow
through the foramen ovale.
. The umbilical vessels close: the umbilical arter-
ies close rapidly to prevent loss of blood to the
placenta; the umbilical vein closes more slowly,
allowing placental blood to return to the body.
. The ductus venosus closes to prevent the blood
from bypassing the liver. The ductus venosus
develops into the ligatmentum venosum which
helps tether the liver to the abdominal wall.
CLINICAL Patent ductus arteriosus
The circulation required for the development of the
fetus varies enormously from that needed for func-
tioning in the outside world; as a result, failure of the
body to make the necessary changes results in
serious defects, which require rapid correction.
A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) after birth
reduces the blood entering the lungs. Such condi-
tions must be corrected rapidly before the damage
to the heart and the pulmonary system becomes too
severe. This can be done by the administration of
chemicals to promote closure of the ductus arter-
iosus or a plug may be inserted to block the vessel.
Development of the
urinary system
Once the fetus develops to a certain size, it devel-
ops a urinary system, which has three roles during
development:
1 Fetal urine contributes to the amniotic ﬂuid
surrounding the embryo. If kidney development
is impaired, oligohydramnios may result
2 Portions of the urinary system contribute to the
formation of the genital system.
3 The embryonic kidneys are functional in utero to
helpprocess wastealthoughmostwaste removal
is achieved by the exchange of toxic substances
across the placenta.
Three kidney structures develop sequentially in
the embryo from the intermediate mesoderm.
These form progressively in more caudal regions
of the embryo, reﬂecting their evolutionarily later
development:
1 Pronephroi
2 Mesonephroi
3 Metanephroi.
In addition, the bladder and the conduits linking
the kidneys to the external environment must also
develop. Although most of the pronephric and
mesonephric structures regress, the mesonephric
duct is also crucial to the development of the male
reproductive system.
Development of the pronephroi
The pronephroi are the most primitive form of
kidneys. They develop in week 4 from around
six paired balls of intermediate mesoderm,
which form a hollow epithelial structure known
as a nephrotome. Lines of nephrotomes are
found in the cervical regions on both sides of
the vertebral column. The pronephroi are not
functional in the embryo and their development
reﬂects the functional pronephroi seen in many
lower vertebrates. The pronephroi regress dur-
ing week 5.
Development of the mesonephroi
The mesonephroi are the ﬁrst functional kidney
structures found in the embryo. They also contrib-
ute to the development of other structures, partic-
ularly the male genital system.
The mesonephros system can be broken down
into two regions that are distinct in terms of de-
velopment, as well as their contribution to struc-
tures in the fully developed fetus:
1 Mesonephric tubules – the excretory units of the
mesonephros
2 Mesonephric ducts, which drain the mesoneph-
ric tubules.
The formation of the mesonephric
tubules
The intermediate mesoderm in the upper tho-
racic and lumbar regions condenses to form a
mesonephric ridge on either side of the spinal
column. This ridge coalesces to form about 40
tubules, which form sequentially so that, as
the more caudal segments develop, the cranial
tubules regress.
Embryology 287

Pronephros
The first structures to form are the pronephroi, which 
form in the cervical region of the intermediate 
mesoderm. In humans, these are non-functional. The 
mesoderm medial to the pronephros begins to 
coalesce to form the mesonephric ducts – beginning 
at the rostral end of the mesoderm and progressing 
caudally.
Mesonephroi
The first functional kidney structures are the 
mesonephroi which form from the thoracic and 
abdominal intermediate mesoderm. These link up 
with the mesonephric ducts, which drain them; 
during the development of the mesonephroi, the 
ducts fuse with the cloaca to form the bladder.
Metanephroi
The metanephroi develop from the interactions 
between a bud of the mesonephric ducts and the 
region of intermediate mesoderm in the pelvis. 
The ureteric bud rapidly undergoes branching 
morphogenesis in the mesoderm to generate the 
collecting tubules and nephron.
Calyces
The calcyces of the kidney are formed by the fusion 
of the early branches of the ureteric bud. This results 
in the formation of 2 or 3 major calyces and then 
around 8 minor calyces, into which the collecting 
ducts drain.

Embryology

Each tubule is effectively an abbreviated version
of the adult nephron. The mesonephric tubules
drain into the mesonephric ducts after fusion of
the lateral tip of the tubules with the mesonephric
ducts.
Formation of the mesonephric ducts
The mesonephric ducts form as a pair of solid
rods of intermediate mesoderm midway through
week 4. The rods of tissue develop caudally into
tubes and fuse to the walls of the cloaca. The site
of fusion develops into part of the wall of the
bladder in the adult.
The role of the mesonephric system
in the developed infant
The mesonephric system is functional in the fetus
until week 10, at which point it starts to regress. The
contribution of the mesonephric system varies
with the sexes:
. In the male, the mesonephric system develops
into the bladder whereas the mesonephric ducts
and a few modiﬁed tubules develop into parts of
the male genital system.
. In the female almost the entire system regresses,
except that which contributes to the bladder.
Metanephric system
The metanephroi develop into the functional
kidneys in the adult. They develop through
weeks 5–15 from the intermediate mesoderm
within the sacral regions. This is induced by the
ureteric buds, which develop from the meso-
nephric ducts (Fig. 13.10). The ureteric bud pe-
netrates into the intermediate mesoderm and
begins to bifurcate rapidly; the tubule structure
that forms will develop into the nephrons. The
growing tip of the ureteric buds acquires a cap of
cells, which develops into the glomerulus. The
neurons innervating the kidney are found in the
tips of the metanephric tissue during induction
of the nephrons.
Development of the ureteric buds
Initially, the tip of the ureteric bud expands to form
a widened ampulla which forms the renal pelvis:
. During
week
6the
bud
bifurcates
to
form
16 branches, which give rise to the major calyces.
. The next set of branching develops into the
minor calyces.
. Branching continues until week 32 when about
11 further generations of branching have oc-
curred. This branching pattern results in the
mature collecting duct organisation.
CLINICAL Renal agenesis
Failure of the ureteric bud to develop prevents
development of the metanephroi. Around 75% of
cases occur in men. Typical occurrence is fewer
than 9 in every 10 000 live births:
. Unilateral renal agenesis is around ﬁve times
more common than bilateral agenesis. The single
functional kidney usually undergoes compensa-
tory growth. Afﬂicted individuals are often rela-
tively healthy.
. Bilateral renal agenesis is invariably fatal.
Renal agenesis is associated with oligohydram-
nios due to the kidneys’ in utero role in contributing
to the amniotic ﬂuid.
CLINICAL Oligohydramnios
Oligohydramnios is when there is insufﬁcient amni-
otic ﬂuid, which restricts the space available for the
fetus to grow. The resulting defects are known
collectively as Potter's syndrome, and typically
result from bilateral renal agenesis:
. Pulmonary hypoplasia caused by constriction of
the thoracic cavity
. Deformed limbs
. Abnormal facial features – receding chin, wide-
set eyes, deformed nose.

metanephroi) function. These form in progressively more caudal regions of the intermediate mesoderm. The other

Embryology 289

The interaction between the ureteric buds and
the mesodermal tissue surrounding the tip is re-
sponsible for formation of the glomerular struc-
ture. The mesodermal tissue surrounding the tip
invaginates into the tip of the capsule and starts to
differentiate into the glomerulus:
. The mesodermal tissue divides into a tightly
knit
group
of
capillaries
that
form
the
glomerulus.
. The inner layer of the ampulla thins and devel-
ops into the podocytes which surround the
glomerular vessels.
. The outer layer of the ampulla is continuous
with
the
tubular
epithelial
cells
of
the
nephron.
As the glomerulus is developing, the remaining
structure of the tubule lengthens and differentiates
into its constituent regions.
Ascent of the kidneys
The metanephroi form in the pelvis, yet in the adult
they are found in the abdomen. During weeks 6–9,
the kidneys ascend either side of the abdominal
aorta. During this process the blood supply of the
kidneys also ascends.
CLINICAL Ascent of the kidneys
There are several abnormalities related to the de-
velopment of the kidneys or their vasculature which
can lead to abnormal ascent of the kidneys:
. Horseshoe kidney results from the fusion of the
inferior poles of the kidneys during their ascent.
This prevents the kidneys ascending above the
inferior mesenteric artery, where they become
caught.
. Pelvic
kidney
occurs
when
the
kidneys
completely fail to ascend.
Changes in the function of the
kidneys before and after birth
. The metanephroi are functional by week 12
and contribute to the formation of amniotic
ﬂuid. The fetus swallows amniotic ﬂuid that is
absorbed from the gut and the waste products
are ﬁltered by the placenta. Before birth the
urine produced by the nephrons is dilute, due to
the small length of the loops of Henle in the
immature nephrons.
. After birth the loops of Henle lengthen, allowing
concentration of urine because there is now a
need for the infant to retain ﬂuid volume and so
produce concentrated urine.
Development of the head
and neck
The development of the head and neck is partic-
ularly complex because there are many organs
present that have distinct developmental pro-
grammes and different embryological origins:
. The
brain
and
special
sense
organs
are
formed from the neural tube and ectodermal
placodes.
. The face, palate, tongue, ear and neck struc-
tures are formed from the neural crest cells.
. The muscles of the head are formed from the
cranial paraxial mesoderm.
Much of the development of the structures in the
head and neck occurs through the formation of the
pharyngeal arches.
The pharyngeal arches
The pharyngeal arches develop during weeks 4
and 5 and form ﬁve pairs: one to four and six.
The ﬁve pairs of pharyngeal arches are sepa-
rated by four pharyngeal grooves. The pharyn-
geal arches each start with the same basic
structure:
. The outer surface is made up of a layer of
ectoderm.
. The inner layer is made up of endoderm.
. The mesenchymal tissue is primarily derived
from neural crest tissue and gives rise to most
of the connective tissue structures.
. Paraxial mesoderm is present in the mesen-
chyme and gives rise to muscular structures.
The pharyngeal arches are segmentally orga-
nised. This is reﬂected by the arch-speciﬁc arteries
that supply the structures and the innervation of
each arch by a distinct cranial nerve. The pharyn-
geal arches give rise to a variety of structures in the
adult (Table 13.8).
290
Embryology

Development of the thyroid
The thyroid starts to form in week 4 in the midline
between the ﬁrst and second pharyngeal pouches.
The primitive structure enlarges and elongates
to reach its ﬁnal location at the level of T2–3 by
week 7. The glandular duct structure forms
through branching morphogenesis and secretion
of thyroxine starts in month 4 of gestation.
CLINICAL Thyroglossal cyst
The thyroglossal duct may persist in some indivi-
duals. This can result in the formation of a cyst, or
occasionally a sinus, which communicates with the
surfaceoftheneck.The cystisusuallydetectable as
a lump in the neck that moves during swallowing. It
is usually painless, although it can cause discomfort
or difﬁculty swallowing, particular if the cyst swells
as a result of infection.
Development of the tongue
The tongue develops from many of the pharyngeal
arches,
which
is
reﬂected
in
its
complex
innervation of the mucosa and musculature. Ini-
tially, the tongue develops from a series of tissue
swellings in the pharynx. These are progressively
overgrown:
. The ﬁrst arch provides much of the musculature
in the tongue.
. The second arch contributes to the midline re-
gion of the tongue.
. The third arch also provides musculature in the
tongue.
. The fourth arch (with the third arch) gives rise to
midline structures in the tongue.
Development of the face
The facial structure forms a series of facial
swellings:
. Two maxillary swellings
. Two mandibular swellings
. A single frontonasal swelling.
The face forms through the fusion and moulding
of these structures. In particular, the maxillary
swellings produce palatine shelves on their interi-
or, which develop into the hard palate of the
mouth. The failure of these swellings to fuse cor-
rectly results in a facial cleft.

Development of the
nervous system
The nervous system develops from the neural tube
and the neural crest cells, both of which are
formed during neurulation. The processes in-
volved are complex and not fully understood,
although the morphological changes and structure
that develop from each major division of the neu-
ral tube are well established. Although the CNS is
formed from the neural tube, many of the cells in
the peripheral nervous system are derived from
the neural crest.
Principles of axon growth
Nerves often have to grow a long distance to in-
nervate their target tissue. The growth of the axon
is guided through sensing substances secreted by
the target tissue. The ﬁrst neurons that successfully
innervate their target tissue are thought to serve as
a guide for further neurons travelling to the same
tissue.
Growth of the CNS
The formation of the primitive CNS is marked
by the process of neurulation to form the neural
tube. By day 22, neurulation has been complet-
ed and, by day 24, the cranial neuropore has
closed. Three primitive brain vesicles are then
formed:
1 Prosencephalon – the primitive forebrain
2 Mesencephalon – the primitive midbrain
3 Rhombencephalon – the primitive hindbrain.
In week 5, the brain vesicles become further
subdivided to give rise to ﬁve secondary vesicles
which develop into the major divisions in the
developed brain. The central cavity also develops
into the ventricular system (Table 13.9).
Formation of the spinal cord
The spinal cord develops from the neural tube
of the embryo. By day 26, the caudal neuropore
has closed, generating a completely enclosed
structure in the embryo. The cavity within the
neural tube develops into the central canal of
the spinal cord and the ventricular system of
the CNS.
The tissue in the spinal cord become organised
at the end of week 4 to form two paired columns
that run along its length:
1 The alar columns will develop into the dorsal
columns of the spinal cord, carrying the sensory
tracts.
2 The basal columns will develop into the ven-
tral columns of the spinal cord, developing
into the motor neurons. The most dorsal cells
within the basal columns develop into the
intermediolateral cell columns at some levels.
At T1–L3, these give rise to sympathetic ﬁbres,
whereas, at S2–4, they give rise to parasym-
pathetic ﬁbres.
The development of the peripheral nerves that
communicate with the spinal cord is described
below.

Embryology

Growth of the peripheral nervous
system
The peripheral nervous system can be divided into
three portions, each of which develops differently:
. Motor ﬁbres
. Sensory ﬁbres
. Autonomic ﬁbres.
As the ﬁbres grow into and out of the spinal cord
and associated ganglia, they form a complex ar-
rangement of ﬁbres. Initially, two bodies of ﬁbres
leave the spinal cord at each level:
1 The dorsal root contains the sensory ﬁbres, the
cell bodies of which are found outside the spinal
cord in the dorsal root ganglion.
2 The ventral root carries the axons of the motor
and autonomic neurons.
At the thoracic levels, the spinal nerves are con-
nected to the sympathetic chain by two rami:
1 The white ramus carries preganglionic ﬁbres
(which are myelinated) to the sympathetic
chain, where they may synapse in the ganglion,
ascend/descend
before
ascending
or
pass
directly through to for the splanchnic nerves.
2 The grey ramus carries the unmyelinated post-
ganglionic ﬁbres from the sympathetic chain to
innervate the target organs.
The spinal nerve consists of motor, sensory and
autonomic ﬁbres, and rapidly splits into two pri-
mary rami:
1 Thedorsalprimaryramusmigrates toinnervate
the epimere and the tissues that develop from it.
2 The ventral primary ramus migrates to inner-
vate the hypomere and the tissues that develop
from it.
Development of the motor ﬁbres
Motor (ventral column) ﬁbres are the ﬁrst to grow
out of the spinal cord, starting to emerge early
in week 5. They migrate to the sclerotome, rapidly
condensing into spinal nerves as they migrate.
Development of sensory ﬁbres
Sensory (dorsal column) ﬁbres are derived from
the neural crest. Theneural crest cells form ganglia
that are segmentally organised. The ganglia form at
every level from the second cervical level to the
coccyx. The cells in the ganglion produce two
axons: one migrates to the spinal cord, entering
the dorsal column, whereas the other migrates to
the periphery.
Development of the sympathetic
neurons
Sympathetic neurons are produced from neural
crest cells that condense to form the chain gan-
glia, segmentally organised along the spinal cord.
Three larger ganglia form in the cervical region,
and are the sympathetic outﬂow for the head and
neck:
. The preganglionic sympathetic axons in the spi-
nal cord migrate to the chain ganglia, where they
synapse or may migrate up or down to different
levels before synapsing. The preganglionic ﬁbres
originate from T1–L3.
. The postganglionic ﬁbres, which are neural crest
derived, migrate to the tissues with the spinal
nerve.
Some ﬁbres from the CNS enter the sympathetic
chain ganglia and do not synapse but pass straight
through the ganglia, and form the splanchnic
nerves which provide sympathetic innervation to
the structures in the GI tract.
Development of the parasympathetic
ﬁbres
Parasympathetic ﬁbres are organised differently to
the sympathetic system. The preganglionic neu-
rons in the parasympathetic system are generally
long, whereas the postganglionic neurons are very
short. There are two sites of origin for the pregan-
glionic neurons:
1 The motor nuclei (cranial nerves III, VII, IX
and X)
2 The intermediolateral cell columns at S2–4.
In the cranial nerves the preganglionic ﬁbres
migrate to the parasympathetic ganglia, which are
located close to the target organ, where they form a
synapse with the second neuron. In particular, the
ﬁbres in cranial nerve X may be extremely long,
because it is responsible for much of the parasym-
pathetic outﬂow below the head, including the GI
tract, heart, liver and gonads:
. The preganglionic ﬁbres from the spinal cord
arise in the sacral region and join to form the
pelvic splanchnic nerves. They innervate ganglia
embedded in the walls of the target tissue.
Embryology 293

. The postganglionic parasympathetic cells are de-
rived from the neural crest. Throughout the body,
most of the cells are derived from the neural
crest in the occipitocervical region (the vagal re-
gion). In the lowest parts of the gut there is some
contribution from the sacral neural crest.

Anatomy
The body is built around a bony skeleton, which
provides a framework to support the soft-tissue
structures and allow movement. The skeleton is
made up of bones that articulate at joints.
The joints are surrounded by ligaments and other
connective tissue providing a stable interaction.
At those joints where movement is permitted,
muscles cause movement of the joint through
contraction. An understanding of the location of
structures and their relations allows an apprecia-
tion of the origin of the symptoms and signs that
help diagnosis of the underlying condition. In this
chapter, the anatomy of the body is broken down
into a series of regions for purely descriptive pur-
poses. Speciﬁc regions are often associated with
broadly related functions, asa result of their related
developmental programmes.
The bony skeleton
The adult skeleton is composed of 206 bones. Bone
is a rigid connective tissue made up of a collagen
network strengthened by the presence of hydroxy-
apatite crystals, which generate the rigid structure.
The structure of bone
There are two cells that are found in bone and
regulate and maintain it:
1 Osteoblasts lay down new bone, generating col-
lagen and mineralising the extracellular matrix.
As bone is produced, osteoblasts may encase
themselves inside the bone, where they become
known as osteocytes.
2 Osteoclasts are responsible for the resorption of
bone. They are related to macrophages and typ-
ically are found at sites of bone remodelling,
particularly where growth occurs.
Bone is continuously remodelled in response to
stresses on it and this requires the coordinated
action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Bone acts as
a store for calcium, which can be liberated from or
trapped in bone, to regulate plasma calcium levels.
The osteoblasts and osteoclasts maintain bone
in two different structural arrangements:
. Compact bone (or cortical bone) forms the pro-
tecting surface of bones and is extremely hard.
It is also heavy, due to its dense nature, account-
ing for 80% of the weight of all bone within the
body. It has an extremely organised structure
(Fig. 14.1).
. Cancellous bone (or trabecular bone) is made up
of a honeycomb structure known as trabeculae;
this forms the interior of long bones and creates a
relatively strong, but lightweight, structure. The
cancellous bone in the long bone contains bone
marrow, the site of haematopoiesis.
Organisation of the bony skeleton
The bony skeleton is often thought of in two parts:
1 The appendicular skeleton relates to the limbs,
shoulder girdle and pelvis.
Biomedical Science Lecture Notes, First Edition. Ian Lyons.
 2011 by Ian Lyons. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

2 The axial skeleton consists of the skeletal com-
ponents in the midline – the bones of the head,
neck, chest and vertebral columns.
Types of bone and their
articulations
Bones are grouped into ﬁve main classes:
. Long bones are the main levers of the appendic-
ular skeleton; many of these bones contain bone
marrow.
. Short bones resist deformation. They are found
where heavy loads are normally applied, such as
in the wrist and the foot.
. Sesamoid bones are found in tendons, usually
where they pass over a joint. They enhance the
mechanical effect by acting as a pivot.
. The ﬂat bones either give extensive protection to
an area (e.g. the cranial bones of skull) or provide
a large surface area for muscle attachment (e.g.
the scapula).
. Irregular bones are those that cannot be divided
into any of the other subtypes.
Joints
The degree of movement and the stability of a joint
vary with its function:
. Synovial joints are adapted for mobility (e.g.
shoulder joint). The articulating parts of the bone
are covered with smooth hyaline cartilage and
encased in a capsule ﬁlled with a lubricating
synovial ﬂuid. Synovial joints are further divided
according to the movement that they allow.
. Cartilaginous joints (e.g. pubic symphysis) al-
low less movement than synovial joints but are
much more stable. In a child, the long bones
contain ‘growth plates’ which are the site of
growth and are effectively cartilaginous joints.
. Fibrous joints (e.g. skull sutures) link bones
tightly with dense connective tissue. These joints
are essentially immobile.
DEFINITION Growth plates
The bone continues to growth after birth. Growth in
length of the bone occurs at the growth plates (also
knownasepiphysealplates),whicharecartilaginous
joints located towards the end of the long bones.
Growthisachievebythegenerationofanextracellular
matrix by the chondrocytes, which is then remodelled
and converted to bone in a process known as ossi-
ﬁcation, similar to what occurs in development.
The growth plates are particularly active during
puberty, accounting for the ‘growth spurt’, although
they fuse at the end of puberty, after which no more
growth is possible.
Types of synovial joints
Synovial joints are adapted for movement and are
classiﬁed by the movements that they allow as a
result of orientation of the bones in the joints:
. Hinge joints (e.g. the phalangeal joints in the
ﬁngers) allow ﬂexion and extension only.
. Plane
joints
(e.g.
the
patella
joint)
result
from two ﬂat bone surfaces interacting. The
joint allows sliding movement, usually in a single
direction.
. Pivot joints (e.g. the atlantoaxial joint) consist of
a round process that ﬁts into a socket, allowing
rotation around a single axis.

Osteon
Figure 14.1 Compact bone has an organised struc-
ture. The osteon (or haversian unit) is the functional unit
of compact bone. It is made up of many concentric
lamellae of bone, which are arranged around a central
haversian canal. This canal carries the neurovascular
bundle that innervates and vascularises the bone. The
adjacent osteons are linked through Volkmann’s canals
which run perpendicular to the haversian canals. In
between the lamellae are frequent spaces, lacunae,
which contain osteoclasts. The lacunae are connected
to the rest of the haversian channel by ﬁne channels (not
shown).
296
Anatomy

. Saddle joints (e.g. the metacarpophalangeal
joints) are made up of two saddle-shaped heads
that interact to allow movement in two perpen-
dicular planes.
. Condyloid joints (e.g. the wrist joint) are made
up of a rounded process, which ﬁts into a bony
socket. Due to the shape of the joint it allows
movement in two planes.
. Ball-and-socket joints (e.g. shoulder joint) are
made up of a ball-shaped head that articulates
with a round socket, to allow movement and
rotation in several different planes.
Movement at joints
Different articulations of different bones enable
different movements around joints; in relation to
this movements relate to the anatomical position
(Fig. 14.2):
. Flexion: a forward/anterior movement
. Extension: a backward/posterior movement
. Abduction: a movement away from the midline
of the body (except the thumb)
. Adduction: a movement toward the midline of
the body (except the thumb)
. Rotation: medial rotation is rotation of the
joint or part of the body towards the midline;
lateral rotation is movement away from the
midline
. Circumduction: this
is
a
complex
circular
movement combining ﬂexion, abduction, exten-
sion and adduction without rotation.

Anatomy 297

Fascia
Fascia are the layers of ﬁbrous connective tissue
which surround and seperate discrete tissues of the
body. Muscles of the limbs are grouped into fascial
compartments which are functionally associated
with similar movements, in most cases. Fascia
is further classiﬁed into deep and superﬁcial
subtypes.
Deep fascia
Deep fascia is a dense ﬁbrous connective tissue
responsible for dividing the limb muscles into
functional compartments. The thickness of the
fascial layer varies depending on its function. It is
often thin in areas where it should allow expansion
of an organ; however, it is thick in other areas to
facilitate venous return.
Separation of muscles into compartments by
the deep fascia determines the gross type of
movement that they cause about a joint. The
direction of force on the tendon, which joins the
muscle to the bone, also inﬂuences the direction
of movement. Muscles organised into the same
fascial compartments are controlled by the same
nerves.
Superﬁcial fascia
Superﬁcial fascia lies over the deep fascia. This
layer of subcutaneous connective tissue fuses
with the dermis and contains the superﬁcial
vessels and nerves. The connective tissue con-
tains ﬁbrous and adipose tissue in varying
proportions.
In areas where there is a high concentration of
ﬁbrous tissue, the skin is more ﬁrmly attached to
the underlying structures, e.g. the palm, to facili-
tate grip.
The appendicular skeleton
The appendicular skeleton consists of the upper
and lower limbs, which have evolved distinct struc-
tures reﬂecting their different functions.
The upper limb
The upper limb is specialised to give the hand a free
range of movement to complete highly technical
manipulative tasks (Fig. 14.3). It consists of:
. The shoulder girdle which attaches the upper
limb to the axial skeleton
. The humerus of the upper arm
. The radius and the ulna of the forearm
. The eight carpal bones of the wrist
. The ﬁve metacarpal bones of the palm and the
phalanges of the ﬁngers.
The shoulder girdle
Thus, the shoulder girdle (Table 14.1) has devel-
oped to give mobility to the hand relative to the
trunk. This incomplete ring of bony structures
offers stability to the upper limb, while maintain-
ing a high degree of motility. Three major bones (in
addition to the sternum and the vertebrae) make
up the shoulder girdle (Fig. 14.4):
. Clavicle: a long bony strut that holds the scapula
away from the chest. It articulates with the ster-
num to form the sternoclavicular joint.
CLINICAL Compartment syndrome
If the contents of a deep fascial compartment
are placed under increased pressure, as may
occur by haemorrhage, compartment syndrome
may result. As the pressure increases, it com-
presses the low-pressure capillaries and veins
compress ﬁrst, further increasing the pressure
because blood is unable to leave the compart-
ment; ﬁnally the arteries are constricted. This
decreases the supply of oxygen to the muscles
and allows a build-up of waste products within
the compartment. Compartment syndrome is a
surgical emergency and must be treated by re-
lieving the pressure, usually by a fasciotomy to
open up the compartment. Compartment syn-
drome typically presents after a trauma (either
accidental or surgical) and the key presentation
is one of pain particularly on movement of the
muscles of that compartment.
DEFINITION The origin and insertion of
muscles
The intricate control of the movement is due to the
position of the ‘origin’, the most proximal attach-
ment, and the ‘insertion’, the most distal attachment,
of muscles to bones. Tendons join muscle to bone;
the direction of force on these, as well as the ﬁbrous
tissue that holds them in place, contribute to the
direction of the movement that occurs.
298
Anatomy

. Scapula: pushes the humerus away from the
torso and is the site of attachment of the humerus
at the glenoid fossa.
. Humerus: acts as a mobile lever, which directs
the forearm and hand in most directions.
The glenohumeral joint
The glenohumeral joint is a ball-and-socket joint
between the head of the humerus and the glenoid
fossa of the scapula. The fossa is very shallow
which allows the joint a wide range of movement,

cartilage-covered prominences of bone, which articulate with the radius and ulna, respectively. Above the
trochlear and capitulum are the epicondyles and supracondylar ridges, which are important sites of attachments
for ligaments and muscles. The ulna and radius form the forearm and form complex synovial joints at the elbow.
The styloid processes of both bones form the wrist joint with the carpal bones, which connect the hand to the
upper limb.
Anatomy 299

although it decreases the stability of the joint. Joint
stability is enhanced by three features:
. The rotator cuff is made up of short muscles that
secure the humerus to the scapula and are the
major stabilising force of the joint. The rotator
cuff comprises subscapularis anteriorly, supras-
pinatus superiorly, and infraspinatus and teres
minor posteriorly (Fig. 14.5).
. The glenoid labrum is a ring of cartilage that
effectively deepens the joint socket.
. A ﬁbrous capsule surrounds the joint to stabilise
it. The capsule is strengthened by the rotator cuff,
except at its inferior aspect.
CLINICAL Shoulder dislocation
The rotator cuff surrounds the glenohumeral joint in
all but its inferior aspect. Dislocation of the head of
the humerus most commonly follows a downward hit
on the abducted humerus, dislocating the joint
inferiorly and anteriorly due to the absence of a
rotator cuff on its inferior aspect.

Anatomy 301

The elbow
The elbow is a complex joint (Table 14.2), made up
of articulations of the humerus, radius and ulna
(Fig. 14.6):
. The synovial hinge joint between the humerus
and ulna allows ﬂexion and extension.
. The synovial plane joint between the humerus
and the radius allows rotation of the radius on the
surface of the humerus, resulting in pronation
and supination at the wrist. The annular liga-
ment loops around the head of the radius, to
retain its contact with the ulna and enable this
rotation of the radius.
DEFINITION Pronation and supination
The rotation of the radius allows pronation and
supination to occur:
. Pronation: the forearm rotates so that the palm
faces downwards. The ulna remains ﬁxed while
the radius rolls around it at both the elbow and the
wrist joints.
. Supination: the radius rotates about the ulna
so that the palm faces upwards (like a soup
bowl).
The wrist
The wrist is made up of the carpal bones
(Table 14.3), which articulate with the distal ends
of the radius and ulna in a condyloid joint, and
with the metacarpals of the hand. Most force is
transmitted between the large distal head of the
radius and the eight carpal bones (Fig. 14.7):
. The proximal row: scaphoid, lunate, triquetral
and pisiform
. The distal row: trapezium, trapezoid, capitate
and hamate.
The hand
The bones in the hand are the metacarpals and
phalanges. The ﬁve metacarpal bones articulate
proximally with the carpal bones and distally with
the proximal phalanges. There is one set of three
phalanges (proximal, middle and distal) in each
digit, apart from the thumb, which lacks a middle
phalanx. There are also many small sesamoid
bones to provide extra leverage and reduce pres-
sure on the underlying tissue.
Movement of the hand relies on a complicated
system of muscles and tendons. Muscles can be
divided into the following:
. Intrinsic muscles are small muscles with their
bodies in the hand; they allow ﬁne movements.
The intrinsic muscles include the thenar muscles
(thumb), hypothenar muscles (ﬁfth ﬁnger), in-
terosseus muscles (between the metacarpals)
and lumbricals.
. Extrinsic muscles reside in the forearm and are
connected to the insertion by a long tendon, so
that their bulky contractile part does not interfere
with the functioning of the hand, while allowing
the signiﬁcant contraction needed for larger
movements:
– ﬂexors are found in the anterior compart-
ment of the forearm
– extensors
are
found
in
the
posterior
compartment.
The palmar aponeurosis
The aponeurosis is a thickened layer of fascia on
the palm. The aponeurosis protects the soft tissue
and tendons of the hands and provides a tough
surface to help gripping.

Anatomy

The arterial supply to the
upper limb
The brachial artery, a continuation of the subcla-
vian artery, supplies the arms. The subclavian
artery becomes the axillary artery as it travels
around the shoulder joint and, on entering the
limb, it becomes the brachial artery, travelling on
the anterior aspect of the arm, deep to many of the
muscles (Fig. 14.8).
At the elbow the brachial artery divides into the
cubital fossa to form the radial and ulnar arteries,
which supply the forearm:
. The radial artery runs along the lateral (radial)
side of the forearm supplying the anterior com-
partment of the forearm.
. The ulnar artery runs along the medial (medial)
aspect of the forearm, supplying the posterior
compartment of the forearm.
The radial and ulnar arteries continue into the
hands where they give rise to the palmar arches:
. The deep palmar arch is primarily derived from
the radial artery. It lies over the bases of the
metacarpal bones.
. The superﬁcial arch is derived primarily from the
ulnar artery. It is located more distally than the
deep arch.

Figure 14.6 The elbow is formed by the articulation of
the humerus, ulna and radius. The humerus articulates
with both the radial and the ulnar hinge joints, whereas
the ulna and radius form a synovial plane joint. The
annular ligament holds the radius to the ulna, allowing it
to rotate around its axis. This allows pronation and
supination of the forearm.
CLINICAL Colles' fracture
This is the most common wrist fracture. The distal
part of the radius becomes displaced upwards,
backwards and laterally, after a fall on an out-
stretched hand. The ulna is not involved. Full cor-
rection must be achieved to enable full wrist move-
ment in the future.
Anatomy 303

Typically, both arteries contribute to both palmar
arches, although in some situations the palmar
arches derive their blood supply from only one of
the arteries.
CLINICAL Allen's test
Allen’s
test
determines
whether
the
palmar
arterial arches of the hand receive contributions
from both radial and ulnar arteries. This test is
done before a procedure on the radial artery
(such as an arterial blood gas sample) that could
lead to obstruction of blood ﬂow. Pressure is
applied over both the radial and the ulnar arter-
ies in the wrist, and blood in the hand is allowed
to drain. One artery is then released and reﬁlling
of the hand noted. The same process is repea-
ted for the other artery and it is noted whether
both arteries result in rapid reﬁlling (as noted by
change in skin tone). Where a palmar arch is
supplied by only one artery, there will be a
marked difference in reﬁlling between ulnar and
palmar arteries.

is a condyloid synovial joint composed of eight small
bones. Of these, the scaphoid, lunate and triquetral
articulate with the distal radius and the ﬁbrocartilage of
the distal ulna, whereas remaining bones articulate with
the metacarpals. The bones of the hand consist of the
metacarpals and phalanges.
Figure 14.8 The arterial supply to the upper limb is derived from the axillary artery (which is a continuation of the
subclavian artery).This becomes the brachialartery as it enters the arm, and gives off branches to the shoulder joint.
As it travels along the humerus, the brachial artery gives off the profunda brachii branch, which supplies muscles in
the posteriorcompartment. At the elbowthe brachialartery divides into the radial and ulnar arteries,which travel with
their respective bones. There are also posterior and interosseus branches from the arteries, which supply the
muscles in the respective compartments of the forearm. The major pulse points are found at the elbow, where the
brachial pulse can be felt, and at the wrist where both the ulnar and radial pulses can be detected.

The venous drainage
of the upper limb
The superﬁcial veins
The course of veins varies markedly between
individuals. However, two major veins are com-
monly seen, both of which run superﬁcially:
. The basal vein follows a course along the radial
side of the arm.
. The cephalic vein follows a course along the
ulnar side of the forearm.
The veins fuse near the proximal end of the
upper limb to form the axillary vein, which drains
into the subclavian vein.
CLINICAL Venepuncture
A common site for sampling venous blood is the
antecubital fossa at the front of the elbow, where
the median cubital vein crosses. The median cubital
vein runs relatively superﬁcially at this point, con-
necting the basal and cephalic veins; it is not near
other structures that are liable to be damaged.
The deep veins of the arm
The deep veins accompany the arteries and anas-
tomose with them around the artery that they
accompany. They consist of paired radial and me-
dial veins that anastomose frequently, and feed
into the paired brachial veins.
Lymphatic drainage of the upper limb
The lymphatic drainage of the upper limb consists
of the following:
. Superﬁcial drainage drains the hand and runs
with the cephalic and basilar veins. Many of the
vessels enter the cubital nodes at the elbow, and
subsequently drain into the axillary lymph
nodes.
. Deep drainage follows the course of the deep
veins in the upper limb and also drains into the
axillary lymph nodes.
Innervation of the upper limb
The brachial plexus
At the base of each upper limb the anterior primary
rami of the spinal nerves form a plexus that
organises the spinal roots of the nerves into the
separate branches, which innervate distinct com-
partments of the limbs. The nerve roots from
C5–T1 merge to form three trunks: upper (C5–6),
middle (C7) and lower (C8). The cords then further
divide into anterior and posterior ﬁbres which
recombine to form the three cords of the brachial
plexus (Fig. 14.9):
. The lateral cord forms from the anterior divi-
sions of the upper and middle trunks.
. The posterior cord forms from the posterior
divisions of all three trunks.
. The medial cord is made up of the remainder of
the lower trunk.
The cords are ﬁnally organised into branches that
form the nerves of the upper limb. Although there
are many different branches, there are four major
nerves that innervate the skin and the major mus-
cles in the upper limb (Fig. 14.10):
. The radial nerve (C5–T1)
. The ulnar nerve (C8–T1)
. The median nerve (C5–T1)
. The musculocutaneous nerve (C5–7).
The radial nerve
The radial nerve arises from the posterior cord of
the brachial plexus and contains roots from C5 to
T1. It enters the arm behind the brachial artery,
before travelling down the back of the arm on the
medial side and entering the radial groove of the
humerus, with the brachial artery. The radial
nerve emerges on the lateral aspect of the humer-
us, and passes through the intermuscular septum
into the anterior compartment of the forearm. At
the distal end of the forearm it divides into two
branches:
. The motor branch penetrates the supinator
muscle and becomes known as the posterior
interosseus nerve. It travels in the posterior com-
partment of the forearm and innervates the mus-
cles in that compartment.
. The sensory branch remains relatively superﬁ-
cial as it passes through the forearm on the
radial side. It then pierces the deep fascia to
enter the hand on the posterior surface of the
wrist. Sensory innervation is to the posterior
surface of the hand and to the skin on the dorsal
surface above the thumb and the next one-and-
a-half ﬁngers, up to the most distal phalangeal
joint.
306
Anatomy

CLINICAL Radial nerve palsy (saturday
night palsy)
The radial nerve is at risk of injury in the upper arm at
the site where it spirals around the humerus, when a
patient spends an extensive period with an arm in a
position with too much pressure on the radial nerve.
This condition is known as ‘Saturday night palsy’
because patients often present after falling asleep
with an arm over the back of a chair when they have
had too much alcohol to drink. However, another
common presentation occurs with incorrect use of
long crutches.
Damage leads to paralysis of the extensor mus-
cles of the forearm and, therefore, a ‘wrist drop’ – the
inability to ﬂex the wrist upwards when the palm is
faced down.
The ulnar nerve
The ulnar nerve is derived from the medial cord of
the brachial plexus and travels down the posterior
aspect of the arm on the medial side to reach the
elbow.Attheelbowitrunssuperﬁciallytothemedial
epicondyle, whereit is at risk of injury. It then passes
into the forearm and travels alongside the ulnar,
before entering the palm of the hand through the
ulnar canal, superﬁcial to ﬂexor retinaculum.
The ulnar nerve carries both motor and sensory
ﬁbres:
. The ulnar nerve supplies many of the intrinsic
muscles of the hand.
. Sensory innervation is to the medial side of the
hand (both the dorsal and palmar aspects), and
the medial side of the fourth digit, as well as the
entire ﬁfth ﬁnger.

Figure 14.9 The brachial plexus organises the spinal nerves supplying the upper limb into the mixed nerves.
Initially, the spinal nerves exit and form three trunks (upper, lower and middle). Further rearrangement leads to the
generation of three cords (lateral, medial and posterior). The posterior cord forms the radial nerve, whereas the
medial gives rise to the ulnar nerve and the lateral the musculocutaneous nerve. The median nerve is formed from
divisions of the lateral and medial cords.
Anatomy 307

Median nerve
The median nerve is derived from the medial and
lateral cords of the brachial plexus before passing
down the arm’s medial aspect. The nerve emerges
in the cubital fossa to pass on the anterior side of
the forearm to the wrist, where it passes through
the carpal tunnel to enter the hand.
The median nerve has both motor and sensory
components:
. The motor branches supply the ﬂexors of the
forearm (anterior compartment), the ﬁrst and
second lumbricals and the thenar eminence.
. The sensory component supplies the skin of the
lateral part of the palm and the palmar side of the
thumb, the index and middle ﬁngers, and half of
the ring ﬁnger, as well as the most distal tips of
those ﬁngers on the dorsal side.
DEFINITION The carpal tunnel
The carpal tunnel is a sheath formed by ﬂexor
retinaculum, a thick ligamentous layer that links the
hook of the hamate with the scaphoid. The resulting
‘tunnel’ carries many tendons and the median nerve
into the hand. Inﬂammation in this region can com-
press the median nerve, resulting in carpal tunnel
syndrome.

Anatomy

CLINICAL Carpal tunnel syndrome
Carpal tunnel syndrome results from compression
of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. It is char-
acterised by a tingling in the regions of the palm
supplied by the median nerve. As it progresses the
sensations become progressively more painful,
particularly at night, when it can cause the patient
to wake, and may make gripping and other move-
ments difﬁcult.
Carpal tunnel syndrome has become more prev-
alent in recent years with the increase in ofﬁce jobs
involving repetitive movements that increase stress
on the wrist and may promote inﬂammation. Al-
though painkillers may be prescribed, wrist splints
are often effective to rest the wrist. In severe cases
surgery may be performed to decompress the
nerve.
The musculocutaneous nerve
The musculocutaneous nerve arises from the lat-
eral cord of the brachial plexus and travels through
the arm on its lateral aspect to the forearm. It
supplies the ﬂexors (anterior compartment) of the
arm and gives a sensory supply to the lateral aspect
of the forearm.
The lower limb
The lower limb skeleton has evolved for locomo-
tion and weight bearing; its bones are larger and
thicker compared with the upper limb (Fig. 14.11).
The lower limb skeleton is composed of the:
. pelvis and thigh: composed of the ilium, ischium
and pubis, and the femur
. bones of the leg: tibia and ﬁbula
. bones of the ankle: tibia, ﬁbula and talus
. bones of the foot: tarsal bones, metatarsals and
phalanges.
The pelvis
The pelvic girdle transmits force from the spine to
the legs and forms a bony structure to protect the
pelvic organs. The load-bearing role of the pelvis is
reﬂected in its formation of a complete girdle that
is less manoeuvrable, but more stable, than the
shoulder girdle.
The pelvis is made up of three bones – the
ischium, ilium and pubis – which are fused by
ﬁbrous joints and articulate with the femur at the
acetabulum. The roof and the posterior wall are
formed by the sacrum. The remainder of the pelvis
is composed of the iliac bones which articulate
with the sacrum via sacroiliac joints. In addition,
the pelvic girdle is completed anteriorly by the
pubic symphysis, a cartilaginous joint between the
pubic bones in the midline (Fig. 14.12).
The ilium, ischium and pubis contribute to im-
portant anatomical landmarks:

lower limb is made up of the femur, tibia and ﬁbula,
which articular at the knee joint. The bones of the lower
limb are thicker than their counterparts in the upper
limb, reﬂecting their adaptation for load bearing. This
also results in a more limited degree of movement in the
lower limb.
Anatomy 309

. The acetabulum has contributions from the ili-
um, ischium and pubis.
. Obturator foramen is bound by the pubis and
ischium.
. The greater sciatic notch is bound by ischium
and ilium and lies above ischial spine. The lesser
sciatic notch lies below the ischial spine.
The pelvis is often thought of as a tube-like
structure with two openings:
1 The ‘inlet of the pelvis’ runs from the most
superior part of the sacrum to the superior part
of the symphysis pubis.
2 The‘outletofpelvis’runsfromtheinferiorpartof
the pubic symphysis tothe most distal part of the
coccyx.
The hip joint
The hip joint (Table 14.4) is the articulation of
the head of the femur with the bones of the
pelvis. The head of the femur sits in the acetabular
fossa, which is a deep depression at the site of
fusion of all three pelvic bones. Its deep nature
reﬂects the load-bearing role of the pelvis, as
movement at the joint is sacriﬁced to produce a
more stable joint. The joint is further stabilised by
several features, in particular:
. The acetabular fossa is surrounded by a ring of
ﬁbrocartilage, the acetabular labrum, which al-
lowsthe joint toaccommodate 50% of the head of
the femur.
. The hip joint is further stabilised by a ring
of
ligaments
surrounding
the
acetabular
fossa.
The differences in the pelvis in the female
and male
The structure of the pelvis differs between the
sexes (Table 14.5). The shape of the female pelvis
enables childbirth to be facilitated, whereas the
male pelvis is adapted for greater strength and
movement to enable primitive humans to hunt
and gather.

The two pelvic bones are connected anteriorly at the pelvic symphysis.
CLINICAL Surface anatomy of the pelvis
The iliac crest can be traced from the coccyx to the
anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). The pelvic bone
cannot be followed medially from the ASIS due to
the presence of muscles. However, the pubic sym-
physis can be located in the midline and the pubic
tubercle can be found on the upper part of the thigh.
The inguinal ligament is located between the pubic
tubercle and the anterior superior iliac spine.

Anatomy

The knee
The
knee
joint
is
complex
joint
consisting
of
a
synovial
condyloid
joint
between
the
femur and tibia, and a synovial plane joint
between the femur and patella. The patella lies
on
the
patellar
groove
at
the
front
of
the
femur (Fig. 14.13). The articulations in the knee
joint are not very stable themselves; there are
three features that contribute to the stability of
the joint:
. The ligaments of the knee joint
. The menisci
. The muscles surrounding the knee joint.
The ligaments of the knee
The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are
found inside the knee capsule and are crucial in
stabilising the joint. Their names refer to the loca-
tion of their attachment to the tibia.
Other ligaments are found outside the capsule:
. The patellar ligament connects the patella to the
tuberosity of the tibia and gives the patella me-
chanical leverage.
. The medial collateral ligament stretches from
the medial epicondyle of the femur to the medial
tibial condyle, and helps the knee resist stresses
to the lateral side of the knee.

. The lateral collateral ligament extends from the
lateral epicondyle of the femur to the head of
the ﬁbula, and protects the knee from stresses to
the medial side of the knee.
Menisci
The condyles of the femur articulates with the tibia
at two rounded prominences, each resting on a
cartilage pad – known as a meniscus. The menisci
act as shock absorbers and also deepen the knee
joint, helping its stability.
Stabilising muscles of the knee
Although principally a synovial hinge joint, the
muscles surrounding the knee joint can contract
to stabilise it (Table 14.6). In particular, the knee
can twist slightly, tightening the ligaments in an
action known as ‘locking’ the knee. This generates
a more stable but immobile structure, while the
muscles can be temporarily relaxed. The knee can
be unlocked through contraction of the popliteus
muscle, which rotates the knee slightly.
CLINICAL Ruptured cruciate ligament
Cruciate ligaments are two thick rounded cords,
which lie centrally in the joint capsule but outside the
synovial cavity; if the anterior cruciate is ruptured
the tibia can be moved in front of the femur, and this
is common in skiing accidents. When the posterior
cruciate is damaged, the leg will noticeably droop if
it is supported horizontally at the ankle; posterior
cruciate ligament rupture may occur if someone
lands on the tibial tuberosity with the knee ﬂexed.
Small tears may be treated by stabilising the knee
in a brace to allow the individual to continue to use
the joint, while relievingstrain on the ligament to help
healing. Severe tears are treated surgically, and
may require more than 6 months of rehabilitation
for the individual to regain previous function.

the right knee joint. The knee joint is made up of two
synovial joints – a synovial hinge joint between the tibia
and the femur and a plane joint between the femur and
patella. The joint between the femur and the tibia results
in the condyles of the femur articulating with the tibia.
The interaction is cushioned by the cartilage on the
femur, which articulates with the menisci (cartilaginous
pads) found onthe tibia. The jointis stabilisedby the two
cruciate ligaments, the posterior ligament being locat-
ed more laterally. The patella is a large sesamoid bone,
which acts as a pivot for the transference of the force of
contraction of quadriceps to the leg. It is located in the
patellar tendon, which is continuous superiorly with the
quadriceps tendon. (b) The anterior aspect of the right

Anatomy

The ankle
The distal ends of the tibia and ﬁbula are enlarged
to form processes known as malleoli. The ankle is a
synovial hinge joint between the malleoli of the
tibia and ﬁbula and the talus bone of the foot,
which allows dorsiﬂexion and plantarﬂexion; in
this the sole of the foot moves so that the toes point
upwards and downwards, respectively (Fig. 14.14).
The foot is also capable of inversion and eversion
where the foot tilts medially and laterally, respec-
tively. These movements occur at the tarsal joint
below the level of the ankle.
Stabilisation of the ankle joint
The deltoid ligament and two lateral ligaments
support the ankle joint:

Figure 14.14 The foot is made up of the tarsal bones and the metatarsals. The talus articulates with the tibia and
ﬁbula to form the ankle joint and the calcaneus forms the heel of the foot. The remaining tarsals form a series of
synovial plane joints in the foot. This arrangement allows the foot to absorb and transmit shock and impact between
the ground and the body. The tarsals articulate anteriorly with the metatarsals, which extend to the phalanges that
make up the toes.
Anatomy 313

. The deltoid ligament is a ﬂat, triangular band
stretching from the tarsal bones to the medial
malleolus of the tibia; it has superﬁcial and deep
layers.
. The lateral ligaments connect the lateral mal-
leolus to the tarsal bones.
The foot
The foot transmits body weight to the ground
to enable standing and locomotion. It has a
similar structure to the hand due to its evolutionary
origin,
although
the
structure
is
altered
to
reﬂect the different roles. The foot is composed of
tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges. The tarsal
bones correspond to the carpals of the wrist, the
metatarsals to the metacarpals and the phalanges
to those of the hand. The tarsal bones are com-
posed of:
. the talus – interacts with the tibia and ﬁbula to
form the ankle joint
. the calcaneus – forms the heel of the foot
. the cuboid
. the navicular
. three cuneiform bones.
The metatarsal bones are the long bones of the
foot. Each of the ﬁve metatarsal bones articulates
with at least one of the tarsal bones proximally and
one of the proximal phalanges distally. The num-
ber of phalanges in each toe corresponds with that
in the ﬁngers, i.e. three in each, apart from the toe
in which there are only two.
The tarsal and metatarsal bones are arranged in a
series of arches (medial and longitudinal), main-
tained by muscles and ligaments to enable shock
absorption.
The muscles of the foot (Table 14.7) act in a
similar way to those of the hand: there are intrinsic
and extrinsic muscles. The intrinsic muscles act to
maintain the arches. The bulk of the extrinsic
muscles are situated in the lower leg and their
tendons extend into the feet to enable gross move-
ments of the foot.
The muscle compartments
of the lower limb
There are three fascial compartments in the thigh:
. The anterior compartment of the thigh consists
of quadriceps, which extends the leg at the knee
joint. It also stabilises the hip and helps ﬂexion of
the thigh. The anterior compartment is innervat-
ed by the femoral nerve.
. The medial compartment of the thigh is respon-
sible for the thigh’s adduction, and also mediates
rotation at the hip.
. The posterior compartment of the thigh ex-
tends the thigh, ﬂexes the leg and contributes to
rotation. The posterior compartment is innervat-
ed by the sciatic nerve.
There are three fascial compartments in the leg:
. The anterior compartment of the leg dorsiﬂexes
the ankle and extends the toes. It is innervated by
the deep peroneal nerve.
. The lateral compartment of the leg everts the
foot and contributes to plantarﬂexion.
. The posterior compartment of the leg plantar-
ﬂexes the ankle and inverts the foot.
The vasculature of the lower limb
The vasculature of the pelvis
The pelvic blood supply is derived from the
branches of the abdominal aorta, and is discussed
here brieﬂy, but covered in more detail later:

Anatomy

. Themedian sacral artery supplies the fourth and
ﬁfth lumbar vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx and pos-
terior surface of the rectum.
. The common iliac arteries bifurcate anterior to
the sacroiliac joint. With few exceptions, the
tissues of the pelvis are supplied by the internal
iliac, and those of the leg are supplied by the
external iliac:
– each external iliac artery passes under the
inguinal ligament to enter the thigh as the
femoral artery
– each internal iliac follows the sacroiliac joint
and branches to supply: the pelvic viscera,
gluteal region, perineum, lateral wall of the
pelvis and medial aspect of the thigh (obtura-
tor artery), and skin and muscles of the pos-
terior abdominal wall and lower back (iliolum-
bar and lateral sacral arteries).
Vasculature of the leg
Thelegissuppliedbythefemoralartery(Fig.14.15),
a continuation of the external iliac artery. It travels
from the inguinal ligament through the thigh, me-
dial to the femur. At the popliteal fossa it becomes
the popliteal artery, and divides into the anterior
and posterior tibial arteries:
. The anterior tibial artery supplies the anterior
compartment of the leg and the dorsal surface of
the foot. It becomes dorsalis pedis as it crosses
the anterior aspect of the ankle joint.
. The posterior tibial artery supplies the posterior
compartment of the leg and the plantar surface of
the foot. It gives rise to the peroneal artery.
Venous drainage of the pelvis
The pelvis is drained by veins that follow the same
course as their respective arteries. They contribute
to the common iliac veins, which unite to form the
inferior vena cava. These veins have valve-less links
to veins of the lumbar and sacral spine.
CLINICAL Arterial pulse points
Arteries can be palpated at certain points to ensure
that blood is ﬂowing. This is essential if there is any
query over blood supply being compromised to an
area.Inaddition,therateandrhythmoftheheartbeat
can be measured, often using the radial artery. The
carotid artery in the neck can be palpated to assess
the volume of the blood circulating in the body.
The venous drainage of the
lower limb
The venous drainage of the lower limb can be
divided into two distinct types of veins that are
interconnected through communicating vessels.
This allows ﬂow of blood from the superﬁcial vein
to the deeper vessels:
. Superﬁcial veins drain the skin and superﬁcial
fascia; examples include the short and long sa-
phenous veins (Fig. 14.16). They give off com-
municating veins to allow ﬂow of blood from the
superﬁcial to the deep venous system. Valves in
the penetrating veins prevent blood ﬂow from
the deep to the superﬁcial circulation.
. Deep veins accompany large arteries beneath
the deep fascia. Venae comitantes are small
paired veins, which drain the tissue supplied by
smaller arteries. The blood from these veins
drains into the deep veins.
The superﬁcial part of the lateral side of the leg is
drained by the short saphenous vein, which arises
from the lateral part of the dorsal veins of the foot
and passes behind the lateral malleolus. It runs
posteriorly at the calf and drains into the popliteal
vein (a deep vein), having passed through the deep
fascia of the popliteal fossa. The popliteal vein
empties into the femoral vein.
The remaining superﬁcial parts of the leg are
drained by the long saphenous vein, which arises
from the medial end of the dorsal veins of the foot
and runs anterior to the medial malleolus. It runs
anterolaterally in the calf, passing behind the knee
before running anteromedially in the thigh. The
long saphenous vein passes through the fascia lata,
5 cm below the pubic tubercle on the medial aspect
of the thigh. It then joins the femoral vein.
Venous pumps in the lower limb
Stasis of blood in the leg must be avoided, to ensure
adequate return to the heart and to prevent the
formation of thromboses. Two adaptations facili-
tate the return of blood from the lower limb, which
is more difﬁcult than from the arms due to the
effects of gravity:
. Valves in the veins to prevent backﬂow of blood:
the valves consist one to three folds of tissue that
ﬁll as the blood ﬂows back, occluding the lumen.
As the blood direction returns, the lumen is
forced open and the valve pocket pushed to the
side of the vessel.

leg, the popliteal artery splits to form three major branches:the ﬁbular, and the anterior and posterior tibial branches.
The anterior tibial branch becomes dorsalis pedis in the foot, whereas the posterior tibial artery gives rise to the
lateral and medial plantar branches that supply the sole of the foot.

Anatomy

. Muscle pump: the veins run in fascial compart-
ments among the muscles. During muscle re-
laxation, blood drains from the superﬁcial veins
to the deep veins through communicating
veins, the valves of which open to accommodate
this. During muscle contraction, the pressure in
the fascial compartment rises and forces blood
from the deep veins (including that which has
drained from the superﬁcial veins) towards the
heart.
Lymphatic drainage of the lower limb
The lymphatic drainage is organised into superﬁ-
cial and deep vessels:
. The superﬁcial vessels follow the course of the
saphenous veins. Those travelling with the small
saphenous vein drain into the popliteal lymph
nodes in the popliteal fossa. The vessels accom-
panying the great saphenous vein drain into the
external iliac nodes.

Figure 14.16 The saphenousveins provides the superﬁcial venousdrainage of the lower limb. The short saphenous
vein is located on the posterior aspect of the leg and ascends to the popliteal fossa where it pierces the fascia and
drains into the deep venous system. The great saphenous vein ascends the lateral aspect of the lower limb to the
inguinal region, where it too pierces the fascia and drains into the deep femoral vein.
CLINICAL Varicose veins
Varicose veins are dilated superﬁcial veins. As a
result, the valves of the veins become incompetent
and the pooling of blood enlarges them further.
Dilatation occurs for many reasons including genet-
ics, pregnancy and obesity.
Varicose veins are painful, cosmetically ugly,
compromise drainage of the skin and can cause
severe ulceration. Conservative treatment includes
compression stockings, leg elevation and exercise.
Surgical management includes vein stripping when
the affected vein is simply removed.
Anatomy 317

. The deep vessels accompany the deep veins and
drain into the popliteal lymph nodes. The lymph
from the popliteal nodes travels through deep
vessels with the femoral artery to the deep in-
guinal lymph nodes, and subsequently to the
external iliac lymph nodes.
Innervation of the lower limb
The nerves supplying the pelvis and the lower limb
are derived from the lumbosacral plexus, which
receives spinal nerves T12–S4. The plexus can be
divided into two separate, but linked, plexus
(Fig. 14.17):
. The lumbar plexus is located in psoas major, a
muscle in the lumbar region.
. The sacral plexus is found on the posterior sur-
face of the pelvis between the piriformis muscle
and pelvic fascia.
The lumbar plexus gives rise to several branches,
the main ones being:
. The femoral nerve (posterior divisions of L2,
-3, -4) supplies the anterior compartment of
thigh.
. The obturator nerve (anterior divisions of L2, -3,
-4) supplies the parietal peritoneum and medial
thigh muscles. Four smaller branches supply the
lower part of abdomen (T12, L1):
. The genitofemoral nerve (L1, -2) supplies skin
overlying the femoral triangle and cremaster.
The major branches of the sacral plexus are:
. The pudendal nerve (S2, -3, -4) which supplies
skin, anal canal, and reproductive and urinary
tracts in the perineum
. Combined S1, -2, -3, -4 which supply the mus-
cles of the pelvic ﬂoor and the pelvic parasym-
pathetic nerves of the pelvic viscera.
The sciatic nerve
The sciatic nerve is the longest single nerve, sup-
plying all the skin of the leg, and the muscles of the

femoral, obturator and sciatic. (b) The sciatic nerve is responsible for the innervation of all the structures below the
knee joint, as well as the hamstrings, in the thigh. The nerve forms two major branches that enter the different
compartments of the leg – the tibial and common peroneal nerves.

posterior compartment of the thigh, and of the leg
and foot. The sciatic nerve arises from L4–S3. It
enters the lower limb through the greater sciatic
foramen before descending the back of the thigh,
which splits to form two branches in the lower
third of the thigh:
. The tibial nerve supplies the muscles of the foot
and muscles in the posterior compartment of the
calf. It gives rise to two terminal branches – the
lateral and medial plantar nerves.
. The common peroneal nerve winds around the
neck of the ﬁbula before dividing into superﬁcial
and deep branches.
. The deep peroneal nerve supplies the anterior
compartment of the leg and foot, as well as the
sensory supply to the area between the ﬁrst and
second toes.
. The superﬁcial peroneal nerve supplies the
muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg,
the skin of the lateral lower two-thirds of the leg,
and the whole of the dorsum of the foot excluding
the region supplied by the deep nerve.
CLINICAL Sciatica
Compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve causes
severe pain in the distribution in the lower back,
buttocks and various parts of the leg and foot.
Although pain is the most obvious symptom, numb-
ness and weakness may accompany it. The symp-
toms are usually unilateral and removed only when
the cause of the irritation is resolved.
The skull
The head sits atop the neck and encloses the brain.
Although this results in some vulnerability, it also
allows the sensory organs in the head to move,
allowing us to look around. The skull can be di-
vided into two regions (Fig. 14.18):
. The neurocranium encloses the brain, having
outlets
only
for
the
spinal
cord,
various
nerves and veins, and inlets for only the arteries
and nerves. The bones of the neurocranium are
discussed in relation to the brain in Chapter 17,
although their shape and contribution to the
skull as a whole are discussed below.
. The viscerocranium makes up the face and con-
tains the jaws, orbits and nasal cavity.
The neurocranium
The neurocranium is the dome-shaped superior
part of the skull; it is made up of many bones fused
by ﬁbrous joints. The base of the cranium con-
tributes to the roof of the nasal cavity, and the
bones of the neurocranium make up part of the
orbit. The internal aspects of the neurocranium
have evolved to accommodate the brain, however,
and are covered in Chapter 17. Some important
aspects contribute to the external structure of the
skull, where they form anatomical landmarks:
. The frontal bone makes up the forehead, artic-
ulating superiorly with the zygomatic and nasal
bones of the viscerocranium, as well as bones of
the neurocranium. The frontal bone develops as
two halves that fuse in the midline early in life (in
the ﬁrst 5 years).
. Two parietal bones are found posterior to the
frontal bone. These form much of the superior
aspect of the head, articulating with the frontal
bone at the coronal suture. The parietal bones
also fuse with each other along the midline at the
sagittal suture.
. The temporal bones lie on either side of the skull,
immediately inferior to the parietal bones. The
temporal bones contain the external acoustic
meatus, and the styloid and mastoid processes,
which are important muscle attachment points.
The temporal bone also projects a zygomatic
process laterally and anteriorly, which forms the
zygomatic arch with the temporal bone.
. The occipital bone is a single bone at the pos-
terior aspect of the skull, inferior to the parietal
bones. It fuses with the temporal bones and
Figure 14.18 The skull is made up of several irregular bones and can be divided into those making up the
neurocranium, which encloses the brain, and those making up the viscerocranium, which make up the face.
The neurocranium itself forms a vault and base that surrounds the brain on all sides and the only points of access
are the foramina, allowing vascular and nervous access to and from the brain. Most bones in the skull are joined by
ﬁbrous sutures that do not move; however, the mandible in the viscerocranium articulates with a synovial joint, as it
forms the jaw and this allows chewing.

forms the posterior wall of the foramen mag-
num, which carries the spinal cord from the
brain.
. The sphenoid bone makes up a large proportion
of the ﬂoor of the cranial fossa, although con-
tributes to small parts of the lateral aspect of the
skull. It forms part of the lateral aspect of the
skull, articulating with the frontal, zygomatic and
parietal bones.
The viscerocranium
The viscerocranium forms the part of the skull that
makes up the face. Our facial appearance is a result
of structure of the bones and soft tissues that
overlie it. The viscerocranium is made up of
six pairs of bones and two unpaired bones, all of
which are irregular in shape. The paired bones
lie symmetrically about the midline of the face
whereas the single bones lie directly on the midline
itself:
. The maxillae form the skeleton of the upper jaw
andserve as the points of insertion for the teeth of
the upper jaw.
. The zygomatic bones make up the lower parts of
the orbits and contribute to the cheek promi-
nences. The zygomatic bones articulate with the
maxillae, temporal, frontal and sphenoid bones.
The temporal process of the zygomatic bone
contributes to the zygomatic arch.
. The nasal bones form the bony part of the nose.
. The lacrimal bones contribute to the medial
aspect of the orbit.
. The palatine bones are found in the roof of the
mouth, making up the posterior part of the hard
palate. They also contribute to the ﬂoor and
lateral parts of the nasal cavities, and part of the
base of the orbit.
. The mandible is a large single bone. It is U
shaped and forms the jaw, providing attachment
for the lower row of teeth.
. The vomer is a single bone lying in the midline of
the face at the nasal cavity. It is extremely thin
and forms the posterior bony part of the nasal
septum.
The face
The face also contains many muscles responsible
for facial expression, mastication and regulation of
the opening of the oriﬁces (Fig. 14.19), which
connect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts
to the external environment and provide openings
for the special senses.
The muscles of facial expression
The muscles of facial expression develop from the
second pharyngeal arch as a ﬂat muscular sheet,
which differentiates into functional groups of ﬁ-
bres surrounding the different oriﬁces in the face.
All the muscles associated with facial expression
are innervated by the facial nerve (the seventh
cranial nerve or CN VII).
The muscles around the oriﬁces
The eyelids are controlled by the contraction of
orbicularis oculi, which is attached to the palpebral
ligament and the medial orbital margins, allowing
its contraction to pull the eyelid shut.
The muscles around the mouth perform three
functions: they convey facial expression, alter the
shape of the lips to alter sound for speaking and
singing, and close the mouth during eating.
The muscles of mastication
The muscles of the palate and those linking the
mandible to the rest of the skull are responsible for
allowing mastication (chewing). The muscles of
mastication are derived from ﬁrst pharyngeal arch,
and are innervated by the mandibular branch of
the trigeminal nerve (CN V3, reﬂecting their com-
mon embryological origin. There are four muscles
of mastication:
1 Masseter which is the largest of the muscles of
mastication attaching from the maxilla and zy-
gomatic arch to the angle of the mandible
2 Temporalis
3 Lateral pterygoid
4 Medial pterygoid.
DEFINITION The zygomatic arch
The zygomatic arch is an arch of bone on the lateral
aspectof the skull,which is madeup of processesof
the zygomatic and temporal bones. It is a point of
attachment for muscles, including the masseter,
and also forms a canal through which the temporalis
muscle passes to its origin as a wide sheet on the
lateral aspect of the skull.
322
Anatomy

Sensory innervation of the face
The major somatosensory nerve of the face is the
sensory part of the three parts of the trigeminal
nerve (CN V) (Fig. 14.20).
The ophthalmic nerve (CN V1)
The ophthalmic nerve supplies structures in the
orbit and the frontonasal cavity. This accounts for
sensation in:
. the middle of the forehead, up to the hairline
. the conjunctiva
. the skin over the nose.
The maxillary nerve (CN V2)
The maxillary nerve is purely sensory and supplies
the skin and teeth around the maxilla, including
sensation in:
. the zygomatic arch
. the cheek, and lateral sides of the nose
. the upper incisors and canines.

organised into the muscles of facial expression. The oriﬁces are surrounded by rings of muscle to control their
opening. The eyes are surrounded by orbicularis oculi, whereas the mouth is surrounded by orbicularis oris. The
masseter and temporalis muscles are the muscles of mastication, regulating the movement of the mandible relative
to the skull.

Figure 14.20 Sensory innervation of the face: The
sensory innervation of the head is provided by the three
branches of the trigeminal nerve (ﬁfth cranial nerve or
CN V), which between them supply the sensory inner-
vation to the face. The innervation to the remainder of
the head is supplied by the occipital nerves which are
derived from the cervical nerves.
Anatomy 323

The mandibular nerve (CN V3)
Themandibular nervesuppliessensoryﬁbres tothe
skin around the mandible. It has three branches:
1 The auriculotemporal branch innervates the
skin anterior to the ear and in the posterior
temporal region. It also innervates much of the
auricle and external acoustic meatus, and the
tympanic membrane.
2 The buccal branch innervates the skin and mu-
cosa of the cheek and much of the gums.
3 The mental branch innervates the skin in the
chin and lower lip as well as the mucosa of the
lower lip.
Vasculature of the face
The face is richly vascularised. Most of the arteries
supplying the face are derived from the external
carotid artery. In most cases, the arteries supplying
the face are accompanied by their corresponding
veins (Fig. 14.21):
. The facial artery is responsible for the blood
supply to the face.
. The occipital artery runs to the back of the skull,
where it supplies the scalp up to the vertex.
. The posterior auricular artery supplies the au-
ricle and the region of scalp posterior to it.
. The supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries
are unusual in that they are derived from the
internal carotid artery. They supply the muscles
and scalp around the forehead.
The oral cavity
The oral cavity (mouth) is the region through
which food is ingested. It can be divided into two
parts:
1 The oral vestibule is the thin potential space
between the teeth and the cheeks.
2 The oral cavity proper is the space between the
teeth.Thesuperiorsurfaceofthecavityisformed
by the palate.
The teeth
A major feature of the oral cavity is the teeth. These
hard structures are set in the alveolar processes of
the maxilla and mandible bones, forming the up-
per and lower sets, respectively. Their features and
specialisation are discussed in Chapter 8 in rela-
tion to their function:
. The upper set of teeth is innervated by the
superior alveolar nerve, a branch of the maxillary
nerve (CN V2), and receives blood from the
Maxillary artery

Figure 14.21 Vasculature of the face is supplied by branches of the external carotid artery. In particular the
arterial supply to the face is supplied by branches of the facial artery. The head is also supplied by the occipital,
auricular, supraorbital and supratrochlear branches, the branches of which anastomose and supply blood to
the scalp.

Anatomy

superior alveolar artery, a branch of the maxillary
artery.
. The lower set of teeth is innervated by the infe-
rior alveolar nerve, a branch of the mandibular
nerve (CN V3), and receives blood from the in-
ferior alveolar artery, a branch of the maxillary
artery.
The venous drainage of the teeth follows a
similar course to their arterial supply and the
lymphatics from both sets of teeth drain to the
submandibular lymph nodes.
The gingivae
The gingivae, or gums, are the ﬁbrous tissue that
surrounds the teeth and the surrounding bone.
They are made up of two type of soft tissue:
1 Gingiva proper is the mucosa attached to the
necks of the teeth and alveolar processes of the
jaw. This tissue is strong, hard and keratinised.
2 The alveolar mucosa is a looser tissue surround-
ing the gingiva and is non-keratinised.
The palate
The palate separates the oropharynx from the
nasopharynx. It is divided into two regions:
1 The hard palate is the bony portion formed from
the palatine processes of the maxillae and the
plates of the palatine bones. It accounts for the
anterior two-thirds of the palate
2 The soft palate makes up the posterior third of
the palate and is attached to the hard palate. The
soft palate is made up of ﬁve muscles that help
theformationofabolusandswallowing.Thesoft
palate tissue hangs inferiorly to form the uvula.
On its inferior surface the palate is covered in
oral epithelium whereas on its superior surface the
palate is covered by respiratory epithelium.
The tongue
The tongue forms the base of the oral cavity, and
extends to the hyoid bone and mandible, where it is
ﬁxed to the rest of the body. It is important in both
speech and eating and is both a muscular and a
sensory structure, conveying the special sensation
of taste. The detailed structure and function of the
tongue is described in Chapter 8, whereas taste is
discussed in Chapter 17.
The tongue receives many different sources of
innervation:
. All the muscles of the tongue are supplied by
the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) except the
palatoglossus muscle which is innervated the
accessory nerve (CN IX).
. General sensation is carried by the lingual nerve
(a branch of CN V3) in the anterior two-thirds and
the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) in the pos-
terior third.
. Taste sensation is carried by the chorda tympani
nerve, a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) in the
anterior two-thirds, and the glossopharyngeal
nerve (CN IX) in the posterior third.
Blood is supplied to the tongue by the lingual
artery which is a branch of the external carotid
artery.Thevenousdrainageofthetongueisthrough
the dorsal and deep lingual veins which drain into
the internal jugular vein via the sublingual vein.
The nose and nasal cavity
The nose and nasal cavity allow the entry of air into
the body. The nasal cavity also contains the olfac-
tory receptors which sense smell.
The external structure of the nose
The nose projects from the face and is the entrance
to the nasal cavity. It is made up of a ﬂeshy tissue
overlying a skeleton with bony and cartilaginous
components. The nose is separated in the midline
by the nasal septum, which contains a bony por-
tion, made up of ethmoid bone and the vomer, and
a cartilaginous portion; the two resulting passages
to the nasal cavity through the nose are called the
chonae. The nasal septum continues into the nasal
cavity.
The nasal cavity
The nasal cavity lies posterior to the nose, is
bounded by the bones of the skull and is lined with
nasal epithelium. The cavity can be divided into
two regions:
1 The olfactory region is found in the superior
third of the nasal cavity and contains the olfac-
tory receptors.
2 The respiratory region makes up the inferior
two-thirds of the nasal cavity. It is richly vascu-
larised to warm the air entering the respiratory
tract.
The nasal cavity contains three pairs of conchae
(Fig. 14.22). These are curved bony ridges that
Anatomy 325

increase the surface area and direct the ﬂow of air
through the nasal cavity.
Innervation and vasculature
The nasal cavity is highly vascularised, receiving
branches from the labial, ethmoidal and palatine
arteries, which anastomose around the nasal sep-
tum. The veins draining the nose also form a large
plexus, which acts as a heat exchanger.
The superior part of the nasal cavity receives
innervation from branches of the ophthalmic
CN V1 whereas the more posterior and inferior
regions are innervated by branches of the maxillary
nerve. The sense of smell is carried on the olfactory
nerve (CN I).
The nasal sinuses
The nasal sinuses are a series of richly vascularised
cavities in the bones of the face that are connected
to the nasal cavity. These warm and humidify
inspired air, helping gas exchange. There are four
sinuses named after the bones in which they are
located:
. The frontal sinus extends through much of the
forehead. It drains into the nasal cavity in the
space below the middle conchae.
. The ethmoidal sinus is a series of cavities in the
ethmoid bone that drain directly into the nasal
cavity.
. The sphenoidal sinus is derived from the cavities
that form the ethmoidal sinus, and often has an
uneven distribution. It opens directly into the
superior part of the nasal cavity.
. The maxillary sinus is the largest of the sinuses
occupying much of the maxillary bones, and
opens into the nasal cavity at the same site as
the frontal sinus.
The auricles
The auricles are the external parts of the ear.
Although the internal structure of the ear is dis-
cussed in Chapter 17 in relation to its function, the
anatomy of the external ear (the auricle) is dis-
cussed here.
The auricle is made up of ﬂeshy tissue on a
cartilage framework and forms a series of depres-
sions, the largest being the concha, which is where
the external acoustic meatus enters. The inferior
part of the auricle lacks a cartilage skeleton and is
known as the earlobe
The auricle is innervated by the auriculotem-
poral nerve, a branch of CN V3, which supplies the
skin superior to the external acoustic meatus. The

Anatomy

rest of the auricle is innervated by the great au-
ricular nerve, which is derived from the C2 and C3
spinal nerves.
The pharynx
The pharynx is the tract in the head and neck
shared by the gastrointestinal (GI) and respiratory
tracts. It conducts air to the lungs and food to the
stomach, and runs to the inferior border of C6 and
the cricoid cartilage. It can be divided into three
distinct regions (Fig. 14.23):
. The nasopharynx
. The oropharynx
. The laryngopharynx.
The nasopharynx
The nasopharynx lies posterior to the nasal cavity.
It extends backwards, so its posterior wall is made
up of parts of the sphenoid. It is continuous infe-
riorly with the oropharynx. The nasopharynx
warms and humidiﬁes the air as it enters the
respiratory tract. The nasopharynx also contains
signiﬁcant amounts of lymphoid tissue, arranged
in a ring-like structure known as Waldeyer’s ring,
which is found in the superior part of the pharynx.
The oropharynx
The oropharynx is located directly behind the
mouth. It is continuous superiorly with the naso-
pharynx and inferiorly with the laryngopharynx,
running from the soft palate to the epiglottis. The
oropharynx also contains the palatine tonsils,
which are major accumulations of lymphoid tissue
in the space between the palatine arches.
The other structures in the oropharynx are as-
sociated with swallowing and food and are dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapter 8.
The laryngopharynx
The laryngopharynx lies posterior to the larynx,
starting at the epiglottis. The posterior and lateral
aspects of the laryngopharynx are made up of the
inferior and middle constrictor muscles which
help swallowing.
Innervation of the pharynx
The pharyngeal plexus innervates the pharynx:
. The motor innervation is provided almost ex-
clusively through the vagus nerve (CN X), excep-
tions being stylopharyngeus (CN IX) and tensor
veli palatini (CN V3).

Anatomy 327

. The sensory innervation of the pharynx is
through the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)
which innervates all but the superior parts of the
nasopharynx; these are innervated by the max-
illary nerve (CN V2).
The scalp
The scalp covers the surface of the skull. It is tightly
apposed to the skull and continuous at the front
with the skin of the face. The scalp consists of ﬁve
layers:
1 The skin
2 Connective tissue that contains many of the
vessels as well as the nerves
3 The aponeurosis
4 Connective tissue that is less attached than the
preceding layers, allowing movement of the ﬁrst
three layers of the scalp
5 Pericranium – the periosteum of the skull.
Innervation of the scalp
The scalp is innervated by two main sets of
nerves:
1 The branches of the trigeminal nerve supply the
portion of the scalp anterior to the auricles.
2 The spinal cutaneous nerves (C2 and C3) supply
the scalp posterior to the auricles.
The neck
The neck links the head to rest of the body. In
doing so, it serves as a conduit for many vessels
and nerves. The neck lacks much of the bony
protection seen in the rest of the body because
it must allow movement of the head. Many struc-
tures in the neck are derived from the pharyngeal
arches.
The bones of the neck
There are two major bony structures in the
neck:
1 The cervical vertebrae enclose the spinal cord
and support the head.
2 The hyoid bone is a point of attachment for
many of the anterior neck muscles.
The hyoid bone
The hyoid bone is a U-shaped bone that serves to
keep the airway open. It is unusual in that it does
not directly articulate with any other bones. It
is suspended from the styloid process of the
temporal bone by the stylohyoid ligament, and
lies at the level of C3, between the angle of the
mandible and the thyroid cartilage, to which is
connected.
Fascial compartments of the neck
The neck can be subdivided into fascial compart-
ments, which are important clinically in determin-
ing direction of potential spread of an infection.
The neck is divided by the superﬁcial fascia and the
three layers of deep fascia.
The superﬁcial fascia
The superﬁcial fascia of the neck is found imme-
diately below the skin and contains cutaneous
nerves and vessels. On its anterolateral aspect, the
superﬁcial fascia of the neck contains the platysma
muscle.
The deep fascia of the neck
The deep fasciae group in the neck structure allows
smooth movement over each other and provides a
protective covering (Fig. 14.24). Three layers of
deep fascia are found in the neck:
. The investing layer surrounds the neck deep to
the superﬁcial fascia. Superiorly, it attaches to
the inferior border of the mandible, and to the
temporal and occipital bones. Inferiorly, it at-
taches to the pectoral girdle. The fascial layer
splits around the sternocleidomastoid muscle
and submandibular and parotid glands to devel-
op ﬁbrous capsules around them; it is continu-
ous with the nuchal ligament posteriorly.
. The pretracheal layer runs in the anterior part of
the neck from the hyoid bone and is continuous
inferiorly with the ﬁbrous pericardium. The pre-
tracheal layer encloses the thyroid gland, oe-
sophagus and trachea.
. The prevertebral layer surrounds the vertebral
column and its associated muscles. The fascia
runs from the base of the skull to T3. At the base
of the neck the prevertebral layer surrounds the
brachial plexus as the axillary sheath.
328
Anatomy

The carotid sheath
The carotid sheath is a fascial structure continuous
with the investing and pretracheal fascial layers
and runs through the entire neck. The carotid
sheath contains important structures:
. Common and internal carotid arteries
. The internal jugular vein
. The vagus nerve
. The deep cervical nerves
. Sympathetic nerve ﬁbres.
Anatomical compartments
of the neck
Many structures in the neck can be located by their
relation to various muscles. In particular, the su-
perﬁcial muscles of the neck can divide it into two
‘cervical triangles’ which are used to describe the
location of many organs and anatomical sites
(Fig. 14.25).
The superﬁcial muscles
There are three major superﬁcial muscles in the
neck:
. The
sternocleidomastoid
(SCM)
muscle
is
responsible for turning the head. It also divides
the neck into anterior and posterior triangles.
Posteriorly, the muscle has two heads – one
attaching to the manubrium of the sternum and
one to the medial third of the clavicle. Superiorly,
SCM attaches to the mastoid process of the
temporal bone and occipital bone.
. The platysma muscle is a thin muscle in the
anterior part of the neck. It is innervated by
the fascial nerve, serving to tense the skin on the
neck.
. The trapezius muscle is a large muscle found in
the posterolateral part of the neck, extending on
to the back. Trapezius attaches the pectoral gir-
dle to the skull and vertebral column to support

compartments. There is an investing layer of deep fascia that surrounds the entire neck and forms the ﬂoor of the
cervical triangles. The pretracheal and prevertebral layers of deep fascia surround the trachea (and related
structures) and the vertebrae, respectively. In addition there are fascial layers continuous with the investing layer
that surround trapezius and sternocleidomastoid (SCM), whereas the carotid sheath is continuous with the investing
and pretracheal layers of deep fascia.
Anatomy 329

it. Motor innervation is from the spinal route of
the accessory nerve, whereas the sensory inner-
vation is from C3 and C4.
The posterior triangle of the neck
The posterior triangle is located between the in-
vesting and prevertebral layers of deep fascia. It has
three borders made up of prominent muscular and
bony landmarks:
. The posterior border is formed by the anterior
border of trapezius.
. The anterior border is formed by the posterior
border of SCM.
. The inferior border is made up of the middle
third of the clavicle, between trapezius and SCM.
The posterior triangle contains many vessels sup-
plying and draining the head:
. The external jugular vein is found in the ante-
roinferior aspect of the triangle. It drains blood
from the side of the face and scalp. It terminates
in the posterior triangle by forming the brachio-
cephalic vein with the subclavian.
. The subclavian vein passes anterior to the
phrenic nerve and unites with the external jug-
ular to form the brachiocephalic vein at the
medial border of the anterior scalene muscle.
. Part of the subclavian artery runs through the
posterior triangle. It lies in the inferior part of the
posterior triangle, beneath the subclavian vein.
. The accessory nerve enters the posterior triangle
posterior to SCM, running superﬁcial to the in-
vesting layer of deep fascia.
. The brachial plexus starts in the posteroinferior
part of the posterior triangle.
. The phrenic nerve passes brieﬂy through the
posterior triangle before descending into the
thorax with the internal jugular.
The anterior cervical triangle
The anterior triangle is a more superﬁcial structure
than the posterior triangle, and has a roof made up
of the subcutaneous tissue containing platysma
and a ﬂoor formed by the thyroid, larynx and
pharynx; its apex is located inferiorly:
. The posterior border is formed by the anterior
boundary of SCM.
. The anterior border is formed by the median line
of the neck.
. The superior border is made by the inferior
border of the mandible.
Deep structures of the neck
The prevertebral muscles
These muscles lie in lateral to the vertebrae. Two
groups of muscles can be identiﬁed:
1 The anterior muscles stabilise the head on the
neck and allow ﬂexion of the head and neck.

each other by sternocleidomastoid. In particular, the course of the major vessels is described in this way, the carotid
sheathe being a prominent feature that runs in the anterior triangle, whereas the subclavian artery and subclavian
vein can be found in the base of the posterior triangle.
330
Anatomy

2 The lateral muscles are involved in the lateral
ﬂexion of the neck and may also elevate the ribs
and scapulae.
The root of the neck
The root of the neck is the region connecting the
neck to the thorax; it opens into the superior
cervical aperture on the cervical side.
Arteries in the root of the neck
On the right side of the neck, the brachiocephalic
trunk and the subclavian artery can be found.
Although the subclavian arteries supply the
arms, they also give rise to the vertebral arteries,
the internal thoracic and thyrocervical arteries,
and the costocervical trunk.
On the left side, the left subclavian artery and left
common carotid artery are present.
The veins in the root of the neck
Three pairs of veins in the root of the neck receive
most of the blood from the arms and head. They
unite to form the brachiocephalic veins:
. The internal jugular vein (IJV) drains the inter-
nal structures of the head; it travels through the
neck in the carotid sheath and unites with the
subclavian vein posterior to the medial end of the
clavicle. The thoracic duct and the right lymphat-
ic trunk drain into this site.
. The external jugular vein (EJV) receives blood
mainly from the scalp and the face. It travels
through the posterior triangle before passing
through the investing deep fascia to unite with
the IJV and the subclavian veins, to form the
brachiocephalic veins.
. The subclavian vein is a continuation of the
axillary vein and contributes to the formation of
the brachiocephalic veins.
In addition to the paired veins in the root of the
neck, an anterior jugular vein may arise superﬁ-
cially near the hyoid bone. There is variation in the
course of the vein, although it runs in the midline
and joins the termination of the EJV or subclavian
vein in the neck.
Nerves in the root of the neck
Three major nervous structures are found in the
neck (excluding the spinal cord, which is covered
in Chapter 17).
The phrenic nerves
The phrenic nerves originate from C3–5 and are
responsible for the motor innervation to their re-
spective halves of the diaphragm. These pass
through the neck between the subclavian vessels
before entering the thorax.
The vagus nerve
The vagus nerve travels in the carotid sheath,
between the IJV and the common carotid artery,
and provides parasympathetic innervation to all
the internal organs below the neck. In the inferior
part of the neck, the vagus nerve gives off the
recurrent laryngeal branches, which innervate the
larynx and are responsible for controlling speech
(Fig. 14.26):
. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve loops
under the right subclavian artery before ascend-
ing to the larynx.
. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve loops under
the arch of the aorta.
The vagus nerve also gives off branches in the
neck that run along the arteries to the cardiac
plexus.
Sympathetic ganglia
There are three sympathetic cervical ganglia,
which are a continuation of the sympathetic chain
and provide sympathetic innervation to the head
and neck. They receive inputs that originate in the
lower segments of the spinal column and have
passed up the sympathetic chain. Branches from
the cervical ganglia pass to the cervical spinal
nerves or may leave as direct branches to the
viscera. A lesion of the cervical trunk can cause a
disturbance of the sympathetic innervation to the
head – known as Horner’s syndrome.
The viscera of the neck
The thyroid gland
The thyroid gland is responsible for the production
of thyroid hormones and is found at the level of
the second to fourth rings of cartilage in the larynx.
It is made up of left and right lobes which are
connected by a small midline region, the isthmus,
and is enclosed in the pretracheal fascia which
connects
it
to
the
larynx
and
the
trachea
(Fig. 14.27).
The thyroid gland receives a rich blood supply
from three sets of arteries:
Anatomy 331

1 The superior thyroid arteries are derived
from the external carotid arteries and enter the
thyroid at the upper part of the left and right
lobes. The external laryngeal nerve runs withthis
artery.
2 The
inferior
thyroid
arteries
are
derived
from the thyrocervical trunk and enter at the
posterior surface of the gland. The inferior
thyroid artery is accompanied by the recurrent
laryngeal nerve.
3 The thyroid ima artery may be present. This is a
small branch of the brachiocephalic trunk, of the
arch of the aorta, and supplies the isthmus of the
gland.
The thyroid gland is drained by three sets of veins:
. The superior and middle thyroid veins drain
into the IJV.
. The inferior thyroid veins receive tributaries
from the lower parts of the gland, and fuse to
form a single vein that descends in front of the
trachea and fuses with the left brachiocephalic
vein.
The parathyroid glands
There are typically four parathyroid glands, two on
each side. They are associated with the regulation
of calcium through the production of parathyroid
hormone (PTH). Each gland is enclosed in the
fascia surrounding the thyroid gland:
. The superior parathyroids are located at the
level of the middle of the thyroid gland.
. The inferior parathyroids lie at the level of the
inferior poles of the lobes.
The parathyroids receive their blood supply from
the superior and inferior thyroid arteries.
The trachea
The trachea is a muscular tube, reinforced by a
series of cartilaginous rings that link the lungs and
respiratory tree with the nasal and oral cavities.
With the exception of the cricoid cartilage, all the
rings are U-shaped so that the oesophagus, which
sits immediately posterior to the trachea, can

Figure 14.26 The vagus nerve arises from the medulla and provides much of the parasympathetic innervation to
the viscera below the neck. It travels through the foramen magnum and passes through the neck in the carotid
sheath. In the neck the vagus nerve gives off a pharyngeal branch, as well as superior, inferior and recurrent
laryngeal branches. The recurrent laryngeal branch, in particular, takes an unusual course, looping under the
subclavian artery on the right side, although on the left it arises lower and loops under the ligamentum arteriosum,
before ascending to the larynx. The vagus nerve continues into the thorax and abdomen, giving off further branches
to the viscera.

Anatomy

expand unimpeded to allow the passage of food
into the stomach.
In the neck, the trachea is surrounded by many
structures:
. The structures located anteriorly are the skin,
fascia and isthmus of the thyroid.
. The major posterior structures are the vertebral
column and oesophagus. The carotid sheathes
are located laterally to the trachea.
Vasculature and innervation
The blood supply to the trachea is derived mainly
from the inferior thyroid arteries, whereas the
nerve supply is derived from the vagus nerve and
the sympathetic trunks.
The oesophagus
The oesophagus is a muscular tube connecting the
mouth with the stomach. The oesophagus begins
at the level of the cricoid cartilage (located at the
level of the C6 vertebra) anterior to the vertebral
column, and descends initially in the midline,
although as it descends into the thorax it moves
to the left of the neck.
The vasculature and innervation
The blood supply to the oesophagus in the neck is
provided by the inferior thyroid vessels. In the
neck, the oesophagus is innervated by the recur-
rent laryngeal nerves.
The larynx
The larynx protects the airways from the entry of
food and debrisand allowstheproductionof speech
by passing air over the vocal folds to make them
vibrate. The larynxisfound betweenthe tracheaand
the pharynx, and marks the point at which the
airways separate from the GI tract. It consists of soft
tissue supported on a cartilage frame (Fig. 14.28):
. The cricoid cartilage is a complete ring of cartilage
located at the bottom of larynx. It holds the trachea
open, and articulates with the thyroid cartilages.
. The two thyroid cartilages are located to the
sides. They meet in the midline and in men are
prominent on the surface of the neck, forming
Adam’s apple.
. The arytenoid cartilages are located to the back
of the larynx at the upper border of the cricoid
cartilage. They are attached to the vocal folds and
the musculature that controls speech.

from the thyrocervical trunk. The parathyroids are located posterior to the thyroid and consist of paired superior and
inferior parathyroid glands. These receive their blood supply from branches of the superior and inferior thyroid
arteries, respectively.

Figure 14.28 The larynx is made up of a cartilaginous frame, supported by a variety of ligaments and muscles.
(a) It is supported by the attachment of the inferior constrictor muscle and of stylopharyngeus and the stylohyoid
ligament, which anchor the larynx to the pharynx and hyoid bones, respectively. Here it is viewed the left lateral
aspect is viewed. (b) The major cartilages in the larynx are the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. The thyroid cartilage
contributes to Adam’s apple and provides the points against which the vocal folds are attached. The cricoid
cartilage is the opening to the trachea. From the posterior view of the larynx the arytenoid cartilages are visible.
These are attached to the cricothyroid muscles and the vocal folds; the movement of these cartilages can alter the
tension in the vocal folds, allowing alterations of pitch that contribute to voice.
334
Anatomy

. The smaller cuneiform and corniculate carti-
lages support the vocal folds.
. The epiglottis is a large ﬂap of cartilage that is
attached to the throat at its inferior border, al-
though it is unattached at its superior border. The
epiglottis is depressed during swallowing to close
the entrance to the larynx and prevent food
entering the respiratory airways, directing it to-
wards the GI tract.
The cartilages of the larynx are linked by liga-
ments,which derivetheirnamesfrom the cartilages
to which they are attached. Two are of particular
importance:
. The cricothyroid ligament links the cricoid car-
tilage to the inferior border of the thyroid carti-
lage. The upper surface of the cricothyroid liga-
ment is thickened on each side to produce the
vocal ligaments.
. The thyrohyoid membrane connects the upper
border of the thyroid cartilages to the hyoid bone.
The vocal folds are made up of tissue of the vocal
ligament, which is stretched between the thyroid
and arytenoid cartilages, at the back of the larynx.
The intrinsic muscles of the larynx regulate the
tension generated in the vocal folds. As air ﬂows
over the vocal folds it causes them to vibrate;
alteration of the tension in the vocal folds can alter
the pitch of the note.
The musculature of the larynx
The muscles of the larynx can be divided into two
groups:
1 The extrinsic muscles move the larynx as a
whole during swallowing and connect the larynx
to other structures in the neck.
2 Theintrinsicmusclescontrolthevocalfoldsand
inlet of the larynx. They are attached solely to
structures in the larynx.
The movement of the larynx is also affected by
movements of the hyoid bone, to which it is con-
nected by a thyrohyoid membrane.
The extrinsic muscles of the larynx
The extrinsic muscles of the larynx consist of the
elevators and depressors which move the larynx
during swallowing.
The intrinsic muscles of the larynx
There are two tasks that the intrinsic muscles of the
larynx perform:
. Control of the sphincters in the larynx: the
sphincter at the larynx’s inlet is closed during
swallowing to prevent entry of food. In addition,
there is a sphincter at the rima glottidis – the gap
between the vocal folds. This can be used to close
the airway and increase the pressure in the tho-
rax, which occurs before coughing and sneezing.
The sudden release of pressure helps to dislodge
debris from the respiratory tract.
. Voice production: the release of air across the
vocal folds can be used to generate noise,
through vibration of the vocal folds. The pitch
of the note produced is determined by the ten-
sion of the vocal folds, which relies on the action
of the intrinsic muscles. The quality of the sound
and normal speech is produced through altering
the sound generated from the vocal folds in the
mouth and pharynx.
Innervation and vasculature of the larynx
The innervation of the larynx is from three different
branches of the vagus nerve:
. The sensory supply is through the internal la-
ryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal branch
of the vagus nerve.
. The extrinsic muscles of the larynx and the
cricothyroid muscle are supplied by the external
laryngeal
branch
of
the
superior
laryngeal
branch of the vagus nerve.
. The intrinsic muscles of the larynx are supplied
by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, except for the
cricothyroid muscle.
The upper structures of the larynx receive their
blood supply from the superior laryngeal artery, a
branch of the superior thyroid artery, whereas the
lower structures of the larynx are supplied by the
inferior laryngeal artery, a branch of the inferior
thyroid artery.
The spine
The spine transmits the load of the body to the
pelvis and consists of:
. 7 cervical vertebrae (C1–7)
. 12 thoracic vertebrae (T1–12)
. 5 lumbar vertebrae (L1–5)
. 5 sacral vertebrae (S1–5)
. the coccyx.
Anatomy 335

The common components of the
vertebrae
A typical vertebra (Fig. 14.29) is contains the fol-
lowing components:
. The vertebral bodies form a strong column that
transmits body weight to the pelvis. The vertebral
bodies are separated and cushioned by the in-
tervertebral discs.
. The vertebral arch is made from two pedicles
and two laminae, and projects seven processes
that either serve as articular surfaces or allow the
attachment of muscles and ligaments:
– the two transverse processes project laterally,
on either side of the body
– the single spinous process projects posteriorly
from the body
– the paired superior and inferior articular fa-
cets limit the range of movement at each re-
gion of the spine.
. The vertebral foramina are made up of the space
surrounded by the vertebral arch. When the ver-
tebrae are aligned, the vertebral foramina form a
protective channel down the spinal column,
which carries the spinal cord.
. The intervertebral foramina are the apertures
between
adjacent
vertebrae.
These
allow
lateral projection of the spinal nerves and
vessels.
The cervical vertebrae
The seven cervical vertebrae are located in the
neck. Although C1 and C2 are specialised, C3–7
demonstrate the common characteristics of cervi-
cal vertebrae; they have a transverse process
pierced by a foramen to enable passage of vertebral
vessels. The biﬁd spinous process (apart from C7)
(‘vertebra prominens’) is the ﬁrst palpable vertebra
of the neck; it has a horizontal, non-biﬁd, spinous

body and a broad lamina. The arch encloses the vertebral foramen in continuation with the vertebral body, a spine,
which projects from the arch dorsally and medially, and two transverse processes; also paired superior and inferior
articular facets – these project from the pedicles to enable the vertebral arch to articulate with the superior and

Anatomy

process and the vertebral artery does not pass
through its transverse process.
C1 – the atlas
The C1 vertebra (known as ‘the atlas’) forms the
atlanto-occipital joint with the skull, a hinge joint
that enables ﬂexion and extension – nodding. It has
no body, a prominent transverse process and sev-
eral other specialised characteristics:
. A short anterior arch, which has an anterior
tubercle for attachment of the cruciate ligament
as well as an articular facet for the odontoid peg
(dens). The cruciate ligament holds the odontoid
peg in the arch whereas the ligament limits
atlantoaxial joint movement to rotation only, and
prevents the odontoid peg from slipping back-
wards and damaging the medulla and upper
cervical spinal cord.
. The posterior arch is grooved superiorly by the
vertebral artery and has a posterior tubercle
replacing its spinous process.
The lateral masses of the atlas are each pierced by
a foramen for the vertebral artery to pass through.
C2 – the axis
The C2 vertebra (known as ‘the axis’) articulates
with the C1 vertebra and allows rotation of the skull.
Its odontoid process (dens) has evolved from the body
oftheatlas.Itsbodyhasevidentovalarticularfacetson
which the atlas rotates.
The thoracic vertebrae
The thoracic vertebrae are specialised to allow
articulation with the ribs and to accommodate
lateral rotation of the spine. The thoracic vertebrae
have several characteristic features related to their
function:
. ‘Heart-shaped’ bodies of increasing size which
have
upper
and
lower
hemifacets
for
rib
articulation
. A small vertebral foramen
. Thick, broad and overlapping laminae
. Long and posteriorly slanting spinous processes
and substantial transverse processes, most of
which have facets for articulation with the tuber-
cles of the corresponding rib.
The lumbar vertebrae
The lumbar vertebrae are adapted to allow maxi-
mum weight bearing. They also allow ﬂexion and
extension. Consistent with their function, the lum-
bar vertebrae possess:
. large, deep bodies
. interlocking articular processes which allow
ﬂexion and extension of the lumbar spine but
no rotation.
The sacrum
The sacrum is a large structure at the base of the
spine. It is formed by the fusion of ﬁve vertebrae
and contributes to the upper and posterior parts of
the pelvic cavity. The pelvic surface of the sacrum
has four anterior sacral foramina to allow spinal
nerve passage and articular facets for articulation
with the ilium.
The sacrotuberous and the sacrospinous liga-
ments reinforce the sacroiliac joint. The sacrospi-
nous ligament converts the bony greater and lesser
sciatic notch into the greater and lesser sciatic
foramina. Important structures, such as the mus-
cles that stabilise the joint between the acetabulum
and the head of the femur, pass through these
foramina.
The coccyx
The coccyx is non-weight bearing, but provides
attachment for muscles; it has a limited shock-
absorbing capacity when a person sits down. It is
made up of three to ﬁve rudimentary fused
vertebrae.
The joints of the spine
Intervertebral discs form ﬁbrocartilaginous joints
with adjacent vertebrae. Each disc has a ﬁbrous
outer ring and a more hydrated nucleus pulposus,
which articulate with the vertebral bodies directly
above and below it. The intervertebral disc allows
some movement of the spine and maintains shock
absorption.
Movements of the spine
The articular processes of ﬂanking vertebrae are
connected by plane synovial ‘facet’ joints which
allow gliding movements. The orientation of these
articular processes determines the movements
that are allowed:
. The joint between the skull and the atlas allows
ﬂexion and extension of the head.
Anatomy 337

. The joint between the axis and atlas allows
rotation of the head on the axial skeleton.
. Cervical and lumbar regions allow ﬂexion and
extension.
. The thoracic vertebrae allow rotation of the
trunk.
CLINICAL 'Slipped' disc
A slipped disc occurs when the central nucleus
pulposus herniates through a weakened annulus
ﬁbrosus. This often occurs in old age as the ﬁbres of
the annulus weaken, and usually follows excessive
stress such as lifting a heavy object with poor
posture.
A slipped disc is most common in the lumbar
region and typically herniates posteriorly; it can
impinge on the spinal cord. Irritation of the cord
causes sciatica.
The curvature of the spine
To improve balance and weight transmission,
the vertebrae form a series of alternating curva-
tures of the spine. From anterior, the curve is
concave at the neck and the lumbar region,
but convex in the thorax and pelvis. Excessive
curvature is pathological and can cause deteri-
oration of health.
Organisation of the spinal
nerves
Eachsegment of the spinal cord gives off one mixed
spinal nerve composed of a series of rootlets within
the spinal canal. There are 31 pairs of mixed spinal
nerves:
. Eight cervical spinal nerves (C1–8)
. Twelve thoracic spinal nerves (T1–12)
. Five lumbar spinal nerves (L1–5)
. Five sacral spinal nerves (S1–5)
. One coccygeal spinal nerve (Co1).
The ﬁrst seven nerves (C1–7) emerge above verte-
brae C1–7. The eighth (C8) emerges below the
vertebra C7. All other nerves emerge below the
vertebrae of the same number.
The spinal ligaments
The spinal ligaments stabilise the vertebral col-
umn, to ensure that it maintains a strong, yet
ﬂexible structure:
. The intrasegmental ligaments link the vertebrae
together in large groups. The intrasegmental
system includes ligamentum ﬂavum, and inter-
spinous and intertransverse ligaments.
. The intersegmental ligaments connect individ-
ual vertebrae. The intersegmental system in-
cludes the anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments, and the supraspinous ligaments.
The thorax
The chest contains the lungs and heart and their
blood vessels. The borders of the chest are deﬁned
by the thoracic cage, which protects the contents of
the chest. The thoracic cage is formed from the ribs
and their cartilage, which articulate with the tho-
racic spinal column posteriorly and the sternum
anteriorly.
The thorax is separated from the abdomen by
the diaphragm. This is a domed ﬁbromuscular
sheet that is essential for breathing. It is attached
anteriorlytothexiphisternumandposteriorlytothe
costal margins of each side and the upper lumbar
vertebrae. As the diaphragm extends upwards,
many of the upper abdominal organs are also pro-
tected by the thoracic skeletal framework. The di-
aphragm is supplied by the phrenic nerve and
phrenic arteries, which are branches of the aorta.
CLINICAL Pathological curvatures of
the spine
Excessive or abnormal curvatures of the spine can
result in serious problems, through restrictive pa-
thology that this is likely to result in the area affected.
The effects and causes of such curvature depend
on its location and orientation:
. Scoliosis – the spine moves to the right or left of
the midline vertical axis
. Kyphosis – the spine has an excessive dorsal
convexity
. Lordosis – the spine has an excessive dorsal
concavity for similar reasons to kyphosis.
338
Anatomy

The thorax can be divided into two regions:
1 Thelungstakeupmostofthespaceinthethorax,
projecting laterally.
2 The mediastinum is the central region of the
thorax that is not occupied by the lungs.
The skeletal framework of the
thorax
The skeletal framework of the thorax supports the
thoracic viscera, to protect them and also enable
the movements crucial for breathing (Fig. 14.30).
The framework is composed of:
. the thoracic part of the vertebral column
. the sternum
. the thoracic ribs and their costal cartilage.
The sternum
The sternum is found anteriorly in the midline, and
is connected (directly or indirectly) to the ﬁrst 10
ribs, to create the ribcage. It is composed of three
parts (superiorly to inferiorly):
1 The manubrium articulates laterally, with the
medial part of each clavicle and the ﬁrst/upper
facet of second costal cartilages. Inferiorly, the

are linked by the ribs, which can be divided into three classes: the seven true ribs (ﬁrst to seventh), which articulate
directly with the sternum; the three false ribs (eighth, ninth and tenth), which articulate with the sternum via
attachment to the costal cartilage of the ribs above and the two ﬂoating ribs (eleventh and twelfth). The sternum is
made up of three components: the manubrium is the most superior part of the sternum, and articulates with the ﬁrst
costal cartilage and the upper part of the second costal cartilage. It is also the site of attachment of the clavicles. The
manubrium attaches to the body of the sternum inferiorly at the angle of Louis. The body of the sternum provides

Anatomy 339

manubrium forms a ﬁbrous joint with the body
of the sternum. This joint can be palpated as the
sternal angle (the angle of Louis).
2 The body articulates laterally with the second
and seventh costal cartilages, and inferiorly with
the xiphisternum.
3 The xiphisternum is the small rudimentary por-
tion at the base of the sternum. It does not
articulate with any ribs.
The ribs
The ribs have several common characteristics
(Fig. 14.31a), including the following:
. A head: this has two hemifacets, one articu-
lates of which with its corresponding vertebra
and the other with the vertebra above; the area
in between articulates with the intervertebral
disc.
. A neck: this extends laterally from the head
connecting it to the body.
. A body: the body of the rib is curved and
contributes to the ribcage structure, protecting
the internal organs. It stretches from the neck
of the rib to the point where the rib articulates,
directly or indirectly, with the sternum. At the
inferior aspect of the rib lies the costal groove
through which the intercostal nerves and
vessels run.
CLINICAL Needle insertion into the
thorax
A needle must be inserted into the chest immedi-
ately above a rib to avoid damaging the neurovas-
cular bundle that lies in the costal groove directly
beneath the rib (Fig. 14.31b).
The ribs can be divided into ‘true’ and ‘false’ ribs
depending on their attachment to the sternum:
. The ‘true’ ribs (1–7) articulate with the sternum.
. The ‘false’ ribs (8–12) either are connected to the
sternum via the costal cartilage of another rib or
possess no connection with the sternum:
– The costal cartilage of each of ribs 8–10 does
not articulate with the sternum; instead each
is attached to the costal cartilage of the rib
above.
– Ribs 11 and 12 (the ‘ﬂoating’ ribs) are not
directly attached to the thoracic cage anteriorly.

Figure 14.31 The structure of the ribs. (1) The ribs
follow a common structure: the head articulates
with the vertebral bodies. The smooth medial facet
of the tubercle articulates with the transverse pro-
cess of its corresponding vertebra. The subcostal
groove allows room for the intercostal neurovascular
bundle. (2) The neurovascular bundle is located
beneath the rib. Clinically this arrangement is impor-
tant because injections are made to the inferior
aspect of the intercostal space, to avoid damaging
the neurovascular bundle. The inner intercostal mus-
cles contract during forced expiration, whereas the
external intercostal muscles have a perpendicular
organisation of ﬁbres so that their contraction pro-
motes the upward and outward movement of the ribs
to help inspiration.
340
Anatomy

The intercostal muscles
The intercostal muscles occupy the spaces be-
tween the ribs. They are made up of three layers:
1 The external intercostal muscles run from the
tubercle of the rib to the costochondral cartilage.
The ﬁbres in the muscles run inferolaterally, and
contraction causes elevation of the ribs, as in
inspiration.
2 The internal intercostal muscles run below the
external muscles. Their ﬁbres run at 90 to the
ﬁbres of the external intercostals, and on con-
traction cause depression of the ribcage, as in
expiration.
3 The innermost intercostal muscles are the dee-
pest layer of intercostal muscles. They perform a
similar function to the internal intercostals and
are separated from them by the intercostal ves-
sels and nerves.
Breathing
Ventilation of the lungs occurs through expansion
and contraction of the thoracic cavity. The muscles
that enable ventilation of the lungs have different
roles
according
to
the
extent
of
respiration
required:
. The diaphragm is the main muscle used during
quiet ventilation. Contraction of the diaphragm
ﬂattens it, increasing the volume of the thorax.
. The intercostal muscles are required to be more
active when a greater degree of ventilation is
necessary. During inspiration:
– a ‘water pump’ movement occurs in the upper
ribs which move anteriorly and superiorly in a
limited way, predominantly as a result of ac-
tion of the external intercostals
– the lower ribs glide upwards and outwards like
lifting a ‘bucket handle’. It is the lower ribs that
primarily affect the transverse diameter of the
chest.
. On forced respiration accessory muscles may be
used. These include the scalene muscles of the
neck, sternocleidomastoids and limb muscles
attached to the chest wall.
Morphology of the respiratory
system
The lungs occupy most of the space in the thorax
and allow gas exchange. They are connected to the
environment by the airways.
The pleura and pleural cavities
The pleural cavities are lined on each side by a
closed pleural sac, which reduces friction between
the lungs and chest wall during ventilation. The
pleurae are made up of two layers surrounding a
potential space:
. The parietal pleural membrane which lines the
chest wall, suprapleural membrane, diaphragm
and mediastinum.
. The visceral pleural membrane
. The very narrow pleural cavity containing a thin
ﬁlm of pleural ﬂuid.
DEFINITION Mesothelium
Mesothelium forms the lining of many cavities: the
thoracic cavity, heart sac and abdominal cavity. In
the respective regions it is known as the pleura,
pericardium and peritoneum. It is made up of two
layers of specialised cells, each a single cell thick,
which act to protect the organs by forming ﬂuid
between its layers; this has a lubricating action
allowing easy movement of the layers over each
other. The layer adjacent to the organs is known as
the visceral layer and that covering the body walls
is the parietal layer.
The lungs
The lungs are the site of gas exchange. They have a
pyramidal shape and ﬁll the lateral aspect of the
thorax, leaving room for just the heart. The anterior
surface of the left lung has an area where the
pericardium is exposed – known as the cardiac
notch.
Each lung is divided by the oblique ﬁssure that
passes from T3 to about the level of the sixth costal
cartilage obliquely. Although this creates two
lobes in the left lung, the right lung is additionally
divided by the horizontal ﬁssure, resulting in
three lobes. The horizontal ﬁssure runs from the
oblique ﬁssure in the midaxillary line to the fourth
costal cartilage.
The airways
The nose and mouth are the entrance of the air-
ways and both lead to the single trachea, which
forms the start of the bronchial tree. This branch-
ing structure progresses into the lungs, generating
many small vessels.
Anatomy 341

The nose and mouth contribute to the single
airway that starts at the larynx, after its separation
from the oesophagus, which marks the start of the
GI tract. The trachea is continuous with the larynx
and descends into the thorax, where it branches
into the left and right main bronchi behind the
sternal angle.
The main branches supplying the individual
lungs are the bronchi. The left main bronchus
separates into two branches to supply the upper
and lower lobes of the left lung whereas the right
main bronchus divides into three.
Quiet breathing occurs largely through the nose.
As the nasal passages are enclosed in bone and
have a limited diameter, the mouth is recruited
when increased ventilation is required. Similarly,
the laryngeal airway and trachea are limited by
their cartilaginous casing. The C-shaped rings of
cartilage of the trachea maintain the patency of the
trachea while allowing it to accommodate large
boluses of food moving down the oesophagus. The
bronchi are supported by cartilaginous plates that
are made up of smooth muscle to constrict effec-
tively. At rest, the bronchi are usually tonically
constricted to some extent – providing some ca-
pacity for an increase in diameter.
CLINICAL Inhaling foreign objects
Inhaled objects may pass through the pharynx,
down the trachea and into the lung. Objects are
more commonly inhaled into the right lung, which is
shorter, wider and more vertical than the left in the
adult.
The respiratory tract is lined by the mucociliary
escalator:
. Mucus, which is secreted onto the tract surface,
traps foreign particles.
. The cilia, which line the surface of the respiratory
epithelial cells, and the movement of the cilia,
which moves the particle-laden mucus to the
pharynx where it is swallowed.
The vasculature of the airways
and lungs
The lungs have a dual blood supply:
. The pulmonary arteries supply deoxygenated
blood to the lungs. Each pulmonary artery carries
blood from the right ventricle. The pulmonary
arteries branch to create a capillary network
surrounding the alveoli to allow gas exchange.
The pulmonary veins are formed from the alve-
olar capillaries and take the oxygenated blood
away from the lungs to the left atrium.
. The
bronchial
arteries
provide
oxygenated
blood to supply the bronchial tree. These arise
from the aorta near the carina of the trachea, and
lie behind each main bronchus. One bronchial
artery supplies the right lung whereas two supply
the left.
The bronchial arterioles anastomose with the
pulmonary arterioles; together they supply the
visceral pleura, which results in limited mixing of
oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Most of the
blood supplied by the bronchial arteries is drained
by the pulmonary veins and the remainder by the
bronchial veins.
CLINICAL Surface anatomy of the lungs
The lungs extend from the base of the neck to the
diaphragm.When examining a patient it is important
to be able to relate the signs elicited to speciﬁc
areas of the lungs, and important to be aware of the
various boundaries (Fig. 14.32).
In particular, the pleura extends to the level of the
eighth rib anteriorly and the twelfth posteriorly,
whereas the lungs extend only to the level of the
sixth rib anteriorly.
The innervation of the airways
and lungs
A plexus of nerves surrounds the bronchi:
. Sympathetic ﬁbres derived from the ganglia of
T1–5 supply the bronchial muscle, secretory
glands and blood vessels. They induce opening
of the airways to decrease airway resistance,
helping ventilation and therefore a greater sup-
ply of oxygenated blood to the body.
. Parasympathetic ﬁbres, derived from the vagus
nerve, cause contraction of bronchial smooth
muscle and secretion from mucus-producing
glands.
. Efferent ﬁbres in the bronchial tissue give sen-
sory information back to the central nervous
system. They respond to stretch and irritants,
among other sensations.
342
Anatomy

The lymphatics of the airways
and lungs
The lymph from the lungs drains to nodes found at
the hila of the lung. In turn, the hilar nodes drain
into nodes situated at the bifurcation of the trachea
and then to mediastinal node trunks.
The mediastinum
The mediastinum refers to the structures found
in the central part of the thorax. It is located
between the lungs and stretches from the neck to
the abdomen, consisting of four regions: superior,
anterior, middle and posterior (Fig. 14.33).

tenth rib at the midaxillary line, they only reach the level of the eighth rib at the front. The lungs extend down to a level
about two ribs above that of the pleura. As a result there is a gap – the costodiaphragmatic recess – not occupied by
lungtissue.Thelungsaredividedintotwolobesontheleft andthreeontheright,and extendupsuperiorly tothe level

Anatomy 343

The superior mediastinum
The superior mediastinum consists of the medial
section of the thorax, superior to the other sections.
It is bordered inferiorly by an imaginary oblique
plane that passes posteriorly from the sternoma-
nubrial angle (angle of Louis) to the lower part of
the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra. Laterally,
it is bound by the pleurae. It contains many struc-
tures linking the head and neck to the rest of the
body, as well as portions of the great vessels:
. The trachea which starts in the midline of the
neck at C6 and lies anterior to the oesophagus; it
divides into the main bronchi behind the sternal
angle
. The oesophagus
. Arch of the aorta, superior vena cava and their
major branches
. Thoracic duct and bronchomediastinal lymph
trunks and their associated lymph nodes
. Upper parts of the thymus
. Parts of the phrenic and vagus nerves and the
sympathetic chain.
The vagus nerve
The vagus nerve contains preganglionic parasym-
pathetic and sensory neurons for the respiratory
tract, heart and all the derivatives of the fore- and
midgut in the abdomen. Branches of the vagus
nerve are given off at the hila of the lungs. These
supply the pulmonary plexus and the oesophageal
plexus.
The phrenic nerve
The phrenic nerves supply the diaphragm and its
coverings of pleura and peritoneum. They also
supply sensory ﬁbres to the pericardium and me-
diastinal pleura. They originate from spinal nerves
C3–5 and enter the superior mediastinum between
subclavian artery and vein.
The anterior mediastinum
The anterior mediastinum is narrow, located be-
tween the sternum and pericardium, and contains
the internal thoracic vessels, internal thoracic lym-
phatics and most inferior part of the thymus, as

well as a little fatty connective tissue. The parathy-
roid or thyroid glands are also located in the an-
terior mediastinum.
The middle mediastinum
The middle mediastinum contains the heart and
great vessels. The middle mediastinum is bound
and made up of the space between the pleura,
between the diaphragm and the manubriosternal
joint. It is bounded anteriorly and posteriorly by
the pericardium.
The heart and great vessels
Theheart is composed of two muscular pumps that
work in series to pump blood through the great
vessels:
. Deoxygenated blood is transported to the right
side of the heart by two vessels (Fig. 14.34a):
– the superior vena cava draining the upper
limbs, head and thoracic walls; enters the up-
per extremity of the right atrium
– the inferior vena cava draining the abdomen,
pelvis and lower limbs; enters the right atrium
directly after crossing the diaphragm.
. The pulmonary trunk carries deoxygenated
blood away from the right ventricle. It bifurcates
just beneath the arch of the aorta, forming the
pulmonary arteries.
. The pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood
from the lungs to the left atrium.
. The aorta carries oxygenated blood from the left
ventricle and passes to the right of the pulmonary
trunk. The arch of the aorta is a continuation of
the ascending aorta, which passes backward and
to the left, arching over the right pulmonary
artery and left main bronchus. The aorta then
descends at the left side of the fourth thoracic
vertebra (Fig. 14.34b).
The heart is located in the middle mediastinum,
positionedobliquelybehindthesternum,one-third
to the right of the midline and two-thirds to the left.
It forms a broadly inverted pyramidal shape with
the apex usually found behind the ﬁfth intercostal
space in the midclavicular line; the apex is the
heart’s most lateral and inferior part on the left.
The oblique position of the heart is better un-
derstood by considering which chambers of the
heart create the surfaces (Fig. 14.35):
. The left atrium forms most of the base of the
heart.
. The right ventricle forms most of the anterior
surface of the heart and generates much of the
inferior border of the heart.
. The right border is formed by the right atrium.
. The left ventricle forms most of the left border
though the left atrium overlaps the most superior
part.
Other blood vessels in the mediastinum
The aorta carries blood away from the left ventricle
to the body. At the arch three important arteries
arise:
1 The brachiocephalic artery bifurcates behind
the right sternoclavicular joint to form the right
subclavian and right common carotid arteries.
2 Theleftcommoncarotidtravelsontheleftofthe
trachea to supply the head.
3 The left subclavian supplies the left arm.
The inferior part of the aortic arch and the bifur-
cation of the pulmonary trunk are joined by the
ligamentum arteriosum.
CLINICAL Aortic aneurysm
This is an abnormal dilatation of the aorta, due to a
weakness in the wall, which may be one of the
following:
. Saccular: a saccular aneurysm evolves when a
weakness in the vessel wall allows the blood to
force the intima and media to balloon out.
. Dissecting: dissection is a tear in the wall of the
vessel that causes blood to stream between the
layers of the aorta, forcing the layers apart.
. Fusiform: a fusiform aneurysmis spindle shaped,
resulting from swelling around the circumference
of the vessel with no protrusion of the inner layers.
Aneurysms can be further divided into two:
1 True aneurysms (such as saccular and dissect-
ing aneurysms) involve an outpouching of all
vessel layers and can be either congenital or
acquired.
2 False aneurysms (such as dissecting aneur-
ysms) occur when blood leaks out of the vessel
but is conﬁned by surrounding tissues. False
aneurysms usually result from trauma and are a
recognised
complication
of
some
arterial
procedures.
Serious complications that can arise from an aneu-
rysm include: rupture, thrombosis, embolism, pres-
sure on other structures and infection.

major venous drainage occurs through the vena cavae. The inferior vena cava (not shown) is responsible
for draining blood from the lower parts of the body, whereas the superior vena cava drains blood from the body
above the heart. In addition the blood from the posterior wall of the thorax and abdomen can be drained through
the azygos and hemiazygos veins. Although these originate from below the level of the heart, they drain into the
superior vena cava.

Anatomy

The posterior mediastinum
The posterior mediastinum lies posterior to the
heart and great vessels. It is bordered anteriorly
by the pericardium, inferiorly by the diaphragm,
superiorlybythesuperiormediastinum,posteriorly
by the thoracic vertebral column (T4–12) and lat-
erally by the pleurae. It contains many structures
and conduits travelling to or from the abdomen:
. The oesophagus
. The descending aorta and its branches
. The azygos vein and its tributaries
. The thoracic lymph duct and associated nodes
. The thoracic sympathetic chain and its branches.
The oesophagus
The oesophagus starts in the midline of the neck at
C6, and lies slightly to the left of the midline as it
descends behind the trachea. As it reaches the
diaphragm, it travels to the left, crossing in front
of the aorta and entering the abdomen at T10.
The descending aorta
The descending aorta extends from the aortic arch
starting at the lower border of the fourth thoracic
vertebra. It ends anterior to the lower border of the
twelfth thoracic vertebra at the aortic hiatus in the
diaphragm.
The azygos veins
Drainage of the posterior chest wall is achieved by
theazygosveins,whichtraveltotherightofthelower
thoracic vertebral bodies and drain into the superior
vena cava just before it enters the pericardium.
The thoracic duct
The thoracic duct originates from the cisterna chyli,
a lymphatic sac, in the abdomen by the anterior
surface of L1. Lymph from parts of the body below
the diaphragm drains into the cisterna chyli. The
thoracic duct arises from the abdomen behind the
aorta. It ascends behind the oesophagus and anterior
to the thoracicvertebrae,anddrainsinto thejunction
oftheleftinternaljugularand leftsubclavianveins.At
the point of return to the venous system, the left
lymphatic duct has acquired lymph from the left arm
and left-hand side of the upper body.
The right lymphatic ducts empty here into the
equivalent on the right side, and collect lymph
from the right arm and right-hand side of the chest,
neck and head.
The thoracic sympathetic chain
The sympathetic chain is a bundle of nerve
ﬁbres that travels vertically on the necks of the
ribs on either side of the thoracic vertebral
column from T5 to T12 (Fig. 14.36). The sympa-
thetic chain extends further above T5 through
three further ganglia, with their ﬁbres inferior to
them; these are responsible for supplying the sym-
pathetic outﬂow to the head and neck.
The abdomen
The abdomen contains most of the alimentary
canal and its supporting organs. It also contains
other structures not directly related to GI function.
The abdomen is clearly separated from the thorax
by the diaphragm, although the division between
the abdomen and pelvis is less clear.
CLINICAL Surface anatomy of the
abdomen
When the abdomen is examined it is divided into nine
areas (Fig. 14.37). The left and right hypochondriaare
separated by the epigastric area, and are all found
just below the ribs. The liver can be palpated in the
right hypochondrium. Parts of the liver can be pal-
patedinthe epigastric areaalongsidethe duodenum,
pancreasandpartofthestomach.Theremainingpart
ofthestomachcanbepalpatedintheleftepigastrium.
The left and right lumbar regions are found directly
below, separated by the umbilical region. In these
areas, various parts of the bowel can be palpated as
well as the kidneys. Below these are the left and right
iliac areas, separated by the hypogastric region.
In the right iliac fossa, you can palpate the ap-
pendix and the caecum, whereas in the left you can
feel the descending colon.
In women you may detect gynaecological pathol-
ogy in those areas. In the hypogastric region, the
bladder and uterus can be palpated.
Figure 14.36 The autonomic outﬂow of the body is divided into the sympathetic outﬂow which is through the
sympathetic chain, derived from the thoracic region and the parasympathetic outﬂow that occurs from the cranial
nerves(CN III, VII, IX, X and XI) and the sacral regionsof the spinal cord (S2–4).Most organs in the body receive both
sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations.

Anatomy 349

The anterior abdominal wall
The anterior abdominal wall secures the abdom-
inal viscera. Its muscular layers allow increases in
intra-abdominal pressure for functions such as
bladder control.
The anterior abdominal wall is composed
of a vertical muscle and three ﬂat sheets of
muscle that are encased by skin and superﬁcial
fascia.
. The rectus abdominis muscle is a vertical
sheet that runs either side of the anterior
wall of the abdomen and is divided in the
midline by the linea alba, a band of connective
tissue. The muscle runs from the xiphisternum
and
lower
costal
cartilages
to
the
pubic
symphysis.
. The external oblique muscle pulls the thorax
downwards to compress the abdominal cavity
and increase the pressure within it. The internal
oblique muscle increases the abdominal pres-
sure, encouraging the abdominal organs to push
up into the diaphragm. This increases the pres-
sure in the thorax to help expiration. The oblique
muscles also help rotation and ﬂexion of the
trunk.
. Transversus abdominis provides core support to
the trunk and is found deep to the internal ob-
lique muscle.
The anterior abdominal muscles are supplied
by the lower six intercostal nerves. The accompa-
nying arteries, veins and lymphatics run between
the internal oblique
muscle and transversus
abdominis.
The inguinal canal
The lower part of the abdominal wall covers the
anterior part of the pelvis. In this region, it contains
passages for the vessels of the gonads.
The inguinal canal stretches from the deep
inguinal ring to the superﬁcial inguinal ring. The
deep inguinal ring transmits the spermatic cord
in males and the round ligament in females; it is
found at the midpoint between the anterosuper-
ior iliac spine and pubic tubercle. The inferior
epigastric branch of the external iliac artery lies
medial to the deep ring. The superﬁcial inguinal
ring is located just above the pubic tubercle and
is formed by separation of the ﬁbres of the
aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. The
boundaries of the canal are:
. superiorly, transversus abdominis and internal
oblique
. inferiorly, the inguinal ligament
. anteriorly, the external oblique
. posteriorly, transversalis fascia.
CLINICAL Hernias
A hernia is any structure that passes through the
membrane or layer of muscle by which it should
be contained, thus ending up in the incorrect
place. It has three parts: the oriﬁce, hernial sac
and its contents. There are many types of hernia,
the most prevalent related to the abdomen
being:
. Inguinal hernias are the most common site of
herniation in the male because they are at a point
of weakness in the anterior abdominal wall; they
can be:
– direct: direct hernias protrude through the con-
joint tendon, so direct hernias are more com-
mon in older men because the conjoint tendon
is weaker
– indirect: indirect hernias pass through the su-
perﬁcial ring and out through the direct ring.
. Paraumbilical herniasform whenthereis a weak-
ness in the abdominal wall near to the umbilicus,
causing
an
outpouching
of
the
abdominal
contents.
A hiatus hernia is a protrusion of the superior part of
the stomach into the thorax through a weakness in
the diaphragm, which causes the patient to expe-
rience a feeling like heartburn in some cases.
The posterior abdominal wall
The posterior abdominal wall provides support
for
many
structures,
particularly
those
not
directly related to the GI tract, including the
kidneys, adrenal glands, abdominal aorta and
inferior vena cava, as well as important nerves
and lymphatics.
The structure of the posterior
abdominal wall
The posterior abdominal wall is composed of many
structures and their vasculature:
. Lumbar vertebrae and their associated muscles
and fascia
350
Anatomy

. The diaphragm, which is covered by peritoneum
on its abdominal side
. Psoas major
. Quadratus lumborus
. Iliacus.
The blood vessels of the posterior
and lateral abdominal walls
. The great vessels run on the posterior and lateral
walls of the abdomen and pelvis.
. The abdominal aorta supplies the abdomen and
lower limbs via its branches.
. The inferiorvena cava drains the veins of the pos-
terior wall and returns blood to the right atrium.
. Lymphatics drain into the cisterna chyli.
The abdominal aorta passes through the dia-
phragm as a continuation of the thoracic aorta. It
then splits at L4 into the two common iliac arter-
ies. Before its bifurcation, the abdominal aorta
gives of several branches (Fig. 14.38):
. Midline branches carry blood to the gut and its
associated structures. These include the coeliac
artery, superior mesenteric artery and inferior
mesenteric artery.
. Lateral branches, given off in pairs, supply or-
gans that develop embryologically from the in-
termediate mesoderm – the adrenals, kidneys
and gonads.
. Paired branches to the anterior and posterior
abdominal walls
. The median sacral artery supplies the fourth
and ﬁfth lumbar vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx and
posterior surface of the rectum.
The peritoneal cavity
and the peritoneum
The peritoneum is the membrane that encases the
peritoneal cavity, reducing friction between the
viscera and abdominal walls. The peritoneum is
located in the abdomen although it extends to
enclose some organs in the pelvis and is made up
of two layers. The parietal peritoneum lines the
walls of the cavity. Visceral peritoneum covers
many viscera partly or completely.

regions. These regions are delineated by the levels of L1–4 and a vertical line drawn from the point between the
anterosuperior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle.
Anatomy 351

The organs covered by the peritoneum are
suspended from the posterior abdominal wall
by a double layer of peritoneum known as the
mesentery, through which vessels and nerves
run. The organs that are partially covered by
peritoneum
have
‘bare
areas’
(uncovered
areas). These are fused with other structures
(Fig. 14.39).
The organs in the abdomen are described in
relation to their covering of peritoneum:
. Peritoneal organs are those that are covered
with visceral peritoneum (e.g. the stomach).
. Retroperitoneal organs are those that are par-
tially (or not at all) covered with peritoneum.
They can be further classed as:
– primarily retroperitoneal, when the organs
have not been covered in peritoneum at
any
point
during
development
(e.g.
the
kidneys)
– secondarily retroperitoneal, when the organs
initially developed with a peritoneal covering,
which was lost during development (e.g. the
descending and ascending colon).
The omentum
The peritoneal membrane is also organised into
two large folds – the omenta:
1 The greater omentum is a sheet of peritoneum
that hangs down from the greater curvature of
the stomach. The omentum folds back on itself
and attaches to the anterior surface of the trans-
verse colon.
2 The lesser omentum is a sheet of peritoneum
that is attached to the lesser curvature of the
stomach (forms the right border of the stomach
beneath the entry of the oesophagus; it passes
superiorly, backwards and laterally to the pylo-
rus). It stretches up to the undersurface of the
liver. It has a free edge on right-hand side which
carries the common bile duct, hepatic artery and
hepatic portal vein.
The gastrointestinal tract
The principle functions of the GI tract are
digestion and excretion. The GI tract starts with
the abdominal oesophagus. It then continues, in

supplying the adrenal glands (the suprarenal arteries), the kidneys (the renal arteries) and the gonads (the gonadal
arteries). In addition, single midline vessels that supply the gut arise, the coeliac artery, the superior mesenteric
artery and the inferior mesenteric artery supplying the fore-, mid- and hindgut, respectively.

Anatomy

order, as: the stomach, small intestine, large intes-
tine and rectum, and terminates at the anal canal
(Fig. 14.40).
The oesophagus
Theoesophagus isa musculartube thatcarries food
from the pharynx to the stomach. It passes through
the neck and thorax before entering the abdomen
anterior to T10, piercing the diaphragm to the left of
the midline, before rapidly meeting the stomach.
The gastro-oesophageal junction is where it
forms an acute angle with the fundus of the stom-
ach to its left, creating the cardiac sphincter, which
is a physiological sphincter. The sphincter pre-
vents reﬂux of the gastric contents back into the
oesophagus.
DEFINITION Physiological sphincters
Physiological sphincters prevent the movement of a
substance between two regions of a tube. However,
such sphincters do not contain developed rings or
thickening in the muscle.
The stomach
The stomach is the most dilated part of the
GI tract with an adult capacity of 1.5 L. The
stomach stores, sterilises, macerates and starts
digestion of food before releasing it into the
small intestine. The stomach has a curved
shape – the small lesser curvature on the an-
terior aspect and the greater curvature along
the posterior surface. The stomach is covered by
peritoneum, the anterior surface of the stomach
being covered by the peritoneum of the greater
sac whereas the posterior surface is covered by
peritoneum of the lesser sac. At the greater
curvature the peritoneal sheets unite to form
a double-layered sheet, which leaves the lower
part of the greater curvature of the stomach as
the greater omentum.
The stomach is divided into four regions, from
proximal to distal (Fig. 14.41):
1 The cardiac region

3 The body
4 The pyloric region.

Figure 14.39 Cross-section of the abdominal cavity: the main portion of the abdomen is contained within the
peritoneal cavity located at anteriorly to the abdomen. The great vessels, vertebrae and other retroperitoneal
structures are located posteriorly. The omenta, which encases the stomach, divides the peritoneal cavity into the
greater and lesser sacs, which meet at the epiploic foramen, the anterior edge of which is deﬁned by the portal triad
contained in the lesser omentum.
Anatomy 353

The mucosa in different regions of the stomach
is specialised according to its function:
. The cardiac region contains mucus-secreting
glands which protect the stomach epithelia from
digesting itself.
. The fundus and body contains gastric glands.
These secrete acid and pepsin, a digestive en-
zyme that breaks down proteins. The muscularis
propria in the fundus and body contains an extra
inner oblique layer of muscle, enabling folds to
form in the mucosa.
. The pyloric region contains branched glands
that produce mucus and gastrin. The mucus
protects the gastroduodenal junction from acid
and pepsin, and lubricates the passage of chyme.
Food enters the duodenum through the pylorus,
which is situated just to the right of the midline,
halfway between the suprasternal notch and the
pubic symphysis. It crosses the tip of the ninth
costal cartilage and the lower border of L1.
The small intestine
The small intestine completes digestion, neu-
tralises acid and is the principal absorptive site
of the GI tract. It stretches from the pyloric
sphincter to the ileocaecal junction. In adults,
the combined length of the small intestine is
approximately 280 cm and it consists of three
parts – the duodenum, jejunum and ileum –
which differ subtly, reﬂecting their different
specialisations.
The small intestines possess specialisations to
increase the surface area available for absorption

Anatomy

The duodenum
The duodenum is the ﬁrst part of the small
intestine, receiving the chyme released from
the pyloric sphincter. Initially, the duodenum
is covered with peritoneum, but distal to the
duodenal papilla it is retroperitoneal. The papil-
la is surrounded by the sphincter of Oddi
where the hepatopancreatic ampulla enters the
duodenum, which creates a C-shaped loop
around the head of the pancreas and is divided
into four parts (Fig. 14.42).
The jejunum
The jejunum is a continuation of the duode-
num. It starts at the duodenojejunal ﬂexure,
where the suspensory ligament (of Trietz) con-
nects the small intestine to the diaphragm.
The jejunum and ileum are suspended from
the posterior abdominal wall by small bowel
mesentery. The mesentery is a folded layer of
peritoneum which runs from the duodenojeju-
nal ﬂexure to the right iliac fossa, and contains
all the vessels and nerves supplying the small
bowel.
The ileum
The ileum is continuous with the jejunum. Differ-
entiation relies on notable distinctions between
the two (Table 14.8).

Figure 14.41 The stomach is a dilated portion of the gastrointestinal tract. It is located on the left side of abdomen,
and has a curving course, resulting in the formation of the lesser and greater curvatures, along which the blood
vessels lie – all of which are derived from the coeliac artery. The stomach can be divided into regions – the body and
fundus make up the larger portion of the stomach, whereas food enters superiorly at the cardiac region through the
oesophagus. The food is processed into chyme in the stomach and released through the pyloric sphincter into the
small intestine.

Anatomy 355

The large intestine
The large bowel stretches from the ileocaecal junc-
tion to the anorectal junction. Many of the specia-
lisations of the large intestine are the result of its
primary functions of reabsorbing water to produce
faeces and moving faeces through the GI tract for
expulsion:
. A thick muscular wall for powerful propulsion
. Predominance of goblet cells which secrete mu-
cus for lubrication
. Many crypts, closely packed straight tubular
glands, with a large surface area for absorption
. Taeniae coli: the longitudinal layer of muscle of
muscularis propria forms three separate longi-
tudinal bands, apart from in the rectum, which
helps peristalsis.
The small and large intestines have character-
istics essential to their function; these help their
differentiation (Table 14.9).
The large intestine can be divided anatomically.
Many of these regions have speciﬁc functions
which are continuous, though blood supply and
innervation differs in many cases. From proximal
to distal, there are ﬁve parts of the large intestine
(Fig. 14.43):

Anatomy

DEFINITION Haustrations
These are sacculations (outpouchings) of the wall of
the large intestine. As each haustration ﬁlls it stimu-
lates contraction, forcing the contents on to the next
haustration.
DEFINITION Appendices epiploicae
These are small tags of peritoneum ﬁlled with fat that
do not appear to have a deﬁned function. They are
typically attached to the transverse and sigmoid
colon, although they can also be found in the upper
part of the rectum.
The caecum
The
caecum
is
the
ﬁrst
part
of
the
large
intestine. It is blind ended and dilated, starting
at the ileocaecal junction. The ileum passes into
the posteromedial wall of the caecum, entering
as a horizontal slit surrounded by two folds
of mucosa, which form a valve to prevent
backﬂow.
The appendix
The appendix is a blind-ended tube that opens into
the medial wall of the caecum. In humans, the
appendix has no signiﬁcant function, although it
may become inﬂamed in appendicitis.

humans;itisalsocontinuouswiththeascendingcolon.Foodtravelsalongtheascending,transverseanddescending
colons, to reach the sigmoid colon, which is continuous with the rectum. It is in the rectum that faeces are stored until
release through the anus. The transverse colon is the site where the midgut (supplied by the superior mesenteric
artery) meets the hindgut (supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery), reﬂecting different embryonic origins.
Anatomy 357

The colon
The colon forms the major length of the large intes-
tine, taking a looping course around much of the
anterioroftheabdomen.Itisdividedintofourparts:
1 The ascending colon travels from the right iliac
fossa to the hepatic ﬂexure which is located
beneath the right lobe of the liver and is com-
monly attached to the posterior abdominal wall.
2 The transverse colon extends from the hepatic
to the splenic ﬂexure. The splenic ﬂexure is the
area of the colon in contact with the left kidney,
tail of the pancreas, spleen and greater curvature
of the stomach. The transverse colon has its own
mesentery, the transverse mesocolon. Both the
transverse colon and mesocolon are covered by
the greater omentum.
3 The descending colon travels from the splenic
ﬂexure to the left iliac fossa. It is commonly
retroperitoneal, i.e. attached to the posterior
abdominal wall.
4 Thesigmoidcolonpassesfrom the leftiliac fossa
to the rectum. The rectum usually begins at S3. It
has its own mesentery, the sigmoid mesocolon.
The rectum
Faeces are temporarily stored in the rectum, before
they are expelled through the anus. The rectum
runs from the end of the sigmoid colon to the
anorectal junction, where it passes through levator
ani, a muscle responsible for supporting the pelvic
organs. It is a midline structure that passes along
the concave surface of the sacrum and coccyx.
Only the upper third of the rectum is covered in
peritoneum.Theperitoneumtravelsforwardsfrom
the middle third of the rectum, on to the bladder in
males, and the vagina and uterus in females. This
formstherectovesicalpouchorrectouterinepouch
in males and females, respectively.
The anal canal
The anal canal is the passage through which faeces
pass out of the body. It runs from the anorectal
junction inferiorly and posteriorly to the anus.
The vasculature of the alimentary
tract
The vessels that supply different parts of the ali-
mentary tract in the abdomen relate to the embry-
ological origins of the different areas:
. The coeliac artery and its branches supply the
derivatives of the foregut: the foregut comprises
the GI tract up to the duodenal papilla, i.e. pre-
dominantly the stomach and duodenum.
. The superior mesenteric artery and its branches
supply the structures originating as the midgut:
the midgut comprises the structures from the
duodenal papilla to the splenic ﬂexure.
. The inferior mesenteric artery supplies the
structures originating as the hindgut: the hindgut
stretches from the splenic ﬂexure to the upper
part of the anal canal.
The coeliac artery
This branch of the aorta originates at the level of
T12 and supplies the foregut, including the liver,
spleen and pancreas. It splits immediately to three
major branches (Fig. 14.44):
. The left gastric artery ascends to supply the
lower part of the oesophagus, before passing
along the lesser curvature of the stomach, anas-
tomosing with the right gastric artery – a branch
of the hepatic artery.
. The hepatic artery directly supplies the pylorus
of the stomach before giving rise to numerous
branches. Its main branches are the right
gastric
artery
and
gastroduodenal
artery,
which arise near the pylorus. The right gastric
artery
anastomoses
with
the
left
gastric
artery to supply to the lesser curvature of
the stomach, whereas the gastroduodenal ar-
tery further divides into the right gastroepiploic
artery and superior pancreaticoduodenal ar-
tery. The right gastroepiploic artery supplies the
greater curvature of the stomach. The pancrea-
ticoduodenal artery supplies both the pancreas
and part of the duodenum before the duodenal
papilla.
. The splenic artery directly supplies part of both
the abdominal wall and the pancreas although its
branches supply the stomach fundus and greater
curvature of the stomach. The splenic artery
passes along the posterior abdominal wall via
the superior aspect of the pancreas. At the ter-
minal point of the tail of the pancreas, it divides
into the short gastric arteries and the left gastro-
epiploic artery. The short gastric arteries supply
the stomach fundus. The left gastroepiploic ar-
tery anastomoses with the right gastroepiploic
artery to supply the greater curvature of the
stomach.
358
Anatomy

The superior mesenteric artery
The superior mesenteric artery supplies the
midgut-derived structures. It branches from
the aorta anterior to L1, posterior to the neck
of the pancreas, and crosses the third part of
the duodenum to enter the small bowel mes-
entery. It forms many anastomosing branches
(Fig. 14.45):
. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a
single artery that branches off almost instantly
and supplies the duodenum and head of the
pancreas.
. Many jejunal and ileal branches enter the mes-
entery where they anastomose to form arcades.
Terminal branches from these supply the wall of
the bowel.
. The ileocolic artery travels to the right iliac fossa,
supplying the terminal ileum and the caecum.
The ileocolic artery gives off two main branches:
– the right colic artery which crosses the pos-
terior abdominal wall below the peritoneum to
supply the ascending colon
– the middle colic artery which enters the trans-
verse mesocolon and supplies the remainder
of the midgut.
The inferior mesenteric artery
Theinferiormesentericarterysuppliesthehindgut-
derived bowel, which runs from the splenic ﬂexure
totheupperpartoftheanalcanal. Itoriginatesfrom
the aorta opposite L3 and travels downward and
laterally to the left iliac fossa, and along its course it
gives off anastomosing branches (Fig. 14.46):
. The left colic artery which supplies the splenic
ﬂexure and the descending colon.
. The sigmoid arteries which pass into the sig-
moid mesocolon to supply the sigmoid colon.
. The superior rectal artery.
The arterial supply of the rectum and
anal canal
The arterial supply differs along its length:
. The upper two-thirds of the rectal mucosa
and muscle are supplied by the superior rectal
artery.
. The lower third of the rectum is supplied by the
middle rectal branch of the internal iliac artery.
. The anal canal is supplied by the inferior rectal
arteries, which are derived from the internal
pudendal branch of the internal iliac artery.

Figure 14.44 The coeliac trunk supplies the abdominal structures derived from the foregut. The coeliac trunk arises
at the level of T12–L1 and provides three major branches: the splenic, hepatic and left gastric arteries.
Anatomy 359

The venous drainage of the GI tract
The veins draining the GI tract empty into the
hepatic portal vein which is formed at the junction
of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins, and
then runs superiorly posterior to the ﬁrst part of the
duodenum and then to the liver (Fig. 14.47).
The venous drainage of the rectum
The rectum is drained partially by the inferior
mesenteric vein and partly by the middle and infe-
rior rectal veins. Due to the dual drainage by the
portal and systemic circulations, an increase in pres-
sure in the portal system will create anastomoses
between the veins causingthem to dilate (Fig. 14.48).
The lymphatic drainage of the GI tract
Lymphatic vessels follow a similar course to the
arteries, although in the opposite direction,
emptying into the coeliac, superior mesenteric
or inferior mesenteric preaortic nodes, which
are
found
at
the
origin
of
the
respective
vessels.
In addition, lymph from parts of the anal canal
drains into inguinal lymph nodes.
The autonomic innervation of the
GI tract
Sympathetic innervation to the foregut deriva-
tives arises from the coeliac plexus. The coe-
liac plexus is a group of ganglion cells formed
from
the
preganglionic
thoracic
splanchnic
nerves. Postganglionic ﬁbres travel along the
arteries to the stomach and duodenum. The

Figure 14.45 The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) supplies the abdominal structures derived from the midgut. It
arises from the aorta at the level of L1 and passes behind the neck of the pancreas to the right iliac fossa, providing
branches to the ileum and jejunum. The SMA gives rise to the right and middle colic arteries which supply parts of the
colon.
360
Anatomy

The innervation regulates blood ﬂow to the
tissues:
. The sympathetic system causes constriction of
the blood vessels to reduce ﬂow to the gut.
. The parasympathetic effect is dominant; during
digestion, blood ﬂow to the gut is maximised.
The parasympathetic supply is mainly from the
vagus nerve (CN X).
The histology of the GI tract
The GI tract is lined by mucous membrane which
shows area-speciﬁc modiﬁcations corresponding
to the particular region’s function: ingestion,
fragmentation, digestion, absorption or elimina-
tion of waste products. The histological features of
the GI tract and their adaptation to function are
covered in Chapter 8.

vessels, which supply the upper portion of the rectum. The inferior part of the rectum is supplied by the inferior rectal
artery, which is a branch of the pudendal artery.

both to aid digestion and to contribute to the
blood:
. Plasma protein production
. Mediator of carbohydrate/lipid/protein meta-
bolism
. Removal of particulate matter from the blood
by macrophages (in this location they are known
as Kupffer’s cells)
. Bile production: bile is sent via the biliary tract to
the duodenum.

Figure 14.47 The portal circulation: the portal vessels drain the blood from the lower part of the oesophagus to the
superior rectal veins of the large intestine. The blood drains into the portal vein, which carries it to the liver, where
absorbed nutrients are processed. The portal circulation is distinct from the systemic venous system, although it
forms anastomoses with the systemic circulation in the rectum and the oesophagus.
DEFINITION Porta hepatis
The porta hepatis is the entry point for the hepatic
portal vein, hepatic artery, common hepatic duct,
lymphatics and several nerves. It is also known as
the transverse ﬁssure of the liver and divides the
caudate and the quadrate lobes. It is 5 cm long and
extends across the inferior surface of the left side of
the liver’s right lobe. At the porta hepatis the vessels
are organised to ensure efﬁcient supply to the divi-
sions of the liver.
362
Anatomy

The position and structure of the liver
The liver lies beneath the right dome of the dia-
phragm and lower ribs. Its narrow apex extends
leftwards to the fundus of the stomach, where it is
protected by the right lower ribs. The liver occupies
most of the right hypochondrium and part of the
epigastrium and left hypochondrium (Fig. 14.49).
The liver has distinct anatomical and functional
structures:
. Anatomically the liver is divided into four ‘lobes’;
these can be seen on the inferior surface of the
liver as four distinct regions.
. Functionally, the liver can be divided into two
halves – the left and right – which are not discern-
able anatomically. The right lobe is bigger than
the left, with each lobe divided into four seg-
ments.Each segment hasits own vasculature and
biliary drainage.
Ligamentous attachments
The liver is secured by two major ligaments:
. The falciform ligament is a reﬂection of perito-
neum on to the anterior abdominal wall above

Figure 14.48 Vasculature of the rectum: the rectum is supplied by the superior, middle and inferior rectal arteries.
The superior rectal artery is derived from the inferior mesenteric artery, the middle rectal artery from the internal
inferior vesical and the inferior rectal artery from the internal pudendal artery; it supplies primarily the anal canal.
Similarly the rectum is drained by the superior rectal veins, which drain into the portal system, whereas the middle
and inferior rectal veins drain into the systemic circulation via the internal iliac and internal pudenal veins,
respectively. In the rectum the venous systems are anastomosed which can cause the formation of varicosities
if portal hypertension occurs. These can be a signiﬁcant source of bleeding.
CLINICAL Portal hypertension
Portal hypertension refers to high blood pressure
in the portal system. Patients have portal hyper-
tension most commonly as a result of liver cir-
rhosis, although many other conditions may be
the cause, such as portal vein thrombosis, right
heart
failure
and,
in
tropical
countries,
schistosomiasis.
Portal hypertension leads to dilated varices at the
sites of portosystemic anastomoses, which are at
risk of rupturing and bleeding. Common sites
include:
. The oesophagus where the left gastric and oe-
sophageal veins unite
. The rectoanal junction where the superior and
middle rectal veins anastomose
. The umbilicus where small veins travelling with
ligamentum teres join with the anterior abdominal
wall veins
. The attachment of the retroperitoneal bowel
where bowel veins unite with those of the posterior
abdominal wall.
Anatomy 363

the umbilicus, which extends from the anterior
surface of the liver. The falciform ligament di-
vides the liver into the anatomical left and right
lobes anteriorly.
. The ligamentum teres is the remnant of the left
umbilical vein. It divides the left lobe of the liver
in the lateral and medial parts.
The vessels of the liver
The liver receives oxygenated blood from the he-
patic artery and nutrient-rich blood from the GI
tract via the hepatic portal vein, both of which
enter through the porta hepatis. The hepatic veins
drain both blood supplies directly into the inferior
vena cava.
The innervation of the liver
Sympathetic and parasympathetic ﬁbres pass
through the porta hepatis to innervate the
liver.

the rest of the anterior surface of the liver and forms the falciform ligament. (b) The posterior surface of the liver
receives the portal triad, consisting of the portal vein, hepatic arteries and common bile duct. In addition the
gallbladder is located on the posterior aspect of the liver. The coronary ligament is made up of the reﬂected layers of
the mesentery and surrounds the inferior vena cava, which drains the blood from both the hepatic arteries and the
portal circulation.
364
Anatomy

The biliary tract and gallbladder
Bile is produced by the liver for emulsiﬁcation of
fats and excretion of some products. It can be
secreted into the intestine at meal times, or stored
and concentrated in the gallbladder, located on the
undersurface of the liver.
Bile passes out of the liver through the hepatic
duct. It then passes either straight into the com-
mon bile duct to enter the duodenum through
the sphincter of Oddi or into the gallbladder for
storage. Bile is released postprandially from the
gallbladder, and then travels down the cystic
duct to the common bile duct, which is formed
when the cystic duct unites with the hepatic
duct at the upper end of the lesser omentum
(Fig. 14.50).
The pancreas
The pancreas has important exocrine and endo-
crine functions. The exocrine portion secretes its
products into the GI tract to help digestion, where-
as the endocrine portion secretes hormones di-
rectly into the bloodstream and is discussed in
Chapters 8 and 10.
The morphology of the pancreas
The pancreas crosses from the concavity of the
duodenum, anterior to the inferior vena cava, to
the spleen across the posterior abdominal wall.
The exocrine secretions are carried by the pancre-
atic duct which runs out of the head of the pancreas
(Fig. 14.51). Anatomically, the pancreas is divided
into ﬁve sections:
1 The head lies in the concavity of the duodenum
anteriortotheinferiorvenacava.Itissuppliedby
the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal
arteries which are tributaries of the coeliac and
superior mesenteric arteries, respectively.
2 The uncinate process extends to the neck, sep-
arated by the superior mesenteric vessels.

Figure 14.50 The biliary tree is responsible for the transport of bile. Bile is produced in the liver, and drains from the
right and left hepatic ducts which are formed by the progressive union of biliary canaliculi. The hepatic ducts then
unite to form the common hepatic duct. At most times the bile is diverted via the cystic duct where it is stored in the
gallbladder, and concentrated until needed. The bile is drained into the gut via the common bile duct which enters
the duodenum at the ampulla. The common bile duct merges with the pancreatic duct immediately before draining
into the gut.
Anatomy 365

3 The neck lies over the portal vein and the com-
mon bile duct.
4 The body crosses the aorta, the left adrenal gland
and the left kidney.
5 The tail stretches to the spleen. The tail of the
pancreas is supplied by the large splenic artery, a
principal branch of the coeliac artery.
The pancreas is supplied by the splenic artery,
superior mesenteric artery and gastroduodenal
artery, and blood drains into the portal vein, which
passes close behind the pancreas.
The spleen
The spleen is formed from highly vascular matter
encapsulated by a ﬁbrous casing and a layer of
visceral peritoneum; although it does not con-
tribute to the function of the GI tract, the spleen
is discussed here, because it is located in the
abdomen. The spleen is kidney shaped and
found in the left hypochondrium below the ninth
to eleventh ribs and is in contact with the dia-
phragm and most other neighbouring structures.
The spleen contains two types of tissue – red and
white pulp:
. The red pulp contains macrophages that remove
old/damaged blood cells and particulate matter.
. The white pulp contains many leukocytes which
are responsible for the production of immune
responses to antigens in the blood.
The splenic artery, a branch of the coeliac artery,
supplies the spleen, whereas it is drained by the
splenic vein, which contributes to the portal sys-
tem. Lymphatics follow the blood vessels and drain
into nodes around the coeliac trunk, at the level of
the T12 vertebral body.
The urinary system
The urinary system is responsible for the excre-
tion of waste products and the conservation of
water and essential ions. It is located predomi-
nantly in the pelvis and consists of two kidneys,
two
ureters,
the
bladder
and
the
urethra
(Fig. 14.52). The mechanisms by which the uri-
nary system achieves these function are discussed
in Chapter 9.
The kidneys
The kidneys balance the excretion of waste pro-
ducts with the conservation of water and vital ions.

Anatomy

The kidneys receive a generous blood supply
from the renal arteries, which allows it to sense
the blood volume and composition and respond
accordingly.
The position of the kidneys
The kidneys are retroperitoneal and lie on the pos-
terior abdominal wall in the paravertebral gutters,
either side of the vertebrae. The left kidney ishigher
than the right (due to the presence of the liver). The
upperpolesofthekidneyarefoundatthelevelofthe
eleventh rib, on the left, and the twelfth rib, on the
right. The kidneys are obliquely oriented, with their
medial borders anterior to lateral borders.
The structure of the kidneys
Each kidney is enclosed in a thin capsule, with
access occurring only at the hilum of each kidney.
The hilum is found on the medial border of the
kidney and carries (from anterior to posterior):
. The renal vein
. The renal artery with associated autonomic
nerves and lymphatics
. The pelvis of the ureter.
If the kidney is cut vertically in cross-section three
internal layers can be identiﬁed:

masses(knownaspyramids),theapicesofwhich

3 Collectingtubulesdrainingtofrom7–13funnel-
shaped minor calyces. These form two to three
major calyces that drain into the pelvis.
The precise histology and function of each part
of the kidneys are described in Chapter 13.
The vasculature of the kidneys
The renal arteries supply the kidney. The left
artery is short and wide; the right artery is longer
because it travels behind the inferior vena cava to
arrive at the right kidney. Both arteries split into
roughly ﬁve segmental branches before entering
the hila of the kidneys. These, in turn, branch into
progressively smaller vessels, leading to the pro-
duction of many afferent arterioles, each one sup-
plying a single glomerulus.

wall of the abdomen. They are supplied by the renal arteries which arise from the aorta at the level of L1. The renal
arteries enter the kidney at the hilum, immediately posterior to the renal veins, which drain directly into the inferior
vena cava. The ureters drain urine from the kidneys, and course through the abdomen to reach the bladder in the
pelvis. Urine is stored in the bladder until it can be voided when it is released through the urethra. The bladder can
easily expand to contain a large volume of urine and is located in the base of the pelvis on the anterior wall.
Anatomy 367

The venous drainage of the kidneys is through the
renal veins which drain into the inferior vena cava:
. The right renal vein drains directly into the in-
ferior vena cava.
. The left renal vein passes anterior to the aorta
before entering the inferior vena cava.
The adrenal glands
The adrenal glands secrete several hormones into
the bloodstream. One is located on each of the
superior poles of the kidneys. The adrenal glands
are composed of two distinct regions:
1 Theadrenalmedullaisthesiteofadrenalineand
noradrenaline synthesis, as part of the sympa-
thetic nervous response
2 The adrenal cortex produces the corticosteroid
hormones:
– aldosterone has a role in water and electrolyte
concentration
– cortisol is involved in the stress response
– androgen has a role in sexual function.
The ureters
The ureters are the narrow muscular tubes that
carry urine from the kidney to the bladder. The
course of the ureters is long and they pass over
many prominent structures. Each ureter travels
downwards on psoas from the renal pelvis to the
pelvic brim. At the sacroiliac joint, each ureter
crosses the bifurcation of the common iliac artery
to travel on the side wall of the pelvis. At the level of
the ischial spine, each ureter passes forward and
medially in the fascia of the pelvic ﬂoor to arrive at
the lateral angle of the bladder.
Each ureter enters the bladder at an oblique
angle. The ureters enter the bladder at the trigone,
a region on the posteroinferior part of the bladder
wall. The oblique entry acts as a valve to prevent
reﬂux up the ureters when the pressure within the
bladder is increased – as in voiding.
The structure and function
of the bladder
The bladder is a hollow, muscular, distensible
organ for short-term storage of urine. Its super-
ior surface (fundus) reaches from the apex
(which rests behind the pubic symphysis) to the
ureters. The posterior surface (base) of the blad-
der continues from the two ureters downwards
to the internal urethral oriﬁce. Finally, the two
triangular side walls join in the midline from the
apex to the internal urethral oriﬁce. This struc-
ture is adapted to its function (Fig. 14.53):
. Grossly: the fundus has the capacity to ex-
pand upwards as the bladder ﬁlls. The peri-
toneum loosely covers it so that it can enlarge.
Ligaments pass from the pubic symphysis
to the bladder neck and facilitate urinary
continence.
. Internally: the mucosa, lining the fundus, has
multiple folds to enable expansion. The trigone is
the exception because its mucosa is not thrown
into folds and thus is unable to expand.
. Oriﬁces of the bladder: the muscular wall of
the bladder is adapted to expel urine through
the internal urethral oriﬁce effectively. It does
this by increasing pressure in the bladder and
also by altering its shape to form a funnel.
In contrast, the ureteric oriﬁces enter the

Figure 14.53 The bladder consists of various parts. In
particular the trigone is located at the posterior wall of
the bladder and is of a different embryological origin to
the rest of the bladder. The main portion of the bladder
constitutes the fundus, with the apex located inferiorly
and the base located superiorly. The ureters enter the
bladder at the superior corners of the trigone; they enter
at an oblique angle to prevent the reﬂux of urine when
the pressure is high inside the bladder. The urethra
drains the bladder, and carries urine for voiding – the
ﬂow of urine from the bladder is regulated by the urinary
sphincters.

The urethra
Urine leaves the bladder through the urethra.
Due to the differences in pelvic anatomy, the
urethra runs different courses in the different sexes
(Fig. 14.54).
The female urethra
The female urethra is short and passes inferiorly
and anteriorly from the bladder neck to the exter-
nal urethral oriﬁce. A voluntary external urethral
sphincter encircles the urethra before it passes
through the perineal membrane. The urethra is
ﬁxed to the anterior wall of the vagina and its
external oriﬁce appears anteroposteriorly superior
to the vagina.

Figure 14.54 The urethra: the course of the urethra differs considerable between the sexes, on account of the
differing structures in the male and female pelvis. The female pelvis contains the uterus, located between the
bladder and the rectum. The peritoneum forms two pouches between these structures – the uterovesical pouch and
the rectouterine pouch. The female urethra is short, linking the bladder rapidly with the external environment. In the
male pelvis the bladder and the rectum are separated by the rectouterine pouch, which is lined by the peritoneum.
The male urethra is a much longer structure which passes through the prostate immediately on leaving the bladder,
and then exits the body at the end of the penis.
Anatomy 369

CLINICAL Cystitis
Cystitis is an infection of the bladder. It is extremely
common; 2.5% of a GP practice population will
consult with an infection every year.
Cystitis is more common in females than males
due to the short length of the female urethra com-
pared with the male one. Commonly, cystitis is due
to infection with Escherichia coli. The common man-
agement is antibiotic treatment, such as nitrofuran-
toin or co-trimoxazole.
The male urethra
The male urethra is longer than the female one and
extends from the bladder neck to the end of the
penis. Anatomically, it can be broken down into
four discrete parts:
1 The preprostatic urethra is continuous with the
neckofthebladderandcontinuestothesuperior
part of the prostate.
2 The prostatic urethra is the widest, most dilat-
able part or the urethra. It passes down through
theprostate.Theprostaticandejaculatoryducts,
which carry components of the seminal ﬂuid,
enter the urethra in the prostatic region.
3 The membranous urethra is the shortest, least
dilatable part of the urethra. It starts at the lower
end of the prostate, being continuous with the
prostatic urethra. It is surrounded by the volun-
tary external urethral sphincter, and two bul-
bourethral glands lie on either side of it. The
prostatic urethra travels through the pelvic ﬂoor
and the perineal membrane before becoming
the penile urethra.
4 The penile urethra starts below the perineal
membrane and is surrounded by the corpus
spongiosum. It is dilated in the region into which
the ducts of the bulbourethral glands enter. The
urethra passes through the glans penis to the
external urethral oriﬁce.
The lymph of the male urethra drains with the
lymph of the tissues of the penis.
The vasculature of the urethra
The urethra receives an arterial supply from
branches of the internal pudendal artery which is
a terminal branch of the internal iliac. The puden-
dal artery leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic
foramen, entering the gluteal region. Next it curves
around the sacrospinous ligament before passing
through the lesser sciatic foramen to supply the
perineum.
The pudendal vein runs with the pudendal artery
and pudendal nerve in the pudendal canal, and
empties into the internal iliac vein.
The reproductive system
The reproductive system is located in the pelvis. As
the reproductive organs vary between the sexes,
this is reﬂected in the structure of the pelvic bones,
which are adapted for function.
The muscles and ligaments
of the pelvis
The soft tissues of the pelvis are adapted not only
for reproduction but also for weight transference.
Therefore, ligaments, muscles and other soft-tis-
sue structures complement the pelvic bones to
form the walls of the pelvis.
Levator ani is the muscular septum that forms
the ﬂoor of the pelvis; itis suspended from the walls
of the pelvis. It is essential for control of both
urinary and faecal continence.
The muscles of the pelvis insert into the ﬁbrous
perineal body which is found between the anal
and urogenital openings in the perineum. The
perineal body isthe attachment site for the external
anal sphincter, levator ani, the bulbospongiosus
muscle and the superﬁcial transverse perineal
muscles, and it is crucial to maintain control of
the pelvic ﬂoor.
Several structures support the internal struc-
tures of the pelvis:
. The broad ligament is a fold of peritoneum (not a
ligament) that connects the uterus to the walls
and ﬂoor of the pelvis.
. The round ligament maintains the uterus in an
anteverted position.
. The ovarian ligament connects each ovary to the
uterus at the uterotubal junction. It travels be-
tween the layers of the broad ligament.
. The suspensory ligament is a fold of peritoneum
(not a ligament) that extends from each ovary to
the wall of the pelvis and conveys the ovarian
artery, ovarian vein and ovarian plexus.
. The cardinal ligament supports the cervix and
the vault and lateral fornix of the vagina.
370
Anatomy

The perineum
The perineum is the superﬁcial tissue found
below the pelvic outlet, between the legs. It con-
nects the outﬂow tracts of the urinary and faecal
systems and is also the site of the external genitalia.
The perineum is diamond shaped and stretches
from the pubic symphysis to the coccyx. It is
divided into two triangles by a line drawn trans-
versely anterior to the two ischial tuberosities.
The anterior part is sexually differentiated whereas
the posterior part is the same in both sexes
(Fig. 14.55).

posterior perineum contains the anal region and has a similar structure between the two sexes.
Anatomy 371

The urogenital triangle
The urogenital triangle is bound by the pubic
symphysis anteriorly and the two ischiopubic rami
posteriorly. The urogenital triangle is divided into
superﬁcial and deep fascial compartments which
are divided by the perineal membrane. The peri-
neal membrane is composed of ﬁbrous tissue and
crosses from one ischiopubic ramus to the other. It
is attached to levator ani, posteriorly, in the mid-
line, at the perineal body. The perineal membrane
is a less discrete layer in females than in males.
The male urogenital triangle
The superﬁcial perineal pouch lies superﬁcial to
the perineal membrane and is derived from the
membranous layer of superﬁcial fascia of the an-
terior abdominal wall. The superﬁcial pouch con-
tains the root of the penis and its muscles, vessels,
nerves, the testis, epididymis and vas (see Chapter
12). Branches of the pudendal artery supply the
penis whereas the dorsal veins drain it. The penis is
innervated by the pudendal nerve.
Deep to the perineal membrane is a potential
space,
unlike
the
superﬁcial
pouch,
that
is
completely enclosed. Posteriorly, the deep perine-
al pouch is continuous with the ischiorectal fossa.
Anteriorly, it is continuous with superﬁcial peri-
neal pouch a through slim opening between the
perineal membrane and pubic symphysis. Its roof
is formed from levator ani which passes laterally
around the inferior aspect of the prostate to join
the perineal body. The membranous urethra is
found between the perineal membrane and the
pelvic ﬂoor, surrounded by the external urethral
sphincter. The bulbourethral glands are positioned
either side of membranous urethra, their ducts
piercing the bulb of the urethra.
The female urogenital triangle
The female urogenital triangle is where the urethra
exits and the vagina enters, the vagina passing
through the perineal membrane between the per-
ineal body and the urethra:
. There is no superﬁcial perineal pouch in the
female.
. Deep to the perineal membrane, the urethra and
external urethral sphincter are attached to the
anterior wall of the vagina.
The urethra and the vagina pierce levator ani and
the perineal membrane, and open directly on to
skin of the anterior triangle.
The female urogenital triangle contains several
structures:
. The entrance of the urethra
. The vagina
. The labiaminora which are two small cutaneous
folds that form both the lateral and the anterior
boundaries of the vestibule. They are attached,
and surround, the clitoris, at the anterior border
. The clitoris: two masses of erectile tissue, the
bulbs of the vestibule, unite; these are homolo-
gues of the male corpus spongiosum
. The labia majora, which are fat-ﬁlled cutaneous
folds that run inferiorly and posteriorly away from
the mons pubis. The mons pubis is the fatty em-
inence, directly above the pubic symphysis. The
labia majora protect the vestibular glands (com-
parable to the bulbourethral glands of the male).
The blood vessels and nerves
of the urogenital triangle
The urogenital triangle is supplied by the internal
pudendal artery and pudendal nerve (S2, -3, -4)
and drained by the pudendal vein. In the male, the
deep and superﬁcial dorsal veins drain the penis;
these empty into the saphenous vein.
Most of the lymph passes with the pudendal
artery to the internal iliac nodes. In the male, the
lymph from the skin and fascia of the penis and
scrotum drains to the superﬁcial inguinal nodes.
The male genital system
The male genital system produces gametes and
transfers them to the female. The scrotum encases
the sperm-making apparatus: the testes, epididy-
mis and vas deferens. The seminal vesicles and
prostate produce chemicals to prime the sperm for
delivery and the urethra provides a vehicle to
transport them.
The scrotum
The scrotum is a pouch of skin that holds the testes
and epididymis outside the body because the op-
timum conditions for sperm production is lower
than the core body temperature.
The cremaster muscle, derived from the internal
oblique muscle of the abdominal wall, is able to
induce depression and elevation of the scrotum,
to adjust its temperature. The cremaster is inner-
vated by the genital branch of the genitofemoral
nerve (L2).
372
Anatomy

The testes
The testes produce male gametes and sex hor-
mones. Each testis is an oval body with a superior
and inferior pole covered by derivatives of the
serous, muscular and ﬁbrous layers of the abdo-
men as aresult of the journey that theymake before
birth. It is composed of numerous seminiferous
tubules lined with spermatogenic epithelium.
These tubules form the vasa efferentia from which
sperm move to the vas deferens and then to the
head of the epididymis (Fig. 14.56).
The testes are suspended in the scrotum by the
spermatic cord, a cable-like structure that runs
from the abdomen to each testicle. The spermatic
cord is covered by layers of muscle derived from
the abdominal wall: the internal spermatic fascia,
cremaster and external spermatic fascia. Inside the
inguinal canal, the spermatic cord travels along-
side the ilioinguinal nerve and the genital branch of
the genitofemoral nerve. The spermatic cord
contains:
. the vas deferens with its arterial and lymphatic
supply
. remnants of the processus vaginalis
. the testicular vessels, lymphatics and sympa-
thetic nerves.
The testes release sperm into the epididymis,
a series of coiled tubes that descend the testes.
The epididymis continues inferiorly with the vas
deferens, which conveys sperm to the ejaculatory
ducts.
The testicular vessels
. The testicular artery supplies the testis and the
epididymis. It arises from the aorta just below the
level of the renal arteries at L2.
. The testicular veins form a network, the pampi-
niform plexus, which maintains temperature
control of the testes to keep them at 1 below
that of the rest of the body. It does this by
surrounding the spermatic cord, thus cooling the
incoming arterial blood. The right testicular vein
drains directly into the inferior vena cava. The
left, on the other hand, drains into the left renal
vein.
The lymphatic vessels drain the epididymis.
They follow the course of the testicular arteries
and empty into the para-aortic nodes.
The sympathetic nerves accompany the testic-
ular arteries and innervate smooth muscle ﬁbres
which enable the scrotal skin to wrinkle, and thus
draw the testes closer to the body when the tem-
perature is too low.
The accessory glands of the male
reproductive system
The accessory glands secrete ﬂuid into the urethra
to provide the optimum atmosphere for sperm and
lubrication to ease delivery. The glands are:
. the seminal vesicles
. the prostate
. the bulbourethral glands.
Seminal vesicles
The seminal vesicles are tubular glands that pro-
duce fructose and other substances for release in
semen. The vesicles lie lateral to each vas deferens
which they join to form the ejaculatory duct. The
ejaculatory duct travels through the prostate
and opens on the posterior wall of the prostatic
urethra.

encased in the tunica vaginalis, which also contains the
testicular artery, supplying the testes and pampiniform
plexus of veins that drains the testis and acts as a heat
exchanger to maintain the cooler environment.
Anatomy 373

The prostate
The prostate forms the acid phosphatase-rich part
of the seminal ﬂuid. The ﬂuid drains into the
urethra. This spherical gland with a ﬁrm muscular
stroma encompasses the prostatic urethra. It lies
on the pelvic ﬂoor, beneath the bladder, behind the
pubic symphysis and in front of the rectum.
The penis
Semen is expelled through the urethra during
emission and ejaculation. It is lengthened and
encompassed in erectile tissue to form the penis;
this allows semen to be deposited close to the
uterus during sexual intercourse. The root of the
penis joins the perineal membrane. The membra-
nous urethra penetrates the perineal membrane
anterior to its free posterior border. It then enlarges
to form the bulb of the urethra. (Fig. 14.55)
Three masses of erectile tissue, the two corpora
cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum, project
from the root of the penis:
. The corpora cavernosa lies dorsally, attached at
the midline.
. The corpus spongiosum lies ventrally and ex-
pands distally to form the glans penis, the most
distal part of the penis.
The penis is supplied by branches of the internal
pudendal arteries, whereas the penile skin is
supplied by branches of the external pudendal
arteries. The deep arteries of the penis supply the
erectile tissue of the penis, and are involved in
erection.
Lymph from the skin of the penis drains to the
superﬁcial inguinal nodes. However, lymph from
the glans penis empties into a node in the femoral
canal. The prostatic urethra is innervated, auto-
nomically, from the pelvic plexus. Somatic sensory
innervation is from branches of the pudendal
nerve.
The female genital system
The female genital system encompasses the struc-
turesinvolvedintheripeningandreleaseofgametes
and the support of the fetus during pregnancy.
There are four major structures in the female
reproductive system (Fig. 14.57):

Figure 14.57 The female pelvic organs consist of the ovaries which mature and release ova; these are carried to the
fallopian tubes where they are may be fertilised by sperm. If this is the case, the fertilised ovum implants in the uterus
where it develops and grows during pregnancy. The ovarian and uterine arteries anastomose with each other,
contributing to the supply of the pelvic organs.
374
Anatomy

1 The ovaries are the site of ovum release and
oestrogen production.
2 Thefallopiantubescarrytheovumtotheuterus.
3 The uterus is the site where the fertilised ovum
implants.
4 The vagina is the passage from the uterus to the
external environment.
The ovaries
The ovaries are ovoid structures located in the
rectouterine pouch alongside the distal ends of
the fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce female
gametes prenatally. Postnatally they are involved
in female hormone production, egg maturation
and release.
DEFINITION The rectouterine pouch
The rectouterine pouch, also known as the pouch of
Douglas, is formed by peritoneum. Peritoneum cov-
ers the upper third of the rectum anteriorly and
laterally, but only the anterior surface of its middle
third. The peritoneum is reﬂected forward from its
middle third on to the posterior fornix of the vagina
and uterus to form the rectouterine pouch.
The male equivalent is the rectovesical pouch in
which the peritoneum is reﬂected on to the bladder.
The vasculature of the ovaries
The ovaries receive a rich blood supply from the
ovarian arteries, which branch from the abdom-
inal aorta beneath the renal arteries. Branches
of the ovarian artery anastomose with the ter-
minal branches of the uterine artery around the
ovary.
Right and left ovarian veins empty into the in-
ferior vena cava or the left renal vein, respectively.
Lymph drains in the lymphatics which travel
alongside the arteries in the opposite direction into
the para-aortic nodes.
The fallopian tubes
Each fallopian tube lies in the broad ligament and
links the ovaries to the superior part of the uterus,
transporting an egg between these bodies. The end
closest to the ovary is expanded to form the infun-
dibulum which has numerous prolongations,
known as ﬁmbriae, to capture the ovum as it is
released from the ovary.
The uterus
The uterus is the site of development of the ferti-
lised ova. It is continuous with the cervix and
positioned behind the bladder. The uterus is nor-
mally anteverted (tilting forwards) and anteﬂexed
(ﬂexed forwards); it is maintained in this position
by the round ligaments. The uterus is mobile and
its position changes during pregnancy; the round
ligament has some oestrogen-dependent smooth
muscle so its structure varies according to oestro-
gen production. The uterus can be divided into
three major parts:
1 The fundus lies superior to the fallopian tube
openings.
2 The body of the uterus makes up most of the
organ.
3 The cervix is the neck of the uterus.
The vagina
The vagina is the muscular canal through which
sperm enter the female reproductive tract and also
the exit for menses, and the passage for birth of the
fetus. The vagina stretches from the cervix to
the opening on to the perineum and lies between
the urethra and rectum.
The vasculature of the uterus
and vagina
The vasculature of the female genital tract is
derived from several vessels, the branches of
which anastomose. The major supplying vessels
are:
. the uterine artery, a branch of the internal iliac
artery, which supplies the superior part of the
vagina and the uterus
. the ovarian artery which contributes to supply
the uterine tubes at the end of its courses, as well
as supplying the ovaries.
The veins draining the uterus follow the course
of the arteries and drain into the internal iliac vein
and ovarian vein. Most of the lymph passes to the
internal iliac nodes.
Medical imaging
A variety of techniques can be used to image the
internal structure of the body. In general, images
Anatomy 375

are generated in one of three planes, each of which
is at 90 to the other:
. The sagittal plane is a vertical plane that lies in
the anteroposterior plane. It is as if a knife has cut
you between the eyes from front to back all the
way down your body.
. The coronal plane is a vertical plane at right
angles to this. It would be as if your body was cut
from a line that stretched between your ears.
. The transverse plane is also known as the axial
plane. It involves cutting the body into cross
sections at different levels.
Five major techniques are commonly used to im-
age the internal structures of the body:
. Plain radiographs
. Contrast media
. Computed tomography (CT)
. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
. Ultrasonography.
Plain radiographs
Plain radiographs are obtained by passing X-rays
through the patient on to photographic ﬁlm. The
degree of exposure that the ﬁlm receives depends
on the absorption of different tissues of the body.
Air is radiolucent, bone and metal radio-opaque.
The differences in radiodensity allow detection
of breaks in the bones as well as the identiﬁcation
of other pathology if it has a different radioden-
sity to the surrounding tissue.
The chest radiograph
A plain radiograph is frequently taken to investi-
gate
thoracic
pathology.
Chest
radiographs
are commonly taken in a posteroanterior (PA)
fashion – the patient faces the radiographic ﬁlm
and the X-rays are dispersed from back to front.
The patient must have the shoulders protracted
to give the best lung ﬁeld exposure. The chest
radiograph must also be taken when the patient is
inspiring fully which generates large radiotran-
slucent ﬁelds, to improve the chance of detecting
radio-opaque pathologies. This positioning en-
ables the soft tissue structures to be seen most
clearly (Fig. 14.58).
Computed tomography
CT is a type of three-dimensional radiography.
X-rays are passed through the body and mea-
sured on emergence but, with CT, a narrow
beam is used and an array of sensors used to
receive the X-rays instead of ﬁlm. The beam is
rotated around the patient to enable measure-
ments to be taken at many angles, allowing
generation of three-dimensional images of the

visible. The lungs are of low density and appear clear on the radiograph.

patient. CT scans are typically shown as a series
of axial slices viewed from below (Fig. 14.59).
Magnetic resonance imaging
MR images are different to CT scans because they
detect biochemical composition of the tissues
rather than their density, which is detected by CT.
In MRI patients are placed in a magnetic ﬁeld and
they are exposed to a sequence of magnetic pulses.
This causes energy to be released from various
molecules in the body, particularly water. The
differences in energy released are shown on an
image as changes in brightness. Depending on the
type of MR scan, the characteristic intensity of
signal varies. Similar to CT scans, MR images are
viewed from the imaginary foot of the bed looking
up towards the patient’s head.
Two common methods used to differentiate
tissue types further are T1- and T2-weighted
images. These rely on slightly different manipula-
tions of energy and are useful when looking for a
particular pathology (Fig. 14.60):
. T1-weighted images cause fat to be white where-
as ﬂuid appears dark.

Figure 14.59 Computed tomography allows the body
to be viewed in three dimensions. The images are
typically presented as axial slices viewed from the feet
up. The slice shown here is from the thorax of a patient
who has a dissection of the aorta. The intima can be
clearly seen (arrow) and a false lumen has formed and
ﬁlled with blood.

Figure 14.60 Magnetic resonance imaging can be performed with different weightings to the scan, allowing the
highlighting of different tissue types and the identiﬁcation of different pathologies. The two scans presented are of
healthy brains. Both the T1- and the T2-weighted images highlight fatty tissue (white); however, in T2-weighted
images the ﬂuid (in this case, cerebrospinal ﬂuid) is also highlighted. Similarly, ﬂuid found in inﬂammation is
illuminated in T2-weighted images.
Anatomy 377

. InT2-weightedimages,fatandﬂuid-ﬁlledtissues
both appear bright, whereas those containing
fat are darker, allowing identiﬁcation of potential
pathology (Fig. 14.60).
Angiography
Angiography is used to visualise the inside of
blood-ﬁlled spaces. A radiocontrast agent is put
into the bloodstream via a catheter into a periph-
eral artery. X-rays are then projected through the
area of interest to visualise the inside of particular
vessels or the heart (Fig. 14.61).
Ultrasonography
Ultrasonography is an imaging technique for visua-
lising soft-tissue structures. It is commonly used to
visualise the growing fetus, but has multiple other
uses includingvisualisationof soft-tissuepathology
of joints, the breast, abdomen, pelvis and heart.
High-frequency sound waves are projected into the
area of interest, and rebounding ‘echoes’ are cap-
tured as an image. Doppler can be combined with
ultrasonographytopicturemovingimages of blood
ﬂow through the heart and blood vessels.

Immunology
The human body must safeguard itself from con-
stant attack by a variety of microorganisms, and
from the development of cancerous cells. This is
achieved by the immune system, a diverse group of
cells and tissues. The immune system has two
distinct parts: the innate immune system, which
acts rapidly but recognises alimited set of antigens,
and the adaptive immune system, which is slower
in developing a response to a new antigen, yet able
to respond speciﬁcally to an almost inﬁnite variety
of antigens – molecules derived from a pathogen.
The adaptive immune system isable to‘remember’
a previously encountered antigen and provide a
more rapid and potent response if the antigen is re-
encountered.
The rapidly acting innate system is able to
promote the induction of the adaptive immune
system and the adaptive immune system is able
to recruit and modulate the behaviour of the
innate immune system to help eliminate an
infection.
The immune system may malfunction and an
immune response can be directed against healthy
tissue in the body, potentially resulting in severe
autoimmune conditions.
Innate immunity
The innate immune system is evolutionarily very
old, and is concerned not only with the protection
of the individual from pathogens, but also with
a variety of homoeostatic and repair functions.
The innate system is characterised by a number
of features:
. Germline-encoded receptors recognise a variety
of patterns that are conserved on a variety of
pathogens. After recognition of a pathogen-
associated molecular pattern (PAMP), a rapid
response is triggered, e.g. toll-like receptors.

DEFINITION: Germ-line encode
receptors
In the immune system most receptors are tran-
scribed directly from the genome – the genetic code
has not beenmodiﬁed. The receptors havea speciﬁc
ligand or set of ligands. These receptors are referred
to as Germ-line encoded receptors – and differfrom
receptors in the adaptive immune system which can
be generated by somatic recombination.
DEFINITION: Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
Toll-like receptors are a series of germline-encoded
receptors which recognise conserved patterns
found in many pathogens. Unusually for a receptor,
most TLRs are capable of recognising many differ-
ent stimuli. For example, TLR4 recognises many
molecules, including Lipopolysaccharide and heat
schock proteins.
The activation of a TLR results in the induction of
cytokines, promoting an inﬂammatory response.

. Phagocytic cells can engulf pathogens and
mediate their destruction.
. Rapid
responses
to
infection
are
possible
because there is no need for the induction and
expansion of cells.
. Plasma
protein
cascades
result
when
an
activated plasma protein acts as a proteolytic
enzyme to activate the next protein in the
cascade.
DEFINITION: Pathogen-associated
molecular pattern (PAMP)
PAMPs are molecules derived from a pathogen
(e.g. LPS), or produced as a result of the damage
and stress the body (e.g. The heat shock proteins)
is placed under during infection. PAMPs can
be recognised by several receptors in the im-
mune system to stimulate and guide the immune
response.
The innate immune system is critical to the
function of the adaptive immune system, pro-
viding signals to induce and activate adaptive
immunity. Innate immune cells are recruited by
the adaptive immune cells to serve as an effector
mechanism to promote the clearance of the
infection.
Adaptive immunity
The adaptive immune system generates a very
speciﬁc response to an antigen. The adaptive
immune system centres on the B and T lym-
phocytes, which possess a huge diversity of
antigen receptors speciﬁc to an almost limitless
range of pathogens, although it is hindered by
the length of time taken to induce a response.
Adaptive immunity has a number of speciﬁc
features:
. Lymphocytes are the key cell in the adaptive
immune system; an individual lymphocyte is
speciﬁc to a single antigen.
. Diverse antigen receptors are generated by so-
matic recombination.
. Immunological memory allows a more rapid
responsetoapathogenonasubsequentencounter,
preventing a speciﬁc strain of pathogen repeatedly
causing infection in the same individual.
Cells of the immune
system
All the cells in the immune system are derived
from lymphoid and myeloid progenitors which
are themselves derived from the common haema-
topoietic stem cell (Fig. 15.1).
Myeloid cells
Myeloid cells are derived from the myeloid pro-
genitor cell and make up most of the cells in the
innate immune system. The two most prominent
types are the neutrophil, the most common leu-
kocyte in the blood and the ﬁrst cell recruited to
sites on inﬂammation, and the monocyte, which
develops into many different cells, particularly the
macrophage and dendritic cell.
Neutrophils
Neutrophils are the most common white blood
cell, making up 40–70% of leukocytes found in
peripheral blood. In tissue, their presence is an
indicator of infection and is associated with acute
inﬂammation.
Morphology and formation
Neutrophils develop from a myeloid progenitor
cell in the bone marrow. These cells are typi-
cally 9–16 mm in diameter and possess a multi-
lobed nucleus. The cytoplasm of neutrophils
contains many granules containing degradative
enzymes.
Role
Neutrophils have a relatively short lifespan, 2–
3 days, and rapidly migrate to the site of infec-
tion; they are the ﬁrst cells found in large num-
bers at a site of infection. Large numbers of
neutrophils are also retained in a ‘marginal
pool’, which can be mobilised during infection
to increase the number of the cells able to re-
spond. Neutrophils phagocytose pathogen and
possess a large number of granules that can fuse
with the phagosome to mediate killing. The
neutrophil is a short-lived cell and, once its
granules are exhausted, the cell dies and con-
tributes to the formation of pus.

Immunology

Macrophages and mononuclear
cells
Macrophages
are
long-lived,
tissue-resident
cells that can detect pathogens in the tissue and
produce
mediators
to
initiate
inﬂammation.
Macrophages are one group of cell in the
mononuclear phagocyte system, which is in-
volved in many homoeostatic processes within
the body.
Morphology and formation
Macrophages develop from circulating mono-
cytes, which differentiate from the myeloid
precursor. Monocytes make up around 5–6% of
the circulating leukocytes, typically remaining
in the circulation for 1–2 days before differenti-
ating into macrophages on entering tissue.
Macrophages are large cells, possessing many
cytotoxic granules, and have a single round
nucleus.

Figure 15.1 The cells of the immune system are derived from the haematopoietic stem cell. This cell is responsible
for producing all the cells within the blood. Two progenitor cells derived from the haematopoietic cells give rise to the
immune cells. The myeloid progenitor produces myeloid cells, which occupy compartments in the blood and
tissues. The lymphoid progenitor gives rise to B cells, T cells and NK cells.
CLINICAL: The Mononuclear phagocyte
cells
Macrophages are closely related to other cell groups
in the body, which all have a role in tissue remodelling
and homeostasis:
. Kuppfer cells and splenic macrophages remove
senescent red blood cells from the circulation.
. Osteoclasts are involved in bone remodelling and
calcium homeostasis, mediating the breakdown of
the mineral deposits in bone.
. Microglia act as macrophages in the CNS. In
embryonic development microglia are involved in
phagocytosis of neuronsthat apoptosenaturally as
part of the development of the brain.
Immunology 381

Role
Macrophages
are
involved
in
the
immune
response in many ways:
. Tissue-resident macrophages are the ﬁrst cells to
encounter a pathogen and initiate an immune
response.
. Macrophages may phagocytose pathogens and
induce a variety of killing mechanisms after their
recruitment to the infection site.
. Macrophages are activated to secrete cytokines,
which modulate the immune response.
Dendritic cells
Dendritic cells (DCs) provide a crucial link
between the innate and adaptive immune sys-
tems. They are closely related to the mononu-
clear cells and may be derived from monocytes.
There are many subtypes of DCs and their
origin is poorly understood – both myeloid and
lymphoid origins have been suggested for dif-
ferent subgroups.
DCs exist in an immature form in tissues,
where they acquire antigen through macropi-
nocytosis and phagocytosis. DCs may move to
lymph nodes and present the acquired antigen
to the adaptive immune system. In the resting
state, this induces self-tolerance. However, in
an inﬂammatory situation DCs can speciﬁcally
activate the adaptive immune response to an
antigen presents: DCs are the only cell type
capable of activating na€ıve T cells.
DEFINITION: Macropinocytosis and
Phagocytosis
All cells are capable of taking up particles from their
environment:
. In most cases small molecules are taken up
through vesicles or through direct binding to a
receptor.
. Speciﬁc types of cells (e.g. Macrophages and
neutrophils) may be capable of taking up large
(>1 mm) particles by phagocytosis.
. Dendritic cells have developed a mechanism of
directly monitoring the external environment,
sampling large amounts of ﬂuid and particles by
macropinocytosis.
Basophil
Basophils are blood-borne cells and are recruited
to sites of inﬂammation, where they perform
a similar function to mast cells. They are charac-
terised by their alkaline granules which contain
histamine. They have a number of features similar
to mast cells – reﬂecting their similar function:
. Cytoplasmic granules containing inﬂammatory
mediators including histamine
. The IgE receptor allowing basophils to release
their granules in response to antigen binding to
pre-bound IgE.
Eosinophils
Eosinophils respond to parasitic infection, through
releaseofgranulesthatcontainmoleculessuchasthe
eosinophil cationic protein and the major basic pro-
tein.Eosinophilgranulesstainredwiththedyeeosin.
Lymphoid cells
Three main groups of cells are derived from the
lymphoid progenitor cell:
1 T cells which recognise protein antigen pre-
sented on major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) molecules
2 B cells which produce antibodies that target
extracellular antigens
3 Natural killer (NK) cells which can identify
virally infected and cancerous cells.
T and B cells
T and B cells normally circulate through the blood
and lymphatics in a dormant state or are found in
the lymphoid tissues; they are small (approximately
7 mm) inactive cells that, on activation, swell to
9–15 mm in size. The antigen receptors of T and
B cells are produced by genetic recombination;
the receptor expressed on every T or B cell may be
unique to that cell alone, resulting in a huge diver-
sity of speciﬁcities in the whole population. T cells
express a speciﬁc receptor which allows the detec-
tion of a unique protein antigen within a speciﬁc
compartment of a host cell. B cells perform a similar
task, detecting free-ﬂoating antigens through their
immunoglobulin receptor.
T and B cells express a wide variety of additional
molecules in their activated state which are in-
volved in mediating effector functions:
382
Immunology

. Activated T cells express co-stimulatory mole-
cules to activate other parts of the immune sys-
tem, or can release cytotoxic granules for killing
pathogen-infected cells, although the composi-
tion of these granules is very different to that seen
in myeloid cells.
. Activated B cells develop into plasma cells
which are
specialised
for
the secretion
of
antibody molecules.
Natural Killer (NK) cells
NK cells make up less than 5% of the circulating
lymphocyte population. Unlike T and B cells, they
express germline-encoded receptors that detect
changes in the expression of a variety of molecules
on the target cell’s surface. These changes may
indicate the presence of an infection, or a cancer-
ous change. NK cells possess cytotoxic granules,
allowing them to mediate killing of cells in which
they detect pathology.
Non-cellular components
of the immune system
Many proteins are initiators and/or effectors of
an immune response. Some of these proteins
may be produced directly by immune system cells
(e.g. antibodies) whereas others are produced by
the liver (e.g. complement).
Complement
The complement pathway consists of a cascade
of blood-borne proteases which may be activated
by some conserved elements of pathogens or
some forms of antibody. Each activation pathway
leads to the formation of a C3 convertase, which
in turn leads to downstream functions promot-
ing an effective immune response to clear the
pathogen.
Production and nomenclature
Complement proteins are produced by the liver
in an inactive form. They are activated as a result
of proteolytic
cleavage,
which produces
two
fragments:
. The uncleaved inactive form of the protein is
known by its number, e.g. C3.
. The small soluble fragment is designated ‘a’ (e.g.
C3a) and can act as a mediator of inﬂammation.
. The larger ‘b’ fragment (e.g. C3b) binds to a
membrane and can mediate the generation of
other components in the complement cascade.
Activation of complement
There are three mechanisms by which the com-
plement cascade may be activated (Fig. 15.2):
1 Classic pathway
2 Mannan-binding lectin pathway
3 Alternative pathway.
The classic complement pathway is initiated
by the C1 complex, which binds to antibodies
on the surface of pathogens. This molecule is
made up of six ‘heads’ of C1q and two molecules
each of C1s and C1r. The C1q molecules bind to
a site on the constant region of antibodies and
may also bind directly to the surface of some
pathogens through the recognition of speciﬁc
PAMPs. The binding of C1q activates C1s, a
serine
protease
which
recruits
and
cleaves
C4, the next component on the complement
cascade.
The cleavage of C4 into the membrane-
bound C4b allows it to bind a C2 component,
exposing it to the proteolytic activity of C1s,
thus producing a C4bC2b molecule: an active
C3 convertase.
The mannan-binding lectin (MBL) pathway
is very similar to the classic complement path-
way. However, it is initiated by MBL instead of
C1. MBL has a similar structure to C1: six
collectin ‘heads’ bind to common bacterial sur-
face molecules, as opposed to the Fc regions of
antibodies.
Binding
leads
to
the
activation
of
MASP-1
and
MASP-2,
which
are
serine
proteases similar to C1s, and trigger cleavage
of C4 and then C2, to produce the C4bC2b
molecule.
The alternative complement pathway differs
from the MBL and classic pathways because it is
activated in the plasma, through the spontane-
ous hydrolysis of C3. This allows the binding
of plasma factor B, which is then cleaved
by another plasma-based factor, factor D. The
resulting C3Bb complex is a ﬂuid-phase C3
convertase and produces C3b, which binds
to cell surfaces. The surface-bound C3b may
recruit factor B to produce membrane-bound
C3 convertase.
Immunology 383

Hostcellsproducecontrolproteinstopreventthe
build-up of C3 convertase on their surface; factors
such as factor H and decay accelerating factor are
able to displace the Bb molecule, inactivating the
C3 convertase. The surface of a pathogen does not
possess such inhibitory actions, and instead allows
binding of properdin (factor P) which stabilises the
C3 convertase, increasing its effectiveness.
Effector mechanisms
The C3 convertase forms the basis of the effector
mechanisms in the complement pathway, which
are classiﬁed into three main groups:

384
Immunology

Opsonisation
The C3 convertase produces membrane-bound
C3b which is deposited on to the surface of patho-
gens. C3b can be recognised by many receptors on
immune cells.
Anaphylatoxins
A series of small soluble fragments are produced
by cleavage of the complement proteins: C3a, C5a
and C4a (as part of the classic pathway). These
molecules bind to receptors and mediate inﬂam-
matory changes. They have a variety of actions
related to inﬂammation:
. Induce smooth muscle contraction
. Increase permeability of blood vessels
. Recruit
leukocytes
directly
to
sites
of
inﬂammation
. Trigger release of inﬂammatory molecules (e.g.
histamine)
. Activate expression of adhesion molecules on the
endothelium to recruit leukocytes.
The membrane–attack complex
The membrane–attack complex assembles a pore
in the bacterial cell that disrupts the osmotic gra-
dient into the bacterial cell, as well as allowing
degradative enzymes into the pathogen. The pro-
duction of C5b by C5 convertase (which is formed
by the binding of C3b to a C3 convertase) is the ﬁrst
step in the production of a membrane–attack com-
plex. C5b recruits C7 and C6 from the plasma,
which bind to the pathogen surface and recruit
C8, which inserts into the membrane. After this, C9
is recruited and activated, when it can polymerise
to form a pore in the bacterial cell membrane.
The membrane–attack complex is particularly
important in the immune response to Neisseria
species. This is highlighted in an increased sus-
ceptibility to infections by Neisseria spp. in those
with deﬁciencies of the components.
Antibodies
Antibodies are produced by plasma cells, the dif-
ferentiated form of B cells, and represent a major
mechanism for speciﬁc recognition of pathogen.
Varying classes of antibodies can be produced to
recruitdifferentpartsoftheimmuneresponseforan
effective response to a speciﬁc pathogen (Fig. 15.3).
All antibodies share a conserved structure which
is encoded by the imunoglobulin genes (Ig)
consisting of two heavy chains and two light
chains. They are organised to form two main func-
tional regions:
1 The variable region is made up of part of the
heavy chain and part of the light chain. This has
a highly variable structure and produces a highly
speciﬁc binding site.
2 The constant (Fc) region varies between differ-
ent classes of antigen and is made up of the
heavy chain only. The Fc region can bind various
receptors, determining the immune effector
mechanisms recruited.
A J chain can bind to IgA and IgM, allowing
them to form multimeric structures. This allows
the antibody to bind at a lower afﬁnity, through the
presence of many more binding sites.
Cytokines
Cytokines are secreted molecules that allow sig-
nalling between cells and act on speciﬁc receptors.
Three major cytokine groups have been identiﬁed
in relation to their structure:
1 Interleukins (IL) are cytokines that are pro-
duced by and alter the behaviour and function
of leukocytes. They often have a generalised
function, such as the systemic response to in-
ﬂammation (IL-1, IL-6).
2 Interferon can be subdivided into two groups:
– IFNa and IFNb areassociatedwiththeantiviral
response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
– IFNg is a crucial signal in the T-helper 1 (Th1)
response,
through
its
ability
to
activate
macrophages.
3 Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related mole-
cules are involved in a wide variety of process.
Soluble examples such as TNFa may be involved
in inﬂammation, whereas membrane-bound
TNF-related proteins may undertake a variety
of effector functions such as the Fas ligand in
cytotoxic killing.
Inﬂammation and repair
A key feature of an early immune response is
inﬂammation – the release of molecules that
signal the presence of tissue damage, as well as
of a pathogen. This process rapidly recruits neu-
trophils and other immune system components to
the site to initiate an immune response.

IgM
IgM is the first antibody isoform produced in a 
primary immune response. It may be found in a 
monomeric form on the surface of B cells where 
it acts as cellular receptor to activate them to 
differentiate and proliferate as an immune 
response. IgM antibodies have a relatively low 
binding affinity antibody, produced rapidly at the 
start of the adaptive immune response. They are 
found as a pentamer, producing a molecule with 
high avidity despite the low binding affinity of 
each Fab region. IgM recruits C1 of the 
complement pathway as an effector mechanism; 
IgM does not bind directly to a receptor.
IgG
IgG is the most common form of antibody found 
in the plasma, playing a major role in post-
infection immunity. It is found as a monomer; its 
small size allows it to enter tissue fluid which is 
not restricted to the bloodstream. There are 
many subclasses of IgG, with different Fc regions 
allowing different effector responses.
IgA
IgA is a higher affinity antibody produced later in 
the immune response. It is commonly found in the 
blood and secreted on to mucosa by means of a 
special transporter, where it mediates protection at 
the mucosal surface. In the mucosa it is found as 
a dimer linked by a J chain, and an additional 
secretory component that is involved in the 
transport of the molecule across the epithelial 
membrane. The secretory component mediates 
some protection against the proteolytic enzymes 
found in the gut.
IgE
A high-affinity monomeric isoform that is capable 
of binding to its receptor on mast cells before 
binding to antigens. Upon binding antigen, it is 
able to mediate mast cell degranulation – 
important in tissue responses to pathogens, and 
also the basis of type I hypersensitivity.
IgD
Expression of the IgD isoform is restricted to the 
surface of the B cells, where it is the major 
isoform expressed. IgD is not detectable in the 
plasma.
386
Immunology

The process of inﬂammation itself also damages
tissues. As a result, repair is closely linked to
inﬂammation.
Acute inﬂammation
Acute inﬂammation constitutes the rapid response
to infection and injury, whereby the host attempts
to limit damage and infection, and then promotes
healing and recovery of function. Acute inﬂamma-
tion can be characterised by four cardinal features:
1 Heat
2 Redness
3 Swelling
4 Pain.
Histological changes
Acute inﬂammation is characterised by the inﬂux
of neutrophils which migrate into the tissue in
large numbers from surrounding venules. The
tissue layers become divided, as a result of the
oedema, because of the increased vascularity of
the vessels.
Pyogenic bacterial infections are controlled by
phagocytosis, achieved primarily by neutrophils.
This results in the formation of pus, which contains
ﬂuid, dead tissue, bacteria and other foreign bod-
ies, aswell as dead andliving leukocytes. The whole
structure becomes contained in an abscess. The
inﬂux of neutrophils is at its peak during the ﬁrst
6 hours of inﬂammation. In later stages, macro-
phages are recruited.
DEFINITION: Abscess
An abscess is a localised collection of pus
contained in a cavity, preventing the escape of the
bacteria into the system.
Leukocyte migration
To reach the site on infection, leukocytes must exit
the circulation and migrate into the tissues. This
process can be divided into four stages:
1 Leukocyte rolling
2 Adhesion to endothelium
3 Diapedesis
4 Leukocyte
migration
within
the
tissues
(chemotaxis).
Leukocyte rolling
When leukocytes reach sites of inﬂammation they
must ﬁrst attach to the endothelium. Initially, this
is by low-afﬁnity interaction between selectin mo-
lecules and their carbohydrate ligands, both of
which are constitutively expressed. This interac-
tion causes ‘leukocyte rolling’ which is a normal
physiological occurrence; 60–300% of circulating
neutrophils are thought to exist in a marginal pool
in this state which allows the leukocytes to sample
cytokines and bind to other molecules expressed
on the endothelial surface.
Adhesion to endothelium
In inﬂammation, cytokines and other inﬂamma-
tory mediators causes the upregulation of adhe-
sion molecules such as selectins and integrins on
the endothelial cells. The cytokines also act on the
leukocytes, where they trigger rapid changes in cell
surface integrins. The conformational changes
allow integrins on the leukocytes to bind with
a high afﬁnity to cell surface adhesion molecules
(CAMs). The interaction between CAMs and
integrins halts the leukocyte rolling, enabling
a tight adherence.
Diapedesis
Leukocytes must cross the endothelium to reach
the inﬂamed tissues. This process takes several
minutes to occur and is tightly regulated by a
variety of
molecules, in particular
by CD31
(PECAM-1 or platelet endothelial cell adhesion
molecule 1), which is expressed by both leukocytes
and endothelial cells. Leukocytes must also cross
the basement membrane by producing various
enzymes; neutrophils can express elastase and
macrophages express collagenase. The release of
the enzymes breaks down endothelial basement
membrane to allow migration and contributes
to
the
tissue
damage
that
occurs
during
inﬂammation.
Figure15.3 Antibodiescan existinmanydifferentclasses.Thesearedeterminedby the constant(Fc)regionsofthe
antibody, which are made up solely from the heavy chains. The differences in Fc region allow antibodies to bind to
different groups of receptors and other organising chains, which allows antibodies with the same speciﬁcity to
perform different functions or form different multimeric structures.

Immunology 387

Leukocyte chemotaxis
Once in the tissues, leukocytes migrate by follow-
ing a chemokine gradient. Chemokines are pro-
duced at the site of inﬂammation and bind to the
extracellular matrix. A major chemokine, IL-8, is
produced by tissue-resident macrophages that
ﬁrst encounter pathogens and recruit neutrophils.
Different chemokines can attract different cell
types; later in inﬂammation, macrophages become
the predominant migrating cell type and are
recruited by chemokines such as macrophage
chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1).
Systemic response to acute
inﬂammation
There is a systemic innate response to inﬂamma-
tion, which is triggered by macrophage-secreted
cytokines, in particular IL-1, IL-6 and TNFa:
. TNFa increases the breakdown of the body’s fat
supplies to increase the available energy stores.
Appetite is reduced causing weight loss during
illness.
. Cytokines act on the hypothalamus to increase
body temperature – with the aim to inhibit the
replication of pathogens.
. Synthesis of acute phase proteins is triggered in
the liver, including:
– innate immune system molecules – comple-
ment components, etc.
– clotting-related molecules, e.g. ﬁbrinogen
– regulatory molecules, e.g. a1-antitrypsin.
Chronic inﬂammation
However,
in
some
cases
inﬂammation
may
persist – resulting in a chronic inﬂammation. Here
there is T-cell involvement and the predominant
cell becomes the macrophage, as opposed to the
neutrophil. The precise nature of the inﬂammation
varies with the cause – although the key difference
to acute inﬂammation is that there is evidence
of repair.
Histology
Chronic inﬂammation can be identiﬁed by its hard
red swelling. It is typiﬁed by:
. A mononuclear cell inﬁltrate
. An absence of neutrophils
. Little oedema or pus
. Evidence of repair, in particular collagen depo-
sition by recruited ﬁbroblasts.
Pathogenesis
Both pathogens and foreign particles may cause
forms of chronic inﬂammation. Non-toxic parti-
cles such as silica can be taken up by macrophages
and trigger their activation. The secretion of toxic
products such as H2O2 by macrophages, in an
attempt to clear the silica, leads to tissue damage
and chronic inﬂammation.
Formation of granulomatous
inﬂammation
A speciﬁc form of chronic inﬂammation is granu-
lomatous inﬂammation, which is characterised by
the formation of discrete lesions, granulomas, that
attempt to wall off the inﬂammation. A granuloma
forms when the antigen triggering the inﬂamma-
tion cannot be removed byactivated macrophages.
Many macrophages (often activated) are found
within the granuloma, as well as two other specia-
lised cells, which are derived from them:
1 Multinucleated giant cells, formed by the fusion
of many macrophages
2 Large epithelioid cells which appear to be spe-
cialised for a secretory function.
The presence of activated macrophages and the
low oxygen contributes to cell death at the centre of
the granuloma. This process is known as caseous
necrosis, in which the necrotic tissues take on
a ‘cheesy’ texture characteristic of a granuloma.
Surrounding the central granuloma are several
different cell types, which contribute to the devel-
opment of the typical structure:
. Th1 cells are thought to promote chronic inﬂam-
mation through their release of IFNg and other
cytokines, which activate macrophages.
. Th2 cells are thought to be involved in the reg-
ulation of the inﬂammatory process, both to
contain the infectious agent and to limit tissue
damage.
. Fibroblasts limit the tissue damage and start
repair. Their presence results in the laying down
of collagen, which is seen in an established
granuloma.
Treatment
Treatment of chronic inﬂammation has focused on
two major methods: ﬁrst, elimination of the agent
triggers the inﬂammatory response, such as the use
of isoniazid for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and,
388
Immunology

second, when the stimulus is not a pathogen,
treatments have been tried that reduce the im-
mune response. These treatments often focus on
blocking macrophage activation, stopping the cell
type responsible for the immune response.
Mediators of inﬂammation
Many protein cascades and pathways contribute
to the development of an inﬂammatory response –
ﬁve major mediators are discussed:
1 The coagulation cascade
2 The ﬁbrinolytic cascade
3 The kinins
4 Arachidonic acid metabolites
5 Histamine.
Coagulation cascade
Clotting prevents the spread of microorganisms
into the systemic circulation by producing a phys-
ical barrier of ﬁbrin around the infection site. It
may be activated by tissue damage, through the
production of tissue factor or encountering a neg-
atively charged surface.
Fibrinolytic cascade
Although the formation of a clot by the coagulation
cascade limits the spread of infection, the clot must
be cleared to allow wound repair and leukocyte
access.
Activation of the ﬁbrinolytic cascade produces
plasmin from plasminogen which can break down
the ﬁbrin clots. Plasmin can also activate the clas-
sic complement pathway.
Kinins
The kinins are a group of proteins produced in
direct response to tissue damage. Of particular
importance is the peptide bradykinin, which is
produced by the enzyme kallikrein. Bradykinin
causes vascular muscle contraction which restricts
blood ﬂow to hinder spread of infection; it is also
a major pain signal. In addition, kallikrein cleaves
C5 into C5b and C5a, to trigger a complement-
induced inﬂammatory response.
Arachidonic metabolites
Arachidonic acid is released from cell membranes
by the action of the enzyme phospholipase A2
(PLA2). The arachidonates promote increased
blood ﬂow and cell migration. They can be divided
into two major families:
1 Leukotrienes are produced by lipoxgyenase
enzymes. Leukotrienes, particularly, act in the
lungs to mediate contraction of the bronchial
smooth muscle and the coronary vessels. In
other vessels, they are dilatory.
2 Prostaglandins are produced by the cyclooxy-
genase (COX) family of enzymes. The COX-2
isoform is upregulated in the inﬂammatory
response, whereas COX-1 is a housekeeping en-
zyme.Theactionoftheprostaglandinsistypiﬁed
by vasodilatation and the activation of endothe-
lial cells. Prostaglandins increase the effect of
other vasodilatory substances instead of directly
causing vasodilatation themselves.
Histamine
Histamine is released from mast cell granules. The
main actions of histamine are typiﬁed by:
. contraction of smooth muscle
. vasodilatation and increased vascular perme-
ability
. increased heart rate and contraction.
When injected into the skin, the resulting
response is similar to acute inﬂammation, hyper-
algesia and oedema in the skin.
Regulation of inﬂammatory
mediators
It is essential that inﬂammatory processes are
restricted to the sites of infection, to prevent wide-
spread tissue damage. Regulatory proteins are
produced by the liver, to inhibit the inﬂammatory
pathways, and are upregulated as part of the acute
phase response.
a1-Antitrypsin cleaves degradative enzymes
such as elastinase, which is secreted by activated
macrophages. This prevents proteinase enzymes
from causing widespread tissue damage.
C1 inhibitor is important in controlling the
complement pathway by inactivating spontane-
ously activated C1s. Deﬁciency of C1 inhibitor is
associated with hereditary spontaneous angio-
neurotic oedema.
Anti-inﬂammatory therapies
Anti-inﬂammatory therapies reduce inﬂamma-
tion, through one or more methods:
Immunology 389

. Preventing
the
synthesis
of
inﬂammatory
mediators
. Inhibiting
the binding
of
an
inﬂammatory
mediator to its receptor
. Modulating the behaviour of immune cells
through modulation of their gene expression.
In each case, the result of giving an anti-inﬂam-
matory to a patient is diminished inﬂammation.
Aspirin and non-steroidal
anti-inﬂammatories
Aspirin
and
non-steroidal
anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit COX-2, which is responsi-
ble for producing prostaglandins from arachidonic
acid. The inhibition of COX-2 is associated with
three major therapeutic effects:
1 Inhibition of inﬂammation: the decrease of
prostaglandin
reduces
vasodilatation,
and
therefore oedema, although the number of cells
migrating to the site of inﬂammation does not
appear to be greatly reduced.
2 Analgesiceffect:prostaglandinscontributetoan
increased sensitivity in pain ﬁbres to other pain
signals, such as bradykinin.
3 Antipyreticeffect:feverisdecreasedthroughthe
diminished prostaglandin levels, and indirectly
through reduced IL-1.
Aspirin bonds irreversibly to COX-2, whereas
other NSAIDs bond reversibly. This allows aspirin
to inhibit COX-2 on platelets, which has a role in
the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
Side effects
Side effects result from unwanted inhibition of
COX-1, which is particularly important in the gut
where it maintains mucus secretion.
NSAIDs are also associated with skin reactions,
which may be severe. Renal insufﬁciency, liver
disorders and bone marrow depression are rare
complications.
Steroids
Glucocorticoids act on a wide range of cells to
reduce the immune response:
. Glucocorticoids reduce leukocyte migration in
response to acute inﬂammation, and limit the
processes contributing to chronic inﬂammation.
. Reduced clonal expansion of T and B cells
inhibits the adaptive immune response and
reduces antibody production.
. Actions on the vasculature reduce vasodilata-
tion and thus decrease oedema.
. Decreased inﬂammation results from decreased
production of cytokines and arachidonate meta-
bolites.
. Inhibition of the acute phase response in the
liver reduces the level of complement compo-
nents in the blood.
Side effects
Glucocorticoids cause widespread inhibition of
the entire immune system. As a result of this, there
is an increased susceptibility to infection and
wound healing is impaired. Other side effects
may be similar to the features of Cushing’s
syndrome.
Antihistamines
Antihistamines
are
H1-receptor
antagonists,
although they also appear to act on other receptors
in the central nervous system (CNS). The inhibition
of H1-receptors decreases vascular permeability,
reduces
oedema
and
inhibits
bronchocons-
triction.
Side effects
Side effects result from CNS effects. Antihista-
mines may promote sedation (e.g. promethazine)
or they can have antiemetic effects (e.g. cinnari-
zine). Other side effects result from antimuscarinic
actions, commonly resulting in a dry mouth and
constipation.
Necrosis and apoptosis
There are two distinct forms of cell death that may
occur:
. Apoptosis is programmed cell death that is im-
portant in development and tissue remodelling,
as well as in immunity.
. Necrosis is a form of unplanned cell death, as-
sociated with injury that promotes an inﬂamma-
tory reaction.
Necrosis
Necrosis occurs in cell injury from which the cell is
unable to recover. It is associated with the release
of a mediator signalling the cell’s death and stim-
ulating an immune response.
390
Immunology

Mechanisms of cell injury
Many processes contribute to cell injury through:
. loss of cell membrane integrity
. decreased ATP concentration
. reduced protein synthesis and damage to the
genome
. generation of reactive oxidative species
. mitochondrial damage and loss of calcium
homoeostasis.
Many of the cell changes that occur may be
reversible up to a point. Reversible cell injuries
include general swelling, blebbing of the cell
membrane, mitochondrial swelling and clumping
of chromatin.
Irreversible
forms
of
cell
injury
include
the breakdown
of the cell genome,
loss of
membrane function and large dense areas in the
mitochondria.
Apoptosis
Apoptosis is a crucial process for development and
tissue remodelling. Apoptosis is tightly regulated,
and the cells play an active role in their death – it is
effectively ‘cell suicide’.
Apoptotic signals may be internal or external.
Internally, signals include developmental pro-
grammes and irreparable damage to DNA, whereas
extrinsic factors include those involved in cytoxic
T-lymphocyte (CTL)-induced killing. It is the
balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic
signals that regulates the survival of the cells. There
are two major mechanisms of apoptosis:
1 Death domain proteins – speciﬁc receptors
possess intracellular domains that can recruit
and activate death domain proteins which
induce apoptosis.
2 Changes in mitochondrial permeability – spe-
ciﬁc mediators of apoptosis can be found in the
mitochondria (e.g. the bcl-2 family of proteins).
Release of these proteins into the cytoplasm can
trigger apoptosis.
The apoptotic pathways activate caspases. Cas-
pase activation results in a proteolytic cascade that
is responsible for a variety of terminal changes:
. Cross-linking of cell proteins
. Chromatin breakdown – breakdown of DNA is
mediated by caspase-activated DNAase
. Breakdown of nuclear architecture and DNA
repair mechanisms.
Repair
Tissue damage must be repaired after resolution
of inﬂammation and may be sufﬁcient to restore
function to the tissue. However, restoration of
function is often not possible in the adult and
scar tissue may result. In the fetus, full resolution
of a wound is usually possible, and is likely to be
due to the different healing processes within the
fetus, in which there is no inﬂammation and
differences in the signals regulate the repair
process.
Compared with many animals, mammals have
a relatively limited regenerative capacity although
the
scope
for
regeneration
of
different
cell
types
varies
widely,
e.g.
although
epithelial
cells can regenerate continuously, neurons are
irreplaceable.
The process of repair
The repair process is discussed in relation to repair
of an incision of the skin in ﬁve stages, which are
continuous with one other.
Inﬂammation and clotting
An inﬂammatory response occurs and there is
formation of a clot. The increased vascular perme-
ability contributes to oedema and there is also
leukocyte recruitment. The clotting results in the
formation of a scab which protects the wound site
while repair is occurring.
Fibrinolysis and would cleansing
After clotting, ﬁbrinolysis occurs and macrophages
take on a scavenger function, removing dead tis-
sues from the wound site. Macrophages release
plasminogen-activating factors to clear the clot,
allowing the laying down of scar tissue.
Revascularisation
Underneath the scab, new capillary growth occurs,
followed by the growth of lymphatic vessels, re-
ducing oedema.
Tissue remodelling
Keratinocytes migrate rapidly over the wound to
lay down a covering of skin, and ﬁbroblasts
migrate from surrounding tissue to lay down
collagen, which is progressively remodelled to
a
stronger
structure.
Remodelling
promotes
wound contracture to produce a tight acellular
scar.
Immunology 391

Wound contraction
Where the wound is a clean incision, and the sides
closely apposed, a small wound results and there is
minimal production of scar tissue. Normally tissue
damage
is more
extensive
and
debris
must
be removed from the site. Such wounds produce
larger defects which, in turn, lead to the production
of more scar tissue. Gradually, the scar tissue tight-
ens to reduce the size of the wound site, resulting in
scars that may be less than 20% of the size of the
original wound.
Regulation of repair
Many cytokines and factors are involved in reg-
ulating the process of tissue repair. Particularly
signiﬁcant signals involved in wound repair
include:
. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is pro-
duced
by
many
cells
at
the
wound
site
and increases the migration of macrophages
and ﬁbroblasts. PDGF stimulates proliferation
of
smooth
muscle
cells
and
ﬁbroblasts
and promotes production of the extracellular
matrix.
. Transforming growth factor-b (TGFb) regu-
lates the production of extracellular matrix
components.
. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) production
by macrophages induces the formation of new
capillary vessels, allowing vascularisation of the
wound.
. Epidermal
growth
factor
(EGF)
promotes
epidermal repair by recruiting keratinocytes and
ﬁbroblasts to the wound site.
A variety of factors may prevent efﬁcient wound
healing:
. Malnutrition often hinders wound healing,
although deﬁciency must be severe as wounds
are give priority. Vitamin C is essential for the
production of stable collagen ﬁbres; further-
more, zinc has been implicated in helping wound
healing.
. Bacterial infection and foreign bodies must be
removed before proper healing can occur.
. Immunosuppression due to steroids and other
drugs can reduce wound healing.
. Genetic
variation
is
poorly
understood,
although errors in leukocyte migration and
connective tissue are associated with a lack of
wound healing.
Anatomy of the immune
system
The different cell types in the immune system must
be produced correctly and, where relevant, under-
go selection. It is essential that the appropriate
interactions occur between cells and pathogens to
detect an infection, and then between different cell
types to induce the correct response.
The lymphoid tissue is crucial to the generation
of an immune response and can be divided into
two types of tissue:
1 The production of immune cells is achieved by
the primary lymphoid organs: the bone marrow
and thymus.
2 The secondary lymphoid tissue is the site where
antigen is presented to immune cells to generate
an adaptive immune response.
Primary lymphoid tissue
Two organs are responsible for the production of
immune cells:
1 Bone marrow is the site of the initial generation
of all haematopoietic cells and where B cells
develop.
2 The thymus is responsible for the development
of na€ıve T cells (which migrate as immature cells
from the bone marrow).
The bone marrow
Bone marrow is found in the hollow interior of
the long bones. All lymphocytes are derived from
a common lymphoid progenitor. Precursors of B
cells mature in the bone marrow before entering
the bloodstream to migrate to secondary lymphoid
organs. Cells that are destined to become T cells
develop in the thymus.
The thymus
The thymus is, a large gland located at the front
of the chest in children. However, the gland
atrophies in adults, although it is still responsi-
ble for producing T cells through an individual’s
life.
In the thymus, thymocytes (immature T cells)
are nursed and selected to produce a variety of
clones that can recognise foreign antigen, although
392
Immunology

those clones that recognise self-antigens are elim-
inated to reduce the potential for autoimmunity.
Secondary lymphoid tissue
Secondary lymphoid tissue is the site of initiation
of an adaptive immune response. These consist of
the lymph nodes, the mucosal lymphoid tissue
and the spleen. T cells enter lymph nodes from
the bloodstream and sample the contents. If they
detect an antigen to which they are speciﬁc, they
proliferate in the lymph node, starting an adaptive
immune response.
Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes are located throughout the body
and serve to ‘trap’ antigens from solid organs to
increase the chance of detection by speciﬁc
lymphocytes.
Lymph is derived from extracellular tissue ﬂuid
and ﬂows to lymph nodes through afferent lymph
vessels. The distinct structure (Fig. 15.4) allows the
sampling of any antigen by adaptive immune cells
in the ﬂuid, be it free ﬂoating or carried in cells, by
the adaptive immune cells. The specialised struc-
ture of the lymph node consists of the following:
. The cortex consists mainly of B cells that are
grouped into primary and secondary follicles.
Follicular DCs present antigen to the B cells.
. Primary follicles contain resting B cells.
. Secondary follicles are those in which rapid cell
division is occurring. They are characterised by
the presence of germinal centres, which are the
sites of B-cell division and differentiation into
plasma cells.
. The paracortex is made up of CD4þ helper T
cells. This region surrounds the cortex and reg-
ulates the different arms of the immune system
to promote an effective response.
. The medulla of lymph node is made up of B cells,
T cells and macrophages.
Na€ıve T cells constantly circulate through the
lymph and bloodstream. They enter lymph nodes
through high endothelial venules (HEVs) before
ﬁnally leaving via efferent vessels to return to the
bloodstream.
During an immune response, B and T cells in the
node are activated and the subsequent accumula-
tion of ﬂuid and cells leads to swelling, causing
the characteristic ‘swollen glands’. The immune
response is usually limited to the glands closest to
the site of infection; generalised swollen lymph
nodes may indicate a systemic infection.
After resolution of infection, nodes return to
their normal size.
The spleen
The spleen regulates the immune response against
blood-borne pathogens (see Fig. 15.4). It also re-
moves opsonised microbes and red blood cells
from the blood. These two functions occur in
different areas of the spleen:
1 Theredpulp makes the greaterproportion of the
spleen. It is made up primarily of macrophages
which phagocytose senescent red blood cells
and other opsonised cells.
2 The white pulp contains around 25% of the
body’s lymphocytes. The structure of splenic
white pulp is different from that of lymph nodes.
The T cells are located in periarteriolar lymphoid
sheaths, which surround central arterioles.
B cells are found mostly in follicles and also in the
marginal zone where T-independent responses are
generated.
The mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue
Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) ac-
quires antigens from mucosal surfaces and is made
up mainly of lymph tissue in the gut and respira-
tory tract, consisting of the tonsils, adenoids,
Peyer’s patches and other small lymphoid struc-
tures. As the vast majority of pathogens infect
their host through mucosal tissue, these tissues
are crucial for induction of the adaptive immune
response.
Peyer’s patches are located in the gut and are a
prototypical example of MALT, responsible for the
acquisition of antigen from the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract. They are the ﬁrst point of contact be-
tween the host and many pathogens. Peyer’s
patches contain large numbers of B cells that
secrete IgA across the epithelium. T cells are pres-
ent that regulate the immune response. This struc-
ture is mirrored by other MALTs:
. M cells are located on mucosal surface above
the MALT. These cells take up antigens by
pinocytosis.
. B cells are located in follicles very close to the
M cells.

Lymph nodes
The lymph nodes receive a flow of lymph from the 
tissues through the afferent lymph. Antigens and cells 
present in the lymph flow through the various regions of 
the node, leaving the node through the efferent vessel, 
via the marginal sinus. 
In the lymph node, the medullary regions contain T 
cells and macrophages. The cortical regions contain 
the follicles, which consist of B cells; these may be 
proliferating within germinal centres. The T cells are 
located primarily in the paracortical region. All lymph 
nodes receive a blood supply which allows the 
migration of naïve T cells into the node.
Peyer’s patches
These lymphoid tissues collect antigen directly from 
the gut through specialised M (multi-fenestrated) cells. 
A follicle of B cells is located directly beneath the M 
cells, and is surrounded by small numbers of T cells. 
This arrangement ensures rapid presentation of 
gut-derived antigen to the immune system.
Spleen
The spleen is organised into red pulp, which is 
concerned with removal of senescent red blood cells, 
and white pulp, which is concerned with the immune 
response. The white pulp is organised around the 
central arteriole, which in turn is surrounded by a 
periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) of T cells. This 
is surrounded by a B-cell region which, when an 
active immune response occurs, will contain a 
germinal centre. The whole region is surrounded by a 
marginal zone of macrophages, which serve to 
capture antigen and present it to the T and B cells of 
the white pulp.
Figure 15.4 The secondary lymphoid tissue in the body is organised into speciﬁc structures. The most prominent of
these are the Lymphnodes, Peyer’s patchesand white pulp of the spleen. Although the structure in each varies, they
are organised to ensure that antigen is delivered effectively to both T and B cells and that an appropriate adaptive
immune response can be developed.
394
Immunology

Adaptive immunity
In response to a new pathogen, the adaptive
immune system is far slower in its induction than
the innate immune system. The almost limitless
speciﬁcity of the antigen receptors that can be
generated by the T and B cells allows them to
respond to any antigen. Furthermore, T and B cells
can develop into memory cells, allowing a second
encounter with the same pathogen to be resolved
much more rapidly.
Adaptive immunity is a double-edged sword,
however; the huge diversity of receptors allows the
generation of receptors speciﬁc to host proteins.
These must be removed from the repertoire or
autoimmune conditions may arise. This process,
tolerance, occurs during maturation, after the
generation of receptors by recombination or in
the periphery.
Generation of diversity of
antigen-binding sites
Both B and T cells generate a huge repertoire
of receptors with different speciﬁcities through
genetic recombination. The process by which
this occurs in the two cell groups is very similar.
The genes encoding the T-cell receptor (TCR) and
immunoglobulin (Ig) are made up of a series of
alternative regions. There are many copies of the
variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) regions in
the genes, which are recombined so that the ﬁnal
gene contains a single variant of each region to
produce a unique gene product in each cell. The
process of recombination in T and B cells is reg-
ulated by the recombination activity genes (RAGs).
Further diversity is added by the potential for
enzymatic removal or addition of nucleotides at
the site of the joins between the various segments
(Fig. 15.5).
It is important to ensure that each lymphocyte
has asingle speciﬁcity. This process requires allelic
exclusion, to ensure that only one copy of the
parental alleles is expressed in each cell. In B cells,
both chains that contribute to the immunoglobu-
lin molecules are regulated by allelic exclusion.
However, in the TCR, only the b chain is subject
to allelic exclusion; thus, a single T cell may express
two different a chains, although it is not clear how
this alters the speciﬁcity and function of an indi-
vidual T cell.
T-cell development and clonal
selection
As a result of recombination, some of the receptors
produced will undoubtedly react to self-antigen.
It is essential that the body remove or suppress
these clones, because they provide a potential for
autoimmunity.
Generation of the TCR
The TCR binds to a unique peptide antigen pre-
sented on an Major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) molecule. The receptor is made up of two
chains; in most T cells the a and b chains make
up the TCR, although in about 5% of cells the
TCR is made up of g and d chains. This section
described generation of an ab TCR, although
generation of the gd TCR occurs similarly.
The generation of a TCR is the result of recom-
bination of various V, D and J regions within the a
and the b chains, both of which contribute to
binding. The TCR clones must be selected to en-
sure that they can recognise an antigen presented
on the MHC and that they do not react to a self-
antigen.
DEFINITION: gd T cells
gd T cells are found extensively in the mucosa
and their role is not well known. They are derived
separately from ab T cells in the thymus and are
thought to have a wide variety of roles, some of
which may be regulatory.
Positive selection
Initially, thymocytes express both CD4 and CD8.
With many different alleles of MHC, and a hugely
diverse TCR repertoire, survival of a TCR clone de-
pends on its ability to bind to either MHC Class I
(MHC-I) or MHC Class II (MHC-II); if this occurs, the
thymocyte becomes restricted to the appropriate co-
receptor and enters negative selection.
If a thymocyte is incapable of binding MHC-I or
MHC-II, it will undergo some TCR rearrangement
using other copies of the TCR alleles; if that fails
the lack of TCR signalling triggers its death. The
large majority (around 90%) of thymocytes are
eliminated in positive selection.

Thymocyte
Thymocytes are derived from lymphoid cells 
within the bone marrow, which migrate into 
the thymus. Initially these cells express both 
CD4 and CD8, and carry a T-cell receptor 
(TCR) that has been generated by recombi-
nation. As such, the T cells must be 
selected, to ensure that the TCR can bind to 
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
and recognise foreign antigen, yet not react 
to self-antigen.
Positive selection
The thymic epithelial cells express host MHC 
molecules; T cells are selected if they can 
bind to the MHC – providing the potential to 
react to an antigen. This process also leads 
to the loss of CD4 or CD8, restricting the T 
cell to recognising antigen in the contexts of 
MHC I or MHC II.
Those cells that are unable to bind to MHC 
must undergo receptor editing, or death.
Negative selection
Dendritic cells within the thymus express 
self-antigen, as do the thymic epithelial 
cells; the self-antigen expressed is from 
proteins found all over the body – for 
increasing the elimination of T cells reactive 
to proteins with no functional role in the 
thymus. The binding of the TCR to self-
antigen presented on MHC triggers the 
elimination of the self-reactive T cell.
T cell
After successful negative selection, a naïve 
T cell is released into the periphery, where it 
is ready to respond to an antigen and 
become activated within an adaptive 
immune response.
Receptor
editing
Figure 15.5 The thymocytes go through a carefully controlled developmental pathway in the thymus gland. Initially
all cells express CD4, CD8 and the T-cell receptor and, after a series of selection, the expression of molecules is
reduced and cells that react to self-antigen are removed from the repertoire or undergo cell death or T-cell receptor
editing.
396
Immunology

Negative selection
After positive selection, it is essential to ensure
that TCR clones which react to self-antigens are
removed. This achieved by the medullary thymic
epithelial cells, which present a wide variety of
self-antigen-derived peptides to the thymocytes.
Recognition
of
self-peptide
at
this
stage
of
thymocyte development triggers a variety of
reactions based on the strength of the signal
(Fig. 15.5):
. No binding: a small signal is required through
the TCR to sustain the thymocytes. A complete
absence of signal leads to cell death.
. Weak interaction: there is sufﬁcient interaction
to produce a small signal through the TCR. This
results in the selection of the T-cell clone and its
development into a na€ıve T cell.
. Strong
interaction:
a
strong
interaction
through the binding of a TCR to a self-peptide
present on the MHC by thymic epithelia
would be harmful in the peripheral circulation.
This premature activation triggers the cell to
undergo receptor rearrangement. If receptor
rearrangement
fails,
apoptosis
occurs
to
prevent autoreactive T cells from entering
the circulation.
The fate of self-reactive T cells
Should a thymocyte express a receptor speciﬁc to
a self-antigen, this would trigger a reactivation of
the RAG genes to create a new receptor through
recombination of the second TCR allele. Failure
to generate a suitable TCR results in death of the
T-cell clone. In some cases a self-reactive T cell
may develop into a regulatory T cell which can
speciﬁcally suppress the immune response.
Generation of speciﬁcity in B cells
The process by which the B-cell receptor (BCR;
immunoglobulin [Ig])) is generated is very similar
to that of the TCR, although there are several key
differences:
. The BCR genes are recombined, instead of the
TCR genes.
. Development of the BCR occurs in the bone
marrow.
. There is no positive selection, because the BCR
recognises intact, unprocessed antigen.
Induction of the adaptive
immune response
Induction of the adaptive immune response is
tightly regulated through a series of speciﬁc recep-
tor–ligand interactions to ensure that an appropri-
ate response is mounted against a pathogen.
The T-cell surface molecules and
T-cell activation
Many different surface molecules on the T cell
have a role in their activation. These molecules
can be divided into provision of three forms of
information:
1 Speciﬁcity for the antigen is maintained by the
TCR.
2 Speciﬁc for the MHC molecule presenting the
antigen:thecompartmentfromwhichtheantigen
is derived is therefore achieved by CD4 and CD8.
3 Co-stimulation is required to activate na€ıve T
cells. It ensures that self- and non-harmful anti-
gens do not induce an immune response. Many
different surface molecules are involved in this,
particularly CD40and CD40ligand (CD154), and
CD28 and B7.
CD3
The CD3 complex allows the TCR into the interior
of the cell – the TCR lacks a cytoplasmic signalling
domain. Asingle TCR isassociated with one eachof
CD3g and CD3d, two CD3e chains and two CD3z
chains. Signalling from CD3 occurs through motifs
known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activa-
tion motifs (ITAMs):
. Binding of TCR allows phosphorylation of the
ITAM by tyrosine kinase enzymes.
. Phosphorylation of ITAM allows binding of
other tyrosine kinases (e.g. ZAP-70 which pro-
motes T-cell activation.
Co-receptors: CD4 and CD8
TCRs are restricted to either MHC-I or -II as a result
of their TCR speciﬁcity and are helped by CD8 or
CD4. These co-receptors bind to MHC-I and MHC-
II, respectively:
Immunology 397

. CD4 is found on helper T cells and binds to
a conserved region of MHC-II. The cytoplasmic
domain of CD4 is associated with Lck, a tyrosine
kinase, which augments the signalling by CD3
and TCR.
. CD8 is made up of a heterodimer of one CD8a
and one CD8b chain; the CD8 molecule-con-
served region on MHC-I augments the TCR sig-
nal (in a similar manner to CD4) and restricts the
TCR to MHC-I.
MHC and antigen presentation

complex (MHC)
The MHC is located on chromosome 6 in humans
and contains critical genes for antigen presenta-
tion, particularly the human leukocyte antigen
(HLA). These are important in the presentation of
antigens to T cells within the adaptive immune
response.
Structure
The MHC is highly polymorphic. Speciﬁc alleles
are numbered, e.g. HLA-B27, HLA-DR2. The MHC
can be divided into three classes:
1 MHC-I encodesthree genes –HLA-A,HLA-B and
HLA-C – which are expressed ubiquitously on
nucleated cells. The protein product of these
genes combines with b2-microglobulin. The
complete MHC-I molecule presents peptides
derived from the cytosolic compartment of the
cells to CD8 þ cytotoxic T cells, allowing the
detection of infection by intracellular pathogens.
2 MHC-II
encodes
genes
for
three
major
products – HLA-DP, HLA-DQ and HLA-DR.
MHC-II molecules are made up of two chains,
so both a and b chains are encoded for each
molecule.
3 MHC-III refers to the other genes in the MHC,
which are not highly polymorphic. Many of
these genes are critical for normal immune
function, including cytokines and complement
components.
For a T cell to detect a pathogen, the epitope that
it recognises must be processed and presented on
the cell surface in a context that the T cell can
recognise. The peptide epitope binds to a groove
in the surface of the MHC molecule; it is the
combination
of
peptide
and
MHC
that
is
recognised by the TCR. To allow the presentation
of a wide variety of peptides by an MHC molecule,
the binding groove is in contact with the peptide at
only a few residues, allowing a wide variation in the
identity of those other residues.
The presence of MHC molecules allows the pre-
sentation of peptides derived from pathogens, and
it is pathogens that are likely to have driven the
polymorphic nature of the MHC. Were a pathogen
able to evolve so that none of its peptides were
capable of binding to an MHC molecule, it could
evade the adaptive immune system in that host. By
having such a variety of MHC, it would be unlikely
that a pathogen would ever be able to evolve to
escape every possible combination of MHC alleles
found in the human population.
Presentation of peptides on MHC-I
MHC-I is recognised by CD8 þ cytotoxic T cells and
presents
peptides
derived
from
the
cytosol
and nuclear compartments. This allows CTLs to
detect infection by intracellular pathogens, such as
viruses.
Structure of MHC-I and expression
The MHC-I molecule is made up of one ‘heavy’
chain consisting of three domains, which is en-
coded by HLA-A, -B or -C. It is associated with a
b2-microglobulin molecule, which is common to
all alleles of MHC-I. The MHC heavy chain con-
tains a peptide-binding groove that accommo-
dates peptides, typically eight to nine amino acids
in length.
As there is the potential for viruses and other
intracellular pathogens to infect any cell in the
body, MHC-I is expressed by all nucleated cells.
However, some cell groups are irreplaceable and
these express low levels of MHC-I, to reduce the
potential for CTL-mediated killing, e.g. nerve cells.
Generation of peptides for MHC-I
and antigen presentation
Large proportions (around 25%) of newly synthe-
sised proteins are incorrectly folded and rapidly
degraded by the proteasome, which generates
peptide fragments by proteolytic cleavage. The
peptide fragments are transported from the cytosol
to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for loading on
MHC-I molecules, through a speciﬁc peptide
transporter – TAP. Peptides imported by TAP may
be ‘trimmed’ by ER aminopeptidases to allow them
to bind to the groove in MHC-I molecules, or may
398
Immunology

be of the appropriate length to bind directly. The
binding of a peptide stabilises the MHC-I molecule
and promotes its transport by the constitutive
secretory pathway, to the cell surface.
Presentation of peptides by MHC-II
molecules
MHC-II molecules present peptides derived from
the endosomal compartment of the cell to CD4þ
Th cells. This permits the detection of infections
and activation of the adaptive immune response to
extracellular pathogens, which have been phago-
cytosed into the endosomal compartment by
antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
The structure and expression of MHC-II
The MHC molecule is made up of two chains. The a
and b chains both contain two domains and both
contribute to the peptide-binding groove in the
molecule. Unlike MHC-I, the peptide-binding
groove is open ended, allowing a wide range of
peptide sizes to be accommodated; MHC-II can
typically accommodate peptides from 18 to 25
amino acids in length.
MHC-II has a more specialised role, and pre-
sents peptides derived, often, from extracellular
sources. Its expression is restricted to speciﬁc
cell groups – particularly those cells capable of
phagocytosis:
. Macrophages and dendritic cells
. B cells
. Some epithelial and endothelial cell groups.
The synthesis of MHC-II and formation and
transport of the MHC-II–peptide complex
MHC-II must present peptides from the endoso-
mal compartment, yet it is synthesised in the ER.
The loading of peptide in the ER onto an ‘empty
MHC-II’ molecule must be prevented.
. MHC-II is synthesised in the ER, complete with
an ‘invariant chain’ (Ii) that is bound across
the MHC-II peptide-binding groove, preventing
ER-derived peptides binding.
. The ‘empty’ MHC-II complexed with Ii is trans-
ported to the endosomal compartment.
. In the endosome, pathogen-derived proteins
are broken down as a result of acidiﬁcation and
enzymatic activities.
. Acidiﬁcation and the enzymatic activities pro-
mote the cleavage and dissociation of Ii from
MHC-II, allowing binding of a suitable pathogen-
derived peptide.
. Binding of a pathogen-derived peptide to the
groove stabilises the MHC molecule and pro-
motes its transport to the surface for presenta-
tion to a TCR.
T-cell activation
There are two main subgroups of T cells, via their
signals through their TCR, although other signals
involved in the process differ:
. CD8 þcytotoxic T cells detect intracellular patho-
gens, which present peptides on MHC-I.
. CD4 þTh cells detect peptides derived from
pathogens in the endosomal compartment,
presenting peptides on MHC-II.
The crucial stage of activation of T cells is bind-
ing of the TCR, which signals to the interior of the
cell through CD3. This can happen in two ways:
1 Through binding of the TCR to an MHC mole-
cule presenting the relevant peptide: the
speciﬁc allele of the MHC and the peptide
structure are both crucial to the binding of the
TCR, leading to activation. In addition, the co-
receptor of CD4 or CD8 ensures that the binding
is to the correct form of MHC, either MHC-I or
MHC-II.
Superantigens are capable of binding to a TCR
expressing a speciﬁc form of b chain; this can
represent a large proportion of the T-cell popu-
lation,resultinginanexcessiveimmuneresponse.
To activate a na€ıve T cell, it is not sufﬁcient for
a
speciﬁc
TCR
to
recognise
the
correct
peptide–MHC combination. As there is a potential
for the T cell to react to a host-derived peptide,
additional co-stimulatory signals must be pre-
sented to activate the na€ıve T cell. These are pro-
vided by DCs, which are the only cells known to be
capable of activating a na€ıve T cell. There are many
signals in the innate immune response that can
detect the presence of a pathogen:
. Tissue damage: necrotic damage is a hallmark of
infection or wounding, which provides a poten-
tial for infection.
. PAMPs.

Phagocytosis
An exogenous antigen 
may be taken up through 
phagocytosis or, in 
dendritic cells, through 
macropinocytosis. The 
antigen begins to be 
broken down in the 
phagosome.
MHC synthesis
Major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) II is produced in 
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 
where it is transported to the 
phagosome with an invariant 
chain that prevents binding of 
ER-derived peptides.
MHC-II loading
The presence of degradative 
enzymes, combined with the low 
pH, promotes the digestion and 
loss of the invariant chain, and 
allows peptides derived from the 
antigen to bind to the MHC-II 
molecule, stabilising it ready for 
presentation.
MHC-II presentation
MHC II is transported to the cell 
surface, for presentation to T cells. 
Under inflammatory conditions, the 
appropriate co-stimulatory signals 
are supplied to trigger the 
activation of specific T cells.
T cell
Three signals are required for the activation of a CD4+ T-helper cell 
and the polarisation of the helper T-cell response:
1. The specificity of the interaction is ensured by the requirement of 
the TCR to bind to the peptide–MHC complex; CD4 also binds to 
MHC II to ensure that the interaction is with the correct class of MHC 
molecule. 
2. Co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40 and CD28 are expressed 
by the antigen-presenting cell (APC), to signal the need for the 
induction of adaptive immunity. These molecules bind to ligands on 
the T cell – CD40 ligand and B7, respectively.
3. The release of cytokines by the APC and other cells in the local 
environment can influence the polarisation of a T-helper (TH) 
response, towards TH1 or TH2.

peptides. The maturation of a DC increases the
presentation of MHC and promotes expression of
high levels of co-stimulatory molecules.
The T cell needs the presentation of TCR signal
and co-stimulatory signals to the T cell by a single
APC. The binding of antigen to the TCR without
co-stimulation leads to an anergic state in the
T cell, hindering its activation even if it is later
presented with co-stimulatory signals.
CD4 þ T cells
CD4 þ cells are activated to form Th cells, which
direct and drive the immune response through the
production of a variety of cytokines. These can act
to activate or inhibit other cell types to coordinate
an appropriate response; certainly the response
required and the cell types involved in clearing an
intracellular pathogen such as M. tuberculosis dif-
fer from the response to clear a helminth infection.
Initial activation by DCs can polarise cells to one of
two main responses. The polarisation of a Th cell res-
ponse can be determined by three signals (Fig. 15.6):
1 The TCR (signal
1): the TCR binding
to
peptide–MHC is an essential signal, ensuring the
activation of speciﬁc T-cell clones in response to
infection.
2 Co-stimulatory molecules (signal 2): co-stim-
ulatory molecules such as CD40 and B7, pre-
sented by the DC, promotes the activation of
a na€ıve cell, ensuring that any T-cell response is
not due to the presentation of a self-peptide.
3 Polarisation signal (signal 3): the various
cytokines
and
inﬂammatory
stimuli
are
thought to be integrated by the DC to lead to
the expression of a pattern of cytokines
and surface molecules that promote the po-
larisation of the T-cell response. The cytokine
milieu in the lymph node itself is likely
to contribute to this response, e.g. IL-12 is
associated with the development of a Th1
response, whereas IL-4 and IL-10 are associ-
ated with the formation of a Th2 response.
The Th1 response (cell mediated)
A Th1 response is associated with macrophage
activation. The prototypic infection in which such
a response is seen is tuberculosis, where the bac-
terium is able to withstand the acidiﬁcation and
formation of phagolysosomes and thus withstand
killing. A variety of molecules is associated with the
Th1 response:
. IFNg: this is the critical cytokine in the response
that activates macrophages.
. Fas ligand: this surface molecule is important
in killing chronically infected cells, allowing the
release of any surviving pathogens, so that they
may be cleared by fresh macrophages.
. IL-2 promotes proliferation of T cells, increasing
the number of T cells of the reactive clones.
. TNFa: upregulate the general innate immune
response, in particular acting on endothelial cells
to allow additional migration of macrophages
towards sites of infection.
Th2 response (humorally mediated)
The Th2 response is seen in response to helminth
infections and promotes the formation of high-
afﬁnity IgE antibodies. The Th2 response is closely
associated with the activation of B cells, and with
a polarising signal of IL-4 and IL-5 – cytokines
associated with B-cell activation.
Other forms of Th cells
There are other subtypes of CD4þ T cells that
have been identiﬁed. Further subtypes of Th cells
are continually being identiﬁed:
. Regulatory T cells respond to self-antigen and
are able to speciﬁcally suppress the immune
response.
. Th17 cells cause acute inﬂammation and are
typiﬁed by the secretion of IL-17.
CD8 þ cytotoxic T cells
After activation, CTLs can migrate and detect viral
infection through binding to cells expressing the
relevant peptide–MHC speciﬁcity. On detecting
an infected cell, an activated CTL will produce
a cytotoxic response, inducing apoptosis of the
target cell before the pathogen can replicate and
escape the cell. The action of CTLs is tightly
Figure 15.6 Antigen-presenting cells are able to take up antigens through phagocytosis. Through a series of steps
the antigen-presenting cells are able process the antigen and present it in the context of MHC-II molecules to allow it
to bind to and stimulate CD4 þ helper T cells. Antigen-presenting cells are also capable of cytokine release, which
may help direct the activation (or not) of the T cell.

Immunology 401

regulated by the need to bind the TCR to a speciﬁc
peptide–MHC-I combination.
The activation of CTLs requires a similar signal 1
and signal 2, from a DC:
. The speciﬁcity of the reaction is maintained by
the recognition of a peptide antigen bound to
MHC-I, by the TCR. MHC-I also binds to CD8,
expressed by CTLs.
. The interaction of the various co-stimulatory
molecules ensures that the antigen presented
needs the development of an immune response.
On the binding of the TCR to the MHC molecule,
many other molecules bind to form a tight ‘immu-
nological synapse’ between the two cells. Cytotoxic
molecules are expressed on the synapse or released
from cytotoxic granules across this junction,
limiting the cytotoxic effect solely to the cell in
question.
CTLs possess a variety of mechanisms by which
they can mediate their cytotoxic killing, three of
which are particularly prominent:
1 Perforin inserts into the target cell membrane
and polymerises to form pores, similar to the
membrane–attack complex produced by com-
plement. Perforin disrupts the integrity of the
cell membrane, which contributes to killing,
although its primary action is to permit entry of
granzymes into the target cell.
2 Granzymes are released from the cytotoxic
granules and enter the target cell through per-
forin pores. These proteases trigger apoptosis by
activating caspases.
3 Fas ligand binds to Fas, which is expressed on
the surface of the target cells. Binding of Fas
ligand to Fas triggers the activation of caspases
in the target cell, leading to apoptosis. Fas
ligand-mediated killing is a perforin-indepen-
dent process.
The cytotoxic granules possessed by CTLs have
a variety of other enzymes and molecules that
contribute to the induction of cell death in the
target cell. CTLs may alter the function of other
cells through the release of cytokines, in particular
TNFa and IFNg.
B cells: activation and
T-cell help
TheactivationofmostBcellsrequirestheassistance
ofTcells,whicharealsoinvolvedinregulatingclass
switching and somatic hypermutation, the pro-
cess by which higher-afﬁnity antibodies are gener-
ated. There are other groups of B cells that can
generate antibodies without the assistance of T
cells; however, these are unable to undergo class
switching and somatic hypermutation.
B-cell subgroups
There are two groups of B cells in the body. The B-2
cells, the conventional B-cell group, are responsi-
ble for the antibodies produced in an adaptive
immune response. There is a second smaller group
of B cells – the B-1 cells – that produce the so-called
‘natural antibodies’.
B-1 B cell
These B cells are found in large numbers at birth
although the proportion of the B-cell population
that they account for gradually diminishes. These B
cells possess receptors that are effectively germline
encoded and not generated by the same recombi-
natory process as B-2 cells. Often the antigens that
the B cells recognises are self-antigens; anti-DNA
antibodies and anti-blood groups antibodies are
produced by B-1 cells. B-1 cells secrete IgM con-
stitutively and do not undergo class switching.
B-2 B cells
These cells are the conventional B cells that are
found located in the circulation and lymphoid
tissue. B-2 cells require the binding of their speciﬁc
antigen to activate them. B-cell activation can be
classiﬁed into two groups, based on whether T-cell
assistance is required for activation of the B cells:
most antigens are T-dependent, although a few are
T-independent.
T-independent (T-I) antigens
Some rare B-cell antigens are made up of long
repeating units, promoting the cross-linking of
the many receptors on the B-cell surface that are
enough to allow activation of the B cell. Although
this allows a more rapid induction of the B-cell
response, T cells are crucial for somatic hypermu-
tation
and
class
switching,
which
produces
higher-afﬁnity antibodies with a greater degree of
effector functions. Instead, T-I antigens result,
almost exclusively, in the production of IgM
antibodies.

Thymus-dependent (T-D) antigens
On the binding of an antigen to its speciﬁc immu-
noglobulin,theBcellinternalisesthereceptor,com-
plete with its bound antigen. Peptides derived from
theinternalisedantigenareprocessedandpresented
on MHC-II molecules on the B cell. The T cells that
possess a TCR speciﬁc to the antigen-derived pep-
tides can now initiate the activation of the B cell.
B-cell activation triggers migration to germinal
centres of the lymphoid tissue, where the division
and differentiation of B cells into secreting plasma
cells. Plasma cells have large amounts of rough ER
and are specialised for secretion to produce high
levels of antibody. Plasma cells are often found in
the bone marrow – they do not need to remain in
the lymph node to perform their function.
Class switching
One B-cell clone is capable of generating antibodies
speciﬁc to a single epitope. However, depending on
the stage of the immune response, and the type of
pathogen against which it is directed, there may be
a need for the antibody to employ different effector
functions. Different classes of antibody possess dif-
fering constant (Fc) regions that mediate different
effector functions. Class switching is the result of
alternative splicing of the heavy chain mRNA. The
ﬁnal mRNA product of the alternative splicing
expresses only a single constant region sequence,
leadingtotheproductionofanantibodyofthatclass.
The process of class switching is controlled by
various immune signals, in particular cytokines.
. Th2 response: the Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5,
promote the production of the IgE isoform which
contributes to a Th2 response in the clearance of
helminth pathogens.
. The Th1 response is more focused on cell-me-
diated immunity although there is a signiﬁcant
role for antibodies, particularly in protection
from further infection. Although Th1 cytokines
do not have a major role in promoting antibody
production, they inﬂuence the classes that are
produced.Inparticular,IgG2aandIgG3helpclear
infection, through the binding of phagocytic
receptor.
Development of high-afﬁnity
antibodies
In the germinal centre of a lymphoid follicle, B cells
may undergo two processes: afﬁnity maturation
and somatic hypermutation. These processes act
together to produce antibodies with a higher
speciﬁcity.
Somatic hypermutation occurs during rapid
division of B cells. Speciﬁc enzymes are ex-
pressed that generate point mutations in the
immunoglobulin (Ig) gene. The resulting daugh-
ter B cells will have subtly differing speciﬁcities.
Although many of the speciﬁcities produced
are poorer than those of the parent cell, a few
may be of higher afﬁnity, leading to the produc-
tion of a more effective antibody.
Afﬁnity maturation ensures that any antibodies
produced are of the highest speciﬁcity. As the
survival of developing B cells depends on receiving
sufﬁcient signals through their B-cell receptor,
higher-afﬁnity B cells are able to bind antigen more
effectively, which promotes the expansion of that
clone, outcompeting other B-cell clones of weaker
speciﬁcity.
Immunological memory
A key feature of the adaptive immune system is that
an infection by a previously encountered pathogen
is quickly dealt with through the rapid production
of high-afﬁnity antibodies and cell-mediated re-
sponses. This ‘immunological memory’ prevents
the same pathogen causing severe disease twice in
the same individual.
Immunological memory is mediated by the de-
velopment of memory cells after resolution of the
immune response. Memory cells do not require co-
stimulation for their reactivation. They are pro-
duced after infection and migrate to the lymph
nodes in small populations. There, they rapidly
detect the presence of their antigen and mediate
an immune response to it, without the need for the
induction and expansion that is seen in a primary
immune response.
B-cell memory
During the differentiation of B cells to plasma cells,
a few develop by a different route to become
memory cells. In a subsequent infection, these
cells can be rapidly induced to proliferate and
differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells.
Thus, in a primary and secondary immune re-
sponse, the production of IgG has a very different
kinetics. Conversely, IgM is produced by na€ıve B
cells in both cases, and has a similar response in
both primary and secondary responses.
Immunology 403

T-cell memory
Memory T cells are thought to develop directly
from functional effector cells at the end of the
immune response. These cells become dormant,
but are reactivated rapidly in response to their
antigen stimulus.
Effector mechanisms
of the immune system
Once the body has identiﬁed a potential pathogen,
it must activate suitable effector mechanisms to
eliminate it. A variety of different mechanisms may
be recruited based on the nature of the target.
Broadly, they focus on the induction of apoptosis
in pathogen-infected cells, the promotion of path-
ogen phagocytosis and the release of toxic.
Natural killer (NK) cells
NK cells express germline-encoded receptors; they
do not express a receptor generated by recombina-
tion. They are important in the detection and killing
of virally infected cells, and also in stimulating the
adaptive immune response. They do not need to be
activated in the same way as other lymphocytes,
allowing a rapid response to a pathogen.
Activation and effector mechanisms
NK cells are activated rapidly in response to cyto-
kines – in particular IFNg and IL-12. This allows NK
cells to be activated by either the innate or the
adaptive immune systems. NK cells detect viral
infection in cells through their surface receptors,
some inhibitory and others stimulatory.
Natural killer receptors
NK receptors may be inhibitory or activating,
relying on a balance between activating and inhib-
itory signals to activate the killing mechanisms:
. Inhibitory receptors: the best understood group
of inhibitory receptors on NK cells acts through
binding to the a chain of MHC-I molecules.
These molecules are often downregulated during
viral infections, in an attempt by the virus to
evade detection by CTLs. Such downregulation
reduces the ability of CTLs to detect infected
cells, but increases the likelihood of NK cell-
mediated killing, due to the absence of an inhib-
itory signal. NK cells have an important role
during pregnancy in protection of the uterus and
fetus. Unlike T and B cells, there is no potential
for NK cells to attack fetal tissue as ‘non-self’.
. Activating receptors: in response to a viral
infection, the expression of many molecules is
upregulated and they are detected by the varied
activating receptors expressed by NK cells, stim-
ulating killing.
Antibody-dependent cytotoxicity
NK cells may induce killing in response to detec-
tion of bound antibody. The FcgRIII receptor on
NK cells recognises IgG-bound viral antigen on the
surface of infected cells, triggering the NK cell to
induce apoptosis in the infected cell.
Killing mechanisms
NK cells possess similar cytotoxic effector mechan-
isms to CTLs, using cytotoxic granules containing
perforin and granzyme. The surface molecule
Fas ligand, which can induce apoptosis, is also
expressed. NK cells are a major source of IFNg
which stimulates macrophages and Th1 cells.
Macrophages and neutrophils
Macrophages and neutrophils can phagocytose
pathogens and other particles, and then kill them
through a variety of mechanisms; this is crucial
for clearance of many infections. The phagocytic
function of macrophages is also essential in tissue
remodelling and wound repair.
Phagocytosis
A pathogen is internalised through binding of
phagocytic receptors on the macrophage surface.
These receptors recognise speciﬁc patterns on the
pathogen surface, or opsonins – molecules such
as antibodies or complement proteins coating
the surface of pathogens. Ligation of phagocytic
receptors triggers remodelling of the cell surface
membrane, so that the pathogen can be engulfed.
Killing mechanisms
As some pathogens exploit phagocytosis as a meth-
od of entry into a cell, it is essential to ensure that
pathogens do not survive in the macrophage. As
macrophages must operate in both high and low
404
Immunology

oxygen conditions they possess a variety of killing
mechanisms:
. Phagosome acidiﬁcation occurs rapidly after
phagocytosis, and creates a corrosive environ-
ment within the phagosome which, as well as
being directly harmful to the engulfed pathogen,
promotes the activation of many degradative
enzymes, such as those released after lysosomal
fusion. This creates an inhospitable environment
to inhibit the growth of the pathogen and to
destroy it.
. Fusion of lysosomes results in exposure of the
pathogen to many degradative enzymes, allow-
ing destruction of the pathogen. These enzymes
are not oxygen dependent, allowing efﬁcient
killing to occur anaerobically.
. The respiratory burst results in the production
of toxic oxygen species within the phagosome.
These may act directly on the pathogen, or com-
bine with nitrogen or chlorine species to produce
other toxic molecules.
The production of O2
 is crucial in the respira-
tory burst – NADPH oxidase is the crucial enzyme
in this process and its deﬁciency leads to serious
immunodeﬁciency.
Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is also
expressed during the respiratory burst. This med-
iates the production of NO, which is directly
toxic, or may combine with oxygen radicals to
provide more reactive species such as peroxynitrite
(ONOO ).
Activation of macrophages
Activation of macrophages in response to IFNg is
a hallmark of the Th1 response. Activation results
in a number of changes that stimulate macro-
phages to become efﬁcient killers and inducers of
the immune response:
. MHC-II expression increases, allowing macro-
phages to function as APCs.
. Induction of killing mechanisms such as the
respiratory burst promote more efﬁcient killing.
Although this upregulation allows the clearance
of very resistant infections, associated tissue
damage is common as a result of the leakage of
some of the toxic metabolites.
. Activated macrophages are potent cytokine pro-
ducers and produce IL-12. This promotes the
polarisation of newly activated T cells towards
a Th1 phenotype.
Mast cells and basophils
Basophils and mast cells mediate early responses
to infections, in particular to parasites and hel-
minths. Mast cells reside in body tissues, whereas
basophils are found in the circulating blood and
are recruited to sites of inﬂammation.
Mediators of inﬂammation
Mast cells possess granules that contain inﬂam-
matory mediators:
. Histamine induces smooth muscle contraction
in most tissues, except blood vessels. It also
increases T-cell migration by increasing the
permeability of blood vessels.
. Cytokines are produced that promote a Th2
response, triggering the production of eosino-
phils and preventing the formation of a Th1
response.
. Enzymes: a number of proteolytic enzymes are
released from mast cell granules. The products of
the enzymatic reactions promote mucus secre-
tion and smooth muscle contraction, as well as
activating the complement pathways and kinin
pathways.
Other mediators of inﬂammation can be rapidly
synthesised by mast cells following activation.
PLA2 liberates arachidonic acid which results in
the production of leukotrienes (by the enzyme
lipoxygenase) and prostaglandins (by the cyclo-
oxygenase enzymes).
Hypersensitivity, immune
regulation and immune
defects
The regulation of the immune system requires
a ﬁne balance; if the system is too active,
dangerous immune responses may be harmless
antigens or such responses to self-antigens may
occur. If the system is too weak it is insufﬁcient
to clear infection. There is also a need for the
regulation of the immune system in transplan-
tation.
In
this
situation,
immune
responses
against the transplanted organ must be sup-
pressed to allow the graft in question to function
and not be rejected.
Immunology 405

Types and mechanisms
of hypersensitivity
The immune response can produce inappropriate
reaction against a stimulus. Such a reaction may
be very damaging to the body and is known as
a hypersensitivity reaction. This reaction may be
caused by:
. infectious agents (e.g. tuberculosis)
. self-antigens (e.g. thyroid antigens in autoim-
mune thyroiditis)
. environmental antigens (e.g. peanut allergy).
There are four main forms of hypersensitivity
reaction (types I–IV), classiﬁed by the immune
mechanisms that cause them.
Type I hypersensitivity reaction:
anaphylaxis and allergy
Type I hypersensitivity is commonly seen in
allergies. Sensitisation to an antigen leads to the
production of high-afﬁnity IgE antibodies which
associate with mast cells. On subsequent encoun-
ter with an antigen, binding to IgE triggers mast
cell degranulation and inﬂammation, which may
be severe. The severity of the reaction varies, and
may be limited to a skin rash, or runny nose and
irritation. In serious cases, anaphylaxis may result.
Chronic reaction
In many allergic reactions, such as those due to
ingested food antigens, there is only an acute
component. However, with some environmental
antigens (e.g. house dust), prolonged exposure
occurs, which produces a chronic condition, due
to the presence of activated Th2 cells.
Type II hypersensitivity: antibody-
mediated cytotoxic reaction
Type II hypersensitivity reactions result from
the production of reactive antibodies that directly
attack the body. This hypersensitivity reaction is
responsible for some autoimmune diseases.
Type II hypersensitivity reactions can also occur
as a result of antibodies produced against a path-
ogen that cross-reacts with self-antigens. Rheu-
matic fever occurs in this manner as antibodies
produced against streptococcal antigens, which
appear to cross-react with self-proteins).
Antibodies involved in type II hypersensitivity
reactions usually result in loss of function, e.g.
autoimmune thyroiditis. Occasionally, the auto-
antibodies produced are activating: Graves’ dis-
ease is caused by an overactive thyroid in response
to autoantibodies that bind to and activate the
thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor on thyroid
follicular cells. This activating response is referred
to as a type V hypersensitivity reaction.
Type III hypersensitivity: immune-
complex mediated
Type
III
hypersensitivity
is
also
antibody-
mediated, although damage results from activa-
tion of complement by antigen–antibody (Ag/Ab)
complexes. Type III hypersensitivity reactions may
occur in a localised or systemic fashion depending
on the antigen:
. Localised antigen leads to the formation of com-
plexes at the site of antigen exposure (e.g. the
lungs in response to inﬂamed antigens).
. Systemic antigen may lead to the deposition of
immune complexes in many locations through-
out the body. This is particularly important in
joints in which inﬂammation may contribute to
arthritis and in the glomerulus of the kidneys,
which can cause glomerulitis, as is seen in sys-
temic lupus erythematosus.
Type IV hypersensitivity:
delayed-type hypersensitivity
Type IV hypersensitivity differs from the other
hypersensitivity reactions in that it is T-cell
mediated; there is no role for antibodies. This
delayed-type
hypersensitivity
causes
chronic
inﬂammation; as a result of a persistent stimulus,
chronic inﬂammation and tissue damage occur.
M. tuberculosis infection is an example of a type IV
hypersensitivity reaction.
This delayed-type hypersensitivity often takes
days to develop, because it needs the activation
of
large
numbers
of
T
cells,
which
must
accumulate before they can mediate an inﬂamma-
tory response.
Transplantation and rejection
An organ may become damaged, to the point that it
is irreparable, even with medical intervention. At
this point, transplantation of the diseased organ is
required. Although there are mechanical replace-
ments for some organs, these are unable to
406
Immunology

reproduce the same function and lead to a lower
standard of life, e.g. dialysis is currently used to
treat kidney failure and involves repeated visits to
the hospital.
Transplants between individuals are hindered
because genetic information may be different,
resulting in the production of different proteins –
and thus a different set of peptides presented on
the MHC. Moreover, the MHC of the donor and
recipient usually differ. These differences contrib-
ute to the activation of T cells that target an im-
mune response against the graft. For the graft to
survive, it must be tolerated, and the immune
response against it stopped, or at least strongly
ameliorated.
Forms of rejection
The mechanisms by which rejection occurs can be
classiﬁed into three classes based on the timeframe
and the mechanisms involved:
1 Hyperacute rejection requires the existence of
preformed antibodies that react to allograft
antigens (alloantigens), e.g. ABO blood group
mismatch results in hyperacute rejection due to
preformed antibodies produced by B-1 cells.
2 Acute rejection results from the recognition of
alloantigens by the T cells, mediating an im-
mune result targeted directly at the allograft.
This process is mediated predominantly by
mismatch within the MHC genes; T cells react
stronglytoforeignMHC–sothatasmuchas10%
may be activated by a foreign MHC haplotype.
Acute rejection occurs over days to weeks. It is
this process that current transplant protocols
aim to impede to promote allograft survival. The
acute phase of rejection is similar to type IV
hypersensitivity.
3 Chronic rejection is a complex and relatively
poorly understood process that leads to gradual
narrowing of lumen of vessels in the graft. This
process leads to a loss of graft function and
occurs over months or years.
Tolerance
There is the potential for newly produced TCRs to
react to peptides derived from self-proteins, or for
host B cells to react to self-molecules. There are
many processes in place to ensure that this does
not occur:
. Central tolerance is the result of negative selec-
tion of T and B cells.
. Peripheral tolerance allows for the removal of
any self-reactive clones that have escaped central
tolerance.
. Suppression by regulatory T cells in the thymus,
some self-reactive T cells are not deleted, but
develop into regulatory T cells that can speciﬁ-
cally inhibit the adaptive immune response. Reg-
ulatory T cells shut down and limit the immune
response to a self-antigen, thus contributing to
peripheral tolerance.
Immunodeﬁciency
Immunodeﬁciency may be acquired or inherited.
Typically deﬁciencies can be identiﬁed by an
abnormal susceptibility to infection – the type of
infection is often highly indicative of the immune
deﬁciency. Inherited immune deﬁciencies are
typically recessive. Hence, X-linked diseases tend
to be the most common of such defects.
Inherited defects
Inherited defects often manifest rapidly after
birth, and may be associated with other congenital
defects. The susceptibility of the affected individ-
ual to infections depends on the nature of the
defect:
. T-cell deﬁciencies lead to an increased tendency
to develop infections by intracellular pathogens.
A typical inherited T-cell deﬁciency is DiGeorge
syndrome.
. B-cell deﬁciencies are linked to a lack of anti-
body production, resulting in susceptibility to
repeated viral infection and to infection by
extracellular bacteria. Bruton’s agammaglobu-
linaemia is a common inherited B-cell deﬁci-
ency, which results from a defect in signalling of
the B cells.
. Cellular defects of the innate immune system
typically focus on defective migration of cells or
defective killing mechanisms.
Acquired defects
An individual born with a competent immune
system may develop an immunodeﬁciency, typi-
cally through the depletion or loss of a component
of the immune system. The most clinically signif-
icant condition is Acquired immunodeﬁciency
Immunology 407

syndrome (AIDS), which results from the loss of
CD4 þ T cells during infection by Human immu-
nodeﬁciency virus (HIV).
Autoimmunity
Autoimmunity is a hypersensitivity reaction to
a self-antigen. Once activated, autoimmune syn-
dromes may last for days or the remainder of the
person’s life, due to the ever-present nature of
the antigen driving the reaction. Although not fully
understood, many factors are implicated in the
development of autoimmunity:
. Breakdown of central tolerance
. Breakdown of peripheral tolerance
. Molecular mimicry: an antibody or TCR that
reacts with a pathogen may cross-react with
a self-peptide; clearance of the infection resolves
the autoimmune condition
. Tissue APCs may present self-antigen during
infection:professional APCsare recruited tosites
of infection. Although tolerance provides a good
safeguard, self-peptides may be acquired and
presented under inﬂammatory stimuli. If there
are reactive T cells present, an immune response
against a harmless self-antigen may develop
. Cryptic antigens: some antigens are kept physi-
cally separate from the immune system (e.g.
spermantigens).Theexposureofcrypticantigens
to the immune system later in life can lead to an
immune response, if there is no central tolerance
to that antigen (e.g. post-vasectomy).
Genetics of autoimmunity
There is a strong genetic association in many
autoimmune diseases, which has been identiﬁed
through studies of twins. The MHC haplotype is
often the strongest predetermining factor; this
is best illustrated by ankylosing spondylitis, in
which the presence of the HLA-B27 allele is seen
in about 90% of cases.
CLINICAL: Ankylosing Spondylitis
Ankylosing Spondylitis is an autoimmune disease,
very much more common in men. Initial symptoms
are pain in the lower back and thighs. Sclerosis of
the spinal joints occurs, leading to restrictions in
movement of the spine in all planes. In the spine, the
vertebrae become linked through ‘bony bridging’
and calciﬁcation of the ligaments.
Whilst most cases of Ankylosing Spondylitis
express the HLA-B27 allele, the vast majority of
individuals expressing HLA-B27 are not afﬂicted by
Ankylosing Spondylitis.
One of the best-studied autoimmune conditions is
type 1 diabetes. Genetic analysis has suggested that
the HLA-DR3 and DR4 alleles are linked with sus-
ceptibility to type 1 diabetes. It is thought that these
MHC alleles reduce the body’s ability to generate
tolerance against a self-antigen associated with the
condition – in this case, insulin has been implicated.
There is a strong environmental component
to all autoimmune diseases – studies of identical
twins have shown that there is only about a 30–50%
concordance, suggesting that at least half of the
factors contributing to the generation of type 1
diabetes in an individual are the result of environ-
mental stimuli, such as an infection.

Microbiology
Microorganisms that cause disease are termed
‘pathogens’. The source of these organisms may
be external to the body or another location in the
body (e.g. the gut).
In many cases, disease is a by-product of the
infection and provides no advantage to the path-
ogen in terms of helping its replication and trans-
mission. In others, the symptoms of disease spe-
ciﬁcally aid the survival and replication of the
pathogen.
Infectious diseases are still a major cause of
illness and death, even in the developed world.
With the increasing emergence of drug-resistant
strains of pathogen, an understanding of the life-
cycle of a pathogen is becoming evermore impor-
tant: both to identify new potential drug targets,
and to develop methods to prevent transmission.
Microorganisms that cause infectious disease
can be grouped into four broad categories, based
on their structure: acellular pathogens, bacteria,
fungi and parasites. In each group, different strains
of pathogen cause a huge variety of different dis-
ease, and have evolved mechanisms of replication
and immune evasion. To illustrate this, examples
of common pathogens are discussed in detail.
Basic concepts
The body may be colonised by a variety of micro-
organisms. Some of these comprise the commen-
sal organisms that occur naturally on the skin and
at other sites. In their usual site commensal
organisms do not cause disease. In the case of
other microorganisms, their presence always re-
sults in disease.
The relationship between a microbe and its host
can be described in one of three ways:
1 Mutualism – both organisms beneﬁt from the
relationship
2 Commensalism – one organism beneﬁts, al-
though the other neither is harmed nor beneﬁts
from the relationship
3 Parasitism – one organism beneﬁts while caus-
ing damage to its host.
When a microorganism causes disease it is
termed a pathogen, but it may be further classiﬁed
as a professional or a non-professional pathogen:
. Professional pathogens cause the symptoms of
disease to promote their survival and replication,
e.g. enterobacteria tend tocause diarrhoea which
promotes transmission by the faeco-oral route.
. Non-professional pathogens cause symptoms
of disease incidentally and derive little (if any)
beneﬁt from it. Neisseria meningitidis causes
meningitis, which is likely to be fatal if untreated
and therefore does not help transmission of the
disease to another host.
In the terms of microbiology, a disease can be
considered as infection by microorganisms that
have pathology.
Koch's postulates
To establish that an organism causes a speciﬁc
disease it must fulﬁl Koch’s postulates:
Biomedical Science Lecture Notes, First Edition. Ian Lyons.
 2011 by Ian Lyons. Published 2011 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

. The organism can be isolated from each case of
the disease.
. The organism can be grown in culture.
. Injecting the organism into a suitable recipient
will reproduce the symptoms of the disease and
the organism
can
be re-isolated
from
the
recipient.
Koch’s postulates can only be fulﬁlled if the
microorganism is indeed the cause of infection.
In practice, it may be difﬁcult for the postulate to
be fulﬁlled for a number of reasons:
. There may not be a suitable culture system for
the pathogen.
. There is no suitable recipient model.
. The disease may have a latent stage, making it
difﬁcult to isolate or detect.
Routes and transmission
of infection
Infectious diseases must be transmitted to new
hosts so that the causative organism can survive
and replicate. Many routes of transmission have
been identiﬁed that vary with the pathogen and its
source including:
. Airborne (e.g. inﬂuenza virus) in ﬂuid droplets
. Faeco-oral (e.g. poliovirus)
. Mucosal (e.g. HIV)
. Vector borne (e.g. malaria – caused by Plasmo-
dium spp. transmitted by a bite from a mosquito)
. Blood (e.g. hepatitis B virus [HBV])
. Animal bite (e.g. rabies)
. Neonatal – transmission from mother to child
across the placenta, or at or around birth (e.g.
group B streptococci).
Neonatal transmission typically leads to chronic
infections, as a result of the baby’s developing
immune system. Transmission may occur in three
situations:
1 Virus crossing the placenta into the neonatal
circulation
2 Atchildbirth,asaresultofexposuretopathogens
present in the birth canal
3 Virus present in infected milk.
Prevention of infection
The potential for a disease to occur can be
reduced by preventing the spread of the organ-
ism to the individual. The potential for infection
can be abrogated by eliminating or reducing the
number of potential pathogens at possible sites
of contamination.
Sterilisation and disinfection
Physical methods of destroying microbes rely on
heat, which kills or denatures the infectious
agent, or on chemical disruption of microbes by
disinfectants.
Heat treatment may be used either to kill all
microbes or to remove those that are potentially
harmful (e.g. pasteurisation of milk). Depending
on the nature of the materials to be sterilised, either
wet or dry heat is used:
. Wet heat is generally preferred as it works more
quickly, reducing the amount of time that a high
temperature must be maintained. Autoclaving
is the standard method of sterilisation, which
maintains steam at high pressure for 20min, en-
suring the killing of all microorganisms, including
spores.
. Dry heat is used to sterilise materials that cannot
be exposed to moisture. In contrast to the rela-
tively short periods of heating required in
autoclaving,dryheatsterilisationrequiresseveral
hours, usually at 160 C or more to ensure killing.
Pasteurisation is often used in industry to kill
milk-borne pathogens through heating to 72 C for
about 30 seconds. This kills many, but not all,
pathogens; it reduces the risk of developing illness
from milk-borne pathogens, and lengthens the
storage life of milk.
Chemical agents can be used to kill microorgan-
isms through:
. disruption of lipid membrane, e.g. detergents
. modiﬁcation of proteins, e.g. hypochlorite in
bleach is an oxidising agent
. modiﬁcation of DNA.
CLINICAL Nosocomial infections
Hospitals are a source of pathogens; the speciﬁc
pathogens and strains differ from those found in
the community. Furthermore, hospitalised patients
are likely to have depressed immune systems,
increasing the likelihood of infection. Many path-
ogen strains common in hospitals have acquired
resistance to antibiotics (e.g. meticillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA), making them
difﬁcult to treat.

Microbiology

Gamma irradiation can be used to sterilise
items by inducing fatal mutation in the microor-
ganisms exposed to it. The gamma rays break down
the bacterial DNA preventing the replication of the
bacteria.
Vaccination (active immunisation)
Vaccines are used to protect against infection by
inducing active immunity. Vaccines act by induc-
ing immunological memory through the produc-
tion of antibodies and memory T cells. Vaccines
can be ‘live’ or may be ‘killed’ when a dead version
or non-infectious components of the pathogen are
used:
Live vaccines
Live vaccines contain an attenuated (weakened)
form of the pathogen or closely related organism. A
common example is the BCG vaccine, used to
protect against tuberculosis (TB):
. Advantages: live vaccines stimulate production
of immunoglobulin IgA and IgG antibody immu-
nity, as well as cell-mediated immunity. Such
vaccines provide long-lasting protection because
the replicating, but attenuated pathogen (or a
closely related organism) mimics a natural in-
fection. As a live culture can be maintained, live
vaccines are inexpensive to manufacture.
. Disadvantages: a ‘live’ vaccine may spontane-
ously revert to its wild form (e.g. polio vaccine)
andbespreadintoenvironment.Ifsuchavaccine
is administered to an immunocompromised pa-
tient, it may cause life-threatening infection. In
terms of transportation, live vaccines are difﬁcult
because they are unstable at room temperature
and require storage in refrigerated vessels.
Killed (inactivated vaccines)
Dead or inactivated vaccines are incapable of
infectivity or toxicity because they contain no
component that can replicate. Common examples
are the tetanus toxoid (formalin-inactivated teta-
nus toxin) and the inﬂuenza vaccine (formalin-
treated virus particles):
. Advantages: Inactivated vaccines are safer than
live vaccines because they cannot cause or trans-
mit disease. They are far more stable than live
vaccines, helping their transport and storage.
. Disadvantages: as the vaccine does not replicate,
it generates a shorter-lasting immunity than live
vaccines and it is not focused on the normal life-
cycle of the pathogen. The response is restricted
primarily to antibody production; little cell-me-
diated immunity is elicited. In terms of cost,
inactivated vaccines are relatively expensive.
Passive immunisation
Passive immunisation is achieved by the transfer-
ence of antibodies to an individual. The protection
that this provides is only temporary because the
circulating antibodies are gradually cleared and
not replaced.
Passive immunisation occurs from a mother to
her child through IgG, which crosses the placenta
to the fetus from the maternal circulation. More-
over, a mother’s breast milk is rich in IgA, which
protects the neonate’s mucosal surfaces from
pathogen entry.
In a clinical setting, passive immunisation has
been exploited to treat a number of conditions. In
particular, rabies can be treated by the injection of
sera containing antibodies against the rabies virus
into the wound site. Similar treatments can be used
to treat tetanus and snake bites. The serum used in
passive immunisation is often produced from
horses and can lead to an immune reaction to the
foreign proteins within the serum, known as
‘serum sickness’.
Other methods of prevention
Although vaccination is a commonly used method
of prophylaxis, other, less ‘hi-tech’ approaches are
often just as effective including:
. Physical methods, such as quarantine, can be
very effective in preventing the transmission of
disease. The principle behind quarantine is to
isolate the individual to allow any infection, if
present, to manifest itself. This procedure is very
expensive and inconvenient to the patient. Other
methods of prevention include barriers. In the
hospital, gloves are commonly used to prevent
the potential spread of infection to and from
patients.
. Control of vectors and reservoirs of a pathogen
can prevent transmission of infection. This form
of prevention has been effective in combating
malaria through the use of insecticides to kill
malaria-carrying mosquitoes.
. Good hygienic practice is important in the
preparation of food to prevent transmission of
enteric bacteria. Practices such as hand washing
Microbiology 411

between examining patients are essential to
reduce spread of nosocomial infections.
. Education: teaching on how infectious diseases
spread and how they can be prevented is impor-
tant in their control.
Epidemiology
Epidemiology is the study of the effects of health
and disease in populations. A variety of factors
must be considered when studying a disease and
its effects on the population
. Demographic factors, e.g. age, ethnic group,
gender
. Biological and genetic, e.g. blood groups, MHC
(major histocompatibility compex) haplotype
. Socioeconomic, e.g. occupation, income
. Personal habits, e.g. smoking, alcohol consump-
tion, drug use.
The basic reproductive rate of an infection (R0),
is a key value to consider. It is deﬁned as the
number of cases that would result directly from
the introduction of a single infectious individual
into a susceptible population. It can be inﬂuenced
by a number of factors, including:
. The duration of the infectious period
. The ease of transmission
. The density of the host population.
An R0 of 1 means that a single infectious case is
likely to cause one new case in a population;
prevention mechanisms aim to reduce R0.
. For an infection to spread R0 > 1.
. If R0 < 1, the infection is shrinking.
With any microbial infection there must be a care-
ful balance between the severity of the ensuing
disease and allowing its host to survive without
extensive morbidity:
. If infection relies on high motility of host, in-
fection must not cause high morbidity, e.g. HIV
has a long asymptomatic period which promotes
sexual transmission of the virus to many sexual
partners.
. If an infection is highly virulent there is little
need for host motility, e.g. arthropod-borne dis-
eases in which the vector is able to move rapidly
and the host effectively acts as a reservoir for
infection.
. There are some pathogens that are capable of
surviving outside their host. The pathogen may
seek to kill its host rapidly, because it provides a
large source of dead tissue in which it can survive.
If an infection is too virulent it is likely to limit the
life of its host, and reduce the potential for the
spread of infection to new hosts. The transmission
rate of the disease determines the virulence of an
infection.
Some zoonoses, infections that have evolved to
infect a speciﬁc animal host, are fatal in humans
which are not their normal host. Humans may be
‘dead-end’ hosts, from whom further transmis-
sion of the pathogen will not occur, e.g. rabies is
almost always fatal in humans, if untreated. In
bats, the usual host, the disease takes a more
chronic form.
Acellular pathogens:
viruses and prions
Viruses and prions are acellular pathogens that use
host proteins for their replication. They are unable
to replicate outside live cells:
DEFINITION Herd immunity
Vaccination/immunisation
aims
to
reduce
the
density of individuals who are susceptible to an
infection. An immunised individual cannot become
infectious, and thus cannot transmit the infection. If
there are enough individuals within a population
who are immune to infection, this will hinder the
transmission of the infection between susceptible
individuals and is knownas herd immunity. Thereis
a critical level for eradication of an infection, pc,
where pc ¼ 1  (1/R0). R0 is the basic reproductive
rate. If the immunised proportion exceeds pc, the
proportion of non-susceptible individuals is high
enough to break the transmission cycle between
susceptible individuals.
In the case of measles, R0 is estimated to be
around 10, so the critical level for heard immunity
would be:
pc ¼ 1 

This suggests that, for herd immunity to be main-
tained, at least 90% of the population must be
immunised.

Microbiology

. Viruses are a few hundred nanometres at most.
. Prions are aggregates of a misfolded host protein.
Classiﬁcation of viruses and
related particles
The term ‘virus’ refers to the assembly of proteins,
lipids and nucleic acids that replicates in cells.
In addition to the typical virus particles, other
particles exhibit many of the features that have
also been described in viruses, some of which are
produced aberrantly during a viral infection:
. Virion refers to a normal, infectious viral particle
which is capable of attaching and entering a new
cell and replicating within it to produce further
virions.
. Defective viruses contain viral proteins and a
genome, although they lack some components
essential for replication due to mutation or de-
letion of part of the viral genome. Defective
viruses can only replicate in cells that are also
infected with a fully functional ‘helper’ virus (e.g.
hepatitis d requires cells to be infected with
hepatitis B virus for it to replicate).
. Pseudovirions possess a fragment of host DNA
instead of the viral genome. They may form when
the host DNA becomes fragmented in infected
cells.
. Viroids consist solely of a circular molecule of
RNA without associated protein or envelope.
They can cause diseases in plants, but no human
disease has yet been described.
Viral components
Virions are minute (20–300 nm), too small to be
seen by a light microscope. The following are
common components of a virion (Fig 16.1):
. The genome encodes the proteins necessary for
the assembly and replication of new virions. A
viral genome may be made up of RNA or DNA,
either double or single stranded.
. The capsid is made up of repeated protein
subunits which form a stable structure contain-
ing the viral genome. The capsid subunits deter-
mine the shape of the virus. In non-enveloped
viruses, the capsid also contains the viral-bind-
ing site.
. Viral proteins perform a variety of functions.
Some bind to host cell protein to allow entry
into the cell, whereas others have a structural
role, e.g. capsid proteins. Internal proteins, such
as RNA polymerase, aid the replication and as-
sembly of progeny virions. Accessory proteins
help viral survival by potentiating their evasion
of the immune response. Viral proteins provide
the targets by which both antibodies and T cells
recognise the pathogen.
. The envelope is a lipid bilayer that encloses the
capsid. It is found in many viruses and derived
from the host membrane. The formation of an
envelope requires the expression of a matrix
protein to mediate interactions between capsid
and envelope. Viral ‘spike’ glycoproteins are in-
serted into the envelope, forming binding sites to
allow virus entry into the host cell. Due to the
presence of this additional structure, enveloped
viruses tend to be less stable than non-enveloped
viruses.
Types of virus
Viruses are classiﬁed according to the type of
nucleic acids that make up the genome and the
transcriptase enzyme involved in the replication of
the viral genome, both of which determine the
nature of the viral replication cycle.
Viruses can be classiﬁed into seven distinct
groups – the Baltimore classiﬁcation:
1 Single-stranded positive polarity RNA virus
(e.g. poliovirus)
2 Single-stranded negative polarity RNA virus
(e.g. inﬂuenza virus)
3 Double-stranded RNA virus (e.g. rotavirus)
4 Single-stranded DNA virus (e.g. parvovirus)

7 Hepadnavirus (e.g. hepatitis B virus).
The viral life cycle
Viruses must enter a host cell and hijack its internal
machinery in order to replicate. Viral proteins
must be synthesised, to regulate replication of the
genome and produce new virions, and the viral
genome must be copied. After this, many progeny
virions are assembled and released from the host
cell. The life cycle consists of ﬁve distinct stages
(Fig. 16.2):
1 Attachment to the target cell
2 Entry into the cytoplasm (and, if necessary,
nucleus) of the cell
3 Replication of viral genome and proteins
4 Assembly of progeny virions
5 Release of progeny from cell.
Attachment and entry into cells
Proteins on the virion surface bind to speciﬁc
receptors on the cell surface; the speciﬁcity of this
interaction determines which species and cell
types the virus can infect.
For enveloped viruses, fusion of the envelope
with the cell membrane is required for entry of the
viral genome and associated proteins into the cell.
This may occur at the cell surface, or after endocy-
tosis into an endosome. Viral proteins (e.g. gp120
and gp41 in HIV) are able to trigger the fusion of
the cell membrane with the viral envelope.
Interactions of cell proteins directly with the
capsid of non-enveloped viruses lead to confor-
mational changes which release the capsid con-
tents into the cell cytoplasm.

Replication
On entering a host cell, viruses must synthesise the
proteins necessary to allow genome replication, as
well as those that form new virions. The path by
which this process occurs is determined by the
nature of the viral genome.
DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus. Host cell
polymerases produce mRNA and copy the viral
genome. Poxviruses are unusual in that they rep-
licate in the cytoplasm, because they carry a viral
DNA polymerase.
RNA virus replication is restricted to the cyto-
plasm in almost all cases. The major exceptions are
the inﬂuenza virus and retroviruses. RNA viruses
are divided into four major groups with different
strategies for replication:
1 Single-stranded positive-polarity RNA viruses
can use host machinery to produce viral pro-
teins, including an RNA polymerase, directly
from the viral genome. This RNA polymerase is
used to produce a negative-polarity copy of the
viral genome which acts as a template for the
synthesis of further genome copies.
2 Single-stranded negative-polarity RNA viruses
carry their own RNA polymerase for mRNA pro-
duction, as well as to synthesise a template for
new viral genomes.
3 Double-stranded RNA viruses must carry their
own polymerase, similar to single-stranded neg-
ative-polarity RNA viruses.
4 Retroviruses possess a single-stranded RNA ge-
nome which is transcribed into DNA by the viral
enzyme, reverse transcriptase, for integration
into host cell DNA. Retroviruses are unusual in
that they carry two copies of the genome in each
particle.
Viral mRNA is translated into protein by the host
cell ribosomes.
In some viruses, mRNA is translated into pre-
cursor polypeptides (e.g. poliovirus), and then
cleaved into functional proteins by viral protease.
In other viruses, individual mRNAs are translated
directly into proteins, e.g. inﬂuenza virus.
Assembly and release
The viral genome and internal proteins must be
packaged in the capsid. After packaging, the virus
particles are then released from the cell:
. Non-enveloped viruses are typically released by
cell lysis, resulting in cell death.
. Enveloped viruses bud through the cell mem-
brane to form an envelope, although in the case
of the herpesvirus the envelope is derived from
the nuclear membrane. Budding does not direct-
ly cause cell death.
Effects of viral infection on the
host
The precise effects of infection depend on the
nature of the virus, the cell that it infects and the
state of the host.
There are four main outcomes of infection of a
cell by a virus:
1 Death, as a direct effect of the virus or through
the host immune response
2 Fusion of infected cells to form syncytia
3 Malignant transformation (e.g. Epstein–Barr
virus, papillomavirus)
4 No apparent change (as a result of latency), or a
cell may produce virus with no apparent ill
effects.
Spread of virus within the host
Local spread of virus occurs after a short incuba-
tion through transmission of virus to other cells at
the initial site of infection. The virus may also
spread to local lymph nodes, as free virus or within
phagocytes.
Viraemia allows systemic infection, against
which it is more difﬁcult to mount an effective
immune response because the infection is no lon-
ger restricted to a single site.
Symptoms of viral disease
Most viral diseases have similar general symptoms
– fever, myalgia, malaise – reﬂecting a general
antiviral response as a result of the release of
cytokines and other mediators of inﬂammation.
Viruses cause speciﬁc symptoms due to the cell
types that they infect, e.g. paralysis occurs in po-
liomyelitis from infection of motor neurons.
Viral titre during infection
The course of a viral infection can be charted by
the viral titre and broadly classiﬁed as acute or
chronic. It can be also be deﬁned by the eventual
outcome of the disease in the host: resolution
of infection, chronic carrier state or death of
the host.
Microbiology 415

Immediately after virus enters the host, a viral
eclipse phase ensues, in which no free virus par-
ticles are detectable because they have entered
host cells for replication. The viral level increases
as progeny virus are produced:
In an acute infection, a successful immune
response eradicates the virus. In a chronic infec-
tion, a steady state is set up in which virus pro-
duction offsets destruction due to cell-mediated
killing of infected cells. The symptoms of disease
may be the result of repeated damage due to an
incomplete cell-mediated immune response (e.g.
in hepatitis B infection) as well as any direct effects
of the virus itself.
Immune response to viral infection
The immune system is equipped to combat viral
infection. The precise response is speciﬁc to an
individual virus, but the basic mechanisms and
pathways are similar for all viruses.
Interferon
Most
viruses
produce
double-stranded
RNA
(dsRNA) during their lifecycle, a nucleic acid struc-
ture not produced by host cells. The interferon
(IFN) pathway is triggered by the presence of
dsRNA within a cell. Two types of interferon, IFNa
and IFNb, are produced as part of the innate
antiviral responses. IFNa and IFNb are secreted
by infected cells on both the infected cell and its
uninfected neighbours, binding to a common sur-
face receptor. The interferon receptor signals
through JAK/STAT tyrosine kinases and induces
expression of genes that inhibit viral replication.
IFNa and IFNb induce expression of antiviral
proteins including:
. RNAase L – an endoribonuclease that degrades
both host and viral RNA
. 20,50-oligoadenylate synthase which polymerases
ATP to prevent its use as an energy source.
IFNa and IFNb upregulate the adaptive immune
response and activate natural killer (NK) cells.
They also promote expression of major histocom-
patibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules,
thereby increasing presentation of viral peptides
to cytotoxic lymphocytes.
Clearance of virus-infected cells
Much of the viral lifecycle occurs in host cells,
protected from the antibody response. Moreover,
in HIV and some other infections, the viral genome
can become integrated into the host cell genome;
the infected cells must be killed to remove the virus:
. Cytotoxic
T
cells
recognise
viral
peptides,
presented on MHC-I molecules through their
unique T-cell receptor, and may mediate killing.
. NK cells are capable of clearing virus-infected
cells and are not speciﬁc to an antigen (they
recognise broad changes associated with infec-
tion or malignancy), allowing a rapid response as
part of the innate immune system.
Antibodies in the antiviral immune
response
Antibodies neutralise viruses by either blocking
viral binding to surface receptors or disrupting
the structure of the virus. Viruses may also be
cross-linked by antibodies to form complexes,
which can recruit proteins in the complement
pathway to help their clearance. Although anti-
bodies often play a limited role in recovery from
a primary infection, due to the largely intracel-
lular lifecycle of viruses, they have an important
role in the prevention of reinfection. The pres-
ence of IgG in serum and IgA on mucosal
surfaces plays a particularly important role in
protection.
Evasion of the immune system
Viruses have developed methods to avoid the
host immune response, attempting to prolong the
period during which the host is infectious, so as to
promote transmission to other hosts.
Mutation and recombination
Viral polymerases are rather inaccurate during
their replication of the viral genome. The resulting
mutations can change antigenic epitopes on the
viral proteins. The inﬂuenza virus is also able to
recombine segments of genome, resulting in a
major change in the antigenicity of the virus; this
process is known as antigenic shift.
Speed
The adaptive immune response requires about
1 week to develop. Some small RNA viruses may
reproduce rapidly and overwhelm the host before a
strong immune response is generated.
416
Microbiology

Subversion
Viruses may express proteins to alter or modify the
immune response so that it is less effective. This
approach is typically employed by large DNA vi-
ruses, e.g. HIV encodes proteins to downregulate
MHC-I expression.
Location
Viruses may infect speciﬁc cell types to help their
immune evasion. This is particularly evident in the
herpes simplex virus which infects nerve cells.
Nerve cells express low levels of MHC-I, reducing
the likelihood of cell-mediated killing.
Latency
Cellular latency occurs in viruses that are able to
shut down production of new viruses while the
viral genomes remain in the infected cell, reducing
targets of the immune response. The virus may be
reactivated at a later stage – possibly when the
immune system is weakened.
DEFINITION Cellular and clinical
latency
Cellular latency occurs when there is no new virus
production in a cell, despite the cell being infected.
Clinical latency is a transient asymptomatic period
during viral infection: this may be the result of
cellular latency or other factors such as an active
immune response.
Laboratory diagnosis of viral
infection
Viruses cannot be seen under a light microscope
and require speciﬁc cell cultures in order to be
grown in a lab. Identiﬁcation of viruses typically
relies on serological tests and other mechanisms of
detecting antigens or antibodies to viral proteins
from samples isolated from the patient.
The methods of detecting viral infection can be
divided into direct and indirect:
. Direct methods of identiﬁcation aim to detect
some feature of the virus itself – either detecting
presence of the viral genome by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), or detecting viral antigens
using a test such as the enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA).
. Indirect methods look for changes that result
directly from the viral infection, such as the
development and increased titre of antibodies
speciﬁc to viral antigens.
Identiﬁcation of virus using cell
culture
Inoculation
Inoculation of a cell culture with a clinical sample
can provide evidence of viral infection because
the virus may produce characteristic cytopathic
effects, allowing a presumptive diagnosis based
on time to appear and the cell types used in the
culture.
Microscopic identiﬁcation
Virus may be detected by direct examination of
clinical samples. Light microscopy may show
characteristic morphological changes of host
cells, such as inclusion bodies and formation of
giant cells. Under electron microscopy, individ-
ual virus particles can be visualised, allowing
identiﬁcation of the virus based on size and
morphology.
Serological methods
A rise in the antibody titre in a patient must be
detected to distinguish between current infection
and antibodies generated from a previous infec-
tion. Serological diagnosis is often retrospective
because the patient is usually recovering before
results are obtained. In some cases, levels of IgM
antibody may be used to diagnose current
infection.
Detection of viral proteins or nucleic
acids
Detection of viral proteins is achieved using an
antibody to a known viral antigen (e.g. for HIV and
hepatitis B virus), most commonly through an
ELISA test.
The method for detection of nucleic acids
uses PCR to amplify sequences speciﬁc to a
virus, allowing detection even with low levels
of virus in the sample. An assay in which the
level of viral nucleic acid is assessed can be used
to monitor the course of a chronic infection (e.g.
in HIV).
Microbiology 417

Treatments of viral infection
Drug therapies rely on targeting proteins that are
unique to the pathogen. As viruses exploit the host
cellular machinery, such targets are limited. Re-
search is ongoing to develop inhibitors of proteins
unique to viruses. Current examples of such drugs
are reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease
inhibitors. Antiviral drugs are often ineffective in
acute infections because they often need to be
given early before many patients have even seen
a doctor.
Other treatments have focused on enhancing the
immune response to the infection, e.g. IFNb ther-
apy for hepatitis B infection.
Protection can be achieved by an antibody
response – IgA and IgG – neutralising the virus
in the blood or at sites of entry. Protective anti-
bodies can be raised by immunisation or tem-
porarily by administration of speciﬁc antiviral
antibodies, as in post-exposure prophylaxis for
rabies.
Inﬂuenza virus
The inﬂuenza virus, an orthomyxovirus, has
been responsible for a huge number of deaths
throughout history. Major outbreaks of inﬂuen-
za have occurred as a result of the widespread
antigenic variation that the virus can undergo,
particularly through recombination of its ge-
nome with that of inﬂuenza from another an-
imal species.
CLINICAL Inﬂuenza
After a short incubation period (24–48 hours) sore
throat, fever, myalgia and headache can develop.
The sore throat and cough are a local symptom
caused by necrosis of respiratory epithelium. Sys-
temic symptoms are caused by the cytokine
response to viral infection. Resolution usually oc-
curs in 4–7 days, although pneumonia may develop
(bacterial or viral). Inﬂuenza has a signiﬁcant mor-
tality, particularly in elderly and young people.
Those individuals most at risk are immunised annu-
ally. Diagnosis of inﬂuenza is usually made on clin-
ical grounds.
Morphology and structure
Inﬂuenza virus is an enveloped virus around
100 nm in size, containing a segmented, single-
stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. The eight
genome segments are associated with viral pro-
teins,
including
RNA
polymerase,
to
form
ribonucleoprotein.
The viral envelope has two types of viral spike:
1 Haemagglutinin binds to the cell surface re-
ceptor, sialic acid, mediating entry into host
cells.
2 Neuraminidase can cleave sialic (neuraminic)
acid on host cells to allow release of progeny.
These spikes are the major antigenic targets on
the virion – changes in antigenicity of haemagglu-
tinin and neuraminidase are important in estab-
lishing epidemics. Inﬂuenza strains are identiﬁed
by the types of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase
that they contain, e.g. H5N1: avian inﬂuenza.
Phylogeny and transmission
Three types of inﬂuenza virus can infect humans:
1 Inﬂuenza A is found in many different species of
animal and can lead to pandemics.
2 Inﬂuenza B is a milder form and infects only
humans.
3 Inﬂuenza C causes only mild respiratory infec-
tions and not full-blown inﬂuenza.
Transmission of Inﬂuenza virus is by respira-
tory aerosol. This infection is limited to the
upper respiratory tract because it expresses spe-
ciﬁc enzymes that are necessary for the function
of haemagglutinin in host cells. Viraemia is very
rare.
DEFINITION Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The ELISA is a standard laboratory test that can be
used to identify a virus and determine its titre.
Antigen from a clinical sample is bound to the
surface of plastic wells and antibodies of a known
speciﬁcity are added. These can bind to the anti-
gen and excess unbound antibody is washed
away. The antibody may be linked to an enzyme,
or a secondary antibody can be added that is
speciﬁc to the ﬁrst antibody and conjugated to an
enzyme. The enzyme catalyses a colour change in
a soluble substrate. A photometer can then be
used to estimate viral titre based on the intensity
of colour.
418
Microbiology

Replication cycle and pathogenesis
of disease
Attachment and entry
Haemagglutinin binding to sialic acid triggers en-
docytosis. Subsequent entry into the cytoplasm
depends on acidiﬁcation of the endosome. This
induces a structural change in haemagglutinin,
which allows it to fuse with the envelope of the
endosome.
Replication
Unusually for an RNA virus, replication of the
genome occurs in the nucleus where the virion
RNA polymerase transcribes the eight viral ge-
nome segments into mRNA; each segment en-
codes a different protein. The genome is replicated
from positive-polarity templates and associates
with viral protein to form ribonucleoprotein.
Release
The capsid is assembled around ribonucleopro-
teins and progeny virions are released through
budding. Inﬂuenza virus is cytopathic as a result
of the damage that is caused to the internal ma-
chinery of the cell during replication.
Immune evasion
The inﬂuenza A virus has developed two mechan-
isms of mutating to evade immune responses:
1 Antigenic shift occurs through reassortment of
genome segments between species and results
from a cell being infected with two different
strains of inﬂuenza. This may occur in pigs,
which can be infected with both human and
avian inﬂuenza A. This recombination results in
a major shift in the antigenic epitopes of the virus
and may lead to pandemic because existing anti-
bodies are unlikely to offer protective immunity.
Antigenic shift occurs only with inﬂuenza A,
because it is found in a variety of animal species.
2 Antigenic drift occurs through mutations intro-
duced by error-prone transcription. Existing
protective antibodies are likely to exhibit some
cross-reactivity due to the less drastic change in
the antigenic epitopes of the virus.
Immune response
Infection is primarily controlled by the interferon
response to dsRNA and cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTLs) speciﬁc for inﬂuenza-derived epitopes. Pro-
tective immunity results from the generation of IgA
antibodies which are secreted into the respiratory
mucosa, although these are strain speciﬁc.
Treatment
Treatment of inﬂuenza includes amantadine,
which prevents viral entry from endosome to cy-
toplasm by inhibiting the viral M2 protein that is
involved in endosome acidiﬁcation. Amantadine is
effective only against inﬂuenza A and resistant
strains have been identiﬁed.
Zanamivir inhibits neuraminidase, to prevent
release of virus from the host cell. It is effective
against inﬂuenza A and inﬂuenza B viruses.
The usefulness of both therapies is limited by the
factthattheymustbegivenearlyonintheinfection,
often before an accurate diagnosis can be made.
Prevention
Immunisation to prevent infection is preferred to
treatment. The vaccine is grown in chicken eggs,
puriﬁed and inactivated. Consequently, the strains
of inﬂuenza to be included in the vaccine must be
decided 6–9 months in advance, to allow sufﬁcient
time for vaccine production. Protection lasts for
around 6 months because the inactivated virus
triggers rather poor IgA and IgG production.
Hepatitis B virus
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), the causative agent of
hepatitis B, is a hepadnavirus that is thought to
chronically infect over 300 million people. HBV is a
severe global health problem because it is highly
transmissible and infection results in many chron-
ic carriers, who show few clinical symptoms.
Morphology and structure
HBV is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral
nucleocapsid that contains a partly double-strand-
ed circular DNA genome. The viral envelope con-
tains surface antigen protein (HBsAg) which is
produced in excess during infection. Tubes of
HBsAg in the blood of an infected individual are
visible under the electron microscope and are an
important diagnostic marker.
Transmission and phylogeny
Humans are the natural host for HBV. There are
three main routes of transmission:
1 Via infected blood, e.g. drug abuse
2 During sexual intercourse
3 From mother to child during childbirth.
Microbiology 419

After transmission to a new host, the virus enters
the blood and infects hepatocytes through a spe-
ciﬁc cell receptor found on the hepatocyte surface.
Replication is restricted to hepatocytes through the
need for a speciﬁc transcription factor within the
cells.
The surface antigen of HBV is sufﬁciently
conserved for protection from all strains to be
conferred by a single vaccine. From epidemiolog-
ical studies four distinct strains can be identiﬁed.
CLINICAL Symptoms of hepatitis B
Many HBV infections are asymptomatic and can be
detected only by antibody to HBsAg. Clinical symp-
toms includefever, anorexia and vomiting. Impaired
liver function leads to jaundice, dark urine, pale
faeces and high levels of transaminases. Most
chronic carriers are asymptomatic, although some
may have active chronic hepatitis, which can lead to
cirrhosis and ultimately death.
Replication and pathogenesis of
disease
Attachment and entry
HBV binds the sialoglycoprotein receptor which is
thought to mediate uptake into the cells via
endosomes.
Replication
After entering the cell, the virion DNA polymerase
synthesises the missing portion of DNA to form a
complete circular DNA genome, from which
mRNA is synthesised by cellular RNA polymerase.
A template of the viral genome is also synthesised.
Assembly and release
New viral DNA genomes are produced in the new
virus particle from the positive-polarity RNA tem-
plate using the reverse transcriptase activity of viral
DNA polymerase. Progeny HBV with an HBsAg
envelope are released by budding through the cell
membrane in a non-cytopathic process.
Pathogenesis of disease
Viral infection is controlled by cytotoxic T cells that
mediate the killing of infected hepatocytes. The
symptoms of disease result from cell-mediated
immune injury. HBV has a particularly long
incubation period before symptoms manifest –
typically 4–20 weeks.
Chronic HBV infection occurs in about 10% and
is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. This
is due to the repeated damage sustained by the
liver from the immune system, leading to a nec-
essary constant regeneration and therefore a high
potential for cancer-inducing mutation.
A variety of factors promote a chronic state:
. CTL escape mutants
. MHC alleles
. Virus strain variation
. Clonal exhaustion due to high antigen load.
The weaker immune system found in newborns
makes them likely to become chronic carriers.
DEFINITION Hepatitis viruses
There are many different hepatitis viruses that are
found worldwide. These are capable of causing
hepatitis, often chronic:
. Hepatitis A: this picornavirus is transmitted by the
faeco-oral route. It usually causes a mild infection
and is now less common due to an effective
vaccine.
. Hepatitis C: a ﬂavivirus found throughout the
world. It is transmitted by blood and, although an
acute infection is mild, chronic infection often
occurs.
. Hepatitis d: incomplete (dependovirus) virus –
contains circular single-stranded RNA genome.
It can replicate only within cells also infected with
HBV. Hepatitis d virus increases the symptoms of
HBV infection.
Speciﬁc symptoms of viral hepatitis are similar as
because reﬂect a decrease in liver function leading
to jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, etc.
Immune response
The immune response to HBV results in the pro-
liferation of cytotoxic T cells. Antibodies are gen-
erated against the HBsAg which provide lifelong
immunity after recovery.
Treatment
IFNa is used to treat chronic hepatitis B infections.
Reverse transcriptase inhibitors are also useful.
420
Microbiology

Prevention
A vaccine containing recombinant HBsAg pro-
duced by genetically modiﬁed yeast cells has been
developed. The HBV vaccine is administered to
those at high risk of exposure, e.g. healthcare
workers.
Immunoglobulin pooled from patients who
have recovered from HBV can be used to provide
passive immunity in those exposed to HBV-con-
taminated blood (e.g. after a needle-stick injury).
CLINICAL Needle-stick injury
HBV is very easily transmitted by infected blood,
and needle-stick injuries carry a signiﬁcant risk of
passing on HBV infection. There is as much as a
30% chance that a needle-stick injury from a patient
infected with HBV infects the recipient, hence the
need immunise healthcare workers. In contrast,
there is about a 3% chance of developing HCV from
a needle-stick injury from contaminated blood and,
for HIV, about a 0.3% chance of infection.
Poliovirus
Poliovirus is the causative agent of poliomyelitis.
This severe paralytic disease has been almost erad-
icated due to the development of an effective
vaccine, and the fact that humans are its only
natural host.
Structure and morphology
The poliovirus is a small (20–30 nm) member of the
picornavirus family. These are non-enveloped vi-
ruses with icosahedral nucleocapsids and a single-
stranded, positive-polarity, linear RNA genome.
Transmission and phylogeny
Poliovirus is transmitted by the faeco-oral route,
initially infecting gut epithelial cells. The poliovi-
rus exists in three distinct antigenic types.
Replication cycle and pathogenesis
of disease
Attachment and entry
Entry is mediated through binding of the viral
capsid to the poliovirus receptor (PVR) on the host
cell surface. This binding induces a conformation-
al shift in the viral capsid, allowing the viral ge-
nome to enter the host cell.
Replication
The poliovirus genome functions as mRNA – it is
translated into one large polypeptide and cleaved
by a protease encoded within the polypeptide
itself. A complementary negative strand of RNA is
also synthesised, which acts as a template for new
copies of the genome.
Assembly and release
Progeny virion particles are assembled in the cy-
toplasm and released by cell lysis.
Pathogenesis
Most poliovirus infections are minor and restricted
to the gut. In most cases the infection is asymp-
tomatic, although a mild febrile illness may ensue.
Severe infections can result from the spread of
poliovirus to the central nervous system (CNS)
where it infects motor neuron cells. Bulbar polio-
myelitis results from infection of the respiratory
neurons in the brain stem, contributing to respi-
ratory paralysis.
CLINICAL Symptoms of poliomyelitis
Most
poliovirus
infections
are
asymptomatic.
Rarely, severe forms of poliomyelitis are associated
with viral infection of motor neurons in the spinal
cord or brain stem, leading to ﬂaccid paralysis of the
muscles. The motor damage is permanent due to
lysis of the neurons, although some recovery of
motor function is possible after recovery from infec-
tion. In the most severe forms of poliomyelitis, in-
fection of the brain stem occurs, leading to paralysis
of muscles involved in breathing.
Treatment
Treatment is by relief of symptoms, buying time for
the body’s immune response to counteract the
virus through supporting essential functions, in
particular breathing.
Prevention
Immunisation is possible due to the virus’ anti-
genic stability. Two vaccines are in clinical use:
Microbiology 421

1 Salk vaccine, containing formalin-inactivated
virus
2 Sabin vaccine, containing ‘live’ attenuated vi-
rus. This type of vaccine produces more effec-
tive, longer-lasting immunity, although it is
potentially infectious and there is a risk of
causing
disease
in
immunocompromised
individuals.
As there are effective vaccines, and as humans
are the only hosts, the World Health Organization
aims to eradicate poliovirus in the next few years.
As a result, the Salk (formalin-inactivated) vac-
cine is now used, because the number of cases of
polio resulting from the ‘live’ vaccine was ex-
ceeding
those
occurring
from
the
wild-type
disease.
Epstein–Barr virus
The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent
of infectious mononucleosis (‘glandular fever’)
and has been implicated in the development of
some tumours. EBV is common throughout the
world and, by adulthood, the vast majority of
people possess protective antibodies.
Structure and morphology
EBV is a large virus (120–200 nm) consisting of a
icosahedral capsid surrounded by a lipid envelope,
which contains a linear, dsDNA genome. EBV is a
member of the herpesvirus family.
Transmission and phylogeny
Humans are the natural hosts for EBV. Transmis-
sion occurs mainly through exchange of saliva.
Infection in early years of life is asymptomatic,
whereas clinically apparent infectious mono-
nucleosis is more common in adults.
Replication cycle and pathogenesis
of disease
Attachment and entry
Infection occurs in the oropharynx, spreading to
the blood and primarily infecting B cells. Entry is
mediated by the glycoprotein, gp340, which binds
the CR3 complement receptor on B cells. The viral
particle is taken up in an endocytic vesicle and the
viral genome enters the cell after fusion of the viral
envelope with the membrane of the endocytic
vesicle.
Replication
EBV sets up a latent infection in B cells. The viral
genome may integrate into the host cell genome,
although most copies of the genome are found
in the cytoplasm. The linear viral genome be-
comes circular when it enters the cell and rep-
lication relies on the transcription of the DNA
genome to mRNA by host-cell RNA polymerase.
The
EBV
genome
contains
many
‘accessory
proteins’ which are involved in subversion of
the immune response, a hallmark of herpesvirus
infections.
Assembly and release
EBV is unusual in that it has two replication strat-
egies. The latent stage of infection results in the
low expression of viral proteins. EBV may also
switch to a lytic mode of replication, in which
there is release of large amounts of virus from
infected cells. The mechanism triggering switching
from one mode of replication to the other is not
fully understood.
CLINICAL Infectious mononucleosis
Characterised by fever, sore throat, lymphadenop-
athy, anorexia and tiredness. Recovery usually
occurs within 2–3 weeks, although infection may
often recur.
In immunocompromised patients, more serious
conditions can result from EBV infection; a severe
progressive form of infectious mononucleosis can
be seen in children with X-linked immunosuppres-
sive syndrome and EBV has been linked with var-
ious cancers.
CLINICAL EBV and cancer
EBV has been associated with cancers that have a
lymphoid origin – it predisposes individuals to can-
cer, although other co-factors are required. It is
linked with Burkitt’s lymphoma in African children,
nasopharyngeal cancer in Chinese populations and
thymus cancer in the USA.
Immune response
The immune response to the primary infection
focuses on the generation of cytotoxic T cells to
422
Microbiology

kill infected B cells. Antibodies are produced
against the viral capsid antigen.
Treatment and prevention
No effective therapy is available for EBV infection,
although in serious cases aciclovir, a thymidine
kinase inhibitor, may be used because it has a small
amount of activity.
No vaccine currently exists for EBV.
HIV
The human immunodeﬁciency virus was ﬁrst
identiﬁed in the 1980s, following the identiﬁcation
of acquired immune deﬁciency syndrome (AIDS),
for which it is the causative agent. Since then the
disease has spread across the world. It is estimated
that over 40 million people have been infected in
this pandemic, many of whom live in sub-Saharan
Africa.
Properties and structure of the HIV
virion
HIV is a lentivirus, a form of retrovirus that causes
slow, chronic infections. Two species exist:
1 HIV-1, found throughout the world
2 HIV-2, found predominantly in West Africa.
An HIV virion contains two copies of the viral
genome, and reverse transcriptase, protease and
integrase proteins contained within a bar-shaped
capsid and envelope (Fig. 16.3). The viral envelope
contains the glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, which
mediate cell entry.
The glycoprotein gp120 initiates entry of HIV
into host cells through binding to CD4 found on
CD4 þ T cells, and also macrophages and dendritic
cells. The binding of gp120 to CD4 induces a con-
formational shift in gp120, which enables it to bind
to cellular co-receptors, causing the viral gp41
fusion protein to mediate viral uncoating and entry
of the genome and internal viral proteins into
the cell.
The HIV genome contains nine genes:
. Gag encodes the internal core proteins
. Pol encodes reverse transcriptase, an integrase
and a protease
. Env encodes the protein gp160, which is cleaved
to form gp120 and gp41
. Two
additional
genes
for
replication
are
encoded – tat and rev
. Four accessory genes are encoded – nef, vpu, vpr
and vif.
Immune evasion
The
glycoprotein
gp120
possesses
many
‘hypervariable’ regions that mutate particularly
rapidly, preventing block antibodies from binding
to conserved binding sites. This allows a site to be
conserved to mediate entry to host cells through
binding the target receptors, while allowing huge
variation in antibody-binding epitopes.
The high mutation rate which occurs in the
HIV genome is the result of two steps of replication
by an RNA transcriptase, generating large numbers
of mutations.
Transmission and epidemiology
The main route of transmission is by sexual con-
tact. Transfer by infected blood (e.g. in intravenous
drug use) and perinatal transmission are other
signiﬁcant routes of infection. The transmission
of HIV by blood transfusion has been effectively
eliminated after the introduction of screening.
Humans are the only natural hosts of HIV
After the ﬁrst cases of AIDS in the 1980s,
infection has spread widely, resulting in a pan-
demic. In the 1980s in Europe and the USA, HIV
infection occurred predominantly in homosexual
men and intravenous drug users or people with
haemophilia (as a result of infected pooled clot-
ting factors). In recent years, however, heterosex-
ual transmission has become a more common
route of transmission.

Microbiology 423

The infectious dose required to cause HIV infec-
tion is relatively high. Consequently, even repeated
prolonged exposure and needle-stick injuries rarely
lead to infection in healthcare workers.
Replication cycle
After fusion of viral envelope, the viral genome and
proteins enter the nucleus; viral reverse transcrip-
tase then transcribes the RNA genome into dsDNA
which is integrated into the host cell DNA. Inte-
gration, mediated by the integrase enzyme, can
occur at many sites in the host genome. Integrated
viral DNA is transcribed by host RNA polymerase.
The genome is assembled with the capsid and
internal proteins into a virion particle in the cyto-
plasm and budding occurs by cleavage of envelope
polypeptides at the cell membrane.
Pathogenesis of HIV and the immune
response
Infection initially targets dendritic cells and macro-
phages in the genital tract. These cells migrate to the
lymph nodes, where infection of CD4þ T cells
subsequently occurs. Viraemia happens about a
week after infection. After an initial viraemia the
virus level drops, which may reﬂect control of in-
fection by the adaptive immune response. HIV
causes persistent infection of T cells. A patient in-
fected with HIV is considered to be infected for life.
The main immune response to HIV is through
the activation of speciﬁc CTLs. Their failure to
control HIV infection leads to an increase in
viral titre associated with the decline in the
CD4 þ
T-cell count that typiﬁes AIDS. CTLs
lose their effectiveness because they no longer
receive cytokine signals to sustain activation due
to lack of CD4 þ T cells.
The virus genome mutates at a high rate; ‘escape
mutants’ may develop to which the CTLs are in-
capable of responding. Antibodies produced in
response to HIV infection are poorly neutralising
and so have little effect on disease progression.
HIV has developed three main mechanisms to
aid immune evasion:
1 The integration of viral DNA into host cell DNA
causing persistent infection
2 The high rate of mutation of genome resulting in
rapid changes to antigens
3 Production of tat and nef proteins which act to
downregulate MHC-I,preventing recognition of
infected cells by CTLs.
CLINICAL AIDS
AIDS is deﬁned by a number of criteria, which
may include the presence of an ‘AIDS-deﬁning
pathology’ (such as Kaposi’s sarcoma or Pne-
umocystis pneumonia) or a CD4 þ cell count
<200 cells/mL of blood.
AIDS results from the low CD4 þ count caused by
severe
HIV infection. The weakened immune
system allows opportunistic infections. Additional
effects of chronic HIV infection include dementia, as
a result of infection of microglia in the brain, and the
development of tumours, often as a result of infec-
tion by a tumour-causing virus.
After an initial viraemia, a set point occurs where
the viral titre is maintained at a low level by cell-
mediated immune response. This is typiﬁed by a
low or absent level of virus in the blood and a long
period of clinical latency, although virus levels
remain high in the lymph nodes.
Towards the end of the latent phase, AIDS-re-
lated complex, characterised by fever, fatigue and
weight loss, may occur. AIDS-related complex usu-
ally advances rapidly to AIDS.
Treatment of HIV infection
The standard therapy for HIV infection is HAART
(highly active antiretroviral therapy), consisting of
two reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a protease
inhibitor. Use of more than one drug acting on
different targets reduces the ability of the virus to
mutate to escape the action of all the drugs.
Reverse transcriptase inhibitors
These may be nucleoside analogues (e.g. zidovu-
dine) that reverse transcriptase incorporates into
transcripts, causing chain termination. These nu-
cleoside analogues are not used by host cell poly-
merase so there is no effect on host cell nucleic acid
polymerisation. The non-nucleoside reverse tran-
scriptase inhibitors (e.g. nevirapine) act directly
on the reverse transcriptase enzyme, at a different
site. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors are also used
to treat retroviral infections and HBV.
Protease inhibitors (e.g. saquinivir)
Many viruses encode a protease to produce viral
proteins, the inhibition of which prevents forma-
tion of functional viral proteins, thus preventing
formation
of
progeny
virions.
The
protease
424
Microbiology

structure is distinct from host cell proteases, allow-
ing the development of speciﬁc drugs.
HAART cannot cure HIV infection, although it is
effective in prolonging life. It improves health and
quality of life and allows an increase in CD4 þ
T cells.
Prevention of HIV
There is currently no vaccine available. Prevention
of transmission is the best way of avoiding infec-
tion. Methods of prevention include promotion of
condom use and (in drug addicts) avoidance of
needle sharing.
Steps taken to reduce the likelihood of transmis-
sion from mother to child include:
. giving antiretroviral drugs to mother and child
around the time of birth
. avoidance of breastfeeding to prevent passing on
the virus in milk
. caesarean section to lower the risk of HIV trans-
mission during birth.
Prions
Prions are a misfolded version of a normal host
cellular protein, prion-related peptide (PrP), which
are thought to be induced to misfold as a result of
interactions with the prion.
Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) is the
most well-known prion disease; it is believed to
result from the ingestion of meat derived from
cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE or ‘mad cow disease’).
Prion diseases are characterised by:
. spongiform degeneration of nerve cells
. formation of amyloid plaques – aggregates of
prion protein
. loss of nerve cells.
CLINICAL Symptoms of vCJD
Variant CJD is a neurodegenerative disease, char-
acterised by dementia and gradual loss of cognitive
function; it is accompanied by movement problems
such as an abnormal gait and myoclonus.
Presumptive diagnosis is based on clinical
symptoms. Deﬁnitive diagnosis requires a brain
biopsy during life or histological examination of
postmortem tissues.
There is currently no known treatment or vac-
cine for prion diseases. Little is known about the
precise mechanisms by which ingestion of prions
leads to prion diseases.
Bacteria
Bacteria are prokaryotes that can colonise a huge
variety of niches in the environment and in a host,
both inside and outside host cells. Bacteria are
capable of independent replication, and many
have adapted to cause disease to aid their replica-
tion. With some bacteria disease is ‘accidental’ – it
does not help replication or survival of the bacterial
colony.
Bacterial structure and
morphology
Bacteria are much smaller than eukaryotic cells,
typically around 1 mm in length. Some organelles
are possessed by all bacteria, but there is a wide
variety in morphology and other features.
Morphology
Bacteria are classiﬁed by their shape. Three com-
mon morphologies are:
1 bacilli – rod shaped (e.g. Clostridium tetani)
2 cocci – round (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus)
3 spirochaetes – spiral shaped (e.g. Treponema
pallidum).
Bacteria can be further identiﬁed by their char-
acteristic arrangement as individuals, in clusters,
chains or pairs.
Structures
Bacteria do not have membrane-bound organelles,
although four essential structures can be identiﬁed
(Fig. 16.4):
. The nucleoid is a single circular chromosome
around 106–107 base-pairs in length. It is free
ﬂoating in the cytoplasm.
. The cytoplasm contains ribosomes and the
nucleoid. Bacterial ribosomes are smaller (70S)
than eukaryotic ribosomes (80S). In addition, the
cytoplasm contains a bacterial cytoskeleton.
Microbiology 425

. The cytoplasmic membrane encloses the bac-
teria.
This
lipid
bilayer
has
a
number
of
functions:
– regulation of transport of molecules into and
out of the cell
– permeability
barrier
to
maintain
osmotic
pressure
– maintenance
of
gradient
for
energy
generation.
. The mesosome is an invagination in the cyto-
plasmic membrane that is crucial in cell division.
. The cell wall maintains cell shape and provides
protection.
Bacteria may also possess other structures:
. Pili and ﬁmbriae – short projections that are
involved in movement or conjugation. Pili may
express adhesin proteins which mediate attach-
ment to surfaces.
. Flagella – a whip-like tail structure associated
with motility. Bacteria may be multiﬂagellated,
possess a single ﬂagellum or have no ﬂagella.
. Photosynthetic material,
. Storage granules,
. Capsule – this provides additional protection
from phagocytosis by immune cells, and from
drying out in the external environment.
. Plasmids are small accessory chromosomes,
usually circular and around 2–1000 kilobase-
pairs in size, which can replicate independently
of the nucleoid and provide accessory functions.
Plasmids may be transmitted between bacteria
through conjugation.
The bacterial cell wall
The classic method of identifying bacteria in a
clinical sample is by means of a Gram stain
(Fig. 16.5):
. A Gram-positive cell wall contains a thick
layer of peptidoglycan containing ﬁbres of
lipoteichoic acid that protrude out of the cell
wall.

Microbiology

. The Gram-negative cell wall has a more com-
plex structure, possessing an outer membrane
and a periplasmic space containing a thin
layer of peptidoglycan. Gram-negative cell
walls contain the endotoxin lipopolysaccha-
ride (LPS).
A few bacteria cannot be classiﬁed using the
Gram stain. The most clinically signiﬁcant bacteria
in these groups are the mycobacteria, which pos-
sess acid-fast cells walls. These cell walls are not
decoloured by acid alcohol after staining by car-
bolfuchsin, due to the high concentrations of my-
colic acids.
DEFINITION Gram stain
The Gram stain is performed by smearing bacteria
on to a slide and then staining with crystal violet.
Iodine is added, colouring all the cells blue due to
the iodine–violet complex that results. An organic
solvent is used to wash away the violet stain from the
Gram-negative bacteria only:
. Gram-positive bacteria retain the blue stain due
to the high levels of peptidoglycan.
. Safranin is used to counterstain Gram-negative
bacteria a pink colour.
DEFINITION Peptidoglycan
Peptidoglycan is an essential component of the
bacterial cell wall. It is a network of carbohydrate
strands cross-linked by short peptides made up of
both D- and L-amino acid molecules. D-Amino acids
are not used by the human body because it is
these that are targeted by the penicillin family of
antibiotics,
allowing
selective
toxic
action
on
bacteria.
Bacterial cell growth
Bacteria reproduce by binary ﬁssion, one parent
dividing into two daughter cells, although the rate
at which this occurs – the doubling time – varies
between species. Escherichia coli may divide every
20 min, whereas mycobacteria divide only every 24
hours.
Bacterial growth can be divided into four phases
(Fig. 16.6.), the standard growth curve:
1 Lag phase – vigorous metabolic activity occurs,
although little growth, as the bacteria acclima-
tise to their new conditions.
2 Log phase – during this phase there is rapid
growth and cell division, because environmental
conditions are optimal for the bacteria.

Microbiology 427

3 Stationary phase – new cells resulting from
replication match the number of dying cells,
reaching a steady state. The stationary phase
may be caused by nutrient depletion, the pres-
ence of toxins, or a combination of these and
other factors.
4 Death phase – the rate of death in the culture
exceeds the rate at which the cells are being
replaced by the generation of new cells.
Bacterial pathogenesis
Bacterial infections must establish themselves as a
colony before causing disease. This is achieved in a
series of continuous steps:
. Entry into body – or in the case of commensals,
this may be by moving from one site in the body
to another.
. Evasion of primary defences, such as stomach
acid and mucus secretions.
. Adherence to and colonisation of host – many
bacteria have specialised structures to aid adher-
ence (e.g. pili of E. coli mediate attachment to
urinary tract epithelium). Foreign bodies help
infection because host phagocytes are unable to
adhere well due to a lack of binding proteins.
. Evasion of host immune response.
Local effects and secretions
in bacterial infection
Bacteria secrete compounds to help their coloni-
sation of the local environment. Many are enzymes
that digest and dissolve the local surroundings,
allowing uptake of nutrients by passive diffusion.
Other toxins, such as leukocidins, protect the bac-
teria through killing host leukocytes. Bacteria may
also secrete toxins to aid their replication and
survival.
Systemic effects of bacterial
infection
Systemic effects result from bacteria within the
blood, bacteraemia, or the release of a bacterial
toxin into the blood. Septic shock may result from
severe bacterial infection and can be caused by a
variety of toxins.
LPS is the most well-established cause of septic
shock. This endotoxin is an integral part of Gram-
negative cell walls and is not secreted. The toxic
portion of LPS is lipid A which is made up of
disaccharides with several fatty acids attached.
CLINICAL Septic shock
Septic shock is characterised by high fever and
hypotension. It results from excessive release of
cytokines in response to bacterial toxins such as LPS
and toxic shock syndrome toxin. Cytokine release
triggers mass vasodilatation and may activate many
immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells,
triggering further cytokine production. There is a high
risk of mortality (as much as 70%) due to the occur-
rence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
The decreased movement of blood stimulates the
onset of clotting in the capillaries of organs through-
out the body, triggering multiple organ failure.
Types of toxin
The toxins produced by bacteria can be divided
into two classes:
1 Exotoxins are actively secreted by bacteria, us-
ually to help the organism survive. Some exoto-
xins break down tissues to provide nutrients and
others prevent an effective immune response.
2 Endotoxins are not secreted; they are an integral
part of the bacteria and are released on the death
of the organism.
Immune evasion
Evasion of the immune system is essential if bac-
teria are to colonise tissues and survive. Bacteria,
similar to viruses, have developed a variety of
different mechanisms to achieve this:
. Host mimicry –antigenic targets on bacteria (e.g.
capsule antigens) may mimic the structure of a
host molecule, preventing the immune response
from developing effective antibodies to the path-
ogen, e.g. Neisseria meningitidis group B, in
which the capsule polysaccharide is identical to
a host molecule, NCAM-1
. Absence of tissue damage – the lack of ‘danger
signals’ due to tissue damage slows the immune
response. Many of the mediators that recruit
leukocytes to a site of infection are not produced,
hindering such a response.
. Antigenic variation – varying the antigen mole-
cules that a pathogen presents will impede the
immune response, because each effective re-
sponse is rapidly made obsolete, through the
bacteria presenting new antigenic epitopes and
losing the old, e.g. N. gonorrhoeae.
428
Microbiology

. Intracellular phase – bacteria that are situated in
cells are protected from antibodies and phago-
cytosis, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
. Antibody inactivation/proteolysis – some bacte-
ria possess IgA protease (e.g. streptococci) which
can hydrolyse IgA found in mucus secretions.
Other bacteria use antibodies in other ways to
evade the immune response, e.g. staphylococci
present protein A in cell walls that binds to the Fc
portion of IgG. This prevents activation of com-
plement and restricts opsonisation of bacteria.
. Cytotoxins – some bacteria secrete exotoxins that
kill host (particularly immune) cells, e.g. leukoci-
dins kill both neutrophils and macrophages.
Gene motility in bacteria
Some bacteria possess mechanisms for transfer-
ring genetic information between strains, or even
between species. Such mobile genetic elements
include genes that encode virulence determinants,
such
as
toxins,
and
genes
aiding
antibiotic
resistance.
Vectors by which genes may be
transferred
Bacteriophages
Viruses that infect bacteria may, in some cases,
produce virus particles that transport a section of
bacterial DNA instead of the viral genome, allow-
ing transfer of genetic information to another
bacterium
Plasmids
Plasmids are small additional molecules dsDNA
external to the nucleoid and capable of replication
independent of the nucleoid. They are usually
circular, although they may be linear. An individ-
ual bacterium may contain several plasmids.
Plasmids may carry genes with medical impor-
tance (e.g. toxins or antibiotic resistance genes).
Transposons
These mobile segments of DNA may move be-
tween bacteria or between DNA of bacteria, plas-
mids and bacteriophages. In addition to the genes
regulating excision from genetic material and in-
tegration at a new site, transposons can also con-
tain genes for drug resistance enzymes or toxins.
Unlike plasmids, transposons are not capable of
independent replication, and replicate with the
recipient DNA.
Mechanisms of gene transfer
Horizontal transfer of genes between bacteria is
particularly signiﬁcant when the transferred genes
encode toxins or antibiotic resistance proteins.
Three methods for horizontal gene transfer have
been identiﬁed:
1 Conjugationisthematingoftwobacteria,where
DNA is transferred from donor to recipient cell.
This process is controlled by genes within the
plasmid by which the plasmid is transferred to
the recipient cell through a sex pilus. Newly
acquired genes can recombine into the recipient
genome
2 Transduction is transfer of DNA via a bacterio-
phage virus. During viral assembly in the in-
fected cell, bacterial DNA may be incorporated
into a viral particle and carried to a recipient cell.
This process may result in the recipient cell
becoming pathogenic, e.g. cholera toxin gene is
acquired through transduction.
3 Transformation occurs when there is transfer of
DNA between cells. This occurs in nature when
dyingcells releasetheir DNA,which may betaken
up by living cells. Transformation is frequently
used in research to genetically alter bacteria,
although it is not clear if it has a role in disease.
The transfer of genes between sites in a bacte-
rium is achieved by transposons. This process can
be exploited in antigenic variation, as is the case in
Borrelia species. Rearrangement results in move-
ment of genes from silent storage sites to an active
site where transcription and translation of the gene
can occur, resulting in the expression of a different
antigenic protein.
Many virulence factors are often clustered to-
gether in ‘pathogenicity islands’ and may repre-
sent large regions of genome inherited as a single
block. This is a common feature in many Gram-
negative rods, e.g. E. coli, Salmonella spp.
Commensal bacteria
The human body naturally has a microﬂora of
many different strains of bacteria, which colonise
the skin and mucosa; the presence of bacteria on
these surfaces is not an indication of disease. The
internal organs and blood are usually sterile; the
presence of bacteria at these sites is an indication
of disease.
The normal ﬂora in the body varies with site,
owing to the different microenvironments present.
Microbiology 429

Commensal bacteria can be advantageous to the
host in preventing colonisation of the site by path-
ogenic strains and may also produce compounds
that are of beneﬁt to the host. Normal ﬂora may be
made up of bacteria and fungi, never viruses and
parasites.
Normal ﬂora of the skin
Staphylococcus epidermis is a bacterium normally
prevalent on the skin. It is non-pathogenic in this
locale, but may cause disease at other sites, e.g. on
prosthetic heart valves. Most commensals live on
the skin surface, although some reside in hair
follicles. The yeast Candida albicans is also part
of the normal skin ﬂora.
Normal ﬂora of the respiratory tract
The upper respiratory tract is colonised by a wide
variety of organisms, whereas the lower respiratory
tract is sterile. In the nose, staphylococci and
streptococci are prevalent. Staphylococcus aureus
may reside here as a commensal, and can be a
source of infection in other loci. In the throat,
Streptococcus viridans and staphylococci predom-
inate, and prevent the growth of pathogenic spe-
cies on the pharyngeal mucosa. Anaerobic bacteria
may be found in crevices in the gums.
Normal ﬂora of the gastrointestinal
tract
The stomach is essentially sterile due to the harsh,
lowpHenvironment,althoughthesmallintestineis
usually colonised by streptococci, lactobacilli and
yeasts. There are large numbers of bacteria in the
colon, including many anaerobic strains. Intestinal
bacteria can produce small amounts of vitamin
B and vitamin K and may be an important source
of these vitamins in malnourished individuals.
Commensals in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract
help prevent the growth of pathogenic strains. The
use of antibiotics can, however, suppress the
growth of normal ﬂora and so lead to the growth
of pathogenic strains. Due to the high number of
bacteria, the GI tract may be a source of infection in
other parts of the body. In particular E. coli is a
major cause of urinary tract infection.
Normal ﬂora of the Genitourinary (GU)
tract
The vaginal mucosa is primarily colonised by lac-
tobacilli, inhibiting colonisation by pathogens
such as C. albicans. Bacteria found in the vaginal
canal may cause infection during childbirth. Urine
in the bladder and ureters is sterile in a normal
individual.
Laboratory identiﬁcation of
bacteria
To start effective treatment of a bacterial infection,
it is necessary to identify the strain of bacteria
through a variety of tests. The presence of bacteria
in the skin and mucosa is normal and is not suf-
ﬁcient to indicate disease. In contrast, presence of
bacteria in the blood or the cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) is always an indicator of disease.
Initial identiﬁcation of bacteria involves the
Gram stain to determine cell wall structure. In
addition, the morphology of individual bacteria
and the general structure of bacterial colonies may
help identiﬁcation. The clinical features of an ill-
ness, the bacterial morphology and the Gram stain
are often sufﬁcient for presumptive diagnosis. Se-
lective media can be used to aid isolation and
identiﬁcation of bacteria:
. Blood agar is the medium used to grow most
bacteria.
. Chocolate agar is used primarily in the culture of
Neisseria spp. It is made up of blood agar that has
been heated to inactivate complement proteins.
. MacConkey’s agar allows the culture of enteric
bacteria and contains bile salts to restrict the
growth of non-enteric species. The medium also
contains lactose and an indicator, allowing the
distinction of lactose-fermenting bacteria.
. L€owenstein-Jensen medium contains a com-
plex mix of substances, including egg proteins.
It allows the culture of mycobacteria, while pre-
venting the growth of many other species that
would
normally
outcompete
mycobacterial
growth.
After the use of selective media, bacterial mor-
phology and clinical symptoms, more detailed
identiﬁcation of bacteria may include speciﬁc tests
to identify the presence of speciﬁc enzymes and the
detection of speciﬁc antigenic markers. A limited
number of laboratory tests can be used to identify
many clinically important bacteria (Fig. 16.7).
Treatment of bacterial infection
The main method of treatment for most bacterial
infections is antibiotics – drugs that act speciﬁcally
to kill bacteria. Physical methods of removing
bacteria can be used to aid healing.

Physical methods of treatment
Debridement is the cleaning of an open wound,
which allows removal of foreign bodies and dead
tissue to help healing. Surgical drainage can be
used to remove pus and bacteria from an abscess,
although the wound resulting from drainage may
become a source of infection itself.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics inhibit the growth of the microorgan-
ism while causing minimal damage to the human
host. They work on the principle of selective tox-
icity, targeting an aspect of the microorganism’s
physiology that differs from that of a human. Anti-
biotics can be classiﬁed as bactericidal or bacteri-
ostatic, and can be narrow spectrum or broad
spectrum. Often more than one antibiotic is given
at the same time, because drug resistance is prev-
alent. Using a second (or even a third or fourth)
drug in combination reduces the risk of drug re-
sistance developing.
DEFINITION Bactericidal and bacterio-
static antibiotics
Bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria, whereas bac-
teriostatic antibiotics inhibit their replication – the
host immune defence systems are required for
elimination of bacteria.
DEFINITION Narrow- and broad-spec-
trum antibiotics
Broad-spectrum antibiotics are effective against a
wide range of organisms.
In contrast, narrow-spectrum antibiotics are
effectiveagainstone,orveryfewtypesof,organisms.
Inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis
(e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins)
Inhibition
of
bacterial
wall
synthesis
occurs
throughinhibitionoftranspeptidases, theenzymes
that catalyse the cross-linking of peptidoglycan.
The b-lactam ring structure of these anti-
biotics mimics that of the terminal dipeptide in
the peptidoglycan chain – D-alanyl-D-alanine –
competitively inhibiting the transpeptidase en-
zyme’s active site.
Penicillins and cephalosporins are only bacteri-
cidal during the bacterial growth period when new
peptidoglycan is being synthesised.
Vancomycin blocks transpeptidation through a
different mechanism. It binds directly to D-alanyl-
D-alanine, preventing recognition by the enzyme’s
active site.
Inhibition of protein synthesis
Drugs that target the smaller ribosomal subunit
The selectivity of these ribosomal inhibitors is
based on increased uptake into bacterial cells
compared with human cells. They are capable of
inhibiting the ribosomal target in both humans
and bacteria.
. Tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline) bind the smaller
ribosomal subunit preventing tRNA from bind-
ing to an acceptor site on the ribosome.
. Aminoglycosides inhibit initiation of translation
and cause misreading of mRNA such that incor-
rect amino acids are inserted. This leads to mem-
brane damage and bacterial death.
Drugs that target the larger ribosomal subunit
. Chloramphenicol inhibits peptidyltransferase,
preventing formation of new peptide bonds.
Some bone marrow toxicity may occur due to
incomplete selectivity for bacteria over the hu-
man host.
. Macrolides (e.g. erythromycin) prevent release
of uncharged transfer RNA (tRNA) from the
donor site after the peptide bond has been
formed.
Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis
. Sulphonamides inhibit synthesis of tetrahydro-
folic acid, required as a methyl donor in the
synthesis of nucleotides.
. Trimethoprim also inhibits synthesis of tetrahy-
drofolic acid, but by inhibiting a different
enzyme target to sulphonamides. This enzyme
is present in both humans and bacteria, although
trimethoprim has a higher afﬁnity for the bacte-
rial form of the enzyme.
. Quinolones (e.g. ciproﬂoxacin) inhibit bacterial
DNA gyrase.
. Rifampicin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase.
432
Microbiology

Inhibitors of mycolic acid synthesis
These inhibitors (e.g. isoniazid) are used to treat
mycobacterial infections.
Speciﬁcity for anaerobic environment
Metronidazole acts as an electron sink, preventing
metabolic reduction. On acquiring electrons, the
drug ring is cleaved to a toxic intermediate that
damages DNA.
Use of antibiotics in combination
Combinations of antibiotics may be used to treat
serious infections. The acquisition of resistance to
multiple antibiotics is much less likely than resis-
tance to a single antibiotic.
Antibiotics may work synergistically (e.g. tri-
methoprim and sulphonamides, which act on the
same metabolic pathway) to produce a greater
effect than either agent individually. Other combi-
nations of antibiotics may belesseffective together,
e.g. using penicillins (which act on growing cells)
with another antibiotic that inhibits cell growth.
Antibiotic resistance
Innate resistance
Some bacteria have an innate resistance to certain
antibiotics as a result of their metabolism and
structure, e.g. Mycoplasma spp. lack cell walls, so
penicillin has no effect.
Acquired resistance
Acquired resistance can occur as a result of a
genetic change:
. Mutation may occur in the gene encoding the
target molecule, or the transport mechanism by
which the drug is taken up.
. Acquisition of a resistance gene on a plasmid or
transposon. A variety of different mechanisms
are employed by resistance genes:
– the gene product may inactivate the drug, e.g.
penicillin resistance by b-lactamase
– resistance genes may encode an enzyme that
alters the drug target site, e.g. erythromycin-
resistant protein methylates a 50-S ribosomal
subunit, preventing binding of drug
– a resistance gene may encode proteins that can
actively remove the drug from cells, e.g. sul-
phonamide resistance results from a speciﬁc
transport protein.
Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem
due to:
. inappropriate prescription by doctors
. use of antibiotics in farming
. failure by patients to complete their course of
treatment.
CLINICAL Testing for antibiotic
resistance
Efﬁcacy of an antibiotic against a speciﬁc organism
can be tested. Antibiotic-impregnated discs are
placed on agar inoculated with target bacteria. The
diameter of the zone of growth inhibition of the
microorganism around the disc is compared with
standards to determine sensitivity of the bacterium
to the antibiotic.
Probiotics
Live non-pathogenic strains of bacteria (probio-
tics) may be used to treat or prevent disease;
Lactobacillus sp. has been used to reduce occur-
rence of childhood diarrhoea. These probiotics are
thought to act in a number of ways: they may
colonise a niche preventing a pathogenic strain
from causing infection, or they may promote an
immune response that is effective against the
pathogen.
Pyogenic Gram-positive bacteria
Pyogenic, ‘pus-forming’ bacteria are a common
source of infections. Typically, infection with pyo-
genic bacteria results in abscesses, although more
serious infections can also occur. Two clinically
important pyogenic bacteria are Strep. pyogenes
and Staph. aureus.
Streptococcus pyogenes
Strep. pyogenes is the leading bacterial cause of
pharyngitis and cellulitis, and is found as a com-
mensal on the skin and in the oropharynx of many
individuals; it can cause infection on entering the
tissues or blood.
Structure and morphology
Streptococci are Gram-positive cocci, typically
arranged
in
chains
or
pairs.
They
can

Microbiology 433

distinguished from staphylococci that are catalase
positive. Streptococci can cause a wide range of
diseases due to pyogenic inﬂammation, exotoxins
and immunological cross-reaction.
Characterisation of streptococci
Different species can be identiﬁed by the type
of haemolysis around colonies grown on blood
agar:
. a-Haemolysis: incomplete lysis of red blood cells
in agar produces a green-coloured zone around
colonies.
. b-Haemolysis: complete lysis of red blood
cells in agar leads to a clear zone around
colonies. Further grouping of b-haemolytic
streptococci is based on characterisation of
the C-carbohydrate antigen in the cell wall
using the Lanceﬁeld test.
. g-Haemolytic: no lysis of red blood cells
CLINICAL Lanceﬁeld groups
b-Haemolytic streptococci can be classiﬁed based
on antigenic differences in the C carbohydrate,
which can be detected by speciﬁc antibodies. The
Lanceﬁeld groups are classiﬁed A–U; group A in-
cludes Strep. pyogenes, whereas group D includes
enteric strains of streptococci. Groups A, B and D
streptococci are particularly associated with caus-
ing disease in humans.
Transmission and phylogeny
Strep. pyogenes istypically present on the surface of
the skin in small numbers. For disease to result
bacteria must infect the tissues or the blood.
Strep. pyogenes is a group A, b-haemolytic strain
of streptococci, and can be further classiﬁed based
on its C carbohydrate, allowing the identiﬁcation
of antigenically distinct substrains.
Pathogenesis of disease
Mechanisms of causing disease
Strep. pyogenes is capable of causing disease by
three mechanisms:
1 Pyogenic inﬂammation induced locally
2 Toxin production causing systemic symptoms
throughout body
3 Immunological cross-reaction whereby anti-
bodies against the streptococci cross-react with
normal tissue.
CLINICAL The range of streptococcal
diseases
Strep. pyogenes is the most common bacterial
cause of sore throat. Pharyngitis is associated with
inﬂammation, exudate, fever and tender cervical
lymph nodes. Spontaneous recovery usually occurs
within 10 days if untreated. However, the infection
may spread, leading to otitis media, sinusitis, mas-
toiditis or even meningitis.
If the bacterium produces the appropriate toxin,
scarlet fever or toxic shock syndrome may occur.
If Strep. pyogenes gains access to the skin through
skin defects, it can produce cellulites, necrotising
fasciitis or pyoderma (impetigo) – a superﬁcial skin
infection, which is communicable among small
children.
Pyogenic inﬂammation occurs as a result of the
body’s acute inﬂammatory response. Strep. pyo-
genes produces inﬂammation-related enzymes:
. Hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acids, a
major component of the extracellular matrix.
. Streptokinase facilitates blood clot break down
through activation of plasmin.
. DNAase.
Various toxins may be produced with local or
systemic effects:
. Streptolysins cause b-haemolysis.
. Exotoxin B is a protease that rapidly degrades
tissue. It is produced in large amounts by strains
that cause necrotising fasciitis.
. Erythrogenic toxin has a similar mode of action
to toxic shock syndrome toxin produced by
Staph. aureus and causes the rash in scarlet
fever.
. Pyogenic exotoxin A is the superantigen respon-
sible for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
After infection, poststreptococcal diseases may
occur due to the cross-reactivity of anti-strepto-
coccal antibodies with human tissues.
Immune response
The immune response mainly involves phagocyt-
ic cells of the innate immune system, although
these may be activated by T cells. Protection
434
Microbiology

from future infection is mediated by the genera-
tion of antibodies to the bacteria. These antibo-
dies may be cross-reactive with self-antigen and
can result in the development of poststreptococ-
cal conditions.
CLINICAL Poststreptococcal diseases
Local infection by group A strepococci is some-
times followed later by inﬂammation in a non-
infected organ. Antibodies produced against the
streptococcal M protein in the capsule may
cross-react with host tissue. These conditions
typically occur around 2–3 weeks after local
infection. Occurrence of these diseases can be
reduced
by
prompt
treatment
of
the
initial
infection.
Acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) occasionally
occurs, usually after skin infection. AGN is char-
acterised by hypertension, oedema of the face
and ankles, and ‘smoky’ urine (due to red blood
cells in the urine). This is the result of antibody–
antigen complexes in the glomerular basement
membrane.
Rheumatic fever may occur after streptococcal
pharyngitis. Symptoms are a fever, polyarthritis and
carditis, as a result of antibodies that cross-react
with the heart and joint tissue. Carditis may damage
both myocardial and endocardial tissue, typically
leading to mitral and aortic valve damage.
Treatment
Strep. pyogenes infection can be treated with
penicillin.
Prevention
Although it has no effect on rheumatic fever or
acute
glomerulonephritis,
penicillin
can
be
used prophylactically in those who have had
rheumatic fever to protect from reinfection by
streptococci, which may reactivate the rheu-
matic fever.
Staphylococcus aureus
Staph. aureus is responsible for causing many
forms of pyogenic infection, food poisoning and
toxic shock syndrome. Drug-resistant strains are a
signiﬁcant problem in hospitals where it is a com-
mon cause of pneumonia, septicaemia and surgi-
cal wound infections.
Morphology and structure
Staphylococci are spherical, Gram-positive cocci
that form irregular clusters. Distinction of staph-
ylococci from streptococci can be achieved by
examining for organisation of clusters and also by
catalase production. Staph. aureus can be distin-
guished from other staphylococci by its coagulase
production, as well as the typical formation of
golden colonies that are b-haemolytic.
Transmission and phylogeny
Staph. aureus is salt resistant and can be found on
the skin. It can be isolated from nasal swabs of a
small proportion of people, particularly health-
care workers, who are at a high risk of exposure
due to the prevalence of drug-resistant strains of
Staph. aureus in hospitals. Staph. aureus is a
commensal in these people and does not cause
disease.
A variety of different strains of Staph. aureus
exist, which possess different toxins and virulence
factors, or may possess different antibiotic resis-
tance cassettes. Different serotypes of Staph. au-
reus can be identiﬁed based on antigenic differ-
ences in the capsule of the bacteria.
Disease pathogenesis
There are many ways in which Staph. aureus can
cause disease; several clinically important toxins
can be produced by Staph. aureus:
. Enterotoxin acts as a superantigen in the gut,
stimulating massive cytokine release which can
trigger vomiting on ingestion. Food poisoning by
enterotoxin does not require ingestion of live
bacteria; the enterotoxin alone is sufﬁcient.
. Toxic shock syndrome toxin causes toxic shock
syndrome through the mass activation of T cells.
. Exfoliatin cleaves proteins within the epidermis
and causes scalded skin syndrome in children.
. Leukocidins are capable of killing host cells, in
particular the immune system cells responding
to the infection.
. Coagulase creates a barrier through the induc-
tion of clotting, which prevents leukocytes reach-
ing the site of infection.
The diseases caused by S. aureus can be divided
into:
. inﬂammatory diseases, e.g. skin infections
. toxin-mediated diseases, e.g. toxic shock syn-
drome, food poisoning.
Microbiology 435

Treatment
Treatment of Staph. aureus infection is difﬁcult
due to the high proportion of bacteria that have
developed drug resistance. Most strains of Staph.
aureus possess b-lactamase but, about 20% of
strains are resistant to penicillins that are not
broken down by b-lactamase. These methicillin-
resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) strains cause a
signiﬁcant problem in hospital-acquired infec-
tions. Treatment of such strains requires vanco-
mycin; worryingly, a few strains have been isolated
with vancomycin resistance.
Treatment of toxic shock syndrome also involves
treatment of the symptoms.
CLINICAL Inﬂammatory diseases
caused by Staph. aureus
The typical inﬂammatory diseases caused by Staph.
aureus are pyogenic skin infections, such as impe-
tigo, or a surgical wound infection. Spread of bac-
teria to the lungs can lead to a staphylococcal
pneumonia, which is a particularly common hospi-
tal-acquired infection. Trauma can lead to infection
of the joints or bones – arthritis or osteomyelitis may
occur. In addition, septicaemia, spreading from a
localised infection may be a complication.
Prevention
There is no effective vaccine to S. aureus or its
toxins. Good hygienic practice can limit spread of
infection in hospitals.
Clostridium tetani
Clostridium tetani is an anaerobic bacillus, which
causes tetanus. The spores of C. tetani are common
in the soil and enter the body through a wound site.
Structure and morphology
C. tetani is a Gram-positive rod-shaped bacillus. Its
spores require anaerobic tissue to germinate.
Transmission and phylogeny
C. tetani spores enter the body through a wound
site and germinate in the anaerobic conditions of
the wound. Neonatal tetanus is a problem in de-
veloping countries because the organism enters
through a contaminated umbilicus or circumci-
sion wound.
Tetanus toxin, which is responsible for the
symptoms of tetanus infection, is found in a single
antigenic type.
Replication and pathogenesis
of disease
C. tetani is restricted to the wound site due to its
obligate anaerobic nature. Tetanus toxin is pro-
duced by C. tetani in the wound site, following
germination. This toxin is a zinc-dependent pro-
tease that inhibits vesicle release from inhibitory
nerves in the spine. The toxin is carried by retro-
grade axonal transport to the CNS, so it is highly
toxic in even minute amounts.
Treatment
Tetanus immunoglobulin, which neutralises the
toxin, is given after an injury that is likely to have
resulted in C. tetani spores entering the body.
Penicillin may be useful to kill bacteria. Treatment
also focuses on alleviating the symptoms; the
airway
must
be
maintained
and
respiratory
support given. Muscle spasms can be reduced by
benzodiazepines.
Prevention
Immunisation is by administration of tetanus tox-
oid (formaldehyde-treated toxin). This is given
CLINICAL Toxin-mediated diseases
Food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome and scalded
skin syndrome are all toxin-mediated staphylococ-
cal diseases. Food poisoning is caused by inges-
tion of enterotoxin, which is preformed in contam-
inated food.
. Staphylococcal food poisoning occurs after a
rapid incubation period (1–8 hours) and is char-
acterised by more prominent vomiting than
diarrhoea.
. Toxic shock syndrome follows the course char-
acteristic of septic shock, and can involve many
organs, including the liver, kidneys, muscles and
CNS.
. Scalded skin syndrome predominantly occurs in
young children and is characterised by a rash and
fever, and the sloughing off of large areas of skin.
Hair and nails may be lost and there is a risk of ion
imbalance and ﬂuid loss. Recovery is usually
within 10 days.
436
Microbiology

during childhood, and every 10 years thereafter.
After trauma, tetanus toxoid should be adminis-
tered and the wound debrided. Tetanus immuno-
globulin should also be given, but at a different
site to prevent neutralisation of the vaccine.
Enteric bacteria
Three clinically important strains of enteric bac-
teria are E. coli, and Salmonella and Shigella spp.
Enterobacteria commonly cause diarrhoea which,
in turn, promote transmission of the pathogen by
the faeco-oral route.
Morphology and identiﬁcation
All three clinically important enteric bacteria men-
tioned above are Gram-negative rods and can be
grown and isolated on MacConkey’s agar. E. coli
can be distinguished from Shigella and Salmonella
spp. by its ability to ferment lactose and its pro-
duction of indole from tryptophan, which also
allows it to be distinguished from other lactose-
fermenting bacteria.
Salmonella and Shigella spp. can be distinguished
from each other by H2S production –Shigella sp.
does not produce H2S, whereas Salmonella sp. does.
E. coli, and Salmonella and Shigella spp. all exist
as many different serotypes. Thus infection can
occur repeatedly as the antibody response to one
serotype does not protect against other serotypes.
Enteric bacterial infection of the gut is usually
through the ingestion of contaminated food. Pre-
vention of infection by enteric bacteria requires
good hygiene practices to break the route of trans-
mission. There are four main methods of trans-
mission of enteric bacteria to cause infection: food,
flies, fingers and faeces
Escherichia coli
Most strains of E. coli are harmless commensals in
the gut. Some strains, however, can cause a variety
of infections inside and outside the GI tract,
including urinary tract infections, travellers’ diar-
rhoea and neonatal meningitis.
Transmission and phylogeny
E. coli is transmitted in undercooked food and can
also be present in contaminated water, although
this is rare due to chlorination.
Different strains of E. coli can be distinguished
by the presence of a number of different antigens
associated with the cell wall (O antigen), ﬂagella (H
antigen) and capsule (K antigen). More than 1000
distinct serotypes have been identiﬁed based on
their O, K and H antigens. Speciﬁc serotypes are
associated with distinct diseases.
Disease pathogenesis
Intestinal tract infection occurs after adherence
of pathogenic strains to cells in the small intestine.
Bacteria synthesise enterotoxin which causes wa-
tery, non-bloody diarrhoea associated with inﬂam-
mation. Such an infection usually resolves within 3
days.
E. coli strains that invade the epithelium of the
large intestine cause bloody diarrhoea and inﬂam-
mation. Infection with the O157:H7 strain can be
complicated by haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
CLINICAL O157:H7 and haemolytic
uraemic syndrome
The O157:H7 serotype of E. coli produces verotoxin,
similar to the toxins produced by Shigella spp. This
results in bloody diarrhoea, fever and abdominal
pains with little inﬂammation.
Haemolytic uraemicsyndromeis a life-threatening
complication. It is an acute renal failure associated
with haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia.
Systemic infection by E. coli can lead to septic
shock mediated by LPS found in the bacterial cell
wall.
Urinary tract infection is caused by serotypes in
which the bacterial pili contain adhesins for spe-
ciﬁc proteins on urinary epithelium, allowing the
organism to ascend the urinary tract to the bladder
and kidneys.
E. coli is the most common cause of hospital-
acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs):
. Neonatal meningitis is often caused by E. coli
exposure during child birth.
. Pathogenic features: E. coli has several features
that contribute to its pathogenic nature.
. Pili allow attachment to epithelial cells for col-
onisation of the GI and urinary tracts.
. Capsules can prevent phagocytosis.
. Enterotoxins may be produced in intestinal tract
infection. There are two distinct toxins:
– a high-molecular-weight toxin, similar to chol-
era toxin, that stimulates adenylyl cyclase,
triggering loss of K þ, Cl  and ﬂuid
– the low-molecular-weight toxin acts through
stimulation of guanylyl cyclase.
. Endotoxin – Lipopolysaccarhide.
Microbiology 437

Treatment
The treatment of E. coli infection varies with the
site of infection:
. Lower UTIs are often treated with penicillin or
trimethoprim
. Neonatal meningitis is treated with ampicillin
and cefotaxime
. Treatment is not normally required in diarrhoea,
though rehydration may be needed
Prevention
E. coli infection can be prevented by reducing the
risk of exposure to bacteria:
. Ensure that food is properly prepared and thor-
oughly cooked.
. Travellers’ diarrhoea can be prevented by pro-
phylactic antibiotics.
Salmonella spp.
Salmonella spp. are associated with enterocolitis
and enteric fevers such as typhoid fever. It can also
cause infections in other parts of the body, such as
osteomyelitis and septicaemia.
Phylogeny and transmission
Three antigens are important in identiﬁcation of
strains: the O (cell wall) antigen, H (ﬂagellar) an-
tigen and Vi (capsular) antigen.
A distinction is made between those species that
cause typhoid fever and those that do not: S. typhi
and
S.
paratyphi
can
cause
typhoid
fever;
S. enteriditis is not typhoidal.
Salmonella spp. can be transmitted by inges-
tion of contaminated food. Most species of
Salmonella have animal reservoirs, although
S. typhi infects only humans and may be trans-
mitted by the faeco-oral route. Salmonella in-
fection is frequently contracted from uncooked
poultry or eggs.
Disease pathogenesis
Three different types of infection may be caused by
Salmonella spp.:
1 Enterocolitis
results
from
invasion
of
gut
tissue. Infection is limited to the gut and lymph
nodes.
2 Typhoid and other enteric fevers are caused by
initial infection in the small intestine. Bacteria
enter phagocytes in the gut and spread to the
lymph tissue, spleen, liver and gallbladder. In
particular, invasion of the gallbladder is associ-
ated with the individual becoming a chronic
carrier
3 Septicaemia can lead to seeding of bacteria in
other organs, which can result in meningitis,
osteomyelitis and pneumonia.
CLINICAL Symptoms of salmonella
infection
Enterocolitis occurs after a short incubation period
(12–48 hours). It is characterised by symptoms of
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain,
and is normally self-limiting.
Typhoid fever is caused by S. typhi, and enteric
fever by S. paratyphi. Initially, infection causes fever
and constipation. Septicaemia leads to a high fever,
delirium and painful abdomen. A rash on the abdo-
men may occur. There is a small risk of patients
becoming chronic carriers.
Treatment
Many infections will resolve without antibiotics.
However drug-resistant strains of Salmonella
spp. are common, making testing of resistance
essential if they are to be used. Fluid and
ion
replacement
may
be
required
to
treat
dehydration.
Prevention
Salmonella infection can be prevented by good
hygiene. Vaccines against S. typhi are available but
confer limited protection (about 65–75%).
Shigella
Shigella sp. is a highly infectious bacterium that
causes dysentery. It is estimated that fewer than
100 organisms are sufﬁcient to cause disease.
Structure and morphology
Shigella sp. is a non-lactose-fermenting, Gram-
negative rod. It can be distinguished from Salmo-
nella spp. because it does not produce H2S.
Phylogeny, transmission and disease
pathogenesis
The cell wall antigen is used to group the bacteria
into four groups – A–D.
438
Microbiology

Shigella sp. infects only humans, commonly
through food, invading the GI tract and causing
bloody diarrhoea. Some strains also produce a
toxin – shiga toxin.
CLINICAL Shigellosis
Incubation of infection takes approximately 1–4
days, and is followed by abdominal cramps and
bloody diarrhoea. Disease may vary in severity –
young children and elderly people may be partic-
ularly badly affected. Infection usually resolves
within a few days, although in severe cases anti-
biotics may be needed to help recovery.
Treatment
In severe cases, antibiotics may be used, e.g. ﬂuor-
oquinone, although drug resistance is a common
problem.
Usually
only
rehydration
and
ion
replacement are needed.
Prevention
Shigella infection is prevented by breaking the
faeco-oral route of transmission. No vaccine is
currently available.
Neisseria spp
Neisseria spp. are Gram-negative cocci of which
two species are clinically important – N. gonor-
rhoeae and N. meningitidis. The bacteria are
closely related, but nevertheless show marked
differences. N. gonorrhoeae is a professional path-
ogen and causes disease to help its transmission
and survival. In contrast, N. meningitidis gains
little advantage through causing meningitis be-
cause it precipitates death.
Morphology and identiﬁcation
Neisseria spp. are oxidase-expressing bacteria that
grow on chocolate agar. Microscopically, they are
found in pairs (diplococci), resembling paired kid-
ney beans. N. meningitidis can be distinguished
from N. gonorrhoeae by its ability to ferment
maltose.
Neisseria meningitidis
N. meningitidis causes meningitis, and is the lead-
ing cause of death from infection in children in the
USA. Identiﬁcation is carried out on blood and CSF
samples. The presence of Gram-negative cocci in
spinal ﬂuid is sufﬁcient for a presumptive diagno-
sis of meningococcal meningitis.
Transmission and phylogeny
Humans are the only known hosts for meningo-
cocci. About 10% of the population are asymptom-
atic carriers, with the nasopharynx being the most
common site of colonisation. Infection occurs in
less than 0.01% of population, resulting from bac-
teria spreading to other regions of the body. Trans-
mission between individuals is by respiratory
aerosol.
Pathogenesis
N. meningitidis has three main virulence factors:
1 Capsule – inhibits phagocytosis
2 Endotoxin – LPS
3 IgA protease.
Neisseria spp. also possess pili that project
through the capsule. These pili help attachment
and can be extended to help motility. To help
adhesion, N. meningitidis also possess Opa (opac-
ity-associated) proteins, which are a family of
proteins that determine tropism of bacteria.
Resistance to disease is due to protective anti-
bodies to the capsule, mediating group-speciﬁc
immunity. Complement also plays a role in de-
fence against N. meningitidis; individuals with
deﬁciencies of late complement components are
susceptible to neisseria infection
CLINICAL Meningitis and
meningococcaemia
As a result of bacteraemia, N. meningitidis can
spread to distant organs and may seed in the
meninges. The resulting meningitis results in the
characteristic symptoms – fever, stiff neck, sensi-
tivity to bright light.
The most severe manifestation of N. meningitidis
infection is meningococcaemia. The resultant sep-
tic shock leads to high fever, widespread rash and
disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Treatment
N. meningitidis infection can be managed by pen-
icillin, although more severe forms of infection
also require management of symptoms.
Microbiology 439

Individuals who have come into close contact
with meningitis sufferers are given prophylactic
antibiotic treatment – typically rifampicin.
Prevention
Vaccines have been developed against the poly-
saccharide capsule of some serogroups. However,
this is not possible for serogroup B, in which the
capsule antigen is identical to the host molecule,
NCAM-1.
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
N. gonorrhoeae is the causative agent of gonor-
rhoea, a sexually transmitted infection. It can also
cause pelvic inﬂammatory disease and neonatal
conjunctivitis.
Transmission
N. gonorrhoeae infects only humans and is usually
transmitted sexually, although it can be transmit-
ted from mother to newborn during birth. The
genital tract is the most common source of the
bacteria, although they can also be found in the
pharynx and rectum.
Pathogenesis
N. gonorrhoeae is a professional pathogen, almost
alwayscausingdiseaseinthehost.Althoughusually
symptomaticinmales,gonococcalinfectionisoften
asymptomatic in females, helping transmission.
Diagnosis in men can be made by detection of
Gram-negative diplococci within neutrophils in
urethral discharge. In women, cultures are nor-
mally required for diagnosis.
N. gonorrhoeae has several important virulence
factors:
. Pili mediate attachment of bacteria to cell sur-
faces. The pili are retractable, limiting presenta-
tion of an antigen to the period when the pilus is
performing an essential function.
. Cell walls contain lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS), a
mild endotoxin causing less severe endotoxic
shock than LPS.
. IgA protease.
Immune response
The main host defence against N. gonorrhoeae is
production of antibodies (IgG and IgA), but com-
plement and neutrophils also have a role. Repeated
gonococcal infection may occur due to antigenic
variation – phase switching.
DEFINITION Phase switching
Phase variationis a processwherebysome genesin
the genome are reversibly switched on or off. In
Neisseria spp. this leads to antigenic variation, be-
cause the genes that are turned on and off are
enzymes associated with the productionof antigenic
polysaccharides.
The genes contain tracts of repeated nucleotides
within their coding region. During replication, the
tracts may be lengthened or shortened as a result of
inaccurate copying by the bacterial polymerases;
the resulting frame shift produces a non-functional
product.
Treatment
Ceftriaxone and penicillins can be used to treat
N. gonorrhoeae infection, although penicillin-
resistant isolates have been identiﬁed.
Prevention
No vaccine currently exists. Prevention focuses on
condom use and prompt treatment of infected
individuals and their contacts.
CLINICAL Symptoms of gonococcal
diseases
Gonorrhoea is the most common disease caused by
N.gonorrhoeae.Inmen,itischaracterisedbypurulent
discharge and pain on urination. In women, infection
occurs in the endometrium, causing discharge and
intermenstrual bleeding. A common complication is
spread of infection up the fallopian tubes, which can
result in sterility or ectopic pregnancy as a result of
scarringinthefallopiantubes.Disseminatedinfection
can lead to arthritis and tenosynovitis.
Newbornbabiesmay acquire N.gonorrhoeae from
an infected mother during childbirth, resulting in
neonatal conjunctivitis. This condition can be pre-
vented by prophylactic erythromycin eye ointment.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
M. tuberculosis causes more deaths than any other
bacterial infection – it is estimated that approxi-
mately a third of the world population may be
infected. Tuberculosis as a world health issue
has been compounded by the spread of AIDS,
because severe TB can occur in immunosup-
pressed patients.
440
Microbiology

Structure and morphology
M. tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacillus. It must also
be grown on special medium (e.g. L€owenstein-
Jensen) to help its growth while inhibiting the
culture of faster-growing bacteria.
M. tuberculosis can be distinguished form other
mycobacteria by the production of niacin. It is an
obligate aerobe, normally infecting highly oxygen-
ated tissue, e.g. lungs.
The cell wall is rich in lipids due to the mycolic
acids(long-chainfattyacids),whichcontributetoits
acid-fast nature, and phosphatides, which play a
role in caseous necrosis. In addition, M. tuberculosis
is relatively resistant to NaOH, which is used to
isolate bacteria from clinical specimens. It is also
resistanttodehydration,whichmayhelprespiratory
transmissionbecauseitcansurviveindriedsputum.
Transmission and pathogenesis
Transmission is by respiratory aerosol. The initial
site of infection is within the lungs where M. tu-
berculosis is taken up and can survive within alve-
olar macrophages. Disseminated disease occurs in
only a small proportion of infected individuals.
M. tuberculosis survives and multiplies within
the phagosome. It is capable of inhibiting lyso-
somal fusion with the phagosome. Survival of
M. tuberculosis within the macrophage leads to
formation of granulomas with the bacteria.
A typical granuloma is made up of a central area
of multinucleate giant cells containing bacilli, sur-
rounded by epithelioid cells, lymphocytes and
ﬁbroblasts. The last result in a repair process that
is ongoing. Many granulomas in TB contain a
central region of necrotic caseous (‘cheesy’) tissue.
M. tuberculosis can reside within granulomas for
many years, isolated from the rest of the host. The
walled-off granuloma is known as a tubercle and
may calcify over time, although it is still likely to
contain live M. tuberculosis.
DEFINITION Giant and epithelioid
lesions
Giant and epithelioid cells within a granuloma ap-
pear to be specialised forms of macrophages. Giant
cells are multinucleated cells, thought to result from
the fusion of infected macrophages. Epithelioid
cells appear to be specialised for secretion, show-
ing aspects of morphology similar to epithelial cells.
Immune response
M. tuberculosis does not directly damage the host.
The damage is the result of the cell-mediated
immune response to the bacteria. Antibodies are
formed, but play no signiﬁcant protective role.
Patients with weakened cell-mediated immune
response are unable to contain the bacteria, lead-
ing to disseminated infection (e.g. in AIDS). The
strength of the host immune response appears to
be an important determinant of disease state.
CLINICAL Disseminated TB infection
A tubercle may rupture into a bronchus and bacteria
may spread to other areas of the lungs or enter the
blood, from where bacilli may infect distant sites.
Many organsmaybecomeinvolvedin disseminated
infection, leading to generalised symptoms of fever,
tiredness and weight loss. Pulmonary TB is associ-
ated with a severe cough and haemoptysis(blood in
sputum). Common disseminated forms include mil-
itary TB (characterised by small millet-seed-like
lesions throughout the body and lungs), tubercu-
lous meningitis and tuberculous osteomyelitis, in
particular, Pott’s disease (vertebral osteomyelitis).
Treatment
Treatment of TB is difﬁcult because many drug-
resistant strains have developed. Consequently,
drug resistance tests are essential for management
of the disease. Isoniazid is the main therapeutic
agent used in combination with other drugs such
as rifampicin and ethambutol. A long period of
treatment (9–12 months) with multiple drugs is
required due to:
. intracellular location of the organism
. caseous material blocking penetration by drug
. slow growth of the organism
. metabolic inactivity – a portion of bacteria do
not take up drugs, and thus are not killed.
Problems are exacerbated due to lack of patient
compliance over a long period.
Immunisation
Prior infection can be detected by a positive tu-
berculin skin test. However, previous immunisa-
tion will also yield a positive response.
BCG (Bacillus Camille–Guerin) vaccine is used
to protect against TB. The BCG bacterium is an
attenuated strain of M. bovis, a related bacterium,
Microbiology 441

and results in only partial protection. BCG cannot
be given to immunocompromised patients be-
cause it is a live vaccine.
Fungi
Fungi are eukaryotic organisms and cause some
important clinical diseases. With the exception of
Candida albicans (a skin commensal), fungi nat-
urally reside in the environment.
Structure and morphology
Fungal cell walls differ from those of other organ-
isms because they consist primarily of chitin. Fun-
gal cell walls contain ergosterol instead of choles-
terol. As human cells do not synthesise or use
ergosterol, this difference is exploited by the se-
lective action of azole antifungal drugs. Fungi can
be found in two states:
1 Yeasts grow as single cells.
2 Moulds grow as hyphae (long ﬁlaments).
Many fungi can grow in both states – they are
dimorphic. Most medically important fungi repli-
cate asexually.
Common fungal conditions
Two common fungal infections are candidiasis
caused by Candida albicans and tinea pedis caused
by Trichophyton spp.
C. albicans is the causative agent of thrush. It is
commonly found as a skin commensal, although it
can cause infection at other sites. In immunocom-
promised individuals, Candida spp. may cause
disseminated infection. Treatment is by azole
drugs which inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol,
found in fungal cell walls.
Athlete’s foot is caused by tinea pedis. Other
fungal infections are rare, opportunistic fungal
infections associated with a compromised im-
mune system (particularly pneumocystis pneumo-
nia in AIDS).
Parasites
Parasites occur in two distinct forms – single-celled
protozoa and multicellular helminths. These or-
ganisms are a serious cause of illness in the devel-
oping world. Parasites tend to have a complex
lifecycle with stages in humans and other animals.
All parasites are eukaryotic.
Protozoal parasites
Protozoal parasites are typically vector borne and
affect many millions of people each year. The lifecycle
of these parasites is complex, with different stages for
the host and the vector, and they may employ both
sexual and asexual reproduction in their lifecycle.
Malaria
Around 300 million people each year are affected
by malaria, with more than 1 million people a year
dying from the disease. Malaria is mainly conﬁned
to Africa, southern Asia and Latin America. Treat-
ment has become more challenging due to the
emergence of drug-resistant strains.
Malaria is caused by the parasites of the genus
Plasmodium, of which four species may cause
malaria in humans:
. Plasmodium falciparum – the most virulent
. Plasmodium vivax
. Plasmodium ovale
. Plasmodium malariae.
CLINICAL Symptoms of malaria
Clinical symptoms are often non-speciﬁc: fever,
headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhoea. More speciﬁc
symptoms include splenomegaly, anaemia, hypo-
glycaemia, and pulmonary or renal dysfunction.
Clinical manifestationsofmalariaare associatedwith
the synchronous rupture of infected red blood cells.
Falciparum malaria can rapidly progress to a
more severe form which may be fatal. This results
from attachment of infected cells to small blood
vessels, which may cause CNS involvement (cere-
bral malaria), as well as acute renal failure and
respiratory distress.
Splenomegaly and occasionally splenic rupture
are known complications of P. vivax infection. Infec-
tion with P. malariae may be complicated by
nephrotic syndrome.
Transmission and lifecycle
Malaria is transmitted by the bite of an infected
female Anopheles mosquito (Fig. 16.8). Plasmodi-
um develops in the gut of the mosquito and spor-
ozoites are passed on in the saliva of the insect.
When an infected mosquito bites, the parasites
442
Microbiology

enter the victim’s bloodstream and migrate to the
liver where they multiply.
Over the next 2 weeks, Plasmodium undergoes
rapid asexual reproduction to produce thousand of
merozoitesineachlivercell,whicharereleasedwhen
the hepatocyte ruptures. These merozoites infect red
bloodcellsandundergofurtherasexualreproduction
to produce a schizont, containing around 15 mero-
zoites.Somemerozoitesmaydifferentiateintosexual
forms – gametocytes. The male and female gameto-
cytes are taken up by a female anopheline mosquito
on biting an infected human. Sexual reproduction
occurs in the midgut of the mosquito.
P. vivax and P. ovale can produce a recurrent
infection because they may also exist in the liver in
a dormant stage. They may form hypnozoites that
can persist for several years and lead to relapses.
Immune response and evasion
Plasmodium parasites are specialised for entry into
hepatocytes and red blood cells, where they live
within a vacuole. The parasite is able to remodel
the red blood cell surface – P. falciparum causes the
expression of PfEMP-1 (P. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1) on the red blood cell surface,
which mediates attachment to the surface of small
blood vessels, preventing clearance of the infected
red blood cell in the spleen. There are many anti-
genically distinct variants of PfEMP-1, impairing
formation of an effective antibody response.

Microbiology 443

P. falciparum is capable of antigenic variation at
various stages of its lifecycle, impeding the pro-
duction of an effective immune response against
any form of the parasite. Nevertheless partial im-
munity can be built up due to the development of
antibodies that provide some protection and act
against the merozoites.
The hepatocyte stage of the parasite lifecycle can
result in the development of CTLs that are speciﬁc
for Plasmodium-derived epitopes. Given the lack
of MHC-I molecules on red blood cells, the CTLs
play little part in the removal of merozoites.
Treatment
Many drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium have
emerged; there is a desperate need for the devel-
opment of new drug regimens and therapies. Three
major drugs are currently used whereas antibiotics
such as tetracycline can be used to treat acute
episodes:
1 Chloroquineactstokillthemerozoitestageofall
four species of Plasmodium. They prevent the
digestion of haemoglobin, which is toxic to the
parasite) and its conversion to haemozoin,
which is non-toxic. Resistance to chloroquine is
common, particularly in P. falciparum.
2 Pyrimethamine inhibits the formation of tetra-
hydrofolate in the parasite, which is crucial for
DNA synthesis. Pyrimethamine has a higher af-
ﬁnity for the parasitic enzyme than its human
equivalent. Some strains have developed resis-
tance to pyrimethamine, although these are less
common than chloroquine-resistant strains.
3 Artemesinin kills schizonts during acute malar-
ia. The mechanism is not clear, although it is
thought it may act through promoting the gen-
eration of free radicals which damage the para-
site,aswellaspotentiallyinhibitingtheprotozoal
Ca2 þ ATPase.
Prevention
Chloroquine is typically used as prophylactic and
must be taken for about 2 weeks before arrival in a
malaria-endemic area and for about 6 weeks after
departure. However, drug-resistant strains have
emerged. Other drugs may also be used prophy-
lactically, often doxycycline or larium, each with
varying efﬁcacy and side effects.
Mosquito nets are frequently used to reduce
access of the vector to host and management of
malaria has also been attempted through removal
of the vector. The drainage of stagnant water near
communitiesreducesthemosquito populationand
insecticides have been tried, although mosquitoes
have developed resistance to some of these.
Currently, no vaccine is available although many
are in development, targeting different stages of
the lifecycle.
Helminths
Multicellular parasites – helminths – are a serious
cause of mortality and morbidity in the developing
world. Many millions of people are affected, par-
ticularly by schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis
(river blindness).
Classiﬁcation
Helminths can be divided into two main groups:
1 Nematodes (roundworms) possess a cylindrical
body and are covered in a protective cuticle.
Nematodes have separate sexes – the female is
usually larger than the male.
2 Platyminths (ﬂatworms) can be further divided
into trematodes and cestodes:
– trematodes (ﬂukes) have a leaf-shaped body,
although this takes onvery different morphol-
ogies at different points in the lifecycle; they
often havea complex lifecycle, with stages in a
human host and a snail intermediate, and
they are usually hermaphrodites
– cestodes (tapeworms) vary in length from
2–3 mm (typically three to four proglottids)
to 7–10 m long (several thousand proglottids).
They have a segmented body made up of a
scolex (head) and a chain of proglottids and
are hermaphrodites.
The severity of helminthic infection is often
directly related to the number of parasites infecting
the host. Infection with a single parasite will be
asymptomatic, whereas infection with several thou-
sand parasites is likely to cause severe pathology.
Low numbers of parasites may cause a severe illness
if infection occurs in a critical location (e.g. the
brain).

Neuroscience
Neuroscience is the study of neuroanatomy, the
spatial arrangement of structures in the nervous
system, and of neurophysiology, the functioning of
the nervous system.
The nervous system is divided into the central
nervous system (CNS) – the brain and spinal cord –
and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which
comprises all nervous matter outside of these
structures.
DEFINITION Grey and white matter in
the CNS
The tissue in the CNS is broadly divided into grey
and white matter, which have different roles and
features:
. Grey matter: darker coloured tissues of the CNS,
rich in neuron cell bodies, branching dendrites
and supporting cells, glia.
. White matter: paler coloured tissues of the CNS,
rich in the insulating material, myelin, which sur-
rounds nerve ﬁbres.
The nervous system comprises not only neurons
but also other cells that support neuronal function.
The bony structures of the skull and vertebral
column,
the
tissue
meninges
investing
the
CNS, the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and blood
vessels have a supportive role, and are covered in
this chapter.
The functioning of the nervous system can be
broadly categorised into:
. motor systems, which control both voluntary
and
involuntary
muscle
contraction
and
relaxation
. sensory systems which detect touch, pain and
limb position (proprioception)
. special senses including sight, hearing, smell,
taste and balance
. higher cortical functions, including memory,
sleep and consciousness.
The skull
The skull is the bony structure of the head that
encases the brain and also contributes to the face.
The skull can be broken up into two regions with
distinct roles (Fig. 17.1):
1 The neurocranium is the region of the skull that
encases and protects the brain.
2 The facial skeleton (viscerocranium) makes up
the remainder of the skull and is covered in
Chapter 14.
The bones of the neurocranium are mainly ﬂat or
irregular in shape and are joined by ﬁbrous joints,
forming a thick, tight structure. In children, the
bones
are
linked
by
hyaline
cartilage.

increases the ﬂexibility of the skull, facilitating
birth. Eight bones make up the neurocranium:
. Frontal bone
. Occipital bone
. Sphenoid bone
. Ethmoid bone
. Two parietal bones
. Two temporal bones.
The cranial cavity
The brain is housed in the cranial cavity. Three
depressions (fossae), on which the brain sits, can
be identiﬁed:
1 Theanteriorcranialfossaisthe shallowest ofthe
fossae and contains the frontal lobes of the brain.
The fossa is made up of the frontal bone, and is
located immediately posterior to the frontal si-
nuses.Inthemiddleofthisfossaisthecribriform

allow entry of the olfactory nerve ﬁbres.
2 The middle cranial fossa consists of two deep
depressions on each side of a small prominence,
thesellaturcica–aformationinthemiddleofthe
sphenoid bone that contains a slight depression
in the middle, in which the pituitary gland sits.
The middle cranial fossa is formed by the sphe-
noid and temporal bones.
3 The posterior cranial fossa is the deepest of the
fossae, accommodating the cerebellum, pons
and medulla; it contains the foramen magnum
in its base. It is made up mainly by occipital
bone.
Foramina of the skull
There must be points of entry and exit in the neu-
rocranium to allow communication between the
brain and the body. Four types of tracts or conduits
link the brain and the rest of the body (see Fig. 17.1):
1 The arterial supply of the brain and structures
internal to the skull is derived almost exclusively
from the internal carotid and vertebral arteries.
The only exception is the middle meningeal
artery, which is a branch of the external carotid
artery.
2 The venous drainage of the brain is through the
internal jugular veins.
3 The cranial nerves must exit the skull to inner-
vate structures in the face and in body.
4 The spinal cord is a continuation of the CNS.
Foramina in the anterior cranial fossa
There are two major foramina in the anterior cra-
nial fossa that serve the nose and eyes:
1 The cribriform plate is located in the midline in
the ethmoid bone. It contains many small per-
forations that allow the olfactory nerve to enter
the nose.
2 The optic canal carries the optic nerve and the
ophthalmic artery to the eye.
Foramina in the middle cranial fossa
The middle cranial fossa contains many foramina
for the cranial nerves innervating the muscles and
skin of the face, as well as carrying much of the
vasculature:
. The superior orbital ﬁssure is located at the
anterior aspect of the middle cranial fossa and
carries branches of the trigeminal nerve and
ophthalmic veins. In addition it carries the cra-
nial nerves (CN) responsible for eye movements
(CN III, IV and VI)
. The foramen rotundum carries the maxillary
branch of the trigeminal nerve.
. The foramen ovale carries the mandibular
branch of the trigeminal nerve.
. The foramen spinosum carries the middle men-
ingeal artery.
. The
foramen
lacerum
carries
the
internal
carotid artery.
The foramina of the posterior
cranial fossa
The foramina in the posterior cranial fossa carry
many of the connections between the brain and
the rest of the body:
. The foramen magnum carries the lower part of
the medulla, which connects inferiorly with the
Figure 17.1 The skull is made up of a series of irregularbones.In the bones of the skull there is a seriesof foramina to
allow the communication of the brain with the rest of the body. The most prominent is the foramen magnum which
takes the spinal cord as well as some other nerves and vessels. The other major foramina are the carotid canal and
the foramina rotundum, ovale and spinosum.The foramen lacerumis seen in skulls, although it is not a true foramen–

spinal cord. It also carries the vertebral arteries
and the spinal accessory nerve.
. The internal auditory meatus in the petrous
temporal bone carries the facial and vestibulo-
cochlear nerves.
. The jugular foramen carries the internal jugular
vein and CN IX, X and XI.
. The hypoglossal canal allows exit of the hypo-
glossal nerve from the skull.
The meninges
The brain is supported by three tissue layers known
as the meninges:
1 The pia mater is the innermost layer. It consists
of a very rich network of ﬁbres containing many
vessels and a rich lymphoid system.
2 The arachnoid mater is made up of many irreg-
ular connecting ﬁbres and contains a layer
of CSF so that the entire brain tissue is bathed
in the ﬂuid.
3 The dura mater is the outermost layer. It is a
tough
ﬁbrous
covering
of
tissue
encasing
the CNS.
The meninges are richly innervated and vascu-
larised. Due to their large blood supply, the me-
ninges may rupture and bleed, which is a clinical
emergency. A haemorrhage can be classiﬁed based
on its location in relation to the meninges:
. Subarachnoid haemorrhage
. Subdural haemorrhage
. Extradural haemorrhage.
The signs and symptoms of the different forms of
bleeds differ, although in each case the condition is
serious, because the pressure caused by the pool-
ing of blood is likely to press on the brain tissue and
cause damage.
CLINICAL Subarachnoid haemorrhage
A subarachnoid haemorrhage results in blood en-
tering the subarachnoid space. This usually results
from the rupture of an aneurysm, often in the circle of
Willis. The bleeding causes meningeal irritation and
a severe headache with loss of consciousness.
Neurological symptoms are often not seen. Sub-
arachnoid haemorrhages are particularly severe
and those resulting from the rupture of an aneurysm
have about a 50% mortality rate pre-admission.
CLINICAL Subdural haemorrhage
Subdural haemorrhages result from leakage of ve-
nous blood into the potential space between the
dura and arachnoid, as a result of trauma. Similar to
an extradural haemorrhage, the symptoms result
from accumulation of pressure on the brain. The
onset of symptoms is usually prolonged due to the
low pressure of venous blood and may take up to
2 weeks to develop. The symptoms include altered
consciousness,
headaches,
disorientation
and
amnesia,
slurred
speech,
ataxia
and
altered
breathing patterns.
CLINICAL Extradural haemorrhage
In an extradural haemorrhage, blood collects be-
tween the skull and the external part of the dura. This
usually occurs due to a blow to the head and is
typically characterised by a sequence of brief con-
cussion, followed by a period in which the patient
appears lucid, followed later by drowsiness and
coma. The symptoms are caused by the build-up
of pressure on the brain due to the accumulating
volume of blood after tearing of the arteries.
Cell types in the brain
The brain is made up mainly of two cell groups:
neurons and glia (supporting cells).
Neurons
The structure of a neuron
Neurons are highly specialised cells involved in the
initiation and conduction of action potentials al-
lowing the processing and transmission of infor-
mation. There are a number of subtypes, although
they share a variety of features reﬂecting their
common purpose in receiving and integrating
signals from other cells and conducting action
potentials:
. The dendrites are small projections arising from
the cell body. They typically form the site of
synapses with other neurons.
448
Neuroscience

. The axon is the section of the nerve cell specia-
lised for the conduction of an action potential.
It is often myelinated, contains many voltage-
gated channels and can be long.
Classiﬁcation of neurons
Neurons can be classed by:
. shape (Table 17.1)
. neurotransmitter, which may be inhibitory or
excitatory
. function: according to either the neuronal sys-
tem in which that neuron plays a part or whether
the neuron is excitatory or inhibitory; it can be
both at different synapses.
Neurons are classed as inhibitory or excitatory
according to their effect on the membrane poten-
tial of the postsynaptic cell:
. Excitatory neurons induce depolarisation of the
postsynaptic membranes, potentially leading to
the generation of an action potential
. Inhibitory neurons typically hyperpolarise the
postsynaptic membranes, inhibiting the gener-
ation of an action potential (reducing the excit-
ability of the postsynaptic cell).
In the brain themain excitatory neurotransmitter
is glutamate, although in the spinal cord acetylcho-
line is the major excitatory neurotransmitter.
Conversely, in the brain g-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) is the predominant inhibitory neurotrans-
mitter, whereas in the spinal cord glycine is the
major inhibitory neurotransmitter.
The input and output cells of different regions of
the brain can be considered predominantly as
either inhibitory or excitatory; however, the actual
behaviour of cells is extremely complex and not
fully understood, e.g. the input and output from
the cortex are mainly excitatory, whereas the out-
put
from
the
cerebellum
is
predominantly
inhibitory
Functional classiﬁcation of nerve ﬁbres
In the sensory and motor nervous systems, differ-
ent receptors are innervated by speciﬁc ﬁbre types,
with different conducting velocities (Tables 17.2
and 17.3).
Neural repair and regeneration
The ability of nerves to regenerate differs in
the PNS and CNS. As many cells have long
axons, cutting an axon results in death of the
portion of the cell not connected to the cell body,
although the rest of the nerve may be able to
regenerate.
In both the PNS and CNS, the stump of the
damaged axon will rapidly develop new sprouts.
A series of processes following injury must occur
for the nerve cell to regrow along its original path-
way (Fig. 17.2):
. Degeneration of the damaged axon
. Regrowth and elongation of the axonal sprout
. Remyelination of the nerve ﬁbre.
Degeneration
When a nerve is cut, a characteristic process oc-
curs, known as wallerian degeneration. After cut-
ting, the axon region distal to the cut rapidly dies
and the axon and synaptic endings rapidly disin-
tegrate. If the axon were myelinated, the myelin
sheath should also disintegrate, although the cells

themselves would remain viable. The dying axon
and myelin are removed by macrophages in
phagocytosis. If the axon were the sole source of
input to the cell downstream, the postsynaptic cell
could also degenerate – this is seen in muscle cells
in which atrophy occurs after neuronal damage.
Regrowth and axonal sprouting
After degeneration, the viable axon sprouts and
attempts to regrow, guided by the various growth
factors that may be present. In the PNS regrowth is
guided by the Schwann cells, allowing the axons to
reach their target tissue. Nerve cells may be more
than 1 metre long and growth rate is limited by
axonal transport. This regrowth rarely exceeds
1 mm/day.
Regrowth of axons in the CNS does not occur for
three main reasons:
. The oligodendrocytes myelinate many cells, and
do not provide the guide path for regrowth pro-
vided by Schwann cells in the PNS.
. Astrocytes in the CNS rapidly form scar tissue
and obstruct the path of axonal growth.
. The growth factors found centrally may differ
from those in the periphery, and may alter the
potential for regrowth.
Remyelination
After regrowth of the axon in the periphery,
Schwann cells regenerate a myelin coating around
the nerve cell. In this process the membrane of the
Schwann cell progressively wraps around the axon.
The membrane contains many insulating products
such as myelin, which promote saltatory conduc-
tion between the nodes of the exposed axon.
Neuroglia
The neuroglia are the cells that support the func-
tion of the neurons. In fact, they outnumber the
neurons by approximately 10:1. Three types of
neuroglia can be identiﬁed:
1 Astrocytes
2 Microglia
3 Myelinating glia.
Astrocytes
Astrocytes are the most numerous glial cells. They
act as interstitial cells, ﬁlling much of the space not
containing blood vessels or neurons, and may be
involved in regulating the precise space that a
neuron can occupy.

Neuroscience

Astrocytes regulate the concentration of ions in
the extracellular space, particularly those that
affect neuronal function. They also contain stores
of glycogen, which can be broken down into
glucose during the sympathetic response to boost
neuronal function and energy. Astrocytes are
tightly packed around synapses and may regulate
the contents of the synapse, preventing the leak of
neurotransmitters. In addition, astrocytes have
high afﬁnity uptake systems for neurotransmit-
ters such as serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or
5-HT) to aid removal of neurotransmitters from
the synapse.
Microglia
Microglia are the smallest glial cells. They can
differentiate into macrophages in response to

Cut
A myelinated peripheral nerve cell is 
supported by many Schwann cells that 
generate a coat of myelin around the cell to 
increase the speed of conduction. Due to the 
length of the nerve cells projecting into the 
periphery, the axon of the cell may become 
transected as a result of trauma.
Degeneration
If the axon becomes transected, the portion 
of the axon that is detached from the cell 
body can no longer survive, and rapidly 
withers. In this process the myelin sheath 
surrounding the cells also withers, although 
the Schwann cells themselves survive. 
Regrowth
The portion of the Schwann cell that 
remains connected to the cell body begins 
to resprout and can regrow, its course 
guided by the surviving Schwann cells. The 
rate of growth is slow, and it can take many 
months for the longest nerve cells to 
reinnervate their target tissues after 
transection.
Remyelination
As the axon of the nerve cell regrows the 
Schwann cells, which support it, 
regenerate the myelin sheath to allow 
conduction down the nerve fibre.
Figure 17.2 Nerve cells may be exceptionally long; if the axon is cut, the portion attached to the cell body may
regrow. In the periphery, the existence of Schwann cells to guide this axonal growth can allow it to reinnervate its
original target organ, to return some innervation that may have been lost by the initial transection.
Neuroscience 451

damage and inﬂammation, allowing an immune
response within the CNS.
Myelinating glial cells
Some glial cells provide the neurons with layers of
myelin to insulate the nervous cell and promote
saltatory conduction to speed up action potential
conduction. In the PNS myelination is achieved by
Schwann cells, which myelinate a single neural
cell. In the CNS, the arrangement is more complex
because a single oligodendrocyte can myelinate
many neurons.
In the PNS and the CNS not all axons are mye-
linated; these typically have a slow conduction
speed due to their small diameter, as well as their
lack of myelin.
Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells also help
the axonal growth of nerve cells by directing their
growth pathway. In the cerebellum, the Bergmann
glia are a specialised set of cells found during
development that direct the migration of granule
cells toward their correct locations.
The ventricular system
and the blood–brain
barrier
The brain is a metabolically active organ. Although
it makes up about 2% of the total body weight,
it requires around 15% of the resting cardiac
output, and accounts for about 20% of total
body oxygen consumption. The brain is very sen-
sitive to changes in its environment, which is
tightly regulated and somewhat different in its
make-up to blood. The brain and the body are
separated by the blood–brain barrier, which is
made up of a continuous endothelial layer with
a particularly dense basement membrane, allow-
ing transport of substances in an almost entirely
selective manner.
There are a few sites where the barrier is not
present are normally associated with secretion of
substances from the CNS into the blood:
. Pituitary gland
. Pineal gland
. Epithelium of the choroid plexus
. Preoptic recess
. Paraphysis.
Structure of the blood–brain
barrier
The endothelial cells in blood vessels in the brain
are continuous, containing no fenestrations. They
possess tight junctions, which prevent the move-
ment even of ions. The endothelial cells are sur-
rounded by a layer of pericyte-like cells to regulate
blood ﬂow, and the basolateral surface of the
endothelial cells is covered by processes from
astroglial cells, which cover over 95% of the endo-
thelial surface.
Transport across the blood–brain
barrier
Given the restrictive nature of the blood–brain
barrier, transport of substances into, or out of, the
brain requires selective transport by protein trans-
porters. This is reﬂected in the high levels of mi-
tochondria present in the endothelial cells. The
large amount of transport accounts for a propor-
tion of the brain’s high energy requirement. Entry
of substances into the CSF is achieved in three
distinct ways:
1 Lipid-soluble substances are capable of direct
diffusion across the endothelial cell mem-
branes, although if they are too lipid soluble
they are unlikely to be present in the blood in
sufﬁcient concentrations; they may also bind
serum albumin, which is likely to reduce their
delivery.
2 Transport by facilitated diffusion allows the
transport of many water-soluble substances
into the CSF. In particular, glucose, which is
almost the exclusive food of the brain, is trans-
ported by this method through the GLUT1
transporter.
3 Many small amino acids are produced in the
brain and must be removed by active transport.
In particular, glycine which is used as an inhib-
itory neurotransmitter must be removed against
its concentration gradient.
Transport of drugs across the
blood–brain barrier
The transport of drugs into the brain presents a
difﬁcult problem, ﬁrst due to the nature of the
regulated transport by the blood–brain barrier.

resistance (MDR) transporter. This transporter has
a physiological role in transporting steroid mole-
cules out of the brain, although it can also act to
transport many drugs out.
The metabolic blood–brain barrier
Endothelial cells in the blood–brain barrier express
enzymes that can metabolise solutes before they
are transported into the brain. These systems may
also inﬂuence the delivery of drugs, e.g. L-dopa.
L-Dopa is readily transported into endothelial cells,
although it is then degraded by the enzymes mono-
amine oxygenase and dopa decarboxylase. To en-
sure effective treatment for parkinsonism, L-dopa
requires administration with a dopa decarboxylase
inhibitor.
CLINICAL Breakdown of the
blood–brain barrier
Some diseases (e.g. bacterial meningitis) can
cause increased permeability of the blood–brain
barrier. This may allow drugs access to the CNS,
which is not usually possible.
Cerebrospinal ﬂuid
The cells of the brain are bathed in CSF, maintain-
ing a constant environment for them. CSF is pro-
duced by the choroid plexus in the ventricular
system and circulates through to the subarachnoid
spaces, before draining into the venous sinuses of
the brain. This drainage system allows the removal
of many metabolites from the brain that are po-
tentially toxic. The CSF performs several functions:
. Serves as a mechanical cushion for the brain
. Provides nutrients for the cells for the CNS
. Acts as a conduit for some hormones secreted by
the hypothalamus, which act on remote sites of
the brain
. Allows sensing of pH changes to regulate cerebral
blood ﬂow and pulmonary ventilation
. Removes metabolites from cells
. Acts as a lymphatic system for the brain.
The ventricular system
The CSF circulates through the ventricular system,
bathing the brain cells. The ventricular system is
made up of four ventricles which are connected by
a series of conduits, all of which develop from the
cavity of the neural tube. The chambers in the
ventricular system are ﬁlled with CSF and lined
with ependymal cells. There are four ventricles
(Fig. 17.3):
. Two lateral ventricles – one in each cerebral
hemisphere
. The third ventricle
. The fourth ventricle.
The lateral ventricle
The lateral ventricle is C shaped and contained
within the parietal lobe of the cerebrum. The ven-
tricle has three horns – anterior, posterior and
inferior – which project into the frontal, occipital
and temporal lobes, respectively. On the medial
aspect of each ventricle is an interventricular fo-
ramen, which communicates with the third ven-
tricle and lies between the anterior fornix and the
anterior aspect of the thalamus. The choroid plex-
us lies on the medial aspect of the lateral ventricles
between the body of the fornix and the superior
surface of the thalamus.
The third ventricle
The third ventricle is a slit-like chamber in the
midline, between the two thalami. It is connected
to the lateral ventricles through the interventricu-
lar foramina, and with the fourth ventricle through
the cerebral aqueduct. The third ventricle is
bounded anteriorly by the anterior commissure,
posteriorly by the cerebral aqueduct and (more
superiorly) by the posterior commissure. The roof
of the ventricle is also lined with choroid plexus
and has a blood supply from the internal carotid
and basilar arteries.
The cerebral aqueduct
This short (<2.5 cm) channel connects the third
and fourth ventricles, allowing a ﬂow of CSF from
the third to the fourth ventricle. The aqueduct
contains no choroid plexus and is surrounded by
a region of grey matter – the periaqueductal grey –
which is important in the response to pain.
The fourth ventricle
The fourth ventricle is located between the cere-
bellum and pons and is continuous with the
cerebral aqueduct, which links it to the third ven-
tricle. The fourth ventricle is continuous inferiorly
Neuroscience 453

with the central canal of the medulla and spinal
cord, and is bounded laterally by the inferior cer-
ebellar peduncles. The choroid plexus of the fourth
ventricle is suspended from its roof and is supplied
by the posteroinferior cerebella arteries.
Central canal of the spinal cord and
medulla oblongata
The central canal is located inferior to the fourth
ventricle, extending down through the lower part
of the medulla, to the bottom of the spinal cord. At
the bottom-most point, there is an expanded
chamber – the conus medullaris. The central canal
is closed at its lower end and lined with ependymal
cells, although no choroid plexus is present.
The cisterns and subarachnoid space
The subarachnoid space is ﬁlled with CSF and
completely surrounds the brain, extending along
the olfactory nerves towards the nose. In most
regions this is a small space, because the meninges
follow the surface of the brain closely; however, in
regions at the base of the brain, the subarachnoid
space becomes expanded into a cistern.
The subarachnoid space extends to surround the
spinal cord, and invests the cauda equina, to the
level of S2–3. The subarachnoid space also sur-
rounds the cranial and spinal nerves to the point
at which they leave the skull and the spinal cord.
The meninges then fuse with the perineurium of
the nerve.
Ependymal cells
Ependymal cells line the ventricular system of the
brain and spinal cord. They are ciliated and as-
semble as a single layer of cells, directing the ﬂow
of CSF through the ventricular system. Ependymal
cells can be classiﬁed as follows:
. Ependymocytes line the ventricles and the
central canal of the spinal cord. The cells are
connected by gap junctions which allow CSF

Figure 17.3 The ventricular system of the central nervous system allows ﬂow of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), which
bathes the cells of the central nervous system. CSF is produced by the choroid plexus, which is located in the lateral,
third and fourth ventricles. The ﬂow of CSF is from the lateral ventricles, which are located in the cerebral
hemispheres, to the third ventricle, which is located deep in the brain, and surrounded by the thalamus. From
there CSF ﬂows to the very thin fourth ventricle and onwards to the central canal of the spinal cord. The fourth
ventricle is also connected by other foramina to the cisternae, which are collections of CSF. The CSF collects in
cisternae and subsequently ﬂows to the subarachnoid space, where it is reabsorbed into the venous blood through
arachnoid granulations.

through, to communicate with the cells of the
CNS.
. Tanycytes are specialised ependymal cells lining
the ﬂoor of the third ventricle over the median
eminence of the hypothalamus. These have long
processes that protrude between the median
eminence cells, coming into direct contact with
the capillaries.
Theependymalcellsinthechoroidplexusarejoined
by tight junctions to prevent CSF ﬂowing between
them and leaking into the underlying tissues.
Reabsorption of CSF
CSF is reabsorbed through the arachnoid granula-
tions. These are sites at which the arachnoid tissue
protrudes through the dura and into the venous
sinuses as villi. These villi act as one-way valves to
allow the ﬂow of CSF into the venous sinuses. The
villi contain ﬁne vessels through which the CSF
ﬂows. An increase in pressure closes these vessels
and prevents the ﬂow of blood through the villi into
the CSF.
CLINICAL Hydrocephalus
If the production or removal of CSF is not correctly
regulated, the volume of ﬂuid in the skull may in-
crease, resulting in hydrocephalus. This condition
may be congenital or acquired later in life.
Congenital hydrocephalus is often caused by ste-
nosis of the cerebral aqueduct – through the over-
growth of neuroglial cells – or the replacement of the
aqueduct with a series of minute channels, which do
not provide sufﬁcient drainage. Hydrocephalus can
be diagnosed on ultrasonography. It causes en-
largement of the fetal head and can contribute to a
difﬁcult labour.
In the adult, raised intracranial pressure due to
hydrocephalus causes headaches, unsteadiness
and mental impairment:
. Obstructive hydrocephalus is likely to develop
due to the growth of a tumour blocking the ven-
tricular system.
. Communicating hydrocephalus is caused by a
blockage in the drainage of the arachnoid gran-
ulations – it can occur due to adhesion of the
meninges subsequent to trauma or meningitis.
Hydrocephalus, regardless of its cause, is treated
by insertion of a shunt, normally into the jugular vein,
to allow adequate drainage of ﬂuid.
CLINICAL Lumbar puncture
Access beyond the blood–brain barrier may be
required to administer drugs to the CNS or to ac-
quire a sample ofCSF. Accessisobtainedthrougha
lumbar puncture. Although the spinal cord ends at
around the level of L1 in the adult, the subarachnoid
space continues until S2. By introducing a needle at
the level of the iliac crests (L4–5) a sample of CSF
can be obtained without damage to the CNS.
To reach the vertebral canal several layers of struc-
ture must be passed:
. Skin
. Fascia
. Supraspinous ligament
. Interspinous ligament
. Ligamentum ﬂavum
. Connective tissue
. Dura mater
. Arachnoid mater.
The vasculature of the
brain
Arterial supply
The brain receives a large blood supply through
four major vessels – the paired internal carotid
arteries and the paired vertebral arteries. The main
blood supply to the meninges is the middle men-
ingeal artery which is a branch of the external
carotid artery:
. The circle of Willis receives blood from the four
major arteries supplying the brain, forming a
circle that sends off branches to supply the ce-
rebral cortex and many subcortical structures
(Fig. 17.4). This arterial arrangement has a sur-
vival advantage, because, if there is a stenosis of
one vessel, the others may be able to compensate
to ensure that sufﬁcient blood continues to reach
the brain.
. The internal carotid arteries are direct conti-
nuations of the common carotids. They contrib-
ute to the circle of Willis and the anterior circu-
lation of the brain. Unlike the external carotid
arteries, the internal carotids haveno branches in
the neck and enter the skull through the carotid
Neuroscience 455

canal located in the temporal bones. In the skull,
the internal carotid arteries pass through the
cavernous sinus. The internal carotids arise in
the neck at the level of the thyroid cartilage, at the
bifurcation of the common carotid artery into the
internal and external branches. The carotid bod-
ies are located at the site of bifurcation and have
an important role in the regulation of the blood
composition. The vertebral arteries supply the
posterior circulation of the brain, and are the ﬁrst
branches of subclavian arteries. They travel
through the transverse foramina of the vertebra
and are usually of unequal size, with the left
typically being larger. The arteries travel in the
subarachnoid space and enter the neurocranium
through the foramen magnum.
At the inferior border of the pons, the vertebral
arteries unite to form a single basilar artery which
travels up the anterior aspect of the posterior fossa.
The basilar artery gives off many branches before
branching into two terminal branches, the poste-
rior communicating arteries of the circle of Willis.
The basilar artery
The basilar artery results from fusion of the ver-
tebral arteries and is responsible for supplying the

two vertebral arteries and gives many branches off to other regions of the branch as is ascends through the foramen
magnum before joining the circle.

Neuroscience

cerebrum. It gives off many signiﬁcant branches to
supply structures close to its path.
The posterior inferior cerebellar artery
The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) isthe
largest branch of the basilar artery and follows a
course between the medulla and cerebellum. It
sends off branches that supply the posterior part
of the cerebellum, the inferior vermis and central
nuclei of the cerebellum, and the choroid plexus of
the fourth ventricle.
CLINICAL Wallenberg's syndrome
Wallenberg’s, orlateralmedullary, syndrome results
from an occlusionof the PICA. The symptoms reﬂect
the damage caused through infarction of the lateral
medulla:
. Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the
contralateral side of the body due to disruption of
the spinothalamic tract
. Loss of pain sensation on the ipsilateral side of the
face due to disruption of the trigeminal nucleus
. Vestibular dysfunction (dizziness, vertigo and
nystagmus) as a result of disruption of the
cerebellum
. Ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome due to the disrup-
tion of the descending sympathetic ﬁbres
. Ataxia, due to damage to the cerebellum or the
inferior cerebellar peduncle.
Vasculature of the hypothalamus
The hypothalamus and the surrounding median
eminence structures do not possess a convention-
al blood–brain barrier, as is reﬂected in their ability
to secrete hormones. They are supplied by two
hypophyseal arteries, both derived from the inter-
nal carotids:
1 The inferior hypophyseal artery supplies only
the posterior pituitary gland.
2 The superior hypophyseal artery supplies the
hypothalamus.
Venous drainage of the brain
The brain is drained by a series of venous sinuses
that coalesce to drain into the internal jugular
veins, returning blood to the systemic circulation.
Venous sinuses are composed of cavities in the
dura, lined by endothelial cells. There are some
prominent sinuses that drain blood from large
regions of the brain:
. The superior sagittal sinus runs along the super-
ior aspect of the brain on the line of the great
longitudinal ﬁssure. It runs at the site of attach-
ment of the falx cerebri to the skull.
. The inferior sagittal ﬁssure runs along the
inferior aspect of the falx cerebri above the
corpus callosum.
. The transverse sagittal sinus is a major sinus
that winds along the occipital bone and the
parietal and temporal bones at the back of the
skull. It receives blood from the superior and
inferior sagittal sinuses and transports it to the
jugular foramen, where it drains into the jugular
vein via the sigmoid sinus.
. The cavernous sinus is found between the sphe-
noid and temporal bones lateral to the sella
turcica. It carries many nerves and vessels within
it. In particular, the internal carotids and the
nerves associated with eye movement (CN III,
IV and VI), and the ophthalmic and maxillary
branches of the trigeminal nerve, pass through
the carotid sinus.
. The sigmoidal sinus is found in the temporal
bone and drains into the internal jugular vein.
DEFINITION Falx cerebri and tentorium
cerebelli
Two prominent folds of dura divide the gross struc-
tures of the brain:
1 Falx cerebri: a sickle-shaped fold of dura mater
that dips down from the frontal bone and sepa-
rates the cerebral hemispheres
2 Tentorium cerebelli: a tent-like infolding of the
dura mater that separates the cerebellum below
from the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemi-
spheres above.
The gross structure
of the brain
Developmentally, the brain is made up of three
regions – forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain – of
which the forebrain makes up the largest volume.
Neuroscience 457

Neuroanatomical divisions do not always corre-
spond to functional divisions. Instead, they are
based on structural distinctions (Fig. 17.5).
The forebrain
The forebrain is the largest part of the brain and is
divided into two cerebral hemispheres separated
bythegreattransverseﬁssurewhichrunssagittally
in the midline. The cerebral cortex of each hemi-
sphere can be divided into four major lobes, which
are named in relation to the neighbouring bones:
1 The frontal lobe is the anterior part of the brain,
sitting in the anterior cranial fossa. It contains
regions associated with higher cognitive func-
tions and some aspects of movement. The fron-
tal lobe is separated from the parietal cortex by
the central sulcus, which runs out from the great
transverse ﬁssure to the lateral cerebral ﬁssure.
2 Theparietallobeliesposteriortothefrontallobe
and sits in the middle cranial fossa. The anterior
region of the parietal lobe is concerned with
somatosensory inputs, whereas the posterior
aspect contains the association cortex, which
interprets sensory information and contributes
to higher functions such as language and
recognition.
3 The temporal lobe is located inferiorly to the
parietal and frontal lobes, and separated from
them by the lateral ﬁssure. The temporal lobe
contains the primary auditory complex, which
processes sound information, and also the audi-
tory association cortex, including Wernicke’s
area which is responsible for understanding
speech. The inferomedial part of the temporal
cortex contains the hippocampus and the
amygdala.
4 The occipital lobe is the most posterior of the
lobes, and is separated from the parietal lobe by
the parieto-occipital sulcus. At the most poste-
rior regions the occipital lobe contains the pri-
mary visual cortex which processes information
from the eyes. This region is marked by the
calcarine sulcus.
The structure of the cerebral cortex
The cerebral cortex covers the surface of the brain
and is folded to increase the available area. The
cortex is made up of several layers of unmyelinated
neurons

lobes – each of which is broadly associated with a speciﬁc range of functions. Although the functional regions of the
cortex are not accurately delineated on the cortex, most functional regions can be localised approximately to
speciﬁc anatomical parts of the cortex. In particular, the somatosensory and primary motor cortices can be found
posterior and anterior, respectively, to the central sulcus. Similarly, the auditory cortex can be found on the superior
temporal gyrus.

Neuroscience

manners, allowing the processing of neural inputs.
In the cortex, regions are organised into different
areas with different functions:
. Primary sensory cortices receive direct inputs
from the various senses of the body and process
this information so that it can be used by other
regions of the brain.
. Association and secondary sensory cortices re-
ceive inputs from the primary cortex and are
involved in processing information from the pri-
mary cortex. Regions of secondary and associa-
tion cortex are involved in speech and language
comprehension (Wernicke’s area).
. The prefrontal and association cortices are in-
volved in decision-making and higher cognitive
functions. These cortices receive inputs from the
sensory cortices as well as from other subcortical
structures – particularly the limbic system.
. The primary motor cortex receives inputs from
the sensory structures, allowing feedback on
movement. It also receives inputs from second-
ary and association motor cortices and the
prefrontal cortex to instruct the muscles. The
primary motor cortex sends signals down a
variety of spinal tracts by which it communicates
with the muscles in the body.
The structure of the cortex varies based on its
function, although two main types can be identi-
ﬁed with very distinct structures:
1 Neocortex makes up about 95% of the cortex,
and consists of a structure of six layers of heavily
interlinked neurons.
2 Archicortex is evolutionarily older and consists
of only threelayersof neurons. Althoughit makes
up a small proportion of the cortex, it has many
important functions, e.g. the hippocampus.
Organisation of the cortex
The neocortex is arranged into six layers, which are
arranged from the outside to the inside:
. Layers 1 and 2 consist of scattered neurons and
pyramidal cells.
. Layer 3 is made up of many pyramidal cells and is
the site of many cortical–cortical connections.
. Layer 4 contains many different cell types. It
receives connections from other regions of the
cortex, and also from the thalamus.
. Layer 5 contains many large pyramidal cells and
forms many subcortical connections.
. Layer 6 sends connections to the thalamus.
Gyri in the cerebrum
The gyri are raised areas in the cerebral hemi-
spheres, many of which have signiﬁcant functions.
The gyri are separated by numerous grooves in the
cortex, known as sulci:
. The calcarine gyri are located at either side of the
calcarine sulcus on the occipital lobe and contain
the primary visual cortex.
. The superior temporal gyri run parallel to the
lateral ﬁssure and contain the primary auditory
cortex on their superior side.
. The precentral gyrus is found anterior to the
cen-tral sulcus and contains the primary motor
region controlling the contralateral half of the
body.
. The postcentral gyrus contains the primary so-
matosensory cortex and is found posterior to the
central sulcus, on the parietal lobe. The somato-
sensory cortex receives input from the contra-
lateral half of the body.
. The insula is an area of cortex located deep in the
lateral sulcus and cannot be seen without mov-
ing the lips of the sulcus. It is associated with the
processing of taste.
. The uncus is the medial protrusion of the para-
hippocampal gyrus and makes up the cortical
part of the amygdala. The uncus contains the
primary olfactory cortex.
Internal structures of the cerebral
hemispheres
Beneath the cortex are many white matter struc-
tures of the hemispheres. These myelinated tracts
of ﬁbres link different cortical regions and may link
the two cerebral hemispheres. Three different
types of ﬁbres can be found in the white matter
of the cerebral hemispheres:
. Association ﬁbres connect different cortical
sites in the same hemispheres, often connecting
primary cortices to their related association
areas.
. Commissural ﬁbres form connections between
the hemispheres. The most prominent of these
structures is the corpus callosum.
. Projection ﬁbres link parts of the cerebral
cortex with subcortical regions. Most projection
ﬁbres are contained in the corona radiata of the
internal capsule.
Neuroscience 459

The corpus callosum
The corpus callosum is a huge network of mye-
linated ﬁbres linking the two cerebral hemi-
spheres. It can be seen at the base of the great
transverse ﬁssure and links the corresponding
regions in each hemisphere. Although it links all
the structures, the corpus callosum is shorter than
the hemispheres, which leads to bowing of the
ﬁbres at both the anterior and posterior edges of
the structure.
The internal capsule
Most of the ﬁbres that link the cerebral cortex
with subcortical structures are contained in a
large sheet, the internal capsule. The capsule
starts close to the cortex as a wide radial sheet –
the corona radiata – and converges as it travels
between the thalamus and the caudate nucleus,
towards the brain stem. The internal capsule
can be divided into regions that have different
connections:
. The anterior limb of the internal capsule con-
nects the prefrontal cortex to the mediodorsal
nucleus of the thalamus and to the pontine.
. The genu of the internal capsule is a ﬂexion
between the anterior and posterior limbs.
. The posteriorlimb of the internal capsule con-
tains the corticobulbar ﬁbres, which connect the
cortex to the medulla. It contains ﬁbres of the
corticospinal motor tract and the ﬁbres linking
the ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus to
the primary somatosensory cortex, and the ven-
trolateral nuclei with the motor regions of the
frontal lobe.
. The retrolenticular part of the internal capsule
is the most posterior region and contains ﬁbres
from the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei of
the thalamus, which pass to the auditory and
visual cortices, respectively.
The fornix
The fornix is the major outﬂow tract from the
hippocampus. This bundle of ﬁbres passes in a
large loop to connect to the mamillary bodies of the
hypothalamus. The outﬂow of the hippocampus
starts at its posterior aspect and forms the posterior
columns of the fornix, which fuse together in the
midline to allow communication between the two
hippocampi and follow a course anteriorly, over
the thalamus, and immediately inferior to the
corpus callosum. The fornix then divides into two
anterior columns, each connecting to its respective
hypothalamus.
Basal ganglia
The basal ganglia are a series of subcortical nuclei
that are involved in the initiation of movement.
The role of these structures is discussed later in
relation to movement, although there anatomy is
brieﬂy outlined here. Two main regions can be
identiﬁed:
1 The caudate nucleus
2 The lentiform nucleus, made up of the globus
pallidus and the putamen.
The caudate nucleus
The caudate nucleus is a large region of grey
matter close to the lateral ventricle, which lies
lateral to the thalamus. The large round body of
the caudate nucleus forms the lateral wall of the
anterior horn of the lateral ventricle and is contin-
uous inferiorly with the putamen of the lentiform
nucleus. Posterior to the body of the caudate nu-
cleus is a long slender tail that follows the lateral
ventricle
and
terminates
posteriorly
in
the
amygdala.
The lentiform nucleus
The lentiform nucleus is made up of two sections:
the putamen and globus pallidus.
The putamen is continuous inferiorly with the
head of the caudate nucleus and consists of a
wedge of grey matter located between the internal
and external capsules. The globus pallidus is the
lighter portion of the lentiform nucleus, due to its
high proportion of white matter. It is separated
from the medial aspect of the putamen by a thin
sheet of white matter.
The diencephalon
The diencephalon contains structures concerned
with regulation of body function, and serves as a
relay for ﬁbres projecting to and from the cortex. It
is a paired forebrain structure continuous with
the midbrain, and is almost entirely surrounded
by the cerebral hemispheres. It consists of four
structures:
. The
thalamus
–
the
largest
part
of
the
diencephalon
460
Neuroscience

. The hypothalamus – crucial for regulation of the
neuroendocrine system.
. The epithalamus – containing the melatonin-
secreting pineal gland
. The subthalamus – part of the basal ganglia.
The thalamus
The thalamus (ﬁg. 17.6) is a relay to process infor-
mation being transmitted to the cortex and has a
large number of reciprocal connections with the
cortex; this allows it to moderate transmission of
information to the cortex. The thalamus can
regulate the rate and quantity of information
reaching speciﬁc regions of the cortex.
Location and structure
The thalamus is roughly ovoid in shape and
makes up part of the lateral wall of the third
ventricle. The internal capsule lies lateral to it, with
the caudate nucleus being located anterolaterally.
The paired thalami are connected through the
interthalamic adhesion, which joins them across
the ventricle.
Organisation of the thalamus
The thalamus is made up of nuclei that receive a
distinct tract of neurons and relay them to the
cortex via the internal capsule. There are two types
of nuclei found in the thalamus:
1 Relay nuclei are made up of speciﬁc groups of
cells and closely associated with a particular
cortical region.
2 Diffuse nuclei are located in the midline of the
thalamus or the internal medullary lamina of the
thalamus.
The nuclei project to many structures, both in
the cortex and deep to it. The internal medullary
lamina serves to split the thalamus into three
regions that contain relay nuclei. The thalamic
relay nuclei are arranged into four groups:
. The anterior nucleus is involved in memory and
emotion, receiving inputs from the mamillary
bodies of the hypothalamus and the hippocam-
pus. It projects to the cingulate and frontal
cortices.
. The medial nuclei are implicated in memory.
The major nucleus in this group is the medio-
dorsal nucleus which receives inputs from the
basal ganglia, amygdala and midbrain, and pro-
jects to the frontal cortex.
. The ventral nuclei are responsible for relaying
sensory and motor information to the cortex. The
major motor nuclei are the ventral anterior and
ventral lateral nuclei. The ventral posterior lat-
eral nucleus is particularly important in relaying
somatosensation.

Figure 17.6 The thalamus (there, the right thalamus, viewed superiorly) is split by the internal medullary lamina,
which splits the thalamus into anterior, lateral and medial nuclei. At the posterior region of the lateral nuclei are two
regions, the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei. Furthermore, the thalamus is surrounded by a capsule of ﬁbres on
the lateral aspect – the reticular nucleus.
Neuroscience 461

. The posterior nuclei are responsible for relaying
auditory and visual signals and integrating them.
In particular, the lateral and medial geniculate
nuclei receive visual and auditory information,
respectively, and relay them to their respective
cortical areas.
The reticular nucleus
The outermost sheet of neurons in the thalamus
forms a diffuse network that receives collateral
ﬁbres from other thalamic nuclei. The reticular
nucleus receives inputs from the brain stem’s re-
ticular formation, enabling it to moderate cortical
transmission according to arousal levels. Unlike
the other neurons in the thalamus, the predomi-
nant neurotransmitter is the inhibitory neuro-
transmitter, GABA.
Regulation of the thalamic nuclei
Activity of a thalamic nucleus can be modulated by
stimuli from different sources, which can also
modulate output to the cortical regions. Inputs
received in a thalamic nucleus are subject to sev-
eral levels of processing:
. Local processing in the nucleus
. Modulation by inputs from the brain stem,
particularly the adrenergic and serotoninergic
systems
. Inhibitory feedback from the reticular nucleus
. Excitatory feedback from the neocortex.
The hypothalamus
Structure, location and function
The hypothalamus is located beneath the thalami
and consists of a small mass of grey matter, on
either side of the ﬂoor of the fourth ventricle. The
hypothalamus is the major control of homoeo-
static and autonomic systems in the body.
The hypothalamus secretes hormones into the
bloodstream. As a result, it is not protected
from the vascular circulation by the blood–brain
barrier.
Organisation of the hypothalamus
The hypothalamus is made up of many distinct
clusters of cells each responsible for regulating
discrete systems. The major nuclei and functions
are deﬁned below:
. The anterior hypothalamus is composed of the
supraoptic, paraventricular and suprachiasmatic
nuclei, and is involved in homoeostasis
– the suprachiasmatic nucleus is the ‘biological
clock’ responsible for regulating circadian
rhythms and receives input directly from the
retina
– the supraoptic nucleus is responsible for pro-
ducing antidiuretic hormone (ADH) which is
involved in the regulation of ﬂuid balance
– the paraventricular nucleus produces oxyto-
cin which is released from neurons that project
to the posterior pituitary.
. The periventricular cells have a regulatory func-
tion through the release of peptides that act on
the anterior pituitary.
. The arcuate nucleus is responsible for regulating
prolactin release through the production of do-
pamine. It is also involved in the production of
growth hormone-releasing hormone and gonad-
otrophin-releasing hormone.
. The mamillary bodies are involved in memory,
receiving input from the hippocampus, via the
fornix, and projecting to the anterior thalamus.
. The ventromedial nucleus senses glucose levels
and other signals that control appetite regulation.
. The paraventricular nucleus is made up of
many different neural cell types, and appears
to acts as the major site of integration of the
different signals and stimuli processed by the
hypothalamus.
Fibre tracts in the hypothalamus
Consistent with its role as a major regulator of
homoeostasis, the hypothalamus receives and
sends out large bundles to other regions of the
brain. It also exerts an inﬂuence over the auto-
nomic nervous system, as well as the emotional
and higher centres of the nervous system:
. The fornix connects the hippocampus to the
mamillary bodies of the hypothalamus.
. The ventral amygdalofugal path connects the
hypothalamus and the amygdala, carrying inputs
associated with emotion and stress.
. The mamillothalamic tract links the mamillary
bodies with the anterior thalamus, and is a cru-
cial part of the Papez circuit, involved in the
laying down of memory.
462
Neuroscience

. The medial forebrain bundle links the hypothal-
amus and thalamus, and is associated with the
limbic system.
. The hypothalamo-hypophyseal tract contains
the axons of the hypothalamic neurosecretory
neurons, which release their hormones from the
posterior pituitary gland.
Connections of the hypothalamus
The hypothalamus receives large numbers of ﬁbres
from other parts of the brain that do not form
distinct tracts. These ﬁbres make up reciprocal
connections and are unmyelinated. The major
inputs come from:
. Sensory systems:
– the retina provides ﬁbres to the suprachias-
matic nucleus, to regulate the biological clock
– the olfactory ﬁbres connect to the lateral
hypothalamus and indirectly to the amygdala
– somatosensory ﬁbres provide an indirect in-
put to the cutaneous system.
. Brain stem:
– pain ﬁbres from the periaqueductal grey send
input to the hypothalamus
– sensory ﬁbres from the internal organs con-
nect with the hypothalamus via the nucleus
tractus solitarius
– the locus ceruleus and raphe nucleus both
provide inputs to regulate the function and
activity of the hypothalamus.
. Higher centres: the limbic system provides many
inputs to the hypothalamus
The pineal gland
The pineal gland is a small structure found in the
posterior wall of the third ventricle. It is responsi-
ble for the production of melatonin, which regu-
lates circadian rhythms. Melatonin secretion is
promoted by darkness and inhibited by light. The
pineal gland remains functional throughout life,
though it becomes calciﬁed with age.
The midbrain
The midbrain sits between the diencephalon and
the hindbrain. It contains many white matter ﬁbre
tracts, as well as the most superior of the nuclei of
the cranial nerves. The midbrain also contains the
cerebral aqueduct.
The most prominent white matter structures are
the colliculi, which act as a relay point for visual
information from the optic nerve. On the posterior
side, the cerebral peduncles link the cerebellum to
the rest of the brain.
The midbrain contains grey matter nuclei that
are responsible for many different functions:
. The red nucleus relays signals to the muscles in
the rubrospinal tract.
. Nuclei controlling the muscles of the ocu-
lomotor nerve are present, as well as the
Edinger–Westphal nucleus which controls the
parasympathetic outﬂow to the eye.
. The substantia nigra makes up part of the basal
ganglia pathways related to the initiation of
movement.
The pons
The pons is located between the midbrain and the
brain stem; the posterior surface of the pons makes
up the wall of the fourth ventricle. The pons serves
as a relay between the cerebrum and the cerebel-
lum, and also contains many important regulatory
nuclei, particularly:
. pontine nucleus of the trigeminal nerve
. the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve
. abducens nucleus
. facial nerve nucleus
. vestibulocochlear nerve nucleus.
The pons also contains the centres that regulate
breathing:
. The apneustic centre in the lower pons inhibits
inspiration.
. The pneumotaxic centre in the upper pons pro-
motes inspiration.
Hindbrain
The hindbrain contains the cerebellum and the
brain
stem,
which
are
involved
in
many
‘unconscious’ processes.
Cerebellum
The cerebellum is the largest part of the hindbrain
and is connected to the brain stem by three sets of
Neuroscience 463

cerebellar peduncles. The cerebellum is entirely
involved in the motor system, working to regulate
and ‘ﬁne-tune’ conscious and unconscious move-
ment (Fig. 17.7).
Structure of the cerebellum
The cerebellum is made up of two hemispheres
joined in the midline by a region known as the
vermis. The organisation of the cerebellum follows

Figure 17.7 (a) The anterior aspect of the cerebellum (section taken at the level of the cerebellar peduncles). The
cerebellum can be divided into functional regions. The ﬂocculonodular lobe is evolutionarily the oldest part of the
cerebellum, forming the archicerebellum. This is a highly folded structure so that much of the cortex is not apparent,
but is folded into the anterior aspect of the cerebellum. The paleocerebellum occupies much of the midline
cerebellar surface known as the vermis, whereas the more lateral portions make up the neocerebellum, the largest
part of the cerebellum. Much of the anterior aspect of the cerebellum is taken up by the cerebellar peduncles,
through which the nervous ﬁbres to and from the cortex pass to the various structures in the rest of the central
nervous system. (b) Deep within the cerebellum, the cerebellar nuclei can be found. These are the sites of synaptic
connections and each group of nuclei is associated with a speciﬁc division of the cerebellum, the more lateral nuclei
being associated with the more evolutionarily new regions of the cerebellum. The dentate nuclei are associated with
the dentate nucleus, the globose and emboliform nuclei with the paleocerebellum and the fastigial nucleus with the
archicerebellum.
464
Neuroscience

a similar gross structure to the cerebral hemi-
spheres. The surface of the cerebellum is very
tightly folded grey matter, reﬂecting the huge num-
ber of cells found within it. The interior of the
cerebellar hemispheres consists of white matter
and grey matter nuclei.
The cerebellum can be divided into three lobes:
. The anterior and posterior lobes are separated
by the primary ﬁssure on the superior surface of
the cerebellum.
. The ﬂocculonodular lobe is made up of the
vermis of the cerebellum, and the ﬂocculus and
nodule which are marked by the posterolateral
ﬁssure.
Cerebellar nuclei
There are four groups of grey matter nuclei on each
side of the midline. These nuclei are made of many
multipolar neurons which send outputs through
the superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles. Lat-
eral to medial, four nuclei groups can be identiﬁed:
1 The dentate nucleus is the largest and most
lateral cerebellar nucleus and regulates volun-
tary movement. It is made up of a ‘crumpled
horseshoe-shaped’ portion of grey matter, fac-
ing medially. Efferent ﬁbres leave through the
superior cerebellar peduncle.
2 Theemboliformnucleusisalargeovoidnucleus
located just medial to the dentate nucleus.
Together with the globose nucleus, it receives
ﬁbres from the anterior lobe of the cerebellum
and projects to the red nucleus.
3 The globose nucleus is made up of many cell
groups.
4 The fastigial nucleus is the most medial nucleus
close to the fourth ventricle. It projects to the
vestibular nuclei and regulates the anti-gravity
muscles involved in standing and locomotion.
The brain stem
The brain stem is made up of the medulla
oblongata, pons and midbrain and is found in the
posterior cranial fossa. The brain stem has three
major functions:
. It carries the ascending and descending tracts
that connect the spinal cord to the forebrain.
. It contains many reﬂex centres that control con-
sciousness and autonomic function.
. It contains the nuclei for cranial nerves III–XII.
The medulla
The medulla is located between the pons and the
spinal cord. It consists of white and grey matter,
although in a different arrangement to the spinal
cord due to the growth of the fourth ventricle in the
brain stem.
The spinal cord
The spinal cord is part of the CNS that extends
down the spinal canal to the level of L1–2 in adults.
It is the major output of the brain below the neck,
and provides the motor and sensory and sympa-
thetic ﬁbres to the entire body through the spinal
nerves. The spinal cord contains both white and
grey matter, with the grey matter located interiorly.
The spinal cord is roughly cylindrical, although its
diameter varies. In general its diameter increases
as it ascends, reﬂecting the greater numbers of
ﬁbres present. There are two prominent enlarge-
ments associated with the large numbers of ﬁbres
that are received from or supply the limbs:
1 The cervical enlargement found at C3–T1
contributes to the brachial plexus.
2 The
lumbar
enlargement
found
at
L1–S3
contributes to the lumbosacral plexus.
Coverings of the spinal cord
The spinal cord is covered by the meninges; it is
much shorter than the spinal canal in an adult. As a
result, the nerve ﬁbres leave the cord at an angle
and travel down to their site of exit. At the sacral
region the ﬁbres descend beyond the end of the
cord, forming the cauda equina. The spinal cord
terminates as the conus medullaris, and then the
connective tissue extends downwards with the
cauda equina as the ﬁlum terminale, which at-
taches to the dorsal part of the coccygeal vertebrae.
The meninges cover the spinal nerves to the point
at which the dorsal and ventral roots fuse.
Spinal nerves
Thirty-one pairs of roots arise along the spinal
cord. These leave the spinal canal as dorsal and
ventral nerve roots which leave through the inter-
vertebral foramina and fuse to form the spinal
nerve. The dorsal and ventral roots contain nerve
ﬁbres with different functions:
Neuroscience 465

. Dorsal nerve roots are made up of primary
afferent ﬁbres. The sensory neurons are derived
from the neural crest. There cell bodies are lo-
cated outside the spinal cord, in dorsal root
ganglia, which appear as small enlargements of
the dorsal roots, close to the point where they
fuse with the ventral root.
. Ventral nerve roots contain the efferent nerve
ﬁbres for the motor neurons and the pregangli-
onic neurons of the autonomic nervous system
at some segments. The cell bodies of the motor
neurons are found in the grey matter of the
spinal cord.
Internal structure of the
spinal cord
The internal structure of the spinal cord is two
symmetrical halves partially divided by the dorsal
median sulcus and the ventral midline ﬁssure. In
the centre of the spinal cord is the spinal canal,
which is a continuation of the ventricular system of
the brain.
The central region of the spinal cord surround-
ing the spinal canal is made up of the grey matter
and forms an H-shaped structure (Fig. 17.8):
. The dorsal horns of the spinal cord contain the
synapses
of
the
sensory
ﬁbres
from
the
periphery.
. The ventral horns contain cell bodies of motor
neurons.
. A small lateral horn is found in the thoracic
segments. This contains cell bodies of pregan-
glionic sympathetic neurons of the autonomic
nervous system.
The white matter of the spinal cord surrounds
the grey matter and contains the ascending and
descending ﬁbre tracts.
The dorsal horn
Afferent ﬁbres entering the dorsal horn divide into
ascending and descending tracts and rapidly ter-
minate by synapsing in the grey matter. The loca-
tion of termination depends on the type of ﬁbre
and this has led to the identiﬁcation of distinct
layers (Rexed’s laminae) which receive different
nervous inputs, and are grouped according to
function:
. The posteromarginal zone (lamina I) is the dor-
sal-most tip of grey matter. It receives A
d-sensory ﬁbres and also interneurons from the
substantia gelatinosa (laminae II and III). The
efferents from the posteromarginal zone form
the anterolateral tracts.
. The substantia gelatinosa (laminae II and III)
and receives small Ad- and unmyelinated
C-ﬁbres which are associated with transmis-
sion of pain signals. Efferent cells project
to
the
spinothalamic
and
spinoreticular
tracts. The substantia gelatinosa contains in-
puts from many descending tracts, which are
thought to modulate the transmission of pain
information.
. The nucleus propria (laminae IV and V) makes
up of the major part of the dorsal horn and
receives most of the ﬁbres associated with so-
matosensation and proprioception. These ﬁbres
project to many of the ascending tracts in the
white matter, as well as sending interneurons to
other parts of the spinal cord.
. The thoracic nucleus is found between C8
and L3, and receives inputs from the ﬁbres of
many of the prioprioceptive organs. The effer-
ent neurons ascend in the posterior cerebellar
tract.
The ventral horn
The ventral horn of the grey matter is divided
into three regions that innervate speciﬁc regions
of the body:
1 The medial group of neurons is found in most
segments of the spinal cord. Its efferent ﬁbres
innervate the muscles in the axial skeleton,
including the intercostal muscles and the ab-
dominal musculature.
2 The small central group is found in the cervical
and lumbosacral regions. The central group pro-
vides innervation of the diaphragm at C3–5.
Above this region, it is the origin of the spinal
part of the accessory nerve.
3 The lateral group of neurons is found in the
lumbosacral and cervical regions, and supplies
the ﬁbres innervating the limbs.
The lateral horn
The lateral horn is found in T1–L2, where it gives
off preganglionic sympathetic ﬁbres. The lateral
horn is also present in the sacral region where
it
contributes
preganglionic
parasympathetic
ﬁbres.

Figure 17.8 The organisation of the spinal cord is relatively well conserved. It consists of a series of tracts in the
white matter of the spinal cord which surrounds the grey matter; this contains the cells that originate from, or project
to, the periphery at that level. (a) Grey matter organisation: the grey matter of the spinal cord is made up of two main
‘horns’. The dorsal horn receives sensory input from the spinal nerve at that level, whereas the ventral horn contains
motor neurons. In the thoracic and lumbosacral regions there is also a small lateral horn that contains autonomic
nerve ﬁbres projecting at that level. The grey matter is grouped into a series of laminae (I–IX). In particular, within the
dorsalhorn,ﬁbresofspeciﬁcsizesenterthe dorsalhornand formsynapseswithinparticular laminae. Althoughsmall
A d- and C-ﬁbres are found in laminae I and II, larger ﬁbres synapse in laminae III–VI. (b) The white matter of the
spinal cord is organised into a series of tracts. Speciﬁc tracts project to particular regions of the brain and are
associatedwith speciﬁcfunctions. Many tracts decussateat some point during their course,so that when they reach
the brain they carry signals to or from the contralateral side of the brain. Evolutionarily older tracts, which do not
project to higher areas, may not cross and run entirely ipsilaterally.
Neuroscience 467

Organisation of the white matter
of the spinal cord
The white matter of the spinal cord is arranged into
a series of tracts that carry sensory and motor
signals to and from the brain. Many of the tracts
are associated with a speciﬁc type of signal and a
speciﬁc region of the brain. The same organisation
is seen at each level of the spinal cord.
The corticospinal tract
The corticospinal tract carries voluntary motor
signals regulating skilled movements. The corti-
cospinal tract neurons give off branches to inhibit
other areas of cortex and the subcortical motor
regions.
Fibres from the primary and secondary motor
cortices and the parietal cortex converge at the
posterior limb of the internal capsule. As the
corticospinal tract passes through the midbrain,
the ﬁbres regulating lower body movement be-
come located on the lateral part of the tract. The
ﬁbres form bundles as they pass through the pons
and develop into the pyramids in the anterior
surface of the medulla, where most of the ﬁbres
decussate:
. The lateral corticospinal tract is formed from
those ﬁbres that decussate and provides inner-
vation to all spinal cord segments.
. The anterior corticospinal tract forms from the
few ﬁbres that do not decussate, and is present
only in the cervical and upper thoracic regions.
The vestibulospinal tract
The vestibulospinal tract integrates signals that
help
maintain
balance
and
posture
through
excitatory action on the extensor muscles and
inhibitory action on the ﬂexor muscles. The vesti-
bulospinal tract arises from the lateral vestibular
nucleus and projects down the length of the spinal
column without decussating.
The reticulospinal tract
The reticulospinal tract is a descending tract that
originates in the reticular formation. It modulates
the function of motor neurons in the spinal column
to regulate coarse voluntary movement and reﬂex
activity.
The rubrospinal tract
The rubrospinal tract originates from the red nu-
cleus and decussates to travel with the lateral
corticospinal tract. The tract provides a major
pathway for voluntary movement outside the cor-
ticospinal tract, often of the large muscles. It is
important in regulating processes such as walking.
The dorsal columns
The dorsal columns contain the signals from large
myelinated sensory ﬁbres, which are concerned
with proprioception and discriminative touch.
These ﬁbres are primary afferents originating in
the periphery, and ascend in the dorsal columns to
synapse in the medulla at the nucleus gracilis and
nucleus cuneatus. Two divisions of the dorsal
column can be identiﬁed:
1 The fasiculus gracilis is located medially and
contains ﬁbres from the lumbar and sacral parts
of the body.
2 The fasiculus cuneatus is located laterally and
contains ﬁbres from the more thoracic and cer-
vical roots.
The ﬁbres of progressively higher spinal roots are
added to the lateral aspect of the dorsal columns as
they ascend towards the medulla.
The anterolateral columns
The sensory tracts are found ventral and lateral to
the ventral horn and known collectively as the
anterolateral column. The three structures found
in the anterolateral column are named based on
the regions of the brain, to which they project.
The spinothalamic tract
The spinothalamic tract carries pain and temper-
ature stimuli, as well as non-discriminative touch
and pressure signals. The tract contains neurons
that originate in laminae I and V of the dorsal horn
and decussate at the level of entry, ventral to the
central canal, and ascend in the tract through the
spinal cord, before running parallel to the medial
lemniscus. The projections of the spinothalamic
tract can be divided into two systems:
1 Thelateraltractprojectstocentralregionsofthe
thalamusandreticularformation.Itisthoughtto
be involved in the processing of pain and tem-
perature stimuli, as opposed to touch.
468
Neuroscience

2 The anterior tract projects to the ventral pos-
terolateral part of the thalamus and to nearby
regions that are not directly associated with
somatosensation.
The spinoreticular tract
Sensory neurons synapsing on laminae VII and VIII
of the dorsal horn ascend in the spinoreticular
tract. They project to the reticular formation and
thalamus with sensory information that regulates
the level of consciousness. Most ﬁbres do not
decussate.
The spinomesencephalic tract
The spinomesencephalic tract is involved in con-
veying the affective part of pain. It follows a similar
course to the spinoreticular tract, although it is
made up of ﬁbres originating from laminae V and I,
and terminates in the periaqueductal grey matter
and mesencephalic reticular formation. It also
projects to the amygdala.
The spinocerebellar tracts
The spinocerebellar tracts convey joint and pro-
prioceptive information to the cerebellum, allow-
ing feedback from movements. There are two ma-
jor divisions:
1 The posterolateral spinocerebellar tract con-
sists of neuronsthat originate inClarke’scolumn
ofthe ipsilateral dorsal horn.Theseﬁbres receive
afferents from muscle spindles, Golgi tendon
ﬁbres, and joint receptors of the trunk and lower
limbs, providing information about movements
and posture. They ascend up to the inferior
cerebellar peduncle and enter the cerebellum,
where they terminate.
2 Theanterior spinocerebellar tractismadeupof
ﬁbres that originate from Clarke’s columns
which, unlikethe posterior spinocerebellar tract,
decussate before ascending. These ﬁbres ascend
to the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar
peduncle to provide information about the skin
and fascia, in addition to the information pro-
vided by the joint receptors, muscle spindles and
tendon organs.
Lissauer's tract
Lissauer’s tract contains neurons that enter the tip
of the dorsal horn, typically carrying information
related to pain and temperature to substantia
gelatinosa.
CLINICAL Lesions of the spinal cord
Clinical syndromes caused by lesions of the spinal
cord give characteristic patterns of sensory loss,
reﬂecting the pathways and tracts that have been
disrupted:
. Brown–Sequard syndrome is caused by a lesion
of half the spinal cord. It is characterised by
ipsilateral loss of touch perception and contralat-
eral loss of pain and temperature sensation below
the level of the lesion.
. Syringomyelia is caused by a cyst or cavity
around the central canal, often in the cervical
region, which compresses decussating second-
ary nociceptive afferents, causing a deﬁcit in pain
and temperature perception but leaving touch
perception intact.
. Anterior spinal artery syndrome results from
occlusion of the artery supplying the anterior
two-thirds of the spinal cord. It is characterised
bya deﬁcitin painandtemperatureperception, as
a result of lesioning of the anterolateral tract, but
touch perception is intact, because mechanore-
ceptor secondary afferents ascend in the dorsal
columns.
The cranial nerves
There are 12 cranial nerves that have differing
functions; other than the spinal nerve, these are
the only means of nervous communication be-
tween the brain and the body. The cranial nerves
are named sequentially in reference to the order in
which they emerge from the brain. They provide all
the sensory input from the special senses, much of
the parasympathetic outﬂow, muscular control of
the head and neck, and general sensory input from
the head and neck.
The cranial nerves originate from nuclei that
receive or provide signals associated with a speciﬁc
function. The broad role and course of each cranial
nerve are discussed below, although the mechan-
isms of the function related to them are discussed
in more detail in the relevant motor or sensory
section.
Neuroscience 469

Cranial nerve I – the olfactory
nerve
Function
The olfactory nerve is a special sensory nerve that
conveys olfactory signals to the brain, allowing
detection of substances and odours by olfactory
receptors in the nose.
Course
The olfactory cells in the roof of the nasal cavity
give off central processes that form around 20
bundles of ﬁbres. These bundles make up the
olfactory nerve. The ﬁbres pierce the cribriform
plate of the ethmoid bone and enter the olfactory
bulb, where they synapse with mitral cells and
form the olfactory tract; this divides into lateral
and medial striae:
. The lateral olfactory stria terminates in the piri-
form cortex in the anterior part of the temporal
lobe.
. The medial olfactory stria projects through the
anterior commissure to the contralateral olfac-
tory regions.
CLINICAL Anosmia after skull
fracture
In a severe head injury, the olfactory bulbs may be
torn from the olfactory nerves, or the ﬁbres may
become torn if the cribriform plate is fractured. If
all the ﬁbres are torn, the sense of smell on that side
may be lost; such damage is often associated with
CSF rhinorrhoea, in which CSF leaks through the
nose.
CLINICAL Testing the sense
of smell
Testing the sense of smell is relatively straightfor-
ward: the patient is blindfolded with one nostril
occluded and then asked to identify a common
odour. The test is then repeated for the other
nostril.
Cranial nerve II: the optic nerve
Function
The optic nerve carries visual information from the
retina to the brain.
Course
The optic nerve is formed from the axons of
the retinal ganglion cells, which project from the
eye and pass through the optic canal, to enter
the middle cranial fossa. The medial portions of the
nerves cross to form the optic chiasma, resulting in
the formation of the optic tracts, which synapse in
the lateral geniculate bodies of the thalamus.
CLINICAL Optic neuritis
Optic neuritis deﬁnes lesions of the optic nerve that
lead to a decrease in visual acuity, although with
small changes to the peripheral ﬁelds of vision.
There are many possible causes of optic neuritis,
including inﬂammation, and degenerative and de-
myelinating conditions.
Cranial nerve III: the oculomotor
nerve
Function
The oculomotor nerve innervates many of the
muscles in the orbit that control eye movement.
It controls the superior, medial and inferior rectus
muscles of the eye and the inferior oblique muscle.
It also controls the muscle of the upper eyelid –
levator palpebrae superioris. The oculomotor
nerve also transmits proprioceptive information
from these muscles back to the brain. There is a
parasympathetic component of CN III that con-
trols dilatation of the pupil.
Nuclei
There are two nuclei of the oculomotor nerve:
1 The somatic motor nucleus which controls
eye movements is found in the periaqueductal
grey matter at the levelof thesuperiorcolliculus.
2 The parasympathetic nucleus lies dorsal to the
somatic motor nucleus l. The parasympathetic
stimulus from CN III is transmitted to the ciliary
ganglion and then to the pupil, where it causes
constrictionofthepupilandciliarymusclesofthe
lens, which allows accommodation of the lens.
470
Neuroscience

Course
The oculomotor nerve emerges in the midbrain
and pierces the dura, running in the cavernous
sinus. It leaves the cranial cavity through the
superior orbital ﬁssure and divides into two:
. The superior division innervates the superior
rectus and levator palpebrae muscles.
. The inferior division innervates the inferior
and medial rectus muscles and the inferior
oblique, as well as carrying the parasympathetic
ﬁbres.
CLINICAL Lesions of cranial nerve III
A lesion of CN III causes paralysis of almost all the
muscles controlling eye movement. There is also
paralysis of the sphincter pupillari, which control
pupil size, and the ciliary muscle that regulates the
lens. A complete lesion of CN III causes character-
istic signs:
. Ptosis of the upper eyelid due to paralysis of the
levator palpebrae superioris
. No pupillary reﬂex
. Dilatation of the pupil due to unopposed sympa-
thetic stimulation
. Abduction of the eyeball slightly inferiorly, due to
unopposed action of the muscles innervated by
CN IV and CN VI
. The lens is unable to accommodate.
Lesions of CN III can be caused by the compression
of the nerve as a result of an extradural haematoma
pressing the nerve against the temporal bone, or an
aneurysm of the posterior or superior cerebellar
artery. The ﬁrst signs are often a progressively
dilating pupil and slowness in the pupillary re-
sponse to light, as the parasympathetic ﬁbres are
the most superﬁcial.
Cranial nerve IV: the trochlear
nerve
Function
The trochlear nerve innervates the superior obli-
que muscle, which moves the eye inferomedially,
and transmits proprioceptive information back to
the brain.
Nucleus
The trochlear nucleus is located immediately in-
ferior to the oculomotor nucleus in the periaque-
ductal grey matter, at the level of the inferior
colliculus.
Course
The trochlear nerve is the only nerve to emerge
from the dorsum of the midbrain and has the
longest course of any cranial nerve. It travels
around the brain stem and pierces the dura to
travel along the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus,
before entering the orbit through the superior
orbital ﬁssure.
CLINICAL Lesions of cranial nerve IV
Trochlear nerve lesions cause paralysis of the
superior oblique muscle, resulting in the eye being
directed inferomedially. The CN IV may be torn in
severe trauma due to its long intracranial course,
although it is unusual for a lesion of CN IV to occur in
isolation.
Cranial nerve V: the trigeminal
nerve
Function
The trigeminal nerve is the main sensory nerve for
the head, and also innervates the muscles of
mastication.
Nuclei
The trigeminal nerve has two main nuclei:
. The
trigeminal
sensory
nucleus
receives
branches from all three sensory divisions of
CN V. The trigeminal sensory nucleus can be
subdivided into three subnuclei:
– chief nucleus which receives ﬁbres conveying
touch and pressure
– mesencephalic
nucleus
which
receives
proprioceptive afferents from the muscles
of mastication and the temporomandibular
joint
– spinal nucleus which receives ﬁbres convey-
ing pain and temperature.
Neuroscience 471

. Trigeminal motor nucleus supplies the motor
ﬁbres that supply the muscles of mastication
Course
The trigeminal root emerges as a motor root, and a
larger sensory root at the level of the pons. The
roots pass to the trigeminal ganglion, where the
sensory route splits into the three:
1 The ophthalmic
2 The maxillary
3 The mandibular.
The motor branch of the trigeminal nerve
passes through the trigeminal ganglion to inner-
vate the muscles of mastication.
Cranial nerve VI: the abducens
nerve
Function
The abducens nerve innervates the lateral rectus
muscle, responsible for abducting the eye.
Nuclei
The abducens nucleus is found in the ﬂoor of the
fourth ventricle.
Course
CN VI exits the brain between the pons and the
medulla, where it runs along the basilar artery
before piercing the dura and travelling through
the cavernous sinus. The abducens nerve enters
the orbit through the superior orbital ﬁssure.
Cranial nerve VII: the facial nerve
Function
The facial nerve includes sensory, motor and para-
sympathetic ﬁbres:
. Motor ﬁbres supply the muscles of facial expres-
sion, muscles in the throat and the stapedius
muscle.
. Sensory ﬁbres carry general sensation from
the external ear, and taste information from
the soft palate and anterior two-thirds of the
tongue.
. Parasympathetic ﬁbres innervate the subman-
dibular and sublingual salivary glands, and the
lacrimal glands.
Nuclei
Three modalities contribute to CN VII:
1 The motor nucleus of the facial nerve is found in
the pons.
2 The ﬁbres carrying taste sensation end in the
rostral part ofthenucleus ofthe tractussolitarius
in the medulla.
3 The general sensory information from the ex-
ternal ear ends in the spinal nucleus of CN V.
Course
CN VII has two divisions – a larger motor root and a
smaller intermediate root, which carries both sen-
sory and parasympathetic ﬁbres. CN VII emerges
at the junction of the pons and the medulla, and
travels through the posterior cranial fossa and the
internal acoustic meatus, entering the facial canal
in the temporal bone. The facial nerve exits the
temporal bone through the stylomastoid foramen,
and passes across the parotid gland.
The cell bodies of the sensory ﬁbres of CN VII are
located in the geniculate ganglion, which is situ-
ated on the medial aspect of the tympanic cavity. In
the facial canal, CN VII gives off a number of
branches:
. The nerve to the stapedius
. The greater petrosal nerve
. The chorda tympani nerve.
Around the parotid gland, CN VII forms a plexus of
nerves which form six branches that innervate the
corresponding areas of the face:
1 Posterior auricular
2 Temporal
3 Zygomatic
4 Buccal
5 Mandibular
6 Cervical.
CLINICAL Facial nerve lesions
The facial nerve nucleus contributes to control of the
upper facial muscles on both sides of the face,
although it controls the lower facial muscles only
on the same side of the face. As a result, an upper
motor neuron lesion of the facial nerve results in
only the lower part of the face on the opposite side
being unaffected, whereas a lower motor neuron
lesion results in motor weakness of the entire face
on the same side as the lesion.

Neuroscience

CLINICAL Bell's palsy
Bell’s palsy results from a CN VII lesion. Afﬂicted
individuals experience unilateral facial paralysis,
an absent corneal reﬂex, hyperacusis and loss
of taste sensation in the anterior two-thirds of
the tongue on the affected side. The cause is
often not clear, although it may be secondary to a
viral infection, particularly herpes zoster virus. The
paralysis usually resolves after a few weeks but
recovery may take much longer, and can be
incomplete.
Cranial nerve VIII:
the vestibulocochlear nerve
Function
The vestibulocochlear nerve carries special senso-
ry information regarding both sound and balance
from the organs in the ear.
Nuclei
Six nuclei are innervated by CN VIII:
. The four vestibular nuclei receive information
concerning balance and movement from the
vestibular system. They are located between the
pons and medulla, on the lateral ﬂood of the
fourth ventricle.
. The two cochlear nuclei receive auditory signals
from the cochlea.
Course
The nerve emerges from the junction between
the pons and medulla and enters the internal
acoustic meatus, where it separates into the ves-
tibular and cochlear nerves:
. The vestibular nerve enters the maculae of
the utricle and saccule, and the ampullae of the
semicircular ducts, innervating the sensory cells
there.
. The cochlear nerve transmits sound waves
detected in the cochlea by synapsing with the
organ of Corti. The cell bodies of the nerve ﬁbres
are found in the spiral ganglion.
Cranial nerve IX: the
glossopharyngeal nerve
Function
The glossopharyngeal nerve innervates many
structures in the head and the neck. It provides:
. motor innervation to stylopharyngeus
. parasympathetic innervation to the parotid
gland
. sensory innervation to the posterior third of the
tongue and the mucosa of the pharynx, eusta-
chian tube and middle ear
. taste information from the posterior third of the
tongue
. information from chemoreceptors in the carot-
id body and the baroceptors in the carotid sinus.
Nuclei
CN IX has three nuclei that are associated with
different nerve ﬁbres:
. The nucleus ambiguus is found in the superior
part of the medulla and receives afferent visceral
and taste ﬁbres.
. The inferior salivatory nucleus is found in the
inferior part of the pons and is the site of origin of
the preganglionic parasympathetic neurons.
. The nucleus tractus solitarius is the site of
termination of the visceral and taste ﬁbres, and
is found adjacent to the dorsal nucleus of the
vagus.
Course
CN IX emerges from the medulla and leaves the
skull through the jugular foramen. It follows sty-
lopharyngeus before passing between the superior
and middle constrictor muscles to the oropharynx
and tongue.
Cranial nerve X: the vagus nerve
Function
The vagus nerve contains sensory motor and para-
sympathetic nerve branches:
. Sensory input is received from the pharynx,
larynx, and organs of the thorax and abdomen.
. Motor signals are sent to the soft palate, pharynx,
intrinsic
laryngeal
muscles
(which
control
Neuroscience 473

speech and intonation) and the palatine muscle
in the larynx.
. Parasympathetic ﬁbres from the vagus nerve
provide parasympathetic outﬂow to the abdom-
inal and thoracic organs.
Course
The vagus nerve arises as a series of small rootlets
on the side of the medulla. These unite and exit the
cranial cavity with CN IX and CN XI through the
jugular foramen. They travel down the carotid
sheath before entering the chest to provide
branches to the heart, bronchi and lung. The
vagus nerves also provide branches to the oeso-
phageal plexus and follow through the diaphragm
into the abdomen. The anterior and posterior vagal
trunks divide, innervating the gastrointestinal tract
and supporting structures up to the left colic
ﬂexure.
Cranial nerve XI: the accessory
nerve
Functions
The accessory nerve is a motor nerve that inner-
vates the muscles of the soft palate and pharynx, as
well as the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius
muscles in the back.
Nuclei
The two roots of the accessory nerve are associated
with different nuclei:
1 The cranial root originates in the medulla at the
caudal end of the nucleus ambiguus, arising as a
series of rootlets.
2 The spinal root arises from the spinal nucleus
which is located in the anterior horn of the ﬁrst
ﬁve to six segments of the spinal cord.
Course
The cranial and spinal roots of CN XI unite to pass
through the jugular foramen and then separate:
. The cranial root joins the vagus nerve and sends
ﬁbres to the striated muscles in the soft palate,
pharynx, larynx and oesophagus.
. The spinal root descends down the internal
carotid, innervating sternocleidomastoid. The
remaining
nerve
ﬁbres
cross
the
posterior
triangle of the neck, to innervate the superior
part of trapezius.
Cranial nerve XII: the hypoglossal
nerve
Function
The hypoglossal nerve is the motor nerve to all the
muscles of the tongue except palatoglossus.
Course
The hypoglossal nerve arises as a series of rootlets
in the medulla that exit the skull through the
hypoglossal canal. In the neck, the nerve receives
ﬁbres from the cervical plexus and passes medial to
the angle of the mandible before passing anteriorly
to enter the tongue.
Synaptic transmission
in the nervous system
There are junctions (synapses) between neurons
across which action potentials must pass. Different
cells at the same synapse may release neurotrans-
mitters with different effects at the synapse to a
single postsynaptic cell; this allows integration
from the sum of excitatory and inhibitory electrical
events, secondary to chemical transmission.
There are two main types of neurotransmitters
that are used in the CNS:
1 Classic amino acid or monoamine neuro-
transmitters can cause both fast and slow
neurotransmission, sometimes known as neu-
romodulation, depending on which receptors
they act – ionotropic or metabotropic respec-
tively. However, catecholamines are responsi-
ble only for slow neurotransmission.
2 Peptide neurotransmitters are responsible for
slow neurotransmission (e.g. opioids).
Excitatory neurotransmission
Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neuro-
transmitter in the CNS. It is produced by glial cells
from glutamine or glucose and taken up by nerve
cells via a Na þ-dependent uptake mechanism. In
addition to its role as the major excitatory
474
Neuroscience

transmitter, glutamate has some other signiﬁcant
effects:
. It is involved in the laying down of memory,
through the function of its N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors.
. Excitotoxicity is associated with glutamate re-
lease due to ischaemia, which in turn activates
NMDA receptors, resulting in cell death through
excessive Ca2 þ entry.
Membrane receptors
Glutamate receptors are mostly found in the cor-
tex, basal ganglia and on neurons in the sensory
pathway. Glutamate may bind to one of four dif-
ferent receptors, most of which take their names
from pharmacological compounds that speciﬁ-
cally activate them (Fig. 17.9):
1 AMPA
(a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxa-
zolepropionic acid)
2 Kainate
3 NMDA
4 Metabotropic.
AMPA receptors
AMPA receptors are typically found postsynapti-
cally and are responsible for the generation of fast
excitatory action potentials; they can also be found
on astrocytes. These channels have ﬁve subunits,
and allow the ﬂow of Na þ channels and, to a
limited extent, Ca2 þ channels.
Kainate receptors
Kainate receptors are responsible for the genera-
tion of fast excitatory potentials; they have a much
more limited distribution than AMPA or NMDA
receptors and may be found post- or presynapti-
cally. They are permeable to Na þ and, to a lesser
extent, to Ca2 þ.
NMDA receptors
NMDA receptors are ion channels that are partic-
ularly permeable to Ca2 þ and responsible for pro-
ducing slow excitatory potentials. They are partic-
ularly associated with synaptic plasticity and lay-
ing down of memory. NMDA receptors are typi-
cally found co-localised with AMPA receptors. The
opening of NMDA channels requires three simul-
taneous events:
1 Binding of glutamate or aspartate to the
glutamate-binding site
2 Binding of glycine to a separate site; glycine is
usually seen as an inhibitory neurotransmitter,
although is found in the brain at relatively low
concentrations that are sufﬁcient to enable their
binding to NMDA receptors
3 Depolarisation of the cell membrane: in the
hyperpolarised membrane state the ion channel
in the NMDA receptors is blocked by an Mg2 þ
ion, which must be removed to enable Ca2 þ and
other cations to ﬂow through.
Metabotropic glutamate receptor
The metabotropic glutamate receptor is a G-
protein-coupled receptor triggering an increase in
Ca2 þ through Gq. It also inhibits the action of
adenylyl cyclase, and is thought to be involved in
modulating the behaviour of a synapse:
. Postsynaptically
through
inhibition
of
K þ
channels
. Presynaptically
through
inhibition
of
Ca2 þ
channels.
Inhibitory transmission
The major inhibitor transmitter varies in the CNS:
. In the brain, GABA is the major inhibitory neu-
rotransmitter, although it is found only in trace
amounts outside the CNS.
. In the brain stem and spinal cord, glycine is the
major inhibitory neurotransmitter.
GABA
GABA is the major inhibitory transmitter in the
longer tracts running from the cerebellum and
striatum. It is produced from glutamate by the
enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and
can be converted back to glutamate through a
transamination reaction. Major functions of GABA
transmission include the following:
. Regulation of muscle tone through the inhibi-
tion of release of excitatory neurotransmitters
. Movement control as GABA is a major trans-
mitter
in
the
basal
ganglia;
in
particular
Huntington’s disease is associated with loss of
GABA-ergic neurons and leads to uncontrolled
movements.

Glycine
Ca2+
AMPA
The AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor is the most 
widely found of the glutamate receptors; upon 
binding it undergoes a conformation shift to allow 
the passage of Na+ ions, through the pore into 
the cell.
Kainate
Kainate receptors have a similar function to AMPA 
receptors, allowing the passage of Na+ ions after 
their binding of glutamate; however, they have a 
much more limited distribution of sites where they 
are found. 
NMDA
The NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor is the 
third type of ion channel that responds to 
glutamate binding, although it is very different to 
AMPA and kainate receptors. The channels are 
selective for Ca2+ and require the binding not 
only of glutamate, but also of glycine in order to 
open. Furthermore, at resting cell membrane 
potential, the channel is blocked by Mg2+ ions, 
which prevent Ca2+ from entering the cell. To 
allow the flow of Ca2+, the cell membrane must 
be depolarised at the same point as the NMDA 
channel is open, removing the Mg2+ ion to allow 
entry of Ca2+ into the cell.
Metabotrophic
The metabotrophic glutamate receptor is a 
G-protein-coupled receptor, such that the binding 
of glutamate results in the activation of the Gq 
protein. This protein acts to increase intracellular 
calcium within the cell and activates a variety of 
downstream mechanisms.
G protein (Gq)
476
Neuroscience

Two major types of GABA receptor have been
found:
1 GABAA-receptors are ligand-gated ion channels
with a pentameric structure. Binding of GABA to
GABAA-receptors causes the channel to open,
allowing the inﬂux of Cl  ions. This causes
hyperpolarisation of the cell. Modulatory sites
are also present. In particular, one binds benzo-
diazepines
such
as
diazepam, to facilitate
channel opening.
2 GABAB-receptors are G-protein-coupled recep-
tors that activate Gi to decrease cAMP by inhibit-
ing adenylyl cyclase. Presynaptically, this inhi-
bition is mediated through decreased levels of
Ca2 þ in cells. Postsynaptically, inhibition is me-
diated through elevated intracellular K þ levels.
Glycine
Glycine receptors resemble GABAA-receptors and
their activation causes hyperpolarisation. In addi-
tion to glycine, both taurine and b-alanine are
agonists of the glycine receptor.
Monoamine transmission
Monoamine molecules are neurotransmitters for
several key systems in the brain, especially those
associated with behaviour and emotion. There
are three particularly
prominent monoamine
neurotransmitters:
. Noradrenaline
. Dopamine
. Serotonin (5-HT).
Noradrenaline
The synthesis, release and reuptake of noradren-
aline in the CNS are very similar to those in the
periphery, as are the receptors. Noradrenergic
neurons are located in discrete clusters, mainly in
the pons and medulla – the locus ceruleus is a
particularly important group of such neurons.
They are also found in the median forebrain bun-
dle and the descending spinal tracts. Noradrena-
line has a predominantly inhibitory action through
b-adrenoceptors, although it can also have an
excitatory effect, acting through both a- and
b-adrenoceptors.
Noradrenergic transmission is important in
many processes, in particular:
. Alertness, through neurons in the locus ceruleus
increasing the level of consciousness; this is
reﬂected in the increased activity of these neu-
rons to unfamiliar stimuli.
. Blood pressure regulation occurs through a2-
receptors in the regulatory centres in the medul-
la. The a2-agonist clonidine may act at this site to
lower blood pressure.
. Control of mood – a reduction in noradrenergic
transmission is linked to depression.
Dopamine
Dopamine is a precursor to noradrenaline and is
also a signiﬁcant neurotransmitter. Five different
types of dopamine receptor have been identiﬁed,
all of which are coupled to G-proteins:
. D1 and D5 act through Gs to increase levels of
cAMP, causing an excitatory effect.
. D2, D3 and D4 act through Gi and decrease ade-
nylyl cyclase activity, causing an inhibitory
effect.
There are many different functions of dopamine.
In particular it is involved in three important
pathways:
. The nigrostriatal system is located in the basal
ganglia and associated with the initiation of
movement.
. The mesolimbic/mesocortical pathway in the
limbic system is responsible for the regulation of
reward response and emotion. As such many
dopamine-based therapies are associated with
mood effects.
. The hypothalamus releases dopamine to regu-
late pituitary hormones. It is the major inhibitory
control of the release of prolactin and also sti-
mulates (to a lesser extent) the release of growth
hormone.
Dopamine neurons are a major target of drug
therapies:
. The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease can be
treated by dopamine precursors (e.g. L-dopa) or
Figure 17.9 There are four different types of glutamate receptor found in the central nervous system. Three are ion
channels, whereas the fourth is coupled to a G-protein. Each channel type has a different localisation and they have
important roles in the propagation and regulation of synaptic transmission in the brain.

through receptor agonists (e.g. ropinerole, a
D2-receptor agonist).
. Schizophrenia is associated with excessive do-
paminergic activity and may be treated by using
D2-receptor antagonists (e.g. haloperidol).
5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)
5-HT is derived from tryptophan and synthesised
in the CNS, because it does not pass the blood–-
brain barrier. 5-HT neurons are concentrated in
the midline raphe nuclei of the pons and medulla.
They project to many structures in the brain, in
particular the cortex, limbic system, hypothalamus
and spinal cord. 5-HT is degraded by monoamine
oxidase and other enzymes (e.g. catechol-O-
methyltransferase or COMT).
5-HT
is
associated
with
many
different
functions:
. Regulation of behavioural responses
. Control of mood and emotion
. Control of sleep and wakefulness
. Control of sensory pathways
. Vomiting
. Pain and analgesia.
5-HT receptor
5-HT can be found on the pre- and postsynaptic
membranes of synapses, although the precise na-
ture of the response is governed by the receptor
type:
. 5-HT1 receptors are G-protein-coupled recep-
tors linked to Gi. Receptor activation has an
inhibitory effect.
. 5-HT2 receptors are G-protein-coupled recep-
tors linked to Gq. Receptor activation has an
excitatory effect.
. 5-HT3 receptors are ligand-gated cation chan-
nels. Receptor activation has an excitatory effect
on the generation of action potentials.
Many drugs act by modulating 5-HT:
. 5-HT uptake inhibitors are used to treat depres-
sion (e.g. ﬂuoxetine). These act by preventing the
reuptake of 5-HT, increasing the effective con-
centration in the synapses.
. 5-HT1-receptor agonists are used to treat anxi-
ety (e.g. buspirone).
. 5-HT3-receptor antagonists are used as antie-
metics (e.g. odansetron).
Neurochemical disorders
Most psychiatric disorders are thought to have a
neurochemical basis, although how a neurotrans-
mitter imbalance leads to the symptoms of the
disorder is often poorly understood.
Affective disorders: depression
and bipolar affective disorder
Depression is characterised by feelings of sadness
and apathy, low self-esteem, loss of motivation
(including loss of libido and appetite), changes in
sleep patterns and social withdrawal. In bipolar
affective disorder, periods of depression alternate
with periods of mania. Mania is characterised by
euphoria, heightened mental activity and delu-
sions of grandeur.
Causes of affective disorders
As affective disorders run in families, there is
thought to be a genetic component. The success
of drugs that increase the availability of monoa-
mines, as well as some studies, suggest that a
deﬁciency in monoamines might underlie affec-
tive disorders.
Treatments
Many pharmacological treatments of depression
increase the availability of monoamines in the
synapse:
. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs,
e.g.
ﬂuoxetine)
selectively
inhibit
serotonin
reuptake.
. Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. imipramine) in-
hibit reuptake of monoamines.
. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs, e.g.
moclobemide)
inhibit
the
breakdown
of
monoamines.
. Lithium and sodium valproate inhibit the
formation of inositol trisphosphate as well as
mimicking sodium ions. This modiﬁes the mem-
brane potential of neurons and ionic balance,
although it is uncertain how this modulates
mood.
Non-pharmacological treatments are also used
in the treatment of depression. These include con-
gnitive behavioural therapy psychotherapy and
electroconvulsive shock therapy.

Neuroscience

Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder charac-
terised by positive symptoms – hallucinations,
paranoia and delusions; and negative symptoms
– social withdrawal and emotional blunting.
Causes of schizophrenia
There
is
a
very
strong
genetic
component:
individuals
with
both
parents
affected
are
40 times more likely to develop schizophrenia.
Reduced blood ﬂow to the frontal cortex and
dilatation of the ventricles in the brains of people
with schizophrenia has led to the suggestion that
schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder.
The efﬁcacy of dopamine receptor antagonists in
treating the symptoms of schizophrenia suggests
that schizophrenia may be due to excessive dopa-
mine transmission in the mesolimbic reward
system.
Treatment of schizophrenia
Dopamine receptor antagonists (e.g. chlorproma-
zine)
are
effective
in
the
treatment
of
the
schizophrenia. In particular, the efﬁcacy of an
antipsychotic drug best correlates with its afﬁnity
for the D2 subtype of dopamine receptor. Dopa-
mine receptor antagonists increase the release of
prolactin, causing side effects of galactorrhoea
and gynaecomastia in males. They can also cause
a parkinsonian-like tremor.
Anxiety disorders
Anxiety is a normal psychological and physiolog-
ical response to a threatening, or potentially
threatening, situation.
Anxiety
disorders
are
characterised
by
similar psychological and physiological reactions,
but in disproportion to the stimulus, or in the
absence of an overt stimulus. In generalised
anxiety disorder, anxiety symptoms have a long
duration and occur in response to a range of
stimuli. In phobias, anxiety lasts only for the
duration of the speciﬁc trigger stimulus. Panic
attacks,
periods
in
which
the
physiological
symptoms of anxiety become very severe, can
occur in either type of anxiety disorder. Physical
symptoms, e.g. tremor, sweating, palpitations and
chest tightness, result from increased sympathetic
activity.
Causes of anxiety disorders
Anxiety disorders are thought to result from an
imbalance in the GABA and serotonin neurotrans-
mitter systems. It has also been suggested that an
imbalance of several neuropeptides, e.g. cortico-
trophin-releasing
hormone,
substance
P
and
cholecystokinin, contribute to anxiety disorders,
because these neuropeptides cause anxiety symp-
toms when injected into the brains of animals.
Treatment of anxiety disorders
There are three common pharmacological treat-
ments of anxiety disorders:
1 Benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam) reduce neuron
excitability, particularly in the raphe nucleus.
They increase binding of the inhibitory neuro-
transmitter GABA to GABAA-receptors. Benzo-
diazepines also have a sedative action, which is
used therapeutically for insomnia, and an anti-
convulsant action, which is used therapeutically
for epilepsy. These other actions correspond to
the unwanted side effects of sedation and motor
ataxia when benzodiazepines are used to treat
anxiety. More serious adverse long-term side
effects include mild amnesia and dependence.
– Buspirone
reduces
serotonin
release
by
acting as a partial agonist at presynaptic 5-
HT-inhibitory autoreceptors. The reduction in
5-HT release is thought to be responsible for
buspirone’s therapeutic effect.
– b Blockers are given when the symptoms of the
anxiety disorder are mainly physiological. Their
actions are thought to be mainly peripheral
because the effectiveness of b-antagonists is
not linked to blood–brain barrier permeability.
There are also non-pharmacological treatments
for anxiety disorders, e.g. cognitive–behavioural
therapy (CBT).
CLINICAL Cognitive–behavioural
therapy
CBT aims to treat conditions by removing negative
emotions associated with an event or state of mind,
and reframing or re-evaluating an irrational belief.
CBT is effective in treating conditions such as de-
pression and obsessive–compulsive disorders. It
may be used as a sole treatment or as an adjunct to
drug therapy.
Neuroscience 479

Recreational drugs,
addiction and tolerance
Drugs that alter the user’s state of mind are said to
be
psychotropic.
Although
most
recreational
drugs are illegal, some are licensed and used
therapeutically.
Most recreational drugs are addictive: they give
the user a compulsive urge to get hold of the drug
and use it again. Addiction is caused by the
following:
. Positive reinforcement: the drug induces pleas-
ant feelings through its action on the dopamine
mesolimbic reward system. Input of signals
from the dopamine mesolimbic reward system
to the ventral tegmental area (part of the limbic
system) increases goal-oriented activity (i.e.
actively seeking out the drug).
. Negative reinforcement: the patient experi-
ences unpleasant psychological and physical
symptoms (withdrawal) if he or she does not
take the drug.
Environmental stresses and genetics contribute to
the susceptibility of an individual to addiction.
Many recreational drugs induce tolerance so that
increasing doses must be taken to have the same
pharmacological effect. The drug induces homo-
eostatic mechanisms that offset the drug’s own
effects.
Opioid analgesics: morphine and
its derivatives
Morphine and its derivatives are used as recrea-
tional drugs because of their euphoria-inducing
properties. Heroin (diamorphine) is the preferred
form for recreational use because it is highly lipid
soluble, crossing the blood–brain barrier very rap-
idly to give a fast ‘hit’.
Some morphine derivatives are licensed for use
as painkillers due to of their potent analgesic
properties.
Mechanism of action
Morphine acts at opioid receptors, which are
normally the target of the brain’s endogenous
analgesic neurotransmitters, e.g. the enkephalins
and dynorphin. Activation of opioid receptors
triggers a Gi protein second-messenger cascade
that decreases levels of cellular cAMP, causing
K þ channels to open and Ca2 þ channels to shut.
This hyperpolarises neurons and reduces neuro-
transmitter release, inhibiting some neural path-
ways but activating others (e.g. the dopamine me-
solimbic pathway).
Euphoria is thought to be caused by morphine’s
action on m opioid receptors in the frontal cortex.
Analgesia is thought to be mediated by morphine’s
inhibition of ascending pain pathways, its activa-
tion of descending inhibitory pathways and its
dulling of the affective component of pain, by its
action on the limbic system.
Side-effects
Recreational abuse and therapeutic use of mor-
phine and its derivatives can lead to respiratory
depression: opioid analgesics decrease the sensi-
tivity of chemoreceptors in the brain’s respiratory
centres to high arterial concentrations of carbon
dioxide. Other side effects of the opioid analgesics
include:
pupillary
constriction,
nausea
and
vomiting.
Addiction and tolerance
Morphine and its derivatives are highly addictive:
. Positive reinforcement is due to morphine’s
ability to induce euphoria and its activation of
the mesolimbic system.
. Negative reinforcement is due to unpleasant
psychological
and
physiological
withdrawal
symptoms, including irritability, aggression, in-
somnia, fever, sweating and piloerection (goose
bumps).
Tolerance rapidly develops to morphine, due
to increases in the activity of adenylyl cyclase,
offsetting the reduction in cAMP that it causes via
the Gi protein second-messenger cascade.
CNS stimulants
CNS stimulants are used recreationally because
they increase alertness and reduce fatigue. Am-
phetamines and cocaine, but not methylxanthines,
also induce euphoria, by increasing activity in the
dopamine mesolimbic pathway.
CNS stimulants also have some therapeutic ap-
plications. A licensed amphetamine derivative,
methylphenidate,
improves
concentration
in
480
Neuroscience

children with attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disor-
der (ADHD). Cocaine derivatives are used as local
anaesthetics because they block sodium channels,
inhibiting conduction in primary afferent sensory
neurons in the pain pathway.
Mechanism of action
CNS stimulants increase the availability or en-
hance the effects of catecholamines (noradrena-
line, adrenaline and dopamine):
. Amphetamines, including MDMA (ecstasy), are
substrates for the catecholamine reuptake trans-
porters. By an exchange process, they increase
catecholamine release from the presynaptic
nerve terminal.
. Cocaine inhibits catecholamine reuptake.
. Methylxanthines (caffeine, found in tea and
coffee, and theophylline, found in chocolate)
prolong and enhance the actions of catechola-
mines by inhibiting the breakdown of the cAMP
second-messenger cascade that is triggered by
catecholamine receptor activation.
Side-effects
Side-effects are characteristic of overactivity in the
sympathetic nervous system. These include a re-
duction in appetite, increased heart rate and blood
pressure, and pupil dilatation.
Cocaine and amphetamine abuse can cause
psychosis and hallucinations, stereotyped repet-
itive behaviour, pathological overheating (partic-
ularly with MDMA) and cardiac arrhthymias
(irregular heart beat).
Addiction and tolerance
Cocaine and amphetamines are highly addictive:
. They trigger positive reinforcement through in-
ducing intense euphoria.
. Negative reinforcement results from the side
effects of drug withdrawal – depression and leth-
argy – which is thought to be due to catechol-
amine depletion.
Mild addiction to methylxanthines has been
suggested in humans. Tolerance builds up to
cocaine and amphetamines, causing the addict
to binge on these drugs, with a risk of toxicity.
Tolerance
builds
up
to
a
lesser
extent
to
methylxanthines.
Alcohol
Alcohol is used as a recreational drug because it
increases self-conﬁdence, decreases inhibitions
and induces euphoria.
Mechanism of action
Alcohol inhibits neuron depolarisation, reducing
activity in most of the neuronal pathways but
increasing activity in a few (e.g. the dopamine
mesolimbic system), by suppressing inhibitory in-
terneurons. Alcohol hyperpolarises the membrane
potential of neurons by:
. increasing the afﬁnity of GABAA-receptors for
GABA
. inhibiting voltage-gated Ca2 þchannels, reduc-
ing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters.
. inhibiting NMDA receptors, through which glu-
tamate mediates an excitatory effect.
Side-effects
There are both short-term and long-term side
effects due to overuse of alcohol:
. Acute overuse causes temporary deﬁcits in cog-
nition and motor coordination, and cutaneous
vasodilatation, resulting in heat loss and risk of
hypothermia.
. Chronic overuse causes permanent cognitive
deﬁcits
and
brain
atrophy.
It
also
causes
dysfunction and cirrhosis of the liver. Chronic
alcoholism can cause gastric ulcers (because
of
irritation
of
the
gastric
mucosa)
and
immunosuppression.
Addiction and tolerance
The addictive effects of alcohol are due to positive
reinforcement by euphoria and negative rein-
forcement by the symptoms of alcohol withdraw-
al: sweating, tremor, anxiety and, in extreme cases,
delirium tremens (confusion, hallucination and
aggression).
Tolerance to alcohol builds up rapidly through
two broad mechanisms:
. Tissue tolerance is mediated by a reduction
in GABAA-receptors and an increase in voltage-
gated Ca2 þ channels and NMDA receptors.
. Increased metabolism of alcohol in the liver
results from increased expression of the enzymes
Neuroscience 481

alcohol
dehydrogenase
and
acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase.
An inhibitor of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase,
disulﬁram, is sometimes given to individuals with
alcohol problems. It causes unpleasant symptoms
such as nausea, anxiety and palpitations, helping
the patient to dissociate alcohol from pleasant
feelings.
CLINICAL Variations in alcohol
metabolism
The kinetics of alcohol metabolism differs in dif-
ferent racial groups. This is associated with the
expression of different alleles of acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase. In the Asian population, there is
a variant allele of the gene in which the resulting
product metabolises alcohol less efﬁciently. This
causes alcohol intolerance and affected indivi-
duals have mild, allergy-like syndromes on imbib-
ing alcohol. These people rarely develop alcohol
problems. Other variants of alcohol-metabolising
genes have been identiﬁed that are associated
with an increased risk of alcoholism.
Nicotine and tobacco
Nicotine induces either arousal or relaxation de-
pending on the dose and mood of the smoker.
Much of the pleasure of smoking derives from the
satisfaction of an intense physical and psycholog-
ical craving for nicotine.
Mechanism of action
Nicotine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
in the CNS and PNS. Dose-dependent activation or
desensitisation of these receptors in the cortex and
hippocampus are responsible for mental arousal
and relaxation, respectively. Nicotine’s action at
receptors on postsynaptic ganglion cells in the PNS
is responsible for its side effects of increased heart
rate and blood pressure.
Side-effects
. Nicotine and carbon monoxide increase the risk
of cardiovascular disease and stroke.
. Smoking
during
pregnancy
reduces
birth
weight.
. Tar in cigarettes increases the risk of lung, throat
and bladder cancer, and of bronchitis.
. Smoking reduces appetite and food intake: smo-
kers often put on weight when they try to give up
the habit.
Addiction and tolerance
Nicotine is highly addictive:
. Positive reinforcement comes from activation
of the dopamine mesolimbic system.
. Negative
reinforcement
results
from
mild
withdrawal
symptoms:
irritability,
impaired
psychomotor performance, insomnia, increased
aggression.
Some tolerance to the effects of nicotine devel-
ops in the CNS, although less than in the PNS.
Although smokers actually express an increased
number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, most
are probably in the desensitised state.
Psychomimetics
Psychomimetic drugs distort sensory perception.
These are a broad class and include potent hallu-
cinogens (e.g. lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD)
and mild hallucinogens (e.g. cannabis). Unlike
most recreational drugs, psychomimetics appear
to be only weakly addictive.
Cannabis
The active ingredient of cannabis is tetrahydro-
cannabinol (THC). Cannabis induces feelings of
relaxation and well-being and increases the inten-
sity of sensory stimuli.
Side-effects
In the short term, cannabis impairs memory, cog-
nition and motor performance. It also increases
heart rate, and causes dilatation of the blood ves-
sels and bronchi. It has been suggested that, in the
long term, it leads to schizophrenia as well as
apathy and underachievement.
Cannabis also has analgesic properties and there
have been some suggestions that it should be
licensed for the therapeutic management of chron-
ic pain syndromes and multiple sclerosis.
Mechanism of action
Cannabis inhibits depolarisation of neurons in
the
CNS.

endocannabinoid receptors (CB1) in the hippo-
campus, cerebellum, substantia nigra, mesolimbic
dopamine pathways and cortex. Activation of CB1
triggers a Gi protein second-messenger cascade to
decrease levels of intracellular cAMP. This causes
K þ channels to open and Ca2 þ channels to close,
hyperpolarising neurons and reducing neuro-
transmitter release.
Cannabis withdrawal symptoms
Cannabis causes mild withdrawal symptoms in
heavy users, including irritability, agitation, nau-
sea, increased heart rate and sweating.
Principles of motor
systems
The motor nervous system comprises neurons that
initiate and control activity in the muscular sys-
tem. Motor reﬂexes, coordinated gait and planned
motor sequences are examples of movements that
are regulated in different ways by the motor ner-
vous system.
Regulation of motor function
In voluntary motor function, or motor responses to
sensory input to the cortex, motor neurons at
higher levels exert hierarchical control over those
at lower levels. However, in reﬂex responses to a
peripheral sensory input, lower motor neurons
regulate movement independently.
The main components of the motor nervous
system and the hierarchical relationship between
them are brieﬂy delineated below:
. The supplementary motor area and premotor
cortex are involved in movement.
. The primary motor cortex receives input from
the supplementary area and premotor cortex.
The primary motor cortex is the main origin of
motor neurons that descend the spinal cord in
the descending motor tracts (often via subcorti-
cal nuclei), connecting the motor cortex with
lower motor neurons and interneurons.
. The basal ganglia enhance or suppress activity in
the motor cortex.
. The cerebellum compares activity in the motor
cortexwithsensorycuesastomotorperformance.
Itsends output back tothemotorcortex to correct
discrepancies between motor intention and mo-
tor
performance. When
performing
well-re-
hearsed motor skills, the cerebellum translates
motorintentioninthecortexintoaseriesofmotor
commands, which it transmits directly to the
descending motor tracts.
. Interneurons receive input from the descend-
ing motor tracts, in voluntary movement, and
from peripheral sensory neurons, in a motor
reﬂex. Interneurons are important in motor
reﬂexes, in relaying input from the descending
motor tracts to lower motor neurons and also
in gait.
. Lower motor neurons arise from motor nuclei in
the brain stem (cranial nerves) or ventral roots of
the spinal cord (spinal nerves) and directly in-
nervate muscles. They receive input from neu-
rons in the descending motor tracts, interneur-
ons and peripheral sensory neurons.
Functional units of the
motor nervous system
Motor units
Lower motor neurons innervate muscle ﬁbres.
They are directly responsible for the initiation of
DEFINITION Upper and lower motor
neurons
The motor neurons can be divided into two broad
groups that relate to their origin and target, and
affect the nature of lesions:
1 An upper motor neuron has a cell body in the
brain and an axon that extends into the spinal
cord, where it synapses. In upper motor neu-
ron lesions, reﬂexes are increased below the
level of the lesion. Spastic paralysis is also
present.
2 A lower motor neuron has a cell body in the
spinal cord or brain stem and an axon that ex-
tends outwards from the CNS to innervate an
effector muscle. In lower motor neuron lesions,
reﬂexes are reduced below the level of the lesion.
There is also muscle wasting and weakness.
Neuroscience 483

any type of movement. The group of muscle ﬁbres
that a single lower motor neuron innervates is
known as a motor unit. The number of muscle
ﬁbres that a lower motor neuron innervates varies
from around six to several thousand. Smaller mo-
tor units enable more precise movements.
The force of contraction of a muscle depends on
the following:
. The frequency of action potentials in the lower
motor neuron. A single action potential causes a
single contraction (twitch) in the muscle ﬁbres
that it innervates, whereas multiple action po-
tentials arriving in rapid succession cause sus-
tained contraction (fused tetanus).
. The number of lower motor neurons recruited
(spatial summation). In general, the sequence in
which motor neurons are recruited obeys the size
principle:
– Neurons with the smallest diameter are re-
cruited ﬁrst. They innervate type I muscle
ﬁbres which can generate low forces for long
periods of time, because of the efﬁciency with
which they perform aerobic respiration. This is
a slow twitch motor unit.
– Neurons
with
intermediate
diameter
are
recruited next. They innervate type IIa muscle
ﬁbres which can generate large forces but be-
come fatigued after about 5 min, because their
metabolism is mainly (but not entirely) anaer-
obic. This is a fatigue resistant motor unit.
– Neurons with the largest diameter are re-
cruited last. They innervate type IIb muscle
ﬁbres which can generate very large forces but
become fatigued after about 30 s, because their
metabolism is entirely anaerobic. This is a fast
fatigue motor unit.
Motor reﬂexes
In motor reﬂexes, lower motor neurons trigger
muscle contraction or relaxation, in response to
input from a peripheral sensory neuron. Unlike
voluntary movement, initiation of electrical activity
is independent of input from neurons in the des-
cending motor tracts. Motor reﬂexes have the ad-
vantage over voluntary movements of speed, which
can be a crucial factor in survival. There are two
important types of motor reﬂex, which are regulat-
ed independently to maintain muscle tension:
. The muscle spindle reﬂex acts to rapidly oppose
an increase in muscle length. It involves a
sensory afferent neuron that signals an increase
in muscle length and a motor efferent that elicits
muscle contraction. It is the only motor reﬂex in
which no interneurons are involved.
. The Golgi tendon organ reﬂex, which opposes
an increase in tension in the muscle.
The muscle spindle reﬂex and the Golgi tendon
organ reﬂex often have opposing effects. This in-
creases the tension in the muscle, so that the Golgi
tendon organ reﬂex opposes contraction.
The muscle spindle reﬂex
Sensing of muscle stretch
Muscle stretch is detected by the muscle spindle, a
4–10 mm ﬂuid-ﬁlled bag containing nuclear bag
ﬁbres and nuclear chain ﬁbres. Nuclear bag ﬁbres
are of two types: B1 and B2 ﬁbres. These two types
of nuclear bag ﬁbres, and nuclear chain ﬁbres, vary
according to the type of sensory neurons that
innervate them (Fig. 17.10).
. B1 ﬁbres are innervated at their centre by type Ia
sensory neurons and signal the rate of change in
the length of the ﬁbre. The centre of the B1 ﬁbre
undergoes only a transient increase in length
before contraction at its poles causes it to recoil
to its initial length.
. B2 ﬁbres are innervated not only by type Ia
sensory neurons but also by type II sensory
neurons. Type II sensory neurons are connected
to the poles of the ﬁbre. As the poles do not have
the elastic properties of the centres of the ﬁbre,
sensory neurons that innervate B2 ﬁbres signal
the steady length of the ﬁbre, as well as its rate of
change.
. Nuclear chain ﬁbres are innervated by type I and
type II sensory neurons. Nuclear chain ﬁbres
signal the steady length of the ﬁbre, as well as
its rate of change.
Innervation and reﬂex
Afferent sensory neurons from the muscle spin-
dles make an excitatory synapse in the ventral
horns of the spinal cord with the a-motor neuron
supplying the same muscle. Excitation of this mo-
tor neuron causes the muscle to contract.
The sensitivity of the muscle spindle ﬁbres is
optimised by the servo-assist function: g-motor
neurons innervate muscle spindle ﬁbres, causing
484
Neuroscience

them to shorten at the same time as a-motor
neurons cause the muscle itself to shorten.
Excitation of afferent sensory neurons from
muscle spindles not only triggers motor reﬂexes
but also contributes to ﬁne tuning of motor per-
formance and proprioception (awareness of joint
position), by sending branches to the cerebellum
and motor cortex and to the somatosensory cortex,
respectively.
CLINICAL Reﬂex testing
The myotactic stretch reﬂex is elicited clinically
(e.g. by striking the patellar tendon which causes
an increase in length in the muscle, quadriceps
femoris) to test for intact function of the motor
nervous system.
Golgi tendon organ reﬂex
Sensing of tension
Golgi tendon organs are arranged in series with the
collagen ﬁbres that connect a muscle to a tendon.
When muscle tension increases, collagen ﬁbres in
the Golgi tendon organ are stretched. This distorts
the terminals of type Ib sensory neurons, opening
cation channels and depolarising the sensory af-
ferent neuron.
Innervation and reﬂex
The Golgi tendon organ reﬂex involves a periph-
eral sensory neuron, a lower motor neuron and
one inhibitory interneuron. It opposes the effects
of the myotactic stretch reﬂex, to stimulate relax-
ation of the muscle. Type Ib afferent sensory
neurons synapse on an inhibitory interneuron in
the spinal cord which synapses with the a-motor
neurons innervating the same muscle. Excitation
of type Ib afferent sensory neurons dampens
activity in a-motor neurons and inhibits muscle
contraction.
Regulation of gait
The alternating ﬂexion and extension of opposite
limbs occurring in gait regulation is maintained
(although not initiated) by clusters of interneurons
acting as central pattern generators found in the
spinal cord. These clusters of interneurons operate
in ﬂexor and extensor half-centres (Fig. 17.11):
. Release of glutamate from a descending motor
neuron on to a ﬂexor half-centre causes rapid
depolarisation. This depolarisation is prolonged

by Ca2 þ ion inﬂux through NMDA channels. The
ﬁring of action potentials in the ﬂexor half centre
causes ﬂexor muscles to contract.
. Ca2 þ ions open Ca2 þ-dependent potassium
channels, so that the ﬂexor half-centre eventually
becomes hyperpolarised. This ends contraction
of ﬂexor muscles as well as removing excitatory
input to inhibitory interneurons, which prevent
depolarisation of the extensor half-centre.
. With this inhibition removed, the extensor half-
centre depolarises and the cycle is repeated.
Descending motor tracts
Descending motor tracts convey signals from the
motor cortex to motor neurons in the spinal cord.
Descending motor tracts may be categorised, ac-
cording to their relative position in the spinal cord
(see Fig. 17.8):
. Lateral spinal tracts carry signals related to vol-
untary movements. The corticospinal tract op-
erates when new movements are being learned
whereas the rubrospinal tract executes learned,
automated movements. Most ﬁbres in the lateral
spinal tracts cross the midline at the level of the
medulla and therefore innervate the contralat-
eral musculature.
. Ventromedial spinal tracts include the vestibu-
lospinal, reticulospinal and tectospinal tracts.
The vestibular and reticular nuclei and tectum,
from which these tracts originate, integrate ves-
tibular, proprioceptive and visual cues, indicating
a change in the centre of mass. These reﬂexes
include the vestibulocolic and cerviocolic reﬂexes
which keep the head upright and the vestibulosp-
inal and cervicospinal reﬂexes which activate
muscles in the limbs that oppose the force of
gravity, so as to prevent, or brace against, a fall.
Motor cortex
The primary motor cortex is responsible for trans-
mitting motor commands from the brain to the
muscles. There is somatotopic mapping in the
arrangement of neurons descending from M1.
Neurons that transmit motor output to muscles
in upper body regions originate inferiorly, whereas
neurons that transmit motor output to lower body
regions originate superiorly. The area of motor
cortex that is involved in motor control of a par-
ticular body region is proportional to the density of

Neuroscience

that region’s innervation by motor neurons. How-
ever, rather than a one-to-one relationship be-
tween activity in a particular cortical motor neuron
and contraction of a speciﬁc muscle, electrical
activity in an array of cortical motor neurons is
thought to encode the force, velocity and direction
of a movement.
M1 also receives sensory input from cortical
sensory areas and the cortical branch of the
muscle spindle stretch afferents. As sensory input
corresponding to a particular part of the body is
aligned with motor output to the same area in M1,
motor function can be adjusted according to sen-
sorystimulithatindicatejointpositionand posture.
Secondary motor cortex
The secondary motor cortex comprises the pre-
motor cortex and the supplementary motor area. It
is involved in planning complex movements and
has both an indirect motor output via M1 and a
direct output to the corticospinal tract. The sup-
plementary area is particularly important in move-
ment involving both sides of the body because it
has a bilateral somatotopic representation (each
hemisphere of the supplementary area exerts mo-
tor control over musculature on both sides of the
body).
Cerebellum
The cerebellum regulates and reﬁnes movement. It
can operate in two different ways:
1 In feedback mode, the cerebellum coordinates
movement and corrects errors in motor func-
tion. The cerebellum computes a mismatch be-
tween motor intention, relayed from the motor
cortex, and motor performance, relayed from
peripheral sensory neurons, and sends out in-
hibitory output, which terminates the move-
ment, accordingly.
2 In feed-forward mode, the cerebellum trans-
lates motor intention, relayed from the cortex,
into a series of motor commands. A form of
motor learning, long-term depression, enables
the cerebellum to function in this way.
Functional subdivisions of the
cerebellum
The precise arrangement of cerebellar cortical
output to the deep cerebellar nuclei, and of cere-
bellar cortical input from parallel and climbing
ﬁbres, means that functional subdivisions of the
cerebellum may be distinguished. The different
regions of the cerebellar cortex send their output
via deep nuclei. From medial to lateral, the names
of these deep nuclei are: fastigial, globose, emboli-
form and dentate. The circuitry that connects the
cerebellar cortical neurons and deep nuclei is re-
peated over the entire area of the cerebellar cortex.
(Fig. 17.12)
Vestibulocerebellum
The vestibulocerebellum comprises the ﬂocculo-
nodular lobe, receives input from the vestibuloco-
chlear nerve and sends output to the vestibular
nuclei. It is involved in the maintenance of postural
balance and in the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex. In the
latter, the eyes move in an equal and opposite
direction to the movement of the head.
Spinocerebellum
The spinocerebellum is divided into medial and
intermediate areas. The medial area (consisting of
the anterior lobe and the medial region of the
posterior lobe) is important in maintaining pos-
ture. It receives input from the dorsal spinocere-
bellar tracts and sends output to the fastigial nu-
clei, which project to the medioventral descending
motor tracts, involved in the control of axial
musculature.
The
intermediate
area
(consisting
of
the
intermediate portion of the posterior lobe) is im-
portant in peripheral muscle control and ﬁne mo-
tor movements. It receives input from the dorsal
and ventral spinocerebellar tracts, as well as from
the somatosensory and motor cortices via the
corticopontine cerebellar tract, and sends output
to the interpositus nuclei (subdivided into the
globose and emboliform in humans). The inter-
positus nuclei send output, via the red nucleus and
ventrolateral thalamus, to the lateral descending
motor tracts, involved in the control of peripheral
musculature.
Cerebrocerebellum
The
cerebrocerebellum
coordinates
complex
movements. It is made up of the lateral region of
the posterior lobe and receives input, via the cor-
ticopontine cerebellar tract, from multiple areas of
cortex. It sends output via the dentate nucleus and
ventrobasal thalamus, to the motor and prefrontal
cortices.
Neuroscience 487

CLINICAL Lesions in the cerebellum
The effect of a lesion depends on its location:
. Lesions to the vestibulocerebellum cause a
staggering gait and nystagmus (jerky eye move-
ments) to the side of the lesion.
. Lesions to the medial spinocerebellum cause
the individual to fall to the side of the lesion.
. Lesions to the lateral spinocerebellum result in
intention tremor – large amplitude tremor in the
limbs when reaching out for an object.
. Lesions to the cerebrocerebellum cause over-
shooting of movements involving single joints
and gross impairments in multijointed move-
ments, e.g. manipulations with the ﬁngers.
Cerebellar circuitry
The cerebellum has a very large number of cortical
neurons (about 11 million). These cortical neurons
are of different types: Purkinje cells, granule cells,
basket and stellate cells, and Golgi cells.
Purkinje cells
Purkinje neurons send inhibitory GABA-ergic out-
put to the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei,
which relay excitatory output from the cerebellum.
Purkinje cells receive input from two types of
ﬁbres:

and make excitatory synapses with 2000–3000

ﬁbre. This inhibits output by the purkinje ﬁbress to the deep cerebellar nucleus, and is modulation and reﬁnement of
the movement programme.
488
Neuroscience

However, each Purkinje neuron has only one
synapse with each parallel ﬁbre. Input from the
parallel ﬁbre elicits a simple action potential
spike in the Purkinje neuron.
2 Climbing ﬁbres wind around Purkinje neurons,
making multiple excitatory synapses, in contrast
withparallelﬁbres.Inputfromtheclimbingﬁbre
elicits a complex action potential spike in the
Purkinje neuron. Climbing ﬁbres originate from
the inferior olive in the midbrain.
Granule cells
The granule cells account for around half the cells
in the CNS. These excitatory cells give off parallel
ﬁbres that form excitatory synapses with many
Purkinje cells. The granules cells are themselves
innervated by mossy ﬁbres that reach the cerebel-
lum in:
. corticopontine cerebellar tracts which project
from the cortex, via the pontine nuclei
. dorsal spinocerebellar tracts which relay pro-
prioceptive input (information about joint posi-
tion) from spindle ﬁbres and Golgi tendon organs
. ventral spinocerebellar tracts which relay sen-
sory input from interneurons involved in gait.
Cerebellar inhibitory interneurons: basket,
stellate and golgi cells
The three remaining classes of neuron in the cer-
ebellum are inhibitory in nature:
. Basket and stellate cells are responsible for lat-
eral inhibition between adjacent Purkinje cells.
They receive input from parallel ﬁbres and send
inhibitory output to neighbouring Purkinje cells.
As a single parallel ﬁbre activates multiple Pur-
kinje neurons, this focuses the cerebellar cortex
output.
. Golgi cells terminate the generation of simple
spikes in Purkinje cells after a period of time, so
that Purkinje cells ﬁre only for a brief duration.
They receive input from parallel ﬁbres and send
inhibitory output back to granule cells.
Long-term depression
The cerebellum is responsible for improvement in
the performance of a motor skill that comes from
practice. Long-term depression (LTD) of parallel
ﬁbre activation of Purkinje cells is the mechanism
underpinning this capacity of the cerebellum.
LTD is caused by simultaneous input from par-
allel ﬁbres, which relay motor intention from the
cortex and climbing ﬁbres; this transmits error
signals from the inferior olive. It reduces Purkinje
cell inhibitory output to the deep cerebellar nuclei,
enhancing excitatory output from these nuclei,
which increases cerebellar regulation of the motor
system and allows it to act in feed-forward mode,
programming a sequence of movements.
The process of LTD correlates with improve-
ments in motor function: when a new motor skill
is ﬁrst being learnt, a large number of errors are
made and activity in climbing ﬁbres is high. Even-
tually, when motor performance is perfected, ac-
tivity in the climbing ﬁbres falls to baseline. This
implies that parallel ﬁbre input to these Purkinje
cells has been suppressed in the long term.
Molecular basis of LTD
The molecular processes underlying LTD occur as
a series of continuous steps:
. Simultaneous inputs from climbing and paral-
lel ﬁbres of a single Purkinje cell result in
depolarisation.
. Activation of glutamate AMPA channels and G-
protein-coupled receptors (coupled with depo-
larisation of the cell membrane), in the Purkinje
cell, triggers the opening of P-type voltage-gated
calcium channels.
. Ca2 þinﬂux induces the synthesis of protein ki-
nase C, which phosphorylates AMPA receptors,
desensitising them. This reduces subsequent de-
polarisation of Purkinje cells in response to glu-
tamate release by parallel ﬁbres (Fig. 17.13).
Repeated activation of this process leads to pro-
gressive increase in LTD and progressive reﬁne-
ment of the motor procedures.
Basal ganglia
The basal ganglia comprise various subcortical
structures that form a closed loop with each other
and with the motor cortex via the thalamus (the
basal ganglia–thalamocortical loop). The basal
ganglia facilitate intended movements and sup-
press unintended movements.
Components and circuitry of the

ganglia, their connections and inﬂuences over

basal
ganglia–
thalamocortical loops which is outlined in the next
section (Fig. 17.14).
Caudate and putamen
The caudate and putamen make up a function-
ally coherent unit, the dorsal striatum. Medium
spiny neurons in the dorsal striatum receive
excitatory, glutamergic input from cortical neu-
rons. All medium spiny neurons have a GABA-
ergic, inhibitory output. However, two subgroups
of medium spiny neurons may be distinguished
according to their co-transmitters and their do-
pamine receptors:
. One type has D1-receptors, through which do-
pamine exerts an excitatory effect (D1-spiny neu-
rons), and use substance P and dynorphin as co-
transmitters.
. The other type has D2-receptors, through
which
dopamine
exerts
a
negative
effect
(D2-spiny neurons), and use enkephalin as a
co-transmitter.
Globus pallidus pars interna
The globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) receives
inhibitory GABA-ergic input from D1 neurons
and an excitatory, glutamergic input from the
subthalamic nucleus (STN). The GPi sends an
inhibitory GABA-ergic output to the cortex via the
thalamus.
Globus pallidus pars externa
The globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) receives
inhibitory, GABA-ergic input from D2 neurons
and sends an inhibitory GABA-ergic output to
the STN.
Subthalamic nucleus
The STN receives inhibitory GABA-ergic input
from the GPe and an excitatory input from the
motor cortex. It also sends an excitatory, glutamer-
gic output to the GPi and substantia nigra pars
reticulata (SNpr).
Substantia nigra pars reticulata
The SNpr has a very similar role to the GPi, receiv-
ing inhibitory input from D1-spiny neurons of the
dorsal striatum, and excitatory input from the STN.
It sends inhibitory output to the cortex, via the
thalamus.

Substantia nigra pars compacta
The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) re-
ceives a glutamergic input from the prefrontal
cortex and limbic system.
SNpc sends a dopaminergic output to the

tion of D1-medium spiny neurons but sup-
presses cortical activation of D2-medium spiny
neurons.

of the dorsal striatum. This enhances D1 neuron
GABA-ergic inhibitory output to the GPi and SNpr,
which in turn reduces GABA-mediated inhibition
of the cortex by GPi and SNpr. This increases
activity in the motor cortex.
The indirect pathway suppresses
motor activity
The cortex sends excitatory input to the D2 neu-
rons. This increases D2 neuron GABA-ergic inhib-
itory input to the GPe, so decreasing GPe GABA-
ergic inhibitory output to the STN, which in turn
increases STN glutamergic excitatory output to the
GPi and SNpr. This enhances inhibition of the
cortex by GPi and SNpr.

Eye movements
Eye movements are of two main types:
1 Gaze stabilisation (e.g. the vestibulo-ocular
reﬂex): the eyes remain ﬁxed on an object when
the head is rotated.
2 Gaze shifting (e.g. saccadic movements): the
gaze shifts to bring new objects on to the fovea,
or to track a moving object.
Pathways involved in eye
movement control
Movement of the eyesis controlled by three pairs of
extraocular muscles:
1 The medial and lateral rectus
2 The superior and inferior rectus
3 The superior and inferior.
These extraocular muscles are innervated by
motor neurons that emerge from the motor nuclei
of the oculomotor (III), trochlea (IV) and abducens
(VI) cranial nerves. Action potentials in the motor
neurons encode both the speed at which the gaze is
shifted and the static position of the eyes.
The motor nuclei receive input from neurons
originating from the reticular and vestibular nu-
clei. Connection of the vestibular nuclei and the
reticular nuclei on either side by the medial lon-
gitudinal fasiculus allows the two eyes to move in
parallel (conjugate gaze).
The vestibular and reticular nuclei receive input
from the cerebellum, the frontal eye ﬁelds (an area
of cortex in front of the premotor cortex) and the
superior colliculus.
CLINICAL Huntington's disease
Huntington’s
disease
is
an
example
of
a
hyperkinesia. It is characterised by random
twitch-like or writhing movements (choreoatheto-
sis). Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative,
genetic disorder, caused by a mutation in a pro-
tein, Huntington. The function of this protein is
unknown, but, in its mutated form, it is deposited
in the nuclei of D2-dorsal striatum medium spiny
neurons, killing these cells. As a consequence,
activity in the indirect pathway, which acts to block
inappropriate movements, is reduced. At present
treatment is symptomatic.
CLINICAL Parkinson's disease
Parkinson’sdiseaseisanexampleofa hypokinesia.
It is characterised by a triad of:
. Bradykinesia: difﬁculty in initiating movement;
slow, shufﬂing gait with hunched posture and loss
of arm swinging; difﬁculty in changing position;
mask-like expression and slow, quiet speech.
. Rigidity: constant throughout range of move-
ment – known as lead-pipe rigidity in contrast with
clasp-knife rigidity caused by lesions of the py-
ramidal tract when the rigidity suddenly ceases.
. Rest tremor: usually in the hands (pill rolling) but
sometimes alsointhe limbs,face,jaworlips(notin
the head and neck).
Cause
Parkinson’s disease is caused by degradation of
the dopaminergic neurons of the SNpc, indicated
histologically by the inclusion of Lewy bodies
(deposits of abnormally folded protein, a-synu-
clein, tagged with ubiquitin). This degradation is
usually age related and idiopathic, but may result
from anti-dopaminergic medication used to treat
schizophrenia, head trauma resulting in injury to
the midbrain or because of a genetic mutation in
a-synuclein. Degradation of the dopaminergic
neurons of the SNpc suppresses activity in the
direct pathway, which allows movement, and
enhances activity in the indirect pathway, which
inhibits movement.
Treatment
A variety of treatments have been investigated for
parkinsonism:
. L-Dopa, a dopamine precursor, is given to con-
trol the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. L-Dopa
crosses the blood–brain barrier where it is taken
up by the remaining dopaminergic neurons and
converted to dopamine. Although L-dopa relieves
symptoms in the short term, it typically causes
motor ﬂuctuations, e.g. abnormal writhing move-
ments (tardive dsykinesia) and rigid muscle
spasm (dystonias) after a period of 2–5 years.
. Alternative
pharmacological
treatments
in-
clude
dopamine
agonists
and
monoamine
oxidase
inhibitors,

catabolism.
. Surgical treatments have been introduced more
recently, with limited success. Human fetal dopa-
minergic cells can be grafted. Lesioning of the
globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus or ventro-
lateral thalamus reduces tremor but not rigidity or
bradykinesia.

Neuroscience

Vestibulo-ocular reﬂex
The vestibulo-ocular reﬂex moves the eyes in the
opposite direction when the head is rotated. Ro-
tation of the head is detected by the semicircular
canals of the inner ear, part of the vestibular sys-
tem. This depolarises the vestibular nerve, causing
it to send excitatory output to the vestibular nuclei.
This action triggers eye movement in the opposite
direction to that of head rotation. A connection of
this reﬂex pathway with the cerebellum allows
movement of the eyes to be exactly matched in
magnitude (although in the opposite direction) to
that of the head.
Optokinetic reﬂex
Movement of the eyes is triggered by the image
‘slipping’ on the retina. The magnitude of eye
movement is equal and opposite to that of the
head. The optokinetic reﬂex occurs in response to
slower head rotations to those that trigger the
vestibulo-ocular reﬂex. Slipping of the image on
the retina is detected by large, movement-sensi-
tive, retinal ganglion cells.
Saccades
Saccades are biphasic movements with a slow
phase, which stabilises the retinal image, and a
quick phase that resets it. By convention, the di-
rection of the saccade is determined by the direc-
tion of the quick phase of the movement. Saccades
may be reﬂex or voluntary:
. Reﬂex saccades are initiated by the superior
colliculus. The superior colliculus has three
layers: the superior layer receives a visual input;
the deep layer receives an auditory and somato-
sensory input; and the intermediate layer sends a
motor output to the reticular and vestibular nu-
clei. Somatotopic mapping in the three layers is
in register, so that reﬂex saccades are oriented in
the direction of sensory stimuli.
. Voluntary saccades are initiated by the frontal
eye ﬁeld area of the cortex. This area sends
output to the reticular and vestibular nuclei, via
the basal ganglia or the superior colliculus, and
receives input from the posterior parietal cortex
which integrates sensory information.
Smooth pursuit movements
Smooth pursuit movements are voluntary eye
movements that allow tracking of an object mov-
ing across a limited area of the visual ﬁeld. Smooth
pursuit is initiated by detection of retinal slip in the
primary visual cortex, as in the optokinetic reﬂex.
Vergence
Vergence allows for refocusing as an object moves
closer or further away. Unlike in other eye move-
ments, in vergence the two eyes move in opposite
directions. Vergence is triggered by the perception
of retinal blurring in the primary visual cortex due
to a high degree of retinal disparity (the object is
focused on very different parts of the retinas of the
two eyes).
Sensory pathways
Sensory pathways are composed of a series of
neurons that extend from the periphery to the
cortex. Sensory pathways allow awareness and
exploration of the external environment.
Sensory receptor transduction
Sensory receptors convert (transduce) a chemical,
mechanical or thermal stimulus into an action
potential. A sensory receptor may be the modiﬁed
ending of the primary afferent neuron (somato-
sensory systems) or a specialised cell (all other
systems). All sensory receptors can be described
in terms of four properties:
. Speciﬁcity as to the type of stimulus that they will
transduce into an electrical signal. Transduction
occurs either by directly causing ion channels
to open (e.g. somatosensation) or by triggering a
G-protein-coupled, second-messenger cascade
(e.g. vision), leading to a change in electrical
potential across the receptor membrane. Noci-
ceptors are an exception, responding to several
different forms of stimuli.
. The receptive ﬁeld refers to the restricted area
where the receptor is responsive to its stimulus.
. The threshold level is the level that a stimulus
must exceed to trigger transduction into a
nervous signal. This determines the sensitivity
of the sensory receptor.
. Encoding of sensory information by either spa-
tial or temporal coding.
Encoding of different properties of
a sensory stimulus
Afferent neurons synapse to speciﬁc cells in the
primary sensory cortex in a precise manner. This
Neuroscience 493

gives rise to a ‘map’ of the stimulus, which encodes
gradations in anatomical site or other attributes
of the stimulus, e.g. the frequency of a sound.
Different receptors are specialised to detect differ-
ent aspects of a stimulus:
. Rapidly adapting receptors respond to changes
in the intensity of stimulus input, but not to a
continually applied stimulus. The frequency at
which action potentials occur in the primary
afferent neuron of a rapidly adapting receptor is
therefore proportional to the intensity of the
change in stimulus
. Slowly
adapting
receptors
are
responsive
throughout the duration of a constantly applied
stimulus. The rate of conduction of electrical
impulses in a primary afferent neuron, which is
associated with a slowly adapting receptor, is
proportional to the intensity of the stimulus itself
(temporary summation) and through recruit-
ment of a greater number of sensory receptors
(spatial summation).
Conduction from the periphery to
the cerebral cortex
The signal generated by a sensory receptor is
transmitted along a series of peripheral and central
neurons, via the thalamus, to a specialised region
of cerebral cortex (except in the olfactory pathway,
which is not directed via the thalamus).
In general, central neurons have larger receptive
ﬁelds because of the convergence of inputs from
multiple peripheral neurons. Their receptive ﬁelds
are also often more complex because they receive
both stimulatory and inhibitory inputs, allowing
lateral inhibition.
DEFINITION Lateral inhibition
A stimulus applied to the centre of the receptiveﬁeld
of a central neuron is excitatory to the central neu-
ron, but the same stimulus applied to the periphery
(surround) is inhibitory. This is because peripheral
neurons that correspond anatomically to the sur-
round of the receptive ﬁeld of a central neuron are
inhibited by the stimulus, whereas peripheral neu-
rons that correspond anatomicallyto the centre area
of the receptive ﬁeld are excited. Lateral inhibition
permits more precise localisation (spatial resolu-
tion) of the stimulus
Areas of cerebral cortex receiving input from
sensory neurons, primary sensory cortex, send
out neuronal projections to secondary sensory
cortex, which performs further sensory process-
ing. Neurons from secondary sensory cortex proj-
ect to association cortex, which integrates infor-
mation about different sensory systems. In turn,
association cortex sends out neural projects to the
motor or limbic systems, which are responsible
for the initiation of a response to a sensory
stimulus.
Touch
Touch perception is the detection of contact with
non-noxious stimuli. This permits grasping and
tactile recognition of objects. It also facilitates
limb-placing
reactions
that
maintain
posture
(placing of the feet on a stable surface).
Stimulus
The stimulus input is deformation of the skin as an
object exerts pressure on it.
Receptors
Touch receptors are the specialised endings of
rapidly conducting, large-diameter, myelinated
(Aa and Ab), primary afferent neurons. Distin-
guishing two closely applied mechanical stimuli
when they are applied to areas of skin requires
touch receptors between the two points to be
unstimulated – otherwise, it is impossible to dis-
tinguish two discrete stimuli from a single stimulus
over a wide area. A high density of receptors in the
ﬁngertips and lips increases the accuracy of stim-
ulus location and thus increases acuity.
Touch receptors vary according to their mor-
phology, distribution, size of their receptive ﬁeld
and their adaptation properties:
. Meissner’s corpuscles are located in superﬁcial
layers of skin and have small receptive ﬁelds.
They are rapidly adapting, sensitive only to
changes in skin displacement. Therefore, the
rate of electrical conduction in the primary af-
ferent neuron encodes the velocity of skin
displacement.
. Pacinian corpuscles are located in deep layers of
skin and have large receptive ﬁelds and adapt
extremely rapidly. The force applied to a paci-
nian corpuscle is rapidly dissipated by surround-
ing concentric layers of connective tissue that
494
Neuroscience

slide over each other. As a result, the rate of
electrical conduction in the secondary afferent
neuron
encodes
the
acceleration
of
skin
displacement
. Rufﬁni endings are also located in the deep
layers of the skin, with large receptive ﬁelds. They
adapt slowly and are sensitive throughout the
duration of an applied stimulus. This means that
the rate of electrical conduction in the primary
afferent neuron is proportional to the extent of
indentation of overlying skin.
. Merkel’s discs are superﬁcially situated, at the
boundary of the epidermis and dermis. They
have small receptive ﬁelds with well-deﬁned
boundaries and adapt slowly, allowing detection
of changes in pressure and low vibrations.
Pathway
The touch perception pathway consists of a relay of
three neurons, from periphery to cortex:
1 Primary afferent axons enter the spinal cord via
the dorsal root, synapsing with interneurons and
sending off branches that ascend in the dorsal
columns of the spinal cord.
2 Secondary afferent axons project from the
dorsal column nuclei to the ventroposterior
nucleus (VPN) of the thalamus, decussating in
the medial lemniscus. They are joined by ﬁbres
from the trigeminal sensory nerve,which detects
touch sensation in the face.
3 Tertiary afferent neurons project from the VPN
of the thalamus to the primary somatosensory
cortex (S1).
S1 has somatotopic mapping in the form of an
inverted homunculus. Lower body regions are re-
presented superiorly and upper body regions in-
feriorly. The area of cortex corresponding to a
particular body region is proportional to its density
of receptors. S1 sends neuronal projections to
secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), which is
important in tactile recognition of objects.
CLINICAL Lesions of somatosensory
cortex
Lesions of the primary somatosensory cortex cause
a loss of touch sensation down the contralateral side
of the body, because of the decussation of second-
ary afferent neurons.
Pain
Pain is an unpleasant emotional experience relat-
ing to actual/potential tissue damage. A speciﬁc
type of chronic pain, neuropathic pain, is caused
by nerve damage. Pain has an objective, sensory
component
(nociception)
and
a
subjective,
affective component. The former is much easier
to test experimentally and therefore more is known
about it.
DEFINITION Nociception and pain
Nociception and pain are closely related terms that
describe aspects of damage to the body:
. Nociception is the physiological processing and
sensation of a noxious stimulus
. Pain is the sensory and emotive feelings associ-
ated with potential or actual tissue damage.
Stimulus
There are various stimulus inputs for pain percep-
tion: high pressures, high temperatures (above
approximately 42C) and noxious chemicals. Med-
iators of inﬂammation, such as histamine, brady-
kinin and prostaglandins, are chemical mediators
of nociception that can modulate the effects of the
other stimuli, causing hyperalgesia.
Receptors
Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present in the
skin, endothelium, viscera, skeletal and cardiac
muscle, and all tissues except neural tissues. Dif-
ferent nociceptor types respond to different pain
input stimuli:
. The termini of relatively rapidly conducting
(10–45 m/s),
large-diameter,
myelinated
Ad-
ﬁbres respond to intense pressures. They have
small receptive ﬁelds and high thresholds.
Activation of these receptors gives rise to the
sensation of sharp, well-localised pain.
. The termini of smaller, unmyelinated, slow-
conducting (<2 m/s) C-ﬁbres detect pressure,
temperatures >42C and noxious chemicals.
They have large receptive ﬁelds. Activation of
these nociceptors gives rise to the sensation of
poorly localised, burning pain.
Neuroscience 495

CLINICAL Referred pain
Pain signals from the viscera are transmitted via
myelinated and unmyelinated autonomic nerve ﬁ-
bres that project to the dorsal horns of the spinal
cord at the level corresponding to their origin in
embryological development. As a result of the con-
vergence of visceral and cutaneous nociceptor
afferents on the dorsal horn cells, pain from the
viscera may be referred to the skin.
Many painful stimuli are sensed by the capsaicin
receptor, which is the best-understood nociceptor.
This cation channel triggers depolarisation of the
cell membrane when it is activated, in response to
many different stimuli:
. Mechanical deformation
. Heat (>42C)
. Acidic conditions
. Capsaicin, the active ingredient in chilli peppers.
There are many other channels that respond to
painful stimuli (and have been implicated in no-
ciception), and there are also receptors to other
stimuli (such as inﬂammatory mediators) that can
modulate a ﬁbre’s response to painful stimuli.
Gate mechanism
Pain perception may be reduced by the dorsal horn
gate mechanism. Concurrent activity in large-
diameter Aa and Ab primary afferents of the touch
pathway reduces transmission of electrical signals
in secondary afferent neurons in the nociceptive
pathway. This is because these large-diameter
primary afferents activate interneurons in the
substantia gelatinosa, which inhibit secondary
afferents in the pain pathway.
Nociception transmission pathways
Primary afferent axons project to Rexed’s laminae I
and II (see Fig. 17.8a). There, they synapse with
secondary afferent neurons that decussate several
segments above their level of origin, passing ven-
tral to the spinal cord before ascending the spinal
cord in the spinothalamic, spinoreticulothalamic
and spinomesencephalic tracts:
. The spinothalamic tract is involved in precise
pain localisation. It projects to the ventroposter-
olateral thalamus. From here, tertiary neurons
extend to multiple regions of the cortex, including
the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex.
. The spinoreticulothalamic tract is involved
in the affective components of pain. It projects
via the reticular system of the medulla and pons
to the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and from
there to the anterior cingulate cortex of the lim-
bic system.
. The spinomesencephalic tract projects to the
periaqueductal grey area (PAG). Activation of the
spinomesencephalic tract reduces pain percep-
tion because the PAG activates inhibitory des-
cending neurons that originate from the raphe
nucleus and locus ceruleus. These descending
neurons synapse on ascending secondary affer-
ent neurons and decrease their transmission by
releasing the inhibitory neurotransmitters, sero-
tonin, noradrenaline and enkephalin.
CLINICAL Primary and secondary
hyperalgesia
Hyperalgesia is enhanced perception of a pain
stimulus:
. Primary hyperalgesia occurs when inﬂammatory
mediators increase the sensitivity of nociceptors
to other noxious stimuli.
. Secondary hyperalgesia occurs in chronic pain
syndromes (sustained and severe pain). It is due
to enhanced synaptic transmission between pri-
mary and secondary afferent neurons in the pain
pathway, as a result of long-term potentiation (see
‘Higher cognitive functions’ below).
Endorphins and enkephalins
In times of stress or activity, the body can stimu-
lates the periaqeductal grey. This region of the
brain has ﬁbres that release enkephalin which
binds to the presynaptic membrane of nociceptive
ﬁbres. The action of the enkephalin inhibits trans-
mission in the postsynaptic pain ﬁbre, and limits
the body’s response to pain, as in emergency
analgesia; the presence of opioid receptors on the
pain ﬁbres accounts for the potent action of opi-
ates as analgesics. The release of endorphins that

Neuroscience

occurs during exercise also acts on the pleasure
centres in the brain and is responsible for the ‘high’
experienced during exercise.
Neuropathic pain
Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to a nerve
rather than to tissues. Peripheral nerves are com-
monly damaged as they cross bony protuberances.
Traumatic damage to nerves can result from:
. complete or partial section of the nerve
. neuroma formation
. involvement of the sympathetic nervous system,
as occurs in regional pain syndrome.
The following are common sites at which neu-
ropathic pain occurs:
. Median nerve passing under the carpal tunnel
. Ulnar nerve as it passes behind the olecranon
process of the ulna
. Common peroneal nerve as it winds around the
head of the ﬁbula
. Compression of nerve roots emerging from the
spinal cord by bony spurs on the vertebrae or by
prolapsed intervertebral discs.
CLINICAL Phantom pain
Phantom pain is a form of neuropathic pain per-
ceived in a region of the body that no longer has
sensory innervation. This is due to the loss of afferent
input, or enhanced input from the remaining affer-
ents, to the spinal cord and sensory cortex, as a
result of limb or organ amputation or traumatic avul-
sion of the dorsal roots from the spinal cord. It can be
explained by the fact that cortical neurons receiving
pain signals from other parts of the body are rewired
to the region that has lost its afferent input.
CLINICAL Complex regional pain
syndrome
This chronic condition is characterised by severe
pain and swelling and changes to the skin. The
syndrome is often associated with nerve damage.
The mechanisms causing the syndrome are not
clear but there is thought to be a contribution from
‘physiological wind-up’. This system involves sen-
sitisation of the NMDA receptors on CNS neurons in
response to stimuli, including trauma, activation of
the sympathetic nervous system and inﬂammation.
Pain management
Pain perception (Fig. 17.15) can be reduced by
interference at multiple levels of the nociceptive
conduction pathway:
. Pharmacological suppressors of local inﬂam-
matory mediators reduce activation of C-ﬁbres
and prevent primary hyperalgesia. These include
antihistamines, which block the binding of his-
tamine to its receptors on C-ﬁbres, and cycloox-
ygenase inhibitors, which inhibit the synthesis of
prostaglandins.
. Local anaesthetics (e.g. lidocaine) inhibit con-
duction in primary afferents by blocking voltage-
gated sodium channels.
. Opioid analgesics (e.g. morphine) reduce syn-
aptic transmission from primary to secondary
afferents of the pain pathway in the dorsal horn,
by hyperpolarising the neuronal membrane and
reducing neurotransmitter release. The analgesic
effect of opioids may also be mediated by an
action on the frontal cortex, which modulates the
affective component of pain.
. Stimulation of the PAG produces analgesia by
activating descending inhibitory pathways.
. Selective
stimulation
of
large
diameter
primary afferents in the touch pathway, by
transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS),
reduces transmission in secondary afferents
in the pain pathway via the gate mechanism.
Proprioception
To allow the effective balance and movement of
the body, the brain must be aware of the position
and orientation of the skeleton. This is known as
proprioception and is achieved through many
different sensory processes. Posture and joint po-
sition are signalled by:
. the vestibular system which detects a change in
head position
. the touch pathway which detects contact of the
feet with a stable surface
. muscle spindle ﬁbres and Golgi tendon organs
in muscles, which detect muscle stretch and
muscle, tension respectively.
All of these systems send inputs to the motor
nervous system, allowing adjustment of posture to
prevent, or brace against, a fall. The physiological
importance of the system is highlighted by the
rapidly conducting ﬁbres that conduct impulses
to the CNS. The feedback of this system is rapidly
Neuroscience 497

relayed to the motor parts of the brain to allow
rapid reﬁnement of movement, which is reﬂected
in the large size of the proprioceptive ﬁbres, en-
suring rapid nervous conduction.
Vision
Vision allows perception of colour, form and move-
ment of objects in the environment. This facilitates
object recognition and directional movement.
Sensory stimulus
The sensory stimulus for vision is light reﬂected off
objects in the environment and focused on to the
retina of the eye.
Visual receptors
Light is transduced into an electrical signal
by rod and cone cells in the retina. They contain
a photopigment substance that allows them to
absorb
light.

Neuroscience

CLINICAL Visual impairment of non-
neural origin
Over-refraction of light waves by an excessively
convex lens causes myopia, an inability to see dis-
tant objects. Under-refraction of light waves by an
insufﬁciently convex lens causes hypermetropia, an
inability to see close objects. Hypermetropia is com-
mon in old age, when the lens becomes less elastic.
An imperfection in the convex surface of the lens
causes astigmatism, a distortion of part of the image.
Opacity of the lens, a cataract, impairs the quality
of vision. In sunny countries, this is commonly
caused by the absorption of UV light.
Cellular structure of the retina
Within the retina itself, light must pass through
several layers of cells (Fig. 17.17). In sequential
order, these include:
. optic ganglion cells
. amacrine cells
. bipolar and horizontal cells
. the rods and cones, which detect light.
Properties of rods and cones
Rods and cones have an outer region in which the
plasma membrane is invaginated into discs, which
contain the photopigment protein, and an inner
region, which contains the nucleus and mitochon-
dria and terminates in a synaptic process The rods
and cones are located behind the neurons of the
retina. As a result there is some distortion of the
image as the light passes through the cells – this
distortion is corrected for within the visual cortex.
The photopigment of rods and cones differs and
has different sensitivities to light.
. Rhodopsin, the photopigment in rods, contains
a prosthetic group, retinal, derived from vitamin
A in the diet by the enzyme retinol dehydro-
genase.
. Opsin, the photopigment in cones, is of three
types. Each opsin optimally absorbs light of a

different wavelength. This allows colour vision as
the brain compares input from three types of
cone cell.
CLINICAL Colour blindness
Mutation in a gene encoding one or more cone
opsins causes colour blindness. Red–green colour
blindness, in which the person cannot distinguish
red from green and either from grey, is most
common, particularly in men because the mutation
is X-linked and recessive.
CLINICAL Vitamin A deﬁciency and
night blindness
Retinal is derived from vitamin A, which is obtained
in the diet, by the enzyme retinol dehydrogenase.
Vitamin A deﬁciency may therefore result in night
blindness.
There are about 20-fold more rods than cones,
although they have different distributions:
. Rods are uniformlydistributedacrosstheretina.
They are much more sensitive to low-intensity
lights than cones because they show spatial sum-
mation (input from multiple rods converges on to
a single retinal ganglion cell) and temporal sum-
mation (electrical signals are integrated over
about 100 ms). However, this reduces visual.
. Cones are clustered in a small area of the retina,
known as the fovea. Clustering of cones means
that there is high visual acuity for visual images
that fall on the fovea.
Phototransduction
In the dark, calcium and sodium ion inﬂux occurs
through cGMP-controlled cation channels, depo-
larising photoreceptors to about  40 mV. The
opposite is true in the light when photoreceptors
hyperpolarise. The molecular mechanism of hy-
perpolarisation of photoreceptors in the light is
described below (Fig. 17.18):

. Adsorption of photons isomerises the pigment,
rhodopsin, in rod cells or iodopsin in cone cells to
an un unstable intermediate
. This unstable intermediate binds a GTP-bound
protein, transducin.
. The GTP-bound a-subunit of transducin dis-
sociates and activates a phosphodiesterase,
which hydrolyses cGMP to GMP, preventing
cation inﬂux and reversing depolarisation.
Adaptation to dim light
Exposure to bright light desensitises rod cells
because 11-trans-retinal dissociates from rhodop-
sin, leaving it ‘bleached’. In order for rod cells to
regain their sensitivity, 11-trans-retinal must be
converted to 11-cis-retinal by retinal isomerase.
This accounts for the delay in adjustment to dim
light.
Adaptation to bright light
Cone cells also desensitise in response to contin-
ued exposure to bright light because a reduction in
calcium ion inﬂux in response to light activates
guanylyl cyclase, which generates cGMP. An in-
crease in cGMP re-establishes the inﬂux of cations.
This allows cone cells to distinguish light intensity
over a wider range.
Processing in the retina
Photoreceptors synapse with two distinct types of
bipolar cell:
1 Flat bipolar cells are hyperpolarised in the light,
because they are depolarised by glutamate.
2 Invaginating bipolar cells are depolarised in
the light, because they are hyperpolarised by
glutamate.
This pattern of depolarisation and hyperpolar-
isation is transmitted to the retinal ganglion cells
with which bipolar cells synapse, giving rise to ‘on
and off channels’ and improving contrast within
the image.
Contrast is enhanced by lateral inhibition. Illu-
mination of the centre and surround of a visual
ﬁeld has the opposite effect, e.g. illumination of the
centre of the receptive ﬁeld of an invaginating
bipolar cell will cause it to depolarise, whereas
illumination of the surround will cause it to hy-
perpolarise. Thecells mediating this differ between
the photoreceptors:
. For cone cell transmission, this mechanism is
mediated by horizontal cells. Glutamate is stimu-
latory to horizontal cells, causing them to secrete
inhibitory GABA, which acts back on adjacent
photoreceptors, reducing glutamate release.
. For rod cell transmission, this mechanism is
mediated by amacrine cells. Amacrine cells also
encode information about object movement.
Ganglion cells send out axons in the optic nerve;
they are of two types:
1 Magnocellular neurons show transient re-
sponses in response to illumination and are
sensitive to movement. They are not colour
selective.
2 Parvocellular
neurons
show
sustained
re-
sponses to illumination, have small receptor
ﬁelds, adapting them to high resolution form
discrimination, and are wavelength selective.
They exhibit wavelength opponency by which
input fromone typeofconecell isstimulatory but
input from another is inhibitory. This opponency
follows different patterns in simple concentric
neurons and coextensive neurons (Fig. 17.19).
The different properties of parvocellular and mag-
nocellular neurons represent the ﬁrst stage of par-
allel processing in the visual system, in which
different attributes of vision are processed simul-
taneously but separately.
DEFINITION Parallel processing
In many systems various features of the stimuli are
extracted and processed simultaneously. This
parallel processing allows distinct attributes to be
analysed efﬁciently. In the visual system the parvo-
cellular part processes colour, whereas the magno-
cellular part processes movement and edges.
Visual pathway
Axons of the parvocellular and magnocellular gan-
glion cells leave the eye in the optic nerve, at the
blind spot, which lacks photoreceptors. The optic
nerve is the primary afferent nerve in the visual
pathway. Neurons in the optic nerve originating
from the nasal half of the retina cross over at
the optic chiasma to join the contralateral optic
tract, whereas axons from the temporal half of the
retina remain in the ipsilateral optic tract. The optic
tracts convey neurons from the ipsilateral side of
Neuroscience 501

each eye, corresponding to the opposite sides of
the visual ﬁeld, i.e. the left optic tract carries signals
from the left side of both retinas, which receive
images from the right side of the visual ﬁeld. The
optic tract projects to the lateral geniculate nucleus
of the thalamus in the optic radiation (Fig. 17.20).
CLINICAL Visual impairments due to
damage to the optic nerve or tract
Damage to the optic neural pathways produce differ-
ent defects, depending on the location of the lesion:
. Lesions of the optic nerve cause monocular blind-
ness, loss of site in one eye.
. The optic chiasma is situated above the pituitary
fossa, making it vulnerable to compression by pi-
tuitary tumours. This results in bitemporal hemiano-
pia (tunnel vision), because decussating axons
from the nasal halves of the retina are damaged.
. Lesions of the optic tract beyond the optic chias-
ma give rise to speciﬁc sight deﬁcits in the con-
tralateral half of the visual ﬁeld.
Organisation of neuronal input in the
lateral geniculate nucleus of the
thalamus
The lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus
(LGN) has six layers:
. Magnocellular neurons project to the innermost
two layers.
. Parvocellular neurons project to the outer four
layers.
. Neurons originating in the eye on the same side
as the LGN project to layers 2, 3 and 5.
. Neurons from the contralateral eye project to
layers 1, 4 and 6.
Retinotopic mapping of input neurons to the
LGN means that neighbouring sites in the eye’s
visual ﬁeld are represented on adjacent vertical
cross-sections through the LGN and the fovea is
mapped to a disproportionately large area.
In the ﬁnal part of the visual pathway, neurons
pass from the LGN to the primary visual cortex
(V1), in the calcarine sulcus of the occipital lobe.

Neuroscience

Organisation of the visual cortex
The visual cortex is arranged into ﬁve areas, V1–V5,
which progressively process visual information.
Each region has a different role:
1 V1 isthe primary visual cortex which receives the
retinal signals from the LGN. It is located at the
most rear part of the occipital lobe.
2 V2 is associated with the processing of visual
stimuli and shares many features with V1, pro-
cessing information on colour and orientation of
an object. It is also has more complex processing
and is thought to be involved in identifying
whether a feature is part of a subject or part of
the background of an image.
3 V3 can be divided effectively into two parts, the
dorsal part being associated with the posterior
parietal lobe, forming part of the ‘where’ stream,
which processes spatial location and orienta-
tion. The ventral stream is associated with the
inferior temporal lobe, and related to the iden-
tiﬁcation of what a subject is. V3 is important in
the recognition of form.
4 V4 is associated with the ventral stream and
the recognition of something. It also shows
signiﬁcantattentionmodulation,allowingselec-
tion of what stimuli reaching the region are
processed.
5 V5 is associated with the dorsal stream processes
of location and movement of an object. As a
result it is also closely related to eye movement
and integrating signals in the perception of
movement.
Organisation of neuronal input
in the primary visual cortex
The organisation of neuronal input to the primary
visual cortex preserves retinotopic mapping. There
is a convergence of input from the two eyes and
also from multiple retinal cells with different re-
ceptor ﬁelds – signal information from the same
visual axis, from simple cells to complex cells, and
from complex cells to hypercomplex cells. Conver-
gence of multiple inputs is responsible for two
important aspects of the receptive ﬁeld of hyper-
complex cells:
1 Their receptive ﬁeld is deﬁned by a given visual
axis as opposed to a discrete point in the visual
ﬁeld, as in simple cells.

2 They receive input from both visual ﬁelds, al-
though this is normally biased towards either the
ipsilateral or the contralateral side.
Hypercomplex cells are arranged into hypercol-
umns which comprise all cells representing a par-
ticular visual axis.
Neurons from the parvocellular pathway split
into two distinct sub-pathways, which are labelled
with cytochrome oxidase staining as blob and
interblob regions:
. Blobregionsshowcolouropponency(Fig.17.21).
. Interblob regions show high-resolution deﬁni-
tion of form but do not show colour opponency.
Properties of the primary
visual cortex
The primary visual cortex, V1, is responsible for
conscious perception of sight. V1 computes the
depth of the visual ﬁeld for distant objects by:
. parallax: closer objects appear to move relative
to further ones
. perspective: convergence of parallel lines
. visual occlusion: closer objects obscure more
distant ones.
. shadows.
V1 computes the depth of the visual ﬁeld for
nearby objects by the following:
. Retinal disparity: the same object falls in a
slightly different visual axis on the left and right
visual ﬁelds. This is known as binocular vision.
The existence of internal visual pictures, intrinsic
and learned, in V1 allows:
– pattern completionobjects can be recognised
even if the retinal image is incomplete
– generalisationfamiliar objects can be recog-
nised from multiple angles.
. Colour opponency in blob regions of V1 causes:
colour constancy: objects appear the same col-
our irrespective of their illumination.
. Change in illumination wavelength causes equal
but opposite effects on the centre and surround
of double opponent cells.
. Perceptual cancellation: due to antagonism be-
tween light of different wavelengths, an object
cannot appear reddish green but instead appears
brown.
Accessory visual cortex
All types of primary visual ﬁeld input to V1 have a
corresponding output to the V2 region of the ac-
cessory visual cortex. These output regions are
differentiated by their cytochrome oxidase stain-
ing pattern:
. Regions in V1 with magnocellular input send
neuronal input to thick striped regions of V2.
. Blob regions in V1 send neuronal input to thin
striped regions in V2.
. Inter-blob regions in V1 send neuronal input to
interstripe regions in V2.
This parallel processing of different visual attri-
butes is maintained in accessory areas of visual
cortex:
. Thick striped regions send input to V5, which is
important in perception of motion.
. Thin striped regions send input to V4, which is
important in colour recognition.
. Interstripe regions send input to V3, which is
important in form recognition.

Neuroscience

The different pathways are not entirely indepen-
dent; there are reciprocal pathways between
V3 and V4 and between V5 and V4.
CLINICAL Blind sight
Patients with lesions to V1 can often localise an
object with a high degree of accuracy, but deny
awareness of its existence, a phenomenon known
as blind sight. It is thought that this is because some
neuronal projections from the LGN bypass V1, and
connect directly to V2 and the accessory visual
cortex.
Visual reﬂexes
Some neurons in the visual pathway project to
subcortical motor nuclei, which are involved in
motor reﬂexes of the eye in response to light. These
reﬂexes enhance vision and protect the eye.
Consensual light reﬂex
Shining a bright light into one eye causes constric-
tion of the pupil of both that eye and the contra-
lateral eye. This consensual light reﬂex is impor-
tant because variation in the diameter of the pupil
can change the amount of light entering the eye by
30-fold. The neuronal pathway involved in this
reﬂex is as follows:
. Neurons in the optic tract project to the pre-
tectum.
. The pre-tectum sends output to the Edinger–
Westphal nucleus in the brain stem.
. Preganglionic parasympathetic ﬁbres in the
Edinger–Westphal nucleus project to the ciliary
ganglion in the oculomotor nerve.
. The ciliary ganglion sends postganglionic para-
sympathetic ﬁbres to the pupil. Activity in these
postganglionic nerve ﬁbres causes constriction
of the pupil.
Accommodation reﬂex
When an object gets closer, light reﬂecting off it
diverges more as it enters the eye. Therefore,
the lens must refract it to a greater extent, to focus
the image on the fovea. This is achieved by
accommodation reﬂex. The neural pathway in-
volved in this reﬂex is as follows:
. Blurring of the visual image in V1, because of
insufﬁcient refraction by the lens, activates neu-
rons that extend from V1 to the pre-tectum.
. The pre-tectum stimulates the Edinger–West-
phal nucleus, which in turn stimulates the ciliary
ganglion.
. Activation
of
the
parasympathetic
ﬁbres
emerging from the ciliary ganglion causes mus-
cles in the ciliary body to contract.
. Contraction of the ciliary body reduces the
tension in the suspensory ligaments and lens
capsule, causing the lens to shorten and become
more spherical, and so refract light rays more.
Parasympathetic activity in the ciliary ganglion
also causes the pupils to constrict, increasing the
depth of the visual ﬁeld.
Reﬂex eye movements
A projection of the optic tract to the superﬁcial
layer of the superior colliculus is involved in trig-
gering movement of the eyes, so as to focus an
object on to the fovea.
Hearing
Sound perception alerts an individual to noise
coming from objects in the external environ-
ment
and
is
important
in
aural
language
comprehension.
Sensory input in hearing
The sensory input in hearing is a pressure wave
(sound wave) transmitted through a medium, e.g.
air. Sound waves have waveforms: cycles of alter-
nating compression and expansion. There are two
important properties of sound waves in the context
of hearing:
1 Frequency: the time taken for one complete
waveform – the higher the frequency, the higher
the pitch of the perceived sound. The unit of
frequency is the hertz (Hz). Young people are
sensitive to a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
Maximum sensitivity is over the range 1–4 kHz
and sensitivity to the upper end of the frequency
spectrum decreases with age.
Neuroscience 505

2 Amplitude: themaximumpressurethata sound
wave causes in a medium. The amplitude of a
sound wave corresponds to the loudness of the
perceived sound: the greater the amplitude, the
louder the perceived sound. The unit of ampli-
tude is the decibel (dB). Speech is normally about
65 dB. Sounds over 120dB damage hearing.
Transmission of sound waves
Sound waves are funnelled into the external audi-
tory meatus by the pinna. Sound waves pass
through the external auditory meatus to the tym-
panic membrane, where a relay of three bones, the
malleus, incus and stapes, connects the tympanic
membrane to the oval window of the cochlea
(Fig. 17.22):
. The malleus is closest to the tympanic mem-
brane and moves in response to its vibrations.
. The incus articulates with the malleus and the
stapes.
. The stapes is pushed inwards as a result of its
articulation with the incus. This causes it to press
against the oval window of the cochlea, to which
it is attached by an annular ligament. The fact
that the oval window has a 20-fold smaller area
than the tympanic membrane causes a large
increase in the pressure of the sound wave trans-
mitted to the inner ear.
CLINICAL Conductive deafness
Wax in the external meatus, overgrowth of bones in
the middle ear (osteosclerosis) or infection of the
middle ear (otitis media) can impair sound wave
conduction, leading to conductive deafness.
Structure of the cochlea
The cochlea is the structure in the inner ear re-
sponsible for the transduction of sound into ner-
vous signals. The bony labyrinth of the cochlea
winds around a central column, the modiolus. The
cochlea is divided into three anatomical compart-
ments, scalae, by the membranous cochlear duct
(Fig. 17.23):
1 The scala vestibuli is adjacent to the oval win-
dow, via which pressure waves from the middle
ear are transmitted.
2 The scala vestibuli is anatomically connected
to the scala tympani via the helicotrema. At the
end of the scala tympani there is a round
window.
3 The scala media lies between the scala vestibuli
and the scala tympani but is separated from
them by the cochlear duct.

Neuroscience

The organ of corti
The basement membrane of the scala media sup-
ports the organ of Corti, in which sensory trans-
duction occurs. The organ of Corti contains hair
cells from which projections (stereocilia) extend in
ascending order of height. The tallest of these
stereocilia contact the mucopolysaccharide tector-
ial membrane of the scala media above. Hair cells
of two types can be found on the organ of Corti:
1 Inner hair cells are arranged in a single row. The
inner hair cells send afferent output to the eighth
cranial nerve and are responsible for sensing
sound.
2 Outer hair cells are arranged in three rows and
receive efferent input from CN VIII. The efferent
output causes the outer hair cells to oscillate at a
similar frequency to the sound wave, increasing
the amplitude of the displacement of the base-
ment membrane.
Transduction of sound waves to
electrical impulses in the inner ear
Both the scala tympani and the scala vestibuli
contain incompressible perilymph, which is se-
creted by the stria vascularis. Oscillation of the
oval window causes conduction of a pressure wave
from the scala vestibuli to the scala tympani, after
which it is dissipated at the round window. Trans-
mission
of
the
pressure
wave
through
the
perilymph causes the basement membrane of the
scala media to move up and down.
Oscillation of the basement membrane causes
the tallest stereocilia of the hair cells in the organ of
Corti to shear against the mucopolysaccharide
tectorial membrane. As the stereocilia of the hair
cells are joined to each other by tip links, bending
of the tallest stereocilium creates tension on other
stereocilia. This opens ion channels in membranes
of the stereocilia. The scala media contains K þ-
rich endolymph secreted by the stria vascularis. As
a result of the high concentration of potassium
ions and high positive charge of the endolymph
relative to the intracellular ﬂuid, potassium ions
move into the hair cells, depolarising them.
Depolarisation causes the hair cells to release
glutamate, triggering an action potential in the
afferent neurons of the vestibulocochlear nerve
with which they synapse.
CLINICAL Damage to outer hair cells
Outer hair cells are selectively damaged by amino-
glycoside antibiotics. This leads to sensorineural
deafness, deafness due to impaired signal trans-
duction in the inner ear, which should be differen-
tiated from conductive deafness, deafness due to
impaired conduction of the sound wave in the mid-
dle ear.

CLINICAL Conductive deafness versus
sensorineural deafness
Conductive deafness can be distinguished clinical-
ly from sensorineural deafness by performing
Rinne's and Weber's tests:
. In Rinne's test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed
over the mastoid process and then over the ex-
ternal auditory meatus. People with normal hear-
ing will hear a louder sound when the tuning fork is
placed over the external auditory meatus, be-
cause sound waves are conducted better through
air. However, in conductive deafness, the sound
will be loudest when the tuning fork is held over the
mastoid process.
. In Weber's test, the vibrating tuning fork is placed
in the centre of the patient’s forehead. A person
with normal hearing will appreciate the sound as
being equally loud in both ears. Someone with
conductive deafness will hear the sound loudest
in the affected ear. By contrast someone with
sensorineural hearing loss will hear the sound
loudest in the unaffected side.
Auditory pathway
Neurons of CN VIII have their cell bodies in the
spiral ganglia in the cochlea. CN VIII projects
to the vestibulocochlear nucleus of the pons
(Fig. 17.24).
The ventral vestibulocochlear nuclei regulate
reﬂex contraction of the tensor tympani and sta-
pedius muscles in response to loud noises. These
muscles pull the auditory bones away from the oval
window, dampening sound conduction in the
middle ear.
The dorsal vestibulocochlear nucleus carries
sound signals to the auditory cortex projects to
the contralateral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus
via the dorsal acoustic striae. There are reciprocal
connections between the nuclei of the lateral lem-
niscus on either side. From the nucleus of the
lateral lemniscus, neurons project to the inferior
colliculus and then on to the medial geniculate
nucleus of the thalamus (MGN) and the primary
auditory cortex (A1) in the superior temporal gyrus
via the auditory radiation. A1 is responsible for
conscious sound perception.
Encoding of sound frequency
The frequency of sound is encoded throughout the
auditory system in different ways:
. Place coding occurs in the cochlear. As the base-
ment membrane on which the organ of Corti
rests becomes thicker and less rigid away from
the stapedial end, the neurons at the stapedial
end are more sensitive to high-frequency sounds
and neurons at the apical end more sensitive to
low-frequency sounds.
. Frequency coding for lower-frequency sounds
also occurs by phase locking, by which different
afferent neurons have the highest probability of
ﬁring at different phases of the waveform. Popu-
lations of neurons can together, therefore, en-
code frequency.
. Precise patterning of input from neurons origi-
nating from different points along the cochlear to
the inferior colliculus, MGN and A1 gives rise to
tonotopic mapping. The same frequency is re-
presented in all layers of A1 along a vertical axis.
High frequencies are represented inferiorly, low
frequencies superiorly.
Sound localisation
The spatial origin of a sound is calculated by the
superior olive:
. Differences in the time of input into the two ears
aredetectedbybushyneuronsintheleftandright
cochlear nuclei which are capable of phase lock-
ing. Bushy neurons in the left and right cochlear
nuclei ﬁre at slightly different times if there is a
difference in the time the sound arrives between
the two ears. Medial superior olive neurons ﬁre
maximally when input from the ipsilateral and
contralateral cochlear nuclei arrives at the same
time. Different populations of medial superior
olivary neurons are wired to the two cochlear
nuclei in different ways, so that, for a given time
delay, only one population of these neurons will
ﬁre maximally. This mode of localisation is most
efﬁcientforlow-frequencysounds,becausehigh-
frequency sounds may vary in the time of input to
both ears by more than one phase.
. Neurons in the lateral superior olive detect dif-
ferences in the intensity of input from stellate
cells in the left and right cochlear nuclei. Input to
the ear furthest from the sound is quieter, be-
cause passage of the sound wave through the
head mufﬂes it. Neurons in the lateral superior
508
Neuroscience

olive receive an excitatory input from stellate
cells in the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus but an
inhibitory input from stellate cells in the contra-
lateral cochlear nucleus. Therefore, if the sound
is closer to the contralateral ear, the lateral super-
ior olive neuron is inhibited, whereas it is stim-
ulated if the sound is closer to the ipsilateral ear.
Detection of the origin of a sound in
the vertical axis
The capacity of bushy cells in the cochlear nuclei to
phase lock also allows the origin of sound to be
localised in the vertical axis. Sound waves enter the
external auditory meatus by both a direct pathway
and an indirect pathway, in which they are re-
ﬂected off the bumpy surface of the pinna. Sound
waves with different vertical origins show unique
patterns of reﬂection off the surface of the pinna.
This causes differences in the time of arrival at the
ipsilateral cochlear nucleus for sound waves en-
tering the ear by the indirect pathway, depending
on the vertical origin of the sound wave; this causes
different populations of bushy neurons to ﬁre at
different times. This phase-locked pattern of ﬁring
allows neurons in the medial superior olive to
analyse the vertical origin of sounds.
No speciﬁc map has been identiﬁed in the pri-
mary or secondary auditory cortex.

Neuroscience 509

Secondary auditory cortex
Secondary auditory cortex is involved in some of
the higher processing of sound - it is involved in
processing elements music and speech. It lacks
clearly deﬁned maps.
CLINICAL Lesions of the secondary
auditory cortex
One area of the secondary auditory cortex that is
particularly important clinically is Wernicke's area
which is important in speech comprehension.
Lesions to this area result in receptive aphasia, an
inability to understand language.
Vestibular system
The vestibular system is important in the mainte-
nance of posture and balance; it also regulates
reﬂexes related to eye movements.
Sensory input
The sensory input to the vestibular system is static
position or acceleration of the head, either linear or
rotational. The sensory transduction apparatus of
the vestibular system comprises endolymph-con-
taining components of the membranous labyrinth
of the inner ear:
. Otolith organs, the utricle and saccule, detect
static head position and linear acceleration in the
horizontal and vertical axes, respectively
. Semicircular ducts – posterior, superior and
horizontal – arranged 100 relative to each other,
detect rotational acceleration.
Transduction in the otolith organs
Theutricleandsacculecontainendolymph.Within
the utricle and saccule, transduction is performed
by the macula. The macula comprises a sheet of
sensory epithelial cells with stereocilia. The tallest
stereocilia (konocilia) are embedded within a ge-
latinous tectorial membrane studded with calci-
um carbonate crystals, otoconia.
Linear acceleration causes the tectorial mem-
brane to be displaced relative to the hair cell,
because of the otoconia’s inertia. This bends the
konocilia in the direction of movement. As the
stereocilia are tethered to the konocilia, tension
exerted on the connections between them and ion
channels are opened in response to deformation of
the cilia.
The electrical and chemical gradient between
the intracellular ﬂuid in the hair cells and the
endolymph causes potassium ions to enter the hair
cells through open ion channels, depolarising
them and causing them to release glutamate. Glu-
tamate depolarises the primary afferent neuron
that synapses with the hair cells.
Transduction in the semicircular
ducts
At the base of each semicircular duct is a dilatation,
the ampulla. The ampulla contains hair cells em-
bedded in a gelatinous matrix, the cupula.
Rotational acceleration causes movement of
the endolymph. However, inertia of the endo-
lymph causes it to lag, exerting a force on the
ampulla. This displaces the cupula relative to the
hair cells, leading to transduction in a similar
manner to that described for otolith organs.
Vestibular pathway
The primary afferent neurons project to the ves-
tibular nuclei in the brain stem. These vestibular
nuclei send neuronal output to:
. the oculomotor nucleus: involved in vestibulo-
ocular reﬂexes in which the gaze is kept steady,
despite rotation of the head
. the cerebellum, involved in postural reﬂexes
which keep the position of the body constant
. the contralateral ventroposterior lateral nucle-
us of the thalamus: from here, an afferent pro-
jection is sent to areas of the cortex including the
somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal cor-
tex which contributes to conscious awareness of
posture and balance.
CLINICAL Meniere's disease
Meniere’s disease is due to a failure to reabsorb
endolymph in the cochlear duct of one ear. The
increase in endolymph volume causes the mem-
branous labyrinth to rupture and herniate. This
causes loss of hearing and tinnitus in the affected
ear, and episodes of vertigo and loss of balance
accompanied by nausea or vomiting.
Smell
Smell is involved in taste preference and facilitates
avoidance of potentially noxious objects.
510
Neuroscience

Sensory stimulus in smell
Odorant receptors are present in olfactory cilia
that project from the apical dendrites of bipolar
olfactory receptor neurons. Olfactory cilia are
found in the dorsal epithelial surface of the nose.
Snifﬁng enhances smell, because odorant mole-
cules are targeted by air currents to the back of
the nose.
Olfactory transduction
There are approximately 1000 different odorant
receptors. In all odorant receptor cells transduc-
tion is mediated by a Gs protein second-messenger
cascade. This leads to an increase in the concen-
tration of intracellular cAMP, causing cyclic nucle-
otide-gated cation channels to open, depolarising
the neuron.
Each bipolar olfactory receptor neuron ex-
presses one type of olfactory receptor. However,
odorant molecules bind two to six different
types of odorant receptor with different afﬁni-
ties. By comparing the range of odorant recep-
tors that an odorant molecule binds, the brain is
able to distinguish approximately 10 000 differ-
ent odours.
Olfactory receptors become desensitised on pro-
longed exposure to the same odorant. This is be-
cause Ca2 þ binds calmodulin, forming a complex
that binds to the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels
and reduces the efﬁcacy of cyclic nucleotide
binding.
Olfactory pathways
The axons of bipolar olfactory receptor neurons
project from the nasal epithelium to the CNS in the
olfactory nerve (CN I). The olfactory nerve enters
the CNS at the top of the nose by piercing the
cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, where the
olfactory nerve makes excitatory synapses with
mitral and tufted cells in the glomeruli of the
olfactory bulbs. Bipolar olfactory neurons re-
sponding to the same odour terminate in the same
glomerulus.
Mitral and tufted cells send out axonal projec-
tions in the olfactory tract. Axons in the olfactory
tract project to the:
. contralateral olfactory bulb
. pyriform cortex and amygdala: from here there
is a projection to the hypothalamus, which con-
trols behavioural responses to smell
. hippocampus:
establishes
olfactory
compo-
nents of episodic memories
. mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and from
there to the prefrontal cortex: involved in con-
scious smell perception.
Taste
Taste perception permits selection of nutritionally
valuable foods over noxious ones.
The sensory stimuli for taste are salt, sugar, acid,
bitterness and unami (meat ﬂavour). Olfactory
pathways and smell also contribute heavily to our
appreciation of taste.
Taste receptors
Transduction
of
taste
stimuli
into
electrical
signals occurs in epithelial cells in the tongue,
pharynx and oesophagus; 50–150 taste receptor
cells are typically clustered together to form a
taste bud:
. Taste receptor cells in the anterior two-thirds
of the tongue are most sensitive to sweet and
salty tastes. They synapse with primary afferent
nerves in CN VII.
. Taste receptor cells in the posterior third of the
tongue are most sensitive to sour and bitter
tastes. Theysynapse with primary afferent nerves
in CN IX.
. Taste receptor cells in the pharynx and oesoph-
agus detect differences in the ionic concentra-
tion of sodium and hydrogen ions. They synapse
with primary afferent nerves in CN X.
Transduction in taste receptors
Transduction of taste signals occurs when a taste
stimulus causes depolarisation of the taste recep-
tor cell membrane, triggering calcium ion inﬂux
and neurotransmitter release. This activates the
afferent neuron. The mechanism by which each
taste stimulus causes depolarisation of the taste
receptor cell membrane varies:
. Salty tastes directly cause depolarisation of taste
receptor cells by the inﬂux of Na þ.
. Sour tastes result from H þ ions which depolarise
taste receptor cells by blocking voltage-gated K þ
channels, responsible for maintaining the hyper-
polarised resting membrane potential.
Neuroscience 511

. Sweet and unami tastes cause depolarisation of
taste receptor cells via a Gs protein second-mes-
senger cascade, which leads to an increase in
intracellular cAMP that closes voltage-gated K þ
channels.
. Bitter tastes depolarise taste receptor cells in
multiple different ways, reﬂecting the diversity
of molecules that are bitter ﬂavoured.
Taste pathway
Primary afferent taste neurons in CN VII, IX and X
project to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of
the medulla. From the NTS, neurons project via the
ipsilateral ventroposterior medial nucleus of the
thalamus to an area of cortex adjacent to that
mapping somatosensation from the tongue, which
is involved in the conscious appreciation of taste.
Neurons from the primary taste cortex project to
the insula, which is involved in the emotional
response to different tastes. The NTS is also
thought to send a neuronal projection to the amyg-
dala and lateral hypothalamus, which regulates
behavioural responses to taste, i.e. feeding.
Association areas of
cortex
Cortical association areas integrate signals from
different sensory systems. This facilitates higher
brain functions and motor planning.
Temporal cortex
The temporal cortex is involved in the complex
processing
of
many
stimuli,
including
the
following:
. The temporal auditory cortex is responsible for
the processing and comprehension of language.
. The parahippocampal gyrus is involved in the
laying down of memory.
. The inferior temporal cortex processes visual
information and is important in visual recogni-
tion. It receives neuronal input from V4 and V3
visual association cortex, which are involved in
colour and form discrimination respectively.
Connections from these areas of visual cortex to
the temporal cortex are collectively termed the
‘what stream’. Lesions of the inferior temporal
cortex cause an inability to recognise objects or
faces.
Posterior parietal cortex
One part of the posterior parietal cortex receives
input from the touch pathway and proprioceptive
pathways. It is important in awareness of body
position and recognition of objects through touch.
Lesions to this area can lead to neglect of contra-
lateral sensory input and, sometimes, denial of the
existence of a limb, or to astereogenesis, an in-
ability to recognise objects through touch.
Another part of the posterior parietal cortex
receives input from the V5 area of visual associa-
tion cortex, which is involved in perception of
movement. The connection between V5 and the
posterior parietal cortex is known as the ‘where’
stream. Lesions result in a difﬁculty in performing
visuospatial tasks. Abnormalities in this area may
cause dyslexia (difﬁculty in reading), dyscalculia
(difﬁculty in performing mathematical calcula-
tions) and dysgraphia (difﬁculty in writing).
Prefrontal cortex
The prefrontal cortex is involved in planning motor
responses to sensory stimuli. It is particularly de-
veloped in humans and plays a role in behavioural
regulation and inhibition. Lesions to the prefrontal
cortex result in a characteristic proﬁle of clinical
symptoms:
. Disinhibition with childish behaviour
. Emotional blunting or sometimes aggression
. Deﬁcits in working memory
. A short attention span
. Reduction in spontaneous movement and
speech
. An inability to formulate or pursue plans and
goals.
CLINICAL Broca's aphasia
Broca's region in the prefrontal cortex is respon-
sible for speech. Lesions to this area result in ex-
pressive aphasia, an inability to form recognisable
words. Broca’s region has reciprocal connections
with Wernicke’s area in the temporal cortex via the
arcuate fasiculus. Lesions to this arcuate fasiculus
result in an inability to repeat words and phrases.
512
Neuroscience

Neuroendocrine control of
body systems
The hypothalamus can inﬂuence both the endo-
crine and neural homoeostatic systems in the
body:
. Endocrine regulation: some hypothalamic nu-
clei release neurohormones that are transported
via the hypothalamo-hypophyseal vessels to the
anterior pituitary where they regulate pituitary
hormone release, e.g. cortisol-releasing hor-
mone (CRH). Other hypothalamic nuclei project
to the posterior pituitary, directly secreting hor-
mones into the bloodstream. ADH and oxytocin
are secreted in this manner.
. Neurological regulation: both the sympathetic
and parasympathetic nervous systems are regu-
lated by pathways from the hypothalamus:
– Parasympathetic structures that receive ﬁ-
bres from the hypothalamus include the pre-
tectal and Edinger–Westphal nuclei and the
parasympathetic neurons in the sacral part of
the spinal cord (originate from the paraven-
tricular nucleus of the hypothalamus)
– Sympathetic preganglionic neurons located
in the sympathetic chain receive signals from
the hypothalamus.
Outputs to higher centres
The hypothalamus can modulate the function of
the body as a result of signals received from the
higher centres of the brain, reﬂecting perceived or
anticipated stress on the body. Similarly, the state
of the body is sensed by the hypothalamus and, in
turn, may inﬂuence emotions and the higher cen-
tres of the brain. Finally, ﬁbres within the tract
project to the choroid plexus, where they may alter
the production of CSF.
Higher cognitive functions
Higher cognitive functions are complex brain pro-
cesses that entail more than the simple processing
of sensory input and motor output. This section
discusses the higher cognitive functions of mem-
ory, sleep and consciousness. Although appetite is
regulated by similar pathways it is discussed
elsewhere,
in
relation
to
the
GI
tract
and
endocrinology.
Memory
Memory is the storage of a fact, experience or skill
as a neural circuit in the brain, allowing later recall.
Memory requires neuronal plasticity (the poten-
tial of neurons to be rewired).
Memories can be categorised as short or long
term. It is thought that distinct areas of the brain or
different processes are involved in these two types
of memory, because deﬁcits in one type can occur
independently of deﬁcits in the other type.
Short-term memory
A ﬁnite number of items may be stored in short-
term memory: seven plus or minus two items is the
normal range. Short-term memories are tempo-
rary and require constant rehearsal if they are not
to be displaced by new incoming information.
Short-term memory has a phonological loop, in-
volving the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain,
which is required in sentence comprehension. It
also has a visuospatial loop, involving the right
hemisphere of the brain which is needed in nav-
igation. Short-term memory is thought to be stored
in the prefrontal cortex.
Long-term memory
The storage capacity of long-term memory is with-
out obvious limits during an individual’s lifetime.
Long-term memories are retained without con-
stant rehearsal. Long-term memory may be sub-
categorised
into
procedural
and
declarative
memory:
. Formation of a procedural memory (knowing
how to perform a skill) is slow and requires
constant rehearsal. However, once formed, recall
is unconscious and the memory is rarely lost.
Procedural
memories
are
stored
in
the
cerebellum.
. Declarative (factual) memory is rapidly laid
down, recalled consciously and easily lost. De-
clarative memories may be episodic, when a
cluster of facts is memorised in relation to a
speciﬁc time and place, or semantic, when facts
are learned out of context.
Declarative memory is stored in structures in the
medial temporal lobe: the hippocampus, parahip-
pocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, anterior

cingulate cortex. The mamillary bodies and the
anterior and dorsomedial nuclei of the thalamus
are also thought to be involved. The amygdala
plays a role in associative memory involving fear
(when a non-noxious stimulus elicits physiological
symptoms of fear, because it is normally closely
followed by a noxious stimulus). Damage to the
amygdala impairs the ability to learn new associa-
tions of this kind, and to recall those that have
already been learnt.
CLINICAL Korsakoff's syndrome
Korsakoff’s syndrome is characterised by an inabil-
ity to form new memories. Long-term recall is unaf-
fected and the person confabulates to compensate
for deﬁcits in short-term memory. The most common
cause is thiamine deﬁciency, secondary to alcohol-
ism. It is thought to be the structures in the midbrain
involved in memory that are most affected by this
deﬁciency.
Molecular basis of memory
Rewiring of neurons to form new memory circuitry
is permitted by changes in the strength of synaptic
connections. An increase in the strength of synap-
tic connections is called long-term potentiation.
Long-term potentiation and long-term depression
occur in the hippocampus, enabling the storage of
declarative
memories.
Long-term
depression
alone occurs in the cerebellum, allowing the stor-
age of procedural memories.
Long-term potentiation
Long-term potentiation (LTP) is caused by simul-
taneous excitation in the pre and postsynaptic
neuron. As a result, subsequent inputs from the
same presynaptic neuron cause a larger excitatory
postsynaptic potential in the postsynaptic neuron.
The molecular mechanism underlying this is as
follows (Fig. 17.25):
. In response to a large excitation, presynaptic
cells in the hippocampus release large amounts
of glutamate which, by activating postsynaptic
AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors,
depolarise the postsynaptic neuron sufﬁciently
so that Mg2 þ ions dissociate from postsynaptic
NMDA receptors.
. Once Mg2 þ ions have dissociated, the action of
glutamate on NMDA receptors causes an inﬂux
of Ca2 þ ions into the postsynaptic cell.
. Ca2 þ ion inﬂux is crucial to the induction of LTP
because it induces the changes responsible for
increases in synaptic strength:
– Ca2 þ
ions
activate
calcium–calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII), which
phosphorylates AMPA channels, increasing
their sensitivity to glutamate
– Ca2 þ ions promote the synthesis of molecules,
such as NO and carbon monoxide, which
diffuse into the presynaptic cell, increasing
glutamate release.
. Ca2 þ ions induce the synthesis of phosphoki-
nase A, via a second-messenger cascade, which
alters gene expression.
Sleep
Sleep is characterised by reduced responsiveness
to external sensory stimuli, changes in the elec-
troencephalogram (EEG), and changes in auto-
nomic function.
DEFINITION EEG
In electroencephalography electricalactivityacross
the cortex of the brain is measured by surface
electrodes applied to the scalp and converted to
a trace (the EEG), the pattern of which reﬂects the
patient’s state of consciousness. Its main applica-
tions are in the diagnosis and management of sleep
disorders and epilepsy
Changes in the EEG during the
different stages of sleep
High-frequency, low-amplitude, desynchronised b
waves are recorded on the EEG of a person who
is awake. On falling into a progressively deeper
sleep (moving through stage 1 to stage 4 sleep),
these EEG rhythms develop a lower frequency
and higher amplitude, becoming a waves in
stage 2 sleep and then d waves in stage 3 and
4 sleep (Table 17.4).
Continuous electrical communication between
the thalamus and cortex is recorded on the EEG of a
person who is awake. In the early stages of deep
sleep (also known as slow-wave or non- rapid eye
movement</patentCit> [REM] sleep), there is still
Neuroscience 515

electrical communication between the thalamus
and cortex. However, the thalamus becomes hy-
perpolarised, due to a loss of excitatory input from
the hypothalamus, which causes it to ﬁre repetitive
and synchronised action potentials in rapid suc-
cession, known as sleep spindles. This character-
istic pattern of electrical activity is transmitted to
the cortex so that it also ﬁres sleep spindles. These
sleep spindles are responsible for the a rhythm
recorded on an EEG. In the later stages of deep
sleep, the thalamus becomes so hyperpolarised
that it no longer ﬁres action potentials and the
cortex produces action potentials independently.
This independent ﬁring of action potentials by the
cortex is responsible for the d rhythm recorded on
the EEG. During deep sleep, respiration rate, heart
rate, blood pressure and GI activity decrease.
REM sleep
Approximately every 90 min (in adults), deep sleep
is broken by a period of REM sleep (also known as
paradoxical sleep or ﬁrst-wave sleep), lasting
10–20 min. This is termed ‘paradoxical sleep’ be-
cause it is characterised by the same b rhythms as
wakefulness, but the skeletal muscles are paral-
ysed, apart from the extraocular muscles, which
move the eyes back and forth, and the respiratory
muscles, and the person is non-responsive. Auto-
nomic function is also abnormal, with increases in
respiration, heart rate, blood pressure and core
temperature. People aroused from REM sleep re-
port that they have been dreaming. Muscle paral-
ysis prevents dreams being acted out.
Neuronal networks that regulate
sleep cycles
The reticular activating system is active during
wakefulness and REM sleep, but not during
non-REM sleep. The reticular activating system
comprises the following:
. GABA- and glutamate-secreting, large-diame-
ter
neurons
that
receive
multiple
sensory
inputs and regulate postural and eye movement
reﬂexes
. Serotonin-, noradrenaline- and acetylcholine-
secreting, small-diameter neurons that project to
the basal forebrain, and ﬁre spontaneously ac-
cording to levels of arousal.
Activity in acetylcholine-secreting neurons in the
reticular activating system increases during REM
sleep, but noradrenaline- and serotonin-secreting
neurons are practically silent, compared with dur-
ing wakefulness. There appears to be reciprocal
inhibition between these two populations of cells,
so that REM sleep and wakefulness are mutually
exclusive. Acetylcholine-secreting neurons send
projections to the vestibular and reticular nuclei
which cause the features characteristic of REM
sleep:
excitation
of
oculomotor
neurons;
autonomic changes; an output to the LGN and
visual cortex; and inhibition of sensory input and
motor output.
The need to sleep
Sleep appears to be required for normal metabolic
function because sleep-derived rats lose weight,
become hypothermic, have a weakened immune
system and eventually die.
Sleep may also be important in consolidation
of ‘experiences’ because REM sleep is thought
to
promote
LTP.
This
is
supported
by
the
observation
that
neonates
(who
experience
many more ‘new things’ than older individuals)
spend a disproportionate amount of time in REM
sleep.

Neuroscience

CLINICAL Abnormalities in sleep
behaviour
Insomnia, an inability to get to sleep,may be caused
by anxiety, depression and chronic pain.
Hypersomnia,sleepingmorethanisnormal,maybe
caused by depression, obstructive sleep apnoea (see
Chapter 7) or narcolepsy. Patients with narcolepsy
have intermittent periods of extreme drowsiness dur-
ing the day. This condition has a strong genetic com-
ponent and is thought to be due to abnormalities in the
brain-stem structures that control sleep.
Consciousness
Consciousness is characterised by an awareness of
sensory stimuli, as well as an awareness of one’s
own physical and mental state.
Different degrees of consciousness
There are varying degrees of consciousness. This
spectrum includes the following:
. Being awake.
. Being asleep.
. Confusion has many potential causes. The pa-
tient shows ﬂuctuating consciousness. Sleep–
wake cycles and reﬂexes are normal. Speech,
audition and vision are also intact, although
speech is disordered.
. Anaesthesia: in anaesthesia, the aim is to induce
d-wave activity (reminiscent of stage 3 and 4 deep
sleep) in the patient’s brain. Reﬂexes are also
inhibited by a drug that blocks transmission at
the neuromuscular junction.
. Persistent vegetative state(PVS) and coma: in
both PVS and coma, the patient shows no sleep–
wake cycles. Reﬂexes are reduced in PVS and very
reduced in coma. There is no speech in either
state. There is no evidence of audition or vision in
a patient in a coma; patients in PVS show only a
startle reﬂex. PVS and coma may be reversed only
if the cause is eliminated.
Neurophysiological
disorders
Neurophysiological disorders have a common
underlying basis of abnormal electrical activity in
the brain.
Epilepsy
Epilepsy is characterised by recurrent transient
periods of abnormal electrical activity in the brain
which give rise to seizures. Epilepsy may be pri-
mary, often with a genetic association, or second-
ary to another condition:
. If abnormal electrical activity extends over the
whole of the brain, the epileptic seizure is said to
be general. All general seizures involve a loss of
consciousness; however, this is of variable dura-
tion, being much longer in tonic–clonic seizures
(grand mal) than in absence seizures (petit mal).
Tonic–clonic seizures are, in addition, charac-
terised by muscle stiffness and spasm.
. If abnormal electrical activity is restricted to
part of the brain, the epileptic seizure is said to
be partial. The symptoms of a partial seizure vary
according to the region of the brain affected, e.g.
partial seizures of the parietal lobe cause abnor-
mal sensations down the contralateral side of the
body, whereas partial seizures of the occipital
lobe cause visual hallucinations. Partial seizures
do not necessarily entail a loss of consciousness.
However, partial seizure activity may spread to
affect the whole brain, in which case it is called a
complex partial seizure.
Underlying basis of epilepsy
Seizures occur as a result of synchronisation of
abnormal depolarisation spikes in multiple neu-
rons. Individual prolonged depolarisation spikes
are seen on the EEG of an individual with epilepsy
between ﬁts and are due to excessive neuronal
excitation of neurons. This may result from re-
duced GABA-mediated inhibition or increased glu-
tamate-mediated excitation.
Pharmacological management of
epilepsy
Various drugs are available, all of which reduce
neuron depolarisation and excitability, but by dif-
ferent mechanisms:
. Sodium channel antagonists (e.g. carbamaze-
pine and phenytoin) suppress abnormal depo-
larisation spikes in hippocampal neurons by
preventing the up-stroke of the action potential.
. Calcium channel antagonists (e.g. ethosuxi-
mide) prevent prolonged neuronal depolarisa-
tion, which can cause repetitive, burst ﬁring.
Neuroscience 517

. Barbiturates
and
benzodiazepines
enhance
GABAA-channel function, so increasing GABA-
mediated neuronal inhibition and opposing
neuronal depolarisation. They are useful in ter-
minating epileptic seizures.
Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of
dementia, the clinical symptoms of which are
deﬁcits in memory, cognition, attention and mo-
tivation, and ultimately death.
Histopathology of alzheimer's
disease
The histopathological characteristics are localised
in the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala areas,
crucial in memory.
. Neuritic plaques are made up of insoluble de-
posits of a peptide fragment, b-amyloid, de-
formed neuronal dendrites and inﬂammatory
brain cells (microglia and astrocytes).
. Neuroﬁbrillary tangles are made up of entwined
helices of tau ﬁlaments (a normally soluble mi-
crotubule protein). They are commonly found in
the deformed dendrites that surround neuritic
plaques.
. Ventricular enlargement is indicative of atrophy
and neuronal death in cortical and subcortical
brain regions.
Molecular basis of neuronal death
in alzheimer's disease
Neuronal death underlies Alzheimer’s disease.
Neuronal death is thought to be triggered when
b-amyloid deposits promote massive calcium in-
ﬂux into neurons, which leads to formation of
neuroﬁbrillary tangles, disrupting the cytoskeleton,
the integrity of which is crucial to neuronal survival.
Causes of alzheimer's disease
A minority of cases of (usually early onset)
Alzheimer’s disease are genetic in origin. Most
cases are idiopathic. Genetic mutations predispos-
ing to Alzheimer’s disease development include:
. Over-expression of the soluble precursor of
b-amyloid, amyloid precursor protein (APP)
. Mutations in presenilin genes: presenilin pro-
teins are thought to increase the production of
b-amyloid from APP, by altering the activity of
two cleavage enzymes, b- and g-secretase
. Mutations in the genes encoding the tau
protein
. Individuals with a common allele of the apoli-
poprotein E gene may have a predisposition to
the
development
of
late-onset,
idiopathic
Alzheimer’s disease. The protein product of this
gene, ApoE4, is thought to enhance aggregation
of b-amyloid into plaques.
Treatments for alzheimer's disease
Inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (e.g. donepezil),
the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, are the
approved drugs in the treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease. They offset the death of cholinergic neu-
rons in the prefrontal cortex, which is thought to
make a particularly profound contribution to dis-
ease symptoms.
Stroke
Stroke is the leading cause of mental deﬁcit in
adults. Impairments in brain function after a stroke
are caused by neuronal death following the forma-
tion of a blood clot or haemorrhage in an artery
supplying the brain.
Treatment of stroke
Treatment
focuses
on
reducing
risk
factors
for future strokes (e.g. reducing blood pressure
and lipid levels) and in rehabilitation of any
impairment resulting from the stroke (e.g. physio-
therapy, speech and language therapy). The exact
course of the treatment is determined by the type
of stroke and the region of the brain affected.

Statistics
Statistics is the science of collecting, analysing and
interpreting data. Statistics are used throughout
medicine to identify signiﬁcant differences under-
lying a condition or to determine effective treat-
ments for conditions inherent in a population.
Key deﬁnitions
Hypotheses
In statistics the core aim is to test a hypothesis to
determine whether the data support or refute
them. For example, a hypothesis may be one such
as ‘drug X improves condition A’. As a result of
making a hypothesis, it is essential to determine
what is being tested and the precise conditions that
are being used. The design of the experiment is
likely to result in a more speciﬁc hypothesis: ‘Drug
X, at dose Y, reduces value B (which is a represen-
tative value of condition A).’
Much of statistics is interpreting whether the
variable measured, and the differences between
the samples, can or cannot be explained as a result
of the random differences seen in the samples,
unrelated to the intervention.
Populations and samples
When testing a theory, in most cases it is impos-
sible to test everyone. As a result, a sample is
taken from the population. This sample is unlikely
to be completely representative of the entire
population, and this sampling variation must be
accounted for.
Data
In a study, data are collected for processing
using statistics. The data collected consist of
observations;
these
measurements
are
called
variables. Variables can be divided into two
types:
. Qualitative variables are not numerical, and
usually refer to categories such as sex, type of
drug or survival.
. Quantitative variables are numerical and can be
further subdivided:
– discrete values are usually whole numbers
such as the number of cases of a condition, or
number of offspring
– continuous values can fall anywhere along
a scale; examples include height and age.
Analysis
Data can be analysed by a variety of statistical tests,
which depend on the type of data collected and the
hypothesis that is being tested. The commonly
used tests are described in more detail later in the
chapter.
After testing, it is essential that the data are
represented in an accurate and easily understand-
able form, which is not misleading. Again, the
precise form used varies with the data and tests
applied.

Symmetrical distribution
The data set is symmetrically 
distributed about its mean. 
The mean, median and mode 
of the data will be very similar. 
The distributions used to 
calculate significance are 
symmetrical (the normal, ‘t’ 
and chi-squared distributions, 
for example). Additionally if a 
large sample is taken, the 
estimates of the means of the 
sample will be normally 
distributed around the true 
population mean - this is the 
central limit theorem.
Positive skew
In positively skewed data the 
tail of the higher values is 
longer, which results in the 
mean value for the sample 
being greater than the median 
or modal values.
Negative skew
In this distribution, the tail of 
lower values is longer, which 
results in the opposite effects 
to a positive skewed 
distribution: the mean value 
for the sample is likely to be 
lower than either the median 
or the mode.
Bimodal distribution
In this distribution there are 
two ‘peaks’ in the data. This is 
likely to reflect two underlying 
distributions within the 
population. For example, in 
leukaemia there is an 
increased incidence in 
childhood and in old age, 
though fewer cases in the 
middle-aged, which will give 
rise to a bimodal distribution.
Uniform distribution
In a uniform distribution the 
frequency is the similar 
throughout the data set.
J-shaped distribution
This is an extremely 
asymmetrical distribution of 
data, where the frequency 
increases (or decreases) 
throughout the dataset.
Figure 18.1 The data in a sample can be distributed in a number of different ways. Although the precise distribution
of the data depends on random sampling, various underlying distributions are commonly identiﬁed.

Statistics

Frequency and frequency
distribution
Having collected the data, it needs to be recorded
on a form that is easily viewable and can allow
trends to be identiﬁed. One of the ﬁrst processes
applied is to look at the frequency distribution
of the data – how often a speciﬁc characteristic or
range of values occurs.
Qualitative data
Analysing qualitative data is usually achieved
by counting the number of observations in each
category – determining the frequency. This can
often be presented as a relative frequency, the
percentage of the total number of observations
in each category. Common representation of such
data is by pie chart or bar chart.
Quantitative data – frequency
distribution
A frequency distribution often provides a good
starting point for the analysis of quantitative data.
This involves determining the frequency of values,
or ranges of values within the sample:
. For discrete values, the frequency of each value
can be calculated.
. For continuous values, the frequency for a range
of values must be determined. This approach can
be applied to discrete values, if they occur over
a particularly wide range of values.
To determine a frequency distribution the high-
est and lowest values must be determined and
suitable groups should be deﬁned. If too many
groups are determined the data become difﬁcult
to process, whereas if too few groups are used,
much of the detail of the distribution may be lost.
When deﬁning the groups, there should be no gaps
between them.
Histograms are usually used to represent fre-
quency distribution. In a histogram, the area of
each bar is proportional to the frequency. For ease
of representation, the widths of each group are
usually the same, which ensures that the height of
each bar becomes proportional to the frequency.
Frequency distribution curves
As the size of the sample grows, the groups can be
made narrower to provide more detail. If this was
taken to its limit (the whole population sampled
and very narrow group ranges drawn), a smooth
curve could be drawn for most variables. The
typical distribution of a continuous value is
one with the highest frequencies in the centre of
the distribution, and with the frequencies decreas-
ing
at
the
extremes.
Three
variants
of
this
unimodal distribution occur (Fig. 18.1):
. A symmetrical distribution is one where the
highest frequency is located in the centre of
the distribution, and the frequencies decrease
evenly at both ends, resulting in a bell-shaped
curve.
. A positively skewed distribution occurs when
the upper tail of the distribution is longer than
the lower tail.
. A negatively skewed distribution occurs when
the lower tail is longer than the upper.
Other distributions of data can occur:
. Bimodal distribution occurs when there are two
high-frequency peaks. Such a distribution is
usually indicative of two separate distributions
within the data-set.
. A uniform distribution occurs when the variable
measured has no relationship with the out-
come being tested. As such there are no discern-
able peaks and troughs in the distribution.
. A J-shaped distribution.
Means and variance
Although the frequency distribution can be used as
a good starting point, it provides little indication
for the comparison of data sets. Two measure-
ments can usually accurately summarise a fre-
quency distribution:
1 An average value of the data-set
2 A value indicating the spread of values in the
data-set.
Averages
Three different averages are commonly used in
analysing data, in a symmetrical unimodal data
set; the values are likely to be very similar, although
in other distributions there may be large differ-
ences between the three:
1 The arithmetic mean (x) is the sum of all the
values, divided by the number of values.
2 The median is simply the middle value of the
distribution. If the distribution is ordered in an
Statistics 521

increasing list, it would be the middle value.
Median ¼ (n  1)th value in an ordered list
of observations, where n is the number of
observations.
3 The mode is the value that occurs most often.
Measurements of variation
The simplest assessment of the variation in a sam-
ple is simply to take the largest and smallest values
in the sample – the range. However, it gives no
indication of how the values are spread within
the range. In addition, it is likely that the range
will increase as the sample size increases.
The variance is commonly used to assess the
spread of data. This assesses the spread of the
data relative to the mean of the sample. This as
expressed as the sum of the squares of the differ-
ences between the sample value and the mean,
divided by the number of samples (n), minus 1.
The denominator N  1 refers to the degrees of
freedom within the sample. Within a sample, the
sum of all the deviations must be 0, because only
N  1 values are unknown and the last valuecan be
calculated because we know that the sum of the
variances must equal 0.
Although the variance is a useful statistical tool,
it takes the sum of the squares of the deviations,
and, as such, provides a very large number; for
many analyses, it is more convenient to express
the standard deviation, which is the square root of
the variance. In many distributions, the standard
deviations can be used to assess how much of the
sample is likely to be close to the mean. In a normal
distribution, 70% of the values are likely to be
within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and
approximately 95% of observations are likely to lie
within 2 standard deviations.
The standard deviation (SD) is sometimes ex-
pressed as a percentage of the sample mean. This is
convenient when the size of variation relative to
the sample mean is of interest. In addition it is
a value that is independent of the units used. This
value is referred to as the coefﬁcient of variance.
The standard error
If many different samples are obtained from the
same population, it is likely that each sample mean
is closer to the mean of the population than any
individual measurement. If a frequency distribu-
tion of these sample means is produced, the stan-
dard deviation of these sample meads is the
standard error of the sample mean. As a measure
of how closely the population mean is estimated by
the sample mean, it is affected by two factors:
1 How much variation there is in the population
2 The size of the sample – the larger the sample the
smaller the error.
Interpreting a sample mean is likely to be similar to
that for a standard deviation. About 95% of the
means obtained by repeated sampling of the same
population are likely to lie within two standard
errors of the population mean. This is used to
construct a range of likely values for the population
means, known as a conﬁdence interval and is
expressed as the observed sample mean and its
standard errors.
Sampling from a ﬁnite population
When a large proportion of the total population is
sampled, the sampling variation is likely to be
considerably smaller than calculated by the stan-
dard error. For example, if the entire population is
sampled, the variation between the sample mean
and the population is 0, because they are one and
the same. In samples where a large proportion
of the population has been measured, a ﬁnite
population correction can be applied:
FPC ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
N  n
N  1
r
where FPC is ﬁnite population correction, N is the
number in population and n is the number in the
sample.
This correction has little effect unless at least
10% of the population have been sampled.
The normal distribution
Many continuous values can be described by the
normal distribution, which is a symmetrical, un-
imodal frequency distribution. The curve may be
shorter and fatter for larger standard deviations, or
taller and thinner for small deviations. The stan-
dard deviation is assumed for many statistical
techniques applied and forms the basis of many
tests of statistical signiﬁcance. In practice, all nor-
mal distributions are transformed to the standard
normal distribution for analysis. This is a normal
distribution with a mean of 0 and with a standard
deviation of 1. The relationship between the stan-
dard normal distribution and a curve with mean m
and standard deviation s is.
522
Statistics

This transformation allows a single table of
probabilities (for the standard normal distribu-
tion) to be applied to all samples that are normally
distributed.
Transforming a distribution to the
standard normal
If the units or the base point of observations
changes it affects the mean and the standard
deviation in different ways:
. Adding or subtracting a constant affects the
mean by the same amount, although the stan-
dard deviation is unaffected (the deviation from
the mean of each value is unchanged).
. Multiplying or dividing alters both the mean and
the standard deviation in the same way.
Probability density function
In the normal distribution the area under the
curve represents the proportion of values that fall
within the speciﬁed range of values, e.g. in a curve
where the mean is x and the SD is s, the proportion
of people expressing a value greater than A can be
demonstrated:
The number of standard deviations
from the mean ðZÞ ¼ x  A
s
:
The proportion of samples exceeding this value
can be found by looking at a table of printed values
(Table 18.1). This value is denoted as FðzÞ.
Table 18.1 can be used the opposite way round, in
that one can calculate at which value only 5% of the
population exceed the value. This is done by ﬁnding
the closest value to 0.05 (or 5%) and identifying the z
value required (in this case 1.64). The corresponding
value is found by inverting the deﬁnition of the
standard normal distribution. This is denoted
as F  1ðFðzÞÞ. In most statistical analyses, a 95%
signiﬁcance level is required, which is equivalent
to 1.96SD.
Percentage points in the normal
distribution
Most statistical tests check whether the value
found is within or outside speciﬁc limits. In
most cases the level deemed statistically signif-
icant is 1.96 SD. At this level 5% of the distribu-
tion lay more than 2 SD (2.5% in each tail) from
the mean.

Conﬁdence intervals
Conﬁdence intervals are calculated to tell us the
likely values of the population mean, and can be
calculated using the sample mean and the stan-
dard error.
For a large sample (>60 observations), it is likely
that the distribution of the sample means is normal
and the sample SD is likely to reﬂect the population
SD. From the normal distribution, we know that
95% of the sample means lie within 1.96 SD of the
population mean. As a result, this can be used to
calculate a range of values in which the population
mean is likely to lie, based on the sample mean and
its standard error. This is used to set conﬁdence
intervals, the upper and lower bounds at which the
population mean is likely to lie. These are typically
calculated as 95% conﬁdence intervals (i.e. 1.96
standard errors); however, any values can be cal-
culated
by
selecting
an
appropriate
z
from
Table 18.1.
Calculation of conﬁdence limits in small
samples
If a sample is small (fewer than about 60 samples),
two aspects may affect the use of the normal
distribution
1 The sample SD, s, is subject to sampling varia-
tion and is not representative of the population
SD, s.
2 The distribution of the population is not normal,
and the sample mean may also not be normal.
This can be overcome by the central limit
theorem.
DEFINITION The central limit theorem
This states that, even for a non-normally distributed
sample, the sample means will be normally distrib-
uted about the population mean. Provided that a
sample is large enough (usually at least 15), the
sample means will give a close approximation to a
normal distribution.
As such by taking many samples from the pop-
ulation and then comparing the means of these
samples, one can approximate the population
mean. As a result forany population and hypothesis,
provided that the experiment is well designed,
a normal distribution (or a variant of it) can be
used to test whether there is a statistically signiﬁcant
result.
The use of s as the normal distribution often
invalidates the use of conﬁdence intervals; instead
the student’s t-test distribution can be used in
most cases, unless the population is extremely
non-normal.
The t-test distribution
The frequency distribution in the t-test distribu-
tion is extremely similar to the normal; however it
is more spread out at the tails. The shape is deter-
mined by the degrees of freedom (n  1) of the
sample SD – the fewer the degrees of freedom, the
more spread out the sample is.
By accounting for the degrees of freedom, the
t-test distribution can be used to calculate conﬁ-
dence intervals. For small numbers of degrees of
freedom, a value generated by the t-test will be
much larger than the corresponding value from
a normal distribution; however, for larger sample
sizes the t-test distribution approximates extreme-
ly closely to the normal distribution. When there is
an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, the
normal and t-test distribution are identical.
Extremely non-normal distributions
Where data are not normal, the data are often
transformed on to another scale so that a normal
distribution can be applied. Alternatively, a non-
parametric conﬁdence interval can be calculated.
This procedure is complex and beyond the scope of
this text.
Signiﬁcance tests
The simplest test that is regularly applied to data is
to ask whether a sample mean is consistent with
a hypothesised value for a population mean. This is
usually achieved using a paired t-test, although it
can also be achieved by the one-sample t-test and
the normal test.
The paired t-test
This tests whether the difference between a pair of
variables measured on each individual is 0, e.g. the
effects of a drug on an individual compared with
the administration of a placebo on the same indi-
vidual at a different time. If the drug has no effect,
the value measured should be no different from
the placebo – differences seen should be down
to chance variance. As the means measured are
unlikely to be exactly the same, it is essential to
524
Statistics

determine whether any difference seen is due to
this chance variance or whether there is a signif-
icant difference as a result of taking the drug.
The ﬁrst step is to draw up a hypothesis ‘that
there is a difference between taking the drug
and the placebo’. A null hypothesis is also pro-
duced that ‘there is no real difference between
taking the drugs and the placebo’. If the null
hypothesis were true we would expect a mean
difference of 0. The aim is to reject the null
hypothesis (that any differences seen are due to
chance variation), in favour of the hypothesis that
there is a real effect.
We know that the difference in hours slept is
likely to be normally distributed about the mean.
The null hypothesis is that the population mean, m,
is 0. We apply the t-test as follows:
t ¼ x  m
s=
ﬃﬃﬃn
p
The resulting ‘t’ value is compared against a
series of printed values (Table 18.2). For this the
number of degrees of freedom must be calculated,
and is (n  1). Table 18.2 indicates within what p
value a speciﬁc ‘t’ is for a given number of degrees
of freedom.
The smaller the signiﬁcance level, the more
signiﬁcant a result – in practice a probability smal-
ler than 5% is said to be signiﬁcant. A probability
greater than 5% is said to be non-signiﬁcant,
but there is no strong evidence against the null
hypothesis being true.
Having established an effect, we can use a 95%
conﬁdence interval to calculate the range of values
in which the true mean of the effect of the drug is
likely to lie. Conﬁdence intervals and signiﬁcance
tests are often closely linked:
. Conﬁdence intervals give the range of values for
a unknown population mean, which are consis-
tent with the data gathered
. Signiﬁcance tests assess whether data are con-
sistent with one hypothesised value.
If a result is signiﬁcantly different from the
hypothesised value at a particular signiﬁcance
level, the corresponding conﬁdence interval will
not include this value.
One-sided and two-sided tests
In most tests discussed so far, the null hypothesis
is that ‘there is no difference between the popula-
tions’. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a
difference. As a result there is no direction of the
difference hypothesised, so a two-sided test must
be used, and the intervention may make the

condition worse or better and the probabilities of
both extremes must be included.
If we have strong reasons to believe that a drug
would work one way or the other, a one-sided test
can be applied. In this case, we would hypothesise
that the intervention either improved or worsened
the condition, but not both. If we hypothesised that
a drug improved a condition, any decrease in the
group would be attributed to chance. The signif-
icance would be based solely on the upper tail of
the t-test distribution
A one-sided test may be tempting to use, be-
cause it is more likely to give a signiﬁcant result;
however, by the same token, it is also more likely to
inappropriately reject the null hypothesis and in-
validly accept the alternative hypothesis.
A one-sided test should be used with clear jus-
tiﬁcations, which are clearly stated and before the
data are collected.
One-sample t-test
The one-sample t-test tests whether a sample
mean is different from a speciﬁed value, which
does not need to be 0. Its formula is:
t ¼ ðx  m1Þ
s=
ﬃﬃﬃn
p
Once again a range of p values can be calculated
from the standard tables (Table 18.2), because
it follows a t distribution with (n  1) degrees of
freedom. In effect, the paired t-test is a speciﬁc
form of the one-sample t-test in that it is assumed
that the mean tested is 0.
Normal test
When testing the mean of large samples, or when
the population SD is known, the normal test can
be applied instead of the t-test. The form is
identical to that of the t-test, although different
tables are used. This is commonly known as the
z-test.
Errors in testing
Using statistics minimises the risk of an inaccurate
interpretation of the data; although it is impossible
to eliminate that due to sampling variation,
a signiﬁcant result is actually the result of chance,
or when there is no signiﬁcant difference in
the sample mean, which is actually drawn from
a signiﬁcantly different population. These are
known as the type I and type II errors (Fig. 18.2):
. Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis
is incorrectly rejected. The probability of this
occurring is the probability that is gained from
the distribution tables, i.e. testing at a 5% signif-
icance level (p ¼ 0.05) suggests that there is a 95%
chance that a sample mean is different from
a population mean. In the same way there is
a 5% chance that the mean is in fact drawn from
the same population.
. Type II errors occur when the null hypothesis is
not rejected or when it is actually false. This is in
effect the region of the sample distribution within
which the range of the conﬁdence intervals of the
population mean falls. The lower the signiﬁcance
level, the greater the probability of rejecting the
null hypothesis as a result of the lower likelihood
of making a type II error. Conversely, if the sig-
niﬁcance level is increased, there is an increased
likelihood of a type II error, although the potential
for a typeIIerrorisreduced.Theprobability thata
type II error is not made (p ¼ 1  b%) is referred
to as the power of the test.
Comparison of two means
Commonly we compare two distinct groups, such
as the blood pressure of one group of individuals
taking one form of blood pressure medication,
with that of another group on a different medica-
tion. The calculations are similar for those used in
one-sample tests; however, there is the additional
assumption that the two population standard de-
viations are equal.
The sampling distribution
of two means
The difference between two means of independent
samples will be normally distributed if the means
of each sample are normally distributed. As a result
the null hypothesis is that m1  m2 ¼ 0, whereas
the alternative hypothesis is that m1  m2 6¼ 0. The
standard error is based on a combination of the
standard errors of the individual means:
. The normal test is applied when large samples
are known or if, rarely, the population standard
deviations are known. Similarly the conﬁdence
interval for the samples can be calculated.
. The t-test is applied to small samples. In
addition, the t-test requires that the standard
526
Statistics

deviations of the two populations be the same.
This can usually be assumed. In the case of the
t-test, the degrees of freedom can be calculated
as n1 þ n2  2. Again, a 95% conﬁdence interval
can be calculated.
. If the samples are small and the standard devia-
tions of the population unequal, a change of scale
should beconsidered toovercome this. However,
if this is not possible, a non-parametric test or
a Fisher–Behrens or Welch test should be con-
sidered, all of which are beyond the scope of
this book.
Analysis of variance – the
comparison of several means
Many data-sets have more than two groups that
need analysis. Although it is possible to perform
many t-tests, each time comparing two groups, in
practice this is not done because it is likely to yield
inaccurate results – if a 5% signiﬁcance level is
used, 1 in 20 of the tests is likely to be signiﬁcant
even if there are no real differences.
Instead, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
is used to compare many groups in one go –
although the computations used are complex
and usually calculated by computer, a brief out-
line of the theory behind the test is illustrated
below.
One-way analysis of variance
A one-way ANOVA can be used to test the means of
several groups in which all the groups are classiﬁed
by asingle variable (e.g. the number of people). The
basis of the test is comparison of whether the
overall variation in the data are the result of differ-
ences between the means of the groups, and
comparing this with the amount of variation that
occurs due to differences between individuals in
the same group.
The one-way ANOVA is in effect an extension of
the two-sample t-test, when there are two groups
with exactly the same results.
The starting point for an ANOVA is to determine
the variance of all observations (irrespective of
subgroup). The sum of the squared deviations
from the overall mean divided by the degrees of
freedom. This sum of squares is made up of two
components:
1 The sum of squares due to difference between
group means
Type I error
A Type I (α) error occurs when the null 
hypothesis is rejected when it is true. The size 
of the error is determined by the level of 
significance. For example, at p=0.05 this is 
the probability at which the null hypothesis is 
rejected.
Type II error
A Type II (β) error occurs when we do not 
reject the null hypothesis when it is false. In a 
normally distributed group, this is the 
probability that the sample mean of the test 
group could fall below the significance level 
determined by test (this value is referred to 
as β). If such a result were to occur, the 
alternative hypothesis would be incorrectly 
rejected.

2 The sum of squares due to difference between
the observations within each group – the resid-
ual sum of squares.
The mean square is then calculated – this is the
amount of variation per degree of freedom.
The signiﬁcance (F test) compares the mean
squares between groups with the mean squares
within groups. If the observed differences were due
to chance variation, the variation between group
means would be similar to the variations between
individuals in the same group. However, if there
were real differences, the between-group variation
wouldbefarlarger,becausetheyarenotdrawnfrom
the same underlying population. As a result the F
test is often referred to as the variance ratio test.
There are two assumptions made in an F test:
1 The data are normally distributed.
2 The population value for the SD between indi-
viduals is the same for each group.
There are more complex forms of ANOVA, which
are used to analyse data classiﬁed in two ways.
They can be deﬁned into several categories; the
categories are summarised below, although they
are not discussed in detail.
. Balanced design – there are equal numbers in
each group. These are further divided to those
experiments in which there is more than one
observation per group (balanced design with
replication) and those in which there is not (bal-
anced design without replication).
. Unbalanced design – there are different numbers
of observations in the groups.
Correlation and linear regression
Often two values are compared and it is important
to determine the association between two vari-
ables, in two manners (Fig. 18.3):
1 Correlation determines how closely related the
two values are to each other.
2 Linear regression gives the equation of the
straight line that best describes the relationship
between the two sets of values.
Correlation
Correlation is expressed as r, the correlation coef-
ﬁcient. It is calculated by comparing the change in
each variable, related to the change in both. Math-
ematically, this can be expressed as:
r ¼

PX2  ðPXÞ2
N
PY 2  ðPY Þ2
N

s
The resulting value for r can be explained ideally
in three states:  1, refers to a perfect negative
correlation, with one value X increasing as the
other, Y, decreases. At 0, there is no relationship
between X and Y; þ 1 indicates that an increase in X
sees a corresponding increase in Y. The correlation
does not tell us anything about the underlying
cause of the correlation (i.e. does X cause the
change in Y or vice versa?), or they may both be
different readouts of an underlying cause. In prac-
tice there is not a perfect relationship, and this
results in a positive or negative value between  1
and þ 1, which implies a degree of correlation.
Signiﬁcance of correlation
A t-test can be used to test where r is signiﬁcantly
different form 0 (no correlation). This signiﬁcance
is determined by both the correlation coefﬁcient
and the size of the sample used to calculate it – a
large sample may produce a signiﬁcant correlation
even if this appears weak (i.e. close to 0), whereas a
seemingly strong correlation based on very few
observations may not be signiﬁcant statistically.
Linear regression
Linear regression gives the equation of the line that
best describes the correlation between the x and y
axes.Inalinearregressionyisdescribedintermsofx:
. x is termed the independent, or explanatory,
variable.
. y is termed the dependent variable.
This is important in terms of the explanation, e.g. we
wouldwanttoexplainthedependenceofheartrateon
ageasopposedtothedependenceofageonheartrate.
A regression line has the form y ¼ a þ bx, where
a is y  bx, and in which a is the value of y if x ¼ 0,
and b represents the proportionate increase of the
value of y, for each increase in x. It will have the
same sign as the correlation coefﬁcient. As with
other tests, the standard deviations of the sample
points can be calculated because the values of a
and b calculated from the samples are estimates of
the population values.
Assumptions
The two major assumptions made during a regres-
sion analysis are:
528
Statistics

1 that both variables are normally distributed
2 that the magnitude of the scatter of the points is
the same throughout the line.
Non-linear regression (e.g. of the form y ¼
ax2 þ bx þ c) can also be calculated, although
this is beyond the scope of this book.
Testing qualitative data – the
chi-squared test
When qualitative variables need to be compared in
two independent groups, we may need a statistical
method to see if a similar proportion has a speciﬁc
characteristic, e.g. in people who do or do not
smoke we could look at the proportion who have
had myocardial infarctions.
In this case we would use a chi-squared test. For
this the data are obtained as frequencies (the
numbers with or without the characteristic in each
group) and they are entered into a contingency
table that shows the observed (O) frequency:

Correlation
When comparing two sets of data from a sample, we would look to see if there is a correlation between 
the two – is a high value in one set of data likely to correlate with a high value for a different variable?  
The nature of this relationship can be defined by a regression line – this is a line of best fit which 
mathematically approximates the relationship between the two variables.
No correlation
If the two values are 
unrelated, then there is no 
correlation, and when plotted 
against each other, are 
unlikely to show any clear 
pattern. A regression line 
does not provide any 
additional information as 
there is not relationship that 
can be defined.
Positive correlation
Here, a high value of one 
variable is likely to be related 
to a high value of another 
variable (e.g., blood pressure; 
likelihood of heart disease). 
The relationship between the 
two variables can be 
approximated by the 
regression line.
Negative correlation
Here high values of one 
variable are likely to be 
related to low values for the 
other variable. Again, a 
regression line can be 
plotted.
Figure 18.3 Two variables taken from the same individuals can be plotted together to identify any relationship
between the two – the correlation between the two variables (r2) can be described between  1 (perfect negative
correlation) and þ 1 (perfect positive correlation); if the correlation is 0, there is no relationship between the two
variables.
Statistics 529

This is then compared with the values that
we would expect, i.e. what we would see if there is
nodifferencebetweenthe groups.This iscalculated
from the overall proportion of the characteristic:
P ¼ A þ B
N
Such that the expected (E) frequencies are
N1  P and N2  P, respectively.
The chi-squared test is then performed on each
of the four cells in the table comparing the ob-
served and expected frequencies to obtain c2, the
test statistic:
c2 ¼

The c2 values are then compared against the
probability distribution (Table 18.3) with 1 degree
of freedom and the conﬁdence intervals calculat-
ed. At 95% these are:
ðp1  p2Þ  1:96

Testing qualitative data for more
than two groups
The chi-squared test can be applied to large
numbers of independent groups for large numbers
of characteristics. Once again a c2 value is calcu-
lated from the sum of the differences of the ob-
served and expected values in each cell, although if
the table is larger than 2  2 a slightly different
formula is used:
c2 ¼
X ðO  EÞ2
E
The c2 value is then compared with the table,
and the number of degrees of freedom is:
ðNumber of rows  1Þ  ðNumber of columns  1Þ:
The p value is then calculated from Table 18.3, to
show the known probability distribution.
Assumptions
For a chi-squared test to be valid the following
assumptions are made:
. Each individual can be represented in only one
row and one column (i.e. all the categories are
mutually exclusive).
. Most (>80% of the frequencies) are 5. In a 2  2
table all frequencies must be 5.

Cohort and case–control studies
Many medical studies use either acase–control or a
cohort study. These are often used interchangeably
with prospective and retrospective, but the terms
are not equivalent.
A cohort study
In a cohort study a sample of individuals, some of
whom may be exposed to the risk factor(s) of
interest, are followed over a period of time and the
subsequent rates of disease occurrence compared.
For example, in a hypothetical example, a cohort
study may follow smokers and non-smokers as to
their likelihood of developing a condition, x, over a
deﬁned period of time. The occurrence of the
condition is assessed for both smokers and non-
smokers and is found to be 6.0 and 0.2 per 1000
respectively.
Relative risk
The relative risk (RR) gives an indication of the
strength of association between a risk factor and an
outcome. A RR is calculated by:
RR ¼
Incidence among exposed
Incidence among non-exposed
Using the examples above:
RR ¼ 60
0:2 ¼ 300:
An RR of 1.0 suggests that there is no association
between exposure and outcome. A risk of >1 sug-
gests that risk of disease is higher among those who
have been exposed. A risk of <1 suggests that
exposure is protective towards the outcome. In
this case someone exposed would be 300 times
more likely to develop the condition.
The signiﬁcance of the RR can be tested using a
2  2 chi-squared test, and the conﬁdence intervals
for the result can be calculated from the chi-
squared test.
Attributable risk
This gives an indication of the magnitude of
the risk in absolute terms by an individual who is
exposed to the stimulus in question.
AR ¼ Incidence among exposed 
Incidence among non-exposed:
Attributable risk is sometimes given as a propor-
tion:
PAR ¼ RR  1
RR
Population-attributable risk
The impact of a risk factor on the population
depends on the prevalence of exposure; a risk
factor with a strong association is unlikely to be
serious to a general population if the number of
people exposed is very small. However, a risk factor
experienced by a large proportion of a population
may be far more serious, even if the relative risk is
far lower. The resulting measure is the population-
attributable risk:
Population-attributable risk ¼
Overall incidenceIncidence among non-exposed:
Incidence rates and odds ratios
In a cohort study there is typically a gradual
accumulation of cases as the study progresses; as
a result a good measure of the rate of the disease
can be expressed as an odds ratio – the ratio of the
odds of getting the disease within the exposed
sample to the odds of acquiring the disease in the
non-exposed sample.
Case–control studies
In a case–control study, sampling is based on
the disease rather than exposure status. The
cases that have the disease are compared with
controls that do not have the disease, and the
study seeks to identify risk factors that are
associated.
No information from the case–control study
directly informs about incidence of exposed and
non-exposed populations; however, the cross-
product ratio of the case–control table estimates
the odds ratio:
. In rare disorders, this will be equivalent to
the RR.
