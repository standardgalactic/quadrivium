About the Authors
Craig Kent Gygi began studying and applying the elements of Six Sigma well before they
were formalized into today’s renowned breakthrough method. As an engineering graduate
student at Brigham Young University in the early 1990s, he integrated these then-unorganized
improvement techniques into his research and coaching of student product development
teams. Upon beginning his career in 1994 at Motorola’s Advanced Manufacturing Research
Lab in Florida, he was formally introduced to the just-formalizing Six Sigma method. It res-
onated deeply with his previous findings. From that time, Craig has applied, taught, and led
Six Sigma in all his endeavors, including management and technical capacities at Motorola,
Iomega, and General Atomics.
In 1998, Craig founded TolStack, Inc., to develop commercial Six Sigma software tools. He also
worked for several years as a technical colleague of Dr. Mikel J. Harry, the original consultant
of Six Sigma, co-developing and teaching new advances in its theory and application. In 2002,
Craig co-founded Savvi International, into which TolStack merged. Savvi provides solutions
for business performance improvement using Six Sigma, Lean, and Business Process
Management techniques. Craig acted as the director of Savvi’s products, service, and tools.
Today, Craig works with companies in the USA and internationally to integrate Six Sigma
practices directly into their core operations.
A Master Black Belt, Craig has wielded Six Sigma techniques now for over 13 years, spanning
projects from design to manufacturing to business management. He is also an expert teacher,
having instructed and mentored at all levels of Six Sigma, from executives to White Belts.
Bruce David Williams has been fascinated with complex systems since the launch of Sputnik
on his third birthday. With undergraduate degrees from the University of Colorado in Physics
and Astrophysics, he entered a career in aerospace systems, where he first encountered 
Six Sigma after Motorola won the inaugural Baldridge Award in 1988. Later, with graduate
degrees in technical management and computer science from Johns Hopkins University and
Colorado, and as a member of the Hubble Telescope development team, he was intrigued 
by how breakdowns in the smallest components could lead to colossal system failures. He
entered the Six Sigma industry for good in the mid-1990s when he founded a software com-
pany to pursue product life-cycle traceability.
Bruce has since been founder and CEO of two Six Sigma research and technology firms, and is
now Chairman and CEO of Savvi International, a provider of solutions for business perform-
ance improvement using Six Sigma, Lean, and Business Process Management techniques. He
resides in the highly-variable environment of the desert foothills of North Scottsdale, Arizona,
with his wife, two children, and a normal distribution of dogs, cats, birds, and horses.
Terry James Gustafson comes out of the world of business and finance, and brings a practi-
cal and entrepreneurial perspective to Six Sigma. After an undergraduate degree in finance
from Baldwin-Wallace, and an MBA degree from Kent State, he began his career in the field of
accounting with KPMG Peat Marwick in 1969, and advanced to a Partner position in auditing.
After leaving public accounting in 1990, Terry helped found, build, and operate a series of
technology-based entrepreneurial ventures, including venture-backed companies as well as
a public company. 
In 2002, Terry co-founded Savvi International, which provides solutions for business perform-
ance improvement using Six Sigma, Lean, and Business Process Management techniques.
Terry serves as Savvi’s chief finance and operations officer. 
Since founding Savvi, Terry has been immersed in Six Sigma techniques, helping to design
and develop Savvi’s training courses in Six Sigma and Lean. In addition, he has extensively
taught Six Sigma courses, both in a classroom and as an online instructor.

Six Sigma Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
S
ix Sigma is the single most effective problem-solving methodology for improving busi-
ness and organizational performance. There’s not a business, technical, or process
challenge that can’t be improved with Six Sigma. The world’s top corporations have used it
to increase their profits collectively by more than $100 billion over the past ten years. In
certain corporations, Six Sigma proficiency on your resume is now a prerequisite to moving
into a management position. 
If you’re part of a Fortune 500 company — particularly a manufacturing company — chances
are you’ve heard about Six Sigma. You may even have been through a training regimen and
been part of a corporate initiative or an improvement project. If so, you know the capabilities
of Six Sigma; you have witnessed its power and achievements firsthand.
But if, like most people, you’re outside of the upper echelons of big business, Six Sigma isn’t
well known. It has been too expensive and complicated for small- and medium-sized busi-
nesses, public institutions, not-for-profit organizations, educational environments, and aspir-
ing individuals. Its potential has remained out of reach for the vast majority of professionals
and organizations world-wide.
Fortunately, all this is changing. As the methods and tools of Six Sigma have spread, it has
become easier to understand, less expensive to learn, and more straightforward to imple-
ment. The mysteries of Six Sigma have been revealed.
Simply stated, Six Sigma is about applying a structured, scientific method to improve any
aspect of a business, organization, process, or person. It’s about engaging in disciplined data
collection and analysis to determine the best possible ways of meeting your customers’
needs while satisfying your own, and by minimizing wasted resources and maximizing profit
in the process.
About This Book
This workbook is unique. What used to only be available through expensive consultant-led
professional training is laid out in simplicity here. This workbook includes step-by-step expla-
nations and examples of the tools, methods, formulas, and tactics of Six Sigma. Exercises and
practice problems build your mastery in applying the tools and techniques. And ready-to-use
templates and worksheets provide you immediate access to the power of Six Sigma.
Corporate Six Sigma training also uses expensive calculation software like Minitab. Using
expensive calculation software is fine if your company can provide you with $1,000 software
programs, but everyone else is priced out. Not to worry! In this workbook, we’ve provided
all the formulas and calculations, so that with simple explanations, you can perform these
same calculations quickly by hand. The only price is the cost of this workbook (and a box of
Number 2 pencils!). Or you can automate them using your favorite spreadsheet software.
Together with the more conceptual Six Sigma For Dummies, Six Sigma Workbook For Dummies
truly forms a 2-volume box set for “Six Sigma in a box.” Just add a little practice, and you’re
ready to join the growing ranks of professionals who list Six Sigma as a critical competency to
their success. And be sure to keep a notebook handy for working out problems, as some of
them will require a bit more “scrap paper” than even a workbook can provide.

Conventions Used in This Book
Mathematical formulas and variables used in this workbook are written in an italicized
font. This will help you pick them out from the rest of the text and explanations.
What You’re Not to Read
Even after all the hard work we’ve put into this workbook, we don’t expect you to read
every word of it! Its purpose is application, so read only what you need to gain mas-
tery of the skill or topic. You don’t have to do every practice problem. We’ve included
several problems on each concept just in case you need the practice.
Foolish Assumptions
Six Sigma has a lot of math and statistics in it. We assume you’re familiar with basic
arithmetic operations — adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. At some points
it does get a little more complicated than that, but not much and not very often.
We also assume that you have a context in which to apply the tools and techniques of
Six Sigma. It may be a bona fide Six Sigma project you have been assigned to and are
working on. Or it may be an improvement effort of your own creation. Or it may even be
an aspect of your personal life you want to improve. In any case, as you read through
this workbook, try out the tools you’re discovering. It’s the quickest path to proficiency.
How This Book Is Organized
This workbook is organized along the lines of DMAIC — that’s Define, Measure, Analyze,
Improve, and Control — the problem-solving methodology of all Six Sigma thinking and
working. If you need help with a specific task, you can jump into the workbook at that
specific point along the DMAIC roadmap to get the focused practice or guidance you
need. Or, if you want to gain a comprehensive mastery of all the skills of Six Sigma, you
can follow through from the first page to the last.
Part I: Getting Started in Six Sigma
In Part I, you find guidance, checklists, and templates for organizing your launch into
Six Sigma. This part could be for yourself or it could be for getting an entire organiza-
tion ready to head down the Six Sigma path. From aligning with key business objec-
tives to forming a management communications plan, there’s a lot of preparation when
starting a breakthrough improvement journey.
Chapter 1 provides a first-hand, live introduction to the issues of variation and
improvement. Chapter 2 gives you tools and worksheets for forming and aligning the
improvement work with your organization’s key business objectives. Chapter 3 pro-
vides checklists, templates, and examples for setting up an organization-wide Six
Sigma program.

Six Sigma Workbook For Dummies 

Part II: Defining a Six Sigma Project
Part II is all about defining the improvement work you do in Six Sigma. If you’re start-
ing a Six Sigma project, this is the part for you. You practice generating viable project
ideas, find templates for scoping your work, and complete exercises for setting break-
through objectives and goals.
Chapter 4 contains examples and templates for correctly defining each Six Sigma proj-
ect. Chapter 5 gives you expertise in all the tools for identifying the potential causes of
poor performance. Going through Chapter 6, you discover how to whittle down a host
of potential causes to a handful of the “critical few.”
Part III: Mastering Measuring
Part III is full of exercises and practice for mastering the skills of measuring. If you don’t
measure it, you can’t know it. If you don’t know it, you can’t control it. If you can’t con-
trol it, you’re at the mercy of chance. And nobody wants to be in that position! 
In Chapter 7, you find exercises for discovering how to collect data and calculate its
statistical characteristics. Chapter 8 is a guide to the powerful skills of creating and
interpreting charts, graphs, and plots. The practice problems in Chapter 9 show you
how to measure the capability of your system or process.
Part IV: Assessing the Right 
Approach to Your Analysis
Understanding what your measurements mean is the focus of Part IV. In this part, you
find exercises that show you how to perform critical analyses of your collected meas-
urements, uncover root causes, and confirm hypotheses.
In Chapter 10, you find calculation templates for analyzing your measurement system.
Chapter 11 covers the topic of capability — you find out how to calculate whether
your process meets its performance requirements. Throughout Chapter 12 you prac-
tice calculating confidence intervals to statistically analyze differences among inputs
and outputs.
Part V: Improving and Controlling
The final stages of DMAIC are Improve and Control. Skills for synthesizing improve-
ments to solve problems can be mastered by anyone through the exercises and work-
sheets provided in this part. And you can’t neglect Control — be sure to become
proficient in the skills of controlling and maintaining the improvements you make.
Chapter 13 gives you the skills to quantify how one factor affects another. This is done
through correlation and curve fitting. Chapter 14 shows you all the aspects of design-
ing, conducting, and analyzing 2k factorial experiments. In Chapter 15, you practice cre-
ating Poka-Yokes, control plans, and statistical process control charts.

Introduction

Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this part, we provide you with two helpful top ten lists. Chapter 16 debunks the 
ten most common myths about Six Sigma and Chapter 17 lists the ten most critical
things to do to complete a Six Sigma project. And be sure to check out www.dummies.

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the workbook, you’ll see symbols in the margins called icons. These icons
highlight special types of information. When you see any of the following icons, this is
what they mean:
Each section of this workbook begins with a brief overview of the topic. After the intro,
you see an example problem with a fully worked solution for use as a reference when
you work the practice problems. You can quickly locate the example problems by look-
ing for this icon.
These are handy points that help you perform and apply some of the trickier parts of
Six Sigma more quickly and correctly.
This icon is used in almost every section of the workbook. It lets you know that the
associated text summarizes the key application principles, formulas, or procedures
needed for that particular skill.
When you see this icon, it alerts you to be aware of a particular risk or pitfall that
could cause you trouble.
Where to Go from Here
The beauty of a For Dummies book is that you don’t have to start at the beginning and
work your way through every page. Instead, each chapter is self-contained; you can
start with whichever chapter interests you the most and then jump to wherever you
want to go next.
Here are some suggestions on where to start:
 If you already have a Six Sigma project picked out or assigned to you, start in
Chapter 4. You’ll find practice there on properly defining your problem and its
intended solution.
 If you have a specific Six Sigma task to perform and just need some practice on
it, start in the Table of Contents. Find the topic you need and go to it. In no time
your skills for that task will be honed and ready to go.
 If you’re forming a Six Sigma initiative for your organization, start in Chapters 2
and 3.

T
he characterization, measurement, analysis, and control of variation is the central theme
of Six Sigma. Every process and every product is affected by variation. Variation —
within limits — is okay, and is even desirable. However, you can actually have too much
variation. If undesirable variation is out of control, failure is the result!
The key goals of Six Sigma are to fix undesirable variation, ignore variation that doesn’t
matter, and allow for variation that can’t be fixed. Many of the tools and techniques in this
workbook help you determine whether your variation is desirable or undesirable. These
tools also show you how to fix the variation that can actually be fixed, so that your efforts
are concentrated where you can make the most improvement impact.
Before you go any further in this workbook, however, you must accept two undeniable truths
about variation: Every output varies and every input varies. Don’t you feel better now that
you’ve accepted the fact that variation happens? It’s simply a fact of life. You can now focus
on finding and correcting as much of that variation as possible — making your processes 
and products the best they can be. Please also check out www.dummies.com/go/sixsigma
workbook for some useful forms you can print out.
Recognizing Variation around You
To get started recognizing the variation around you, use the variation journal in Figure 1-1
to chronicle the variation you encounter in a day of normal activities. Because you have
accepted that everything has variation, your daily journal could exceed the size of the
Library of Congress if you try to include everything that happens! Instead, try to concen-
trate on more significant events — events that, if impacted by unacceptable variation, could
have a negative effect on your life or job. Figure 1-2 is an example of the entries you might
make. Try to record at least 20 key items. As indicated on the worksheet, consider the type
of failure that the variation could cause, and whether the variation can be controlled.

Evaluating Variation and Business
Performance with Y = f(X) + f
The word “breakthrough” is bandied about all the time, particularly when advertising
some product — a breakthrough shaving system, breakthrough hair gel, a break-
through mousetrap, and on and on. So, you have to be a bit cautious when claiming
something is a breakthrough product. But, Six Sigma practitioners don’t hesitate to call
the basic equation, Y = f(X) + f, a breakthrough equation. When you apply the concept
that all outcomes (Ys) are the result of some number of inputs (Xs) that interact in
some way — f, or the function — to produce that outcome, and that there are always
some other factors, either known or unknown — f, or epsilon — that will impact the
outcome, then you are well on your way to breakthrough improvements.
The elegance of the Y = f(X) + f equation is that it applies to anything and everything —
from the simplest process, such as mixing a drink, to the most complex, such as build-
ing a space shuttle. After a process is broken down into primary elements, you can
then identify the desired outcome, find the inputs that contribute to that outcome,
identify those inputs that really matter, recognize where error and variation might
occur, and plan improvements that will have a positive impact. This workbook gives
you guidance in applying these concepts and conducting improvement activities.
Breaking down Y = f(X) + f
to a simple process
Following is an example of a simple process with which almost everyone is familiar —
cooking eggs. If you apply Y = f(X) + f to this process, the results look like this:
 Outcome (Y) — properly cooked eggs
 Inputs (Xs) — eggs, oil, heat, pan, timer
 Function (f) — shells are removed, oil is added to pan, eggs are placed in pan,
heat is applied for a specific time, eggs are removed
 Epsilon (f) — size of eggs, age of eggs, temperature of eggs, thickness of pan,
amount of heat, timer accuracy, type of oil, altitude
Some of these factors can be quantified and controlled, but others can’t. The trick is to
determine which, if any, of these inputs have a significant impact on the outcome and
can be controlled. One of the basic tenets of Six Sigma is focusing efforts only on those
inputs that have a substantial impact and that are practical to address. Time and
resources would be wasted if you tried to improve the egg-cooking process by chang-
ing the altitude!
Applying Y = f(X) + f: A practice example
As practice, apply the Y = f(X) + f equation to a more complicated process, one much
like many business processes. Think about the equation as you read the story about a
house fire on Elm Street. Then use the worksheet in Figure 1-3 to match elements of
the story to the components of the equation. Here’s the story problem:
9
Chapter 1: Getting Ready for Six Sigma: The Effects of Variation

A house catches fire on Elm Street and a neighbor calls 911 to report the fire and
give the address. The 911 operator triggers an alarm in the nearest fire station and
transmits the address. When the alarm sounds, the firefighters dress, load the
truck, and leave the firehouse. Using a current map and an established route plan,
they find and take the most direct route to Elm Street. Halfway to Elm Street, they
encounter a major traffic jam, which is normal for that time of day, and have to
detour. Shortly thereafter, a freak sleet storm forces the truck to slow to a crawl.
When the truck finally arrives, the men hook up the hoses, but find that water
pressure is low and that water flow to the fire is significantly less than normal.
Eventually the flames are extinguished, but only after the house is a total loss.
Fortunately, all the residents of the house escaped without injury.
From the perspective of the fire department, identify a primary Y, at least ten impor-
tant Xs, and the elements of error.
Figure 1-4 is a solution to the practice house fire exercise. Even if your solution
includes different items, it’s okay. You have at least started thinking how the break-
through equation applies to business processes.

Assessing the Impact of Variation 
on Business Performance
After you realize that variation is prevalent in all processes, you have to determine the
effect variation has on your process, and then you have to assess if it’s really a prob-
lem at all. After all, some variation is inevitable, and you can live with it, right? Well,
maybe, or maybe not.
Suppose you’re the general manager of Widgets International, the undisputed market
leader. You’re rightfully proud of your market position, and believe that producing the
highest quality widgets has lead you to where you are today. So, you’re taken aback
when an upstart Six Sigma Yellow Belt dares ask you about the true reliability of your
widget production process. “We produce the best darn widgets possible,” you retort.
“We just can’t do much to improve that process. Our rigorous assessments have deter-
mined that each and every step in the process is 95 percent reliable. Therefore, the
whole process is 95 percent reliable. How can we do better than that?”
The Yellow Belt persists, so you decide to humor her even though you’re confident 
in your figures. “How many steps are there in the production process,” she asks.
Consulting your most recent production chart, you answer, “We have a total of 20 dis-
crete steps.” The Yellow Belt then says, “Let’s do some calculations. If each of the first
two steps is 95 percent reliable, the chance of a widget making it through both steps
without a defect is 0.95 times 0.95, or 90.25 percent.” “Uhhh,” you respond eloquently,
“90 percent is still pretty good, right?” “Well, sure,” she says, “but we aren’t done yet.
The chance of a widget making it through the first three steps without a defect is 0.95
times 0.95 times 0.95, or 85.74 percent.” You begin to get a sinking feeling in the pit of
your stomach. Sweat begins to run down your face. You begin to see the big picture
and stammer, “Are you telling me that this calculation should be made through all 20
steps? What is the bottom line here?” She whips out her calculator and pounds in a
few numbers, and then she gives you the bad news: “Well, if each of the 20 steps is 95
percent reliable, the chance of a widget making it all the way through the process
without defect is 36 percent.”

Chapter 1: Getting Ready for Six Sigma: The Effects of Variation

You feel like you’ve been whacked with a 2 x 4. “How did you get so smart,” you ask
Miss Yellow Belt. “This type of analysis is called ‘rolled throughput yield, or RTY,’ and
is part of any basic Six Sigma training,” she replies. She again pounds her calculator
briefly and says, “And another interesting calculation we can make from this data is
Defects Per Unit, or DPU. In this case, the DPU is 1.02.” Now you’re really stunned. “So
what you’re telling me is that only about one-third of our widgets make it through the
process without a defect, and we can expect, on average, more than one defect per
widget? But I know from our latest production report that our final inspection is at 95
percent. Wouldn’t that mean we have a tremendous amount of expense, rework, over-
head, and excess inventory to make up the difference between the calculated 36 per-
cent rolled throughput yield and our observed 95 percent final inspection?” The Yellow
Belt smiled, “Now you know why I’m here.”
Finally, you ask the Yellow Belt, “Can you give me a template that I can use to calculate
these key ratios for other processes?” Figure 1-5 is a worksheet you can use to calcu-
late the RTY and DPU for your own processes.

 Selecting your implementation partners
B
elieve it or not, Six Sigma can be applied in several ways — not just at the executive
level of a major corporation. At the personal level, you can use the methods and tools
of Six Sigma in your everyday life and work to address personal and professional challenges
and to solve problems. At the team level, you can conduct formalized improvement projects
where a project leader — usually a certified Six Sigma Black Belt — leads a team through a
defined improvement process, which can improve a key metric by 70 percent or more. But,
at the organizational level, Six Sigma is deployed across your enterprise in such a way that
the projects and practices of Six Sigma become part of the organizational culture and func-
tional routine. This chapter helps you understand the activities and tasks needed to suc-
cessfully complete an organizational-level deployment initiative. You can also print out
many forms used in this chapter from www.dummies.com/go/sixsigmaworkbook.
A Six Sigma deployment initiative requires you to align both your business objectives and
your organizational framework in support of the management and operational methods of Six
Sigma practice. You must determine what you can and can’t do yourself and you must aug-
ment your resources with the right assistance to go forward. This chapter and Chapter 3
guide you through a deployment initiative. If you aren’t performing a deployment initiative
and are focused on Six Sigma projects, skip to Chapter 4.
Doing business the Six Sigma way is easier after you’re familiar with it. Six Sigma is like mas-
tering anything else: Until you figure out how to do it, it’s difficult. But after you’re comfort-
able, the task at hand is just so much simpler. For example, consider skiing. Before you
actually discover the key to skiing well, it’s all a struggle: You fight your way down the hill,
you teeter out of balance, and you exhaust yourself as you wrestle the laws of physics. But, if
you take a few lessons to really master skiing, what happens? Suddenly you find that doing it
right takes much less effort, and your performance and efficiency improve. Business works in
the same way: It’s difficult, but only until — with Six Sigma — you figure out how to do it
right, at which time it becomes much easier.
Planning Your Key Business Objectives (KBOs)
Six Sigma is the most powerful problem-solving tool in business because you won’t find a
problem or challenge area that can’t be improved significantly through the proper applica-
tion of Six Sigma methods and tools. But, don’t forget the risk of turning your team loose with
the Six Sigma arsenal: They can charge off and solve the wrong problems. Pursuing paths
that aren’t important is wasteful for any business. For example, your team would be wrong to
invest in improving the production quality of a product that the market doesn’t want or to
improve the sales efficiency for a product with negative margins.

You can find countless cases of what’s known as functional sub-optimization, which is
improving areas that don’t contribute to what’s most important. Obviously, improve-
ment is improvement, but in the Six Sigma world, the improvement has to really mean
something in the big picture, or it doesn’t count.
Your improvements must be tied to key business objectives (KBOs), such as growth in
market share, improvements in customer satisfaction, or reduction in product defects.
As you form your Six Sigma deployment initiative and develop a corps of Black Belts,
Green Belts, and other practitioners, you’ll be able to identify candidate projects for
Six Sigma improvement. But, before these projects are approved, they should be
vetted for alignment with your organization’s KBOs.
To ensure alignment with your objectives, you need to develop a system and, ulti-
mately, a culture, that looks at the bigger picture. If you do this, the projects them-
selves generate gains of significant organizational value, the staff becomes aware of
what constitutes alignment, and your company culture naturally and consistently
focuses on the principle of aligning efforts and performance with KBOs.
Establishing a KBO checklist
Your organization has KBOs, which are identified in places such as annual reports,
strategic plans, and operating plans at the organizational level, the business unit level,
and the functional level. These KBOs form the basis of your alignment efforts.
Your organizational KBOs may not necessarily be well-defined or even consistent. The
effort to define, optimize, and align KBOs across your organization is outside the scope
of a Six Sigma deployment initiative — but your alignment effort depends on them.
Going forward in your alignment efforts, you’ll constantly rely on a set of KBOs. Be
sure they’re the right ones.
Before performing the alignment exercise, be sure you have all of your company’s
KBOs in hand. These KBOs are sourced from several areas. Use the following checklist
to verify your KBO set:
❑Find out overall corporate goals. These goals are identified in annual reports,
corporate tag lines, missions, and vision and values statements. They’re also
articulated in speeches and position papers by key executives. Often, these goals
are not identified in measurable, objective terms. You may need to translate
amorphous goal statements into quantifiable metrics.
❑Find out Voice of the Business objectives (VOB). These objectives are defined in
operating plans, budgets, sales or other productivity targets, quotas, and other
operating parameters that reflect the goals of the organization. They’re in both
the core business product and service line areas as well as the support process
areas, such as IT, HR, Facilities, and Finance.
❑Find out Voice of the Customer objectives (VOC). These objectives, which are
critical to the success of your initiative, are typically expressed through the mar-
keting and research efforts that reflect the wishes of the market and of your cus-
tomers. Certain exercises in Design for Six Sigma (DFSS), which is the practice of
applying Six Sigma to designing products, services, or business processes,
strictly define quantifiable VOC measures.
❑Make sure objectives are consistent. Check to verify that your objectives are
internally consistent and prioritized and that they tie together logically. Make
sure that any inconsistencies have been addressed and rectified.
14
Part I: Getting Started in Six Sigma 

❑Make sure objectives are quantifiable. Be sure your objectives are in quantified,
measurable terms. They should be expressed numerically and in such a way that
the results of the projects can be measured and compared to the original values.
❑Make sure objectives are current. KBOs change and in some organizations they
change often! Put an update mechanism in place to ensure that you have the cur-
rent set in front of you.
Verifying your process alignment
With the definition of your key business objectives in hand, you now have the basis for
the future evaluation of your project goals and the verification that your process
improvement initiative remains aligned with what’s most important to the organiza-
tion. Alignment will be an ongoing cause-and-effect exercise, requiring you to under-
stand the Critical X’s that influence the Significant Y’s — or in other words, the KBOs.
Use the worksheet in Figure 2-1 to assist you in identifying KBOs. From sources includ-
ing your organization’s mission and vision statements, business unit operating plans,
and local functional unit plans, identify the key business objectives. Then, for each
objective, identify what quantifiable measure represents these objectives. Upon com-
pleting this table, examine the objectives and the metrics for alignment and consistency.

Chapter 2: Forming a Six Sigma Initiative

Determining the Proper Training Program
The first step in your deployment initiative is training. You must get your staff up to
speed on how to apply the methods and tools of Six Sigma. The training program
needs to be precise, and the various training courses need to be delivered in a specific
manner and order.
While the initial training period may last from months (for a small organization) to
years (for a large corporation or agency), a Six Sigma company never stops training.
The initial training for an organization of several hundred people, for example, could
be completed in less than six months. For a large corporation like Bank of America, or
a huge government agency like the U.S. Air Force, even the initial training can take sev-
eral years. But, all Six Sigma organizations, regardless of size, continuously follow up
with new courses, refresher training, and new-hire training. This section gives you a
rundown on how to proceed with your company’s own training.
Who will manage the training program?
You must determine who will be responsible for managing your company’s training
program. Each option in this decision has consequences in terms of the orientation,
consistency, and buy-in from your staff. The options include the following:
 The leaders of your profit and loss (P&L) areas and major functional organiza-
tions. Place the ownership of the training program directly within the P&L and
functional organizations if you want to orient the overall initiative more directly
at bottom-line performance. These organizations directly manage their work, and
by managing the Six Sigma training initiative, they focus more directly on results.
They can also tailor the training more specifically to their work area. The risks
associated with this option include inconsistency in training and some losses in
the economy of scale in the training program. But, most companies deploy in
this manner and have great success.
 The Six Sigma Deployment Leader, who typically reports directly to the CEO.
Have your Deployment Leader manage the training program if you want to cen-
tralize the training and keep it aligned directly to the overall initiative. If you use
outside trainers, the Deployment Leader will be in the best position to align the
training program with the company KBOs.
 In larger organizations, the training department. Some companies choose to
manage their Six Sigma training program from within their training department.
You may think that an in-house training department is the most logical option,
but that’s not necessarily the case! True, your training department is in the train-
ing business, but it’s best to manage the training program through your training
department only if you want to generalize your program into a more educational
and fundamental skills-based initiative.
Based on the nature of your organization and your goals, determine where you’ll 
base the management of your training program. Communicate this decision to the
stakeholders.
Finding the expertise within your organization
Many thousands of people have been involved in Six Sigma initiatives. As a result,
capable practitioners are showing up in organizations large and small across all 
16
Part I: Getting Started in Six Sigma 

industries and all around the globe. Chances are that someone close to you has knowl-
edge of Six Sigma initiatives.
Before you go any further in your deployment initiative, take the time to assess the
level of Six Sigma deployment initiative expertise in your organization. Using Figure
2-2, identify all individuals who have been formally trained in Six Sigma, and specifi-
cally document their roles, the number of projects they were involved in, and the
results they achieved. Meet individually or in a group with these individuals, and listen
to their Six Sigma stories. They will have experienced some form of Six Sigma training,
and, more importantly, they may be Green Belts, Black Belts, and perhaps even Master
Black Belts. If so, they’re capable of defining your program and even conducting some
training sessions. Enroll them in the process from this point forward.
Scoping the training program
Your Six Sigma training program is directly tied to performance. Trainees conduct proj-
ects and begin influencing your organization and returning results as part of their ini-
tial training regimen, and they continue onward after their training is completed. The
number of individuals practicing at the varying levels of Six Sigma capability within
your organization is directly a matter of how many are trained and active at any given
point in time. You must determine the scope of your training program, which means
you have to know the number of staff members who will be trained, the level of profi-
ciency they’ll be trained to, and in which functions of the organization they’ll be
trained in.
Because trainees have such a strong influence on behavior and performance, you must
scope your training program carefully. Overtraining results in hoards of practitioners
undertaking projects faster than they can be properly aligned, or — worse — results in
practitioners sitting idly awaiting quality projects. On the other hand, undertraining
means insufficient momentum, lost savings, and disenfranchised staff members.
To scope the program properly, note the roles filled in a Six Sigma enterprise:

Chapter 2: Forming a Six Sigma Initiative

 Executives participate in a workshop that explains the Six Sigma deployment
process, introduces the concepts used by practitioners, and develops the imple-
mentation plan.
 Senior managers participate in a workshop that, in addition to an overview of
the deployment process and practitioner concepts, sets out the implementation
plan and assigns the roles and responsibilities for each of the functional areas of
the business.
 Black Belts, as full-time Six Sigma practitioners, are dedicated to working on
projects that solve your toughest challenges. Black Belts are necessary only for
large and complex issues. Rarely does the Black Belt population exceed 1 to 2
percent of an organization’s total staff.
 Green Belts participate in Six Sigma projects on a part-time basis, either as lead-
ers or contributors. Anyone can be a Green Belt: staff, management, and even
executives! The Green Belt population is typically 5 to 10 percent of total staff,
but we’ve seen cases where an organization trains its entire professional staff.
Note: All supervisors and managers should be trained Green Belts.
 Yellow Belts may participate in projects, but the intention of training to the
Yellow Belt level is to develop working Six Sigma practices within the general
population. You may train 50 percent or more — even 100 percent — of your
staff to the level of Yellow Belt proficiency.
 Designers receive specialty training in a subject area known as Design for Six
Sigma, or DFSS. A Six Sigma deployment will include DFSS training for all designers.
 Master Black Belts act as hands-on experts, teach Six Sigma courses, and mentor
others.

The ranges indicated in Table 2-1 are typical, but not absolute because no set standard
exists. Your Six Sigma deployment initiative may vary because every organization is
different and each organization has its unique needs and drivers. The drivers that
affect your training regimen include:
 Breadth: How broad must you go in your organization to achieve the results
you’re looking for? If you’re looking for immediate tactical impact in a single work
area or line of business, you need only a small team of specialists. Conversely, if
you’re looking to change the company culture, you’ll want a broad initiative.
 Depth: How serious are your problems and how complex are your challenges?
The more complex and problematic, the more Black Belts you’ll need. However,
many companies operate at a level of complexity below the need for Black Belts.
Note that the Six Sigma training industry tends to overtrain.
Many organizations fail to recognize the level and importance of applying Six Sigma to
the many areas of design work in an organization. It’s not just the design of your prod-
ucts or services, but also the design of your systems, processes, and procedures.
Design for Six Sigma addresses all elements of the design process. Don’t shortchange
your initiative by undertraining designers in DFSS.
Your next exercise is to define the scope of the initiative within your organization.
Don’t worry about the timing and schedule of training at this point — just focus on the
overall scope. Using the worksheet in Figure 2-3, define the number of courses and
identify who you expect to undergo training at each level.
Recognizing cultural predisposition
Systems and organizations resist change. And some are more resistant than others.
Putting it the other way, some organizations are more ready, willing, and adaptable to
change than others. The degree of cultural predisposition toward or against a change
initiative like Six Sigma is a key factor in rolling out the training program. If you misjudge
the culture and implement the program the wrong way, your initiative may backfire.
Consider the following items when trying to decipher the cultural predisposition of
your organization:

Chapter 2: Forming a Six Sigma Initiative

 Urgency: How urgent is the business situation? How much does everyone share
that sense of urgency? The more urgent the business drivers, the more aggres-
sively you’ll want to implement the training program, celebrate early wins, and
stimulate the momentum that moves the key business metrics. Just remember
that in this approach, everyone has to be feeling the same degree of pressure.
 Complacency: How complacent is the environment? The more complacent the
environment is, the more tools you’ll need to stimulate change. These tools
include leadership and support, strong communications, the training of key indi-
viduals, strategic program wins, celebrated individual successes, and the use of
reward mechanisms.
 Resistance: How outright will the resistance be? What will be the basis for the
resistance? You may have staff members who were involved elsewhere in poorly
executed Six Sigma programs or who have otherwise heard negative things
about Six Sigma programs. You may have business unit leaders whose empires
are at risk once your Six Sigma program begins to shine light in dark places.
Often, the most vocal detractors become the most ardent supporters after
they’ve been through training and completed a project. Remember, to move a
distribution, you not only move the lead, but also the tail.
 Metrics-averse (a.k.a. “lazy”): Most pre-Six Sigma organizations prefer to com-
municate and base decisions on such notable tools as politics, opinion, tradition,
and intuition, as opposed to DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and
Control). Without the intellectual toolset of Six Sigma, it’s just easier to work and
think in terms of opinion and intuition. Depending on how deep-seated this cul-
tural tumor is in your organization, you’ll hear varying degrees of how difficult it
is to quantify and measure things.
Defining the training plan
You’ve determined who will manage the program, identified your organization’s inter-
nal capabilities, scoped the program, and assessed the cultural predispositions. Now
it’s time to define the training program plan. Follow these guidelines:
 Determine your training schedule. First, determine the order of your training
classes. Use the worksheet in Figure 2-4 as a guide. We’ve entered the typical first
set of courses and workshops, but the order and timing are up to you.
 Decide what facilities you’ll use. Training courses are usually conducted in
groups of about 15. Executive sessions may be smaller while awareness sessions
are larger events. In addition, you may be using an e-learning environment
(known as a Learning Management System, or LMS) for some of your training.
Often, Six Sigma training is held off-site, using the alternate venue psychology,
which means you take people out of their ordinary work environments and
accompanying mind-sets. The executive sessions may be held in a retreat envi-
ronment and the regular stand-up courses at a local hotel or training center. Of
course, you may also want to use in-house facilities.
Decide whether your Six Sigma training should be held on-site or off-site by con-
sidering how important the alternative venue psychology is to your addressing
your cultural predisposition factors.
 Choose your resources. Now it’s time to decide who will conduct your com-
pany’s Six Sigma training. Read on to find out how.

Part I: Getting Started in Six Sigma 

Deciding Who Will Conduct the Training
Until recently, the only viable option for Six Sigma training was to hire an outside train-
ing and consulting firm. Because of this, it was simply a matter of selecting the firm
that best met your requirements. This is no longer the case. Due to the growth of Six
Sigma across industry lines and coupled with the commoditization of material, you
now have choices.
That’s the good news. The bad news is that one of your choices includes conducting
the training yourself, which today is a viable option. Choosing to conduct the training
yourself means that you’re now facing the “Not Invented Here” syndrome and that
you’re confronting a classic Make/Buy decision.
You have four general options as to who will conduct the training:
 Contract a Six Sigma systems shop. These shops are comprehensive providers
that contract with you to do it all. They perform the training for all courses, both
in stand-up and e-learning mode, and they also provide consulting and mentor-
ing. If they don’t have the expertise in-house, they contract it for you. These
firms also provide or recommend the software tools — both their own and third-
party tools — and conduct applications workshops.
 Contract several boutique Six Sigma trainers. The Six Sigma industry has
numerous specialty trainers that focus on specific niches, such as Belt Training,
Design for Six Sigma, Executive Coaching, Project Management, and so on. Some
training companies focus on vertical markets, such as health care, financial serv-
ices, or manufacturing. With this boutique trainer approach, you hire the expert-
ise and buy the software you need, acting as the systems integrator to put the
pieces together.

Chapter 2: Forming a Six Sigma Initiative

 Hire on Six Sigma training expertise and buy materials. You’ll find many quali-
fied Six Sigma Black Belts and Master Black Belts available for hire. In addition,
several companies offer training materials for sale. You can hire the instructor
talent you need, buy the training materials, and do it all yourself.
 Hire on Six Sigma training expertise and develop materials. You can do this, if
necessary: Hire experts and have them develop a custom set of training materi-
als from a combination of books and other readily available sources of informa-
tion. You’re still likely to buy and not produce some of the software tools —
there’s no return on investment calculation that justifies developing your own
process modeling, portfolio management, or analytical software package — but
there may be a role for custom connectivity and reporting software.
In order to make the choices between these options, you apply the same decision
process you would apply for any development and staffing challenge: By considering
both the value of having this talent reside permanently within your organization as
well as the uniqueness of the need. Study Figure 2-5 to understand these tradeoffs. By
finding the quadrant that best fits your situation, you’ll understand whether to make
or buy your training talent.
Follow this checklist to determine which training option is the best fit for your 
organization:
❑Is your Six Sigma training regimen relatively typical or will it be uniquely different
from standard industry training? Will you need to extensively customize materials
before you use them, as opposed to effectively using the industry trainers and
materials already available in the marketplace? If you answered yes to either ques-
tion, you may need to interview some industry trainers and examine curriculum
materials to better qualify your company’s needs. Note, however, that most organi-
zations are fully satisfied with the industry’s standard curriculum.
❑Can contracted industry trainers effectively teach the material to your staff, or
do you want to have in-house staff trainers perform the instruction?
❑If your needs are so unique that standard training and materials won’t work for
you, and you want to have in-house trainers perform the instruction, hire (or 
use your existing) Black Belts and Master Black Belts. They can create custom
materials and train your staff.

❑If you need customized material, but believe that the average marketplace 
experience is sufficient, contract boutique firms and secure an experienced
Deployment Leader to be your systems integrator.
❑If your needs are standard and you can base your program on existing industry
materials, but you want in-house trainers to deliver the instruction, buy the
materials and have your instructors deliver the training.
❑If standard industry materials and trainers will work for you, and you want to
outsource your Six Sigma training program, contract with a systems shop.
Even if you’ve led or been part of a Six Sigma training initiative before, and you’ve
decided to take on the entire training initiative in-house, bring in an experienced
mentor — someone to act as a sounding board and who can provide you objective
opinions and advice. Whatever you do, don’t go down this path alone.
You need to consider the following concepts as you make your decision:
 Uniqueness of material: Every organization is unique in many ways — the
uniqueness is how the organization differentiates itself. But is your organization
so different that the fundamental methods and tools of Six Sigma must be exten-
sively modified and tailored before they’re applicable in your organization?
Probably not.
 Uniqueness of instruction: You may have unique deployment needs, such that
standard materials are applicable, but your instructional approach may need 
to be different. Perhaps you need a significant e-learning component, multiple-
language versions, or industry-specific instruction.
 Empire-building: The purpose of Six Sigma training is to educate and empower
your team with the methods and techniques of Six Sigma so that you can
improve the bottom-line performance of your enterprise. Be careful to avoid cre-
ating a self-serving Six Sigma training bureaucracy.
 Plethora of expertise: You can now readily hire industry-specific Six Sigma
experts who can effectively train your staff as well as immerse themselves as
practitioners in your business.
 Consultant-averse: Many organizations are culturally (and financially) opposed
to using outside consultants. Recognize, however, that not only is the cost of
training small compared to the value returned to the business, but also that
experience matters in Six Sigma.
 Material and instruction quality: Every Six Sigma training regimen has common
ancestry that traces back to Motorola in the 1980s, but not all material in the
marketplace has the same development and production quality. Instructional
design is a discipline all its own, but knowing the material doesn’t equate to
good material and instruction quality.
 Outsourcing: You can’t outsource leadership! Regardless of your approach, your
senior-most leaders and managers must be engaged intimately and they must be
the driving force behind the program and its progress. These duties can’t be con-
tracted, hired-out, or delegated.
After you’ve chosen your trainer, you’re ready to complete the training program make/
buy worksheet shown in Figure 2-6. For each category on the worksheet, select either
in-house or contract/procure.

Chapter 2: Forming a Six Sigma Initiative

Teaming for Success: Shopping for 
Your Implementation Partners
Now that you’ve decided what you’re buying from contractors, you’re ready to shop.
And lucky for you, like in any other established market, the Six Sigma training market-
place has a healthy selection. You’ll find a few great providers, many good ones, many
not-so-good ones, and a few really awful ones. It’s no trick to find the right partner, but
you need to know what to look for.
Six Sigma isn’t a regulated industry. You won’t find any IEEE or ISO standards or any
government, academic, or nonprofit regulatory bodies. It’s also not policed or reviewed
by a consumer watch group. Instead, it’s a cottage industry with a broad and loosely
defined set of conventions and practices. The uninformed buyer can waste consider-
able time and effort and go down paths that lead to frustration and loss. However, 
on the other hand, the informed buyer can make outstanding choices and reap quick
benefits.
The worksheet in Figure 2-7 guides you in selecting and evaluating your implementa-
tion partners.

Six Sigma training isn’t rocket science. Don’t let yourself be bamboozled or slick-talked
into anything by being made to feel uninformed, uneducated, or inferior. You’re the
buyer and you should shop for Six Sigma services just like you would shop for anything
else.
Pricing and Contracting Approaches
The Six Sigma training industry has experimented with a number of pricing and con-
tractual approaches — some of which succeeded while others failed. Consider the fol-
lowing options and decide which approach is right for you:
 Price per wave. This is the most common pricing approach. With this approach
you pay by the course, which is also known in the industry as a wave of stu-
dents. This approach is common enough that you can use it effectively as a basis
for comparison in both standup and e-learning environments.
 Time and materials. In this consulting-oriented approach, you pay for the time
and materials used by the instructor as he teaches the courses.
 Shared savings. In this model, which was first pioneered at General Electric in
the mid-1990s, the provider receives a percentage of the savings realized by Six
Sigma projects. This approach has the benefit of tying the provider’s efforts to
your bottom-line performance. However, the shared savings approach suffers
from potential challenges in accurately assigning value to the projects. This
approach may also allow providers to reap a tremendous bonus as a result of
your large savings.
 Volume discounts. In this approach, you pay less for each additional course or
service you use, based on a total volume of goods and services that you use.
 Expenses. As a rule, the customer pays all expenses for travel and incidentals
incurred by the providers. If you want to do this differently, you’ll be running
against the grain of the industry.
 Milestone-based. Because Six Sigma training programs are lengthy — lasting for
months and years — it’s commonplace for the program plan to contain review
points, or milestones, at which time performance and customer satisfaction are
assessed.
Establish your contracts with sufficient measurement points, metrics, and out-clauses.
If your first selected partner isn’t working out, don’t hesitate to make the change.

Leading and Managing 
a Six Sigma Initiative
In This Chapter
 Choosing a team to lead your Six Sigma initiative
 Understanding the importance of communication
 Working with a Six Sigma Management Plan
I
f you’re leading or participating in an initiative to deploy the knowledge and apply the
methods and tools of Six Sigma across your organization, this chapter, like Chapter 2,
helps you through the deployment process. Even if you’re not part of a formal deployment
initiative, and you instead simply intend to perform Six Sigma projects, don’t skip over this
chapter. You need to understand how Six Sigma is deployed. In this chapter, you figure out
how to form the team that leads and manages your initiative. Chapter 2 shows you how to
take aim — aligning the players and determining your implementation partners. Now it’s
time to fire — it’s time to begin the initiative deployment itself.
The word “maybe” doesn’t exist in a Six Sigma initiative. You can’t simply stick your toe in to
test the water (but, we guarantee that the uncharted waters are going to feel at least a little
bit uncomfortable!). After you start a Six Sigma initiative, you quickly pass the point of no
return. But the good news is that a well-proven and time-tested prescriptive formula for your
deployment is available. In this chapter, you apply this formula to your organization and 
situation, and as a result, you and your organization are well-prepared for the changes and
activities to come. Be sure to visit www.dummies.com/go/sixsigmaworkbook for some
useful forms you can print out.
Selecting Your Leadership Team
Your Leadership Team should have both the authority and responsibility to ensure that
everyone across the organization is properly empowered and supported throughout the life
of your Six Sigma initiative. This team is directly accountable for producing the results — 
the measurable, quantifiable, and significant improvements in key metrics and benchmarks —
through facilitation of the initiative process. The makeup of the Leadership Team defines
your success. Accordingly, you leave nothing in your initiative to chance — a few things are
left to random variation, perhaps, but none are left to chance — and neither should the selec-
tion of your Leadership Team.
Approaching the selection process
Part of the selection process is simple: Certain business unit leaders and executives are
members of the team automatically. These team members include those who own financial
responsibility and key functional processes, such as leaders and executives from the human
resources and information technology departments. However, another part of the process is

more complicated — particularly in the selection of the Deployment Leader and the
Senior Champion or Champions. You also select certain key stakeholders as members
of the Leadership Team. Careful selection of these stakeholders is important to the
success of your initiative.
Depending on the size of your organization, you may have a large Leadership Team —
a dozen or more — which is okay because the Leadership Team isn’t a deliberation
body that must reach consensus on difficult issues. The entire Team doesn’t even
always meet as a group. The Leadership Team is more of a SWAT team that fans out
across your organization — as well as across your various constituencies — to ensure
that your initiative deploys successfully.
Follow these three steps in your selection process:
1. Identify central organizational roles.
To identify these roles, begin by identifying the major direct and supporting
processes in the organization and the leaders or owners of those processes and
functions. These leaders include:
• All leaders accountable for financial performance. Because financial per-
formance areas are the most important target areas for Six Sigma process
improvement, these leaders are by definition part of the Leadership Team.
• All leaders of the major enabling process areas. Examples of these areas
include Finance, Accounting, Legal, Procurement, Human Resources,
Information Technology, Facilities, and other similar processes that enable
your core business processes. Identify these leaders in your organizational
structure. Also determine how budgets are assigned and how accountabil-
ity is measured.
2. Identify central Six Sigma initiative roles.
Here are the three such roles that are part of the Leadership Team:
• Communications Leader. Because communication is so vitally important
to a Six Sigma initiative, and because the initiative will have a communica-
tions plan, you may consider naming a specific individual to lead the com-
munications activities.
• Deployment Leader. This leader is the individual charged with ensuring
that the initiative is deployed across the organization per the deployment
plan. Even though this role is traditionally titled as a leadership role, it’s
more related to management than leadership.
• Champion. This is the true Six Sigma leadership role. The Champion is the
senior evangelist who must understand what Six Sigma can and can’t do.
This person must champion, or support, the initiative’s adoption.
3. Identify other key participants.
In addition to the organizational and Six Sigma initiative leaders, you may have
other key individuals who belong on your Leadership Team. Identifying these
other key individuals is critically important to your success, particularly where
change management is concerned. Additional stakeholders may include the 
following:
• An outside board member. Six Sigma is going to shake things up in your
company: Business will be done differently from now on, which results in
changes to the way you communicate the status and performance of your
company. If you need an advocate who can effectively “carry the water” 
for you to key shareholders, analysts, sponsors, donors, or other external
constituents, you want to include an outside board member on your
Leadership Team.
28
Part I: Getting Started in Six Sigma 

• An outside advisor. Your business will be different after Six Sigma. You may
modify organization structures, reporting alignments, and other internal
institutions. These changes impact the company culture.
Throughout the Six Sigma process, you may want to have an external 
advisor — someone who’s been through this process before. This outside
advisor is someone whom members of the Leadership Team can confide in
and seek advice and solace from. You should consider seeking an advisor
who isn’t part of your training team.
• Key suppliers. Your initiative will reach into your supply chain. In fact, you
may be implementing Six Sigma now because someone reached into his or
her supply chain, and there you were! Suppliers will be directly affected by
your initiative, so you may want to include them.
• Key customers. Why are you deploying a Six Sigma initiative in the first
place? To help serve customers better, of course! The direct beneficiaries
of your efforts certainly have a keen interest in how your initiative is
accomplished, so keep them informed.
• Social network leaders. Remember that all organizations have leaders who
don’t appear at the top of an organization chart. The cultural changes from
the initiative will affect areas of the organization that may be invisible to
the official leadership channels — so much so that you would be remiss 
if you didn’t recognize and include individuals who represent the social
organization.
• A training team leader. If you have selected an outside implementation
partner (see Chapter 2 for details), you may want to include a senior
member on your Leadership Team.
Many Six Sigma training and consulting firms are rich with statisticians, methodolo-
gists, analysts, and engineers, but are short on senior business leadership skills and
experience. For this reason, you have to be careful who’s chosen for your Leadership
Team. For example, your training partner may be an effective facilitator, but he may
not belong on your Leadership Team.
Membership on the Leadership Team isn’t optional. Everyone chosen must participate
because the initiative depends on the performance of every member of the organiza-
tion. All members must fulfill their roles and responsibilities, and the members of the
Leadership Team are no exception. The Team is only as strong as its weakest link.
Because full participation is crucial, many organizations modify the compensation
structure of the internal Leadership Team participants and apply incentives to ensure
that the job is taken seriously. These incentive changes include the top executives. It’s
not uncommon for organizations to tie a significant percentage — up to 50 percent —
of incentive compensation for their executives directly to Six Sigma performance
improvements.
Even if the top management fully supports the initiative as a group, not every individ-
ual will be on board. Six Sigma initiatives bring about bold change, which can worry
some top management team members. In its relentless pursuit of improvement, Six
Sigma shines bright lights into the dark corners of the enterprise where many senior
leaders have personal agendas hidden. The successful initiative finds those dark
places and exposes the agendas, which often become targets for improvement.
Use the worksheet in Figure 3-1 to make your Leadership Team selections.

Chapter 3: Leading and Managing a Six Sigma Initiative

Go, team: Unifying individuals 
to create a team
After you’ve selected the individuals for your team, you must forge a team out of them.
Unfortunately, individuals don’t spontaneously combust to create a team. Creating a
team takes work. The dynamics and psychology of teaming are a science and disci-
pline unto itself, and you should keep the following guidelines in mind:
 Rarely do teams come together simply because a leader calls them together. In
other words, simply declaring a group of individuals a team isn’t enough. Such
an occurrence would be a statistical oddity, for sure.
 Many times, certain members of the team will perceive a Six Sigma initiative as a
great risk to themselves or their constituents. These fears must be carefully
addressed or the team won’t come together.
 The team leader — usually the organization’s top executive — may not be the right
individual to energize and inspire the team. Recognize this fact and figure out how
to take the appropriate action, perhaps with the designated Senior Champion.
 Within teams, cooperation, coalitions, and dissent all change over time.
Communications and anticipative action are critical to maintaining team 
cohesiveness.

Implementing Your Communications Plan
Communications are the tugboats of change. They nudge your supertanker of an
organization to a new course and direction. In fact, many organizations have discov-
ered through their Six Sigma communications initiatives how to better communicate in
general. Without consistent messages, active listening, and strong reinforcements, no
regimen of training or army of consultants can align everyone in the same new way.
Communicating is easy but it’s also difficult at the same time. For example, communi-
cating is so easy compared to the vexing details of the business problems that it’s often
overlooked. The tools of communication are so routine that they’re often taken for
granted. The need for repetition is so fundamental to changing habits and behaviors,
and yet leaders often ignore it for fear of sounding redundant or pedantic. After the ini-
tiative feedback says that everyone’s tired of hearing about the new program, it’s often
toned down.
Because a Six Sigma initiative is a retooling of the thinking and behaviors of everyone
in the organization, communications are so important that they warrant plans, leader-
ship, and measurements all their own. Don’t underestimate the importance of manag-
ing communications.
Understanding the two communications plans
You actually have two communications plans to choose from for your Six Sigma initia-
tive. The Deployment Initiative Communications Plan identifies and directs how every-
one in the organization knows what is occurring during the life cycle of the program.
Communications are occurring in all directions: from the top-down and bottom-up,
internally and externally, laterally, and informally and formally. With this plan, you
ensure that all these channels and forms of communication are enabled and active.
The second type of plan is the Project Communications Plan. Because projects are the
critical implementation tools of a Six Sigma initiative (see Chapter 4 for more on project
tools), they warrant a communications plan all their own. Each project team adheres to
the protocol as called for in its Project Communications Plan to ensure that the activi-
ties, resources, and focus of the project team are reaching the intended results.
Together, these two communications plans serve as the basis for applying the many tools
of Six Sigma management to build momentum and sustain progress. By working with
these plans, you can keep everyone aligned, confirm key tenets of the initiative, fight
project scope creep, head off rumors, and consistently improve business performance.
Elements of your communications plan
Both the Deployment Initiative Communications Plan and the Project Communications
Plan address seven distinct elements. You must be sure that your plans address these.
The seven elements are
 Why: The purpose for the communication, which is to formally establish and
enforce the commitment to communicate certain information.
 What: The item of communication. Refer to Figure 3-2 for a summary of the many
items of communication in a Six Sigma initiative.
 By Whom: The individual responsible for ensuring that the communication occurs
(see Figure 3-5).
 To Whom: The audience or recipients of the communication.
31
Chapter 3: Leading and Managing a Six Sigma Initiative

 When: The time and frequency at which you deliver the communication.
 How: The tool or delivery mechanism that you use to communicate. Refer to
Figure 3-6 for a list of the many ways you can communicate.
 Where: The location — physical or virtual — where the recipients find the com-
municated information.
The nature of communication varies over the life cycle of the initiative, including the
content of what’s communicated, to whom and by whom it’s communicated, when it
takes place, and what tool of choice is most applicable. How differently would you
communicate during the initialization phase as opposed to the deployment phase?
How would you change the nature of your communications during the expansion
phase? And, finally, what would your communications be like during the sustaining
phase? Keep these questions in mind as you read — you put them to use in an exercise
at the end of the chapter.
The following sections cover these elements in more detail. In the section, “Writing
your communications plan,” you build your own communications plan so you can see
how the process includes these seven elements.
What’s to communicate?
Six Sigma initiatives communicate considerable amounts of information across the
organization. Figure 3-2 is a list of the major items communicated. So that you better
understand the contents and purpose of each item in your plan, complete the figure by
writing a brief explanation of each.

Part I: Getting Started in Six Sigma 

Before the initiative can proceed beyond the Leadership Team, one critical item of
communication must be prepared — the elevator pitch. The Six Sigma elevator pitch,
which is a common way of defining and describing your initiative in a smooth, brief,
passionate, and consistent manner, is a cornerstone of the initiative’s communications
plan. Brevity is important here — the elevator pitch got its name because you should
be able to give the entire spiel during a short elevator ride. If you create anything
longer, you risk losing your audience.
In Figure 3-3, you craft your own Six Sigma elevator pitch. Take your time on this task —
it’s not easy to boil down your entire initiative to a crisp and clever definition. You only
have to address four topics to complete the elevator pitch. They’re laid out for you in
the figure.
Here’s a purposefully generic example of an elevator pitch. It covers each of the topics
from Figure 3-3 in a handful of sentences that can be spoken in about a minute:
We’re embarking on a long-term, continuous improvement effort called Six Sigma. It’s
not a fad; it’s a well-proven approach to reducing inefficiencies and increasing effec-
tiveness across all aspects of our business. Our industry is faced with increasing global
competition against both the quality and price of our products and services. Our Six
Sigma program will give us the tools to constantly eliminate the things that are holding
us back. This will require all of us to learn new tools and ways of doing things, but as a
result we’ll be a stronger company, and each of us will be more agile and valuable.
Now try creating your own elevator pitch. Even though ours is generic, make yours
passionate and specific to your situation.
Great work — you’ve completed one of the most difficult communications! The next
communication, the frequently asked questions (FAQ) list, is much easier. In Figure 3-4,
you see a set of commonly asked questions about Six Sigma. Complete the worksheet
by answering the questions. Feel free to add new questions that you think may be
asked in your organization.
Who does the communicating?
Everyone communicates in Six Sigma. Communications happen from the top-down —
from the highest levels of leadership down to the last hourly worker or volunteer.
They also occur from the bottom-up, from anyone in the organization who sees a
problem that needs fixing or a way to do something better, up to those who can actu-
ally do something about it. Communications are also lateral — which means that
methods and tools are shared and results are verified across and between projects
and departments. And they’re both outside-in, with inputs from customers, suppliers,
and stakeholders, and inside-out, with inputs going from the organization to these
constituents. Finally, communications are also very much bidirectional, with every-
one listening as much as he or she is being listened to.

Figure 3-5 shows a matrix of each general class of participant. Because communica-
tions are bidirectional, each class is listed on both axes. You may identify others that
you can include for your organization. Take the time to consider what type of commu-
nication goes in each square. Ask the following questions:
 Which communications are most important to the effectiveness of the initiative?
 Are there any communications that are unlikely to ever occur? Why? Should they?
 Which communication channels are likely to be exercised the most?
 Which communications are the most unusual — but critical to the initiative
nonetheless?
 Do any communications pose a risk to the success of the initiative? What should
be done about it?
 Which communications are most vulnerable to being disrupted? What would you
do to protect them?

Timing is everything
You should communicate at four different times:
 At a milestone event or point of achievement
 At a periodic time interval
 At an impromptu time that’s right for communication
 At an impromptu time that’s wrong for communication
Like with any major initiative, all four cases will come into play during your Six Sigma
deployment.
Using communications tools
You can communicate in countless ways with countless types of tools. Figure 3-6 catego-
rizes many standard tools of communication into a list, including the typical applications of
each tool. Study this table to discover how many tools are available to you. This table also
shows you the different powers and applicability of each tool. You can’t use all the tools all
the time. Instead, it’s a matter of the right combination.
As an exercise, consider and identify when it’s most appropriate to use each tool.
Which tools are most useful to each of your communicators from Figure 3-5? When in
the process of your initiative or project would you use each tool? Which are most
powerful and efficient in your organization? Using the worksheet in Figure 3-6, make
notes in the “When” column that help you identify and organize the uses of these
communication tools.
Where, oh, where have the 
communications gone?
Environment dramatically affects the nature of communications, which is why formal
presentations are staged in formal environments, and why off-site retreats are the
backdrop for new, out-of-the-box thinking. One of the original Six Sigma training firms
took corporate executives to a ranch in rural Arizona and had them riding the range
and herding cattle as part of their reorientation. Don’t underestimate the role and
power of environment in your communications.
Follow these guidelines as you prepare your Six Sigma initiative:
 To command everyone’s attention, senior management should use the podium of
its most revered settings to announce and present information at key times.
Anything less will denigrate the importance of the program.
 Off-site retreats have proven to be effective venues for concentrating change efforts
with managers and other organizational leaders.
 Senior managers and process owners should regularly venture into the organization
and conduct formal communications events as well as informal encounters within
the environment of the Six Sigma projects and work processes that are in the midst
of change.
 One-on-one sessions in non-threatening environments enable key communications.
 Because online “environments” are vital in today’s technological world, tools such as
an internal Web site and a newsletter, which include all key communications and a
link to repositories, should be developed and maintained throughout the initiative.

Selecting Software Products and Integrating
Information Technology Architectures
The software tools for Six Sigma sort into two major categories: practitioner tools and
management tools. In this section, you identify your needs and determine which of
these tools is right for you.
Yours, mine, or ours: Platform questions
The first issue to address is the extent to which you need your data and software
applications to be designed and implemented for enterprise use, which depends pri-
marily on the size and scope of your organization and your initiative. If you’re deploy-
ing Six Sigma across a large organization, you need enterprise-class tools. If your
implementation is in a small organization or single department, desktop tools should
be sufficient. To decide whether you need to use enterprise-class tools, answer the
questions in Figure 3-9.
Did you answer “Yes” to all the questions in Figure 3-9? If any of your answers were
“No,” chances are great that you won’t be using enterprise tools.
Six Sigma Enteprise vs. Desktop Worksheet
Yes
No
Is your Six Sigma intiative being deployed across your entire organization?
Is your organization presently enabled with "enterprise" type applications?
Do you intend to use outsourced Web applications as your program
software?
Is your Six Sigma program going to affect more than 1,000 staff memebers?
Do you have customers who require integrated data systems?
Do you anticipate having more than 20 Black Belts?

Enterprise Integration, SOA, and BPM
In addition to the practitioner and management software tools specific to Six Sigma
program execution, there are other information technology contributions to a Six
Sigma initiative. These contributions are based on leveraging the existing technology
infrastructure and application programs already in use across your organization.
These programs may include such critical systems as financial and accounting applica-
tions, customer management software, supply chain and delivery management, pro-
curement software, design tools, and more. Many existing business processes are
encoded formally within these systems or informally in the way people use them, and,
as a result, your Six Sigma initiative will eventually address these systems.
Make sure your IT department uses the following technologies:
 Enterprise Application Integration and Service-Oriented Architectures: Your
Six Sigma reporting tools, dashboards, and other measures of business perform-
ance will require you to extract information from these systems. Use connectiv-
ity tools, middleware, and other forms of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)
to extract the data. Increasingly, Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) are used
as an abstraction layer to make data extraction simpler.
 Business Process Management: Business Process Management (BPM) systems
extend the functionality of process management and process analysis tools into
proactive simulation and control of key components of the business.
Defining and Implementing 
Your Management Plan
Your Six Sigma initiative is a long-term commitment to a new way of performing every-
day business. Six Sigma involves both a shift in thinking to a measurable basis for set-
ting objectives and performance, as well as the development of a project orientation to
approaching and solving problems. Your organization will undergo an extended pro-
grammatic effort to deploy the knowledge, methods, and tools of Six Sigma and will
develop the infrastructure, communications, incentives, and control systems.
Your Six Sigma initiative has a life cycle with four distinct phases:
 Initialization: This is the phase you’re in right now — the process of preparing
and developing the infrastructure and support systems needed to begin the 
initiative.
 Deployment: In this phase, the many elements of the infrastructure are
deployed. Training and project work begin, and the first results come in.
 Expansion: After the initial deployment phase is completed, you expand the pro-
gram to encompass the entire organization, including key suppliers and cus-
tomers.
 Sustaining: This is the most challenging phase of all because you have to sustain
the gains — and these aren’t the gains in bottom-line performance. They’re the
gains in cultural agility. This is the phase of transitioning from “the new initia-
tive” to “the way we work.”
Unfortunately, Six Sigma doesn’t happen magically. To accomplish a successful Six
Sigma initiative, you need to create and work with an Initiative Management Plan.
41
Chapter 3: Leading and Managing a Six Sigma Initiative

The Six Sigma Initiative Management Plan is similar to other initiative plans because it
requires a complete and thorough consideration of all aspects of the initiative and a
fully documented and traceable set of measures and controls.
Figure 3-12 is a checklist for your plan. As you prepare your plan, be certain that each
of the elements in the checklist is included.

Defining a Six Sigma Project

In this part . . .
F
rom the topmost to the lowest level applications,
Six Sigma uses the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-
Control (DMAIC) project methodology to achieve break-
through improvement results. In this part, you go through
exercises and worksheets that build your mastery of defin-
ing the problem to be solved and the project effort that
will solve it. Consistent improvement requires your careful
study and precise scoping of what the problem actually is.

Defining a Six Sigma Project
In This Chapter
 Identifying problem areas with a business case
 Creating scorecards to prioritize projects
 Defining projects with problem statements
 Using objective statements for project definition
 Following a launch checklist
P
rior chapters show you how to form an overall Six Sigma initiative in your organization,
how to gather the necessary resources, and how to make sure your initiative meets 
the goals of your organization. Through these chapters, you discover how to lead and
manage your initiative and how to make sure your team, lines of communication, and tech-
nologies are all in place. So, now you think you’re ready to leap in with both feet, frantically
attacking every problem in sight and slashing and burning your way through all that varia-
tion, error, and waste, right? Not so fast!
Correctly defining your project is a critical tipping point in your Six Sigma initiative — a mis-
step here can totally derail the whole shebang. Selecting and scoping projects, particularly in
the early stages of an initiative, must be done in a rational, orderly process because nothing
causes a loss of confidence in an initiative more than a failure at the outset. Your first proj-
ects must have extremely high chances for clear success. These first wins build confidence
and momentum in your improvement efforts. Anything less is the kiss of death.
This chapter provides you with the tools and techniques to ensure that your project selec-
tion process gets your initiative off on the right foot.
Getting Project Ideas by Using 
the Business Case Writing Tool
After you’ve reined in your sense of urgency to get started, you’re ready to kick-off an orderly
project selection process. The first step is to look around for projects, right? Not exactly;
that’s still a bit premature. The first step is to identify the problem areas of the business. 
By using a tool called a business case, you can identify where in the business problems are
occurring, provide a summary description of the situation, and estimate the potential value
of improvement efforts. The intent here isn’t to define a Six Sigma project, but to clearly illu-
minate where projects are needed the most.
The description of the business problem doesn’t need excessive detail at this point — the
detail comes with the definition of the associated projects.

1.
Here’s a business case example. Find and underline each of the five required business case elements: 
Procedures call for all shipments to be turned over to the carrier within four hours of receipt at
the dock. Shipping dock A has an average time of more than 12 hours, resulting in storage issues
and customer complaints. We had to add 100 square feet of storage to the dock, and have lost
three customers this month due to late shipments.
Solve It
In order to stimulate you to find problem areas in your business, following is a checklist
of red flag items, any one of which could indicate a business problem area to address:
❑Product returns
❑Low quality
❑Capacity restraints
❑Receivable collection issues
❑Low yield
❑Long cycle times
❑Stressful work
❑Rework
❑Excessive inventory
❑Chaotic or complicated workflow
❑Waste
❑Customer complaints
46
Part II: Defining a Six Sigma Project 
Q.
After you’ve identified a potential prob-
lem area, it’s time to prepare the business
case. An effective business case must
include the following elements:
• The specific system or process being
scrutinized
• The area of the business affected
• The base goal or objective not being
met
• The resulting problems or issues
• The estimated impact, in dollars or
another metric
Underline each of these business case 
elements in the following statement:
Our accounts receivable performance
for the finance invoicing area isn’t 
meeting the goal of 47 days sales out-
standing. Overall this poor perform-
ance is causing cash flow and budget
problems that are costing us as much
as $4 million per year.
A.
Here’s what the statement looks like with
the business case elements underlined:
Our accounts receivable performance
for the finance invoicing area isn’t 
meeting the goal of 47 days sales 
outstanding. Overall this poor perform-
ance is causing cash flow and budget
problems that are costing us as much
as $4 million per year.
Use the following template to create business cases and to start the process of select-
ing appropriate Six Sigma projects:
The performance of ______________________________________________ isn’t meeting the
goal of ______________________________________________________________ in the area of
__________________________________________________________________. This results in
___________________________________________________________ causing these negative
effects: _________________________________________________________________________.
Prioritizing and Aligning Projects with
Business-Customer-Process Scorecards
Hopefully by now you’ve identified a number of problem areas in your business and
have prepared business cases for each (if you haven’t, check out the previous section,

“Getting Project Ideas by Using the Business Case Writing Tool,” for tips). So now the ques-
tion is “What criteria should I use for selecting appropriate Six Sigma projects?” Here are just
a few options: Alphabetical, random, highest dollar, and even by throwing darts. But be care-
ful! Even though you’ve identified legitimate problem areas that will yield good candidates
for projects, haphazard project selection can still hamper or derail your initiative.
Always keep in mind that to obtain the maximum benefit from your initiative, you must link
your Six Sigma project selection with the strategic needs of the business.
Take a look at Figure 4-1, which illustrates the overall concept of aligning Six Sigma with busi-
ness goals and objectives.
At this critical point in the selection process, you probably have a number of “Voices” shout-
ing at you and demanding attention: the Voice of the Customer (VOC), Voice of the Process
(VOP), and Voice of the Business (VOB). Often you find these Voices competing with each
other for your attention. For example, the VOC wants lower prices, better pizza, and faster
delivery, the VOP wants the best possible ingredients regardless of the cost, and the VOB
wants to make more money.
Take the Three Sigma Pizza Emporium for example. This business has a number of problems,
and the Six Sigma team didn’t know where to start on improvement efforts. So, the team com-
pleted a business-customer-process scorecard, which is shown in Figure 4-2.
After multiplying the three column rankings for each process, the Six Sigma team at the
Three Sigma Pizza Emporium decided that making pizza was the place to start improvement
efforts. The team identified several key projects in that area.

Project Definition I: Writing 
a Problem Statement
Before mounting your white horse and leaping right into solving your business problems,
you need to define and describe the problem by using a problem statement. This tool clarifies
the issue by specifically identifying what has to improve to meet your goal, the magnitude 
of the problem, where the problem occurs, and the financial impact. The problem statement
can then be used to communicate the problem to the people whose support you need.
Following is a checklist that shows all the critical elements of a successful problem statement:
❑A description of the problem and the metric used to describe it.
❑The process name and location of the problem.
❑The time frame over which the problem has been occurring.
❑The size or magnitude of the problem.

Part II: Defining a Six Sigma Project 
Q.
The Six Sigma team at the Three Sigma
Pizza Emporium created a problem state-
ment to pinpoint the business’s problems
with pizza production. The first draft of
the problem statement read as follows:
“There is a problem with the number of
undercooked pizzas.”
A.
When the team presented this problem
statement to the General Manager, his
response was, “So what? I knew that!” The
team leader told the team to try again,
using the checklist above. The next draft
read as follows:
“In the last six months, 5 percent of
pizzas had to be scrapped prior to
boxing due to undercooking. The boxers
had no procedures for sending pizzas
back for additional cooking time. In addi-
tion, 2 percent of the pizzas delivered to
customers were undercooked, resulting 
in 125 customer complaints. Pizza scrap-
ping cost the company $23,550 during the
last six months, in addition to a loss of
customers.”
If you compare the new statement with
the previous critical elements checklist,
you see that all critical elements have
been included. The General Manager now
has a clear picture of the problem, and he
will no doubt support the Six Sigma proj-
ects conducted by the team in this area.

Project Definition II: Writing 
an Objective Statement
One more tool is important for you to make sure that your improvement project
launches properly. This tool is called an objective statement, which directly addresses
the problem statement. In order to be effective, the objective statement must contain
all of the following elements: It must improve some metric from some baseline to some
goal, in some amount of time with some positive impact on some corporate goal or
objective. Simply put, the objective statement must indicate the level of improvement
expected from improvement efforts, including specific, quantifiable amounts and the
time required to complete.

50
Part II: Defining a Six Sigma Project 
Six Sigma practitioners often use a memory jogger, called SMART, to help write 
effective objective statements. Each letter reminds you of a goal to achieve in your
statement:
 Specific: Make sure that the specific deliverables and outcomes are stated and
that you answer the question, “What’s the specific purpose of this project?”
 Measurable: Be sure that your objective is both quantifiable and verifiable and
that it includes such things as quality, quantity, cost, and timeliness.
 Aggressive, but Attainable: A challenging objective makes the project interesting
and fulfilling, while also providing worthwhile returns. However, don’t try to
solve world hunger.
 Relevant: The objective must be relevant to business goals.
 Time bound: You must state a definitive time frame for reaching your objective.
Q.
The Three Sigma Pizza Emporium team
created an objective statement. The first
draft of the statement for pizza produc-
tion looked like this:
“Retrain employees to reduce the
number of undercooked pizzas.”
A.
The team leader sent the team back to
the drawing board with instructions to
include all the critical elements required
for a proper objective statement. The
team’s next effort read as follows:
“Our goal is to reduce the number of
pizzas scrapped from undercooking from
5 percent to less than .05 percent by June
30. In addition, we also want to reduce
the number of undercooked pizzas that
reach customers from 2 percent to zero
by the same date. Doing so will help
restore our image as a quality pizza
parlor and will save the company
$50,000 annually.”
If you compare the new draft to the
required elements mentioned at the
beginning of this section, you’ll find that
all are included.

Launching a Project
You’re probably chomping at the bit to launch your project. You’ve written the busi-
ness case, you’ve made sure your identified problem area is important to the company,
and you’ve written a problem statement and an objective statement. So, you say, let’s
go! However, don’t get ahead of yourself — there are still a few things to remember and
manage as the project starts.
To make sure the launch process is orderly, follow this checklist:
❑Identify everyone who has to approve the project.
❑Obtain written approval.
❑Identify the people impacted by your project.
❑Notify the impacted people of what’s to come.
❑Get final approval from the project team leader.
❑Identify Six Sigma skill levels (Belts) that are needed.
❑Identify the process members who will participate.
❑Identify the entire project team by name.
❑Fire!

Solutions to Defining a Six Sigma Project

Here’s a solution to the business case example:
Procedures call for all shipments (the specific process) to be turned over to the carrier within
4 hours of receipt (the base goal not being met) at the dock. Shipping dock A (area of the busi-
ness affected) has an average time of more than 12 hours, resulting in storage issues and cus-
tomer complaints (the resulting problem). We had to add 100 square feet of storage to the
dock, and have lost three customers this month (the impact) due to late shipments.

Now it’s your turn to help the Three Sigma Pizza Emporium team write another problem state-
ment. If you recall from the scorecard created in the section “Prioritizing and Aligning Projects
with Business-Customer-Process Scorecards,” pizza delivery was the second-ranked problem
area. Take the following incomplete statement, and rewrite it as an effective problem statement,
making sure to include all items from the checklist:
“Customers are complaining about delivery times.”
An effective problem statement for this case reads as follows:
“Since June 30, the average time to deliver a pizza within our market area, a 15-mile radius, is
35 minutes. During this time we had a low of 22 minutes and a high of 66 minutes, and we
exceeded our advertised guarantee of 30 minutes 55 percent of the time. The result of these slow
delivery times is customer complaints, free pizzas to the customer, and a loss of business. Free
and scrapped pizzas resulted in a revenue loss of $23,800 during the period. Driver costs for 
redelivery cost the company an additional $6,600. Lost customers are estimated to represent
$45,000 in annual business.”

very process, every product, every event — what do these all have in common? Each 
is comprised of, or caused by, some number of inputs, known in Six Sigma parlance as
Xs, which take their place in the equation, Y= f(X). Before you can start improving your out-
come, or Y, you have to first identify all of the inputs that created this outcome. Without
tools and a rigorous process, identifying inputs is a daunting task.
Even something as simple as a #2 lead pencil has an astounding number of inputs — wood,
paint, metal, rubber, graphite, and all the people, machines, and processes to mine, refine,
produce, mold, bend, shape, spindle, ship, receive, and assemble the parts. Now, consider
something as complex as an automobile — you have steel, plastic, rubber, paint, aluminum,
glass . . . well, you get the picture.
Six Sigma practitioners have developed tools and techniques to act as catalysts to facilitate
the identification of the inputs into a process or product. Because the rest of this workbook
deals with categorizing, measuring, improving, and controlling inputs, it’s important that
you’re proficient in identifying these inputs. So, in this chapter, you find out how to prepare a
series of diagrams, each one of which digs you deeper and deeper into the world of inputs.
All Together Now: Brainstorming with Your
Team to Create Affinity Diagrams
An affinity diagram is a diagram that’s the result of an exercise where members of a group
write their ideas on small paper notes and sort the ideas into logical categories. Brainstorm-
ing has always been an effective tool for generating a large number of ideas — and the first
step in creating an affinity diagram is a brainstorming session. Brainstorming works because
the ideas and knowledge generated by two or more people acting as a group are always
greater than those of the sum of the people acting individually.

Here’s the traditional cycle of a brainstorming session:
1. Agree on a subject. The group must first agree on the category or condition to
be the subject of the session.
2. Encourage participation. Each team member should be encouraged to participate.
3. Discourage criticism. Ensure that everyone understands that debates and criti-
cism aren’t allowed.
4. Decide on a contribution method. Members can contribute in rotation or in free
flow. Just make sure everyone is heard.
5. Promote equality. Ensure that every member has an equal opportunity to be
heard.
6. Listen. Hear and respect the ideas of others — there are no stupid ideas.
7. Record ideas. Make sure all ideas are written down.
8. Continue as long as necessary. Stop only after no more new ideas are offered.
9. Edit. Review the list for clarity and duplicates.
10. Repeat. Repeat the process for all identified categories.
After you’ve generated a whole truckload of ideas, you can start your affinity diagram.
The process of creating an affinity diagram stimulates an effective gathering and organ-
ization of the ideas into natural groupings — groupings that start to pinpoint the
essence of a problem and provide the raw material for a breakthrough solution.
Likely more than one person in the brainstorming group already knows what’s causing
the problem — these people just don’t know that they know. After the ideas are gener-
ated and organized, the light will come on and the entire group will say, “Ahhh, so
that’s the problem!”
54
Part II: Defining a Six Sigma Project 
Q.
Here’s a checklist for generating an affinity diagram:
1. Write down the problem or issue.
Be sure that the topic is clear and concise enough to address in one session. “How do we boil
the ocean?” is too broad. However, “Why is our server computer crashing?” is a more suitable
topic to delve into.
2. Conduct a brainstorming session for the problem.
Follow the brainstorming steps that we outlined earlier in this section. Spend a minimum of 15
minutes, and as long as necessary, discussing this issue.
3. During the discussion, have the participants write each of their ideas on a separate sticky
note, with only one idea per note.
Avoid using ideas that are single words. Instead, use phrases or sentences. For instance, unac-
ceptable ideas for the topic “Why is our server computer crashing?” would be: “stupidity,” “junk,”
“evil spirits,” or “who knows?” Acceptable ideas would be: “Users are poorly trained,” “Computer
hardware is obsolete,” and “Software is incompatible.”
Continue as long as necessary. It’s not unusual to generate more than 100 notes.

4. Post all of the sticky notes on a smooth surface, such as a wall or whiteboard.
Without discussion, have the participants sort the notes into a few logical categories — usually
around five, but in no case more than ten. Encourage participants to move notes from category
to category to where they fit best.
Sorting in silence helps participants focus on meaning and not on the emotion or baggage that
arises in most discussions.
5. After all the sorting is done, instruct the participants to create titles for the categories.
A category title should fit the notes bundled under it. Don’t force titles or notes into places
they don’t fit. When the sorting process is done, create an affinity diagram.

Following is a short list of ideas that may have been generated in a brainstorming session on the
topic, “Why is our server computer crashing?” Review the ideas, and then enter each in one of the
category columns in the included figure. After entering all the ideas, add suitable category titles.
Here are the brainstorming ideas:
• Obsolete hardware
• Old virus software
• Poor training
• Spyware
• Large applications
• Power brownouts
• Incompatible software
• No new-hire training
• Power surges
• Macintosh computers
• Weak firewall
• Linux software
• Server room too warm
• Microsoft software
• Excess network connections
• Server room not secure
• Virus infection
• Dial-up connection
• Old server software
• No budget
• Faulty disk drive
Now that you’re familiar with the affinity diagram and brainstorming process, pick a
nagging problem that you face in your job, gather several other people familiar with
the issue, and conduct an affinity exercise using the blank template in Figure 5-1. You
can print it from www.dummies.com/go/sixsigmaworkbook.

After you create an affinity diagram, take it a step further and drill down a bit into the
inputs to find the causes of variation by using a very useful tool called the cause-and-
effect diagram, which is also called the Ishikawa diagram or, because of its appear-
ance, the fishbone diagram (see Figure 5-2).
The fishbone diagram, which was created by Kaoru Ishikawa, a quality management
pioneer in Japan, is used to explore all the potential causes (inputs) that result in a
single output. Even though an affinity diagram helps you group inputs into general cat-
egories, the fishbone diagram goes a step further and links inputs together to help you
dig for the true root causes of variation.

template.

Q.
Using Figure 5-2, create your own fishbone diagram. 
A.
In constructing the fishbone diagram, the problem or condition (the output, or Y) is entered at the
“head” of the fish, with the backbone extending to the left. Each of the major intersecting “bones”
is a primary category of input. These categories may be the same ones identified in the affinity
diagram process, or they can be the often-used generic categories, such as Measurement, Man 
(or People), Method (or Process), Materials, Machine (or Equipment), and Environment. The
important thing to remember is that categories need to fit your identified output and the inputs
generated.
The smaller, horizontal “bones” are the individual inputs previously generated. Each input is
examined carefully to make sure it’s not only in the right category, but also to determine whether
it’s a direct input at all. If an input turns out to be only indirectly contributing to the outcome, and 
primarily affects another input, these indirect inputs are placed as “sub-bones” connected to
another input. Of course, if, upon examination, a generated idea has no impact at all on the out-
come, this idea is discarded and not entered on the fishbone diagram.
The following is an example of a completed fishbone diagram.

Part II: Defining a Six Sigma Project 
Many of the ideas produced in an affinity diagram exercise may not be causes at all, or
they may turn out to be symptoms of the root cause. In a fishbone diagram exercise,
each input is explored in depth, linked to associated inputs, and classified as either a
root or secondary cause.

Following are some of the inputs from the affinity diagram exercise from earlier in the chapter.
Find an appropriate spot for each input on the fishbone diagram template in the included figure.
Look long and hard at each one — if you come to the conclusion that an item simply doesn’t have
an impact on the outcome, don’t enter it. If an item appears to be an indirect input, enter it as a
diagonal under another input. If you find that an item does impact the outcome, but doesn’t fit
any of the five categories, create a new category of your own. Remember, like in the affinity dia-
gram exercise, your output is continuous server crashes. Here’s a hint to help you: The server
itself has a functioning uninterruptible power supply, but the computer room doesn’t. Here are

Examining Your Processes 
with Process Flow Maps
After you’ve generated a number of potential inputs into your selected outcome and
have begun to categorize and analyze these inputs, it’s time for you to take the next
step. Even though you’ve been looking at the possible causes of your outcome, you
haven’t yet taken a look at the whole system, or process, of which your outcome is the
end result. Before you can make improvements to your process, which will give you
the outcome that you want, you have to know what the process really is. One way to
examine a process is to use a graphical representation of a process called a process
flow map. But beware of a process flow map if you haven’t verified that it represents
what’s really occurring.
The illustration in Figure 5-4 has been around for many years, but it’s still valid today.
Here’s what it all means:
 “What you think it is” represents the established “standard” procedure, or “con-
ventional wisdom”; often what the documentation, if it exists, says it is.
 “What it actually is” represents the actual current practice, or what’s really hap-
pening. It may change frequently. Often, each person knows his or her own part
of the process but no one actually knows all of this process.
 “What it should be” represents the potential improvement, or what the ideal
process could be.
Figure 5-5 shows examples of some drawing conventions used in process flow map-
ping. Although the exact shape and meaning of each icon is flexible, it’s important to
be consistent throughout your organization.

Finding Critical Fruit in the CT Tree
A CT tree is another diagrammatic way of sorting and displaying inputs, but with a dif-
ferent wrinkle. Affinity and fishbone diagrams sort inputs by type, but a CT tree sorts
inputs by what is Critical To (Six Sigma crowds are pretty original, aren’t they?) the
major contributors to the success of your desired outcome. What makes the CT tree
particularly useful is that it relates inputs to specific outputs that you’re interested in.
This is the only such tool that starts with the outcome of interest and backs into the
causes.

Assume that you’re the general manager of Three Sigma Delivery Pizzeria and that you’ve been
getting your crust handed to you by your competition. So, you conduct a brainstorming session
with your employees and you prepare an affinity diagram and a fishbone diagram. You then map
your process so you have a good idea how your process works.
As a result of the efforts so far, you decide that customer satisfaction is poor, and that this is the
outcome you have to change. You further identified three major contributors that are critical to
customer satisfaction: pricing, quality, and timeliness. Following is a list of inputs identified in
brainstorming. Your fishbone exercise confirmed that these inputs have a potential impact on
your outcome — which makes them “Critical To” inputs — so you want to further classify them by
the three major contributor categories. After reviewing the following list of inputs, write each one
in the appropriate box in the included figure:
• Available lines
• Telephone staffing
• Delivery time
• Taste
• Cooking time
• Telephone answering
• Packaging
• Competition
• Ingredient freshness
• Cost of extra ingredients

Following is a short list of ideas that may have been generated in a brainstorming session on
the topic, “Why is our server computer crashing?” Review the ideas, and then enter each in one
of the category columns in the problem figure. After entering all the ideas, add suitable cate-
gory titles. Here are the brainstorming ideas:
• Obsolete hardware
• Poor training
• Large applications
• Incompatible software
• Power surges
• Weak firewall
• Server room too warm
• Excess network connections
• Virus infection
• Old server software

• Server room not secure
• Dial-up connection
• No budget

• Power surges
• Weak firewall
• Macintosh computers
• Server room too warm
• Virus infection
• Power brownouts
• Old virus software
• Spyware
See the following figure for the solution. Upon closer examination, you should have found that 
the power surges, brownouts, and the room temperature were all related. You probably created a
new category called Environment (or something similar) for these items. Though the server itself
has an uninterruptible power supply, the air conditioning in the server room was often shutting
down, causing temperature increases. So, you probably decided that the power fluctuations
didn’t affect the server directly, but could be a root cause and should be further investigated.
You also may have realized that the combination of the weak firewall and the old virus software
leaves the server vulnerable to infection. Even though the weak firewall itself doesn’t impact
the server, it could be a contributing root cause, which means that it should be flagged for fur-
ther study and measurement.
Spyware, while annoying, doesn’t cause the server to crash. And, Macintosh computers, which
we’re using to write this workbook, obviously have nothing to do with the issue at hand and
shouldn’t be persecuted by jealous PC users.

hapter 5 shows you how to identify, classify, and start to prioritize the inputs into a
product or process, how to conduct a rousing group get-together, how to create dia-
grams that look like dead fish, and how to determine whether your system or process really
works like you thought it did. You also discover that some inputs are critical to one thing or
another, while others aren’t. If you’ve already perused that chapter, no doubt you’re now
chomping at the bit, ready to charge in on your white horse and fix everything in sight. (If
you haven’t already perused Chapter 5, you should probably do so now.)
In order to concentrate improvement efforts on only those inputs that have a significant
impact, you need to prioritize your inputs so that limited resources can be applied to what
will produce the greatest improvement. This chapter shows you how. You can also print
some of the forms used in this chapter from www.dummies.com/go/sixsigmaworkbook.
Weeding and Pruning the Input Garden:
Using Pareto Diagrams
The Pareto Principle, or the 80-20 rule as it’s sometimes called, is as true today as it was 100
years ago when Vilfredo Pareto observed that 80 percent of all grain in Italy came from 20
percent of the farmers. Applying the Pareto concept to inputs is a powerful way to sort out
“the vital few” from “the trivial many.” If you remember that 20 percent of inputs produce 80
percent of the results, you can narrow your focus down significantly.
Q.
Create your own Pareto diagram.
A.
The most common way to apply Pareto
analysis in Six Sigma is to relatively rank
inputs based on the amount of impact each
has on the outcome. You then create a
visual representation, a Pareto diagram, of
the input ranking, such as a bar chart, that
quickly identifies which critical inputs are
ranked the highest, as in the following
figure.

1.
Your BelchFire 5000 coupe is a bit of a gas hog, so you decide to apply the Six Sigma principles to
improve your gas mileage. In an affinity diagram exercise with your bowling buddies, you brain-
stormed the following list of inputs that impact your gas mileage:
70
Part II: Defining a Six Sigma Project 
 Gas brand/type
 Idle time
 Driving speed
 Vehicle maintenance
 Tire pressure
 Tire brand
 Passenger weight
 Accessories used
 Weather
 Engine size
 Transmission type
 Aerodynamics
Follow these steps to finish this practice problem:
1. Place the inputs into a fishbone diagram.
Use the following figure and the generic categories shown on the template.
2. After you’ve placed the inputs in the diagram, relatively rank them to
clearly differentiate the impact of each on your outcome.
Even though the degree of impact for some inputs may be intuitively obvi-
ous, the impact of others may not be. Use the discussion and analysis from
the Affinity and Fishbone exercises in Chapter 5 to help establish rankings.
You may also want to explore any data that’s readily available to help con-
firm or refine your rankings.
People
Machine
Method
How can I improve
gas mileage?
Material
Measurement
Environment
Don’t try to apply this concept too early in your improvement process. You first need to
identify all the inputs before you can start sorting out the vital few (see Chapter 5 for how-to
info on input gathering).
Characteristic of Interest
Critical Inputs
Numerical Scale

You can use any ranking method you want, as long as the differences in impact are
clear. For this practice exercise, use a ranking of 0 to 10, with 10 being the greatest
impact and 0 being no impact at all. Place your ranking score next to each input on
the fishbone diagram.
You may be tempted at this point to start taking measurements to help you rank your
inputs. You could measure the change you get in gas mileage for different brands of gas
or you could evaluate gas mileage for different passenger weights and for different driv-
ing speeds. This type of measurement is a powerful way to identify the critical inputs,
but unfortunately it takes a huge effort. Remember, the whole point is to avoid expend-
ing effort to measure an input that doesn’t have a significant impact on the problem.
3. Put the ranked inputs into a Pareto diagram to get a clear, visual indication of
which inputs are critical inputs.
Using Microsoft Excel or any other chart-making application, enter your ranked inputs into an
appropriate chart format, such as a bar chart. Make the vertical axis the ranking scale and the
horizontal axis the inputs. After the chart is finished, indicate which inputs are critical by put-
ting a mark, such as an “X,” on the 2 to 3 highest bars. Also indicate which inputs are candi-
dates for further measurement and analysis.

Chapter 6: Prioritizing Which Inputs to Address
Cementing the Foundation: 
Creating SIPOC Diagrams
SIPOC (pronounced sy-pok) when spoken with a guttural inflection sounds like a Klingon
curse on Star Trek. In reality, however, it’s an acronym for one of the most fundamental steps
in the Six Sigma process.
SIPOC — which stands for Suppliers-Inputs-Process-Outputs-Controls — is a tool for building
high-level process maps that consider the impact of suppliers and the requirements of cus-
tomers. In this context, both suppliers and customers may be external or they may be
people, systems, or processes within the same organization.
A SIPOC diagram is based on simple process flow maps, but it delves much further — 
providing immediate feedback as to which inputs are critical to the process output. A SIPOC
diagram focuses on inputs, outputs, customers, and suppliers, and provides the foundation
for significant DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control, the basic Six Sigma
process) improvement.
Following are the steps you take to complete a SIPOC diagram:
1. Identify the process you want to map and then define the scope and boundary points.
Be sure to use action verbs to describe what the process is supposed to do. A key to
creating a SIPOC diagram is to correctly identify the current process before moving on
to the other parts of the diagram.
2. Identify the outputs. Describe the products or services produced by the process.
3. Define the customer or customers. 
Name the people, processes, or organizations that receive the outputs. As part of this
step, define the customer requirements by listing what they demand and what they’re
entitled to.
4. List all of the inputs to the process — identify the people, information, materials, and
other resources necessary for the process to produce the identified outputs.
5. Identify the sources, or suppliers, of the inputs.

2.
Practice creating a SIPOC diagram for the process of building a #2 lead pencil. Penrod Pencils, Inc.,
buys all the pencil components, builds the pencils, and sells them to a pencil wholesaler. Following is
all the information you need to complete a SIPOC diagram for the pencil process. The data is in
random order, so you have to carefully consider where each item fits in the included figure, which is
a SIPOC template. Here’s a hint: The template includes the exact number of boxes in each category.

Untangling Webs: Creating 
a Cause-and-Effect Matrix
In Six Sigma, Y = f(X). In other words, all outcomes (Ys) are the result of certain inputs
(Xs) and the forces that act on them. In simplest terms, this formula is based on cause
and effect.
The Cause and Effect Matrix, or C&E Matrix, helps Six Sigma practitioners make a link
between multiple inputs and the resulting outcomes. By identifying and prioritizing
these relationships, you can explore and graphically display the possible causes of a
problem or condition, which allows you to then search for the root cause.
In many applications, the C&E Matrix relates process inputs and outputs to customer
requirements — don’t forget the Voice of the Customer! In other instances, the C&E
Matrix relates inputs to outputs in order to focus your improvement efforts and
resources.

Complete a C&E Matrix for a service with which almost everyone is familiar — Internet access. In this
exercise, you’re going to be the customer who’s using the C&E Matrix to decide on an Internet service
provider (ISP). Here’s the scenario: After brainstorming and preparing an affinity diagram with the
members of your family, you identified seven outcomes, or customer requirements, for Internet serv-
ice that are important to your family. In addition, you identified seven inputs from an ISP that impacts
these requirements. Following are 14 items — seven inputs and seven outputs — in random order:
 Ease of use
 Short setup
 Access on the road
 Web filter
 Quick log-on
 Setup time
 Remote coverage
 Fast downloads
 Transfer rate
 Log-on time
 Kids can use it
 ISP stability
 Ability to block sites
 Reliability
Following are the steps to complete the C&E matrix that will help you make an ISP selection
decision:
1. Sort these items into inputs and outputs. Use the worksheet at the end of
these steps as a template.
2. Place each output (customer requirement) in a column heading.

75
Chapter 6: Prioritizing Which Inputs to Address
3. Rank each customer requirement using a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being a
must-have down to a 1, which is a nice feature, but isn’t critical.
In this exercise, assume the following rankings: Ability to block: 1; Access on
road: 2; Quick log-on: 3; Short setup: 3; Fast downloads: 4; Reliability: 4; Kids
can use it: 5.
4. List each input in a row heading.
These important inputs are often called critical-to-customer characteristics, or
CTCs for short.
5. Rank the relationships between the inputs and outputs by placing a value
of 1, 3, or 9 at the intersections. 
Nine indicates a strong relationship, 3 a medium relationship, and 1 a weak
relationship. Leave a blank if no relationship exists. This ranking scale is
somewhat arbitrary, but be sure that you clearly distinguish between strong
and weak relationships.
6. Calculate the rank order sum for each input to determine its relative 
priority. 
To do so, multiply each input’s individual relationship value by its corre-
sponding customer requirement ranking value, and then add the multiplied
values across the row.
For example, if an input has a medium, or 3, relationship with a particular
output that has a customer ranking of 5, enter 3 times 5, or 15, in the inter-
secting square.
7. To complete the C&E Matrix, enter the rank order sums from highest to
lowest in a Pareto diagram, such as a bar chart. The most important
inputs are now obvious.

Performing a Failure Modes 
Effects Analysis (FMEA)
Failures in products or processes are inevitable. However, remember that the key prem-
ise of Six Sigma says that variation is everywhere and is in everything. Six Sigma also
says that even though you can’t eliminate all variation, you can detect and eliminate the
most harmful variation and allow for the variation that can’t be totally eliminated.
The fact is that every input has the potential to fail and cause problems with the out-
come. Remember the words of the great philosopher, Kenny Rogers: “Every hand’s a
winner and every hand’s a loser.” It’s the same with inputs. Each one can be successful
in contributing to the desired outcome, but any one of them also can cause a cata-
strophic failure. Huge companies have been destroyed by the simplest of process
errors — errors that could have been prevented if a Failure Modes Effects Analysis
(FMEA) had been performed. 
76
Part II: Defining a Six Sigma Project 
Q.
Define and explain Failure Modes Effects
Analysis (FMEA).
A.
An FMEA is a structured approach to iden-
tifying the potential ways a product or
process can fail and to identifying how you
can detect the failure and its effects so you
can reduce the risk of either occurrence or
impact, or both. Keep these points in mind
for the next problem.
4.
As the general manager of Three Sigma Pizza, you want to continue your efforts in making cus-
tomers happier. After preparing an affinity diagram and a C&E Matrix for your pizza preparation
process, you have chosen one input — pizza cooking time — as a candidate for a Six Sigma
improvement project. Before kicking off the project, you want to prepare an FMEA to focus the
project where it will have the most impact. Using the following template, follow these steps to
complete your FMEA:

Chapter 6: Prioritizing Which Inputs to Address
1. Select and enter your input variables.
In this exercise, use “Pizza cooking time” as the input. Proper consideration
at this step can eliminate trivial factors from further consideration. Only list
variables that have been identified from your previous work — such as a
C&E Matrix, an affinity diagram, a Pareto diagram, or a SIPOC diagram —
instead of listing every possible factor.
2. Enter potential failure modes (the consequences if the input variable isn’t
properly controlled) associated with each individual input variable you
list. Each variable may have more than one failure mode.
As a hint to get you going in this exercise, use “Cooking time too short” and
“Cooking time too long” as the input.
3. Enter the potential failure effect the failure mode would have on your
product or process.
A failure mode may have more than one effect, so be sure you identify all of
them as separate line items.
4. Quantify the severity of the failure modes by assigning each a severity
score, from 1 to 10.
The more severe the effect, the higher its score. Even though all identified
failure modes may have some impact on your customer, that impact won’t
be the same for each.
In the following figure are some guidelines for ranking the severity of each
failure mode’s impact on your customer. The 1-to-10 scale is most common
in industrial applications because it allows for wider variation among the
results. Narrower score ranges, such as 1 to 5, make it easier for teams to
agree. The key is to be consistent.
5. Enter the potential causes of each listed failure mode and then assign
occurrence scores, which rank the likelihood of a failure occurring, for
each of the potential causes.
At this point, you can generate your identified causes in a brainstorming ses-
sion with those directly involved in the system, product, or process.
The following figure shows guidelines for ranking the likelihood that a failure
mode will occur. A score of one means that there is very little chance that
the failure will occur. The scoring scale goes up to ten, which says that a 
failure is certain. Your organization may modify or adopt these scoring
guidelines to fit your specific market and situation, but remember that con-
sistency in rating factors is the key.

6. Identify and list the controls that are currently in place to prevent each
failure mode’s cause.
7. Score each control to determine its ability to detect the failure mode
before harm or damage is done or to prevent the failure mode from ever
occurring.
The following figure shows guidelines to help you rate detectability.
Obviously it’s more beneficial to your customer, and your process, if
you prevent the failure rather than detect it after it has already occurred.
However, when failures do occur, the best case scenario is that it’s detected
before reaching the customer.
8. Compile and analyze your FMEA work.
Calculate a Risk Priority Number, or RPN, for each failure mode cause by
multiplying the severity, occurrence, and detectability scores together for
that mode. The highest RPN numbers indicate the highest risk and show you
where your initial efforts should be concentrated.

Part II: Defining a Six Sigma Project 

Now that you’ve identified the highest priority items, you can set proposed
actions, assign responsibility, and agree on a due date. This use of the FMEA turns
the analysis into a proactive and actionable document.
You should always attempt to reduce the RPN by preventing the failure mode
rather than detecting it. The idea is to make it impossible for the failure to occur.
After the improvement actions have been accomplished and documented, enter new
scores for severity, occurrence, and detectability. A new RPN gives you a clear indi-
cation of whether your efforts have been successful. You can then decide to take fur-
ther actions on this failure mode, or move on to the next highest priority item.

Solutions to Prioritizing Inputs Problems
a
Following is an example solution to the Pareto Diagram exercise, including a fishbone dia-
gram that identifies and ranks the inputs (see following figure).
A Pareto diagram helps visualize the critical inputs. (See the following figure). 
In this case, driving speed, tire pressure, and vehicle maintenance are singled out for fur-
ther measurement and analysis. Even though you may be tempted to immediately start
improvement efforts in all three areas, you still have no data confirming that any of these
inputs is the culprit. Measurements will narrow the choices even further, so you may not
have to lighten up that lead foot quite yet.
Engine size, transmission type, and aerodynamics shouldn’t be ranked. Even though you
have no doubt that these inputs have a very definite impact on gas mileage, they aren’t con-
trollable, which means they aren’t points of improvement leverage. For the same reason,
weather should not be ranked. However, in some circumstances, you may have the flexibility
to not drive in bad weather. In that case, weather would be ranked, possibly as a critical
input.

You’re reading this book with one goal in mind: Improving your process. However, you
have to remember that improving your processes requires that you understand varia-
tion. And, to understand variation, you need to figure out how to categorize data by type
and how to summarize it with some simple tools. After you understand what type of data
you have, where it’s located, and how it varies, you’re much closer to understanding and
improving your processes. Read on — this chapter guides you through the process of
understanding and categorizing your data.
Differentiating Data Types
Data comes in different shapes and sizes. If you know what kind of data you have, you can
then figure out what type of analysis and what tools or methods you need to use in your Six
Sigma work. Your data values will either be able to be placed into named categories (this
data is called attribute or categorical data) or will follow a continuous scale (this data is called
continuous or variable data).
Attribute or categorical data is used to describe a named attribute of the characteristic or
process. This type of data is discrete, which means that the data can be counted, ranked, or
sorted, but not added, subtracted, or averaged. For example, if you had one red ball and one
blue one, it makes no sense to try to average the color.
You can ask yourself a simple question about your data that tells you whether it’s continuous:
“Can I meaningfully add or subtract values of this data?” If the answer is “yes,” you have con-
tinuous data.

Q.
You have a set of data for an ice cream
store that tells you what flavors are on the
menu:
Chocolate
Chocolate chip cookie
dough
Strawberry
Raspberry cheesecake
Butter pecan
Rocky road
Vanilla
Pistachio
Neapolitan
Orange sherbet
Mint chocolate
Bubble gum
What type of data is this?
A.
The ice cream flavors in this list are clearly
named categories, which makes it attribute
data.
Q.
Now consider having more detail for the
ice cream, such as how many cartons of
each flavor were sold last week. Using the
following table, determine what kind of
data you have:

A.
The additional information shown in the
table for the flavor categories is important.
Ask yourself: “Can I meaningfully add or
subtract values of this data?” For example,
can you add all the carton numbers
together to get a meaningful total? Yes! Or,
can you subtract the number of chocolate
cartons from the number of vanilla cartons
to find out how many more cartons of
chocolate ice cream were sold than vanilla?
Yes again! These answers tell you that this
additional data is continuous.

Calculating Measures of Variation Location
To begin to understand variation in your data, you have to be able to describe it with
numbers. The most basic numerical measures are those that quantify the location of
the central tendency of your variation — or, in other words, the values that are most
likely to occur.
When you have continuous data, you can calculate three different measures of varia-
tion location:
 Mode: The mode of a set of data is the single value that is most frequently
observed and is associated with the highest peak of a distribution.
 Median: The median of a set of data is the single value where half the data is
below and half is above. The median is the preferred measure of variation loca-
tion when your collected data contains outliers, or extreme data points well out-
side the range of other data.
You determine the median by ordering your collected data from least to greatest
and counting the total number of points. If you find an odd number of data
points, the median is the middle value, or the one exactly halfway through the
list. If you find an even number of data points, the median is the average of the
two points in the middle of the list.
 Mean: The mean — or average — of a set of data, is represented mathematically
by the symbol x:
x
n
x i
= !
where
• x (pronounced “ex bar”) is the symbol representing the calculated mean.
• xi represents each of the individual measurement values.
• Σ, the Greek capital letter sigma, tells you to sum up (add) all the individual
measurements.
• n is the number of individual measurements in your data set.

When going through the calculations for all the measures of central location, remember the 
following:
• The mode is the data value that is observed most frequently. For this pressure data, you can
see that the value of 246 kPa occurs three times — more than any other — making it the mode.
• The median is the exact middle value of the rank-ordered data. For the 24 points of this data set,
the middle value lands between ordered points 12 and 13. That makes 246 kPa the median.
• Determining the mean is more calculator intensive. But the calculation is still straightforward:
You add up all the individual data values and divide by the number of individual data points,
24, which gives you 246.6 kPa as the mean.
• The following figure is a dot plot (see Chapter 8 for practice on creating dot plots) of the collec-
tion pressure measurements. You can see how symmetrical the variation is. When variation is
symmetrical, the mode, median, and mean are often nearly identical.

Variety Is the Spice of Life: 
Measuring Variation Spread
The central location of the variation in your data is only the first of two critical param-
eters you need to quantify. The second parameter is the measure of how much varia-
tion spread you find in your data around its central location. Table 7-1 summarizes
three different measures of variation spread.

Notice how all the squared xi – x terms are positive. And notice how when you square them, you
end up with the weird units of $2, or squared dollars. As strange as that may seem, it’s ok! There’s no
such thing in the real world, but there is in the ethereal math universe. It all works out in the end.
Next, you add up all the squared dollar terms and divide the sum by one less than the number of
points in your data set (n – 1):

For now, this calculated variance number is just a first step to obtaining the standard deviation (σ).
Later, the variance will help you determine which factors contribute to overall variation when
designing experiments to improve your processes. As you mature in statistics, variance measures
become very useful tools.
The final calculation is for the standard deviation (σ). After you’ve found the variance, it’s
extremely easy to find the standard deviation — you just take the square root:

As you can see, with the standard deviation, you’ve come back down to Earth and are again using
the real-world units of dollars, instead of squared dollars. And now you have a quantitative meas-
ure of how much variation spread you have in your data.

Q.
What is the range, variance, and standard deviation in the dollar values for the following set of
invoices?
$5,242.18
$5,194.04
$5,263.70
$5,188.45
$5,217.21
$5,200.50
$5,073.54
$5,167.45
A.
The range (R) in the dollar value in this collection of invoices is the difference between the great-
est (xMAX) and the least (xMIN). By identifying these extreme values in the data, it’s easy to plug
them into the formula and arrive at the answer:
R = xMAX – xMIN = $5,263.70 – $5,073.54 = $190.16
To calculate the variance (σ2), you must first calculate the mean, x, which ends up being $5,193.38.
At this point, laying out a calculation table is helpful:

calculate the variance and standard deviation. All you have to do is enter the raw data. A great exam-
ple is Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet application. Master these tools to make your Six Sigma

Time Warp: Separating Short-Term 
and Long-Term Variation
Quantifying variation spread can be tricky because it changes over time. Over a short
period of time, the variation you observe is smaller than it will be over a longer period
of time. One of the first tasks of the Six Sigma practitioner is to separate observed vari-
ation into these two buckets — short-term and long-term.
The basic formula for standard deviation captures all the variation occurring within a
set of data. So, when your data set covers enough time to include the influence of all
the special-cause variables and factors, it’s a measure of the long-term variation.

Never try to calculate the short-term standard deviation on anything other than a
sequential set of measurements. That is, only perform this calculation on a set of meas-
urements that’s in the order that the measurements were taken. You have to use the
correct order because the calculation of the short-term standard deviation is based on
the natural ranges that occur between the characteristics’ measurements. If the order
of the measurements is altered at all, your answer will be smaller than it should be.

Chart this variation over time and calculate both the long-term and the short-term standard 
deviations.
A.
First, create a chart of this variation over the course of the 40 months of measurements, starting
with the oldest recording (month 1) and continuing to the most recent (month 40). The following
figure shows one chart example:
You can see how the variation changes over time, displaying a smaller amount of variation over
any given short subset of months as compared to the large variation that occurs over the full-time
scale.
An immediate calculation table helps in calculating both the long-term and the short-term stan-
dard deviations if you’re doing these by hand. Start by calculating the mean (x = 7.2) for the
values. Notice how the intermediate calculations in the columns of the following table are laid out

As it always should be, the short-term variation is less than the long-term variation. This makes
sense because over the long-term, factors and influences enter in, shifting the entire variation or
causing it to drift or fluctuate more than it does over any given short period.

Chapter 7: Categorizing Data and Calculating Measures of Variation

Solutions to Categorizing Data and
Calculating Measures of Variation Problems
a
Packages entering a sorting facility are labeled as having either “urgent” or “normal” priority.
What kind of data is this characteristic of the packages?
“Urgent” and “normal” are named attributes of the packages. These values can’t be meaning-
fully added or subtracted. Clearly, what you have here is attribute or category data.
b
You’re collecting weight measurements of a plated contact switch. The measurements are in
grams. What type of data is this?
Weight measurements in grams would look something like: 2.45, 3.78, 1.23, and so on. There’s
no limit to the possible weight measurements — they could be anything within a range of num-
bers. Also, this data can be meaningfully added or subtracted. For example, the combined
weight of a 1.23 gram switch and a 3.78 gram switch would be 4.01 grams. Clearly, what you
have here is continuous or variable data.
c
Each final inspection record for manufactured disk drives is stamped with a date code. What
type of data are these date code stamps?
Even though they may appear to be numerical, these date stamps are instead categorical. For
example, have you ever tried to calculate Tuesday and a half? Or, can you find an answer to
Thursday plus Friday? These situations don’t make sense, which tells you that these data
stamps are attribute or category data.
However, you can organize this data through the sequence of the days of the week: Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, and so on. When you can categorize attribute data in this way, it’s called ordi-
nal data.
d
Student grades are given as A, A–, B+, and so on. Is this attribute or categorical data? What
about grades given on a numerical grade point scale: A = 4.00, A– = 3.67, B+ = 3.33, and so on? 
Is this attribute or categorical data? What is the advantage of a numerical grade point scale?
When you have letter grades, you have attribute data. You can’t add an A to a B! And you can’t
mathematically find an average of an A and a C grade. But, if you cleverly assign a numerical
value to each letter grade, such as A = 4.00, A– = 3.67, and so on, voila, you immediately trans-
form your data from attribute to continuous data. Now, you can find an average or a numerical
difference between students’ grade point averages. Imagine the nerdy teacher who came up
with this idea!

Part III: Mastering Measuring 

The mode is the value in the data that occurs most frequently. In this case, the most frequent
value is 8, which occurs three times.
The median is the value at the midpoint of the ranked list of data. For a set of 12 measurements,
the sixth and seventh ordered numbers separate the bottom half from the top half. For the set
of data in this problem, the sixth ranked point is 10 and the seventh is 11. So, the median is the
point midway between these two values, which is 10.5.
The mean of the data set is found by taking the sum of all the measurements and then dividing
by the number of measurements in the set:

For the following home purchase price data points, does the mean or the median better com-
municate the location of the central tendency of the variation? Why?

$174,500
$177,200
$292,400
$181,000
$172,010
$169,900
The mean for this home price data is $189,876 and the median is $175,850. One way to see the
difference between the mean and the median is to plot them graphically along with a dot plot of
the raw data, like in the following figure.

Chapter 7: Categorizing Data and Calculating Measures of Variation

You can see that the median value lands within the main grouping of the data. The mean, how-
ever, is pulled outside the main cluster of the data by the one outlier point at $292,400.

Calculate the range and standard deviation for the set of home purchase prices in Problem 7 in
two ways: first with all eight data points and second by excluding the $292,400 point. With the
elimination of just this one data point, how are the range and standard deviation measurements
affected?
With all the data points, the range for the home price data is
R = xMAX – xMIN = $292,400 – $168,000 = $124,400
However, if you remove the $292,400 outlying point, the range becomes
R = xMAX – xMIN = $184,000 – $168,000 = $16,000
With all the data points, the calculation table for the home price data looks like this:

Part III: Mastering Measuring 

Chapter 8
A Picture’s Worth 1,000 Words:
Measuring with Charts and Graphs
In This Chapter
 Determining the shape of variation with dot plots and histograms
 Comparing variation distributions with box and whisker plots
 Setting up scatter plots to explore relationships between characteristics
 Creating process behavior and time series charts to see how a characteristic changes over time
N
othing communicates an idea better than a clear picture. And besides just looking
impressive, a good chart quickly reveals the important story within your data and
helps your team see previously hidden relationships between key inputs and outputs. You
and your team will be able to compare and contrast what you think is happening with what
you actually see in the charts and graphs. You should master creating the basic charts in
this chapter and should religiously use them as the very first battery of tests you perform
on all your data. You’ll be amazed at the rapid insight you gain.
Putting Dot Plots or Histograms to Use
The purpose of dot plots and histograms is to graphically show you where variation occurs
within a critical characteristic — whether it’s all lumped together within a narrow interval or
evenly spread out over a wide range of values. A dot plot or histogram will immediately tell
you how frequently various values occur in your data and will provide clues to the sources of
the variation. 
You create a dot plot or histogram by following the same simple process for both. Follow
these steps:
1. Create a horizontal line representing the scale of measure for the characteristic
you’re charting.
2. Divide the length of the horizontal scale into ten to twenty equal “buckets” between
the smallest and largest observed values.
3. For each measurement in your data set, place a dot in the corresponding bucket
along the horizontal axis.
Stack up successive dots that occur within the same bucket. To create a histogram,
simply replace the stacked dots with a bar of the same height.
4. Repeat Step 3 until you’ve placed a dot on the chart for each measurement.

Interpret your dot plot or histogram by looking for the following basic patterns:
 What shape does the data form? Do the dots (or bars) on the graph form a single
bell-shaped curve or hump? Or is there a uniform distribution across a range of
values? Are the dots clumped together with one side trailing out more than the
other?
 Where is the mode, or tallest peak of the distribution, located? Is there one peak
or are there multiple peaks?
 At what point along the horizontal axis of your dot plot or histogram do the
stacked dots or bars seem to balance out like a teeter-totter? This point is the
approximate location of the variation mean, or average.
 What is the range? The distance along the horizontal axis between the largest dot
(xMAX) and the smallest dot (xMIN) is the range (R = xMAX – xMIN).
 Are there outliers (specific points that don’t seem to fit the grouping of the rest)
in your data? Are they either too far to the right or too far to the left of the rest of
the data to be concluded as coming from the same set of circumstances that cre-
ated all the other points?

A.
Start by creating a horizontal line representing the cycle time scale of measure. On the left end,
place a tick mark for the smallest value in the data set. On the right end, place a tick mark for the
largest value. Your line should look like this:
Now, divide the horizontal scale between the max and min into equal-sized buckets. For this
example, try ten divisions. So, take the distance between the max and the min and divide it by ten
to find the bucket width:

Using this bucket width value, calculate and draw in the remaining tick marks along the horizon-
tal axis to create the ten dot plot buckets:
Now for the fun part! Place a dot for each data point in the corresponding bucket. For example,
the 11.4 cycle time measurement lands between 10.92 and 11.71. So, place a dot for this data point
in the 10.92 – 11.71 bucket, like this:

What does this dot plot tell you about the nature of the variation? Well, it actually reveals quite a
lot. Note the following:
• The shape of the variation distribution appears somewhat bell-shaped. Most cycle time meas-
urements are clustered around the middle of the distribution, with the frequency of occurrence
trailing off as you move farther out from the middle (but, as you can see, there are some extra
points near the min and max).
• The mode (the tallest peak in the dot plot) and the mean (the pivot point on the horizontal axis
where all the dots balance) both seem to be at about the same spot — in the 7.76 – 8.55 bucket,
maybe at a value of about 8.2. Check this rough visual estimate with an actual calculation of the
mean (see Chapter 7 to find out how to calculate the mean). How close is the visual estimate?
• The spread of the variation is easily seen in the dot plot. The cycle time measurements range
from 12.5 to 4.6.
• There aren’t any outlying data points that are far out on either side of the rest of the variation.

If a datapoint falls right on a bucket division, place it in either one of the buckets. As long as you
don’t put it in both, you’re okay! The min and max data points will always fall into the lowest and

Setting Up Box and Whisker Plots
Sometimes you need to quickly compare two or more variation distributions of the
same characteristic. It’s like standing two people back-to-back to see who’s taller. But,
in this case, you’re asking questions such as “Which distribution is more spread out?”
and “Which has the higher central location?” This is when box and whisker plots come
in handy.
These plots, which are usually called box plots, can be created by following these steps:
1. Rank order each of the sets of data, from smallest value to largest value, that
you’ll be including in your box plot.
2. Separately for each set of data, divide your rank-ordered data into fourths, or
quartiles, as statisticians like to say:
• From xMIN, the smallest observed point, to a point called Q1 is the lower
quartile of the points in your data set.
• From Q1 to the median of your data set is the second quartile of the points
(see Chapter 7 to find out how to calculate the median of a data set).
• From the median to a point called Q3 is the third quartile.
• From Q3 to xMAX, the largest point in your data set, is the fourth quartile.
3. Draw a horizontal or vertical axis to place the box plot on.
Create a numerical scale along this axis that spans from just below the smallest
value of all the data sets to just above the largest value.
4. For the first data set, locate along the axis the points for xMIN, Q1, the median,
Q3, and xMAX.

5. Draw a box between the Q1 and Q3 points.
6. Place a heavy line through the box at the point of the median.
7. Draw whisker-like lines extending from the Q1 and Q3 points to xMIN and xMAX,
respectively.
8. Repeat these same steps for each successive subgroup distribution you’re
including for comparison with your box plot.
On the same axis, draw each successive distribution next to the previous one.
You now have a graphical picture for comparing the variation distributions to
each other.

With the data rank ordered, you can easily pick off the xMIN and xMAX points for each set of measure-
ments. For Line A, xMIN = 92,078 and xMAX =122,249. For Line B, xMIN = 78,915 and xMAX = 129,140.
Finding the median for each data set is also easy. (Refer back to Chapter 7 if you need a quick
refresher!) The Line A median is 108,043 and the Line B median is 92,879.

112
Part III: Mastering Measuring 
To find Q1 and Q3, just look for the data points that correspond to the first and third quarters of
the data. For Line A, with 24 data points, you divide by four so each quarter consists of 6 points.
That means that Q1 will be the average of the sixth and seventh points in the rank ordered data
(100,256), and Q3 will be the average of the 18th and 19th points (114,087). For Line A, that leads
to Q1 being 100,256 and Q3 being 114,087. For Line B, with 20 data points, Q1 is at the fifth rank-
ordered point (84,400) and Q3 is at the 15th (104,966).
With the calculation of all these points prepared, your next step is to create an axis to put your
box plots on. You can make your axis either up and down (vertical) or left to right (horizontal). It
really doesn’t matter. This axis represents the scale of measure of your data. So, if your scale of
measure feels natural to be seen left to right rather than up and down, make your axis horizontal.
Time is a good example of a variable that is usually plotted left to right. Temperature is one that is
normally vertical. For the production volume data of this example, a vertical axis will work fine.
Draw a vertical line for the axis, create tick marks along its length to indicate the scale, and plot
points for each of the values — xMIN, Q1, median, Q3, and xMAX:
For the box plot for Line A, all you need to do now is draw the box between the Q1 and Q3 points.
Then draw thin whiskers from the box edges out to xMIN and xMAX. You complete the box plot for
Line A by putting the line through the box at the point of its median, like this:

Seeing Spots: Using Scatter Plots
Scatter plots help you explore the relationship between two characteristics. As the
values for Characteristic A increase, for example, what happens to values for
Characteristic B? Do they also increase? Or do they decrease? Or neither?
To create a scatter plot, you must have pairs of measurements for each observation —
measurements for each characteristic taken at the same point in time, under the same
conditions. Otherwise, there’s no basis for exploring the relationship between the two
characteristics or variables.
You can create a scatter plot by going through the following steps:
1. Form data pairs that represent x-y points from the collected data.
For each observation, pair the simultaneously measured values for the two char-
acteristics together to form an x-y point that can be plotted on a two-axis x-y
graph.
2. Create a two-axis plotting framework.
To create your framework, draw two axes, one horizontal and the other verti-
cal. Draw one axis for each of the two characteristics you’re exploring.
The scale for each axis should be in the units that correspond to its assigned
characteristic — millimeters for length, pounds for weight, minutes for time,
number of defects found on an inspected part, or whatever the units may be
that quantify the characteristics you’re exploring.
3. Plot each x-y pair as a point on the two-axis framework.

Scatter plots can be created when one of the two characteristics is not measured on a
continuous scale, but instead consists of attribute data (see Chapter 7). For example,
the characteristic of “production volume” (measured on a continuous units-per-hour
scale) can be plotted against the characteristic of “production line ID” (perhaps named
Line A and Line B).
You interpret your scatter plot by looking for relationships or patterns between the
two plotted characteristics. Look for:
 Graphical correlation between the two plotted characteristics or variables. If
there’s no pattern in the plotted points — just a random scattering of points —
then there’s no correlation or relationship between the characteristics.
Clustering of the plotted points or patterns that follow the shape of a line or a
curve reveal correlation between the two variables.
 Direction of correlation between the variables. When there are patterns, does
an increase in one variable lead to an increase in the other? Or a decrease in one
lead to a decrease in the other? If so, there is a positive relationship between the
variables. But if a change in one variable leads to a change in the opposite direc-
tion for the other, there is a negative relationship between the variables.
 Strength of effect between the variables. How drastic or steep is the linear rela-
tionship between the variables? If a small change in one variable leads to a large
change in the other, you’re observing a strong effect between them.

A.
What do you think? Is it clear from the listed data whether a relationship exists between the two
variables? Creating a scatter plot will help you answer this question.
The first step is to recognize that each week’s measurements form an x-y data pair. That’s because
each measurement is linked in time. For this example, assign the production speed settings to the
horizontal axis and the compressed air pressure to the vertical axis.
Begin your scatter plot by creating the horizontal and vertical axis framework and by plotting
each week’s data pair, like this, for Week 1:
Notice how the plotted point lines up with the 22.6 value on the horizontal axis and the 85 psi
value on the vertical axis. Finish creating the scatter plot by repeating this process for all the
weeks’ data pairs:
Is there a pattern here? Yes. The plotted points follow a trend that slopes downward as you move
from left to right. This means you’ve discovered a relationship between the production speed set-
ting and the compressed air pressure variable. As the production speed setting increases, the
compressed air pressure goes down. And, as you decrease production speed, air pressure goes
up. This is a negative relationship.

The strength of the relationship is determined by the slope of the general line formed by the plot-
ted data. The figure below draws in a line that roughly fits the pattern in the plotted points.
For every 2 units of increase in production speed setting is a 20 psi decrease in the air pressure.
Another way of saying this is that there is a 10 psi change in air pressure for every 1.0 change in
the production speed setting. Knowing this fact about the relationship helps you forecast what
the pressure will be for any setting of production speed, and vice versa.

Hindsight Is 20/20: Using Process 
Behavior or Time Series Charts
Dot plots, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots all neglect an important variable —
time. To see how a characteristic changes over time, you have to plot its measure-
ments in the sequence or series in which they occurred. When variation behavior is
linked to time, you’re then able to link process behavior and changes back to historical
events or conditions — such as the changing of a work shift, the gradual dulling of a
cutting tool, or the steady jitter of the status quo.
A time series or process behavior chart is made by simply plotting measured perform-
ance on a vertical scale against a horizontal scale representing the progress of time.
When a process is free of special causes or outside influences, its behavior, or meas-
ured performance, bounces randomly around a central, flat level on the behavior
chart. Most of the observed variation will be clustered close to this central level. And,
every now and then, some measurements will land farther away from the central level.
This variation will be completely random over time, without patterns or trends.
You interpret your behavior chart or time series plot by looking for signs of variation
that are out of the ordinary. After you’ve identified non-normal behavior, you investi-
gate what historical event (or special cause) could have caused such a change in 
performance.
Drawing process behavior charts or time series charts isn’t difficult. The part that is
trickier, however, is interpreting these charts. For that reason, the example and prac-
tice problems for this section will concentrate on interpretation rather than on the
mechanics of creating the charts.

13. A CEO is concerned about his company’s recent monthly expenses. After some temporary success
in reducing expenses two months ago, it’s now the second month in a row since then that expenses
have increased. And the expenses in this latest month are 6 percent higher than the same month a
year ago. The CEO’s plan is to enact a spending freeze on all departments to fix the problem. If that
doesn’t work, he says, “Heads are going to roll!” To check the validity of the CEO’s plan, you create
a time history chart of the company’s expenses over the previous 21 months, as shown here:
Based on the time series data, do you agree or disagree with the CEO’s plan? Why?

Two things stand out from the normal variation of the boss dimension. First, at time 2:55, a single
point is observed much higher than the normal level of the rest of the variation — this is an out-
lier. Later, starting at about 4:00, you can see an upward trend. After the trend, from about 4:30
and on, the central level of the dimension variation seems to stay at this higher level. These out-
of-the-ordinary observations — the outlier and the trend — indicate that something abnormal has
affected the injection mold process.

Create a 10-bucket dot plot or histogram with the purchase order data shown in the original
problem earlier in the chapter.
Start by creating a horizontal line representing the dollar scale of the purchase order data. As
shown in the following figure, on the left end of the line, place a tick mark for the smallest value
in the data set, and on the right end, place a tick mark for the largest value:
Next, divide the horizontal scale between the max and min into 10 equal buckets. To find the
width of the buckets, divide the distance between the max and the min by ten, as shown below:

Use your dot plot or histogram from Problem 1 of this chapter to describe the variation of the
purchase order data. What’s the shape of the variation distribution? Where’s the variation cen-
tered? How spread out is the variation? Are there any outliers in the data?
This dot plot tells you about the nature of the variation in the purchase order measurements in
the following ways:
 The shape of the variation distribution isn’t bell-shaped. Most cycle time measurements
are clustered on the left or lower end of the histogram with a secondary grouping occur-
ring at the far right or higher end. This behavior may be evidence of a bi-modal distribu-
tion (two separate distributions mixed on one chart), which may have occurred due to
higher spending in the last two months of the fiscal year.

 The mode (the tallest peak in the dot plot) is located at the far left end of the dot plot in
the $797.54 – $879.19 data bucket, and the mean (the pivot point on the horizontal axis
where all the dots balance) seems to be around the value of about $1,125.00. This large
difference between the mode and the mean tells you that the data is clearly not normal,
but is skewed.
 The spread of the variation is easily seen as ranging from $1,614.07 to $797.54, or a value
of $816.53.
 No outlying data points appear away from the rest of the variation distribution other
than the possible bi-modal indication.

Draw a 12-bucket dot plot or histogram for the processing time measurements shown in the

a tick mark for the largest value:
Next, divide the horizontal scale between the max and min into 12 equal buckets. To find the

The dot plot of Problem 3 tells you about the nature of the variation in the processing time
measurements in the following ways:
 With the exception of the two isolated points on the right, the shape of the variation dis-
tribution is somewhat bell-shaped, with most processing time measurements clustered
together in a normal shape.
 The mode is located near the left end of the dot plot in the 6.22 – 6.73 minute bucket.
Because of the two extreme points on the right, the mean seems to be a bit higher than
the mode, at around the 6.73 – 7.23 minute bucket. This relatively small difference
between the mode and the mean tells you that the data is nearly normal.
 The spread of the variation ranges from 11.30 minutes to 5.20 minutes, or a value of 6.10
minutes.
 The two extreme data points on the right are outliers. Ask yourself what caused these
two measurements to be so different from all the rest.

Create a box plot for the set of monthly sales figures shown in the original problem earlier in
the chapter.
The first step is to rank order the data, as shown here:

$13,245

$15,705

$30,221
10
$32,689
11
$38,267
12
$60,231
With the data rank ordered, you can easily pick off the xMIN and xMAX points. For this monthly
sales data, xMIN = $13,168 and xMAX = $60,231.
Finding the median is also easy. Because you have an even number of measurements (12), the
median is the average value of the middle two points — $22,281.
To find Q1 and Q3, you have to calculate the average between the points that divide the four-
point quarters. For Q1, you calculate the average of the third and fourth ranked points. For Q2,
you calculate the average of the ninth and tenth ranked points. That leads to Q1 being $15,928
and Q3 being $31,455.
With the calculation of all these points prepared, your next step is to create an axis to put your
box plot on. For the monthly sales dollar values, you usually settle on a vertical axis. Draw a
vertical line for the axis, create tick marks along its length to indicate the scale, and plot points
for each of the values — xMIN, Q1, median, Q3, and xMAX.
123
Chapter 8: A Picture’s Worth 1,000 Words: Measuring with Charts and Graphs

All you need to do now is draw the box between the Q1 and Q3 points and then draw thin
whiskers from the box edges out to xMIN and xMAX. You complete the box plot by putting the line
through the box at the point of its median, like this:

Describe the variation of the monthly sales data from Problem 5 of this chapter. Now suppose
the monthly sales data is from the previous twelve months. What amount of sales would you
expect for the next month following?
The drawn box plot shows that the monthly sales variation is mostly near the lower end, with
a few months’ instances rising up to high values. The median is toward the lower end of the
observed range of data. All things staying the same, you’d expect future monthly sales figures
to fit this same shape. So, taking a guess at what the next month’s value will be, you’d have to
say that it would be somewhere between about $16,000 and $30,000.

a much wider spread. Product B stands out from the others — its level of warranty returns is
significantly higher than either Product A or C. The product that has consistently lower war-
ranty returns is Product A.

A company performed an experiment where glue samples were allowed to cure for different
lengths of time. They then measured the force required to peel away the glue bond. Create a
scatter plot by using the data from the original problem earlier in the chapter.
The x-y data pairs to be plotted are the cure time and peel force for each sample. Make the cure
time the horizontal axis and the peel force the vertical axis and begin plotting the points. The
completed plot should look something like this:
j
Describe the relationship, if any, between the cure time and the peel force variables from the
scatter plot of Problem 9 of this chapter.
When looking at the plot for Problem 9, it’s clear that the points aren’t just randomly scattered.
Instead, they roughly form a line. That means there is a relationship between the two variables.
If you look more closely, you see that an increase in cure time leads to an increase in peel force.
And a decrease in cure time leads to a decrease in peel strength. When the same directional
changes happen in both variables, that means it’s a positive relationship. If you draw a rough
line through the clustered dots in the plot, as shown here, you see more about the relationship:

Peel Force (lbs)

Part III: Mastering Measuring 

From the slope of the line, you can see that every tenth of a minute increase in cure time results
in a 0.2-pound increase in peel strength and vice versa — every tenth of a minute decrease in
cure time leads to a 0.2-pound reduction in peel strength.
By creating a scatter plot, you can even go as far as forecasting what the peel strength will be if
you know the cure time. For example, if you cure a specimen for exactly five days, it will have a
cure strength of about 7.3 pounds.
k
Describe the relationship, if any, between the Input X3 variable and the Output variable shown
in the scatter plot from the original problem earlier in the chapter.
Something out of the ordinary is going on in the relationship between variables Input X3 and
Output. The dots aren’t randomly scattered on the plot. Note the great spread of variation on
the left side of the plot. As Input X3 gets bigger though, the amount of variation reduces, which
means that some mechanism in the system must be affecting the amount of variation as Input
X3 changes.
l
Describe the relationship, if any, between Variable D and Variable C shown in the scatter plot
from the original problem earlier in the chapter.
The scatter plot for this problem is a great example of a set of points that are randomly distrib-
uted. There aren’t any trends, patterns, or groupings in the plotted points, which means that no
relationship exists between the two variables — Variable D and Variable C.

the same month a year ago. The CEO’s plan is to enact a spending freeze on all departments to
fix the problem. If that doesn’t work, he says, “Heads are going to roll!” To check the validity of
the CEO’s plan, you create a time series chart of the company’s expenses over the previous 21

Reviewing raw numbers is difficult and often misleading. Plotted or charted data, on the other
hand, immediately reveals information that would be very difficult to see otherwise. In this
problem, the CEO is being misled. If he looked at the stream of monthly expenditures plotted
over the last several months, he would quickly see that the monthly amount fluctuates ran-
domly over time. There is no evidence that the efforts to reduce expenses have had the desired
effect, and the increase observed in the last two months is easily within the typical variation
expected for this variable. Therefore, nothing out of the ordinary has occurred and any special
intervention would be premature and possibly counterproductive.

easuring performance is at the core of Six Sigma. Fundamentally, measuring perform-
ance isn’t complicated — you just count how many times things go wrong compared
to how many times they go right.
Yield and defect rate are the metrics you use in Six Sigma to communicate how often things
go wrong, or on the flip side, how often they go right. To be effective in Six Sigma, you need
to be fluent in calculating and translating between these different yield and defect rate meas-
urements. This chapter explains how.
Get Real: Creating Realistic Specifications
Specifications represent the specific limit values that separate good performance from poor
performance — they define what’s acceptable and what’s not. Specifications form the basis to
determine what process outputs or characteristics are either good or bad.
It’s critical that you don’t set your specifications arbitrarily. If a specification is set too loosely,
your performance may upset or dissatisfy your customer even though it meets the specifica-
tion. And, unfortunately, the excuse, “But we met our specifications,” won’t appease your
unhappy customer. On the other hand, if a specification is set too tightly, you’ll spend more
time and money than you should getting the characteristic performance always inside the
overly narrow goalpost.
The mind-jogging acronym, RUMBA, helps you check the appropriateness of any specification:
Reasonable: Is the specification based on a realistic assessment of the customer’s
actual needs? Does the specification relate directly to the performance of the charac-
teristic?
Understandable: Is the specification clearly stated and defined so that there is no 
argument about its interpretation?
Measurable: Can you measure the characteristic’s performance against the specifica-
tion? If not, there will be a lot of debate between you and your customer as to whether
the specification has been met or not.

Believable: Have you bought into the specification setting? Can you and your co-
workers strive to meet the specification?
Attainable or Achievable: Can you reach the level and range of the specification?
You need to review each specification to make sure it passes the RUMBA test. If it falls
short in any of the RUMBA categories, you should begin developing a plan to bring the
rogue specification back under control.
You can use the following handy checklist to make sure a specification passes the
RUMBA test:

Getting It Right the First Time: Calculating
First Time Yield (FTY)
With an appropriate specification in place, you can move on to calculating the yield per-
formance of your process or characteristic. And, as you probably know, the goal of Six
Sigma is to do things right the first time. Instead of comparing the number of good
items that eventually come out of a process to the total number of items started (which
completely misses the extra inspection, rework, and effort expended), first time yield
(FTY) accurately measures how well your process works in its true form — without any
makeup. FTY is the basic measure of a process’s real capability, or ability to produce
good items the first time.
The formula for first time yield (FTY) is
FTY
in
in
scrap
rework
=

where in is the number of items started into the process, scrap is the number of items
that end up unusable, and rework is the number of items requiring additional effort to
meet the specification.

Rolling Many into One: Calculating Rolled
Throughput Yield (RTY)
A product or process rarely consists of only a single opportunity for success or failure.
Some, like an automobile, have hundreds of thousands of component specifications
that must be met. More precisely, they all must be met simultaneously for the car to
operate properly. Combining the yields for each of these opportunities is called rolled
throughput yield (RTY). Whether it’s a series of process steps or a collection of compo-
nent parts in a product, RTY tells you how well the entire system works together.

Q.
The following figure illustrates a purchase order process that’s made up of five individual
process steps. What’s the RTY of this process?
A.
For this purchase order process, the rolled throughput yield is calculated as follows:
RTY = FTY1 × FTY2 × FTY3 × FTY4 × FTY5
RTY = 0.75 × 0.95 × 0.85 × 0.95 × 0.90
RTY = 0.518

“How Bad Is It, Doc?” Calculating
Defect Rates
The complementary measurement to yield is defects. If your yield is 90 percent, 10 per-
cent of your units contain one or more defects. Measuring defects and calculating the
rate, or how often the defects occur, is like looking at the flip side of the yield coin.
A basic assessment of characteristic or process capability is to measure the total
number of defects that occur over a known number of units produced. This number is
then transformed into a calculation of how often defects occur on a single unit, which
is called defects per unit (DPU).
When you need to compare the defect rate of one product or process to the defect rate
of a different product or process, you first have to put the rates for each into compara-
ble units — you want to compare apples to apples. You can compare the defect rates
of different products or processes by counting the number of observed defects in the
units inspected and compare this count to the total number of opportunities for suc-
cess or failure in the inspected product or process. When you compare defect rates in
this way, the metrics you use are defects per opportunity (DPO) and defects per million
opportunities (DPMO).
The following equations show you how to calculate DPU, DPO, and DPMO. No order is
important. Which one or ones you use depends on your situation and what you’re
trying to communicate:

What’s Missing? Linking Yield to Defects
When you have an overall process with a relatively low defect rate — say, a process
that produces units with a DPU less than 0.10 (or 10 percent) — you can mathemati-
cally link the process defect rate to the overall process yield:
RTY = e–DPU and
DPU = –ln(RTY)
where e in the equation is a mathematical constant equal to 2.718 and ln is the natural
logarithm function. 
On your scientific calculator or spreadsheet program, you’ll find a function or key for
raising e to any number. (Look for the ex key on your calculator.) You’ll also find the
same for the ln function.

A water heater production facility is showing a 97 percent yield at the final test step in its
assembly process. As you look deeper, however, you find that this yield calculation only
includes the number of units that must be scrapped at the end of the test. In reality, 62 percent
of all units fail final inspection on their first attempt and must be corrected before they pass.
What’s the true FTY of this production system?
Because 97 percent of the water heaters eventually make it through the final test step, this
means that the other 3 percent end up scrapped, as the problem description says. Combining
this scrap number with the provided rework number of 62 percent allows you to use the FTY
formula on a per 100 (percent) basis:

A cellphone keypad has 17 specified dimensions and characteristics. If each of these specifica-
tions is met with 99 percent accuracy, what’s the chance of getting a defect-free keypad?
Rolled throughput yield (RTY) is calculated by simply multiplying all the yields together for the
characteristics of a system. So, for this problem, because each of the 17 characteristics runs at
99 percent, the RTY is 0.99 multiplied by itself 17 times:
RTY = FTYn = 0.9917 = 0.843 = 84.3%

To find RTY, you multiply all the FTYs:
RTY = FTY1 × FTY2 × FTY3 × FTY4 × FTY5 × FTY6 × FTY7
RTY = 0.92 × 0.95 × 0.90 × 0.99 × 0.98 × 0.89 × 0.87
RTY = 0.591 = 59.1%

A football coach is trying to improve his offense’s ball possession. Looking back at game films,
he finds that his offense has committed 12 turnovers through 305 plays from scrimmage, giving
the team an overall probability of retaining possession at 96 percent for any single play. What’s
the probability of the team retaining possession for 16 consecutive plays?
Even though this problem deals with sports, the math is no different. If the probability of the
offense retaining possession on a single play is 0.96, or 96 percent, the chance of retaining pos-
session for 16 consecutive plays is 0.96 multiplied by itself 16 times:
RTY = FTY16 = 0.9616 = 0.53 = 53%
Even with a very high chance of retaining possession on a single play, you can see why coaches
get gray hair when trying to get their teams to have long, sustained drives — the chances of a
turnover quickly multiply!

So, the emergency room, with its DPO of 0.034, has a slightly higher defect rate.
Putting these into defect per million opportunities (DPMO) units tells you how many defects
will occur when a million patients go through each of these hospital departments:
DPMOER = DPOER × 1,000,000 = 0.034 × 1,000,000 = 34,000
DPMORAD = DPORAD × 1,000,000 = 0.025 × 1,000,000 = 25,000
139
Chapter 9: Yield and Defects: Calculating the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

So, the total DPMO for the two departments together is:
DPMOTOT = DPMOER + DPMORAD = 34,000 + 25,000 = 59,000

easurement is the foundation of knowledge and subsequent improvement. Measurement
is the tool you use to verify that you have come to the right answer, have corrected
the problem, or have improved the situation. Measurement is unavoidable because you
can’t observe anything without the filter of some kind of measurement system — your eyes,
your brain, your perception, a ruler, a stopwatch, or a laser interferometer. Everything comes
to you through some kind of measurement system “lens.” Because measurement is so impor-
tant, you need to know whether your measurement system is giving you an accurate picture
of reality.
As is always the case, no measurement system is ever perfect. Your job in Six Sigma is to
start by finding out how good your measurement system is. You have to ask whether it’s
good enough to base decisions on and whether it’s consistent. Then ask: Is it accurate? How
much of the error or variation you observe is a result of the measurement system itself? A
good start at answering these basic questions is to perform a measurement system audit.
Read on to find out how.
Your Basic Sanity Check: Auditing
Measurement Systems
An audit is when you compare your measurements to a known, correct standard. In an audit,
your goal is to determine how often the recorded measurement hasn’t matched with what it
should be. Here are some points to remember when performing a basic audit on a measure-
ment system:
 Experience has shown that human inspection systems detect only about 80 percent of
actual defects. Remember that eyewitness accounts often are incomplete or wrong. If
you want to use human inspection, you need to take precautions to try to make them
accurate enough for your needs.

 If your measurement system is one that classifies problems or defects into cate-
gories, a Pareto chart (or bar chart) of the number of problems or defects placed
into each category shouldn’t be flat or even across the charted categories.
Instead, about 80 percent of the total defects should come from a smaller subset
of the possible defect categories. If the Pareto chart of your defects is flat, that
means your measurement system probably isn’t accurately reflecting reality. Also,
if a Pareto chart of classified defects looks extremely peaked, with almost all
defects in a single category, your measurement system doesn’t have enough dis-
criminating power and needs to be addressed. (Refer to Six Sigma for Dummies
for background on creating and interpreting Pareto diagrams.)

Q.
A stockroom manager uses a computer system to track inventory. The computer system is
updated from production records, meaning that when a product is counted in the computer system
as having been finished in production, the items in its Bill of Materials are automatically subtracted
from the computer inventory. The stockroom manager wants to know how accurate this computer
measure of inventory really is. So, one day he went out into the stockroom and performed a very
careful physical count of all items. Here’s what he found for a selection of critical inventory items:
Item
Physical Count
Computer Count
Polymer resin
20,452 kg
21,310 kg
Spindle motors
17,721 units
17,750 units
Fasteners
51,897 units
52,000 units
Adhesive
44 barrels
42 barrels
Label sets
18,366 pairs
18,370 pairs
Packaging
20,204 units
20,180 units
What is the accuracy of the computer inventory measurement system?
A.
You can quickly calculate how close each computer system value is to the actual, physical count
number by calculating the amount each inventory item is “off” (the difference between the com-
puter count and the physical count) and transforming the amount “off” into a percentage (divid-
ing each amount “off” by the actual physical count of each item). This method is accomplished
by adding two columns to the table, as seen below:
Item
Physical Count
Computer Count
Amount “Off”
Percent “Off”
Polymer resin
20,452 kg
21,310 kg
858 kg

The average percent that these critical items is “off” by is 1.54 percent. This average tells you
how close your computer inventory is from being fully accurate. In other words, this measure-
ment system is 98.46 percent accurate.  

145
Chapter 10: Mastering Measurement System Analysis (MSA)
As a further check, you can create a Pareto or bar chart to show how “off” each of the selected
inventory items is. Here’s what the chart looks like:
By looking at the Pareto chart, you can see that the accuracy of the adhesive and polymer resin is
much different than the rest of the inventory items. This fact tells you that the inventory measure-
ment system is following the Pareto principle, which states that about 80 percent of the problem
is arising from about 20 percent of the items. This ratio is exactly what you’d expect when a meas-
urement system is operating correctly. However, if the bars of the Pareto chart had all been about
the same height, you’d suspect something was fishy. To improve this inventory measurement
system, you’d want to start with the way the stock levels for adhesive and polymer resin are
accounted for in the computer system.

Do We Agree? Performing an Attribute
Measurement System Analysis 
The purpose of some measurement systems is to categorize items by their attributes —
to separate “good” items from “bad” ones, sort samples into “blue,” “green,” and “cyan”
groups, and assign invoices to “engineering,” “production,” or “sales” departments.
These types of measurement systems are called attribute measurement systems because
they determine or measure one or more attributes of the item being inspected.
The question is, how repeatably and reliably can one of these systems determine the
specific attribute you’re looking for? For example, how repeatably and reliably does
your attribute measurement system detect “bad” disk drives from among all the
“good” ones being completed in production? To quantify how well an attribute meas-
urement system is working, you perform an attribute measurement system analysis.
Here are the steps to complete an attribute measurement system analysis:
1. Set aside 15 to 30 test samples of the item you’re measuring.
Make sure these samples represent the full range of variation being encountered
and make sure approximately equal amounts of each possible attribute category
(for example “pass” or “fail” or “blue,” “green,” or “cyan”) are present within the
samples you’ve set aside.
2. Create a “master” standard that designates each of the test samples into its
true attribute category.

3. Select two or three typical inspectors and have them review the sample items
just as they normally would in the measurement system, but in random order.
Record their attribute assessment for each item.
4. Place the test samples in a new random order, and have the inspectors repeat
their attribute assessments. (Don’t reveal the new order to the inspectors!)
Record the repeated measurements.
5. For each inspector, go through the test sample items and calculate the per-
centage of items where their first and second measurements agree.
This percentage is the repeatability of that inspector. To determine the repeata-
bility of the overall attribute measurement system, calculate the average
repeatability for all three inspectors.
6. Going through each of the sample items of the study, calculate the percentage
of times where all of the inspectors’ attribute assessments agree for the first
and second measurements for each sample.
This percentage is the reproducibility of the measurement system.
7. You can also calculate the percent of the time all the inspectors’ attribute assess-
ments agree with each other and with the “master” standard created in Step 2. 
This percentage, which is referred to as the effectiveness of the measurement
system, tells you how consistently the measurement system correctly measures
the true attribute it’s looking for.

Q.
Imagine you’re starting up a Six Sigma project. It involves reducing the number of parts rejected
from a manufacturing process that makes shear pins. As the pins are completed, they’re
reviewed by an inspector and either passed or failed (and scrapped). Before you get too far into
your project, you decide to perform an attribute measurement system analysis to make sure the
pass-fail assessments of the pins are reliable. How would you go about doing this analysis?
A.
You specially arrange 15 random shear pin parts — about half (8) known to be good and half (7)
known to be bad. Then you pick three inspectors for the study. After randomizing the order of
the parts and having each inspector measure the parts two different times, you record their
pass-fail measurements. A filled-out worksheet for your attribute measurement system analysis
is shown in the next figure.
The worksheet helps guide you through the steps of the calculations of the analysis. Here are the
actual calculation steps:
• To find the repeatability of the individual inspectors, first count the number of times each
inspector’s measurements agree between the two trials. Then, divide this by the number of
parts inspected and multiply by 100 to get the percent repeatability. 
• To find the overall repeatability, calculate the average of the three individual inspector
repeatabilities.
• The overall reproducibility is calculated from a review of how many times all three inspectors
agree with each other.
• The overall effectiveness of the system is calculated from a review of how many times all three
inspectors agree and their agreement matches the designated “master” standard.
You can see by the worksheet that the overall repeatability of this measurement system is 84.4
percent, which means that if you repeated the measurements on the same set of pins, you’d have
an 84.4 percent chance of getting the same result — a marginally acceptable level. But, the over-
all reproducibility, or how well this system will do given a different set of pins or different set of
inspectors, is only 60 percent. This is not good enough for valid measurements. As a result of
your analysis, your first project task has to be to improve the pass-fail measurement system for
the shear pins. After you have valid measurement data, you can proceed if necessary.

Gauging Gages: Analyzing Continuous
Variable Measurement Systems
Many measurement systems operate in the realm of continuous variable data. To illus-
trate this point, think about thermometers, rulers, and stopwatches — all these are
used to measure variables that vary continuously rather than just fall into attribute
buckets such as “small,” “medium,” or “large.” For example, the temperature in your
room right now may be 71.2 degrees. Thirty minutes later, the temperature may be
70.8 degrees. A thermometer can capture these up and down changes. But as with all
measurement systems, some of the observed change is due to variation from the meas-
urement system itself.
When dealing with continuous variable measurement systems, the total variation you
observe is a combination of the actual variation of the parts or process you’re investi-
gating and the variation from the measurement system itself. Mathematically, this can
be written as
σ
σ
σ
OBSERVED
ACTUAL
MEASUREMENTS
2
2
2
=
+
Ideally, you want the part of the observed variation stemming from your measurement
system to be as small as possible. That way the actual part or process variation won’t
be clouded or drowned out by the measurement variation.
When you study the “goodness” of a continuous variable measurement system, you do
experiments and calculations to quantify the observed variation, the actual variation,
and the measurement system variation. These studies usually involve two to three
inspectors and five to ten process outputs or characteristics to measure. Each inspec-
tor also measures each process output or characteristic two to three times. 
At this stage, statistical analysis software, such as Minitab or JMP, is used to automati-
cally calculate the observed, actual, and measurement system variations. Interpreting
the results of your continuous variable measurement system analysis is straightfor-
ward, but is often glossed over in the explanations of your software tool. After your
software spits out values for σOBSERVED,σACTUAL, and σMEASUREMENTS, you must clearly under-
stand how to interpret them if you want to know whether you’re using an adequate
measurement system. You interpret these values by creating a ratio between
σMEASRUEMENTS and σOBSERVED.
Table 10-1 summarizes the ratio values you may get, describes the situation, and helps
you interprets the results.

able. If more reliable measurements are necessary, you need to make changes to the temperature

Solutions to MSA Problems

You perform an audit of your company’s employee information system. Whenever a new
employee is hired, the hiring manager is required to gather specific background information for
the employee, such as spouse’s name, home address, emergency contact, and so on. So, you
select a few random employees and pull their filed background sheets. You then have the
employees review each of the 20 fields that the hiring manager filled in to verify they’re all cor-
rect. Check the original question earlier in the chapter to see what you found in your audit.
Each background form has 20 fields, so the accuracy as a percentage of any form would be the
number of correct fields (20 minus the number of errors) divided by the total number of fields
(20). The table below shows the calculated accuracy percentage for each background form
audited:

Create a Pareto chart of the error type data from Problem 1 to see whether you can find evi-
dence of a deeper problem with the system that captures employee background information
(see original question earlier in the chapter for more details).
The Pareto chart for the types of errors with their stated quantities would look like the follow-

Chapter 10: Mastering Measurement System Analysis (MSA)

You can see that the Pareto diagram looks just as it should — about 20 percent of the cate-
gories accounting for about 80 percent of all the errors. This tells you that the variation in the
measurement system is normal and that there is no cause for alarm.
c
Using the scenario from Problems 1 and 2, list some specific actions you can take to improve
the accuracy of the employee background information system.
Here’s a list of some immediate actions that can be taken to improve the employee background
information (you may have thought of others):
 Have the new employee, instead of the hiring manger, fill out the form.
 Send a copy of each employee’s background form to the employee annually for review.
Doing so gives the employee a chance to update addresses, phone numbers, or other
information that may be obsolete.
 Have the appropriate background information copied over from the same information
already recorded on the official company job application.
d
An analysis of a length measurement system — that is, a ruler — produces a breakdown of the
variation in the system (see the original question earlier in the chapter for details). What is
your diagnosis of the measurement system?
Start by calculating the ratio of the standard deviation of the measurement system to the stan-
dard deviation of the total observed variation.
This ratio shows that the variation from the length measurements accounts for only a small
portion of the observed variation. In fact, this is better than the 0.10 rule of thumb. You can
trust the measurements from this ruler and can go forward knowing that your work is based
on a sound foundation of data.
e
The results of your measurement system analysis of the method you use to measure sliding
friction on a conveyor system are revealed (see the original problem earlier in the chapter for
details). Is the measurement system reliable?
The way you can tell whether this is a reliable measurement system is to construct the ratio of the
standard deviation of the measurement system to the standard deviation of the entire system. 
The standard deviation for the measurements themselves isn’t given. But, you can calculate it
just by knowing the other two components:

This ratio value is higher than 0.3, which means that your measurement system isn’t capable of

apability is a measure of how well a product or process is able to meet a specific
requirement. If PGA Tour fairways are 30 yards wide, the capability of a golfer’s tee
shot is his or her measured ability to stay within this 30-yard width. Does the golf ball stay
on the fairway all of the time? Part of the time? How capable is the golfer? “Poor,” “pretty
good,” or “Tiger Woods good” are basically useless measures of capability in Six Sigma
because they’re too vague. They offer no improvement traction. In this chapter, you prac-
tice how to calculate the precise capability of a process or characteristic. With a proper
capability metric in hand, you can compare the performance of one process to another, you
can determine how many items will end up outside the required performance limits, and
you’ll have a basis for measuring performance improvement.
Many of the formulas for capability rely on measures of the average and short- and long-term
standard deviation. Flip to Chapter 7 to find out how to calculate these average and standard
deviation values.
Calculating and Interpreting Sigma (Z) Scores
The sigma (Z) score is one of the most basic ways to describe the capability of a process or
characteristic (see Table 11-1). For example, if you know the Z score, you can quickly look up
the corresponding level of defect rate performance.
Calculating a sigma score is straightforward. A small Z is the number of short-term standard
deviations you can fit between the mean value of the process’s or characteristic’s perform-
ance and its nearest specification limit (SL).

Q.
A plastic housing part has a critical
length dimension of 32.30 ± 0.10 mm.
You’ve measured a short-term sample
of housings and calculated the following
about the variation in this characteristic:
x = 32.34
σST = 0.017
What is the sigma (Z) score for this criti-
cal characteristic? What is its expected
long-term defect rate?
A.
The sigma (Z) score is how many short-
term standard deviations you can fit
between the mean and the nearest specifi-
cation limit. In this example, the measured
mean of 32.34 mm is slightly closer to the
upper specification limit of 32.40 mm. So
the formula is:

This characteristic is operating at a sigma
level of 3.53 — not quite Six Sigma level.
What is the defect rate? You find this by
finding the calculated Z value and then
looking up the corresponding DPMO
value. From Table 11-1, you can see that
the Z entry for 3.50 has a DPMO of 22,750.
This characteristic has a slightly higher
Z value than that, which means that its
performance will be slightly better. So,
roughly estimating, the characteristic’s
DPMO will be about 21,000.

designing, there is a screw boss that must
be positioned 5.010 inches from a datum
feature on the part. If your engineering
department’s policy is that all dimensions
must have a sigma (Z) value of 6, at what

Anything shorter or longer than this
results in a defect. What change in defect
rate will you get if you adjust the process
average to be centered at 1371⁄2 minutes?
Solve It

Shift Happens: Transforming Between 
Short- and Long-Term Performance
The calculation of a process’s or characteristic’s sigma (Z) score is a based off its
short-term standard deviation. Short-term standard deviations are easy to measure;
you just go out and quickly capture a data sample from the process or characteristic.
But in the sigma (Z) value look-up tables, like in Table 11-1, the defect rate or yield
listed is for the corresponding long-term performance. For example, a process with
a short-term sigma (Z) value of 6 will have a short-term defect rate of 0.001 DPMO. But
as you can see from Table 11-1, it will have a long-term defect rate of 3.4 DPMO.
Why all the mixing of short- and long-term values? The reason is that early Six Sigma
practitioners found it easier and more practical to gather a short-term sample and cal-
culate a short-term standard deviation and Z score, but at the same time they wanted
to convey the loss of capability that always occurs over the long-term. To accomplish
this, the early practitioners contrived the now-famous 1.5-sigma shift and built it right
into all of their sigma (Z) score tables.

Part IV: Assessing the Right Approach to Your Analysis 
Q.
An engineering design manager has just
been told that the most recent set of pro-
totypes for a soon-to-be-launched product
has a defect rate of 0.621 percent, or 6,210
per million. The manager turns to you
and remarks, “This is great! At this rate,
we’ll be able to launch full-scale produc-
tion overseas rather than proving things
out first here.” Do you agree with the
manager’s assessment?
A.
Prototypes are always treated with spe-
cial care: They’re carefully crafted and
assembled and tuned and maintained.
And usually only a few are made. What
this means is that prototypes provide
short-term data because they don’t cap-
ture all the variation effects that occur
over the long-term. So, the key point to
keep in mind in this example is that the
6,210 DPMO reported for the prototypes
is a short-term measure of the product’s
defect rate.
In the long-term, however, the sigma (Z)
score for the product will degrade.
Referring to Table 11-1, a DPMO of 6,210
corresponds to a short-term sigma (Z)
value of 4. In the long-term, the Z score will
be 1.5 less than this, or 2.5. This value cor-
responds to the true long-term DPMO of
158,655. As real production for the product
ramps up, specialized prototype tooling
will be replaced by multi-cavity production
tooling, multiple suppliers will begin pro-
ducing raw materials, and full production
staffs will be used for assembly. All these
changes lead to extra sources of variation
that the prototype never encountered.
So, you can tell your manager that with a
defect rate of 158,655 per million, the soon-
to-be-launched product isn’t quite ready
for off-shore production.

Calculating and Interpreting
Capability Indices
Six Sigma practitioners use indices to communicate the capability of a process or char-
acteristic. These indices, CP, CPK, PP, PPK, each compare the width of the process’s or
characteristic’s specification requirement to its short- or long-term variation width.
Knowing these index values, you can quickly figure out how the process or character-
istic is performing and you can compare the capabilities of different processes to
each other. See Table 11-2 for an outline of the formulas and descriptions for each
capability index.

adds extra cost with no benefit. The manager of the pizza chain wants to know how capable the
chain is at meeting this requirement, so over a period of time she counts the number of pepperonis
on small pizzas. From her data, this is what she finds:
x =9
σST = 0.33
σLT = 0.50
Calculate CP, CPK, PP, and PPK and describe the current situation at the pizza chain. How many pizzas
will end up being outside the required range of 8 to 12 pepperonis? Then, based on the calculated
capability indices, devise an improvement strategy for the pizza chain.
A.
Recognizing that the upper specification limit (USL) is 12 and the lower specification limit (LSL) is
8, you can plug the average and standard deviation values from the manager’s measurements into
the formulas from Table 11-2 to calculate all the capability indices, like this:

The long-term defect rate for the current situation at the pizza chain can be found by multiplying
the calculated CPK by 3 to get the sigma (Z) value and then looking up the corresponding defect
rate in Table 11-1:
Z = 3CPK = 3 ⋅1.00 = 3.00

At a Z of 3, Table 11-1 shows that the long-term defect rate will be 66,807 per million. That’s about
6.7 percent of customers who will think that their pizza has either too many or too few pepperonis.
How should the pizza chain improve its capability? Because CP ≠CPK ≠PP ≠PPK, this situation falls
into the first listed scenario in Table 11-3. The improvement step for this diagnosis is to eliminate
the special, out-of-the-ordinary causes of variation. By doing so, the short-term and long-term
standard deviations will be equal, making CP = PP and CPK = PPK. The improvement plan for this diag-
nosis is to center the process variation between the 8 and 12 specification limits. With this accom-
plished, CP = CPK = PP = PPK and the pizza chain is operating at its entitlement level.

Your company has payment terms of net 30 days on its accounts receivables. Any payment
received later than 30 days is considered late. You’ve measured a sample of payment data and
found the average payment time to be 25 days with a standard deviation of 2 days. Calculate
the sigma (Z) score and estimate the DPMO for this process.
The specification limit in this problem is the 30-day limit on accounts receivables. Knowing the
average or mean (25 days) and the standard deviation (2 days), you can plug these into the for-
mula to calculate the sigma (Z) score:

A fill-volume setting for a 1-liter bottle filling process is set at 1.1 liters, which provides a small
cushion against the bottle being filled too low. A sample shows that the average fill volume is
actually 1.15 liters with a standard deviation of 0.10 liters. Calculate the sigma (Z) score and
indicate about how many bottles will have a fill volume lower than the 1.1-liter production limit.
Knowing the 1.1-liter specification level, the average (1.15 liters), and the standard deviation
(0.1 liters), you can plug these values into the formula to calculate the Z value:

Your preferred plastic injection molder tells you that when all things are carefully controlled,
he can operate his process to a standard deviation of 0.001 inches for critical dimensions. In
the plastic part you’re designing, there is a screw boss that must be positioned 5.010 inches
from a datum feature on the part. If your engineering department’s policy is that all dimensions
must have a sigma (Z) value of 6, at what plus or minus value do you set the specifications for
this dimension?
In this problem, you’re not solving for Z. Instead, you’re solving for the plus or minus tolerance
(±Tol) that needs to be specified around the target design nominal of 5.010 inches. The first
thing, then, is to use some basic algebra to rearrange the formula into a form that will calculate
the ±Tol value:

Now, plugging the provided values into the rearranged equation, you get:

With the plus or minus tolerance value being 0.006 inches, the specification limits for the design
will have to be between 5.016 and 5.004 inches in order to meet your 6 sigma design goal.

The reaction time of a certain chemical process is, on average, 145 minutes with a standard
deviation of 31⁄3 minutes. The requirement for the reaction to be completed is between 135 and
150 minutes. Anything shorter or longer than this results in a defect. What change in defect rate
will you get if you adjust the process average to be centered at 1371⁄2 minutes?

Chapter 11: Capability: Matching Performance to Need

The closest specification limit to the process average is 150 minutes. So, plug this value,

The long-term sigma (Z) score for a critical characteristic is 2.5. What will the defect rate for
this characteristic be in the long-term?
ZST = ZLT + 1.5 = 2.5 + 1.5 = 4.0

The short-term sigma (Z) value for correctly filling out a loan application form is 3.7. What is
the short-term defect rate for this application form?
Because Table 11-1 gives long-term defect rates for short-term sigma (Z) scores, you have to
adjust the Z value you look up by 1.5. By looking at the table, you can see that the long-term
defect rate for the short-term sigma (Z) value of 3.7 is about 14,000 DPMO. The short-term
defect rate will be found at a sigma (Z) value of 1.5 sigma higher than this, or 5.2. At a Z of 5.2,
Table 11-1 shows that the defect rate is about 100, which is the short-term defect rate for the
short-term sigma (Z) value of 3.7.

When you measure one car’s fuel efficiency, you find that the sigma (Z) score for it meeting
your company’s minimum fuel efficiency requirement is 2.2. What will the Z score and defect
rate be for the company’s entire fleet of cars?
Measuring one car provides a short-term estimate of the sigma (Z) value of the company’s
entire fleet. The long-term Z for the fleet will be 1.5 sigmas less than this, which in this case is a
value of 0.7. But in Table 11-1, you can only look up the short-term Z value to find the long-term
defect rate. In this case, the long-term defect rate corresponds to the look-up value of 2.2 in
Table 11-1, or about 250,000 DPMO.
Estimating a value between two entries in a table is called interpolating. For example, a Z value
of 2.2 falls between 2.0 and 2.5 in Table 11-1, but not exactly in between; 2.2 is a little closer to
2.0 than it is to 2.5. In fact, the value of 2.2 is located exactly two-fifths of the way from 2.0 to
2.5. So, the corresponding DPMO value for 2.2 will be two-fifths of the way from 308,538 to
158,655. You can solve for this value mathematically with the following expression:

An accounting firm takes, on average, 39 days with a short-term standard deviation of 3 days to

percentage of clients who will wait longer than 45 days for their taxes to be completed.
First calculate the adjusted short-term capability index CPK. In this exercise, you only have an

What is going on in a process when the calculated CP is the same as the CPK?

Outline an improvement strategy for the scenario described in Problem 12.
Reviewing the answers from Exercises 12 through 16, you can see that both of the following are
true:
CP ≈ PP
CPK ≈ PPK
Fitting this into the various scenarios of Table 11-3, you can see that the prescription to this
diagnosis is to first work on centering the process average, which needs to be set as closely
as possible to the middle of the specification, at a value of 110. 
Subsequently, if more improvement is still needed, you would begin to eliminate common
causes, which would reduce the short- and long-term standard deviations of the process.

hat the wheel is to transportation, sampling is to statistics. Statistical sampling
allows you to understand an entire population that’s too large to measure individu-
ally by inspecting only a few, representative samples of the population. For example, what’s
the average height of European males? If answering that question required you to locate and
measure every man on the continent, you’d never finish! However, the invention of statisti-
cal sampling allows you to find the answer by measuring only a small representative sample
of the population. (Next time you meet a statistician, be sure to stop and thank him for his
contribution to humanity!)
There’s one catch to using samples though: When you work with a sample instead of the
entire population, you may discover that your sample doesn’t exactly represent the popula-
tion. In fact, the smaller your sample, the greater this potential for error becomes. (Can you
honestly say that the average of Pierre’s and Hans’ heights accurately represents the average
height of all men in Europe?)
Statisticians have studied sampling to an almost sickening extreme. They use the Greek sym-
bols, such as µ and σ, to represent the exact population parameters and the Roman symbols,
such as x and s, to represent the calculated parameters of a sample. What they’ve found is
that each time you take a different sample from the same population and calculate the
sample’s mean or its standard deviation — or any other statistical measure — you end up
with a slightly different calculation result. When you collect the repeated sample calculations
together, they form what’s called a sampling distribution. And statisticians know exactly how
wide this variation will be depending on how many data points are in your sample.
A confidence interval quantifies the potential variation around your calculated metrics, such
as the mean or the standard deviation. If, for example, you’re basing your mean calculation
off of a sample rather than off of the entire population (which is almost always the case), a
confidence interval allows you to say, “With 95 percent confidence, I know the average height
of the European male population is between 1.75 and 1.78 meters.”
Because in the real world you almost always work with calculated values from samples instead
of entire populations, it’s important that you know how to quantify the potential error in your
measurements and how this quantification affects your decisions. This chapter provides exam-
ples and practice problems that help you become an expert in creating confidence intervals
around your calculations.

Creating Confidence Intervals for Means
Whenever you use the calculated average of a sample (x) to infer what the average of
the entire population (µ) is, you have a potential for error. Confidence intervals for
means allow you to quantify how much your inference may be off based on the
number of data points in your sample.
When your sample has 30 or more data points, the confidence interval for the calcu-
lated mean is:
x
Z
n
s
µ
!
=
where
 µ is the true population mean
 x is the calculated sample mean
 F is the sigma value corresponding to the desired level of confidence you want
to have
 s is the sample standard deviation
 n is the number of data points in your sample
On the other hand, when your sample has fewer than 30 data points, the confidence
interval for the calculated mean must instead be based on an adjusted t value, which
depends on the size of your sample. Here’s the equation:
x

A.
The first thing you must recognize is that
your sample is large enough (greater than
30 data points) that you can use the F for-
mula for calculating the confidence inter-
val for the mean. Reviewing that formula,
you need to know values for the sample
mean (x), F for a confidence level of 95
percent, the sample standard deviation
(s), and the number of data points in your
sample (n). x and s can be calculated
quickly from the 32 measurements
(refer to Chapter 7 if necessary). From
Table 12-1, the F value for 95 percent 
confidence is 2. Now, just plug these
values into the formula:

A
Even though the calculated mean for the
sample is exactly 0.069, you haven’t meas-
ured every switch in the 10,000-part pop-
ulation, which means that you don’t have
exact certainty in estimating the popula-
tion mean. What you can say with 95 per-
cent confidence, though, is that the true
population mean lies between 0.067 and
0.071.
Q.
Suppose now that you’ve received a second
10,000-part shipment of the same type of
switches as in the last example problem.
This time, you take a 25-piece sample and
find the sample mean (x) to be 0.074 and
the sample standard deviation (s) to be
0.005. With a 95 percent level of confidence,
can you tell whether a difference exists
between the average plating thickness for
the two 10,000-part shipments?
A.
For an n = 25 sample, you have to use
the t formula to calculate the confidence
interval for the population mean. From
Table 12-1, the t value for a 25-point
sample at 95 percent confidence is 2.11.
So, you can figure the confidence interval
for the mean as follows:

A
Comparing the confidence intervals for
the two shipments, you can see that they
don’t overlap — the predicted range for
the first shipment is completely different
from the predicted range for the second
shipment. This indicates that, with 95 
percent confidence, you can say that a
difference does exist between the average
plating thickness of the two shipments,
with the second shipment being 0.004
thicker on average than the first.
If the two confidence intervals in the
example had overlapped, you would have
had to conclude that no difference
existed between the averages of the two
shipments. Overlap in the confidence
intervals is what you look for when com-
paring means.

Calculating Confidence Intervals
for Standard Deviations
Just as with the mean of a sample, the standard deviation of a sample (s) doesn’t
exactly tell you what the true population standard deviation (σ) is. But, you can bind
your calculation with a confidence interval surrounding the true value. And just as
with confidence intervals for means, the more data points you have in your sample,
the tighter your confidence interval for the population standard deviation will be.
Confidence intervals for standard deviations are based on the χ2distribution:

When comparing two sample standard deviations, you can determine which popula-
tion standard deviation is larger by creating a confidence interval around the ratio of
their corresponding sample variances. If the confidence interval includes the value of
1, no detectible difference exists between the population standard deviations. But, if
the range of the confidence interval ends up being greater than 1, the population stan-
dard deviation from the numerator of your ratio is greater than the population stan-
dard deviation from the denominator. And the reverse is also true: If the range of the
confidence interval ends up being less than 1, the population standard deviation from
the numerator of your ratio is smaller than the population standard deviation from the
denominator.
Confidence intervals for the ratio of two variances are based on the F distribution:

When you’re given an F value to look up, it will be in the form of F(c, r), which helps
you determine which column and row to look in. For example, the first value given for
looking up F — the “c” in F(c, r) — tells you which column to look in. The second value
given — the “r” in F(c, r) — tells you which row to look in. So F(10, 25) would be in the
column corresponding to c = 10 and the row corresponding to r = 25, giving a value
of 2.300.

Part IV: Assessing the Right Approach to Your Analysis 
Q.
You have a 10-point sample of purchase order data from a longtime supplier to your company,
ACME Engineering Services, Ltd. Here’s the data:
$29,309.46
$32,935.89
$24,977.75
$32,518.55
$27,061.33
$32,756.21
$29,461.38
$27,500.59
$30,561.79
$33,986.21
Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval for the population standard deviation of this data.
A.
Reviewing the formula for the confidence interval for a standard deviation, you need to know
the sample standard deviation (s), the size of the sample (n), and the correct χ2
LOWER and χ2
UPPER
values corresponding to your sample size and to 95 percent confidence. The calculated sample
standard deviation (refer to Chapter 7 if necessary) is $2,972.53. You need to look up the χ2
values from Table 12-2. For 95 percent confidence and a sample size of n = 10, the values are
χ2
LOWER = 19.301 and χ2
UPPER = 2.628. Now just plug these values into the formula as follows:

So, from your 10-point sample, you can say with 95 percent confidence that the true population
standard deviation lies somewhere between $2,029.82 and $5,500.91.
Don’t be surprised if your calculated confidence interval for a standard deviation looks very wide.
Unless you have a lot of data points in your sample, your confidence interval will be wide because esti-
mates of standard deviations are always less accurate than estimates of means.

Q.
Now, in addition to the supplier from the previous example, suppose that you have a second sup-
plier, Jones Brothers, LLC, with a standard deviation from a 25-point sample of their historical
purchase orders of $3,500. With 95 percent confidence, is there a difference in the variation of
these two suppliers?
A.
To compare the width of the populations of these two suppliers, you create a confidence interval
for the ratio of their variances. You need to know the sample standard deviations for each sup-
plier (s1 and s2), the size of the sample for each supplier (n1 and n2), and the F statistics following
the pattern in the formula for the confidence interval. After you have all of the required numbers,
you can plug them into the formula like this:

Reviewing the calculated limits of the confidence interval, you can say that with a confidence of
95 percent that the ratio includes the value of 1. So, you know that the width of the variation of
the first supplier is no different than the width of the second supplier.

Four Out of Five Recommend: Using
Confidence Intervals for Proportions
Sometimes, the data you’ve collected creates a proportion, such as 8 “good” disk drives
out of 10 disk drives inspected. The group of 10 disk drives inspected in this example
is a sample of the larger population of total disk drive items produced. So, you can
create a confidence interval. You can also create confidence intervals around the dif-
ference between two proportions.
If y is the number of items identified out of the total number inspected (n), the propor-
tion is written mathematically as
n
y
The confidence interval around the true population proportion (p) is written as
/
/
p
n
y
Z
n

y n

To compute p, all you need to know is y (the number of items identified out of your
sample), n (the actual number of items in your sample), and F (the sigma value corre-
sponding to the level of confidence you want your interval to have).
The confidence interval for the difference between two proportions is written as:

In reality, proportions can never be less than zero or greater than one. So, if the calcu-
lated confidence interval for your proportion exceeds these natural limits, just adjust
the confidence interval to the natural limit.

The shock sensors work like this: Capsules
inside the sensors break when they experi-

a viewing tube to fill with dye. So, you take

Whenever confidence intervals overlap, you can say that no significant difference exists
between the populations. Suppliers C and D, for example, overlap, meaning they’re the same.
Suppliers A and B, on the other hand, have obvious gaps between them. So, they’re different
from each other and from Suppliers C and D.

You’ve developed two alternative curing processes for an adhesive. Now you need to determine
which one results in a higher shear strength for the adhesive. Knowing that you’ll conduct 25
tests using each process and estimating that the standard deviation of both processes will be
1.2 pounds, how large must the difference be between the sample means of each of the 25 tests
before you declare with 95 percent confidence that one process is better than the other?
The average performance of the adhesives will be statistically different if their confidence inter-
vals don’t overlap. With the same standard deviation, the same number of samples, and the
same t value, the minimum difference between the means would have to be as follows:

the variances for each of the two samples and you need to know the correct F value based on
the sizes of the two samples.
For this problem, the sample size from Problem 5 is n1 = 25 and the sample size from Problem 6
is n2 = 10. Using the previously calculated values for the sample standard deviations from
Problems 5 and 6, you can plug these values into the F value equation like this:

At a 95 percent confidence level, is there a difference in the population variances of the data in
Problems 5 and 6?
The ratio of these two variances and the surrounding confidence interval show that the width
of the variation from Problem 5 is much larger than the width of the variation in Problem 6.
If the two variations were the same, the confidence interval of their ratio would have included
the value of 1.

You review 17 purchase order forms from the previous year. Out of the 17 forms, 12 have no
mistakes. Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval for the true population proportion of
correct purchase orders for the previous year.
To create this confidence interval for the true population proportion, you just need to plug the
values into the formula. Remember that a confidence level of 95 percent corresponds to a F
value of 2. Here are the calculations:

Chapter 12: Narrowing Your Inputs with Confidence

You’ve just received a shipment of 2,000 shock sensors. Your plan is to place these sensors into
some of your own shipments to see whether they’re exceeding the 10g shock limit your cus-
tomers require of you. The shock sensors work like this: Capsules inside the sensors break
when they experience any shock above 10g’s, which causes a viewing tube to fill with dye. So,
you take 12 shock sensors from your shipment and give them a known shock of 15g’s. Eleven
of the shock sensors properly break, which indicates that the 10g shock level was exceeded.
Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval for the proportion of the entire shipment that will
work properly.
In this exercise, the total number inspected (n) is equal to 12 and the number of successes (y) is
equal to 11. So, the 95 percent (F = 2) confidence interval for the true proportion is as follows:

Your marketing team has conducted two focus group sessions to evaluate a new product
design. The first focus group consisted of teenagers and resulted in four out of five of the teens
liking the new product. The second group was made up of parents of young children. Only one
out of five people in this group said that they liked the same new product as the teens. With 90
percent confidence (F = 1.64), can you say that there is a difference between the views of these
two populations?
This exercise requires you to use the formula for calculating the confidence interval around the
difference of two proportions. It’s just a matter of plugging in the right values for the first and
second proportions. Here’s the formula:

Because the calculated confidence interval for the difference is positive, you know that there is,

Four out of five and 40 out of 50 are the same proportion. So why should you treat these pro-
portions differently?
The answer to this problem is all in the size of the samples. Four out of five produces a much
less confident measure of the true proportion than 40 out of 50 does.

Quantifying Variable Relationships
In This Chapter
 Calculating how much correlation there is between variables
 Determining equations with curve fitting
 Making sure fitted lines are valid
A
fter you’ve defined your most important process or product outputs (Ys) and those
process or product inputs most likely to affect them (Xs), you need to understand and
quantify the relationship between them. The first step is to identify which Xs are correlated
to Y. You can get hints about correlations by looking at scatter plots, discussed in Chapter 8.
But to be sure, you need to quantify the correlation and test for statistical significance. You
can also develop an actual line equation mathematically relating X to Y.  This chapter covers
these topics.
Quantifying Correlation between Variables
Correlation is a frequent and popular subject of the news: “High income linked to schooling
outcomes,” “Low-fat diets correlated with reduced heart disease,” and “Sodas contribute to
obesity.” Almost every day a headline reports on a new study linking two variables together
in a cause-effect relationship.
Correlation is all about quantifying the strength of the relationship between two variables.
You want to know whether it’s a loose relationship or whether it’s so strong that by knowing
one variable, you can predict the other confidently.
To quantify the linear relationship between two variables (x and y), you use the following for-
mula to calculate their correlation coefficient (r). The equation may seem complicated, but it’s
actually quite simple when you break it down:

where n is the number of data pair measurements,
xi and yi are the individual x-variable and y-variable measurements, taken at the same time or
within the same subject to create a data pair,
x and y are the averages of the x- and y-variable measurements, respectively,
σx and σy are the standard deviations of the x- and y-variable measurements, respectively, and
Σ is the Greek letter telling you to sum up all the x

n terms from 1 to n.

The calculated correlation coefficient value has some interesting properties:
 The calculated r will always be between –1 and 1.
 The sign of r tells you the direction of the relationship between the variables.
If r is positive, then when one variable increases in value, the other variable will
also increase. The opposite is also true: If one variable decreases, the other vari-
able will also decrease. This is called a positive correlation.
If r is negative, then when one variable increases in value, the other variable will
decrease, and vice versa. This is called a negative correlation.
 The absolute value of r tells you how strong the relationship between the vari-
ables is.
The closer r gets to its theoretical limits of –1 or 1, the stronger the correlation
is. An r equal to –1 or 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship, with all the x-y
points lying exactly on a straight line.
An r close to 0 indicates an absence of a linear fit, or correlation to the data.

Q.
An HR manager has just finished a Six Sigma training course. She’s been working on understand-
ing the perception among new hires that the hiring process the company uses “stinks.” Over the
last year, the HR manager has had all new hires complete a survey rating their hiring experience.
A score of 20 on the survey means that a new hire thought the hiring experience was wonderful,
whereas a survey score of 0 means that the new hire thought the process was awful. On a hunch,
the HR manager has created data points for each employee hired over the last year, combining
how many days it took the person to be hired with the person’s new-hire survey score. The tabu-
lated and plotted forms of the following data pairs are shown in the accompanying figure:

An r of –0.67 indicates a medium level of correlation between the time it takes to hire the employees
and their satisfaction with the hiring process. Also, because this value is negative, you know that if the
hiring time increases, the employee’s satisfaction is likely to decrease. So, to improve satisfaction, the
HR manager should work to shorten the hiring time.

Fitting Lines to Variable Relationships
Curve fitting goes a step beyond correlation. In curve fitting, you actually determine the
equation for the curve that best fits your x-y data. Armed with this information, you
can quantitatively predict what effect one variable will have on another.
The most basic curve to fit to your data is a straight line. The equation for a line fitting
your data can be written as y
/ = β0 + β1x + ε where β0 defines the intercept where the line
crosses the y axis and β1 defines the slope of the line. ε represents all the variation that
isn’t due to the linear relationship (meaning what the fitted line doesn’t capture — flip
to the next section for more about ε). You calculate β0 and β1 from these equations:

Chapter 13: Quantifying Variable Relationships
You start the calculation table by computing the mean or average for both the x and y data. After the
mean and average are calculated, they feed into the calculation of the other columns. At the end,
you sum up the (xi – x)yi and (x – x)2 columns. As a final step, you divide the sum of the (xi – x)yi
column by the sum of the (x – x)2 column. This calculation gives you the β1 term. Knowing β1, you
use the formula β0 = y – β1x to solve for β0.
By plugging in the values you calculated, you find that the equation for the best-fit line through
the data is: y = 23.54 – 0.34x.
You can plot this line through the set of points to see how it fits, as in the following figure. As you
can see by the figure, the line does in fact fit.

Assessing the Adequacy of a Fitted Line
Fitting a line to your data isn’t always statistically valid. Sometimes no significant rela-
tionship exists, and sometimes a line isn’t the right type of curve to fit your data. So
each time you fit a line to your data, you need to check to make sure that the result is
statistically valid.
You need to remember several things about checking the adequacy of your fitted line
model:
 Residuals are the errors between your actual data and the prediction of your
fitted line model. Each point in your data set has a residual (ei), which can be
written mathematically as:
ei = yi – y
/
i
where yi are the actual, observed data values and y
/
i are the predicted values
from your fitted line equation.
To determine whether your fitted line equation is statistically valid, you need to
plot the residuals in several different ways to make sure they appear normally
distributed, which is the criteria for your line equation to be statistically valid.
Using your residuals, create the following plots:
• A scatter plot of the residuals (ei) versus the predicted values ( y
/
i) from
your line equation
• A scatter plot of the residuals (ei) versus the observed xi data
• If you collected your observed xi, yi data sequentially over time, a run order
chart of each of the residuals (ei) versus their preceding residuals (ei–1)
• Additional scatter plots of the residuals (ei) versus other x variables that
you didn’t include in your equation

 Calculate the coefficient of determination (R2) for your fitted line using this formula:

R2 should generally be greater than 0.8 for a strong linear fit. Lesser values of R2
should be used with caution for predictions.

cance of the fitted line:

If the left side of this equation is greater than the right side F statistic from the
look-up table in Chapter 12 (Table 12-3), you can say that the line you fitted to
your data is statistically significant with 95 percent confidence.
 ε represents a random, normal distribution centered at a value of zero. This value
is an inherent part of your predictive linear equation. An estimate of the standard
deviation of the ε distribution can be calculated using the following equation:

The estimate of the standard deviation of the ε distribution comes in handy when you
want to mimic what might happen in reality. You use your derived linear model to pre-
dict the average or expected performance of the output y
/ and then add to it a random
number generated from the ε distribution — with a mean of zero and standard devia-
tion equal to σ
/
ε. In this way, you can simulate what would happen if your process or
characteristic were repeated over and over again.

Chapter 13: Quantifying Variable Relationships
Again, these residuals all look normal and random, with no clumps, trends, or patterns. Because
this example includes no other x variables, and because the data measurements weren’t taken
sequentially, you don’t need to check any other residual plots.
Next calculate the coefficient of determination R2 for the fitted line. You calculate R2 by dividing
the sum of the ( y
/
i – y)2 column by the sum of the (yi – y)2 column, located at the right side of the
calculation table. The result looks like this:

An R2 of 0.45 means that only 45 percent of the observed variation of the data is explained by the
fitted line. That percentage is not so hot. If you used the equation of the fitted line to predict
employee satisfaction with the hiring process, most of the time you wouldn’t be very close.
A final test of validity can be done by calculating the F statistic with the following formula:

The story here is that because your calculated F statistic is greater than the look-up test statistic
of F(1,10) from Table 12-3 (flip to Chapter 12), a weak linear relationship exists that is statistically
valid for your fitted line. However, the line only accounts for 45 percent of the total variation, so
there may be errors or other factors that weaken the relationship. This low percentage is a signal
to investigate further before making predictions.
A final piece of information you can glean from the fitted line is an estimate of the standard devia-
tion of ε, which is the portion of the line equation that’s unaccounted-for variation. You just plug
the values from the calculation table into the formula like this:
.

So, the full equation for the fitted line ends up looking like this:
y = 23.54 – 0.34x + N(0, 2.98)
Overall, you can say that the HR manager definitely has a statistically significant fitted line for the
hiring data. But, she has to consider that fitted line only explains 45 percent of the observed varia-
tion. The rest is unaccounted-for random variation with a standard variation of 2.98.

An improvement project leader is trying to understand whether the length of time an assem-

assembly. The leader has collected data on some assemblies — how long they were allowed
to cure in the oven and how strong each adhesive bond ended up being after curing. Here are
the data pairs for each assembly:

After going through all of the calculations, you should determine that the correlation coefficient
r is 0.90. This value indicates that a strong, positive correlation between the two variables
exists. When cure time goes up, bond strength goes up too. When cure time goes down, bond
strength also goes down.

As you can see by Table 13-5, the correlation coefficient r for this set of data is 0.04, which isn’t
a good correlation between the variables.
The next step would be to look for other, stronger correlations, test for statistical significance,
or investigate higher-order relationships.

In this example, the correlation coefficient r ends up being –0.15. Here the correlation between
the two variables is weak. The correlation is also negative, which means that when the x value
increases, the y values decrease, and vice versa.
d
A news story reports that reading comprehension has been found to be correlated to a
person’s height. What’s your response to this reported cause-effect relationship?
In this practice problem, you can see that someone has misunderstood the tool of correlation.
Even though a correlation exists numerically between a person’s height and his or her reading
comprehension, it’s probably due to the fact that in general, older, taller individuals naturally
have learned to read better than those people who are younger and shorter — height isn’t the
causing factor, but instead is just an indicating factor.
Correlation doesn’t automatically indicate cause.

Using the line equation you created in Problem 5, calculate the expected bond strength for an

The scattering of the residuals versus the predicted values looks randomly distributed. No
problems here. Now plot the residuals (ei) column of the calculation table versus the observed
x values (xi) (see the next figure).
Still, after studying the plot in the figure, everything appears normally and randomly distrib-
uted. The residuals don’t point to any problems with the fitted line equation.
Now calculate the coefficient of determination (R2) for the fitted line by dividing the sum of the
( y

An R2 of 0.80 means that 80 percent of the observed variation of the data is explained by the
fitted line. That’s just enough to have confidence in your predictions from the line. If you use

be fairly close to the right answer.

Your calculated F statistic is greater than the look-up test statistic of F(1,13) from Table 12-3

Your calculated F statistic is much less than the look-up test statistic of F(1,16) from Table 12-3

With this poor of a fit, you have no reason to perform any other checks — your fitted line

hapter 13 shows how Xs are related to the critical Ys. Now you have to determine what
causes these effects. The questions you have to ask yourself are, “What can I adjust or
change to improve my Ys?” and “What’s the ideal adjustment to make?”
The answer to all of these questions is simply: You have to experiment. Experimenting is at the
heart of Six Sigma. We’re not talking about trial-and-error or knee-jerk experiments — we’re
talking about thoughtfully planned and designed experiments. Design of experiments (DOE) is 
a topic large enough to fill an entire For Dummies book by itself. To give you immediate profi-
ciency, however, this chapter gives you practice in planning, conducting, and analyzing the
most common type of experiment used in Six Sigma — the 2 k factorial. 2k factorial experiments
can be adapted to provide screening, characterization, or optimization information.
Don’t Be a Frankenstein: Planning Experiments
Every experiment in Six Sigma targets a better understanding of the Y = f(X) relationship
between the input Xs and the output Ys of the process or system being improved. Better
understanding from experimentation includes:
 Knowing which input Xs have a significant effect on the output Y and knowing which Xs
are insignificant
 Formulating and quantifying the mathematical relationship between the significant Xs
and the output Y
 Discovering where to set the values of the significant Xs so that they combine to pro-
duce the optimal output value of Y
Fight the urge to rush into an experiment. You can never spend too much time planning and
designing your experiment. In fact, shifting some time up front to the planning and design
phase of experimentation almost always saves time later, and it ensures that the resources
you expend provide viable information.

When planning your 2k factorial experiment, take the following items into consideration:
 2k factorial experiments are best suited to studying two to five input variables.
So, first narrow your investigation down to this smaller subset of likely suspects.
Typically, these are factors that have already been found to have a statistically
significant impact on the output variable of interest. Your selected variables, or
factors as they’re often called, can be either continuous or attribute variables.
(In case you’re wondering, the “k” in 2k represents the number of factors in your
experiment.)
 Select exactly two experimental levels for each input variable — one “high” and
one “low” — which span the range you want to investigate for each variable.
(The “2” in 2k represents the number of levels for each factor in your experiment.)
 Your factorial experiment will have 2k experimental runs. For example, if you
have three factors, you will have 23 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 experimental runs. Each run
represents a unique setting of the factors at their high and low levels.
 Create a coded experiment design matrix that captures each of the 2k unique
experiment settings by creating a column for each of the factors and a row for
each of the 2k runs. Using –1’s as codes for the “low” variable settings and +1’s
as codes for the “high” settings, start with the left-most factor column. Fill in this
column’s cells with alternating –1’s and +1’s. With the left-most column filled in,
move on to the next column to the right and repeat the process — but this time
fill the column in with alternating pairs of –1’s and +1’s. Fill in the next column to
the right with alternating quadruplets of –1’s and +1’s, and so on, repeating this
process from left to right until, in the right-most column, you have the first half
of the runs marked as –1’s and the bottom half as +1’s. This table of patterned
+1’s and –1’s is called the coded design matrix and represents the experimental
settings for each of the 2k experimental runs.

Q.
An engineer at a food processing plant is getting ready to conduct an experiment. With this exper-
iment, she wants to understand how the input variables of the caustic cleaning process reduce
the pressure differential across the plant’s filter system. The input variables are
• The temperature of the caustic cleaning solution. In the past, solution temperatures ranging
from 65 to 85 degrees Celsius have been used successfully.
• The time the caustic cleaning solution is allowed to contact and flow through the filter sur-
faces. The duration of the cleaning is sometimes as low as 10 minutes and sometimes as high
as 45 minutes.
• The concentration of the acid in the caustic cleaning solution. Records show that concentra-
tions of 4 to 8 percent have been used.
Help the engineer select the levels for the experiment factors and create a coded design matrix
for a 2k factorial experiment.
A.
Three factors will be included in the engineer’s experiment. A good practice is to select the high
and low experimental levels for each factor by reviewing what operating ranges have been used in
the past. So, going through each factor:
• X1: Temperature: The high level could be set at 85 degrees Celsius and the low level could be
set at 65 degrees Celsius.
• X2: Time: The high level could be set at 45 minutes and the low level could be set at 10 minutes.
• X3: Concentration: The high level could be set at 8 percent and the low level could be set at 4
percent.

Now, you have to put these factors and their levels into a coded design matrix. This experiment,
which has three factors, will have 23 = 8 unique runs. You lay out the coded design matrix by creat-
ing a table with a row for each run (eight in this case) and columns for each of the factors. In the
Temperature column you fill in the values for each row with alternating –1’s and +1’s. In next
column to the right, you fill in alternating pairs of –1’s and +1’s. Finally, in the right-most column,
you fill in alternating quadruplets of –1’s and +1’s. When completed, your table should look like
this:
Run
X1: Temperature
X2: Time
X3: Concentration

This coded design matrix shows you what the factor settings will be for each run in your experi-
ment. For example, run Number 6 will have a temperature at its +1 “high” setting (85 degrees
Celsius), time at its –1 “low” setting (10 minutes), and concentration at its +1 “high” setting 
(8 percent).

Managing Those Pesky Nuisance Variables
In almost every experiment, you have variables that can affect the Y outputs that aren’t
explicitly included in your experiment design plan. For example, an experiment studying the
effect of depth of cut and cutting speed on a machined surface finish doesn’t include the
variable of the machinist: Whether the machining operation is performed by Bob or Hank
may affect the results of the surface finish. The experiment also doesn’t include cutting tool
sharpness: Meaning that as the cutting tool dulls during the experiment runs, it may begin
to have an impact on your results. In a well-designed experiment, these influential factors
are addressed and managed so that the results of the experiment remain valid.
A simple, catchy phrase can help you remember how to manage potential nuisance vari-
ables that aren’t included in your experiment: Block what you can and randomize against
what you can’t block.
The following descriptions show you how to apply this catch phrase:
 Blocking: When you know the source of a potential nuisance variable, you can pur-
posely remove its influence completely or include its effect evenly through all of your
experimental runs. By blocking, you guarantee that you won’t have an unfair bias on
only a portion of your experimental settings.
 Randomizing: To inoculate your experiment against the detrimental effects of
unknown nuisance variables, you need to randomize all the variables that aren’t
directly part of your experiment. You randomize such things as the order of the exper-
imental runs, the materials being used, the operators performing the work, the time of
day the experiment runs are made, and so on. Randomizing spreads out the otherwise
concentrated or confounding potential for unknown nuisance effects evenly and fairly
over all of the experimental runs and preserves the accuracy of your results.

Q.
An improvement leader is planning an
experiment to explore the effect of tem-
perature and pressure on the quality of
molded parts. The leader has determined
several variables he knows will have an
effect on his results unless he does some-
thing about them. These variables include
the difference between the mold presses
typically used for the process (three dif-
ferent presses are typically used) and the
time allowed for the machine to warm up
to operating conditions. He also suspects
that other variables will influence his
experiment, but he isn’t sure what those
variables might be. Give some sugges-
tions for what the improvement leader
might do to manage the effects of these
extraneous variables.
A.
For the known nuisance variables of mold
press and warm-up time, the improve-
ment leader should do something to
block their effects. The best way to block
the extra variation from the three differ-
ent mold presses is to conduct the experi-
ment on just one of the presses. By using
only one press, the typical variation that’s
observed from press to press will be elim-
inated from the experiment.
To block the effect of the warm-up time,
the experimental runs could be conducted
rapidly, at approximately the same point in
the warm-up cycle. Or, if each run requires
a lot of time, a different way to block the
warm-up time variable would be to con-
duct one run each day, at precisely the
same time in the warm-up cycle.
The most basic thing to do about the lurk-
ing, unknown nuisance variables is to ran-
domize the order of the experiment runs
so that all of the runs will have an equal
likelihood of experiencing the unknown
influences.

Calculating Main Effects
Main effects are the quantitative influences each single experiment factor (X) has indi-
vidually on the output response (Y). Each factor in your experiment has a main effect.
To explore and quantify the main effect of each factor in your experiment, follow these
steps:
1. Create a main effects plot for each factor.
You create this plot by plotting the line between the point representing the aver-
age of the responses with the factor at its high level and the point representing
the average of the responses with the factor at its low level.
The steeper the line, the stronger the effect.

The main effect for the X1 temperature factor can be seen graphically by plotting the line between
the point representing the average of the responses with the factor at its “high” level and the
point representing the average of the responses with the factor at its “low” level. The responses
for this factor at its “high” level are those runs where the coded value for temperature c1 is at +1.
These runs include 2, 4, 6, and 8. The average response at the “high” level for this factor is calcu-

temperature of the caustic cleaning solution is increased, the percent reduction in pressure also
increases.
The main effect plot for the X2 time factor is found in a similar way by plotting the line between
the point of the average response from the runs with X2 at its “high” level and the point of the
average response from the runs with X2 at its “low” level. Referring to the coded design matrix 
created at the beginning of this example, the runs with X2 at its “high” level are those where c2 is
equal to +1. These runs include 3, 4, 7, and 8. The calculation for the average response at the
“high” level is:

Plotting these two points and drawing a straight line between them gives you a graph of the X2
main effect. The graph ends up looking something like the next figure.
Like with X1, the main effect plot for the X2 time factor shows a positive slope, which means that
as the exposure time of the caustic cleaning solution is increased, the percent reduction in pres-
sure also increases.
To create the main effect plot for the X3 concentration factor, you go through the same process.
The point with X3 at its “high” level is the average of the runs where c3 is set at +1. These runs
include 5, 6, 7, and 8. So, the calculation for the average response from these runs is:

Like with the other two main effects, the main effect for the X3 concentration factor is also posi-
tive, which means that the higher the concentration of the caustic solution, the greater the pres-
sure reduction.
A very important step in reviewing the main effects plots is to place them side by side, all on the
same vertical scale, which allows you to compare the relative slopes of the lines visually. Check
out the next figure to see what your plots for this example should look like.
After examining the figure, you can immediately see that X1 has a much stronger main effect than
either X2 or X3. In fact, even though you can calculate a number for the X3 main effect, by compari-
son to the others it really is nearly flat!
A quantitative value Ei can be calculated for each main effect. This value is simply the difference
between the high-setting average and the low-setting average for the factor you’re calculating. But,
the standard formula using the coded design matrix values produces this exact value in every
case. You just plug the c values in from the coded design matrix and plug them into the formula.
For the X1 temperature factor, the quantitative main effect E1 is calculated like this:

Calculating Interaction Effects
Sometimes a variable has an effect on an outcome when it combines and interacts
with another variable. For example, think of baking a cake: A delicious-tasting out-
come (the Y) is a function of several input Xs, such as “amount of flour,” “number of
eggs,” “oven temperature,” “baking time,” and so on. Obviously, the right value for the
variable of “baking time” depends on the setting for “oven temperature.” How hot the
oven is and how long you leave the cake in the oven are two input variables that inter-
act with each other.
A properly designed and conducted 2k factorial experiment allows you to identify and
quantify all interaction effects among your experimental factors. You’ll have a potential
interaction effect for each possible factor combination.
To explore and quantify the interaction effect of each factor combination in your
experiment, follow these steps:
1. Create a two-way interaction effect plot for each two-factor combination by
creating a plot with the following two lines:
• The first line is drawn between the point created by the average response
of the runs where the first-listed factor is at its “high” level and the second-
listed factor is also at its “high” level and the point created by the average
response of the runs where the first-listed factor is still at its “high” level
and the second-listed factor is at its “low” level.
• The second line is drawn between the point created by the average response
of the runs where the first-listed factor is at its “low” level and the second-
listed factor is at its “high” level and the point created by the average
response of the runs where the first-listed factor is at its “low” level and the
second-listed factor is also at its “low” level.

220
Part V: Improving and Controlling 
The greater the difference in the slope of the two lines, the stronger the interac-
tion effect between the two factors.
2. Quantify the interaction effect for any factor combination Eab...z using the fol-
lowing formula:

Q.
Using the information from the food plant caustic filter cleaning example described earlier in the
chapter, plot the two-way interaction effects and quantify and compare all of the interaction
effects for each factor.
A.
In this 23 factorial experiment, you have the following three two-way interaction effects:
• E12 is the interaction effect between X1: Temperature and X2: Time
• E13 is the interaction effect between X1: Temperature and X3: Concentration
• E23 is the interaction effect between X2: Time and X3: Concentration
The interaction effect between X1: Temperature and X2: Time can be seen graphically by creating a
plot with the following two lines:
• The first line on the plot is drawn between the point created by the average response of the
runs where the X1 temperature factor is at its “high” level and the X2 time factor is also at its
“high” level and the point created by the average response of the runs where the X1 tempera-
ture factor is still at its “high” level and the X2 time factor is at its “low” level.
• The second line is drawn between the point created by the average response of the runs where
the X1 temperature factor is at its “low” level and the X2 time factor is at its “high” level and the
point created by the average response of the runs where the X1 temperature factor is at its
“low” level and the X2 time factor is also at its “low” level.
Start by calculating the first point for the first line. Looking back at the coded design matrix, the
runs where c1 is at its coded “high” level of +1 and c2 is also at its coded “high” level of +1 are 4
and 8. So, the average response of these runs is:

The second point for the first line is the average of the runs where the c1 is still at its “high” level
of +1 and c2 is at its “low” level of –1. After referring to the coded design matrix, you’ll see that
runs 2 and 6 are at these levels. The average response of these runs is:

Now calculate the first point for the second line. The runs where c1 is at its coded “low” level of –1
and c2 is at its coded “high” level of +1 are 3 and 7. The average response of these runs is:

Now plot the two lines formed by these two pairs of calculated points, as shown in the next figure.
You have successfully created the two-way interaction effect plot for X1: Temperature and X2: Time.
You can see that the slopes of these two lines are graphically identical — the lines are nearly 
parallel — which means that no interaction exists between the X1 temperature and X2 time factors.
Follow the same process to create two-way interaction plots for the X1: Temperature – X3:
Concentration and the X2: Time – X3: Concentration interactions. Lay out all of the two-way inter-
action plots for review and inspection by plotting them on the same vertical scale and placing
them in a matrix pattern, like in the following figure.
When looking at all of the two-way interactions, you see that only the plot for the X1: Temperature
– X3: Concentration and the X2: Time – X3: Concentration interaction shows lines with significantly
different slopes. This indicates an interaction between these two variables.

Part V: Improving and Controlling 
Determining Which Effects Are Significant
Unfortunately, just because you can calculate the main effects and the interaction
effects for an experiment doesn’t mean that all of the values are statistically signifi-
cant. The Pareto Principle (see Chapter 6) indicates that only a relatively small minor-
ity of all the possible effects will explain the majority of the changes in the response.
After calculating all the possible main and interaction effects, you have to test them to
see which few you should keep and which you should discard.
To find out which calculated effects are significant, you plot the calculated effects
against their normal Z scores. If the effects are insignificant, the plotted points will fall
into the shape of a line. Any effect in which a corresponding point falls far off the line,
however, is significant.
You create the plotted points by following these steps:
1. Rank order the calculated estimates from lowest to highest.
2. Calculate the probability for each of the ranked estimates using this formula:
.
P
i

0 5

k
=
-
-
3. Look up the normal, or Zi, score corresponding to each calculated Pi.
You can look up the Zi score in the Standard Normal Distribution Table at
www.dummies.com/go/sixsigmaworkbook.
4. Plot each calculated effect versus its Zi.
5. Identify the significant effects from those that are far off the line created by
the plotted points.
Q.
Using the food plant caustic filter cleaning example from earlier in the chapter, determine which
calculated effects are significant by creating a normal probability plot of the effects.
A.
The first step is to list all of the calculated effects in rank order and assign them their rank order
(i), like this:
Effect

The next step is to calculate the probability for each ranked effect using this formula:
.

As an example, P1, for the lowest rank ordered effect, is calculated like this:

You repeat this calculation for the Pi for each ranked effect. The Pi column on the table of values
can now be updated:

0.9286
You can find similar Standard Normal Distribution tables online or in virtually every statistics and
Six Sigma book. Maybe that’s why they’re called “standard” — because they’re a standard way for
authors to fill up the pages of their statistics books! The final value to find for the ranked effect is
its normal score, or the Z value, which you can find in any Standard Normal Distribution table. You
can find one at this book’s bonus material Web page: www.dummies.com/go/sixsigmaworkbook.
For E13, the calculated Pi is 0.0714. This value is a probability value in the half of the Standard
Normal Distribution Table that’s not listed. You have to first figure its symmetrical probability.
Here are the calculations:
1 – 0.0714 – 0.9286
After looking up the probability of 0.9286 in a Standard Normal Distribution Table, you find that
the Z value corresponding to this probability is 1.46 and 1.47. So, a value of 1.465 is probably
close. But, don’t forget that because you’ve used symmetry to look up this Z value, you have to
use a negative Z value (–1.465).
By repeating this same look-up process, you can find Z values for each of the rank ordered effects.
Your table of values should now look like this:
Effect
Calculated Value
Rank(i)
Pi
Zi
E13
–6.1

0.0714
–1.465
E12

E1

7
0.9286
1.657
With these values all calculated, you’re ready to draw a normal probability plot to test the signifi-
cance of the effects. You simply plot the points created by each effect and its corresponding Z
value, like in the next figure.

The points created by effects E1, E2, and E13 are far off the line that was created by the rest of the
effects. These off-line points signal that these effects aren’t just random chance, but are signifi-
cant. You now have evidence that allows you to dismiss the other calculated effects.

Chapter 14: Planning and Conducting 2k Factorial Experiments
The Ultimate Power Trip: Forming 
Y = f(X) Equations
2k factorial experiments not only reveal which factors affect the output Y, but they also allow
you to understand the form of the Y = f(X) equation for the system or process you’re improv-
ing. At the start, a 2k experiment investigates the possibility of all main and interaction
effects being significant. Later, you whittle this list down to just the significant effects. What
you do next is create a Y = f(X) equation for your system, which allows you to predict future
outputs from known inputs.
The equation has a constant term (β0) and also potential terms for each main and interaction
effect (Xs). These terms each have a corresponding coefficient, labeled β.
For a three-factor system, the general form of the equation with all its potential terms looks
like this:
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 +β3X3 + β12X1X2 + β13X1X3 + β23X2X3 + β123X1X2X3
For a two-factor system, the general form of the equation with all its potential terms looks
like this:
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β12X1X2
To create the specific equation for your process or system, you start with its general form
and then remove all but the constant term β0 and the terms corresponding to the effects that
were found to be significant. You calculate the β coefficients from these equations:
β0 = y

Q.
Create the specific Y = f(X) equation for the food plant caustic filter cleaning example in this
chapter.
A.
The experiment for this example is a 23 factorial. So, the general form of the Y = f(X) equation,
with all its potential terms will look like this:
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 +β3X3 + β12X1X2 + β13X1X3 + β23X2X3 + β123X1X2X3
However, only the E1, E2, and E13 effects were found to be significant, which means that you can
reduce the form of the equation so that it looks like this:
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 +β13X1X3
To find the specific values for the βs in the reduced equation, simply use the formulas:

Solutions to 2k Factorial Experiment
Problems
a
How many unique runs will a 2k factorial experiment that investigates four factors have?
For 2k factorial experiments, k represents the number of factors. The number of runs is equal to
2k, or in this case, 24 = 16 runs.
b
Create a coded design matrix for a 22 factorial experiment.
For a 22 factorial experiment, you’ll have two levels for each of the two factors — a “high” level
and a “low” level — and you’ll have 22 = 4 runs. Each run represents a unique combination of
the levels of the two factors. Using the alternating pattern of +1’s to represent the “high” factor
levels and –1’s to represent the “low” factor levels shown in this pattern, you create a list of the
four unique experiment runs. This is what your coded design matrix for the experiment should
look like:

A project leader wants to set up an experiment to explore two production variables: production
line and shift. The company has two duplicate production lines — Line A and Line B. And it has
two shifts — day shift and afternoon shift. Create a coded design matrix for this 22 factorial
experiment.
With two factors and two levels for each factor, you’ll have 22 = 4 experiment runs. For the X1:
production line factor you have two levels: Line A represented by –1 and Line B represented by
+1. For the X2: shift factor you have two levels: day shift represented by –1 and afternoon shift
represented by +1. The coded design matrix should look like this:

Using the food plant caustic filter cleaning example from the “Don’t Be a Frankenstein: Planning
Experiments” section earlier in this chapter, determine some of the non-experiment factors that
you think may exert unwanted influence on the experiment.
The factors included in the experiment are temperature, time, and concentration. Other influ-
encing factors include:
 Flow rate of the caustic solution through the filter
 Pressure differential measurement system being used
 Length of time since the last caustic cleaning of the filters
 Shelf life of caustic chemicals
230
Part V: Improving and Controlling 

Your list may include some of the many other variables that influence the system. Remember
to consult your list of Xs that have previously been identified as correlated when constructing
your experimental definition.
f
For each of the non-experiment factors you identify in Problem 5, explain how you might
manage its effect on the experiment.
Below, for each of the identified influencing factors, are suggestions on how you might manage
their effect on the experiment. 
 Flow rate of the caustic solution through the filter: Block the effect of this variable by 
setting and controlling the flow rate to a single value for all experiment runs.
 Pressure differential measurement system being used: Randomize the order of the
experiment runs to spread out possible variation from the pressure differential measure-
ment system.
 Length of time since the last caustic cleaning of the filters: Block the effect of this vari-
able by conducting each experiment run after a set length of time since the last cleaning.
 Shelf life of caustic chemicals: Randomize which experiment runs get which caustic
chemical dates.
g
What should you always do to mitigate the effect of unknown variable influences?
Always randomize the order of the runs of every experiment you perform.
Randomizing each experiment may seem trivial and may seem like a lot of extra work, but in
the end it helps your experiment stay free of bias from outside influences. It always pays to 
randomize.
h
An investigator of car quality decides to test four newly manufactured cars. What are some of
the blocking and randomizing strategies the investigator could use to make sure his selection
of newly manufactured cars is valid?
Imagine if one of the four selected cars was manufactured on a Monday, but all the others were
manufactured on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. The possible lower quality associated with
a Monday-built car (due to the weekend layoff) would have an effect on the new car quality
investigations. To correct this, you could block for this factor by selecting study cars all coming
from the same day of production.

An engineer has set up a 22 factorial experiment to study the effects of supplier and heat treat-
ment temperature on the yield strength of a material. See the original question earlier in this
chapter for his results. Plot and calculate the main effect for the X1 supplier factor.
The plot for the main effect for X1 is found by drawing a line between the average of the runs
with X1 at its “high” (+1) value and the average of the runs with X1 at its “low” (–1) value.
Looking back at the coded design matrix for this example, the average for the “high” runs is:

Using the information from Problems 9 and 10, create a side-by-side main effects plot for X1 and X2
and compare the relative strengths of the two.
If you put both main effects on the same vertical scale, you get a plot that looks like the one in
the next figure.
The plot of both main effects shows X2 having a steep slope, whereas the slope for X1 is virtu-
ally flat, which tells you that X2 has a much stronger main effect than X1.

List all of the possible interaction effects for a 24 factorial experiment.
To find all of the interactions, you have to carefully go through all of the possibilities. Start with
the first factor and then list all the other factors the first factor could combine with to form a
two-way effect. In this 4-factor case, the first factor interactions are:
 E12
 E13
 E14
Then move on to the second factor. List all of the other factors that the second factor could
combine with to form a two-way effect. Skip the two-way effects that you’ve already listed.
Here are the factors:

You use a similar process to go through and list all of the three-way effects. Here are the three-
way effects:
 E123
 E124
 E134
 E234
Finally, you list the only possible four-way interaction:
 E1234
m
Create a two-way interaction plot for the 22 factorial experiment from Problem 9. After you
create the plot, calculate the E12 value for this interaction effect.
The two-way interaction plot for E12 has two lines:
 The first line is drawn between the point created by the average response of the runs
where the first-listed factor is at its high level and the second-listed factor is also at its
high level and the point created by the average response of the runs where the first-listed
factor is still at its high level and the second-listed factor is at its low level.
 The second line is drawn between the point created by the average response of the runs
where the first-listed factor is at its low level and the second-listed factor is at its high level
and the point created by the average response of the runs where the first-listed factor is at
its low level and the second-listed factor is also at its low level.
Start by creating the first point for the first line. Going to the coded design matrix for Problem 9,
you have to locate the runs where the X1 factor is at its “high” level (+1) and the X2 factor is also
at its “high” level (+1). In a 22 factorial experiment with only one run (Number 4) where the two
factors are at these levels, the average is simply the single outcome result for that run: 31,240.
No averages have to be calculated! The second point on the first line is where the X1 factor is 
at its “high” level (+1) and the X2 factor is at its “low” level (–1). The single outcome of run 2 is
28,740.
The first point on the second line is where the X1 factor is at its “low” level (–1) and the X2
factor is at its “high” level (+1). This point corresponds to run 3, with a value of 32,150. The
second point on the second line is where the X1 factor is at its “low” level (–1) and the X2 factor
is also at its “low” level (–1). These levels appear on run 1, giving an output value of 27,800.
You draw the two-way plot by drawing the lines for these points, as shown in the following
figure.
The slopes of these lines are different, which means you have an interaction effect.

Of the two-way plots shown in the original question earlier in the chapter, which ones display
evidence of an interaction effect?
Two-way interaction plots that show lines with different slopes indicate a strong interaction
effect. For this set of two-way plots, only the X1-X2 interaction has lines with different slopes.
The X1-X2 interaction is the only interaction effect among these variables.
o
In the normal probability plot for the effects shown in the original question earlier in the chap-
ter, circle which effects appear significant.
When plotted as a normal probability plot, the effects that are far off the line created by the
rest of the points are the ones that are significant. The four points on the left side of the plot
create a line. The three effects plotted off the line are the ones that are significant (see the
next figure).
p
Plot the normal probabilities for the 22 factorial experiment in Problem 9. Indicate which effects

Write out the general form of the Y = f(X) equation, with all of its potential terms, for a 24 facto-

The general form of the equation for a 24 factorial experiment will have an overall offset term β0,
terms for each of the main effects β1, β2, β3, and β4, and it will have all the interaction effects
listed in Problem 11. Your equation should look like this:
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3 + β4X4 + β12X1X2 + β13X1X3 +β14X1X4 +β23X2X3 + β24X2X4 +β34X3X4 +

For the experiment in Problem 9, write out the general form of the equation, including all of its

Problem 9 is a 22 factorial experiment, which means that it will have an overall offset term β0,

what your equation should look like:
Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β12X1X2

For the experiment in Problem 9, write out the specific form of the equation using only the sig-

The only significant effect in Problem 9 is the main effect for the X2 heat treatment temperature
factor. Because you only have one significant effect, the general equation reduces down to this:
Y = β0 + β2X2
The value of the β0 coefficient is just the average of all the experimental runs, which is calcu-

fter you’ve finished defining, measuring, analyzing, and improving your process or
product, you still have to do more: You have to figure out how to maintain your efforts.
Think of the scientific term entropy — the inevitable and steady deterioration of a system
toward a state of inert uniformity. Or, think of how long it takes to clean up your home for
company when you have young children — and then how quickly the kids can trash the
place if you don’t implement some controls, or in this case, rules. Many process improve-
ments in the past have suffered a similar fate. Hard-earned gains and improvements are
quickly lost when things revert to “business as usual.” All of the improvements in the world
will quickly evaporate without a plan to hold the achieved gains in place. This last step in
the Six Sigma process is the control phase.
Make sure you reserve enough time and energy to make it all the way through the control
phase.
Doing the Poka-Yoke: Mistake-Proofing
Products or Processes
Poka-Yoke is the transliteration of a Japanese phrase meaning “to make mistakes impossible.”
Poka-Yoke’s purpose is to arrange and structure work so that mistakes can’t be made or,
when they are made, to make them immediately obvious so they can be contained and fixed.
Common Poka-Yoke implementations include:
 Physical features or geometry, such as guide pins or stops, that make incorrect assem-
bly or work impossible
 Automated processing, assembly, or inspection systems
 Limiting controls that don’t allow the process to be operated at unacceptable levels

The largest source of defects in an order ful-
fillment process is typos in the part of the

up and customers complain. Think of sev-
eral good Poka-Yokes that will prevent typos
from ever happening or that will raise an
alert when a typo needs to be fixed.

The following are some changes that aren’t considered good Poka-Yoke implementations:
 Retraining of personnel or operators
 Threats of disciplinary actions on workers or operators who make mistakes
 Written work procedures or instructions
 Relying on increased attentiveness of workers
Q.

A.
Today’s cars incorporate Poka-Yoke after
Poka-Yoke to keep drivers from making
initial mistakes and in identifying danger-
ous situations. Here’s a list of just a few:
• Automatic transmission can’t be
taken out of park unless the driver
has the brake pedal applied
• Passenger airbag is automatically
turned off when the passenger seat
isn’t occupied by a person who
exceeds a safe weight limit
• Seat belt reminder alarms go off until
seat belts are buckled
• Headlights automatically switch off
after the vehicle is parked and
turned off

Forming Control Plans to Maintain
Your Improvements
After your improvements are in place, you need to have an organized plan for control-
ling and maintaining your performance. Many acceptable ways exist to manage the
control phase, but before you choose one, make sure that every plan you’re consider-
ing measures and tracks the following:
 The output Ys that were found to be critical from your previous Define-Measure-
Analyze-Improve work. Knowing that the critical outputs are performing to
required levels and variation limits assures you that the important input Xs that
determine process outputs are being controlled to their individual requirements.
A process management summary is used to list and track critical output Ys.
 The critical input Xs that were determined from your previous Define-
Measure-Analyze-Improve work. The action lies in the critical X realm: When
output Ys get off track, the input Xs must be addressed. And, by monitoring the
input Xs, you can change people, equipment, materials, and production rates
without losing the quality performance of the process. A process input control
plan is used to list and track the critical input Xs.
Use the process management summary and the process input control plan templates
provided in Figures 15-1 and 15-2 to set up and maintain a control plan for your process.

Selecting the Right Control 
Chart for Your Situation
Your process control plan requires you to track and monitor your critical inputs and
outputs. A primary tool you can use for tracking is a statistical process control chart
(which is also known as a control chart).
Control charts use statistics to monitor and control the variation in processes, and
they display the results in easy-to-use graphical formats. Each chart is designed for a
different type of data or situation. Using the wrong chart can be very costly!
Use the decision tree in Figure 15-3 to determine which type of control chart to use for
your specific situation.

Part V: Improving and Controlling 

As you go through the decision process outlined in the tree, ask yourself what type of
data you’re working with: attribute data or continuous data (see Chapter 7). Use the fol-
lowing guidelines to figure out which chart to use with each type of data:
 If you have attribute data, decide whether your data is for defectives or for
defects:
• Defectives refers to products or processes that are unacceptable due to one or
more errors (defects) that make the entire product or process bad. An exam-
ple of a system that tracks defectives is a loan approval process. The outcome
is either “approve” or “deny.” However, denials have one or more various dis-
qualifying reasons (defects) — poor credit score, loan-to-value ratio, employ-
ment verification, and so on. Whatever the reason, when you track defectives
you don’t track the reasons, you just track whether the product or process
ends up in one of two categories — “good” or “bad.” If you have this type of
data, you need to use a p chart.
• Defects refers to tracking the actual number of problems occurring on an
item. An example of tracking defects is counting the number of scratches
on a door panel at final inspection. The result may be 0, 5, 17, or 3. You
keep track of the number and then you create a percentage or a ratio of the
number of defects that occur on the item out of a total number of opportu-
nities, such as 0 out of 20, 5 out of 20, 17 out of 20, or 3 out of 20. (The
number of opportunities doesn’t need to be identical in every tracked
measurement. You may have 0 out of 10, 5 out of 23, 17 out of 19, or 3 out
of 15. This still fits into the defects category.) Defect measurements are
tracked with u charts.
 If you have continuous data, you have to ask yourself what size your measure-
ment sample, or subgroup, is. Follow these guidelines:
• If your measurement samples consist of a single point, you need to use an
individuals and moving range (I-MR) control chart.
• If your measurement samples contain between two and ten data points
each, you need to use an averages and ranges ( X -R) control chart.
• If your measurement samples have more than ten data points each, you
need to use an averages and standard deviations ( X -S) control chart.
We discuss how to create each of the preceding charts later in the chapter.

Q.
A Six Sigma leader has completed a project
that has identified two critical factors to
the success of a process — the tempera-
ture of the preheat treatment (measured
each minute with a single degrees Celsius
reading) and the proportion of items in
each preheat treatment batch that are cor-
rectly oriented according to the operating
procedures. What type of control chart
should be used for the temperature factor?
What about for the orientation factor?
A.
For the temperature factor, go through the
decision tree: Is the type of data attribute or
continuous? Temperature measurements in
degrees Celsius are considered continuous
data. Now ask yourself the follow-up ques-
tion: What subgroup size is each of the tem-
perature measurements? In this case, the
answer is one, which tells you that you
need to use an I-MR control chart.
For the orientation factor, you go through
the same decision tree, asking yourself
this question: Is the type of data attribute
or continuous? In this case, whether or
not an item is correctly oriented is defi-
nitely attribute data. The second question
you have to ask is: Is this attribute data
defective or defect data? Orientation is
assessed in this example by counting the
number of items in a batch that are incor-
rectly oriented, which means you’re
counting the number of defects. When
you count the number of defects, you
know you have defects data. According
to the decision tree, you need to use a u
control chart.

Interpreting Your Control Charts
Selecting and creating the right control chart is only a start. After creating the chart, the real
point is to correctly interpret it. What you’re looking for is the evidence of special causes,
which are the out-of-the-ordinary events that throw performance off its normal level.
To interpret a control chart, the plotted sequence of points on the chart is compared to the
calculated control limits (more on calculating control limits later in this chapter). When the
position or sequence of the points, in relation to each other or to the control limits, follows a
non-normal pattern, you know that a special cause has occurred.
Table 15-1 provides a summary of the non-normal patterns to look for in control charts.

Part V: Improving and Controlling 

The distance above and the distance below the central limit, the third closest to the
central line, is called Zone C. The middle third is called Zone B and the third farthest
from the central line is called Zone A. Here are eight specific rules, based on the three
zones, that indicate special causes:
1. Any point beyond either control limit
2. Nine points in a row on the same side of the center line
3. Six points in a row, all increasing or all decreasing
4. Fourteen points in a row alternating up and down
5. Two out of any three consecutive points in Zone A and all three on the same side
of the central average
6. Four out of any five consecutive points in Zone B or A, and all five on the same
side of the central average
7. Fifteen points in a row in Zone C, on either side of the central average line
8. Eight points in a row without a point in Zone C, on either side of the center line. 
Checking all of these rules manually for each point on the control chart is tedious
work. We will do it here in theses examples to illustrate the concepts, but in practice,
usually your computer software will compute the control limits for you from the
sample data and check for these rules automatically.

Q.
For the control chart shown in the following figure, identify any evidence of special causes. State
which rule from the eight-point list applies.
A.
The obvious evidence of the presence of a special cause is the two points at observation num-
bers 14 and 15 that are beyond the upper control limit, which is based on the first rule in the list
of eight. Going through all of the other seven rules is a bit tedious, but you’ll find one other rule
providing evidence of a special cause — number 5. Observations 14, 15, and 16 are all in Zone A
or beyond, which fits the bill for rule number 5. Clearly something out of the ordinary happened
in the process at this time.

Constructing an Individuals and 
Moving Range (I-MR) Chart
The individuals and moving range chart is probably the most widely used control chart
because it requires only a sequence of individual numerical measurements. A daily recording
of minimum temperature, a sequential accounting of sales figures, or an ordered history of
length measurements — all of these measurements can be readily charted using an I-MR chart.
As with all of the control charts for continuous data types, an I-MR chart is a dual chart,
which means you create a chart for the individuals and another chart with the same horizon-
tal time axis for the moving range of the data. Having a second chart to track the range
between the sequential points allows you even greater resolution at detecting special causes:
If any of the test rules is broken for either the individuals or for the moving range chart, you
have evidence of a special cause.
In a pinch, you can quickly create just the individuals part of the I-MR chart. However, you
should create both parts whenever you can.
You create the moving range part (MR) of the I-MR chart by plotting the moving range (MRi)
between each of the sequential observations in your data. With the plotted moving ranges
you draw a calculated central average line (MR). You also calculate and draw an upper con-
trol limit (UCLMR) and a lower control limit (LCLMR) around the moving range data. You calcu-
late these values from the following formulas:

You create the individuals part (I) of the I-MR chart by plotting the individual sequential
measurements (xi). You include a calculated center average line designated as X . You also
calculate and draw an upper control limit (UCLx) and a lower control limit (LCLx).

With these values calculated, you can draw your I-MR chart. Plot the points and add the center
and control limit lines for each part of the dual chart (next figure).
When reviewing the chart for evidence of special causes, you’ll find that only the 22nd month, with
its individual value and the corresponding moving range (MR23), sends up a flag for violation of the
rules. So, you know that something out of the ordinary must have occurred in the 22nd month.

Raising the Bar for Small Samples: Averages
and Ranges (X-R) Charts
When you have continuous data with each sample consisting of a small sample size of
2 to 10 measurements, pick the X -R chart. Like the I-MR chart, the X -R chart is a dual
chart. In the top half, you plot the average, or X , for each sample. In the bottom half,
you plot the range (R) for each sample subgroup.
The central line and the control limits for the R half of the chart are calculated from
these formulas:

When you go through all the rules looking for special causes, no evidence can be found indicating
the presence of any special causes. The voltage produced by the bulb manufacturing process is
therefore stable.

and measures their height. (If the height of the caps varies too much, the cap feed machines have
to be adjusted.) Here’s a sequence of 30 three-item samples of cap height measurements:

Making a p Chart for Your Attribute Data
The “p” in p chart stands for “proportion defective.” When you’re tracking data that consists
of a count of how many items in your sample are defective, you use a p chart. You create a p
chart by plotting the sequence of values representing the proportion of each sample that’s
defective (pi). Here’s the equation you use: 
p
n
d
i
i
i
=
where di is the number of inspected items found to be defective. The number of items
inspected, which is designated as ni, doesn’t have to be the same for each sample. The hori-
zontal centerline (p) for the p chart is the total number of defectives found divided by the
total number of items inspected. Here’s the formula:
p
n
n
n
d
d
d
k

f
f

+
+
+
+
+
The control limits for the p chart are only constant if the size of all k samples is the same. If
the size isn’t the same from sample to sample, the control limit envelope will expand and
contract as the size of the samples change. No matter what the sample size, the following for-
mulas allow you to calculate the control limits:

Proportions can never be less than 0 or greater than 1. If your calculated LCLi ends up being
less than 0, simply set it instead to 0. Or, if your calculated UCLi is greater than 1, just set it to
a value of 1.

With the pi, UCLi, and LCLi values all calculated for each sample, you’re ready to draw the p chart.
Plot the pi points. Use the calculated value of p as the center line. Then, for each sample, draw the
upper and lower control limits. Remember that these control limits will vary if the sizes of the sam-
ples vary, which they do in this case. The finished chart looks like the one in the following figure.

Creating a u Chart for Your Attribute Data
A u chart monitors defects per unit. A unit can be anything that provides a consistent oppor-
tunity for defects to occur — for example a physical assembly, a paper process, a transac-
tion, a patient in a hospital, a day’s worth of sales, or a warehouse. As long as the concept of
a unit is consistently defined and applied, a u chart works.
You create a u chart by plotting the sequence of values representing the defects per unit of
each sample, ui. Use the following equation:
u
n
D
i
i
i
=
where Di is the number of defects found in the inspection of the units in the sample. The
number of units inspected (ni) doesn’t have to be the same for each sample.
The horizontal center line (u) for the u chart is the total number of defects found in all of the
samples divided by the total number of units inspected. Here’s the formula:

The control limits for the u chart are constant only if the number of units in all k sam-
ples is the same. If the number of units isn’t the same, the control limit envelope will
expand and contract as the number of units in each sample changes. No matter what

The individual defects per unit (ui) points for the chart are calculated by dividing the number of
defects found (Di) by the number of units inspected (ni) for each sample. For example, the ui for
the first sample is calculated like this:

For each of the 30 samples, you have to calculate an upper and lower control limit. These values will
vary since the number of units in each sample will also vary. Remember that if the calculated lower
control limit is less than 0, you need to use the theoretical limit of “0” instead. As an example, the
upper control limit for the first sample is calculated as follows:
.

List four additional Poka-Yokes used in automobiles that aren’t listed in the previous example.
Here are some of the many other Poka-Yokes used in modern automobiles:
 Dashboard oil light comes on when oil is low, warning the driver of the potential for seri-
ous engine damage
 Fuel gauge warning light reminds driver to look at the low fuel tank level
 Sizing of the gas tank opening prevents the driver from putting in the wrong type of fuel
(diesel versus unleaded)
 Secondary release on hood prevents the driver from accidentally opening the hood while
driving
 Keys are two-sided and symmetrical so there is no wrong way to insert them into the ignition
 Minivan sliding door won’t open when the fuel door on the same side is already open —
preventing the door from “running over” the open fuel door
 Automatic windows go completely down with a single click or push of the control, but they
require constant actuation to roll the windows up, which prevents someone’s arm or head
from getting pinched in the window
 Ignition on a standard transmission vehicle won’t work until the clutch pedal is applied
Did you think of any others?
b
The largest source of defects in an order fulfillment process is typos in the part of the process
where the person taking the order from the customer writes down the customer’s name and
address. When these errors happen, order shipments get mixed up and customers complain.
Think of several good Poka-Yokes that will prevent typos from ever happening or that will raise
an alert when a typo needs to be fixed.
Here are several Poka-Yokes that help reduce typos:
 Automatically pulling the customer’s address information from a database of previous 
customers
 Automatically checking the entered addresses against a computer database of valid city
addresses
 Automatically pulling the customer’s address from their billing information
What others did you think of?
c
Using the order-taking process from Problem 2, list some Poka-Yokes you could implement that
don’t require computers or technology.
Pulling information from billing records or from customer databases requires computers and
information technology. Here are some more Poka-Yoke ideas that don’t require electricity:
 Using an order form with individual blocks for each letter of the address
 Adding a customer confirmation step in the order-taking process by having the customer
review the transcribed address details at the conclusion of the order call
 Having the customer enter in his or her own name and address rather than having the
order clerk transcribe it
Did you think of other non-technology ways to mistake-proof the process?
d
Why don’t disciplinary threats or relying on improved attentiveness from workers count as
good Poka-Yokes?
The whole point of Poka-Yokes is to take the burden of mistakes off the person and to provide
the person with a system that naturally prevents mistakes from ever happening. Requiring the
operator to increase his attentiveness does the opposite of what a good Poka-Yoke is supposed
265
Chapter 15: Constructing Control Plans and Charts

to do: It increases the role of the operator in preventing mistakes. Along the same lines, threat-
ening disciplinary action to reduce mistakes is completely counterproductive. 
Your job in Six Sigma is to reconfigure the system so that opportunities for making mistakes are
eliminated. Make it virtually impossible for an operator to make mistakes and no disciplinary
action will ever be required.

A critical process output for a hotel is the accuracy of room reservations. A recent Six Sigma
project set up a measurement system to record the number of reservations made each day that
contain one or more problems. What type of control chart should you use to track the perform-
ance of this process output?
A problem with a reservation is counted as a defect. And there can be more than one type of
problem for a reservation. Using the decision tree provided in Figure 15-3, you follow the attrib-
ute data path and then the defects branch. The result: You should use a u chart to track room
reservation performance.
f
The pressure of a plastic injection mold machine is measured by capturing a five-point sample
at the start of each hour’s production. Select the right control chart for this metric.
Pressure readings are continuous data, so follow that branch in the decision tree. Next decide
how big the sample size is. A sample size of n = 5, as is the case here, means that you should
select an X -R chart.
g
Shipments of washers for a pump assembly process come in deliveries of 10,000 items. When
each shipment is received, a sample of 100 washers is measured for thickness. What type of
control chart should you use to track the ongoing thickness of the washers?
Thickness measurements are continuous data. Following that branch in the decision tree, you
next ask, “How big is my sample?” A 100-washer sample is large, so you use an X -S control
chart in this situation.
h
At the end of a cellphone manufacturing process, each phone is put through a final functional
test. The unit either “passes” or “fails.” The number of total units produced and the number
passing the final test are recorded each hour. Select the right type of control chart for tracking
each hour’s production performance.
Pass-fail data is attribute data about defectives. The choice here is a p chart.

Identify any evidence of special causes in the control chart shown in the figure from the origi-

Going through the numbered rules for interpreting control charts, you can find problems with

observation number 37. These points are highlighted in the plot of the next figure.

Identify any evidence of special causes in the control chart shown in the figure from the origi-
nal question earlier in this chapter.
Going carefully through all the numbered rules for each of the points in the chart, you find that
observation 12 concludes a trend of six points in a row increasing, which is a sign of a special
cause. Also, at observation 24, the charted point is beyond the control limits. This is another
indicator of special cause variation. These indicators are highlighted in the version of the con-
trol chart in the next figure.

Construct an I-MR chart for the production line yield data shown in the original question earlier

With these values calculated, you can draw your I-MR chart. Plot the points and add the center
and control limit lines for each part of the dual chart (see the next figure).
When reviewing the chart for evidence of special causes, note that everything looks good: You
have no runs, trends, or points beyond the control limits.

An airport administrator found some historical data that gives the number of aircraft landings
per week at his airport. During the period of this found data, the administrator’s peers believe
that a drop in aircraft traffic occurred. Create an I-MR chart of the data (flip to the original ques-
tion shown earlier in the chapter to see the data) and determine whether there is indeed any
evidence of a significant drop in traffic.
A calculation table helps solve this problem. In a new column, calculate the moving range
between each of the sequential data points. Here’s what your table should look like:

nitely occurred during this period. Observations 1 through 12 are all above the center line. That
fits rule number two: Nine or more points in a row are along one side of the center line. The same
rule is detected again starting with observation 16. But this time, the run of points are all beneath
the center line. It looks like airport traffic was at a higher level — a spike in traffic occurred coin-
cident with observation 15 and then a new, lower level of traffic emerged afterward.

As an in-process check, a fruit juice bottler takes a three-item sample of caps every ten minutes
and measures their height. (If the height of the caps varies too much, the cap feed machines
have to be adjusted.) The original question shown earlier in this chapter contains a sequence
of 30 three-item samples of cap height measurements.
Create an X -R control chart for the cap height data and investigate whether any special causes
are present.
For each hourly sample of n = 3 points, calculate the sample average X and the range R. Your
table will look like this:

the Ri points and then add the center and control limit lines for each part of the dual chart
(see the next figure).

Part V: Improving and Controlling 

You have evidence of a special cause: Samples 10 through 16 are all decreasing, which flags rule
number three. Something out of the ordinary happened with the cap height.

Part deliveries from a supplier are sampled upon arrival. Four parts from each shipment are
inspected. The sample data for the last 20 shipments is shown in the original question earlier in
this chapter.
Create an X -R control chart for the part inspection data and investigate whether any special
causes are present.
Start by calculating the X and the R values for each n = 4 sample of data. Your table will look

You’re now ready to plot the X and the R values along with the calculated center lines and con-

At sample number six, a special cause has occurred, leading the sample average to be outside
the calculated control limits.

The final inspection of a washer manufacturing plant consists of a go/no-go gauge measurement
of 100 parts. The original question shown earlier in this chapter contains a list of past final
inspection performance values.
Create a p chart and indicate whether any evidence of special causes is present.
Start by calculating the overall proportion defectives p. You calculate this value by dividing the
total number of defectives by the total number of parts or items inspected. For this problem,
the calculation is as follows:

Because no proportion can be less than 0, you need to set the lower control limit at 0 instead of
the impossible negative number that was calculated.
LCLi = 0
Now all you have to do is draw the chart. Graph the calculated pi points and draw in the hori-
zontal center line at p and the upper and lower control limits (see the next figure).

Are there any special causes evident in this graph? At the 17th sample, the proportion defective
exceeds the upper control limit, which means that something non-normal has caused this
increase.
p
A pass-fail attribute measurement system is used to track the number of defective parts found
in outgoing shipments. Flip to the original question shown earlier in this chapter to see the
sequential data that was collected from the system.
Create a p chart and look for evidence of special causes.
Begin by calculating the overall proportion defectives, which is equal to the total number of
defective items found divided by the total number of items inspected:

Remember that a proportion can’t be greater than 1 or less than 0. So, if your calculated control
limit values exceed these, just set the value back to 1 or 0, respectively. The following table

The last step is to draw out the p chart with the points for the pi values and the varying limits
for the upper and lower control limits (see the following figure).

By looking at the chart, you can see that everything is normal, with no evidence of any special
causes.

As an audit of outgoing quality, an egg company checks 10 cartons of its packaged eggs each
day. The company checks each carton’s eggs for correct size, for cracks or damage, and for
cleanliness. A carton is considered a unit. The original question earlier in this chapter shows
the results for the last 20 days’ inspections.
Create a u chart to determine whether any special causes are present in the output of the egg
packaging process.
The first step is to calculate the overall defects per unit. In this problem, a unit is a 1-dozen
carton of eggs. The overall defects per unit is the total number of defects observed divided by
the total number of units inspected, as calculated here:

Now you need to calculate the upper and lower control limits for each of the samples. Because
the number of units inspected is identical for each sample, the control limits will be constant.

However, because the lower control limit is less than 0, you have to set its value back to the
theoretical limit of 0.
Now you’re ready to draw the u chart. Plot the calculated ui points for each sample. Draw the
horizontal center line at u. Then draw in the constant control limits. The chart should look like
the one in the next figure.
When looking at the chart, you can see that everything looks normal. You have no evidence of
special causes.

A hospital’s trying to improve the accuracy of its insurance claim process. To get a base line of
where it’s currently at, its continuous improvement leader reviews each day’s claim forms for
any type of error. He’s done this for the last 38 days and recorded the results. Flip to the origi-
nal question earlier in this chapter to see the results.
Use a u chart to investigate the current base line performance at the hospital. Check to see
whether any special causes are present.
Start this problem out by calculating the overall defects per unit u. You can calculate this value
by dividing the total number of defects found in all the samples divided by the total number of
units inspected. Mathematically, this value can be written like this:

Next you calculate the upper and lower control limits for each sample. These limits will vary
from sample to sample because the number of units inspected varies. Here are the formulas for
the control limits:

Be careful with the lower control limit. Theoretically, the number of defects, and hence the
defects per unit value, can never drop below 0. So, if a calculated lower control limit ends up
negative, just replace it with the theoretical limit of 0. You can expand the table again with a
column for the upper and another column for the lower control limits, like this:

With all these values calculated, now you just need to draw the u chart. Plot the calculated ui
points for each sample. Draw the horizontal center line at u. And then draw in the varying con-
trol limits. The chart should look something like the one in the following figure.
Notice the handful of suspicious points in the control chart. Samples 7, 8, and 29 have exceeded
the control limits. Also, observation 28 concludes a six-point trend of defect per unit calculations
that are all increasing. These artifacts are evidence that something out of the ordinary has
occurred within the insurance claim process at the hospital for these days.

Chapter 16
Ten Implementation Myths of Six Sigma
In This Chapter
 Dispelling the most common myths about implementing Six Sigma
 Avoiding mistakes and barriers to implementation
A
s many times as Six Sigma has been implemented around the world, countless war 
stories, opinions, and myths have emerged, augmented by numerous urban legends,
anecdotes, and hearsay. Misconceptions abound regarding what a Six Sigma implementation
is really about.
Like most myths, the myths about Six Sigma are all rooted in some truth. With thousands of
implementations and hundreds of thousands of projects completed, you know already from
the normal distribution that some have gone poorly and that the failures can be notorious.
Most failures are due to poor leadership, but others are due to bad management. Even worse
are those projects that simply suffer bad luck. However, out of these failures — and the agen-
das of the people who tell them — the stories take on mythic proportion.
This chapter addresses ten of the most common myths about a Six Sigma implementation.
You’re likely to come across many more, but these are the biggies that you need to watch
out for.
Six Sigma Is about Achieving “Six Sigma”
Based on everything you’ve ever read, Six Sigma is 3.4 DPMO, right? So, if you’re implement-
ing “Six Sigma,” it only goes to follow that you’re going to keep working at it until you achieve
that Six Sigma level of performance, right?
Wrong! Six Sigma is not about achieving a Six Sigma level of performance. In other words, a
Six Sigma implementation isn’t about achieving 3.4 DPMO in every key performance metric.
Instead, it’s about achieving the proper, optimized level of performance of your organization —
and it’s very likely not to be precisely 3.4 DPMO.
A Six Sigma initiative is about developing the capabilities to continuously improve the effi-
ciency and effectiveness of your organization so that the performance and value of your
work processes continuously increase. The precise sigma level at which any given process
should operate is a matter of the process characteristics and the customer’s needs. In most
cases, it’s below “six sigma.” In other words, it’s greater than 3.4 DPMO, and in some cases,
it’s even more than Six Sigma!

Six Sigma Will Make Us Start All Over 
Again with Something Different
You’ll often hear Six Sigma devotees using the common refrain “You’ll never do
things the same again.” Because of this viewpoint — and because of the natural fear
of change — the myth emerged that a Six Sigma implementation causes people to
abandon everything and start all over again. Of course, Six Sigma doesn’t do that. You
won’t find a more effective way to grind an organization to a halt than to tell everyone
to stop doing what he or she is doing!
In fact, Six Sigma isn’t about stopping what you’re doing; it’s about changing how
you’re doing it. The Six Sigma initiative helps you do what you’re doing now, but more
efficiently and effectively. Incremental change is self-perpetuating because project
improvements result in measurable gains in performance, which feed more improve-
ments, and so on.
Six Sigma Stifles Creativity
One of the biggest mistaken impressions about Six Sigma is that it stifles creativity and
only works for high-volume repetitive processes, such as manufacturing, where consis-
tency is most critical. This myth emerged because of the way Motorola first applied it —
in volume manufacturing. But Six Sigma, which attacks the root cause of any problem,
improves outcomes by improving processes. Any processes. Creative processes 
such as marketing and design are processes just as manufacturing and production
are processes. And so are transaction processes, such as billing or procurement. And
any such process — creative processes included — can be characterized, analyzed,
and improved.
Modeling Processes Is Too Complicated
and Doesn’t Go Anywhere
Didn’t it all somehow seem easier when you scribbled process models on the back of a
napkin or on a white board — all those little boxes with arrows depicting functions
and information flowing between them? Your informal scribblings certainly enabled
the discussion in the moment.
However, process modeling became more formalized when you started drawing the
functions and flows using computer tools, such as PowerPoint or Visio. The models
were shareable and the presentations looked downright spiffy. But, true process mod-
eling requires so much more rigor than just drawing pictures, and the effort level for
drawing pictures was always just too much work. So, for a long time, as important as it
was, process modeling seemed too complicated, and as a result, it was rarely used.
That’s all changed now. The new era of tools, such as iGrafx, enables true process
modeling and is a key enabler in a core activity in Six Sigma: the definition and analysis
of processes.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Six Sigma Is Another “Program of the Month”
You’ve heard it countless times: The initiative launched with great fanfare and then
quietly died after it failed to live up to initial expectations. Quality initiatives, market-
ing initiatives, new product initiatives, efficiency initiatives — and the managers who
announced them — all here today and gone tomorrow. Why should Six Sigma be any
different?
What makes a Six Sigma initiative so different is the prescriptive nature of the deploy-
ment. Unlike many initiatives in the past, which meant well, but had little deployment
fidelity, a Six Sigma initiative has a thorough script, where everyone’s roles and actions
in the deployment are defined and known. Not only does this help the initiative suc-
ceed on its own, but it also helps the senior managers understand what their role is
and how to fuel the initiative going forward. This rigorous deployment definition is
why Six Sigma initiatives in major corporations like GE and Honeywell not only began
strong, but also have continued — well past the honeymoon phase and well beyond
the tenure of the executives and managers who first announced them.
Six Sigma Is Just a Quick-hit, 
Cost-Reduction Initiative
Most companies today have committed leadership and are governed by principles and
values that better balance short-term opportunities with long-term vision. As a result,
most Six Sigma initiatives now create a culture of improvement that continues to pro-
duce gains and values for years. Companies like Motorola and Honeywell have Six
Sigma initiatives that have lasted well over a decade and continue as strong as ever.
Six Sigma Is Too Onerous and Prescriptive
Does this sound familiar: “We’re different and we have our own way of doing things —
and our unique style is what makes us special and competitive in our industry. We’re
flexible and individualistic. Bringing in the Six Sigma standardized approach to doing
things will wipe out our uniqueness. We’ll be just like everyone else and lose our edge.”
Some people consider the Six Sigma training onerous because of the rigorous nature of
the curricula and projects. And, yes, the deployment framework is clearly prescriptive,
in that it formally defines the roles and activities in the leadership and knowledge
transfer. But the Six Sigma formula is a toolbox and application knowledge set. It’s a
language and communication framework.
You Can’t Implement Six Sigma Yourself
The perpetuated myth has been that Six Sigma is too heady, too difficult, too trouble-
some, and too dangerous to implement by yourself. The people who want you to believe
that myth want you to think that without a group of consultants to assist you at every
step, performing your training and overseeing your projects, you’re doomed to failure.
285
Chapter 16: Ten Implementation Myths of Six Sigma

Given the title of this workbook, you can probably guess that this myth is wrong: You
can implement Six Sigma yourself! First of all, Six Sigma isn’t rocket science — yes, you
will have to figure some statistics, to be sure, but nothing over the heads of your top
staff. Second, the extensive body of experience across the industry has led to stan-
dardization and repeatability in the methods and approaches. Third, Six Sigma is now
well-supported, with hundreds of books and guides, dozens of conferences and sym-
posia, considerable online resources, standardized training curricula, and more.
The Six Sigma Approach Is Way
Too Expensive and Disruptive
The training can be as inexpensive or as extensive as you want, and the implementa-
tions can be as rigorous or as informal as you like. And while these choices may be dif-
ficult, at least now you have them — Six Sigma teams never used to have the choices
you do today.
On the cost front, the intellectual capital of Six Sigma can be bought and applied more
inexpensively and seamlessly than ever. It need not be expensive. The training materi-
als can be purchased from any number of providers — even on eBay! Most training
can be conducted online, which eliminates the time and expense of classroom train-
ing. Trainers are prevalent and you can contract with them or even hire them outright

If You’re Not Doing Black Belt Projects,
You’re Not Really Doing Six Sigma
We’ve saved one of the biggest Six Sigma myths for last. This myth is perpetuated on
several fronts:
 By trainers who overtrain because they make their money based on training days
 By purists and academicians who make their mark in esoterica
 By those Black Belts who have been put on a pedestal and consider anything
less to be inferior
Mostly, this myth is perpetuated on these fronts because Black Belt projects have
always had their place in Six Sigma — that’s simply the way it has always been done.
This notion that you have to do Black Belt projects or none at all is absurd for many
reasons. Most directly, the majority of an organization’s challenges simply don’t
require a Black Belt level of analysis to solve. (For that matter, many don’t require any
Belt level of analysis to solve!) Only a very small percentage of the problems are this
serious. If you’re solving real business problems by using Six Sigma tools and tech-
niques at a lower level than Black Belt, you’re still doing Six Sigma.

Chapter 17
Ten Tips for Finishing a Six Sigma
Project Successfully
In This Chapter
 Discovering the most important contributors to Six Sigma project success
 Avoiding pitfalls in completing your Six Sigma project
A
s with any type of project, managing Six Sigma projects is a balancing act: not too
much and not too little; not too long and not too short; not too many cooks and not
too few. As evident in the project definition phase in Chapter 4, and as with any project,
much of the risk and uncertainty in Six Sigma projects comes from the setup. But, then
again, you also face the long road to project completion — which isn’t exactly a picnic.
The project charter (see the “Charting the Entire Course” section later in this chapter) may
have launched your project successfully, but you may still encounter many pitfalls before
you actually complete the process. This chapter lists ten major areas of focus to avoid
those pitfalls and help you finish your Six Sigma project successfully.
Properly Scoping Your Project
The most common contributor to project failure is improper scoping of the project at the
outset. Scoping is the breadth of coverage. Typically, when projects are improperly scoped,
they’re scoped too broadly — in a noble but misguided attempt to address too many Ys 
(outputs) or too high-level Ys for improvement. Or, projects may be scoped too broadly
because multiple goals, multiple process owners, and multiple organizations are involved.
However, projects are sometimes scoped too narrowly — solving a problem that’s too
easy, already has a solution, or has an outcome that makes an insignificant impact.
A project has to be worth completing, but it also has to be achievable. As a rule, you’re much
better off if you define and solve a smaller problem instead of a larger one. Small projects are
usually achievable, but larger ones are fraught with increased risk. So, be sure to scope your
project tightly at the outset. Solve one problem at a time and don’t overcommit. As the expres-
sion goes, underpromise and overdeliver.
Anticipating Scope Creepy-Crawlies
Even if you scope the project perfectly from the beginning, the scope will naturally tend to
grow and expand as the project progresses. This unruly phenomenon, known as scope creep,
infects all projects. You must treat scope creep as the vicious and insidious monster that it

is, and you must fight unwaveringly against it! If someone wants more, don’t fall prey
to the seductive temptation to just take on more in an attempt to accomplish more and
satisfy more people. Even if you get more time and resources to accomplish more, you
risk failing in your primary objective. New or increased scope should be reserved for
another project.
Charting the Entire Course
A Six Sigma project is a process too, so it deserves maps, analysis, and controls just
like any other process. You must chart the course and create a SIPOC diagram for your
project. You accomplish this manageability by building and maintaining the project
charter, which contains all the ingredients you must manage to ensure that your proj-
ect is successful.
The project charter is your Magna Carta. It explicitly defines the scope and grants
authority to project activities. It’s the basis of communications and management. You
measure your accomplishments by its goals and milestones.
The project charter is a living document. Changes to the project in any form, including
scope (which is bad, but sometimes necessary), schedules, or resources, should be
reflected in a formal change to the project charter and should be properly communi-
cated and authorized. In this way, your changes are explicitly managed and approved.
Making Sure the Right People Are Aboard
Set sail on your project adventure with a core team of mates and hands, and be certain
that the following are true of your team:
 You have all the right roles and skills present.
 You have only the right roles and skills present.
Having the right roles and skills is critical to the success of any project. For a Six Sigma
project, make sure that your skill set includes the appropriate degree of measurement,
analytical, simulation, and experimental prowess needed to address the causes that
affect your significant Y. The key word here is “appropriate” — not too little and not too
much. If you have too little prowess, the problems overpower you, but if you have 
too much, you’re bound to overanalyze.
Remembering That Short Is Sweet
The milestone that matters most in your Six Sigma project is the endpoint — the point
where you have demonstrated the breakthrough improvement in the performance of
your key metric, or significant Y. Don’t waste one minute — get there as fast as you can.
Swift project completion is paramount for two reasons:
 You lose interest and support if your project drags out. Team members with short
attention spans will turn away, resources will dwindle, and people will lose confi-
dence. Conversely, success attracts support and creates positive momentum.
288
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Slow project completion delays the creation of value in the organization. The
cost of delay is significant — it cheats the organization out of money it would
have if the project were completed.
Setting Achievable Goals
Some Six Sigma projects have failed not because they weren’t important, well-defined,
or properly staffed and supported, but because the improvements simply weren’t
achievable. After beginning with the best intentions, team members expect the project
to reel in Xs whose controls were simply beyond reach.
The solutions that affect your significant Y must be practically achievable. As you
complete your analyses and realize the critical few Xs that affect the outcomes, make
sure in the improvement phase that you can actually implement the changes. Keep
those changes simple, practical, understandable, and controllable.
Communicating for Success
Most projects and institutions are plagued by a failure to communicate. This failure
results in lost time, ineffective outcomes, frustrated participants, overrun budgets, 
and unmet expectations due to a lack of awareness, coordination, and participation.
Project leaders must regularly plow through these barriers.
In a Six Sigma project, communications failures most often include the failure to com-
municate with the groups whose processes, roles, obligations, workloads, empires,
behaviors, and attitudes are redefined as you modify the critical Xs that create break-
through performance in your significant Y. Not communicating with these groups can
result in your failure to fully move a critical X, and therefore not achieve breakthrough.
Satisfying the Stakeholders
For every Six Sigma project, you find key stakeholders — the individuals who really
matter and whose personal or professional agendas are significantly enhanced by a
successful project outcome. At the end of the day, if you’re successful and the stake-
holders realize it, you’ll likewise be rewarded.
These stakeholders may not necessarily be visible, and they may not even be openly
supportive of the project. In fact, they may feign opposition in certain circles. However,
knowing who they are and understanding the value and power they represent is vitally
important. The true stakeholders may be executives, managers, or rank and file —
basically anyone in the organization who will benefit when your project succeeds.
Maintaining Active and Unwavering Support
Maintaining active and unwavering support from the coalition of benefactors and benefi-
ciaries alike is vital to the success of your project. Your most direct and authoritarian
support comes from the official channels of approval, but you may also receive power-
ful support from the stakeholders.
289
Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Finishing a Six Sigma Project Successfully

Remember that Six Sigma projects often alienate those who have a vested interest in
maintaining the status quo of the critical Xs. The success of your project means that
you must marshal and maintain the armada of support required to displace all the
resistance. Keep your channels of support fully informed, enroll your supporters in the
process, and make them part of the success! Ask for help when you need it. And don’t
forget: You’re enabled on this mission to pursue breakthrough performance gains in
your significant Y and empowered to change the critical Xs.
Applying Formal Project Management
Just because Six Sigma projects are different from design or development projects
doesn’t mean that the formal rules of project management don’t apply, because in 
reality they do. If you want your project to be successful, you need to treat the man-
agement of your project with the respect it deserves through the application of the
methods and tools of formal project management.
Such formalities include the following:
 Official project documentation library
 Formal control, release, and configuration management of project information
 Official and prompt project status reporting and communications
 Strict budget, schedule, and milestone management
 Clearly defined and communicated participants, roles, and responsibilities
