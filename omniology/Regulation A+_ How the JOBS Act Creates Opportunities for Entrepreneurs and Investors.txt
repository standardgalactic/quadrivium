Foreword
This book is a must-read for all entrepreneurs who need to raise capital to 
grow their businesses. 
The launch on June 19, 2015, of “Regulation A+”—the colloquial shorthand for 
the SEC rules that amend, expand, and replace Regulation A of the Securities 
Act of 1934 as mandated by Congress under Title IV of the JOBS Act of 
2012—marks the most powerful positive change in the securities industry 
since 1934. 
During more than 40 years in the venture capital industry, I have personally 
been close to the growth challenges faced by smaller firms, and I have assisted 
many companies to raise public and private capital. During the past 20 years 
I have witnessed a steady decline in the number of new companies that have 
been able to successfully access the public markets and seen the number of 
IPOs and publicly listed firms decline in the United States relative to other 
countries. In recent years I concluded that the increasing obstacles faced by 
small companies to raising growth capital had reached a crisis, and I felt it was 
time to change the regulations responsible for the slow-down. 
I decided to get personally involved by helping to architect the required 
changes to allow small companies to regain the ability to raise capital not 
only from larger funds and wealthy investors but also from small investors. It 
was critically important that smaller companies be enabled to provide more 
liquidity and tradability in the shares they sell to their investors than they 
could by selling the currently popular Regulation D securities. Over the course 
of several years, I worked with numerous people, including U.S. senators 
and congressmen, to help craft Title IV of the JOBS Act as the platform for 
Regulation A+. I believe Regulation A+ as constructed by the SEC will play a 
crucial role in helping small companies raise the necessary capital to grow 
their businesses and in reinvigorating this stalled sector of the U.S. economy. 

Foreword 
viii
The authors have done an excellent job of compiling and interpreting all the 
relevant materials to produce a very useful guide to Regulation A+, explaining 
its beneficial features and the practical considerations and techniques for 
putting them to best use in a variety of businesses. This is a complete guide 
for entrepreneurs who need to evaluate their new range of options for raising 
capital to grow their businesses. Chapters 1 and 2 review and evaluate the 
various options for capital formation and what may or may not work for a 
particular situation. Chapter 3 details the various elements of Regulation A+ 
and compares them to the corresponding elements of the other options in 
terms of benefit, cost, and time for funding. Chapter 4 examines the applications 
and limitations of Regulation A+. Chapters 5 through 8 provide all the details 
small companies need to use Reg A+ to raise capital and manage stock 
listings if they choose to allow secondary stock transactions. The final chapter 
summarizes the appropriate uses and applications of Reg A+. The appendices 
contain reference material from the SEC and other relevant sources. The text 
is illustrated by numerous tables and charts.
I congratulate the authors of Regulation A+: How the JOBS Act Creates 
Opportunities for Entrepreneurs and Investors on their timely creation of this 
authoritative and accessible guide designed to assist the millions of U.S. 
entrepreneurs who are now eligible to capitalize on the rich opportunities for 
small company growth afforded by Reg A+.

Introduction
Why Did We Write This Book?
“Connecting small entrepreneurs with small investors”
We Have Been On Both Sides of Funding
Over the last 20 years we have made dozens of investments in small growth 
companies as well as raised capital for scores of projects in the fields of 
high technology and commercial real estate or represented any number  
of individuals or entities doing just that. During this period we met hundreds 
of entrepreneurs who needed capital and scores of VCs, bankers, and both 
high net worth and small investors. In reflecting back on those experiences, 
certain messages became quite evident from these personal experiences in 
addition to a huge amount of data that validates the conclusions contained in 
this book.
Too Many Missed Opportunities
Over the years we have seen many worthwhile projects that either never get 
started or had a short life due to the limited amount of available capital that 
entrepreneurs could raise due to increasingly limited capital-raising options 
available to them. Eventually only a small number of projects actually received 
adequate capital and many good projects that could have been very successful 
died prematurely. 
Small Investors Left Out
When raising investment funds on behalf of entrepreneurs, many small 
investors wanted to participate but had to be turned away as they did not 
meet the accredited high net worth criteria imposed by the SEC. Although 
the collective numbers and wealth of smaller investors is greater than the 
fewer high net worth investors, these investors were denied opportunity to 
participate in many attractive investment opportunities. 

Introduction 
xiv
No Liquidity for Years for Investors
Most of the private investment opportunities obtain their funding in Regulation 
D private offerings, and, in most cases, investors had to wait 10–15 years to 
achieve returns, if any, due to the illiquid nature of Regulation D offerings. 
Many times, companies were unable to raise additional capital and had to 
close their doors. Investors lost all their money because they could not raise 
further capital in the public markets. 
How Do You Make Sense of a Changing 
Landscape?
While Regulation A+ is a very powerful and positive development in addressing 
fundraising and liquidity issues faced by entrepreneurs as well as providing 
investment options to small investors, it is not going to be an easy path to 
success. There are hundreds of large funds, broker-dealers, and others who 
have a strong vested interest in maintaining the “status quo,” or are timid 
when it comes to uncertainty concerning a new market. Therefore, we felt it 
was critical that larger groups of entrepreneurs and investors be introduced 
to the benefits they can draw from utilizing Reg A+ for their next capital raise, 
relative to all other options they may have. Demand builds markets!
Since the passage of JOBS Act in 2012, there is a huge overload of sometimes 
confusing and conflicting information on the Internet concerning the JOBS Act 
and Regulation A+. We felt it was important to take a top-down approach to 
develop an easy-to-understand and, hopefully, useful guide to facilitate making 
a proper evaluation of this exciting new option for capital raising and investing. 

C h a p t e r 
Introduction
With overwhelming bipartisan support, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act 
(the JOBS Act) was passed in April, 2012.1 It ushered in a new era of capital 
formation and job creation that is already being predicted by many to have a 
profoundly positive, transformational impact on the U.S. economy. For reasons 
detailed in this book, we believe one of the most impactful areas of the JOBS 
Act is the creation of important updates to Regulation A. Regulation A is a 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation that permits firms to 
raise capital with less burdensome requirements. This paves the way for many 
companies to raise capital via “mini-IPOs” (Initial Public Offerings), which are 
far less costly than full IPOs but achieve many of the same objectives.
Prior to the JOBs Act, investments in non-publicly traded firms were effec-
tively limited to wealthy individuals and institutions. Provisions of the JOBs 
Act, including Regulation A+, are a major game changer and now allow entre-
preneurs to more easily access a much larger pool of potential investors who 
have previously not been permitted to invest in emerging businesses.
Federal law requires all offers to sell securities and all sales of securities to be 
registered unless an exemption to registration applies. A security is broadly 
defined as “an investment contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person 
invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely 
from the efforts of others.” Securities typically involve investments in intan-
gible items such as a share of stock rather than tangible items such as a house 
or a car. If you are seeking to raise money for a business, you will be offering a 
security and must comply with existing laws. Since the registration of a secu-
rity can be costly and time-consuming, many firms seeking to raise funds often 
seek to obtain one or more exemptions from registration.

Chapter 1 | Introduction

Obtaining an exemption can pose additional challenges since exemptions usu-
ally have restrictions that limit the types of investors who can be attracted and 
also impose added administrative overhead. The most common used exemp-
tion from securities registration is Regulation D (“Reg D”) promulgated under 
section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended. Firms electing this 
exemption are limited to obtaining funds from wealthy or “accredited” inves-
tors or institutions, which severely limits the potential pool of investors who 
are allowed to invest under this exemption. Also a commonly used Reg D 
exemption, called 506, prohibits public solicitation and general advertising to 
attract investors.
Under the new Regulation A (“Reg A+”), a company may raise up to $50 million  
in a 12-month period and it may offer its shares to both accredited and 
non-accredited investors, with some limited restrictions on the amount of a  
non-accredited investor’s investment. In addition, Reg A+ has no restrictions 
on general solicitations or advertising.
Among the most compelling benefits to entrepreneurs of structuring an offer-
ing under Reg A+ is the ability to attract both accredited and non-accredited 
investors and take advantage of public advertising to expose their offerings. 
Since less than 1% of population qualifies as an accredited investor, Reg A+ pro-
vides a means for entrepreneurs to access the other 99% of potential investors 
and thereby greatly expand the potential pool of funds to draw from. Firms that 
are unable to attract a sufficient amount of funds from accredited investors 
can utilize Reg A+ to tap into their customer base or into regional investors 
who may be familiar with the firm or have an affinity to invest locally. To better 
understand the objectives of the JOBS Act, it is important to first understand 
several negative trends that have created the need for the new legislation.
Historically, capital raising in the United States has been a function of operat-
ing in one or two spaces—an IPO, with a complete registration of the offer-
ing of securities, or a “private” offering, usually under Regulation D. Prior to 
roughly 20 years ago, we saw a much more diverse number of IPOs based on 
size, maturity of the issuer, industry, and strategy of the business. IPOs were 
also conducted by a more diverse set of financial institutions, both in market 
focus and region. We have seen this window steadily narrowing since that 
time for reasons discussed in this chapter. The result has been that more 
companies seeking capital have to look to private transactions, either through 
private equity groups/venture capital firms or Regulation D offerings to indi-
vidual or “retail” investors. As discussed in this chapter, this has resulted in 
a seriously more challenging market to raise capital privately. For reasons 
detailed throughout this book, we believe that Regulation A+ provides a viable 
alternative to Regulation D and private equity for growing businesses outside 
of more traditional registered public offerings.

IPOs and Job Creation: Coupled Trends
From 1996 through 2011, the number of companies entering the U.S. capi-
tal markets through IPOs dropped dramatically relative to historical norms. 
During this period, listings on U.S. national stock exchanges declined from 
8,800 companies to less than 5,000. Over the years from 2001 to 2012, 
IPOs were down to about a hundred per year versus 300–400 a decade ago2 
(Figure 1-1). This downward trend has been more severe than the potentially 
offsetting economic cycles during that period and had a negative impact on 
U.S. job creation. In fact, by one estimate, the decline of the U.S. IPO market 
has cost America as many as 22 million jobs through 2009.3 During this same 
period, competition from foreign capital markets intensified, and new listings 
on overseas exchanges doubled. Today, less than 10% of global firms choose 
to list on U.S. exchanges, compared to 48% in the 1990s.4 This slowdown 
in U.S. IPOs and the diversion of global capital away from the U.S. markets 
has slowed American job growth and threatens to undermine U.S. economic 
superiority for decades to come.
Figure 1-1.  Number of IPOs per year, 1991–2014. The number dropped steeply in 1996 and 
remained low until 2013, when a rebound occurred owing in part to the impact of the JOBS 
Act. (Source: IPO Task Force, “Rebuilding the IPO On-Ramp,” October 20, 2011)

David Weild, former Vice Chairman of NASDAQ, published findings that it 
takes 360 new corporate listings a year to replace what is lost in an average 
year from mergers and acquisitions and regulatory delistings. We have aver-
aged only about 150 IPOs a year since 2000. Weild further characterized the 
IPO spurt in 2013 and 2014 as “dead cat bounce” years coming off the highly 
depressed years of the credit crisis, which began in 2007–08. In spite of cham-
pagne corks popping on Wall Street, neither 2013 nor 2014 generated the 360 
corporate IPOs needed to even tread water.
As troubling as these statistics are, the failure of the United States to keep 
pace with international markets further underscores its growing inability to 
maintain its lead in fostering entrepreneurial growth and capital formation 
(see Figure 1-2).

Congressman: “Which one would you like to be Mr. Weild?… On second

Jobs and IPOs
The relationship between IPOs and job creation has been widely studied. One 
such study by the Ewing Marion Kaufman Foundation concluded the following:
While many young businesses fail, the young businesses that have survived 
have exhibited high average growth rates (with the latter dominated by the 
most rapidly growing young businesses). In addition, the evidence shows 
that the high-growth surviving young firms have contributed substantially 
to productivity growth.5
A study6 presented to the U.S. Treasury by the IPO Task Force, a cross-
industry group, reported that 92% of a typical company’s employment growth 
occurs after the IPO (Figure 1-3).7

Another study, prepared by Grant Thornton LLP, cites that the United States 
has lost more than 22 million jobs because of lost IPOs since the 1990s.8 
While the drop in IPOs does not solely account for the weak job growth of 
the past decade, it is difficult to look at the data and not conclude that steps 
to reinvigorate IPOs would have a positive impact on job growth.
The decrease in IPOs raised a number of concerns that were directly related 
to the creation of the JOBS Act. Since the drop in IPO activity has been most 
severe among small firms,9 reducing burdens for smaller companies became a 
central focus of the JOBS Act.
Why Have IPOs Declined?
A number of factors contributed to the decadal decline in IPOs (Table 1-1), 
including market changes and growing governmental regulations. Electronic 
trading, which started in the mid-1990s, put downward pressure on trad-
ing commissions and fees that in turn paid for ongoing market coverage— 
especially for smaller issues.10 The elimination in 2001 of traditional spreads 
by the introduction of decimalization11—moving stock-tick intervals from a 
sixteenth of a dollar to a penny—hastened the departure of many analysts 
and market makers from traditional brokerages to hedge funds. There, they 
could make a better living working in the new world of high-frequency, zero-
spread trading.
Added costs and administrative burdens due to creeping regulation—including 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley,12 Sarbanes-Oxley,13 and Dodd-Frank14—have further 
limited IPO options for smaller issuers. As a result, the average time from 
company inception to going public has been pushed out from 4.8 years in the 
early 1980s to 9.4 years since 2007.15

In this environment, smaller firms are simply unable to afford the cost of rais-
ing capital, and market makers are unwilling to cover companies until they 
have become much larger than was the case earlier. The average cost of going 
public coupled with the costs of regulatory compliance have limited the IPO 
option to fewer and fewer companies (Figure 1-4).

Force August 2011 CEO Survey
The reduction in IPOs has also led to a significant decrease in opportuni-
ties for the investors and employees of growth companies to gain liquidity 
for their shares. This has in part led to an increase in merger and acquisi-
tion (M&A) activity as companies seek exits for their investors (Figure 1-5). 
Ironically, the rapid increase in M&A has thwarted the growth of jobs since 
many firms lose employees after being acquired by larger firms.16 Arguably, if 
many of these acquired companies had the option to go IPO instead to raise 
capital, the United States likely would have created more jobs.

At the same time, studies indicate that 50% to 80% of all mergers fail, further 
dampening prospects for job creation and revenue growth.17 The cumulative 
loss to the economy stemming from the inability of so many companies to 
raise growth capital at earlier stages in their maturity cycle is suggested by 
the positive impact that successful startups that are able to grow and remain 
independent have on U.S. GDP.
Challenges in Raising Growth Funds from 
Venture Capital Firms
Contrary to the belief of many aspiring entrepreneurs, only a miniscule num-
ber of firms succeed in obtaining funds from venture capital firms. Of the 
approximately 2 million businesses that are created each year, only 600–800 
firms—far less than 1%—are funded via venture capital.18 The majority of ven-
ture capital funds seek early-stage companies with strong business plans and 
management teams who have aspirations to grow to $100M+ in revenues and 
exit in less than 10 years. Due to the highly risky nature of early-stage invest-
ing, VC firms need to achieve very high returns on a portion of their portfolio

to offset the losses on the remaining firms that do not achieve success. The 
typical investment criteria are set far above where most traditional business 
would qualify.
Furthermore, the types of investors who invest in typical venture capital deals 
are willing to lose substantial equity on many failed opportunities in order 
to realize a far greater return on the few companies who are able to realize 
extraordinary returns. The high-risk high-return nature of venture capital not 
only limits the types of firms that can succeed in attracting venture capital, 
but also highly limits the pool of potential investors who have the capacity to 
assume great risk. 
While later-stage companies with established business lines and customers 
can pose less risk to VC investors, the required high hurdle rates of return 
still severely limit the number of later-stage firms that can obtain VC capital. 
Also, the capital needs of later-stage firms are typically greater and can often 
exceed the level of resources that can be provided from VC investors—even 
if their strict investment criteria can be met. Finally, since most VC firms have 
an investment horizon of no more than 10–12 years owing to caps on their 
ongoing management fees, there is a declining incentive to support mature 
companies that require added growth capital.
Challenges in Obtaining Other Sources of 
Capital
Once a new business has proven its business model, established a market 
­presence, and developed product lines and distribution channels broad enough 
to meet the requirements of its largest customers, it may face its greatest 
capital demands. Cash flow from operations is often not sufficient to meet the 
needs of more mature companies, and the lure of obtaining funds from public 
markets can be compelling even in face of the growing number of obstacles.
It is common to find firms that have grown modestly for many years only to 
reach a plateau. New capital is then needed to restart their upward growth 
by providing the needed resources to take advantage of new opportunities. 
Funds raised by later-stage firms are often used to expand penetration into 
markets, acquire smaller firms, increase investment in R&D, and strengthen 
their balance sheets. All this improves their credit standing and attractiveness 
to investors and raises the value of their firms.
Whether a business owner is looking to modify his current capital structure 
or seeking new growth capital, money is hard to come by today. Excluding 
IPOs, the sources of external growth capital include bank loans, industry alli-
ances, factoring of receivables, and investors. Not only are these types of 
sources more difficult to tap into, but they also can create additional liabilities

and exposure for the firm’s executives. Short-term debt can be very helpful 
to raising capital for tactical projects, but companies saddled with excessive 
long-term debt find that the value of their firm, relative to industry norms, is 
significantly impacted. 
Regulation D
One of the most common and popular ways to raise growth capital outside of 
a public stock offering has been to privately offer ownership interests using a 
registration exemption under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 called 
Regulation D (“Reg D”). The amount of capital raised under Reg D offerings is 
well over $1 trillion annually. Regulation D has been used as a means of raising 
capital ranging from seed-stage “mom and pop” investments to hundreds of 
millions of dollars for later-stage firms owing largely to reduced SEC reporting 
requirements and the relative speed in which offering19 materials can be pro-
duced. Although Regulation D offerings are the primary means today for rais-
ing growth capital for early-stage ventures or specific short-term (2–5 years) 
projects, they suffer from the following limitations and restrictions:
• 
Private fundraising under Regulation D is largely limited 
to accredited investors who have a net worth in excess 
of $1M, excluding their primary residence20 or income 
of more than $200,000 per year (or $300,000 per mar-
ried couple) during the past two years or to qualified 
institutions.
• 
Trading of Reg D shares is highly restricted and cannot 
be done in public markets. As a result, Reg D investments 
are considered “illiquid” and invested funds can be tied up 
indefinitely (anywhere from 5 to 20 years) unless there is 
a sale of the firm or an IPO.
19https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/whitepapers/dera-unregistered-
offerings-reg-d.pdf at Page 2
20While the value of the primary residence is excluded, if the Fair Market Value (FMV) 
of the primary residence is below the loan value, the added debt beyond FMV must be 
further subtracted to determine if the net worth of an investor meets the accredited 
investor definition. For example, if an investor’s personal residence is worth $500K and 
the mortgage owned is $600K, $100K needs to be subtracted when computing net worth.

Regulation A+
11
• 
Due to poor performance of many investments that have 
been made under Reg D, many broker-dealers are unwill-
ing to consider offering new Reg D investments to their 
clients. Although the Reg D investment structure was 
not primarily responsible for the failure of investments 
during the recent economic downturn, “Reg D” has been 
stigmatized and regulatory boards such as FINRA have 
placed added burdens on securities reps who offer such 
securities. Liability insurance premiums have also skyrock-
eted for those intermediaries that offer Reg D securities.
The lack of liquidity of Reg D also creates valuation problems. Since no 
public market exists, it’s difficult to impossible to assess the value of Reg D 
investments.
Effective September 23, 2013, the SEC adopted amendments to Regulation D 
that removed the previous prohibition against general solicitation. “General 
solicitation” is broadly defined in the amendment to include virtually any print, 
electronic, and other public means of exposing securities offerings to inves-
tors. While the general public may now become aware of new offerings, the 
amendment also limited investors who may purchase an advertised offering 
to only those who are “accredited investors.” The amendment also placed 
additional burdens on issuers and broker-dealer intermediaries to verify the 
accredited status of each investor.
Even with these latest modifications, the growing backlash against Regulation D 
by many securities broker-dealers has further dried up capital raising options 
for smaller firms. The net result of these growing constraints to obtaining 
growth capital is that far too many promising companies are unable to take 
full advantage of transformational opportunities and are limited to relatively 
tepid growth due to capital starvation.
Chapter 3 systematically compares Regulation D with Regulation A+.

■Note  Pre-JOBS Act regulations made it increasingly difficult for both early- and later-stage 
companies to obtain the capital they needed when they needed it, and for investors to cash out in a 
timely manner.
An Overview of the JOBS Act
The major goals of the JOBS Act are to reinvigorate job growth and ­create 
new capital formation opportunities, especially for smaller firms requir-
ing more growth options. After a long period of increasing regulation and 

Chapter 1 | Introduction
12
­constraints in finance, the JOBS Act is having a dramatic effect in moving the 
regulatory pendulum back toward easing the process of capital formation and 
increasing economic growth.
The JOBS Act is comprised of the following six titles (sections), considered  
in turn.
Title I: Reopening American Capital Markets to 
Emerging Growth Companies
Most commonly referred to as the “IPO On-Ramp” legislation, Title I provides 
smaller companies new options and incentives for going public through a pro-
cess whereby public company obligations are phased in over time. This title 
creates a new category of companies referred to as emerging growth companies 
(EGCs).21 A firm may elect to become an EGC and realize related benefits 
under the title, provided its sales are less than $1 billion per year.
Under Title I of the JOBS Act, an EGC22 is allowed numerous exemptions from 
and relaxations of costly reporting and disclosure requirements and rules, 
such as the following:
• 
A five-year grace period from certain reporting under 
current federal law and regulations.
• 
To use reduced financial disclosures, including only two 
years of audited financial statements and less-stringent 
executive compensation reporting standards.
• 
To confidentially pre-file its IPO registration statement 
with the SEC for its review.
• 
To “test the waters” for its prospectus with select quali-
fied investors.
21http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cfjjobsactfaq-title-i-
general.htm
22An Emerging Growth Company is defined as a company which:
(a) Has under $1 billion in revenue;
(b) Completed its IPO less than five years ago;
(c) Has less than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and
(d) Is not a “Large Accelerated Filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Regulation A+
13
Title II: Broader Access to Capital for Job Creators
Title II removes the prohibition against general solicitation and general 
­advertising in private offerings under Regulation D, provided that all of the 
purchasers of securities are accredited investors.23 However, the securities 
remain restricted from resale. This title also addresses certain issues for 
intermediaries including broker–dealers, and includes provisions that ease 
fundraising under Rule 144a.
Title III: Crowdfunding
Title III provides an exemption for crowdfunding—raising funds broadly through 
Internet portals—by permitting offerings up to $1 million. Requirements tar-
geted at investor protection are imposed on the issuer and on the interme-
diary involved in the crowdfunding effort. This title also addresses certain 
broker-dealer issues for intermediaries. The following constraints and limita-
tions are included in Title III:
• 
Crowdfunding must take place with an approved offer-
ing document that will likely require an attorney and 
be placed through either registered or regulated fund-
ing portals or broker-dealers that meet certain require-
ments, thereby raising costs that will limit the amount of 
net capital that can be obtained.
23In the US, an accredited investor is defined by the following:
1. A bank, insurance company, registered investment company, business development 
company, or small business investment company;
2. An employee benefit plan, within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act, if a bank, insurance company, or registered investment adviser makes 
the investment decisions, or if the plan has total assets in excess of $5 million;
3. A charitable organization, corporation, or partnership with assets exceeding  
$5 million;
4. A director, executive officer, or general partner of the company selling the securities;
5. A business in which all the equity owners are accredited investors;
6. A natural person who has individual net worth, or joint net worth with the person’s 
spouse, that exceeds $2 million at the time of the purchase, or has assets under 
management of $1 million or above, excluding the value of their primary residence;[2][3]
7. A natural person with income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent 
years or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a 
reasonable expectation of the same income level in the current year; or
8. A trust with assets in excess of $5 million, not formed to acquire the securities 
offered, whose purchases a sophisticated person makes.

• 
Issuers need to file financial statements annually and file 
reports of the operations with the SEC.
• 
Issued shares are restricted and cannot be traded for one 
year.
• 
Eligible firms are limited and cannot include foreign 
­issuers and investment companies.
• 
Individual investors are limited to investing only up to

the greater of $2,000 or 5% of annual income or net

• 
10% of the investors’ annual income or net worth, up 
to $100,000, if such an annual income or net worth 
equals or exceeds $100,000.
Shortly after the JOBS Act legislation was announced, the crowdfunding 
­provisions became an immediate lightning rod, attracting cash-hungry startup 
entrepreneurs, wannabe portal firms, and harsh critics fearful that scam artists 
would bilk hapless investors under the proposed new rules. Proponents were 
quick to point out that the investor safeguards in the JOBS Act are sufficient 
to balance crowdfunding risks and benefits, and that many other less-regulated 
investment options, such as investing in common stocks, are permitted today.
Also cited was the fact that government-encouraged sales of lottery tick-
ets and other forms of gambling at about $140 billion per year dwarf the  
$40 ­billion or so of investment funds in startups/growth firms made each year. 
Yet crowdfunding continues to be portrayed by many of its critics as a vehicle 
for victimizing unsuitable investors.
Despite Title III constraints and media criticism, crowdfunding has begun to 
play a significant a role in providing new options for smaller firms to raise 
capital.
Title IV (“Regulation A+”): Small Company 
­Formation
Title IV—commonly referred to as “Regulation A+” or “Reg A+”—amends 
the previous Regulation A legislation in the following areas:
• 
Title IV increases the amount permitted to be raised 
from $5 million to $50 million each year indefinitely.
• 
Shares are generally unrestricted and can immediately be 
traded, thereby providing liquidity to investors, manage-
ment, and employees holding shares.
• 
Advertising and general solicitation are generally 
permitted.

Regulation A+
15
• 
Non-accredited investors are allowed to invest.
• 
A broad number of firms can raise funds.
• 
Title IV requires slightly more detailed SEC-specified 
offering disclosures.
• 
Title IV requires annual audited financial statements to be 
filed with the SEC.
• 
Larger Reg A+ offerings—called “Tier 2” and discussed in 
Chapter 2—are exempt from state “blue sky” reporting 
requirements.
• 
Title IV requires ongoing reporting to the SEC but 
with fewer disclosure requirements than for traditional  
“public” companies.
On June 19, 2015, the SEC adopted the final rules for Regulation A+ in response 
to ongoing comments received since the initial framework was outlined in the 
JOBS Act. The final rules are largely consistent with the original intent of 
the JOBS Act with several important updates. Per the final rules, Regulation  
A+ includes two tiers: Tier 1 for offerings up to $20M and Tier 2 for offerings 
up to $50M—both within any twelve month period. The differences in the 
tiers are largely due to differing reporting and disclosure requirements. Most 
significantly, issuers who meet Tier 2 disclosure and reporting requirements 
are exempt from state blue sky pre-sale reviews, which have been cited as one 
of the major obstacles that previously limited the attractiveness of Regulation 
A as a means of fundraising. A more complete discussion of the final rules for 
Regulation A+ can be found in Chapter 5.
We believe Regulation A+ can provide a more attractive means of raising  
capital for many growing companies than either the Regulation D private 
placement or the traditional IPO. The benefits and trade-offs of Regulation 
A+ form the central theme of this book.
■
■Note  Regulation A+ is a huge new development for growth companies: it can indeed serve as a 
“mini-IPO” for many companies. It is the subject of this book.
Title V: Private Company Flexibility and Growth
Title V increases the 1934 Exchange Act registration shareholder-of-record 
threshold from 500 to 2,000 (only 500 of which can be non-accredited 
investors).

Chapter 1 | Introduction
16
Title VI: Capital Expansion
Title VI increases the shareholder-of-record threshold from 500 to 2,000 for 
banks and bank holding companies, and it provides that a bank or bank holding 
company could terminate the 1934 Exchange Act registration if the number of 
holders of record drops to less than 1,200.
These changes are significant. The 1934 Exchange Act and its related rules 
currently require a company to register with the SEC and file periodic ­public 
reports if, on the last day of its fiscal year, the company had total assets 
­exceeding $10,000,000 and a class of equity securities generally held of record 
by 500 or more persons (both conditions must be met).
Under Title V and Title VI of the JOBS Act, the number of shareholders of record 
that a company may have before it must register under the 1934 Exchange Act 
is increased from 500 to 2,000 or by 500 or more persons who are not accred-
ited investors—thereby reducing regulatory burdens and related costs. The 
threshold for total assets remains unchanged at $10,000,000. Shareholders 
who received their securities through an employee compensation plan or 
an offering conducted under the “crowdfunding” exemption in Title III of the 
JOBS Act do not count toward the holders-of-record thresholds.
Implications and Overview of the Book
This book is primarily a how-to guide on utilizing the new Regulation A+ 
rules to raise capital from accredited investors and institutions in addition 
to more than 100 million non-accredited investors and to provide liquidity 
in the most effective manner for all stakeholders. That includes management, 
­current and future investors, and service providers such as attorneys, auditors, 
i-Banks, financial advisors, research analysts, and so forth. “It takes a village 
to grow a child,” and that tight and intimate coordination of all members of 
the ­fundraising team is required to achieve a successful outcome. We will 
therefore ­discuss the roles and responsibilities of the various team members 
throughout the book and suggest coordination processes that we believe will 
assist firms in obtaining their fundraising objectives.
This book has two critical objectives for the reader seeking to successfully 
utilize Regulation A+:
• 
Education about the processes involved
• 
First and foremost, how and where to seek advice and 
resources to accomplish fundraising and, if possible, 
liquidity goals
Do you have customers and growing revenues? Do you have a good-enough 
story to attract investors who are seeking not only a return on their capital, 

Regulation A+
17
but also a return of their capital? Can your company stand up to close scrutiny 
by due-diligence analysts? If so, the good news is that your firm may be able 
to successfully raise growth capital under Regulation A+—even if you are not 
the next Google, Apple, or LinkedIn.
Regulation A+ opens up potential fundraising channels that may not require 
the high multiple returns that many venture capital firms require. Indeed, there 
are many qualified investors who seek opportunities to invest in solid, grow-
ing bread-and-butter businesses but who before Regulation A+ did not have a 
means of doing so. This book explores potential fundraising channels in more 
detail, including suggestions on finding appropriate investors for your firm.
Although it might seem that growing the use of Regulation A+ would tend 
to diminish the popularity of the current IPO or Regulation D private place-
ment fundraising approaches, we believe Reg A+ simply expands the scope 
and opportunity for fundraising by allowing many non-accredited investors 
to profit from pre-IPO growth companies by diversifying and optimizing the 
selections of their investments. For example, it may be important for an early-
stage startup to seek its initial capital and guidance from angel investors or 
a VC firm via a Regulation D private placement; whereas later-stage firms 
may seek much lower-cost capital through an mini-IPO based on Reg A+ and 
­continue a growth trajectory that might otherwise stall in the absence of 
growth capital.
■
■Tip  Reg A+ is in its infancy. The investment and entrepreneur communities must still work out 
optimal ways of working together to raise growth capital. A number of open issues still remain which 
are likely to be addressed by market reaction to Regulation A+ offerings in addition to further rulings 
that are likely to take place. The good news lays in the significant progress that has been made 
to date and the positive momentum that is moving to open up new funding options to benefit both 
entrepreneurs and investors.

C h a p t e r 
Overcoming 
Challenges to 
Going Public
Regulation A+ creates options for firms to raise capital beyond a Reg D and 
without a public registration, but instead via a mini-IPO that can be accom-
plished with less cost, time commitment, and resources than a full-blown IPO. 
However, an IPO is an IPO and, whatever type you choose, the outcome and 
many of the related issues are similar. Let’s start with a basic question.
Should My Firm Go Public?
Historically, many of America’s young companies have pursued the acquisition 
of later-stage growth capital through initial public offerings (IPOs) in order 
to have access to the additional capital they needed to hire new employees, 
develop their products, and expand their businesses globally. Fundraising via 
IPOs has enabled many companies to generate new jobs and revenue for 
the U.S. economy, while investors of all types have been attracted to ensuing 
growth to build their portfolios, personal incomes, and retirement accounts.

Chapter 2 | Overcoming Challenges to Going Public
20
The advantages of going public include:
• 
Funds are obtained from the offering, which can be used 
for added research and development, hiring additional 
personnel, expanding infrastructure, building interna-
tional distribution channels, retiring existing debt, acquir-
ing other companies, or diversifying product lines.
• 
Public offerings will often improve the balance sheet of 
the company, allowing the firm to obtain future capital 
or debt under more attractive terms. If a stock performs 
well in the aftermarket, additional capital can be raised 
from the public and from institutions. Once a public mar-
ket has been created for a stock and, if it performs well in 
the continuing aftermarket, substantial additional equity 
capital can be raised on favorable terms. The added secu-
rity that comes in having a tradable stock with a market 
value increases future financing options.
• 
The market value of a public company can be substantially 
higher than a private company with the same structure in 
the exact same industry. Statistics published by the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce say that sellers of private com-
panies receive an average of four to six times their net 
earnings. Whereas, public companies sell at an average 
of 20–25 times their net earnings. High-tech companies 
with good growth prospects can be valued even higher.
Investors in a private company will tend to discount the value of its stock 
due to its lack of liquidity. Furthermore, added disclosures and reports by 
third-party analysts who are often present for public companies tend to drive 
higher market values for their shares. Therefore, public companies are often 
valued much greater than comparable private companies in the same or simi-
lar industries. The availability of other alternatives to raising capital permits 
a public company greater leverage in its negotiations with investors. Most 
institutional and individual investors prefer investing in a public company since 
they have an exit—meaning they can sell their stock in the public market.  
Many companies that were private and about to be purchased went public to 
be purchased at a much higher price.

Regulation A+
21
Here are additional benefits provided by going public:
• 
If a publicly traded firm chooses to grow via acquisition of 
other firms, it can use its own securities to acquire firms 
with minimal impact on its cash balances.
• 
Businesses with public stock are typically better equipped 
to attract and hire quality personnel if they can include 
stock or stock options that have market liquidity. Also, since 
compensation from stock options may be taxed at lower 
capital gains rates than ordinary income, a more attractive 
compensation package can be offered to attract employees.
• 
Public companies generally enjoy greater market visibil-
ity, benefit from stronger branding of their products and 
trademarks, and also can improve the attractiveness of 
their goods and services to more discriminating custom-
ers who prefer to trade with companies whose finan-
cials and market value are more visible. Owners and 
employees of publicly traded firms often realize a greater 
sense of fulfillment and well-being in knowing that their 
investments of time and money can have a high degree of 
liquidity.1
• 
The initial sale of stock can provide cash to management, 
employees, and existing investors. Underwriters will usu-
ally view any excessive cash-out with disfavor since it 
may be perceived as a bail-out to the investing public that 
reduces the amount of the funds raised which go into 
building the company. However, underwriters will place 
limitations on cash-out through lock-ups (that is, delay-
ing the sale of shares of by insiders until some time has 
passed after outside investors have purchased the stock) 
and will also limit cash-outs by senior insiders to no more 
than 10% or 15% of the offering. Nevertheless, the liquid-
ity that is ultimately achieved by going public is a powerful 
tool to motivate company performance.

Chapter 2 | Overcoming Challenges to Going Public
22
• 
Public offerings create a source of liquidity for employees 
and investors who require an exit within a finite period 
to achieve expected returns on their investments. When 
a company remains private, its value cannot be easily cal-
culated or realized without a marketplace for its stock. 
Furthermore, many investment funds are established with 
a finite holding period, typically 10 years, and they need to 
realize liquidity or face issues, including loss of manage-
ment fees, potential penalties to the managing partners, 
and/or lack of resources to continue to manage funds 
beyond their stated expiration period.
The disadvantages to going public include:
• 
By definition, going public carries with it a responsibility 
for greater disclosure of the company’s financials, business 
strategies, and data on key executives and board members, 
including compensation details. Once a company’s publicly 
traded stock is being followed by analysts and market mak-
ers, comparisons of performance to competitors will be 
more frequent and comprehensive. By contrast, owners of 
privately held firms often have concerns that the exposure 
of information on sales, profits, competitive position, key 
customers, and material events may place their companies 
at a competitive disadvantage and/or provide unwelcomed 
exposure to their personal compensation plans.
• 
A public listing can be expected to reduce flexibility by 
management. Some actions that could be taken unilater-
ally by executives of a private firm may now need to be 
approved by shareholders and/or outside directors. Also 
certain business opportunities that may have been avail-
able personally to the firm’s executives may now need to 
be turned over to the company.
• 
Once a company’s stock is publicly listed, management 
decisions will tend to be biased based on the impact to 
near-term stock value. As a result, there may be tradeoffs 
that result in short-term gains at the expense of strategic 
investments and decisions.
• 
The added expenses and administrative overhead of 
maintaining a public listing can be significant. While the 
reduced reporting regime under Regulation A+ will signifi-
cantly lower these expenses relative to a traditional IPO, 
firms should carefully consider the added legal, account-
ing, and administrative expenses before making a decision 
to raise capital through an IPO.

Regulation A+
23
• 
Control by insiders is likely to diminish when greater por-
tions of the stock ownership shift to external investors.
• 
Executive management and board directors are subject 
to greater liability when their stock is public, including 
class actions and derivative lawsuits regarding violations 
of securities or corporate laws. Exposure to nuisance and 
even frivolous lawsuits may increase and require signifi-
cant expense and investment of time to defend.
• 
Tensions can develop due to conflicts between tax impli-
cations to executives versus those of investors on cer-
tain decisions, such as to whether to pay dividends. Also 
since public markets often place a higher value on publicly 
traded firms versus those that are privately held, estate 
taxes when leaving equity to heirs are likely to be higher.
Obviously, going public does not automatically turn a poorly-run unprofit-
able company into a more valuable one overnight. The public spotlight can 
magnify both positive and negative factors—with bad news often given more 
weight by public investors. Fortunately, companies that are contemplating pub-
lic financing options can seek preliminary feedback on their likely success 
through interviews with investment bankers and broker-dealers. They can 
also potentially take advantage of the “testing of the waters” provisions of the 
JOBS Act to receive direct investor feedback.
THE ROLE OF THE UNDERWRITER
Underwriters are IPO specialists who typically work for investment banks. Their 
responsibilities include verifying the firm has complied with all regulations, filed all 
required fees, and completed required financial data that will be presented to investors. 
Underwriters also interact with larger potential buyers of the firm’s securities, such as 
pension funds and insurance companies, to assess their interest in acquiring shares 
and also providing inputs for setting suitable IPO prices. The key objective in setting 
an IPO price is to strike a balance to insure that the full offering is sold out at a price 
that ensures anticipated proceeds to the issuer. Larger issuers are typically able to 
obtain guarantees from their underwriters of proceeds from securities sales. If the 
underwriters are unable to sell all the offered securities, they are required to purchase 
the excess. Underwriters for smaller issuers, including those using Regulation A+ for 
mini-IPOs, typically do not offer guarantees but instead work on a “best efforts” basis. 
An underwriter is not required for a Regulation A+ offering. The issuer may set its own 
price and sell its stock based on market receptivity. However, the use of third parties 
to assist in determining a realistic stock value so that fundraising goals are achieved is 
highly recommended.

What Are the Considerations in Seeking  
Public Financing?
Presuming that your firm has generally weighed the pros and cons of going 
public and still wishes to move forward with some form of IPO (whether 
a mini-IPO via Regulation A+ or a full-blown IPO), what are some of the 
­considerations that underwriters will consider when deciding if they will assist 
you in raising capital? 
Since we believe that Regulation A+ is best suited for established companies 
that have growing revenues and customer bases, and who are seeking expan-
sion capital to further fuel growth of an already proven business model, we 
will focus our comments on established businesses.
Underwriters and analysts consider the following questions in determining 
the value of new public company:
• 
What is the prior earnings history of the company going 
back at least three years? To what degree have previous 
financials been audited?
• 
Do prior earnings generally meet prior projections and, 
if not, are there solid reasons for any missed projections?
• 
Do balance sheet and income and expense ratios fit indus-
try norms and, if not, what is the explanation of these 
variances? What are the plans for correcting imbalances?
• 
Does the company have an experienced management 
team and board of directors that can adequately meet 
the added responsibilities of going public and achieving 
further growth objectives with the newly raised capital? 
Is there a plan in place for filling holes and a good succes-
sion plan for key contributors?
• 
How strong is the demand for the company’s current 
and anticipated new products? How strong is the new-
product pipeline?
• 
Who are the customers and how loyal are they? How 
certain are they to continue to buy the goods and ser-
vices offered?
• 
What is the company’s competitive position and how do its 
relative strengths and weaknesses measure up? Is the com-
pany a leader or at least a strong #2 in its region/market 
sector? Are the barriers to entry sufficient to maintain 
and grow market penetration in spite of competition?

Regulation A+
25
• 
What are the planned uses of capital and impact on future 
growth?
• 
If the company is growing at more modest rates, will it be 
able to offer a dividend?
• 
Is the company in a “bread and butter” sector or in a hot 
growth area? If the latter, many hot growth areas receive 
excessive funding and there are shakeouts. Will this firm 
be a survivor?
• 
What is the impact of the financing on a possible exit via a 
merger or acquisition? Occasionally, a plan to take a com-
pany public can excite potential acquirers to make a move 
and purchase the company before its value is bid up in the 
public markets.
Interactions with investment bankers, analysts, and broker–dealers during 
their due diligence activities can be stressful and tend to reveal issues that 
must be first overcome before a public financing or that must at the least be 
taken into consideration in establishing the offering structure and pricing of 
the security.
How Competitive Factors Shape 
Determination of Market Value
Management should make a preliminary focus in identifying public companies 
that are in the same industry sector and in a similar stage of development to 
obtain an initial estimate of a likely pre-funding market valuation. This data 
should then be organized and shared with potential lead underwriters, who 
will apply their own methodology to determine what they believe will be a  
fair market valuation. Issuers should be prepared for a fair amount of “give and 
take” in this process and argue their case with as many facts as possible that 
can be justified by solid market data while setting aside wishful or unrealistic 
valuation targets.
It is useful to first define a continuum for comparable public companies in 
your business sector, ranging from “strong” to “weak” and identify factors 
that contribute to their relative positioning. In general, a “stronger” company 
will have established and proven products, a solid defensible technology with 
barriers to entry, and a proven management team that consistently sets and 
meets or exceeds investor expectations.
Start with these more obvious discriminators and then add others that fit the 
range of public companies that you believe investors will consider in setting 
the value of your firm. During this process, it is also useful to obtain and read 

Chapter 2 | Overcoming Challenges to Going Public
26
copies of pre-registration and post-registration documents of similar firms 
in order to become familiar with the range of disclosures required by your 
market sector. This will give you a deeper sense of the potential market for 
the stock.
Once this general exercise is reasonably complete, give your executive team 
and trusted advisors an assignment to have them each place your firm in the 
overall continuum that you have created from your research. This should then 
be followed with group meetings where all participants can argue their vari-
ous points of view in order to derive a defendable group consensus of where 
your firm fits against other public firms.
This exercise is a critical step in reshaping the perceptions of the management 
team toward thinking about their contributions as outside investors may see 
them. The shift of thinking from a private company to a public company men-
tality can be difficult for even some very capable executives to grasp and 
internalize—and this process may reveal issues that are best dealt with earlier 
than later.
It is also possible that an objective and honest appraisal of the likely market 
valuation may result in the conclusion that the valuation of the stock may be 
so low as to result in significant dilution of ownership interests to outside 
investors. Once again, such issues are better confronted early in the process.
The next area to better understand is how your company’s future perfor-
mance may differ from the overall sector’s performance—both good and 
bad—and how those differences are likely to impact future value. While this 
analysis can have a bigger impact on market valuation, it is a more speculative 
area from which to reach objective conclusions.
At this point, external underwriters should begin to weigh in and provide 
their analysis and related conclusions. Keep in mind that different underwrit-
ers are likely to reach different conclusions and that the quality and depth of 
their feedback will be one of the determining factors for choosing one under-
writer over another (see Chapter 6 for additional considerations).2
2One thing to be aware of when applying to a Regulation A+ offering is that a formal 
underwriting or investment bank is not necessarily the norm to establish the value of the  
company’s stock. While Regulation A+ securities can be freely traded immediately, markets 
are not as established as with registered securities and the value is more likely to be 
set by the issuer who is selling the security. The process described above is even more 
important to be followed by executives because setting unrealistic stock values that are 
not supported by market data can lead to added company liability.

Regulation A+
27
Ultimately establishing the market value of a company is a very complex process  
and will be influenced by many factors. The key is to identify all the variables 
as soon as possible that are likely to affect pricing based on analyzing indus-
try comparables and also how investors will perceive future performance. 
What-if questions should also be posed once the valuation range has been set. 
For example, what happens if earnings are projected to increase X% during 
the registration process and they increase Y%?
After-Market Considerations
While a public market for Regulation A+ securities is yet to be established, we 
believe that many of the same considerations regarding after-market support 
that are required for full-blown IPOs will be in play.
Therefore, even with the Regulation A+ mini-IPO, it is critical to look beyond 
the IPO and consider new responsibilities that your firm will have in dealing 
with outside investors and meeting ongoing expectations. It is important to 
first understand that in today’s volatile economic climate, firms need to do 
much more to attract the interest of often nervous and skeptical investors.
There are approximately 100,000 publicly listed firms worldwide, with about 
5,000 companies on national exchanges in the U.S. (such as NASDAQ and 
NYSE) and an additional 10,000 firms listed on U.S. over-the-counter (OTC) 
markets in the United States. The majority of U.S. firms are microcap compa-
nies, having market values of $500 million or less. It is expected that the JOBS 
Act will create significant growth in the number of new public issues, thereby 
putting further pressure on young public companies to maintain ongoing 
efforts to attract interest in their stock.
While many investors gravitate toward better-known firms that are actively 
covered in the national financial press, there is still a large pool of investors 
out there who are willing to take a chance on investing in a small company at 
a low price (or price with a dividend), hoping to realize a larger return than 
might be possible with a better known firm. How to reach them and engage 
them is a problem most small companies face.
Today’s investor is far more sophisticated than the investors of the 1990s 
and early- to mid-2000s. They are savvy and know how to use the Internet 
to do their due diligence on a company. They follow conversations on mes-
sage boards, use social media, and do not invest for superficial reasons. As 
a CEO/CFO of a newly public small firm, you will need to become adept at 
setting and meeting realistic expectations. If you try to hide something from 
investors, they will inevitably find out what you are hiding and share their 
disappointments with other investors. This can have a destructive snowball 
effect, as everyone piles on by getting into the conversation and slamming 
your company.

Chapter 2 | Overcoming Challenges to Going Public

■
■Note  Today’s investors are sophisticated and they share information freely on the Internet. As 
an executive of a publicly traded company, you won’t be able to hide bad news or bad numbers from 
them. So don’t even try.
Investors don’t expect miracles all the time, but they do want to know what 
is going on with the company. They would rather hear bad news or indiffer-
ent news from your company than find out that kind of news on a message 
board or on a social media platform. Investors who find out bad news from 
another source will absolutely skewer your company and your management 
team. Today’s investor has a zero-tolerance policy for lack of communications 
from the companies they have put their hard-earned cash into. If you screw up 
and don’t handle it properly, expect the repercussions to be swift and severe.
Unless your investors are kept informed on a regular basis, they will begin to 
speculate on what your company is doing. Believe us, you do not want them 
speculating. Their speculation is almost always going to be negative and will 
eventually begin to influence even your best supporters among shareholders. 
In short, in the absence of information, some of your investors will begin to 
fill in that void with information that is grossly inaccurate (or perhaps very 
accurate, depending on what your company is doing).
An ongoing program of communicating with your investors will make a big 
difference. Companies that do this right will be rewarded at a far greater level 
than the investment made. Carefully consider the added responsibilities and 
risks that will come when you begin public trading and disclosures. You and 
your company and its board of directors need to have a temperament that 
is suited to interfacing with the public. Today’s investor also expects to be 
informed on a regular basis.
The motivation to go public is summarized in Figure 2-1. Raising capital to sup-
port future growth, differentiating your firm from competitors, and realizing 
higher value for your firm are all very compelling reasons to strongly consider 
the IPO option, especially in consideration of the reduced costs and reporting 
requirements introduced by the JOBS Act.

Regulation A+
29
Summary
Due to the avalanche of regulations and associated compliance costs that 
have occurred over the past 20 years, many firms simply no longer consider 
going public to raise growth capital. Even if you believe and, if trusted advisors 
tell you that your firm is not qualified to raise funds in public markets, it is 
now time for you to challenge this advice. In the chapters ahead, we present 
options that have been created by the JOBS Act that are already being utilized 
to varying degrees by a growing number of smaller companies. Against what 
has become conventional wisdom, these companies are succeeding in raising 
growth capital in ways very similar to how Apple, Cisco, Starbucks, and many 
other now large and famous firms first did many years ago. While the steps 
that we outline ahead are not suitable for all firms for a variety of reasons, 
there is no question that a new “old” has been created and is already having a 
very positive impact on capital formation.

Benefits of 
Regulation A+
Intel (INTC) went public in February 1971 with an IPO that raised $8M (million) 
supported by an underwriting group of 63 firms, of which fewer than 10 still 
exist. In March 1986, Microsoft (MSFT) went public with an offering of $58M 
with 116 underwriters, of which only about one quarter remain in operation 
in a similar line of business. Apple, Cisco, FedEx, Genentech, Starbucks, and 
many other firms are examples of small companies that raised growth capital 
outside of Regulation D via relatively small IPOs that helped them grow to 
become industry leaders.
By contrast, LinkedIn’s IPO (LNKD) in May 2011 raised $358M with only six 
underwriters. For a myriad of reasons which were covered in more detail in 
Chapter 1, the increased burdens of regulation and compliance have not only 
resulted in fewer IPOs in recent years but have also resulted in significantly 
higher barriers to accessing public capital. IPO options have effectively dried 
up for smaller companies.
Growth capital is the most critical ingredient that fuels the growth of any 
business. As America grew to economic preeminence in the 20th Century, 
many growing young firms pursued IPOs to access the additional capital they 
needed to further develop their products, hire additional employees, and pur-
sue international market opportunities. The ability to raise growth capital 
through IPOs allowed many promising companies to continue to produce 
new jobs and grow the U.S. economy, while all types of investors were able to 
enjoy the benefits of growing portfolios and retirement accounts.

The JOBS Act of 2012 has created a new kind of IPO that hearkens back to 
deals like Intel or Microsoft prior to when expense, regulation, and consolida-
tion among players in the public securities markets pushed public offerings bigger 
and bigger, forcing smaller issuers deeper into the private markets to raise 
capital. This chapter will explain the benefits and applications of Regulation 
A+ as developed in the JOBS Act along with suggestions for entrepreneurs on 
how to take advantage of this new legislation to raise growth capital.
History of Regulation A
Regulation A (“Reg A”) persisted in the same form continuously from 1934 
to June 2015 to facilitate public financing by small companies through issuing 
public securities that were exempt from registration under the Securities Act.
The maximum amount of an offering pursuant to Reg A has been increasing 
over time, as follows:
• 
$100,000 – 1935
• 
$300,000 – 1945
• 
$500,000 – 1970
• 
$1,500,000 – May 1978
• 
$2,000,000 – October 1978
• 
$5,000,000 – 1980
• 
$50,000,000 – June 2015
To date, Reg A offerings have not been widely used, in part because the previous 
maximum permitted offering amount of $5M was considered excessively low 
in light of the costly regulatory requirements at state and federal levels.
Regulation A+ Overview
Prior to revisions made by the JOBS Act, Reg A’s authority came from Section 3(b) 
of the Securities Act, which read:
The Commission may from time to time by its rules and regulations, 
and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed therein, 
add any class of securities to the securities exempted as provided in this 
section, if it finds that the enforcement of this title with respect to such 
securities is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of 
investors by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character 
of the public offering; but no issue of securities shall be exempted under 
this subsection where the aggregate amount at which such issue is offered 
to the public exceeds $5,000,000.

Regulation A+
33
Title IV of the JOBS Act revised Section 3(b) to now consist of a Section 3(b)(1)  
and a Section 3(b)(2), which reads as follows:
(b) Additional exemptions 
(1) Small issues exemptive authority
The Commission may from time to time by its rules and regulations, and 
subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed therein, add 
any class of securities to the securities exempted as provided in this section, 
if it finds that the enforcement of this subchapter with respect to such 
securities is not necessary in the public interest and for the protection of 
investors by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character 
of the public offering; but no issue of securities shall be exempted under 
this subsection where the aggregate amount at which such issue is offered 
to the public exceeds $5,000,000.
(2) Additional issues
The Commission shall by rule or regulation add a class of securities to 
the securities exempted pursuant to this section in accordance with the 
following terms and conditions: 
(A) The aggregate offering amount of all securities offered 
and sold within the prior 12-month period in reliance on 
the exemption added in accordance with this paragraph 
shall not exceed $50,000,000.
(B) The securities may be offered and sold publicly.
(C) The securities shall not be restricted securities within 
the meaning of the Federal securities laws and the regula-
tions promulgated thereunder.
(D) The civil liability provision in section 77l(a)(2) of this 
title shall apply to any person offering or selling such 
securities.
(E) The issuer may solicit interest in the offering prior to 
filing any offering statement, on such terms and conditions 
as the Commission may prescribe in the public interest or 
for the protection of investors.
(F) The Commission shall require the issuer to file audited 
financial statements with the Commission annually.
(G) Such other terms, conditions, or requirements as the 
Commission may determine necessary in the public interest 
and for the protection of investors, which may include—

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
34
(i) a requirement that the issuer prepare and elec-
tronically file with the Commission and distribute to 
prospective investors an offering statement, and any 
related documents, in such form and with such content 
as prescribed by the Commission, including audited 
financial statements, a description of the issuer’s busi-
ness operations, its financial condition, its corporate 
governance principles, its use of investor funds, and 
other appropriate matters; and
(ii) disqualification provisions under which the exemp-
tion shall not be available to the issuer or its prede-
cessors, affiliates, officers, directors, underwriters, or 
other related persons, which shall be substantially simi-
lar to the disqualification provisions contained in the 
regulations adopted in accordance with section 926 
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act.
The JOBS Act  hereby provides that the original exemption still exists but with 
a new variation allowing for a greater amount of capital to be raised with the 
same positive attributes of the original Regulation A (and with some more), 
albeit with additional requirements.
The SEC  has followed this same scheme in its rulemaking around Reg A+, cre-
ating two tiers of offerings under Reg A+. Tier 1 is the original Reg A and, for 
the most part, keeps the original regulatory scheme in place while increasing 
the amount to be raised there under to $20M. Tier 2 offerings are offerings 
made pursuant to Section 3(b)(2) for up to $50M, and they are where we find 
the vast bulk of changes to Reg A.
■
■Tip  It’s important to note that one does not need to offer more than $5M to take advantage of 
Tier 2, but you must follow the requirements of Tier 2 to use it.
The following sections discuss the major areas of consideration around Tier 
1 and Tier 2 offerings: how each works generally and why one may opt to 
conduct one or the other.
Limits on the Amount of Capital
Reg A+ now allows legal issuers to raise up to $20M in Tier 1 and up to 
$50M in Tier 2 offerings in any 12-month period. It is conceivable for more 
than $50M to be raised in a given 12-month period by using different legal 
issuers and structuring the offerings in such a manner so that the SEC does 

Regulation A+
35
not consider the offerings to be part of one common scheme of financing. For 
example, a real estate developer might need $50M each for multiple stand-alone 
development projects. The offering may be in the form of debt and or other 
flexible structures, e.g., it might provide dividends or other enhancements to 
attract various individual or institutional investors. Anyone considering such a 
course should seek the advice and assistance of experienced legal counsel.
In addition, $6M of the $20M under Tier 1 and up to $15M of the $50M under 
Tier 2 can be made up of securities of existing investors of an issuer. This 
provides an opportunity for owners of otherwise “restricted” securities not 
previously qualified under Reg A to be able to offer those securities for sale in 
the public market, thereby gaining the benefits of liquidity.
However, the SEC has further adopted a unique wrinkle to this rule. That 
being that secondary sales offered as part of an offering cannot exceed 30% 
of the aggregate offering price of the issuer’s first offering or any subsequent 
Regulation A+ offering qualified within one year of the issuer’s first offering. So, 
for example, if an issuer were to qualify $15,000,000 of new issuances in its 
first Regulation A+ offering, and then qualifies another $35,000,000 offering six 
months later, only $10,500,000 can be comprised of securities currently held 
by existing holders and offered for secondary sale through that offering. This 
does not apply to offerings 12 months after an issuer’s first Reg A+ offering.
Who Can Qualify?
Tier 1 is available for any entity that (i) is formed in the United States or a 
province of Canada, (ii) has its principal place of business in the United States 
or Canada, and (iii) is not subject to reporting obligations under certain sec-
tions of the Exchange Act immediately before the offering.
At the same time, the following issuers are ineligible to offer or sell securities 
under Reg A+:
• 
Any issuer that is a development stage company that 
either has no specific business plan or purpose, or has 
indicated that its business plan is to merge with an 
unidentified company or companies (known as a blank 
check company).
• 
Any investment company registered or required to be 
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
• 
Any entity issuing fractional undivided interests in oil or 
gas rights, or similar interests in other mineral rights.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
36
• 
Issuers subject to disqualification under Rule 262 of Reg 
A+ for specific items of improper conduct. An issuer that 
is registered or must register under the Exchange Act of 
1934 (“the ’34 Act”), or one that is no longer a ’34 Act-
registered company by virtue of misconduct within the 
last five years.
Tier 2 follows this scheme, but also denies qualification for securities of  
issuers who failed to meet ongoing reporting requirements associated with 
securities previously qualified.
What Is Rule 262?
Pursuant to Rule 262 of Regulation A, an issuer will not be eligible to use the 
Regulation A+ exemption if it, or any of its “covered persons,” are subject to 
one of several events of disqualification set forth in the rule at the time of 
initial filing. In addition to the issuer itself, an issuer’s covered persons are: 
• 
A predecessor of the issuer
• 
An affiliated issuer
• 
Any director, executive officer, other officer participating 
in the offering, general partner or managing member of 
the issuer
• 
Any beneficial owner of 20% or more of the issuer’s vot-
ing securities
• 
Any promoter connected with the issuer at the time of 
the filing of the offering statement, any offer after qualifi-
cation, or a sale
• 
Any person who has been or will be paid (directly or 
indirectly) remuneration for solicitation of purchasers in 
the offering (called a compensated solicitor)
• 
Any general partner or managing member of a compen-
sated solicitor or any director, executive officer or other 
officer participating in the offering of a compensated 
solicitor or any general partner or managing member of 
such compensated solicitor
The following are events of disqualification:
• 
Criminal conviction within 10 years prior to the filing 
date of the offering statement (or five years, in the case of 
issuers, their predecessors and affiliated issuers) that are 
(i) in connection with the purchase or sale of a security; 

Regulation A+
37
(ii) involve the making of any false filing with the SEC; or 
(iii) arise out of the conduct of the business of an under-
writer, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, invest-
ment adviser, or paid solicitor of purchasers of securities.
• 
Orders, judgments, or decrees of courts entered within 
five years before the filing of the offering statement that, at 
the time of the offering statement filing, restrain or enjoin 
the subject covered person from engaging or continuing 
to engage in any conduct or practice: (i) in connection 
with the purchase or sale of a security; (ii) involving the 
making of any false filing with the SEC; or (iii) arising out 
of the conduct of the business of an underwriter, broker, 
dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment adviser, or 
paid solicitor of purchasers of securities.
• 
Final orders of certain state regulators (such as state 
securities, banking, and insurance regulators) and certain 
federal regulators (such as federal banking agencies, the 
CFTC, or NCUA), if the order (A) at the time of filing 
bars the covered person from: (i) association with an 
entity regulated by the applicable state or federal regula-
tor; (ii) engaging in the business of securities, insurance, 
or banking; or (iii) engaging in savings association or credit 
union activities; or (B) is a final order based on violation 
of law or regulation prohibiting fraudulent, manipulative, or 
deceptive conduct entered within 10 years prior to filing.
• 
Certain SEC disciplinary orders relating to brokers, deal-
ers, municipal securities dealers, investment advisers, and 
investment companies and their associated persons to 
the extent such order is in effect at the time of filing.
• 
Cease and desist orders of the SEC to which the appli-
cable covered person is subject as of the filing and which 
were entered within five years before the filing for scien-
ter-based anti-fraud violations and Section 5 registration 
violations.
• 
Suspension or expulsion from, or suspension or barring 
from association with a member of a registered nation 
securities exchange or a registered national or affiliated 
securities association (such as FINRA), for any act or 
omission constituting conduct inconsistent with just and 
equitable principles of trade.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
38
• 
Has filed, or was named as an underwriter in, any reg-
istration statement or Regulation A+ offering statement 
filed with the SEC that, within five years prior to filing of 
the offering statement, was subject to a stop order or 
order suspending the Reg A+ exemption, or at the time 
of the filing is subject of an investigation to determine 
whether to issue such an order.
• 
Is subject to a USPS false representation order entered 
within five years prior to the filing date of the offering 
statement.
An issuer will not be subject to disqualification for such events that occurred 
prior to the effective date of the revised Regulation A rules. However, an issuer 
will be required to disclose in its offering circular any matter that was an event 
of disqualification but for its occurrence prior to the effective date of the rules.
Offering Communications
Restrictions on Reg A+ offering communications involve advertising, solici-
tation, analyst–investor relations, and the use of broker–dealers, as treated 
­successively in the sections below.
Advertising
Public advertising of securities qualified under Reg A+ may occur both during 
the filing process and after that process once the securities are qualified. 
Previously, the rules specified what written materials could be used once the 
initial filing with the SEC had been made. Under the new rules, that is not the 
case even permitting the use of “testing-the-waters” materials after the initial 
filing with the SEC.
“Testing the waters” is a concept that has been in Reg A for a long time. 
Essentially, the idea is that the issuer may feel out the market’s interest in an 
offering prior to incurring the expense and scrutiny of filing with the SEC 
through diverse media; for example, by engaging in a broad-based marketing 
campaign, using written materials, online content, or radio/TV to solicit indica-
tions of interest in an offering an issuer was considering conducting.
The issuer can even have a means of identifying potential investors and obtaining 
their contact information so that they could be approached directly to invest 
once the offering was being conducted. Issuers had broad latitude as to what 
could be included in those materials, provided that they were not misrepresen-
tative or untruthful, but they must stop using them once an initial filing for a Reg 
A+ offering has been made with the SEC. From there on, issuers are very limited 
in what written material (including recordings of seminars that could be easily 
accessed) could contain during the pendency of the filing.

Regulation A+
39
Under the new rules, same materials can continue to be used, provided there 
is a preliminary offering circular or notice as to where to find the latest 
version of the offering circular on the SEC’s EDGAR system.1Hence, there 
are more flexible marketing options before filing than before the JOBS Act. 
The investment limit will not apply to accredited investors. In addition, both 
accredited and non-accredited investors are exempt from the investment cap 
if the subject securities of the offering are listed on a “National Exchange” as 
defined in the Exchange Act of 1934 (see the section, “The Backdoor IPO”).
■
■Note  While the SEC’s new rules liberalize the use of advertising materials, Tier 1 securities are 
not exempted from state blue sky laws (discussed below). One should carefully consider the interplay 
of State and Federal law with experienced legal counsel.
Who Can an Issuer Solicit to Invest, and  
Who Can Invest?
Generally, Reg A+ does not impose investor qualification standards, as in 
Regulation D. An issuer can solicit anybody and can take anyone as an investor. 
However, in Tier 2 offerings, non-accredited natural persons are subject to the 
investment limit in an initial issuance of not more than 10% of the greater of 
the investor’s annual income and net worth, determined as provided in Rule 501 
of Regulation D. As an example, an individual with $100,000 in annual income 
cannot invest more than $10,000 in a single Reg A+ offering.
Isolation of Analysts from Investors
In the more traditional public securities offerings, there are strict limitations 
on the sharing of information between the advisory function of an investment 
firm and its brokering or selling arm—the so-called “Chinese Wall.” This is to 
prevent the sharing of insider information that could influence improper trad-
ing of the issuer’s shares.
This prohibition is not applicable to Reg A+ and information can be shared 
freely but must be factual and not resulting in fraudulent misrepresentation.
1That said, if you’re using a broker-dealer (BD) to place your securities, they may be subject 
to certain FINRA rules that govern how they use certain materials or what can be in them. 
Always coordinate your marketing efforts with your BD!

Use of Broker–Dealers
Many registered broker–dealers are expressing strong interest in raising funds 
for Reg A+ offerings due to lower regulatory concerns by FINRA and the 
lower errors and omissions (E&O) liability insurance costs associated with Reg 
A+ offerings relative to the more traditional Regulation D offerings.
Liquidity
As discussed, Reg A+ may be used by an issuer to conduct a primary offer-
ing of its securities with the proceeds to be used by the issuer, as well as 
to conduct a secondary offering of securities on behalf of selling security 
holders. The Tier 1 offering limits the amount to $6M offered by all selling 
security holders. The SEC has increased this amount for Tier 2 offerings to  
$15M. In short, 30% of the maximum value an issuer can offer to the public  
in securities under Reg A+ in a 12-month period can be made up of the 
securities of existing securities holders, and they can be offered on a con-
tinuous basis. But this cannot exceed 30% of the aggregate offering price of 
the issuer’s first offering or any subsequent Regulation A+ offering qualified 
within one year of the issuer’s first offering. So, for example, if an issuer were 
to qualify $15,000,000 of new issuances in its first Regulation A+ offering, 
and then qualifies another $35,000,000 offering six months thereafter, only 
$10,500,000 can be comprised of securities currently held by existing hold-
ers and offered for secondary sale through that offering. This does not apply 
to offerings made 12 months after an issuer’s first Reg A+ offering.
SEC has also made the review of an issuer’s mandatory ongoing reporting 
be sufficient to satisfy a broker-dealer’s obligations under Exchange Act Rule 
15c2-11 to review information about an issuer in connection with publishing 
quotations on any facility other than a national securities exchange. Huh? In 
other words, if a BD has the up-to-date reporting of a Tier 2 issuer, it can 
provide a public price quote on the security. This is crucial for trading these 
securities until established exchanges or alternative trading systems develop 
for Reg A+ securities. How else would they trade without some way to establish 
a price in the market?
The SEC has also suggested that the reporting associated with Tier 2 Reg A+ 
securities could meet the requirements for public information under Rule 144. 
As such, if an issuer were to qualify a class of equity securities and comply 
with requisite reporting for the same (discussed below), then any restricted 
securities otherwise complying with Rule 144 may be traded in the secondary 
market.

Regulation A+
41
However, while the SEC opted to pre-empt state securities registration 
requirements for the initial issuance of securities, the SEC did not pre-empt 
state regulation of secondary activity associated with Regulation A+ securi-
ties. This means that someone seeking to sell their securities might have to 
register the securities in that state prior to sale, unless an exemption applies. 
Most states carry a number of exemptions, including those for trades not for 
the benefit of the issuer or that do not comprise arbitrage activity. So, the 
secondary market likely will develop first as a means for retail investors to 
reliably move in and out of positions they have held truly for investment. If fur-
ther pre-emption of state securities develops, which is activity being discussed 
presently, the more institutional style investment, taking advantage of market 
forces, could develop.
Circular
Reg A+ securities are offered to investors through the offering circular, and the 
template for offerings circulars is Form 1-A. The new rules retain Form 1-A’s  
existing structure, but make various revisions to the form. For Tier 2 offerings, 
Form 1-A is enhanced and requires disclosures of basic information about the 
issuer; material risks; use of proceeds; an overview of the issuer’s business;  
an MD&A-type discussion; disclosures about executive officers and directors 
and compensation; beneficial ownership information; related party transactions; 
a description of the offered securities; and two years of financial statements. 
The disclosure requirements continue to be scaled as compared to registra-
tion under the Securities Act.
For Tier 1 offerings, audited financial statements are required only to the 
extent they were prepared for other Federal law purposes, but are generally 
required for state law compliance. For Tier 2 offerings, audited financial state-
ments are required. For Tier 1 and Tier 2 offerings, the auditors of financial 
statements must meet the independence standards but need not be PCAOB-
registered. For Tier 2 offerings, financial statements must be audited in accor-
dance with PCAOB standards.
The proposed rule requires offering statements to be submitted and available 
through the SEC’s EDGAR system. An issuer or broker-dealer is required to 
deliver only a preliminary offering circular to prospective purchasers at least 
48 hours in advance of sale when a preliminary offering circular is used to 
offer securities. A final offering circular is required to accompany or precede 
any written communications that constitute an offer in the post-qualification 
period. In instances where delivery of a final offering circular is required, in 
lieu of mailing a paper copy of the final offering circular to the investor, an 
issuer may instead provide the investor with a notice, including the URL 
where the final offering circular, or the offering statement of which it is a part, 
may be viewed.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
42
The proposed rule permits confidential submission of offering statements 
for first-time offerings under Reg A+. The initial confidential submission and 
subsequent confidential amendments and SEC correspondence regarding the  
submissions are required to be publicly filed as exhibits to the offering statement 
not less than 21 calendar days before qualification of the offering statement.
Ongoing Reporting Requirements
Tier 1 issuers will be required to provide certain information about their 
Regulation A+ offering on a new form, Form 1-Z.
Issuers in Tier 2 offerings are subject to an ongoing reporting regime.
Tier 2 issuers will be subject to an ongoing reporting regime and require:
• 
Annual reports on Form 1-K
• 
Semi-annual reports on Form 1-SA
• 
Current reports on Form 1-U
• 
Special financial reports on Form 1-K and Form 1-SA
• 
Exit reports on Form 1-Z
Form 1-K is required to be filed within 120 calendar days of the issuer’s fiscal 
year-end and requires these disclosures:
• 
The issuer’s business and operations for the preceding 
three fiscal years (or since inception if it’s been in exis-
tence for less than three years)
• 
Related party transactions
• 
Beneficial ownership
• 
Executive officers and directors
• 
Executive compensation
• 
MD&A
• 
Two years of audited financial statements
The semi-annual report is required to be filed within 90 days after the end 
of the first six months of the issuer’s fiscal year and is similar to Form 10-Q, 
although it is subject to scaled disclosure requirements.

Regulation A+
43
A current report on Form 1-U must be filed within four business days of the 
triggering event and is required to announce:
• 
Fundamental changes in the issuer’s business
• 
Entry into bankruptcy or receivership proceedings
• 
Material modifications to the rights of security holders
• 
Changes in accountants
• 
Non-reliance on audited financial statements
• 
Changes in control and changes in key executive officers
• 
Sales of 10% or more of outstanding equity securities in 
exempt offerings
The structure of these reporting requirements is intended to be somewhat 
analogous to the reporting scheme under the Exchange Act, but less burden-
some from a substantive perspective.
State Blue Sky Laws
Many people don’t realize that, in addition to the securities laws at the Federal 
level, each state has its own set of securities laws, commonly referred to as 
Blue Sky laws. Unless Federal law or regulation establishes that a security or 
manner of offering is exempt from requirements under state laws—a concept 
known as preemption—then an issuer must also comply with the registration 
requirements of the states in which it intends to sell.
Prior to the JOBS Act, under Reg A an issuer was required to register, or find 
an exemption under that state’s law, in each state in which it intended to sell 
its securities. This requirement was viewed by many as a serious flaw of Reg 
A and contributed to its lack of popularity.
Title IV of the JOBS Act provides that offerings conducted under Section 3(b)(2)  
be treated as “covered securities,” and not subject to state Blue Sky registra-
tion or review, if the securities are sold to “qualified purchasers” or listed on 
a national securities exchange. In the guidelines, the SEC has defined “qualified 
purchaser” to include all offerees and purchasers in a Tier 2 offering. The final 
rules eliminate the offeree in Tier 1 offerings from the qualified purchaser defi-
nition. As such, the entirety of the Tier 1 offering process will remain subject 
to state securities law registration and merit review requirements.
Consistent with the proposed rules, however, Tier 2 offerings will not be sub-
ject to state registration requirements or merit review. States will, of course, 
continue to have authority to require notice filing of offering materials and 
enforce antifraud provisions in connection with a Tier 2 offering.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
44
As discussed above, unless the firm chooses to not have its shares trade on 
a national exchange such as NASDAQ, NYSE, or AMEX and instead opts for 
trading on an OTC exchange, state law can still apply to secondary trading 
which may impact the volume of trade activity.
■
■Tip  The removal of the requirement to comply with state Blue Sky regulations for Tier 2 
eliminates one the chief obstacles to utilizing Regulation A+.
A point of particular focus by both the private securities bar and regulators in 
developing the rules for Reg A+ was the application of Section 12(g) of the Act 
to Regulation A+ securities. Section 12(g) provides a “fail-safe” for when issu-
ers must submit to registering and reporting under the 34 Act upon achieving 
a certain size. Reporting under the 34 Act is the typical on-going reporting 
that public companies do. It is expensive and laborious, and implicates further 
regulations under SOX and Dodd-Frank. Under Section 12(g) an issuer with 
(i) $10,000,000 in assets and (ii) 2,000 “shareholders of record,” 500 of which 
may be non-accredited in a given class of equity securities, must register and 
report under the Exchange Act.
While the JOBS Act did not exempt Reg A+ from Section 12(g), the SEC has 
provided a further specific exemption for securities issued in Tier 2 offerings 
from the Section 12(g), if an issuer2:
• 
Retains the services of a transfer agent registered under 
Section 17 of the Exchange Act
• 
Has a public float of less than $75M or, in the absence of 
a float, revenues of less than $50M in the most recently 
completed fiscal year
• 
Is current in its periodic reporting obligations
At the same time, an issuer that exceeds the Section 12(g) threshold and this 
exemption standard will still have a two-year transition period in order to reg-
ister under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and can do so as an “emerging 
growth company” if they still meet the definition.
2We have discussed here only the exemption set forth in the rules for Reg A+. An issuer can 
structure its offering to be in a “streetname”, which can also allow one to avoid Section 12(g).

Regulation A+

The “Backdoor” IPO
The final rules facilitate the ability of a Tier 2 issuer to list a class of Regulation 
A+ securities on a national securities exchange. The final rule permits a Tier 2 
issuer that has provided disclosure in Part II of Form 1-A that follows Part 1 
of Form S-1 or Form S-11 to file a Form 8-A to list its securities on a national 
securities exchange. Thereafter, the issuer is subject to Exchange Act report-
ing requirements, but is considered an emerging growth company.
How Regulation A+ Compares to Other 
Fundraising Options
Since the passage of the JOBS Act, discussion of Reg A+ has been largely 
overshadowed by other provisions of the act that relate to new rules regard-
ing crowdfunding, public solicitation of investors, and less burdensome ways 
to go public via election as an EGC. All of these new JOBS Act fundraising 
provisions are also less understood than fundraising via a Regulation D private 
placement or via a traditional IPO.
Since these topics overlap with each other and also with Reg A+, there is cur-
rently much confusion even among attorneys, financial advisors, accountants, 
and others as to how these various provisions compare and contrast with 
each other. We conclude this chapter with a summary of each of these provi-
sions and how they compare to Reg A+.
How Does Regulation A+ Compare to Regulation D?
The traditional exemption for raising capital for growth companies has been and 
continues to be Regulation D (“Reg D”). This regulation follows the Securities 
Act of 1933 under Rules 504, 505, and 506. This is by far the most commonly 
used mechanism for raising capital by private companies from seed stage to late 
stage. Almost $800–900B (billion) is raised per year in 15,000–20,000 offerings 
for a wide variety of private businesses in the United States. This far exceeds 
the capital raised in the 200-400 public offerings that occur per year.
Reg D contains the rules providing exemptions from the registration require-
ments, allowing issuers to offer and sell securities without having to register 
with the SEC. A Reg D offering is intended to make access to the capital 
markets possible for small companies that could not otherwise bear the costs 
of a normal SEC registration. While this may be the lowest cost mechanism 
to raise capital and avoids delays caused by a formal registration process,  
Reg D has many very serious problems both for the issuers and the investors. 
Reg A+ solves all those problems very effectively. The following sections sum-
marize the downsides of a Reg D offering.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
46
Lack of Liquidity
In contrast to Reg A+, which allows an immediate option for liquidity for 
investors if desired, one of biggest weaknesses of Reg D offerings is their lack 
of liquidity. These securities are private and there are very limited means for 
owners or investors to sell or exchange their investment until the company 
exits in an IPO or is acquired by another company in exchange for liquid con-
sideration such as cash or stock in a public company. If the Reg D offering is 
for an investment in a project having a finite life—such as a real estate devel-
opment, a movie, or an oil well—investment funds are largely frozen until the 
project produces profit distributions or is sold.
This liquidity problem has been especially challenging for many private compa-
nies ranging from startups to late-stage firms because such companies may not 
realize an acceptable liquidity event, such as an IPO or M&A, for 5 to 10 years 
or even longer. Furthermore, the SEC has strict requirements that discourage 
private sales of Reg D ownership interests, resulting often in steep discounts 
to fair-market value by investors who need to exit from their investments. Last, 
this lack of liquidity impacts the ability of firms to attract top talent because 
they are often unable to offer competitive stock option incentives due to a 
perception that their private stock has little actual value.
Accredited Investors Only
Reg D offerings can only be made to high-net-worth accredited investors or 
to qualified institutions per SEC rules without triggering laborious require-
ments that limit its efficacy or the amount one can raise. Minimum qualifying 
criteria require investors to have $1M in assets excluding their home and 
$200,000 of annual income for the past two years plus the current year or 
$300,000 including spouse. This is justified by the SEC to mitigate risky invest-
ments to small investors. This is a hugely limiting factor both for investors 
who have to disclose their financial details to qualify and also for issuers to 
document and ensure that investors are actually qualified. Reg A+ allows non-
accredited retail individual investors with the only limitation being that the 
size of investment they can make per project may be limited by their income 
or net worth, Reg A+ also allows non-accredited investors to self-verify their 
income and net worth.
There is no limit to the amount that can be invested in a Tier I offering, while 
Tier II has limits tied to income and net worth. Unlike Reg D, where the issuer 
has to make reasonably sure they have an accredited investor buying the secu-
rity, investors are now in charge of confirming their ability to qualify to make 
investments.

Regulation A+
47
In a Tier II offering that will not be listed on a national exchange, a non-
accredited investor is limited to investing the greater of 10% of their annual 
income or 10% of their net worth, excluding their principal residence. That's 
a per-offering limit, not a per-investor limit. So a policeman making $65,000 
per year with a net worth of $250,000 can invest $25,000 in a local real estate 
project and another $25,000 in a new technology company that makes sur-
veillance products.
Small Pool of Investors
The total pool of U.S. investors who can potentially invest in Regulation D 
offerings is estimated to be only 4 to 6M accredited investors plus a limited 
number of qualified institutions and large funds. By contrast, Reg A+ offerings 
can be offered to a pool of non-accredited investors numbering as many as 
100M or more.
Limited Disclosures and Reporting
Due to Regulation D exemption provisions, the SEC has no specific guidelines 
for issuers outlining required minimum disclosures in the Private Placement 
Memorandums (PPMs) that accompany Regulation D offerings. Most PPM 
disclosures are inconsistent and tend to list a lot of risk factors that limit 
investors’ ability to sell or ensure adequate performance by the issuer. No 
reporting requirements are mandated (See “Various Reg D Offerings”) typi-
cally by Federal and state securities laws, which often leads to investors being 
the last to know about impending problems in the company and not having 
the ability to impact any change. In contrast, Reg A+ requires quarterly report-
ing and annual audited results to be made public to help investors understand 
the status and ongoing performance of their investment.
Control Issues among Investors/Management
Absence of specific SEC requirements, Reg D-funded private companies 
and projects usually struggle in establishing an appropriate balance between 
the role of company managers and investors. Balancing these roles can 
become complicated, leading to the failure of many investments due to dis-
putes between investors and insiders. For example, in the case of VC-funded 
technology firms, VCs typically have a mandate to control the board of the 
company and management is often constrained to operate the firm in an 
optimum manner.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
48
The most common disputed issue usually is timing to sell or liquidate the 
investment to provide liquidity to investors. Company management and 
employees are usually minor investors and draw ongoing salaries and bonuses 
and control the company with little participation by investors. Therefore, they 
do not want to lose control in case of a sale and they aren’t incentivized to 
expedite liquidity.
Cash Calls and Wash-Outs
Since Reg D-funded companies have private status and are not allowed to 
raise additional capital through public offerings until there’s an IPO, they typi-
cally end up raising more capital from their existing accredited investors or 
through new investors. Most companies do not perform according to the 
projected business plan. They are either doing better or worse or have short-
term capital needs due to market conditions that are never predictable. 
As a result, if company needs additional capital in a distress situation, they 
require existing investors to invest more capital to maintain their ownership 
position regardless if they want to or not (often called “pay to play”). For 
those investors who decide not to invest sufficient additional funds based on 
their pro-rata ownership amount, they end up losing some or most of their 
original investment in what is commonly called a “wash-out.” This is one of the 
major deterrents to investing in Reg D placements.
Fundraising
Although the SEC does not impose many restrictions on Reg D offerings in 
terms of disclosures or reporting, the fundraising process is highly regulated 
and restrictive, which makes it expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, 
due to added regulations and oversight imposed after the 2008 crash, many 
broker-dealers who formerly raised capital for Reg D offerings can no longer 
afford the increased insurance premiums and larger personal liability risk of 
failed Reg D offerings and have been discouraged from raising capital by such 
offerings. 
Bad Boy Disqualification
Regulation D has an almost identical disqualification rule to Rule 262 under 
Reg A+. However, while in Reg A+ where disqualification only occurs if a dis-
qualifying event exists at the time of filing your Reg A+ with the SEC, a dis-
qualifying event that occurs any time while a Reg D offering is being conducted 
can invalidate the offering. This can create a lot of regulatory uncertainty if 
you are conducting a Reg D to a broad audience or for an extended time. 

Regulation A+
49
Cost of Fundraising
Although the cost of Reg D offerings may sometimes appear to be lower than 
Reg A+, if all the factors are taken in account, they are usually much higher. 
The following are the major cost components:
Legal and organization costs. Depending on the size and complexity of the 
offering, these can range from $25,000 to $100,000.
Marketing costs. Depending on the fundraising channel, these can range from 
$25,000 to $100,000.
Due-diligence cost. Third-party experts can range from $10,000 to $25,000.
Placements fees. These fees charged by brokers range from 5% to 10% of the 
amount of capital raised.
Cost of equity lost. This is by far the largest hidden cost of Reg D offerings 
and is usually ignored by the issuers. Because Reg D investments are not liq-
uid and can take many years to exit, investors require higher premiums in the 
form of offering much lower valuation for the companies or opportunities 
where they perceive that their capital may be tied up for extended periods. 
For example, the valuation of a liquid public company is typical two times 
higher than that of a similar private company.3 This means the founders and 
managers of the Reg D companies can lose a lot more of their ownership 
interest compared to a Reg A+ placement. This has greater liquidity.

Note the very steep increase in required returns when time to exit is pushed 
out. By contrast, Reg A+ shares can be immediately tradable and liquid—subject 
to demand for the stock, access to an exchange, and other important factors.4
Miscellaneous Drawbacks
There are several important considerations that impact Reg D offerings nega-
tively due to higher cost and restrictions that can delay the offering:
• 
The “prior relation test” requires that if outside broker 
help is sought for fundraising, the broker agent must have 
a prior relationship with the potential investors for mini-
mum of 30 days or more and cannot solicit investment in 
a new offering.
• 
No public advertising is allowed to the general public on 
the Internet, radio, or print media. An option provided in 
the JOBS Act allows public solicitation if the issuer chooses 
to use this option, but this requires a lot more scrutiny and 
written verification of investor communications and their 
financial records, which many investors prefer not to share, 
thereby making this option not very practical.
• 
PPM distribution and investor records must be main-
tained by the issuer.
• 
Financial records of the investors must be kept and main-
tained by the brokers.
• 
A due diligence report from a third party is typically 
required by the brokers, which can take 4-6 weeks, plus 
significant cost. This also poses risks for brokers and issu-
ers if not done properly, because it provides guidance to 
investors regarding valuation and risks in the offering.
Various Types of Reg D Offerings
There are three options within the Reg D offerings. These provide different 
offerings limits and restrictions rules issuers have to follow.
4This is not to say that Regulation A+ shares are inherently more liquid than Regulation D. 
In fact, if the Regulation A+ shares do not have a market or little-to-no demand by external 
investors, there may not be any liquidity advantage. The key point is that through electing 
to use Regulation A+, the issuer will at least have the option to create early liquidity for 
their shares, whereas with Regulation D such an option does not exist.

Regulation A+
51
Rule 504
Rule 504 provides an exemption for the offer and sale of up to $1,000,000 of 
securities in a 12-month period. The company may use this exemption so long 
as it is not a blank-check company and is not subject to the Exchange Act of 
1934 reporting requirements. 
Rule 504 allows companies to generally solicit and sell securities that are not 
restricted if one of the following conditions is met:
• 
The offering is made exclusively in one or more states 
that provide for registration of the securities under state 
law and require a delivery of a substantive disclosure doc-
ument to investors.
• 
The registration and sale takes place in a state that 
requires registration and disclosure delivery, and the 
buyer is in a state without those requirements, so long as 
the disclosure documents mandated by the state in which 
you registered to all purchasers are delivered.
• 
The securities are sold exclusively according to state law 
exemptions that permit general solicitation and adver-
tising, and you are selling only to accredited investors. 
However, accredited investors are only needed when 
sold exclusively with state law exemptions on solicitation.
Rule 505
Rule 505 provides an exemption for offers and sales of securities totaling up 
to $5M in any 12-month period. Under this exemption, securities may be sold 
to an unlimited number of “accredited investors” and up to 35 “unaccredited 
investors” who do not need to satisfy the sophistication or wealth standards 
associated with other exemptions. Purchasers must buy for investment only, 
and not for resale. The issued securities are restricted. General solicitation or 
advertising to sell the securities is not allowed.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
52
Rule 505 offerings have strict requirements as to the form of disclosure and 
how financial statements are presented. Financial statement requirements 
applicable to this type of offering:
• 
Financial statements need to be certified by an indepen-
dent public accountant.
• 
If a company other than a limited partnership cannot 
obtain audited financial statements without unreason-
able effort or expense, the company’s balance sheet, to 
be dated within 120 days of the start of the offering, must 
be audited.
• 
Limited partnerships unable to obtain required financial 
statements without unreasonable effort or expense may 
furnish audited financial statements prepared under the 
federal income tax laws.
Rule 506
A company may qualify for an exemption under Rule 506 if it satisfies the  
following standards:
• 
It can raise an unlimited amount of capital.
• 
It does not use general solicitation or advertising to market 
the securities.
• 
It sells securities to an unlimited number of accred-
ited investors and up to 35 non-accredited investors. 
However, if offered to non-accredited investors, certain 
rules under 505 shall apply.
• 
The seller is available to answer questions by prospective 
purchasers.
• 
The purchasers receive restricted securities, which may 
not be freely traded in the secondary market after the 
offering.
In August 2012, the SEC issued new proposed regulations as required by the 
2012 JOBS Act. These regulations add Rule 506(c) to allow general advertising 
and solicitation, effectively relaxing the prohibition on advertising in private 
placement offerings, but only for qualifying 506 private offerings made exclu-
sively to accredited investors. It also places heightened verification require-
ments on determining whether or not an investor is accredited. If those 
standards are not met, the issuer could be forced to return funds and/or 
register the securities under the Securities Act.

Regulation A+
53
Crowdfunding versus Regulation A+
Almost all the initial discussions in the public press regarding the implica-
tions of the new JOBS Act legislation focused on crowdfunding. Since the 
passage of the JOBS Act in 2012, crowdfunding advocates continue to publish 
far more content on a daily basis on the Internet than other JOBS Act-related 
provisions. While the promise of crowdfunding is clearly very attractive to 
many entrepreneurs, we believe that the current form of crowdfunding con-
templated by the JOBS Act, but not yet implemented by the SEC, will fall far 
short of realizing the hoped-for objectives. Furthermore, we think that Reg 
A+ provides a number of benefits that will be embraced by many of today’s 
fans of crowdfunding.
Crowdfunding has become a popular term recently due to the perception 
that any entrepreneur can potentially raise capital from the public at very 
low cost for any project over the Internet. One of the major reasons this 
is becoming very popular—and rightly so—is the fact that a large number 
of potential investors can be approached in a very short period and cost 
effectively, and they can invest small amounts of money individually to pool a 
significantly larger overall amount.
Although the term crowdfunding has come to be associated with any fundrais-
ing over the Internet, it has only been defined specifically for the first time in 
Title III of the JOBS Act.
■
■Caution  Crowdfunding permitted by the JOBS Act has many more limitations than commonly 
perceived. Although the JOBS Act provides guidelines for public solicitation of investors, the rules 
and limitations for the various fundraising methods are quite different. The next section surveys and 
tabulates the strengths and limitations of each application in comparison to Reg A+.
The current and potential uses of all crowdfunding/Internet funding can be 
broadly broken into the following four categories.
Crowdfunding to Raise Capital as Donations
The most successful model in the category of crowdfunding to raise capital 
as donations has been Kickstarter—which was formed in 2009, long before 
the JOBS Act. Kickstarter is arguably the most successful means of Internet 
fundraising to date, helping thousands of entrepreneurs raise small amounts 
of capital to pursue their small projects and hobbies.
Kickstarter’s platform allows individuals to contribute funds for a particular 
project related to something they like in return for a gift or a reward, or for 
prepayment of a product to be delivered at a future date in exchange for their 

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
54
contribution. Contributors cannot accept equity in the company or share 
profits from their investment.
The contributions may be typically as little as $5 to $5,000 per person and 
the total amounts raised typically range from $1,000 to $1,000,000. These 
funds are typically used to either pursue a personal hobby or create a proof 
of concept that is generally exciting to the general public at large.
In some cases, some entrepreneurs planning to launch legitimate compa-
nies have been able to successfully raise seed funding through Kickstarter to 
develop an initial proof of concept of their product.
Aside from limited use to raise seed funding, this donation model has not 
allowed serious entrepreneurs to raise significant equity or improve their abil-
ity to pursue scalable projects or raise adequate amounts of capital to attract 
serious investors who invest with profit sharing motives.
Use of Crowdfunding up to $1M for Small Companies 
under Title III of the JOBS Act
The purpose of Title III of the JOBS Act is to encourage small businesses to 
raise small amounts of seed funding for new product ideas. Its provisions 
include the following:
• 
A company can raise up to a maximum of $1M/year.
• 
This offering is exempt from both the SEC and state 
approval process.
• 
Both accredited and non-accredited investors may invest.
• 
Investors with less than $100,000 income per year shall 
be allowed to invest a maximum $5,000 but not greater 
than 5% of their annual income in each investment.
• 
Investors with income higher than $100,000 per year 
may invest a maximum of $10,000 or 10% of their annual 
income.
• 
Funds may be raised only through a FINRA-approved 
licensed BD-managed platform. Any other efforts shall 
be scrutinized very closely and may to lead to fines and 
penalties for platform principals.
• 
Offerings over $100,000 require a third-party audit.

Regulation A+
55
• 
Shares sold are restricted for 12 months and thereafter 
will still remain illiquid absent a sale of the company or an 
SEC registration.
• 
There will be significant ongoing reporting requirements 
to the SEC regarding the offering and specifically regard-
ing the investors in it.
Crowdfunding under Title III may seem like a good way to raise capital for 
seed funding but is riddled with many problems. Some of the problematic 
issues include the high cost and time it takes for evaluation and due diligence 
required by licensed BDs to underwrite any deal. Secondly, use of the Internet 
to solicit investors can be illegal and subject to harsh penalties. The web 
portals are allowed for investor information only and a full PPM is required 
to be reviewed by each investor to be able to invest. Licensed BDs also must 
qualify each investor and verify their financials. Finally, due to limitations on the 
amounts each investor may invest, each deal will require too many investors 
to raise any critical amount of funds above $600,000 to $800,000.
Use of Crowdfunding for Regulation D under Title II of the 
JOBS Act
Under Title II, Regulation D has been modified by including Rule 506(c), 
which allows:
• 
A company to solicit accredited investors using social 
media, radio, Internet, and traditional advertising.
• 
No limit on the amount of investment by each investor.
• 
No limit on the amount of total funds raised per project.
• 
Exemption from pre-approval or registration with the 
SEC or states, although limited reporting is required.
• 
No requirement to involve FINRA-approved BDs.
• 
If funds are raised without involvement of a BD, investors’ 
accreditation details must be maintained.
While many features of Rule 506(c) seem attractive compared to Title III, 
the Title II provisions also have issues with the high minimum costs of raising 
smaller amounts of funds and the responsibility to verify and maintain investor 
financial records, which are not required for the normal Regulation D process 
without application of Rule 506(c). For example, if general solicitation is not 
used, investors simply need to certify their income without providing actual 
tax returns or proof of income, including bank statements in some cases. 
However, the Rule 506(c) option may be suitable and better for raising seed 
capital than crowdfunding under Title III.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
56
Potential Use of Crowdfunding for Regulation A+ Under 
Title IV of the JOBS Act
The key features of Reg A+ pertinent to public solicitation/crowdfunding are 
the following:
• 
A company may solicit accredited or non-accredited 
investors using social media, radio, Internet, and tradi-
tional advertising (i.e., no investor financials required).
• 
Smaller amounts can be taken from a larger number of 
investors without fear of trigging 34 Act reporting.
• 
Allows up to $50M total funds raised per project per year.
• 
Pre-approval required from SEC (unlike Regulation D), 
but with available exemptions from states Blue Sky laws. 
Testing of waters is allowed before registration as long as 
no funds are accepted.
• 
Requires annual audited financials to be submitted to the 
SEC. However, limited reporting is required compared to 
any other public company.
• 
It has no requirement to involve FINRA-approved BDs 
(optional).
• 
Securities are tradable immediately, providing liquidity to 
investors and owners (subject to the existence and sup-
port of a secondary market in the stock).
• 
Securities may be offered as private or publicly tradable 
on alternative trading systems (ATSs) managed by BDs, 
OTC markets, and so on.
In comparison, Reg A+ solves many of the issues related to other alternatives 
for the use of crowdfunding. Companies can raise capital from the general public 
by any means of public solicitation—Internet, social media, radio, TV, or other 
means of advertising. Limits on the amount of capital and contribution by each 
investor are a lot more reasonable and meaningful. When you take full advan-
tage of expenses relative to the amount of capital raised or benefits of liquidity, 
Reg A+ is clearly a much more powerful option for raising capital by use of 
crowdfunding.
■
■Tip  Crowdfunding via Regulation A+ overcomes many of the existing crowdfunding limitations. 
Under Reg A+, a crowdfunding campaign can target non-accredited investors, use public advertising, 
and may not require involvement of broker-dealers.

How Regulation A+ Compares to Going Public as an 
Emerging Growth Company
As noted in the “State Blue Sky Laws” section, Title I of the JOBS Act intro-
duced a new category of small companies called EGCs and granted firms that 
elected this classification several important exemptions from regulations that 
govern public companies.5 To take advantage of these exemptions, a firm must 
have total annual gross revenues under $1B for the most recently ended fiscal 
year per standard accounting principles. Furthermore, the firm’s initial sale of 
common equity securities must have occurred after December 8, 2011.
In general, the goal of this provision is to provide incentives in the form 
of reduced reporting requirements to encourage more qualifying firms to 
launch a traditional IPO and be listed on a national stock exchange such as 
NASDAQ or NYSE.
Table 3-2 is a quick comparison of the requirements for an EGC vs. an IPO.

general.htm.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
58
Additional provisions that pertain to EGC exemptions include the following:
• 
Draft IPO registration submissions. An EGC may confi-
dentially submit a draft of its registration statement to 
the SEC for review prior to officially filing with the SEC 
(provided that the confidential submission and amend-
ments thereto must be publicly filed with the SEC no 
later than 21 days prior to commencement of the EGC’s 
road show). Reg A+ now has a similar provision.
• 
Testing the waters. In connection with a securities offer-
ing, an EGC may, either before or after filing a registra-
tion statement with respect to the offering, engage in oral 
or written communications with potential investors, but 
only those that are qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) or 
accredited investors.
• 
Analyst reports. BDs are allowed to publish or distribute a 
research report regarding the securities of an EGC.
• 
Auditor rotation. Any existing or future rules of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring manda-
tory audit firm rotation or auditor discussion and analysis 
will not apply to an audit of an EGC.
• 
Say on pay. An EGC will not be required to conduct the 
shareholder vote on executive compensation mandated 
under the Dodd-Frank Act until, at a minimum, three 
years after the first sale of the EGC’s common equity in 
a registered offering.
In addition, neither the SEC nor any national securities association may enact 
rules or regulations that restrict the following roles:
• 
A broker-dealer or member of a national securities 
association from publishing or distributing any research 
report or making a public appearance with respect to 
the securities of an EGC during the post-IPO or other 
agreed upon lock-up period.
• 
Which associates of a broker-dealer or national securities 
association may arrange for communications between a 
securities analyst and a potential investor.
• 
A securities analyst from participating in communications 
with an EGC’s management team if such communica-
tion is also attended by associates of a broker-dealer or 
national securities association member in a role other 
than securities analyst.

Regulation A+
59
Use of EGC Provisions by Issuers
Since the passage of the JOBS Act in April 2012, there has been a significant 
increase in IPOs. More IPOs were done in 2013 than in any year since 2000 
and it has been reported that 81% of the 222 companies that went public 
utilized at least some of the EGC provisions of the JOBS Act.6
Cost Comparisons of Various Options
An IPO has the following cost components:
• 
Accounting fees
• 
Legal fees
• 
Professional advisor fees
• 
Filing fees
• 
Financing or placement fees
• 
Exchange fees
• 
Management meetings, conference calls, roadshows, and 
related marketing expenses
Accounting fees, legal fees, professional adviser, and filing fees are largely 
dependent on the size and complexity of each transaction. Generally, IPO fees 
will range from several hundred thousand dollars to much more than a million 
dollars. Financing or placement fees, as these are called, are charged based on 
the amount of funding raised by the investment banking firm.
Table 3-3 compares a comprehensive list of costs of going public via the three 
available options—traditional IPO, qualified EGC, and Reg A+—as discussed in 
this chapter. The numbers assume a typical $50 M raise.

Remember, going public is just the start of the process, not the end. Once a 
firm is a public company, there are significant ongoing incremental costs that 
must be considered, including the following:
• 
Director and officer insurance
• 
Accounting
• 
Legal
• 
Board compensation
• 
SEC filing costs for10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks, and so on
• 
Financial marketing costs (analysts, market makers, and PR)
• 
Corporate governance setup and maintenance costs
•

* These costs can vary significantly based on the selection of legal and accounting firms and invest-

Regulation A+
61
The ongoing costs of remaining a public company on a national exchange such 
as NASDAQ, NYSE, or AMEX can range from hundreds of thousand dollars 
per year to well over one million dollars. The costs to remain public on non-
national exchanges such as OTC markets may be much less but are neverthe-
less significant.
As small-cap IPO opportunities increase in volume, many smaller brokers 
and investment banks are expected to participate and become much more 
competitive, resulting in lower costs. In particular, Reg A+ public offerings are 
expected to save 30-60% for the IPO due to the simplification and reduced 
documentation and reporting requirements explained in this chapter, along 
with reductions in related legal and accounting costs.
We believe that the cost of Reg A+ offerings will go down significantly as the 
volume of mini-IPOs increases, issuers, investment banks, and new channels 
such as solicitation through the Internet evolve, making the process more 
efficient and more cost-competitive.

Reg A+ Provides New Opportunities for 
Investment Banks and Intermediaries
JOBS Act legislation is already creating new business opportunities for many 
firms that support small issuers. At the beginning of this chapter, we discussed 
how firms such as Apple, FedEx, Cisco, and others were able to have success-
ful smaller IPOs. During that era, there were many more investment banks, 
analysts, and intermediaries that focused on smaller issuers. Due largely to 
increased regulation over the past 25 years, the growing costs of going and 
staying public resulted in fewer small companies going public, and those firms 
that supported smaller companies gradually were gobbled up by larger firms 
that focused on larger offerings. 
Because Reg A+ allows smaller companies to raise capital with mini-IPOs, it 
can be expected that there will be a resurgence of interest from investment 
banks and intermediaries to offer support services, plus an increase in law 
firms and accounting firms to service this new sector. In addition, the relaxed 
restrictions on solicitation and advertising may also allow banks and other 
participants to add value in other ways previously not permitted under the 
securities laws.
Potential issuers under Reg A+ are likely to view the new alternatives as more 
attractive compared to prior options. Regional investment banks may be espe-
cially well-positioned to capitalize on these new opportunities, given their 
existing relationships with smaller regional issuers and growth companies. It 
can also be expected that new trading sites and exchanges will emerge that 
will allow new investors to take advantage of the liquidity options that Reg A+ 
provides.

Reg A+ is likely to create incentives for smaller investment banks that  
currently feel left out by larger banks taking over the IPO placements and syn-
dications. They will likely use newer models and utilize flexibility of soliciting 
retail and small institutional investors at lower costs through online marketing, 
portals, and lower commission and legal fees.
Summary
Regulation A+ has a huge potential to replace many private placements under 
Regulation D and provide a lower-cost alternative to conventional IPOs for 
many qualified small domestic and foreign companies that have encountered 
challenges in raising growth capital.
Reg A+ presents the best balance between regulatory oversight and flexibility 
of all the offering options for smaller or younger businesses. It provides the 
most flexibility for smaller issuers to go public and raise significant amounts 
of debt or equity over private placements at the lowest cost of any public 
offering option.
Reg A+ will attract many investors who have shied away from private place-
ments due to lack of liquidity.
Although Reg A+ does provide a lot of flexibility for issuers by not requiring 
compliance with the more onerous registration provisions of the Securities 
Act or reporting as required by the Exchange Act of 1934, disclosure and 
transparency remain a primary requirement of investors in the marketplace. 
Beyond the reporting required under Reg A+, the issuer can and should volun-
tarily provide additional information for investors’ knowledge to allow proper 
evaluation of the issuer’s value proposition.
Reg A+ securities will have a number of trading platform options available as 
the volume of deals grow. Alternative trading systems such as OTC markets 
currently listed or Reg A+-dedicated exchanges will develop over time to 
expedite and make more efficient the current practice of or trades through 
inter-dealer bidding. National exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE will very 
likely provide comparable platforms in the future.
Issuers must recognize that post-IPO support is just as important as—or 
even more important than—the initial listing. It is ironic that many issuers 
spend millions of dollars in marketing to fight competition but do not see the 
marketing of their stock as their responsibility. Investors are one of the most 
important and critical members of the company’s team.

Chapter 3 | Benefits of Regulation A+
66
Maintaining good investor relations cannot be overemphasized. Providing 
ongoing information to investors is what maintains stock liquidity and is highly 
correlated to price appreciation. It is highly recommended that issuers com-
mit to adequate human and financial support critical to the long-term success 
of their stock. This could be the key difference between appreciating stock 
with lots of liquidity for investors or an “orphan” stock.
Because Reg A+ is new to most investors and issuers, it should be expected 
that its use will grow and expand over time, and there may be speed bumps 
along the way. Those issuers who are bold and not afraid to dive in to new 
pioneering opportunities such as Reg A+ will reap the very significant benefits 
and business growth intended by the JOBS Act.

C h a p t e r 
Limitations and 
Business Line 
Considerations
Regulation A+ is designed to facilitate the capital-raising needs of a broad 
­variety of businesses and industry types, but it’s not for all issuers or neces-
sarily the best way to achieve all business objectives. You need to weigh a 
number of important considerations to determine if it is the optimum means 
of accomplishing your fundraising goals. Some of these include, but are not 
necessarily limited to, the legal limitations on Regulation A+, investor priori-
ties, and the post-capital raise obligations to maintain and grow the value of 
your investors’ investments.
The easiest place to start is with the legal requirements to qualify to use 
Regulation A+.
Qualification Criteria for Regulation A+
Regulation A+ can be used to issue any equity, debt, or debt convertible into 
equity securities, except for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights, 
or similar interests in mineral rights and asset-backed securities.

Chapter 4 | Limitations and Business Line Considerations
68
As discussed in Chapter 2, for Tier 1 and 2 offerings, the following categories 
of potential issuers are precluded from the use of Regulation A:
• 
Any issuer not organized under the laws of the United 
States or Canada, or any State, Province, Territory or 
possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, with its 
principal place of business in the United States or Canada
• 
Any issuer subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange 
Act (a company required to report publicly) prior to filing
• 
Any issuer registered or required to register as an 
­investment company under the Investment Company Act 
of 1940
• 
Any issuer that had their registration revoked pursuant 
to a Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act within five years 
prior to filing an offering statement
• 
A development stage company that either has no spe-
cific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its 
business plan is to merge with an unidentified company 
or companies (commonly referred to as a “blank check” 
company or a “public shell”)
• 
An issuer issuing fractional undivided interests in oil  
or gas rights, or similar interests in mineral rights or 
asset-backed securities
• 
Any issuer that is subject to “Bad Acts Disqualification” 
under Rule 262.1
So, outside of these limitations, from a legal perspective the types of com-
panies that can use Regulation A+ is pretty expansive. The real question for 
whom Regulation A+ would be right comes down to business factors—such 
as the maturity and character of the business that might attract investors—
and the market realities of where demand might lie at a given time.
1Tier 2 issuers are also subject to the disqualification rules established under Rule 506(d) 
of Regulation D. These are broader rules than found under Rule 262 of Regulation A+ 
and should be carefully reviewed with counsel. Existing Tier 2 issuers may not use Reg A+ 
while they are not in compliance with their ongoing reporting requirements.

Regulation A+
69
Investor Considerations
As discussed in Chapter 3, Regulation A+ provides a broad public capital-
raising channel that does not have the excessive regulatory expense and 
burdens normally associated with traditional public offerings, and that also 
greatly increases the pool of potential investors as well as access to them 
through public advertising. Also, because of the liquidity that is permitted with 
Regulation A+ securities, market opportunities are likely to develop over time.
Regulation A+ presents an enormous opportunity for mid-market and smaller 
businesses that have otherwise been precluded from the public markets, as 
well as for smaller, industry-focused, regional investment banks, and intermedi-
aries who have been edged out of participation in IPO opportunities by larger 
investment banks and support firms that focus on larger IPOs.
As discussed in Chapters 1 and 3, traditional fundraising via Regulation D is 
practically limited to accredited investors and select institutions. While it has 
been reported that there may be as many as 8.5 million accredited investors 
in the United States,2 the number of active angel investors is far smaller—
fewer than 400,000—but they accounted for funding about 73,000 ventures 
in 2014.3
Because Regulation A+ is not restricted to accredited investors, the pool 
of potential investors enlarged by non-accredited investors could be many 
times greater than the pool for Regulation D investors. So, for example, while 
the challenges of accessing and convincing investors to invest in generally 
risky investments, like startups, can be expected to be greater, firms who 
elect to use Regulation A+ will have many more potential investors that they 
can attract to such deals. In addition, Regulation A+ transactions will likely 
require significantly less documentation from investors than either Regulation 
D 506(b) or 506(c). As a consequence, crowdfunding portals, brokerage firms, 
and managements will likely find it easier to market Reg A+ securities, at least 
on the offering.

This article also discusses a possible change in the definition of an accredited investor 
being contemplated by the SEC, which could reduce the total from 8.5 million to just 
3.75 million, thereby significantly reducing the pool of potential investors for Regulation 
D offerings. This possible change will likely further accelerate the number of Regulation 
A+ offerings since they can be offered to all types of investors—both accredited and 
non-accredited.

Chapter 4 | Limitations and Business Line Considerations

Since the passage of the JOBS Act, there are a growing number of platforms 
that make it easier to access smaller investors. Numerous sites such as the 
following offer access to large numbers of investors:
• 
www.gust.com
• 
www.equitynet.com
• 
www.angel.co
• 
www.startups.co
While these and similar sites have been largely limited to accredited investors 
and Regulation D offerings until now, the ranks of these and similar portals 
should swell in number and volume as non-accredited investors get more 
active in the Regulation A+ offerings that will be offered on their portals.
Securities Broker-Dealers
Due to greater access and availability of online information on investments 
in general, there has been a growing number of investors in recent years that 
prefer to invest directly and avoid the added fees associated with access-
ing investments through intermediaries such as securities brokers. However, 
many investors still seek out and rely on the inputs of qualified financial advi-
sors before committing funds to new investments.
As of May 2015, there were roughly 4,000 licensed independent securities 
firms who employed over 600,000 financial advisors and support personnel 
in the United States.4 Since each financial advisor typically has dozens or 
more clients, their ability to attract investor interest is enormous. Financial 
advisors often have significant influence over the investments that are made 
by their clients. As a result, they can often quickly raise significant funds pro-
vided they are convinced that a new investment opportunity is suitable for 
their clients.
Many traditional financial advisors and broker-dealer firms are generally skep-
tical of new investment ideas and will require much more due-diligence infor-
mation in order to be convinced that an investment is suitable for their clients. 
This is in comparison to angel investors, who are investing from their own 
checkbook and are generally willing to take greater risks.
The majority of registered securities firms focus on providing services to retail 
clients, that is, persons investing for their own account, as opposed to insti-
tutional investors, venture capital groups, or other dealers in securities. As a

result of the enormous opportunity that Reg A+ can have for many securities 
firms, the growing retail sector (accredited and non-accredited) will gener-
ate more opportunities for securities dealers to assist entrepreneurs in rais-
ing capital for quality investment opportunities that can withstand the more 
extensive due-diligence criteria required by this fundraising channel.
What Is the Retail Investor Looking for in  
Any Investment?
It may be surprising, but we have found that most of today’s retail investors 
are not looking to make a killing on their investments. They are generally 
more interested in not getting killed—that is, losing their money. The typical 
angel investor who is seeking a 10X or higher return in a technology startup 
is not representative of the typical retail investor. They are a very important 
segment within the retail channel, but care must be taken not to build a fun-
draising strategy exclusively targeting high-risk–high-reward type investors. 
Otherwise, entrepreneurs may miss attracting the larger pool of potential 
investors available to them.
Most retail investors seek predictable yield (stable regular cash flow) with 
limited downside potential (low risk of loss of their investment capital). They 
also like to obtain some guarantee of repayment, if possible, such as a personal 
guarantee or a pledge of some securities in debt offerings, to protect their 
investment. While investors generally accept more risk as their anticipated 
yield increases, a strategy that emphasizes capital preservation with some 
ongoing distributions along with some added security attracts the greatest 
number of retail investors for any given deal. Most retail investors do not have 
the ability to risk large amounts on the potential of high-growth investments 
or to conduct arbitrage plays in the secondary markets that have the potential 
to develop around Regulation A+.
“But wait!” you say. “My opportunity will not provide any income, and I need 
to find investors that are okay giving me money with the hope that I can even-
tually return them a big multiple on their investment.”
There’s nothing wrong with that—just realize that such a story will reduce the 
number of potential investors that you can target, and will therefore require a 
bit more planning in reaching the right investors, which may increase the time 

Chapter 4 | Limitations and Business Line Considerations

required to raise the total capital required. However, entrepreneurs can take 
some steps, even on riskier deals, to broaden their target investor pool.
• 
Look for ways in which investors can be offered some 
yield. Cash distributions are best, but preferred stock 
with some added upside over time attracts more inves-
tors than “common” stock.
• 
Raising capital through a debt offering, especially if there 
is some limited guarantee or pledge of collateral, attracts 
more investors than a pure equity raise.
• 
Since many investors rely on inputs from investment pro-
fessionals, look to build your investment pitch in way that 
such advisors find your story to be attractive to their 
clients.
• 
Look for opportunities to take advantage of the greater 
liquidity options inherent in Regulation A+. While Reg 
A+ stock can in theory be traded immediately with few 
restrictions, it will require successful efforts to build 
interest in trading your stock post investment (see “After 
Market Considerations” in Chapter 5).
COMMON VERSUS PREFERRED STOCK
Common Stock
• 
Investors who hold common stock benefit from capital appreciation 
when/if the stock rises in value and through dividends.
• 
This means ongoing payment of dividends cannot be guaranteed.
• 
Holders of common stock also have the right to vote on company 
issues.
Preferred Stock
• 
Unlike common stock, preferred stock often guarantees dividends. 
The value of preferred stock is more stable since it is tied to interest 
rates and not as subject to market volatility as with common stock.
• 
Preferred stockholders receive a higher priority for dividend 
payments and also get paid ahead of common stock holders if the 
company is liquidated.
• 
Holders of preferred stock do not get voting rights in the business.

Regulation A+
73
In our experience, preferred equity deals and debt-oriented products—that is, 
deals that are structured to require current dividends to be paid to the inves-
tor (currently 5-8%)—predominate right now. But as a larger volume of deals 
develops and analytic coverage for issuers becomes more sophisticated, it’s 
likely a much larger variety of deals will develop, with the investor being able 
to ascertain the likelihood of dividends from solid fundamentals rather than 
the covenants associated with the security.
With more diversity in the opportunities for retail investors, there will be 
more opportunities for retail investors (as well as for securities firms who 
might assist to get an offering sold on a retail basis) to find good deals in their 
geographic backyard. Industries and companies they know likely hold more 
attraction for the retail investor who does not have the analytical resources 
of the institutional investor. So a retail-oriented approach to a capital raise is 
very likely to have a greater geographic focus proximate to the issuer.
For institutional investors, their desired investment profile can be much more 
value-add oriented than current yield-oriented, and they are willing to take 
more risk and consider many more situations for a chance at prodigious 
growth. The more sophisticated approaches and methodologies employed by 
successful institutional investors are supposed to reduce the risk related to 
this sort of investing. Those who invest with such institutional investors do 
so relying on the institutional investor’s methodologies and diversification to 
mitigate risk, especially when they are investing with principals who have a 
proven track record.
Venture capitalists and other institutional investors might have the same pri-
orities they have always had, yet can be expected to enter the Reg A+ market 
with a view to the liquidity offered by these securities as a risk-mitigation 
tool. They may also view the public disciplines that will be brought to their 
less mature firms as a training ground before they go to the “big show” of a 
full Wall Street offering. As a generality, however, institutional investors will 
be more motivated by growth and after-market value appreciation than retail 
investors.
After-Market Considerations
Regardless of whether the money is raised from retail or institutional inves-
tors, as sophisticated secondary markets develop for these securities, after-
market considerations hold a big place in whether a given investment attracts 
capital. For the institutional investor, the ability to identify opportunities for 
growth in the market value of the securities will be a major motivator. For the 
retail investor, the added transparency and frequency of reporting associated 
with public securities allows the retail investor to identify companies with 
fundamentals (like strong management market positions or solid financials,  
for example) that allow for reliable yields and the ability to preserve value. 

Chapter 4 | Limitations and Business Line Considerations
74
Those same fundamentals usually, in fact, lead to growth in market value and 
stock appreciation, but that is less of a focus of typical retail investors than 
wealth preservation. So the ability to create value in the public market will be 
key to successful Reg A+ offerings.
The retail investors are more focused, consciously or not, on organic growth 
to develop value. They are longer-term investors who are not looking to 
achieve big returns from market moves. These folks, for whom more limited 
volumes of trading due to awareness of Reg A+ or regulatory issues at state 
levels, are less of an issue if the market can price shares reliably and there is 
a pool of demand. The Reg A+ after-market will likely be dominated by retail 
investors for some time. Creating market value is primarily a function, as with 
any other securities, of the issuer being able to operate profitably and support 
growth. Having a management team with a strong record of producing prior 
investor returns is key, as in most capital-raising pursuits, to a successful Reg 
A+ program.
Value creation is also supported by the transparency of the issuer. Reg A+ 
issuers deal in essentially a public market. The law requires certain aspects 
of reporting, but the markets, more than anything else, demand that issuers 
provide meaningful and regular reporting as to operations, progress, triumphs, 
and setbacks of the company, so that the securities can receive market atten-
tion and be properly priced.
The markets, as with other public securities, also want to see corporate disci-
plines—regular board meetings, proper consents, annual meetings, sharehold-
ers votes, and so on—followed rigorously. This is intended to give the markets 
confidence in the information they are receiving about a company. It also com-
municates a focused management team. A focused, disciplined management 
team will be more likely to be trusted to make the company profitable and get 
the company back on course when setbacks do occur, which should help the 
company retain share value on a more consistent basis.
While the potential of trading Reg A+ securities now exists, there are many 
challenges that remain unless Congress steps in to remove several remain-
ing hurdles that will inhibit a broad public market in these offerings. We will 
further explore these challenges and present possible solutions in Chapter 8.
Let’s look at how Reg A+ applies to some specific industry sectors.
High Tech
Advanced technology can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, tech-
nology can be a source of massive growth in the value of one’s investment. On 
the other hand, the same cutting-edge nature of many of these investments 
also means they can be a source of significant risk for investors, especially if the 
technologies do not have analogies to present applications in the marketplace.

Regulation A+
75
Depending on what types of investors a high-tech company is seeking to 
attract, the company will need to achieve certain development milestones to 
achieve its goals. Institutional players may be more willing to invest in a tech-
nology at an earlier stage of development in order to maximize the potential 
for growth in the market value of their investment. On the other hand, retail 
investors are likely to be less tolerant of development risk so a proven track 
record of revenue and profits will be more attractive to the typical retail 
investor (versus an angel investor).
Currently, the pathway to funding in the high-tech sector saturated by large 
VCs, whose models are to invest extremely large amounts of money for 
a commanding stake in technology companies, they believe, can conduct a 
­billion-dollar IPO on Wall Street in a roughly five-seven year timeframe. The 
VCs bet big, so they expect to win big.
At the same time, there are any number of companies in the technology space 
that have achieved a certain level of proven growth in the development of 
their technologies and have even, in many cases, reached a meaningful level of 
real revenues. They are now too big to find the money they need from angel 
investors or friends and family. At the same time, however, they are also far 
too small or may lack the very high return potential to meet the criteria of 
the large VCs.5
Based on what we have discussed regarding investor priorities in this space, 
Reg A+ can provide a viable alternative to the large VCs, for many of these 
companies, by allowing them to access a retail base that focuses more on cur-
rent revenue and opportunities for reliable, if more modest, growth.
For the institutional investor, Regulation A+ provides the opportunity to real-
ize significant growth appreciation earlier in a company’s growth cycle as com-
pared to the often longer road leading to a traditional IPO.
Online Fundraising for Technology Opportunities
Online fundraising for Reg A+ offerings will continue to evolve but can be 
expected to focus more on offering overall lower cost fundraising options as 
compared to Reg D offerings and access to a growing pool of non-accredited 
investors. This will lead to a rebirth or conversion of many of the current 
online platforms.
5As pointed out in the article from Forbes in 2013 entitled “Why 99.95% Of Entrepreneurs 
Should Stop Wasting Their Time Seeking Venture Capital,” very few technology companies 
are able to achieve hurdles that attract VC capital. Most entrepreneurs would be well 
advised to seek capital from non-VC sources. See http://www.forbes.com/sites/
dileeprao/2013/07/22/why-99-95-of-entrepreneurs-should-stop-­wasting-
time-seeking-venture-capital/.

Chapter 4 | Limitations and Business Line Considerations
76
Since the passage of the JOBS Act in 2012, many online platforms have emerged 
for technology companies. Until now these platforms are all raising capital for 
Reg D offerings for accredited investors, but can be expected to expand to 
include Reg A+ offerings and broaden their reach to include non-accredited 
investors going forward.
Some of these funding companies are organized as registered securities bro-
kers and accept fees as a percentage of capital raised, while others list offerings 
for a fixed marketing or consulting fee on their site, do not have any license, 
and work on a consultant basis. Here are just a few examples of popular por-
tals that assist entrepreneurs in raising capital for technology firms.

Low- or Medium-Tech Companies
Medium-tech businesses are those that have created new applications or deri-
vations of existing and proven technologies, or provide adjunct products, or 
services necessary to the operation of higher technologies—such as a service 
firm that deploys a customized GPS system for tracking distribution/fulfill-
ment, or a company that produces circuit switches necessary for fiber-optic 
networks.
Low-tech covers everything from brick-and-mortar manufacturing to service 
businesses without any particular emphasis on technology. For example, a 
regional restaurant chain.
In Chapter 1, we discussed the fact that many smaller and regional investment 
banks and brokerages that were previously cut out of the public markets now 
have the opportunity to re-enter the public markets with Reg A+. Nowhere 
is their presence felt more than in this category, as low- and medium-tech 
companies exist all around the country and not just in high-tech centers like 
Silicon Valley.
The population of these types of businesses permits a lot more flexibility in 
the use of Reg A+ to meet funding needs. Many investors are attracted to 
the local nature of the investments that can be had under Reg A+ and many 
low- and medium-tech firms with a regional business focus could benefit by 
attracting local investors with a Reg A+ offering.
The companies who are in the best position to exploit Reg A+ share the same 
characteristics that attract the attention and capital of investment banks and 
brokerages—revenues, a disciplined approach to corporate governance and 
reporting, and an experienced management team.

Regulation A+
77
Real Estate
Investments in real estate are one of the major opportunity areas that can 
benefit from Reg A+. Many investors prefer real estate over other investments 
since it is often easier to understand, has tangible value that can be verified 
with readily available market data, often has an associated income stream, and 
can be visited. Investment timeframes are often more predictable due to the 
short-term nature of many of the projects; for example, developing a new 
shopping center, rehabbing an older apartment building, and so on. Real estate 
is also viewed to be a scarce resource (“they aren’t making it anymore”) that 
is more immune to the degree of volatility that is frequently experienced in 
other types of investments, such as in technology firms.
Overview of Real Estate Investments
While real estate is often owned free and clear of any debt, the typical real 
estate investment sought by investors includes both an equity component and 
a debt component. There is typically a cash-down payment and a bank loan or 
mortgage for the remainder required to purchase the property. Indeed one 
of the uniquely attractive aspects of real estate is the ability to acquire larger 
and more attractive properties through leveraging available cash (equity) with 
added debt.
Equity investments in real estate can be broadly categorized as either income 
or non-income producing properties.
Income properties are primarily acquired by investors seeking near-term 
investment returns resulting from rental income in combination with longer-
term asset appreciation. Examples include residential properties, retail, com-
mercial office, industrial and warehouse, student housing, gas stations, storage 
facilities, mobile home parks, and so on. Non-income properties can also be 
desirable investments if they appreciate substantially over the investment 
period. Examples include raw land and development projects that can be sold 
for a profit at a later date.
Many smaller real estate investments are completed by individual investors 
who invest their own funds and do not seek participation from outside inves-
tors—and are not candidates for Reg A+. Larger projects, however, com-
monly require participation from multiple investors under the supervision of 
a management entity. Larger projects having multiple investors are potentially 
­suitable for Reg A+.
There are also many opportunities to invest in debt securities related to real 
estate. Many smaller investors lend funds to those seeking to acquire real 
properties and secure their loans against the value of the underlying prop-
erty. If the loan is not repaid, the investor has recourse to gain possession

78
of the real property and sell it to realize unpaid loan balances that may be 
due. The following investment structures are commonly used when multiple 
investors are sought to invest real estate assets whether they are income or 
non-income producing.
Deal-by-Deal Syndications
Larger real estate investments are organized by individuals or groups  
commonly known as syndicators. Their efforts focus chiefly on finding an 
attractive opportunity and then developing sufficient related information to 
attract multiple investors to participate in the investment, as well as preparing 
required documentation to meet ongoing reporting and regulatory require-
ments. The syndicator may also remain involved as a manager of the project 
through the time of an eventual sale or exit. Examples include:
• 
An existing older apartment building that can be 
­rehabilitated for profit and is offered to multiple investors
• 
A new development project for a retail, commercial, or 
multi-resident that will be sold upon completion to other 
investors who plan to hold the property for a long period
• 
Investment in larger parcels of raw land that are in 
a growth corridor and have long-term appreciation 
potential
Public and Private Equity Firms Investing in  
Multiple Projects
At the next tier, above deal-by-deal syndications, are private equity funds that 
offer investors the opportunity to invest in multiple projects in a common 
investment entity having similar characteristics. These types of investments 
are attractive to many investors since they can mitigate risk through diversifi-
cation. Fund-oriented investments often have more experienced management 
teams in place and offer economies of scale that are not always available for 
individual projects. The investment portfolios of these larger firms are typically 
focused on similar asset classes—for example, retail, commercial office, multi-
resident, and so on,—and specific risk categories with those asset classes.
Investment strategies typically focus on the following risk/reward categories:
• 
Core: These investments are focused on asset preserva-
tion, have low or no debt, and provide low risk with pred-
icable income. Stable fully leased multifamily properties in 
strong areas are most often found in these funds.

Regulation A+
79
• 
Value added: These funds are structured to provide 
moderately higher returns with commensurately higher 
risk. Greater returns are achieved through investing in 
properties that can benefit from additional value-added 
investments that can result in a higher property value 
that exceeds the amount invested. The types of proper-
ties span all asset classes and typically have management 
or operational problems, require building improve-
ments, and/or need additional capital to fund improved 
operations.
• 
Opportunistic: These funds are organized to provide the 
highest returns but also have high risk. Examples include 
investments in development projects, debt instruments, 
raw land, and specialty asset classes such as storage and 
billboards. The investments are typically of shorter-term 
duration and more oriented toward capital appreciation 
than income objectives.
The fund structures range from private equity funds organized as partnerships 
(LLC/LLP) to public and private Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).6 Many 
larger firms trade on public markets and their shares can be easily traded.
Why Reg A+ Works Well for Real Estate
With the exception of a few large REITs that raise capital through IPOs, most 
real estate capital is raised via private placements utilizing the Reg D exemp-
tion discussed in Chapter 3. Approximately $100B dollars is raised annually 
for real estate using Reg D.7
Suffice it to say that the opportunity and benefits of utilizing Reg A+ for real 
estate offerings can be substantial.
As discussed in Chapter 3, the major benefits of utilizing Reg A+ instead 
of Reg D include the ability to advertise freely on any media channel, test-
ing of waters prior to approval by the SEC, allowing participation by a large 
population of non-accredited investors, and options for immediate liquidity if

80
required. As a result, Reg A+ can be an excellent source of funds and can sig-
nificantly lower the overall cost of capital for many real estate opportunities 
requiring up to $50M in equity per year.8
In order to evaluate whether a specific real estate investment or fund should 
use Reg D or Reg A+, it is important to review the impact of the JOBS Act 
on both regulations and compare the overall pros and cons. One of the major 
benefits added by the JOBS Act is to allow use of the Internet and other 
media channels to reach a much larger investor base. This applies to both Reg 
D and Reg A+ offerings. However, as you learned in Chapter 3, while both 
Reg D and Reg A+ offerings can now be publicly advertised,9 only issuers of 
Reg A+ offerings are allowed to accept non-accredited investors. This greatly 
increases the pool of potential investors.
Since the passage of the JOBS Act in 2012, use of online web sites to adver-
tise offerings has been significantly expanding along with a growing number 
of funding platforms focusing on real estate offerings (see below). In June 
2014, The Wall Street Journal estimated that $135M in real estate related debt 
and equity had been raised via online portals. While this is not insignificant, 
it is important to understand that while these sites could advertise to both 
accredited and non-accredited investors, only accredited investors could actu-
ally invest per the laws existing at that time. Since use of Reg A+ significantly 
broadens the number of potential investors, it is reasonable to assume that 
over a billion dollars of real estate investments annually could be funded via 
online platforms offering Reg A+ real estate investments.10
Raising Capital for Real Estate Projects
The process for raising capital for real estate projects can vary widely but 
mostly depends on the amount of capital required, type of project, holding 
period, type of investors, and their liquidity needs. While there are many 
aspects of Regulation A+ that make it the preferred choice relative to Reg D, 
here we evaluate and compare the three most critical aspects—process and 
time to raise capital, cost of capital, and liquidity options.
8Since most real estate investments are leveraged through the use of debt (i.e., the buyer 
obtains a loan for a portion of the property value), the actual amount of property that can 
be purchased can be significantly greater than the amount of invested capital. For example, 
an investor with $100,000 to invest can purchase a property valued at $200,000 if they are 
willing to obtain a $100,000 loan to add to their investment equity.

81
Process and Time to Raise Capital
In the process of real estate fundraising for a Reg D offering, the first step is 
to prepare a detailed business plan. Then a derivative of this plan becomes 
part of a Private Placement Memorandum (PPM). This document is typically 
prepared by a qualified attorney and not only includes the business plan but 
also numerous disclosures for risk factors that investors need to be aware 
of and accept. The time needed to prepare a Reg D offering can range from 
­two-eight weeks depending on the scope and complexity of the project.
The next step is to decide the channel for fundraising. The choice is largely 
between using an indirect sales approach consisting of registered securities 
broker-dealers and their agents (BDs) or direct selling by the issuer to quali-
fied investors that they may directly know, such as friends, family members, 
and/or previous investors known to the issuer. The larger the capital raise, 
the more likely that the services of a securities broker-dealer will be required.
If BDs are engaged to assist with the fundraising, the lead BD will conduct 
extensive due diligence (DD), which typically takes several weeks to approve 
the offering for broader distribution for sale by their agents. Several additional 
BDs may be engaged as part of the selling group and the fundraising process 
begins.
Typically, only accredited investors are allowed to participate in Reg D offer-
ings. Each investor must be carefully screened and his income and net worth 
properly documented before acceptance of funds. To complete the actual 
funding, Reg D real estate offerings can typically take three-six months 
depending on the amount of funds being raised and the success of the 
­distribution channel.
Raising capital through use of the BD channel can not only be a long process, 
but it can be relatively expensive as compared to direct fundraising. In addition 
to the cost of preparing the offering, BDs will often charge as much as 10% of 
the amount being raised for due diligence, marketing, and brokerage commis-
sions. BDs will often require that more comprehensive offering documents be 
prepared by the issuer that can result in added legal fees.
As discussed in more detail in Chapter 5, in order to raise capital for a Reg A+ 
offering, a business plan similar to Reg D has to be submitted to the SEC along 
with two years of audited financial statements and other disclosures as applicable. 
Approval of the SEC may take three to six months based on completeness of the 
submitted information. The next step is to decide the channel for actual fundrais-
ing and the targeted investor pools. Since both accredited and non-accredited 
investors are allowed to participate, almost anyone may invest in a Reg A+ offer-
ing, thereby raising the likelihood that an issuer could directly raise required 
capital without the involvement and added expense of a BD sales channel.

Chapter 4 | Limitations and Business Line Considerations
82
Another key feature of Reg A+ rules allows “testing of waters”. This fea-
ture is very important, as it allows issuers to approach investors before 
formal fundraising begins to determine the level of potential interest in 
their offering, and the amount of investment they may likely receive prior to 
approval from the SEC. Once SEC approval is received, investors who were 
approached during the testing of the waters can send their funds to the 
issuer immediately. By using testing of waters, an issuer can work in paral-
lel with investors to gauge investors’ interest in the offering while the SEC 
is reviewing the Reg A+ filing instead of waiting for SEC approval before 
­starting the fundraising process.
Overcoming SEC Approval Delays
Unlike Reg D offerings, which can begin fundraising without SEC approval, 
Reg A+ offerings must first be approved by the SEC. This can take three to 
six months. This can be negative in considering the use of Reg A+. For real 
estate projects that cannot tolerate the added approval cycle; for example, 
a redevelopment opportunity that was just acquired in a competitive bid-
ding situation and needs to be quickly started, there are options that can be 
considered.
• 
Urgent projects can be acquired using short-term debt 
(“mezzanine debt”) and then refinanced by funds that 
are raised after the SEC approval process has been 
completed.
• 
Documents submitted for approval to the SEC can list 
a specific acquisition project (e.g., a 200-300 unit apart-
ment rehab project) while parallel efforts are underway 
to identify a substitute property. An amendment can then 
be made to the previously submitted documents prior to 
the final approval of the SEC, thereby reducing the overall 
timeline.
With some creativity, the Reg A+ process may not be as complex or time 
consuming as it appears due to the added SEC approval requirements. The 
overall time to raise capital can be similar to the Reg D process, with the 
added huge benefit of having a large population of non-accredited investors 
to participate as compared to a much smaller number of accredited investors, 
who can invest in Reg D offerings.

Using Online Portals to Reduce Costs and 
Access More Investors
As with technology and other investments, the overall cost of raising capital 
for real estate investments can be significantly lower for Reg A+ offerings if 
online portals are used to attract investors. Furthermore, many real estate 
projects that may not be suitable for BDs and their clients (such as higher 
risk value-added and opportunistic projects) may still be attractive to smaller 
non-accredited investors who are willing to make direct investments online.
Since the JOBS Act of 2012, there have been dozens of firms that have 
launched online funding platforms. While many more firms will emerge in the 
years ahead, we would like to briefly profile several of the more successful 
and better known firms that focus on real estate to provide the reader with a 
better understanding of business models that currently exist.11 As of the print 
date of this book, these firms predominantly offer Reg D investment opportu-
nities; however, most of these portals have indicated that they plan to add Reg 
A+ offerings as the new regulations take hold.
Online real estate funding portals have evolved into the following categories.
Commission-Fee–Based Fundraising
Traditionally, the most common form of compensation for intermediaries who 
raise capital for real estate offerings is to be paid a commission based on a 
percentage of the funds raised. However, this form of compensation can result 
in a requirement that the entity raising the funds may need to register as a 
securities broker-dealer, thereby adding more cost and overhead to the fun-
draising process.12
Fixed Fee for Advertising
Rather than charging commissions, these portals generate their primary 
income by charging the fundraising group a flat fee to list their property on 
their site in order to gain exposure to potential investors. Since the fees are 
not related to the actual monies that are raised, these portals operate more 
as advertising sites and are therefore not subject to securities laws.
11There is a significant discussion within the legal community as to whether online portals 
under each of the models need to register as securities broker-dealers. This should be 
evaluated with your legal counsel as you consider these options.
12An example of a portal in this category is http://www.circleup.com.

Chapter 4 | Limitations and Business Line Considerations
84
Groups raising funds will of course need to comply with applicable regulations 
when they engage with investors sourced by these sites and obtain funds. This 
type of public advertising via the Internet was formerly not allowed per the 
securities law, but the practice has since been allowed per the JOBS Act of 
2012 under the new general solicitation regulations.13
To assist investors to determine which offerings are right for them, most of 
the real estate portals profile their advertised offerings using standard tem-
plates so that all offerings on the site can be easily compared to each other. 
Some sites require that all capital that is sought be raised before any capital 
is turned over to the company group seeking the funds. Other sites allow any 
monies raised to go to the fundraising group.14
Examples of portals in this category include:
Sidecar Fundraising
Portals engaged in this form of fundraising establish a new investment com-
pany—typically structured as a Limited Liability Company (LLC)—that mir-
rors a specific real estate investment for which they wish to raise capital. 
Acting as principals of this sidecar investment vehicle, they then can directly 
raise capital without registering as a securities broker-dealer. This capital is 
then deployed in the primary project.15
While traditional broker-dealers have been slow to embrace online portals, 
there is a growing trend among smaller regional broker-dealers to establish 
online to allow their established clients to obtain information on new offerings.
Summary
The selection of the fundraising channel is a critical decision and issuers need 
to carefully weigh the trade-offs among costs, time to raise funds, and capacity 
of the selected channel to produce desired funds. The lowest cost option is 
to directly access investors known to the fundraiser. Next is use of fixed fee 
online advertising channels. Next is the use of online broker-dealers. Finally, 
the most expensive is when traditional broker-dealers utilize financial advisers 
to raise capital from their clients. The range of cost is expected to be between 
3–10% of the amount of capital raised, depending on the choice of channel.

14An example of a portal in this category is http://www.equitynet.com.
15Examples of portals in this category are www.realtymogul.com and www.cityfunders.com.  
Currently, such portals offer predominantly Reg D rather than Reg A+ opportunities. 
However it can be expected that there will be a shift into Reg A+ as more portal operators 
begin to take advantage of the added benefits.

The Key 
Elements of a 
Reg A+ Offering
Once a company has determined that a Regulation A+ offering is the correct 
path, the company, which is now a potential Regulation A+ issuer, has several 
initial decisions to make. If the issuer has engaged a principal underwriter or 
placement agent, the underwriter or agent may have significant input on these 
initial decisions. Many of these decisions will occur simultaneously with each 
other, or at different points in the process for different issuers. Here is a non-
exhaustive list of these typical decisions, in no particular order:
• 
Determination of offering size: If the intended offering size 
is greater than $20M, an issuer will be required to engage 
in a Tier 2 offering, with the attendant audited financials 
and reporting requirements, and the benefit of state 
preemption.
• 
Tier 1 vs. Tier 2: If the issuer’s intended offering size is $20M  
or less, the issuer may use either Tier 1 or Tier 2 of 
Regulation A+. The primary factors weighing in this deci-
sion are the advantage of state preemption relative to 
the initial offering versus the increased burden of filing 
audited financial statements with its offering statement 
and required periodic reporting in Tier 2 offerings.
5

Chapter 5 | The Key Elements of a Reg A+ Offering
86
If an issuer is considering utilizing Tier 1, it should care-
fully review the qualification regulations in the states it is 
targeting for sales, because many states have their own 
laws and regulations that require audited financials, which 
means that all but the most targeted Tier 1 offering is 
likely to include some audit requirements.
• 
Plan of distribution: The earlier an issuer can determine 
its plan for distributing its Regulation A+ securities, par-
ticularly whether it intends to engage underwriter(s) or 
placement agent(s) to sell its securities, the better. The 
method of distribution will likely have significant influence 
over the type and structure of the offered securities, and 
the underwriters and placement agents will likely have 
significant input.
• 
Selection of third-party providers: The vast majority of issu-
ers will not have the in-house financial or legal personnel 
(and, of course, cannot have in-house auditors relative 
to a Tier 2 offering) to complete the regulatory require-
ments of a Regulation A+ offering. Early identification of 
skilled legal counsel and accountants will help an issuer 
avoid any early missteps that can poison the Regulation 
A+ journey.
In order to file its offering statement electronically on 
the SEC’s EDGAR system, the issuer will need to select 
a financial printer to “EDGARize” and file the offering 
statement. In addition to legal counsel, accountants, and 
a financial printer, the issuer may need additional third-
party providers, such as transfer agents, escrow agents, 
trustees, and administrators, dependent upon the struc-
ture of its offering.
• 
Selection of type and structure of security to be offered: 
Regulation A+ offers broad flexibility in the type of secu-
rity that may be offered, permitting equity securities,  
debt securities, and securities convertible or exchange-
able into equity (but not asset-backed securities). This 
determination will depend on a balance between the cap-
ital requirements of the issuer and the features necessary 
to make the security appealing to investors. If the plan 
of distribution includes underwriters and/or placement 
agents, they will likely provide substantial assistance in 
structuring the offered securities.

87
Regulation A+
• 
Bad actor review: Prior to embarking on a Regulation A+ 
journey, issuers must take care (and must continue to do so 
during the qualification process) that no members of their 
management team or any person who will be compensated 
for soliciting the securities to be offered—including under-
writers, placement agents, and their management teams 
and registered representative—are subject to the disquali-
fication events set forth in Rule 262 of Regulation A+.  
If a “bad actor” is discovered, the issuer must terminate 
that person, or it will not be eligible to use Regulation A+.
The previous list, as well as other initial determinations, provides the founda-
tion for the preparation and filing of the offering documents, and many can 
be made during and in conjunction with the drafting process. While every 
offering is inevitably different, a general timeframe from beginning to drafting 
the offering documents to qualification with the SEC is between three and six 
months for an issuer engaging in its first Regulation A+ offering.1 This encom-
passes approximately one-two months for due diligence, structuring and 
drafting the initial disclosure documents, and an additional two-four months 
following initial filing of the offering statement to complete SEC review.
While we discuss this more a bit later in this chapter, marketing activities 
through “testing-the-waters” material may begin prior to the submission of 
the first filing with the SEC and may continue throughout the pendency of 
qualification, although issuers must take care with their marketing materials 
as they are subject to the antifraud laws and rules of the federal securities’ 
regime.
For many offerings, qualification with the SEC will not end the regulatory pro-
cess. Regulation A+ permits offerings to be made on a continuous or delayed 
basis (for up to three years under one offering statement, and indefinitely if 
new offering statements are filed). As a result of the smaller nature of the 
companies expected to use Regulation A+ and the lack of a current public 
trading market for Regulation A+ securities, most Regulation A+ offerings are 
not expected to be firmly underwritten. As a result, most will be made on 
a continuous basis until they terminate or until their maximum amounts are 
reached.
During these continuous offerings, an issuer must file an offering statement 
amendment to update the audited financials at least every 12 months, and 
must also file an amendment to reflect any facts or events arising subsequent 
to qualification that would represent a fundamental change in the offering 
1For issuers engaging in follow-on Regulation A+ offerings, there’s some likelihood that the 
SEC review time will be reduced or eliminated based on the SEC’s treatment of follow-on 
offerings to initial registered offerings.

statement. For lesser changes, including the inclusion of pricing information 
for offerings pricing post qualification, the issuer may file an offering circular 
supplement with the SEC. An offering circular supplement containing pricing 
information must be filed within two business days of pricing or its first use, 
whichever is earlier. An offering circular supplement containing substantive 
changes to the offering circular, but not pricing information, must be filed 
within five business days of its first use.
Exhibit: Regulation A+ Offering Process/Sample 
Timeline (Tier 2)
Provided here is a hypothetical timeline for a well-run Tier 2 offering, utilizing an 
underwriter or managing placement agent to form a selling group of broker-
dealers to sell the securities in order to illustrate the process to be expected:
• 
Assembling the team: Securities counsel and auditors 
should be a priority.
Week 1
• 
Letter of intent with underwriter/managing placement agent: 
Selecting an underwriter/managing placement agent (if 
one is to be used) is formalized pursuant to a “letter of 
intent” outlining the investment bank’s fees, the size of the 
offering, the price ranges, and other parameters. These 
deals are currently conducted on a “best-effort” basis.
Commissions and fees to the distribution element reside 
between 7-10% currently. The investment bank/managing 
placement agent will retain 1-2% on total raise, and re-
allow the bulk of the balance to the retail members of the 
syndicate (discussed later in this section).
Week 1
• 
Reviewing and restating the financials: If the company or 
issuer has a financial history, those financial statements 
should be carefully reviewed and, if necessary, restated by 
the company’s current accounting resources to comply 
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). 
This will be necessary for the audited financial presenta-
tions required for Tier 2.
Week 1–3
• 
Selection of transfer agent and printer: The printer will 
handle electronic formatting and filing; the transfer agent 
is necessary for proper record keeping of the securities.

89
Regulation A+
Week 1–2
• 
Preparing the financials: Financials are presented and 
audited in conformance with small reporting company 
reporting requirements of Regulation SX.
Week 2–4
• 
Drafting the offering statement: The securities lawyers 
begin the process of preparing the “offering statement”. 
Lawyers will draft the narrative part of the statement and 
the accountants will prepare financial statements. Both 
work together to ensure that the prose and financials 
“marry” and comply with requirements under Tier 2.
Weeks 1–4
• 
Due diligence: Counsel for the company, as well as per-
haps the issuer’s investment bank and accountants, will 
perform a detailed “due-diligence investigation” of the 
company. It is likely that information discovered in the 
due-diligence investigation will result in changes being 
made to the statement.
Weeks 1–4
• 
Finalizing the marketing plan: Determining which materi-
als will be made available to investors and during what 
period of this process is critical. Your lawyers and the 
investment bank/managing placement agent must under-
stand any regulatory issues now resulting from marketing 
activities.
Week 1–4
• 
Filing the offering statement and SEC review: The initial draft 
of the offering statement is filed with the SEC. It is also 
submitted to FINRA for review of the compensation 
associated with distribution by FINRA member firms. 
This commences a process with the SEC where they pro-
vide comments to the offering statement related primar-
ily to the disclosure in the offering statement. In turn, this 
will likely result in changes to the offering statement to 
accommodate those comments. At the end of this pro-
cess, the offering is “qualified” as an exempt security with 
the SEC and is registered as required in the target states.

Chapter 5 | The Key Elements of a Reg A+ Offering
90
Weeks 4–16
• 
Syndicate: After the offering statement has been prepared 
and filed with the SEC, the underwriter/managing place-
ment agent (if one is to be used) will begin the process 
of assembling a “syndicate” or “selling group” consisting 
of other investment banks, financial advisors, and broker-
dealers who will commit to selling the offering to inves-
tors. The assembly of the syndicate often generates 
useful information as to the market and perhaps changes 
in structure or the investment proposition, which could 
further affect the amendments to the offering statement. 
During this period, the underwriter/managing placement 
agent should identify any changes that need to be fac-
tored into an amendment to the statement.
Weeks 3–16
• 
Marketing: Marketing program to investors may include 
mailings or other forms of mass media marketing, semi-
nars, and meetings with prospective investors. The goal is 
to identify as much as possible the subscribing audience 
for the offering.
Weeks 3–16
• 
Finalizing the offering statement: The offering statement 
must be revised in accordance with the comments of the 
SEC. When the SEC declares the offering “qualified,” the 
company can seek to close subscriptions by investors.
Disclosure and Due Diligence
Fundamental to the filing process for Reg A + and similar other offerings is 
the requirement for full disclosure of materials facts by the issuer—both good 
and bad. These disclosures are not only to the benefit of potential investors 
but also protect the issuer against liability claims that may come about if mate-
rial facts are omitted or misstated. 
Some Initial Concepts
An issuer’s primary disclosure documents in a Regulation A+ offering, whether 
engaging in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 offering, will be the issuer’s offering statement 
filed with the SEC on Form 1-A, and the offering circular included therein. 
Additionally, a Regulation A+ issuer may use marketing materials describing 
its offering, including the testing-the-waters materials, to enhance the issuer’s 

91
Regulation A+
sales efforts. All materials used in offering and selling securities in a Regulation 
A+ offering will be subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities 
laws, including Sections 12(a)(2) and 17 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) 
(and Rule 10b-5 promulgated there under) of the Exchange Act.2 
Merely complying with the requirements of Form 1-A and completing the 
review and qualification process with the SEC does not ensure that an issuer 
has made adequate disclosure under these anti-fraud provisions. Critically, 
the Regulation A+ issuer and its counsel must review the issuer’s business 
and financial plans and ensure that all material facts have been disclosed and 
that no material misstatements or omissions have been made in the issuer’s 
offering materials. Per Rule 10b-5, a fact is material if there is a substantial 
likelihood that an average prudent investor ought to be reasonably informed 
before buying or selling securities. Putting it another way, the investor would 
attach importance in making a decision because the fact would significantly 
alter the “total mix” of available information.
To ensure that all of the material facts make their way into the offering materi-
als, as well as to provide the information necessary to meet the requirements 
of Form 1-A, the issuer and its counsel should engage in a robust due-diligence 
process. Typically, counsel will prepare a due-diligence checklist containing 
requests for documents and narratives from the issuer, and will also prepare 
a questionnaire for the issuer’s management personnel to complete. While 
counsel can assist in the due-diligence process, ultimately the burden is on the 
issuer and its management to provide all documents. If the issuer has engaged 
an underwriter or placement agent, it is likely that the underwriter or place-
ment agent and its counsel will also be heavily involved in the due-diligence 
process.
Documents Related to the Issuer and the Securities 
Offered
While the breadth of change or creation necessary in a Regulation A+ issuer’s 
organic or security documents will vary greatly from issuer to issuer, many 
issuers will require moderate to significant work done to their organic docu-
ments to create the securities intended to be offered. Startup entities making 
equity offerings will likely need entirely new entity documents drafted and 
adopted as they embark on their first serious fundraising efforts, whereas 
seasoned companies with prior investors may be required to achieve prior 
investor or equity holder approval before the proposed Regulation A+ secu-
rities may be issued. All entity documents for the issues, such as Articles 
2Federal Register 17 CFR 230.255 and 17 CFR 270.8b-2(g)

Chapter 5 | The Key Elements of a Reg A+ Offering
92
of Incorporation, Organization or Limited Partnership, Bylaws, Partnership 
Agreements, and Operating Agreements will be required exhibits to the offer-
ing statement.3 Any additional documents that create rights of the holders of 
the offered securities, such as option agreements, warrants, promissory notes, 
indentures, etc., must also be filed.
Additionally, the issuer’s legal counsel will be required to opine as to the legal-
ity of equity securities and the legality and binding nature of any debt securi-
ties. So, it is critical that the governing documents of the issuer, and, in the case 
of a debt offering, the notes, indentures, or other agreements used to offer 
the debt, are thoroughly vetted early in the offering process to ensure that a 
clean legal opinion is delivered.
The Offering Statement
A Regulation A+ offering statement on Form 1-A consists of three parts:
• 
Part I – Notification
• 
Part II – Offering Circular
• 
Part III – Exhibits
Part I
Part I contains basic identifying information regarding the Regulation A+ 
issuer, including name, address, Central Indexing Key (CIK) classification, and 
jurisdiction of formation. Part I also requires certain basic financial informa-
tion regarding the issuer, which differs slightly if the issuer is in the banking 
or insurance industries. Among other descriptive information, an issuer must 
identify whether it is engaging in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 offering, indicate whether 
its financial statements are audited, identify any underwriters or placement 
agents, and indicate whether it is engaging in a firmly underwritten or best 
efforts offering. 
Additionally, the issuer must confirm that it is eligible for Regulation A+ and 
that there are no bad actors involved in its offering. Finally, the issuer must 
indicate any unregistered securities it or any affiliated issuer4 has issued in the 
last year and provide a description of the applicable transaction and exemp-
tion from registration.
3See a further description of the exhibits to the offering statement under “The Offering 
Statement- Part III” later in this chapter.
4Note: In the adopting release for new Regulation A+, the SEC indicated that “affiliated 
issuer” means only affiliates of the issuer who are issuing securities in the same Regulation 
A+ offering, so this should not be confused with the much more broadly defined term 
“affiliates” generally applied to the Securities Act.

93
Regulation A+
Part I must be placed into XML format and submitted on EDGAR with each 
revised submission of Parts II and III.
The chief purpose of Part I is to allow an issuer to determine whether they 
may be eligible to conduct a Reg A+ offering.
Part II
Part II of Form 1-A is the offering circular and it comprises the primary sales 
document in a Regulation A+ offering. In comparing a Regulation A+ offering 
to a registered offering, the offering circular is to the offering statement as a 
prospectus is to a registration statement. 
Part II grants flexibility as to the form an offering circular may take, permit-
ting issuers to utilize the instructions set forth in Form 1-A, or use Parts I of 
Forms S-1 or S-11, to the issuer’s discretion and as applicable to the issuer. 
This is provided that the financial disclosure in a Regulation A+ offering com-
plies with Part F/S of Part II. As the authors are confident that thorough 
descriptions of Forms S-1 and S-11 exist outside the confines of this book 
(also provided at Appendix B of this book), the rest of this description focuses 
on the instructions set forth in Part II of Form 1-A.
The offering circular consists of two parts: narrative disclosure and financial 
statements.
Narrative Disclosure
The requirements of the narrative disclosure portion of the offering circular 
are nearly identical whether the issuer is engaging in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 offer-
ing. Form 1-A divides the required disclosures into 14 items, which, gener-
ally, may be interchanged as to placement in the offering circular so long as 
such movement does not obscure any required information. However, certain 
items, such as the cover page, table of contents, and risk factors are fixed as to 
their placement. Here is a brief description of each of the 14 items.
• 
Item 1–Cover page: Limited to one page only. Basic 
information about the issuer and the offering, including  
(i) identification of any underwriters and disclosure of 
any underwriting discounts, commissions, and other 
items of compensation; (ii) identification of any minimum 
and maximum offering amounts and any escrow or trust 
arrangements; and (iii) the offering termination date in a 
best efforts offering.
• 
Item 2—Table of contents: Must immediately follow the 
cover page.

Chapter 5 | The Key Elements of a Reg A+ Offering
94
• 
Item 3–Summary and risk factors: If the issuer desires to use 
an offering summary, it must be placed directly after the 
table of contents and prior to the risk factors. The sum-
mary may not repeat in detail information found later in the 
offering circular. Risk factors that make the offering specula-
tive or substantially risky must be placed directly after the 
summary. These risk factors must be specific to the issuer.
• 
Item 4–Dilution: Material disparities between the pub-
lic offering price and the effective cash costs for shares 
acquired by insiders during the past year.
• 
Item 5–Plan of distribution: The issuer must describe how 
it plans to sell its offered securities, including provid-
ing descriptions of any underwriting and/or placement 
arrangements and compensation associated therewith. 
Any arrangements with underwriters to restrict the 
resale of securities sold in the offering or otherwise 
stabilize a market in the securities must be included. 
Additionally, if any of the issuer’s existing security hold-
ers are selling in the offering, tabular disclosure regarding 
such selling security holders must be provided.
• 
Item 6—Use of proceeds: This describes in columnar and 
numerical format how the capital raised will be used.
• 
Item 7–Description of business: A narrative description of 
the business operations of the issuer for the prior three 
fiscal years (or, if in existence for fewer than three years, 
since its inception).5
• 
Item 8–Description of Property: The issuer must describe its 
principal properties and physical plants, and any encum-
brances on them.
• 
Item 9–Management’s discussion and analysis of financial 
condition and results of operations: Commonly referred 
to as the “MD&A,” this is a discussion and analysis of 
the issuer’s liquidity and capital resources and results of 
operations through the eyes of management, covering 
the two most recently completed fiscal years and interim 
periods, if required. For issuers that have not received 
revenue from operations during each of the three fiscal

Regulation A+
years immediately before the filing of the offering state-
ment (or since inception, whichever is shorter), the plan 
of operations for the 12 months following qualification 
of the offering statement, including a statement about 
whether the issuer anticipates that it will be necessary to 
raise additional funds within the next six months.
• 
Item 10–Directors, executive officers, and significant employ-
ees: Identification of directors, executive officers, and 
significant employees with a discussion of any family rela-
tionships within that group, business experience during 
the past five years, and involvement in certain legal pro-
ceedings during the past five years. Some of this informa-
tion must be presented in tabular format.
• 
Item 11–Compensation of directors and executive officers: 
Group-level executive compensation disclosure for the 
most recent fiscal year for the three highest paid execu-
tive officers or directors with Tier 2 requiring individual 
disclosure of the three highest paid executive officers or 
directors. This disclosure must be provided in tabular 
format. Additionally, the issuer must disclose any future 
compensation plans for directors and executive officers.
• 
Item 12–Security ownership of management and certain 
security holders: Beneficial ownership of voting securities 
by executive officers, directors, and 10% owners, to be 
presented in tabular format.
• 
Item 13–Interest of management and others in certain trans-
actions: Transactions with related persons, promoters, and 
certain control persons.
• 
Item 14–Securities being offered: The material terms of the 
securities.
The following table provides a summary of these items and how they apply to 
Tier 1 and Tier 2.

Chapter 5 | The Key Elements of a Reg A+ Offering
96

97
Regulation A+
Additional information beyond the requirements of these items may, and in 
some cases will, be required. For example, any offering statement for a tax-
advantaged investment, such as a real estate investment trust, Subchapter-S 
corporation, or entity taxed as a partnership will need significant tax disclo-
sure (as well as a tax opinion from counsel).
Primary responsibility for the narrative portion of the offering circular will fall 
on the issuer and its counsel. If counsel is involved, it will likely control the 
document and engage in the bulk of the substantive drafting; however, certain 
pieces, most notably Item 9 (affectionately known as the MD&A), will fall 
squarely on the issuer. The efficiency of the due-diligence process described 
previously will materially impact counsel’s ability to quickly draft the offer-
ing circular. Should the issuer engage an underwriter, its counsel may also be 
involved in the drafting process for the offering circular and will likely concern 
itself with the offering due diligence, especially in the context of any opinion(s) 
to be delivered at closing.
Part F/S—Your Financial Presentation
Form 1-A requires the same financial statements regardless of the form of 
disclosure chosen by the issuer relative to the narrative disclosure. Regardless 
of whether the issuer is engaging in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 offering, if the issuer 
is a U.S. company, its financial statements must be prepared in accordance 
with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). If the issuer is a 
Canadian company, its financial statements may be prepared either in accor-
dance with U.S. GAAP or the International Financial Reporting Standards.
The instructions to financial statements to be filed in a Tier 1 offering are 
included in Form 1-A, and provide that, generally, the Tier 1 financial state-
ments need not be audited and do not have to conform to Regulation S-X. 
However, if the issuer has audited financials for other reasons (including state 
qualification requirements) and that audit complies with required auditing 
standards and the auditors are independent in accordance with Rule 2-01 of 
Regulation S-X, then that audit must be filed. Additionally, while Regulation S-X 
is generally inapplicable, the instructions often refer to Article 8 of Regulation 
S-X, including with respect to financial statement requirements for business 
combinations or acquisitions of real estate operations.
Financial statements for a Tier 2 offering must be audited, and must, gen-
erally comport with Article 8 (Financial Reporting for Smaller Reporting 
Companies) of Regulation S-X, except with respect to the timing of filing of 
interim financial statements.
Regardless of the offering tier, the issuer must present financial statements for 
its last two fiscal years, provided that if its filing occurs within three months 
of its fiscal year end, the issuer may present financial statements for its two 

Chapter 5 | The Key Elements of a Reg A+ Offering
98
immediately preceding fiscal years. If the issuer files its offering statement 
(or an amendment thereto) more than nine months following its fiscal year 
end, then, in addition to the financial statements for its most recent two fis-
cal years, the issuer must file interim semi-annual financial statements. The 
interim financial statements are not required to be audited whether engaging 
in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 offering.
The required yearly financial statements are: (i) a consolidated balance sheet; 
(ii) consolidated income statement; (iii) consolidated statement of cash flows; 
and (iv) consolidated statement of changes in stockholders’ (or other equity 
holders in the case of non-corporate issuers) equity. When filing interim 
statements, the changes in equity statement may be omitted.
If the issuer has engaged in a significant acquisition of a business or real estate 
operations,6 then the issuer will be required to present additional financial 
statements for the business or real estate operations acquired. Additionally, if 
the acquisition of a business has occurred since the end of the last fiscal year 
for which financial statements are filed, then the issuer must file pro forma 
financial statements in accordance with Rule 8-05 of Regulation S-X.
The preparation of the financial statements will fall first on the issuer itself. In 
order to maintain independence, as required in order to issue a report under 
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, the auditors cannot assist the issuer in the prepa-
ration of the financial statements they are to audit. Therefore, issuers that do 
not have significant in-house accounting and financial capacity will likely need 
additional outside accounting assistance beyond their auditors.
Part III
Form 1-A provides a list of exhibits that must filed with the offering state-
ment. These include: (i) underwriting or placement agreements; (ii) the issuer’s 
organic documents; (iii) instruments containing the rights of the purchasers in 
the offering; (iv) any subscription agreement being used; (v) material contracts; 
(vi) legal opinion(s); (vii) consents of experts named in the offering circular, 
among others; and (viii) any testing-the-waters material.
6As determined under Rules 8-04 and 8-06 of Regulation S-X, respectively.

Regulation A+
Ancillary Information
If the issuer is using an underwriter, the offering statement must also include a 
statement as to whether or not the amount of compensation to be allowed or 
paid to the underwriter has been cleared with the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority (FINRA). Additionally, any expert reports referenced or provided 
for external use from the offering circular must be filed with the SEC.
Filing on EDGAR
The offering statement must be electronically filed through the SEC’s EDGAR 
system. To do so, an issuer must first create its EDGAR identity by submitting 
a Form ID to the SEC. Once in EDGAR, an issuer, or more likely its agents, 
may make filings that comply with EDGAR’s formatting requirements. Getting 
into the EDGAR format will require the services of a financial printer who will 
take the draft offering statement in document format and transform it into a 
format compatible with EDGAR. Typically an issuer will want to transmit the 
offering statement to the printer a few days prior to the anticipated filing date 
in order to give time for a final review and to correct any errors occurring in 
the “EDGARization” process.
An offering statement must be signed by the issuer, its principal executive, 
accounting and financial officers,7 and a majority of the issuer’s board of direc-
tors. Once the offering statement is executed, the financial printer will file it 
on command.
SEC Review Process
Following submission of the initial Form 1-A, the SEC will take approximately 
30 days to review the offering statement and to generate initial comments. 
Absent extraordinary circumstances, an issuer engaging in its first Regulation 
A offering should expect to receive a comment letter from the SEC. Once the 
initial comment letter is received, the process with the SEC becomes much 
more fluid. The issuer and its counsel (and in some cases accountants) must 
provide specific responses to each SEC comment, or must revise the offering 
statement, pursuant to an offering statement amendment, to respond to the 
comment letter. Offering statement amendments are made on the same form 
as the offering statement and will be labeled a Form 1-A/A.
7These could be all one person.

Chapter 5 | The Key Elements of a Reg A+ Offering
100
The SEC will review responses to their initial comments and any subsequent 
comments, as well as any new information in the issuer’s offering statement, 
and may provide additional comment letters.8 Following the initial comment 
letter, the SEC will typically generate comments on a much quicker timeline 
with respect to amendments and responses to their comments; however, the 
exact timeframe is highly dependent on the breadth of initial comments and 
the current workload of the SEC’s staff.
Fortunately, under the new Regulation A+ rules including EDGAR filings, the 
paper filing requirements of old Regulation A+ have finally given way to elec-
tronic filing, which eliminates the time-intensive shipping and intake processes 
with the SEC.9
Ultimately, if a Regulation A+ issuer and its counsel are diligently responding 
to the SEC’s comments, and absent any extraordinary issues with the SEC, the 
issuer should expect the SEC process to take roughly three-four months. Of 
course, if business or other reasons result in the issuer delaying responses to 
the SEC’s comments, then this process may take a significantly longer period 
of time. The SEC may declare an offering statement that has not been quali-
fied or amended within the last nine months to be abandoned, so an issuer 
should be aware not to take too long to respond to SEC comments without 
communicating with the SEC.
Once all SEC comments are resolved and the issuer and its counsel are com-
fortable with the offering statement, the issuer must request qualification of 
the offering statement with the SEC. The SEC staff typically requires 48-hour 
notice to process a request for qualification. Once qualified, the issuer may 
complete sales of its securities.
Marketing
New Regulation A+, in both its Tier 1 and Tier 2 forms, permits broad public 
marketing of securities offering in reliance on the Regulation A+ exemption 
from registration. However, similar to the requirements of a public registration, 
there are limits and requirements surrounding the marketing of a Regulation 
A+ offering to which an issuer must adhere.
8The SEC also reserves the right to comment on disclosure it has previously reviewed.
9In the experience of the authors, the paper-filing requirements of old Regulation A+ 
generated three-four days of delay surrounding each amendment of Form 1-A. That 
delay will be predominantly eliminated in new Regulation A+, making the SEC process in 
new Regulation A+ much more efficient, especially in the latter stages of the SEC review 
process when multiple amendments making very few changes are commonplace.

101
Regulation A+
A Regulation A+ issuer’s marketing requirements differ across the three peri-
ods of the Regulation A+ qualification process delineated by the SEC: (i) pre-
filing; (ii) post-filing and pre-qualification; and (iii) post-qualification.
Pre-Filing
Prior to making the initial filing of its offering statement on Form 1-A, an 
issuer cannot make offers of the securities, but can engage in “testing the 
waters,” meaning an issuer may solicit interest in a proposed offering (and 
ask for communication of that interest, or not) from the public via oral or 
written communication. These types of communication prior to filing must 
include disclaimers indicating that: (i) no money or other consideration is 
being solicited or will be accepted; (2) an indication of interest is no obliga-
tion to purchase; and (3) no offers to buy the securities will be accepted or 
money taken until the qualification of the offering statement. Any offer to 
buy the securities may be withdrawn at any time prior to the issuer’s post-
qualification acceptance of the offer. All written testing-the-waters materials 
must be filed with the SEC once you file for a Regulation A+ offering and, 
like all other offering materials, testing-the-waters materials are subject to 
the SEC’s anti-fraud rules, so a Regulation A+ issuer must carefully review 
any statements regarding its offering or business being made before release 
testing-the-waters materials. Additionally, if the terms of the offering or funda-
mentals of the business described in testing-the-waters materials change prior 
to the closing of the offering, the issuer will be obliged to recirculate revised 
materials and file them with the SEC.
Post-Filing
Once the issuer has filed its initial Form 1-A but prior to its qualification, 
the marketing opportunities expand. An issuer may now make oral offers 
without complying with the testing-the-waters regulations (i.e.: providing the 
disclaimers but, of course, these remain subject to anti-fraud), and may also 
make offers using the preliminary offering circular, which is the Regulation 
A+ equivalent of the red herring in a public registration. Additionally, issuers 
may continue to make written communications under the testing-the-waters 
regulations (including disclaimers), provided that they add information to their 
materials indicating how to request a preliminary offering circular, or a URL to 
the current preliminary offering circular.

Chapter 5 | The Key Elements of a Reg A+ Offering
102
Post-Qualification
Following qualification, offers may be made in a generally unfettered manner 
(subject again to the anti-fraud rules), but any written offer must be accompa-
nied or preceded by delivery of the most up-to-date offering circular qualified 
with the SEC. The new Regulation A+ rules provide generally for an “access 
equals delivery” model for final offering circulars, so issuers and their interme-
diaries can meet their delivery burdens relative to making written offers post-
qualification (and closing sales with investors with whom a pre-qualification 
preliminary offering circular was used) by providing investors with the URL 
location of the final offering circular.
There are a couple of additional critical questions regarding marketing compli-
ance, as follows:
• 
When does the pre-filing period begin? Generally, it begins 
30 days prior to the first filing of the offering statement. 
Communications prior to that period will generally not 
be considered offers, unless they refer specifically to the 
proposed offering. However, if those communications 
would be considered offers during the 30-day period, the 
issuer must take reasonable steps to prevent their further 
distribution or publication during that 30-day period. Any 
communication referencing a proposed securities offer-
ing, even before the 30-day period directly prior to the fil-
ing of the offering statement, may be considered an offer 
by the SEC and should be reviewed by counsel.
• 
What is an “offer”? The definition of offer as used in U.S. 
securities laws is much broader than the everyday defini-
tion of offer, and the SEC has indicated that any publicity 
that may “contribute to conditioning the public mind or 
arousing the public interest” in an offering may be con-
sidered an offer. However, the SEC has indicated that the 
regular dissemination of factual business information that 
does not include predictions or projections regarding 
the issuer’s business or valuation of its securities will not 
constitute an offer for the purposes of Regulation A+. 
This is consistent with the SEC’s approach in registered 
offerings. Ultimately, once an issuer has determined it is 
moving forward with a Regulation A+ offering, all public 
communications should be vetted by counsel.

103
Regulation A+
FINRA Members
Issuers who have engaged or are seeking to engage one or more FINRA mem-
bers (i.e., securities broker-dealers) to market their offerings must be mindful 
of a few additional points. First, an issuer’s negotiations with an underwriter, 
or negotiations among underwriters, regarding the terms of the offering are 
exempt from the definition of “offer”. Secondly, materials used by the under-
writers or other FINRA members to form an offering syndicate (referred to 
as “BD only materials”) are generally not subject to the regulatory require-
ments surrounding marketing materials described previously (although they 
should certainly be reviewed for factual accuracy). Finally, to the extent a 
FINRA member(s) will be involved in public communications using testing the 
waters, the issuer must work carefully with the FINRA member, and its coun-
sel, to ensure compliance with the FINRA rules governing a member’s com-
munications with the public. These FINRA rules are far more burdensome 
than the requirements for testing the waters under Rule 255 of Regulation A+.
Closing/Investor Intake
The SEC has adopted an “access equals delivery” approach to the require-
ments for providing the offering circular disclosure to the investor. This is 
similar to what you would see in a traditional registered offering. Physical 
delivery of the circular is not required if a notice is provided as to where the 
final circular, and all previous filings, can be obtained on the EDGAR site at 
the SEC at the time subscription is made. The investor then has 48 hours to 
rescind the order, ostensibly giving time for review and the ability to withdraw 
if they change their mind.
The subscription form(s) related to a security offered under Regulation A+ 
can be very basic. Many of the representations related to investment intent 
and disclosures—legends related to the securities being restricted and certifi-
cations and informational requests related to accredited investors status such 
as are found in Regulation D offerings—are not required in the Regulation A+ 
context. Tier 1 securities, because of the state regulatory aspects associated 
with them, will typically have some representation to comply with the state 
securities requirements, such as prescribed legends and suitability representa-
tions. But for Tier 2 offerings, the form can really be very basic—outlining the 
amount subscribed for and a representation that the investor complies with 
the rules related to investment caps (discussed in Chapter 5).

Chapter 5 | The Key Elements of a Reg A+ Offering
104
The process of physically bringing the investor in as a stockholder, member, 
limited partner, or noteholder (to name a few) can be very straightforward or 
complicated by such considerations as facilitating trading or holding the secu-
rities in “street name.” However, the latter situations would require the use of 
broker-dealers, and many of the complexities of intake in those situations will 
be designed and handled by them. The most important things for the issuer 
to remember is clear communication of orders by the broker-dealer to the 
issuer, and making sure a copy of the order intake forms are received so that 
the issuer has evidence of the investment cap compliance representations.
Transfer Agents/Escrow
Two other critical aspects of your offering and intake will be establishing an 
escrow for the offering and selecting a transfer agent for securities going 
forward.
If you have contingencies to closing on funds—such as a minimum to be 
reached, or investments being closed upon at only certain time intervals—an 
escrow is mandatory for broker-dealers if you are using them to sell. Even if 
you are not, it’s a wise choice in the circumstances to ensure that funds to 
which you do not necessarily have a right as yet are properly accounted for 
until closed. Remember that the subscriber has a 48-hour period to withdraw, 
so, again, it’s important to make sure no mistakes are made.
A transfer agent is a regulated entity that is charged with essentially keeping 
records of how the securities of an issuer are held—by whom and in what 
amounts. They may provide other services related to the securities, but this 
is their core function, and it is essential when dealing with tradeable securi-
ties. A transfer agent is selected in the creation of your offering and will be an 
integral part of intake to ensure accurate records going forward of securities 
ownership.
Post-Closing /Post-Qualification Obligations
For Tier 1, issuers don’t have any obligations post closing, other than they will 
be required to provide certain information about their Regulation A+ offer-
ings on a new form, Form 1-Z. This is informational to the SEC, however, and 
will not affect the validity of the qualification.
Tier 2 issuers, however, will be subject to an ongoing reporting regime and 
would be required to file:
• 
Annual reports on Form 1-K
• 
Semi-annual reports on Form 1-SA

105
Regulation A+
• 
Current reports on Form 1-U
• 
Special financial reports on Form 1-K and Form 1-SA
• 
Exit reports on Form 1-Z
Form 1-K is required to be filed within 120 calendar days of the issuer’s fiscal 
year end and would require disclosures:
• 
Relating to the issuer’s business and operations for the 
preceding three fiscal years (or since inception if in exis-
tence for fewer than three years)
• 
Related party transactions
• 
Beneficial ownership
• 
Executive officers and directors
• 
Executive compensation
• 
MD&A
• 
Two years of audited financial statements
The semi-annual report is required to be filed within 90 days after the end of 
the first six months of the issuer’s fiscal year and is similar to a Form 10-Q, 
although it’s subject to scaled disclosure requirements.
A current report on Form 1-U must be filed within four business days of the 
triggering event and will be required to announce:
• 
Fundamental changes in the issuer’s business
• 
Entry into bankruptcy or receivership proceedings
• 
Material modifications to the rights of security holders
• 
Changes in accountants
• 
Non-reliance on audited financial statements
• 
Changes in control
• 
Changes in key executive officers
• 
Sales of 10% or more of outstanding equity securities in 
exempt offerings
An exit report on Form 1-Z is required to be filed within 30 days after the 
termination or completion of a Regulation A+ exempt offering.

C h a p t e r 
Raising the 
Capital through 
an Underwriter
Chapter 4 discussed the use of portals and crowdfunding in the context of 
Reg A+. While these may be ultimately very effective methods to raise capi-
tal, they are yet to be proven, and questions remain as to whether they can 
drive traffic to their sites. Furthermore, for issuers looking to create liquidity, 
sources of market expertise are a must. Therefore, issuers must consider 
­seriously the use of an underwriter in their offering process.
This chapter summarizes the roles and responsibilities of the underwriter 
in assisting a firm to raise capital and in setting the stage for successful 
­post-offering share performance.
Underwriters, also known as investment banks, are firms or individuals employed 
by companies (or issuers) that are seeking assistance to sell their shares to 
third-party investors. For larger firms, the buyers of an issuer’s shares may 
in fact initially be the underwriting firm itself, which will resell the shares to 
others, thereby earning a spread between what it paid the issuing firm for its 
shares and what it subsequently receives when reselling its shares.
Smaller firms, such as those contemplating Reg A+ IPOs, will most likely uti-
lize smaller underwriters, who will act as intermediaries and directly sell the 
firms’ shares to predominantly retail investors who are clients of financial 
advisory broker–dealer firms. In some cases, a lead underwriter will enter into 
6

Chapter 6 | Raising the Capital through an Underwriter
108
­agreements with other broker–dealers to syndicate the offering (i.e., create a 
selling group of multiple brokerage firms) in order to generate more visibility 
and create greater demand for the shares.
■
■Tip  The underwriting procedures and processes discussed in this chapter are those typically 
encountered by smaller firms, which are the most likely to benefit from Regulation A+.
Selecting a suitable underwriting firm has been likened to the process of find-
ing a new spouse inasmuch as the relationship between the issuer and the 
underwriter may likely continue for many years into the future and, like a 
normal marriage, have its ups and downs. While there are fact-based criteria 
that are employed to select underwriters—such as relevant industry experi-
ence and number of successful deals done with similar firms as yours—there  
are also considerations of chemistry, compatibility, commitment, and other 
more qualitative and even emotional reasons that will need to be evaluated.
Similarly, underwriters, especially good ones, have no shortage of firms seeking 
their assistance and will be selective in evaluating and finalizing relationships 
with their clients. Like talent agents, underwriters are careful to enter only 
into relationships that are likely to enhance, rather than tarnish, their reputa-
tions. The process of winning over a good underwriter to a deal is much like 
attracting a top investor. Issuers are well advised not to attempt to attract 
underwriters until they are fully prepared to present a compelling story to 
gain their interest.
Role of the Underwriter
Prior to identifying potential investors, the underwriter will conduct due 
diligence on the issuer firm and confirm that all regulatory requirements 
have been fulfilled, including completing all required filings, paying filing 
fees, and making all disclosures required by securities regulations and risk 
considerations. 
Following the substantial completion of due diligence, the underwriter will 
reach out to groups representing retail investors to obtain feedback on open 
questions, general suitability, potential pricing, and to assess overall demand.
For smaller issues, underwriters are typically only willing to commit to raise funds  
on a best-efforts basis. In contrast to a firm commitment to purchase shares, 
which is more common with larger issues in traditional IPOs that have higher 
demand, this type of arrangement will not guarantee that the underwriter 
will be able to raise the full amount of sought-after funds. While best efforts 
are not as attractive to an issuer as a firm commitment, it is the sort of 
­arrangement that should be expected for smaller, lower-priced issues.

Regulation A+
109
But there is a silver lining in that the risk of falling short of fundraising objec-
tives in a best-efforts arrangement encourages the underwriter to syndicate 
the offering in order to increase the number of potential investors who might 
be exposed to the offering. The downside is that the issuing firm cannot rely 
solely on the efforts of the underwriter to source all the funds.
As for the attainment of many key objectives in a smaller firm, the CEO in 
particular should remain deeply immersed and be constantly active in reaching 
out to all possible appropriate sources of funds until the fundraising objec-
tives have been satisfied. Often investors who were not interested in investing 
at the beginning of the fundraising process will step up when they see other 
investors committing to the deal and momentum building. Also, early inves-
tors should be approached before the round closes in an effort to raise more 
money from them due to growing interest.
Finding an Appropriate Underwriter
Smaller Reg A+ offerings are not likely to attract the interest of larger under-
writers such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. These firms have business 
models that reflect their established Wall Street positions and overheads to 
cover that make it impractical for them to consider working with smaller 
firms. The entrepreneur contemplating a Reg A+ offering must focus on find-
ing smaller underwriters who are more flexible and willing to work with 
smaller firms. 
While IPO attorneys, CPAs, and other service firms that deal with smaller  
public offerings can often provide good referrals, we recommend that the 
entrepreneur begin their search efforts by researching firms that have success-
fully underwritten similar-size deals in similar market segments. Fortunately, 
this research can be accomplished quickly and relatively inexpensively using 
the Internet.
Begin by visiting sites that summarize IPO-related information.1 There you 
can find names of underwriters who have been engaged by other firms, and 
through further research you should be able to easily develop a good target 
list.
Once you have identified potential underwriters, it is best that you obtain an 
introduction from a warm referral source—such as a CPA, lawyer, or broker–
dealer who has worked with the firm—to an appropriate contact within the 
firm. Cold calls or e-mails are not likely to achieve the desired results and may 
actually backfire by creating a less-than-optimum first impression that causes 
consideration of your firm to go no further.

Chapter 6 | Raising the Capital through an Underwriter
110
As you begin to collect more data on potential underwriters, keep the 
­following areas in mind:
• 
Past performance with similar-sized offerings
• 
Knowledge of your market
• 
Target investors and distribution channels
• 
Aftermarket support
• 
Compatibility with your firm’s objectives and with you 
and your key executives
Although all five of these areas are important, compatibility often becomes 
the most important discriminator when comparing firms with similar track 
records. Your relationship with the underwriter will likely last far beyond the 
first fundraising event and you need to have mutual respect and trust along 
with lots of patience to achieve optimal results.
You should exhaustively check out all references for each underwriter who 
makes your short list—those provided by the underwriter, as well as those 
that you seek out without their introduction. CEOs and CFOs who have 
recently been through an IPO are often easy to contact and will usually be glad 
to answer your questions about their experiences. Here are some questions 
that you must ask:
• 
Did the firm fully meet your expectations? If not, where 
did they fall short? (No firm will obtain a perfect score 
on this question—so don’t overweigh negative responses 
unless they disclose a strategic weakness that you are 
likely to face.)
• 
How do you assess their knowledge of your products 
and market?
• 
What was their methodology in determining your ­offering 
share price and was it sound?
• 
What was their distribution plan? Did they use other 
firms and, if so, who were they?
• 
Describe their road show.2
• 
Which specific people did you work with and did they 
deliver the expected results? Any communication issues?
2Prior to an offering it is common to go on a grueling whirlwind cross-country tour 
to visit various broker–dealers and sometimes large direct potential investors and give 
presentations on your firm to attract investments. These road shows are orchestrated by 
the underwriter.

Regulation A+
111
• 
How much of your stock performance is attributable to 
their contributions?
• 
Describe their current efforts to support your firm in the 
aftermarket.
• 
All things considered, would you have selected them if 
you knew then what you know now?
The underwriting firm will likely insist on one or more face-to-face meetings. 
Take full advantage of these opportunities and bring your top executives along 
as appropriate. While the CEO often is the center of attention in these meet-
ings, it can be very helpful to expose other key executives to this process for 
both practical and political reasons.
On the practical side, you want to get buy-in from your inner circle that you 
are selecting the best firm for the job and utilize the combined brain power of 
your top execs to evaluate the many options and trade-offs that you will con-
front. You also may want to show off a superstar who might be able to further 
generate investor interest and make the job of the underwriter a bit easier.
On the political side, most top executives want to be intimately plugged into 
discussions with underwriters due to their perception that these decisions 
may impact the valuation of their equity positions. To maintain harmony and 
trust with your executive team, include them when appropriate.
The Letter of Intent
Once you have settled on an underwriter, you will need to finalize the details 
of your engagement. This process starts with receipt of a letter of intent (LOI) 
from the underwriting firm that details the nature of your relationship with 
the firm as well as the terms and conditions of your offering. An LOI typically 
includes the following sections:
• 
Legal Representatives: Identifies attorneys representing the 
underwriter and the issuing firm.
• 
SEC Filing: Confirms the specific filing that will be submitted.
• 
Duties of Underwriter’s Counsel: Summarizes areas that the 
underwriter’s counsel will complete, including specific 
state and federal filings and related fees.

Chapter 6 | Raising the Capital through an Underwriter
112
• 
Offering: Summarizes decisions reaching on the type of 
security to be offered, number of shares (min/max), and 
anticipated price range of the shares. Also covers the 
nature of the underwriter’s performance commitment 
(e.g., best efforts or firm commitment) and the antici-
pated offering date and extension details, and identifies 
the transfer and escrow agents.
• 
Percentage Ownership: Details the number of shares to 
be offered and the anticipated min/max range of post-­
offering stock ownership.
• 
Offering Commencement: Typically states that the public 
offering will be made by the underwriter within three 
business days of the effective date of the qualification.
• 
Future Sales: The issuer affirms that they will not sell any 
additional securities without approval of the underwriter 
for a specified period of time—typically 12 months from 
the effective date.
• 
Mutual Indemnification: Provides for mutual indemnifica-
tion by the underwriter and the issuer covering potential 
liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933.
• 
Questionnaire: Details required information to be ­provided 
by the issuer to the underwriter.
• 
Notice of Litigation: Underwriter and issuer mutually agree 
to inform each other of any litigation or suspension 
actions that may be initiated by regulators.
• 
State Filings: Sets forth states in which required ­documents 
will be filed.3
• 
Adverse Change: Provides that the underwriter may with-
draw efforts if there is an adverse material change in the 
issuer’s business conditions or in the equity markets.
• 
Underwriter Fees: Discloses the range of fees that will be 
paid to the underwriter.
• 
Expense Allowance: Sets the amount of expense reim-
bursement to be paid by the company to the underwriter.
• 
Underwriter Warrants: Details the number of warrants that 
will be given to the underwriter and related terms, if any.
3While Reg A+ is exempt from state blue sky filings, notice filings may still be required.

Regulation A+
113
• 
Right of Refusal: Sets forth the right of the underwriter to 
participate in future fundraising activities.
• 
Registration: Specifies any registrations that the firm must 
complete.
• 
Miscellaneous: Summarizes any material details not cov-
ered in the previous sections. Can include commitments 
by the issuer to not sell assets, change board positions, 
disclosure revenue figures, and so on.
• 
Formal Agreement Contemplated: Confirms that the ­parties 
agree that a final agreement will be concluded and 
­executed prior to the proposed offering date.
The underwriting agreement LOI will also include sections on Reps and 
Warranties, and Covenants.
Reps and Warranties covers guarantees by the issuer that the information 
that is provided to the underwriter is true and accurate as of the date of the 
agreement and that it has completed all of its obligations to file required docu-
ments and pay related feeds.
The Covenants section contains guarantees by the issuer that they will lock 
up—that is, that they will not sell shares for a set period of time (usually 180 
days) after the initial offering date (see “The Lock-Up Period” below).
The Final Underwriting Agreement
The final underwriting agreement will closely mirror the items detailed in the 
LOI and, if firmly underwritten, will also include final stock pricing and the 
number of shares to be issued. Technically, the issuer has the right to back out 
of the offering until the point that the final underwriting agreement is signed. 
In most instances, however, accrued expenses owed the underwriter would 
still need to be paid. 
Pricing the Offering
Unlike larger firms, which can often significantly influence the pricing of their 
shares, the smaller firms that pursue a Reg A+ public offering will need to 
accept pricing that is largely set by market receptivity—i.e., how effectively 
the strength of their story drives demand for their shares. Regardless of the 
desires, wishes, and needs that the issuing firm may have, the pricing process 
will be controlled by the underwriting firm and its interpretation of feedback 
from its client base on share prices that are most likely to result in a successful 
IPO—i.e., one that meets the issuing firm’s minimum fundraising objectives.

Chapter 6 | Raising the Capital through an Underwriter
114
The process of setting a share price is often called book building and refers to 
efforts by the underwriter to gather feedback from broker–dealers, interme-
diaries, and key investors to determine a share price that will be most likely to 
raise minimum amount of funds sought by the issuing firm.
While it may sound intuitive that a higher initial price is better than a lower 
price, there is a downside to setting a share price that is too high. The risks 
are higher that 1) the total funds raised will actually be less since not as many 
shares will be purchased and 2) the stock price may drop in the aftermarket, 
thereby weakening the perceived attractiveness of the firm for some time.
A good example of this that still sticks in the minds of many investors was 
the overpricing of Facebook’s IPO in 2012. Within 90 days of its IPO, share 
prices had dropped from an opening price of $38/share to $18.75/share—a 
loss of over 50% and billions of dollars of value. While Facebook stock has 
since positively corrected, this huge loss of value (dubbed the “Faceplant”) still 
haunts perceptions of the firm.
Drawing an analogy from the traditional IPO market, most entrepreneurs and 
investors wish to see their stock rise after an IPO, and the common wisdom 
is therefore to set an opening price at the lower end of the anticipated trading 
range even if that means that “something is left on the table.”
■
■Tip  When liquidity and equity appreciation are significant objectives of your Reg A+ offering, 
the ability of the underwriter firm to consistently realize its share price expectations is one of the 
most important areas that should be investigated when you conduct due diligence. Similarly, 
an entrepreneur should not select an underwriter solely on the basis of the share price that the 
underwriter suggests it could deliver.
The Lock-Up Period
A universal provision in the underwriting agreement for offerings of tradable 
securities is the requirement that employees and executives refrain from sell-
ing their shares until a sufficient amount of time passes to allow the share 
price to stabilize in the secondary market. In traditional IPOs, the minimum 
lock-up period required is 90 days but can be as long as two years. Many 
investors closely watch the end of the lock-up period for new issues in an 
actual IPO, because a significant increase in selling by insiders frequently takes 
place immediately after the lock-up period ends, causing the share price to 
decline—sometimes significantly. The conditions for this dynamic apply in the 
Reg A+ world, as well. Such price declines are often temporary, and good 
forward planning can mitigate a decline by timing the release of good news  
(e.g., strong earnings) just ahead of the end of the lock-up.

Regulation A+
115
Aftermarket Pricing
The Reg A+ secondary market is still developing, but many of the consider-
ations applicable to truly public smaller companies with lower trading volumes 
may be extrapolated to Reg A+ issuers. Smaller companies face significant 
challenges in obtaining third-party coverage to attract investors to purchase 
shares of their stock. Also, because the number of traded shares of a smaller 
firm will represent relatively low amounts of value, even moderately sized  
buy/sell orders can swing the price quite significantly, creating undesirable 
volatility in the firm’s stock price. This is not an easy problem to solve and 
requires that the issuing firm have a solid financial public relations plan in place 
prior to going public. The primary objective of this public relations plan is to 
release ongoing information about the firm that will aid in maintaining and 
increasing the value of the firm’s shares. 
This is a complex topic to address, and a comprehensive discussion of the 
effective strategies used to bolster share prices of smaller firms is outside the 
scope of this book. Here, however, are some generalities:
• 
Once a smaller firm completes its offering, the CEO must 
devote more time to investor relations and plan to invest 
efforts each week to reach out to analysts, intermediar-
ies, and other outside parties who can positively influ-
ence favorable interest from retail investors to purchase 
the firm’s stock. Many CEOs fall short of the challenges 
of effectively communicating with outside parties. They 
should seek critical inputs from their financial PR firm to 
make sure that adequate energies are being expended.
• 
Once a firm completes a Tier 2 offering, it will be required 
to file public reports of its ongoing operations and finan-
cial performance. The issuer shall consider whether the 
CEO will deliver a summary of the past reported per-
formance and provide guidance to interested parties, 
including current investors, broker–dealers, and indus-
try analysts, among others. The worst thing to report 
on during these conference calls is a “miss” in achieving 
expected financial objectives. Meeting or beating expec-
tations should therefore be the top priority in order to 
keep share prices in a desired range.

Chapter 6 | Raising the Capital through an Underwriter

• 
The use of the Internet should be fully exploited to enhance 
the public image of the firm. This starts by having and (very 
importantly) maintaining a current web site that looks at 
least as good as your top competitor’s. It also includes 
extensive use of social media, including Facebook, Twitter, 
LinkedIn, and so on. News articles on the site need to be 
plentiful and up to date. Having a blog that covers both 
company and industry topics will help the web site move up 
the rankings of search engines. Effective search engine opti-
mization strategies should be employed to ensure that web 
searches on topics related to the firm will tend to pull up 
the firm page’s URL. Finally, coordinate content that is pub-
lished on your web site with legal reporting and compliance 
so that all updates are current and comply with the law.
The Dutch Auction
Noted venture capitalist Bill Hambrecht has updated and revamped an alter-
native method for setting stock prices that merits consideration. 
Originally conceived as a means of selling tulips in Holland, the Dutch auction 
has been successfully utilized by Hambrecht’s firm, WR Hambrecht, to raise 
public funds for firms ranging from Boston Beer to Google.
Hambrecht’s form of the Dutch auction, branded as “OpenIPO”, starts in a 
manner similar to what is described in “The Letter of Intent” section earlier 
in this chapter, such that an investment banker prepares much of the legal 
documentation along with an analysis of a potential pricing range. However, 
the final pricing of the public offering is set by the marketplace and not by the 
investment banker. In contrast to a traditional auction in which pricing starts 
low and gradually increases due to competitive bidding, the Dutch auction 
begins with setting the highest expected price. Interested investors then place 
online bids for a specified number of shares at prices that are lower than the 
opening price. Bidding is closed when the full amount of capital is raised and 
all bidders ultimately pay the same lowest per share price that is required to 
raise the desired equity.
Proponents of the Dutch auction argue that firms can save additional monies 
that would otherwise be paid to investment bankers. Bankers typically earn 
7% of the amount of the offering for selling a deal to their clients, so these 
selling fees can be very significant. Another argument is that a Dutch auction 
minimizes the price swings that often occur during the first days of trading 
relative to large swings that occur when prices are set by investment bankers. 
Average first day gains for 25 of Hambrecht’s IPOs utilizing the Dutch auction 

Regulation A+
117
averaged 3.1%.4 By contrast, first-day gains for traditionally-priced firms tend 
to be much higher. For example, prices were up 73% on Twitter’s first day and 
109% on LinkedIn’s first day. Dutch auction supporters point out that because 
such gains in the secondary market largely go to investors and not to the 
issuers, they may be considered as funds that could have been realized by the 
issuing firms if they had utilized the Dutch auction.
Fans of the traditional investment banker approach emphasize that their pro-
cess results in more orderly price setting and also better educates investors 
on the merits of the firm’s offering, its competition, and long-term prospects. 
More than 99% of all IPOs are completed using traditional price-setting pro-
cesses utilized by investment bankers. The Dutch auction and other novel 
methods of fundraising clearly face an uphill battle to gain more adherents. 
Still, for smaller companies that have an established track record and a client 
base that may be interested in investing in them, the Dutch auction is worth 
some exploration.

C h a p t e r 
Post-IPO 
Activities
After filing a Reg A+ mini-IPO, a company needs to address additional respon-
sibilities in the areas of accounting, reporting, and investor relations. This 
chapter covers the basics of what lies ahead after the funds have been raised, 
including a number of best practices that we have observed in smaller firms.
Accounting and Reporting
Firms that have raised funds under Tier 2 of Reg A+ need to prepare for 
greater financial and reporting scrutiny that will be required by investors and 
governmental entities. Failure of firms to comply with regulations in a timely 
and complete manner can lead not only to a loss of credibility with investors 
but can (i) jeopardize many of the benefits of Tier 2 (e.g., carve-outs from Rule 
12) or their ability to conduct further Reg A+ offerings; and (ii) substantially 
and negatively impact the market value of the securities held by investors. Any 
sloppiness or lack of attention to detail needs to be identified and eliminated 
so that a disciplined process can be established that becomes part of the firm’s 
culture. Ideally, the processes that must be in place after a successful Reg A+ 
fundraising effort were planned and anticipated as part of the overall fundrais-
ing strategy. The key accounting and reporting areas that need to be reviewed 
and improved as needed include the following:
• 
Tracking and reporting financial changes per SEC 
guidelines.
• 
Closing period financials in a timely and complete manner.
7

Chapter 7 | Post-IPO Activities
120
• 
Ensuring that the firm has experienced personnel who 
fully understand steps that need to be taken to comply 
with SEC accounting and reporting requirements.
• 
Assessing whether the organization has adequate capa-
bilities to accurately project future expectations so that 
the firm’s executives will not lose credibility with inves-
tors and analysts.
• 
Making sure that adequate IT infrastructure is in place to 
prevent loss of critical data.
At a minimum, the firm must have access to a qualified CPA who understands 
GAAP financial statements and the reporting requirements under Reg A+. 
This is not a job to be delegated to a bookkeeper or a recent graduate. 
Several best practices include:
• 
Use professional financial software systems such as 
QuickBooks rather than Excel.
• 
Institute frequent reviews by the management and the 
CPA of financial operations and statements to catch 
errors and omissions.
• 
Organize all financial data in an electronic repository that 
can be quickly accessed and has adequate backup protec-
tions in case of infrastructure failures.
• 
Move to a professional payroll service and pay all required 
payroll taxes on time.
• 
Keep close track of any required sales taxes, registration, 
and regulatory fees. Failure to remain current on these 
items can result in personal liability to management and 
impact investors’ value.
• 
Document all critical decisions and contracts—no more 
handshake agreements.
• 
Keep detailed minutes of all board meetings and keep 
corporate counsel aware of all significant corporate 
actions and decisions.
Many small firms may also need to hire a chief finance officer (CFO) who has 
prior experience with required SEC reporting and filings. Rather than hiring 
a full-time CFO to supervise new accounting and reporting activities, firms 
might retain a part-time CFO to avoid the added costs of an additional full-

time executive. In most larger metro areas, there are placement agencies that 
specialize in assisting firms to locate part-time finance executives who have 
adequate experience.1
Dos and Don’ts of Shareholder Recordkeeping
The opportunities created by the JOBS Act are exciting for issuers seeking to 
raise capital, but its provisions provide additional shareholder recordkeeping 
challenges for the issuers.
Reg A+ provisions permit an issuer to avail itself of the exemptions afforded 
by the Securities Act of 1933, but only if the issuer stays within float or reve-
nue limitations and—more importantly for this discussion—employs a profes-
sional transfer agent registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
Accurate records of shareholder ownership and the efficient processing of 
transactions are essential for investors. An issuer’s failure to accurately record 
or maintain shareholder records (including address changes) or to prevent 
fraudulent transfers can have the same devastating effect on an investor as 
if his or her savings were stolen or misdirected through fraud. It is for this 
reason that Congress and the SEC have continued to recognize the essential 
importance of registered transfer agents for public securities.
In recent years, changes in the regulatory landscape have significantly expanded 
the recordkeeping burden. New IRS reporting requirements—most notably 
those associated with cost basis reporting, passed as part of the Emergency 
Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and effective since the 2011 tax year—
have created a virtual minefield of obstacles for issuers and investors. Now 
issuers and shareholders must keep cost basis information on a lot-by-lot 
basis for all securities purchased and sold and report it to the IRS.
Moreover, issuers and their record keepers must comply with the relevant 
abandoned property/escheatment laws of all 50 states. Issuers are required 
to keep track of all contacts (such as letters, address changes, telephone con-
tacts, deposited checks, and returned mail) for each and every holder. All con-
tacts must be noted to the shareholder’s account. In three-year states such 
as California and New York, the issuer must mail notification to any holder 
with whom no contact has been noted for three years that the shareholder’s 
shares or funds will be escheated to the state as abandoned unless the share-
holder updates the account.

So the question arises: What is an issuer to do when confronted with the 
daunting task of keeping shareholder records compliant with IRS reporting 
rules and the abandoned property rules of all 50 states? The simple and cor-
rect answer is that the issuer must hire a professional transfer agent with 
the systems and expertise to manage its records. The customary rule in the 
industry is that if an issuer has more than 75–100 holders of record, then the 
account should be serviced by a transfer agent.
Professional transfer agents have sophisticated systems, software, and person-
nel who are expert in all facets of recordkeeping. Stock ledger recordkeeping 
is a highly technical and specialized area. Small issuers often try to utilize their 
lawyers or accountants for this task, but that is very unwise. Lawyers and 
accountants do not have the expertise to handle the task, and they are likely 
to cost $100–500 per hour (even for paralegal time). By contrast, professional 
transfer agents typically charge small private companies $200–300 per month 
for supplying expert services in this very complicated field.
In the normal course of their everyday handling tasks, professional trans-
fer agents keep and update individual shareholder accounts (including name, 
address, social security number, number of shares, certificate number, date of 
issuance, cost basis by lot, seasonal addresses, and restrictions on transfer), and 
they keep company-wide records, including geographical records, share range 
analysis, restricted shares, and plan shares. Professional transfer agents also track 
abandoned property rules of the 50 states as they apply to all shareholders, and 
they will do the requisite lost-shareholder due diligence searches and ultimately 
escheat property to all 50 states. Transfer agents do all this in the normal course, 
and they do so efficiently and economically. Lawyers and accountants do not.
The costs associated with not having a professional transfer agent as an issu-
er’s recordkeeper are likely to be very high. First, errors in an issuer’s records 
can lead to the wrong person receiving a record owner’s shares; or the record 
owner may receive the wrong number of shares altogether. Such errors may 
expose the issuer to significant monetary liability and litigation risk, including 
legal fees. This is particularly problematic when companies undergo forward 
or reverse splits, which may obscure errors and magnify exposure. Second, 
poor recordkeeping and shoddy communications with core investors expose 
the issuer to reputational risk. Third, confidential shareholder information, 
including address and social security number, may be disclosed unwittingly 
or may be vulnerable to data breaches when the records are not held in the 
secure environment that is provided by a highly regulated registered transfer 
agent, particularly a bank agent.

Regulation A+
123
An issuer’s shareholder records, if not properly secured, will subject the issuer 
to the liability associated with identity theft of its shareholders. Both federal 
and state “red flag” laws impose significant restrictions and penalties for data 
breaches resulting in identity theft of shareholders’ personal information. This 
exposure is far from hypothetical: the news media over the past five years 
have reported innumerable data breaches costing public companies untold bil-
lions of dollars. The dangers are real and can prove very painful and damaging 
to an emerging company.
Titles II and III of the JOBS Act have already incorporated a requirement 
that issuers and funding portals use “banks” or registered brokers as escrow 
agents to ensure proper recordkeeping and minimize the risk of defalcation. 
Likewise, Title II and III issuers must certify to funding platforms that they have 
established adequate means to maintain accurate records, and the funding 
platform must have a “reasonable basis” to believe the same. The commis-
sion’s recent release of the Reg A+ rules goes one step further for Tier 2 
offerings: issuers for Tier 2 offerings must use a registered transfer agent to be 
exempt from registration under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The message 
for JOBS Act issuers is clear: retain a professional agent where required and 
proceed at your own peril if you decide not to do so where not specifically 
required, as with Tier 1 offerings.
Digitized Recordkeeping
As market professionals are aware, there has been a concerted effort since 
the 1980s to move away from certificated shares and ownership to electronic 
recordkeeping a book-entry ownership. This process has been called dema-
terialization or demobilization and has been a central tenet of the SEC’s move 
to make the Clearance and Settlement System more efficient and less subject 
to risk.
The creation and expansion of the Depository Trust Company (DTC) has led 
to dematerialization of all shares held for shareholders by banks and brokers 
(“street name shares”), which now comprise well more than 80% of all shares 
held in U.S. publicly traded securities. The remaining 20% or less are shares 
registered on the books of the issuer—either certificated or book-entry—
and registered in the name of the owner.
The push for dematerialization of publicly-traded shares has come from both 
the SEC and DTC on behalf of its bank and broker ownership. Indeed, book-
entry eligibility of all U.S. exchange traded issues became mandatory in January 
2009, under a system called mandatory DRS. As a result, all such securities 
were dematerialized so that book-entry statements were henceforth issued 
to holders in lieu of physical stock certificates. Book-entry ownership has also 
been the default position for all dividend reinvestment plans and employee 
stock option plans for many years.

Chapter 7 | Post-IPO Activities
124
In this dematerialized environment, both “street” holders and “registered” 
holders are accustomed to receiving book-entry statements reflecting their 
share ownership and can engage in purchases and sales just as they would in 
a certificated environment—only more efficiently. Accordingly, both institu-
tional holders and individual investors have been used to book-entry owner-
ship for many years.
Why then, you might ask, have many (if not most) private companies—even 
those high-tech companies originating in Silicon Valley—continued to issue 
stock certificates to investors rather than moving to book-entry ownership? 
This is strange indeed given that these titans of tech are often promoting 
technology companies whose investors include well-known venture funds and 
private equity titans. While some of these companies (and their lawyers and 
accountants) have seen the light, most still issue physical stock certificates to 
investors, which seems an anachronistic and archaic practice.
Certificated shares make no sense at all in this day and age, and the concept 
of keeping paper stockholder records is inconsistent with Reg A+, which is 
philosophically focused on reducing barriers for smaller firms. Certificated 
shares have the following major disadvantages: they lead to lost certificates, 
which can be difficult and expensive to replace; they must be called in and re-
presented to the issuer for reverse splits or other recapitalization events; and 
they must be called in for re-legending of Securities Act legends, affiliate leg-
ends, or other contractual restrictions that must be affixed to the securities.
In the case of lost certificates, replacement generally requires the shareholder 
of record to submit an affidavit of loss and indemnity and often a surety 
bond, which can cost 2–3% of the value of the lost securities. This is often 
a significant hassle and can lead to confrontations and complaints from key 
early-stage investors. All of these issues simply disappear with a book-entry 
statement, which can be easily replaced without any of these requirements.
Digitized, book-entry positions mimic tried-and-true models that have been 
used by the most advanced and sophisticated public companies in the DRS 
settlement system as well as DRP and DSPP models. They are used every day 
by tens of millions of records and beneficial owners. It makes absolutely no 
sense for emerging companies, many in the high-tech world, to issue physical 
stock certificates rather than book-entry positions. Using book-entry also 
sends the right message to key investors and to market professionals, and will 
facilitate as well any ultimate-exit strategy, whether it be a sale or an IPO.
In getting ready for a Reg A+ mini-IPO, the well-prepared issuer will not only 
move to book-entry ownership, but they should likely outsource their record-
keeping to a professional stock transfer agent with the expertise and systems 
to assist them. A transfer will likely cost far less than lawyers’ and accoun-
tants’ time, and they will ensure that your records are kept in a secure and 
digitized environment. This will make the transition from a private company 

Regulation A+
125
to a public company via an IPO a seamless one—no last-minute panic attacks, 
calling in old certificates, processing recaps and stock splits, or affixing restric-
tive legends. A foresighted company will have digitized and outsourced its 
records to avoid such last-minute nightmares.
An additional significant advantage of book-entry prior to an IPO is that sell-
ing shareholders and their attorney-in-fact will not have to hunt for certifi-
cates and replace lost securities. Book-entry avoids all of that needless hassle 
and confusion, and selling shareholders—often key employees and early-stage 
investors—will be well served.
For private companies that grow large but choose to remain private (such as 
Uber, Dropbox, Xiaomi, and Airbnb), the move to digitized recordkeeping and 
a professional transfer agent is equally important, if not more so. Companies 
such as these often have raised capital in many rounds or series of offerings. 
They also generally have many employees and executives who are equity own-
ers because their compensation is often based in significant part on stock 
options and grants as well as restricted stock units. The recordkeeping for 
these highly capitalized private companies is often kept by lawyers, stock plan 
administrators, and in-house personnel. However, whether you use a profes-
sional transfer agent or a combination of lawyers, stock plan administrators, 
and in-house personnel, the records should absolutely be maintained in a 
secure, digitized, and book-entry environment.
A centralized book-entry platform will allow investors, including venture firms 
and private equity firms, to access their holdings via the Internet 24/7 using a 
simple PIN code. For venture and private equity firms that have many portfo-
lio companies or investments in many private issuers, the use of one central-
ized book-entry platform—i.e., one stock transfer agent—will allow them to 
access all of their holdings anytime and anywhere. No more certificates being 
held in the venture of PE firm’s vault, and no more needless audits. Digitized, 
book-entry recordkeeping is clearly the right answer for these large private 
companies and their investors.
Additionally, one of the great hopes for the JOBS Act is that a secondary trad-
ing market will develop for Reg A+ issuers. Once Reg A+ secondary trading 
markets do indeed develop and succeed, you can be sure that they will oper-
ate in a totally digitized and book-entry environment. If that is the case, any 
and all private (or public) issuers who wish to trade on these exchanges will 
benefit greatly if they have planned ahead and moved to book-entry at the 
earliest possible stage.
Moreover, when secondary trading markets develop, the ultimate hope is that 
such markets would link to the brokerage community via a Depository Trust 
and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) interface. In this way, the buy side and the 
sell side could be truly linked together in a functional way to allow for full 
monetization and ease of processing. That is the hope. Whether it comes to 
pass remains to be seen.

Chapter 7 | Post-IPO Activities
126
Regardless of the success or failure of secondary trading markets, the advan-
tages of digitized, book-entry recordkeeping for all private companies are 
clear and obvious, as laid out. A forward-thinking private issuer as well as its 
lawyers, accountants, and other advisors should move to such an environment 
as soon as possible to minimize risk and promote efficiency and connectivity 
in line with current technological advances.
Having covered important basics related to accounting, reporting, and record 
keeping, let us now shift to how small firms should plan to interact with their 
investors and other key industry groups to maintain interest and value in their 
shares.
Investor Relations for Reg A+ Firms
One of the most challenging aspects of raising public funds for a small company 
is the need to maintain appropriate communications with the firm’s investors 
after funds have been raised. The opinions that investors hold about firms in 
which they have committed capital can be as important as perceptions that 
customers have about the firm’s products and services. Investors who become 
unhappy with a firm’s performance can publish unfavorable comments on any 
number of financial web sites that can be just as damaging to a firm’s reputa-
tion as negative comments from customers.
Furthermore, unhappy investors can make it much more difficult for a firm to 
raise future funds, as new investors can be expected to look at past perfor-
mance before committing fresh funds. Unfortunately, we see too many small 
firms forgetting about investors after they have obtained funding and suc-
cumbing to the temptation to focus solely on the challenges of growing the 
business rather investing appropriate time communicating with investors.
The remainder of this chapter covers a number of techniques used by smaller 
firms to develop and maintain good investor relations. At the onset it is worth 
noting that smaller firms have significantly greater challenges than larger firms, 
owing to the much smaller number of outside parties who may have interest 
in writing about ongoing developments. If you put the name of a larger firm 
such as Apple, Facebook, or Tesla into a daily Google search, you will find many 
articles and comments from third parties. By contrast, smaller firms rarely 
receive mention from third parties and instead need to rely almost solely on 
the communications that are directly developed by the firm’s executives or 
their investor relations firm.
While we know of many CEOs who are excellent communicators and can 
easily compose content about their companies, we believe that smaller firms 
can benefit by hiring a third-party investor relationships (IR) specialist. A good 
IR specialist can institute a disciplined approach that can allow a firm to allo-
cate and balance resources between the needs of growing the business and of 

Regulation A+
127
communicating with investors. He or she will also provide the firm with valu-
able insights on the practices of competitors and introductions to key centers 
of influence that can further build the firm’s reputation.
Investor versus Customer Communication
It is natural and common for key executives to develop skills for communicat-
ing with customers. Indeed, the top executives in a small firm and especially 
the CEO are often the most effective sales people. The skills and techniques 
used for selling products and services to customers are in many ways similar 
to communicating with investors, but they differ in a number of important 
respects. Selling is fundamentally about convincing customers that they will 
derive benefits in acquiring products and services that are perceived to be 
more valuable than the funds used to make the purchase. The foundation of 
good investor relations is primarily about how effectively the firm performs in 
meeting or exceeding previously set financial expectations.
Many executives who are skilled in selling products fall short when they are 
put in a position to communicate and are held accountable for financial objec-
tives. While it is common and even acceptable for a sales pitch to contain 
some level of exaggerated claims of benefits and hyperbolic language (“This is 
insanely great!”), this style will quickly destroy investor communications.
In contrast to selling, investor communications need to be tempered and 
unemotional, emphasizing facts and accomplishments and setting future guid-
ance on reasonable extrapolations of past results. Let’s break down the criti-
cal components of a comprehensive IR communication, beginning with those 
areas that are similar to the points emphasized during the fundraising process.
Strategy
Investors prefer that a firm’s strategy remain consistent unless new facts come 
to light that can result in greater success through modest course corrections. 
Sudden unexpected changes in direction cause investors to become nervous 
and lose confidence. Strategy changes should be announced by first restating 
the former strategy and then describing the new facts that require changes. 
Strategy changes are best explained in terms of new data that has been uncov-
ered, as opposed to admissions that the firm’s executives made mistakes in 
setting forth the previous strategy. While there are many wise sayings that 
praise the virtue of admitting one’s mistakes, investors will lose faith in a CEO 
who too frequently admits he or she was mistaken.
To summarize: be consistent, make only incremental changes based on new 
facts, and go easy on admitting mistakes.

Chapter 7 | Post-IPO Activities
128
Track Record
Once investors contribute capital to an enterprise they will tend to focus 
more on how actual results compare with previous expectations and less on 
future expectations. Examples of this abound during earnings announcements 
for publicly traded companies. An earnings shortfall of even a few pennies can 
sometimes have a large negative impact on stock values, even in spite of what 
the firm says about positive expectations for the next quarter. CEOs who 
consistently miss expectations can expect to have short job tenure unless 
they possess unusually strong offsetting skills and abilities.
A good IR strategy includes ongoing messages in the form of “here is what 
we said we would do, and here is what we actually did that met or bettered 
previously set expectations.” In other words, foster a corporate culture and 
style of communication whereby you strive to undercommit and overdeliver.
Profits Matter
While operational successes such as product releases, new customers, awarded 
patents, clinical trials, approvals, and certifications are all very important, a 
firm’s financial results are even more important to investors, and profit growth 
is the most important number. Firms that have not yet become profitable 
must strive to disclose plans and results that demonstrate how their financial 
performance is trending toward breakeven and beyond to profitability.
While there are extended cycles when investors are swayed by nonfinancial 
metrics such as eyeballs, users, subscribers, and likes, such ebullient times are 
always followed by market corrections that cause investors to refocus on 
fundamentals. And making profits—or at least making tangible progress in 
that direction—is the most important fundamental that investors care about.
The ability of a firm to achieve a breakeven cash flow position is most critical 
for smaller firms. Investors will face a dilution of their interests if cash runs out 
and a new round of capital is needed. Unless earlier investors are willing to 
contribute additional funds, new investors in a subsequent funding round will 
gain ownership at the expense of the previous investors. While seed inves-
tors will typically expect that additional funds will need to be raised to achieve 
growth objectives, later-round investors will typically expect their capital to 
be the last capital needed to take a firm to breakeven.
Most CEOs—especially if their core competency is in nonfinancial areas such 
as engineering—are well advised to have their CFOs involved in key investor-
related communications. A tag-team CEO–CFO approach when communicat-
ing with investors has the added benefit of demonstrating solidarity among 
top executives in the firm’s vision and direction.

Regulation A+
129
Corporate Web Site
Today the corporate web site is the most common and important means of 
establishing and maintaining a corporate identity and, for better or worse, it 
creates strong impressions that influence investor perceptions. A top objec-
tive in your IR strategy is to create and maintain a very professional and cur-
rent web site. The days of “set-it-and-forget-it” web sites have long passed, 
and modern web sites must be constantly maintained and updated (at least 
monthly) with the latest news and other content, often including a blog in 
which the CEO can provide content in a more conversational and informal 
style. The web site also should include a discrete “For Investors” area con-
taining links to the firm’s public disclosures and contain other information 
appropriate for investors.
Reg A+ allows electronic filings to EDGAR, a web site hosted by the SEC 
where investment disclosures are posted for public viewing. Links to these 
documents on the EDGAR web site are often added to the “For Investors” 
section of the firm’s web site.
The content on the corporate web site as well as postings made to social media 
such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube may be subject to numerous 
SEC regulations. As an example, Regulation FD, often referred to as the Fair 
Disclosure Regulation, requires that whenever issuers disclose material nonpub-
lic information to certain individuals or entities—such as securities market 
professionals, stock analysts, or groups that may trade the firm’s stock based 
on the disclosed information—the issuer must make a full public disclosure of 
that information. Regulation FD aims to promote the full and fair disclosure 
to minimize special advantages that certain groups or entities can gain over 
average investors who may otherwise not have access to the same information.
Due to the many regulations that govern public disclosures, many firms as a 
best practice have their corporate counsels review content before posting 
online to ensure compliance.
Media Relations
In addition to frequent direct communication to investors, an effective IR 
strategy must utilize mass communications via print and electronic media, 
as well as ongoing communications and interactions with various trade and 
industry organizations. Organizing this effort is the primary role of an investor 
relations firm, and a good firm will develop a detailed calendar of activities that 
can fully take advantage of key media opportunities.
It is very important to develop and stick to a discipline of investing some time 
each week to leverage media channels to deliver information about your firm. 
Like many ideas that start with the best of intentions only to run out of steam, 

Chapter 7 | Post-IPO Activities

small firms must attend to the important job of cultivating media exposure in 
order to build interest in their firm that will ultimately lead to higher values 
for its traded shares.
CEOs of smaller firms would be especially well advised to attend investment 
conferences where similar companies deliver presentations about their plans 
and progress to groups of brokers and bankers.2 Some well-known confer-
ences for smaller firms are hosted by the following organizations:
www.sidoti.com
www.redchip.com
www.marcumllp.com
www.ldmicro.com
www.onemedconferences.com
Smaller firms are usually charged a fee of several thousands of dollars to 
present at these conferences—and individuals representing brokers, banks, 
or investors are often allowed to attend at very low or no cost. This encour-
ages a larger audience for the presenting firms and a greater likelihood that 
firms will have success in meeting interested parties who can help them attain 
financial objectives. There is merit in attending these conferences even as an 
observer if you feel you are not yet ready to present; you will learn a great 
deal about the networking process and be able to make a better showing 
when you are ready.
Cultivate Analysts
An important milestone is reached when third parties begin to take an interest 
in publishing reports about a firm. It is not uncommon that the value of small 
firm’s stock can take a significant jump when a professional analyst announces 
that they are beginning to cover or periodically report on the firm. Many 
firms struggle with locating and then cultivating relationships with professional 
analysts. The easiest way to learn who to target is first to identify all larger 
firms similar to your own and then determine which analysts are covering 
them. If you do not find any initially, just keep looking for firms that are larger 
in sales volume and you will soon learn who to go after. Attending industry 
conferences—particularly those that attract investment bankers and venture 
capitalists—can also provide excellent networking opportunities and increase 
your odds of establishing a relationship with a qualified analyst. Obviously, also 
seek introductions from attorneys, accountants, and other industry executives 
with whom you have good relations.

In parallel to efforts to reach professional analysts, smaller firms should invest 
time developing a following among lesser-known industry analysts, due dili-
gence providers, and commentators who publish on the web part-time as 
an avocation rather than on a full-time professional basis. Perhaps the best 
source of locating these individuals is the web site www.SeekingAlpha.com. 
This site attracts thousands of individuals and industry experts who write 
about mostly smaller firms. The quality of the content varies considerably 
but, at its best, many of these writers provide commentaries that equal those 
produced by full-time professional analysts. We have direct experience prov-
ing that a favorable commentary on SeekingAlpha can have a significant impact 
on stock value.
Summary
A successful Reg A+ fundraising effort is not an end in itself but the beginning 
of a new phase of business operations that should be considered as a step for-
ward toward a full-blown IPO. No matter whether a firm ultimately lists on a 
national exchange, gets acquired, or remains status quo, once funds are raised, 
the company must adopt a public company mindset and take all appropriate 
actions needed to meet compliance issues as well as the greater responsibili-
ties that come with having outside investors and key third parties that can 
influence the value of the firm’s shares.
Having highlighted a number of best practices in this chapter, we would like 
to close by reinforcing perhaps the best way of learning how to develop opti-
mum post-IPO processes and procedures. Make a concerted effort to meet 
with companies that have already graduated to the next step and are similar 
enough to your firm that you can clearly see what they have done to meet the 
added challenges that come with accepting funds from outsiders and dealing 
with regulators.
If you determine that your firm comes up short in needed internal talent, con-
sider adding experienced personnel to your board of directors, hiring a part-
time CFO, or seeking out needed resources from consulting organizations. If 
you look earnestly, you will find many helping hands who may willing to assist 
and who perhaps would be willing to take a portion of their compensation 
in stock.
Having real stock that has the potential of being tradable is a major benefit of 
Reg A+ and can provide added incentives to encourage talented and experi-
enced people to join with you to help realize your objectives.

Securities
We discuss throughout this book that one of the great potential advantages 
of Reg A+ securities is the ability to freely trade shares. However, beyond 
isolated, negotiated trades between brokers or investors, the development 
of the infrastructure of a real secondary market is still nascent and has a lot 
of room to grow. In this chapter—to give context and to help you under-
stand the needs of a vibrant secondary market and how new trading options 
may develop for Reg A+ shares—we discuss the history of the development 
of exchanges, dynamics of the current stock market and, in particular, those 
dynamics when investing in “small-cap” companies. We also discuss venture 
exchanges as an analog to secondary markets and conclude by reviewing a 
couple of market options that are currently available to facilitate trading of 
Reg A+ shares.

History of Stock Exchanges
The concept of a market is as old as civilization itself. The act of trading goods 
and services was one of the driving factors in creating organized society. From 
the early civilizations of Mesopotamia, to the Incan empire, the market has 
always been the focal point of a society. Generally considered to be the eco-
nomic driver of trade, the market has taken many forms, trading foodstuffs, 
spices, and other commodities throughout history. 
A stock market or equity market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a 
loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete 
entity) of stocks (also called shares); these may include securities listed on a 
stock exchange as well as those only traded privately.
While the first stock market is something that has been debated among histo-
rians, debt instruments and the idea of interest bearing investments go back to 
the beginning of known civilization, with scholars finding clay tablets recording 
interest-bearing loans from Mesopotamia. The concept of stock, or an equity 
interest in an enterprise, is something that evolved much later. There is little 
consensus among scholars as to when corporate stock was first traded. Some 
link the first equity-based stock to the Dutch East India Company’s found-
ing in 1602,1 while others point to earlier developments. Economist Ulrike 
Malmendier of the University of California at Berkeley argues that a share 
market existed as far back as the Roman Republic.2 Regardless of the timing 
of the first stock market, almost immediately thereafter, a regulatory body 
was established to implement controls to prevent market manipulation and 
fraudulent activity.
Historians have found evidence of trade unions several hundred years before 
the Roman Empire, in which contractors or leaseholders would perform tem-
ple-building or other services on behalf of the government. Participants in 
these organizations held shares that could be considered close to what we 
would consider partnership or equity interest today. The orator Cicero has 
been quoted saying that these “shares that had a very high price at the time,” 
indicating that these interests could be bought and sold, and may well have 
been traded on the first secondary market for stocks. Despite the existence 
of such an exchange, these markets did not persist due to both political and 
economic changes brought on by the shift from a republic to an empire.

Regulation A+
The first tradeable bonds as a commonly used security were a more recent 
innovation that was first seen during the Renaissance period in the Italian 
city-states of Florence and Venice. The Italian city-states, ruled by a council of 
citizens as opposed to a monarch, were the first governments to issue govern-
ment securities. In the middle of the 13th Century, Venetian bankers began to 
trade in government securities, which then led to the first regulation of the 
market, when in 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors 
intended to lower the price of government funds.
Italian companies were also the first to issue shares, with companies from 
England and the Netherlands soon to follow suit.
The first true stock exchange, the one we are familiar with today, was founded 
in Amsterdam when the Dutch East India Company was the first joint-stock 
company to get a fixed capital stock that allowed for continuous trading of 
company stock. Shortly thereafter, a number of derivatives, options, and other 
contracts appeared on the Amsterdam market. The Dutch were also the first 
to engage in short selling, which led the Dutch authorities to ban the practice 
as early at 1610.
The Amsterdam trader, Joseph de la Vega, also known as Joseph Penso de la 
Vega, wrote the first book on the inner workings of a stock market, Confusion 
of Confusions, in 1688. The book described a market that was sophisticated 
but also prone to excesses.
The markets evolved in 1693 when King William of England used government 
bonds to finance the country’s wars, and the Bank of England was set up the 
following year. This allowed for English joint-stock companies and facilitated 
the first English public offerings.
Despite the existence of the Royal Exchange, brokers of the joint-stock com-
panies were banned from participating, and rather they conducted their busi-
ness in local coffee shops. One broker, John Castaing, posted regular lists of 
stock and commodity prices, which became the foundation of the London 
Stock Exchange.
One of the driving forces behind the London Stock Exchange was the trad-
ing companies that were established to exploit the opportunities of the new 
world, such as The South Sea Company and the Mississippi Company. Investor 
appetite for these new offerings was considerable, and led to one of the first 
bubbles in the market. At the height of the New World-driven bubble, in 1720, 
blind pool companies were even being offered.
Shortly thereafter, it became clear that expectations of imminent wealth from 
the Americas were overblown, and share prices collapsed, forcing the govern-
ment to act. Parliament passed the Bubble Act, mandating that only royally-
chartered companies could issue public shares, greatly reducing the size and 

Chapter 8 | Secondary Markets and Regulation A+ Securities

scope of the public markets for some time. This opened the door for the first 
stock markets in the newly established United States of America in the 1790s.
The Markets of Today
The financial system in most developed countries is considerably more com-
plex today, with the introduction of electronic trading systems replacing 
human trading and the disintermediation of banks from the savings and lend-
ing business. Traditionally, local banks played a larger role in financing, using 
bank deposits of its customers to place funds into securities. Today, market 
participants can directly access investment banking products, trade in dark 
pools, and actively manage their portfolios without the need to use a direct 
intermediary. Additionally, the public is an active participant with more pen-
sion plans, retirement accounts, and mutual funds placing capital directly into 
the markets.
With the introduction of electronic trading, the markets are considerably 
more vulnerable to systemic risks associated with programs and algorithms 
that react to overall market movements. As such, in recent market crashes, 
electronic trading can effectively remove buyers from the market during these 
swings.
There have been famous stock market crashes that have caused billions of 
dollars in losses and global wealth destruction. The most notable crashes 
include the Wall Street Crash of 1929, 1973-4, Black Monday of 1987, the dot-
com bubble of 2000, the Housing Bubble crash of 2008, and the Flash Crash 
of 2015.
In the crash of 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 50% of its value, 
leading to the start of the Great Depression. Black Monday began with the 
market in Hong Kong but quickly affected all markets globally. At the bot-
tom of the crash, the Hong Kong market had crashed 45.5%, Spain 31%, the 
UK 26.4%, the United States 22.7%, and Canada 22.5%. Notably, Black Friday 
was the biggest one-day drop in the stock market, with the Dow Jones losing 
22.6% in a single trading session.
One of the mysteries of Black Friday is the lack of a major new event or other 
indicator to cause the immediate selloff. Rather, the crash has caused a num-
ber of academics and economists to propose various new theories of market 
dynamics, including irrational human behavior, efficient markets, and even the 
underlying assumption that markets are rational.
As a result of the largest single-day crash, regulators introduced a number of 
new market controls that were designed to prevent such significant losses 
again in the future. These included halting the markets when large drops 
occurred and other measures designed to allow for more holistic reviews of 
market activities.

137
Regulation A+
One adoption following Black Friday was the introduction of electronic trad-
ing. Rather than stocks trading via human callers, software was introduced 
that performed the duties of matching buyers and sellers. Computers could 
handle larger trading volumes and the thinking was that this should prevent 
large market crashes due to inefficiencies in human trading.
Additionally, the SEC in the United States increased the margin requirements, 
in an attempt to remove blatant speculation from the markets.
Trading vs. Capital Formation
While the stock markets were initially envisioned to match buyers and sellers, 
or direct participants, in actuality, the markets have created a new breed of 
participant, traders. These traders are generally not party to the underlying 
transaction, i.e., a future contract for the delivery of a barrel of oil, and have 
no long-term interest in the underlying security other than using it to be able 
to profit from the trading of the note. Traders participate in the market in 
many ways, and they are allowed to participate in the market because of the 
idea that they create market liquidity. However, some individuals believe that 
excessive trading is one of the reasons that markets no longer offer the same 
advantages as they once did. 
The cost of going public has risen steadily, and early capital formation has 
become an expensive endeavor reserved for only large-cap companies. The 
idea of going public for early stage companies is no longer cost effective and 
exposes issuers to trader, market makers and other third parties that can 
greatly affect a firm’s stock.
Trading Strategies
Traders in the market can employ a number of strategies to profit off the 
securities markets, some of which can have an underlying detrimental impact 
on the underlying security, or in other cases the issuing company. One such 
strategy is called short selling, in which a trader “borrows” a stock from a 
broker and then sells it in the market with the idea that the price of the stock 
will decrease. If the stock does in fact decrease, the trader can then purchase 
the stock at a lower price and repay the loan, pocketing the difference in price 
between the time the stock was borrowed and the new price, only paying the 
broker interest on the transaction. 
Another similar strategy involves creating a financial derivative, in which a con-
tract is written allowing a trader to control a large amount of shares without 
actually owning the underlying security. Both short selling and derivatives pose 
significant risk to the issuers and defeats the underlying purpose of public 
markets. Generally, these strategies benefit few individuals, but are legal under 

Chapter 8 | Secondary Markets and Regulation A+ Securities
138
the guise of market liquidity. In reality, smaller issuers see no benefit from 
traders in their shares, and would be better served with less liquidity in their 
stocks.
Short selling is especially dangerous to thinly traded shares because a rogue 
trader can manipulate a stock with very little capital risk. This has led to mar-
kets either preventing short selling or placing market capitalization restric-
tions on the practice. In the United States, while some of these restrictions 
have been implemented, the practice still occurs.
The opposite of shorting a stock is called going long. In this case, a trader bor-
rows money from a brokerage and uses it to purchase shares. If and when 
the stock increases in value, the trader can sell the shares to cover the loan, 
pocketing the difference in price minus the interest payment. In the event that 
that stock decreases in price, the brokerage may ask for repayment of the 
loan, known as a margin call. Most markets have placed restrictions on the 
amount of margin buying allowed. In the United States, traders are required 
to hold 50% of the trade value in cash in their brokerage account to be able 
to trade on margin.
Margin trading regulations were introduced after the 1929 market crash, prior 
to which there were very low margin restrictions, with brokers allowing trad-
ers to have 10% in cash to enter into a long position.
Another strategy that has since been outlawed, and is similar in practice to 
kiting checks, is known as free riding. This is when a trader purchases shares 
and then sells them before having paid for the initial trade. Settlement of trad-
ing generally takes three days and if a trader believes that shares are going 
increase in price, he or she could place a buy order and sell the shares within 
the three days and pocket the difference.
All of these strategies, while potentially profitable, have been largely frowned 
upon by regulators and contradict the underlying purpose of the markets to 
provide liquidity for securities.
Regulators have attempted to remove a great majority of speculation from the 
market; however, traders have continued to develop new ways to profit from 
the existence of the markets.
Issues with Today’s Market Structure
Traders today are no longer just individuals: computer programs are also 
actively participating and manipulating the markets. High-frequency comput-
erized stock trading now controls more than half the market.3
3https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading

139
Regulation A+
Recently, the New York attorney general and the federal government have 
opened up investigations into this type of trading in response to a book pub-
lished by Michael Lewis, called Flash Boys. In it, Lewis argues that the stock 
market is now rigged to benefit a group of insiders that have made tens of 
billions of dollars exploiting computerized trading. In his book, Lewis outlines 
how, in his words, the “United States stock market, the most iconic market in 
global capitalism, is rigged by a combination of these stock exchanges, the big 
Wall Street banks, and high-frequency traders.” Lewis argues that the high-
frequency traders are essentially front running stock orders and driving prices 
up for traditional investor based on insider information that is available to 
them before the general public becomes aware of information.
This front running happens because stocks are no longer traded on floors of 
stock exchanges, but by computers. The NYSE ceased to be the center of U.S. 
financial activity years ago, and exists today mostly as a photo op. Today, most 
of the trades take place at more than 60 public and private exchanges, where 
billions of dollars in stock change hands every day with little or no public 
documentation. The trades are being made by thousands of robot comput-
ers without human interaction. These programs were also thought to be the 
cause of the August 2015 market crash.
Lewis states, “Humans have been completely removed from the marketplace.”
“Fast” is the operative word. Machines with secret programs are now trading 
stocks in tiny fractions of a second, way too fast to be seen or recorded on a 
stock ticker or computer screen. Faster than the market itself. High-frequency 
traders, big Wall Street firms, and stock exchanges have spent billions to gain 
an advantage of a millisecond for themselves and their customers, just to get 
a peek at stock market prices and orders a flash before everyone else, along 
with the opportunity to act on it.
This form of front running means that high-frequency traders can identify an 
investor’s desire, for example, to buy shares in Microsoft and buy them before 
the investor and sell them back to the investor at a higher price. In other 
words, it’s like you wanted to buy a hamburger at McDonalds and rather than 
give your order to the cashier, you give it to the person in front of you in line. 
He then buys the hamburger and turns around and sells it to you for more 
than he paid, making a tiny profit, just by standing in front of you in line. This 
front running happens in infinitesimally small periods of time, but it still allows 
for traders to act.
Brad Katsuyama, a trader at the Royal Bank of Canada, realized that high-
frequency trading was occurring when he tried to understand why none of 
his trades were being completely filled. Upon investigation, he uncovered that 
when his order was placed on one exchange, high-frequency traders were 
beating his order to other exchanges and buying his stocks in front of him. To 
combat this, he started his own trading platform that is attempting to remove 
high-frequency traders from the market.

Chapter 8 | Secondary Markets and Regulation A+ Securities
140
Katsuyama uncovered that the methodology that allowed for this to occur 
was a direct result of the logistics of how traders are processed and routed 
on the Internet. A new exchange started by Katsuyama called the IEX,4 or the 
investor’s exchange, was launched quietly in September 2013 with the support 
of some of the biggest players on Wall Street. And it comes with built-in speed 
bumps to eliminate the advantage of high-speed predators.
Large Cap vs. Small Cap
When characterizing equities, the market capitalization of a company plays a 
significant impact on the capability of the issuer to be able to withstand public 
markets. Equities are generally characterized by their market capitalization. 
“Capitalization” refers to the size of a company, calculated by multiplying its 
current stock price by the number of shares outstanding. The biggest com-
panies are considered mega-cap, which are those with market capitalization 
of over $100B dollars. Large-cap companies are considered those with $10B 
in market capitalization. mid-cap stocks are generally companies between $2 
and $10B; small-cap are from $300M to $2B; micro-caps are from $50 to 
$300M; and nano-cap stocks are under $50M in capitalization. Most new Reg 
A+ stocks would therefore be considered micro- or nano-cap stocks. 
From an investment perspective, market capitalization can have a large impact 
on the growth of a security. From an issuer perspective, market capitalization 
is generally a good indicator of public market sophistication, meaning that 
smaller companies are less likely to have the capability of investor protections 
and investor relations’ functionality. As a result, the markets for trading shares 
of smaller-cap companies have been either disappearing or going private to 
protect themselves from the public markets.
Historically, despite the significantly higher volatility of smaller cap stocks, 
they have generally outperformed large-cap stocks. From the crash in 1929 
to today, smaller capitalized stock have averaged an annual return of over 
12%, while larger capitalized stocks have returned just over 10% according to 
MorningStar. The issue behind this is that larger-cap companies are generally 
market leaders in their fields and do not have the same growth prospects. 
Larger companies do not have the same capability to expand their markets. As 
a result, larger-cap companies tend to be active participants in acquiring com-
panies that can add growth capability. The companies generally targeted are 
smaller-caps, making investment into these companies additionally beneficial.

Regulation A+
Reg A+ should increase the number of smaller-cap companies available to 
non-accredited investors, allowing for the general public to participate in the 
largest component of wealth creation in the United States today.
Positive Features of a Functional Stock Market
A properly functioning stock market is one of the main drivers of a sound 
economy. A functioning market will provide a direct barometer of the eco-
nomic health of an economy, provide for ample supply and demand, ensure 
that listing companies have been fully vetted and are not fraudulent actors, 
provide a large enough secondary market to support capital formation and 
continued investment in the economy, provide ample transparency to provide 
comfort for market participants, provide a managed process for third-party 
traders to facilitate liquidity without harming market function, and provide a 
savings and investment vehicle for the society at large.
Existing Venture Exchanges
Several larger global exchanges, including the London Exchange and the 
Singapore Exchange, have developed secondary markets for earlier stage com-
panies, commonly referred to as venture exchanges. One such exchange, the 
Alternative Investment Market (AIM), was developed to provide earlier access 
to the capital markets for younger companies.5 A recent study on the AIM was 
conducted to identify how the exchange functioned for listing companies, in 
addition to the quality of the market as a whole. Since 1995, over 2,300 British 
and 400 foreign companies have listed on the AIM, raising almost $79B in new 
capital.
The study found that some of the key benefits of the AIM and venture 
exchanges are specialized regulation designed for smaller companies, wide 
investor attraction, strong secondary market performance, low failure rates, 
and strong liquidity for larger companies, all characteristics needed for a 
vibrant market. The AIM has been in existence for 20 years, and it proves that 
the venture exchange model can work and assist with capital formation for 
growth-stage companies.

Case Studies
Back in the early 70s and 80s, the markets served smaller companies and 
facilitated early capital formation for some of the most notable companies 
of today. One of the biggest success stories of the late 20th Century is the 
story of Intel. The firm was established in Mountain View, California in 1968 by 
Gordon E. Moore (of “Moore’s Law” fame), and Robert Noyce, a physicist and 
co-inventor of the integrated circuit. While the firm has some initial venture 
capital, the firm accesses the public markets very early on in the company’s 
development. Prior to going public, the company had revenues of $3,978,000 
and profit before extraordinary items of $93,000. Intel went public, just two 
years after its founding, with a common stock underwriting of 350,000 shares 
at $23.50 per share, for a total of $8.225M and for a post-money value of 
$58M.This offering included 42,000 shares for selling shareholders.
The size and scale of Intel’s IPO was common in the 70s. On April 18, 1972, 
Datascope, a firm with $973,000 in revenue, went public with an offering of 
105,000 shares at $19 per share, raising $2,011,000 of which $977,000 went 
to selling shareholders. Datascope’s post-money value was $9M. Datascope 
was sold in 2009 for $865M. Also in the 70s, Storage Technology went public 
at a market cap of $13M; Four Phase Systems raised $15M; Cray Research 
raised $10M; and Tandem Computers raised $9.4M. In 1980, Sci-Tex raised 
$6.8M from initial offerings. Even Adobe went public with a small offering rais-
ing $6M in 1986. It would have been impossible for any of these companies 
to go public in today’s environment. Virtually all the buyers of these securi-
ties were individuals, as opposed to institutional investors, who make up the 
majority of the market today.
While the size of Intel’s IPO may be surprising by today’s standards of  
$100M + IPOs, the most interesting part of the IPO was that there were 64 
underwriters in the selling group. Of the 64, only five are still in existence 
today. Such a small offering, with the number of brokers in the selling group, 
would all but be impossible today due to the new restrictions and regula-
tions implemented by the SEC following the dot-com and housing bubble 
crashes. Intel benefited from easy access to the public markets and was able 
to raise much needed capital. Today, smaller market companies do not have 
this option and are forced to raise capital from the private markets, a much 
slower and harder process. With the passage of the JOBS Act, there is hope 
in the marketplace that the public markets will reopen for smaller companies.

143
Regulation A+
The JOBS Act and Secondary Trading
The future of crowdfunding and early capital formation depends on a vibrant 
and active secondary market for the new Reg A+ securities. While the JOBS 
Act has provided a mechanism for early-stage public capital formation, the 
Act does not actively address the need for secondary market liquidity. There 
has been some talk by the SEC as well as by prominent members of existing 
exchanges as to how these new venture exchanges should operate to provide 
liquidity and investor protections. 
As discussed in previous chapters, Reg A+ securities are freely tradeable, 
meaning that they can trade on any registered exchange or trading platform. 
However, by definition, the Reg A+ companies are earlier stage micro-caps, 
meaning that they are less likely to be prepared for public markets and the 
various trader issues.
Existing early-stage exchanges have had success in overseas markets, such 
as the SIM VSE in Australia and the CSE in Canada. They have shown that 
venture exchanges can function and provide market liquidity; however, these 
exchanges do not actively address the key issues with early-stage and thinly-
traded securities. Currently in the United States, micro-cap companies gen-
erally lack market support either in the form of active market makers, or 
low shareholder count, thus allowing for uncertain market pricing and market 
manipulation.
Unlike private-placement securities, Reg A+ securities are freely tradeable, mean-
ing that initial investors can easily trade their shares. Without a purpose-defined 
marketplace, it becomes difficult for holders of Reg A+ securities to trade.
Current Market Options: ASMX
The ASMX was developed to provide liquidity for Reg A+ securities, but also 
provide a safe environment for trading of these new securities. For issuers, it 
is important that their stock price cannot be actively manipulated by a single

The ASMX is a primary and secondary trading platform that harkens back to 
the early days of a stock exchange, where buyers and sellers met face to face. 
On the ASMX, trading is done by appointment, similar to online auction sites 
like eBay.
Buyers or sellers can list their intentions for buying or selling shares, the price 
they are willing to accept or pay, and how long to keep their order open. 
The ASMX will aggregate all orders each day and provide matching services. 
Unlike the NYSE or NASDAQ, there is a single settlement each day in which 
all orders are sorted and shares allocated, providing a managed system for the 
buyer and seller.

Chapter 8 | Secondary Markets and Regulation A+ Securities
144
The platform developed by the ASMX provides unparalleled transparency, 
allowing for early-stage investor attraction. Issuers can access a broad network 
of broker-dealers who can sell their primary offerings through their existing 
networks as well, very similar to existing markets, such as the NASDAQ.
The ASMX platform is designed specifically to prevent short selling by man-
dating that sellers be verified owners of shares before they can be listed on 
the platform. Additionally, the matching system means that there are no bro-
ker-dealer market makers needed. As a pure matching service, liquidity is still 
provided, but immediate settlement cannot be guaranteed.
The trading by appointment auction system can prevent high-frequency trad-
ing by definition, excluding flash traders from the marketplace.
As a dedicated early-stage trading platform, the ASMX has lower compli-
ance and regulatory costs when compared with other exchanges. The ASMX 
bridges the gap between a company’s private placements with angels or  
venture capital and a full public offering, at a fraction of the cost of a formal 
public listing.

Current Market Options: OTC
Regulation A+ Tier 2 offerings will be a source of new securities traded on 
the OTC markets. Upon completion of a Regulation A+ Tier 2 offering, non-
affiliate shareholders will have publicly tradable shares in companies that are 
subject to continuing Regulation A+ disclosure, but are not necessarily fully 
SEC reporting. The OTCQX® Best and OTCQB® Venture markets operated  
by OTC Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Markets Group”)—as well as any newly 
developed secondary markets designed for Regulation A+ securities—will  
provide secondary markets for those shareholders and other interested 
investors. 
Existing U.S. and Canadian companies traded on OTCQX and OTCQB that 
are not SEC reporting, and those that are considering deregistering from the 
SEC, may utilize Regulation A+ as an additional attractive option for raising 
money in a public securities offering. Additional shares issued by these com-
panies in a Regulation A+ transaction will trade along with the companies’ 
existing secondary markets on the OTCQX and OTCQB markets.
OTC Markets Group has developed a Regulation A+ “on-ramp,” which includes 
new OTCQX and OTCQB market rules specifically designed for companies 
using Regulation A+ to go public and develop their secondary trading markets.

The OTCQX Best Market
The OTCQX U.S. market is the top level of the United States over the coun-
ter market, divided into OTCQX U.S. and, for the highest-level companies, 
OTCQX U.S. Premier. To qualify for OTCQX, U.S. companies must meet high 
financial standards, demonstrate compliance with U.S. securities laws, be cur-
rent in their disclosure, and be sponsored by a third-party advisor. OTCQX 
securities are quoted by FINRA member broker-dealers on OTC Link® ATS, 
an SEC-registered alternative trading system.
The OTCQB Venture Market
The OTCQB Venture Market is for entrepreneurial and development stage 
U.S. and international companies that are unable to qualify for OTCQX. To be 
eligible, companies must be current in their reporting and undergo an annual 
verification and management certification process. These standards provide 
a strong baseline of transparency, as well as the technology and regulation 
to improve the information and trading experience for investors. Companies 
must meet a minimum $0.01 bid price test and may not be in bankruptcy. 
OTCQB securities are quoted by FINRA member broker-dealers on OTC

Trading Regulation A+ Securities on OTCQX and 
OTCQB
In June of 2015, OTC Markets Group updated its OTCQX rules for U.S. 
companies and its OTCQB standards to create a Regulation A+ reporting 
standard that streamlines the qualification process for companies issuing secu-
rities under Regulation A+.
OTCQX
Most significantly, OTCQX rules for U.S. companies now allow a company to 
use its required disclosure under Regulation A+ to help meet the initial and 
ongoing OTCQX disclosure requirements. To qualify for OTCQX, a company 
using the Regulation A+ reporting standard must file all reports required to 
be filed on the SEC’s EDGAR system pursuant to Regulation A+, as well as 
quarterly disclosure and certain current information.

Chapter 8 | Secondary Markets and Regulation A+ Securities
146
Under the initial disclosure obligations, a Regulation A+ reporting company 
must have filed all reports required to be filed on EDGAR. The most recent 
financial statements required to be audited under Regulation A+ must be 
audited by an independent public accountant registered with the PCAOB.
Under the ongoing disclosure obligations, a Regulation A+ reporting com-
pany must file, on an ongoing basis, all annual, semi-annual, and other interim 
reports required to be filed on EDGAR under Regulation A+. Also, within 45 days 
of the end of each fiscal quarter, it must publish on EDGAR through Form 1-U 
quarterly disclosures, including all information required in the company’s semi-
annual report. Each annual report must include financial statements audited 
by an independent public accountant registered with the PCAOB. Companies 
seeking to trade on OTCQX U.S. Premier must publish, on EDGAR through 
SEC Form 1-U, copies of all proxies, proxy statements, and all other material 
mailed by the company to its shareholders with respect thereto, within 15 days  
of the mailing of such material.
Summary
Developing secondary markets for Reg A+ securities, proprietors of these 
trading systems have a lot of experience and analogs from which to draw in 
developing effective marketplaces for trading in these securities. Promising 
options are already popping up. With greater use of Regulation A+ as a chan-
nel to obtain capital and grow value these options should mature into viable 
and attractive venues for investors.

Reg A+ provides small, existing companies who have been operating for a 
number of years a realistic means of raising additional capital and providing 
liquidity for current investors. As discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, there are 
thousands of businesses that cannot attract additional private capital and do 
not qualify for an M&A or a big IPO on Wall Street.
As discussed in Chapter 3, thousands of companies over the past 20-30 years 
have raised the majority of their capital by utilizing exemptions provided under 
Regulation D of the securities laws. The JOBS Act introduced several new fun-
draising options, including Reg A+, that can be helpful in raising needed capi-
tal depending on the need and choices made by each company. Each option 
requires careful evaluation before a decision can be made.
Start-Up Funding and Growth Capital
Most companies go through 3–4 stages of capital raises in their lifetime.
Seed Stage
The seed stage typically requires up to $1M to prove the new product or 
business concept with a prototype model. This is generally the most difficult 
capital to raise because it has the highest risk for investors. These funds are 
either invested by entrepreneurs themselves or through friends and family. 
Depending on the long-term potential and the strength of the management 
team, some VCs may also invest, especially if team members have a track 
record of successes. Investors and VCs typically sign a contract with a con-
vertible note with some accrued interest on this investment to be converted 
into Series A stock during a formal first round of funding.
Recently many new Internet-based portals such as www.kickstarter.com 
have successfully helped entrepreneurs raise initial capital to develop con-
cepts. However, in many of these portals, investors cannot share in the owner-
ship equity or future profits of the company. Instead of obtaining an ownership 
position, investors are permitted to make donations or gifts to the company. 
Individuals give money due to their personal passion for the idea or to pro-
mote an exciting concept. Sometimes companies will provide discounts on 
future goods or services in exchange for contributions. As an example, one 
entrepreneur was able to raise up to $7M for an Internet-based watch con-
cept on Kickstarter.
Due to the lower cost of raising funds through Internet portals such as 
Kickstarter, entrepreneurs seeking seed capital should fully explore this option 
in addition to other non-equity sources such as bank loans, credit cards, etc. 
These options minimize the amount of ownership that may need to be sacrificed 
to attract the needed capital.

Regulation A+
149
First Stage (Series A)
The first stage or Series A funding is the first formal round of capital. It’s usu-
ally raised when the product/business concept is introduced to a select group 
of customers for first revenues. This round is still quite risky for investors,  
as total long-term cost of building the enterprise and the profit model are 
still not fully established. This stage typically requires less than $5M and VCs 
or experienced angels can be the most effective investors since they not only 
provide the required capital but also help the company with many introductions 
to manufacturers, customers, and key employees. Due to the risk of success, 
investors in this round will likely seek a significant ownership position for their 
investments. This can be as high as 50% of the company.
■
■Tip  Reg A+ is not ideal for raising seed capital or very early stage funds. The added costs and 
time required to obtain SEC approval for a Reg A+ are not a good match for a very young company 
that will likely be cash strapped and wanting to move quickly on a new idea. Use of Reg D for very 
early funding generally remains a better option.
Second Stage (Series B)
The second stage or Series B is termed “growth stage” capital and raised 
funds are typically used to increase revenues, scale manufacturing, and hire 
additional employees to build a larger and profitable business. Since this fund-
ing is generally sought after the firm has been successful in generating repeat 
revenues, the risk of an investment in this round is often less than in earlier 
stages. This funding round may also require significantly more capital (in the 
range of $5–25M, depending on the nature of the business). For the last 10–15 
years prior to the JOBS Act, this was a key period where growth capital simply 
was scarce. That is, unless the company was perceived as being a hot start-up 
with a potential to deliver a 100-times or more return and could generate 
interest from VCs.
Reg A+ is an option that should be explored at this stage since the firm is now 
far enough along to have some degree of operating history and has added 
financial resources to cover the required legal and filing costs. The ability 
to access a wider pool of investors and raise up to $50M annually via public 
solicitation that is permitted under Reg A+ can be a good option to achieve 
funding objectives at this stage.

Chapter 9 | Final Thoughts
150
Later Stages (Series C/D)
The later stages or Series C/D funding rounds typically have a primary objec-
tive to raise sufficient capital to provide liquidity to a firm’s investors, prefer-
ably through a full IPO on a national exchange, such as the NASDAQ. If a 
company has raised previous funds via Reg A+, a later stage company can 
raise additional funds by qualifying for listing on a secondary exchange and 
thereby provide liquidity to its investors. Alternatively, a company can seek to 
obtain liquidity and added investment through being acquired or merging with 
a larger company. To the extent that the previous rounds established share 
prices (which may be easier to achieve under Reg A+), the valuation of the 
firm for either acquisition or merger can be more objectively set.
Liquidity for Current Investors of  
Private Firms
Most small companies are initially funded by private investors and friends and 
family utilizing Regulation D. The vast majority of smaller firms remain private 
for an extended period and therefore their investors have limited options to 
sell their ownership positions since their shares are not freely tradable. Even 
for companies that are generally growing well and producing revenue and 
profits, investors still may not be able to get their profits or original capital 
back for many years until an IPO or a cash acquisition happens. Most investors 
who invest in small companies therefore end up stuck in an illiquid investment 
and become reluctant to invest in other small firms even if they have means 
and/or desire to do so.
Regulation A+ can help these small companies. If the capital required is $50M 
or less, companies may use Regulation A+ to raise new capital up to $50M in a 
private or public offering at a much lower cost than a traditional IPO. In addi-
tion to $50M, existing investors can sell up to 30% of their current equity or 
$15M in secondary sales or a maximum of 30% with initial offering or during 
the next 12-month period. This allows current investors to get liquidity for 
their equity that may have been locked up for many years.
One-Off Projects
There are many business opportunities having specific short-term objectives 
where the principals do not intend to establish a long-term ongoing company. 
Examples include real estate development projects, movies, and limited term 

Regulation A+
151
investment vehicles such as a Delaware Statutory Trust.1 These projects typi-
cally have a 3-10 year horizon to completion. Most real estate projects also 
seek leverage through seeking loans for a large portion of the total capi-
tal requirement. Loans are available for such projects because they have real 
assets as collateral, plus the borrower may elect to take some loan guarantees 
as well provide added security for the debt. Therefore the equity portion 
of the total capital requirement is relatively small but can still range from 
$5–$50M, depending on the size of the project. This equity portion is a higher 
risk investment relative to the debt since the lender usually has a priority to 
recover the loan balance against the assets of the project before investors can 
receive their original equity and profits.
Most of the required equity for these types of one-off projects has been raised 
under Reg D offerings, with capital provided by accredited retail investors and 
private equity funds. Reg A+ provides another choice now, by allowing options 
to raise equity for these types of projects through public offerings in which 
both accredited and non-accredited investors can participate.
How to Fundraise
In order to choose the target investors and reach them for fundraising, some 
of the key considerations are the amount of funds being raised, time allowed 
to raise capital, legal costs, auditing and other costs, including filing fees. Lastly, 
but importantly, you need to consider the need for secondary trading by 
investors after the initial raise.
Typically most companies want to complete the fundraising process in less 
than six months. If they have access to existing investors, it may be possible to 
complete the process more quickly. Assuming an approximate timeline of six 
months, there are two main options to consider:
• 
Although in its infancy, online fundraising may be a very 
realistic option to raise amounts of up to $5M (e.g., 
Kickstarter).
• 
For higher amounts up to $50M, it may be better to seek 
help from qualified broker-dealers, who have a focus and 
willingness to use Reg A+ as a platform to raise capital. 
Online fundraising is expected to explode as companies and retail investors 
recognize the potential to participate in opportunities that were previously 
only available to an exclusive club of accredited high net worth investors (HNI). 
As early evidence of the success of online fundraising, in the three years since 
the approval of Title II of JOBS Act, over 200 online portals have emerged to 
1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_statutory_trust

Chapter 9 | Final Thoughts
152
help Reg D investors raise capital online under the newly approved Regulation 
D 506(c) exemption. By some estimates, these portals have been able to raise 
several $100M in the last 2–3 years. As the Reg A+ potential is recognized, 
many of these portals are expected to add Reg A+ offerings and the amount 
of funds via online portals is expected to dramatically rise in the years ahead.
New broker-dealers will likely emerge to take advantage of the disruptive 
opportunity created by Reg A+ and will have a greater focus on utilizing online 
platforms with lower cost structures to investors than is currently offered 
by traditional securities firms. Online portals that are established by regis-
tered broker-dealers can engage in a much broader range of activities to dis-
tribute securities than portals who are not similarly licensed and registered. 
Therefore, it is likely that more portals will be established by broker-dealers 
and that the range of offerings will expand accordingly.

So Where Do We Go from Here?
It’s important to remember that everything discussed in this book is within 
the context of changes in the law that are likely to continue to evolve over 
time. There is no question that Reg A+ in and of itself has been a big step 
forward in diversifying channels to source capital.
For its full potential as an economic and job creation engine to be realized, a 
number of further developments need to happen at both the private and pub-
lic level. From the private perspective, growth in the use of Reg A+ will foster 
the development of secondary markets, as well as attract professional services 
essential to transparency and efficiency in a secondary market, including ana-
lytical coverage. That will attract more brokerages and issuers, thus fostering 
competition. This will, in turn, create “best practices” and industry standards 
to bolster confidence in investment in these securities and lead to increased 
demand. 
Of course, from the public level, there needs to be further examination of 
many of the issues previously discussed in this book to attract more and 
diverse financial service firms as well as issuers to this market.
Reconciliation of State Blue Sky Laws
In previous chapters we discussed the interplay of state securities laws with 
Regulation A+. Tier 1 still remains subject to state registration requirements, 
and the preemption from state registration for Tier 2 securities does not 
cover secondary trading in those securities, although various exemptions 
apply in that context. Reg A+ securities can attract capital without state reg-
istration, but secondary trading of the Reg A+ shares remains subject to state 
registration under Blue Sky laws.
Admittedly, the vast majority of states have agreed to a “coordinated” review 
process to try to alleviate the logistical and time burdens associated with 
state registration of Tier 1 offerings. But this is only an effort to streamline 
the process of registration and does not deal with the chief concern of the 
market, which is merit review by the states. Merit review means that many 
states can assess substantively an issuer’s offering based on pre-established 
guidelines adopted by those states to determine if the offering should be 
allowed to be sold in those states. (See Appendix E for more information on 
the Coordinated Review Program and exemplars of these guidelines.)

Regulation A+
155
A big question remains for much of the private market as to the practicality of 
trying to comply with these guidelines, especially for those who are planning to 
raise funds in all 50 states. Many in the private sector have expressed con-
cerns that this process will invite invasiveness outside of the coordinated 
review process by regulators or result in states trying to impose impractical 
deal terms on the issuer. Proponents of further exemptions from Blue Sky 
registration requirements often quote the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’s 
refusal to register Apple’s IPO (conducted prior to federal exemptions of 
listed securities) in that state because they felt it presented undue risk to the 
public…Apple!
As previously stated, even though initial issuances are pre-empted from state 
registration requirements, that does not necessarily hold true for secondary 
transactions in those securities. A number of exemptions exist for secondary 
activity, but most of these apply to “isolated” transactions by shareholders not 
otherwise affiliated with the issuer. They are not, generally speaking, trading 
for purposes of arbitrage activity, i.e., affecting or exploiting swings in price 
through buying and selling securities in volume. For the time being, this is 
likely not too much of an issue for issuers and investors alike, since the bulk of 
investors will be retail in nature and be motivated by yield or fundamentals of 
the company rather than market trends, as this market is still very immature. 
But market maturation will ultimately require that larger, more sophisticated 
brokerages and investment houses come to this market.
In part, their motivation to sophisticate this market will come from the poten-
tial to profit from the dynamics of the market. The debate as to what extent 
these players can or should be able to arbitrage Reg A+ securities will go on 
for some time, but one thing appears to be clear—the secondary market for 
Reg A+ shares cannot move too far beyond merely a reliable venue for the 
pricing and transfer of these securities on an episodic basis without address-
ing the layers of complexity that current state requirements pose.
Finally, several states require that a broker-dealer registered in that state be 
affiliated with a Regulation A+ offering, or the issuer must register as a broker 
there. While not a terribly large obstacle to conduct as part of the offering, 
this can pose a problem when issuers are using portals and aren’t intending 
to use a broker-dealer for their offering.2 Much is still to be learned about 
how the SEC will treat portals not licensed as brokers that facilitate these 
offerings, but this issue points to the fact that a number of issues still need to 
2Issuers can directly solicit investors without being registered as broker-dealers. As an 
example, start-up executives frequently attend investor events e.g., angel forums, in an 
effort to directly solicit funds—yet do not need to be registered as broker-dealers since 
they are regarded being exempt to their position as a principal and not an intermediary. 
Unlike intermediaries who must be registered, principals are prohibited from taking a 
commission on any funds that they raise.

Chapter 9 | Final Thoughts
156
be addressed in order to provide greater regulatory clarity to facilitate the 
growth of this offering type.
Raise Caps
Title IV of the JOBS Act requires the SEC to reevaluate regularly the caps on 
the amount that can be raised under Reg A in a 12-month period. During the 
process of adopting rules to implement Reg A+, the SEC heard from many 
commentators suggesting that the cap should already be raised to $100M.
$50M on a public basis presents a huge leap forward for a very large num-
ber of companies out there, but a large number of companies—for example, 
those in real estate investment or development—can exhaust $50M in capi-
tal quickly. Furthermore, for many sophisticated or larger investment houses, 
“float” is an issue. Float represents the number of securities of an issuer in 
the marketplace at a given time. Typically, brokerages look at this to try to 
determine what volume of trading can be expected in order to drive price. 
That becomes even more important if you are dealing with a security that is 
held by investors who will only buy/sell on an episodic basis. You need a lot 
more of the securities out there to make up for the volume typically achieved 
by investors seeking to arbitrage the security.
If the amount to be raised is revised, the carve-out from 12(g) will also need 
to be revised to account for the larger issuances.
But these issues as well as others will be dealt with in due course. Lawyers, 
investment bankers, brokers, innovators, and entrepreneurs are wading into 
the waters of Reg A+, and this will certainly facilitate discourse and debate 
needed to resolve them.
Summary
But even with its present flaws, business owners and entrepreneurs have a 
powerful new tool to reach a broader investing audience. A broader investing 
audience has access to a more diverse range of products and opportunities 
for income or wealth appreciation. They can also take some comfort that the 
regulatory regime provides for transparency, thus requiring business own-
ers to succeed on the merits of how their business performs in the market. 
Finally, those business owners have new options for monetizing their success 
in growing their operations.
Hopefully, this book has helped you begin the journey to discover dynamic and 
diverse methods and channels for sourcing capital, finding investing success, 
and building your “American dream.”

A f t e r w o r d
Afterword
This book is an important educational milestone that will help advance 
­entrepreneurial access to capital.
My colleague Ed Kim and I (our work is cited in the book) discovered and 
documented the collapse in the small IPO market and the decline in the num-
ber of NASDAQ- and NYSE-listed companies. We linked this drop to the loss 
of millions of jobs in the U.S. economy. Congress responded and gave rise to 
the JOBS Act. I had the distinct honor of helping to draft Regulation A+ and to 
testify in support of it in Congress. I was in the Rose Garden when President 
Obama signed the JOBS Act into law. And, while the SEC’s final Regulation A+ 
rules took three years to become effective, we are now “off to the races”.
I commend Messrs. Getty, Gupta, and Kaplan for their timely book that will 
help educate entrepreneurs, companies, investment banks, portals, and securi-
ties counsels on how to apply these new regulations to access capital.
Reg A+ is major step forward. However, we must not rest on our laurels: This 
great country of ours averaged over 500 IPOs in the years preceding the dot-
com bubble. Regulatory changes dropped the number of corporate IPOs to 
an average of only 150 IPOs per year in the post-dot-com era. Worse, had the 
United States not changed its stock market model, we would likely be enjoying 
the economic fruits of 950 IPOs a year after adjusting for today’s much larger 
economy. That estimated “loss” of 800 corporate IPOs is, in our view, one of 
the primary causes of today’s lackluster economy. Regulation A+ may help 
begin to breathe new life into capital formation.
We also hope that this book will help inspire entrepreneurs and their inves-
tors to take their fight to Washington. The United States must jettison what 
SEC Chair White and we have called, “one-size-fits-all markets”. The United 
States deserves a new form of stock exchange to serve the very different after-
market support and capital access needs of small capitalization ­companies and

their investors. Today’s one-size-fits-all markets only work for innately visible 
and naturally liquid stocks. For the rest of the economy, they have been a 
disaster. It is time to have your voices heard.
We congratulate the authors for bringing together many of the elements 
needed to help corporations and their investors take advantage of Reg A+ in 
a simple and easy-to-understand guide.
The U.S. IPO markets were once the envy of IPO markets throughout the 
world. This book is another step in clawing our way back to a new age of 
American prosperity. Join the fight and help bring back the “land of ­opportunity” 
for which we were all once so proud.

The Commission may from time to time by its rules and 
regulations, and subject to such terms and conditions as 
may be prescribed therein, add any class of securities to 
the securities exempted as provided in this section, if it 
finds that the enforcement of this subchapter with respect 
to such securities is not necessary in the public interest 
and for the protection of investors by reason of the small 
amount involved or the limited character of the public 
offering; but no issue of securities shall be exempted under 
this subsection where the aggregate amount at which such 
issue is offered to the public exceeds $5,000,000.
(2)	Additional issues
The Commission shall by rule or regulation add a class of 
securities to the securities exempted pursuant to this sec-
tion in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

ing such securities.

ing statement, and any related documents, in 
such form and with such content as prescribed

and other appropriate matters; and
(ii)	disqualification provisions under which the 
exemption shall not be available to the issuer 
or its predecessors, affiliates, officers, directors,

Regulation A—Conditional Small Issues 
Exemption
AUTHORITY: Secs. 230.251 to 230.263 issued under 15 U.S.C. 77c, 77s.
SOURCE: 57 FR 36468, Aug. 13, 1992, unless otherwise noted.
§230.251 Scope of Exemption
(a)	 Tier 1 and Tier 2. A public offer or sale of eligible secu-
rities, as defined in Rule 261 (§230.261), pursuant to 
Regulation A shall be exempt under section 3(b) from the 
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933  
(the “Securities Act”) (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.).
(1)	 Tier 1. Offerings pursuant to Regulation A in which 
the sum of all cash and other consideration to be 
received for the securities being offered (“aggre-
gate offering price”) plus the gross proceeds for all 
securities sold pursuant to other offering statements 
within the 12 months before the start of and during 
the current offering of securities (“aggregate sales”) 
does not exceed $20,000,000, including not more 
than $6,000,000 offered by all selling securityholders 
that are affiliates of the issuer (“Tier 1 offerings”).
(2)	 Tier 2. Offerings pursuant to Regulation A in which 
the sum of the aggregate offering price and aggregate 
sales does not exceed $50,000,000, including not 
more than $15,000,000 offered by all selling secu-
rityholders that are affiliates of the issuer (“Tier 2 
offerings”).

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
166
(3)	 Additional limitation on secondary sales in first year. The 
portion of the aggregate offering price attributable 
to the securities of selling securityholders shall not 
exceed 30% of the aggregate offering price of a par-
ticular offering in:
(i)	 The issuer’s first offering pursuant to 
Regulation A; or
(ii)	 Any subsequent Regulation A offering that is 
qualified within one year of the qualification 
date of the issuer’s first offering.
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (a). Where a mixture of cash 
and non-cash consideration is to be received, the aggre-
gate offering price must be based on the price at which 
the securities are offered for cash. Any portion of the 
aggregate offering price or aggregate sales attributable 
to cash received in a foreign currency must be translated 
into United States currency at a currency exchange rate 
in effect on, or at a reasonable time before, the date of 
the sale of the securities. If securities are not offered for 
cash, the aggregate offering price or aggregate sales must 
be based on the value of the consideration as established 
by bona fide sales of that consideration made within a rea-
sonable time, or, in the absence of sales, on the fair value 
as determined by an accepted standard. Valuations of non-
cash consideration must be reasonable at the time made. 
If convertible securities or warrants are being offered and 
such securities are convertible, exercisable, or exchange-
able within one year of the offering statement’s qualifi-
cation or at the discretion of the issuer, the underlying 
securities must also be qualified and the aggregate offer-
ing price must include the actual or maximum estimated 
conversion, exercise, or exchange price of such securities.

Regulation A+
167
(b)	 Issuer. The issuer of the securities:
(1)	 Is an entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or Canada, or any State, Province, Territory or 
possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, with 
its principal place of business in the United States or 
Canada;
(2)	 Is not subject to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) (15 U.S.C. 
78a et seq.) immediately before the offering;
(3)	 Is not a development stage company that either has 
no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated 
that its business plan is to merge with or acquire an 
unidentified company or companies;
(4)	 Is not an investment company registered or required 
to be registered under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) or a business 
development company as defined in section 2(a)(48) 
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 
80a-2(a)(48));
(5)	 Is not issuing fractional undivided interests in oil or 
gas rights, or a similar interest in other mineral rights;
(6)	 Is not, and has not been, subject to any order of the 
Commission entered pursuant to Section 12(j) of 
the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l(j)) within five years 
before the filing of the offering statement;
(7)	 Has filed with the Commission all reports required 
to be filed, if any, pursuant to Rule 257 (§230.257) 
during the two years before the filing of the offering 
statement (or for such shorter period that the issuer 
was required to file such reports); and
(8)	 Is not disqualified under Rule 262 (§230.262).

(c)	 Integration with other offerings. Offers or sales made in reli-
ance on this Regulation A will not be integrated with:
(1)	 Prior offers or sales of securities; or
(2)	 Subsequent offers or sales of securities that are:
(i)	 Registered under the Securities Act, except 
as provided in Rule 255(e) (§230.255(e));
(ii)	 Exempt from registration under Rule 701 
(§230.701);
(iii)	Made pursuant to an employee benefit plan;
(iv)	Exempt from registration under Regulation S 
(§§230.901 through 203.905);
(v)	 Made more than six months after the com-
pletion of the Regulation A offering; or
(vi)	Exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(6)  
of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)).
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (c). If these safe harbors do 
not apply, whether subsequent offers and sales of securi-
ties will be integrated with the Regulation A offering will 
depend on the particular facts and circumstances.
(d)	 Offering conditions—(1) Offers. (i) Except as allowed by 
Rule 255 (§230.255), no offer of securities may be made

but before it is qualified:
(A)	Oral offers may be made;
(B)	Written offers pursuant to Rule 254 (§230.254) 
may be made; and
(C)	Solicitations of interest and other communications 
pursuant to Rule 255 (§230.255) may be made.
(iii)	Offers may be made after the offering state-
ment has been qualified, but any written 
offers must be accompanied with or pre-
ceded by the most recent offering circular 
filed with the Commission for such offering.

Regulation A+
169
(2)	 Sales. (i) No sale of securities may be made:
(A)	Until the offering statement has been qualified;
(B)	By issuers that are not currently required to file 
reports pursuant to Rule 257(b) (§230.257(b)), 
until a Preliminary Offering Circular is delivered at 
least 48 hours before the sale to any person that 
before qualification of the offering statement had 
indicated an interest in purchasing securities in the 
offering, including those persons that responded 
to an issuer’s solicitation of interest materials; and
(C)	In a Tier 2 offering of securities that are not listed 
on a registered national securities exchange 
upon qualification, unless the purchaser is either 
an accredited investor (as defined in Rule 501 
(§230.501)) or the aggregate purchase price to be 
paid by the purchaser for the securities (includ-
ing the actual or maximum estimated conversion, 
exercise, or exchange price for any underlying 
securities that have been qualified) is no more 
than ten percent (10%) of the greater of such 
purchaser’s:
(1)	 Annual income or net worth if a natural person (with 
annual income and net worth for such natural per-
son purchasers determined as provided in Rule 501 
(§230.501)); or
(2)	 Revenue or net assets for such purchaser’s most 
recently completed fiscal year end if a non-natural 
person.
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (d)(2)(i)(C). When securities 
underlying warrants or convertible securities are being 
qualified pursuant to Tier 2 of Regulation A one year 
or more after the qualification of an offering for which 
investment limitations previously applied, purchasers of 
the underlying securities for which investment limitations 
would apply at that later date may determine compliance 
with the ten percent (10%) investment limitation using 
the conversion, exercise, or exchange price to acquire 
the underlying securities at that later time without aggre-
gating such price with the price of the overlying warrants 
or convertible securities.

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
170
(D)	The issuer may rely on a representation of the 
purchaser when determining compliance with 
the ten percent (10%) investment limitation in 
this paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C), provided that the 
issuer does not know at the time of sale that any 
such representation is untrue.
(ii)	 In a transaction that represents a sale by the 
issuer or an underwriter, or a sale by a dealer 
within 90 calendar days after qualification of 
the offering statement, each underwriter 
or dealer selling in such transaction must 
deliver to each purchaser from it, not later 
than two business days following the comple-
tion of such sale, a copy of the Final Offering 
Circular, subject to the following provisions:
(A)	If the sale was by the issuer and was not effected 
by or through an underwriter or dealer, the issuer 
is responsible for delivering the Final Offering 
Circular as if the issuer were an underwriter;
(B)	For continuous or delayed offerings pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the 90 calendar 
day period for dealers shall commence on the 
day of the first bona fide offering of securities 
under such offering statement;
(C)	If the security is listed on a registered national 
securities exchange, no offering circular need be 
delivered by a dealer more than 25 calendar days 
after the later of the qualification date of the offer-
ing statement or the first date on which the secu-
rity was bona fide offered to the public;
(D)	No offering circular need be delivered by a 
dealer if the issuer is subject, immediately prior 
to the time of the filing of the offering statement, 
to the reporting requirements of Rule 257(b) 
(§230.257(b)); and

Regulation A+
171
(E)	 The Final Offering Circular delivery requirements 
set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section may 
be satisfied by delivering a notice to the effect that 
the sale was made pursuant to a qualified offer-
ing statement that includes the uniform resource 
locator (“URL”), which, in the case of an elec-
tronic-only offering, must be an active hyperlink, 
where the Final Offering Circular, or the offering 
statement of which such Final Offering Circular 
is part, may be obtained on the Commission’s 
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval 
System (“EDGAR”) and contact information suf-
ficient to notify a purchaser where a request for 
a Final Offering Circular can be sent and received 
in response.
(3)	 Continuous or delayed offerings. (i) Continuous or 
delayed offerings may be made under this Regulation 
A, so long as the offering statement pertains only to:
(A)	Securities that are to be offered or sold solely by 
or on behalf of a person or persons other than 
the issuer, a subsidiary of the issuer, or a person 
of which the issuer is a subsidiary;
(B)	Securities that are to be offered and sold pursu-
ant to a dividend or interest reinvestment plan 
or an employee benefit plan of the issuer;
(C)	Securities that are to be issued upon the exercise 
of outstanding options, warrants, or rights;
(D)	Securities that are to be issued upon conversion 
of other outstanding securities;
(E)	 Securities that are pledged as collateral; or
(F)	 Securities the offering of which will be com-
menced within two calendar days after the quali-
fication date, will be made on a continuous basis, 
may continue for a period in excess of 30 calendar 
days from the date of initial qualification, and will 
be offered in an amount that, at the time the offer-
ing statement is qualified, is reasonably expected 
to be offered and sold within two years from the 
initial qualification date. These securities may be 
offered and sold only if not more than three years 
have elapsed since the initial qualification date 

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
172
of the offering statement under which they are 
being offered and sold; provided, however, that if a 
new offering statement has been filed pursuant to 
this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(F), securities covered by 
the prior offering statement may continue to be 
offered and sold until the earlier of the qualifica-
tion date of the new offering statement or 180 
calendar days after the third anniversary of the 
initial qualification date of the prior offering state-
ment. Before the end of such three-year period, 
an issuer may file a new offering statement cov-
ering the securities. The new offering statement 
must include all the information that would be 
required at that time in an offering statement 
relating to all offerings that it covers. Before the 
qualification date of the new offering statement, 
the issuer may include as part of such new offer-
ing statement any unsold securities covered by 
the earlier offering statement by identifying on the  
cover page of the new offering circular, or the  
latest amendment, the amount of such unsold 
securities being included. The offering of secu-
rities on the earlier offering statement will be 
deemed terminated as of the date of qualification 
of the new offering statement. Securities may be 
sold pursuant to this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(F) only if 
the issuer is current in its annual and semiannual 
filings pursuant to Rule 257(b) (§230.257(b)), at 
the time of such sale.
(ii)	 At the market offerings, by or on behalf of 
the issuer or otherwise, are not permitted 
under this Regulation A. As used in this para-
graph (d)(3)(ii), the term at the market offer-
ing means an offering of equity securities into 
an existing trading market for outstanding 
shares of the same class at other than a fixed 
price.
(e)	 Confidential treatment. A request for confiden-
tial treatment may be made under Rule 406 
(§230.406) for information required to be filed, 
and Rule 83 (§200.83) for information not 
required to be filed.

Regulation A+
173
(f)	 Electronic filing. Documents filed or otherwise 
provided to the Commission pursuant to this 
Regulation A must be submitted in electronic 
format by means of EDGAR in accordance with 
the EDGAR rules set forth in Regulation S-T (17 
CFR part 232).
§230.252 Offering Statement
(a)	 Documents to be included. The offering statement consists 
of the contents required by Form 1-A (§239.90 of this 
chapter) and any other material information necessary 
to make the required statements, in light of the circum-
stances under which they are made, not misleading.
(b)	 Paper, printing, language and pagination. Except as other-
wise specified in this rule, the requirements for offering 
statements are the same as those specified in Rule 403 
(§230.403) for registration statements under the Act. No 
fee is payable to the Commission upon either the submis-
sion or filing of an offering statement on Form 1-A, or any 
amendment to an offering statement.
(c)	 Signatures. The issuer, its principal executive officer, prin-
cipal financial officer, principal accounting officer, and a 
majority of the members of its board of directors or 
other governing body, must sign the offering statement 
in the manner prescribed by Form 1-A. If a signature is 
by a person on behalf of any other person, evidence of 
authority to sign must be filed, except where an executive 
officer signs for the issuer.
(d)	 Non-public submission. An issuer whose securities have 
not been previously sold pursuant to a qualified offering 
statement under this Regulation A or an effective regis-
tration statement under the Securities Act may submit 
a draft offering statement to the Commission for non-
public review by the staff of the Commission before pub-
lic filing, provided that the offering statement shall not be 
qualified less than 21 calendar days after the public filing 
with the Commission of:
(1)	 The initial non-public submission;
(2)	 All non-public amendments; and

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
174
(3)	 All non-public correspondence submitted by or on 
behalf of the issuer to the Commission staff regarding 
such submissions (subject to any separately approved 
confidential treatment request under Rule 251(e) 
(§230.251(e)).
(e)	 Qualification. An offering statement and any amendment 
thereto can be qualified only at such date and time as the 
Commission may determine.
(f)	 Amendments. (1)(i) Amendments to an offering state-
ment must be signed and filed with the Commission in 
the same manner as the initial filing. Amendments to an 
offering statement must be filed under cover of Form 
1-A and must be numbered consecutively in the order in 
which filed.
(ii)	 Every amendment that includes amended 
audited financial statements must include 
the consent of the certifying accountant to 
the use of such accountant’s certification in 
connection with the amended financial state-
ments in the offering statement or offering 
circular and to being named as having audited 
such financial statements.
(iii)	Amendments solely relating to Part III of 
Form 1-A must comply with the require-
ments of paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, 
except that such amendments may be limited 
to Part I of Form 1-A, an explanatory note, 
and all of the information required by Part III 
of Form 1-A.
(2)	 Post-qualification amendments must be filed in the 
following circumstances for ongoing offerings:
(i)	 At least every 12 months after the qualifica-
tion date to include the financial statements 
that would be required by Form 1-A as of 
such date; or

Regulation A+
175
(ii)	 To reflect any facts or events arising after 
the qualification date of the offering state-
ment (or the most recent post-qualification 
amendment thereof) which, individually or 
in the aggregate, represent a fundamental 
change in the information set forth in the 
offering statement.
§230.253 Offering Circular
(a)	 Contents. An offering circular must include the informa-
tion required by Form 1-A for offering circulars.
(b)	 Information that may be omitted. Notwithstanding para-
graph (a) of this section, a qualified offering circular may 
omit information with respect to the public offering price, 
underwriting syndicate (including any material relation-
ships between the issuer or selling securityholders and 
the unnamed underwriters, brokers or dealers), under-
writing discounts or commissions, discounts or commis-
sions to dealers, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, 
call prices and other items dependent upon the offering 
price, delivery dates, and terms of the securities depen-
dent upon the offering date; provided, that the following 
conditions are met:
(1)	 The securities to be qualified are offered for cash.
(2)	 The outside front cover page of the offering circu-
lar includes a bona fide estimate of the range of the 
maximum offering price and the maximum number 
of shares or other units of securities to be offered or 
a bona fide estimate of the principal amount of debt 
securities offered, subject to the following conditions:
(i)	 The range must not exceed $2 for offerings 
where the upper end of the range is $10 or 
less or 20% if the upper end of the price 
range is over $10; and
(ii)	 The upper end of the range must be used 
in determining the aggregate offering price 
under Rule 251(a) (§230.251(a)).

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
176
(3)	 The offering statement does not relate to securities 
to be offered by competitive bidding.
(4)	 The volume of securities (the number of equity secu-
rities or aggregate principal amount of debt securi-
ties) to be offered may not be omitted in reliance on 
this paragraph (b).
NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (b). A decrease in the volume of 
securities offered or a change in the bona fide estimate of 
the offering price range from that indicated in the offering 
circular filed as part of a qualified offering statement may be 
disclosed in the offering circular filed with the Commission 
pursuant to Rule 253(g) (§230.253(g)), so long as the 
decrease in the volume of securities offered or change in 
the price range would not materially change the disclo-
sure contained in the offering statement at qualification. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any decrease in the volume 
of securities offered and any deviation from the low or high 
end of the price range may be reflected in the offering circu-
lar supplement filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 
253(g)(1) or (3) (§230.253(g)(1) or (3)) if, in the aggregate, 
the decrease in volume and/or change in price represent 
no more than a 20% change from the maximum aggregate 
offering price calculable using the information in the qualified 
offering statement. In no circumstances may this paragraph 
be used to offer securities where the maximum aggregate 
offering price would result in the offering exceeding the 
limit set forth in Rule 251(a) (§230.251(a)) or if the change 
would result in a Tier 1 offering becoming a Tier 2 offering. 
An offering circular supplement may not be used to increase 
the volume of securities being offered. Additional securities 
may only be offered pursuant to a new offering statement or 
post-qualification amendment qualified by the Commission.
(c)	 Filing of omitted information. The information omitted 
from the offering circular in reliance upon paragraph (b) 
of this section must be contained in an offering circular 
filed with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (g) of 
this section; except that if such offering circular is not so 
filed by the later of 15 business days after the qualifica-
tion date of the offering statement or 15 business days 
after the qualification of a post-qualification amendment 
thereto that contains an offering circular, the information 
omitted in reliance upon paragraph (b) of this section 
must be contained in a qualified post-qualification amend-
ment to the offering statement.

Regulation A+
177
(d)	 Presentation of information. (1) Information in the offering 
circular must be presented in a clear, concise and under-
standable manner and in a type size that is easily readable. 
Repetition of information should be avoided; cross-refer-
encing of information within the document is permitted.
(2)	 Where an offering circular is distributed through 
an electronic medium, issuers may satisfy legibility 
requirements applicable to printed documents by 
presenting all required information in a format readily  
communicated to investors.
(e)	 Date. An offering circular must be dated approximately as 
of the date it was filed with the Commission.
(f)	 Cover page legend. The cover page of every offering cir-
cular must display the following statement highlighted by 
prominent type or in another manner:
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission 
does not pass upon the merits of or give its approval to any 
securities offered or the terms of the offering, nor does it 
pass upon the accuracy or completeness of any offering 
circular or other solicitation materials. These securities 
are offered pursuant to an exemption from registration 
with the Commission; however, the Commission has not 
made an independent determination that the securities 
offered are exempt from registration.
(g)	 Offering circular supplements. (1) An offering circular that 
discloses information previously omitted from the offer-
ing circular in reliance upon Rule 253(b) (§230.253(b)) 
must be filed with the Commission no later than two 
business days following the earlier of the date of deter-
mination of the offering price or the date such offering 
circular is first used after qualification in connection with 
a public offering or sale.

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
178
(2)	 An offering circular that reflects information other 
than that covered in paragraph (g)(1) of this section 
that constitutes a substantive change from or addition  
to the information set forth in the last offering circu-
lar filed with the Commission must be filed with the 
Commission no later than five business days after the 
date it is first used after qualification in connection 
with a public offering or sale. If an offering circular 
filed pursuant to this paragraph (g)(2) consists of an 
offering circular supplement attached to an offering 
circular that previously had been filed or was not 
required to be filed pursuant to paragraph (g) of this 
section because it did not contain substantive changes 
from an offering circular that previously was filed, only 
the offering circular supplement need be filed under 
paragraph (g) of this section, provided that the cover 
page of the offering circular supplement identifies the 
date(s) of the related offering circular and any offering 
circular supplements thereto that together constitute 
the offering circular with respect to the securities cur-
rently being offered or sold.
(3)	 An offering circular that discloses information, facts 
or events covered in both paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) 
of this section must be filed with the Commission no 
later than two business days following the earlier of 
the date of the determination of the offering price or 
the date it is first used after qualification in connec-
tion with a public offering or sale.
(4)	 An offering circular required to be filed pursuant to 
paragraph (g) of this section that is not filed within the 
time frames specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) 
of this section, as applicable, must be filed pursuant to 
this paragraph (g)(4) as soon as practicable after the 
discovery of such failure to file.
(5)	 Each offering circular filed under this section must 
contain in the upper right corner of the cover page 
the paragraphs of paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of 
this section under which the filing is made, and the 
file number of the offering statement to which the 
offering circular relates.

§230.254 Preliminary Offering Circular
After the filing of an offering statement, but before its qualification, written 
offers of securities may be made if they meet the following requirements:
(a)	 Outside front cover page. The outside front cover page of 
the material bears the caption Preliminary Offering Circular, 
the date of issuance, and the following legend, which must 
be highlighted by prominent type or in another manner:
An offering statement pursuant to Regulation A relat-
ing to these securities has been filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. Information contained in 
this Preliminary Offering Circular is subject to com-
pletion or amendment. These securities may not be 
sold nor may offers to buy be accepted before the 
offering statement filed with the Commission is quali-
fied. This Preliminary Offering Circular shall not con-
stitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to 
buy nor may there be any sales of these securities in 
any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would 
be unlawful before registration or qualification under 
the laws of any such state. We may elect to satisfy 
our obligation to deliver a Final Offering Circular by 
sending you a notice within two business days after 
the completion of our sale to you that contains the 
URL where the Final Offering Circular or the offering 
statement in which such Final Offering Circular was 
filed may be obtained.
(b)	 Other contents. The Preliminary Offering Circular con-
tains substantially the information required to be in an 
offering circular by Form 1-A (§239.90 of this chapter), 
except that certain information may be omitted under 
Rule 253(b) (§230.253(b)) subject to the conditions set 
forth in such rule.
(c)	 Filing. The Preliminary Offering Circular is filed as a part 
of the offering statement.

§230.255 Solicitations of Interest and  
Other Communications
(a)	 Solicitation of interest. At any time before the qualifi-
cation of an offering statement, including before the 
non-public submission or public filing of such offering 
statement, an issuer or any person authorized to act 
on behalf of an issuer may communicate orally or in 
writing to determine whether there is any interest 
in a contemplated securities offering. Such commu-
nications are deemed to be an offer of a security for 
sale for purposes of the antifraud provisions of the 
federal securities laws. No solicitation or acceptance 
of money or other consideration, nor of any com-
mitment, binding or otherwise, from any person is 
permitted until qualification of the offering statement.
(b)	 Conditions. The communications must:
(1)	 State that no money or other consideration is 
being solicited, and if sent in response, will not be 
accepted;
(2)	 State that no offer to buy the securities can be 
accepted and no part of the purchase price can 
be received until the offering statement is quali-
fied, and any such offer may be withdrawn or 
revoked, without obligation or commitment of 
any kind, at any time before notice of its accep-
tance given after the qualification date;
(3)	 State that a person’s indication of interest involves 
no obligation or commitment of any kind; and
(4)	 After the public filing of the offering statement:
(i)	 State from whom a copy of the most recent 
version of the Preliminary Offering Circular 
may be obtained, including a phone number 
and address of such person;
(ii)	 Provide the URL where such Preliminary 
Offering Circular, or the offering statement 
in which such Preliminary Offering Circular 
was filed, may be obtained; or
(iii)	Include a complete copy of the Preliminary 
Offering Circular.

Regulation A+
181
(c)	 Indications of interest. Any written communication 
under this rule may include a means by which a per-
son may indicate to the issuer that such person is 
interested in a potential offering. This issuer may 
require the name, address, telephone number, and/or 
email address in any response form included pursu-
ant to this paragraph (c).
(d)	 Revised solicitations of interest. If solicitation of inter-
est materials are used after the public filing of the 
offering statement and such solicitation of interest 
materials contain information that is inaccurate or 
inadequate in any material respect, revised solicita-
tion of interest materials must be redistributed in a 
substantially similar manner as such materials were 
originally distributed. Notwithstanding the foregoing 
in this paragraph (d), if the only information that is 
inaccurate or inadequate is contained in a Preliminary 
Offering Circular provided with the solicitation of 
interest materials pursuant to paragraphs (b)(4)(i) or 
(ii) of this section, no such redistribution is required 
in the following circumstances:
(1)	 in the case of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, 
the revised Preliminary Offering Circular will be 
provided to any persons making new inquiries 
and will be recirculated to any persons making 
any previous inquiries; or
(2)	 in the case of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this sec-
tion, the URL continues to link directly to the 
most recent Preliminary Offering Circular or 
to the offering statement in which such revised 
Preliminary Offering Circular was filed.

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
182
(e)	 Abandoned offerings. Where an issuer decides to reg-
ister an offering under the Securities Act after solic-
iting interest in a contemplated, but subsequently 
abandoned, Regulation A offering, the abandoned 
Regulation A offering would not be subject to inte-
gration with the registered offering if the issuer 
engaged in solicitations of interest pursuant to this 
rule only to qualified institutional buyers and institu-
tional accredited investors permitted by Section 5(d) 
of the Securities Act. If the issuer engaged in solicita-
tions of interest to persons other than qualified insti-
tutional buyers and institutional accredited investors, 
an abandoned Regulation A offering would not be 
subject to integration if the issuer (and any under-
writer, broker, dealer, or agent used by the issuer in 
connection with the proposed offering) waits at least 
30 calendar days between the last such solicitation of 
interest in the Regulation A offering and the filing of 
the registration statement with the Commission.
§230.256 Definition of “Qualified Purchaser”
For purposes of Section 18(b)(3) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77r(b)(3)], 
a “qualified purchaser” means any person to whom securities are offered or 
sold pursuant to a Tier 2 offering of this Regulation A.
§230.257 Periodic and Current Reporting; Exit Report
(a)	 Tier 1: Exit report. Each issuer that has filed an offering state-
ment for a Tier 1 offering that has been qualified pursuant 
to this Regulation A must file an exit report on Form 1-Z 
(§239.94 of this chapter) not later than 30 calendar days 
after the termination or completion of the offering.
(b)	 Tier 2: Periodic and current reporting. Each issuer that has 
filed an offering statement for a Tier 2 offering that has 
been qualified pursuant to this Regulation A must file 
with the Commission the following periodic and current 
reports:

Regulation A+
183
(1)	 Annual reports. An annual report on Form 1-K 
(§239.91 of this chapter) for the fiscal year in which 
the offering statement became qualified and for any 
fiscal year thereafter, unless the issuer’s obligation 
to file such annual report is suspended under para-
graph (d) of this section. Annual reports must be filed 
within the period specified in Form 1-K.
(2)	 Special financial report. (i) A special financial report on 
Form 1-K or Form 1-SA if the offering statement did 
not contain the following:
(A)	Audited financial statements for the issuer’s most 
recent fiscal year (or for the life of the issuer 
if less than a full fiscal year) preceding the fis-
cal year in which the issuer’s offering statement 
became qualified; or
(B)	unaudited financial statements covering the first 
six months of the issuer’s current fiscal year if the 
offering statement was qualified during the last 
six months of that fiscal year.
(ii)	 The special financial report described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section must be 
filed under cover of Form 1-K within 120 cal-
endar days after the qualification date of the 
offering statement and must include audited 
financial statements for such fiscal year or 
other period specified in that paragraph, as 
the case may be. The special financial report 
described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this 
section must be filed under cover of Form 
1-SA within 90 calendar days after the quali-
fication date of the offering statement and 
must include the semiannual financial state-
ments for the first six months of the issuer’s 
fiscal year, which may be unaudited.
(iii)	A special financial report must be signed in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
form on which it is filed.

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
184
(3)	 Semiannual report. A semiannual report on Form 1-SA 
(§239.92 of this chapter) within the period specified 
in Form 1-SA. Semiannual reports must cover the 
first six months of each fiscal year of the issuer, com-
mencing with the first six months of the fiscal year 
immediately following the most recent fiscal year 
for which full financial statements were included in 
the offering statement, or, if the offering statement 
included financial statements for the first six months 
of the fiscal year following the most recent full fiscal 
year, for the first six months of the following fiscal year.
(4)	 Current reports. Current reports on Form 1-U 
(§239.93 of this chapter) with respect to the mat-
ters and within the period specified in that form, 
unless substantially the same information has been 
previously reported to the Commission by the issuer 
under cover of Form 1-K or Form 1-SA.
(5)	 Reporting by successor issuers. Where in connection 
with a succession by merger, consolidation, exchange 
of securities, acquisition of assets or otherwise, secu-
rities of any issuer that is not required to file reports 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section are issued 
to the holders of any class of securities of another 
issuer that is required to file such reports, the duty 
to file reports pursuant to paragraph (b) of this sec-
tion shall be deemed to have been assumed by the 
issuer of the class of securities so issued. The suc-
cessor issuer must, after the consummation of the 
succession, file reports in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this section, unless that issuer is exempt from 
filing such reports or the duty to file such reports is 
terminated or suspended under paragraph (d) of this 
section.
(c)	 Amendments. All amendments to the reports described in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must be filed under 
cover of the form amended, marked with the letter A to 
designate the document as an amendment, e.g., “1-K/A,” 
and in compliance with pertinent requirements applicable 
to such reports. Amendments filed pursuant to this para-
graph (c) must set forth the complete text of each item 
as amended, but need not include any items that were 
not amended. Amendments must be numbered sequen-
tially and be filed separately for each report amended. 

Regulation A+
185
Amendments must be signed on behalf of the issuer by a 
duly authorized representative of the issuer. An amend-
ment to any report required to include certifications as 
specified in the applicable form must include new certifi-
cations by the appropriate persons.
(d)	 Suspension of duty to file reports. (1) The duty to file reports 
under this rule shall be automatically suspended if and so 
long as the issuer is subject to the duty to file reports 
required by section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act  
(15 U.S.C. 78m or 15 U.S.C. 78o).
(2)	 The duty to file reports under paragraph (b) of this 
section with respect to a class of securities held of 
record (as defined in Rule 12g5-1 (§240.12g5-1 of 
this chapter)) by less than 300 persons, or less than 
1,200 persons for a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)
(6) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6)), or a 
bank holding company (as defined in section 2 of 
the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1841)), shall be suspended for such class of securities 
immediately upon filing with the Commission an exit 
report on Form 1-Z (§239.94 of this chapter) if the 
issuer of such class has filed all reports due pursuant 
to this rule before the date of such Form 1-Z filing 
for the shorter of:
(i)	 The period since the issuer became subject 
to such reporting obligation; or
(ii)	 Its most recent three fiscal years and the 
portion of the current year preceding the 
date of filing Form 1-Z.
(3)	 For the purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this sec-
tion, the term class shall be construed to include all 
securities of an issuer that are of substantially similar 
character and the holders of which enjoy substan-
tially similar rights and privileges. If the Form 1-Z is 
subsequently withdrawn or if it is denied because the 
issuer was ineligible to use the form, the issuer must, 
within 60 calendar days, file with the Commission all 
reports which would have been required if such exit 
report had not been filed. If the suspension resulted 
from the issuer’s merger into, or consolidation with, 
another issuer or issuers, the notice must be filed by 
the successor issuer.

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
186
(4)	 The ability to suspend reporting, as described in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, is not available for 
any class of securities if:
(i)	 During that fiscal year a Tier 2 offering state-
ment was qualified;
(ii)	 The issuer has not filed an annual report 
under this rule or the Exchange Act for the 
fiscal year in which a Tier 2 offering state-
ment was qualified; or
(iii)	Offers or sales of securities of that class are 
being made pursuant to a Tier 2 Regulation A 
offering.
(e)	 Termination of duty to file reports. If the duty to file reports 
is suspended pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
and such suspension ends because the issuer terminates 
or suspends its duty to file reports under the Exchange 
Act, the issuer’s obligation to file reports under paragraph 
(b) of this section shall:
(1)	 Automatically terminate if the issuer is eligible to 
suspend its duty to file reports under paragraphs 
(d)(2) and (3) of this section; or
(2)	 Recommence with the report covering the most 
recent financial period after that included in any 
effective registration statement or filed Exchange 
Act report.
§230.258 Suspension of the Exemption
(a)	 Suspension. The Commission may at any time enter an 
order temporarily suspending a Regulation A exemption 
if it has reason to believe that:
(1)	 No exemption is available or any of the terms, condi-
tions or requirements of Regulation A have not been 
complied with;
(2)	 The offering statement, any sales or solicitation of 
interest material, or any report filed pursuant to Rule 
257 (§230.257) contains any untrue statement of a 
material fact or omits to state a material fact neces-
sary in order to make the statements made, in light 
of the circumstances under which they are made, not 
misleading;

Regulation A+
187
(3)	 The offering is being made or would be made in vio-
lation of section 17 of the Securities Act;
(4)	 An event has occurred after the filing of the offering 
statement that would have rendered the exemption 
hereunder unavailable if it had occurred before such 
filing;
(5)	 Any person specified in Rule 262(a) (§230.262(a)) has 
been indicted for any crime or offense of the char-
acter specified in Rule 262(a)(1) (§230.262(a)(1)), or 
any proceeding has been initiated for the purpose 
of enjoining any such person from engaging in or 
continuing any conduct or practice of the character 
specified in Rule 262(a)(2) (§230.262(a)(2)), or any 
proceeding has been initiated for the purposes of 
Rule 262(a)(3)-(8) (§230.262(a)(3) through (8)); or
(6)	 The issuer or any promoter, officer, director, or under-
writer has failed to cooperate, or has obstructed or 
refused to permit the making of an investigation by 
the Commission in connection with any offering made 
or proposed to be made in reliance on Regulation A.
(b)	 Notice and hearing. Upon the entry of an order under para-
graph (a) of this section, the Commission will promptly 
give notice to the issuer, any underwriter, and any selling 
securityholder:
(1)	 That such order has been entered, together with a 
brief statement of the reasons for the entry of the 
order; and
(2)	 That the Commission, upon receipt of a written 
request within 30 calendar days after the entry of the 
order, will, within 20 calendar days after receiving the 
request, order a hearing at a place to be designated 
by the Commission.
(c)	 Suspension order. If no hearing is requested and none is 
ordered by the Commission, an order entered under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall become permanent 
on the 30th calendar day after its entry and shall remain 
in effect unless or until it is modified or vacated by the 
Commission. Where a hearing is requested or is ordered 
by the Commission, the Commission will, after notice of 
and opportunity for such hearing, either vacate the order 
or enter an order permanently suspending the exemption.

Appendix A | Current Legal Authority
188
(d)	 Permanent suspension. The Commission may, at any time 
after notice of and opportunity for hearing, enter an order 
permanently suspending the exemption for any reason 
upon which it could have entered a temporary suspension 
order under paragraph (a) of this section. Any such order 
shall remain in effect until vacated by the Commission.
(e)	 Notice procedures. All notices required by this rule must 
be given by personal service, registered or certified mail 
to the addresses given by the issuer, any underwriter and 
any selling securityholder in the offering statement.
§230.259 Withdrawal or Abandonment  
of Offering Statements
(a)	 Withdrawal. If none of the securities that are the subject 
of an offering statement has been sold and such offering 
statement is not the subject of a proceeding under Rule 
258 (§230.258), the offering statement may be withdrawn 
with the Commission’s consent. The application for with-
drawal must state the reason the offering statement is to 
be withdrawn and must be signed by an authorized rep-
resentative of the issuer. Any withdrawn document will 
remain in the Commission’s files, as well as the related 
request for withdrawal.
(b)	 Abandonment. When an offering statement has been on 
file with the Commission for nine months without amend-
ment and has not become qualified, the Commission may, 
in its discretion, declare the offering statement aban-
doned. If the offering statement has been amended, the 
nine-month period shall be computed from the date of 
the latest amendment.

Regulation A+
189
§230.260 Insignificant Deviations from a Term,  
Condition or Requirement of Regulation A
(a)	 Failure to comply. A failure to comply with a term, condi-
tion or requirement of Regulation A will not result in the 
loss of the exemption from the requirements of section 
5 of the Securities Act for any offer or sale to a particular 
individual or entity, if the person relying on the exemp-
tion establishes that:
(1)	 The failure to comply did not pertain to a term, con-
dition or requirement directly intended to protect 
that particular individual or entity;
(2)	 The failure to comply was insignificant with respect 
to the offering as a whole, provided that any failure 
to comply with Rule 251(a), (b), and (d)(1) and (3) 
(§230.251(a), (b), and (d)(1) and (3)) shall be deemed 
to be significant to the offering as a whole; and
(3)	 A good faith and reasonable attempt was made to 
comply with all applicable terms, conditions and 
requirements of Regulation A.
(b)	 Action by Commission. A transaction made in reliance 
upon Regulation A must comply with all applicable terms, 
conditions and requirements of the regulation. Where 
an exemption is established only through reliance upon 
paragraph (a) of this section, the failure to comply shall 
nonetheless be actionable by the Commission under 
section 20 of the Securities Act.
(c)	 Suspension. This provision provides no relief or protec-
tion from a proceeding under Rule 258 (§230.258).

representations.
(b)	 Transition, waivers, reasonable care exception. Paragraph (a) 
of this section shall not apply:

(5) that occurred or was issued before June 19, 2015;
(2)	 Upon a showing of good cause and without preju-
dice to any other action by the Commission, if the 
Commission determines that it is not necessary 
under the circumstances that an exemption be denied;
(3)	 If, before the filing of the offering statement, the 
court or regulatory authority that entered the rel-
evant order, judgment or decree advises in writing

or decree or separately to the Commission or its 
staff) that disqualification under paragraph (a) of this 
section should not arise as a consequence of such

(4)	 If the issuer establishes that it did not know and, in the 
exercise of reasonable care, could not have known 
that a disqualification existed under paragraph (a) of

NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (b)(4). An issuer will not be 
able to establish that it has exercised reasonable care 
unless it has made, in light of the circumstances, fac-
tual inquiry into whether any disqualifications exist. 
The nature and scope of the factual inquiry will vary 
based on the facts and circumstances concerning, 
among other things, the issuer and the other offering 
participants.
(c)	 Affiliated issuers. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this sec-
tion, events relating to any affiliated issuer that occurred

(2)	 Under common control with the issuer by a third 
party that was in control of the affiliated entity at the 
time of such events.
(d)	 Disclosure of prior “bad actor” events. The issuer must 
include in the offering circular a description of any mat-
ters that would have triggered disqualification under para-
graphs (a)(3) and (5) of this section but occurred before 
June 19, 2015. The failure to provide such information 
shall not prevent an issuer from relying on Regulation A 
if the issuer establishes that it did not know and, in the 
exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the 
existence of the undisclosed matter or matters.
§230.263 Consent to Service of Process
(a)	 If the issuer is not organized under the laws of any of 
the states or territories of the United States of America, 
it shall furnish to the Commission a written irrevocable 
consent and power of attorney on Form F-X (§239.42 of 
this chapter) at the time of filing the offering statement 
required by Rule 252 (§230.252).
(b)	 Any change to the name or address of the agent for ser-
vice of the issuer shall be communicated promptly to the 
Commission through amendment of the requisite form 
and referencing the file number of the relevant offering 
statement.

Appendix B provides critical information on how the SEC intends to apply 
Regulation A in everyday scenarios. Often, federal regulatory agencies provide 
detailed rules like we see with Regulation A, but, given their complexity and 
interplay with other regulations, agencies will also provide informal guidance 
as to how they read their rules or intend to apply them.

Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations – 
Securities Act Rules; Regulation A1
Section182. Rules 251 to 263 [June 23, 2015]
Question 182.01
Question: Where an issuer elects to nonpublicly submit a draft offering 
statement for staff review pursuant to Rule 252(d) of Regulation A before 
publicly filing its Form 1A, Item 15 (Additional Exhibits) of Part III (Exhibits) 
to Form 1A requires issuers to file as an exhibit to the publiclyfiled offering 
statement: (1) any nonpublic, draft offering statement previously submitted 
pursuant to Rule 252(d), and (2) any related, nonpublic correspondence sub-
mitted by or on behalf of the issuers. Would an issuer that elects to make 
the nonpublic, draft offering statements public on the EDGARLink submis-
sions page of EDGAR (see Chapter 7 (Preparing and Transmitting EDGARLink 
Online Submissions) of Volume II of the EDGAR Filer Manual, available at:  
http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/edmanuals.htm) at the time it publicly 
files its Form 1A also be required to refile such material as an exhibit pursuant 
to Item 15 of Part III?
Answer: No. If, at the time it first files the offering statement publicly, the 
issuer makes public on the EDGARLink submissions page all prior nonpublic, 
draft offering statements, the offering statements will no longer be nonpublic 
and the issuer will not be required to file them as exhibits. The issuer is still 
required to file as an exhibit any related, nonpublic correspondence submit-
ted by or on behalf of the issuer regarding nonpublic draft offering statements 
submitted pursuant to Rule 252(d).
Question 182.02
Question: If an issuer elects to submit a draft offering statement for nonpub-
lic staff review before public filing pursuant to Rule 252(d), and, as part of that 
process, submits correspondence relating to its offering statement, what must it 
do if it wants to protect portions of that correspondence from public release?
Answer: During the review of the draft offering statement, the issuer would 
request confidential treatment of any information in the related corre-
spondence pursuant to Rule 83, in the same manner it would during a typi-
cal review of a registered offering. It would submit a redacted copy of the  
1http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/securitiesactrules-
interps.htm

Regulation A+
199
correspondence via EDGAR, with the appropriate legend indicating that it 
was being submitted pursuant to a confidential treatment request under Rule 
83. At the same time, it would submit an unredacted paper version to the 
SEC, in the manner required by that rule. When the issuer makes its public 
filing of the offering statement, it will be required to file as an exhibit to the 
electronically filed offering statement any previously submitted nonpublic cor-
respondence related to the non public review. Since that correspondence will 
be information required to be filed with the SEC, the issuer must redact the 
confidential information from the filed exhibit, include the required legends 
and redaction markings, and submit in paper format to the SEC’s Office of the 
Secretary an application for confidential treatment of the redacted informa-
tion under Rule 406. The staff will consider and act on that application in the 
same manner it would with any other application under Rule 406 for other 
types of filed exhibits. As with registered offerings, the review staff will act on 
Rule 406 confidential treatment applications before the offering statement is 
qualified. For the requirements a registrant must satisfy when requesting con-
fidential treatment, see Division of Corporation Finance Staff Legal Bulletin 
No. 1 (with Addendum).
Question 182.03
Question: Would a company with headquarters that are located within the 
United States or Canada, but whose business primarily involves managing 
operations that are located outside those countries be considered to have its 
“principal place of business” within the United States or Canada for purposes 
of determining issuer eligibility under Regulation A?
Answer: Yes, an issuer will be considered to have its “principal place of busi-
ness” in the United States or Canada for purposes of determining issuer eli-
gibility under Rule 251(b) of Regulation A if its officers, partners, or managers 
primarily direct, control and coordinate the issuer’s activities from the United 
States or Canada.
Question 182.04
Question: Is a company that was previously required to file reports with 
the Commission under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, but that has since 
suspended its Exchange Act reporting obligation, an eligible issuer under  
Rule 251(b)(2) of Regulation A?
Answer: Yes. A company that has suspended its Exchange Act reporting obli-
gation by satisfying the statutory provisions for suspension in Section 15(d) of 
the Exchange Act or the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 12h3 is not con-
sidered to be subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for purposes 
of Rule 251(b)(2) of Regulation A.

Appendix B | Current Guidance from SEC
200
Question 182.05
Question: Is a voluntary filer under the Exchange Act an eligible issuer for 
purposes of Rule 251(b)(2) of Regulation A?
Answer: Yes. A voluntary filer is not subject to Exchange Act Section 13 or 
15(d) because it is not obligated to file Exchange Act reports pursuant to 
either of those provisions.
Question 182.06
Question: Is a private whollyowned subsidiary of an Exchange Act reporting 
company parent eligible to sell securities pursuant to Regulation A?
Answer: Yes, although the Exchange Act reporting company parent could 
not be a guarantor or co issuer of the securities of the private whollyowned 
subsidiary.
Question 182.07
Question: Can Regulation A be relied upon by an issuer for business combi-
nation transactions, such as a merger or acquisition?
Answer: Yes. The final rules do not limit the availability of Regulation A for 
business combination transactions, but, as the Commission (SEC Rel. No. 
339497) indicated, Regulation A would not be available for business acquisi-
tion shelf transactions, which are typically conducted on a delayed basis. 
Question 182.08
Question: May a recently created entity choose to provide a balance sheet 
as of its inception date?
Answer: Yes, as long as the inception date is within nine months before the 
date of filing or qualification and the date of filing or qualification is not more 
than three months after the entity reached its first annual balance sheet date. 
The date of the most recent balance sheet determines which fiscal years, 
or period since existence for recently created entities, the statements of 
comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders’ equity must 
cover. When the balance sheet is dated as of inception the statements of 
comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders’ equity will 
not be applicable.

Regulation A+
201
Question 182.09
Question: Can an issuer solicit interest (or “test the waters”) in a Regulation 
A offering on a platform that limits the number of characters or amount of 
text that can be included, thereby preventing the inclusion in such communi-
cation of the information required by Rule 255?
Answer: Yes. The staff will not object to the use of an active hyperlink to 
satisfy the requirements of Rule 255 in the following limited circumstances:
• 
The electronic communication is distributed through a 
platform that has technological limitations on the number 
of characters or amount of text that may be included in 
the communication;
• 
Including the required statements in their entirety, 
together with the other information, would cause the 
communication to exceed the limit on the number of 
characters or amount of text; and
• 
The communication contains an active hyperlink to the 
required statements that otherwise satisfy Rule 255 and, 
where possible, prominently conveys, through introduc-
tory language or otherwise, that important or required 
information is provided through the hyperlink.
Where an electronic communication is capable of including the entirety of 
the required statements, along with the other information, without exceeding 
the applicable limit on number of characters or amount of text, the use of a 
hyperlink to the required statements would be inappropriate.
Question 182.10
Question: Are state securities law registration and qualification requirements 
preempted with respect to resales of securities purchased in a Tier 2 offering?
Answer: No. State securities law registration and qualification requirements 
are only preempted with respect to primary offerings of securities by the 
issuer or secondary offerings by selling securityholders that are qualified pur-
suant to Regulation A and offered or sold to qualified purchasers pursuant 
to a Tier 2 offering. Resales of securities purchased in a Tier 2 offering must 
be registered, or offered or sold pursuant to an exemption from registration, 
with state securities regulators.

Appendix B | Current Guidance from SEC

Question 182.11
Question: When is an issuer required to engage the services of a ­registered 
transfer agent before being able to avail itself of the conditional exemp-
tion from mandatory registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act 
described in Exchange Act Rule 12g51(a)(7)?
Answer: An issuer that seeks to rely on the conditional exemption from 
mandatory registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act must at the 
time of reliance on the conditional exemption satisfy the requirements of Rule 
12g51(a)(7).

1. Summary of Regulation A
On March 25, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
“Commission”) adopted final rules to implement Section 401 of the Jumpstart 
Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act by expanding Regulation A into two tiers: 
Tier 1, for securities offerings of up to $20 million in a 12-month period; and 
Tier 2, for securities offerings of up to $50 million in a 12-month period. An 
issuer of $20 million or less of securities can elect to proceed under either 
2http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/regulation-a-amendments-secg.shtml

Regulation A+
203
Tier 1 or Tier 2. The final rules for offerings under Tier 1 and Tier 2 build on 
current Regulation A and preserve, with some modifications, existing provi-
sions regarding issuer eligibility, offering circular contents, testing the waters, 
and “bad actor” disqualification. The final rules modernize the Regulation 
A filing process for all offerings, align practice in certain areas with prevail-
ing practice for registered offerings, create additional flexibility for issuers in 
the offering process, and establish an ongoing reporting regime for certain 
Regulation A issuers.
Under the final rules, Tier 2 issuers are required to include audited financial 
statements in their offering documents and to file annual, semiannual, and cur-
rent reports with the Commission on an ongoing basis. With the exception 
of securities that will be listed on a national securities exchange upon quali-
fication, purchasers in Tier 2 offerings must either be accredited investors,  
as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D, or be subject to certain 
limitations on their investment. The requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 offer-
ings are described more fully below.
2. Scope of Exemption
Understanding the scope of the exemption is important because not all issu-
ers are eligible to conduct offerings pursuant to Regulation A. Additionally, 
there are limitations on the types of securities that may be sold and on the 
amount of securities that may be sold by the issuer and selling securityholders, 
as well as other issues that may affect the issuer’s offering process pursuant 
to the exemption.
a. Eligible Issuers and Securities
Regulation A is available only to companies organized in and with their prin-
cipal place of business in the United States or Canada. It is not available to:
• 
companies subject to the ongoing reporting require-
ments of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;
• 
companies registered or required to be registered under 
the Investment Company Act of 1940 and BDCs;
• 
development stage companies that have no specific 
­business plan or purpose or have indicated that their 
business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with 
an unidentified company or companies (often referred to 
as, “blank check companies”);
• 
issuers of fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights, 
or similar interests in other mineral rights;

Appendix B | Current Guidance from SEC
204
• 
issuers that are required to, but that have not, filed with 
the Commission the ongoing reports required by the 
rules under Regulation A during the two years imme-
diately preceding the filing of a new offering statement  
(or for such shorter period that the issuer was required 
to file such reports);
• 
issuers that are or have been subject to an order by the 
Commission denying, suspending, or revoking the regis-
tration of a class of securities pursuant to Section 12(j) 
of the Exchange Act that was entered within five years 
before the filing of the offering statement; and
• 
issuers subject to “bad actor” disqualification under Rule 262.
The final rules limit the types of securities eligible for sale under Regulation 
A to the specifically enumerated list in Section 3(b)(3) of the Securities Act, 
which includes warrants and convertible equity and debt securities, among 
other equity and debt securities. The final rules exclude asset-backed securi-
ties from the list of eligible securities.
b. Offering Limitations and Secondary Sales
Issuers may elect to conduct a Regulation A offering pursuant to the require-
ments of either Tier 1 or Tier 2. Tier 1 is available for offerings of up to  
$20 million in a 12-month period, including no more than $6 million on behalf 
of selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer. Tier 2 is available for 
offerings of up to $50 million in a 12-month period, including no more than 
$15 million on behalf of selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer. 
Additionally, sales by all selling securityholders in a Regulation A offering are 
limited to no more than 30% of the aggregate offering price in an issuer’s first 
Regulation A offering and any subsequent Regulation A offerings in the follow-
ing 12-month period.
c. Investment Limitations in Tier 2 Offerings
Issuers that conduct a Tier 2 offering should note that Regulation A limits 
the amount of securities that an investor who is not an accredited investor 
under Rule 501(a) of Regulation D can purchase in a Tier 2 offering to no 
more than: (a) 10% of the greater of annual income or net worth (for natural 
persons); or (b) 10% of the greater of annual revenue or net assets at fiscal 
year end (for non-natural persons). This limit does not, however, apply to 
purchases of securities that will be listed on a national securities exchange 
upon qualification.

Regulation A+
205
d. Integration
The integration doctrine provides an analytical framework for determining 
whether multiple securities transactions should be considered part of the 
same offering. This analysis helps to determine whether registration under 
Section 5 of the Securities Act is required or an exemption is available for the 
entire offering. Generally, the determination as to whether particular securi-
ties offerings should be integrated calls for an analysis of the specific facts and 
circumstances. Regulation A, however, provides issuers with a safe harbor that 
offerings conducted pursuant to Regulation A will not be integrated with:
• 
prior offers or sales of securities; or
• 
subsequent offers or sales of securities that are:
• 
registered under the Securities Act, except as provided 
in Rule 255(c);
• 
made pursuant to Rule 701 under the Securities Act;
• 
made pursuant to an employee benefit plan;
• 
made pursuant to Regulation S;
• 
made pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act; or
• 
made more than six months after completion of the 
Regulation A offering.
e. Treatment under Section 12(g)
Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires, among other 
things, that an issuer with total assets exceeding $10,000,000 and a class of 
equity securities held of record by either 2,000 persons, or 500 persons 
who are not accredited investors, register such class of securities with the 
Commission. Regulation A, however, conditionally exempts securities issued 
in a Tier 2 offering from the mandatory registration provisions of Section 
12(g) for so long as the issuer remains subject to, and is current in (as of its 
fiscal year end), its Regulation A periodic reporting obligations. Additionally, 
in order for the conditional exemption to apply, issuers in Tier 2 offerings 
are required to engage the services of a transfer agent registered with the 
Commission pursuant to Section 17A of the Exchange Act. The final rules also 
provide that the conditional exemption from Section 12(g) is only available to 
companies that meet size-based requirements similar to those contained in 
the “smaller reporting company” definition under Securities Act and Exchange 
Act rules.[1] An issuer that exceeds the size-based requirements is granted a 
two-year transition period before it would be required to register its class of 
securities pursuant to Section 12(g), provided it timely files all ongoing reports 
due during such period.

Appendix B | Current Guidance from SEC
206
3. Offering Statement
All issuers that conduct offerings pursuant to Regulation A are required to 
electronically file an offering statement on Form 1-A on the Commission’s 
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system (EDGAR). Form 1-A 
consists of three parts:
• 
Part I: an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) based fill-
able form;
• 
Part II: a text file attachment containing the body of the 
disclosure document and financial statements; and
• 
Part III: text file attachments, containing the signatures, 
exhibits index, and the exhibits to the offering statement.
a. Part I
Part I of Form 1-A serves as a notice of certain basic information about the 
issuer and its proposed offering, which also helps to confirm the availability of 
the exemption. The notification in Part I of Form 1-A requires disclosure in 
response to the following items:
• 
Item 1. (Issuer Information) requires information about 
the issuer’s identity, industry, number of employees, finan-
cial statements and capital structure, as well as contact 
information.
• 
Item 2. (Issuer Eligibility) requires the issuer to certify 
that it meets various issuer eligibility criteria.
• 
Item 3. (Application of Rule 262 (“bad actor” disqualifica-
tion and disclosure)) requires the issuer to certify that 
no disqualifying events have occurred and to indicate 
whether related disclosure will be included in the offer-
ing circular.
• 
Item 4. (Summary Information Regarding the Offering and 
other Current or Proposed Offerings) includes indica-
tor boxes or buttons and text boxes eliciting information 
about the offering.
• 
Item 5. (Jurisdictions in Which Securities are to be 
Offered) requires information about the jurisdiction(s) in 
which the securities will be offered.
• 
Item 6. (Unregistered Securities Issued or Sold Within 
One Year) requires disclosure about unregistered issu-
ances or sales of securities within the last year.

Regulation A+
207
b. Part II
Part II of Form 1-A contains the primary disclosure document that an issuer 
will prepare in connection with a Regulation A offering, called an “offering 
circular.” Issuers are required to provide financial disclosure in Part II that 
follows the requirements of Part F/S of Form 1-A, while they have the option 
to prepare narrative disclosure that follows one of two different formats.[2]
i. Offering Circular Format
The Offering Circular format is a simplified and scaled version of the narrative 
disclosure requirements otherwise required to be provided by issuers in reg-
istered offerings on Form S-1. In addition to the availability of certain scaled 
disclosure items, the Offering Circular format is meant to simplify the process 
by which an issuer prepares its narrative disclosure by limiting the need for 
issuers to look outside the form for disclosure guidance.
ii. Part I of Form S-1 or Part I of Form S-11 Formats
Part I of Form S-1 and Part I of Form S-11 contain the narrative disclosure 
requirements for registration statements filed by issuers in registered offer-
ings. In addition to the Offering Circular format, issuers may provide narrative 
disclosure in Part II of Form 1-A that follows the requirements of Part I of 
Form S-1 or, in certain circumstances, Part I of Form S-11. While Form S-1 is 
generally available for all types of issuers and transactions, Form S-11 is only 
available for offerings of securities issued by (i) real estate investment trusts, 
or (ii) issuers whose business is primarily that of acquiring and holding for 
investment real estate or interests in real estate or interests in other issu-
ers whose business is primarily that of acquiring and holding real estate or 
interest in real estate for investment. Part I of both Form S-1 and Form S-11 
generally describes narrative disclosure requirements by cross-reference to 
the item requirements of Regulation S-K.
iii. Part F/S (Financial Statements)
Part II of Form 1-A requires issuers to provide financial statements that com-
ply with the requirements of Part F/S. Part F/S requires issuers in both Tier 1 
and Tier 2 offerings to file balance sheets and related financial statements for 
the two previous fiscal year ends (or for such shorter time that they have been 
in existence). For Tier 1 offerings, issuers are not required to provide audited 
financial statements unless the issuer has already prepared them for other pur-
poses. Issuers in Tier 2 offerings are required to include financial statements in 
their offering circulars that are audited in accordance with either the auditing 
standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) 
(referred to as U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards or GAAS) or the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Part 
F/S requires issuers in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 offerings to include financial 
statements in Form 1-A that are dated not more than nine months before 

Appendix B | Current Guidance from SEC
208
the date of non-public submission, filing, or qualification, with the most recent 
annual or interim balance sheet not older than nine months. If interim financial 
statements are required, they must cover a period of at least six months.
c. Part III
Part III of Form 1-A requires issuers to file certain documents as exhibits 
to the offering statement. Issuers are required to file the following exhib-
its with the offering statement: underwriting agreement; charter and by-laws; 
instrument defining the rights of securityholders; subscription agreement; 
voting trust agreement; material contracts; plan of acquisition, reorganization, 
arrangement, liquidation, or succession; escrow agreements; consents; opinion 
regarding legality; “testing the waters” materials; appointment of agent for ser-
vice of process; materials related to non-public submissions; and any additional 
exhibits the issuer may wish to file.
d. Non-Public Submission of Draft Offering Statements
Issuers whose securities have not been previously sold pursuant to a ­qualified 
offering statement under Regulation A or an effective registration statement 
under the Securities Act are allowed to submit to the Commission a draft 
offering statement for non-public review by the staff. Consistent with the 
treatment of draft registration statements in registered offerings, a non-pub-
licly submitted offering statement must be substantially complete upon sub-
mission in order for staff of the Division of Corporation Finance to begin 
its review. All non-public submissions of draft offering statements must be 
submitted electronically via EDGAR, and the initial non-public submission, all 
non-public amendments thereto, and correspondence submitted by or on 
behalf of the issuer to the Commission staff regarding such submissions must 
be publicly filed and available on EDGAR not less than 21 calendar days before 
qualification of the offering statement.
e. Qualification
Issuers are only permitted to begin selling securities pursuant to Regulation 
A once the offering statement has been qualified by the Commission. The 
Division of Corporation Finance has delegated authority to declare offering 
statements qualified by a “notice of qualification,” which is analogous to a 
notice of effectiveness in registered offerings.
4. Solicitation of Interest Materials
Issuers are permitted to “test the waters” with, or solicit interest in a potential 
offering from, the general public either before or after the filing of the offering 
statement, provided that all solicitation materials include the legends required 
by the final rules and, after publicly filing the offering statement, are preceded 
or accompanied by a preliminary offering circular or contain a notice inform-
ing potential investors where and how the most current preliminary offering 
circular can be obtained.

Regulation A+
209
5. Ongoing Reporting
Issuers in Tier 1 offerings are required to provide information about sales in 
such offerings and to update certain issuer information by electronically filing 
a Form 1-Z exit report with the Commission not later than 30 calendar days 
after termination or completion of an offering. Issuers in Tier 2 offerings are 
required to electronically file annual and semiannual reports, as well as current 
reports and, in certain circumstances, an exit report on Form 1-Z, with the 
Commission on EDGAR.
a. Annual Report on Form 1-K (Tier 2 Issuers Only)
Issuers in Tier 2 offerings are required to electronically file annual reports 
with the Commission on EDGAR on Form 1-K within 120 calendar days 
of the issuer’s fiscal year end. Form 1-K requires issuers to update certain 
information previously filed with the Commission pursuant to Part I of Form 
1-A, as well as to provide disclosure relating to the issuer’s business opera-
tions for the preceding three fiscal years (or, if in existence for less than three 
years, since inception), related party transactions, beneficial ownership of the 
issuer’s securities, executive officers and directors, including certain executive 
compensation information, management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) of 
the issuer’s liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations, and two years 
of audited financial statements.
b. Semiannual Report on Form 1-SA (Tier 2 Issuers Only)
Issuers in Tier 2 offerings are required to electronically file semiannual reports 
with the Commission on EDGAR on Form 1-SA within 90 calendar days after 
the end of the first six months of the issuer’s fiscal year. Form 1-SA requires 
issuers to provide disclosure primarily relating to the issuer’s interim financial 
statements and MD&A.
c. Current Report on Form 1-U (Tier 2 Issuers Only)
Issuers in Tier 2 offerings are required to electronically file current reports 
with the Commission on EDGAR on Form 1-U within four business days of 
the occurrence of one (or more) of the following events:
• 
Fundamental changes;
• 
Bankruptcy or receivership;
• 
Material modification to the rights of securityholders;
• 
Changes in the issuer’s certifying accountant;
• 
Non-reliance on previous financial statements or a 
related audit report or completed interim review;
• 
Changes in control of the issuer;

Appendix B | Current Guidance from SEC
210
• 
Departure of the principal executive officer, principal 
financial officer, or principal accounting officer; and
• 
Unregistered sales of 10% or more of outstanding equity 
securities.
d. Exit Report on Form 1-Z (Tier 1 and Tier 2 Issuers)
Issuers in Tier 1 offerings are required to electronically file with the 
Commission on EDGAR certain summary information on terminated or 
completed Regulation A offerings in an exit report on Part I of Form 1-Z not 
later than 30 calendar days after termination or completion of an offering. 
Issuers conducting Tier 2 offerings are required to provide this information in 
Part I of Form 1-Z, if such information was not previously provided on Form 
1-K as part of their annual report, at the time of filing information in response 
to Part II of Form 1-Z.
Issuers in Tier 2 offerings that have filed all ongoing reports required by 
Regulation A for the shorter of (1) the period since the issuer became sub-
ject to such reporting obligation or (2) its most recent three fiscal years and 
the portion of the current year preceding the date of filing Form 1-Z may 
immediately suspend their ongoing reporting obligations under Regulation A 
at any time after completing reporting for the fiscal year in which the offering 
­statement was qualified, if the securities of each class to which the offering 
statement relates are held of record by fewer than 300 persons and offers or 
sales made in reliance on a qualified Tier 2 offering statement are not ongo-
ing. In such circumstances, an issuer’s obligation to continue to file ongoing 
reports in a Tier 2 offering under Regulation A would be suspended immedi-
ately upon the electronic filing of a notice with the Commission on Part II of 
Form 1-Z.
6. Bad Actor Disqualification
The “bad actor” disqualification provisions contained in Rule 262 of Regulation 
A disqualify securities offerings from reliance on Regulation A if the issuer 
or other relevant persons (such as underwriters, placement agents, and the 
directors, officers and significant shareholders of the issuer) (collectively, “cov-
ered persons”) have experienced a disqualifying event, such as being convicted 
of, or subject to court or administrative sanctions for, securities fraud or 
other violations of specified laws.
a. Covered Persons
Understanding the categories of persons that are covered by Rule 262 is 
important because issuers are required to conduct a factual inquiry to 
­determine whether any covered person has had a disqualifying event, and the 
existence of such an event will generally disqualify the offering from reliance 
on Regulation A.

Regulation A+
211
“Covered persons” include:
• 
the issuer, including its predecessors and affiliated issuers
• 
directors, general partners, and managing members of the 
issuer
• 
executive officers of the issuer, and other officers of the 
issuers that participate in the offering
• 
20 percent beneficial owners of the issuer, calculated on 
the basis of voting power
• 
promoters connected with the issuer in any capacity
• 
persons compensated for soliciting investors, ­including 
their directors, executive officers or other officers 
­participating in the offerings, general partners and manag-
ing members
b. Disqualifying Events
Under the final rule, disqualifying events include:
• 
Certain criminal convictions
• 
Certain court injunctions and restraining orders
• 
Certain final orders of certain state and federal regulators
• 
Certain SEC disciplinary orders
• 
Certain SEC cease-and-desist orders
• 
Suspension or expulsion from membership in a self-regu-
latory organization (SRO), such as FINRA, or from asso-
ciation with an SRO member
• 
SEC stop orders and orders suspending the Regulation 
A exemption
• 
U.S. Postal Service false representation orders
Many disqualifying events include a look-back period (for example, a court 
injunction that was issued within the last five years or a regulatory order that 
was issued within the last ten years). The look-back period is measured from 
the date of the disqualifying event—for example, the issuance of the injunction 
or regulatory order and not the date of the underlying conduct that led to the 
disqualifying event—to the date of the filing of an offering statement.

Appendix B | Current Guidance from SEC
212
c. Reasonable Care Exception
The final rule provides an exception from disqualification when the issuer is 
able to demonstrate that it did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable 
care, could not have known that a covered person with a disqualifying event 
participated in the offering.
The steps an issuer should take to exercise reasonable care will vary accord-
ing to particular facts and circumstances. A note to the rule states that an 
issuer will not be able to establish that it has exercised reasonable care unless 
it has made, in light of the circumstances, factual inquiry into whether any 
disqualification exists.
d. Other Exceptions
i. Determination of issuing authority
Disqualification will not arise if, before the filing of the offering statement, 
the court or regulatory authority that entered the relevant order, judgment 
or decree advises in writing—whether in the relevant judgment, order or 
decree or separately to the Commission or its staff—that disqualification 
under Regulation A should not arise as a consequence of such order, judg-
ment or decree.
ii. Disclosure of pre-existing events
Disqualification will not arise as a result of disqualifying events relating to 
final orders of certain state and federal regulators or certain SEC cease-and-
desist orders that occurred before June 19, 2015, the effective date of the 
rule amendments. Matters that existed before the effective date of the rule 
and would otherwise be disqualifying are, however, required to be disclosed in 
writing to investors in Part II of Form 1-A.
e. Waivers
i. Waiver for good cause shown
The final rule provides for the ability to seek waivers from disqualification by 
the Commission upon a showing of good cause that it is not necessary under 
the circumstances that the exemption be denied. Staff has identified a number 
of circumstances that could, depending upon the specific facts, be relevant to  
the evaluation of a waiver request for good cause shown: http://www.sec.gov/
divisions/corpfin/guidance/disqualification-waivers.shtml. 
Issuers may view past applications and waivers granted under Regulation A by 
referring to the following page: http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/
cf-noaction.shtml#3b. Staff in the Office of Small Business Policy is also avail-
able to discuss potential waiver concerns over the phone at (202) 551-3460.

Regulation A+
213
7. Relationship with State Securities Laws
a. Tier 1 Offerings
In addition to qualifying a Regulation A offering with the Commission, issuers 
in Tier 1 offerings must register or qualify their offering in any state in which 
they seek to offer or sell securities pursuant to Regulation A. Issuers wishing 
to obtain information on state-specific registration requirements should con-
tact state securities regulators in the states in which they intend to offer or 
sell securities for further guidance on compliance with state law requirements. 
Issuers may also obtain useful information on state securities law registration 
and qualification requirements, including the option to have Tier 1 offerings 
that will be conducted in multiple states reviewed pursuant to a coordinated 
state review program, by visiting the website of the North American Securities 
Administrators Association (NASAA) at www.nasaa.org.
b. Tier 2 Offerings
While issuers in Tier 2 offerings are required to qualify offerings with the 
Commission before sales can be made pursuant to Regulation A, they are not 
required to register or qualify their offerings with state securities regulators. 
Tier 2 offerings by such issuers, however, remain subject to state law enforce-
ment and antifraud authority. Additionally, issuers in Tier 2 offerings may be 
subject to filing fees in the states in which they intend to offer or sell securi-
ties and be required to file with such states any materials that the issuer has 
filed with the Commission as part of the offering. The failure to file, or pay 
filing fees regarding, any such materials may cause state securities regulators 
to suspend the offer or sale of securities within their jurisdiction. Issuers 
should contact state securities regulators in the states in which they intend 
to offer or sell securities for further guidance on compliance with state law 
requirements.
8. Transition Issues
Issuers conducting sales of securities pursuant to a Regulation A offering 
statement that was qualified by the Commission before June 19, 2015 may 
continue to do so. Such offerings are considered Tier 1 offerings after the 
effectiveness of the final rules on June 19, 2015. Qualified offering statements 
under the preexisting rules for Regulation A are, however, incompatible with 
the final requirements for Tier 2 offerings, and issuers that wish to transition 
to a Tier 2 offering need to file a post-qualification amendment to their previ-
ously qualified offering statement that satisfies the requirements for Tier 2 in 
order to do so.
On and after June 19, 2015, issuers conducting Regulation A offerings under 
the preexisting rules must begin to comply with the final rules for Tier 1 
offerings, including, for example, the requirement of electronic filing and the 
rules for post-qualification amendments, at the time of their next filing under 

Appendix B | Current Guidance from SEC
214
Regulation A. Additionally, after effectiveness of the final rules, issuers that 
previously provided offering statements that were qualified using the Model 
A disclosure format of Part II of the Form 1-A must, at the time of their next 
filing due under Regulation A, file or amend such offering statement using a 
disclosure format that is permissible under the final rules for Tier 1 offer-
ings. Model A is no longer permitted for post-qualification amendments of 
qualified offerings that pre-date effectiveness of the final rules. Lastly, an issuer 
that is offering securities pursuant to a qualified offering statement under 
the preexisting rules will, upon effectiveness of the final rules, no longer be 
required to file a Form 2-A, but instead be required to file a Form 1-Z with the 
Commission electronically upon completion or termination of the offering.
On or after June 19, 2015, issuers that are in the review process for the quali-
fication of a Regulation A offering statement based on materials filed with the 
Commission before June 19, 2015 will be required to comply with the final 
rules, including the requirements for electronic filing and, where applicable, 
transitioning to a disclosure format that is approved for Regulation A offer-
ings. The issuer may elect to proceed at that time with its offering under the 
final requirements for either Tier 1 or Tier 2 offerings, provided it follows the 
requirements for the respective tiers.

[1] See 17 CFR 240.12g5-1(a)(7). Under Securities Act and Exchange Act rules, 
a smaller reporting company is generally an issuer that has a public float of less 
than $75 million, determined as of the last business day of its most recently 
completed second fiscal quarter, or, in the absence of a public float, annual 
revenues of less than $50 million, as of the most recently completed fiscal 
year. See Securities Act Rule 405, 17 CFR 230.405, Exchange Act Rule 12b-2,

the SEC at the Open Meeting held March 25, 2015 to adopt the Amendments 
to Regulation A.
Statement at Open Meeting on Rule 15b9-1 
and Reg A+
Chair Mary Jo White
March 25, 2015
Good morning. This is an open meeting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission on March 25, 2015 under the Government in Sunshine Act. The 
Commission today will consider two recommendations, one from the Division 
of Trading and Markets and the other from the Division of Corporation 
Finance—a proposed amendment to Rule 15b9-1 of the Exchange Act and 
the adoption of Regulation A+ under the JOBS Act.
Rule 15b9-1
[Deleted]
Regulation A+
The second item on our agenda is a recommendation from the Division of 
Corporation Finance to adopt final rules implementing Title IV of the JOBS 
Act. The JOBS Act requires the Commission to adopt rules to create a new 
exemption from registration under the Securities Act for offerings of up to 
$50 million dollars in a twelve month period.
This mandate, often referred to as Regulation A+, is designed to help enhance 
the ability of small companies to access capital. Small companies are essential 
to the livelihood of millions of Americans, fueling economic growth and creat-
ing jobs. As I have said in the past, it is critically important for the Commission 
to consider ways that our rules can facilitate capital-raising by smaller com-
panies. Congress recognized the importance of providing new avenues for 
capital-raising when it adopted the JOBS Act, which provides for crowdfund-
ing as well Regulation A+.
Existing Regulation A is rarely used by issuers. A 2012 GAO Report cited 
various factors that have contributed to its lack of use, including the overlap-
ping requirements of federal and state law over such offerings. Our goal in 
this rulemaking is to make Regulation A+ an effective, workable path to raising 
capital that also provides strong investor protections. The staff will describe 

Regulation A+
219
their recommendations for this final rule in more detail, but one issue that I 
will address first is preemption, an issue of particular interest and importance.
The final rules we are considering today seek to address the challenges pre-
sented by federal and state securities registration and qualification by strik-
ing an appropriate balance for the roles of federal and state law. In light of 
the significant investor protections included in the rules and the need to 
develop a workable exemption, the rules would preempt state registration 
and qualification laws for certain offerings of up to $50 million in what we call 
Tier 2 offerings. While the establishment of the North American Securities 
Administrators Association’s (NASAA) coordinated review program is a very 
positive development, it is a new program and at this stage concerns remain 
about the costs associated with state securities law registration and qualifi-
cation requirements, even under a coordinated review program, which may 
deter issuers from using Regulation A. To create an updated exemption that 
will be a viable path for capital raising, a calibrated preemption of state securi-
ties laws in connection with Regulation A offerings is necessary, at least until 
there is a track record from which to judge whether the functioning of the 
coordinated review program may obviate need for preemption.
Importantly, under the rule we are considering today, there continues to be, 
a strong role for states to play in offerings under Regulation A. NASAA has 
made great progress in implementing its coordinated review program for 
Regulation A offerings, and issuers can avail themselves of that program for 
offerings of up to $20 million, in Tier 1 offerings. It will be informative to see 
how the program works in practice in connection with these offerings, and the 
Commission is committed to monitoring the operation of Regulation A to see 
whether efficiencies in the coordinated program merit further evaluation of 
whether such a program could effectively operate within the broader context 
of Regulation A+. It is also important to emphasize that the states retain their 
full anti-fraud powers and may require that issuers using Regulation A+ file 
their offering documents with the states. Also, in recognition of the important 
role of state securities regulators and our relationship with them, we are cur-
rently exploring ways to further collaborate with our state colleagues, includ-
ing establishing a program for a representative of NASAA or a state securities 
regulator to work with the staff in the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance 
as it implements these rules and considers other issues of mutual interest.
The final rules we are considering today benefitted greatly from public com-
ment we received and the staff’s thorough and careful analysis. I look forward 
to continuing to work with my fellow Commissioners, the staff, state securities 
regulators, and market participants to help Regulation A+ become a vibrant 
capital-raising option that also protects investors in these offerings. As we go 
forward, the staff will be actively monitoring and assessing the implementation 
and development of the Regulation A+ regime, which will include a review of 
the $50 million aggregate offering limitation for Tier 2 offerings, as required by 

Appendix C | Public Statements of Commissioners at  
Open Meeting to Adopt Regulation A+
220
the JOBS Act. As reflected in the release, I have also directed the staff, within 
five years of the adoption of Regulation A+, to review the impact of both Tier 
1 and 2 offerings on capital formation and investor protection and report its 
findings to the Commission so that we can consider possible changes to the 
Regulation A+ offering regime.
Before I turn the proceedings over to Keith Higgins, the Director of the 
Division of Corporation Finance, to discuss the recommendations, I would 
like to thank the staff for all of their efforts to develop these very important 
rules. Specifically, I would like to thank Keith Higgins, Betsy Murphy, Sebastian 
Gomez Abero, Zachary Fallon, ShehzadNiazi, Raquel Fox, Mark Kronforst, 
Craig Olinger, Lindsay McCord, Jim Budge, Heather Mackintosh, and Sylvia 
Pilkerton in the Division of Corporation Finance; Annie Small, Rich Levine, 
Bryant Morris, and Dorothy McCuaig in the Office of the General Counsel; 
Mark Flannery, Scott Bauguess, Vanessa Countryman, SimonaMola Yost, and 
AnzhelaKnyazeva in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis; and Jeff Minton, 
Blair Petrillo, Brian Croteau, Kevin Stout and Wes Kelly in the Office of the 
Chief Accountant. I also would again like to thank my fellow Commissioners 
and their counsels for their hard and productive work on these rules.
Statement at Open Meeting on Reg A+
Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher
March 25, 2015
Thank you, Chair White. Today I am delighted that the Commission is fulfilling 
its JOBS Act mandate to revitalize Regulation A, which has, for too long, been 
an underused way of raising capital, particularly as compared to its better-
known cousin, Regulation D. We have an urgent need to ensure that our rules 
promote capital formation for small businesses, and I hope that public exempt 
offerings under Regulation A can take their place beside private exempt offer-
ings under Regulation D and registered offerings as viable means of raising 
capital. Indeed, I’ve not been shy about my view that Title IV of the JOBS Act 
set the stage for us to do something revolutionary to encourage small busi-
ness capital formation.
I’d like to thank the Division of Corporation Finance, particularly Keith Higgins, 
Sebastian Gomez Abero, Zachary Fallon, and ShehzadNiazi; the Division of 
Economic and Risk Analysis; and the Office of the General Counsel for the 
hard work and dedication put into getting this rule done.
The SEC’s rules today generally hew closely to the text and spirit of the JOBS 
Act, and for that they should be applauded. In particular, the rules raise the 
offering limit under Tier 2 to $50 million, and preempt offers and sales of 
securities in Tier 2 offerings. According to a GAO report, a low offering limit 

Regulation A+
221
and the lack of state preemption have been critical reasons for the lack of 
Regulation A offerings, and today’s rule squarely addresses those two issues. 
I am also pleased to see some other useful features in the rule, such as a 
streamlined path for Exchange Act registration of Regulation A securities, and 
real efforts to scale the Tier 2 periodic reporting regime for smaller-sized issu-
ers, including the novel approach of semiannual reporting. I believe these fea-
tures balance the need to provide investors with up-to-date, decision-useful 
information while avoiding unnecessary requirements that would over-burden 
issuers.
That said, there are a few areas where this rule falls short—where we could 
have safely done more to facilitate capital formation, but lacked the boldness 
to take the needed action. With the expectation that we will at some point in 
the future revisit this rule—perhaps as part of a discrete post-implementation 
review process that we are required to implement under Executive Order 
13579—I wanted to run through a few of these areas.
First, I am quite disappointed that the offering limit was not raised in the final 
rule. Congress in the JOBS Act gave us a baseline number, $50 million, but 
also told us in no uncertain terms that we have the authority to raise the 
cap, and that we are mandated to consider doing so every two years. I don’t 
believe $50 million was chosen out of any particular necessity—perhaps it 
was just 10 times bigger than the old limit, and Congress knew we needed at 
a minimum an order of magnitude change in our rule. We should not have 
felt constrained by Congress’s statutory floor, but rather should have done 
the analysis and picked our own number. Unfortunately, the rule today simply 
implements Congress’s limit and takes a wait-and-see approach on raising it. I 
look forward to the biennial study of the threshold, to be done by April 2016 
according to today’s release, and hope we can take bold action then.
Second, the rule introduces a needless transactional friction by failing to deem 
Regulation A’s semiannual reporting to be “reasonably current” for purposes 
of Rules 15c2-11, 144, and 144A. By not deeming balance sheets with dates 
up to 9 months to be “reasonably current,” issuers may need to file updated 
financial statements on a “voluntary” basis on Form 1-U in order to bring cur-
rent the issuer’s financial information. Without such “voluntary” filing, issuers 
may spend half the year—two periods of three months each—in blackout 
periods during which new quotations cannot be initiated, or resales made 
under Rules 144 and 144A. In the past, the Commission has assumed that 
quarterly reporting was necessary to meet the “reasonably current” require-
ment, but in conjunction with adopting semiannual reporting today, it would 
have been more than appropriate to provide that such reporting meets the 
reasonably current requirement. Unfortunately, we have not done so, thereby 
creating a risk that our rules today backdoor a quarterly reporting require-
ment on issuers, as securityholders or broker-dealers demand that these 
more frequent filings be made.

Appendix C | Public Statements of Commissioners at  
Open Meeting to Adopt Regulation A+
222
Third, we should have allowed reporting issuers to use Regulation A. It’s not 
entirely clear why issuers already complying with the full periodic reporting 
regime would have wanted to do a Regulation A offering, but on the other 
hand Private Investments in Public Equity, or PIPEs, are clearly used from time 
to time. Perhaps a use for a Regulation A offering, or what I will call a half-PIPE, 
would have developed too—at which time we could have assessed that use 
and determined whether additional restrictions were necessary. But it never 
will now, because we couldn’t see our way to giving issuers the flexibility. This 
is too bad.
While we’re on the topic of scoping, I do want to note that, while I agreed with 
the decision not to extend Regulation A to Business Development Companies, 
I do think we should consider whether improvements to Regulation E for 
BDCs would be useful.
Fourth, I think we should have provided a clean 12(g) exemption, without 
the age-out provision included in the final rule. Exchange Act Section 12(g) 
was intended to ensure that companies with broad enough public share-
holder bases would be required to provide periodic information to investors. 
Critically, our Tier 2 reporting regime already largely accomplishes that goal. 
And simple economics dictates that at some point, even a robust Regulation A 
regime is going to be insufficient for a larger company, which will instead need 
to do a registered offering, and can enter the full periodic reporting regime 
at that point.[1]
All this being said, however, we shouldn’t let the perfect be the enemy of the 
good, and let me be clear, this is a good rule that we are adopting today.
But, as good as the rule may be, it should not be the end of the Commission’s 
capital formation agenda. The development of venture exchanges for small 
cap shares, including Regulation A issuances, would greatly enhance liquidity in 
these shares, thereby facilitating greater demand and higher prices for the ini-
tial issuances of these securities. I am very glad to see that today’s rule commits 
to the continued exploration of venture exchanges, including for Regulation A 
shares. Congress appears to be thinking about this issue as well—which is all 
the more reason why we should move forward expeditiously. We shouldn’t 
tempt Congress to force us to promote capital formation when we can do it 
ourselves, organically. With venture exchanges, we may need Congress’s help 
with certain statutory provisions, but we should be proactively conveying that 
to Congress rather than passively waiting for Congress to ask us.
Finally, I believe that the amendments we are adopting today don’t go far 
enough to help issuers that are trying to raise under $5 million. Issuers that 
want to raise more can do so, and the greater offering proceeds will help off-
set the offering costs, but companies that are only looking to raise the smaller 
amount aren’t helped by our action. The entity doing the most for these com-
panies is NASAA. If they can make the coordinated review program for state 

Regulation A+
223
blue sky laws a success—that is, if they can get the remaining states to sign 
on, and then to stick closely together rather going their separate ways—it 
will be a significant achievement. I encourage continued SEC cooperation 
with NASAA on Tier 1 offerings, and will be watching closely to see how the 
coordinated review program operates in practice. Moreover, we at the SEC 
should be continuing to look for other ways to help companies that are look-
ing to raise very small amounts of capital. If there are other ways to structure 
our exemptions so as to provide sufficient protections to investors without 
being cost-prohibitive for companies, we should do so.
But those are topics for another day (although hopefully another day in the 
very near future). We have to start somewhere, and today’s rule is a very 
good place to start. I am happy to support it, and I have no questions.
[1] Entry into the full Section 13 reporting regime obviously carries with 
it several significant, new burdens. And the Commission seems to want to 
add more burdens every day, even on small companies. Even if these burdens 
seem to be individually minor, their effect in the aggregate is significant. See, 
e.g., Rel. No. 33-9723, Disclosure of Hedging by Employees, Officers and Directors 
(Feb. 9, 2015); see also Commissioners Daniel M. Gallagher & Michael S. 
Piwowar, Joint Public Statement, Joint Statement on the Commission’s Proposed 
Rule on Hedging Disclosures (Feb. 9, 2015). This proliferation of regulations 
(see, e.g., Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher, Public Statement, Statement on 
the Aggregate Impact of Financial Services Regulations (Mar. 2, 2015), available at 
http://www.sec.gov/news/statement/aggregate-impact-of-financial-
services-regulation.html) creates disincentives for companies to raise 
capital in the public markets and grow.
Helping Small Businesses and Protecting 
Investors
Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar
March 25, 2015
The Commission has long recognized that small businesses are essential to 
the growth and success of our national economy.[1] Our nation’s 28 million 
small business owners create almost two out of every three new jobs and 
employ more than half of the U.S. workforce.[2] The long-term success of our 
country’s small businesses, however, depends on their access to capital.[3]For 
this reason, Congress has provided the Commission with authority to pass 
rules to make it easier for small businesses to raise capital.[4] One rule which 
has historically been used by small businesses is Regulation A—an exemptive 
rule that has been around nearly as long as the SEC.[5] Regulation A provides 
companies with a streamlined and less costly way to raise capital, so long as 

Appendix C | Public Statements of Commissioners at  
Open Meeting to Adopt Regulation A+
224
they provide the investing public with certain critical disclosures about the 
company and the securities being offered.[6]
To be eligible for the Regulation A exemption, an issuer is limited in the amount 
of securities that it can offer and sell during any 12-month period. When 
initially adopted in 1936, this offering limit was $100,000.[7] Subsequently, 
the offering limit was raised three additional times—to $300,000 in 1945, to 
$500,000 in 1972, and to $1.5 million in 1978.[8] In 1992, as part of a package 
that facilitated access to the capital markets for start-up and developing com-
panies, the Commission raised the Regulation A offering ceiling once again to 
its current cap of $5 million.[9]
Although Regulation A has been frequently relied upon since it was introduced, 
the use of this exemption has declined over the years. In 1960, for example, 
more than one thousand companies filed Regulation A notifications with the 
Commission.[10] By 1997, only 116 offerings were filed under Regulation A, 
which declined even further to only 19 in 2011.[11] In addition, the number of 
these offerings that were ultimately deemed “qualified”—meaning securities 
could actually be sold to investors—went from 57 offerings in 1997 to only 
one offering in 2011.[12]Although these numbers rose slightly between 2012 
and 2014, when 26 offerings were qualified, the numbers still remain low.[13] 
If the success of a regulatory exemption is measured by how often it is used, 
then Regulation A has been failing.
The reduction in Regulation A offerings has been largely attributed to a few 
factors. First, the 1982 enactment of new registration exemptions under 
Regulation D became more attractive options to many issuers who could 
have used Regulation A.[14] Second, a report by the U.S. Government 
Accountability Office (“GAO”) and many commenters point to the relatively 
low dollar amounts that could be raised, and the costs and burdens of state 
blue sky laws, as reasons why issuers chose not to use Regulation A.[15] 
Today’s amendments address both of these concerns, among others.
Protecting Investors While Making Regulation  
A Work for Small Businesses
First, as mandated by Section 401 of the JOBS Act, the Commission is increas-
ing the dollar amount that can be raised from $5 million to $50 million.[16] 
Most notably, the amendments create two tiers of issuances that provide a 
higher ceiling for use of the registration exemption: “Tier 1” for securities 
offerings of up to $20 million in any 12-month period; and “Tier 2” for offer-
ings up to $50 million in the same period.[17]
In addition to raising the ceiling as to the amount that can be raised, the adopt-
ing amendments, commonly referred to as “Regulation A-plus,” make other 
changes to facilitate the use of Regulation A and enhance investor protection.

Regulation A+
225
Currently, Regulation A requires issuers to, among other things, file certain 
information with the Commission and provide investors with an offering cir-
cular that discloses certain narrative and financial information about the issuer 
and the securities being offered.[18] While these disclosures are important, 
it is also recognized that these disclosures are far less comprehensive than 
would be required in a registered offering.[19] This is a particular concern 
as to investments in small businesses. The statistics demonstrate that invest-
ments in small enterprises are inherently riskier than investments in larger 
companies with proven track records.[20] For example, the U.S. Small Business 
Administration found that over 50% of small businesses fail within the first five 
years.[21] According to a separate study, eight out of ten entrepreneurs who 
start businesses fail within the first 18 months.[22]
In recognition of these concerns, today’s Regulation A-plus amendments 
include new provisions designed to enhance investor protections. Specifically, 
today’s rules strengthen the standards for issuer eligibility.[23] In addition, 
for higher Tier 2 offerings, the rules require certain new critical disclosures, 
such as audited financial statements and ongoing disclosures after the offering 
is completed.[24] Moreover, Tier 2 offerings provide for certain investment 
limits on what investors can put at risk.[25] Ultimately, although still not as 
robust as required in a full registration, these new provisions increase the 
disclosures, transparency, and protections of Regulation A.[26]
The Important Role of State Regulators
Today’s rule also addresses the role of state securities regulators. As is well 
known, this has been a very contentious issue. A 2012 study by the GAO 
found that, among other factors, the cost of addressing both federal review and 
state blue sky laws has been an impediment to the greater use of Regulation A 
by small businesses.[27] Subsequently, at the time the Commission proposed 
the Regulation A amendments, the rules preempted the application of certain 
state blue sky requirements with respect to all offerees in Regulation A offer-
ings, and all purchasers in Tier 2 offerings.
At the proposing stage, the Commission recognized that preemption of the 
state review of Regulation A offerings was a step that required deliberate 
and serious consideration. State regulators have a long and proud history of 
protecting investors, and their localized knowledge and resources have been 
instrumental in detecting and preventing fraud. Moreover, the Commission 
was also aware that NASAA[28] was developing a coordinated review pro-
gram intended to lessen the burden of multi-state review of Regulation A 
offerings.
In that regard, the proposing release urged interested parties to comment on 
the pros and cons of incorporating state review into the Regulation A process. 
During the comment period, the Commission received a number of letters 

Appendix C | Public Statements of Commissioners at  
Open Meeting to Adopt Regulation A+
226
on the issue of preemption,[29] and it is fair to say that the commenters’  
letters reflect a wide spectrum of divergent views.[30] These letters have 
been very informative and have contributed to the Commission’s deliberation 
on this issue. Letters from NASAA, specific state regulators, and an issuer also 
informed the Commission that NASAA has made great strides in developing 
a program to lessen the burdens of multi-state reviews.[31] Specifically, nearly 
all of the state securities regulators have joined a multi-state coordinated 
review program[32] that is expected to substantially reduce the compliance 
costs for small businesses seeking to receive state approval for Regulation A 
offerings.[33]
After considering all the important factors associated with state involvement 
in Regulation A offerings, and the creation of the new coordinated review 
program, the Commission has now determined not to preempt blue sky 
review for offerees in Tier 1 offerings, and, additionally, the Commission is also 
increasing the ceiling on Tier 1 offerings from $5 million to $20 million.[34]
Furthermore, as to Tier 2 offerings, the Regulation A-plus rules address the 
concern that preempting state blue sky review will deprive state regulators of 
the benefit of a preview of certain riskier offerings before these offerings are 
sold to the public in their states. Accordingly, first-time Regulation A-plus issu-
ers must publicly file their offering statements with the Commission at least 
21 days before qualification. This filing requirement will allow state securities 
regulators to require issuers to file such material with them for a minimum of 
21 calendar days before any potential sales occur to investors in their respec-
tive states.[35]
It is also important to note that nothing the Commission does today limits 
the ability of state securities regulators to investigate and bring anti-fraud 
enforcement actions involving Regulation A-plus, or limits the state regulators 
in investigating and bringing actions against broker-dealers for unlawful con-
duct in Regulation A-plus transactions.[36]
Information Sharing with State Regulators
In addition, the Commission is currently in discussions with NASAA to allow 
a representative of a state securities regulator to be embedded with the 
SEC staff and be involved in staff assessment of Regulation A-plus offerings.
[37] One of the goals of this new arrangement is for states to have an unfil-
tered preview into the Regulation A-plus market for preempted offerings. 
Among other things, one of the benefits of this arrangement would be that the 
NASAA representative can be involved as the SEC staff reviews Regulation 
A-plus filings.[38]

Regulation A+
227
Today, I will vote to approve the rules being considered. There are aspects of 
the rule that I would have liked to have seen stronger, however—such as addi-
tional disclosures as to the equity compensation received by insiders in the 
year prior to an offering.[39] Nevertheless, despite challenges, today’s rules 
go a long way in balancing the promotion of capital formation and investor 
protection.
In closing, I would like to thank the staff from the Division of Corporation 
Finance, the Division of Economic Research and Analysis, the Office of the 
Chief Accountant, and the Office of the General Counsel for their work on 
this rulemaking. I appreciate your dedication, and the important work you do 
to protect investors.
Thank you.

between 1993 and mid-2013, or more than 14 million of the nearly 23 million 
net new jobs created during this period. See U.S. Small Business Administration

purposes, small businesses are defined as those independent businesses with 
fewer than 500 employees. The Commission has promulgated a number of 
regulations aimed at allowing these small businesses to sell securities with-
out having to comply with the full registration requirements of the Securities 
Act. See, for example, Rules 504 and 505 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the 
“Securities Act”).

the problem of financing small business” in various ways, including increasing 
the scope of the Commission’s exemptive power under Securities Act Section 
3(b), which provides the statutory authority for Regulation A.).
[5] Regulation A was originally adopted as an exemption from registra-
tion in 1936 under the authority of Section 3(b) of the Securities Act of 
1933 (the “Securities Act”). See Amendments to Regulation A, SEC Release 
No. 33-9741, (Mar. 25, 2015), at fn. 864, available at http://www.sec.gov/
rules/final/2015/33-9741.pdf (hereinafter “Regulation A-plus Adopting 
Release”). By its terms, Regulation A is not restricted to small business issuers. 
Rather, the rule requires that issuers be one of the following: (i) an entity orga-
nized under the laws of the United States or Canada, or any State, Province, 

Appendix C | Public Statements of Commissioners at  
Open Meeting to Adopt Regulation A+
228
Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, with its principal 
place of business in the United States or Canada; (ii) not be subject to sec-
tion 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) 
immediately before the offering; (iii) not be a development stage company 
that either has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its 
business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies; (iv) not 
be an investment company registered or required to be registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940; (v) not issue fractional undivided interests 
in oil or gas rights, or a similar interests in other mineral rights; and (vi) not 
otherwise be disqualified under the issue ineligibility provisions of Rule 262 of 
the Securities Act. See Rule 251(a) of the Securities Act. However, the SEC has 
amended Regulation A in the past to specifically address capital raising issues 
faced by small business issuers. See, e.g., Small Business Initiatives, SEC Release 
No. 33-6949 (Jul. 30, 1992), available at https://www.sec.gov/rules/

to Securities Act registration exemptions under Rule 504 and Regulation A 
and the inauguration of an integrated registration and reporting system for 
small business issuers, the Commission has completed the first of its Small 
Business Initiatives announced in March of this year. … The March proposals 
were enthusiastically received by the small business commenters as a signifi-
cant step to facilitating access to the public market for start-up and developing 
companies, and reducing the costs for small businesses to undertake to have 
their securities traded in the public markets.”)
[6] Regulation A exemption allows eligible companies to publicly offer and 
sell securities without the costs and obligations of a full registration under 
the Securities Act of 1933, provided that, among other things, they file certain 
information with the Commission and provide investors with an offering cir-
cular that discloses certain narrative and financial information about the issuer 
and the securities being offered. See Rules 251 to 263 of the Securities Act,

Regulation A-plus Adopting Release at Section III.C.3 (Offering Limitations

Regulation A offerings could increase the overall amount of securities subject 
to initial and ongoing disclosure requirements that are less extensive than 
the requirements for registered offerings being offered to the general public, 
which may result in less informed decisions by investors.”). Moreover, small 
business issuers relying on the current Regulation A exemption do not have to 
file audited financial statements with the Commission (unless audited financial 
statements are otherwise available), and do not have to file ongoing periodic 
financial reports required of registrants under the Exchange Act.
[20] These risks include, among other things, the likelihood of small business 
failure, the lower liquidity of these securities, and, unfortunately, the higher risk 
of fraud in the small business security markets. See, e.g., Robert Longley, Why 
Small Businesses Fail: SBA (2014) (noting that over 50% of small businesses fail 
within the first five years), available at http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/

[23] Today’s amendments would increase the eligibility requirements for all 
Regulation A-plus issuers, such as prohibiting issuers who have had their regis-
tration revoked by the Commission within the past five years or have failed to 
file ongoing disclosures, if required, within the past two years. See Regulation 
A-plus Adopting Release at Rule 230.251(b) Issuer. In addition, today’s amend-
ments would conform the Bad Actor disqualification provisions in Regulation 
A to those currently applied to Rule 506(d) offerings. The Regulation A-plus 
final rules, thus, include two new disqualification triggers not previously pres-
ent in Regulation A: (1) final orders and bars of certain state and other federal 
regulators; and (2) Commission cease-and-desist orders relating to viola-
tions of scienter-based anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws or 

Regulation A+
231
Section 5 of the Securities Act. See Regulation A-plus Adopting Release at 
Rule 230.262(a)(3) and (5) (Disqualification Provisions).
[24] Today’s amendments would require Tier 2 issuers to include audited finan-
cial statements in offering circulars and to file audited financial statements 
with the Commission annually, and to provide ongoing disclosures to inves-
tors about the financial condition of the company on an annual and semiannual 
basis, with additional requirements to provide interim current event updates. 
See Regulation A-plus Adopting Release at Section II.A. (Final Rules and 
Amendments to Regulation A. Overview). In addition, the financial statements 
required under Regulation A-plus only require compliance with U.S. GAAS 
per AICPA standards, rather than the more robust standards promulgated 
by the PCAOB. While today’s rules could have required financial statements 
to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB standards, audits conducted in 
accordance with U.S. GAAS, as the adopting release notes, provide protection 
for investors in Regulation A offerings, especially in light of the requirement 
that auditors for Tier 2 offerings must be independent under Rule 2-01 of 
Regulation S-X. Moreover, the staff advises that requiring PCAOB standards 
would have subjected issuers using Regulation A-plus to audit their financial 
statements both per the PCAOB standards and the AICPA standards as a 
result of statutory interpretation under Section 2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002; this is a burden not shared by companies registered under the 
Securities Act. See Regulation A-plus Adopting Release at Section II.C.3.b.(2).
(c) (Final Rules for Financial Statements).
[25] Today’s amendments would require that Tier 2 investors either be accred-
ited investors or be restricted to investing only up to 10% of their annual 
income or net worth, whichever is greater, unless the securities are listed on a 
national securities exchange. The definition of “accredited investor” applicable 
to Rule 506 is set forth in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.501(a)] 
and includes any person who comes within one of the definition’s enumerated 
categories of persons, or whom the issuer “reasonably believes” comes within 
any of the enumerated categories, at the time of the sale of the securities to 
that person. The categories include: (A) any natural person whose individual 
net worth, or joint net worth with that person’s spouse, exceeds $1,000,000, 
excluding the person’s primary residence and any indebtedness secured 
thereby (up to the value of such residence); and (B) any natural person who 
had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the two most recent 
years or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of $300,000 in each 
of those years and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income 
level in the current year. I have spoken several times recently about the need to 
revise the “accredited investor” definition, and urge the Commission to accom-
plish this task in the near term. See Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar, Revisiting 
the “Accredited Investor” Definition to Better Protect Investors (Dec. 17, 2014),  
available at http://www.sec.gov/news/statement/spch121714laa.html,

Formation (Nov 20, 2014), available at http://www.sec.gov/News/
PublicStmt/Detail/PublicStmt/1370543532516. The 10% investment 
limitation applies only to natural persons. In the case of non-natural persons, 
the 10% investment limitation is applied to 10% of the greater of annual rev-
enue and net assets at fiscal year-end. See Regulation A-plus Adopting Release 
at Section II.A. (Final Rules and Amendments to Regulation A. Overview).
At the proposing stage of today’s rules, the Commission asked for comment 
on whether there should be investment limits imposed on Tier 1 offerings in 
order to provide for state preemption of those offerings. In response, sev-
eral commenters wrote the Commission stating that in the absence of state 
blue sky preemption, the Commission should not impose investment limits 
on purchasers in Regulation A offerings (whether Tier 1 or Tier 2 offerings). In 
particular, NASAA submitted a comment letter indicating that investment lim-
itations are unnecessary if there is appropriate state oversight. See Comment 
Letter from NASAA (Mar. 24, 2014), available at http://www.sec.gov/
comments/s7-11-13/s71113-75.pdf. In addition, a second commenter 
noted that imposing investment limitations in offerings in which the states 
are not preempted has the potential to impose conflicting investor protection 
standards at the state and federal level, specifically in those instances where 
the states impose their own investor limitation standards. See Comment 
Letter from Groundfloor Finance Inc. (Nov. 18, 2014), available at http://
www.sec.gov/comments/s7-11-13/s71113-139.pdf.
[26] We should also be mindful that today’s rules will be ineffectual if there 
is no liquid, transparent, and fair secondary market for trading in Regulation 
A-plus shares. As I have spoken about on several other occasions, we will 
need to work to promote a workable secondary trading environment for 
the many securities that will be available to the public without the typical 
disclosures accustomed to registered securities. See, e.g., Commissioner 
Luis A. Aguilar, The Need for Greater Secondary Market Liquidity for Small 
Businesses (Mar. 4, 2015), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/state-
ment/need-for-greater-secondary-market-liquidity-for-small-
businesses.html; Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar, The Importance of Small 
Business Capital Formation (Nov. 20, 2014), available at http://www.sec.gov/

Luis A. Aguilar, Promoting Investor Protection in Small Business Capital Formation  
(Dec. 18, 2013), available at http://www.sec.gov/News/PublicStmt/
Detail/PublicStmt/1370542557949. Indeed, today’s Regulation A-plus 
rules would substantially expand the dollar amount of securities that could be 
issued to the public without restrictions, and could therefore be immediately 
traded by security holders who are not affiliates of the issuer. See Securities 
Act §3(b)((2)(C), as added by JOBS Act §401(a); Rule 144 under the Securities 
Act. If we do not ensure a viable secondary trading environment for these 

Regulation A+
233
securities, investors could be left holding illiquid and hard-to-value securities, 
and the anticipated capital formation benefits of today’s rules will be lost.
[27] See GAO Report at 15. As part of the JOBS Act, Congress mandated that 
the GAO conduct a study on the impact of state blue sky laws on Regulation 
A offerings. See JOBS Act, Section 402.

[30] For example, many commenters objected to the proposed preemption 
of state securities law registration and qualification requirements. These com-
menters pointed out that, among other things, state regulators provide impor-
tant investor protection benefits as a result of their localized knowledge and 
resources that may assist in detecting and preventing fraud. See, e.g.,Comment

[34] The Commission is required by Section 3(b)(5) of the Securities Act 
to review the Tier 2 offering limitation every two years. As stated in the 
adopting release, in addition to revisiting the Tier 2 offering limitation, the 
Commission staff is also undertaking to review the Tier 1 offering limitation 
at the same time. The staff also will undertake to study and submit a report 
to the Commission no later than five years following the adoption of today’s 
amendments to Regulation A, on the impact of both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 
offerings on capital formation and investor protection. The report will include, 
but not be limited to, a review of: (1) the amount of capital raised under the 
amendments; (2) the number of issuances and amount raised by both Tier 1 
and Tier 2 offerings; (3) the number of placement agents and brokers facilitat-
ing the Regulation A offerings; (4) the number of Federal, State, or any other 
actions taken against issuers, placement agents, or brokers with respect to 
both Tier 1 and Tier 2 offerings; and (5) whether any additional investor pro-
tections are necessary for either Tier 1 or Tier 2. Based on the information 
contained in the report, the Commission may propose to either decrease or 
increase the offering limit for Tier 1, as appropriate. See Regulation A-plus 
Adopting Release at Section II.A. (Final Rules and Amendments to Regulation 
A. Overview).
[35] It is possible, however, that a state’s notice filing requirements may 
reduce the time period in which an offering statement and related materials 
are on file with the state before Commission qualification. See Regulation A 
Adopting Release at Section II.C.2.c. (Non-public submission of Draft Offering 
Statements).

[39] I would have also liked to see the increased use of tagged data, particu-
larly using XBRL, to allow the SEC and the public to better analyze an issuer’s 
information. Today’s amendments require tagged data in XML fillable format 
in only certain documents, including Part I of Form 1-A and Part I of Form 
1-K. However, unlike registered companies, companies using Regulation A-plus 
will not be required to submit financial statements using XBRL format. See

Requirements) and Section II.E.1. (Continuing Disclosure Obligations).
Statement at Open Meeting on Adoption of 
Regulation A Amendments
Commissioner Michael S. Piwowar
March 25, 2015
Thank you, Chair White. I am pleased that we are adopting amendments to 
Regulation A to implement Title IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups 
Act, or JOBS Act. Title IV was enacted to facilitate capital formation by small 
and emerging businesses. Today’s amendments were rooted in a bipartisan bill, 
championed by Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Senator Jon Tester of 
Montana. So it is quite appropriate—nearly three years after the President 
signed the JOBS Act into law on April 5, 2012—for the bipartisan Commission 
to finally adopt the implementing regulations.
Keeping in mind the criticisms of current Regulation A, as thoroughly docu-
mented in a report by the Government Accountability Office,[1] the amend-
ments we are adopting today will provide small businesses with additional 
options for raising capital. Although today’s release is not exactly my preferred 
approach, it is nonetheless a consensus approach that all of the Commissioners 
can agree fulfills the statutory mandate in a manner consistent with our core 
mission. In my opening remarks at the proposal stage, I raised the issue as to 
whether we might consider a new regulatory model in which an issuer could 
seek qualification of a Regulation A offering from either the Commission or a 
state securities regulator.[2] I thank Commissioner Stein for working closely 
with me on the development of this alternative.
With respect to our action today in particular, the new rules will allow an 
issuer a choice to conduct either a Tier 1 or Tier 2 offering for amounts up 
to $20 million. This approach will afford the Commission an opportunity to 

Regulation A+
237
observe choices among issuers as to which approach is more likely to be 
taken. Moreover, the increased Tier 1 offering level will afford the potential 
opportunity for state securities regulators to be involved in more offerings 
under new Regulation A through their new coordinated review program. I 
thank Commissioner Aguilar for starting the conversation about increasing 
the maximum Tier 1 offering level, without sacrificing any investor protection, 
and Commissioner Stein for suggesting the components of a retrospective 
review that will help the Commission determine whether to adjust the offer-
ing limit for Tier 1 in the future.
Our capital formation efforts for small business, however, should not, and will 
not, stop here. I hope that we will soon consider further expansion of Rule 
504 under Regulation D as well as potential exemptive relief under the intra-
state exemption to allow for regional crowdfunding conducted pursuant to 
state securities laws.
Finally, I would like to thank the staff from the Division of Corporation Finance, 
the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, the Office of the General Counsel, 
and others for their efforts in finalizing today’s release. I also greatly appreciate 
the efforts of my fellow commissioners to finalize these amendments. I have 
no questions and I support the staff’s recommendation.

Statement at Open Meeting on Reg A+
Commissioner Kara M. Stein
March 25, 2015
Today’s amendments to Regulation A are the next step in the Commission’s 
effort to respond to changes in our securities offering regulations required by 
the JOBS Act. While I would have preferred today’s amendments take a differ-
ent approach to preemption, I support the rule today and I truly hope it will 
successfully provide new options for small and mid-sized offerings.
The Federal securities laws have long recognized that one-size does not fit all. 
The Commission adopted Regulation A in 1936 as one of the earliest alter-
natives to full registration of an issuer’s securities with the Commission.[1]  
It was designed to provide smaller companies with a more streamlined 
approach to obtaining Commission approval to offer securities to the general 
public. The required disclosures and review by the Commission and the state 
securities regulators provided the basic investor protections for the offering.

Appendix C | Public Statements of Commissioners at  
Open Meeting to Adopt Regulation A+
238
However, over the years Regulation A has been lightly used. Whether it was 
the ease of making a private offering under Regulation D or other reasons,[2] 
last year barely any money was raised through the Regulation A offering  
process.  Regulation D private placements, on the other hand, raised over  
$1 trillion.[3]
So why wasn’t Regulation A being used for private offerings? If improvements 
were made, would it be used more often to raise smaller amounts of capital 
for smaller companies? Congress believed that it could be improved so that its 
usage would increase, and directed the Commission to expand Regulation A.
Until today, Regulation A offerings were limited to an aggregate amount of $5 
million in a twelve-month period. The amendments we are adopting today 
create two tiers of offerings and expand the aggregate amount. Tier 1 can be 
used to raise up to $20 million in capital in a twelve-month period, while Tier 
2, also known as Regulation A+, can be used for offerings of up to $50 million 
in a twelve-month period.
Tier 1 offerings are subject to both SEC and state review initially. Upon quali-
fication, however, Tier 1 offerings have significantly fewer ongoing reporting 
requirements. I am concerned that this structure too closely mirrors the 
original Regulation A, and still might not be utilized. However, I hope that the 
increased offering size will encourage use of this new option. I look forward to 
seeing how the states work with the issuers to support these offerings, while 
still thoughtfully protecting investors.
Tier 2 has the potential, I believe, to work effectively for capital raises between 
$20 million and $50 million. It appropriately includes additional regulatory 
requirements, such as filing an offering circular which Commission staff will 
review before qualifying the offering, audited financial statements, and annual 
reports. Additionally, the amount of securities a non-accredited investor can 
purchase is capped when buying securities not listed on a national exchange.  
I am also pleased that any exemption from registration under section 12(g) 
of the Exchange Act is conditioned upon, among other things, a $75 million 
or less public float or, in the absence of a public float, revenues of less than  
$50 million. Today’s approach, I hope, allows companies to grow and develop, 
but ultimately graduate on to full registration status.
Overall, I have ongoing concerns about how well today’s changes will work 
in practice. I do not know if the structure in place will prove as useful as I 
would like, or as Congress envisioned. I am pleased, though, that the language 
of the release requires the staff to undertake to study and submit a report 
to the Commission no later than 5 years following the adoption of today’s 
amendments. Among other things, this report requires the staff to assess the 
amount of capital raised by the amendments, the number of issuances, and the 
incidences of fraud and other violations.  At that time, the Commission can 
reevaluate this structure and make appropriate adjustments.

Regulation A+
239
To that end, I look forward to working with investors, small businesses, the 
states, and others to help us improve the capital formation process so that 
we can have a palette of options available to companies at different stages in 
their development.
In closing, I would like to thank Sebastian Gomez, Zachary Fallon, Shehzad Niazi, 
Raquel Fox, Lindsey McCord and everyone else from the Division of 
Corporation Finance who worked so hard on the rule. I would also like to  
thank Blair Petrillo from our Office of the Chief Accountant, Simona Mola Yost 
and Anzhela Knyazeva from our Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, as well 
as Dorothy McCuaig and Daniel Morris from our General Counsel’s office.
Thank you for your hard work.

OTCQX RULES RELEASE NO. 9 (PROPOSED 
AMENDMENTS) June 9, 2015
OTC Markets Group has published proposed amendments to the OTCQX 
Rules for U.S. Companies, OTCQX Rules for International Companies, and 
OTCQX Rules for U.S. Banks. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s 
recent amendments to Regulation A become effective on June 19, 2015, and 
OTC Markets Group has aligned our rules to allow issuers to qualify for the 
OTCQX Best Marketplace.
Most significantly, a company may use its required disclosure under Regulation 
A to help meet the initial and ongoing OTCQX disclosure requirements. To 
qualify for OTCQX, a company using the new Regulation A Reporting Standard 
must file all reports required to be filed on EDGAR under Regulation A as 
well as quarterly disclosure and certain other information as outlined below. 
We have also made clarifying changes to the OTCQX Rules that are appli-
cable to all current and prospective OTCQX companies.

Appendix D | OTCQX/OTCQB Listing Requirements and  
On-Ramp Guides
248
Highlights of Proposed Changes
OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies:
1.	 Definitions for “Regulation A” and “Regulation A 
Reporting Company” were added to the Definitions 
section.
2.	 Initial Disclosure Obligations - A Regulation A Reporting 
Company must have filed all reports required to be 
filed on EDGAR. The most recent financial statements 
required to be audited under Regulation A must be 
audited by an independent public accountant registered 
with the PCAOB.
3.	 Ongoing Disclosure Obligations - A Regulation A 
Reporting Company must file, on an ongoing basis, all 
annual, semi-annual and other interim reports required 
to be filed on EDGAR under Regulation A, and within 
45 days of the end of each fiscal quarter must publish on 
EDGAR through Form 1-U quarterly disclosure includ-
ing all information required in the Company’s semiannual 
report. Each annual report must include financial state-
ments audited by an independent public accountant reg-
istered with the PCAOB.
4.	 For U.S. Premier Companies Only - A Regulation A 
Reporting Company must publish, on EDGAR through 
SEC Form 1-U, copies of all proxies, proxy statements 
and all other material mailed by the Company to its 
shareholders with respect thereto, within 15 days of the 
mailing of such material.
5.	 The initial bid price requirement was updated to indicate 
that the bid price test will also need to be met at the time 
of application approval in addition to the time of applica-
tion submission.
Solicitation of Comments on Proposed Rules:
OTC Markets Group requests your direct feedback relating to the proposed 
OTCQX Rules for U.S. Companies regarding the disclosure of proxy mate-

Understanding the scope or requirements of the task undertaken in deciding 
to file for qualification of Regulation A securities is hard to understand with-
out seeing examples. At http://www.apress.com/9781430257318 you’ll 
find two such examples. They are from the same issuer who has conducted 
both a Tier I and Tier II offering. By providing for the same issuer, we hope 
that you can focus on the procedural differences, without having to distinguish 
differences inherent to different issuers.

NASAA Coordinated Review of Regulation  
A Offerings Review Protocol
Adopted March 7, 2014
1.	 Applicants desiring coordinated multi-jurisdictional 
review of an offering to be conducted under Section 3(b) 
of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation A shall file 
a request for coordinated review, along with required 
exhibits and filing fees, through the Electronic Filing 
Depository. The State of Washington is the program 
coordinator. Applicants shall indicate in what jurisdic-
tions the offering is to be registered through coordi-
nated review. A listing of all jurisdictions that participate 
in coordinated review shall be maintained on NASAA’s 
website.
F

Appendix F | Blue Sky
254
If at the time of application, electronic filing is not available through the 
Electronic Filing Depository, then the applicant shall remit via e-mail an elec-
tronic copy of the application, along with required exhibits, to the program 
coordinator who shall redistribute the application materials to the jurisdic-
tions indicated on the application. Filing fees must be submitted to the indi-
vidual states in accordance with their filing procedures. A table of filing fees 
and remittance addresses for Regulation A offerings by jurisdiction shall be 
maintained on NASAA’s website.
2.	 Washington will contact all participating jurisdictions to 
identify both a lead merit examiner and a lead disclosure 
examiner. If the issuer has not applied in a jurisdiction 
that applies merit standards, only a lead disclosure exam-
iner will be identified. The lead examiner(s) will be iden-
tified within three (3) business days after receipt of the 
application for coordinated review.
3.	 The lead examiner(s) will draft and circulate a comment 
letter to the participating jurisdictions within ten (10) 
business days after their identification as lead examiner(s) 
by the program administrator. If the issuer has applied in 
a jurisdiction that applies merit standards, the lead merit 
examiner will include comments consistent with applica-
ble NASAA Statements of Policy. The lead merit examiner 
shall apply and draft comments based on the applicable 
statements of policy, with the following exceptions:
a.	 The Statement of Policy Regarding Promoters’ Equity 
Investment shall not apply;
b.	 The Statement of Policy Regarding Promotional 
Shares shall apply except that one-half (1/2) of any 
promotional shares required to be locked-in or 
escrowed shall be released on the first and second 
anniversary of the date of completion of the offer-
ing such that all shares shall have been released from 
lock-in or escrow by the second anniversary of the 
date of completion of the offering; and
c.	 The Statement of Policy Regarding Loans and Other 
Material Affiliated Transactions shall apply except that 
the disclosure document shall not be required to 
include representations by counsel to the issuer as 
contemplated in Section VII.C.3. of the policy.

Regulation A+
255
4.	 The participating jurisdictions shall have five (5) business 
days from the circulation of the draft comment letter 
by the lead examiners to submit additional comments 
or corrections to the lead examiners. If a jurisdiction 
does not submit comments to the lead examiners within  
five (5) business days, the lead examiners can assume the 
jurisdiction has no comments. After the expiration of  
the five (5) business days for review of the draft letter  
by the participating jurisdictions, the lead examiner(s) 
shall have three (3) business days to make any necessary 
revisions and send the initial comment letter to the issuer.
5.	 If the initial application is amended by adding more partic-
ipating jurisdictions, the initial ten (10) business day review 
period will be extended to five (5) business days from the 
date the final amendment is received. Amendments to 
the application for purposes of adding jurisdictions must 
be made prior to the expiration of the initial ten (10) 
business day review period. If an issuer seeks to add a 
jurisdiction after this time, the issuer may be required to 
pursue registration independently and be subject to non-
coordinated review standards in each of the additional 
jurisdictions.
6.	 The lead examiners will communicate with the applicant 
and participating jurisdictions, as necessary, to resolve any 
outstanding comments. The lead jurisdictions will reply 
to each issuer’s response to each coordinated review let-
ter no later than five (5) business days after receipt of the 
issuer’s response.
7.	 Participating jurisdictions will receive same-day notice 
from the lead disclosure examiner and the lead merit 
examiner when that lead examiner clears the application.
8.	 Once the lead disclosure examiner has cleared the appli-
cation, all participating disclosure jurisdictions agree to 
clear the application.
9.	 Once the lead merit examiner has cleared the applica-
tion, all participating merit jurisdictions agree to clear the 
application.

of the investment to recognize the investor’s 
share of the earnings or losses of the investee 
after the date of acquisition. (This generally

First Day Close
The closing price at the end of the first day of 
trading in a registered public offering or traded 
Regulation A offering. It reflects not only how 
well the lead manager priced and placed the 
deal, but what the near-term trading is likely 
to be. For example, IPOs that shoot up 100% 
or 200% on their first day of trading are likely 
to fall back in price on subsequent days due to 
profit taking. Conversely, IPOs that break offer 
price immediately are likely to drop further as 
institutions bail out. Breaking IPO price right 
out of the box is a poor reflection on the lead 
manager’s pricing and placement.
Float
The number of a company’s shares that are

laws. The duties of the PCAOB, as established 
by the Act, include establishing audit and 
independence standards; registering public 
accounting firms; inspecting public accounting 
firms; and conducting investigations and 
disciplinary proceedings. The PCAOB, 
subject to the oversight of the SEC, replaced 
the accounting profession’s self-regulating 
framework.
Registration
Procedure by which a company registers 
securities with the SEC pursuant to the 1933 
Act. Once registered, the company must also 
register as a reporting company under the 
1934 Act. Registration allows the securities 
to be listed on a national exchange and sold 
to anyone without limitations such as those 
under Regulation A. Registration, however, is 
expensive and subjects the issuing company to 
significant ongoing regulatory burdens. If listed 
on a national exchange, registered securities 
are exempt from Blue Sky laws. The process 
requires the issuing company to make filings 
with the SEC that contain a description of the 
company, its management, and its financials. 
The material is reviewed by the SEC for its 
completeness, amount of disclosure, and its 
presentation of accounting information before 
the SEC declares the registration effective, 
which allows it to be traded to the public.
Restricted Security
Securities that have been sold to investors 
pursuant to a private exemption, and other 
transactional exemptions, are “restricted” in 
their ability to be traded post investment. 
Typically must comply with requirements 
of Rule 144 of the SEC’s regulations. Most 
restricted securities have no market in any 
event because of these requirements and are, 
thus, very difficult to sell.

the company is. Underwriters use valuation 
multiples of an issuer’s peers, or comparables, 
to determine the appropriate level at which an 
offering should be priced.
Venture Capital
Source of money for start-up companies, 
typically raised by venture capital firms who 
invest in private companies that need capital to 
develop and market their products. In return for 
this investment, the venture capitalists generally 
receive significant ownership of the company 
and seats on the board.
Volatility
Characteristic of a security that rises or falls 
sharply in price within a short time.
Warrant
A security entitling its owner to purchase shares 
in a company under specified terms.
