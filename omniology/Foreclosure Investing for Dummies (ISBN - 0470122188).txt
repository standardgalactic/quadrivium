About the Authors
Ralph R. Roberts’ success in real estate sales is legendary. He has been 
profiled by the Associated Press, CNN, and Time magazine, and has done 
hundreds of radio interviews. Ralph is a seasoned professional in all areas of
house flipping, including buying homes, rehabbing, and reselling them quickly
and at a handsome profit. He has penned several successful titles, including
Flipping Houses For Dummies (Wiley), Sell It Yourself: Sell Your Home Faster and
for More Money Without Using a Broker (Adams Media Corporation), Walk Like
a Giant, Sell Like a Madman: America’s #1 Salesman Shows You How To Sell
Anything (Collins), 52 Weeks of Sales Success: America’s #1 Salesman Shows You
How To Close Every Deal! (Collins), REAL WEALTH by Investing in REAL ESTATE
(Prentice Hall), and Protect Yourself Against Real Estate and Mortgage Fraud
(Kaplan). 
Foreclosure investing is one of Ralph’s many specialties. For over 25 years, he
has personally worked in the foreclosure arena, purchasing preforeclosures
directly from homeowners, buying foreclosure properties at auction, and
often helping homeowners dodge the foreclosure bullet and retain posses-
sion of their homes. In Foreclosure Investing For Dummies, Ralph reveals his
unique win-win approach to investing in foreclosures.

Joe Kraynak is a freelance author who has written and co-authored dozens
of books on topics ranging from slam poetry to computer basics. Joe teamed
up with Dr. Candida Fink to write his first book in the For Dummies series,
Bipolar Disorder For Dummies, where he showcased his talent for translating
the complexities of a topic into plain-spoken practical advice. He then
teamed up with Ralph to write the ultimate guide to flipping houses —
Flipping Houses For Dummies. In Foreclosure Investing For Dummies, Joe and
Ralph join forces once again to deliver the definitive guide to profitably
investing in foreclosures . . . without selling your soul. 


Dedication
From Ralph: To the many investors and Realtors I’ve worked with, trained,
consulted, and coached who have made investing in foreclosures both suc-
cessful and rewarding.
From Joe: To the investors who use our book not only to build wealth in 
real estate, but also to assist distressed homeowners and build stronger 
communities.
Special thanks to Paul Doroh, sheriff-sale and cash buyer for Ralph Roberts
Realty, whose priceless insights and real-world experiences transformed 
our silver into pure platinum. Paul is a mighty fine writer, even by Joe’s 
standards, and without his late inning relief, this book would not have been
possible.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Although we wrote the book, dozens of other talented individuals con-
tributed to its conception, development, and perfection. Special thanks go to
acquisitions editor Lindsay Lefevere, who chose us to author this book and
guided us through the tough part of getting started. Jennifer Connolly, our
project editor, deserves a loud cheer for acting as a very patient collaborator
and gifted editor — shuffling chapters back and forth, shepherding the text
and photos through production, making sure any technical issues were prop-
erly resolved, and serving as unofficial quality control manager. We also tip
our hats to the production crew for doing such an outstanding job of trans-
forming a loose collection of text and illustrations into such an attractive
bound book.
Throughout the writing of this book, we relied heavily on a knowledgeable
and dedicated support staff, who provided expert advice, tips, and research,
so we could deliver the most comprehensive and useful information. Lois
Maljak proved invaluable not only as a resource person but also as the com-
munications hub for the flurry of files and e-mail messages flying back and
forth on a daily basis. Thanks also to Ralph’s number-one virtual assistant
Kandra Hamric, who helped us tie up all the loose ends and put the appendix
together.
We owe special thanks to our technical editor, accomplished real estate pro
Blanche Evans, for ferreting out technical errors in the manuscript, helping
guide its content, and offering her own tips and tricks.

Introduction
T
o the average homeowner, people who buy and sell foreclosures are greedy
opportunists at best and scum of the earth at their very worst. Foreclosure
investors prey on unfortunate homeowners — families who, through no fault of
their own, can’t afford to make their next house payment. Investors swoop in,
scoop up properties for pennies on the dollar, and then turn around and sell
those properties for huge profits, laughing all the way to the bank.
That’s the stereotype of foreclosure investors, and many “investors” certainly
fit that stereotype, but real investors, the ones who operate with integrity,
compassion, and a sense of fairness, the ones who are most successful as
long-term investors, don’t play that game. They know that homeowners are
not facing foreclosure because they enjoy being hassled by bill collectors and
threatened with eviction. Distressed homeowners have reached this point
due to some financial setback or oversight, a job loss or layoff, health issues
or the death of a family member, human foibles, or a host of other causes
that happen to be a natural part of life. Most of these homeowners are so
humiliated that they won’t even ask loved ones for help.
Sure, foreclosure investors want to make a profit. Unless they were self-
less philanthropists, they wouldn’t even consider investing their time and
money without having some profit motive to do so. Investors with integrity,
however, strive toward developing solutions that are fair and less painful 
for all parties involved. Some investors are actually in the game to improve
their communities — some are churches reinvesting in their neighborhood.
Without these investors, homeowners would have fewer options, actually
only two options — come up with the cash or be forcefully evicted. Many
would be forced out of their homes with nothing to show for it. Lenders
would have to play hardball. Governments would face the increased burden
of picking up the pieces.
I don’t want you to become a stereotypical foreclosure investor. I want you to
join the ranks of successful, fair-minded investors who present homeowners
with a menu of options from which to choose and offer to purchase their
home at a reasonable price that earns you a reasonable profit. I want you to
assist distressed homeowners in assessing their options, choosing the option
that’s in their best interest, and then taking the necessary steps to put an
unfortunate incident behind them and move on with their lives.
Following the advice I offer in this book won’t guarantee a profit on every
investment opportunity that comes your way. You’ll encounter many home-
owners who shun your advice. You’ll miss a few golden opportunities to
score some quick cash. You may even lose opportunities to less ethical

investors who offer the homeowners empty promises. You’ll soon discover,
however, that by treating distressed homeowners with compassion and a
sense of fairness, you have more opportunities than you have time and
resources to pursue. Through your hard work and integrity, you will achieve
a higher level of personal and financial success than the less ethical investors
in your neighborhood who are simply conforming to the age-old stereotype.
About This Book
This book is no quick-cash, no-risk, no-work guide to building wealth through
foreclosure investing. People who want that sort of thing can stay up late at
night and listen to the real estate investment gurus peddle their products, 
or they can attend any of the readily available “free” foreclosure investment
seminars that make their rounds.
This book guides you in the methods of making money the old-fashioned way —
earning it fairly. I’ve been investing in foreclosures and assisting distressed
homeowners for more than 30 years. I have achieved great success and have
experienced my fair share of failures. I’ve had homeowners provide glowing 
testimonials of how much I’ve helped them, I’ve been accused of trying to steal
homes from “little old ladies,” and I’ve assisted homeowners when con artists
have actually tried to steal their homes. Sad to say, I have even lost property in
foreclosure myself.
In Foreclosure Investing For Dummies, I show you how to invest in foreclosures
the right way. I steer you clear of the many pitfalls inherent in foreclosure
investing. I show you how to properly and thoroughly research properties, so
you know what you’re getting into before you buy or bid on a property. I step
you through the process of finding the best opportunities with the maximum
potential profit and lowest risk. I lead you through the process of buying fore-
closures prior to auction, bidding for them at auction, and purchasing them
after the auction from the lenders that have foreclosed on them. I present 
various ways to cash out and realize your profit after the sale. And I show 
you how to do it without misleading and cheating distressed homeowners.
Conventions Used in This Book
Compared to other foreclosure investing programs and books, Foreclosure
Investing For Dummies is anything but conventional, but I do use some con-
ventions to call your attention to certain items. For example:
2
Foreclosure Investing For Dummies 

 Italics highlight new, somewhat technical terms, such as redemption
period, and emphasize words when I’m driving home a point.
 Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted and numbered lists.
 Monofont highlights Web addresses.
In addition, even though you see two author names on the cover of this book —
Ralph and Joe — you see “I” throughout the book when I, Ralph, am describing
my personal experiences with foreclosure investing and offering my expert
advice. Joe’s the wordsmith — the guy responsible for keeping you engaged and
entertained and making sure I’ve explained everything as clearly and thoroughly
as possible.
What You’re Not to Read
Although I encourage you to read this book from cover to cover to maximize
the return on your investment, Foreclosure Investing For Dummies facilitates a
skip and dip approach. It presents the information in easily digestible chunks,
so you can skip to the chapter or section that grabs your attention or meets
your current needs, master it, and then skip to another section or simply set
the book aside for later reference.
I do, however, consider Chapter 8 required reading. All too often, investors fail
to properly research a property, and they really get burned. Chapter 8 shows
you how to collect key information about a property, so you know what you’re
buying before you invest tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in it.
If you read my book Flipping Houses For Dummies (Wiley), you can safely 
skip Chapter 17 because Flipping Houses For Dummies covers the process of
repairing, renovating, and preparing a home for sale in much greater detail
and even includes plenty of before and after photos.
You can also safely skip anything you see in a gray shaded box. I stuck it in a
box for the same reason that most people stick stuff in boxes — to get it out
of the way, so you wouldn’t trip over it. However, you may find the stories
and brief asides uproariously funny and perhaps even mildly informative
(or vice versa).
Foolish Assumptions
In some books that cover advanced topics, authors must assume that their
readers already understand some basic topics or have acquired beginning-
level skills. For example, if this were a book about molecular biology, you’d
have to know what a molecule was.
3
Introduction

The biggest foolish assumption I make in this book is that you own the home
you live in. You’ve been involved in at least one closing and signed the docu-
ments that the closing agent passed around. When you own a home, you
instantly become a real estate investor. You begin to grasp the value of real
estate as an investment. You gain first-hand knowledge of the benefits of
owning a home, understand the challenges of maintaining it, and take on the
responsibility of making mortgage payments. You can empathize with home-
owners who are about to lose their homes in foreclosure.
If you’re not a homeowner, sell this book and put the proceeds toward a
down payment on a house. If you live in the Detroit metropolitan area, gimme
a call, and I’ll find the perfect house for you and your family. I’ll even give you
credit on the purchase of the book, or stop by the office, and I will personally
sign your copy. Once you’ve purchased a house and have lived in it for a few
months, pick up the book. I’ll be waiting for you.
Other foolish assumptions I make include but are not limited to the following:
 You’re committed to success. Investing in foreclosures is hard work and
requires sticktoitism (pronounced stik-to-it-izm) — a word I’ve been using
since the 1970s to describe the determination and dogged perseverance
required to build wealth in real estate. I could use “stick-to-itiveness,”
which happens to appear in the dictionary, but I like my word better.
 You can talk to people. You don’t need to be a social butterfly (although
that helps), but you do need to be able to network, ask questions, and
haggle with people. If you don’t have some basic people skills, you
should team up with someone who does. Effective word-of-mouth net-
working leads to the best opportunities, and in almost every situation
you’ll need to talk with homeowners, county clerks, sheriffs, lenders,
and a host of others involved in the foreclosure process.
 You’re dedicated to developing mutually beneficial solutions. I hate to
see “investors” ripping off homeowners, and I would really hate to see
anyone use the information in this book to take advantage of distressed
homeowners. You can make plenty of money investing in foreclosures by
acting with integrity and presenting reasonable solutions that meet the
needs of all parties involved. 
 You can treat foreclosure investing as business. Understand that you
are not the cause of the homeowners’ distress. More than likely, you
cant’ solve their problems. Very likely, many others have tried to help
the homeowners solve the root cause of the problem (and failed) before
you came along. What you can offer is truth and useful information. You
must be empathetic without jumping in to save a drowning family that
may drag you under both financially and emotionally.

Foreclosure Investing For Dummies 

A problem is something that money can’t fix, such as an untreatable illness 
or a death in the family. Most families, if they choose to, can move on after
experiencing a financial calamity. Foreclosure is not the end of the world,
although, at the time, they may perceive it to be.
How This Book Is Organized
I wrote this book so you could approach it in either of two ways. You can pick
up the book and flip to any chapter for a quick, stand-alone mini-course on a
specific foreclosure-investing topic, or you can read the book from cover to
cover. To help you navigate, I took the 22 chapters that make up the book and
divvied them up into six parts plus an appendix. Here, I provide a quick
overview of what I cover in each part and in the appendix.
Part I: Prepping Yourself 
for Foreclosure Success
Before you can successfully invest in foreclosures, you have to wrap your
brain around the foreclosure process, be able to identify where the opportu-
nities lie, and understand the risks. In this part, I bring you up to speed in a
hurry on the foreclosure process, assist you in picking your point of entry,
and offer tips on how to avoid the most common pitfalls.
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for
Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk
Some people invest more time and energy planning for a two-week vacation
than they spend planning for a foreclosure investment. By skipping the
preparation steps, they almost guarantee failure. In this part, I show you how
to obtain the information, tools, support, and resources you need to improve
your chances of success. You find out how to assemble a team of talented
professionals and other key players qualified to deal with issues that you
may not be prepared to handle. You discover sources of investment capital
you may not have considered. And you pick up a few networking strategies
that can lead you to the best deals before other investors pick up the scent.
5
Introduction

Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations 
in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction)
Some of the best foreclosure investment opportunities are available in 
pre-foreclosure — purchasing a home directly from the homeowners prior 
to auction. Competition from other investors is generally less fierce at this
point, and the homeowners have more options. In this part, I show you how
to locate properties prior to foreclosure, gather information about those
properties and their owners, and assist homeowners through the foreclosure
process while acquiring properties below market value.
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure
and Bankruptcy Properties
Many investors prefer not to deal directly with distressed homeowners in
pre-foreclosure. They’d rather purchase the property at auction and then
work on their end game. In this part, I show you how to find and buy proper-
ties at auction, from banks and other lending institutions that repossess
properties, from trustees during bankruptcy, and from various government
agencies and government-sponsored programs.
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . 
after the Sale
You make your money when you buy a property — by purchasing it below
market value — but you realize that profit when you sell, lease, or refinance
the property. In this part, I reveal various ways to cash out on your invest-
ment. I offer strategies for encouraging the previous homeowners to vacate
the premises voluntarily, and I show you how to initiate eviction, if the home-
owners refuse to leave. You discover how to maximize your profit by repair-
ing, renovating, and either selling or leasing the property, and you pick up
tips on various other strategies for profiting from your investment.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is the highlight of every For Dummies title, offering quick
strategies, tips, and insights on whatever subject the book covers. The chap-
ters in this Part of Tens show you how to avoid the ten most common begin-
ning blunders and offer ten ways to assist homeowners in navigating the
foreclosure process in a way that convinces the homeowners to work with
you rather than with some other investor.

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I’ve sprinkled icons in the margins to cue you in on dif-
ferent types of information that call out for your attention. Here are the icons
you’ll see and a brief description of each.
I want you to remember everything you read in this book, but if you can’t
quite do that, then remember the important points I flag with this icon.
Tips provide insider insight from behind the scenes. When you’re looking 
for a better, faster, cheaper way to do something, check out these tips.
“Whoa!” This icon appears when you need to be extra vigilant or seek 
professional help before moving forward.
Where to Go from Here
Foreclosure Investing For Dummies is constructed in a way that’s similar to the
foreclosure process itself. It presents you with opportunities and with infor-
mation to capitalize on those opportunities in three key entry points in the
foreclosure process: pre-foreclosure, foreclosure, and post-foreclosure.
For a quick course on foreclosure investing, check out Chapter 1, which pro-
vides an overview of the foreclosure process along with some tidbits on how
to profit from the various stages of the process. Skip to Chapter 3, where I
guide you in selecting your preferred entry point. The chapters in Part II are
indispensable in preparing you for a successful investment venture. If you
choose to invest in pre-foreclosures, skip to Part III, were you discover how
to research properties and deal directly with homeowners. (Part III also con-
tains a chapter — Chapter 8 — that’s essential for all foreclosure investors —
properly researching a property.) If you’re interested in purchasing proper-
ties at auction or after they’ve been repossessed, Part IV provides all the
information you need to know. And when you’re ready to cash out on your
investment, skip to Part IV.
In a few chapters I include fill-in-the-blank forms and worksheets you can
scribble on. Although you can fill out these forms and worksheets in the
book, you may want to make copies to write on. These forms and worksheets
are indispensable in gathering research data, evaluating properties, and 
presenting options to homeowners facing foreclosure.

In this part . . .
A
chieving financial success by investing in foreclo-
sures requires a good deal of preparation. You need
to understand the foreclosure process in your area, pick a
stage in the foreclosure process as your area of expertise,
and become well aware of the pitfalls to avoid. Only with
the proper preparation can you minimize your risk and
maximize your potential profit.
The chapters in this part bring you up to speed on the
foreclosure process, assist you in picking a point of entry
you want to focus on, and steer you clear of some of the
major and common pitfalls that trap novice foreclosure
investors.

Chapter 1

Foreclosure Investing
In This Chapter
 Taking a bird’s-eye view of the foreclosure process

 Gathering critical data about properties and their owners
 Buying and taking possession of a foreclosure property
 Realizing your profit at the end
W
henever you’re developing a new skill, having an overview of the
process provides you with a context for understanding. In the case of
investing in foreclosures, a general knowledge of the foreclosure process and
the rules and regulations that govern it can reveal opportunities for purchas-
ing properties below market value. 
Understanding the necessity of having a strong investment team in place
enables you to begin thinking about the people who would be best qualified
to assist you. And realizing the benefits of thorough research can prevent you
from buying a property that’s destined to send you to the poorhouse.
In this chapter, I provide an overview of the foreclosure process, stress the
necessity of building a competent investment team, introduce you to essen-
tial property research techniques and resources, briefly explain the process
of buying and taking possession of properties, and touch on various options
you have to cash out your profit once you own the property. In a nutshell, I
give you the basic structure for investing in foreclosed properties, and as
soon as you begin buying foreclosure properties, you can start plugging in
the details — attention to detail is the key to success.

Investigating the Foreclosure Process
from Start to Finish 
A common misconception of foreclosure is that after the homeowners miss a
payment or two, the lender immediately takes possession of the property and
then turns around and auctions it off at a foreclosure sale. Actually, the
process is more drawn out than that, following this typical scenario:
 Homeowners stop making mortgage payments.
 After about 15 to 30 days, lender sends a payment reminder.
 If the homeowners still don’t respond, the lender continues to send
notices and call the homeowners.
 If the homeowners still don’t contact the lender, the lender turns the
matter over to its collection and harassment department, who continues
to pester the homeowners with letters and phone calls.
 After about three missed monthly payments, the lender transfers the
matter over to outside counsel, which is normally handled regionally.
The attorney sends an official notice, warning that foreclosure proceed-
ings are about to begin. 
 Homeowners don’t reply or present a solution that the lender deems
unsatisfactory. At this point, the homeowners can usually stop the 
foreclosure by negotiating a suitable solution with the lender.
 The attorney begins the foreclosure process by posting a foreclosure
notice in the county’s legal newspaper or in the local newspaper. The
homeowners can still reinstate the mortgage at this point by catching 
up on the payments and paying any additional late fees and penalties,
which occurs quite often. See Chapter 9 for details on how to track 
foreclosure notices. (The county legal newspaper serves the public and
provides the legal community with an automated system, but these are
private, for-profit publications, not freebies that the county publishes.)
 The property arrives at the civil division of the sheriff’s office, which is
assigned the task of handling the sale. The trustee or attorney handling
the foreclosure sets the opening bid and typically advertises it in the
foreclosure notice. The opening bid is the balance of the mortgage plus
penalties, unpaid interest, attorney fees, and other costs that the lender
has incurred during the process.
 The sheriff or his representative may visit the house prior to the sale to
post a foreclosure notice and inspect the property, because sometimes
redemption rights change if the homeowners abandon the property.
(Some states have a redemption period, after the sale, during which time
the homeowners can buy back the property by paying the full amount of
the loan along with taxes, interest, and penalties. This period can last up
to a year.)
12
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

 The day before the auction, the lender may adjust the price up or down,
but may not artificially inflate it. Frequently, lenders reduce the opening
bid to make the property more appealing to investors and rid themselves
of it.
 Property goes on the auction block for sale to the highest bidder or is
turned over to a trustee to liquidate the property and pay the lender.
 An investor purchases the property at auction or from the trustee, or
the lender buys the property. If nobody bids higher than the opening
bid, which the foreclosing lender submits, control is handed over to 
the lender, who can then take possession of the property following any
redemption period as explained next. 
 In some states, the high bidder (or lender, if nobody bids more than the
opening bid) takes immediate possession of the property. In states with
a redemption period, the new “owner” must wait until the redemption
period expires and a final court hearing with the homeowners before
they can do anything with the property. If the lender takes possession 
of the property, the lender transfers the property to its REO (Real Estate
Owned) department, which prepares it for sale. 
 Previous owners move out or are evicted.
The foreclosure process is a lose-lose situation for both the homeowners and
the lender. The homeowners lose the property, and the lender takes a loss on
the loan and often pays additional costs to resell the property to recoup a
portion of its loss.
If you or a loved one is ever facing a foreclosure, contact the lender immedi-
ately to explore your options. Seek help sooner rather than later. Shame, anger,
and denial may discourage you from seeking assistance, but the longer you
wait, the fewer your options. Educate yourself and communicate with your
lender. Homeowners who panic become very vulnerable to foreclosure rescue
schemes. Do your research, know your options, and don’t deal with someone
who’s claiming to be your friend. A good place to seek help is Freddie Mac’s
Don’t Borrow Trouble Web site at www.dontborrowtrouble.com.
For more in-depth coverage of the foreclosure process, including variations
in different areas of the country, skip to Chapter 2.
Picking Your Point of Entry
As a real estate investor, you can step in at any stage of the foreclosure
process to acquire properties and enact other profitable transactions:
13
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Foreclosure Investing

 Pre-sale: Before the property is auctioned or transferred to the trustee.
 Sale (or auction): When the sheriff or the court auctions the property or
after control of the property is placed in the hands of the trustee.
 Post-sale: After the lender repossesses the property, you can purchase
the property from the lender or from its REO broker.
In the following sections, I describe these three entry points. For more advice
on how to select an entry point that’s right for you, refer to Chapter 3.
Begin tracking properties early in the process, even if you choose to buy
properties later in the process. By tracking properties early, you pick up on
the history of what’s going on and develop a clearer idea of how much to pay
for the property.
Scooping other investors during 
the pre-auction stage
As soon as homeowners realize that they can’t make their payments, you can
mediate between the homeowners and their lenders to work out a mutually
acceptable solution. In a few cases, you can help the homeowners keep the
property; for example, by negotiating a forbearance with the lender that pro-
vides the homeowners extra time to catch up on their payments. 
Did I just say “help the homeowners keep the property?” Yes, your long-
term best interest is best served by doing what’s best for the homeowners.
Sometimes that means you receive no profit from your efforts. In a huge 
percentage of cases, however, the homeowners’ best option is to sell the
property and find more affordable housing arrangements. By being sincerely
concerned with their best interests, you place yourself in a position to
acquire the property if the homeowners can’t or won’t take the action 
necessary to keep it.
Your goal during the pre-foreclosure stage is to present the distressed home-
owners with all of options and enable them to make well-informed decisions.
See Chapter 9 for a complete list of options.
Stepping into the foreclosure process during the pre-auction stage provides
you with some of the best opportunities to assist the homeowners and pur-
chase a property at an attractive price. In Part III, I show you exactly how to
research and buy homes before homeowners lose them in foreclosure.
14
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

Bidding on properties at foreclosure auctions
Some investors prefer to step into the process at the auction stage, because
they’re uncomfortable dealing with distressed homeowners who are often in
a state of denial and unwilling to sit down with an investor to discuss their
options. At the auction stage, you buy the property in a less emotional atmos-
phere. In most cases, however, you still have to deal with the homeowners
when the time comes to take possession of the property.
Now, don’t run out and start scooping up properties at foreclosure auctions
just yet. Uninformed investors often get burned by diving before they learn to
dog paddle. Foreclosure auctions are packed with peril, often trapping novice
investors into making costly mistakes, such as these:
 Buying a property without researching the title. A title history reveals
who really owns the property and the amount currently owed on the
property, and the priority of the mortgages — tax lien (top priority), first
mortgage (next in line), second mortgage, and so on. Do your research,
as explained in “Doing a Little Detective Work,” later in this chapter and
in Chapter 8.
 Buying a junior lien thinking it’s a senior lien. When you buy “properties”
at a foreclosure sale, you’re really buying mortgages. The first mortgage on
a property is called the senior lien, which gives the buyer the most control
over the property. Additional claims against the property are called junior
liens, which often get wiped out during foreclosure. Buy a junior lien by
mistake, and you may have just bought yourself a worthless piece of paper.
Only a thorough research of the title, as explained in Chapter 8, can steer
you clear of making this common and potentially very costly mistake.
 Buying a property without inspecting it. A house may look valuable on
paper, but until you see it with your own eyes, you don’t know for sure.
The house may have significant fire damage, toxic materials, foundation
problems, or a host of other defects. Check out Chapter 8 for details.
 Paying more for a property than what it’s worth. In the heat of an auc-
tion, your enthusiasm to outbid fellow bidders often leads novice
investors into paying more for a property than what it’s worth. This
almost guarantees that you’ll end up taking a loss on the property.
 Failing to account for the redemption period. Most states have a
mandatory redemption period, during which time the homeowners
retain possession of the property and can redeem the title by paying off
the mortgage in full along with any penalties and back taxes. You need to
have enough cash reserves on hand to pay the property taxes on the
property and to insure the property during this time. If you don’t pay
the property taxes, another investor may be able to purchase a tax lien
or deed at a tax sale and take control of the property — tax liens have
priority. You also need to insure the property, because you’re not cov-
ered by the homeowner’s insurance policy (if they have one).

Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Foreclosure Investing

Never bid on a property at auction until you’ve done your homework.
Reading this book from cover to cover is a start. Brush up on the foreclosure
rules and regulations in your area, and always research a property thor-
oughly before bidding — research the title and inspect the house as closely
as possible with your own two eyes, as shown in Chapter 8.
Buying properties after the sale
Working with homeowners prior to auction and waging bidding battles
against other investors during an auction may not appeal to you, but you 
can still profit from investing in foreclosures after the foreclosure sale.
If nobody at the auction offers the minimum acceptable bid, the lender buys
back the mortgage. If the state has a mandatory redemption period, the lender
waits until the period expires and then passes the property to its REO (Real
Estate Owned) department (sometimes referred to as the OREO or Other
Real Estate Owned department, not to be confused with the cookie), which pre-
pares the property for resale and typically hires a mortgage broker to place it
back on the market. By dealing with a lender’s REO department or its mortgage
broker, you may be able to purchase the property at a price that’s discounted
far enough below market value to turn a profit of 20 percent or more.
The chapters in Part IV show you how to find and buy REO properties and
other properties that government institutions and law enforcement agencies
take possession of and then often sell at deep discounts:

Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 
Don’t forget the insurance
As soon as you buy a foreclosure, even if you
can’t take possession of it right away, call your
insurance agent and buy a homeowner’s insur-
ance policy for the property.
I purchased a house for $75,000 that was worth
$150,000. By the time I took possession of the
property, the previous owner had taken the car-
peting, the entire kitchen including the kitchen
sink, the bathroom fixtures, the furnace the cen-
tral air conditioning unit, the doors, and anything
else they could carry out hoping to cause harm
to the next owner. I turned it into my insurance
carrier, received $25,000, and sold the house for
$100,000 to another investor. After expenses and
holding costs, I walked away with about $35,000. 
The investor who bought the property decided
to rent it out instead of selling right away. He
refinanced to pull about $50,000 equity out of the
property, used the equity to cover repair and
renovation costs, and still had a little money left
over. He then rented out the property to cover
his mortgage payments.

 Properties seized due to nonpayment of taxes
 Properties seized by customs and law enforcement agencies because 
the properties were paid for with profits from illicit activities
 HUD (Housing and Urban Development) and VA (Veterans
Administration) houses that were repossessed when homeowners
defaulted on HUD or VA loans
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac properties that were repossessed and 
then turned over to these government-sponsored loan programs
 Bankruptcy properties that are being liquidated to pay off loans
 Properties that the Department of Transportation purchased for 
road improvements and then must dispose of after completing the
improvements
When buying a property from the government or a bank, don’t assume that
you’re getting a good deal. Homes are typically sold in their “as is” condition.
You must still research the title carefully and inspect the property with your
own two eyes. If you see ads or late-night infomercials selling lists of bank-
owned properties, don’t fall for the hype — these lists are usually outdated
long before they arrive in your mailbox.
Assembling a Team of 
Experts and Advisors
Flying solo on foreclosures may seem like a good idea. After all, if you get
other people involved, they may become rivals and pick up on your carefully
guarded secrets. Flying solo, however, is a good way to go bust or at least
limit your potential profit. Developing synergistic relationships with top per-
forming specialists has been a key to my success and the success of almost
all of the top real estate investors around the world.
In addition to providing expert guidance and advice for seizing opportunities
and avoiding common pitfalls, experts deliver leads to potentially profitable
properties, affordable financing, and quality contractors. They can assist you
in managing your finances and in renovating and selling your property for 
top dollar after you purchase it. And, by delegating some of the workload to
others who are better equipped to handle it, you free up time and resources
for finding the most profitable opportunities.
17
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Foreclosure Investing

In Chapter 4, I show you how to assemble a solid foreclosure investment
team consisting of the following members:
 Real estate agent
 Real estate attorney
 Mortgage broker
 Accountant
 Title company
 Home inspector
 Contractors
In Chapter 5, I lead you to sources of financial capital to fuel your invest-
ments, and in Chapter 6, I lead you through the process of developing a
strong support network that virtually ensures that you’ll never run out of
leads to profitable foreclosure properties. 
With a solid team in place, you take on the role of manager and major 
decision maker and can create an efficient system that minimizes risk 
while maximizing profit.
Getting Your Financial Ducks in a Row
In real estate, cash is king. In foreclosure investing, cash is the grand, 
high-exalted mystic ruler. Investment capital enables you to step in at 
any stage of the foreclosure process and buy out anyone who has a claim 
on or an interest in the property. 
18
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 
Stand by your man — or woman
Tell your spouse or significant other about your
plans to invest in foreclosure properties and ask
for help. If your spouse is a couch potato and
would prefer to remain anchored to a lounge
chair over helping you work nights and week-
ends, then you’re likely to find yourself swim-
ming upstream — right into a concrete dam.
Your better half needs to know that you’re plan-
ning on earning tens of thousands of dollars per
deal, and since he is surely going to want to
spend some of that money with you, he’d better
dig his potato out of that chair and help.
I strongly recommend against any attempts to
invest in foreclosures without the full consent
and eager assistance of your spouse. I would
hate to hear that after reading this book, you
and your better half stopped calling each other
“honey” and “sweetie pie” and started calling
each other “plaintiff” and “defendant.”

When I say “cash,” I’m not just talking about the money you have stuffed in
your mattress. I’m talking about borrowing certified funds from a bank or
other lending institution. See Chapter 5 for details.
Cash gives you the upper hand with the four Cs:
 Credibility: With cash, you have instant credibility that you can deliver
on your promises without hesitation. In most cases, homeowners need
cash to escape their current financial crisis. Lenders need cash to cut
their losses. With cash on hand, you can give homeowners and lenders
enough to achieve their goals, while you take possession of a profitable
property.
 Confidence: Cash provides you with the confidence you need to pitch
offers to both homeowners and lien holders, knowing that you can
deliver in a timely manner.
 Creativity: Putting together a foreclosure deal that satisfies all parties
often requires a great deal of creativity. With sufficient capital, you 
liberate your imagination from financial limitations.
 Competitiveness: Multiple real estate investors often compete for the
same property. Cash gives you a competitive edge, because it enables
you to execute a deal much more quickly. Both homeowners and lenders
are eager to put the current crisis behind them. An ability to act quickly
often separates the successful investor from the wannabes. 
The question of “Where am I going to get the money?” often derails the
novice investor before the train leaves the station, but many of the most 
successful investors started out with only a few bucks in their pockets,
including yours truly.
Don’t let a lack of investment capital discourage you. In Chapter 5, I show you
how to estimate just how much money you need to get started, and then I
steer you toward sources of capital to fuel your foreclosure investments. At
first, the cost of investment capital may chip away at your profits, but as you
develop a stronger financial position, the cost of money gradually decreases.
Doing a Little Detective Work
When you decide to invest in foreclosure properties, you take on the role of
private detective. To protect yourself from the many inherent risks of foreclo-
sure investing, dig up the essential facts and figures, so you know what you’re
buying, what it’s worth, and your options for purchasing the property for less
to maximize your profit.
19
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Foreclosure Investing

Thorough research requires that you dig up the following essential information:
 Names of the homeowners
 Amount owed on the property
 Lien-holder names and contact information
 Physical condition of the property
 Homeowners’ current situation and motivations
 Market value of the property
The following sections introduce you to the types of research to perform as
part of your due diligence, but proper research requires much more than I
can cover in this short chapter. For additional details, see Chapters 8 and 9.
Finding foreclosures and seized properties
The first step in foreclosure investing is often the most difficult for first-time
investors — finding potentially profitable properties. Plenty of foreclosures
and seized properties are available, but where do you look for them? The
answer to that question varies depending on where in the foreclosure
process you choose to focus on, but here’s a list of where you can expect 
to obtain the most valuable leads:
 The neighborhood grapevine, including neighbors, churches, local cafes,
clubs, and even people contacting you directly for assistance when they
know that you buy distressed properties
 Foreclosure notices in local papers or legal publications
 Bankruptcy notices in local papers or legal publications
 Divorce filings and decrees in publicly accessible court documents
 Web sites that list foreclosure and government-seized properties
 Real estate agents
 Attorneys, particularly bankruptcy, divorce, and probate attorneys
 Lenders
Online foreclosure information services range from excellent to total rip-offs.
Some services deliver timely information, while others deliver out-of-date
information that’s totally useless. In the beginning, you should do your own
footwork.
20
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

Word-of-mouth leads are often the best leads. Make sure everyone you know
and meet knows that you purchase distressed properties and work with
people who are facing foreclosure. Some investors have so many distressed
homeowners contacting them for assistance in foreclosure that they don’t
even have to look for properties. See Chapter 6 for networking tips.
Investigating the property’s title 
and other documentation
Before you commit to purchasing a property, you have to know who really
owns it, how much the current owners owe on it, to whom they owe the
money, how much they owe (if anything) in back taxes, and whether the
property has any encumbrances (liens, judgments, or zoning restrictions) 
on it. In short, you need to know what you’re getting yourself into before 
you get yourself into it.
Fortunately, most of the critical documentation about a property is accessible
to the general public and the title company you use:
 Title: The title shows the names of the property owners and lien holders
and any legal judgments on the property. I once purchased a property
from a mother and daughter, only to discover later that the daughter I
bought the property from wasn’t the daughter who owned it. The right
daughter eventually took possession of the property, and I was left with
some nasty, time-consuming legal battles. By checking the title, you can
avoid similar mistakes.
 Title history: A title company can provide you with a title history that
shows the change of ownership over the years. In some cases, this his-
tory reveals gaps in the transfer of the property from one homeowner to
the next. A gap in the history may be a warning that someone else can
lay claim to the property later and take you to court. 
 Property history: Your town or city keeps a history of every property,
which includes all building permits issued on the property. If the prop-
erty has an additional structure that was built without a permit, it may
not have been built to code. Any information you can gather about the
history of the property can assist you later in evaluating its market value.
Never purchase a property without fully researching its title and any other
public documents recorded on that property. In Chapter 8, I guide you
through the process of researching a property and assembling a detailed
dossier, which is essential for making sound investment decisions.
21
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Foreclosure Investing

Inspecting the property with your own eyes
Tattoo the following message on your forehead: my eyes or no buys. You can
look at the title work and other property documents until your eyes cross, but
you don’t know the condition of the property unless you see it for yourself:
 Visit the property and the neighborhood it’s in. Never try to assess 
the value of a property in a vacuum. The condition of the neighborhood
affects the sale price.
 Walk around the property and inspect it from all four sides. The front
of the house can look like the Taj Mahal, while the back or sides look
more like a bombed out bunker.
 If possible, get inside to take a look around. You don’t want to get
picked up for voyeurism or run off by an angry homeowner, but if the
homeowner invites you in, accept the invitation. See Chapter 8 for addi-
tional suggestions on doing drive-by and walk-around inspections.
If the house is currently listed with a broker, make an appointment to view
the house. This is an excellent way to get the inside scoop without being
accused of being a peeping Tom! You don’t have to tell the broker what you
know about the property or why you’re interested in it.
See Chapter 8 for more tips on inspecting the property with your own two eyes.
This cursory inspection offers you only a glimpse of the property, and in fore-
closure investing, sometimes that’s all you get, especially if you’re purchasing
the property at an auction. When buying a property prior to auction directly
from the homeowners, make your offer conditional upon a satisfactory inspec-
tion, and then have the property professionally inspected before closing to
uncover any costly defects and provide a ballpark estimate of the cost of repairs
and renovations needed to bring the property up to market value. If the prop-
erty requires repairs, try to negotiate a price reduction, instead of canceling the
deal; for example, if the repair costs $2,500 try to get a reduction of $3,500.
Guesstimating a property’s true value
An essential component of successful real estate investing is developing an
exit strategy or end game. Before you agree to pay a certain price for a prop-
erty, you must have a fairly accurate estimate of what you can sell it for.
Otherwise, you risk overpaying and losing money on your investment.
Estimating the market value of a house is easiest with the assistance of a real
estate agent who’s knowledgeable about property values in the area. A quali-
fied agent can pull up MLS (Multiple Listing Service) sheets on comparable
homes that have recently sold in the same neighborhood and quickly provide
22
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

you with a good idea of how much you can sell the property for, assuming it’s
in marketable condition and the market remains relatively stable. 
Don’t let your agent or the word on the street pump up your expectations or
estimates. Tell your agent that you want an estimated sales price based on
what the agent is sure she can get, not what she hopes she can get. Provide
your agent with as many details as possible about the property, so she can
look up similar properties that are truly comparable to the one you’re think-
ing of buying.
Never enter into a real estate deal unless you have at least two exits — a plan
A, typically for selling the property at a profit, and a plan B just in case plan A
doesn’t pan out. Your plan B may be to lease the property, live in it, or sell it
for slightly less than you planned to sell it, but you should always have a plan
B, because real estate transactions and markets are not always predictable.
Investigating the situation 
and the homeowners
The more you know about the homeowners and their situation, the better
able you are to assist them in extricating themselves from their current
predicament. Unfortunately, homeowners who are facing foreclosure often
feel isolated, ashamed, resentful, and defensive. They may not be very forth-
coming about the details that landed them in their current situation, and they
may see you as merely an opportunist who is trying to sell their property out
from under them.
In a way, they’re right. You probably do want the property, and you want to
make a profit. But that doesn’t change the fact that the homeowners are
trapped and need to explore their options. Your job at this stage is to con-
vince the homeowners that they will see better results working with you than
working with someone who’s not quite on the level. In Chapter 9, I show you
how to approach distressed homeowners and explain their options.
When you meet with homeowners, listen at least twice as much as you talk,
and try to gather the information that can enable you to provide more valu-
able guidance and assistance:
 The total amount owed on the first mortgage and all other liens on the
property, including any back taxes owed
 The current monthly payment on the house and on other outstanding
loans
 The names and contact information for all lien holders — lenders, 
contractors, or others who have a claim on the property
 The amount of time before the property goes up for auction
23
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Foreclosure Investing

 The value of any possessions the homeowners have that can be liquidated
 A list of any family members who may be able to help
 A clear idea of what the homeowners see as their options — sell the
house, move to a rental unit, relocate, scale down to a smaller house
This brief list can start you on your information-gathering mission, but as 
you talk with the homeowners, other issues and opportunities often present
themselves. Create a thorough record of your discussions with the home-
owners so you can begin to paint a portrait of them in your mind. The more
information you have, the more creative you can be in developing workable
viable solutions. See Chapter 8 for additional details.
Setting and Sticking To 
Your Maximum Bid
Even the most cold and calculating real estate investors become enthusiastic
about properties. They may fall in love with a particular house or simply get
so caught up in the heat of an auction that they bid too much for a property.
They then have to work twice as hard to make a profit on it.
Before you bid on a property or make an offer to the homeowners, you
should have a pretty clear idea of how much you can afford to pay for a prop-
erty to earn the desired return on your investment — usually no less than
20 percent. Write down the amount and make a firm commitment to yourself
to stick to it — bid or offer no more than your upper limit, no matter how
hyped you become during the bidding or negotiations.
In Chapter 10, I show you how to set a maximum price for a property when
preparing an offer to purchase directly from homeowners. In Chapter 11, I
lead you through the process of preparing a maximum bid for an auction 
setting, and let you in on some strategies for effective bidding.
Taking Possession of the Property
When you buy a house, you usually expect to move into it on the agreed-
upon date. You and the seller sign a purchase agreement in which the seller
agrees to vacate the premises and turn over the keys on a specified date.
Sometimes, the buyer requests possession at closing. In other cases, the
seller agrees to move out one or two weeks later.
24
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

With foreclosures, the transfer of a property can be a long, drawn out, and
messy affair. In some areas, you take immediate possession of a property as
soon as you offer the winning bid and pay the trustee or courtroom clerk. In
other cases, the homeowners retain possession of the property for the dura-
tion of the redemption period, which can last up to a year in some areas.
While you’re waiting for the redemption period to expire, you may be
tempted to start working on the house. Don’t. You may invest $10,000 in 
renovations only to have the property owner decide to redeem the property
just before you wrap up the project.
Even when the redemption period is over, you have no guarantee that the
previous homeowners are going to quietly and orderly vacate the premises
when their time runs out. In some cases, you can gently encourage the home-
owners to move out. In other cases, you have to forcefully evict them, which
is always a painful process for all parties.
In the following sections, I provide an overview of what to do to take formal
ownership of a property and eventually take possession of it. In Chapter 16, I
reveal your responsibilities as the new owner and cover the eviction process
in more detail.
Completing the essential paperwork
When you purchase a property directly from the homeowners, you and the
seller attend a closing in which a title company’s agent or an attorney shuffle
all the paperwork and file the necessary records.
When you purchase a property at an auction or sheriff’s sale, however, you
receive the deed, which you must then record at the Register of Deeds office
to have your name officially added to the title. See Chapter 11 for details.
After dropping off the deed to have it recorded, make sure you obtain title
insurance to protect you from any hidden claims against the property. Some
title companies do not offer title insurance for foreclosure properties or prop-
erties you pick up at a sheriff’s sale.
Paying property taxes and insurance
As soon as you purchase a property either from the homeowners or at an
auction, you become the official owner of the property even though you may
not be able to take immediate possession of it. As owner, you’re in charge of
insuring the property and paying property taxes:
25
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Foreclosure Investing

 Call your insurance agent to obtain a homeowners insurance policy for
the property. 
 Pay the property taxes as soon as they’re due. (You may need to pay
back taxes when you purchase the property.)
 File an affidavit proving you paid the insurance and property taxes. If the
homeowners decide to redeem the property, an affidavit enables you to
recover any taxes and insurance payments you made during the
redemption period.
See Chapter 16 for details concerning your responsibilities as a homeowner
during the redemption period.
Convincing the current residents to move on
As the official owner and soon-to-be possessor of the property, your goal is to
encourage the homeowners to move out without trashing the place or forcing
you to evict them. You want the property broom clean and in the same condi-
tion it was in or better than when you first inspected it. The key to success in
this area is to provide the homeowners an easy exit. Following are some sug-
gested perks for assisting the homeowners out the door:
 Offer cash for keys and a nonredemption certificate — a signed agree-
ment that the homeowners promise not to redeem the property.
 Provide a dumpster in which the homeowners can toss anything they
don’t want to move.
 Offer to pay for a moving van or pay a portion of their relocation costs.
 Offer to pay the first month’s rent on a rental unit.
Don’t hand over the cash until you get what you need. I’ve experienced 
several incidents in which homeowners took cash, agreed to move out, and
then stayed put. Chapter 16 offers some additional suggestions along with
instructions on how to evict homeowners who resist moving out.
Cashing Out: Realizing Your Profit
Assuming you purchase a property for the right price, you’ve already profited
from it, but you don’t see that profit until you cash out your chips. Various
cash-out strategies are available, which I discuss in the chapters in Part V.
The following sections provide a brief overview of your cash-out options.
26
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

Repairing and renovating the property 
to maximize its value
The most common way to cash out your profit is to repair and renovate the
property and then place it back on the market in the shortest possible time.
Time is of the essence, because every day you hold a property costs you —
in monthly payments (if you financed the purchase), property taxes, insur-
ance, and utilities.
The trick to repairing and renovating a property cost-effectively, as I explain
in Chapter 17, is to plan well in advance and improve the property only
enough to meet or slightly exceed the going price. Transforming a $150,000
property into a $250,000 property in a neighborhood where most homes sell
for around $150,000 is a huge mistake. If buyers want a $250,000 house, they
buy into a $250,000 neighborhood.
Marketing and selling to get top dollar
Your goal when selling a house is to sell it quickly at a price that’s pretty close
to its market value. To accomplish that goal, follow these marketing guidelines:
 Set the price right the first time. Don’t set a super-high price hoping 
that the fish will bite. Your investment property is likely to linger on the
market, during which time, holding costs continue to chip away at your
profit. An asking price that’s in line with comparably priced homes is best.
 Get the word out through a successful real estate agent. If you’re think-
ing of saving money on real estate commissions by selling the house
yourself, think again. Homes sell in about half the time and for more
money through a real estate agent. What you may save in commissions,
you end up losing through holding costs and by having to sell for a
lower price.
 Begin marketing as soon as you take possession. Marketing begins as
soon as you begin your renovations, especially if you start renovating
the exterior first. Neighbors notice and begin to gossip, and word-of-
mouth advertising begins to take off.
 Plant a For Sale sign on the front lawn when renovations are nearing
completion. A For Sale sign removes all doubt that the house is for sale.
 Stage the house impeccably. Clean and scrub inside and out, mow the
lawn, freshen up the landscape, remove the clutter, tastefully furnish
and decorate the interior, set out some fresh bouquets of flowers, and
let the buyers stream in. 
For additional tips and strategies to sell your property quickly and for top
dollar, check out Chapter 19.
27
Chapter 1: Wrapping Your Brain around Foreclosure Investing

Cashing out equity by refinancing
When you purchase a property for less than its market value, you automati-
cally have equity in the property. Renovations to bring the property up to its
market value add more equity.
You can cash out the equity by refinancing it for more than you paid for it to
realize your profit almost immediately. Keep in mind, however, that by refi-
nancing for more than the purchase price, you take on a larger mortgage, and
the increased interest chips away at your total profit over time. Refinancing
does, however, provide you with capital to fuel your next investment or to
pay for additional renovations.
For more about refinancing to cash out equity, skip to Chapter 19.
Profiting in other ways
Selling and refinancing are two of the quickest and most common ways to
realize the profit from foreclosures, but other strategies are also available:
 Negotiate a short sale. (See Chapter 15.)
 Lease the property. (See Chapter 18.)
 Lease the property back to its previous owners. (See Chapter 19.)
 Sell the property to the homeowners’ family members. (See Chapter 19.)
 Sell your position in the property to another lien holder. (See Chapter 19.)

Foreclosure Process

 Brushing up on the differences in how foreclosures are handled
 Investigating the early missed payment pre-foreclosure period

 Arriving at the foreclosure auction stage
 Waiting out post-foreclosure, from redemption to eviction
A
common foreclosure myth is that it’s a one-time event. Homeowners
miss a mortgage payment or two, and the lender swoops in and scoops
up the property. The fact is that foreclosure is typically a long, drawn-out
legal process that begins with missed payments, proceeds through some sort
of legal system, and often results in homeowners losing their homes.
An understanding of the foreclosure process reveals the various stages at
which you can purchase properties. By knowing what to expect, you can
often diminish disappointment and maximize your opportunities. 
This chapter provides a roadmap of the foreclosure process beginning with
some notice to the homeowners and the public of missed mortgage payments
and ending with the homeowners relinquishing possession of the property.
Anywhere along the way, the homeowner has options to interrupt the
process and regain control of the property. I point out these opportunities so
you can better assist homeowners in making choices and to give you a heads
up of what a homeowner can do to derail your purchase plans.
Homeowners find themselves facing foreclosure for any number of reasons,
including long-term illness or disability, overspending, substance abuse,
divorce, and gambling, to mention only a few. As a real estate investor, you
gain nothing by judging people in foreclosure. The best way to approach
homeowners in foreclosure is with respect and empathy. By enabling home-
owners to put the past behind them and establish a more solid financial foot-
ing, you may place them on a more productive path.

Identifying the Foreclosure 
Process in Your Area
The end result of foreclosure is that the homeowners lose ownership and ulti-
mately lose possession of their property. That’s true no matter where you’re
buying foreclosure properties. However, different states and counties follow
different foreclosure procedures. The two main procedures are:
 Foreclosure by trustee sale or foreclosure by advertisement
 Foreclosure by judicial sale or judicial foreclosure
The following sections describe these two types of foreclosure. To find out
which process your state follows, check the appendix at the back of this
book. Counties may also have their own local rules for how the sale is 
actually carried out, so visit your county courthouse (the Register of Deeds
office), and ask them to explain the rules and regulations. I also recommend
that you sit in on a few auctions before bidding on anything.
Foreclosure by trustee sale
A few more than half the states follow the trustee style route. When the
homeowners purchase a property in one of these states, the county issues a
sheriff’s deed that the trustee (which may be the sheriff in some areas) holds
in trust until the mortgage is paid in full. After paying off the mortgage, the
trustee releases the deed to the homeowners. 
If the homeowners default on the payment, the lender can notify the trustee
to initiate foreclosure proceedings. The trustee can then sell the property
and transfer proceeds to the lender as payment of the loan. Because the fore-
closure does not need to progress through the courts, foreclosure by trustee
sale is typically much faster than foreclosure by judicial sale.
Foreclosure by judicial sale
Fewer than half the states follow a judicial foreclosure process. As you’ve
probably guessed, judicial foreclosure passes through the justice system —
the state (circuit court) or district court. When the homeowners default on
their mortgage, the lender files a claim to recover the unpaid balance of the
loan from the borrowers. The courts decide the case, which typically takes 
a long time to resolve — typically 4 to 6 months, but sometimes up to a year.
During this time, unless the homeowners work out a payment plan or some
other solution with the lender, they’re almost guaranteed to lose their home. 
30
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

Exploring the Missed-Payment 
Notice Stage
Some lenders initiate foreclosure proceedings as soon as the homeowners
miss one or two payments. Other lenders start sending reminder notices,
often following a predictable timeline:
 Two-week notice: Some lenders give homeowners a two-week grace
period, after which they begin to start calling the homeowners or send-
ing them letters.
 30-day notice: When a payment is so late that it’s time for the next pay-
ment, the lender gets a little jittery and ramps up its efforts. The lender
may even begin levying late payment fees.
 45-to-60 days’ notice: Unless the homeowners contact the lender and
work out some new payment agreement, the lender typically sends out 
a certified letter insisting that the homeowners pay up. 
 90-day limit: If the homeowners still have not contacted the lender or
shown any commitment to make good on the loan, the lender typically
initiates formal foreclosure proceedings. At this point, the lender trans-
fers the matter to outside legal counsel (an attorney), and the attorney
in charge has a foreclosure notice (sometimes referred to as an NOD or
Notice of Default) posted. Once the attorney starts foreclosure by adver-
tisement, these legal notices or advertisements attract the investors.
The missed-payment notice stage, prior to the start of foreclosure proceedings,
is the best time for homeowners to act and the best time for you to step in to
assist them. In 90 percent or more of the foreclosures I’ve been involved in,
the homeowners’ best option is to sell the property, cut their losses, and find
more affordable housing. With your assistance, the homeowners still have
time at this stage to take advantage of this option. 
Getting Serious: The Notice of Default
For investors, the foreclosure process officially kicks off with the posting 
of the Notice of Default (NOD) or foreclosure notice in the county’s legal
newspaper or the local newspaper — private, for-profit publications that
get the word out to prospective bidders. At this point, the distressed home-
owners usually realize the inevitability of losing their property. Some remain
in denial while others become resigned to the fact, even though they may
have several options to abort the foreclosure process and regain control of
their property . . . and their finances.
31
Chapter 2: Getting Up to Speed on the Foreclosure Process

If you plan on purchasing properties prior to the foreclosure sale, your best
chance is to contact the homeowners before the NOD is posted. After the
NOD appears in the papers or in legal publications, competition for the prop-
erty begins to heat up. The only way to find distressed homeowners before
the NOD is posted is through word-of-mouth networking. See Chapter 3 for
additional guidance on choosing the stage of the foreclosure process that’s
right for you, and refer to Chapter 6 for word-of-mouth networking tips.
Proceeding to the Foreclosure Sale
Prior to the foreclosure sale, the homeowners can work with the lender or
their attorney to delay or cancel the foreclosure sale. In other words, just
because you see a foreclosure notice in the local paper doesn’t mean that 
if you show up for the sale, that property is going to be auctioned off.
Calling the attorney in charge of the foreclosure prior to the sale is a great
way to find out if the property is going to be offered at the sale. The attor-
ney’s name is usually listed on the foreclosure notice. In Chapter 7, I show
you how to pick out important details on the foreclosure notice.
At the foreclosure sale, you have an opportunity to bid against other
investors for any properties being auctioned off. As I explain in Chapter 11,
some auctions have open bidding, whereas others use a sealed bid system.
However your county chooses to hold its auctions, a few words of advice can
assist you in acquiring properties and not losing your shirt:
 Sit in on at least five auctions before bidding to get a feel for the process
and gather information.
 Research the property thoroughly before you bid. In Chapter 8, I show
you how to build a file for each property packed with useful details.
 Buy only senior liens (first mortgages). You can really get burned buying
junior liens because foreclosure typically wipes these off the books.
When you have more experience and knowledge, you can start working
the junior lien circuit and tax liens as I discuss in Chapter 15.
 Set a maximum bid and never ever exceed that amount, no matter how
juiced up you get at the auction. See Chapter 11 for details on how to
calculate your maximum bid.
 When you plan to bid, show up with a cashier’s check. Most auctions
require payment at time of purchase or within an hour. For additional
information on paying for a property after the auction, check out
Chapter 11.

Halting the Foreclosure Process
Distressed homeowners are plagued by a swarm of emotions ranging from
disbelief and resentment to shame and guilt. They may have several options
to stop the foreclosure process, but they’re too upset and confused to think
clearly or explore their options and so angry or fearful that they hesitate to
contact the lender in order to work out a solution.
In the following sections, I introduce various ways that homeowners in fore-
closure can stop or delay the foreclosure process. Use this information not
only to better assist distressed homeowners, but also to prepare yourself for
the possibility that the homeowners may choose to cut you out of a promis-
ing deal by successfully negotiating with the lender or another investor.
Encourage the homeowners to contact their lender, even if this results in you
losing a prospective property. Never supply misleading information to dis-
courage homeowners from taking the action that’s best for them. Be a real
estate investor, not a con artist. In addition keeping you out of legal trouble,
acting with integrity establishes goodwill with the homeowners and leads to
future referrals, as I point out in greater detail in Chapter 22.
Reinstating the mortgage
Prior to the foreclosure auction, homeowners who can get their hands on
enough cash may have the option of reinstating the mortgage. This consists of
making up for all missed payments and paying any late fees or other penalties.
To reinstate the mortgage, the homeowners must contact the lender prior 
to the auction date to verify that reinstatement is an option. If the option is
available, the homeowners must then work out a payment schedule with
their lender. 
If you’re trying to assist distressed homeowners in finding a solution, and
you’re running out of time, the homeowners can file for bankruptcy to buy
more time. See “Filing for bankruptcy,” later in this chapter for details.
Requesting and receiving a forbearance
When homeowners have a temporary loss of income with the promise of
regaining their financial footing, the lender may agree to a forbearance, in
which the homeowners can delay payment for a short period or negotiate 
a payment plan to make up for missed payments over the course of several
months, as explained in the following section.
33
Chapter 2: Getting Up to Speed on the Foreclosure Process

The lender may also offer some sort of combination between a forbearance
and reinstatement, enabling homeowners to delay payment for a short period
and then bring their payments current by a specific date.
The phone number on the mortgage payment coupons may put you in con-
tact with the loan servicer who processes the payments instead of the lender
who actually owns the loan. The loan servicer may not offer much assistance,
so ask the loan servicer who the lender is, and contact the lender directly. 
Mortgage modification or repayment plan
To enable financially strapped homeowners to slowly make up missed pay-
ments, a lender may agree to a mortgage modification or repayment plan:
34
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 
A smooth operator
I once purchased a property at a sheriff sale and
did everything I could to contact the homeowner.
I even tried to drop in on the homeowner, but she
slammed the door in my face as though she
knew who I was and had been expecting me.
Later, I discovered that a con artist, Brian, had
gotten to her during the redemption period. He
established some sort of emotional connection
with the homeowner, took her to the county
building to pick up the overbid (the money I paid
for the property at auction in excess of what
was owed on it), and convinced her that he
could save her house for her.
Brian bought her a vacuum cleaner and a few
groceries for her signature on a quit claim 
deed — a document signing away her rights to
the property. He videotaped her making state-
ments that he thought would protect him in the
court of law.
With quit claim deed in hand, Brian redeemed
the property, and I got my money back. Brian
then sold the property to an investor named Ray.
Ray came to my office, and I, without knowing
what had transpired, bought the property and
sold it to another investor. When that investor
showed up at the homeowner’s house to work
out some rental agreement with her, he learned
about the con job and wanted nothing to do with
the property.
Eventually, the matter wound up in court. I
bought back the property and gave the home-
owner some money so she could move to a
more affordable home. While in court, I got a
$100,000 judgment against Brian. Last I heard,
Brian was scheduled for a creditors hearing. 
Never take advantage of homeowners for your
own benefit. After all, this is their home, and any
equity they have in that home is theirs. Commit
to becoming a champion of the homeowners. If
you can help and earn some payment for your
assistance, everybody wins. Quick money never
lasts. By acting with integrity and in the best
interest of the homeowners, you provide a
much-needed service to a suffering portion of
your community. 

 A mortgage modification consists of adding the past-due payments and
penalties to the remaining principal, so the homeowners pay off the past-
due amounts and penalties over the life of the loan. This arrangement is
commonly known as “adding amounts due to the back of the loan.”
 A repayment plan enables the homeowners to submit payment of a por-
tion of their past-due amount and penalties with future payments until
the past-due amount and penalties are paid off.
When homeowners are already having trouble making their monthly mort-
gage payments and do not have the resources to cover higher payments,
mortgage modification and repayment plans are rarely ideal solutions. 
These options often simply delay the inevitable.
Filing for bankruptcy
Filing for bankruptcy sounds like a permanent solution to any significant
financial predicament like foreclosure, but it’s not the ideal solution. It
destroys the homeowner’s credit rating for seven years or so and doesn’t
exactly wipe all debt off the books. Bankruptcy simply relieves some of the
debt burden and provides homeowners some extra time to restructure their
remaining debt.
Bankruptcy, however, is one more option for distressed homeowners, and it’s
certainly something you should know about as an investor in foreclosures. 
By filing for bankruptcy, at least a couple of days before the auction date, 
a homeowner can delay the foreclosure process and leave a property you
already purchased in limbo — at least until the foreclosure trustee and the
courts sort out all the legal issues.
Bankruptcy is another opportunity for real estate investors. As the trustee 
or courts decide how to liquidate the property, you may be able to step in
and work with the lawyers and trustee to purchase the property and make
their lives a little easier. Chapter 14 shows you how to acquire properties 
in bankruptcy. 
Agreeing to a “deed in lieu of foreclosure”
When homeowners have very little to none or even negative equity built up
in their property and they have no hope of turning the financial tide, they
may offer the lender a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The homeowners agree to
pass the deed and their house keys to the lender without having to go
through a messy public foreclosure process.
35
Chapter 2: Getting Up to Speed on the Foreclosure Process

Although this may provide the homeowners with a less embarrassing escape
route, it often leaves the lender with a property that the lender doesn’t want
along with the expense of repairing and rehabbing the property and selling it.
As an investor, you may be able to step in as the ultimate middleman, negoti-
ate with the lender, getting it to accept less than the full loan amount due
(what real estate insiders call a short sale), and still provide the homeowner
with a clear escape route.
Some investors around the country make a really good living just working
short sales. If you can’t purchase a foreclosure property for a low enough
price to make a profit, negotiating a short sale can make the deal more prof-
itable. Keep in mind, however, that lenders won’t agree to short sales if they
foresee the homeowners walking away with money, and you shouldn’t negoti-
ate a lower payoff to put money in the pockets of the homeowners. See
Chapter 15 for details.
Getting one last chance during the
redemption period
Any reasonable person would assume that when he buys a property at a fore-
closure sale, it’s automatically his property, but that’s not always the case.
Many areas of the country have a mandatory redemption period, which can
last from a few months to an entire year. Check out the appendix at the back
of this book to find out about the redemption period in your area. 
During the redemption period, the person who purchased the property at 
the sale gets to insure the property and pay the property taxes, but the 
foreclosed-upon homeowners have the right to redeem the property. To do
so, the homeowners have to come up with enough cash to pay off the mort-
gage in full along with any interest and penalties. 
Depending on the rules that govern redemption in your area, the buyer may
or may not have the right to recover expenses (including property taxes and
insurance) from the homeowners. Consult your real estate attorney. 
If you purchase a property at a foreclosure sale in an area that has a manda-
tory redemption period, about 50 percent of the time you end up with the
property. The only sure way you end up with the property is in markets that
don’t have redemption periods. (Check out the appendix at the back of the
book to determine whether your state has a mandatory redemption period.)
To protect your investment in areas that have a redemption period, take the
following precautions:
36
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

 If possible, repair any defects in the house that may be considered
unsafe or lead to further deterioration of the property. If the property is
vacant and unsafe, and you don’t take care of the problem immediately,
the property is likely to lose value. Avoid investing any more money in
repairs than is absolutely necessary — if someone redeems the prop-
erty, you stand to lose that money.
 Insure the house, and file an affidavit of payment, so if the homeowners
redeem the property, you may be able to recoup your expenses. Consult
your real estate attorney to determine your rights to recover expenses.
 Pay the property taxes, and file an affidavit proving payment.
 Don’t invest in any renovations, just in case the homeowners do redeem
the property. You could lose all the money you invested in the renova-
tions. Generally you perform repairs only to protect your investment if
the house is vacant or if you’ve worked it out with the occupant. Different
states may have different abandonment laws which may restrict you from
doing anything. Your real estate attorney can provide guidance here.
 Keep an eye on the property to protect it from vandalism and theft. Some
disgruntled homeowners may strip the property before vacating it.
For additional advice on how to survive the redemption period, see Chapter 16.
All sales are not final in areas with redemption periods. If you miss out on an
opportunity during the foreclosure sale, you haven’t necessarily lost the prop-
erty for good. The homeowners still control the property, and you can work
with them to bump the investor who purchased the property out of the deal.
See Chapter 11 for details. Of course, the knife cuts both ways — you could end
up getting bumped. You get your money back, but you lose out on the property.
37
Chapter 2: Getting Up to Speed on the Foreclosure Process
Losing out on a junior lien
I bought a first mortgage (senior lien) at the first
foreclosure sale on a property for $25,000.
Another investor bought the second mortgage
(junior lien) for $25,000. Thinking that he had the
property in the bag, he spent another $25,000
during the redemption period renovating the
house, so now he had $50,000 invested in a
property that was worth about $100,000.
Sounds like a good deal, but the investor made
a huge mistake — he failed to pay off the senior
lien, which I held. He could have redeemed the
$25,000 senior lien that I held, sold the property
for $100,000, and made a $25,000 profit, but he
forgot to redeem the senior lien.
I took possession of the house and put it up for
sale. The other investor called all upset because
he was convinced that the house was his. I had
to explain that due to his oversight, the house
was not, in fact, his, but mine. 
The moral of the story is that if you buy a junior
lien attempting to control the senior lien,
remember to redeem that senior lien.

Finalizing the Foreclosure: Ushering 
the Previous Owners Out the Door
Eviction is an unpleasant experience for both the evictor and the evictee, so
you want to do everything you can, within reason, to encourage the previous
homeowners to voluntarily vacate. Offer them an incentive package — a free
dumpster, use of a moving van, relocation expenses, or whatever they need —
to put this problem behind them and move on to a potentially rosier future.
If that doesn’t work, you have no option but to file a request with the district
court to have the homeowners evicted. Once you file your request, assuming
it’s approved, the sheriff’s office delivers the homeowners an eviction notice
stating the date on which the eviction will occur. On that date, if the home-
owners haven’t vacated the premises, the sheriff shows up and forcefully
removes the homeowners and their belongings, and you formally take pos-
session of the property.
38
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 
Putting some empathy in eviction
I knew an investor who reveled in evictions. He
would drive to the eviction and park his red
Porsche out in front of the house and make fun
of the people being evicted. He even went so far
as to take photographs and hang them on his
office wall. The company he worked for was
doing a billion dollars’ worth of business annu-
ally, so maybe that made this cold-hearted
investor feel justified, but the only real justice
was what finally happened to him and all the
senior management at his company.
The Security and Exchange Commission inves-
tigated their business practices and found them
guilty of several counts of mortgage fraud. The
investor is now serving a four-year sentence in
a federal prison.
When you have to evict homeowners, do it with
heart. Put yourself in their shoes and try to
appreciate how you would feel in a similar situ-
ation or how you would feel if that was one of
your family members being evicted. If possible,
rent a moving truck for the homeowners and
help them pack and load their possessions.
Whatever you do, don’t cause additional pain
along with getting your gain.

oreclosure investing encompasses much more than simply buying proper-
ties for pennies on the dollar at a foreclosure auction. The foreclosure
process often takes three months to a year to run its course, and investors
can step into the process at any time to scoop up a property. In fact, investors
can even step in before official foreclosure proceedings begin and in some
areas months after they wrap up.
Although you can buy properties at numerous stages in the foreclosure
process, I recommend that you become a specialist in one area first. Focus 
on pre-auction properties, auctions, or post-auctions, so you can become 
an expert in one area. You can branch out later, as you become more experi-
enced, develop better connections, and strengthen your investment team 
and your financial position.
In this chapter, I reveal the various entry points in the foreclosure process,
covering everything from pre-auction to post-redemption, also known as REO
(Real Estate Owned) opportunities. I point out the pros and cons of investing
at each stage, so you can make a well-informed decision of where you’d like
to begin your journey in foreclosure investing.

Dipping In at the Pre-Auction Stage
Homeowners often feel reluctant to take action when they first get an inkling of
financial foreboding. Instead of contacting their lenders, an attorney, or a real
estate agent who specializes in foreclosures to seek advice and try to work out
a solution, they often stick their heads in the sand and hope the problem goes
away. By the time they act, they’re usually too late. Behind on their house pay-
ments, drowning in credit card debt, and unable to pay back taxes, their fate is
sealed months before the bank initiates foreclosure proceedings.
When the bank finally moves forward to foreclose, the homeowners are often
in a panic. They don’t know what to do or where to go for reliable informa-
tion. As a foreclosure investor, you can step into the process, provide home-
owners with options to cut their losses, and perhaps even assist in enabling
the homeowners to retain possession of their property.
You may think that doing everything you can to enable homeowners to
retain possession of their property is contrary to the idea of profiting from
foreclosures. In about 90 percent of pre-auction foreclosures, however, the
homeowners are too deep in debt and must sell their home. By acting with
integrity, you give yourself a much better chance of obtaining the property . . .
and doing some good at the same time. See Chapter 21 for specific ways you
can assist distressed homeowners.
Exploring the pros and cons 
of pre-auction foreclosures
Although you can certainly wait for the foreclosure auction to roll around,
the pre-auction stage offers several benefits to foreclosure investors:
 Less competition from other investors.
 More options for negotiating deals with homeowners and their lenders.
 More time to put together a deal and close on the house.
 Increased opportunity to inspect the condition of the house, inside 
and out.
 No redemption period or other legal issues at the end that can sink the
deal. Once you close on the property, it’s yours. You may have to wait a
week or two to take possession, depending on your agreement with the
homeowners, but you don’t have to wait three months to a year for the
redemption period to expire. For more about redemption, skip to the
section near the end of this chapter called “Waiting Out the Redemption
Period — If Necessary.”
40
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

At this point, you’re probably ready to dive into the pre-auction stage and
start scooping up properties from homeowners eager to shed the financial
burden. Before you leap, consider some of the following drawbacks of buying
directly from homeowners: 
 Emotional fallout, including anger and resentment, from the loss of 
a home
 Complications of dealing with other people’s financial messes
 Misleading information or outright lies from homeowners who are still 
in denial
 Indecisiveness of homeowners who change their minds at the last
minute because they really don’t know what they want
 Legal issues of just how far you can go to convince homeowners to sell
their property at less than market value
Carefully consider the pros and cons before investing in anything and 
honestly assess your ability to deal with the negative aspects of certain
investment options. Buying foreclosure properties in the pre-auction stage
isn’t for everyone.
Guiding homeowners to good decisions
When helping homeowners, you can’t try to pass yourself off as an attorney,
accountant, financial advisor, or therapist, unless you really are one. However,
you’re often called on to play some of these roles. Like a therapist, you have
to learn to listen to the homeowners. Like an accountant, you need to be able
to look at the homeowners’ finances to assess their options. And, like an attor-
ney, you need to know the foreclosure and redemption laws in your area.
Make it very clear to the homeowners that you are not an attorney, real
estate agent, or accountant, unless you really are one. State up front that
you’re an investor representing yourself. Full disclosure is the best policy.
Passing yourself off as something you’re not is fraud.
You cannot offer legal advice if you’re not a licensed lawyer, but you can
inform homeowners of their options and recommend professionals who can
help. If the homeowners can refinance their way out of a foreclosure, you
may be able to steer them to a loan officer or financial advisor who can pro-
vide additional assistance. In Chapter 4, I show you how to assemble a team
of experts to assist you in buying and selling foreclosure properties, so you
should have plenty of experts on hand to recommend to the homeowners.
41
Chapter 3: Picking Your Point of Entry in the Foreclosure Process

Dealing with anger and angst
Understandably, when people are in a financial bind, they’re often upset, 
anxious, and angry. Parents have the daunting task of facing their kids and
telling them, “We can no longer afford to live here.” They’re embarrassed
about what their neighbors, friends, and family may think. They may be
angry at their boss for laying them off or firing them. In many cases, the 
husband or wife has just found out about the pending foreclosure from 
their significant other who spent the family into the poorhouse.
When you show up at the home of a couple or individual facing foreclosure,
and you tell the homeowners that you want to help them by buying their
property, all that rage is likely to get unleashed on you. Even if you can
manage to avoid direct conflict, you may very well end up refereeing a
domestic dispute or witnessing emotional outpourings that you’re just not
used to seeing. 
Distressed homeowners are often most upset about something that hap-
pened in the past — something that they can’t go back in time and fix. One of
your first jobs when dealing directly with homeowners is to encourage them
to put the past behind them and address the current situation. This takes a
lot of steam out of anger over the past. See Chapter 9 for more tips on defus-
ing potentially explosive situations.
42
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 
A typical day in the foreclosure office
As a real estate broker, I once met with a couple
facing foreclosure. The husband worked two
jobs, and the wife took care of the bills. Though
he was working hard to make ends meet, the
couple had fallen behind in their mortgage pay-
ments and were receiving notices from their
lender. We set up a meeting at my office to do a
conference call with the lender to work out a
possible solution.
When the couple arrived at my office, I immedi-
ately saw the nature of the problem. The wife
was decked out in designer clothes and adorned
in jewelry that would have made the Queen of
England jealous. 
After looking over their finances, I explained
that in order to avoid foreclosure, the couple
would need to slash expenses and sell some of
their more valuable assets.
Upon hearing my words, the wife was visibly
upset. Angry and near tears, she stood up and
said, “What do you want me to do . . . take the
clothes off my back and the rings off my fingers?!”
I said, “You can leave your clothes on, but let’s
take a closer look at those rings.” The couple
was $10,000 behind on their mortgage pay-
ments. I agreed to take the jewelry and give
them $10,000 in return, so they could sell the
house and move on. The next day, I took the
jewelry to a friend of mine who owned a jewelry
store. He appraised the rings at $5,000. So, I
ended up taking a $5,000 loss, but I scored a
great Valentine’s Day gift for my wife!

You can often relieve some of the pain of foreclosure by letting the homeowners
know that they’re not alone. Know the foreclosure statistics for your area,
and share this information with them along with letting them know about
their options. This can often defuse a tense situation and remove some of the
anger that may be causing a rift in a couple’s relationship. Ask at your county’s
Register of Deeds office — sometimes they track foreclosure numbers for the
county and may be able to quote state statistics. 
Assessing your ability to deal 
with pre-auction scenarios
The most successful pre-auction investors are people who are well versed on
local foreclosure laws and procedures and who can quickly and accurately
assess the average homeowner’s financial predicament. To determine if you
have the qualities to successfully invest in properties in the pre-auction
stage, place a checkmark next to any of the following statements that you 
feel are true:
❏People generally like me and trust me right off the bat.
❏I feel comfortable talking with people I’ve never met.
❏I’m a good listener.
❏I’m diplomatic, often acting as the mediator when friends, family 
members, or co-workers have issues with one another.
❏I never met a problem I couldn’t solve.
❏I’m good with math, especially dollars and cents.
❏I can tell people the truth even when they don’t really want to hear it.
❏I can handle disappointment. Even if I’ve invested a great deal of time
and effort in helping a homeowner, I won’t get terribly upset if I don’t 
get the house.
❏I can let people fail, even after I offer them outstanding advice on how 
to avoid a catastrophe.
Having every single one of these qualities is not essential for success in
investing in pre-auction properties, but if you checked only two or three
items, you may want to consider stepping into the foreclosure process at 
the auction or post-auction stage. The more of these qualities you have, the
more successful you may be in dealing directly with the homeowners.
43
Chapter 3: Picking Your Point of Entry in the Foreclosure Process

Pursuing Foreclosure Notices
Whether you buy properties directly from homeowners prior to the auction
or wait until the auction stage, the weekly foreclosure notices in your area
are required reading. In almost all areas of the country, the lender must
post a weekly foreclosure notice or Notice of Default (NOD) in a publicly
accessible publication several weeks prior to the auction. In my area, the
foreclosure notice must be posted for four consecutive weeks prior to the
sale in any public newspaper that serves the area. The appendix at the back of
this book explains each state’s requirements for posting foreclosure notices. 
The posting of the foreclosure notice is almost an entirely separate stage of
the foreclosure process — after negotiations between the homeowners and
lender break down, but before the property is sold at auction. At this stage,
every foreclosure investor in your area probably knows about the property,
and any investors interested in buying the property prior to auction are likely
in the process of trying to contact the homeowners.
The investor who arrives first and whom the homeowners trust most is 
typically the investor who stands to get the property.
As you discover in Chapter 7, you can find foreclosure properties even 
before the foreclosure notice is posted by keeping your ears open, network-
ing effectively, as explained in Chapter 6, and getting the word out that you
buy properties.
Knowing the benefits of waiting 
for the foreclosure notice
Many foreclosure investors don’t like dealing with distressed homeowners
until the official foreclosure notice is posted because until that point, home-
owners may be unwilling to accept the fact that foreclosure is imminent. The
posting of the foreclosure notice removes most of the lingering doubt and
acts as a wakeup call for the homeowners to take action.
The foreclosure notice offers several additional benefits:
 Contains the location of the property (usually a legal address, not a 
mailing address, but you can use the legal address to obtain the mailing
address, as discussed in Chapter 11)
44
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

 Lists the names of the homeowners being foreclosed upon, so you can
refer to them by name, instead of addressing them as Dear Sir or Madam
 Specifies the name of the lender foreclosing on the property, so 
you have the information you need to gather more information from 
the lender
 Provides the name of the attorney or trustee in charge of liquidating the
property, so you have someone to call for additional details
As you learn throughout your experience as a foreclosure investor, every bit
of information you have about a property is a valuable puzzle piece that clari-
fies the situation and enables you to put together an attractive deal that ben-
efits all those involved.
Just because the lender posts a foreclosure notice does not mean that the
property is destined for the auction block. Any time prior to the sale, the
homeowners can strike a deal with the lender or refinance to call off the 
foreclosure or strike a deal with an investor to sell the property. As soon 
as the foreclosure notice is posted, the clock starts ticking for any investor
looking to buy the property prior to auction.
Keep track of properties from the day they’re advertised to the time they’re
sold. Very often, a particular foreclosure sale is adjourned, so the property
doesn’t go up for auction on the scheduled day. By following the adjourn-
ments, you often find that the property goes up for sale later. If you’re pre-
pared, you may be able to grab the property without any competing bids.
Weighing the drawbacks of waiting 
for the foreclosure notice
Although the posting of the foreclosure notice delivers some valuable 
benefits to foreclosure investors, it also heats up competition among area
investors who are all looking for the best deals in the area. As soon as that
foreclosure notice is published, every foreclosure investor working the pre-
auction circuit catches the scent and heads out to research the property and
contact the homeowners.
When buying properties from distressed homeowners prior to auction, 
finding out about prospective foreclosure properties prior to the posting of
the notice often gives you a competitive edge. Networking, as discussed in
Chapter 6, provides the earliest leads. Reading the notices as soon as they’re
posted and acting quickly to contact the homeowners is the next best option.

Chapter 3: Picking Your Point of Entry in the Foreclosure Process

Wrapping up your deal before the sale
Buying a property from the homeowners prior to the sale is a standard seller-
to-buyer transaction. If you’ve ever bought a house (you should be a home-
owner if you’re investing in real estate), then you know the drill:
1. Present your offer to the homeowners in the form of a purchase
agreement. You may need to work through a series of counteroffers to
agree on a price and terms.
2. Have the property professionally inspected.
3. Order title insurance to protect yourself if the title has any hidden
claims against it.
4. Sign the papers at closing.
5. Take possession of the property on the agreed-upon date.
Because you purchased the property directly from the homeowners, they
have no right of redemption, so you don’t have to wait around for several
months. You can immediately move into the property, renovate and sell it, or
turn it into a rental unit. Refer to Part V for more details about profiting from
a property after you take possession of it. 
Bidding for a Property at 
a Foreclosure Auction
Foreclosure investors often choose to do their bidding at auctions. A
common misconception about foreclosure auctions is that investors bid on
properties. The truth is that investors bid on mortgages (also called liens).
What’s the difference? When you buy a property from homeowners, you own
the property. When you buy a lien at a foreclosure sale, you may or may not
eventually take possession of the property — if your area has a redemption
period, the homeowners or someone else who has a legal claim to the prop-
erty can redeem it. Check the appendix at the back of this book and consult
your county’s Register of Deeds office to find out more about the redemption
period in your state.
For a better understanding of what you’re actually buying at a foreclosure
auction, brush up on the following types of liens:
46
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

 Senior lien: The senior lien or first mortgage is the loan that the home-
owners took out to purchase the property. I recommend that novice
investors always buy first mortgages, because owning the senior lien
gives you the best opportunity to eventually take possession of the
property.
 Junior lien: The junior lien is any other loan the homeowners took 
out using their home as collateral. A junior lien is usually a second 
mortgage, but it can be a home equity loan or contractor financing pro-
vided for home improvements. Junior liens are often wiped off the books
during the foreclosure process, so they are often very risky investments.
 Tax lien: A tax lien is a claim against the property for unpaid tax bills.
Unlike junior liens that foreclosure typically erases, a tax lien remains 
in place after foreclosure. If the tax lien is for overdue property taxes,
the buyer must pay the taxes. If the lien is for income taxes, the IRS or
other taxing agency may choose to forgive the taxes, but make sure the
foreclosing attorney notifies the IRS, as explained in Chapter 11. Buying
a property tax lien is usually a safe investment, because if someone else
purchases the property, you stand to get your money back and perhaps
even earn a little profit. For more about profiting from tax liens, see
Chapter 15.
47
Chapter 3: Picking Your Point of Entry in the Foreclosure Process
Standing afar from the maddening crowd
I always recommend that first-time foreclosure
investors sit in at least five auctions before bid-
ding. This gives you a feel for the auction
process, enables you to identify the players in
your neighborhood, and can often lead to con-
nections that may pay future dividends.
When you begin sitting in on auctions, you’re
likely to notice the same people showing up
week after week, a majority of whom never bid
on properties. Some people attend for the enter-
tainment value, and that’s fine, but others con-
sider themselves the resident foreclosure
experts. A new face in the crowd draws their
attention, and they offer what they’re convinced
is solid investment advice.
Steer clear of these foreclosure investor phonies.
You can be nice, smile, and exchange the usual
pleasantries, but the majority of the hand-sitters
at foreclosure auctions who actively pursue you
to bend your ear are either doing so for attention
or to sell you a bill of goods — an investment
property that they got stuck with.
The people you want to seek advice from are
the people showing up every week, bidding on
properties, buying them, and turning them over
for a profit. Unfortunately, these knowledgeable
individuals aren’t likely to share their wisdom
with a novice investor looking to compete
against them. If you can earn their trust and
offer something of value in exchange, they may
be willing to pass along some advice, but don’t
hold your breath.

Don’t bid at auctions until you fully understand the process and know what
you’re buying. Whenever a foreclosure guru stages a foreclosure seminar in
my area, my office begins receiving calls from angry novice investors who
purchased junior liens thinking they were buying senior liens. One investor
purchased over $100,000 in junior liens only to find out later that these liens
were useless pieces of paper. Chapter 11 shows you how to prepare for an
auction well in advance.
Weighing the pros and cons 
of buying at auctions
The foreclosure auction provides you with an opportunity to purchase a 
controlling interest in the property without having to deal directly with the
homeowners in often emotional and ugly situations. In a way, the auction 
simplifies the process of acquiring properties. You show up, submit the 
winning bid, and walk away with the sheriff’s deed.
Buying at auction, however, presents several additional challenges, including
the following:
 You may not have the opportunity to thoroughly inspect the property,
although you should at least inspect the property from the outside, as I
advise in Chapter 8.
 Properties are often sold as is, so you’re more likely to take possession
of a property that requires costly repairs.
 Cash payment is usually required at the time of purchase, so you need to
show up with cashiers check. In some cases, you have a few hours or
days to come up with the cash, but you still need ready access to cash
to close on the deal.
 Depending on the number of investors at the auction who actually bid
on properties, you may face some stiff competition.
 When you buy a property at an auction in an area that has a mandatory
redemption period, you may need sufficient funds to hold the property
for several months to a year until you see your profit. (If you’re using
your own money, you need just enough cash to insure the house and
pay the property taxes. If you borrowed the money, you may need addi-
tional cash to cover the monthly payments. For more about financing
your purchase, refer to Chapter 5.)
48
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

Throughout this book, but especially in Chapters 10 and 11, I reveal tips and
techniques for meeting these challenges and minimizing your risks of bidding
at auctions. Only by being thoroughly prepared going into an auction can you
confidently purchase properties that are almost sure to turn a profit.
Setting a maximum bid well in advance
One big mistake to avoid at an auction is getting caught up in the excitement
of the bidding experience. I know the risks of overbidding firsthand, because
I have trouble restraining myself at auctions. I hate to lose, so if someone’s
bidding against me, I always win — the bid, that is. Only later do I realize that
my obsession with winning made me the big loser for having spent too much
for a property.
The trick to effective bidding is to research the property thoroughly and set
the highest price you can afford to pay for the property and still make a profit
of 20 percent or more. That’s your ceiling. You can bump your head on it, but
don’t crash your head through it, or you will have serious headaches in the
future. For auction bidding tips and tricks, see Chapter 11.
Putting on your poker face
Bidding on a property at foreclosure is a bit like sitting around a poker table
and trying to figure out why a particular investor is bidding on a specific
property for a certain amount of money. In some cases, the other investor
may know more about the property than you do. In other cases, the investor
knows less. The person may be bidding on instinct to drive up bidding or
simply to toy with other investors. 
The comparison of bidding on foreclosure properties to playing poker, how-
ever, ends there. Bidding on properties is a high-stakes game in which you
stand to lose as much or even more than you stand to gain. You may never
know why a particular investor bids a specific amount on the property, but
you always need to know why you’re bidding a specific amount, what you’re
bidding on, and how high you’re willing to bid.
With a fully fleshed-out property dossier, which I show you how to assemble
in Chapter 8, you hold all the cards in the deck. This enables you to put on
the dispassionate poker face required to win the bidding game. You know
exactly how much you can afford to bid to earn the desired profit. Not every-
one who’s bidding against you will have the same advantage.

Chapter 3: Picking Your Point of Entry in the Foreclosure Process

Acquiring Properties after the Auction
The auction close doesn’t signal the end of your opportunity to acquire fore-
closure properties. For investors who choose to focus on post-auction prop-
erties, an auction’s close signals the beginning. These investors don’t want 
to deal directly with homeowners, and they prefer to avoid the sometimes
messy auction process. They’d rather buy properties from the new owners.
In the following sections, I list various opportunities and resources for track-
ing down post-auction properties, from bank-owned and government-owned
repos to properties that have been seized because they were paid for with 
ill-gotten gains. You can make a good profit by focusing on any one of the 
categories I describe.
The opening bid at an auction is typically the amount owed on the property,
plus attorney fees, plus a dollar. Contrary to what many people think, banks
don’t want to be in the real estate business, so they rarely bid up a property
in order to take possession of it. A bank holding a second lien may, however,
bid on the first lien to protect the bank’s interest. 
Scoping out REO properties
Auctions typically start out with a minimum bid. If nobody in the room bids
high enough, a representative for the bank that’s foreclosing offers a bid and
takes possession of the deed. The bank transfers the property to its REO
(Real Estate Owned) or OREO (Other Real Estate Owned) department, which
then prepares the property for sale.
Because preparing properties for sale and selling them costs banks addi-
tional money, they’re often willing to negotiate sales with investors rather
than place the properties on the market.
Admittedly, the process sounds pretty easy, but it can be very challenging for
any or all of the following reasons:
 Banks don’t like to sell properties at bargain-basement prices just to
unload them.
 REO managers often pass the best deals onto their closest contacts and
investors with proven track records, so you may need to invest some
time in building fruitful relationships.
50
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

 REO managers may require you to buy two or more properties as a pack-
age deal — you must agree to take one not-so-promising property along
with another that has more potential.
 Properties are sold as-is, so you can get stuck with a lemon.
Chapter 12 brings you quickly up to speed with the REO process, reveals
ways to contact and work with REO managers, and suggests timing your 
offer to coincide with the REO department’s fiscal calendar.
Finding and buying government properties
The United States government sponsors several programs to encourage
home ownership, including HUD (Department of Housing and Urban
Development) and VA (Veteran’s Administration) financing. Often, borrowers
default on these loans, and the government ends up with a property that it
doesn’t need or want. In addition, state and local governments may seize
properties for infrastructure improvements or as a result of unpaid taxes 
or criminal activities.
As a citizen, you have the right to purchase these government properties,
and you can often pick them up at deep discounts. Following is a list of
common resources for government-owned properties:
 HUD and VA repos: When homeowners default on a HUD or VA home
loan, like any lender, the government can choose to foreclose on the
property. These are not always the best deals for investors, because
HUD and VA homes are commonly listed at or just below market value,
but by being persistent, you can often find some pretty good deals.
 State department of transportation: The department of transportation
commonly buys up property for road improvements and then disposes
of the property after completing the project. 
 State or county drug enforcement agency: If a homeowner is paying 
for a property with illicit funds or the house is home to criminal activity,
the government may step in, take possession of the property, evict the
homeowners, and sell the house. 
 County sheriff’s office: When your county sheriff’s office seizes a prop-
erty, perhaps because it was purchased with proceeds from criminal
activity, it may offer the property for sale through a broker or at auction.
This list merely introduces the investment opportunities available in 
government-owned properties. For details on how to find and take advan-
tage of these opportunities, visit Chapter 13.
51
Chapter 3: Picking Your Point of Entry in the Foreclosure Process

A condominium association can also foreclose on a property to collect
unpaid condominium fees. Remember, however, that a condo lien is just
another lien. The senior lien (first mortgage) takes precedent.
Buying properties from other investors
Some foreclosure investors are more interested in discovering and acquiring
foreclosure properties than they are in fixing them up and reselling them.
They consider themselves foreclosure wholesalers — finding and buying 
properties and then selling them to other investors.
Generally, I advise against buying properties from foreclosure wholesalers or
whatever they call themselves. Whenever someone tries to sell you on some
great investment opportunity, ask yourself this question: “If the property
were as profitable as this person wants me to think, then why doesn’t she fix
it up and sell it herself?” Another reason not to buy from other investors, is
because by doing so, you’re usually paying a markup or finder’s fee. Plenty 
of foreclosure properties are available, and they’re not that difficult to track
down, so pocket the markup and use that money for renovations or to 
purchase your next property. Of course, if you’ve done your research, as
explained in Chapter 8, and the price is right, I certainly wouldn’t tell you 
to pass on it. 
Just as I advise against buying properties from foreclosure wholesalers, I
strongly discourage you from becoming a foreclosure wholesaler yourself.
You can make more money by working the foreclosure from start to finish —
buy, renovate, and sell. For details about renovating and selling a house for
more than you bought it, check out my other For Dummies book — Flipping
Houses For Dummies (Wiley).
Waiting Out the Redemption Period — 
If Necessary 
Many areas of the country give foreclosed-upon homeowners one last chance
to get their homes back — through redemption. If the homeowners can come
up with enough money to pay off the balance of their loans and all penalties
and back taxes, then they get to keep the property. In some cases, home-
owners have up to a year to redeem their property before the high bidder
at the auction takes possession.
52
Part I: Prepping Yourself for Foreclosure Success 

The redemption period can impact you in any of several ways:
 If you purchased the property at auction, you have to wait to do anything
to the property until after the redemption period expires. Otherwise, you
may invest heavily in renovations only to see the homeowners or another
investor redeem the mortgage you bought and cut you out of the deal.
You may need to secure the home (particularly if it’s vacant) and perform
repairs to make the property safe and prevent deterioration, such as
from a leaky roof, but invest as little as possible during this period.
 The homeowners may still be able to file for bankruptcy during the
redemption period to buy themselves some additional time, which can
throw your plans for renovating and selling the property for a loop.
 If another investor purchased a property and is waiting for the redemption
period to expire, you still have an opportunity to purchase the property.
You can work with the homeowners to bump the other investor out of the
deal, redeem the property, and buy it directly from the homeowners. 
Surviving the redemption period can be a little tricky, especially if other
investors take interest in the property. Chapter 16 shows you what you
should be doing during this time to protect your interest. Flip to the appendix
at the back of this book to find out whether your state has a redemption
period and find out its typical duration.

 Contracting out home repairs and renovations
 Weighing the pros and cons of partnerships
A
t first glance, the investing in foreclosures can seem daunting. You have
to know how to find a foreclosure property, finance the purchase and
renovations, fix it up, and then sell it . . . all on schedule and typically within a
tight budget. 
The good news is that you can get by with a moderate amount of knowledge
and expertise, as long as you know where and how to find good help. With a
list of contacts, a phone, and some people skills, you can delegate your way
to successfully investing in foreclosures.
In this chapter, I guide you through the process of building a top-notch team
of real estate professionals, consisting of an agent, attorney, mortgage broker,
accountant, title company, home inspector, contractors, and additional sup-
port personnel. 
What role do you play on your investment team? You’re the resident foreclo-
sure expert. This book along with the guidance of your real estate attorney,
title company, real estate agent, and other real estate professionals can get
you up to speed on the process, but when decision time arrives, you’re on
the hot seat, deciding how much to offer, scheduling the work, and watching
the money.

Lawyering Up with a 
Real Estate Attorney
Real estate deals are primarily legal and financial transactions. Buying fore-
closures involves even more legal complexities, so you should never move
forward on a deal without competent legal assistance or sign any purchase
agreements without the benefit of an attorney’s legal eagle eye.
Don’t hire just any old attorney. Look for an attorney with the specialty you
need and other qualifications that make the attorney a perfect candidate for
the job:
 Specialty in foreclosures: Foreclosure laws can be tricky. Choose a real
estate attorney who has plenty of experience working the foreclosure
circuit.
 Specialty in bankruptcy: A real estate attorney who also specializes in
bankruptcies is a big plus. In addition to delivering to you expertise on
investing in bankruptcy properties, your attorney may steer you to
some great leads from his less fortunate clients.
 Positive personal referrals: If possible, find a real estate attorney rec-
ommended by a friend or relative, instead of simply picking the first
attorney you come across in the phone book. 
 Efficient and affordable: For a lot of foreclosure-action services, look 
to pay a flat fee, not by the hour or (gasp) minute. For example, an attor-
ney may quote $600 for an eviction action, more if it turns out to be 
complicated . . . they’ll let you know. Look for affordable, not necessarily
cheap — you often get what you pay for.
 Supportive: Someone who second guesses your decision to invest can
paralyze you with doubt. You want an attorney to steer you clear of
potential legal pitfalls, but not one who nitpicks every transaction.
 Available: A good lawyer is available when you need her.
 Experienced: A real estate attorney who owns real estate and rentals or
even buys foreclosures is better than one who doesn’t.
 Generous: A lawyer who shares his leads can help you find properties
that you couldn’t find on your own. Be careful to avoid sloppy seconds —
properties that the attorney sends your way because they’re not prof-
itable enough for her.
If your friends, relatives, real estate agent, title company, or other people you
know can’t recommend an excellent real estate attorney, call the local bar
association for the names and contact information of a few real estate attor-
neys or bankruptcy lawyers and start from there. In some cases, the attorney
you call may not be the right one for you, but he may refer you to someone
who is. If all else fails, inquire at a firm mentioned in a foreclosure notice.
58
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Teaming Up with a Good Moneyman —
or Woman
Money not only makes the world go ’round, it also moves houses. You need
money to purchase a property. Your foreclosure clients may need financing to
take action on one of the options you present. And people buying property
from you often require financing to close on the deal.
Where do you find all this money? Hunt down someone who specializes in
home financing: a mortgage broker (commonly called a loan officer). By team-
ing up with a loan officer, you not only have the means to secure financing for
your investments, but you also have someone on call for when distressed
homeowners need advice or someone interested in purchasing the property
from you needs financing.
All mortgage brokers are not necessarily equal, some may not even be
licensed, so shop carefully for a quality, licensed mortgage broker. A qualified
broker can save you thousands in finance fees and interest. Look for the fol-
lowing qualities in a mortgage broker:
 State licensed.
 Member of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB) or the
Mortgage Brokers Association (MBA) or both.
 Positive personal referrals from people who have worked directly with
the mortgage broker. Ask your attorney, bank, friends, family members,
and colleagues for references. 
 An understanding of foreclosures, because you need to borrow money
based on the future value of the property, not the purchase price. By
borrowing on the future value (or repaired value) of the property, you
gain access to more cash for repairs, renovations, and other investment
properties.
 No conflicting relationships. A mortgage broker who works in the fore-
closure arena my have relationships with homeowners in foreclosure or
other investors that may create a conflict of interest. 
Laws require that anyone who wants to loan money work through a licensed
mortgage broker, so if you want to use other people’s money to finance your
investment, you almost always have to work through a mortgage broker or
directly with a lending institution, such as a bank.
To obtain assistance from a mortgage broker, consider writing a letter of
introduction, like the letter shown in Figure 4-1. Let the broker know that
you’re going to be investing in foreclosures and you may run into clients who
require the broker’s assistance.

Consulting a Title Company 
to Cover Your Back
Although you should hone your own title-inspection skills, a title company

 Provide a second set of well-trained eyes to inspect the title and ensure
that it’s in a recordable form.
 Deliver a title commitment and chain of title, showing the history of own-
ership and any claims against the property. This ensures that the person
selling the property is the person who owns it and makes you aware of
any liens against or property taxes owed on the property.
A title commitment is a promise by the title company to insure the title
against any future disputes concerning ownership. It typically states who is
being insured, the amount of the insurance, a description of the property,
conditions that must be met to secure title insurance, and a list of what’s not
insured. 
 Provide title insurance when you purchase the property to protect you
from any financial loss if someone has a legitimate claim against the
property that the title company missed. The title company also makes
sure that any rights to the property, such as mineral rights, are trans-
ferred to you (if owned by the seller).
 Highlight any homeowner association liens against the property. 
 Inform you of any restrictions on the property or covenants on the land.
If you’re buying a home in a historical area, for example, the renovations
may have restrictions. Certain covenants may prohibit you from remov-
ing living trees from the land or limit the total square footage of the
house. If these restrictions are valid and you violate them, adjacent
property owners can sue you. 
 Further educate you concerning foreclosure laws and regulations in
your area.
 Provide additional leads on foreclosure opportunities.
 Refer you to other real estate professionals who can assist you with
your investments.
Try to hook up with a title company that provides title insurance for the fore-
closing attorneys in your area. A company that handles foreclosures regularly
knows the common problems to look for in the title. Reputation and location
are your two other main considerations. Pick a company that’s nearby and
has the best reputation for smooth closings. Your real estate attorney or
agent can recommend a title company that has a solid reputation in the area.
Smaller towns may have only one title company.
Meet with one of the title company’s representatives to explain that you’re
going to be investing in foreclosure policies. The company may provide you
with free title commitments on a few properties in the hopes of gaining your
business when you close on a property and need title insurance.  
61
Chapter 4: Building a Powerful Foreclosure Investment Team

One of the first questions to ask a title company representative is whether
the company does title work on foreclosure properties. Many times, under-
writers do not do title work on foreclosures. If the company you’re consider-
ing does not work on foreclosures, keep looking for one that does.
Hiring a Tax-Savvy Accountant
Most of the accounting that applies to investing in foreclosures consists of
simple addition and subtraction. Add up the costs of buying, renovating, and
selling the house and subtract that from the amount you receive when you
sell the house, and if you come up with a positive number, you made money.
Unfortunately, reality is a little more complex, and having a professional
accountant on hand can help you avoid unnecessary expenses and legal
woes. Your accountant can take all your money and receipts out of your shoe
box, sort through them, figure out whether you made any money, and if you
did make money, she can calculate the amount of tax you owe. An experi-
enced accountant also delivers the following benefits:
 Saves you money on income tax while remaining in compliance with
often complex tax laws
 Ensures that you pay your property taxes on time
 Evaluates your real estate investment activities to determine whether
you’re considered an investor or a self-employed dealer — essentially
the difference between a part-time and full-time investor
 Pays your quarterly estimated taxes if you’re considered a self-employed
dealer
 Pays your quarterly estimated taxes on your capital gains if you’re 
considered an investor
 May assist you in keeping your renovation expenses within budget
Go with an accountant who has plenty of experiencing keeping the books for
real estate investors. If you already have a general accountant who files your
state and federal tax returns but has little experience in the real estate arena,
consider hiring a different accountant to keep the books for your real estate
investments. Ask your real estate attorney or agent for recommendations.
Your current accountant may also know someone who’s more qualified to
deal with real estate. Interview at least three candidates.
If you’re good with numbers and have a solid understanding of tax laws that
apply to real estate investments, you can take on this job yourself. If you’re
not real estate tax savvy, however, you can avoid legal headaches and wor-
ries by hiring a professional.

Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Lining Up a Home Inspector
When you buy a property at auction or from a bank, you often agree to pur-
chase it “as is.” In these cases, you don’t have the benefit of a home inspec-
tion before you lay your money down. When you’re buying pre-auction
properties from distressed homeowners, however, the purchase agreement
should state that the transaction is conditional upon the home passing
inspection.
By lining up an inspector or team of inspectors ahead of time, you’re less
likely to pick a sub-standard inspector later in a rush to get the home
inspected.
In the area where I buy most of my investment properties, city inspectors are
available to inspect homes prior to purchase. I prefer using city inspectors,
because they tend to be more thorough and they’re well-versed on local
building codes. The city inspectors in our area show up as a team that typi-
cally includes a plumber, an electrician, a heating and air-conditioning spe-
cialist, a builder, and someone who specializes in zoning. You get a thorough
inspection and a complete write-up for about the same price you’d pay a pri-
vate inspector. However, not all towns and cities offer inspections or they
offer them only for new homes.
If you decide to hire an inspector, you can crack open the Yellow Pages and
find listings for dozens of home inspectors in just about any area of the coun-
try. Finding a qualified home inspector, however, is a challenge. Begin by
asking your real estate agent or other real estate professionals you know for
references. Another good resource is the NACHI (the National Association of
Certified Home Inspectors) Web site at www.nachi.org. To track down city
inspectors, call your town hall and ask for the building or building code
enforcement department. Some counties publish a free county guide that
includes all the contact information for city and township offices in the
county. You may also be able to access the information on your county’s or
town’s Web site. 
When you have a few leads, contact your candidates and ask them the follow-
ing questions:
 Are you certified, licensed, and insured? Certification and licensing
ensure that the inspector has the basic qualifications for the job.
Insurance may cover any serious defects the inspector overlooks or only
the cost of the inspection, depending on state laws. 
 How long have you been a home inspector? Length of service is often,
but not always, a good indication of experience and expertise.
63
Chapter 4: Building a Powerful Foreclosure Investment Team

 How many homes have you inspected? “One or two,” isn’t the answer
you’re looking for. A busy home inspector is usually busy because
he’s good.
 What did you do before becoming a home inspector? Someone who’s a
retired carpenter or home builder is typically a good candidate.
 Do you have references I can call? If the inspector has a good track
record, people don’t hesitate to provide positive references.
 Do you recommend repairs or simply identify problems? Look for an
inspector who can recommend repairs and renovations and provide
rough estimates for the work.
A homeowner who’s selling a property at a clearance price often does so to
avoid the costs and headaches of making repairs. Nitpicking can ruin your
chances of acquiring a great piece of property. Choose an inspector who
focuses more on big-ticket items than on minor defects.
Don’t hire your inspector as your contractor — such a move only tempts
your inspector/contractor to find more problems with the property.
Contacting Contractors 
and Subcontractors
When homeowners are facing foreclosure, they don’t have a whole lot of
money in the cookie jar to maintain their home. In some cases, the homeown-
ers trash the place and even gut the house as a final act of retribution. You
usually end up with a property that requires a moderate to major overhaul.
You can do as much of the fixing up as you’re qualified, comfortable, and 
willing to do. For everything else, hire professionals — contractors, subcon-
tractors, or handymen.
 A contractor (or general contractor) is the boss. He or she manages the
budget and workflow, hires subcontractors, coordinates the work from
start to finish, and hands you the bill.
 Subcontractors perform specific tasks, such as wiring, plumbing,
installing ductwork, replacing roofs, laying carpet and so on.
 Handymen are skilled, jack-of-all-trade laborers who handle general
repairs, landscaping, and minor renovations.
In the following sections, I explain the duties of a general contractor and
methods for finding and hiring contractors, subcontractors, and handymen. 
64
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Hiring a general contractor — or not
On isolated jobs — jobs that require only one or two subcontractors — you
can often do the contracting yourself, just as if you were having your washer
or dryer repaired. For more extensive projects that require the coordination
of multiple subcontractors, a general contractor may be better suited. 
To me, a general contractor represents additional overhead I shouldn’t need
to pay for. By working closely with the subcontractors to coordinate the
work, you should be able to handle the general contracting yourself, but if
you have any doubts about your own abilities in managing the project, hire a
qualified contractor. You should also consider using general contractors if
you’re working on more than a couple projects. You have enough to do just
managing your portfolio.
If you choose to do the general contracting yourself, you assume the follow-
ing responsibilities:
 Budgeting
 Hiring
 Scheduling
 Supervising
 Firing
 Negotiating costs
When acting as contractor, obtain a permit before starting work on any pro-
ject that requires a permit, such as a room addition, a deck, a garage, or even
a fence. If you don’t obtain a required permit and something bad happens,
you may ultimately be responsible, even after you sell the property. You can
usually pick up an application for a building permit at the office of the munici-
pality in which the property is located. Call town hall and find out the office
you need to visit, or consult your handy-dandy county guidebook (if you
have one).
If you decide to hire a general contractor to manage a big project, such as a
room addition, kitchen or bathroom overhaul, or adding a second story onto
a house, provide a detailed description of the work you want done and let the
contractor know that you’re going to hold him to his estimate. Some contrac-
tors are notorious for presenting low estimates and then performing addi-
tional work to jack up the cost. Contractors want repeat business, so let them
know that if you have any problems, you won’t be calling them back. Have
this conversation before the work begins and before you award the contract
to them, so you can remind them of that conversation if any issues crop up.
65
Chapter 4: Building a Powerful Foreclosure Investment Team

Tracking down top-notch contractors 
and subcontractors
Ask other homeowners and real estate professionals to recommend the con-
tractors and subcontractors they’ve used. A good place to start is with your
real estate agent. Agents typically have a computer packed with references
for affordable, honest contractors who do high-quality work because agents
often need to call in a contractor to whip a home into shape before placing
it on the market. Your local hardware store may also be a good source for rec-
ommendations. Don’t rely on ads in your local newspaper, on the grocery
store bulletin board, or in the phone book.
To lessen the risks of getting ripped off, do your due diligence: Check refer-
ences, workmanship, the amount of time the contractor has been in business;
ask the contractor if he’s licensed and insured; and check with the state or
your local Better Business Bureau to see if anyone has filed a recent com-
plaint against the contractor.
Contracting with contractors 
and subcontractors
When you’re hiring a contractor or subcontractor, you have three goals. You
want the job completed to your satisfaction, on budget, and on schedule. 
When you get the contractor’s estimate and proposal, attach a one-page
agreement to it that includes the following:
 Start and end date.
 A $50 penalty for every day that the project runs over schedule. If 
the contractor’s proposal indicates that the work can be completed in 
30 days, you may add a clause that states that if the work is not com-
pleted in 45 days, $50 per day will be deducted from the final cost. 
 A condition that the contractor must notify you before performing any
additional work that’s not stipulated in the original proposal. Contractors
who have been in business for awhile know pretty darn close to how
much a job is going to cost. By steering clear of any changes or upgrades,
you should be able to remain within budget. 
Your job’s not over after you sign the agreement. Remain vigilant to keep the
project on schedule and within budget:
66
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

 Let your contractors know when the For Sale sign is going up.
 Give them what they need to succeed, including deposits and supplies.
 Have them furnish you with receipts of their purchases.
 Show up unannounced at the worksite to see whether they’re working.
 If the workers are doing a good job, tell them so, and do it often.
 Don’t strive for perfection, but don’t overlook shoddy work just to keep
the peace either. You’re paying for a job done well, not just a job done.
Whenever you have to rely on someone else to do work for you, you take
some risk. To limit your exposure to risk with contractors, take the following
precautions:
 When hiring a contractor or subcontractor, make sure that the person is
insured against both property damage and personal injury. An average
hospital bill can wipe out your profit.
 Be careful about deposits, especially when you’re dealing with a contrac-
tor you don’t know. Contractors have been known to take the deposit
and disappear. A 25–50 percent deposit is normal — generally, the
smaller the contractor the larger the deposit. You can pay most handy-
men on a week-to-week basis.
 Be careful handing huge chunks of money to a contractor. If the contrac-
tor needs a costly supply of materials to get started, consider paying the
supplier directly.
Pay your contractors as soon as they complete their work to your satisfac-
tion. My father was a builder, and my brother Jeff, who’s now my property
manager, worked very closely with him. Jeff has a pay-as-they-go policy —
pay your contractors as they’re pulling out of the driveway. This is one of the
best ways to show your appreciation for a job well done.
67
Chapter 4: Building a Powerful Foreclosure Investment Team
My contractor went AWOL!
You can reduce your risks of losing money to a
contractor, but you can’t eliminate those risks. 
I had a great contractor for a long time. After
hiring him to rehab dozens of houses, I gave him
a $3,500 dollar deposit on a Thursday, for a roof-
ing job he promised to complete by the following
Tuesday. 
The contractor failed to mention that he had
planned a weekend trip to Las Vegas. When he
returned, the deposit was gone — gambled
away in Lost Vegas. What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas must be true, because my money
stayed in Vegas, along with the reputation of my
contractor. I lost a good contractor, and he lost
a good account. He wanted to do business with
me again but I just couldn’t allow it.

Finding a handyman and other helpers
You don’t necessarily need a licensed subcontractor to do odd jobs around
the house. A handyman (someone who’s handy with power tools and hand
tools) can often complete small jobs for a fraction of the cost. If the house
needs all new wiring or plumbing or has structural damage, pay a little extra
for a licensed expert. For smaller jobs, such as leaky faucets, clogged drains,
replacement windows, and new doors, a good handyman is a more affordable
choice.
Insuring your helping hands
Your contractor should supply you with a separate proof of insurance form,
attached to the bid that verifies that the contractor and his workers are
insured for this particular job. If you’re hiring a subcontractor or handyman
who’s moonlighting from his day job, he may be covered under his com-
pany’s insurance policy, but he may not be covered during his stint as a
moonlighter.
When hiring a contractor or handyman who can’t provide you with proof of
insurance, contact your insurance company and take out a separate work-
man’s comp policy (or add coverage to your current policy on the house
you’re renovating) that covers anyone who’s working on your house. Added
insurance takes a little extra time and costs a few hundred dollars, but if
you’re not covered and a worker is injured on the job, he may sue you and
you may lose your entire profit and even some of your own personal savings. 
Selling Your Property for Top Dollar
through a Seller’s Agent
If you plan on selling the properties you buy, a top seller’s agent can assist
you in marketing the property and selling it quickly and for top dollar. I
strongly encourage you to enlist the aid of an agent in selling your investment
properties. What you pay in commissions, you usually earn back with inter-
est, because a great agent can sell the property for more money in signifi-
cantly less time than you can on your own.
In the following sections, I explain the beneficial services that agents can pro-
vide and offer guidance on finding the best agent for your flipping needs.
68
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Recognizing the value of a seller’s agent
A seller’s agent who has plenty of experience working with investors, can
assist you with more than selling the property. A top-selling agent also 
helps you:
 Evaluate the value-add and cost-effectiveness of renovations.
 Locate contractors, subcontractors, and other professionals who have a
good track record.
 Stage your house (make it look pretty) for showings. A properly staged
home, on average, sells in half the time for 7–10 percent more than an
un-staged home.
 Market your rehabbed home to every real estate agent in the neighbor-
hood via the Multiple Listing Service (a listing of homes for sale that
goes out to all the real estate agents in your area).
 Evaluate offers on the rehabbed home and guide you in picking the best
of the bunch.
 Navigate the closing to ensure smooth sailing.
 Advise you on how much rent you can charge for a property if you want
to hold onto it for awhile and you need some cash flow.
On average, you take twice as long selling a property yourself than you do
when you work with a real estate agent, and every day your home sits on the
market costs you money.
69
Chapter 4: Building a Powerful Foreclosure Investment Team
Seller’s agent versus buyer’s agent
Real estate agents often excel in one area —
buying or selling homes. Buyer’s agents are
better at finding the right homes at the right
price for home buyers. Seller’s agents are more
skilled at selling homes quickly for top dollar. A
good agent may also have access to informa-
tion that can help you find and evaluate proper-
ties in the foreclosure process. Some agents
may even specialize in working with investors.
Others may be experts in property management
and relocations and can help buy-and-hold
investors find tenants for their rental units.
When buying foreclosure properties at an auc-
tion, you don’t need an agent to assist you in
finding the right home for your needs. You need
an agent who can sell the property quickly for a
price that’s in line or slightly higher than the
going price in your market.
When you’re head hunting for an agent to work
with, ask her what she excels in and then ask
around to make sure you’re getting one of the
top seller’s agents in your area.

Picking an agent with the right stuff
Any licensed real estate agent can sell your house for you, but you want
someone whose experience and training are rooted in sales. A top agent 
typically has the following credentials:
 Five or more years experience
 GRI (Graduate Realtor Institute) certification
 CRS (Certified Residential Specialist) certification
 Realtor status (not simply a real estate agent)
 A consistent top-5-percent performance in the marketplace
 Assisted by a clerical staff
 Well-connected with other agents
 Works for a real estate company that has a Web site
 Maintains a personal Web site or a blog
 Closely involved with the community (the more the agent’s involved, 
the more committed she is to doing a good job)
70
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 
Real estate agent or Realtor: 
What’s the difference?
A real estate agent is anyone who has a state
license to negotiate the sale or purchase of a
property and works for a real estate broker or
brokerage company. A Realtor is a real estate
agent who’s also a member of The National
Association of Realtors. The U.S. has more than
2 million real estate agents, but only 1.2 million
are Realtors.
Because the qualifications for obtaining a 
real estate license vary from state to state, the
quality of real estate agents varies much more
than the quality of Realtors. The National
Association of Realtors requires its members to
complete additional training and testing to
improve their knowledge and abilities and
encourages members to follow a strict code of
ethics. The association also provides its mem-
bers with additional resources and tools to
assist in finding and marketing properties effec-
tively. Being a Realtor costs more, so when you
hire Realtors, you know you’re getting people
who’ve made an investment in themselves.
Of course this association membership doesn’t
mean that a particular Realtor is more qualified
than a given real estate agent, but the odds are
pretty good that you receive superior advice
and service from a Realtor. To find a bona fide
Realtor, look for the Realtor logo on business
cards and stationery. Almost all Realtors make a
point of proudly displaying this logo. You also
can find a Realtor in your area by checking out
www.realtor.com.

For assistance in finding a qualified real estate agent who can work with you
to track down pre-foreclosure or foreclosure properties, visit www.Hurry
Home.com. You can sign up for access to insider information and unlisted
properties, and the service can put you in touch with a qualified real estate
agent who specializes in the types of properties that fit your investment
strategy. Also check out www.GuthyRenkerHome.com, where you can also
find some excellent articles on real estate topics.
Another way to find an agent is through referrals from other homeowners
(buyers and sellers), other investors, or your real estate attorney or title
company. When you have a list of 10 to 15 names, start calling around and
interviewing candidates to compare their experience, education, and certifi-
cation as described in the preceding list.
The size of the real estate company doesn’t matter. Whether the agent is 
with a large franchise, a regional company, or an independent office makes no
difference. Interview several agents. If their qualifications seem about equal,
pick the person that you’re most comfortable working with.
Many books on real estate investing recommend that you try to convince the
agent to accept a lower percentage in commissions or a flat fee for helping
you buy or sell a property, but this can backfire. I suggest that you find the
best agent and then pay the agent the going rate or a little more. When you
pay less, your agent is going to work harder for the clients that are paying
more, and no card carrying capitalist can blame them.
Assessing the Pros and 
Cons of Partnerships
Taking on a partner is like getting married, so if you don’t trust a person as
much as you trust your spouse, you probably shouldn’t become partners.
Great partnerships are rare, but when they work they enable both parties to
achieve more than they could achieve individually. All too often, however, a
partner runs off with the cash, fails to pay the contractors, cashes checks
made out to the water company or building supply store and pockets the
money, files an insurance claim to collect for damages without your knowl-
edge, or figures out some other way to pick your pocket.
If you’re considering partnering up with someone, think about having the
person work for you for a fee. That removes one possible area of conflict, and
if the relationship doesn’t work out, you’re only out the money you paid the
person up to this point.
71
Chapter 4: Building a Powerful Foreclosure Investment Team

Thriving partnerships always require constant attention and nurturing. To
establish a productive partnership, take these seven steps:
1. Pick energetic, talent, and determined partners whose personalities
and talents complement yours. 
2. Address financial concerns up front. Don’t partner with someone who
has little or no income, a poor credit rating, lousy cash flow, or is in a
precarious financial position. Each of you should fully disclose up front
your financial situation and how the money is to be handled.
3. Build a common vision with shared goals. You both need to be on the
same page.
4. Communicate, communicate, communicate. Communications should
be frequent, open, and honest.
5. Promise only what you can deliver, and then deliver on those
promises. This builds trust.
6. Share decisions, work, and rewards equally.
7. Be prepared to compromise. “My way or the highway” doesn’t always
work. Try on your partner’s ideas and approach every once in awhile to
see how it works.
If you partner with someone, have your attorney write up a contract that
details the responsibilities of each party and how profits are to be divided. A
partnership that’s based only on a handshake often ends up in a bitter battle.

Filling Your Foreclosure Tank 
with Financial Fuel
In This Chapter
 Calculating the amount of cash you need
 Sampling your financing options
 Using your investment property as collateral
 Exploring conventional loans
 Comparing the cost of two or more loans
W
hen the average homeowners purchase a home, they typically finance
their purchase with a conventional loan, but in the land of foreclosure
investing, cash is king. Cash gives you a competitive edge over other
investors who have to wait around for loan approvals, appraisals, and other
delays that can quickly sink a deal. With cash in hand, you can offer dis-
tressed homeowners immediate solutions, scoop up properties at auctions,
and get the best deals on REO properties.
In this chapter, I show you how to estimate how much cash you need and
assess a variety of conventional and creative financing options.
When I say that you need cash to invest in foreclosures, I don’t mean that all
the cash must be your own. You can borrow the money, but you need to
borrow it in a way that makes the cash readily accessible. Ready cash
enables you to wrap up a transaction quickly.

Estimating Your Cash Needs
The standard way of buying a house is to figure out how much house you can
afford, get pre-qualified for a loan, and then start shopping for homes in your
price range. You don’t need cash. You simply need enough income coming in
every month to cover the loan payments.
When buying foreclosure properties, the process is reversed by the need for
cash. First, you gather the cash you need, and then you go shopping. So the
first step is to figure out how much cash you really need.
Pick a price range that’s comfortable for you. Are you planning on buying
homes in the $50,000, $100,000, $200,000, $500,000, or $1,000,000 range?
Choosing a price range in a particular neighborhood benefits you in two
ways. It enables you to more accurately estimate your cash needs and evalu-
ate the worth of comparable properties in that price range. 
When picking a price range, stay in your comfort zone. Sure, you stand to
earn a higher profit with pricier properties (a 20 percent profit on a million
dollar home is $200,000, whereas it’s only $20,000 on a $100,000 home), but a
10 percent loss on a million dollar home is $100,000, whereas it’s only $10,000
on a $100,000 home. In addition, repairs, holding costs, and other expenses
are exponentially higher for million dollar homes. When you’re first starting
out, make your expensive mistakes with smaller amounts of money.
To calculate a ballpark figure for the amount of cash you need to buy, hold,
and renovate a property, account for the following costs:
 Purchase price of the property.
 Loan costs — upfront costs for securing a loan, such as loan origination
fees or points.
 Monthly holding costs (loan payments, insurance, property taxes, utili-
ties) multiplied by the number of months you plan on owning the house.
You’re better off calculating your holding costs, but holding costs gener-
ally run about 10 percent of the purchase price for the duration of the
project.
 Repair and renovation expenses typically hover around 10 percent of the
purchase price.
 Add another 10 percent or so for marketing and selling the property.
 Miscellaneous costs, including title insurance and closing costs at time
of purchase.
Here’s a miniform you can use to calculate a rough estimate of the amount of
cash you need:

After you determine a rough estimate of the amount of money required to
buy, hold, and sell a foreclosure property, you’re ready to evaluate your
financing options and then start shaking the bushes for the financing you
need to fuel your investment.
Finding a Cash Stash: Knowing 
Your Financing Options
People often talk themselves out of buying a house or investing in real estate,
falsely believing that they “can’t afford it.” The truth is that money is readily
available. You just need to know where to look for it, and the first place to
look is a mortgage broker. In Chapter 4, I show you how to find a qualified
mortgage broker (or loan officer).
A mortgage broker can quickly assess your situation and your investment
plans and reveal your financing options. These options include the following:
 Hard-money loans: High-interest, short-term loans that are often attrac-
tive to investors who can’t qualify for conventional loans. For more
about hard-money loans, check out “Borrowing Against the House You’re
Buying,” later in this chapter.
 Your own money: Cash and savings, equity you’ve built up in your home
(your home’s value minus what you owe on it), and retirement savings.
See “Shaking Your Piggybank: Tapping Your Own Resources,” later in this
chapter, for details.
 Personal loans: Cash from family members or friends who are either
willing to help you or wanting to invest money without having to do all
the work.
75
Chapter 5: Filling Your Foreclosure Tank with Financial Fuel

 Conventional loans: Money you qualify to borrow from a bank or other
conventional lending institutions based on your income, net worth (the
value of what you own minus the value of what you owe), and credit his-
tory. To find out more about conventional loans, check out “Financing
Your Venture with Conventional Loans,” later in this chapter.
 Government loans: If you’re buying properties from government-
sponsored programs, you may qualify for government loans, even as
an investor. See Chapter 13 for details.
 Credit card loans: Some investors shore up their investments or pay for
renovations using their credit cards. If you can flip the house quickly
and pay off your credit card charges within a few months, this option
isn’t as risky as you may think. I discuss the credit card option later in
this chapter in the section “Maxing out your credit cards.”
Whenever you’re using your own money to finance real estate investments,
you place your personal savings and your home at risk. As much as possible,
choose financing options that expose you to less risks:
 Least risky: Borrowing money against the foreclosure property you’re
buying. If the deal goes belly-up, you stand to lose only that property,
not your own home. See the next section, “Borrowing against the house
you’re buying.” 
 Moderately risky: Refinancing your home or taking out a home equity
loan. By cashing out the equity in your home, you lose one of the best
buffers you have to get you through hard times if you encounter financial
hardship. See “Unlocking the equity in your home,” later in this chapter.
 Real risky: Burying yourself in credit card debt is risky, but it’s often a
viable option if you don’t have the cash on hand to pay for repairs and
renovations. Instead of letting the house just sit there, get the repairs
and renovations completed, even if you have to use your credit card to
pay for them, and then place the house back on the market, sell it, and
pay off your credit card charges. See “Maxing out your credit cards,”
later in this chapter for details.
In the following sections in this chapter, I describe these options in greater
detail, provide tips on how to make yourself a more attractive borrower 
(so you can borrow more money at lower interest rates), and compare the
costs of various loans.
Whey you buy a home to reside in with your spouse, I recommend that you
own the home jointly, but when buying investment properties, only one of you
should sign the mortgage and promissory note (the promise to pay), if possi-
ble. This puts the property you own jointly at less risk. In some states, any real
estate owned by the husband is also owned by the wife, but not vice versa, so
this may not be an option for men . . . sorry fellas. Consult your attorney and
accountant to determine strategies for lowering your exposure to risk.
76
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Borrowing Against the House 
You’re Buying
Lenders always require some collateral to secure the loan — something of
value they can take from you and sell if you happen to default on the loan.
You can use your own house, possessions, and retirement savings as collat-
eral, but that places your current possessions at risk. A safer way to borrow
money is through a hard-money lender who’s willing to accept the investment
property as collateral. You can often locate hard-money lenders through your
mortgage broker.
Hard money is a high-interest, short-term loan that offers three big benefits:
 You get access to cash you may not be able to get through a conven-
tional lender.
 Hard-money lenders often accept the future value of a property as collat-
eral, so you don’t have to borrow against your own home.
 You can often set up a separate escrow account with a hard-money
lender to pay for repairs and renovations.
77
Chapter 5: Filling Your Foreclosure Tank with Financial Fuel
Leveraging the power of 
Other People’s Money (OPM)
One of the secrets to maximizing your invest-
ment profits is to use as little of your own money
and as much of other people’s money as possi-
ble. The magic of using other people’s money is
in the numbers, as the following examples
reveal:
 You invest $100,000 to buy, renovate, and
sell a house for $120,000. You just made a 20
percent profit ($20,000 profit divided by your
investment of $100,000 equals 20 percent).
 You invest $20,000, borrowing the other
$80,000 to buy, renovate, and sell a house
for $120,000. You just made a 100 percent
profit ($20,000 profit divided by your invest-
ment of $20,000 equals 100 percent).
In these examples, although you earn the same
profit in terms of dollar amount, when you look
at percentages, you earn five times more profit
by using other people’s money. You may argue
that you still end up with $20,000 in your pocket
either way. But say you have $100,000 to invest,
as in the first example. Instead of buying one
property using $100,000, you could divvy it up
into $20,000 chunks to buy five $100,000 proper-
ties (borrowing $80,000 for each). When you
sold the properties, you’d earn $20,000 each for
a total profit of $100,000!
Borrowing money is always risky, but you have
to take some risk. Throughout this book, I show
you ways to reduce the risk, but unforeseen
events can undermine the best-laid plans. As a
real estate investor, you need to decide for
yourself if the potential benefits outweigh the
risks.

Now for the bad news. Hard money is called “hard” for several reasons.
Before choosing the hard-money option, be aware of the following key areas
of hard-money loans.
 Points or discount points: You can expect to pay anywhere from 
2–6 points for the loan up front. A point is 1 percent of the loan amount,
so if you’re paying 6 points on a $200,000 loan, you’re paying $12,000 up
front to get your hands on the money.
 Interest rates: Hard-money lenders often charge nearly double the inter-
est rates of conventional loans. If the going interest rate for conventional
loans is 6.5 percent, for example, a hard-money lender may charge 
10–15 percent.
 Loan-to-value (LTV): Hard-money lenders typically approve you for a
loan of only 50—70 percent of the expected sales price of the property,
so you need to be sure that you’re buying the property for 30 percent or
more below what you expect to sell it for, and you may need additional
funds to cover holding and renovation costs. When buying into a declin-
ing market, LTV becomes even more critical, because your loan amount
stays the same while housing values are declining. If the value of the
house dips below what you owe on it, you place yourself in a situation of
owing more on a property than what you can sell it for.
 Amortization: Hard-money lenders often want to amortize the loan over
5–15 years instead of the standard 30 years, which ends up increasing
your monthly payments, because you’re paying down the principle on
the loan faster. 
To lower the monthly payments, amortize over 30 years or negotiate for
interest-only payments. You want to have enough free-flowing cash to
finance renovations and cover your holding costs.
 Balloon payment: Hard money typically has balloon payments or cash
calls after so many months, or you may be required to pay off the loan in
full in a matter of 6—36 months. This isn’t a problem as long as you have
a solid plan in place and sufficient funds on hand for when the balloon
payment is due.
 Prepayment penalties: Avoid any loans that stipulate a prepayment
penalty — extra money you have to pay if you choose to pay off the loan
early. I’ve seen investors lose thousands of dollars when they sold a
house because they agreed to pay a 2–3 percent prepayment penalty.
 Closing costs: As with any lender, you have to close on a loan from a
hard-money lender. Figure in the cost of the title insurance, closing fee,
credit report, and appraisal survey. Be particularly careful of any dis-
count points or loan origination fees — these are areas where the lender
and mortgage broker can really jack up the cost of the loan. 
78
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

 Cross-collateralization: If you’re investing in two or more properties, the
hard-money lender may want to cross-collateralize the properties. If you
sell one property for a $10,000 profit, for example, the lender may want to
use the profit to pay down the loan on the other property. This isn’t ter-
rible and may even benefit you by reducing your interest on the second
loan, but it’s something you should be aware of. Cross-collateralization
simply secures the lender’s position.
Some hard-money lenders offer something called a bullet loan, in which you
make no monthly payments. Interest accrues and is rolled back into the
loan’s principal, which increases the total amount required to pay off the loan
and can significantly increase the total amount of interest you end up paying.
However, a bullet loan frees up your cash flow, so you have more money on
hand for renovations and other investment properties. 
Don’t borrow money from a hard-money lender and give her a deed in advance
in case you do not perform. This takes away some of your rights. Hard-money
lenders are normally not licensed to provide loans. They purchase loans
through others. If you default on the loan, they won’t send Guido to break your
legs. They just repossess the rehabbed property you put up as collateral. 
Shaking Your Piggybank: Tapping 
Your Own Resources
You may be one of the few fortunate investors who has enough cash in your
piggybank to fuel your investments. The total cash in your piggybank may be
a little difficult to see and to calculate at first. If the cash is readily available —
just sitting in your bank account — that’s easy, but you may have less readily
available cash locked up in your house, other investments, or retirement
accounts.
79
Chapter 5: Filling Your Foreclosure Tank with Financial Fuel
Putting the cost of hard money in perspective
Hard-money loans may be the most costly, but
don’t worry so much about what the hard-
money lender is charging and how much profit
he’s earning. Calculate the cost of the loan into
your investment, just as you calculate in repair
and renovation costs. 
If you calculate in all your costs and can still
make a 20 percent or higher return, who cares
what the other guy is making? See “Comparison
Shopping for Low-Cost Loans,” near the end of
this chapter for instructions on how to calculate
the total cost of a loan over the life of the loan.

In the following sections, I explore the pros and cons of using your own
money to finance your investments, and then I assist you in identifying
sources of cash that may be locked up in other assets.
When you first start investing in foreclosures, keep your day job. A steady
income enables you to qualify for loans and keeps you afloat in the event that
your investments prove to be less profitable than expected.
Examining the pros and cons 
of using your own money
If you’re single or you and your significant other are on the same page about
this foreclosure investing thing, cracking into your nest egg to finance your
investments may be the quickest way to get your fingers on some investment
capital. Be aware, however, of the potential benefits and drawbacks of using
your own money:
 Tapping your cash reserves places you at greater financial risk, because
if anything goes wrong — you get laid off or fired, become too ill to work,
or encounter unexpected expenses — you may have less reserves to
keep you afloat. Using your own money, however, also reduces your risk,
because you’re not signing some promissory note agreeing to pay back a
loan by a specific date.
 Limiting your investment capital to the amount of cash you have on
hand saps your purchasing power — you have to buy houses in a lower
price range and may not have sufficient cash to properly renovate the
property. 
A great way to ruin a relationship is to bet the farm on big profits without the
knowledge and complete agreement of your spouse or significant other. If
your investment doesn’t pan out, and even if it does, your spouse may take
offense at not being consulted.
Totaling your sources of investment capital
You may have more money than you realize, especially if you own your own
home and have done a good job of managing debt. In the following sections, 
I reveal several sources of personal investment capital that may provide you
with a solid chunk of the cash you need.
80
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Counting your money in savings
The most obvious source of cash is sitting in your bank accounts — savings
and checking. Tally up your personal savings and see how much money you
have on hand.
Wiping out your savings and checking accounts is never a good idea. If you
don’t have enough in savings to cover the next three months’ worth of bills,
seek investment capital elsewhere. Keep a sufficient cash reserve on hand
just in case you experience a financial setback. 
Unlocking the equity in your home
Your home is not only a place to live. It may also be a cash cow, especially if
you’ve been paying down the mortgage principle for several years and the
value of your home has appreciated significantly during the time you’ve
owned it. You can unlock the equity in your home. Equity is a measure of your
home’s currently appraised value minus the amount you owe on the home. If
your home appraises for $200,000, for example, and you owe $125,000 on it,
you have $75,000 in equity.
You can unlock the equity in your home in one or both of the following ways:
 Refinance the mortgage: Take out a new mortgage on the home for the
amount of its currently appraised value and pay off the old mortgage.
(You can refinance for less than the appraised value to cash out only a
portion of your equity.)
 Take out a home equity loan or line of credit: A home equity loan, 
separate from the mortgage, enables you to take out a loan up to the
amount of equity in the home. With a home equity line of credit, you
have an account from which you can draw money at any time. You pay
interest on only the money you draw from that account.
See “Financing Your Venture with Conventional Loans,” later in this chapter
for tips on finding the lowest-cost loans available. 
Maxing out your credit cards
Maxing out your credit cards to purchase a car, clothes, electronics, gro-
ceries, and other items that provide no return on your “investment” is never
a good idea. Using your credit cards to purchase investment properties that
offer a solid, relatively quick return on your investment, however, can be a
savvy financial move. Following are some tips to maximize the use of credit
card debt when investing in real estate:
81
Chapter 5: Filling Your Foreclosure Tank with Financial Fuel

 Shop for credit cards with the lowest interest rates. Don’t look at the
low introductory rates; read the fine print to find the rate after the intro-
ductory period expires.
 Check your credit card statements to determine your current limits.
Depending on your credit history and the credit card company, you may
have a credit limit in excess of $10,000 per card.
 Pay off your charges as quickly as possible. Paying off your credit card
debt quickly not only saves you from paying high finance charges, but it
can also raise your credit rating, so you qualify for future loans at lower
interest rates.
Real estate investors rarely use credit card debt to finance a purchase. They
use it more often to finance repairs and renovations, so they can quickly re-
sell the property and pay off their credit card charges in full.
If you can purchase and sell the property quickly and pay off your charges in
a month or two, credit card interest is unlikely to consume a big chunk of
your profit. Years ago, when I first started, when the bank of Grandma was
running low, I would buy houses with credit cards. I even attended a seminar
that recommended accumulating lots of credit cards. I would never suggest
this strategy today. Use a credit card only for emergencies.
Tapping into your retirement savings
More and more investors are choosing to set up self-directed IRAs and other
types of retirement accounts that enable them to invest in real estate rather
than in stocks and bonds. The reasoning behind this is that real estate 
often provides a better and sometimes even more secure return on your
investment. 
With a self-directed IRA, you can buy and sell properties out of your retire-
ment account. Setting up a self-directed IRA, however, is no simple matter.
Typically, a trust company manages the money and properties in the
account, and all profits and losses from your investments must stay in that
account. Withdrawing money from the account results in the same IRS penal-
ties you have to pay if you withdraw money from any type of retirement
account.
Consult your financial advisor and accountant for details about using a self-
directed IRA to finance your foreclosure investments. If a self-directed IRA is
not a viable option, you may be able to borrow money against your retirement
account. Keep in mind, however, that borrowing against your retirement sav-
ings places that savings at risk, as does any other investment.
82
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Planning for contingencies
For every plan you have to buy a foreclosure property, have a plan B. Your
plan B should cover contingencies in the event that the deal doesn’t quite
proceed according to plan A. Your contingency plan should cover the follow-
ing unexpected events:
 Delays: Homeowners can work out a deal with the lender at the last
minute or file for bankruptcy. Courts can add further delays. If your area
has a mandatory redemption period, this can be a huge delay. You may
also have trouble selling the property after you fix it up — do you have
enough money to hold onto the property if it lingers on the market?
 Mistakes: What if you pay too much for a property? What if the market
dips right after you buy the property, so you can’t sell it at a profit? Plan
on making a few costly mistakes, especially when first starting out.
 Cost overruns: Rarely do renovations cost less than you expect.
Undetected defects in the property can increase repair bills. Irate home-
owners can trash the property and steal the kitchen sink and cabinets
on their way out the door. Contractors may overcharge you. Do you
have enough money to cover unexpected expenses?
To protect yourself against unexpected expenses and scheduling delays, take
the following precautions:
 Buy properties for at least 25 percent less than you know you can sell them
for. If you make a mistake, a 25 percent buffer can usually bail you out.
 Don’t get in over your head. Assume that your total investment is going
to be at least 20 percent more than you anticipate, and have access to
enough cash to cover that additional 20 percent.
Hope for the best, but plan for the worst. Without an effective contingency
plan in place and a sufficient financial buffer, you may end up in foreclosure.
Financing Your Venture 
with Conventional Loans
To get a conventional loan, you hand your bank or mortgage broker your
financial records, including pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements, and doc-
uments showing how much you own and owe, and your bank or mortgage
broker does a little extra research to determine how much you qualify to
borrow.
83
Chapter 5: Filling Your Foreclosure Tank with Financial Fuel

In the following sections, I show you how to make yourself an attractive bor-
rower, so you can borrow more money at lower interest rates, and how to
gather the paperwork you need to apply for a loan.
Although I’m a big proponent of financing investments with other people’s
money, always treat that money as if it were your own money, and don’t get
addicted to it. I’ve seen business owners use other people’s money to finance
drug habits, personal purchases, and other indulgences, and it always turns
out bad. Show respect for the right to borrow other people’s money by
choosing smart investments and paying back those loans on time.
Making yourself look good on paper
Real estate investors with proven track records have no problems finding
lenders eager to loan them money. Until you achieve platinum status, how-
ever, you’d better look good on paper. You need to demonstrate that you
have a solid income from your day job, money in the bank, investments, or
assets that you can sell. You need proof that you pay your bills on time. And
you need to show that you’re not so heavily burdened by debt that one more
loan is likely to push you into bankruptcy.
The following sections take a snapshot of your financial picture and highlight
the details that lenders commonly consider before approving a loan. By iden-
tifying areas of improvement, you can hammer out the dents to make yourself
look as good as possible to prospective lenders.
Determining what you’re worth in dollars and cents
The first question a lender is going to ask you is “What’s your net worth?” Net
worth is simply whatever money you would have if you sold all your stuff and
then paid off all your debts, including your taxes. Officially, the equation goes
like this:
Net Worth = What You Own–What You Owe
To prove to a lender that you’re a worthy borrower, type up a page that lists
your assets and liabilities and calculates your net worth. Don’t forget about
your personal and household belongings, art collection, model train collec-
tion, jewelry, antiques, and so on. Hopefully, the result is a positive number.
A strong net worth can help you borrow money at competitive interest rates,
but you can still borrow money with a low or even a negative net worth. If
you have a solid investment strategy and the energy and commitment to
implement it, you can secure the capital you need to get started. You simply
may have to settle for a hard-money loan, as explained earlier in the section,
“Borrowing Against the House You’re Buying.”
84
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Obtaining your credit report
Your bank or mortgage broker is going to inspect your credit history before
approving a loan, so you should know ahead of time what that credit history
says about you. Check your credit report every three months or so, correct
any errors, and take steps to improve your credit rating. No irregularity is too
small to correct. 
You can obtain your credit report through any of the following three credit
reporting services, but because lenders may report to only one service, 
ideally, you should check all three:
 Equifax: (800) 685-1111 or online at www.equifax.com.
 Experian: (888) 397-3742 or online at www.experian.com.
 TransUnion: (800) 916-8800 or online at www.transunion.com.
For the complete picture of your credit history, request a tri-merge report that
compiles information from all three credit reporting agencies. Some creditors
don’t report to all three agencies, but when lenders check your credit history,
they’re probably going to look at everything, so you should, too.
Read on for details about obtaining, inspecting, and correcting your credit
report. 
As of September 1, 2005, the Federal Trade Commission has made it manda-
tory for the three major credit-reporting companies to provide you with a
free credit report once every 12 months. To obtain your free credit report, 
do one of the following:
 Submit your request online at www.annualcreditreport.com.
 Phone in your request by calling toll-free 877-322-8228.
 Download the Annual Credit Report Request Form from www.annual
creditreport.com/cra/requestformfinal.pdf, fill it out, and
mail it to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281,
Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.
Examining your credit report
When you receive your credit report, inspect it carefully for the following 
red flags:
 Addresses of places you’ve never lived.
 Aliases you’ve never used, which may indicate that someone else is
using your social security number or the credit-reporting agency has
mixed someone else’s data into yours.
85
Chapter 5: Filling Your Foreclosure Tank with Financial Fuel

 Multiple social security numbers, flagging the possibility that informa-
tion for someone with the same name has made it into your credit
report.
 Wrong date of birth (DOB).
 Credit cards you don’t have.
 Loans you haven’t taken out.
 Records of unpaid bills that you either know you paid or have good
reason for not paying.
 Records of delinquent payments that weren’t delinquent or you have a
good excuse for not paying on time.
 Inquiries from companies with whom you’ve never done business.
(When you apply for a loan, the lender typically runs an inquiry on your
credit report, and that shows up on the report.)
An address of a place you’ve never lived or records of accounts, loans, and
credit cards you never had may be a sign that somebody has stolen your
identity. Contact the credit-reporting company immediately and request that
a fraud alert be placed on your credit report. For tips on protecting yourself
against identity theft and recovering from it, check out Preventing Identity
Theft For Dummies by Michael J. Arata, Jr. (Wiley).
Boosting your credit score
Last but certainly not least: Your credit report should contain your credit
score. (If it doesn’t, contact the credit-reporting agency and request your
score.) Credit-reporting agencies often assign you a credit score that ranges
roughly between 300 (you never paid a bill in your life) and 900 (you’ve had a
credit card for a long time, borrow small amounts often, always pay your bills
on time, and don’t carry any huge balances). Each credit reporting agency
may use a different scoring method and range of scores, so you can expect
some variation.
Your credit score determines not only whether you qualify for a loan but also
how much you’re qualified to borrow and at what interest rate. A high credit
score lets you borrow more money at a lower interest rate. 
A credit score of 700 or higher is superb. Anything below about 680 raises red
flags. If your credit rating dips below 700, take steps to improve it, such as
the following:
 Dispute any erroneous items on your credit report. Most credit-reporting
agencies supply you with an address to submit a letter of dispute.
 Apply for fewer loans and credit cards. Applying for several loans or
credit cards in a short period of time can make you appear financially
desperate and significantly lower your credit rating.
86
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

 Pay off your credit card balances or at least pay off enough so the bal-
ance is 50 percent or below your available credit limit. If you have suffi-
cient equity built up in your home, you can refinance or take out a home
equity loan to pay down your credit card debt.
For additional tips on boosting your credit score, check out Credit Repair Kit
For Dummies by Stephen R. Bucci and Terry Savage (Wiley).
Gathering the paperwork 
and records you need
Prepare in advance for your meeting with your bank or mortgage broker. Call
and ask for a list of documents and records they need, and make copies to
bring with you to your first meeting. Most banks and mortgage brokers typi-
cally require the following documents:
 Two or three recent pay stubs showing your income
 Your two most recent federal income tax returns
 Your two most recent bank statements
 Recent loan statements that show how much you currently owe on your
car, credit cards, or other purchases you’ve had to finance
If your net-worth statement shows that you own much more than you owe,
bring it along, too. Banks and mortgage brokers like to see people who have a
positive net worth, know the importance of net worth, and care enough to
monitor it. 
Comparison Shopping for Low-Cost Loans
Your bank or mortgage broker is likely to lay out a virtual buffet of loan types
from which to choose: fixed-interest, adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), interest-
only, balloon-payment, and others. For details on the benefits and drawbacks
of these various types of loans, ask the bank representative or your mortgage
broker lots of questions.
Don’t get too caught up in the various types of loans. For people who are
buying houses they plan to reside in for 30 years, loan type is a big considera-
tion. For real estate investors who plan on buying and selling the property in
less than a year, the cost of the loan over the life of the loan becomes more
important. To compare loans, take the following steps:
87
Chapter 5: Filling Your Foreclosure Tank with Financial Fuel

1. Start with the amount the bank charges you up front in loan origina-
tion fees, discount points (interest you pay up front, typically a per-
centage of the loan, to lower the interest rate), and other fees.
2. Multiply the monthly payment times the number of months you plan
to pay on the loan.
3. Add the two amounts to determine your total payment.
4. Total the amount of each payment that goes toward paying the princi-
pal of the loan. (Your lender can tell you how much of each payment
goes toward principal.)
5. Subtract the total you determined in Step 4 from the total in Step 3. 
Say that you’re considering two loans, each for $100,000. You plan on using
the loan to buy and renovate a home over two years and then sell it and pay
off the remaining principal on the loan. You have a choice between a 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgage at 6 percent or a 30-year, interest-only loan at 5 percent.
Look at the 6 percent, fixed-rate mortgage first:
Loan origination fee and discount points:
$1,000.00
Plus monthly payment of $599.55 × 24 months:
$14,389.20
Equal total payments:
$15,389.20
Minus total paid toward principal:
$2,531.75
Equal total cost of loan:
$12,857.45
Here are the numbers for the 30-year, interest-only loan at 5 percent:
Loan origination fee and discount points:
$1,000.00
Plus monthly payment of $416.67 × 24 months:
$10,000.08
Equal total payments:
$11,000.08
Minus total paid toward principal:
$0.00
Equal total cost of loan:
$11,000.08
As you can see, even though you’re not paying down the principal on the
interest-only loan, over the life of the loan, you pay about $1,700 less. In addi-
tion, the interest-only loan has much lower monthly payments, freeing up
cash to use for renovations and other investments.
As a general rule for quick flips (buying and selling a property in less than 
six months), opt for loans with low (or no) closing costs, low (or no) discount
points, and low interest rates. Avoid any loans that have early-payment 
penalties.

Networking Your Way 
to Foreclosure Success
In This Chapter
 Generating quality leads through networking
 Making yourself the go-to guy or gal
 Marketing yourself as a foreclosure investor
 Optimizing the storage and retrieval of good contacts
 Taking care of the people who take care of you
A
s a real estate investor, you can’t climb very far up the ladder of success
on your own. You need access to cash, leads on potentially profitable
properties, information about those properties, guidance from more experi-
enced investors, legal and financial advice, referrals to affordable contractors
and handymen, and much more. You need assistance, and the best way to get
that assistance is through networking.
In this chapter, I unveil the power of networking and reveal techniques and
tips that can transform a lone wolf into a well-connected real estate investor.
By mastering the techniques in this chapter, you can reduce your workload
and streamline the process of buying, renovating, and selling foreclosure
properties.
Grasping the Power of Networking
I owe much of my success as a real estate investor to the advice, assistance,
and resources of thousands of people. These individuals generously donate
their time and expertise to provide me with the financing and high-quality
leads I need to succeed at investing in foreclosures and other real estate.
Without the guidance and support of thousands of people, I would never
have experienced the level of success I now enjoy. 

I strongly encourage you to take the same approach when you’re first starting
out and for however long you continue to invest in real estate. In the follow-
ing sections, I reveal the benefits of networking in all aspects of foreclosure
investing.
Today, right now, start building a strong network. Every business day, I make
100 phone calls and send another 150 e-mail messages to keep in touch with
clients, colleagues, distressed homeowners, and a host of others who need
my assistance and who assist me. I’m not saying you need to make 100 calls
per day. Start slowly with 3–5 new contacts a day, and then work your way
up. Every person you contact probably knows about 250 other people, many
of whom may eventually need your help or who can help you. Over a short
period of time, your network begins to grow exponentially and almost effort-
lessly. Think of it this way, if business is slow, turn notworking into network-
ing and you will have more business than you can handle.
Generating leads on profitable 
pre-auction properties
The earlier you step into the foreclosure process, the greater your chances
are of eventually taking possession of a property, and the earliest you can
find out about a foreclosure is through word-of-mouth leads. Distressed
homeowners, knowing that you buy foreclosures and have a reputation for
being fair, may call you out of the blue to buy their property. Maybe someone
you know knows someone who knows someone who’s currently facing a
financial crisis. Or perhaps another investor you know is too busy or doesn’t
have the funds available to follow up on a golden opportunity.
Networking delivers people and property to you, saving you from having to
do the legwork to track down potentially profitable properties. Everyone you
meet is a potential lead generator — attorneys; real estate agents; mortgage
brokers; title company staff; loan officers; contractors . . . even the person
delivering your mail or your pepperoni pizza. Let everyone know that you
can help homeowners who are facing financial crises. You may have secrets,
but what you do and what you want to do shouldn’t be one of them. Tell
everyone what you do!
For details on how to network effectively to find foreclosure properties, skip
ahead to Chapter 7, where I provide a list of the top people to contact for
leads.

Securing your financing
Need money? Maybe all you have to do is ask for it. Securing financing may
not be quite that easy all of the time, but it can be some of the time. If people
who have plenty of money lying around know that you have a proven track
record for making money, they may rather invest in you than bet their money
on stocks and bonds or entrust it to a financial advisor.
Network with the hard-money lenders in your area — local banks, mortgage
companies, and private lenders. You may make these contacts at real estate
investment clubs, while you’re doing your personal banking, through your
mortgage broker, or as you network with other real estate professionals.
When borrowing money from private lenders, be careful not to present the
transaction as something other than a personal loan. If you pitch the deal as
an investment opportunity, the loan may fall under SEC (Security and Exchange
Commission) guidelines for investors. You can borrow money from family
and friends as a personal loan, but if you plan on establishing a relationship
91
Chapter 6: Networking Your Way to Foreclosure Success
Discovering opportunities in divorce
Divorce frequently orphans properties. A couple
splits up, neither the husband nor the wife can
afford the monthly mortgage payments on their
own, and they’re forced to sell their home.
When a divorce attorney gets involved, the
couple has even less money to pay the mort-
gage. In many cases, the wife or husband or
both use the home as collateral to pay their
attorneys out of the proceeds from the property
settlement. The attorney often works unpaid
until the property sells, so the attorney places a
lien on the property to secure payment. Many
divorce attorneys have liens on several proper-
ties, and they don’t get paid until those proper-
ties sell.
You can profit from these situations in two ways.
First, by networking with divorce attorneys, you
may find attorneys with clients seeking to sell
their homes prior to auction. 
Another way to profit is to negotiate a short sale
with the divorce attorney. Say the wife receives
the home as part of the divorce settlement and
starts missing mortgage payments, so the bank
initiates foreclosure proceedings and posts a
foreclosure notice. You’re trying to buy the prop-
erty from the wife, but if you paid what she’s
asking, you wouldn’t profit. The house has a lien
on it for $8,000 from the husband’s attorney,
because the husband used the house as collat-
eral to pay his attorney. You could show the
foreclosure notice to the husband’s attorney,
explain that his $8,000 lien is going to be wiped
out by the foreclosure, and ask if he’d be willing
to take $1,500. That way, the attorney gets
something out of the deal, you save $6,500 on
the purchase, and you can afford to offer the
wife a little more for the house.
Short sales are a great way to turn an unprof-
itable purchase into a profitable one. For more
about short sales, check out Chapter 15.

with the lender as an investor, work through a mortgage broker. Consult 
with your attorney to make sure you’re doing everything correctly and above
board.
Tracking down reliable, affordable 
professionals
Without networking, you’re working in a vacuum whenever you hire an attor-
ney, accountant, agent, title company, inspector, or contractor. Other people
in your area are fishing the same pool, and they’ve already scoped out the
best fishing holes. Don’t waste your time flipping through the phone book for
top-notch professionals. Word-of-mouth referrals are the way to go. 
Real estate agents are in the business of assisting people with all issues
related to buying, owning, and selling homes. They often have a fat address
book that’s packed with valuable contacts for other agents, attorneys, title
companies, home inspectors, accountants, and contractors. They know the
power of networking and are typically more than willing to recommend
people, especially if you tell the people you call who recommended them.
Selling your house for more money 
in less time
When real estate agents place a house on the market, they essentially net-
work to find interested buyers. Sure, they may create full-color flyers and
brochures and plant a For Sale sign on the front lawn, but they connect to
most prospective buyers using a networking tool called the MLS (Multiple
Listing Service). When a seller works through an agent, the agent posts the
listing on one or more MLS. Buyers’ agents can then pull up these listings to
find houses for their clients. The top agents also network with large compa-
nies that have relocation divisions. 
In Chapter 19, I strongly recommend that if you decide to sell your foreclo-
sure property, you work through an agent who has access to all of the multi-
ple listing services in your area. Using the MLS enables you to tap the power
the most powerful networking tool for selling the property quickly and for
top dollar.

You can generate additional interest in your property through your own net-
work. Before you list the property, start talking about it. Inform everyone you
know in the area that you have a property you’re fixing up that promises to
be spectacular. Everyone you tell potentially knows a friend, relative, or col-
league who’s thinking of moving to the area. The person you tell may just be
the one who delivers a buyer right to your front door! Consider creating a
business card specifically for a single house you’re selling and pass it out to
everyone. You can get a box of 1,000 cards very reasonably, and it works. 
Realizing the Importance of Being Good
As the old saying goes, “News travels fast. Bad news travels faster.” You can
take months building a support network, but if you start doing shoddy work,
stealing houses from financially strapped seniors, or transforming neighbor-
hoods into slums, your support network is likely to turn into an angry mob
that would just as soon see you tarred and feathered and run out of town.
Every foreclosure property you buy, renovate, and sell is a reflection of you
and how you do business. Build a strong reputation by treating everyone you
meet fairly and with respect. When you renovate a property, make the house
a home you would be proud to put your name on. Work to improve the hous-
ing in the community where you do business. I usually have more opportuni-
ties to acquire properties than I can reasonably follow up on, so I have to rule
out some prospects. I ask myself, “After I get the place all fixed up, could I
envision myself living here?” If the answer is “No,” I cross it off the list.
Acting with integrity — always
People are generally pretty willing to trust others. Only after they’re disap-
pointed do they form a negative opinion. In short, your good reputation is
yours to lose or improve.
You wouldn’t recommend a restaurant to a friend if the food was bad, the ser-
vice was lousy, and everything on the menu was overpriced. The same is true
in real estate. By building a reputation as a straight shooter who plays by the
rules, you become the person to whom others steer their business. This
doesn’t mean that you have to be kind to the point of giving away all your
profits — it simply means telling the truth, fully disclosing your intentions,
following through on promises, and doing high-quality work.
93
Chapter 6: Networking Your Way to Foreclosure Success

Investing in quality craftsmanship
Homeowners as well as real estate investors often try to boost their bottom
line by hiding defects in a property. Instead of repairing a leaky foundation,
they install wood paneling over the weeping walls and run a humidifier to
take out the “dampness.” Rather than repairing the termite damage in the
floorboards, they lay wall-to-wall carpeting. They try to hide the foul odors
by creating an aromatic cloud of potpourri. 
When repairing and renovating a home, your goal should be to bring the
home up to market standards. I’m not saying that you need to transform a
Quonset hut into the Taj Mahal. If you’re renovating a foreclosure property in
a low-rent district, using builder’s grade materials instead of top-of-the-line
stuff may be sufficient. Hiding defects in a property, however, can come back
to bite you in the seat of your pants. Once the homeowners discover the
defect, they’re liable to come back to you, and if you don’t immediately rec-
tify the situation, you may be dragged into court or worse — they may start
telling all their friends, family, and neighbors that you ripped them off!
For details and tips on how to affordably renovate a home without cutting too
many corners, see Chapter 17.
Building thriving communities
Neighborhoods, especially the most profitable neighborhoods, like to see
investors come in and clean things up. When you transform the neighbor-
hood eyesore into an attractive abode, you not only make the neighbors feel
better about where they live, but you also improve their homes’ values. You
gain your own personal sales force of enthusiastic supporters who spread
the good word about the new house on the block that’s up for sale.
Some investors who are just out for the quick buck buy a property, cash out
the equity, and quickly lose interest in it. Con artists may even use the house
for some illegal flipping scheme, paying an appraiser to inflate the home’s
value, cashing out the inflated equity, and then abandoning the property 
altogether. Don’t join the ranks of these real estate leeches.
Don’t get seduced by quick cash opportunities. In the long run, you stand to
make much more money investing in foreclosures by being sincerely inter-
ested in the neighborhoods you’re investing in. When con artists descend on
a neighborhood like a swarm of locusts and leave it devastated, they earn a
quick profit, but they also earn the loathing of the neighborhood. When you
work to improve a neighborhood, you build a neighborhood that’s ready and
willing to support you.

Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Marketing Yourself
Productive networking requires some proactive efforts on your part, espe-
cially when you’re first starting out. People are often ready, willing, and able
to assist an honest and competent investor if they know that such a person
exists. By marketing yourself, what you have to offer, and what you need to
do your job, you soon discover that your name, face, and reputation are rec-
ognized throughout the neighborhood.
To market yourself effectively, assemble your marketing toolkit, and then get
busy talking, calling, e-mailing, and mailing out notices to let everyone know
what you do, what you offer, and what you need. In the following sections, 
I show you how to effectively market yourself as a foreclosure investor.
Gathering your marketing tools
You don’t need to hire a public relations firm to market you as a foreclosure
investor. All you have to do is gather a few basic tools and get to work. You
probably already have most of the marketing tools you need, as described in
the following sections.
Field research I’ve performed (by attending weddings and funerals) reveals
that every individual knows about 250 other people. When you impress one
person, you have the opportunity to impress at least 250 others. Word of
mouth is the most powerful networking tool.
Designing and printing business cards
Even in this hi-tech age of computers, Web sites, and cell phones, the lowly
business card is your key marketing tool. If you have a computer and a fairly
good printer, you can design your own business card and print it on card
stock that you can pick up at any office supply store in your area. If you don’t
have a computer and printer, head down to the local print shop to have it
produce your cards. Include the following on your cards:
 A cameo shot of yourself, so people know your face.
 Your name and business name, if you have a business.
 Your mailing address. Don’t use a post office box number — it’s too
impersonal, and nobody will trust you. People trust brick-and-mortar
establishments.
 Your phone number. 
95
Chapter 6: Networking Your Way to Foreclosure Success

 Your e-mail address and Web site address, if you have one.
 A statement of what you do — for example, “I Buy Houses for Cash.”
Pass your card out to everybody you meet, and I mean everybody. If you step
into the local burger joint for lunch, hand your card to the server or the
person behind the counter and say, “Hey, I buy houses for cash if you ever
know of anybody . . . .” You’d be amazed at how many people know a home-
owner who’s embroiled in a financial crisis.
Buying yourself a cell phone
Homeowners facing foreclosure are usually in desperate situations, and they
need help yesterday. You want to be the person they can contact in their
hour of need, so if you don’t have a cell phone, buy one now and carry it with
you 24/7. Every missed call is a missed opportunity.
You can usually get by with a single cell phone for both business and per-
sonal use, but if you have to carry a cell phone for work, and your boss is
paying the phone bill, I discourage you from using that cell phone to moon-
light as a foreclosure investor. Unless your boss is okay with it, buy a sepa-
rate cell phone. The same goes for doing research when you’re supposed to
be working and using your boss’s computer to do it. 
Equipping yourself with a computer
Nowadays, a computer is a necessity in all areas of real estate. Before you
venture out into the world of foreclosures, equip yourself with a decent com-
puter, an Internet connection with e-mail, and a printer. Your computer is an
essential tool for performing the following foreclosure investing tasks:
 Researching state and county foreclosure laws and regulations
 Finding and researching foreclosure properties
 Keeping in touch with contacts via e-mail
 Designing and printing your own marketing materials
 Establishing a Web presence for additional leads
 Shopping and applying for loans
 Managing your finances, if you choose to do your own accounting
Creating ads
I recommend against advertising yourself in the local newspaper as a foreclo-
sure investor until you’re well established and have a strong enough financial
base to buy and hold multiple foreclosure properties.
96
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

After you’re well established, however, you can generate additional leads on
pre-auction properties by placing a small add in the classifieds that says
something like, “I Buy Homes for Cash,” followed by your phone number. 
For details about advertising for leads, see Chapter 7.
Starting with your inner circle
The most challenging step in networking is often the first step. You may
simply not know where to start. The best place to begin is with your inner
circle — family, friends, and co-workers. Tell them your plans, brainstorm 
for additional ideas, and try to find out if they know anyone who may be able
to assist you — real estate agents, attorneys, loan officers, bankers, local 
officials, and so on.
Whenever you work with a mortgage broker, title company representative, or
other real estate professional, ask if she knows anyone else who may be able
to help. Take names and phone numbers, even if you don’t need a certain
person’s expertise right now. You may find that the person can offer assis-
tance somewhere down the line.
When networking with your inner circle, avoid the dream killers, especially
family members who don’t believe in you. These confidence busters can
often convince you to give up long before you buy your first foreclosure prop-
erty. Only you know what you’re capable of accomplishing, and often times
you don’t even know until you’ve accomplished your goal.
Start at the top. Referrals tend to work from management to employees
rather than moving in the other direction. If your friend is a car salesman,
he can refer you to his employees, to the porter, to the clerical staff, and 
so forth. 
Keeping in touch . . . a daily chore
When’s the last time you called your best friend from grade school? If it was
more than about a year ago, chances are good that you’ll never touch base
with that person again. The same is true in business, but the time is shorter.
If you lose touch with a valuable contact for more than a month or two, that
person is going to quickly forget you ever existed.
I have a database of more than 6,000 people and growing whom I assist and
who assist me in my various business dealings. Every day, I personally con-
tact nearly 250 people over the phone and by e-mail, which keeps my name
and face in the minds of the people I rely on.
97
Chapter 6: Networking Your Way to Foreclosure Success

Harvey Mackay, motivational speaker and author of Swim with the Sharks,
taught me some of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned about sales. Harvey
said he made sure he knew at least 66 things about every one of his cus-
tomers. This sales tactic applies to networking, as well. Try to find out 
66 things about every person you contact — their birthday, anniversary,
spouse’s name, kids’ names and ages, hobbies, interests, and so on. You don’t
have to find it out all at once — slowly gather details over time. The more
you know about a person, the more you can become genuinely interested in
their lives, and the stronger the bond you can establish with that person.
Managing Contact Information
Don’t rely on memory alone or a purse stuffed with scraps of paper to keep
track of all the people in your network. Use a contact management program
or database to record all the pertinent and not-so-pertinent information
about each individual.
I use Outlook, because it enables me to enter the names, addresses, phone
numbers, and e-mail addresses of everyone I know. Outlook’s robust features
offer several additional benefits:
 Record the person’s birthday, anniversary, and spouse’s name
 Type in additional notes about the person’s family, interests, and 
specialties
 Remind you of important dates and activities, so you can contact the
person on key dates
 E-mail multiple people with a single e-mail message
 Synchronize contact information from your computer to your PDA 
(personal digital assistant), so you can take your contact information 
on the road
For more about using Outlook, check out Outlook 2007 For Dummies by 
Bill Dyszel.
You don’t have to use Outlook. Prior to using Outlook, I used a program
called ACT to manage my contact list. (I still use ACT to track foreclosures.)
The important point here is that you record contact information using a tool
that provides you quick access to that information. You can even use a word
processor, spreadsheet, or database program, a PDA (Personal Digital
Assistant), or a day planner or address book. Figure out a system that works
for you. 
98
Part II: Laying the Groundwork for Maximized Profit and Minimized Risk 

Rewarding Good Deeds and Good Leads 
When you’re asking for guidance, assistance, and good leads, be prepared to
reward the helping hands who assist you. People quickly forget or even
worse, become resentful, when others constantly ask for assistance and
forget to demonstrate their appreciation in some tangible way. To expand
your network, show your appreciation. Here are some suggestions on what
you can do to keep the people in your network happy and reach out to
others: 
 Refer other people to your agent, attorney, mortgage broker, title com-
pany, contractor, handyman, and other professionals who’ve provided
excellent service. Ask for extra cards, carry them with you, and pass
them out. A referral is the highest form of flattery.
 When you contact someone you’ve been referred to, let the person know
who referred you. 
 Treat everyone you encounter — from your real estate attorney to the
person who’s repairing the leaky faucet in the home you just bought —
with sincere respect. If you value others, they value you.
 When someone helps you, show your appreciation by sending them a
quick, handwritten note. People have different needs, but everyone
needs to be thanked.
99
Chapter 6: Networking Your Way to Foreclosure Success
Adding that personal touch
By storing personal information about each indi-
vidual in your contact management program,
you can easily call up specific details about an
individual that you may not recall. 
Before I place a phone call, I pull up the
person’s contact information and review it. It’s
pretty cool when you get Bill on the phone and
you say, “Tell your wife, Debbie, I said, ‘Hi,’” or
you call Bill’s house, Debbie answers, and you
say “Hi, Debbie, this is so-and-so, is Bill avail-
able?” Later, when Bill comes home, Debbie
tells him, “You know, so-and-so called, and he
knows my name. He probably talks to thousands
of people, and he remembers my name.” That
means a lot to most people.
Even though I have a pretty good head for
names and dates, I often forget. When I call Bill,
I usually don’t remember Debbie’s name, but I
look it up before I call. In fact, just before calling
my house, I look up my contact information 
in Outlook, so I remember my wife and kids’
names. Since I have been using Outlook, I have
not made a mistake or missed our anniversary
or my wife’s birthday.
Don’t count on memory alone.

 Keep an ear to the ground for people in your network who need your
assistance. If they’re in trouble, a random act of kindness with no
thought of what you’ll eventually receive in return demonstrates that
you’re genuinely interested in their success.
Give back to the community. Think of networking as a ladder with you stand-
ing on one of the middle rungs. Above you are more experienced people who
can reach down and pull you up. Below are less experienced people you need
to reach down to. You never stop learning, and once you learn, you have the
obligation to teach.

Creating Win-Win
Situations in 
Pre-Foreclosure
(Prior to Auction)

In this part . . .
E
nding up in foreclosure can be an emotionally devas-
tating experience for homeowners, but by guiding
them through the process and honestly, openly laying out
their options to them, you can often help homeowners
while profiting from pre-foreclosure transactions.
The chapters in this part show you how to step into the
foreclosure process at the possible earliest stage to
reduce competition from other investors and provide the
most useful and timely advice to distressed homeowners. 
Here you discover how to locate properties before they
end up on the auction block, gather essential information
about those properties and their owners, and assist home-
owners through the foreclosure process while acquiring
properties well below their market value.

T
he earlier in the foreclosure process you contact distressed homeowners,
the better chance you have of helping them claim some of the equity
they’ve built up in a property while snagging a property that’s worth your
time and effort.
But how do you track down distressed homeowners early in the process? You
can take any of several approaches. My personal favorite is through word-of-
mouth networking, because it often delivers the most timely information. But
you can also discover opportunities by cruising the neighborhood for
unkempt homes or homes that are for sale by owner (FSBO), searching and
advertising for properties online, and perusing the county legal news for fore-
closure notices.
In this chapter, I show you exactly what to do to locate distressed homeowners
prior to auction — before it’s too late in the foreclosure process to assist them. 
In Chapter 8, I show you how to gather the information about the property and
the homeowners that you need to provide the homeowners with the assis-
tance they need, and in Chapter 9, I reveal tips and strategies for personally
contacting the homeowners, so you can discuss their situation and their
options.

104
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 
Networking Your Way to 
Promising Properties
Before the foreclosure notice is posted and the foreclosure becomes public
knowledge, you have only two ways of finding out that the homeowners are
in a jam and need to sell their home in a hurry:
 Word-of-mouth networking: You hear of someone who needs your assis-
tance or a distressed homeowner hears of you.
 Must-sell ads: You notice an ad in the classified section of the local news-
paper that conveys a sense of duress. Look for ads that say “Must Sell”
or “Relocating.” These ads often clue you into the fact that the owners
must sell in a hurry and are possibly in jeopardy of losing their home.
In Chapter 6, I reveal some basic networking strategies to obtain the assis-
tance you need and to get the word out about what you do. In the following
sections, I go into more depth, as I list the people who are often the source of
the best leads on foreclosure properties.
Identifying your personal lead generators
A lead generator is anyone or anything that can steer distressed homeowners
your way or point you in the direction of distressed homeowners. It can be a
banker, real estate broker, loan officer, divorce attorney, the minister of your
church, a casual acquaintance, a classified ad, a Web site, or an Internet bul-
letin board on which you post a notice.
Dealing with an embarrassing situation
When homeowners are in a dire financial situ-
ation, they often go mute, telling nobody, not
even their family or closest friends, what’s going
on. In some cases, they contact a lawyer or tell
the minister at their church or a counselor or
therapist or even a complete stranger. If they
know that you assist homeowners who are
financially strapped, they may tell you. 
If the distressed homeowners remain uncom-
municative, you have no chance of finding out
about the situation until the foreclosure notice
is posted. If they tell someone, your chances of
hearing about it increase in direct proportion to
the number of people who know that you assist
distressed homeowners.
As a professional and someone who’s not inti-
mately involved in the situation, the homeown-
ers may be more willing to talk with you,
especially if you act professionally and have the
confidence that you can assist them with over-
coming their problem.

In the following sections, I list the human lead generators you can often rely
on to identify foreclosure opportunities in your market.
People who know you personally are the best lead generators because they
act as mutual friends, referring and recommending you to homeowners they
know. Keep in mind that when someone refers you to one of her friends or
acquaintances, that referral reflects on the person who gave it. Earn that
person’s trust by treating the homeowners with respect and doing everything
possible to assist them in their time of need.
Creating your A-list
Real estate professionals and attorneys who specialize in certain areas can
feed you some of the most productive leads. These are your A-listers:
 Foreclosure attorneys: Foreclosure attorneys post the foreclosure
notices and handle the liquidation of properties. You should know all the
foreclosure attorneys in your market by name and have their phone
numbers and e-mail addresses at the top of your A-list.
 Real estate attorneys: The real estate attorneys in your area know the
market and the foreclosure rules and regulations and are often in con-
tact with distressed homeowners. In addition to providing you with
leads, real estate attorneys often provide some excellent advice. Pick
their brains for additional information.
 Divorce attorneys: When couples divorce, they often no longer can
afford the house they purchased together. In many cases, the divorce
settlement requires that they sell the house and split the proceeds, and
divorce attorneys often want this to happen as quickly as possible, so
they can get paid.
 Bankruptcy attorneys: Bankruptcy often requires the homeowners to
sell their real estate in order to restructure their debt. Bankruptcy attor-
neys frequently need to work with investors who can close on the deal
in a hurry. Few, if any, of the bankruptcy attorneys I know buy real
estate. They do their thing and would love to have an investor in their
network to purchase properties.
 Probate attorneys: When a homeowner dies, leaving behind a home or
other real estate, the home must be liquidated and the proceeds divided
among the heirs. When settling an estate, probate attorneys often rely
on investors who can pay cash for properties to expedite the process.
 Loan officers: Loan officers specialize in working with people who have
bruised credit and refinancing homeowners out of foreclosure or bank-
ruptcy. In many cases, the loan officer can’t help the homeowners and
needs an investor to step in and purchase the property. By networking
with loan officers, you can become their go-to investor.
 Homeowner associations: Condominium and homeowner associations
are sometimes empowered to foreclose on homeowners who don’t 
105
Chapter 7: Discovering Homeowners Facing Foreclosure

properly maintain their properties or don’t pay their association dues.
When homeowners in the association encounter financial problems, the
association may hear about it before the foreclosure attorney posts a
notice. The association may agree to pass your name and contact infor-
mation along to homeowners who need to explore their options.
You should also network with REO (Real Estate Owned) brokers — real estate
agents who the banks call on to sell the properties they repossess. They may
not be able to provide leads on pre-auction properties, but they can offer
leads to great post-auction opportunities. For more about working with REO
brokers, see Chapter 12. 
Contacting friends, family, and neighbors
When you’re shopping for a car, you ask a dealer or a mechanic for advice.
When you’re in the market for a diamond ring, you ask a jeweler. In the same
way, when you’re looking for foreclosure properties, your best leads often
come from real estate professionals, because they specialize in the housing
market where you invest.
In the case of foreclosures, however, real estate professionals are not your
only lead generators. Family members, friends, and neighbors often know
about homeowners who are having financial problems long before word
reaches the real estate community. Tell family members, friends, and neigh-
bors that you provide assistance to distressed homeowners. If the people
closest to you don’t know that you provide services to help homeowners in
crises, they won’t even think of telling you or referring their friends to you. 
Building on your church affiliations
Churches exist primarily to meet the spiritual needs of their congregations,
but they also function as community centers to assist members with relation-
ships, raising children, and financial matters. Some homeowners feel more
comfortable telling their ministers or other church members about their
financial woes than they are breaking the bad news to their spouses.
I’m not telling you to join a church solely to tap its membership for leads, but
if you already belong to a church or are thinking of joining one, the church
can be an additional lead generator, and you can often assist members when
they don’t know where else to turn for help. 
When an entire area suffers a serious financial blow, such as mass layoffs or a
major employer moving out of the area, consider holding a meeting at the
church to inform homeowners in the congregation of their options and fore-
closure rights. You may do more good than you could ever imagine.
106
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Networking through clubs and other organizations
Do you belong to any clubs in your area — the Rotary Club, Kiwanis, the Elks,
the Moose, the Legion, the Lions Club, the Purple Hatters? If so, don’t forget
to mention to your fellow members that you assist distressed homeowners.
You never know when a fellow member may be facing some financial hard-
ship or knows a homeowner who’s in a financial pickle. By letting others
know what you do, you give them someone they can approach to ask ques-
tions or seek assistance. And don’t forget to hand out your business cards, as
explained in Chapter 6.
Close your eyes and try to picture your spouse, your child, your favorite pet,
or the first President of the United States. Chances are good that you have a
pretty clear image of that person . . . or dog, or cat, or hamster in your mind.
By telling everyone that you assist distressed homeowners and buy proper-
ties, you begin to create an image in their minds that you’re the go-to guy or
gal whenever they or someone they know is about to lose their home.
Getting the word out on the streets
Unless you wear blinders while driving around or flipping through the local
newspaper, you’ve probably noticed billboards or ads that say stuff like “We
Buy Ugly Houses” or “Need Cash? We Buy Houses!” or “Foreclosure? We 
Can Help.”
The people who post these ads are investors, just like you, fishing for early
leads on pre-auction properties. They’re usually pretty well-established
investors who have plenty of money and resources on hand to field all the
calls they get.
Don’t post an ad or paint your name and phone number on a billboard until
you’re capable of handling numerous phone calls. Advertising before you’re
prepared can backfire on you and ruin your reputation in the community 
as the resident champion for the distressed homeowner. When you’re first
starting out, focus on fewer properties, so you can devote all of your energy,
expertise, and resources to doing an outstanding job. Later you can think
about advertising.
You can also advertise online on sites such as Craig’s list at www.craigslist.
org or create a blog on MySpace.com at www.myspace.com. Some real
estate investment groups also have their own bulletin boards on which you
can post messages asking for financing or for leads on investment properties.
Just don’t forget to do your due diligence — con artists often prowl sites
looking for suckers.
107
Chapter 7: Discovering Homeowners Facing Foreclosure

Scoping Out the Neighborhood 
for Dontwanners
In my book Flipping Houses For Dummies (Wiley), I encourage real estate
investors to cruise their neighborhoods looking for dontwanners — properties
that the owners don’t want so much that that they’re willing to do anything to
get rid of them, including offering their homes for sale at a deep discount.
Dontwanners are especially relevant when investing in foreclosures, because
homeowners who are strapped for cash typically don’t have a budget for home
maintenance. Some homeowners even pack up and move out, abandoning the
house altogether. By knocking on the door and talking to the homeowners
and neighbors, you may just stumble on a property with residents who are in
the very early stages of foreclosure.
Although word-of-mouth networking is often the best way to track down pre-
auction properties, don’t focus so much on networking that you overlook
some prime real estate opportunities that you may be driving past on a daily
basis. Keep your eyes peeled for the dontwanners in your market. Here are
the common signs of a dontwanner:
 Newspapers stacked on the front step
 Neglected lawn
 House looks vacant — lack of furniture inside, no window blinds or 
curtains
If you spot a dontwanner, talk to the neighbors to find out who owns the house,
and then try to contact the owners to see if they want to sell the house.
Sometimes the owners are so fed up with a property that they’re not even
willing to take the time and trouble to place it on the market.
To gather inside information about the property, contact the owners. If you
can’t find out who owns the property, head to your county’s Register of
Deeds office and ask to see the title. For more about researching a property,
check out Chapter 8.
Searching for FSBO Properties
One of the smartest actions a homeowner can take when they find themselves
in a financial hole they can’t dig themselves out of is to sell their home and
move into more affordable accommodations. To save money, they may try
108
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

the FSBO (for sale by owner) route, so they don’t have to pay the standard
6–8 percent real estate commission. This approach, however, often backfires,
because selling a home without the assistance of a real estate agent isn’t all
that easy. The homeowners may find that they have few interested house
hunters or they don’t have the money to fix the house up to make it marketable,
and the house lingers on the market while their financial hole deepens.
Of course, FSBO sellers aren’t always experiencing financial hardship, but
you never know until you knock on the door, take a look around, and talk
with the homeowners. 
You can locate FSBOs by driving around the neighborhood and looking for
“For Sale” or “For Sale By Owner” signs. These are usually the cheaper look-
ing For Sale signs that you can pick up at your local hardware store, pen in
your phone number with a permanent market, and poke into your front lawn.
Another way to locate FSBOs is to check any of the many for-sale-by-owner sites
on the Web. One of the more popular sites is cleverly called ForSaleByOwner.
com at www.forsalebyowner.com. You can find additional sites by pulling
up your favorite Internet search tool and searching for “for sale by owner.”
Look for keywords in the listing, such as “fixer-upper,” “needs work,” “foreclo-
sure,” or “must sell.” I mention FSBO sites only because they may lead you to
opportunities. I advise against subscribing to any sites that specifically sell
foreclosure listings. I’ve subscribed to “exclusive” listings in the past that
have included homes I had already purchased at a sale. In other words, the
listings are often useless. 
Finding Foreclosure Notices
I take the foreclosure notice as somewhat of a personal failure. I wonder,
“Why didn’t this homeowner come to me first?” The foreclosure notice marks
the beginning of the end — the day when the lender first publicly announces
that the homeowners haven’t been making their payments. It’s also the day
when foreclosure investors ramp up their efforts to contact the homeowners
and when con artists often begin crawling out from under their rocks or
whatever dark place they choose to hide.
Even though the foreclosure notice marks the beginning of the end for most
distressed homeowners, it usually appears several weeks prior to the auction,
so you still have a little time left to assist the homeowners. Also, if the house
does end up on the auction block, the foreclosure notice provides you with
additional information you can use to start tracking the foreclosure, so if the
opportunity arises for you to purchase the property later, you can be well
prepared in advance with the information you need to make a good purchase
decision.

Chapter 7: Discovering Homeowners Facing Foreclosure

Tracking down local publications
When a lender initiates foreclosure proceedings, the lender posts a foreclo-
sure notice or Notice of Default (NOD) in the county’s legal newspaper or the
local newspaper. Contact your county’s Register of Deeds office and ask
where they post foreclosure notices. 
Visit your county’s Register of Deeds office and get to know the staff. While
you’re there, see if they have an extra copy of this week’s county legal news.
They may have a rack of them sitting near the desk or just outside the office.
Pick one up, head to your local coffee shop, and read through it from cover to
cover.
If you live in a county that sees a fair share of foreclosures, the foreclosure
listings can seem overwhelming at first. You skim page after page of listings
written in legalistic gobbledygook. The trick to making the listings less cum-
bersome is to know what you’re looking for and then weed out any listings
that raise red flags. For example, if you find a property on Main Street with a
mortgage of $200,000, and you know of no property on Main Street that you’d
pay more than $150,000 for, you know that property isn’t for you. If the same
property is listed for $75,000, it may be worth investigating.
Getting on the mailing list
Whoever publishes your county’s legal news is likely to have a subscription
service, so you can have the publication delivered to your door or sent to
you electronically via e-mail. In some counties, you can view foreclosure
notices online at the Register of Deeds Web site for free.
Ask one of the staff members at the Register of Deeds office about your
options or search this week’s edition of the county legal news for information
about subscribing. 
Your county’s legal news is not recommended reading — it’s required read-
ing. Carefully read through the foreclosure listings every single week, and
keep track of every property that catches your eye. You may notice that a
notice for a property one week does not appear the following week, indicat-
ing that the owners may have worked out a forbearance with the lender or
received an adjournment. Keep following the property to see if it appears
again. Properties often disappear from the radar only to reappear weeks or
months down the road. In Chapter 8, I explain how to create a database for
tracking properties.

Subscribing to commercial foreclosure
information services . . . or not
You can find plenty of commercial services that deliver foreclosure notices
via e-mail, snail mail, or through member-only Web sites. Some of these ser-
vices charge fees that are fairly reasonable — you can buy notices by city,
county, or zip code to keep costs down. Other services may charge $3,000 a
year to mail you notices that are out of date by the time the mail carrier deliv-
ers them.
Don’t waste your money on high-cost foreclosure subscription services, and
never rely solely on a commercial subscription service for leads. These ser-
vices are no replacement for reading the weekly county legal news. Why pay
more for a commercial service when your county provides the same or better
information for free or for a modest subscription fee? If you decide to sub-
scribe to a service, sign up for your own zip code first and test it out.
Compare the results to your own research to see if the information is timely
and accurate. Most of these services offer dated material, but sometimes
they provide valuable leads.
Another great place to research foreclosures, FSBO (For Sale By Owner) prop-
erties, pre-foreclosures, and bank-owned properties is HurryHome.com at
www.HurryHome.com. In addition to providing you with a handy online tool
to search for properties, HurryHome.com features neighborhood profiles,
recent home sales data, and unlisted real estate. Another useful site to check
out is www.GuthyRenkerHome.com), where you can also find some excellent
articles on real estate topics.
Deciphering a foreclosure notice
Attorneys write foreclosure notices, so you can expect them to be written in
cryptic legalese that seems to discourage the average person from thinking
about buying the property. In Chapter 8, I present a sample foreclosure notice
that shows just how cryptic they can be, and I highlight the important pieces
of information the foreclosure notice contains: 
 File number
 Foreclosure attorney’s name and contact information
 Liber (the legal book in which the deed is recorded at the county court-
house) and page number of the mortgage
111
Chapter 7: Discovering Homeowners Facing Foreclosure

 Mortgagors’ names (who owes the money)
 Lender’s name (bank or mortgage company)
 The amount that remains to be paid on the loan
 The interest rate
 Legal description of the property
 Length of the redemption period, if any
 Whether this is the first, second, third, or fourth posting of the 
foreclosure notice
Hurry. The clock’s ticking. You have about 30 to 90 days from the time the
foreclosure notice appears in the paper before the property goes on the auc-
tion block. You also have more competition now that the foreclosure is public
knowledge. Head to Chapter 8 and start gathering information about the
property pronto!
After you find a property in which you’re interested, double-check to make
sure that it’s going to be sold. Sometimes, the foreclosure notice is posted,
and then the homeowner files for bankruptcy or takes some other action to
cancel or postpone the sale. Call the attorney listed in the foreclosure notice,
introduce yourself, and find out everything you can about the property. You
may be able to obtain additional information from the attorney, such as the
opening bid and when it’s scheduled for sale, but don’t count on it — the
attorney is acting as a debt collector on behalf of the lender.

Building a Property Dossier
In This Chapter
 Investigating a foreclosure property’s vital statistics
 Gathering legal documents at the Register of Deeds office
 Inspecting the property from the street
 Checking your list to ensure you have everything you need
A
large part of foreclosure investing consists of investigating — knowing
what you’re about to buy before you lay your cash on the line. You need
to know how much the property is worth, how much is owed on it, whether it
has any additional liens or encumbrances on it, whether the property is in
violation of any building codes, and whether the person selling the house is
really the legal owner. 
For each property you consider buying, create a separate folder with a photo
of the property, its address, and all publicly accessible information available
for that property. This chapter shows you the type of information you need
and provides instructions on how to dig it up and gather it into a file to create
your very own custom property dossier.
In addition to assisting you in determining whether the property is worth
your time pursuing, this information becomes critical in assisting homeown-
ers, negotiating with homeowners and lenders, and bidding on a property at
auction.

114
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 
Collecting Essential Information 
about the Property
Every property has some vital statistics that must find their way into your
property dossier. You can collect most of the data you need through the
Notice of Default (NOD) or foreclosure notice (if one has been posted) and
from your county’s courthouse and city or town offices. Chapters 7 and 9
point you in the direction of foreclosure notices. Later in this chapter, I show
you how to pick essential details off of the foreclosure notice and dig up addi-
tional information at the county courthouse.
If you’re working with the homeowners prior to the start of foreclosure pro-
ceedings, gather as much information as you can from the homeowners first,
as explained in Chapter 9. You need to know as much as possible about their
situation in order to be of assistance and minimize your own risk as an investor.
In the following sections, I point you to the sources of key information and
provide a couple forms to complete to record the essential data in a format
you can quickly reference later.
Honing your title acquisition 
and reading skills
To hone your skills at gathering data related to foreclosure properties, con-
sider practicing on your own home first. Of course, unless you’re currently in
foreclosure, you won’t have access to a foreclosure notice (lucky you), but
you can practice researching your title, mortgage, and other documentation
relating to your property. You may have several of the documents you need
to practice on in the closing packet you received when you purchased your
home, but don’t cheat by referring to those documents. Go out in the field
and see what sorts of publicly accessible data you can gather on your own:
1. Head down to your local title company. You can find a list of title com-
panies in your phone book.
2. Meet with one of the representatives and explain that you’re reading
this book called Foreclosure Investing For Dummies, and you want to
know everything they can teach you about titles.

3. Request a title commitment on your own property. They may take a
couple days to prepare the title commitment. Offer to pick it up when
it’s ready, so they won’t have to pay postage.
4. Visit your county courthouse and track down the Register of Deeds.
5. Ask nicely to see everything recorded against your house in the last
24 months. In some cases, the records may not go that far back, but you
should be able to obtain the last two recorded documents — perhaps
the deed and the mortgage showing when you purchased the property.
6. Now, compare the title commitment you received from the title 
company with the documents you picked up with your own
detective work.
115
Chapter 8: Building a Property Dossier
Getting burned by bad decisions
Dr. Beecher, highly educated and very suc-
cessful in her field, attended a seminar on fore-
closure investing. She purchased the books and
CDs for sale at the seminar, studied them care-
fully, and decided to begin purchasing foreclo-
sure properties.
The system seemed straightforward enough, so
she began attending auctions and purchasing
properties right out of the shoot. Well, she
thought she was purchasing properties. At 
foreclosure auctions, you actually purchase
foreclosed-upon mortgages. If you buy a first
mortgage, you’re likely to take possession of the
property after the redemption period. Second
mortgages and other liens against the property
are usually wiped out by the foreclosure
process — in most cases, they’re worthless.
The doctor bought about seven or eight second
mortgages, thinking that she would be owning
the properties when the redemption periods
expired.
Paul, my buyer at foreclosure auctions,
observed the doctor over the course of a couple
weeks. One week, Paul approached her and
asked if she understood what she was doing.
During the conversation, Paul realized that the
doctor was following some bad advice. He
brought her back to the office to meet me. 
We researched the properties for her and
helped her understand what she had actually
done. She had purchased several second mort-
gages that were destined to become worthless
pieces of paper — the foreclosure would wipe
them off the books. She invested about $100,000
and was going to lose all of it. That was a tough
lesson to learn, but with her newfound under-
standing, the doctor went on to become a suc-
cessful real estate investor. 
The moral of the story is to do your homework
before you start investing. Know what you’re
buying, before you put your money on the line.

You should notice a big difference in the documents. The title commitment
won’t include all the information from the documents you picked up at the
county courthouse. Instead, it extracts the essential details and presents
them in a more easily accessible format, showing:
 Homeowners’ names
 First mortgage
 Any second mortgage or other liens against the property
 Property taxes paid or due
 Delinquent water bills or other services supplied by the municipality
Picking details off the foreclosure notice
When a NOD or foreclosure notice is published, like the one shown in Figure 8-1,
you have a wealth of information at your fingertips. The NOD or foreclosure
notice presents you with the following details that you can record on foreclo-
sure information sheet, shown in Figure 8-2:
 Case or reference number1: Some attorneys include a case or reference
number in the foreclosure notice to simplify the process of searching for
information in their database.
 Insertion date2: The date may appear in the notice itself, but if it doesn’t,
use the date of the publication in which the notice is posted. In the legal
news, the advertisements are listed under subtitles to indicate the order
of the posting — first, second, third, and so on.
 County3: The county in which the property is located is your key to
unlocking other details about the property. Using this bit of information,
you know which county’s register of deeds office to visit to research the
title and mortgage and find the property’s address. (Start off working in
the county where you live.) This may not be an issue if the paper you
are using is county specific, in which case, pay attention to the city and
focus on the city where you live or the cities that are most familiar.
 Legal lot, subdivision, and city4: The legal description of the property
does not provide the property’s mailing address, but from the legal
description, you can find the mailing address. See the later section,
“Finding the property,” for details.
 Name of the mortgagor5: The mortgagor is the borrower, typically the
homeowners — the person or people who owe the money, even if
they’re not in possession of the property.
116
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

 Name of the mortgagee6: The mortgagee is the lender who is foreclosing
on the property.
 Amount owed on the mortgage7: The NOD or foreclosure notice always
states the exact amount the homeowners currently owe on this mort-
gage. They may owe additional sums on other loans. The amount owed
changes between the time the notice is published and the sale occurs,
so call the foreclosing attorney closer to the date of sale to determine
the actual opening bid amount.
 Interest rate of loan8: The longer the amount owed on the mortgage
remains unpaid, the amount increases by the specified interest rate.
This can help you track the amount owed as it increases over time. In
addition, this is the interest rate you earn if you purchase the mortgage
and someone purchases it back from you during the redemption period.
 The mortgage company’s attorney9: The mortgage company attorney’s
name and contact information is useful in enabling you to double-check
the sale date and the opening bid and contact the mortgage company to
work out a deal.
 Mortgage sale date10: This is the date on which the attorney for the
lender expects the mortgage to be auctioned. This date can change, but
jot it down, so you can keep track of it.
 Length of the property’s redemption period, if applicable11: If your
area has a mandatory redemption period, it should appear in the NOD or
foreclosure notice. Using the date of sale and redemption period, you
can determine the last day the homeowners can redeem the property.
Verify the redemption period with your own research; occasionally the
wrong redemption period is published. 
 Liber (the legal book in which the deed is recorded at the county
courthouse) and page number of the recorded mortgage that is in
foreclosure12: This tells you where to find the mortgage document and
which mortgage is being foreclosed on if the homeowners have more
than one mortgage on the property.
If you’re buying properties directly from homeowners who contacted you
prior to the beginning of foreclosure proceedings, you can gather most of the
information you need to complete the foreclosure information sheet from 
the homeowners, as explained in Chapter 9. Just be sure to verify the infor-
mation by inspecting the title and other records as explained in the following
sections.

Digging up details at the 
register of deeds office
Whether you’re planning to bid on a property at auction or purchase the
property directly from homeowners, a trip to your county’s register of deeds
office is a necessity. The register of deeds or county clerk is the one who
records most of the legal paperwork for a property, including the title work,
deed, and mortgage. In the following sections, I point out the essential infor-
mation you need to scrounge up from this most important source.
The records you need to research can be recorded on any of several types of
media. You may be pulling out folders, flipping through pages in a book, or
looking for records on microfilm.
Finding the property
The NOD or foreclosure notice describes the location of the property through
a legal description rather than simply providing a mailing address. Isn’t that
just like lawyers? Fortunately, you can use the property description to track
down the mailing address, by employing one of the following strategies:
 Ask the clerk at your county’s register of deeds office.
 Ask your real estate attorney.
121
Chapter 8: Building a Property Dossier
The chicken man
One of the most successful foreclosure
investors in our area has been dubbed “The
Chicken Man,” because he delivers buckets of
chicken to the staff members in the register of
deeds office. By catering in lunch on a regular
basis, The Chicken Man has established an out-
standing relationship with the clerks. He can lit-
erally walk in through the back door of the
register of deeds office and help himself to the
records. When he can’t find a record he needs,
the clerks are more than willing to lend a hand.
You might say that The Chicken Man has a leg
up (and a wing and a thigh and a breast) on the
competition.
Before you step into the register of deeds or
county clerk’s office, turn on your charm and
brush up on your manners. Ask politely for
assistance and say “thank you” when the
people behind the desk provide that assistance.
The office staff stands between you and the
information you need, and they are usually as
helpful as you are polite.

 Contact your title company. If you have a good relationship with the
company, they may be willing to look up the address for you.
 Use a land data software program to search a database of property infor-
mation. Land data software programs are available in some areas and on
the Web.
Some companies, such as HomeInfoMax at www.homeinfomax.com, provide
online search tools that can assist you in finding a property’s address based
on its legal description. However, most online tools don’t cover all counties
and typically charge per search. You can get the information for free by doing
a little legwork or dialing the phone.
Once you have the address, plug it into an online mapping program you use
and print a map of the property’s location. I also use Google Earth to print a
satellite image of the property. Keep in mind, however, that satellite images
are often months or even years old — they’re no substitute to actually dri-
ving to the property and inspecting it with your own two eyes. See “Doing
Your Fieldwork: Inspecting the Property,” later in this chapter.
Obtaining the property’s title and other key documents
When most homeowners buy a property, they agree to buy the property from
the seller before any mention of the title. Prior to closing on the transaction,
they hire a title company that inspects and insures the title to protect the
buyer from any messy legal battles over who owns the property.
When buying foreclosure properties, however, inspect the title before you
decide to pursue a property. If anything about the title smells fishy, then 
you may want to do a little extra research or simply cross the property off
your list.
You can do your preliminary title research yourself by heading down to your
county’s register of deeds office and asking the clerk to provide you with the
information of what is recorded on title for a particular property. At the bare
minimum, obtain a copy of the deed and any other recorded documents for
the current and previous owner. If possible, obtain copies of all documents
recorded in the past 24 months.
Although you can do this research yourself, and you really should do it your-
self to learn about title research, I recommend that when you’re first starting
out, you consult your title company for a second opinion and order a title
commitment. Once you feel comfortable doing your own research, you can
take on more of the burden. For more about title commitments, see Chapter 4.
122
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Researching the property’s title
Inspect the title work and deed for the following critical pieces of data and
record them in the corresponding spaces on the foreclosure information
sheet, shown in Figure 8-2:
 Mortgagor (homeowners’) names: Note whether the mortgagor’s name
matches the name actually listed as the property’s title holder. Differing
names raise a red flag — make a note of it.
 Price paid for the property: Depending on how long ago the current
homeowners purchased the property, this can provide some indication
of the property’s current value.
 Deed warranty names: The names on the deed should match the home-
owners’ names on the title. If they don’t match, the difference raises a
red flag — make a note of it.
 Previous mortgagor: Check the previous title and jot down the names
on the title. Note any chinks in the chain of ownership. If the title work
shows that Johnson sold the property to Davis and then Howard sold it
to Pinkerton, who did Davis sell the house to? This gap would indicate a
problem in the chain of ownership. Consult with your title company
whenever you notice any irregularities in the chain of title. Take note of
maiden-name changes — changes in names after divorce — a name
change may result in what only appears to be a gap in the chain of 
ownership.
 Previous price paid for the property: This isn’t a crucial piece of data,
but it can point to a pattern of an increasing or decreasing property
value.
 Current first mortgage mortgagee (lender): The first mortgage mort-
gagee is the bank or other lending institution that holds the first (senior)
lien on the property. By obtaining the lender’s name from the title, you
can begin the process of tracking down the lender. Their information
should be on the actual mortgage document, a copy of which you can
obtain at the Register of Deeds office. For more about liens, including
which liens take precedent, see “Uncovering facts about additional
lender liens,” later in this chapter and check out Chapter 15.
 Original first mortgage mortgagee (lender): In many cases, a lending
institution loans the homeowners money to buy the property and then
sells the mortgage almost immediately to another lending institution.
The title typically includes the name of the original lender. When you
start making calls, having this information at your fingertips helps con-
vince the person you contact that you know what you’re talking about.
123
Chapter 8: Building a Property Dossier

If the property has a second mortgage on it, record the same information for
the second mortgage. You may be able to work with the second mortgage
lender to shore up your position. See Chapter 9 for additional details on col-
laborating with lenders.
Gathering information from the mortgage and note
The mortgage and note are also recorded along with the title when someone pur-
chases a property. These documents include important details about the senior
lien, so be sure to record these details on your foreclosure information sheet:
 First mortgage loan amount: How much did the homeowners borrow to
finance the purchase of the property? 
 Interest rate: Knowing the interest rate on the first mortgage can assist
you in calculating the homeowners’ current monthly payments and pro-
viding them with refinance options.
 Date recorded, liber, and page number: With the date recorded, liber,
and page number, you can access the information much more quickly.
 Mortgagee (lender): You may have already obtained the mortgagee’s
name from the title, but check the mortgage for any discrepancies. Also,
jot down the mortgagee’s address for future reference.
124
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 
Protecting yourself against mortgage fraud
By carefully researching the properties that inter-
est you, particularly the legal documents associ-
ated with them, you protect yourself not only from
inadvertent errors but also from con artists who
are trying to fleece you. Con artists often manip-
ulate the legal documents and file false docu-
ments as part of their scams. Sometimes, they
can even sell a house they don’t own or sell a
house several times to different buyers. To pro-
tect yourself from falling victim to a real estate
scam, take the following precautions:
 Check the records to see if the mortgage on
the property was recently paid off. Sellers
rarely pay off mortgages right before 
they sell, so any document that shows the
mortgage as having been recently paid off
is likely to be a phony document.
 Be wary of an investor who’s pitching you 
a great deal on a property. Con artists often
target novice investors in double-sales
scams.
 Analyze the title commitment for suspicious
transactions.
 Ask your title company for a 24-month prop-
erty history, including mortgages.
 Purchase title insurance as soon as possi-
ble and pay for it up front. Sometimes, this is
your only protection.

Uncovering facts about additional lender liens
Although the first (senior) lien is the most important, the property may have
other liens from second or third mortgages or construction liens that you
should know about. Unless the homeowners very recently took out another
loan using the property as collateral or the register of deeds is way behind in
recording documents, records of these liens should be accessible.
Some liens take precedence over others. Buying liens with a higher precedence
gives you more power. Property tax liens almost always take precedence over
other liens. Then, the pecking order usually follows the dates on which the
loans agreements were executed and recorded. This typically gives the first
mortgage the most power. If you order a title commitment, it lists the liens in
order of precedent. If you do your own research, you have to do this yourself.
For more about the lien pecking order, see Chapter 15.
On your foreclosure information sheet, record the names and addresses of
any additional lien holders. The date on which a lien was recorded should
alert you to the fact that a particular lien is a junior lien. The liber and page
number on which the junior lien was recorded should also be higher than
that of the senior lien, because the junior lien was recorded later.
Uncovering unpaid property taxes and other tax liens
When homeowners get behind on their taxes, government agencies at the
federal, state, or county level can place additional liens on the property.
While researching the title, inspect it for any of the following additional liens:
 IRS federal income tax liens.
 State income tax liens.
 Property tax liens.
 Any other liens. 
 Record of deceased owner (if the death certificate is on the title). If you
see a death certificate and the property is in foreclosure, try to locate the
probate attorney whose in charge of liquidating the property. To locate
the attorney, head down to the county building, visit the probate office,
and ask whether anyone has opened a probate case in the name of the
deceased party. If the case is in probate, ask to see the file, which will con-
tain the name and contact information for the person handling the case.
Additional liens, most importantly liens for overdue property taxes and IRS
tax liens, are a good sign that the homeowners will be unable to redeem the
property. They’re probably too deeply in debt to catch up on their payments.
125
Chapter 8: Building a Property Dossier

Gathering tax information 
at the assessor’s office
In addition to checking the title for any property tax liens, head down to the
county treasurer’s or assessor’s office and ask for the following:
 The property’s tax ID number (often called a property identification
number or PIN) — the number that the city or county taxing authority
assigns to the property for reference and tracking. Some cities (Detroit,
for example) have ward numbers that serve the same function.
Regardless of what the number is called, it identifies a specific parcel of
land. Once you get a feel for the identification system, you can almost
tell just by the number where the property is located.
 The taxable value of the property — you may have to visit the county
assessor’s office for this tidbit. Knowing the taxable value of a property
may assist you in guesstimating the property’s market value, but it is no
substitute for an accurate current appraisal or your own research on
market values of comparable properties. In some cases, the taxable value
may be expressed as SEV (state equalized value). SEV may represent a
fraction of the actual assessed value of the property; in some areas, for
example, the SEV is calculated as half of the previous sales price.
 The property tax formula. Currently in Michigan, a house is generally
worth 2 to 2.2 times the SEV, so a house with an SEV of $200,000 is worth
$400,000–$440,000. Ask the assessor what formula he uses. This can
often provide you with a rough estimate of the property’s market value.
 Whether property taxes are currently paid up and whether the asses-
sor’s office has a property tax lien on the property.
Getting your hands on the 
property worksheet
Every town, city, or county in the United States keeps a worksheet on every
property showing when it was built, any building permits issued on the prop-
erty, code violations, inspection reports, and so on. Find out who keeps the
property worksheets and obtain a copy of the worksheet for any home you
are considering buying. On your foreclosure information sheet, record the fol-
lowing data from the property worksheet:
 Building permits: Building permits provide a record of all approved
property improvements. If you inspect the property later and discover
an improvement that was performed without a permit, this may be a
warning that the improvement does not conform to building codes.
126
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

 Code violations: If the property has any code violations recorded
against it that have not been resolved, you want to know about it, so you
don’t unknowingly take possession of a property that you’re responsible
for bringing up to code later.
 Other interesting tidbits: The property worksheet may include addi-
tional information about health code violations that warn you to inspect
the property more closely before purchasing it. For tips on physically
inspecting a foreclosure property, see “Doing Your Fieldwork: Inspecting
the Property,” later in this chapter.
A permit showing that the work passed final inspection is best. That shows that
no matter who pulled (obtained) the permit (the homeowner or a licensed con-
tractor), the work was completed and was at least up to code. Open permits —
those that don’t indicate that the work passed final inspection — may indi-
cate that the work was completed to code or that you’re going to be in for
some costly repairs. In any event, knowing what’s been recorded with the city
concerning work begun or completed on the property is beneficial.
Gathering additional information
To complete the foreclosure information sheet, do a little extra detective
work to gather the following additional details:
 Opening bid: If you found out about the property through a NOD or
foreclosure notice, call the attorney listed in the notice to find out the
opening bid.
 Homeowner’s telephone number: Finding the homeowners’ phone
number can be challenging, especially if their phone’s been disconnected
or the number is unlisted. Using the homeowner’s name and the prop-
erty address, try looking up the phone number online at a site such as
www.whitepages.com. If you can’t get the phone number, don’t worry.
In Chapter 9, I provide some additional tips for finding homeowners. 
 Estimated property value: The property’s current value is how much
the homeowners could get for the property if they sold it today. You can
obtain a ballpark estimate by checking the prices of comparable homes
that have sold in the past month or so. A real estate agent can come in
handy here. Refer to Chapter 10 for details.
 Total owed on the property: Add up the balance on all liens against the
property. You can come up with a pretty accurate figure by adding up
the original balances and deducting estimated payments. If the loans are
less than 10 years old, chances are pretty good that the balances haven’t
been paid down very much, because a good chunk of each payment in
the early years is applied to interest, not principal.
127
Chapter 8: Building a Property Dossier

Doing Your Fieldwork: Inspecting 
the Property
An investment property may seem like a steal on paper when it’s actually a
gutted shell of a home in the center of the low-rent district. Until you see the
property for yourself, you have no idea what it is, what kind of homes sur-
round it, or what condition the home is in. 
Before you plop down your money or borrowed money on a property, always
inspect it as closely as possible with your own two eyes, carefully record
your observations, and add the details you gather to your growing property
dossier. In the following sections, I provide an exterior home inspection form
to complete, and I lead you through the process of performing your due dili-
gence in the field.
Doing a drive-by, walk-around inspection
The least you should do (and the most you can do in some situations) to
inspect a property is to drive over and walk around the property — at a safe
distance, of course — I’m not suggesting that you trespass. Even if you can’t
get inside to take a closer peek, the drive-by, walk-around inspection pro-
vides you with enough preliminary information to develop a ballpark esti-
mate of the property’s value and rule out any really bad properties.
Whenever you visit a property in person, you’re at some risk. The homeown-
ers, and sometimes their dog, may not appreciate uninvited visitors, espe-
cially if you trespass. Keep your distance. Knocking on the front door is
usually okay, but if the homeowners ask you to leave, respect their wishes
and follow up with a letter, as explained in Chapter 9.
As you perform your drive-by, walk-around inspection, complete the exterior
inspection form provided in Figure 8-3. (I don’t write very neatly, so I take
along a digital recorder, record my observations, and then burn the audio clip
to a CD to add to my file.) You may be unable to collect all of the information
requested on the form, but collect as much information as possible without
becoming too pushy if the homeowners confront you.
If the home is currently listed for sale, call the agent and take a tour of the
inside of the house. You don’t need to tell the agent that you know the home-
owners are facing foreclosure. In Chapter 9, I provide an inspection form for
the interior of the property — take the form with you and fill it out.

Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Never pass up the opportunity to talk to a neighbor. If a neighbor wanders
out to ask what you’re doing, strike up a conversation and try to find out
more about the homeowners and the condition of the property. No nosy
neighbors? Then consider becoming a little nosy yourself and knocking on
doors. A neighbor may have recently been inside the house. If you can’t get 
in to inspect the property, a second-hand report from a neighbor is the next

best thing. In some cases, you may even stumble across a neighbor whom the
homeowner has anointed to be caretaker; if she has keys and is willing to show
you around, you’ve struck gold! For tips on how to do an interior inspection
and an interior inspection form skip, to Chapter 9.
Snapping some photos
Every real estate investor should own a high-quality digital camera with a 3x
or better zoom lens to take snapshots of prospective investment properties.
As you walk around the property, take a couple photos of every side of the
house, the landscape, and surrounding houses. The photo documentary you
create is priceless. If you inspect dozens of properties, you’re not likely to
remember a specific house. A few photos can bring you right back to the day
when you first inspected the property.
If possible, take your photos late morning or early afternoon, when the home-
owners are more likely to be at work and the kids in school, to avoid any con-
frontation with the homeowners and keep the kids from asking their parents
embarrassing questions like, “Why is that lady taking pictures of our house?”
You can also keep a low profile by snapping photos from inside your car. What-
ever you do, just make sure you’re on public property — the sidewalk or street,
rather than in someone’s yard.
In addition to photographing the property itself, photograph the neighborhood:
 Take a photo of the street view both ways.
 Take a picture of the houses across the street.
 Photograph any eyesores.
If your camera has a time stamp feature that places the day’s date and time
on every photo, turn on the time stamp, so you can coordinate your photos
with your property data sheets. If you take photos of several properties in
the course of a week and wait a few days before printing your photos, you
may not recall which house the photos represent.
As soon as possible after snapping the photos, print them or take them to
your local photo shop to have them processed. Stick the photos in your prop-
erty dossier for later reference. Burn them onto a disc and save them with
the file to avoid cost.

Assembling Your Dossier: A Checklist
For every property I investigate, I create a separate folder for all the docu-
ments pertaining to that property. I use different-colored folders to keep data
for my top prospects separate. I recommend a similar strategy, but you feel
free to be creative — just make sure your system keeps all the data on each
house separate and easily accessible. You can even store the information in
separate folders on a portable computer. 
However you choose to organize your property information, make sure each
folder contains the following items:
 8-by-10-inch photograph of the property taped to the front of the folder
for quick reference.
 The foreclosure notice.
 The foreclosure information sheet you completed.
 The exterior inspection form you completed.
 Neighborhood inspection, complete with photos. 
 Information on any other properties that are listed for sale in the area,
so you can track the sales price and how long it took to sell.
 A map showing the location of the property.
 The title commitment and 24-month history in the chain of title or the
minimum last two recorded documents.
 The last recorded first mortgage, so you know how much the homeown-
ers currently owe on the property.
 Records of other liens on the property, such as second mortgages, con-
struction liens, and tax liens. Property tax liens are especially important,
because if you buy the property, you’re responsible for paying any back
property taxes.
 A copy of the deed with the current homeowners’ names. These names
should match the names on the title.
 The city worksheet on the property showing the history of the property.
 The SEV (state equalized value).
 MLS listings of comparable properties that have recently sold or are cur-
rently for sale.
131
Chapter 8: Building a Property Dossier

If you gathered information to bid for properties at an auction, pack all of
your folders with you. You may have researched 20 properties and narrowed
down your prospects to the top 3, but take all 20 folders with you, because
you never know what will happen come auction day. You may have ruled out
a $250,000 house that had a $260,000 mortgage on it, but then, when the auc-
tion rolls around, it may open with a bid for $170,000. By quickly referencing
your property dossier and doing some basic math, you realize that you can
pick up $80,000 in equity. Because you’ve done your homework and you have
your file with you, you may be the only one in the room who knows what that
house is worth. When that happens, you’re like a fox in the henhouse.

W
hen you choose to deal directly with homeowners facing foreclosure,
you become the resident rescue worker in a burning building. Your
job is to assess the situation, point out the exits, and do everything in your
power to assist the homeowners in extinguishing the flames or safely retreat-
ing from the building.
As a foreclosure rescue worker, you must first contact the homeowners and
obtain detailed information about their situation. This requires an empa-
thetic ear and the ability to jot down the most important details. With this
information and the details about the property (see Chapter 7), you can then
assess the situation and lay the homeowners’ options on the table. Perform
your job well, and you earn the homeowners’ trust and place yourself in a
better position to obtain the property should they choose to sell it. 
In this chapter, I lead you through the process of contacting the homeowners,
gathering information about their situation, and presenting their options to
them. I also show you how to deal effectively with lenders to negotiate a 
solution that’s less painful for all involved.

Scheduling Your Foreclosure Activities
Having a game plan for researching the property and contacting the home-
owners and lenders is always a good idea. By planning your activities in
advance, you create a schedule that keeps you on track and in touch with the
homeowners and lenders. 
Your schedule is generally dictated by the time span between the posting of
the foreclosure notice and the sale and on the redemption period, if you have
a redemption period in your area. If your area has a redemption period, you
can continue to educate and work with the homeowners even after their
home has been sold at auction. 
Planning is important, but be flexible. The foreclosure process is predictable,
but the homeowners and their situation are often very unpredictable. Be pre-
pared to ride some serious waves.
In Michigan, the foreclosure notice is published four-to-six consecutive weeks
before the sale and is typically subject to a redemption period of six months
or more. My plan kicks into action as soon as I spot an interesting foreclosure
notice and continues for four consecutive weeks. Start with the following
plan and tweak it to conform to the foreclosure schedule in your area:
Week 1:
1. Find the foreclosure notice or NOD (Notice of Default).
2. Do some preliminary research on the property, as explained in
Chapter 7:
• Find the property’s address.
• Visit the property to see if it’s something you’d be interested in
purchasing.
• Take photos of the property, if you’re interested.
Don’t waste time or resources ordering a title commitment or heavily
researching a property that you have no intention of buying. At this
point, you’re just trying to spot the best prospects. Once you have a
short list, you can do more research.
3. Send your first foreclosure letter introducing yourself to the home-
owners. See “Delivering a letter of introduction,” later in this chapter.
Week 2:
1. Find second foreclosure notice.
2. If the notice does not appear, send a congratulations letter to the
homeowners.
134
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

3. Review the title work.
4. Attempt to contact the homeowners by phone.
5. Knock on door to attempt face-to-face meeting.
6. Send your second foreclosure letter.
Week 3:
1. Find the third foreclosure notice.
2. If a third notice does not appear, send a congratulations letter to the
homeowners.
3. Attempt to contact the homeowners by phone.
4. Research the property more thoroughly if it appears to be a hot
prospect:
• Research comparable sales.
• Order a title commitment or obtain the title work yourself.
5. Contact the junior lien-holders. See “Contacting the Lenders,” later in
this chapter.
6. Contact mortgagee’s attorney, and find out if:
• The property is still going to auction.
• If there is an opening bid and what the opening bid amount is.
• If they are considering an adjournment (postponing the sale),
which is usually a sign that the homeowners and lender are negoti-
ating a possible solution. 
• Any other background information. Feel them out for a possible
short sale. Chapter 15 provides additional information about nego-
tiating short sales.
6. Send your third foreclosure letter.
Week 4:
1. Find fourth (probably final) foreclosure notice.
2. If a fourth notice does not appear, send a congratulations letter to the
homeowners.
3. Drive by the house you are interested in bidding on at auction and
take new photos if the condition of property has changed significantly.
4. Attempt to contact the homeowners by phone.
5. Send your fourth foreclosure letter.
6. Organize your property dossier for the auction.

Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 
Avoiding legal brouhahas: Ignorance is no excuse
Prior to contacting the homeowners directly,
brush up on the legal and ethical rules of the
foreclosure game, so you don’t get slapped with
a lawsuit and you can look yourself in the mirror
every morning and know that you’re not ripping
off distressed homeowners. Here are the do’s
and don’ts you must follow to work foreclosures
ethically and legally:
 Never do anything to mislead homeowners
into thinking you’re something you’re not,
such as an attorney, accountant, or finan-
cial advisor. Let homeowners know up front
that you are an investor who purchases
properties. If you are a real estate agent,
you must disclose the fact that you act in
both capacities.
 Always let the homeowners decide what is
best for them. You can present their options,
but this is their home and their debt. Don’t
steer them into selling the property to you
simply because it’s in your best interest.
 Always recommend that the homeowners
contact their lenders directly or consult an
attorney or accountant if that would be in
their best interest. If they are hesitate or
afraid to call their lender, you can have
them sign an authorization form and call the
lender with them. Unfortunately con-artists
use an authorization form to collect per-
sonal information that enables them to rip
off distressed homeowners.
 Present all of the homeowners’ options to
them, including the option to file for bank-
ruptcy, even if that means that you lose out
on the deal.
 Don’t befriend the homeowners’ for the sole
purpose of convincing them to hand the
house over to you. 
 If you decide to purchase the property from
the homeowner, put your offer in writing on
a purchase agreement. In real estate, only
agreements in writing stand up in court.
 Avoid any contact with the homeowners
during the last month of the redemption
period. At this point, homeowners may
become very desperate and accuse you of
making promises you never made. The unfor-
tunate reality is that this is exactly when they
will contact you, usually from one of the let-
ters you sent that they have been holding on
to. If you do talk with them, record the con-
versations as protection, provided that you
have the legal right to record conversations.
 Audiotape your conversations with home-
owners, whether you meet with them in
person or talk on the phone. Bring a
recorder and ask permission to record the
conversation for their protection and yours.
This way no one can conveniently forget
what was actually said. 
Anyone with a bad attitude and a hundred
bucks can file a lawsuit. My company was deal-
ing with a couple who were facing foreclosure.
The wife never told the husband that she had
not made the payments until they lost the house.
We told her that she needed to come to the
office to find out more about their options. The
last week of the redemption period was the
beginning of hunting season, and the husband
was out of town, so they never showed up for
the scheduled meeting. They retained an attor-
ney who sued us. Their claim was that we had
promised they could stay in the home. They lost
the case and then hired another attorney. 
I strongly encourage you to consult a real estate
attorney familiar with foreclosure laws in your
market before working foreclosures in your
area. Also, find out about your legal rights for
taping conversations. In Michigan, you can
legally tape a phone conversation as long as
you’re in on the conversation.

If your state has no redemption period, stress to the homeowners that they
are very likely to lose their house and all of its equity unless they take action
before the mortgage sale. In areas with redemption periods, homeowners still
have time after the sale to take action, but the longer they wait, the less
attractive are their options.
If your area uses NODs, begin by contacting bank REO Departments as soon
as the NOD is filed. See Chapter 12 for details.
I track foreclosures using a computer program called ACT. For each property,
I add the homeowners as contacts and add reminders for each week telling
me just what to do and when to do it. With reminders set for specific dates,
whenever I run ACT, the program notifies me when I need to call, write, or
visit a prospective client. Use whatever software or system works for you,
but be sure you have an effective system in place.
Contacting the Homeowners Directly
To purchase properties directly from homeowners prior to auction, you have
two big challenges ahead of you: tracking down the homeowners and getting
them to sit down with you at the kitchen table to discuss their situation.
Rarely do homeowners who are facing foreclosure seek help. Most often, in
an attempt to avoid the situation, they do everything they can to avoid
lenders, collectors, attorneys, and investors . . . yeah, people like you.
In the following sections, I reveal strategies and tips that I use to track down
homeowners and make a good first impression when I contact them.
Many real estate investors avoid foreclosures, because the homeowners can
be so difficult to track down and deal with, so this reduces some of the com-
petition for foreclosure properties. With stamina, determination, people skills,
and this book, you have everything you need to tap into this open market.
Tracking down the homeowners
When people can’t pay their bills, the repo man is trying to drive off with
their car, bill collectors are harassing them, and the phone company has dis-
connected their service, they can be a little tough to get a hold of. Many dis-
tressed homeowners even go into hiding — they refuse to answer the door or
the phone, they avoid the neighbors, and sometimes they even up and leave,
vacating the premises.
To contact homeowners, you often need to do a little detective work first to
find out where they’re living and to obtain a phone number, just in case
137
Chapter 9: Contacting the Homeowners and Lenders

they’re answering the phone. Here are some tips that have worked well for
me in tracking down homeowners:
 Contact the county’s tax assessor’s or treasurer’s office (whoever
sends out the tax bills). The address where the tax bills are sent is
public information, and the bills go to the homeowner. If the homeowner
is not residing at the property, the tax bill may be going to a different
address.
 Send a letter to the property’s address with a return receipt request
attached to it. See “Contacting the Homeowners Directly,” for some
sample letters. If the person is no longer at the address you used, you
get the letter back with the person’s forwarding address on it. The
postal service charges about a buck for the return receipt request.
 Contact the neighbors. If you don’t have their phone numbers, use a
reverse address search tool on the Internet to obtain their phone num-
bers. At www.whitepages.com, for example, you can select the
Reverse Address option, enter a person’s address, and get the names
and phone number of the people residing there.
 Search for the homeowners by name online at Web sites like www.
whitepages.com. Several online services are available for tracking
down people that charge a relatively small fee to track down unlisted
numbers.
 Flip through the phone book and call everyone who has the same last
name as the person you’re trying to contact. Start with the people who
live in the area near the property and fan out.
 In cases of divorce, you may need to go down to the county court-
house and look up the marriage certificate to find out the wife’s
maiden name.
The more difficult a homeowner is to contact, the better the opportunity for
you. Most foreclosure investors give up when their first few attempts to con-
tact the homeowner fail, leaving you with less competition. With a little per-
sistence, you may be the lone investor who succeeds at contacting the
homeowner.
Kicking off your mail campaign
Contacting homeowners prior to the auction is not a one-time event. Like a
doctor whose treating a patient in recovery, remain in constant contact with
the homeowners up until the time they decide how they want to resolve the
situation. Your goal should be to contact the homeowners at least once a
week via phone, mail, personal visits, e-mail, or a combination of methods.
Success in pre-auction foreclosures hinges on your ability to continually let
the homeowners know how you can assist them.
138
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Your primary medium for contacting distressed homeowners is the letter —
either mailed to the homeowners’ address or hand-delivered. In the following
sections, I supply you with samples of letters I use, but in most cases, you
should edit the letter to give it a more personal touch.
Delivering a letter of introduction
In your first letter, let the homeowners know that you know they are facing
foreclosure, that they have options, and that you can provide some guidance.
Include your phone number, so they can contact you for additional infor-
mation and to set up an appointment. Figure 9-1 shows a sample letter of
introduction.
You can type the letter, but hand-address the envelope. If you use your
printer to print the mailing address, the letter may appear too official, and
the homeowners may not even open it. For your return address, use the
address of your business or personal residence — a P.O. box number is too
impersonal.
Delivering follow-up letters
Read the foreclosure notices every week, as explained in Chapter 7. If a fore-
closure notice is posted for the property in this week’s legal news or local
paper, send a follow-up letter to the homeowners. You should send a follow-
up letter every week leading up to the week of the foreclosure sale.
With each successive letter, add a touch more urgency in your call to action.
Always emphasize that doing nothing is the worst thing anyone in foreclosure
can do. Time is of the essence! Figures 9-2, 9-3, and 9-4 provide sample letters
you can send to homeowners at the beginning of weeks 2, 3, and 4. Note that
each letter increases the sense of urgency.
Consider sending a letter the day of the sale, informing the homeowner that
the house went to sale and that you have the amount it sold for, the name of
the person who purchased the property, and the amount of the overbid (if an
overbid occurred). An overbid occurs if someone bids more for the property
than is needed to cover the amount owed on it; homeowners can claim the
overbid money. Let them know how to contact you so that you have another
opportunity to personally talk with them, set up a face-to-face meeting, and
supply them with this valuable information and what it means.
Congratulating the homeowners
As you’re checking the weekly foreclosure notices, you may find that a fore-
closure notice does not appear for a property you’re tracking. In some cases,
the homeowners negotiate a solution with the lender. When this occurs, don’t
assume that your relationship with the homeowners has ended. Send them a
letter of congratulations, as shown in Figure 9-5.

Chapter 9: Contacting the Homeowners and Lenders

Many homeowners who survive the current financial crisis end up in the
same position later down the road. If you’ve been helpful, they are likely to
contact you the next time they experience difficulties. Even if they don’t have
future problems, they may recommend you to friends or relatives who find
themselves in a similar situation.

 Dear Friend,
 Sometimes bad things happen to good people. I am sorry to learn that the lender who holds 
your mortgage has begun foreclosing on your home. Despite what you may be hearing from 
other people trying to make a quick buck at your expense, you may have other options other 
than losing your home.
 I am dedicated to helping people in this area achieve the American dream of 
homeownership. I am also dedicated to helping people hold onto that dream when they are 
facing hard times. I am committed to making sure that people in foreclosure know all of the 
options available to them when facing this situation.
 You are not alone. Hundreds of thousands of homeowners in the United States face similar 
situations every year. Foreclosure is almost epidemic. Most of the people in these situations 
are just like you—hardworking people who have had a few bad breaks. 
 I have studied the foreclosure process in our area and can explain your options to you in 
detail. Some of these options may enable you to retain possession of your house or at least 
delay the process, so you have more time to seek better solutions and preserve your credit 
rating. The sooner you take action, the better your options.
 Don’t lose your home and the equity you’ve worked so hard to build up just because you’re 
too embarrassed to get advice. I have helped many people in your situation and I can help 
you too. Please call me at <Your Phone Number>, so we can discuss your options and start 
putting this nightmare behind you.
 The worst thing you can do now is nothing! I can’t be forceful enough on this point. If you 
ignore this problem, you will lose your home. Please call me today. 
 Sincerely,
 <Your Signature>

 Dear Friend,
 You are receiving this letter because, incredibly, your financial difficulty is now a matter of 
public record. 
 I say, “Dear Friend,” because I have a good idea what you’re going through. My mentor, 
Ralph Roberts, was in your shoes when he lost his own home back in 1979. He knows what 
it’s like to be angry, frustrated, and hounded by creditors. You wonder if you’ll ever get ahead. 
Ralph hated the ring of the phone, but he hated it even more when they shut off his phone.
 Today, 20 years after his ordeal, Ralph will tell you that he lost his home because he was too 
embarrassed to ask for help. He lost his home because he did nothing and allowed it to be 
taken from him without even putting up a fight. Fortunately for you, however, that horrible 
experience motivated Ralph to do everything he could to make sure other people—good 
people like you—don’t have to go through the same thing he did.
 That is why Ralph began training investors all over the country to help people in foreclosure. 
He studied foreclosures throughout North America to learn about every possible option 
available to people facing this nightmare. With Ralph’s training and consultation, I have 
developed a system—a step-by-step strategy –for helping people like you to escape the trap 
of foreclosure. 
 This system has worked for countless others across the country. I’m sure it can work for you 
if you’ll just give me the chance to help you out.
 With my assistance, you can successfully navigate the foreclosure process. I’m sure you 
don’t realize the many options you do have available to you. In many cases, if you act quickly, 
you can keep your home. If that’s not possible, you can at least receive fair market value for 
the property, protect your credit rating, and avoid seeing your house sold to the highest 
bidder at a Sheriff’s Sale.
 I am here—ready, willing and able to help. But YOU have to make the first move and give me 
a call. Please call me directly at <Your Phone Number>, so we get started putting this 
nightmare behind you.
 Sincerely,
 <Your Signature>
 <Your Name>
 Foreclosure Specialist
 P.S. As I mentioned above, you do have many options available to you. But, the longer you 
wait, the fewer options you will have. And, if you sit and do nothing, you will lose your home. 
Please do something to help yourself and call me today.

 Dear Friend,
 The Sheriff’s Sale on <Mortgage Sale Date> is fast approaching. 
 I am extremely concerned!
 This is the third letter I’ve sent you—yet I still haven’t heard back from you. Just so that you 
are completely aware of what’s going on here, I believe that it is very important that you fully 
understand what will happen if your house goes to that Sheriff’s Sale.
 At the Sheriff’s Sale, your property will be sold to the highest bidder. If no investor comes 
forward to bid on your property, it will be turned over to the bank that holds your mortgage. 
Either way, you will have no right to reinstate your existing mortgage once the sale takes 
place. 
 If you continue to do nothing, you WILL lose your home. That is a harsh statement, but I want 
to be perfectly clear so that I know you are completely aware of your situation and the 
consequences of your actions—or inaction.
 Please, call me directly at <Your Phone Number> to let me know that you do indeed 
understand what is going to happen. If you call me right away, you still have options available 
to you. But realize that your time is quickly running out.
 Sincerely,
 <Your Signature>

 P.S. If you want to save what equity you have in your home—not to mention your credit 
rating—doing nothing is NOT an option. Please call me TODAY before it’s too late. Don’t let 
embarrassment about your situation cause you to lose your home; I’ve helped many good 
people, just like you, turn things around.

 Dear Friend,
 You are almost out of time.
 You have only a few days until your home will be sold to the highest bidder at the Sheriff’s 
Sale. Unless you do something immediately, someone else will own your home within the 
week. 
 Believe it or not, you still have options available to you. If you’ll just take the first step and 
give me a call, I have all the knowledge, resources, and expertise available to help you 
escape your foreclosure nightmare and get your life back on track. But, unfortunately, I am 
powerless to help you—UNLESS you call me RIGHT NOW!
 If you do nothing, you WILL lose your home. The sad part is that you don’t have to. 
 Right now you probably feel totally alone, as if you don’t have a friend in the world. But, in 
reality, you have a friend right here who is ready, willing, and able to help. I know what you’re 
going through.
 My mentor, the best-selling Realtor in America, Ralph Roberts himself lost his own home to 
foreclosure back in 1979. That is why he has taught me all about foreclosures so I can help 
people like you—good people who have had some bad breaks. I have helped many people 
facing the same situation as you. I CAN help you, too. 
 Please call me NOW at <Your Phone Number>.

Getting in touch over the phone
Through your letter campaign, hopefully the homeowners call you, but if they
haven’t called by the second week, try giving them a ring. When you eventu-
ally do get in touch with them, your goal is to set up an initial face-to-face
meeting at their kitchen table. Be prepared to listen closely to what they say
and take notes. Figure 9-6 provides a sample phone script you can use to
guide you through your initial conversation with the homeowners.
Be prepared to field calls at any time of the day or night from people who are
afraid. You should have a cell phone and be very accessible. I’ve received
phone calls well into the wee hours of the morning. Distressed homeowners
seem to gain their courage as the sun sets. Many spouses call when their hus-
band or wife are at work or sleeping. Keep in mind that these callers do not
know what to do, and they may be dealing with other tragic situations, so
this often results in an atmosphere of uneasiness.

Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Don’t forget to include the spouse if a couple owns the home. Early on in
your conversation, ask if the spouse knows of the situation. Eventually, the
spouse needs to be brought into the discussion, but you want to make sure
it’s done properly. I’ve had spouses ask me to be the bearer of bad news, but
the partner should have the option of breaking the bad news himself. Once
both homeowners are apprised of what’s going on, they need to both be
included in the decision process and the signing of any agreements.
Before you call, brush up on the options available to the homeowners, just 
in case they ask about them. Ideally, your phone call results in a face-to-face
meeting with the homeowners, but if they ask about their options, be pre-
pared to provide some general information. For details about homeowners’
options, see “Laying Out All Available Options,” later in this chapter.
You say: Hello, my name is <Your Name>.  I’m a real estate investor who helps homeowners 
just like you escape the foreclosure trap.  I have been trying to reach you for some time now.  
As crazy as it sounds, the fact that you’re facing foreclosure is now a matter of public record.
Despite what others who have already contacted you may have told you, you do have rights 
and options available to you to save your home.
 
I would like to get together with you as soon as possible to discuss your options.  Can we 
meet at your house or at my office sometime this week?
Homeowner says: Yes.
You say: Fantastic, let me know what’s best for you. (Set up an appointment.)
Homeowner says: No.
You say: I think you owe it to yourself to at least find out how the foreclosure  
process works and what rights you have so people don’t try to take advantage of 
you. Will you at least take a few minutes right now to let me tell you about your 
rights?
Homeowner says: Yes.
You say: Believe me, you are doing the right thing.  I’ve helped a lot of people save 
their homes and credit ratings.  How many months are you behind on your 
mortgage? Tell me a little about how you got into this situation. (Ask questions from 
 
the homeowner information sheet shown in Figure 10-6.)
 
Homeowner says: No.

Chapter 9: Contacting the Homeowners and Lenders

As you converse, keep the following tips in mind:
 Realize that the homeowners may have already been contacted by others.
 Listen more than you talk and show compassion for their situation. The
homeowners can really use a sympathetic ear, and hearing their story
provides you with valuable background information about their situa-
tion and mindset. This is your opportunity to establish a bond of trust.
 Let the homeowners know that you want to assist them and are an
expert in foreclosure options.
 Emphasize that the worst action they can take is to do nothing.
 Ask lots of questions, but don’t interrupt. They have to know that you
care before they’ll care what you know. Interrupting someone who is
pouring out their heart is potentially devastating to your relationship.
Remember that something you feel is important can seem completely
unimportant to someone whose emotions are ruling his thoughts. 
Your initial conversation is a success if you achieve the following goals: 
 Obtain the homeowners’ complete contact information.
 Establish yourself as an expert in foreclosure matters.
 Let the homeowners know that they have options and that you can
explain their options when you meet for the first time. 
 Assist the homeowners in understanding their rights and the foreclosure
process. In Michigan, for example, few homeowners realize that they
control the home through the redemption period.
 Inform the homeowners that they need to be very careful, because unsa-
vory characters may purposely mislead them to take advantage of them.
 Schedule a face-to-face meeting.
 Instruct the homeowners to gather all the paperwork related to the prop-
erty, including the closing package they received when they purchased
the property, correspondence from the lender and the foreclosing attor-
ney, and (if available) any notices posted on the property by the sheriff.
Once you’ve set up a meeting, ask the homeowners why they called you
instead of talking with another investor, and ask to see any correspondence
they received from other investors. Get to know the people you’re competing
against and what you’re doing that works and doesn’t work.
146
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Adding the Homeowners’ Profile 
to Your Property Dossier
In order to assess the homeowners’ current foreclosure situation, you first need
to gather some essential details. When you meet with the homeowners for the
first time, explain the foreclosure process and ask the following questions:
 How did the situation escalate to this point?
 Have you discussed your situation with any other professionals, such as
agents, lawyers, accountants, lenders?
 If you discussed the situation with others, what did they suggest?
 What do you want to do? Save your house? Save your equity and move?
File for bankruptcy? (When mentioning bankruptcy, stress that you are
not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice or representation. You
can, however, share general information about the different types of
bankruptcy.)
 Can I take some time to explain your options? (Remember that options
vary depending on the amount of time the homeowners have to act and
the amount of equity they have built up in the property.)
 Do you have any questions about your rights and options?
When you’ve gained the homeowners’ trust, explain that to help them you
need to know some more detailed information. Work with the homeowners to
complete the homeowner information sheet shown in Figure 9-7.
Laying Out All Available Options
Once you’ve completed the foreclosure information sheet (Chapter 7) and
the homeowner information sheet (Figure 9-7) and have a first-hand account
of the situation, the homeowners’ situation becomes much clearer. You begin
to get a sense of what the owners want to do, what options they can realisti-
cally accomplish, and which is the best course of action for them to take,
whether it’s refinancing, selling, downsizing, renting or, in the worst cases,
filing for bankruptcy.

Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Reinstating the loan
If the homeowners can come up with enough cash to bring their mortgage
payments up to date and pay any back taxes and penalties, they may be able
to reinstate the mortgage. In most cases, this requires that the homeowners
sell other assets or obtain financial assistance from family or friends.
Most homeowners in foreclosure are too embarrassed to ask family and
friends for help, but this is often the best solution. Encourage the homeown-
ers to contact any family members who may be able to give or loan them the
money to pay off the lender who’s foreclosing on the property. In many cases,
I meet with family members personally to assist the homeowner in telling
family members about their situation.
149
Chapter 9: Contacting the Homeowners and Lenders
Convincing the homeowners to seek help
Convincing distressed homeowners to seek
assistance from family members is a challenge.
You can often succeed by asking the home-
owners what they would do if they were in a
position to help someone in their family who
was experiencing financial problems.
My office was once in the process of assisting
a young couple who had three small children.
Initially, I met with the wife at her home. Once
she felt comfortable, she and her husband came
to the office.
As I began laying out their options, the first
option I presented was to ask friends and family
to help. I explained that homeowners in similar
situations often have people in their lives who
can help, but because of shame or embarrass-
ment, most homeowners won’t ask for help. I
asked if they had anyone they could go to for
some financial assistance. They explained that
they didn’t want to ask friends or family for help. 
Then I asked them that if a loved one needed
help and they had the means to help that
person, how would they feel if they weren’t
asked. The couple continued to refuse to ask
friends or family for help.
I continued explaining their remaining options.
After each option, I asked them if the option was
something they thought would fit their situation
better. The husband became a bit uneasy and
said that they actually did have someone they
could go to, but his wife was unwilling.
After some discussion, I learned that the wife’s
parents were very wealthy and owned a thriv-
ing business on the East Coast. She didn’t want
to call because she was afraid that her father
would be mad. I told her that her father would
probably be mad because she hadn’t called him
earlier, and that he would probably be more
upset to know that his grandchildren were
needlessly evicted. I also asked, “If one of your
children needed help, wouldn’t you want to be
called immediately?”
The answer of course was “Yes,” and we called
her parents right then from our conference
room. All of the emotions that you would expect
poured out during that phone conversation, and
the couple worked through a very painful expe-
rience, but it resulted in saving their home.

Negotiating with the lenders 
for a forbearance
If the homeowners have experienced a temporary financial setback, they may
be able to work out a solution with the lender to restructure their payments
and get back on track. If they’ve fallen way behind in their payments and their
prospects of getting back on track look bleak, however, the lender is unlikely
to agree to a forbearance.
With the homeowners’ approval and a signed release form, like the one shown
in Figure 9-8, you can negotiate with the lender on the homeowners’ behalf to
agree to a forbearance. Remember, however, that you won’t be the one send-
ing the check to the lender each week, so the homeowner has to be on board
and able to perform or else you will have lost credibility with that lender the
next time you call.

Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Refinancing the mortgage
For homeowners with solid, stable incomes and assets other than their home
who are experiencing a temporary financial setback, refinancing to a noncon-
forming loan may be an option. A nonconforming loan is a mortgage that typi-
cally charges 2–3 percent interest above conventional rates plus additional
points at closing. In some cases, if the homeowners can make their payments
on time for a year, they qualify for refinancing back to a conforming mortgage.
Refinancing is usually a poor choice for people with lower incomes, because
even if they qualify for a nonconforming loan, they may end up having higher
monthly mortgage payments than what they previously had. Refinancing
simply sets them up for another round of foreclosure.
If the homeowners’ gross income is sufficient for covering their monthly bills
in addition to a higher monthly mortgage payment, offer to set up a meeting
with your loan officer to discuss their options with them. But hurry, the clock
is ticking!
Listing the property
Homeowners who have several thousands of dollars worth of equity built up
in their homes are often best served by placing the house on the market, sell-
ing it, and moving to more affordable accommodations. This option enables
the homeowners to keep much or all of the equity they’ve accumulated in their
home. Unfortunately, this is usually the last option they’re willing to consider.
When presenting this option to homeowners, highlight the following key points:
 If the homeowners have little, no, or negative equity in the property, this
option is off the table.
 If the auction is scheduled to occur in the next few weeks, the homeown-
ers may not be able to sell it in time. If, however, your area has a lengthy
redemption period, they do have time to sell.
 If the homeowners are already in their redemption period, remind them
that interest is accruing on the amount the bank or investor paid for the
mortgage at the auction. The sooner they sell, the less interest they pay.
151
Chapter 9: Contacting the Homeowners and Lenders

 To sell the home faster, recommend that the homeowners sell through a
qualified real estate agent, and make sure that the agent they pick under-
stands foreclosure and that time is of the essence.
 If the homeowners are reluctant to sell just because “it’s their home,”
remind them that it is only a house and that the next house they move
into will provide the same opportunities to create wonderful memories.
This is a harder obstacle to overcome when the house has been in the
family for many years or generations.
Sometimes, you can convince the homeowners to list their house right away
by explaining that having more time to market the home gives them a better
chance of selling it for full market value. Waiting to list could back the owners
into the corner of being forced to accept less than market value or losing
their home outright. Keep in mind that they may need time following the offer
for a buyer to get financing and for the closing packages to be put together. 
Selling short
When the homeowners owe more on a home than what they can sell it for, you
can sometimes work a short sale with the lending institution. In a short sale,
the bank may accept less money than what is owed in order to get the bad
loan off its books, letting the homeowners off the hook. For details about short
sales, consult Chapter 15. (Negotiating a short sale takes time and patience.) 
Accepting your cash offer
When homeowners want to sell their home but they don’t have sufficient
time to sell it for market value or are not interested in going through the
hassle of selling their home, selling the house to you for cash is often a very
attractive option. The more equity the homeowners have in the house, the
more cash you can offer them for the property. In the event that one of the
homeowners died or a couple divorced, cash is often even more appealing.
To decide how much to offer for a property, check out Chapter 10.
Refinancing through you
In some situations, refinancing the mortgage through you is the best option
for the homeowners. This is often the case if the homeowners lost the prop-
erty in foreclosure but still have an opportunity to redeem it. Because they
152
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

now have a foreclosure on their credit history, they may not qualify for a loan
or the interest rates may be cost prohibitive, even if they can now afford the
monthly payments. 
Consider this somewhat common scenario. The homeowner loses his job,
loses the property at the foreclosure sale, and then gets another job that
enables him to afford the monthly payment. The homeowner can’t get loan
approval because of the foreclosure. Here’s where you step in. You buy the
property and sell it back to the owners on a land contract, trust deed, or
some other form of seller financing.
By offering an interest rate several percentage points below what they would
probably pay on a non-conforming loan from an equity lender (assuming they
could even quality for such a loan), they could keep their monthly payment
near their current level or even lower it and stay in their home. Over time,
they may even be able to rebuild their credit history and qualify for a conven-
tional loan at a lower interest. 
Your state probably has a cap on the interest you can charge on land con-
tracts. Make sure you know the rules. You don’t want to be in violation of any
usury laws (prohibiting unfair lending practices). 
For additional information and tips on how to sell a home back to the home-
owners, check out Chapter 19.
Leasing the property after selling it
Homeowners who are high credit risks — they have bad credit history, low
income, questionable job security, and little or no assets — may be able to
afford to buy back the home with a rent-to-own arrangement known as a
lease-option deal. 
In a lease-option deal, you purchase the property and lease it back to the
former owners, providing them with the option of buying it back later, if they
meet the criteria outlined in the agreement. You may or may not want to
apply all or a portion of the lease payments toward the purchase price if your
customers exercise their option. See Chapter 18 for more information about
lease-option deals.
Selling the home and renting it back
When homeowners can no longer afford their monthly mortgage payments
and refuse any option that requires them to vacate the premises, you may
153
Chapter 9: Contacting the Homeowners and Lenders

consider buying the property and leasing it back to them. After some time,
you can present your tenants with a couple other options:
 Purchase a less expensive house from you in the same area.
 Purchase the house back from you or sign a lease-option agreement that
enables them to rent-to-own.
Establish rental relationships only with homeowners who’ve shown that
they’ve been taking good care of the property and can afford to pay enough
rent to make the relationship profitable for you. Carefully evaluate their finan-
cial position to make sure they can afford the rent. You don’t want to put
yourself in the position of having to evict your tenants two months down the
road. For more about leasing the property back to the homeowners, see
Chapter 18.
Giving a deed in lieu of foreclosure
When the homeowner owes more on a property than what it’s worth and the
lender refuses to agree to a short sale, the best option for the homeowners
may be to offer the lender the deed in lieu of foreclosure. When homeowners
give a deed in lieu foreclosure, they relinquish ownership of the home and
walk away. 
Offering a deed in lieu of foreclosure is better than foreclosure. It’s the right
thing to do, if no other options make sense and the lender agrees to go along
with it. The lender may even report the mortgage as paid as agreed, but
there’s no guarantee. In some cases, the lender refuses to accept the deed;
for example, if the property is condemned or has some sort of environmental
problems or if the owners have other assets that the lender wants to go after.
If the homeowners have little, no, or negative equity in the property, they
may be willing to deed the property to you in exchange for your paying off
the balance of the mortgage. They do this by signing a quit claim deed. If you
accept a quit claim deed, pay off the mortgage immediately. Real estate con
artists often convince homeowners to sign a quit claim deed, promise to pay
off the mortgage, and never do.
Giving the deed in lieu of foreclosure only makes sense if the homeowners
have negative equity in the home and are near the end of the foreclosure
process. If the homeowners have time prior to the auction or during the
redemption period, they should seek other options first, such as negotiating
a short sale or selling the property themselves. Some mortgage companies
will pay for a deed in lieu of foreclosure, this may make the option more
appealing to the homeowners.
154
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Filing for bankruptcy
Bankruptcy is the option of last resort. Usually it is just a quick-fix solution
that only temporarily prevents the mortgage sale. When someone files bank-
ruptcy the court issues a stay that stops all actions. Many lending institutions
simply adjourn the foreclosure proceedings until the owner is out of bank-
ruptcy or until they can convince the court to lift the stay. The owners end up
with the same problems that drove them into bankruptcy, plus they now
have attorney fees and trustee fees to pay.
Bankruptcy, however, can be an effective tool for wiping out junior liens on a
property. This is where your relationships with bankruptcy attorneys can be
helpful to your customers. If a customer starts talking about bankruptcy,
clearly state that you’re not an attorney (unless you actually are one) and
that you believe they should talk about that option with a lawyer.
If the homeowners decide to file for bankruptcy, make sure they see a reputable
attorney. Cheap, fly-by-night legal services, commonly referred to as mills,
can churn out the necessary paperwork, but they don’t provide the appropri-
ate personal advice. Encourage the homeowners to seek out a bankruptcy
trustee or, at the very least, have several consultations with different attorneys.
Waiting (and saving) during redemption 
If you’re working the foreclosure circuit in an area with a somewhat generous
redemption period (at least three months), the homeowners have the option
of continuing to live in the house for the duration of the redemption period
without having to pay their monthly mortgage. 
In addition to buying them some time to explore options, if the homeowners
can set aside the money they would normally be paying on the mortgage,
they can sock away enough cash to pay a security deposit on a lease or to
cover an option fee to purchase a more affordable property on a lease-option
contract, as explained in Chapter 18. The problem with this option is that
homeowners whose finances are already strained may not be able to actually
set the money aside. I have seen situations in which homeowners were very
successful with this strategy, so you should present it as an option.
Doing nothing
While doing nothing isn’t really an option, unfortunately, it’s a course of action
most people in foreclosure choose to take. It’s actually the worst possible
155
Chapter 9: Contacting the Homeowners and Lenders

thing to do. Doing nothing ultimately leads to the homeowners losing their
home, any equity they have built up in it, and their ability to qualify for future
financing.
Constantly remind homeowners who are facing foreclosure that doing noth-
ing is the absolute worst course of action . . . or is it inaction? Once they lose
their house, they have no other option but to move and are in a terrible posi-
tion to do even that effectively.
Getting Inside to Take a Look Around
At some point in your dealings with the homeowners, try to get inside the
home to inspect it. If you do end up trying to buy the property from the
homeowners or later at auction, you should know the condition of what
you’re buying. If possible, inspect the home, and complete the home interior
inspection form, shown in Figure 9-9. 
If you’re a real estate agent purchasing the home at a price below market
value, you’re probably required by the laws and regulations in your state to
inform the homeowner of this fact. Have the homeowners sign a statement
that you informed them that you’re purchasing the house below market value,
and that the deal was advantageous to them because you could cash them
out quickly without any of the hassles associated with listing and selling.
Contacting the Lenders
When homeowners take out loans, they enter into legal contracts, similar in
some ways to wedding vows. As a foreclosure specialist, you may take on the
role of mediator when the marriage takes a turn for the worse. As mediator,
your job is to establish some sort of communication between the two parties
that resolves their current dispute.
You can call lenders to inform them that you are interested in the property
and willing to make deals with them during the foreclosure process, but in
order to mediate effectively between the homeowners and lenders, you must
have written permission from the homeowners. Figure 9-8 provides a permis-
sion form for the homeowners to sign.

Chapter 9: Contacting the Homeowners and Lenders

Contacting the senior lien holder
The senior lien holder (who holds the first mortgage) has the strongest posi-
tion, because they stand to take possession of the property if the homeown-
ers don’t act and nobody buys the property at auction. Most lenders don’t
want to take possession of a property, so they’re often very motivated to
resolve the situation before the sale. 
You can get in touch with the lenders either through the foreclosing attorney
(listed on the foreclosure notice) or by obtaining the lender’s phone number
from the homeowners, if you’re working with them directly. In some cases,
the bank that made the loan has a loan servicer who processes the pay-
ments. You may need to call the loan servicer to obtain the lender’s phone
number. 
Negotiation with big-time national lenders usually is not an option. It’s a
better strategy if you’re dealing with local lenders or credit unions — 
especially if you’ve established a relationship with them.
Ask the lender or attorney whether the homeowners have the following options:
 Reinstatement: How much would the homeowners have to pay and on
what date to have the loan reinstated?
 Forbearance: Is the lender willing to work with the homeowners to
restructure the payments and perhaps delay payment for a period of
time to enable the homeowners to establish their financial footing? 
What can they offer?
 Short sale: Is the lender willing to accept something less than the full
mortgage amount currently due? 
When negotiating a short sale, you usually need to make an offer of how much
the homeowners or you are willing to pay. Work the numbers as explained in
Chapter 10. You can often strengthen your position by having an appraisal or
an offer to purchase the property that shows the lender that she’s unlikely to
get more money than you are offering if the lender goes through with the
foreclosure. When submitting an offer, send it to both the lender and the fore-
closing attorney, so all interested parties are aware of your offer.
Contacting the junior lien holders
Any lien holder can lay claim to a property for the payment of an unpaid debt.
Even if you purchase the senior lien, a junior lien holder may choose to redeem
158
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

your lien in order to protect his interest. The more effectively you can negoti-
ate with these lien holders from your position of power as the senior lien
holder, the more likely you can ultimately take possession of the property
uncontested.
Because junior lien holders are likely to have their liens wiped out at the fore-
closure sale, they’re usually much more willing to negotiate. When you call
junior lien holders, let them know the following:
 Their claim may be wiped out during foreclosure proceedings.
 You are willing to work deals with them.
 You will let them know when you find their interests at risk because of
foreclosure proceedings on future properties.
 You would like the opportunity to list any properties they plan on selling.
Junior lien holders are often willing to accept payments of 50–80 percent less
than what they’re owed, but your strategy my vary depending on whether
your state has a redemption period:
 In states with no redemption period, you have more power to negotiate
in the days leading up to the auction, because if the property ends up
selling at auction, any junior liens are wiped out and the junior lien hold-
ers often stand to get nothing. 
 In states with a redemption period, you gain bargaining power the closer
you get to the last day of the redemption period, because if the junior
lien holder has only two options — accept a payout from you or redeem
your position and end up with a house he may not want the hassle of
fixing up and selling. 
For details about junior liens and information on how to negotiate short
sales, skip ahead to Chapter 15.

Analyzing the Deal and 
Presenting Your Offer
In This Chapter
 Filling out the deal analysis worksheet
 Analyzing the homeowners’ position
 Listing the homeowners’ most feasible options
 Preparing and presenting a purchase agreement
A
t least three parties share an interest in the outcome of the pre-auction
foreclosure — the homeowners, the lenders, and you. As a foreclosure
investor, your mission is to craft a deal that satisfies all three parties. The
homeowners may salvage their credit and cash out some or all of the equity
in the property, the lenders trim their losses to a satisfactory amount and
remove the bad loan from their books, and you walk away with the property
or a consulting fee and the satisfaction of having done a good deed.
In this chapter, I show you how to take the information you gathered in
Chapters 7 and 9 and any additional information you may have collected on
your own and complete a deal analysis worksheet. With this worksheet in
hand, you can determine which options are best for the homeowner, for the
lenders, and for yourself.
If the homeowners decide to accept a cash offer from you, I show you the
basics of drawing up a purchase agreement to make the transaction official
and closing on the deal.
Completing the Deal Analysis Worksheet
With the foreclosure information sheet and exterior inspection report from
Chapter 7 and the homeowner information sheet and interior inspection report
from Chapter 9, you now have the details you need to analyze the deal and

determine which options are best for the homeowners, the lien holders, and
yourself.
The deal analysis worksheet, shown in Figure 10-1, assists you in consolidat-
ing the information you gathered and analyzing that information. In the fol-
lowing sections, I lead you through the worksheet and explain the significance
of each of its sections. For now, complete the first three lines of the worksheet
to record the homeowners’ names, the property address, and the homeown-
ers’ home, work, and mobile phone numbers.
Calculating the homeowners’ 
equity in the property
As a property increases in value and you pay down the principle on the mort-
gage, you build up equity in the property. Equity is the amount of money
you’d have if you sold the property and paid off the total amount you bor-
rowed against the property.
By knowing ahead of time exactly how much a property is worth and how
much the homeowners owe on it, you can calculate a rough estimate of the
equity they have built up in the property and be in a better position to assess
their situation and present them with viable options.
The less equity a homeowner has in a property, the less attractive are the
homeowner’s options. With little, no, or negative equity, the homeowners are
likely to lose the property and walk away with nothing. Homeowners facing
foreclosure often are unaware of the power of the equity they have in their
homes. You may have to explain what equity is and how it can open up their
options to them. However, if they wait too long, and the property is auctioned
off, they can end up losing all of their hard-earned equity. 
Guesstimating the “as is” market value
The market value of a property is always a best-guess estimate. As most real
estate agents can tell you, a property’s value is equivalent to whatever a
buyer is willing to pay for it and a seller is willing to sell it for. To evaluate the
market and estimate a realistic resale value, research the following and add
the results of your research to your property dossier:
 Actual sales prices of comparable homes that have recently sold in the
same area.
 Asking prices of comparable homes currently for sale in the same area.

Chapter 10: Analyzing the Deal and Presenting Your Offer

While checking the recent sales prices of comparable homes, check the
health of the market, too. Look at the number of sales per month and sales
values of comparable homes over the last six months, three months, and 
30 days. A steady increase in sales volume and prices is a great sign. If the
numbers are flat, the market is in decent shape. If you see a large volume of
sales six months ago but few over the last 30 to 60 days, that may indicate a
slowing market you should either avoid (until it bottoms out) or account for
when you purchase properties.
If you’re not too sure about your ability to assess the market value of a par-
ticular property, consult a real estate agent in the area. An appraiser may be
able to provide an estimated market value, but if he can’t get inside to inspect
the condition of the property, his guess is probably no better than yours. 
You can check the market value of comparable homes in your area online at
sites like HurryHome.com or Zillow.com, but obtaining MLS listings from a
real estate agent in the area typically provides you with the most recent and
accurate sales figures for comparable properties. 
Real estate agents work on commission. Don’t waste their time by having
them run comparables without steering some paying work their way. You
may have more success by telling the agent that you will eventually list the
property with him in return for his work up front. That way he feels as if he’s
generating business and not just being used for his access to the MLS.
Calculating the amount owed on the property
Calculating the amount that the homeowners currently owe on their home is
fairly easy, assuming you know of all the liens on the property. With the assis-
tance and permission of the homeowners, you can call the lien holders and
find out how much the homeowners currently owe on each loan. For tips on
how to obtain the homeowners’ permission to contact their lenders, see
Chapter 9.
If you can’t get permission, you can still come close by adding up all the 
liens and subtracting any principle the homeowners are likely to have paid
down. If in doubt, default to the face value of the liens (assume no payments
were made). Your estimate is likely to be high, but it gives you a number to
work from.
Tally up the numbers, and you know how much the homeowners owe in total.
Now, subtract the total from the home’s estimated market value, and you
have the amount of equity built up in the property. 
164
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Calculating your top cash offer
Your goal in any real estate investment property should be to earn no less
than 20 percent on your total investment. In other words, you should be
fairly certain that you can sell the property for 20 percent more than the
entire amount of money you’ve invested in it, including:
 Amount paid for the property
 Payments to lien holders to pay off loans and back taxes
 Cost of repairs and renovations
 Holding costs (monthly loan interest, taxes, insurance, and utilities) to
cover the time between when you buy the property and when you sell it
 Costs of buying and selling the property
Don’t be blind to opportunities just because they don’t ring the magical 20
percent bell. You need a tighter budget to profit on low-priced properties, but
when you’re dealing with million dollar properties, a 15-percent return may
be worth exploring. When investing in these ritzy neighborhoods, however,
keep in mind that putting all your eggs in one basket may be risky and often
ties up a lot of cash. Know what you’re getting into before you get into it.
Take the following steps to calculate your top cash offer:
1. Guesstimate how much you can sell the house for after repairs and
renovations. (Base your guess on the recent sales prices of comparable
homes in the same area. Guess low on price and high on costs.)
2. Multiply the amount from Step 1 by one of the following:
• .80 in a market where homes values are rising
• .70 to .75 in a market where home values are steady
• .65 to .75 in a market where home values are declining
• .50 to .65 depending on the percentage profit you want to make
3. Subtract the amount of money required to pay off back taxes and
other liens.
4. Subtract the closing costs for purchasing the property.
5. Subtract renovation expenses × 1.2 (to add 20 percent for unexpected
cost overruns).
165
Chapter 10: Analyzing the Deal and Presenting Your Offer

6. Subtract monthly holding costs (interest, insurance, property taxes,
utilities) times the number of months you plan on owning the house.
Figure on at least three months.
7. Subtract agent commissions and/or marketing and advertising costs.
8. Subtract closing costs for selling the property.
The resulting dollar figure is the maximum amount of cash you can pay for
the property to be fairly certain of earning a 20 percent profit.
Logging the loan status
Under Loan Status, check the box next to the option that represents the cur-
rent status of the mortgage that’s in foreclosure:
 Delinquent: The payment is delinquent, the lender is foreclosing, and a
date has been set for the sale.
 REJ — Redemption: REJ stands for Real Estate in Judgment. The fore-
closure sale already occurred, and the homeowners are currently in the
redemption period.
 Terminal: The homeowners have run out of options, and the only option
left is for them to sell the property to an investor.
Determining options based on 
LTV (loan-to-value)
To evaluate the risk level of a loan, lenders often evaluate the LTV 
(loan-to-value) — the amount of the loan compared to the value of the prop-
erty. The lower the LTV, the less the risk. For example, an LTV of 40 percent
on a $200,000 property means that the owners owe only $80,000. If they
default on the loan, the bank has a pretty good chance of recouping the full
amount they borrowed. With an LTV of 90 percent, however, the owners
would owe $180,000 on the property, making the risk much higher.
One of the best ways to determine which options are viable for distressed
homeowners is to examine their LTV. The lower the LTV, the more attractive
the options:
 Low: With a low LTV, homeowners have substantial equity in the prop-
erty and have three attractive options — cash buy (sell the house to
you), refinance, or list the property and sell it to cash out their equity.
166
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

 Marginal: With an LTV in the mid-range, refinancing or listing the prop-
erty are the two best options for the homeowners in most cases. If you
can work a short sale with one or more lenders, a cash buy may be 
feasible.
 High: A high LTV indicates that the homeowners have little, no, or nega-
tive equity in the property and few attractive options. In such cases, a
deed in lieu of foreclosure, a short sale, or selling the house at a loss
may be the only options.
Assessing the homeowners’ credit health
You may decide to give some homeowners a break if they have a strong
credit history leading up to this financial fiasco and if their financial future
looks fairly solid. To take the homeowners’ credit pulse, answer the Yes/No
questions below Homeowner Credit on the deal analysis worksheet:
 Does homeowner make payments in a timely manner? Prior to default-
ing on the current loan, did the homeowners generally make their pay-
ments on time?
 Does homeowner have some bad credit? If the homeowner is in foreclo-
sure, he has some bad credit, but you can order a credit report to see
details. Sometimes, a homeowner has bad credit due to a temporary job
loss, but has a new job now that makes them a low-risk borrower,
although it doesn’t say so on paper.
 Any judgments, collections, tax liens on credit report? Assist the
homeowners in obtaining their free credit reports, as explained in
Chapter 5, and inspect the reports for any warning signs.
 Any bankruptcy? Bankruptcy filings in the past are often an indication
of future problems. 
 Was bad credit a one-time problem? If this bad credit was a one-time
problem, and the homeowners have a fairly stable income, they may rep-
resent a fairly low credit risk.
The answers to these questions help you paint a financial portrait of the
homeowners to assist you in determining the types of options you want to
offer them. If the homeowners have a terrible credit history and not much
promise of future income, you probably don’t want to set them up with a
lease-option contract or rental agreement, because that’s like to set up them
and you for future failure. If, however, the homeowners have experienced a
temporary financial setback and have the resources in place to recover their
footing, you may want to help them regain their footing.
167
Chapter 10: Analyzing the Deal and Presenting Your Offer

Gauging the homeowners’ wants
The homeowners own the property and the problem, so the decision of what
to do is ultimately theirs to make. Always ask the homeowners what they
want to do. Do they want to keep the home, sell it, relocate? Can they afford
the current payments if the lender would be willing to make some arrangements
on paying back the past due amounts? Could they afford a lesser payment? 
Although what the homeowners want is often unrealistic, ask the questions
and jot down the answers so you know. You may not be able to deliver what
they want, but with a little creativity, you may be able to get pretty close. 
Determining the homeowners’ 
gross monthly income
One last key piece of information you need to complete the homeowners’
financial portrait is the homeowner status. This consists of three pieces of
information:
 Employment: Is at least one homeowner employed?
 Gross monthly income: What is the total gross monthly income of the
homeowners? (Include “side jobs” if they regularly make extra money
working on the side.)
 Marriage/divorce status: If the homeowners are currently married, are
they going through a divorce?
You don’t want to get into a situation with the homeowners in which you’re
offering them a lease option agreement or renting them the house if they
have no income to pay you or if they’re going through a messy divorce that’s
almost certain to wreck their finances.
Assessing the Homeowners’ Options
Based on the information in the deal analysis worksheet, you can develop a
pretty clear idea of which options are available to the homeowners. In
Chapter 9, I describe these options in detail. Here, I list the options again and
provide guidelines on which options are best, based on the homeowners’ sit-
uation and resources:
168
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

 Reinstating the loan: For homeowners who owe relatively little and can
obtain financial help from family and friends, this is the best option. The
homeowners don’t have to move and usually retain the same mortgage
with the same interest rate; although they may have to pay some late
fees and attorney fees. Homeowners are often reluctant to seek assis-
tance from even very close friends and relatives. In Chapter 9, I offer
some tips on how to encourage them to ask for help. 
 Negotiating with the lenders for a forbearance: Again, if the home-
owners have a fairly solid financial future, the lender may agree to a for-
bearance and provide a payment schedule that’s suitable for the home-
owners. Make sure the homeowners agree to a payment schedule they
can afford, because they won’t get a second chance. Also everything
needs to be in writing, and the homeowners must understand every-
thing they’re agreeing to.
 Listing the property: When the homeowners can’t afford the mortgage
payments and probably won’t be able to afford the mortgage payments
in the near future, then selling the property is usually the most prudent
option. This is only an option if the homeowners have sufficient time 
to list, sell, and close. If they run out of time, they may lose a pending
sale, their house, and any equity they have built up in it. Time is of the
essence.
 Refinancing the mortgage: Homeowners who have substantial equity
built up in their property may be able to refinance their way out of fore-
closure by taking out a mortgage to consolidate their outstanding debt.
Calculate the homeowners’ totally monthly payments. If they can pay off
all of their debt with a new mortgage that requires a lower total monthly
payment, they may be able to keep their home. The problem with this
option is that usually by the time the homeowner trys to initiate some-
thing, their payment history is downgraded to “slow pay” at best, and
they may have other issues with their credit history, so they can almost
count on a higher interest rate. Make sure the homeowners can afford
the higher payment — most cannot.
 Selling short: When homeowners have insufficient equity built up in a
property, they probably face a situation in which they simply lose the
home and have no money to move on. If you can negotiate a short sale
by convincing the lenders to accept less than full payment, you may be
able to work a deal in which you can pay the homeonwers a little extra
for the house and save enough money by paying off the reduced loan
amounts to make the deal profitable for you.
 Accepting your cash offer: Cash offers are often best if the LTV is low,
the homeowners have little time to market and sell the property, and the
home requires some major repairs or renovations to make it marketable.
169
Chapter 10: Analyzing the Deal and Presenting Your Offer

 Opting for a lease-option agreement: The homeowner sells you the house,
and then you sell the house back to the homeowner on a rent-to-own
basis. See Chapter 19 for details.
 Selling the home and renting it back: If the homeowners have sufficient
income to pay rent, you may consider renting the home to them after
you buy it. Chapter 19 covers this option in more detail.
 Giving a deed in lieu of foreclosure: Negative equity is a pretty good
sign that the homeowners may benefit by offering the lender a deed in
lieu of foreclosure. The lender, however, may refuse the offer.
 Filing for bankruptcy: Bankruptcy is rarely a good option. It ruins the
homeowners’ credit and simply delays the inevitable. However, if the
homeowners choose this option, check the Bankruptcy box, recommend
a good bankruptcy attorney, thank the homeowners for their time, and
let them know that you’re interested in purchasing the property if they
decide to sell it later. Keep in touch with the bankruptcy attorney — you
may be able to purchase the property later.
 Nothing/Pass: If the homeowners choose to do nothing or you can come
up with no creative way to assist them, check the Nothing/Pass box and
move on. Keep tracking the property just in case anything changes or
the home goes to auction.
Have the homeowners sign and date the Deal Analysis Worksheet at the very
bottom stating that they have read and understand the options described.
Consider creating an audio recording of your conversation. Ask the home-
owners whether recording the conversation would be okay in order to pro-
tect their interests and yours from any future confusion over who said what.
Make sure the recording states the names of all those present and that they
are aware the conversation is being recorded. State the date and time of the
recording, and then set the recorder on the table and converse naturally.
Presenting Your Offer: The Purchase
Agreement
Whenever you buy a home directly from the homeowners, you must present
out the terms and conditions of the sale and transfer of the property from the
seller to the buyer.
Purchase agreements are fairly standard documents, but they vary from one
area to another. Ask your real estate agent or attorney for a copy of the pur-
chase agreement used in your area.
170
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

With the assistance of your real estate attorney, prepare and present the pur-
chase agreement to the homeowners. Your area may have special laws gov-
erning the sale of property during the foreclosure process, so be sure your
attorney checks the agreement and reviews any special issues you need to be
aware of.
Your purchase agreement should including the following details:
 Purchase price you are offering.
 Statement that the homeowners are aware that they agree to sell the
property below market value.
 Conditional clause, commonly referred to as a weasel clause, that pro-
vides you with an exit if something goes wrong. A good condition to add
is “Sale is conditional upon review and approval of my attorney.” (Most
purchase agreements have conditions built in to them, such as “sale is
conditional upon home passing inspection.”)
 Date of possession — the date the current residents and their posses-
sions are to move out and you can start working on the property.
 A list of anything in the home not nailed down that is to stay with the
property, such as appliances, furniture, or furnishings.
 The agreed-upon condition of the property when transferred to you. You
may indicate “current condition or better” or “broom clean.” 
 A statement that the buyer is responsible for all closing costs.
 A statement that the seller shall deed the property to the buyer.
 A statement that the buyer may resell the property.
 Amount of earnest money deposit, if any. To prove that you’re serious
about the purchase, provide an earnest money deposit to be held by
your attorney or the title company and to be released on condition of a
successful closing. (Sometimes you need to give some cash to the home-
owner, because they are really strapped — keep that amount as small as
possible, because any money you give to the homeowner is at risk.)
Normally, I recommend a fairly substantial EMD (earnest money deposit)
when making an offer on a property you really want to show the sellers that
you’re serious and you have the money to close the deal — something other
buyers may not have. In the case of buying foreclosure properties directly
from homeowners, the EMD doesn’t carry much weight if nobody else is pre-
senting an offer — $1,000 is usually sufficient. If an agent is representing the
homeowners, the EMD can range from 3–10 percent.
Consider adding a penalty or bonus to the purchase agreement to encourage
the current owners to move out on time and leave the property in excellent
171
Chapter 10: Analyzing the Deal and Presenting Your Offer

condition. For example, you may stipulate that $1,000 is to be withheld and
paid when the property is vacated in reasonable condition or an extra $500 is
to be paid if the homeowners vacate on time and leave the premises broom
clean. Be candid and tell them that you will pay the extra money, but only if
they do what you both agree on. If they perform, you’ll perform. You may
even make a check out to them in advance and show it to them — tell them
that when they fulfill their end of the bargain, you’ll hand over the check.
That way, they see you’re not stringing them along.
All owners listed on the mortgage must sign the purchase agreement. If a
couple owns the property, both the husband and wife must sign the purchase
agreement. 
If the auction date is fast approaching, you may be able to secure an adjourn-
ment by presenting the attorney who’s representing the lender with a signed
purchase agreement. This provides the lender with some assurance that the
mortgage will be paid in full at closing. During the closing, funds are distributed
to the lenders to pay off the loans, and the lenders provide payoff letters —
written proof that the loans have been satisfied. Don’t be shocked if the attor-
ney still wants to proceed to sale, especially in states with redemption peri-
ods. The lender doesn’t want to lose time in case your deal doesn’t close.
Even if you do have a legally binding purchase agreement with the homeown-
ers, other investors may step in and offer the homeowners a little more money
or do something else to convince the homeowners to want to back out of the
deal. You can certainly make your case to the homeowners, but if they decide
they want to sell to another investor, I recommend that you let them. Trying
to legally enforce your purchase agreement against a homeowner in foreclo-
sure who has a better deal on the table doesn’t exactly look good in the eyes
of the court, even if you’ve acted on the level. 
Closing Time
As soon as you and the homeowners agree on the price, terms, and condi-
tions stated on the purchase agreement, contact your attorney or title com-
pany to arrange the closing and set a closing date. Your attorney or closing
agent can provide you and the homeowners with the paperwork, so you can
review it ahead of time.
On the day of the closing, the property is deeded over to you. You pay the
sellers the agreed-upon price (typically in the form of a cashier’s check), and
you or the homeowners pay off the agreed upon balance of any loans taken
out against the property. The title company will collect all the money, pay off
the loans (liens), and record the deed in your name. 
172
Part III: Creating Win-Win Situations in Pre-Foreclosure (Prior to Auction) 

Always purchase title insurance and hire a title company to handle the clos-
ing. This ensures everyone who is owed money is paid, that you’re insured if
anyone lays claim to the property after closing, and makes sure that the
paperwork is properly recorded. If you close without a title company (against
my recommendation) don’t allow the seller to be the one who pays off the
loans after closing. 
Don’t forget to obtain the keys from the sellers. Also, before leaving the clos-
ing table, call the utility companies and have the water, electricity, and gas
service transferred to your name. Many buyers overlook this important step.
Changing the locks immediately is not a bad idea. You never expect to have a
problem, but if you get into some disagreement with the homeowners near
the end of the deal, a disgruntled homeowner with an extra key can cause a
problem. Protect your investment. Change the locks, but keep the old ones
(especially if they’re in good shape) — you may be able use them on the next
house. I tape the keys to the lockset and put the whole cluster in a safe place,
hopefully one you’ll remember. The next house I buy, if the lockset matches,
I’m ready to go.

lthough stepping into the foreclosure process at the
pre-foreclosure stage is usually the optimum strat-
egy, you may be a little uncomfortable dealing with the
emotions of distressed homeowners. If the pre-foreclosure
stage doesn’t interest you, you can find plenty of profitable
opportunities during and even after the foreclosure sale.
In this part, I show you how to find and buy properties at
auction, from lenders and other institutions that repos-
sess properties or seize them, and from trustees during
bankruptcy. I also reveal some additional ways to profit
from the foreclosure process without necessarily taking

W
hen most people think “foreclosure investing,” they think “auction” —
a bidding free-for-all where you can purchase properties at bargain-
basement prices simply by showing up with a wad of cash. Unfortunately,
this is the kind of thinking that gets novice investors into trouble. Without
the proper know-how, a knowledge of what you’re bidding on, and some self-
restraint, you can really get burned at an auction.
In this chapter, I steer you clear of the most common pitfalls and toward the
most promising prospects. Here I show you how to properly prepare for a
foreclosure sale, so you don’t get sucked into a bidding war you’re destined
to lose. I show you how to calculate and stick to your maximum bid, assist
you in packing for auction day, reveal some bidding strategies from a seasoned
veteran, and lead you through the process of paying for and holding a prop-
erty through the redemption period . . . if your area has a redemption period. 
When bidding at a foreclosure sale, keep in mind that you’re bidding on mort-
gages, loans, or tax deeds, not properties. As a beginner, bid only on first
mortgages or tax liens, which are less risky investments. When you’re more
experienced, you can enter into the complex areas of investing in second
mortgages or construction liens. Whatever lien position you’re bidding on,
you should know all the positions, and what owning/holding that position
means, so you don’t run into problems later.

Tracking Down Auction Dates, 
Times, and Places
When a lender posts a foreclosure notice or notice of default (NOD), the notice
typically specifies the auction date, time, and place. Chapter 8 shows a typi-
cal foreclosure notice and highlights the important bits of information it con-
tains. If the place isn’t specified, contact the county’s register of deeds and ask
where the auctions are typically held. In most areas, auctions are held at the
courthouse. In some counties, auctions may be held at the property’s location. 
A couple days prior to the scheduled sale date, call the attorney who’s han-
dling the sale and ask the following questions:
 Is the mortgage going to be auctioned at the advertised date and
time? The sale may be canceled or adjourned if the homeowners filed
for bankruptcy or worked out a deal with the lender.
 What’s the opening bid? The opening bid is the balance of the loan
that’s in foreclosure plus any interest and penalties. The day before the
sale, the attorney should be able to supply you with a fairly accurate
amount for the opening bid.
Write this information in the folder you created for the property in Chapter 7.
If the attorney seems reluctant to tell you the opening bid amount, politely let
him know that you intend to bid and that your bank needs time to issue a check
for the certified funds. Most attorneys will cooperate with serious bidders —
after all, their clients (the mortgage companies) need investors to bid on
properties. If you win the bid, the next time you call, mention that you bought
a property that their firm represented before. This is a huge boost to your
credibility. Next time, you won’t face such a hassle.
Several days before attending your first auction, contact the sheriff’s office or
whoever’s in charge of handling the auction in your county and find out
about what you need to bring to the auction and how the bidding works. The
following list gets you up to speed on the basics of what you can expect:
 In some areas, you may need to register ahead of time.
 You need some form of identification, typically a driver’s license, but
find out for sure.
 The day prior to the auction, call the foreclosing attorney for any of the
properties you intend to bid on, find out the opening bid amount, and
178
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

head down to your bank to obtain a cashier’s check for an amount that
exactly matches the opening bid amount. 
You need a cashier’s check for every property you intend to bid on. If
your check is off by a small amount, the sheriff may allow you to make
up the difference in cash, but they do not accept large amounts of cash.
If you’re the successful bidder with an overbid amount of more than one
dollar, then you usually have a period of time ranging from one hour to
the end of the day to get that amount in. If you win the bid for “plus a
dollar,” which is one dollar more than opening bid, which means nobody
bid against you, have small bills on you to pay that amount immediately.
 Some counties require that you show proof of certified funds either
before the sale, at the time you bid, or immediately after the sale. 
Don’t bid if you don’t have the required certified funds. Not only do you
risk losing the property and perhaps getting into some legal mess with the
lender and the court, but you could also be banned from future auctions.
 Some counties have minimum bid raises to speed up the process of bid-
ding; for example, after someone bids $1 over the opening bid, subse-
quent bids may need to be in increments of $100 or $500 higher, or the
auctioneer may specify the incremental raise on the fly.
Know exactly what to expect on sale day, so you can remain calm during the
bidding process. Some veteran bidders may try to fluster you by asking the
auctioneer to verify your funds or ensure that you meet some other require-
ment. This may seem silly, but if they have the auctioneer question you about
something you know nothing about, you may begin to wonder if you’re into
something that’s way over your head, and you may not bid. 
Preparing Your Maximum Bid
One of the biggest mistakes you can make at an auction is to start bidding
without a concrete ceiling defining just how high you can bid. Set your maxi-
mum bid to ensure a 20 percent profit or better, then stick to it. (That means
a 20 percent profit on your total investment. It does not mean that you can
bid up to 80 percent of the property’s value.) In the following sections, I lead
you through the process of determining your maximum bid. 
Write down your maximum bid in the folder for the property and recommit
yourself to that amount before bidding begins. If you think you may be
tempted to bid in excess of your upper limit, take someone along with you to
act as your conscience and rein you in if your exuberance seems to be over-
stepping your logic. 
179
Chapter 11: Bidding for Properties at a Foreclosure Sale

Guesstimating the property’s 
improved value
To calculate the maximum amount to bid on a property, start from the end
and work back. First, estimate the price you can sell the property for after
repairs and renovations. Your real estate agent can provide you with the
recent sales prices of comparable homes in the same area. Chapter 10 also
offers a discussion on how to estimate the “as is” value of a property that
provides useful tips that apply to estimating the improved value of a prop-
erty, as well.
When comparing property values, compare apples to apples. Look for homes
that have recently sold in the same area that are comparable in lot size, square
footage, house style, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and so on. Don’t
go out of your way to find comparables that justify a higher bid — that only
increases your risk of paying too much for a property.
Estimating repair and renovation costs
From your preliminary inspection of the property, you should have some 
idea of how much you can expect to pay for repairs and renovations. If you
haven’t been able to fully inspect the interior of the property, use 10 percent
as a ballpark estimate. If, for example, you’re buying a property that you are
confident you can sell for $150,000 after repairs and renovations, figure in at
least $15,000 for repairs and renovations.
When you’re purchasing a property at auction, you buy the property in “as
is” condition, so you own it no matter how much the repairs and renovations
cost. The safest route is to have the house thoroughly inspected, but that’s
not always possible, so overestimate costs to give yourself a little buffer.
Figuring in holding costs
Holding costs consist of expenses you incur between the time you purchase
the property and the time you sell it. Holding costs include the following:
 Property taxes
 Homeowner’s insurance
180
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

 Interest on any loan you took out to buy the property
 Any utilities you pay
 Recording fee and transfer tax
Water bills, at least in some states, stay with the house. In other words,
during the redemption period, while the occupants are running the water,
they’re also running up a bill that you’re likely to get stuck with. If the pipes
leak, you pay. Figure this cost into your holding costs.
Add up the monthly amount for each item in the list and multiply by the
number of months you plan on holding the property. In an area with a 6-
month redemption period, calculate holding costs for the duration of the
redemption period plus the number of months you plan to spend on renova-
tions and selling the property. 
When I flip properties, I use $100 per day as the average holding costs, but
that includes utilities. During the redemption period, you pay only property
taxes, homeowner’s insurance, and interest if you took out a loan to pay for
the property, so your holding costs may be less than $100 per day.
Make sure you know your state’s tax foreclosure process and the total taxes
owed on the property before you bid. If the tax redemption period runs out
during your redemption period and you didn’t pay the taxes to protect your
investment, the foreclosing bank or mortgage company thanks you for your
donation, and you just lost your collateral. Tax liens trump most every other
lien, so be aware of any unpaid property taxes.
Subtracting agent commissions 
and closing costs
I strongly recommend that after you fix up your fixer-upper, you list it with
one of the top seller’s agents in your market. On average, an agent can sell a
home in half the time and for more money than you can sell it for on your
own, which not only increases the sale price but also cuts your holding costs.
In most areas, the standard real estate commission is 6–8 percent of the sales
price, but you may be able to negotiate commissions if you give the agent
lots of work.
You’re also likely to pay closing costs at the time of the sale. Consult your
attorney or title company for an estimate of closing costs. 
181
Chapter 11: Bidding for Properties at a Foreclosure Sale

Arriving at your maximum bid amount
Estimating the future sales price of the property and all expenses related to
buying, fixing up, and selling the property is the tough part. Once you have
the required numbers, calculating your maximum bid amount comes down to
performing some basic math:
1. Start with the future sales price of the home after improvements.
2. For an estimated profit of at least 20 percent, divide the amount from
Step 1 by one of the following:
• 1.20 in a market where homes values are rising. (To shoot for a 
20 percent return on your investment.)
• 1.25 in a market where home values are steady. (To shoot for a 
25 percent return.)
• 1.30 in a market where home values are declining. (To shoot for a
30 percent return.) 
• 1.35 to 1.50 depending on the percentage profit you want to make.
(To shoot for a 35–50 percent return.)
The resulting number shows you how much you can afford to
invest in the property to earn the desired 20 percent return. In a
hot market, you shoot for a 20 percent return. In a slower market,
you have to aim for a higher return (say 25 percent) in order to hit
the goal of making 20 percent.
3. Subtract any back taxes you will be responsible for paying when you
purchase the property.
4. Subtract estimated costs for repairs and renovations.
5. Subtract monthly holding costs.
6. Subtract agent commissions and/or marketing and advertising costs.
7. Subtract closing costs for selling the property.
The result gives you a general idea of how much to offer for the property to
be fairly certain you can profit at least 20 percent from the transaction. Check
out my site www.GetFlipping.com, where I provide a handy Purchase Price
Estimator that can do the calculations for you.
Be realistic. Your chances of earning a 40–50 percent profit on a property 
are very low. You’d have to buy the property for less than 50 cents on the
dollar at sale. It’s possible. I’ve done it a couple times, but it’s the exception
to the rule.

Chapter 11: Bidding for Properties at a Foreclosure Sale
Snagging a diamond in the rough
Your best chance of bagging a deal that gives
you a 50 percent or better profit is to do great
research and track adjournments. By “track
adjournments,” I mean keep track of properties
that were scheduled to go to sale but had their
sales adjourned for some reason or another.
Most investors lose interest after the adjourn-
ment, leaving some low-hanging fruit that’s easy
pickins.
Once, I researched a house that sat on a 2.8-
acre lot in a very prestigious and highly sought
after area in Oakland County. The house was
not much to speak of — a smaller ranch style
home — but the land was a goldmine. The
neighborhood was dotted with multimillion-
dollar homes that were all designed by famous
architects. Nestled amongst these valuable
gems was that little old ranch house — the dia-
mond in the rough. Because of my experience I
knew developers would be knocking my door
down to get their hands on such a valuable
parcel. 
I expected very stiff competition at the sale, so
I did my homework. When I called the attorney,
he informed me that the home wouldn’t be going
to sale that week. Still, an extraordinarily large
crowd showed up at the sale that week all
anticipating the bidding to start on this property.
When it didn’t come up for auction, they all mut-
tered under their breaths and wondered what
had just happened. 
Fortunately, I knew what happened and what to
do about it. I continued to track that property for
the better part of six months, calling on it every
week to see if it was going to come up for sale
that week. Then one week I heard what I had
been waiting for — “Yes, actually this will be up
for sale, and here is the opening bid.” When that
woman at the attorney’s office gave me that
opening bid, my heart started to flutter, and that
doesn’t happen too much anymore. The reason
was that I knew anyone that had been inter-
ested in that property had long since given up
and forgotten about it. 
That morning at sale, I quietly bid the opening
bid plus $1.00 and picked up the “diamond in the
rough” I’d been waiting for. Those in the audi-
ence were stunned. Some thought I had lost my
mind and bid on something that I shouldn’t have,
but there was at least one person I overheard
say to their neighbor, “I’ve been coming here for
a while, that was no mistake, he knows some-
thing we don’t.” He was right, my hard work and
diligence paid off, and did it ever! 
Within a week of the property not being
redeemed, I had a rock-solid cash offer for
$350,000 from a developer who was going to
tear down the house and build another one that
would “better fit in with the neighbors.” I prob-
ably could have held out for more, but you strike
while the iron is hot... so I’ve been told. Oh, by
the way I paid just over $150,000 for the property
at sale. 
Keep tracking the properties after adjournment
and continue to bring the property dossier (see
Chapter 8) to the auctions with you, so that you’ll
be prepared if the property becomes available.
You may be carrying ten, twenty, or a hundred
property dossiers to the auction with you,
depending on the size of your market, but at
least you won’t miss out because you weren’t
prepared.

The following example shows the maximum bid amount for a $150,000 prop-
erty in a stable market with $5,000 in unpaid taxes, assuming a 10 percent
allowance for repairs and renovations and a 3-month holding period:
Final improved sales price
$150,000.00
Increasing market
dv 1.20
Total
$125,000.00
Unpaid property taxes
– $5,000.00
Repairs and renovations
– $15,000.00
Holding costs
– $9,000.00
Agent commission
– $9,000.00
Closing costs
– $1,500.00
Maximum bid
$85,500.00
The opening bid may exceed your maximum bid, in which case, you sit on
your hands and either let the bank buy back the mortgage or let some other
less informed bidder buy the property and try to wring a profit out of it. If the
opening bid is lower than your maximum bid, you have some room to dive in
and start bidding. 
This is simply an example to demonstrate how to crunch numbers on a sample
property. Not all $150,000 houses are going to fit this model. A house in pris-
tine condition, for example, won’t require $15,000 in repairs, and if the taxes
have been paid up, you may save a little there, as well, and be able to bid a
little higher at auction. Our Purchase Price Estimator at www.GetFlipping.
com can also be used to calculate a maximum bid amount — check it out.
Make sure you’re bidding on a first mortgage and not a second mortgage or
some other lien. Many beginners get burned by purchasing a junior lien think-
ing they’re getting a great deal when, in fact, they’re paying tens of thousands
of dollars for a piece of paper that is likely to be worth nothing after the first
mortgage is foreclosed on. You can buy a junior lien to control the senior lien,
but that’s an advanced move for more experienced investors. See Chapter 19
for details.
Bidding at a Foreclosure Auction
You’ve done your homework. You inspected the property’s title and other
paperwork. You visited the property to perform an onsite inspection.
Perhaps you even talked with the homeowners and lien holders. You now
184
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

have a property dossier packed with the information you need to make a
well-educated investment decision. 
Now, it’s show time! Time to pack your briefcase full of your property
research and head out to the foreclosure auction for an afternoon of bidding.
Packing for an auction
A couple days prior to auction day, start packing, so just in case you don’t
have everything you need, you have time to get it. Here’s a list of everything
you should bring with you on auction day:
 All of the foreclosure property dossiers you assembled in Chapter 7.
(Bring all of them, not just the properties you plan to bid on.)
 Paper and two pens or pencils to take notes.
 A calculator.
 A cashier’s check for sufficient funds to cover a purchase, if you plan on
bidding. Have the check made out to yourself in the amount necessary
to cover the opening bid. If you win the bid, you can endorse the check.
(In the following sections, I suggest you sit in on a few auctions as an
observer before you start actually bidding on properties.)
185
Chapter 11: Bidding for Properties at a Foreclosure Sale
The bidder and the governor
When you decide to actually start bidding at
auctions, consider teaming up with your spouse
or someone else you trust. One of you can act
as the bidder, while the more restrained
member of the team acts as the governor. Over
the years I’ve noticed several couples employ
this very strategy. 
So, what’s a governor? A governor is used to
regulate the flow of gas or fuel to an engine, 
primarily so the engine doesn’t get too much
gas all at once. During an auction, the governor
plays a similar role, restraining the bidder 
from over-bidding. The bidder remains ready to
bid the instant she gets the go-ahead from the
governor.
I’ve seen this technique used as a method to
win bids, as well. The governor plays up the role
as restrainer, acting as though every bid is
inflicting pain, while the bidder is champing at
the bit, eager to beat any bid offered by the
competition. Just when their competition thinks
they’ve won the bid, the governor gives the nod
to bid just one more time. It can be quite a show,
but the point is, one or both of the dynamic duo
has a maximum bid, and when they pull the plug
it’s over.
Always be ready to accept losing a bid . . . if
winning is going to cost you.

Sitting in on a few auctions
For your first three or four auctions, I suggest you observe and take notes:
 Who’s running the sale?
 Who’s bidding?
 Who’s just watching?
 What are the winning bids on the properties you researched? Jot down
the winning bid in the property’s dossier.
If someone shows up at one auction and bids on a single property, that
person may be an attorney representing the bank. The people who show up
every week and bid on properties consistently are foreclosure investors.
They’re the real deal. These are the people you want to watch, talk with, and
learn from. 
Wait at least four auctions before you start interacting with anybody. You can
say “Hi” exchange the usual pleasantries, but avoid getting into any deep con-
versations about real estate investing. People who often appear to be know-it-
alls and don’t actually buy and sell properties can fill your head with all sorts
of confusing misinformation.
Crafting a winning bidding strategy
Foreclosure auctions are serious business in which the high bidder stands to
acquire a valuable property at well below market value or pay way too much
for a worthless piece of paper. It’s no board game, and the money’s real, so
developing an effective bidding strategy is key.
Every bidder has a unique strategy and various techniques for psyching out
the competition. Here are some common strategies you may want to try:
 Bore ’em into submission: Keep outbidding the highest bidder by the
minimum bid. If the minimum increment is $10, whenever someone
makes a bid, bid $10 more. Just don’t exceed your maximum.
 Go all in: Open with an outrageously high bid to shock the competition
into silence. This tactic is usually a very bad idea, because it can result
in paying thousands of dollars more than necessary. If you’re trying to
scare off a novice and you know that the property is going to sell for
thousands more than the opening bid, you may want to make a dramatic
leap, but avoid starting with your maximum bid.
 Speak softly and carry a big wad of cash: Quiet bidding often conveys
confidence and can undercut the high-energy, emotional tone of the 
186
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

auction. It forces other bidders to ask, “What did he bid?” which can be
a little unsettling and give you the edge you need.
 Crank the volume: Bark your bids as if you’re a mad dog in control of
the room. If you’ve ever had your parents yell at you, you know the
effect this technique can have. It can rattle your opponent just enough
to make him back off or make him think that you’ve lost your mind.
Either way, you’re in control.
 Mix it up: Go erratic, random. Don’t follow a pattern. As long as your
bids make sense to you without exceeding your maximum bid, experi-
ment and see what works best.
Submitting sealed bids
Some auctions require buyers to submit their bids in writing in sealed
envelopes. Once all the bids are in, they’re opened, and the property goes to
the highest bidder. If you’re buying foreclosures in an area that uses sealed
bids, you won’t be able to use the clever techniques described in the previ-
ous section.

Chapter 11: Bidding for Properties at a Foreclosure Sale
Toying with the competition
I attended an auction where I got into a bidding
war with a “bore ’em into submission” bidder
and decided to have a little fun with it. The min-
imum bid was $10. Every time I would bid, my
nemesis would bid $10 more. The bidding pro-
ceeded like this:
I opened with a bid of $120,000.
Bore ’em countered with $120,010.
I bid $130,000.
Bore ’em bid $130,010.
I bid $135,000.
Bore ’em bid $135,010.
That’s when the fun began.
I bid $139,990.
Bore ’em fidgeted during an awkward moment
of silence. The audience caught on to what was
happening, and a few people started to laugh.
Even the sheriff chuckled a little.
It took Bore ’em about a minute to calculate his
next bid: $140,000. He spent another couple min-
utes trying to figure out what was happening.
At this point, I strayed from the script. With a big
smile on my face, I announced, “Ah ha, so you
can bid in big round numbers after all!” and
then proceeded to bid $140,010, much to the
pleasure of the crowd.
Bore ’em was too flustered at this point to con-
tinue bidding. I acquired the property in addition
to my own personal following. For several
weeks after that, the crowd returned just to
watch the show.
–Anonymous bidder

Winning a sealed bid hinges on your ability to size up the competition and
how confident you are in your maximum bid. If you think the property is
going to draw a lot of competition, you may need to submit your maximum
bid. If you’re fairly certain nobody else is going to bid against you, you may
want to submit a dollar more than the opening bid amount.
If you’re constantly losing, you’re probably bidding too low. When your bid
loses, ask the sheriff or check the public records to find out how much the
winner bid. Compare that to your bid and make the necessary adjustments.
Keep in mind, however, that a winning bid doesn’t always mean the person
bid the right amount. The winner may have actually bid too much and will
suffer later when the property isn’t as profitable as expected. 
Following Up . . . After the Auction
You submitted the winning bid. Congratulations, but you’re not quite finished.
Now, you have to take several steps to pay for the property and protect your
interest in it. Proceed through the following checklist to make sure you’ve
attended to all the details:
 Follow through on the conditions of the sale. Ask the Register of Deeds
or whoever is holding the auction to supply you with a list of conditions
to finalize the sale. Read through the conditions and draw up a list of
what you have to do. Consult your attorney if you find anything confus-
ing. Once you know what to do, do it.
 Pay any remaining balance. If you didn’t have to pay the full price you
bid immediately following the auction, you have a limited time to pay off
the balance — typically less than 30 days, but in some cases you have
only a couple days or a couple hours to pay up. Be sure you pay the full
amount on time, or you may end up losing the property.
 Record the deed. Upon payment or after some period of delay, you
receive the deed to the property. As soon as possible, take the deed to
the county clerk’s office or register of deeds and have it recorded to pro-
tect your legal claim to the property. This provides extra insurance to
prevent someone from filing another deed and claiming that they actu-
ally purchased the property. Some states are “race to record” states,
meaning that the first to file the deed obtains the strongest position.
Putting off this important step could jeopardize your position. In some
counties the sheriff may record the deed.
188
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

Ask the Register of Deeds or your real estate attorney to explain the
recording requirements in your area. You usually have a grace period
from the time you receive the deed to the date on which you must
record it, but the recording date could affect the redemption period. 
In Michigan, you have 21 days to record the deed in order to have the
redemption period start from the date of sale. If you miss the deadline,
the redemption period may commence sometime after the date of sale.
 Obtain title insurance. Visit your title company and obtain title insur-
ance for the property. Using a title company that’s familiar with the fore-
closure process is best. Check any restrictions (or exceptions) on the
title insurance carefully, ask the title company representative to explain
any you don’t understand, and see if you can have them removed. If
your area has a redemption period, the title company may offer a title
commitment that takes effect only after the redemption period expires,
but this is usually not a problem. Assuming you hold the first lien posi-
tion and taxes are paid up, when the redemption period expires, other
liens will be wiped out and you are going to have full title.
 Obtain property insurance. If any major damage occurs to the property
during the redemption period, you want to have an insurance to pay for
it. Contact your insurance agent as soon as possible to obtain a policy
for the home.
 Notify any taxing authorities who have liens on the property. If the IRS
or the state has an income tax lien on the property, the foreclosing attor-
ney usually notifies the IRS prior to the sale. Make sure the IRS notice
accompanies the bidding paperwork. If the foreclosing attorney did not
notify a taxing authority who has a lien on the property, consult the fore-
closing attorney and your own attorney, if necessary. 
 Return any overbid money to the homeowners. An overbid situation
occurs if you bid more than is required to cover any liens on the prop-
erty. When a buyer submits an overbid, the homeowners have the right
to claim the overbid amount. All they have to do is go down to the court-
house, file a claim for the money, and it’s theirs. 
If someone outbids you at the auction, your area has a redemption period,
and you’re still interested in buying the property, consider writing a letter to
the homeowners informing them of their redemption rights. Figure 11-1 pro-
vides a sample letter.

Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 
Fruitless labor from a failure to follow through
I purchased the senior lien on a property at an
auction and received a sheriff’s deed that allowed
me to take possession of the property at the end
of the six-month redemption period, assuming
nobody redeemed my sheriff’s deed. I later
learned that another investor had stepped in and
bought the property directly from the homeown-
ers for about $10,000 to $15,000 cash. Typically
when this happens, the investor who purchased
from the homeowners redeems the sheriff’s deed.
In other words, this other investor needed to pay
me off before the redemption period expired.
As time passed, I watched the investor as she
slowly transformed the house from a run-down
shack into a very respectable looking home. I
was a little surprised, however, that nobody had
contacted me about redeeming my sheriff’s deed.
About five months into the redemption period,
the house was completed, and a For Sale sign
went up in the yard, but I still had not been con-
tacted about a payoff. I got a little nervous and
decided to check the title. My sheriff’s deed was
there plain as day right where it should be. No
superior liens had been placed on the property. 
The day after the redemption period expired, I
took my usual steps and filed for possession. A
couple of days later I got a call from a very dis-
traught woman. She explained to me that this
was her first investment house and that she had
learned how to “flip houses” from a late night
“real estate guru” but didn’t realize that the
deed she obtained was subject to the sheriff’s
deed, which I held. I told her that what she had
done was “lost everything.” The phone went
silent, and then under a muffled cry she asked,
“What do you mean I lost everything?” 
“Well,” I said, “I now own the house legally per
my sheriff’s deed, and you have to take down
the For Sale sign and stop trying to sell my
house.” (I was being particularly blunt, so that
she would grasp the importance of the situa-
tion.) Again, she explained how she had
intended to redeem the property, but had failed
to do so, and that she had put money into rehab,
yada yada yada. I felt really bad for her and the
position she was in, so I asked her “What would
you do if you were me?” 
She said, “I guess you could say ‘Thank you very
much for a lovely new house,’ and then sell it for
a profit, but I would like to see us be able to work
something out.” And that’s what we did. I told her
that she was definitely going to lose money, and
probably a lot of it, but that I would soften the blow
by giving her a portion of what she spent on rehab,
but that she wouldn’t be getting the profits. So, we
agreed on a dollar amount, and after selling the
property, I paid her the agreed-upon amount. She
lost all the money she paid the homeowners plus
any profits she expected to see.
Before you write me off as a total jerk, I should
explain why I acted like such a “heartless
beast.” When talking with this particular investor,
I learned that her secret to buying properties
was to watch me at the sheriff’s sale and then
approach the owners of the properties I had bid
on at auction. She told me that she was so con-
fident in my research that she seldom if ever
researched the properties herself — she just
piggy-backed on my hard work and efforts.
Well that didn’t sit well with me. I don’t mind
some honest competition, but when you try to
take the easy way out, sometimes justice has a
funny way of catching up with you. It certainly
caught up with her. I consider myself a fairly
nice guy, because I turned what could have
been a third-degree burn into a harsh and
painful sunburn — painful, but not lethal. I heard
later through a mutual investor that she had
gotten out of the “flipping” game, because once
she started doing all the research herself, it
didn’t seem worth it to her. 
This story has two morals to it: Do your own
research, and tie up the loose ends.

Dear <Homeowner’s First Names>:
I’ve sent you many letters in the past about the foreclosure process.  Unfortunately, those 
letters went unanswered.  This letter is to inform you that your mortgage to <Bank’s Name> 
was sold to <Winning Bidder’s Name> at mortgage sale on <Date of Sale>, for <Sale Price>.
By law you have <Number of> months to redeem your property, which means you have until 
<Redemption Date> to pay off <Winning Bidder’s Name> the <Sales Price> plus interest, at 
<Interest percentage>.  At the Sheriff’s Department there is an over bid of <Overbid Amount> 
waiting to be claimed.  However, if you choose to pick up this money, you will have a much 
more difficult time redeeming the property, should you choose to do so.  Either way, you may 
contact <Sheriff Department Contact Person’s Name> at the Sheriff’s Department at <Sheriff 
Department’s Phone Number> for more information.
The purpose of my letter is to help you either save your home or sell it so you do not lose it in 
foreclosure.  You still have time to act, but time is running out. I may be able to assist you.  
Please contact me as soon as you receive this letter so I can help you get out of this 
situation.  My number is <Your Phone Number>.

W
hen you sit in on a few auctions, you may notice that the opening bid
is the final bid. A lucky investor may scoop up a deal uncontested
simply by bidding the opening amount plus one dollar. More likely, however,
the lender’s representative, seeing that no investor is willing to submit the
opening bid, buys back the mortgage on behalf of the lender. The lender can
then sell the property in an attempt to recoup some of its losses or even turn
a profit.
After the lender takes possession of the property, it turns the property over
to its REO (Real Estate Owned) division or to an REO broker, who prepares it
for resale. As an investor, this provides you with another buying opportunity
in the foreclosure process. 
This chapter shows you how to approach the lender’s REO officer or broker
and present an offer that enables the bank to cut its losses while providing
you with a valuable investment property.

Acknowledging the Drawbacks 
of REO Opportunities
You won’t always find the best deals in REO properties. Lenders aren’t simply
willing to give away properties so they won’t have to deal with them. Each
case is different, and you may discover that REO’s are not the best deals in
town for any of several reasons, including the following:
 Prior to auction, lenders often ask their local REO broker to provide a
BPO (broker’s price opinion) or comparative market analysis to deter-
mine the current value of the property. Using this information, the
lender knows the market value of the property and is unlikely to want to
sell below market value.
 The bank may have already written off the debt and may not have to
“cut its losses.” To the bank, the house may represent a windfall profit,
not a burden that it needs to unload.
 Some banks, especially smaller, smarter banks are developing REO
departments that are quite capable of rehabbing and selling properties. I
have even seen cases in which the bank offers the foreclosed-upon
homeowner cash to move out, just as an investor would do.
 Banks are highly motivated to turn a non-performing loan into a profit,
and they don’t mind unloading their loss on an investor. Be careful.
Don’t take on the bank’s burden if you’re not fairly certain you can profit
from the property.
 Banks often have several well-established investors they prefer working
with. REO departments are often overwhelmed by calls from novice
investors making all sorts of promises. They don’t have the time to sort
through all the calls and determine who’s a real investor and who’s a
wannabe, so they either list with a broker or sell to someone they know. 
Although banks and other lending institutions are often in a position of power
when dealing with investors, that position can be weakened by pressures from
bank regulators. If a bank has too many bad loans on its books, bank regula-
tors begin cranking up the heat, and the bank becomes much more motivated
to make deals and cut its losses. You have no way of knowing this, but if you
have your financing in place and continue to pursue opportunities, you’re
more likely to eventually find yourself in the right place at the right time.
Badgering the loss mitigation or REO department rarely leads to success. In
many cases, you won’t even get to talk to a person. An automated system
simply plays a recording that states the bank’s policy and provides you with
a fax number. One thing for sure — if you get a break and have the chance to
194
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

place an offer on a property, you’d better be able to follow through on it. If
you waffle, your first opportunity will be your last.
Getting Up to Speed on the REO Process
Banks and other lending institutions (credit unions, mortgage companies,
finance companies, and others) like to lend money and collect the interest on
loans. They don’t like to own property. When homeowners default on a loan,
however, and no investor steps in to pay the balance, the lender has no
option but to purchase the home, place it back on the market, and try to sell
it. Here’s how the REO process works:
 When homeowners miss a payment or two, the nonpayment is trans-
ferred to the lender’s collections department.
 Over the course of 6–8 months, the collections department tries to con-
tact the homeowners to negotiate a payment plan.
 If the collections department is unable to resolve the issue, it transfers
the matter to the loss mitigation department, which deals with the prob-
lem (and the property) through the foreclosure process. During this
time, the lender seeks the assistance of a title company and attorney;
the cost for these professionals is added to the payoff amount — the
total amount required to redeem the property.
When you hear that the house sold for $1 at auction, the house actually sold
for the payoff amount plus a dollar. Late-night TV real estate investment
gurus spin this fact into a pumped up promise of buying houses for a buck.
Don’t fall for it.
 At the foreclosure auction, if no investor purchases the mortgage, the
lender buys back the mortgage and transfers the matter to its REO
department.
 In an area with a mandatory redemption period, the lender’s REO
department waits for the redemption period to expire, evicts the previ-
ous homeowners (if necessary), and sells the property to recover any
losses.
 In some cases, especially when the lender is out of state, the lender
hires an REO broker to prepare the property for resale and place it back
on the market. The REO broker typically gets involved just prior to the
end of the redemption period or shortly thereafter. He may play a role in
evicting the homeowners or offering cash for keys to encourage the
homeowners to move out voluntarily.
195
Chapter 12: Buying Repos: Bank Foreclosures and REO Properties

At the foreclosure sale, the lender can set an opening bid only high enough to
cover the balance of the mortgage and any costs incurred trying to collect
that amount prior to the auction. In other words, the lender cannot profit
from the sale of the property at auction. When the bank takes possession of
the property, however, it becomes the owner and can sell the property for
more than what is owed on it. In other words, the bank may not be all that
eager to “unload” the property.
Shaking the Bushes for REO Properties
If I haven’t yet been able to talk you out of trying to pursue REO properties, you
obviously have the determination required to get through to the gatekeepers —
the lender’s REO people or the broker who’s listing the property. Now you
have to find these people and present yourself as a reliable investor who can
assist them in removing a non-performing loan from their books.
In the following sections, I show you how to properly position yourself as a
reliable, trustworthy investor and reveal some strategies for getting yourself
connected with the “in” crowd.
Positioning yourself as 
an attractive investor
Banks and other lending institutions field many calls from would-be investors
inquiring about REO properties. A good majority of these investor wannabes
have no money. They expect the lender to not only hand them a prime piece
of real estate for a bargain price but also finance the purchase and the cost of
repairs and renovations. Although some small banks and credit unions may
be willing to sell you a bargain property and finance your purchase, most
larger banks won’t even consider it.
Don’t be a time waster. Call an REO officer or broker only if you have suffi-
cient funds to buy, hold, renovate, and sell the property. The best way to 
succeed at investing in REO properties is to prove yourself — have cash on
hand, and do what you say you’re going to do.
Hooking up with REO brokers
A good way to find REO properties that a bank is for sure willing to sell is to call
on listings with REO brokers — real estate agents who sell properties on behalf
of lenders. A good way to track down REO brokers is to network at foreclo-
sure auctions. Start talking with the people who attend these auctions — the
196
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

gallery. They can steer you in the direction of brokers who list REO proper-
ties. If that approach doesn’t lead you to REO brokers, call on ads that list
properties with words and phrases like “REO,” “Foreclosure,” “Seller Willing
To Look At All Offers,” and “Bank Owned,” or simply call around to local
banks and brokers and ask.
REO brokers are in the business of getting the bank top dollar for the proper-
ties they sell, so do your homework. The sheriff’s deed filed at the county
courthouse after the sale shows what the bank paid for the property.
Compare that amount to the listing price to determine if you have room to
negotiate. The broker may not cut you a sweet deal, but with proof that you
have the financing in place to close the deal quickly and hassle-free, the
broker and the bank may be willing to negotiate price.
Getting connected with REO A-listers
When dealing with banks, try to contact the person who’s in charge of
making the decisions. This may be the bank president, vice president, or
someone high up in the REO department. This person can then put you in
contact with the lender’s REO officer, so when you contact the REO officer,
you’re making a warm call instead of a cold call. Establishing relationships
with bankers requires some people skills and determination that no book can
help you develop. Learn by doing and by talking with people.
Consider contacting the banks in your area that have REO properties and let
them know what you do. Figure 12-1 provides you with a sample letter of
introduction that you can customize to fit your needs.
197
Chapter 12: Buying Repos: Bank Foreclosures and REO Properties
The exclusive REO insiders club
In the real estate investment community, the
REO people often form their own little exclusive
club. REO officers may pass along leads for the
best properties to their friends, relatives, and
other well-connected individuals. REO brokers
(who list the properties for the banks) have been
known to omit certain properties from the public
MLS (Multiple Listing Service), so they can pri-
vately offer the properties to their clients of
choice.
None of these practices is ethical, and some of
them are even illegal, but as an investor, you
should know the way the game is played. You
may legitimately get yourself on the A-list of
investors, but that usually requires hard work,
dedication, and a willingness to purchase some
less appealing properties for access to better
deals in the future.
Remember that no profit is worth what you have
to go through if you get caught up in mortgage
fraud, or insider deals. Just because “everyone
is doing it” and nobody’s been caught doesn’t
mean that you won’t be the one the federal
authorities decide to make an example out of.
Play the game above board; you’ll sleep better
that way.

Developing a positive rapport with local bankers and REO personnel is a good
move no matter where in the foreclosure process you decide to invest. In many
cases, you can establish these contacts when working with homeowners prior
to auction. If bankers know that you’re working in the area to help homeown-
ers catch up on their mortgage payments, bankers are more likely to respond
to you when you approach them about REO properties. In addition, knowing
the bankers and other lenders in the area can help you negotiate better deals
for distressed homeowners. Get to know the key personnel:

 Dear Mr./Ms. <Last Name>:
 You know better than anyone that the primary business of <Bank’s Name> is lending money, 
not owning property.  That is why I want to propose a partnership that I believe will create a 
win-win situation for both of us.
 I’m sure your REO list is full of properties that gobble up your department’s valuable time and 
resources.  I’m also sure that you and your staff have more important things to do than worry 
about property taxes, maintenance expenses, mandatory waiting periods, and all of the 
myriad other headaches that come with bank-owned real estate.
 On the other hand, buying, selling, and owning property is my business.  I have the resources 
to pay cash for properties and the know-how to make them profitable for everyone.  Each 
piece of real estate <Bank’s Name> owns represents valuable resources that could be better 
spent elsewhere in your institution’s operations.  I would like to help free up that money so 
you can put it back to work for you.
 Let’s meet face-to-face to discuss how we can work together in a mutually beneficial 
relationship.  I will call you soon to select a time and date that fits into your schedule.  Thank 
you for your time and interest.
 Sincerely,

Chapter 12: Buying Repos: Bank Foreclosures and REO Properties

Tracking the property through 
the REO stage
In Chapter 8, I suggest that you track a property from the time the foreclosure
notice or Notice of Default appears until the time somebody eventually pur-
chases the property. If you followed my advice, then you know, from sitting in
on the auction, whether somebody purchased the property, but you may not
know who purchased it. In many cases, the purchaser is the lender who fore-
closed on the property.
To find out who purchased the property, head back to the register of deeds or
county clerk’s office and check out the deed. Whenever someone buys a mort-
gage at auction, the first thing he does is record the sheriff’s deed he acquired.
That deed tells you who bought the property. If the lender bought it, you now
know that you have an opportunity to purchase the property from the lender.
Some third-party purchasers intentionally wait to record the deed, so another
investor doesn’t “poach” their purchase, as discussed in Chapter 12. If you
know somebody purchased the property, but you can’t find the sheriff’s deed
with the buyer’s name on it, this is probably what’s going on. Ask the register
of deeds if it has a statutory recording period or deadline of when the deed
must be recorded. In some jurisdictions, the buyer must record an affidavit of
designee or a buyer’s affidavit — a separate sheet that must be attached to or
recorded at the same time as the deed, which tells you when the sale took
place, who foreclosed, and more importantly who purchased the property 
or who needs to be paid off to redeem the property, including their contact
information.
Working your way to the better deals
People who work in the REO departments tend to give the best deals to
investors whom they trust the most and who offer the best service to the
bank. By doing what you say you’re going to do, closing on deals, and reliev-
ing the bank of its burden, you become an attractive investor. When a prop-
erty becomes available, the REO officer is more likely to contact you than a
less qualified or unproven investor.
You can make yourself even more valuable to the REO department by putting
the following tips into practice:
 Be courteous. Act like a partner. The bank doesn’t owe you anything. Be
polite and treat everyone from the bank president down to the secre-
taries with respect.
200
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

 Solve problems. When a bank takes possession of a property, it has a
problem that you can solve by buying the property. Don’t create more
problems or provide a litany of complaints. Solve the bank’s problem.
 Take the bad with the good. REO departments often have some highly
profitable properties and some not-so-profitable properties. Offer to buy
one property that has a low potential profit along with a property that
has a higher potential profit. In other words, bundle your purchases. 
When you’re just getting started, avoid bundle purchases. I strongly recom-
mend that you purchase properties that are almost certain to deliver a profit.
When you become more experienced and have a reliable team that can quickly
and affordably renovate several properties at once, bundling may be a good
strategy. As long as your overall profit on the bundle is sufficient, you can
afford to buy a few mediocre properties along with those that have a higher
profit potential.
Following up with homeowners 
during redemption
In areas with a redemption period, you can continue to work with the home-
owners during redemption, even if the bank’s REO department bought back
the mortgage. Use this opportunity to inform the homeowners that they can
still redeem the property. 
At this point, the bank isn’t likely to reinstate the loan or agree to a forbearance,
but the bank may agree to a short sale (accepting less than full payment of
the loan’s balance). The redemption period also gives the homeowners extra
time to find a less painful exit, such as selling the house to you, borrowing
from friends or relatives, refinancing, and so on. See Chapter 10 for a com-
plete list of options that may be available to the homeowners.
Another great place to research bank-owned properties is HurryHome.com at
www.HurryHome.com. This site also enables you to search for preforeclo-
sure and foreclosure properties.
Inspecting the Property
Even when you’re buying bank-owned properties, you need to inspect the
property with your own two eyes, as discussed in Chapter 9. Getting inside to
201
Chapter 12: Buying Repos: Bank Foreclosures and REO Properties

take a look around, however, can be a monumental challenge. Here are a few
suggestions to assist you in inspecting the property as closely as possible.
 If the homeowners are residing in the home, knock on the door. They
may not let you in, but try to engage them in a conversation long enough
to look past them into the house. This doesn’t provide you with a thor-
ough inspection, but it’s better than nothing. 
 Look through the windows if the house is vacant.
 Contact the bank’s REO department and explain that you’re seriously
interested in buying the property but you can’t place an offer until
you can get inside the house to look around. Explain that you want to
be fair to them, but you also need to know what you’re getting into. 
 Offer to visit the house and change the locks for the bank. Here is a
chance for you to problem-solve for the bank. If you have some old locks
left over from a previous property you purchased, you can change the
locks at no cost to you and seize the opportunity to inspect the home at
the same time. Ask them where you can drop off the keys (giving your-
self another chance to meet a contact person with some authority). 
 If you can’t get inside to take a look around and still want to make an
offer on the property, consider adding a contingency clause to the
purchase agreement stating that the purchase is conditional upon the
home passing inspection. Remember, however, that contingency clauses
make your offer less attractive, but unless the bank flat-out refuses to
consider offers with contingency clauses, it’s worth a try.
After you inspect the property, follow up with the bank, even if the house is a
total wreck. If you like what you saw, place an offer within a reasonable time.
Timing Your Offer for Optimum Results
In real estate investing, being in the right place at the right time often brings
you the best properties. This is even more true with REO properties, because
banks and other lending institutions are highly motivated to get the bad
loans off their books.
As an investor, you have four excellent opportunities to scoop up REO 
properties:
 Right after the auction, if your area has no redemption period
 Right after the redemption period expires, if your area has a redemption
period
202
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

 At the end of the month or quarter, when lenders are often in a hurry to
clear bad loans off their books 
 When the REO broker first lists the property
Banks and other lending institutions often receive funds to lend based on
their ration of good-to-bad loans. The more bad loans they can clear off the
books, the more money they can invest in potential good loans. In addition,
bank officers often receive bonuses and promotions based on their perfor-
mance numbers, so they’re highly motivated, particularly at the end of the
month or quarter, to clear those bad loans off the books.
In the following sections, I explore these opportunities in greater detail.
Acting quickly after the auction
If your area has no redemption period and you’ve been tracking a property
that you’re interested in buying, contact the REO broker in charge of the
property just prior to the auction. Let her know that if nobody purchases the
property at the auction, you’re interested in it. Of course, if the property has
some equity in it, the broker isn’t likely to offer you a clear shot at it after the
sale. She’s more likely to tell you that if you’re interested, show up and the
sale and bid.
Tell the REO person that you can save her the time and money of evicting the
previous homeowners and renovating the property. You can handle that,
assuming she’s willing to negotiate the sale price.
Timing your move with 
the redemption period
In areas with a redemption period, the bank isn’t going to move on the prop-
erty until the homeowners have exhausted their final opportunity to redeem
the property. Contacting the REO department during the redemption period,
however, is always a good idea, just to let the REO officer know that you’re
interested in the property. 
Once the REO department passes the property to the REO broker, the prop-
erty is typically listed on the open market, and your competition for that
property heats up. By letting the REO officer know that you’re interested in
the property, the manager may tell the broker something like, “Hey, so-and-so
really wants this house. I’d like you to hook up with him and get an offer.” The
203
Chapter 12: Buying Repos: Bank Foreclosures and REO Properties

letting the officer know of your interest provides you with an opportunity to
be the first person to place an offer on the property, assuming the REO offi-
cer doesn’t already have someone lined up.
Tuning in to the lender’s fiscal calendar
Banks often set end-of-month and end-of-quarter dates for their REO person-
nel. Often, bonuses are tied to an REO officer’s ability to unload a certain
number of properties in a given time period, and when the end of the month
or quarter rolls around, the REO officer is highly motivated to make a deal.
A bank’s fiscal and calendar years may differ, so coordinate your activities
with each bank’s fiscal calendar. Keep a record of each bank’s fiscal year, so
you have a better idea of how to time your offers for optimum success.
204
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 
The crooked broker
In the sidebar earlier in this chapter called “The
exclusive REO insiders club,” I reveal that the
REO circuit is often shady. REO brokers are
often in a position of power, and as Lord Acton
once said, “Power corrupts, and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.”
I once had lunch with an REO broker I had
known over the years. He wanted to sell me his
business. I asked him what I would have to do 
to guarantee my continued success with his
business, and he replied that every once in
awhile he sells a house at a good price to the
asset manager at a different bank. He would sell
them properties that would guarantee a $30,000
profit per property, which is an obviously illegal
kickback.
This same REO broker would sell houses to 
his girlfriend. She would simply buy the prop-
erty well below market value and then turn
around and sell it at market value to earn what’s
called a pass through profit. My staff and 
private investigating team discovered that 
the girlfriend had “earned” over $90,000 in pass
through profits. That money really belonged to
the lender that the REO broker represented.
Another REO broker (scoundrel) I know lists
only half the properties he sells. Instead of list-
ing all the properties on the MLS, as he should
do, he lists the worst half of them and then sells
the listings with the most profit potential to his
buddies. We call these pocket listings, because
the broker puts the listing in his pocket and then
transfers it to his friend’s pocket. In a matter of
days, the listing is sold and closed, and the
seller scores a huge profit for doing nothing.
I tell these stories for two reasons. First, don’t
get involved in these scams. I’m getting the
word out about real estate fraud on my site
FlippingFrenzy.com, and real estate profession-
als are joining forces across the country to bust
the bad guys. Second, I want you to realize, as
an investor, that these sorts of underhanded
deals seriously jeopardize your access to the
best deals. REO investing isn’t easy, and these
types of scams make it even more difficult.

Waiting for the broker to list the house
Waiting for the REO broker to list the house is rarely the best move, because
the broker’s commission is calculated on the sales price of the property. He’s
not likely to sell you the property at a bargain basement price. Keep in mind,
however, that both time and money contribute to making an offer appealing.
If the broker can save enough time selling the property to you for less money,
he may be willing to broker a deal.
Consider submitting a copy of your offer to the broker and the bank. This
isn’t necessarily the best way to buddy up with a broker, but it does let the
bank know who you are and what you do. In the future, the bank may decide
to deal with you directly rather than through the brokers.
Pitching an Attractive Offer
When you’re buying a property from a bank or other lending institution, you
take the same steps that you would take if you were buying the property from
a homeowner. You complete a purchase agreement stating the price and
terms you’re offering. The bank or other lending institution can and usually
does present you with a counter-offer that you can accept or counter on.
In the following sections, I provide some guidance on determining how much
to offer for the property and what you can expect when the lender makes a
counteroffer. 
Banks often require that you sign documents in addition to the purchase
agreement that slap more restrictions on the deal. These aren’t deal killers,
but you should have your attorney look them over before signing them.
Sizing up the lender’s needs
When pitching an offer to a seller, knowing what the seller needs can always
help. In most cases, the REO officer or broker who’s selling the property esti-
mates a target price by totaling the following amounts:
 Unpaid balance on the loan
 Collection fees
 Legal fees and other expenses related to the foreclosure
 Property taxes the bank paid
205
Chapter 12: Buying Repos: Bank Foreclosures and REO Properties

 Repair and maintenance expenses
 Other expenses
If the home is obviously worth much more than the unpaid balance on the
loan, the bank usually takes this into consideration and seeks to profit from
the sale in excess of simply recovering the unpaid loan balance and
expenses.
Re-evaluating your needs
Knowing how the lender calculates the asking price is valuable information to
have when preparing your offer, but more important is knowing the maximum
price you can pay for the property in order to be fairly certain that you can
resell it for 20 percent more than you invest in it.
In Chapter 12, I provide detailed instructions on gathering the numbers and
plugging them into a formula to determine your maximum bid. The formula is
the same for determining your top offer on an REO property:
1. Start with the future sales price of the home after improvements.
2. For an estimated profit of at least 20 percent, divide the amount from
Step 1 by one of the following:
• 1.20 in a market where homes values are rising. (To shoot for a 
20 percent return on your investment.)
• 1.25 in a market where home values are steady. (To shoot for a 
25 percent return.)
• 1.30 in a market where home values are declining. (To shoot for a
30 percent return.)
• 1.35 to 1.50 depending on the percentage profit you want to make.
(To shoot for a 35–50 percent return.)
3. Subtract any back taxes you will be responsible for paying when you
purchase the property.
4. Subtract estimated costs for repairs and renovations.
5. Subtract monthly holding costs.
6. Subtract agent commissions and/or marketing and advertising costs.
7. Subtract closing costs for selling the property.
The result gives you a general idea of how much to offer for the property to
be fairly certain you can profit at least 20 percent from the transaction.
206
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

Don’t make your first offer your best offer. REO officers are trained to haggle,
and they always counteroffer. If you want a property for $200,000, and you
offer $200,000, the REO officer is going to counter with $220,000 or $225,000.
To get the property for $200,000, you’d better start with a lowball offer of
$175,000 or $180,000. This is pretty much a hard-and-fast rule, but be pre-
pared to take a different strategy if the situation warrants it, as I demonstrate
in the following sidebar, “Haggling with REO managers.”
Drawing up an offer in writing
Whether you’re buying a property from homeowners or from a lender, your
offer must be in writing — in the form of a purchase agreement. In real estate,
verbal agreements and handshakes are not enforceable and won’t hold up in
court. Everything must be in writing. Your attorney can assist you in drawing
up and presenting the purchase agreement. Even if someone tells you a price
she’s willing to accept, get it in writing. Follow the rules to meet the statute of
frauds, and your offer will go from an unenforceable oral offer, to a rock solid
legally enforceable one.
207
Chapter 12: Buying Repos: Bank Foreclosures and REO Properties
Haggling with REO managers
Once you’ve established a close relationship
with an REO manager, you can get away with
making your first offer your best offer — as long
as the REO manager knows that you’ve done
your homework, can close the deal, and this is
truly your best offer. The worst that can happen
is that the REO broker rejects your offer.
The worst thing you can do is pitch $200,000 as
your best offer and then increase that offer
when the broker counters it. I was once trying
to sell a house to a couple with whom I was
unwilling to haggle (not in the mood, I guess). I
told the buyers, “Give me your best offer. If it
works, we’ll go with it. If not, then I’ll tell you that
up front too.” I needed $150,000 to make the
deal work for me. They offered $135,000, and I
said, “No, that won’t work.” They immediately
upped their offer to $145,000, and I said, “I
thought $135,000 was your best offer. Didn’t I tell
you that I would be willing to deal with you if you
gave me your best offer?” The buyers replied,
“Well, yes, but . . .”
At this point, the buyers’ credibility was in
shreds. I offered to sell them the house for
$157,000, saying, “And this IS my final offer.” The
couple bought the house.
The take home message is this: If you don’t
want to haggle, don’t haggle. If you have a rela-
tionship with a REO manager, and he says
“Alright, let’s just cut to the chase, and you tell
me what you want to pay, and if it works we’re
a go . . .,” and then you low-ball him thinking
he’ll counter, you’ve just lost your credibility.

When pitching an offer to a bank, you typically have to offer a few more con-
cessions than when you’re buying a property from a homeowner. Following
are some guidelines to assist you in drawing up an attractive offer:
 Cash is king: Having the cash available enables you to close on the deal
without having to wait for loan approval. This gives the bank confidence
that you won’t back out on the deal at the last minute, and it gives your
offer an edge over any other offers the bank may receive. Gather proof
that you have the cash — copies of bank statements (with account num-
bers blacked out) and other financial statements.
 Proof of financing: If you don’t have cash, you need proof that you are
pre-approved for a loan. Contact your lender to obtain the required 
documentation.
 Large down payment: If you can’t come up with all the cash, offering a
large down payment is the next best thing. A 20 percent or higher down
payment along with a pre-approval letter from the bank or investor
who’s lending you the money usually carries sufficient weight. 
 Bank’s purchase agreement: You may be required to use the bank’s pur-
chase agreement to present your offer. Banks often do this, so their
employees can easily locate the necessary information on a standard form
rather than having to learn how to read various purchase agreements.
 No conditions: When buying a property from a homeowner, you often
make your offer conditional upon the house passing inspection. When
buying from a bank’s REO department, any conditions weaken your offer,
and the bank is likely to reject them outright.
 Bank’s addendum: The bank typically counters with an addendum of its
own stating that the purchase is unconditional, that the bank provides
no warranty for the property, and so on. These addendums basically
state that you’re agreeing to buy the property “as is,” which can be a
little intimidating, but that’s part of doing business with the bank’s REO
department.
Prepare all the documentation well in advance and have your attorney review
it before signing. Your attorney can do little to help you after you’ve signed. 
After you and the lender agree on a price and terms, have the lender work
with your attorney to set a closing date and review any documents prior to
closing. At this point, the closing arrangements are pretty much in the hands
of the bank and your attorney. The closing is typically held within 10 to 14
days providing there are no other timing issues that need to be met.
208
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

During negotiations, never counter yourself. After making an offer, wait for
the bank to accept your offer or counter back. If you offer $160,000 and then
begin to think that your offer is too low and boost your offer to $170,000
before the bank has responded, you end up bidding against yourself. On the
other hand, if you have reliable information and know that the bank has mul-
tiple offers, you may want to increase your bid.
Closing on the deal
Even when you’re purchasing a property from the bank, always purchase title
insurance. You can get seriously burned if you missed something on the title
work or a lien was not properly recorded against the property and you don’t
have title insurance.
During one transaction, I entertained the idea of foregoing title insurance and
saving a little money. The deal seemed pretty straightforward, and I had done
my research, so I figured I had covered all the bases. I decided, however, to
live by my rule, and I scheduled the closing with a title company. Good thing 
I did. 
The closing went smoothly enough — no problems. Weeks after the closing,
however, I started receiving notices of taxes and fees I supposedly owed on
the property. First, I received a notice from the county treasurer that I owed 
a fairly substantial amount in back taxes. Then, one of the condominium
association’s board members stopped me to say that I owed some back dues.
The board had just voted to file a lien against my property. In both cases, I
thought there must be some kind of mistake, because I had just closed and
everything was paid at that closing, or so I thought. 
Had I not purchased title insurance and had the title company not handled
the closing, I would have had to pony up thousands of dollars extra to keep
my property. As it turned out, the title company was responsible for paying,
because it made the mistake. The moral of the story? Always use a title com-
pany to insure the transaction.

In This Chapter
 Finding and buying HUD homes
 Tracking down VA properties
 Buying a bank’s assets when it goes belly up 
 Finding and buying government-owned and -seized properties
 Qualifying for government financing
T
he government often plays a supporting role in the real estate business. It
insures or secures loans, and when homeowners default on those loans,
the government has to step in, foreclose on the property and then sell it to
recover some or all of its loss. When citizens fail to pay their taxes, the gov-
ernment may seize the homeowner’s real estate to cover the bill. Law
enforcement agencies often get in the act by seizing homes of convicted drug
dealers and other criminals.
Nobody likes to think of the government kicking people out of their homes,
but that’s a tragic reality that some homeowners face when they experience a
significant financial setback, commit a serious crime, or make some poor
financial decisions.
Anyone with enough money or financing can purchase these homes, either
from designated real estate agents or by bidding on the properties at auction.
In this chapter, I discuss the pros and cons of buying government-owned
properties and show you how to track them down, online and off.
Strictly speaking, the properties I cover in this chapter are not your average
foreclosure properties, but because they’re properties that are taken away from
the owners and then placed on the market, I lump them in with foreclosures. 

Bargain Hunting for HUD (Housing and
Urban Development) Homes
First-time buyers often finance their homes through the federal government,
primarily by way of FHA-insured loans. When the property owner fails to
make mortgage payments on the property, FHA initiates a foreclosure, which
commonly results in the agency taking possession of the house and reselling
it through a HUD-registered real estate agent.
In the following sections, I discuss the pros and cons of investing in HUD
homes, encourage you to hook up with a HUD-registered real estate agent in
your area, and show you how to research HUD homes online.
212
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 
Why is the government in the 
real estate business, anyway?
Homeownership is one of the major forces that
drives local, state, national, and even global
economies. In addition to providing people with a
roof over their heads, a home is one of the best
and most accessible investment vehicles for the
average citizen. It’s no wonder, then, that the fed-
eral government goes out of its way to facilitate
the purchase of homes by making home loans
more affordable, especially to first-time buyers.
For decades, people have relied on FHA (Federal
Housing Authority)-insured loans to finance the
purchase of their first homes. Likewise, veterans
have used federally guaranteed VA loans to pur-
chase homes. Most government-secured loans
are originated by mortgage brokers. At closing or
shortly thereafter, the loans are assigned to
lenders who service the loans.
Lenders love these loans, because the govern-
ment takes most of their risk out of the equation
by insuring the loans. If the homeowners default
on the loan, the lender has a relatively safe exit:
 HUD Homes: FHA loans are insured by 
the federal government program (through
HUD). The lender forecloses on the property
and then has two options: keep the property
or turn it over to HUD and be fully reim-
bursed for all costs, including principal,
interest, late fees, and court and attorney
fees. HUD then sells the house.
 VA Homes: The VA underwrites the loan,
and because the loan is being offered 
to war military veterans, the VA is a little
more lenient with loan qualifications. When
homeowners default on a VA loan, the
lender forecloses on the property and
evicts the homeowners. The lender then
assigns the property back to the VA and is
reimbursed all costs. 
When a homeowner defaults on one of those
loans, the government usually ends up with the
property, but has neither the means nor the
motivation to fix up the home and sell it. These
government properties then go back on the
market, where investors can often pick them up
for prices below market value.

HUD sells homes “owner occupied.” If you purchase a HUD home, you must
sign a document stating that you’ll live in the home for at least 12 months
before selling it. You may be tempted to stretch the truth a bit and sign the
document even though you have no intention of living in the house, but that’s
fraud. If you’re caught and convicted, you may face a hefty fine and some jail
time. Do the right thing. If you don’t plan on living in the house for at least a
year, don’t buy it. You can find plenty of good deals on investment properties
without committing a felony.
Weighing the pros and cons of HUD homes
Because HUD homes are sold “owner occupied,” they’re not candidates for a
quick flip, but as an investor who probably needs a place to live while invest-
ing in other properties, a HUD home may be a good long-term investment.
Before becoming involved with HUD homes, however, be aware of the follow-
ing potential drawbacks:
 HUD homes are often sold at market or just below market value, so
they’re not always the best deals available. You need to assess the
potential profitability of these properties as you would any property you
consider buying. 
 The homes that HUD owns are typically low- to mid-market homes
repossessed from first-time homeowners. They’re rarely located in the
ritziest neighborhoods.
 You need to purchase the home through a HUD-registered real estate
agent and pay a sales commission.
 HUD homes are sold as-is, so have the home professionally inspected
before making your offer. After you buy it, you own it, my friend . . . and
all the defects that come with it.
One of the big benefits of purchasing HUD homes is that you may qualify for
FHA financing. The agency often offers special interest rates for loans used to
purchase and rehab run-down properties.
Don’t just assume that because the government is selling the home you’re
getting a great deal on a great property. Do your homework. Inspect the
house yourself, research comparable property values in the area, and have
the home professionally inspected before you hand over your money.
Hooking up with a HUD-approved agent
If you’re interested in investing in HUD homes, hook up with a real estate
agent who specializes in these properties. The right real estate agent can
213
Chapter 13: Finding and Buying Government Repos

supply you with a steady stream of leads along with tips on how to best profit
from your investment properties.
You can find HUD-approved agents by networking or by checking out HUD
homes for sale online, as discussed in the following section. Online listings
typically display contact information for the agent who’s listing the home.
When you contact the HUD-approved agent, tell the agent if you’re already
working through your own agent; otherwise, you can end up in the middle of
a messy legal battle.
Sales of owner-occupied houses fall through more often than investor deals,
so don’t give up just because someone “bought” the property you wanted.
Keep an eye on the pending sale and be prepared to pounce if the sale falls
through. At that point, most of your competition in the property has lost
interest and dropped out.
Finding HUD homes online
HUD Homes Listings at www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/reo/homes.cfm
enables you to search by state for homes made available through the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Most listings provide a com-
plete description of the property along with a photo and links to additional
information, including disclosures, environmental compliance, and condition
of the property. See Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1:

214
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

After you find a home, you can place a bid online or click a link to obtain con-
tact information for a HUD-registered broker in your area. In most cases, you
have to make an offer through a registered broker.
If someone tries to sell you some HUD-Homes-Investor program for $1,500 or
so, don’t fall for it. He can’t tell you any more than what I revealed here. HUD
and VA home opportunities are equally available to anyone who has the
financing and energy to pursue them. Don’t assume you need some special
high-priced program.
Finding and Buying VA Repos
To make homeownership more affordable to military veterans, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers VA loans. As you’ve probably guessed,
when someone defaults on a VA loan, the VA repossesses the property and
places it back on the market. You can find VA listings in either of the follow-
ing ways:
 Contact a VA-registered real estate agent in your area.
 Visit Ocwen at www.ocwen.com, click Properties for Sale, and click VA
Properties. This displays a clickable map of the United States. Click your
state and follow the onscreen cues to search for properties in your
target area. Figure 13-2 shows a sample listing. You can then contact the
listing agent directly or have your agent contact the listing agent to set
up a showing. 
If you’re already working with an agent that you have a relationship with,
mention this point when you speak with the agent assigned to sell the VA
property. Otherwise, you may inadvertently cause some conflict between the
two agents who both want the sales commission, and you don’t want to get
caught in the middle of some legal battle.
Ocwen is a financial corporation that the VA has contracted to manage its
properties. New listings may not yet be assigned to real estate brokers, in
which case you can call Ocwen directly to obtain answers to any questions
and find out how to present your offer.
You don’t have to be a veteran of the military to buy a home off the VA. You
may, however, need to sign a statement that you intend to live in the house,
just as if you were purchasing a HUD home.
215
Chapter 13: Finding and Buying Government Repos

While you’re at the Ocwen site, click the link for “Vendee Financing” — VA
financing that’s available for veterans and non-veterans alike. When making
your offer, structure it in a way that makes it as easy as possible for the list-
ing agent to say “Yes.” Offering a 20 percent down payment streamlines the
processing, which almost guarantees instant approval. If you find a really
good deal for $100,000, for example, and you offer a down payment of $20,000,
you’re almost assured of getting the property. The Vendee Financing page has
current information about required down payments and fees.
Profiting from Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac Properties
One of the ways the federal government promotes homeownership is by pro-
viding financing through Fannie Mae (a nickname for the FNMA or Federal
National Mortgage Association), Ginnie Mae (GNMA or Government National
Mortgage Association), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC or Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation).
All of these organizations do pretty much the same thing — they purchase
residential mortgages and then convert the mortgages into securities for sale
to investors, indirectly financing the purchase of homes. Because Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac are such an integral part of home financing, they end up
with a huge number of foreclosure properties that they must sell, particularly
in large markets, and many of these properties are not HUD or VA homes.

If you stumble upon what looks like a great deal, make your offer subject to a
satisfactory home inspection. Delaying your offer until you can have the home
inspected opens the possibility that another buyer will swoop in and buy the
property. By making your offer subject to a satisfactory home inspection, you
can get your offer in and then back out if the property needs a lot of work.
Present your offer, but make sure it has a good contingency clause you can
use for an emergency exit.

Freddie Mac has a Web site devoted exclusively to promoting the sales of the
homes it owns called HomeSteps at www.homesteps.com. This site features
a searchable online database containing information on thousands of homes,
primarily REO properties, all across the nation. Freddie Mac lists most of the
homes with brokers, but it also holds online auctions, so you can bid for
properties in the comfort of your home or office.
To search for homes for sale, simply click Find a Home, click Search for your
next home, type the requested information on the search form, and click
Search. HomeSteps also has a Home Detective tool that automatically e-mails
you a notification when a home that matches your criteria is up for sale.
Figure 13-3 shows a sample listing. As you can see, HomeSteps provides very
sketchy information about its homes, but it does provide two key pieces of
information — the name and phone number of the real estate agent to call.
When you find a home that interests you, call the agent to schedule a tour.

Buying FDIC properties
FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) is a government agency that
insures savings deposits at member banks, typically up to $100,000 per sav-
ings account. If an FDIC bank fails, the agency makes sure that people who
have savings accounts at the bank don’t lose their life savings. 
When a bank fails, the FDIC acquires any properties the bank owns and puts
those properties up for sale. It’s sort of like foreclosing on the bank. These prop-
erties are then offered for sale. You can check out what the FDIC has to offer
by visiting www.fdic.gov/buying/owned/index.html, but I wouldn’t
waste my time. When I visited the site, I did a search for all property types in
all states and found three lousy properties for sale somewhere in Texas . . . and
they weren’t exactly in the heart of Texas.
When a rash of bank failures occurs, you may be able to find plenty of FDIC
properties for sale. In the meantime, you can find a wider selection of proper-
ties elsewhere. I include this section on FDIC properties only so that you
won’t think I omitted something by mistake.
Finding and Buying Government-Seized
Properties
Various government agencies at all levels often seize or purchase property.
None of these agencies is interested in the property itself. They generally
want to unload it quickly for whatever they can get for it. In other words, the
government is the ultimate motivated seller. 
You can track down government-seized properties by contacting law-
enforcement and government agencies directly, especially at the state or
local level. The following sections describe various agencies — local, state,
and federal — that commonly have properties for sale.

Chapter 13: Finding and Buying Government Repos

Buying properties at tax sales
Taxing authorities don’t mess around when citizens don’t pay their taxes.
They simply send a few notices, and if the homeowners don’t come up with
the cash or work out a payment plan, the taxing authority seizes on the prop-
erty, puts it up for auction, and attempts to collect the taxes from the sales
proceeds. Taxing authorities show little leniency, and the homeowners rarely
dodge the bullet by claiming bankruptcy.
Tax sales, like foreclosures, are typically processed through the county sher-
iff’s office, as explained in the following section, but the state may hold its
own tax sales. Your real estate attorney can fill you in on the details and tell
you where to go for additional information related to your state and county.
Avoiding the tax lien sales gurus
Most of the tax sales you hear about in real estate investment books, articles,
and on late-night TV are property-tax sales. Your average investment guru
typically over-hypes the available opportunities in this area. They lead
would-be investors into believing that they can pay $4,000 in back taxes at a

House-jacking in Wayne County
Wayne County announced that it was holding
the equivalent of the county fair of tax sales. My
investment team spent months preparing for it
and I actually brought my banker along to the
auction. I had the funds on hand to purchase a
million dollars’ worth of real estate. 
I ended up buying only two houses that day —
one was a lot without a house and the other
was what I would consider a good rental prop-
erty, perfect for use as a long-term investment.
Well, my long-term investment didn’t quite turn
out as I had planned. I rented it out only to dis-
cover later that some sinister con artist had
stolen the property from me. I had been victim-
ized by a house-jacker!
That was a little discouraging. After all, I’m a
renowned expert on real estate fraud and even
have my own Web site called FlippingFrenzy.
com, on which I warn people about real estate
con artists. I felt like a police officer who just
had his squad car hijacked. The perpetrator
used the information from the tax sale with the
original homeowner’s name on it and recorded
the deed in his name, before I had a chance to
record the deed in my name!
Needless to say, I was able to track down the
con artist with the help of my friendly neighbor-
hood law enforcement agency and make him
pay for his crime. 
The moral of this story is to remain vigilant for
real estate con artists, file your deed as soon as
possible after the sale, and take out title insur-
ance to cover your back.

tax sale and scoop up a $200,000 property. In theory, you may be able to take
ownership of a property by paying the back taxes, but in practice, that rarely
happens. This area has become so competitive that bidding quickly drives up
the price of the property. You would be very lucky to get a $200,000 property
for $120,000 at auction.
If you decide to search for “tax sales” or “tax liens” online, even if you look
for tax sales specifically in your state or county, you’re very unlikely to dis-
cover any useful information. You’ll find thousands of sites that attempt to
sell you on get-rich-quick schemes related to tax sales and purchasing tax liens
and very little information directly from official state or county Web sites . . .
unless your particular state or county has some good information on the Web
(most don’t). Don’t waste your money on whatever program and services a
particular commercial site is peddling. You’ll find more valuable information
by calling or visiting your county sheriff’s office or treasurer’s office.
Buying properties from the IRS
In most foreclosure situations, the IRS releases any lien it has on the prop-
erty. The investor who buys the senior lien must provide the IRS with 30
days’ notice, just in case the IRS decides that it wants to redeem the property
and try to sell it to recover lost tax revenue, but the IRS usually passes on
such deals. Sometimes, however, the IRS takes possession of the property
and sells it at auction.
To find out about properties that the IRS has for sale and obtain more infor-
mation about upcoming auctions, visit wwww.treas.gov/auctions/irs/,
scroll down the page, and click Real Estate. If you see a property that looks
interesting, click its link to view a description of it along with information on
the date, time, and location of the sale; encumbrances against the property;
contact information about the person in charge of disbursing the property;
and a link to a form for mailing in your bid.
Assuming you submit the winning bid, you typically have to come up with
about 20 percent of the purchase price immediately for a down payment, and
the remainder is due within 30 days of purchase. The homeowners have 120
days to redeem the property, but check to make sure, just in case the IRS
changes its rules.
Before placing a bid, inspect the property with your own two eyes and research
the title, just as you would do prior to making an offer on any home. The IRS
site lists encumbrances against the property, but it may have additional liens
that the IRS doesn’t know about. 
221
Chapter 13: Finding and Buying Government Repos

Contacting your county treasurer’s office 
Your county treasurer’s office or property tax division is the best place to
start your search for information about tax sales, particularly property
tax sales. Visit the treasurer’s office or whichever county office handles
the tax sales and try to obtain the following information:
 Bidder’s packet: Many counties put together a bidder’s packet with gen-
eral information for investors. For a small fee, you can obtain most of
the basic information you need about tax sales in your county.
 Property list: As the date nears for the property tax sale, the county
treasurer may offer a list of all the properties that will be auctioned. The
problem with such a list is that it’s generally a list in progress up until
the date of the sale.
 Regulations: If your bidder’s packet does not contain information about
how redemptions are handled for property tax sales, ask. Different states
and counties may handle this differently. During the writing of this book,
Michigan’s tax sales gave homeowners no redemption rights. Once you
purchase a property at a tax sale, the homeowners have no chance to
redeem it. Find out the rules that govern tax sales in your county.
The rules and regulations regarding tax sales are very complex and vary from
state to state. The entire delinquent tax foreclosure process can take any-
where from three to seven years from the time a homeowner stops paying
taxes until the time the government takes possession of the property and
puts it up for sale. In that time, the taxing authority attempts to contact the
homeowners and anyone else who has a lien on the property, giving them the
opportunity to pay the back taxes. In most cases, someone who has an inter-
est in the property ponies up the money and takes controlling interest in the
property. Contact your real estate attorney to find out more about how tax
sales are handled in your area. 
Taking a trip to the department 
of transportation
The department of transportation (DOT) commonly purchases real estate
when building or widening roads or making other improvements to the infra-
structure. If the property is not destroyed during the construction project,
the department of transportation puts it up for sale. Often, you can buy prop-
erty directly from the DOT or through an auction at a deep discount.
Contact your state department of transportation for leads on properties they
may currently have for sale. They may list the property with a particular
222
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

broker or post notices in specific legal publications. Find out who’s in charge,
call and introduce yourself as an investor, and ask if they have any properties
for sale. In many cases, the properties consist only of land, but occasionally,
you find a property that has a house on it. 
Some DOT Web sites list the properties they have for sale online. Oregon’s
DOT has a special section on its Web site for property management (www.
oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/PROPMGT/). Michigan’s DOT also provides informa-
tion about excess properties at www.michigan.gov/mdot/. On most DOT
Web sites, however, you won’t find much about properties for sale, so you
have to make phone contact. The U. S. Department of Transportation also
ends up owning property after completing construction projects. To track
down properties owned by the feds, you have better luck visiting the sites
listed in the next section than trying to wade through the USDOT site.
Finding government-seized property online
You can poke around on the Web to find Web sites of various federal, state,
and local agencies that seize and dispose of real estate. Use your favorite
search tool to look for “government seized property,” “government-seized
properties,” or “government-seized real estate.” Use your imagination to
come up with other search phrases, such as your county or state followed by
“seized property.” Be sure to check out the following sites:
 Real Estate for Sale from Government Surplus & Foreclosures at www.
firstgov.gov/shopping/realestate/realestate.shtml. It fea-
tures several groups of links for Commercial Buildings and Land, Farms
and Ranches, Single Family Homes, and State and Local Government
Sales. Follow the trail of links to your desired destination.
 US Treasure Customs Seizures at www.treas.gov/auctions/customs/
realprop.html. This site features a list of properties that the U.S. gov-
ernment has seized and put up for auction online. In most cases, these
properties have been seized because they were purchased with drug
money or other funds from criminal activity. Discover more about the
auction process at this site.
 USDA Real Estate for Sale at www.resales.usda.gov. This site dis-
plays links to single-family or multi-family properties. Simply click the
link and follow the trail of maps to your state and county to find out
whether any USDA properties are for sale in your neighborhood.
 Office of Property Disposals at propertydisposal.gsa.gov/
Property/. This Web site provides access to information about prop-
erties owned and for sale by the federal government, such as land and
buildings made available by base closings or federal marshal property
seizures.
223
Chapter 13: Finding and Buying Government Repos

If you’re looking for properties that law enforcement agencies have seized
from drug dealers, racketeers, and other criminals, you may not have much
luck contacting the law enforcement agencies. They usually prefer to place a
lien on the property and collect some money later — when the property is
sold or the mortgage is refinanced. Sometimes the mortgage company offers
to pay the lien to protect their interest. In the rare case in which law enforce-
ment does take possession of a property, they typically sell it through an auc-
tion house or real estate broker.

 Getting leads on properties in bankruptcy
 Maneuvering when a foreclosure you bought ends up in bankruptcy
W
hen you’re focused on foreclosures, you may overlook another 
foreclosure-related opportunity — bankruptcies. If financially
strapped homeowners file for bankruptcy, they shut down the foreclosure
process, buy themselves some time to restructure their finances, and buy
you some additional time to work your magic. 
Dealing in bankruptcies can be even more complicated than trying to acquire
a foreclosure property. In most cases, you can’t simply deal with the home-
owner or bid at an auction. You have to work with the homeowners’ attorney
or the court-appointed trustee, who is committed to selling the property for
fair market value or at least a fairly decent price. Even if you obtain the attor-
ney’s or trustee’s approval, creditors may oppose the sale of the property in
court. To turn a profit with bankruptcies, you really need to know your stuff. 
This chapter delivers tips and tricks to improve your odds of success and
shows you what to do when a property you purchased in foreclosure ends up
in bankruptcy court.
Acquiring bankruptcy properties can be a royal pain, which is exactly why
most real estate investors avoid them like the plague. If you’re a novice investor,
I suggest you do the same. Because so many investors steer clear of proper-
ties in bankruptcy, however, the opportunities are more plentiful for anyone
who can learn the ropes. Just make sure you have an attorney who special-
izes in bankruptcy in your corner.

Brushing Up on Bankruptcy Laws
Filing for bankruptcy is like pressing the Pause button on your DVD player. It
stops everything . . . or in legal parlance, it stays everything. It stops foreclo-
sure (only temporarily). It freezes the bill collectors. It transforms the bank-
ruptcy filer’s loose collection of assets into an estate, from which nothing can
move until the bankruptcy courts and trustee can resolve disputes.
As an investor, you’re frozen, too. You can no longer negotiate with the home-
owners. The home becomes part of the estate, which may need to be sold to
pay outstanding debts. If you’re already in the midst of negotiations, you must
include, in your offer, that your offer is subject to the bankruptcy court’s or
trustee’s approval. Small claims court (a district court) has the most power
in bankruptcy.
In the following sections, I explain the differences between the two main
types of bankruptcy you’re likely to encounter — Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.
Consult an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy for specific rules that
apply to bankruptcies in your area. Pay close attention to any rules governing
what you can and cannot do as an investor.
Selling assets through 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy
Homeowners filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy hand over control of all of their
assets to a court-appointed trustee. The court empowers the trustee to liqui-
date the assets in order to pay any claims against the estate, including back
taxes, unpaid mortgages, and credit card debt.
When you’re negotiating for the purchase of a home that’s part of a Chapter 7
bankruptcy, you deal with a court-appointed trustee. You may present your
offer to the homeowners, but that offer must state that it is subject to the
trustee’s approval.
Restructuring debt through 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy
In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, people seek to restructure their debt — that’s a
fancy way of saying that they work out some sort deal with the people to
whom they owe money (the creditors). Restructuring may include selling
226
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

some assets, including the bankruptcy filer’s home, assuming they own 
a home.
When you’re negotiating for the purchase of a home that’s part of a Chapter
13 bankruptcy, you deal with the homeowner’s attorney and must present
your offer to the attorney.
Knowing When to Purchase
Acquiring bankruptcy properties requires a great deal of patience. When
people normally buy a house, they present an offer, the seller responds in a
day or two, negotiations proceed for a few days, and then the buyer and
seller meet at closing and seal the deal. When you make an offer on a prop-
erty in bankruptcy, the seller may still be able to negotiate with you, but the
sale must be approved by the trustee or the courts. In addition, the trustee
must notify all creditors of your offer, and they must sign off on it. In many
cases, the creditors object to the sale.
227
Chapter 14: Banking on Bankruptcies
The value of a good attorney
After I purchased a foreclosure property at auc-
tion, the homeowner filed for bankruptcy. She
had a great attorney. I didn’t. 
Two courts became involved in the proceedings —
the bankruptcy court was dealing with the
bankruptcy, while the district court was han-
dling the foreclosure proceedings. Despite the
fact that the homeowner had filed for bank-
ruptcy, the district court gave us permission to
proceed with the eviction. Shortly after the
court-appointed officers showed up at the
house to evict the homeowner, the homeowner
showed up with her attorney and then pro-
ceeded to attack and bite one of the police 
officers. She was escorted to jail. After her
release, she sued everyone involved. The police
dropped all charges.
My attorney did a little more research on bank-
ruptcy law and discovered a few additional items
he had overlooked. We moved the homeowner’s
possessions back into her house, and the bank-
ruptcy court called an emergency hearing. The
bankruptcy judge ordered the district court
judge and the court officer who had been bitten
to testify and requested that I testify, as well.
After gathering testimony, the judge handed
down his verdict. The homeowner was allowed
to live in the house for another six months for
free, and I was ordered to pay her $20,000.
I had all the right paperwork, all the right judg-
ments, but the wrong attorney. He was not well
versed in bankruptcy. The homeowner, how-
ever, had chosen the right attorney, and it made
all the difference. 
Shop for an attorney the same way you shop for
a doctor. A general practitioner is okay for gen-
eral legal issues, but when you’re dealing with
bankruptcy, hire a bankruptcy specialist.

Knowing when to purchase a property is often the key to acquiring it.
Following are the various stages in the bankruptcy process along with some
tips on how to more effectively position yourself at each stage:
 Prior to the bankruptcy filing: At this stage, you can present your pur-
chase agreement to the homeowners and deal with them as you would if
you were following the standard operating procedure of buying a home.
Unfortunately, at this stage, homeowners who are planning to file for
bankruptcy are often reluctant to accept anything less than full market
value.
 Debtor in possession stage: Upon filing for bankruptcy, the homeowners
remain in possession of the property and can accept offers and negoti-
ate the sale. The bankruptcy attorney or court-appointed trustee, how-
ever, is legally obligated to notify the creditors, and they must approve
the sale. At this stage, you’re even more unlikely to obtain the property
for a price significantly below market value.
 Liquidation stage: At the liquidation stage, control of the property is
transferred to the trustee. Unless the judge objects, the trustee is in 
control of the property and chooses the most attractive offer. This is
usually the best time to make your move. Although a creditor can object
at this point, the trustee has the power to overrule the objection. Of
course, the trustee also has the power to reject your offer and hand the
property over to one of the creditors. Dealing with the creditors is often
your key to acquiring the property at this stage. 
 Post liquidation: If one of the creditors buys or is given the property
during the liquidation stage, you may be able to purchase the property
from the creditor. This is another excellent opportunity to purchase the
property, especially if you’ve established a solid relationship with the
creditor.
What happens if the homeowners file for bankruptcy after you’ve purchased
the property at auction? The bankruptcy court may now consider you to be a
claimant or creditor, and contacting the homeowners at this point may vio-
late the bankruptcy code. Consult a qualified bankruptcy attorney if you find
yourself in such a situation. If you’re able to work out a deal with the home-
owners and you manage to structure the deal in a way that gets you more
money than you would otherwise be entitled to, the court may decide that
you received a preference, which means that you may be required to disgorge
(pay back) the excess and then some.
Never contact the homeowners before consulting an attorney who’s well-versed
in bankruptcy law in your area. In some cases, you may be able to work out a
deal that’s acceptable to both the homeowners and their creditors, but this
situation is like tip-toeing through a minefield. If the homeowners perceive
you as working on behalf of the lenders to circumvent their bankruptcy pro-
tection, they can have you hauled into court, and you’re likely to find your-
self paying a hefty penalty. 
228
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

Tracking Down Houses in Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy is not a private affair. As soon as someone files for bankruptcy,
the attorney handling the bankruptcy records the bankruptcy filing and posts
a notice in the local paper or legal publication. This provides you with sev-
eral resources to find out about properties in foreclosure:
 Local paper
 County legal news
 Bankruptcy filings at the county courthouse
 Court-appointed bankruptcy trustees
 Personal bankruptcy attorneys
In the following sections, I show you how to tap into these resources for
leads on prospective investment properties.
You often obtain some of your best leads on bankruptcy properties by being
involved with homeowners during the foreclosure process. Your prior dealings
with the homeowners and their lenders give you a significant advantage in
the bankruptcy arena, because you know what’s going on and already have
established relationships with most of the parties who are involved. 
As mentioned in the previous section, when dealing with homeowners who’ve
filed for bankruptcy, be particularly careful. Don’t represent yourself as some-
thing you’re not — if you’re not an attorney, let the homeowners know that up
front. Tell them that you’re an investor who may be able to assist them in work-
ing out a win-win transaction. If the homeowners even mention bankruptcy, sug-
gest that they seek independent counsel or ask them to sign a waiver that you
offered this suggestion and they decided not to purse this option. If the relation-
ship sours later on and the homeowners claim that you advised them against
seeking counsel, a signed waiver provides you some valuable legal protection.
Skimming publications for 
bankruptcy notices
In Chapter 7, I direct your attention to foreclosure listings or NODs (Notices
of Default) that appear in local papers or your county’s legal news publica-
tions. You can find bankruptcy notices in these same publications.
Check the Public Notices section of your local newspaper’s classifieds to find
listings of bankruptcies that have been filed in your area. Your county’s legal
news publication should also have a section devoted exclusively to bank-
ruptcy filings.
229
Chapter 14: Banking on Bankruptcies

The bankruptcy notice contains the information you need to get started,
including the homeowners’ names and the attorney’s or trustee’s name and
contact information.
Researching bankruptcy filings
Whether you’re looking for leads on properties in bankruptcy or have found a
lead and want more information, head down to the bankruptcy court at your
county’s courthouse and request to see the recent bankruptcy filings.
Examine the documents for the following bits of information:
 Names of the people filing or bankruptcy
 Whether the husband and wife filed jointly
 Whether bankruptcy was filed under Chapter 7 or 13
 The name of the trustee, if a trustee was appointed
 Whether the house is included in the bankruptcy
 The home’s stated value, if included in the filing
 How much of the equity can be protected 
 The names of any creditors who’ve been contacted and whether any of
the creditors filed an objection at the confirmation hearing
 The acting attorney’s name and contact information
 The schedule for proceedings
 If the bankruptcy hasn’t been confirmed when the property will be
placed back on the foreclosure docket
 Whether or not the lender has moved to lift the stay
You can subscribe to an online service for access to bankruptcy filings. I use
a service called Pacer, which you can find at pacer.psc.uscourts.gov.
Networking with the gatekeepers
Personal bankruptcy attorneys and court-appointed trustees are the gate-
keepers who protect those who file for bankruptcy from the bill collectors
and from anyone who’s seeking to benefit from the misfortune of having to
file for bankruptcy, and that includes you. 
230
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

Although these attorneys may function as speed bumps in your pursuit of
investment properties, they can also be a valuable asset. They’re typically
less involved emotionally, making them easier to deal with, and if you show
up with the cash necessary to purchase a home and expedite the liquidation
process, an attorney may regard you as an ally.
Get to know the personal bankruptcy attorneys and trustees in your area.
Consider sending a letter of introduction to these attorneys, informing them
of what you do and explaining your desire to create a mutually beneficial,
long-term relationship. Figure 14-1 shows a sample letter.

Dealing with the Gatekeepers
To acquire a property that ends up in bankruptcy court, you have to serve
two masters — the bankruptcy attorney or trustee and the homeowners. In
bankruptcy, the legal people are your main contacts at this point, but if you
were working with the homeowners prior to the date on which they filed for
bankruptcy, you can leverage your relationship with them to influence the
decisions.
In the following sections, I provide some tips on how to team up effectively
with court-appointed trustees, personal bankruptcy attorneys, and home-
owners to liquidate assets and perhaps purchase the home.
Don’t toss around terms when you’re unsure of their meaning. Terms that
have an every day meaning to us common-folk may have an entirely different
meaning for an attorney. If the attorney thinks you’re using the term the same
way she uses it, the two of you create a disconnect that may lead to a costly
miscommunication. It can also compromise your credibility if the attorney
realizes that you really don’t know what you’re talking about and are simply
blowing smoke.
Cooperating with bankruptcy trustees
In deed of trust states, the court appoints a trustee to carry out the liquida-
tion of property, maximize the amount that goes to the creditors, and dismiss
as many claims from creditors as possible. In other words, the court passes
control of the situation to the trustee and essentially says, “You sort out this
mess in a way that’s fairly equitable for all parties involved.”
When dealing with a trustee, realize that this person has a court mandate to
sell the property for as much money as possible in a relatively short period
of time. As an investor, the best approach is to present a fair offer that gives
you a sufficient profit and doesn’t turn the trustee against you. If your offer is
laughable, you not only risk losing this property, but you also jeopardize any
future relationship with the trustee. 
Teaming up with bankruptcy attorneys
Bankruptcy attorneys serve both their clients and themselves. Most of their
clients don’t have deep pockets, so the longer the proceedings drag on, the
less they earn per hour of their time. This gives you some room to haggle.
232
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

Realize, however, that your haggle room varies greatly depending on the
attorney’s motivation and skill:
 Self-interested attorney: Self-interested attorneys are more motivated to
serve themselves. These attorneys typically file bankruptcy for anyone
who’s interested in filing, regardless of whether the homeowners qualify
or will benefit from it. These attorneys simply want to make money and
may pressure the homeowner to sell the property quickly. These situa-
tions are often attractive to investors like you.
 Homeowner-centered attorney: Homeowner-centered attorneys truly
represent the homeowner’s best interests. They won’t file for bank-
ruptcy if the homeowner is unlikely to qualify, and they won’t let an
investor push the homeowner around. These attorneys know how to
play the legal system and can make your life a living hell if you’re not
pitching what the attorney considers a fair offer. 
Getting the homeowners on your side
Bankruptcy protects homeowners from the bill collectors and anyone else
who may be perceived as pressuring the homeowners for money or property,
including you. If you try to skirt the law and strike a deal with the homeown-
ers, you could find yourself in front of a judge and facing a stiff penalty.
Before contacting the homeowners, take the following precautions:
 Contact your attorney. Hire an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy
and obtain advice on whether you have the legal right to contact the
homeowners directly. Also ask for advice and guidelines on how to
approach the homeowners and what you can and cannot do as an
investor when homeowners have bankruptcy protection.
 Contact the trustee or homeowner’s attorney. Always keep the trustee
or homeowners’ attorney in the loop. Present any offer to the trustee or
attorney to obtain court approval for the sale.
By establishing a strong relationship with the homeowners, as discussed in
Chapter 9, you place yourself in a great position to eventually purchase the
property should the homeowners choose to sell it. Don’t compromise your
good position by trying to work around the bankruptcy attorney or trustee.
Getting the creditors on your side
Homeowners often file for bankruptcy in response to a lender (creditor) initiat-
ing the foreclosure process. The homeowners are rarely looking for a way to
233
Chapter 14: Banking on Bankruptcies

restructure their payments, and the finance restructuring plans they and their
attorneys submit are usually flawed. They’re often designed not to enable the
homeowner to pay the creditors but to keep the house without paying.
Needless to say, most lenders are not content to patiently watch the bank-
ruptcy proceedings run their course. The lender often challenges the bank-
ruptcy claim and seeks to have the stay lifted, so it can proceed with the
foreclosure process. In many cases, they succeed.
When a lender is successful at lifting a stay, the bankruptcy is simply a speed
bump in your path to obtaining the property. You may be able to use this
speed bump to your advantage. As soon as the homeowners file for bank-
ruptcy and the auctioning of that property is adjourned, many investors lose
interest and drop out. If the stay is lifted and the foreclosure proceeds, you
may be the only one bidding on the property at auction, and you can buy the
property without the worry of a bankruptcy stay. Keep tracking properties,
especially when an auction is adjourned, so you’re prepared to bid in the
event that the property pops back up on the auction block.
Dealing with Bankruptcy Delays 
on a House You Bought
Although you can work the bankruptcy system to your advantage by pur-
chasing properties through the trustee or the homeowners’ attorney, bank-
ruptcy can often delay your ability to take possession of a house you bought
at auction. If the bankruptcy court grants a stay, you may be stuck holding a
house and paying the bills while the homeowners remain in possession well
past the expiration of the redemption period.
In the worst-case scenario, your profit is limited to the interest you charge
the homeowners on the purchase price you paid. If the homeowners manage
to redeem the property, they must pay you the purchase price plus interest
and reimburse you for any property taxes and homeowner’s insurance you
paid out of pocket.
To sweeten the deal and increase your profit on the property, the best
approach is to pitch a deal to the homeowners’ attorney or the bankruptcy
trustee. Following are a couple suggestions on deals that the homeowners
and the court may find appealing:
 Offer to lease the property to the homeowners. The homeowners and
the courts typically want to avoid a situation in which the homeowners
are evicted and have no place to live. By offering to lease the property to
the homeowners for a fixed period of time, you demonstrate your sensi-
tivity to their needs and give them a little extra time to find new living
arrangements.
234
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

 Structure a buy-back deal. To avoid a long bankruptcy delay, consider
selling the property back to the homeowners at a profit that’s perhaps
less than what you had hoped for. Why would the homeowners be will-
ing to buy back the house? Because challenging the sale can be costly
both in time and money. If the attorney involved can see the benefit of a
sure deal that will cost less in the long run, she may be willing to accept
it, particularly if accepting the offer ensures she’ll get paid. A sure deal
looks pretty good next to the alternative — a lengthy and expensive
courtroom battle.
When you meet up with a determined and well-qualified bankruptcy attorney,
be prepared to negotiate. I’ve had to deal with attorneys like this, and you
can benefit from my experience, as related in the following sidebar, “Playing
nice with the sharks.”
235
Chapter 14: Banking on Bankruptcies
Playing nice with the sharks
When dealing with a knowledgeable, skilled
bankruptcy attorney who’s sincerely represent-
ing the best interest of her clients, you’d better
learn to play nice. I learned my lesson the hard
way. Hopefully, you’ll learn the easy way by
taking heed of my warning and reading my
story.
I bought a house at auction and got a pretty
good deal on it. About a week prior to the expi-
ration of the redemption period, I received
notice that the homeowners had filed for bank-
ruptcy. “No biggie,” I thought. I’d seen this
before. It simply meant that I would have to 
wait a little longer to take possession of the
property . . . at least that’s what I thought.
To my dismay the homeowners had found an
attorney who really knew how bankruptcy
worked and how to use it to his clients’ best
advantage. Looking back, I commend the attor-
ney for fighting so strongly and so wisely, but at
the time he was a pain in my shorts and my
wallet. He managed to drag out the case for
weeks on end. While his clients remained firmly
planted in the house, I was footing the bill.
Just when I thought we would be wrapping the
whole thing up, I was told that the homeowners
would be seeking a jury trial. Now I’m no attor-
ney, and I don’t know what entitles you to a jury
trial, but I knew that a jury would quickly see me
as the big bad investor preying on the helpless
insolvent homeowners, even though the home-
owners got themselves into this mess and I did
everything by the book. To add insult to injury,
the attorney whispered to me at the preliminary
hearing that the judge scheduled to hear the
case would be heading to China for a three-
week vacation. 
I almost popped a gasket. I did everything right,
I had to defend myself in court, and now I was
going to have to wait for Marco Polo to return
from China to hear my case! That night, I
stewed the defensiveness right out of me and
decided to stop fighting the system. The next
time the attorney contacted me, I asked him,
“Do your clients want to just buy back the house
so we can put this behind us?” The attorney
responded, “I thought you’d never ask! We can
probably wrap this all up before her honor goes
on holiday.” 
The attorney was able to structure a deal for his
clients that allowed them to keep their house,
and I was able to make a fair profit on the buy
(continued)

As a general rule, I don’t like to be involved in bankruptcy buys, not because
there isn’t money to be made, but because I find that other investment oppor-
tunities are much more attractive and give me fewer headaches. Many real
estate investors like me also shy away from bankruptcy properties, however,
and that’s exactly the reason why some investors are so successful in this
area — they have less competition. If you do decide to work in the bank-
ruptcy arena, develop a strong knowledge of how bankruptcy works in your
area and don’t go it along — hire an experienced bankruptcy attorney to
serve as your Sherpa.
236
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 
back price. We obtained court approval, and the
whole fiasco disappeared as quickly as it had
first surfaced. The attorney and I have devel-
oped a relationship since then, and he explains
to me that he could easily have kept that prop-
erty tied up in the courts for two years, and
maybe I wouldn’t have even gotten the house. 
The moral of the story is that when meet up with
a stubborn attorney who knows his stuff, don’t
dig in your heels and flex your muscles. You may
need to take a different approach. Keep your
eyes on the prize — in this case, the profit —
and don’t let anger or self-righteousness drive
you into taking a no-win stance. Remain flexible
and look for win-win solutions.

Sampling Some Other 
Foreclosure Strategies
In This Chapter
 Selling short to boost your profit
 Buying and selling second mortgages and other junior liens
T
hroughout most of this book, I encourage you to purchase properties
directly from homeowners prior to auction or bid on properties at 
auction — to purchase senior liens. You can also make money in foreclosures
and improve your position as an investor by 
 Negotiating short sales — convincing lenders to accept a payoff of less
than the full amount owed.
 Purchasing junior liens — second mortgages and other claims against
the property. 
 Acquiring tax deeds or liens — paying back taxes to obtain a tax deed or
lien against the property. 
These strategies may even enable you to earn a profit without ever taking
possession of the property and having to deal with the hassles of owning,
selling, or leasing the property. They can also strengthen your position in
acquiring the senior lien and eventually taking possession of the property.
Buying junior liens without buying the senior lien is risky. If another investor
buys the senior lien and foreclosure wipes out the junior liens, you can end
up owning a worthless piece of paper. Don’t buy junior liens until you’ve read
through the following section and have some experience buying senior liens.
Negotiating Short Sales
Your parents probably told you never to “sell yourself short,” meaning that
you shouldn’t accept less than what you’re worth. When you’re investing in

foreclosures, however, you want the lien holders to sell themselves short by
agreeing to negotiate short sales — accepting less than they’re owed.
Lien holders who stand to lose something if a property goes into foreclosure
are often willing to accept less money than they’re owed. After all, less is
better than nothing or continuing to throw good money after bad.
In the following sections, I reveal the hierarchy of lien holders, so you know
which liens hold the most weight in foreclosure. I show you how to recognize
situations that are ideal short sales opportunities, and then I guide you
through the process of collaborating with the homeowners and lien holders
to structure a deal that meets the needs of everyone involved, including you.
Don’t start negotiating short sales until you’ve done your research on the
property, as discussed in Chapter 8, and carefully research the title. If you
overlook a single lien on a property, it can come back to bite you . . . or at
least bite a big chunk out of your profit.
Knowing the lien holder pecking order
Lien holders all lay claim to a property, but all liens are not created equal. By
assessing the strength of each lien holder’s position in line for receiving pay-
ment, you place yourself in a superior position to negotiate. Think of lien
holder positions as the value of each card in a deck of playing cards:
 Ace: The property tax collector generally holds the Ace, because fore-
closure can wipe out all other liens except the property tax lien. If you
can purchase the tax lien, you almost always hold controlling interest in
the property. The tax lien holder, however, must adhere to some strict
regulations regarding the notification of other lien holders.
 King: The lender with the first mortgage on the house holds the King.
The first-mortgage holder can always pay any back taxes that are due,
purchase the property at auction if nobody bids on it, wait for the
redemption period to expire (and wipe out the junior liens), and then
sell the property.
 Ten: The lender who owns the second mortgage (if a second mortgage is
in place) holds a Ten, but if the lender stands to lose a great deal of
money, the lender may be motivated to buy the first lien and pay any
back taxes to strengthen its position. The holder of a second mortgage,
however, is in a very weak position if the house isn’t worth the com-
bined value of the first and second mortgages but is worth the value of
the first mortgage. In such a case, the lender who owns the first mort-
gage has little motivation to negotiate with the owner of the second
mortgage.
238
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

 Three: Construction (mechanic’s) lien holders typically are the big losers
in foreclosure. Because foreclosure wipes out their position, they become
more and more motivated to negotiate a short sale as the foreclosure
sale or the end of the redemption period looms. If the homeowners agreed
to put up the construction asset as collateral for the loan, however, the
lien holder may qualify for a step up in position. For example, if the home-
owners took out a loan to build a new room on the house, that new room
may be what’s called a PMSI (Purchase Money Security Interest) that the
construction lien holder can lay claim to. This is a very complicated sit-
uation, so if you encounter such a situation, consult your attorney.
 Two: Legally speaking the IRS may have a stronger position than the
second mortgage or construction lien holders, but they rarely step in
and buy the property, so they hold the weakest card in the deck. The IRS
must be notified and offered the chance to purchase the property, but
that’s not likely to stop an auction from going forward. If you are not
confident that the IRS received a proper notice prior to the auction, you
may want to hold off on buying the property.
The lien hierarchy is determined primarily by the dates on which loans are
recorded against a property. The property tax lien is the strongest position,
typically followed by a first mortgage, because that’s the loan the homeown-
ers took out to buy the property, and then followed by other loans in order of
the date on which loan was recorded. In other words, if the homeowners took
out a first mortgage to buy the house, then financed new windows, and then
took out a second mortgage, you would probably be looking at the following
hierarchy (listed from strongest to weakest):
 Property tax lien (strongest).
 First mortgage.
 Construction loan (new windows).
 Second mortgage (weakest).
Of course, you can always have exceptions. The window company, for exam-
ple, may have and often does subordinate its position to the second mort-
gage holder, or the holder of the second mortgage may pay the window
company to “step up” into its position. Check the dates of recording on the
mortgages and look for any wording that specifically states whether one
mortgage is subordinate to another. 
Don’t confuse the date the mortgage was taken out with the date it was
recorded. If a mortgage is taken out in June 2005 and isn’t recorded until June
2006, and in between those two dates another mortgage is taken out and
recorded, the mortgage taken out in June 2005 loses its priority position.
Other conditions and exceptions may come into play, so when you’re just
starting out, consult a real estate attorney who has plenty of experience deci-
phering titles and mortgages.
239
Chapter 15: Sampling Some Other Foreclosure Strategies

The lien holder pecking order is important because it determines the winners
and losers after the auction — who gets paid and who doesn’t. Say a $200,000
property has a $6,000 tax lien against it, a $140,000 first mortgage, a $20,000
second mortgage, and a construction lien of $10,000. At the tax sale, an investor
may bid $160,000 for the $6,000 tax lien. The tax collector gets the first $6,000,
the first mortgage lender gets $140,000, the second mortgage lender gets
$14,000, and the holder of the construction lien walks away with nothing.
Of course, this example is a little odd, because the first mortgage holder
would probably pay the $6,000 in back taxes to protect their position rather
than let an investor buy the tax lien. I provide the example only to illustrate
who ends up with money and who doesn’t based on the strength of their
claim to the property.
Tax sale rules vary from state to state. In some states, the tax sale wipes out
all other liens, so if you buy the property at a tax sale, anything you pay in
excess of the taxes owed on the property goes to the state, and the other lien
holders receive nothing. Of course, prior to the tax sale, the other lien hold-
ers must be notified that their claims to the property will be wiped out by the
tax sale, so any lien holder with a major interest in the property is likely to
pony up the unpaid taxes. Consult your real estate attorney to find out more
about how tax sales are handled in your area.
Wheeling and dealing with lien holders
The lien holder pecking order is also very important to know when you’re
dealing with multiple lien holders who are all trying to protect their position.
Keep in mind that any lien holder who’s lower on the pecking order has the
right to buy out the positions of the other lien holders simply by paying off
the balance of the money owed them and any interest and associated costs. 
Say three lien holders (A, B, and C) have a stake in the property, with A hold-
ing the highest position and C holding the lowest. Depending on how much
equity is built up in the property, any of several scenarios can develop,
including the following:
 You buy A’s position (either at auction or directly from A) and wait for
redemption period to expire. B and C take no action, and their positions
are wiped out.
 You buy A’s position. B buys you out to protect its position and waits for
redemption period to expire to wipe out C’s position. You have to sell, but
you don’t have to discount, so you should at least get your money back.
 You buy A’s position. C buys out both you and B to protect its position.
240
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

 Another investor buys A’s position. You buy B’s position, giving you the
right to buy A’s position from the other investor, which you do, forcing C
to either buy you out or lose out entirely.
 You buy A’s position and then buy B’s and C’s position (typically by
paying them less than the total of what they’re owed via a short-sale
agreement). Why buy out B and C? If the property has a lot of equity in
it, buying out B and C prevents them from buying your position and pre-
vents other investors from buying B’s or C’s position and then attempt-
ing to buy you out.
 You buy A’s position, and then, during the redemption period, the home-
owner redeems the property (buys you out).
As you can see, the wheeling and dealing can get pretty complicated. Later in
this chapter, in the section “Negotiating with the lien holders,” I show you
how a typical negotiation is likely to play out.
Recognizing a short sale opportunity
Some scenarios are more conducive to short sales than others. If the prop-
erty has little equity in it and is unlikely to draw bids at auction, the senior
lien holder is looking at getting stuck with the hassle and cost of preparing
the property for market and selling it. They may prefer to accept less than
the full amount owed just to cut their losses. 
If the senior lien holder has no reason to bargain, you may be able to
strengthen your negotiating position by working out short-sale agreements
with junior lien holders. If a bank holds the senior lien on a very valuable
piece of property, for instance, the bank probably won’t accept less than the
full amount owed on the property. By convincing junior lien holders to accept
less than the full amount owed on their loans, you may place yourself in a
position in which you can afford to buy out the senior lien holder’s position.
Following are descriptions of situations that are excellent opportunities for
negotiating short sales with junior lien holders:
 The property has two or more liens on it, and the senior lien holder is
foreclosing. This starts the clock ticking for the junior lien holders.
Unless they purchase the senior lien holder’s position, they stand to
lose everything. An offer from an investor like you to a junior lien holder,
even if that offer is for 30 or 40 cents on a dollar, is better than nothing.
 Unpaid taxes have driven the homeowners into foreclosure. Again, the
junior lien holders are in the unsavory position of having their interests
wiped off the books.
241
Chapter 15: Sampling Some Other Foreclosure Strategies

 The senior lien is larger than any of the junior liens. If a junior lien
holder has more to lose than the senior lien holder, the junior lien holder
is likely to buy the senior lien holder’s position rather than negotiate
with you for pennies on a dollar. When the senior lien is much larger,
however, the junior lien holder rarely ties up more of its money by buying
the senior lien position and is more likely to negotiate with you.
 Multiple junior lien holders lay claim to the property but the senior
lien is not worth more than 75 percent of the property’s market value.
All the liens can total more than the house is worth, but if the senior lien
position gives you at least a 25 percent profit margin to negotiate, the
lien holders should be willing to work with you. 
Teaming up with the homeowners
You can’t negotiate short sales without the homeowners’ cooperation. They
must sign a release, provided in Chapter 9, giving you permission to discuss
their finances with the lien holders and negotiate short sales on their behalf.
Let the homeowners know that by empowering you to negotiate the short
sales, they retain more control of the situation, may be able to avoid foreclo-
sure, and, if they eventually decide to sell the property to you, stand to earn
more money from the transaction.
You may be able to purchase a lien holder’s position directly from the lien
holder without the consent or cooperation of the homeowners, but if you’re
working on behalf of the homeowners, most lien holders cannot and will not
discuss the situation with you until they have a signed authorization from the
homeowners. If you happen upon a lender willing to sell you seconds (second
lien holder positions), keep the information under lock and key — buying
seconds can be an effective strategy for gaining control of a property. See
“Buying and Selling Junior Liens,” later in this chapter.
Before you start calling lien holders, consider how you’re going to profit from
the short sales. You can profit in any of the following three ways:
 Buy the house. Present the homeowners with your offer to purchase the
property conditional upon your ability to successfully negotiate the short
sales. See Chapter 10 for details on presenting your purchase agreement. 
 Charge the homeowners for your services. Contract with the home-
owners to negotiate the short sales for a fee. Consult your real estate
attorney to draw up a suitable contract.
 Foreclose on the house yourself. If the homeowners aren’t willing to work
with you, you can still negotiate with the lenders and perhaps purchase
the first mortgage position, giving you the right to foreclose and ultimately
take possession of the property. You can even buy a junior lien and fore-
close on the house, but be careful and check out “Buying and Selling Junior
Liens,” later in this chapter, before attempting this strategy.
242
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

Without a purchase agreement in place, you may negotiate the short sales,
getting the homeowners out of foreclosure, and then have the homeowners
say “Thanks,” and cut you out of the deal. Unless you own the property tax
lien or the first mortgage lien, always have a signed purchase agreement with
the homeowner or a signed contract stating how the homeowners will pay
you if you are successful in negotiating short sales that save them from 
foreclosure.
Gathering payoff amounts
The first step in negotiating short sales consists of gathering some basic
information — the amount required to pay off each loan in full by a specific
date. Call each lien holder and ask them to explain the procedure for request-
ing payoff amounts. 
In most cases, the lien holder requires that you fax or mail a letter to the lien
holder. In your letter, provide the following:
 Borrowers’ names
 Account number
 Property address
 Date of payoff 
 Your contact information
 The signed release from the homeowners giving the lender permission
to share the information with you
 A request that the payoff letter be faxed or mailed to you
Specify a payoff date that’s at least one month away or a day or two before
the homeowners are due to lose their home in foreclosure, so you have time
to negotiate with other lien holders. All of your negotiations should be
wrapped up prior to the payoff date; otherwise, a lien holder may retract its
offer. Give yourself plenty of time to negotiate.
Crunching the numbers
When you receive the payoff letters from the lien holders, you now know
exactly how much the homeowners will owe on the payoff date. With this
information in hand, you’re now ready to calculate the total amount required
to pay off all balances in full. Use the form in Figure 15-1 to perform your cal-
culations. Figure 15-2 shows a completed form.
243
Chapter 15: Sampling Some Other Foreclosure Strategies

If you don’t know how much you’re prepared to pay for the property, refer to
Chapter 10 to project your profit and determine a maximum amount you’re
willing to pay. You can then work back to adjust the short-sale payoff amounts.
As a general rule, the lower the lien holder’s position in the pecking order, the
bigger the discount he’s likely to accept.
Say you perform your calculations using the Deal Analysis Worksheet in
Chapter 10 and decide that your top offer for the property would be $111,600.

Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

Using the information shown in Figure 15-2, you can now work backward to
identify opportunities for short sales:
 The balance on the first mortgage from City Mortgage is $84,349.42.
Because the estimated property value is $144,000, City Mortgage is
highly unlikely to agree to a short sale. It would be better off owning the
property. You’re going to have to pay the full $84,349.42. That leaves you
about $27,251 for paying off the other lien holders without exceeding
your top offer of $111,600. 
 Capital Source holds the second mortgage of $39,208.16. This is a perfect
opportunity for a short sale. Capital Source stands to lose the entire
amount of the foreclosure proceeds to conclusion and the homeowners
fail to redeem the property. They may be willing to accept $24,000 to
assign the lien to you, in which case the homeowners owe you the
$39,208.16. This places you in a prime position to buy the first mortgage
at auction. See the following section for details.
 Jackson Heating & Cooling holds a construction lien of $10,680.00. It’s in
a very weak position and is unlikely to buy the first mortgage of $84,349.42
to protect its position. It would be very likely to sell you its position for
$2,000–$3,000. 
 The IRS is also unlikely to invest $84,349.42 to protect its $16,803.43
position. If you can convince the IRS to release its claim, you won’t have
to pay them a cent.
Assuming your negotiations unfold according to plan, you pay City Mortgage
$84,349.42, Capital Source $24,000, and Jackson Heating & Cooling a cool $3,000
(at the most), for a grand total of $111,349.42, slightly below your target of
$111,600.
Negotiating with the lien holders
When you know where all the lien holders stand, you can begin calling them
and negotiating your short sales. You can’t negotiate the property tax lien,
but you can negotiate short sales on the other liens. The following sections
provide some guidance on how to proceed, but every situation is different, 
so use your noodle and plan the strategy that you think is likely to be most
effective. 
If you have a purchase agreement signed by the homeowners stipulating that
the sale of the property hinges on your ability to successfully negotiate short
sales, present copies to the lien holders. Explain that you’re structuring a
deal to minimize the lien holders’ losses and that all of the lien holders must
agree to the deal for it to succeed . . . and for them to receive payment.
245
Chapter 15: Sampling Some Other Foreclosure Strategies

If the property has a property tax lien against it, use that to your negotiating
advantage. Tell the lenders that if they don’t work with you, they can expect
to incur another $5,000 expense (or however much the tax lien is). This lets
the lender know that it can automatically offer you a $5,000 discount without
losing anything. To make it worth your while, request a discount in excess of
what’s owed in property taxes. If the lender discounts from $25,000 down to
$20,000, and you have to pay $5,000 in taxes, you’re not really getting any-
thing. If it discounts down to $17,000 or $18,000, you immediately increase
your profit margin. Crunch the numbers, stick to your guns, and remember
that the closer you get to the date on which the junior lien holder is sched-
uled to lose everything, the more negotiating power you have. Just be sure
you’re able to act quickly and buy the first mortgage to protect your position,
or you’ll lose everything.
When buying liens, request an assignment of interest or assignment of lien or
mortgage from the lien holder and have your attorney look it over and
approve it before proceeding and before handing over the check. After
obtaining the assignment, run it down to the register of deeds or county
clerk’s office to have it recorded.
Negotiating a release with the IRS first
The IRS is often willing to release its lien on the property, simply because it’s
not all that interested in buying the first lien to protect its position. In addi-
tion, the IRS may be able to pursue the homeowners for unpaid taxes even if
its lien is wiped out by the foreclosure.
Call your local IRS field office and request the name and contact information
for the person in charge of real estate liens. Call the person in charge and ask
whether the IRS would release its lien if the property changes hands. Unless
the amount owed to the IRS is huge and the property is worth enough to jus-
tify the IRS paying off the first lien, it’s likely to agree to releasing its lien. Just
make sure you get the release in writing.
The IRS is likely to release its lien and its usually takes the longest to get back
with you, so contact the IRS first. While you’re waiting to hear from the IRS,
continue negotiating with the other lien holders.
Dealing with first mortgage lenders
Because the first mortgage holder is near the top of the lien holder pecking
order (just below the property tax lien), it acts as puppet master, pulling the
strings that control the entire outcome. In some cases, however, even the first
lien holder’s position can be weakened, such as in the following scenarios:
 The property is not worth significantly more than the first mortgage
payoff. If the remaining balance is $85,000, and the home is worth only
$15,000 more than that ($100,000), the bank is unlikely to profit much by
taking possession of the property and selling it. The repairs and holding
246
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

costs alone are likely to gobble up that $15,000, and the bank won’t want
the hassle.
 The unpaid property taxes are high. Remember, the property tax col-
lector gets paid first. If the homeowners owe $30,000 in property taxes
on a house that’s worth $150,000, and the first mortgage balance is
$105,000, the bank would have to pay $135,000 to acquire the property
and would stand to gain a maximum of $15,000 minus the costs to repair
and sell the property.
If you crunch the numbers and the result shows that first lien holder has
something to lose or at least nothing to gain from the foreclosure, contact
them, lay out the numbers, and consider offering to buy their position for
less than the full payoff amount. Once you take possession of the first lien
and pay the back taxes, you have control of the property. If the homeowners
refuse to sell the property to you, you can foreclose on them. Even if they
redeem the property, you earn a profit, because you purchased the note for
less than the full payoff amount.
Don’t overlook the tax lien. If you purchase the first mortgage and forget to
pay any property taxes that are due, another investor can buy the tax lien
and cut you out of the deal. Make sure nobody has purchased the tax lien and
then calculate the back taxes into the equation. You want to make sure that if
the homeowners do redeem the property, you’re still in a position to profit
from the deal.
Contacting construction lien holders
Construction lien holders, like Jackson Heating & Cooling (see Figure 15-2) are
often difficult to deal with. They’ve been stiffed by the homeowners, and their
emotions run high. They may not understand the foreclosure process and are
often reluctant to deal with an investor who’s offering pennies on a dollar.
The most effective way to negotiate a short sale with a lien holder who’s in 
a weak position is to let the facts speak for themselves. With Jackson Heating
& Cooling, for instance, you could say something like, “I’m negotiating with
the senior lien holder. If they agree to sell to me I won’t need to buy your
position at all. If you decide to sell to me before I work out a deal with the
senior lien holder, then I’ll honor that deal. You could pay off the first and
second mortgages to the tune of $123,557.58, foreclose on the property, and
hope to recover your loss by selling it, but that’s a costly proposition both in
time and money. You could do nothing and I could almost guarantee that
you’ll lose your entire $10,680 at the foreclosure sale. Or, you can accept my
offer of $3,000. I’m not trying to play hardball, but I wanted to give you the
option to make an informed decision. I understand the position you’re in with
not being paid for the quality work you’ve done.” Any reasonable person
would take the $3,000.
247
Chapter 15: Sampling Some Other Foreclosure Strategies

Contacting other major lenders
Lenders who hold second or third lien positions on the house (second or
third mortgages) are next in line to get paid. The first challenge you face in
dealing with these lien holders is tracking down the person in charge of
making the decisions. At a larger bank, ask to speak with the manager of the
foreclosures or loss mitigation department. At smaller banks, request to
speak with the person in charge of buying and selling mortgages.
Dealing with major lenders is often easier than dealing with small businesses,
such as those that may be holding construction liens, because major lenders
know how the game is played and are often less emotionally involved. They
take a rational look at the numbers, know what they have to lose in foreclo-
sure, and understand what they have to gain by working with you. Major
lenders are often willing to sell you the mortgage note (promise to pay) at a
discount to cut their losses and pass the problem along to you.
Take a look at the numbers in Figure 15-2. Capital Source holds the second
mortgage of $39,208.16, which it stands to lose in foreclosure. It’s going to be
highly motivated to agree to a short sale, so it walks away with something. 
Say the IRS releases its lien of $16,803.43 and Jackson Heating & Cooling sells
its position to you for $3,000. You now have $24,250.58 remaining to buy
Capital Source’s position and hit your target of paying $111,600 for the house.
Sure, your offer is $15,000 short of the second mortgage payoff amount, but
Capital Source gets a sure thing — over $24,000 — and it doesn’t have to
worry about losing everything in foreclosure.
Capital Source can respond to your generous offer in any of several ways:
 Reject it outright. Not likely, because you showed them the numbers,
and this is the most they can hope to get out of the deal.
 Release the lien. They agree to accept your offer as full payment. You
pay off the mortgage balance to City Mortgage. You pay Jackson Heating
& Cooling its $3,000, and the IRS releases its lien. You close on the house
and are now the proud owner of an investment property.
 Assign the mortgage note to you. Assigning the mortgage note consists
of passing the ownership of the debt to you, which places you in an
excellent position for buying the first mortgage at auction. You don’t
even have to pay Jackson Heating & Cooling the $3,000, because you
now hold a higher lien position. That extra money can come in handy
when auction day rolls around.
The concept of assigning a mortgage note is a little complicated, so here’s an
example of how it could play out in our example:
248
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

 You buy the mortgage assignment for $24,000.
 When the first mortgage goes up for auction, bidding is likely to start at
about $84,000 — the full payoff amount to City Mortgage.
 You bid $123,000, because you own the $39,208.16 debt assigned to you
by Capital Source. ($84,000 first mortgage plus $39,000 debt assignment
equals $123,000.) Why bid so high? See the next bullet item.
 Nobody is likely to outbid you, because the profit margin just isn’t there,
but if someone does outbid you, you still profit. Here’s how it works: By
bidding $123,000, you guarantee yourself an overbid of $39,000. If
nobody outbids you, you own the house and can then apply for the
$39,000 in overbid money, which you are eligible for as the second lien
holder. You end up paying $108,000 for the house ($84,000 plus the
$24,000 you paid to Capital Source). If someone does outbid you, you
still collect the $39,000 overbid. Subtract the $24,000 you paid for the
assignment of debt, and you earn a $15,000 profit free and clear. 
How do you earn a $15,000 profit? Doesn’t that overbid money go to the
homeowner? Overbids are paid out first to the lien holders. The homeowner
is the last in line to receive anything, assuming money is left over. When you
negotiated with Capital Source to accept $24,000 in payment to assign its
mortgage note of $39,000 to you, you set yourself up to earn $15,000 in the
event that anyone bid more than $123,000 on the first mortgage.
So, what happens to Jackson Heating & Cooling’s lien? It’s wiped off the
books, because that lien is paid only if the overbid exceeds the amounts
needed to pay off the first and second lien holders.
Buying and Selling Junior Liens
One of the most common and costly mistakes that novice investors make at
auctions is to buy a junior lien thinking they’re buying a property. Because
junior liens are often wiped out by foreclosure, these uninformed investors
often purchase a worthless piece of paper. If you know what you’re doing,
however, you can purchase seconds (junior liens) to gain control of a prop-
erty or even earn a profit without taking possession of the property.
Don’t buy a junior lien without buying the senior lien and paying any overdue
property taxes, as well. If someone else buys a lien that’s higher up in the
pecking order, you stand to lose your entire investment if you don’t buy them
out prior to the end of the redemption period. If your area has no redemption
period or the redemption period expires before you redeem the senior lien
249
Chapter 15: Sampling Some Other Foreclosure Strategies

holder, you lose all of your money. I strongly urge novice investors not to buy
junior liens until they’ve gained some experience buying senior liens.
Buying junior liens to foreclose 
for a quick payday
Some investors like to roll the dice and gamble on buying seconds (junior
liens) at a discount in the hopes that the homeowners will redeem the liens
to avoid losing their homes. This strategy offers several benefits: 
 Nobody else wants them.
 They’re affordable — typically $2,000–$15,000 instead of $100,000+.
 Most of the time, the homeowners redeem the junior lien, which means
you earn the difference between what you paid for the lien and the fore-
closed upon amount — usually the face value of the lien plus interest.
Because the interest rate on junior liens is typically higher than the
interest rate on first mortgages, even if you earn only the interest, 
you’re usually getting a better return on your money than if you had
invested it elsewhere.
 If the homeowners don’t redeem, the equity in the property may be suffi-
cient to buy the first mortgage and recoup your investment plus a profit.
This is definitely something you want to know before you buy.
 You gain a controlling position in the property.
Buying junior liens, however, has several drawbacks, as well, including these:
 If most homeowners redeem, you rarely gain possession of the property.
 If someone else buys a senior lien, you stand to lose your entire 
investment.
To take advantage of this strategy, search for junior liens that are in default
already or that will soon be in default. If the homeowners continue to make pay-
ments on the loan, you can’t foreclose. As you can see, this is a bit of a gamble.
Never buy a second if you’re not prepared to pay off the first mortgage or
walk away from the deal chalking up your investment as a loss. 
Personally, I’m not fond of this strategy. For me, having controlling interest in
the property is my prime motivation for buying a second. By purchasing the
second, I force the senior lien holder to deal with me, and I can always pay
them off and take them out, giving me the pole position. You have to know
what you’re doing, though, or you can really get burned if someone swoops
in and buys that first position.
250
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

Buying seconds to protect 
the first mortgage
If you buy a first mortgage and the property has enough equity in it even
after accounting for the second mortgage, another investor can swoop in,
buy the second, pay you off, and walk away with the property. You don’t lose
the money you paid for the first mortgage, but you do lose the property and
the opportunity to earn a bigger profit. When you buy a first mortgage on a
property that has sufficient equity to tempt another investor to buy the
second, you can employ any of the following strategies to protect your
investment:
 Pay off the second mortgage. If the second mortgage is low enough,
you may want to simply pay it off. I’m not saying you should always pay
off the second mortgage, but if you crunch the numbers and can still
earn a tidy profit, this is an option.
 Buy the second mortgage at a discount. You may be able to buy the
second mortgage at a discount from the lien holder or, if the lien holder
forecloses on the property, you may be able to buy it at auction to pro-
tect your position. If the lien holder is unwilling to sell short, let him
know that you own the senior position and that if the homeowners don’t
redeem, he stands to lose everything.
251
Chapter 15: Sampling Some Other Foreclosure Strategies
Witnessing a train wreck
At one auction I attended, I noticed a new buyer
who seemed very interested in a property that I
knew was a second mortgage. Out of my love
for my fellow man I asked him if he knew what
he was buying. From his response I could tell
that he was a newbie. I told him that he was
going to bid on a second and asked if he knew
what that meant. I wasn’t able to convince him
that he was making a mistake, but it was his
money. I made one last attempt, I told him, “Tell
you what, you give me half of what you’re going
to bid today, I’ll punch you as hard as I can in
the gut, and in six months you’ll look back and
thank me. Or you can buy that second, and in six
months and tens-of-thousands of dollars poorer,
you can wish you would have listened to me.” It
didn’t work. I think he thought I was competing
for the property and trying to convince him to
bow out. 
I ran into the same guy about a year and a half
later and asked him how his investment turned
out. “Not well,” he said. 
“How much?” I asked.
“Around $18,000 and eight months of
headaches,” he replied, “I should have taken
that punch in the gut. In fact, I’d take a kick a
little lower if I could get that money back.” I just
laughed, but this is no laughing matter. Know
what you’re buying and avoid buying yourself in
over your head.

 Convince the owner of the second mortgage not to sell to another
investor. Contact the second lien holder and let her know that you pur-
chased the first and that if nobody redeems your mortgage and the
second lien holder agrees not to sell or assign its position, you will pay
her some fixed amount (as determined in your budget). If she agrees,
have your attorney draw up an agreement. This prevents another
investor from buying the second and then redeeming the first mortgage.
This strategy offers two benefits: You don’t have to come up with the
money upfront to buy the second mortgage, and the second lien holder
doesn’t have to give up her position — if the homeowners redeem your
first, the second lien holder retains its position and can now foreclose
for full value rather than selling short to you.
 Overbid enough at the sale to satisfy the second mortgage. You can
essentially pay off the second mortgage by bidding enough to satisfy
that debt or provide enough money to the second lien holder, so
redeeming you or selling their position to another investor would not be
worth the time and hassle.
Selling a junior lien for a profit
If the thought of taking possession of the property doesn’t appeal to you, you
can deal exclusively in paper by buying and selling junior liens. For example,
you may be able to negotiate a short sale with a junior lien holder, convincing
the lender to accept something like a $10,000 payment on a $25,000 lien. You
can then turn around and sell the junior lien to another investor for $15,000,
earning a $5,000 profit without ever touching the property.
Before venturing into the uncharted waters of buying and selling mortgages,
consult with your real estate attorney to make sure you’re set up to do it
legally. Certain areas may have restrictions on the number of mortgages a pri-
vate individual can hold at one time.
Profiting from Property Tax Sales
When homeowners fail to pay property taxes, the taxing authority places a
powerful lien against the property that almost always supersedes all other
liens. While other liens can get wiped out by foreclosure, the property tax
lien cannot. 
Unfortunately for you, as an investor, a tax lien may never end up on the auc-
tion block. Another lien holder is highly unlikely to see its position wiped out
252
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

because of a few measly dollars in unpaid taxes. If the lender with the first
mortgage has a major stake in the property, the lender is usually going to pay
the back taxes and then file an affidavit to add the taxes to the first mortgage
payoff amount — the amount the homeowners would have to pay to redeem
the property.
To profit from tax sales, research the property carefully prior to the auction,
as discussed in Chapter 8. Then, do some additional homework, as explained
in the following sections to track down tax sales, find out the way tax sales
are handled in your state or county, and locate tax sale opportunities.
Although purchasing tax liens is a relatively low-risk approach to acquiring
foreclosure properties and profiting from foreclosures in other ways, you can
still get burned when purchasing tax liens, especially if you don’t know the
rules, regulations, and deadlines that apply to tax sales in your area. The fol-
lowing section shows you how to find out much of the information you need,
but you should also consult an attorney and have a clear understanding of
the process before buying tax liens. 
Tracking down property tax sales
Delinquent property taxes are almost always processed at the county level, so
your county offices are the most logical places to find information about tax
sales. If your county has a website, it should supply most of the information you
need, so the clerks don’t have to spend most of their days answering questions.
If no Web site is available, you can try contacting the tax assessor or commis-
sioner, the delinquent-tax department, the treasurer, or the sheriff, but these
offices generally shy away from providing details, because they don’t want to
be accused of “giving legal advice.” Your best bet is usually to consult your
real estate attorney.
When you finally locate a quality information resource, gather information to
answer the following questions:
 Where and when are the tax sales?
 Do you sell tax deeds or tax lien certificates? (See the following section
for more about the difference between tax deeds and certificates.)
 Does the tax lien hold priority over all other liens? If not, which liens can
supersede it?
 If I buy a tax lien, do I need to do anything to protect my position on the
title? Do I have to record my interest? Do I have to buy future tax lien
certificates as they go to sale?
253
Chapter 15: Sampling Some Other Foreclosure Strategies

 How long is the redemption period on tax sales?
 Can I do anything to shorten the redemption period, such as have the
homeowners sign a non-redemption certificate?
 What do I need to do to take possession of the property after the
redemption period expires? 
 If I have to evict the homeowners, how much does eviction cost?
 What percentage of homeowners redeem?
 If the homeowners redeem, do they have to pay interest and penalties? If
they do, what’s the percentage and fees and how much of that do I
receive upon redemption?
 How can I obtain a list of properties scheduled for the tax sale?
 What are the purchasing terms on tax liens at time of sale? 
 Do I have to register as a bidder in order to bid?
 Does the county offer financing to purchase tax liens?
 How does the bidding work? Is it a sealed bid or open auction?
 Are any other costs added to the back taxes? If so, are those costs added
to the total before bidding begins or after it’s completed?
 What happens to properties that don’t sell at auction? Can I buy them
directly from the county? If so, how do I go about placing an offer? Can I
get a list of the properties?
Pick your real estate attorney’s brain for additional information and advice
concerning tax sales in your area. Because your attorney’s job is to protect
your interests, your attorney can highlight the pitfalls and perhaps offer tips
to succeed that are specific to the tax sales in your area.
Finding golden tax sale opportunities
When most people buy a house, the lender requires the creation of an escrow
account out of which property taxes and insurance are to be paid, because
the lender knows that homeowners often forget to set aside enough money to
pay their property taxes or they simply forget to send in their payments. 
When homeowners fall behind on their property taxes, unpaid taxes along
with the penalties and interest quickly add up, particularly if the homeown-
ers are behind on their mortgage and other bills. In some cases, the home-
owners may not even be receiving the notices that their property taxes are
254
Part IV: Finding and Buying Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Properties 

due. Perhaps the owner died and the family is unaware that taxes are due, or
the homeowners live out of state. In these situations, the tax lien may be the
only lien on the property. As an investor, this can be a perfect opportunity for
acquiring the tax lien and buying a property for much less than market value.
Pay particular attention to tax liens on properties that have no other liens
against them, abandoned properties, properties with out-of-state owners, and
properties that the owners use as their vacation home. In the case of a prop-
erty used as a vacation home, the homeowners facing foreclosure may be
using all of their resources to save their primary residence, so they drop the
ball on the vacation home.
Buying tax deeds or certificates?
One of the most important differences in how tax sales are handled from
state to state is whether the state sells tax deeds or tax certificates:
 A tax deed is a document conveying ownership of the property to the
high bidder. Prior to the tax deed sale, the county informs the homeown-
ers and all lien holders that the property is going to be sold if nobody
pays the past taxes. In most cases, a lien holder who has a large claim on
the property pays the back taxes. If nobody pony’s up the money to pay
the taxes, the county auctions off the tax deed.
 A tax certificate or tax lien is simply a document giving the purchaser the
right to collect the unpaid taxes. When you buy a tax certificate, you’re
essentially paying the taxing authority to take over its interest in the
property. This gives you first lien position on the title. You can then fore-
close on the property or place yourself in a better position with the
homeowner and other interested parties to acquire the property.
Getting redeemed out of your position
When you buy a tax deed or lien, you may begin to feel as though you won
the lottery. You now control the property and can cut all junior lien holders
out of the deal. You’re on easy street, right? Not quite.
In a large percentage of cases, the homeowners redeem the tax deed. This
isn’t all that bad. Worst case scenario, you get your money back. In some
areas, the homeowners may also have to pay penalties and interest, some of
which you may be entitled to. In other words, you stand to profit even if you
lose your interest in the property.
255
Chapter 15: Sampling Some Other Foreclosure Strategies

To encourage investors to purchase them, tax liens typically carry a very
high interest rate or are auctioned off for only a fraction of what’s owed in
back taxes, so investors can earn a worthwhile profit. If the homeowners or
other lien holders don’t redeem the tax lien, it may convert to a tax deed,
allowing the holder to take action to gain possession of the property. Tax
deeds may have no redemption period or a period that’s shorter than that of
tax liens.
Profiting from the tax lien or deed
Once you own a tax deed or lien, how do you profit from it? Following are var-
ious strategies for profiting from a tax lien or deed:
 Take possession of the property after the redemption period expires,
and repair, renovate, and sell the property.
 Sell the tax lien or deed to another investor or one of the other lien hold-
ers for a profit.
 Sell the tax lien or deed to the homeowners for a profit.

You may make your money when you buy a foreclo-

your investment until you sell the property, lease it, or
refinance to pull some or all of the equity out of the 
property.
The chapters in this part focus on the property after the

previous homeowners out the door or evicting them when
they refuse to leave. I show you how to maximize your

 Attending to details after the purchase
 Securing your property through the redemption period
 Laying the groundwork for repairs and renovations
 Ushering the previous homeowners out the door
A
fter working so hard to find a foreclosure property and negotiate with
homeowners and lenders or submit the winning auction bid, you may
think that you’re home free. You are now the proud owner of a valuable
investment property that you can repair, renovate, and either rent out or 
sell for a profit.
Whoa! Slow down. After purchasing a property, you now have to tie up any
loose ends to secure your purchase: 
 If the homeowners accepted the price and terms of your purchase agree-
ment, you have to close on the home. See Chapter 19 for additional
details on the closing process.
 If you purchased the property at auction, you must satisfy the terms of
the purchase, pay any back taxes, and file some additional paperwork.
See “Tying up the loose ends after the auction,” later in this chapter.
 If your state has a redemption period, you must fulfill your responsibili-
ties until the redemption period expires, as discussed later in this chap-
ter in the section “Protecting Your Investment through Redemption.”
 If the property is vacant, you have to make sure it’s safe, secure, and
insured. See “Securing the property,” later in this chapter.
Assuming you do all that, you then face the often-painful task of evicting the
residents.

Now’s the time to work on your end game — to implement your exit strategy.
Although you shouldn’t start rehabbing the property until the redemption
period expires, you can’t just sit around twiddling your thumbs until the
redemption period expires and the homeowners move out. You have work to
do. This chapter covers the all-important follow-through that secures your
ownership of the property and provides a smoother transition from the previ-
ous owners to you.
Tying Up the Loose Ends 
after the Purchase 
You probably spent a great deal of time and effort finding a property, research-
ing it, and bidding on it or negotiating with the homeowners. You already have
a considerable amount of money tied up in the property, as well, so you don’t
want to lose the property on some technicality or by overlooking a “minor”
detail.
In the following sections, I show you what to do after you purchase a prop-
erty to ensure that you’ve covered all your bases.
Closing on a pre-auction purchase
If you and the homeowners have a signed purchase agreement, the next step
is to close on the property. At closing, you pay the homeowners, and they
sign the title over to you. To make sure you don’t get burned on closing day,
make sure you’re prepared:
 Review the closing papers. The title company should be able to provide
you with a copy of the closing packet a few days prior to closing.
 Call the utility companies. To avoid getting socked with a high, unpaid
utility bill, call the utility companies and ask for any account balances
on service provided for the home. Let the utility companies know the
date on which you plan to take possession of the house, so you don’t
have to pay for utilities you didn’t use, such as electricity and gas. The
water bill usually stays with the house or is tacked on to the property
tax bill. Make sure you have the seller pay the water bill at or just prior
to closing, so you don’t get stuck with a huge bill.
 Inspect the property. The day before closing or even the same day,
drive by the property to make sure the residents haven’t trashed the
place. If possible, knock on the door and try to get a peek inside. If you
260
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 

can’t get a peek inside, you may want to think twice about closing. You
should have a relationship with the homeowners by now. 
 Verify title insurance. Ask the title company for a letter verifying that
the title is insured. Title insurance protects you from any unforeseen
claims against the property.
 Obtain homeowner’s insurance. Call your insurance agent and obtain an
insurance policy for the property. If you’re financing the purchase through
a mortgage company, the company will want an insurance policy up front
before closing. Purchase a one-year policy and bring a receipt to closing.
To trim the cost of insurance, consider increasing the deductible or insuring
it only for the amount you have invested in it rather than for its replacement
value. If you purchased a property for $150,000 and the house is worth $200,000,
for example, you may consider taking out a $150,000 policy. If you’re paying
cash for the house or buying it with a commercial line of credit, this is one way
to cut costs, but if you’re financing through a mortgage company, you may be
required to insure the property for the full replacement value of the property.
At closing, you simply sign the necessary papers as the closing agent or
attorney sets them in front of you. Inspect the paperwork to make sure noth-
ing has changed since the time you reviewed it. As soon as you’ve wrapped
up all the paperwork, attend to these details:
 Obtain keys for the property.
 Call the utility companies to have the services transferred to your name.
A few days after closing, make sure the deed transferring ownership to your
name has been recorded. If you’re dealing with a title company, have it send
or fax you a copy of the recorded deed. This copy will be date and time
stamped and will bear the recoding information — the liber (book) and page
number on which the deed was recorded, along with other information. If
you’re recording the deed yourself, ask the clerk for a copy that reflects the
recording information. The office may take several weeks to officially record
the deed, but the working copy is acceptable in the meantime. You may also
be able to obtain a copy of the recorded document online.
Tying up the loose ends after the auction
After you purchase a property at auction, you escape the closing, but you
may need to attend to other details, including fulfilling the conditions of the
sale, obtaining title insurance, filing the deed, and insuring the property.
Chapter 11 provides a complete checklist of everything you need to take care
of after submitting the winning bid.

Protecting Your Investment 
through Redemption
In areas that have a mandatory redemption period, when you buy a property
at auction, you become only “sort of the owner.” Your name is on the sheriff’s
deed, but, depending on the rules and regulations that govern foreclosure
in your area, the homeowners may have the right to redeem the property
by paying back taxes and penalties and paying off all of their loans in full,
complete with interest and penalties. The homeowners aren’t likely to redeem
the property, but if their rich Aunt Millie lends a hand, it could happen.
Your job as “sort of the owner” consists primarily of waiting for the redemption
period to expire. During this temporary lull, however, you must continue to
attend to your responsibilities as prospective owner. The following sections
show you how to fulfill your obligations and guard your investment.
The homeowners are not the only parties who can choose to redeem the
property. Other lien holders can choose to redeem, and other investors may
be able to work with the homeowner or buy out other lien holders and
redeem your position. If you hold the senior lien, you can even sell your posi-
tion to a junior lien holder, as explained in Chapter 19. Remain vigilant, and
expect the unexpected.
Maintaining the property’s status quo
Although the homeowners retain the right to reside in the property until the
redemption period expires, insuring the property and paying the property
taxes to protect your investment are pretty good ideas, even though they’re
not technically required. Here’s what you should do: 
 Pay the property taxes. The county treasurer sends you the tax bills.
Simply pay them by the due date printed on the bill.
 Take out an insurance policy on the home. Without insurance, your
entire investment is at risk of going up in flames, blowing away in a tor-
nado or hurricane, or washing downstream in a flood. Make sure you’re
insurance agent knows that you purchased the property as an invest-
ment and will not be living in it. 
Finding an insurance agent who’s willing to insure a foreclosure property
is quite a challenge, but they’re out there. The problems are that the
insurance agent usually can’t get inside to take photos, and you won’t be
living in the house. My insurance agent takes plenty of photos of the out-
side of the house and bases her quote on those photos and other
262
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 

details. You can expect a higher bill (perhaps even double the cost of
owner-occupied homeowner’s insurance), because the risk for the insur-
ance company is higher. Just make sure you file an affidavit showing
how much you paid, so you may be able to recover the expense if some-
one redeems the property.
 File an affidavit for all expenses. If your area has a redemption period,
file an affidavit showing all expenses you paid for back taxes and home-
owner’s insurance. Your attorney can help you draft the affidavit and file
it for you. If the homeowners or another lien holder redeems the prop-
erty, you may be able to get this money back, but only if you file the
proper paperwork when you pay the bills. (The rights to seek reimburse-
ment for costs vary from state to state, so consult your real estate attor-
ney for clarification.) File your affidavit the same day you pay the taxes,
or the premiums; otherwise, you may be redeemed in the gap and lose
you money.
Securing the property
If people are still living in the property, you have to rely on them for the most
part to secure the property from theft and vandalism and prevent someone
from getting accidentally injured. As owner, however, keep an eye on the
property and attend to the following:
 Lock the doors if the property is vacant. Make sure the property is
secure to prevent theft and vandalism and discourage neighborhood
kids from entering the house or garage and possibly suffering some
injury. 
Consider giving your neighbors your card and asking them to keep an
eye on the house for you. Ask them to call you if they notice anything
out of the ordinary. If the house is vacant, you may want to hire one of
the neighbor’s kids to mow the lawn each week and pick up any newspa-
pers or advertising handouts that end up on the front porch. Try to
make the house look as occupied as possible.
 Attend to any safety or health issues. If the property has been cited for
unsafe wiring, hire an electrician to inspect and correct the problem.
Repair any broken windows or board them up. Invest a minimal amount
of money to make the property safe. These are expenses you’re highly
unlikely to be reimbursed for in the event that someone redeems the
property.
 Perform any repairs that may lead to additional damage. Spend only
enough on repairs to prevent further damage. If the roof leaks, for exam-
ple, instead of replacing the roof, have the leaks fixed to prevent further
water damage. 
263
Chapter 16: Assisting the Previous Homeowners Out the Door

Don’t invest a great deal of money or time in expensive repairs. If someone
redeems your lien, any money you spend now becomes a house-warming pre-
sent to the new owners. 
Keeping hungry investors at bay
A major threat to your investment property during the redemption period 
are other investors who may try to convince the homeowners that you’re 
ripping them off. Another investor can step in, assist the homeowners with
redeeming the property, and then buy it from them, cutting you out of the
deal. Whatever you paid for the house at auction along with property taxes
and insurance premiums you paid and filed an affidavit as having paid plus
interest, are refunded to you upon redemption, but you lose the house.
You can’t prevent the homeowners or someone else from redeeming the
property, and you certainly can’t prevent another investor from swooping in
and bumping you out of a deal, but you can make it less likely. In the follow-
ing sections, I provide tips for encouraging the homeowners to work with you
toward a mutually beneficial conclusion.
Contacting the homeowners after the sale
As soon as possible after the auction, call the homeowners and let them
know that you purchased their property. Tell them that other investors are
likely to come knocking on their door or calling them to say that “so-and-so
just bought your house and is going to kick you out.” Explain that some of
these other “investors” may try to convince (or con) them to do something
that’s not in their best interest, and that if they have any questions or con-
cerns, they can call you. 
Follow up with a letter that has all your contact information. I like to send one
letter in the standard mail and one as a certified letter. Let the homeowners
know that you’re an investor, not a house stealer, and that you are willing to
work with them if possible. For best results, send a letter immediately after
the sale and then every six weeks or so until the redemption period has expired.
Offering cash for keys . . . and a nonredemption certificate
One of the best ways to keep other investors at bay is to visit the homeown-
ers and offer them cash for keys and a signed nonredemption certificate. A
nonredemption certificate is not a deed. You don’t get the official deed until
the redemption period expires, but it provides you with some additional
assurance that you’ll eventually get the property. 
Consider giving only a small portion of the cash up front with the balance
due after redemption and transfer of possession, so you’re not out too much
if something goes wrong and the homeowners have an incentive to honor the
agreement.
264
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 

Don’t offer cash for keys and a signed nonredemption certificate if other lien
holders have a claim to the property during redemption. You may end up
handing the homeowners a thousand bucks only to have another lien holder
redeem you the following day. Anything you give the homeowner is at risk, so
don’t offer a whole lot.
Prior to contacting the homeowners and offering cash for keys and a nonre-
demption certificate, consult your attorney. In some areas, having the home-
owners sign a nonredemption certificate relinquishing their rights may be
considered unethical. Be very cautious when working with the homeowner
during the redemption period. You don’t want to be accused later of taking
advantage of the homeowners while they were under duress. My rule of
thumb is to have no contact with the homeowner during the final month of
the redemption period.
265
Chapter 16: Assisting the Previous Homeowners Out the Door
Acting with integrity
Some foreclosure investors pay no attention 
to the homeowners’ redemption rights. We had
an investor in Oakland County, Michigan who
was infamous for walking all over distressed
homeowners. He’d buy a property at the sher-
iff’s sale and immediately call the homeowners
or knock on their door to tell them that he had
purchased the property and they needed to
vacate the premises immediately. He knew full
well that the homeowners had six months to
redeem, and he flat-out lied to them. More often
than not, it worked — the homeowners imme-
diately packed up and moved out.
I often use the dishonesty of other investors as
a tool to bump them out of their deals. Knowing
that a dishonest investor purchased a property
at auction, I show up at the homeowners’ door
and say something like, “I noticed that so-and-
so purchased your property at the sheriff’s auc-
tion the other day. Did he inform you that you
have six months to redeem the property before
you have to move?” Of course, they say, “No,”
and then I can present them with a better offer.
I also do this when I see a property with an
overbid — a bid amount in excess of what’s
owed on the property. The overbid money right-
fully belongs to the homeowners. I’ll say some-
thing like, “I noticed that so-and-so purchased
your property at the sheriff’s sale the other day.
Did he tell you that the property drew an overbid
and you’re entitled to some of the money from
the sale?” This provides me with another oppor-
tunity to work out a deal with the homeowners. 
Some con artists make a living off of overbids.
They attend auctions, note the properties that
draw overbids, and then contact the homeown-
ers and charge them 50 percent of the overbid
to “help” them recover the money. All they’re
doing is stealing 50 percent of the money that
rightfully belongs to the homeowners.
You may choose not to bump other investors
from deals, but whatever you do, don’t try to con
the homeowners out of what is rightfully theirs.
Let them know about any redemption rights they
have or overbid money that’s theirs. Give the
homeowners a hand, and you quickly find that
the homeowners become much more coopera-
tive and later willing to recommend you to
others.

Once you have a nonredemption certificate in hand, avoid problems by main-
taining a positive relationship with the occupants. You can enforce the nonre-
demption certificate in court, but more importantly it gives you some leverage
if the homeowner has second thoughts or another investor approaches them
claiming to offer a “better deal.” Simply reminding the homeowners that you
paid them money (consideration) for the agreement is usually sufficient to rein
them in. 
If the house is really a good deal, and you want to enforce the contract, you
can try, but judges often rule on emotion rather than law and side with the
homeowners. You’ll have to hire an attorney, file an appeal, and pay attorney
fees and court costs. If you think it’s worth the expense and hassle, go for it.
If not, you may want to walk away.
I’ve only run into problems with homeowners changing their minds a couple
of times. In one situation, another investor offered to give the homeowners
$5,000 instead of the $2,000 I offered if they would sell to him and not honor
my non-redemption certificate. I ended up giving them $4,000 and explaining
that that guy was a bum and probably would have taken the deed and scammed
them out of their house without any money. I explained that I had already
invested thousands of dollars by purchasing the property at auction, and 
this guy was only a cheap imitation without any real ability to deliver on his
promises. After all, if he could, he would have bid against me at the auction.
The extra $2,000 was still less than what I would have spent on attorney fees
had I taken the homeowners to court.
Be very cautious when working with the homeowner during the redemption
period, especially in the last 30 days. You don’t want to be accused later of
taking advantage of the home owner while they were under duress. My rule of
thumb is to have no contact with the homeowner during the final month of
the redemption period.
Planning Repairs and Renovations
During the redemption period, you own a non-performing investment — an
investment property that’s not earning you any money. You realize your profit
only upon selling the property or leasing it out. To expedite repairs and reno-
vations and realize your profit sooner, start planning renovations and lining
up contractors now. In Chapter 17, I provide additional details on renovating
your property.
Never spend lots of money on a house you don’t yet own or that doesn’t have
a clear title. If you invest a lot of money in renovations and the homeowners
redeem the property, you can lose your entire investment. If the property
requires some repair or preventive maintenance, to prevent costlier repairs
later, then go ahead and make the repair, assuming the property is vacant or
the homeowners give you permission. 
266

Evicting the Residents 
when Time Runs Out
Eviction can be ugly, so my advice is to avoid it, if possible. Make the process
of moving out as easy as possible. Following are some suggestions for assist-
ing the homeowners move out:
 Give ’em time. In extenuating circumstances, such as the illness or death
of a close family member, consider offering to extend the eviction dead-
line. Show the homeowners the court documents with the date on which
they’re required to move out. Ask them if that’s acceptable. If it’s not,
work with them to agree on a date and sign a commitment that they are
going to move out on that date. Don’t let the homeowners take advantage
of your kindness — I’ve had homeowners claim that 17 of their grand-
mothers have died, just so they could hold on to the house a little longer.
 Give ’em money. Homeowners who have just experienced foreclosure
are usually strapped for cash. Consider offering them $1,000 payable on
the agreed upon moving date, on the condition that the property is in
good condition and “broom clean” on that date. Broom clean means no
junk left behind — it doesn’t mean shiny clean.
 Give ’em a dumpster. To enable the homeowners to de-junk the place,
consider offering them a free trash dumpster prior to moving day in
which they can toss their junk.
 Give ’em a moving truck. If the homeowners haven’t the means to
move, take away the excuse by hiring a moving truck for them. Specify
the time the movers are going to show up and have the homeowners
commit to being prepared to load their stuff. Call the homeowners a
couple days prior to moving day to remind them.
 Give ’em free storage. Contact a local mini-storage complex and arrange
to pre-pay a couple months of the storage fee. The homeowners can
then move their belongings into storage and pick them up later after
they’ve settled into their new residence.
Arguing at this point is counterproductive. The homeowner’s emotions are
probably running a little high at this point. Simply explain that you didn’t
create the problem and are willing to do anything reasonably possible to
assist them in moving on with their lives and leaving this problem in the past.
Playing nice guy doesn’t always work, in which case you need to proceed
with Plan B — a formal eviction. Fortunately, the court can assist you, to keep
the eviction legal and to distance you from what may be an ugly scene.
To initiate the eviction, head down to the county courthouse and file a tres-
passing action with the court. The court assigns you a court date, which in
my area is about two weeks from the date of filing. You meet the homeowners
267
Chapter 16: Assisting the Previous Homeowners Out the Door

in court, and unless they have a good legal reason for not moving out, the
judge gives them ten days or so to move out. If they need extra time, they can
say so at the hearing, and if the extension is reasonable, you can agree to it. 
If the homeowners request 30 days, agree and sign without debate. I usually
take the opportunity to offer an added incentive — “Move out by the agreed-
upon date, leave the property broom clean, and I’ll pay you an extra $1,000.”
Now you have something in writing. 
I recommend that you always hire an attorney who’s experienced with evic-
tions to handle these matters for you. When I first started out, I handled most
of this myself to save money and quickly learned that my approach was actu-
ally costing me more money. 
If the homeowners fail to move out by the agreed-upon date, you can then
call the sheriff and have the homeowners forcibly evicted. The bailiff shows
up with the sheriff; the homeowners and all of their stuff are moved out of
the house; and the sheriff locks the homeowners out of the house.
When the homeowners receive an eviction notice, they often become enraged.
They may beat the house up, steal the furnace, break windows, tear out the
kitchen cabinets, or completely gut the place stealing everything. Your home-
owner’s policy may cover the damage, but you still have the headache of
trying to put the pieces back together. Work with the homeowners as closely
as possible to keep their emotions in check.
Worried about homeowners trashing the house before eviction? Then talk to
your attorney about getting a TRO (temporary restraining order) or a prelimi-
nary injunction which bars the homeowners from “committing waste” on the
property. A TRO or injunction may make them think twice about punishing
you by vandalizing the property, because the TRO carries the weight of the
court’s “contempt powers.” You may not need to go through the trouble of
obtaining a TRO, but if the homeowners make an offhand comment about
trashing the joint or you suspect that they might take such action, look into it
as a way to protect your investment. Homeowners who threaten vandalism
are often homeowners you can’t work with, so call your attorney immediately
to see if a TRO or injunction is appropriate.

 Whipping kitchens and bathrooms into shape

A
cquiring a foreclosure property for a price significantly below market
value is like taking the perfect backswing in golf — it’s a necessary first
step to ensuring a profitable investment, but it’s not enough to land you on
the green. Once you acquire a property, work on your forward swing and
follow-through. You need to renovate the property without blowing your
budget and do it as quickly as possible, so you can sell the house before
holding costs bite a huge chunk out of your profit pie.
In this chapter, I reveal the overall strategy for repairing and renovating an
investment property to get the most bang for your buck. I warn you against
making the common mistake of over-improving the property and then pre-
sent renovation strategies and tips for everything from quick, cosmetic
makeovers to major reconstruction projects.
All home buyers want a nice, clean house in the price range they can afford
with as few mechanical problems (plumbing, gas, electric, and heating) as
possible. When buying and renovating houses, let these factors guide your
renovation decisions.
Choosing a Renovation Strategy
Having a plan of attack in place when you purchase a property can signifi-
cantly reduce your holding time (and costs) and provide the focus you need

270
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 
to score a quick profit. You basically have four strategies from which to
choose:
 Don’t renovate: Buy the property and then turn around and resell it to
another investor. Many investors are quite successful in finding bargain
properties and then reselling them for $15,000–$20,000 over all costs.
 White box: Take a good, ugly house, clean it inside and out, patch any
holes, and paint over any ugly stains with Kilz. Make sure the mechani-
cals (heating, electricity, plumbing, and air conditioning) are in good
working order and that the roof has several years of life left in it. Price
the house slightly below market value and pass the savings onto the
buyers, so they can decorate and perform cosmetic improvements to
suit their tastes.
By “paint over any ugly stains with Kilz,” I’m not suggesting that you try
to cover up major defects. If you notice a leak or have problems with
mold or mildew, deal with the cause and proceed with essential repairs.
Kilz and paint are simply to freshen up the appearance.
 Complete rehab: Clean the house inside and out as you do with white
boxing, but perform the cosmetic renovations, too, including applying a
fresh coat of paint, laying new carpet, and bringing the kitchen and bath
up to market standards. See “Giving Your Property a Quick Makeover,”
later in this chapter for details.
 Value-add renovations: Perform a complete rehab and then take it one
step further by adding a valuable feature to the house, such as an extra
bedroom or bath, a dormer, a deck, or maybe central air-conditioning.
See, “Adding Valuable Features,” later in this chapter for details.
Illegal house flipping has given flipping a bad name. Many lenders are now
closely scrutinizing any sales in which the seller has owned the property for
less than one or two years. Keep all your receipts and a detailed journal of
your renovations to prove that you improved a property sufficiently to justify
the sales price. 
Planning Repairs and Renovations
The key to making money on an investment property is to buy low and sell
high. What trips up many novice investors is the mistaken notion that “sell
high” means transforming a Quonset hut into the Taj Mahal. They take the
right first step, buying the property below market value, but then they over-
improve the property in an attempt to maximize their profit. They end up
owning a property that’s worth more than any reasonable buyer is willing to
pay for it.

When budgeting for repairs and renovations, your goal is to spend enough to
bring the property up to the market standard in your neighborhood. Nobody
is going to pay $150,000 for a house in an area where the next best house is
selling for $100,000.
In the following sections, I focus your attention on the essential no-brainer
repairs you must make, assist you in identifying the renovations that bring
the highest ROI (return on investment), and show you how to estimate your
ROI, so you don’t renovate your way out of a profit.
Calculating the return on your investment 
The producers of those house-flipping TV shows like to show the cost of a
renovation followed by the amount it boosted the property value and the
total return on the investment. On one show, a $5,000 landscape job suppos-
edly boosted the value of a property by $20,000! In the real world, the ROI is
rarely so cut-and-dried. I’m not about to tell you that a new $30,000 kitchen is
going to increase the value of a property by $50,000 or that a $15,000 bathroom
remodel is likely to net you a profit of $15,000. It just doesn’t work that way. 
The renovation isn’t adding value to the house — it simply brings the prop-
erty’s value in line with that of other properties in the neighborhood. In the
real world, you discount the purchase price by enough to cover the cost of
the renovation and provide you with a profit of at least 20 percent. If the
kitchen needs a $20,000 update to bring the house up to snuff, for example,
you subtract at least $24,000 from your maximum purchase price. If the bath-
room needs a $10,000 facelift, you subtract at least $12,000 from your offer. In
other words, you calculate the cost of renovations into your purchase price. 
Some renovations do add real value to a property. Converting an attic into a
third bedroom, for example, or adding a garage to a house that doesn’t have
one adds value to the property. It boosts the property into a higher price
bracket. Are value-added renovations worth the expense? The answer to that
question depends on your market. To determine whether a particular feature
is worth the expense, consider the following:
 Comparable properties: Check the value of comparable properties that
have the feature you plan to add. How much more are these properties
selling for? If you plan on adding a third bedroom, for example, check
the recent sales prices of three-bedroom homes against the value of the
average two-bedroom model. 
 Market demand: Visit open houses in your area to find out what buyers
are currently looking for. You want to make your house competitive with
271
Chapter 17: Repairing and Renovating Your Investment Property

comparable houses in the same neighborhood. Find out how much extra
buyers are willing to spend for a house with an additional feature your
house is missing.
 Cost: Obtain estimates on how much you can expect to pay to add the
feature to the property. Does the added feature boost the property value
enough to justify the expense?
Search for properties that have a missing feature and then add the missing
piece. Some investors specialize in adding a bedroom to two-bedroom houses
or adding a bathroom or half bath to houses that have only one bathroom.
Others may add central air-conditioning to houses that don’t have it.
Roughing out your budget and schedule
How much you profit from the sale of the house often hinges on the cost of
repairs and renovations. Overzealous flippers get burned when their visions
for improving a house exceed their ability to pay for them. Whether you have
$10,000 or $50,000 budgeted for repairs and renovations, decide early on how
much of that money to set aside for each project. To establish a budget,
follow these steps:
1. List the projects you plan on hiring a professional to complete.
2. Obtain estimates for these jobs. Estimates should break out the cost of
materials and labor.
3. Jot down the projects you plan on doing yourself.
4. For each of these projects, list the required materials. If you’re remod-
eling a bathroom, for example, you may need a new toilet, sink, cabinet,
tile (for the walls), flooring, paint, and caulk. Visit your local hardware
store to research the cost of materials.
Many hardware stores display two prices for materials — an uninstalled
and an installed price. Use these comparisons to determine how much
you would save by doing the work yourself.
5. Tally all the estimated costs and add 20 percent to cover sales tax and
unexpected expenses. The cost of most projects exceeds estimates.
Use the renovation planner shown in Figure 17-1 to estimate costs and keep
all your notes in one place. The planner features space for listing each pro-
ject, its start and completion dates, and costs for materials and labor.
The tentative budget provides you with a clear idea of whether the total
costs of your planned projects are on track. If you do your homework before
purchasing the property, your costs should be right on target to ensure a
profit when you sell. If costs are running over budget, consider scaling back
on nonessential projects.

Don’t let some sweet-talking contractor charm you into taking on a project in
which you’re destined to overspend. When budgeting, make sure that you’re
the one making the decisions on how to spend your money.
For additional tips on renovating a property and preparing it for sale, check
out www.HurryHome.com.
Giving Your Property a Quick Makeover
You bought a good, solid home in a decent neighborhood for well below market
value. The house needs no major renovations, but the previous owners failed
to update and properly maintain the property. You now are the proud owner of
an ugly house — the perfect candidate for a quick and affordable makeover.
For a few thousand dollars over the course of a few days or weeks, you can
polish that diamond in the rough into a jewel that’s well worth full market
value. In the following sections, I step you through the process of renovating
a decent property on the cheap.
Your goal with most renovations is to fix anything that distracts from the rest
of the house. You don’t want prospective buyers to walk out because some-
thing doesn’t look right or smell right. You don’t want them offering you
$20,000 less than your asking price because the house needs a $10,000 repair
job. If you can’t picture your spouse happily living in the house, it probably
needs something.
Freshen the exterior
Curb appeal is the number-one area of focus for home buyers. If the property
is ugly on the outside, prospective buyers will never step through the front
door to peek inside. To quickly freshen the exterior of the property, here’s
what you do:
 Trim tree limbs and shrubs.
 Mow and edge the lawn. 
 Replace dead or dying shrubs and plant flowers, in season, of course,
and especially near the front.
 Apply a fresh layer of mulch.
 Remove clutter and eyesores. 
 Fill driveway and walkway cracks. 
274
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 

 Power-wash the siding, tuck-point a brick home (add fresh mortar
between the bricks), or paint a wood-sided home.
 Remove any window air conditioning units.
 Repair or replace windows and screens. 
 Add or replace shutters. 
 Paint the front door and trim. 
 Paint the garage door, the front door and shutters all the same color to
match the house. 
 Replace the gutters. Seamless gutters are best.
 Replace the front and rear storm doors. 
 Replace exterior light fixtures. 
 Replace the mailbox with something classy that matches the exterior
style of the house.
Gussy up the interior
Foreclosure properties are usually neglected, particularly inside, where the
neighbors can’t see. Every room in the house is likely to require a little
tender loving care, which you can provide by doing the following:
 Give the place a good scrubbing.
 Wash the windows.
 Install new window blinds.
 Clean or replace any drapes or curtains.
 Remove hooks or nails from all walls and patch the holes.
 Apply a fresh coat of paint to all rooms using flat, neutral colors and
semi-gloss white for the trim.
 Check and repair all doors and doorknobs. Doors should open and close
effortlessly.
 Install new light switch and outlet cover plates.
 Install new smoke detectors.
 Re-carpet, refinish, or replace damaged or worn flooring.
 Swap out the register covers.
 Replace exhaust fan covers and maybe the fans.
275
Chapter 17: Repairing and Renovating Your Investment Property

Tidy up the kitchen
You don’t have to gut the kitchen to make it look shiny and new. The follow-
ing affordable solutions often do the trick:
 Install a new stainless steel sink.
 Install a new faucet. 
 If the countertop looks old or crusty, have it replaced. 
 Refinish the cabinets, if needed, and add new hardware — knobs and
handles.
 Apply new contact paper to all cabinet shelves and drawers.
Scour the bathrooms
Bathrooms in foreclosure properties often look like the inside of a neglected
fish tank. If a thorough scrubbing won’t do the trick, consider the following
affordable renovations:
 Install a new vanity.
 Install all new fixtures.
 Replace the toilet seat. 
 Replace old towel hangers.
 Replace shower curtains or install glass shower doors.
 Apply a fresh bead of calk around the edges and base of the tub or
shower, around the sink, and around the base of the toilet.
 Scrub the grout between any tile work thoroughly.
Some companies, often referred to as grout doctors, specialize in cleaning
out the mold and mildew between tile or even re-grouting it or re-glazing it
and making it look shiny new without having to replace the tile. The invest-
ment is well worth the money, and it rarely costs as much as most people
assume. If the bathtub looks bad, consider having it re-glazed, as well.
Spiff up the bedrooms
Assuming you already painted and re-carpeted the entire house, you’ve
pretty much done all you need to do to the bedrooms:
 Paint.
 Re-carpet.
276
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 

 Replace light fixtures, cover plates, and heat register covers.
 Install closet organizers, if needed.
Make the basement tolerable
Converting the basement into an extra living room, bedroom, rec room, or
personal gym, is rarely a smart investment. Focus your efforts on making the
basement a clean storage or utility area:
 Sweep the cobwebs out of the rafters.
 Dust any ductwork, pipes, or wiring (be careful around the wiring).
 Tack up any dangling cables without shocking yourself. 
 Seal all cracks in the walls.
 Whitewash concrete or cement-block walls with a sealing paint. (If the
basement smells musty, scrub with a bleach solution before painting.
You can also run a dehumidifier in the basement, but run the overflow
hose to a floor drain, so you don’t create the appearance of standing
water in the basement.)
 Paint the concrete floor using gray enamel paint or tile the floor. 
 Install new glass block windows. 
 Buy a roll of insulation and stuff pieces of it between the joists where the
joists meet the outside wall. Painting the joists a darker color often adds
a nice, clean touch.
Unless a basement has its own entryway to the great outdoors, you can’t 
consider it official “living space.” Novice investors often try converting base-
ments into living space, but when you list the house, it’s officially a basement
and does not figure into the square footage calculations.
Attend to the mechanicals
Everything in the house should function properly and look its best, including
the water heater, furnace, air-conditioning unit, and plumbing:
 Change the furnace filters. 
 Clean or replace the hot water tank. 
 Repair any leaky faucets.
 Unclog any plugged or slow drains.

Investing in High-Profile Rooms:
Kitchens and Baths
Kitchens and bathrooms sell houses, so don’t overlook or underestimate the
need to transform these high-profile living spaces into attractive and highly
functional rooms. In the following sections, I suggest some kitchen and bath-
room renovations that range from affordable updates to pricey upgrades.
Cooking up a remodeled kitchen
Starting at about $15,000, you can completely gut an average kitchen and install
new mid-level cabinets, countertop, sink, and dishwasher. For a few thousand
more, you can kick in a new range, stovetop, microwave oven, and refrigera-
tor. You don’t have to spend that kind of money updating the kitchen, and you
can spend a lot more than that. In the following sections, I take you on a tour
of kitchen upgrades starting with cost-cutter rehabs and moving up the ladder.
Giving the kitchen an affordable facelift
You can give the kitchen a whole new look with a few very affordable updates:
 Refinish the cabinets. Paint the cabinets white, strip and re-stain, or re-
face the cabinets. Re-facing consists of removing the doors and the
fronts of the drawers and then applying a wood or plastic laminate to all
exterior surfaces. This re-facing is much more expensive than a standard
paint job, but it costs about a third less than installing new cabinets, and
it usually looks just as good. 
 Replace the cabinet doors. If the cabinets are solid, refinishing the cabi-
nets and replacing only the doors is always an option.
 Replace the drawer knobs and cabinet handles. For a few bucks per
drawer or door, you give the cabinets a whole new look.
 Polish or replace the countertop. For a few hundred dollars, you can
hire someone to polish a solid countertop, such as marble, granite, or a
composite material to buff out the dings and scratches. If the counter is
laminate, replace it.
 Install a new sink and faucet. For a couple hundred bucks, a new sink
and faucet make the entire kitchen look cleaner and more modern. 
 Lay new flooring. In most older kitchens, the floor looks bad no matter
how clean it is. To make it look brand new, install new flooring —
ceramic (high-end) or vinyl or linoleum (lower- to mid-range markets).

Dummies by Donald R. Prestly (Wiley).

Gutting the kitchen
Some kitchens are hopeless. The cabinets are shot, the countertop is age
weary, the sink is beyond salvation, or the kitchen is simply too dinky to
comfortably accommodate the average family. When a kitchen sinks to this
level, consider gutting it and starting over.
I don’t recommend that you redesign a kitchen on your own. Head down to
the local cabinet or building supply store and consult with a professional
kitchen designer. If you’re planning on knocking out a wall or two to expand
the kitchen, you should also consult with a builder or engineer, so you don’t
accidentally demolish a wall that’s supporting the roof or the second story.
You can save yourself some money on a kitchen remodel by doing the tear-
out yourself or hiring some unskilled laborers to do it for you. Even if you’re
very careful, you can complete the tear-out operation in less than a day.
You’re then ready to call in the installation crew to mount the cabinets, install
the countertop, lay new flooring, and fit the rest of the pieces in place.
Modernizing kitchen appliances
Chances are pretty good that the distressed homeowners took their kitchen
appliances with them or the ones they left behind are pretty shabby. In a
high-end market, buyers are likely to want to pick out their own appliances.
In a low- to mid-range market, however, having clean, functional appliances in
place is a big plus.
Before you shell out $10,000 or more for top-of-the-line appliances, take a
deep breath and a look around at the housing market in your area, and let
your market guide your choices:
 In low- to mid-range housing, supply the bare essentials — a dishwasher,
garbage disposal, refrigerator/freezer, and freestanding range. 
 In mid- to upper-end housing, consider supplying the higher-end essentials
along with a cabinet with warming drawers and a built-in wine cooler.
Upgrade to a built-in refrigerator with an ice maker and water dispenser,
and consider upgrading the oven and cooking surfaces, and possibly
adding a trash compactor.
 In any market, replace the old microwave with a new, space-saving, over
the counter model. Counter space is golden — free up as much counter
space as possible. 
If you purchased a house without a dishwasher, add one, even if it involves
losing a little cabinet space. You can pick up a standard dishwasher for as
little as $200. If the kitchen already has a dishwasher, installation runs about
$100, and the installer usually hauls away the old unit for $25 or so. Expect a
first-time installation (for a kitchen that doesn’t have a dishwasher) to cost
another $100 or more for the plumbing installation.

Chapter 17: Repairing and Renovating Your Investment Property

Adding Valuable Features
In most of the foreclosure properties I renovate, I rarely add value-boosters. I
buy the house below market value, renovate as needed to bring the house in
line with market value, and sell it. I do, however, stumble across the rare
property that has the potential to jump from one price bracket to the next. 
A small home that’s nestled in an area with much larger homes, for example,
may be a prime candidate for expansion.
When you’re planning renovations, look for any opportunity to boost the
property into a higher price bracket by adding valuable features that other
homes in the area already have. Following are some ideas to get your creative
juices flowing:
 Replace the windows
 Replace the doors
 Add central air-conditioning, if missing
 Open up the floor plan
 Raise the roof
 Add a deck or patio
 Convert underused spaces into living spaces
 Add a bathroom
 Add a bedroom
 Build a garage
Don’t go too crazy modifying the floor plan or converting unused space into
living quarters. I once purchased a house in which the previous owner con-
verted the garage into a den. The house had no garage, and the lot had no
space for one, so the first thing I did was convert the den back into a garage.
When renovating, follow the Hippocratic oath: First, do no harm. Sometimes
the less you do, the better.

Cashing Out: Selling or 
Leasing Your Property
In This Chapter

 Primping your property for a showing
 Marketing your property to spark interest
 Negotiating offers and closing the deal
 Leasing your property for steady cash flow
M
ost investors who deal in foreclosures flip properties — they buy the
property at a bargain price, repair or renovate it if necessary to maxi-
mize their return on investment, and then turn around and place the prop-
erty back on the market. Some investors, however, prefer the buy-and-hold
strategy — leasing the property for a steady cash flow.
In this chapter, I cover both strategies. If you decide to sell, I steer you clear
of the common mistake of trying to sell the home yourself to avoid paying 
a sales commission to an agent. I reveal strategies and tips for pricing the
property to sell and sprucing it up so it sells faster at a higher price. You also
discover some high-power marketing strategies to generate interest in the
property and savvy negotiating maneuvers to obtain the best price without
haggling yourself out of a sale.
For those of you who are practicing the buy-and-hold strategy, I suggest some
of the pros and cons of leasing the property and taking on the role of land-
lord, which many investors are simply not cut out to do.

Selling Through a Qualified 
Real Estate Agent
You can boost your bottom line on a property in two ways — increase the
price or cut expenses. Increasing the price, as discussed later in the section
is often counterproductive, as discussed in “Generating Interest Through
Savvy Marketing,” later in this chapter. Cutting expenses, within reason, may
be a possibility, but steer clear of any temptation to cut costs by trying to sell
the house yourself. Why? In the following sections, I answer that question
and then provide tips on how to select an agent who’s best qualified to sell
your property.
Selling faster for a higher price
Sure, a 6–8 percent agent commission can take a sizeable bite out of your net
profit, but consider the advantages of having an agent:
 On average, an agent sells a home in half the time it takes a homeowner
working alone. If you ballpark your holding costs at $100 per day, you
lose about $3,000 every month your property sits on the market.
 According to the NAR (National Association of Realtors), the average
home sells for 16 percent more when sold by a Realtor. A Realtor is a
282

Sell it yourself?
Sellers often try to sell their homes on their own
to avoid paying an agent commission, but it
rarely saves them enough to justify the hassle.
What usually happens is that when a buyer
shows up to place an offer on the house, the
buyer knows that the seller is saving about 6
percent by listing the home themselves. So, the
buyer automatically deducts an additional 6 per-
cent from his offer. If the sellers accept that
offer, they essentially give the buyer as much as
they would have paid the agent, and the sellers
had to do all the work without the additional
benefits of having professional assistance and
advice!
Most people choose to sell without an agent
because they’ve had a bad experience with a
real estate agent or felt that the agent didn’t do
enough to justify his six percent commission.
This is a very valid point, but it simply means that
the seller didn’t pick the right agent. 
When selling a house, don’t just look at the cost
of hiring an agent. Look at the cost of not hiring
an agent and consider the benefits that an
agent brings to the table . . . particularly the
closing table.

real estate agent who’s certified by the National Association of Realtors
and is required to receive additional training and adhere to a strict code
of ethics. 
 An agent can market to other agents through her access to the MLS
(Multiple Listing Services) and by networking with other agents, reloca-
tion firms, and other services to increase interest in your property and
possibly even start a bidding war that can boost the sales price.
 An agent can pre-screen buyers, so you don’t waste time showing the
home to people who don’t have the cash and can’t obtain the financing
to buy it. You want qualified buyers, not lookie-loos.
 An agent takes on the burden of fielding phone calls from interested
buyers, scheduling tours, showing the house, and handling the paper-
work. That’s time you can spend working on other investment 
properties.
 Having an agent during negotiations is like putting on a poker face when
playing cards. The agent can negotiate with a buyer without giving away
any secrets concerning what you may be willing to accept. 
I recommend that you sell the property yourself only if the conditions are
right:
 Someone walks through while you’re rehabbing and is willing to sign a
purchase agreement on the spot, and you completely understand the
purchase agreement and are confident in executing the agreement with-
out the assistance of a professional.
 You’re in a seller’s market — an area where you have significantly more
buyers than sellers. Try this only for a short period of time. If the house
doesn’t sell, call an agent.
 The house is on a street that already has plenty of buyer traffic, and you
have the best house with the best price. (Of course, if you follow my
guidance in Chapter 17, you should always have the best house at the
best price.)
 You have the time and desire to show the house at any time of day or
night when a buyer calls to see it.
 You have the computer skills required to produce slick marketing mate-
rials and advertise on the Internet.
 You’re able to show the house without tipping your hand.
 You intend to hire an attorney to approve all the documentation and
attend the closing.
In the following sections, I offer guidance on finding an agent who’s best qual-
ified to sell the property. 
283
Chapter 18: Cashing Out: Selling or Leasing Your Property

If you’re trying to sell the home yourself, plant an FSBO (for sale by owner)
sign in the front yard along with a note saying something like “Buyer’s Agents
Welcome” or “Commission Paid to Broker.” This lets buyers agents know that
if they show the home to someone who purchases it, you’re willing to pay
them something. This may increase traffic.
Choosing a top-notch seller’s agent
Real estate agents generally fall into two camps: buyer’s agents and seller’s
agents (also called listing agents). Think of the difference in terms of prose-
cuting and defense attorneys. Each type of attorney specializes in serving a
different type of client with very different needs. 
In real estate, a buyer’s agent is typically much more skilled in looking out for
the interests of the buyer — finding the right house for the buyer at the right
price and negotiating for a lower price and more attractive terms. A seller’s
agent has a skill set that leans more toward marketing and sales. (Some top-
producing agents have a team with both buyer and selling agents. These are
the cream of the crop.) For a seller like you, a seller’s agent offers the follow-
ing unique benefits: 
 Price your house to sell for top dollar without lingering on the market.
 Market your property more effectively — a buyer’s agent may be less
skilled at marketing.
 Ensure that you properly disclose any defects in the property.
 Pass along any information about the buyer that may assist you in nego-
tiating for a higher price.
To choose a qualified real estate agent, make sure the agent has the following
credentials, experience, and drive:
 Credentials: Designation or certification proving that the agent received
proper training, such as CRI (Certified Residential Specialist), GRI
(Graduate Realtor Institute), StarPower Star or member, or Golden R-Top
1% Club.
 Experience: Ten years or more of experience. You may find an inexperi-
enced agent who’s very well qualified, but an experienced agent with a
solid track recorder is more of a sure thing.
 Drive: Choose an agent who does her homework and can provide you
with market analysis and listings of comparable properties. The agent
should be willing to hold open houses, show the house on a moment’s
notice, and be attentive to your questions and needs.

Staging Your House for a 
Successful Showing
Staging a property consists of making it look as pretty as possible. Studies 
by the staging industry (yes, you can hire professionals to stage your home)
prove that a properly staged home sells in half the time for 7–10 percent more
than a comparable un-staged home. Given those numbers, a home that would
normally take three months to sell at a price of $250,000 would sell in six
weeks for $267,500 to $275,000 with professional staging! 
Of course, you’re free to hire a professional stager, but if your budget is already
strained, you can probably do a pretty good job staging the home yourself. In
Flipping Houses For Dummies (Wiley), I devote an entire chapter to the basics.
In the following sections, I provide a brief overview of the areas to focus on
when staging the house you’re selling.
Jazzing up the front entrance
During your renovations, you improve the appearance of the house so much
that minor imperfections stick out. Carefully inspect the outside of the house
for anything that sticks out, and attend to it immediately. Here are some tips
for perking up the curb appeal:
 Spruce up the landscaping. Mow and edge the lawn, pull weeds, fix any
cracks in the pavement, and sweep up after yourself. Lay fresh mulch
and plant fresh flowers (if in season) and keep them watered. While
you’re at it, put the garden hose away and hide the garden gnomes.
 Freshen up the entryways. Sweep the porch and stairs, lay down an
attractive new doormat, fix the screens, wash the windows, polish the
doorknobs, and clear the clutter out of the entryways. Make sure the
doors open and close with ease.
 Check the outside lights. Make sure the porch and security lights are
working. 
285
Chapter 18: Cashing Out: Selling or Leasing Your Property

Decluttering the joint
Clutter makes a house feel cramped and makes buyers nervous. Investment
properties usually don’t have a problem with clutter. You probably de-junked
the place before you started repairs and renovations, but if you can’t walk
through the house without tripping over something, then take the following
steps to remove non-essential items:
 De-junk the joint. Remove all non-essential items. You can sell the stuff,
dump it, or give it away. Just make sure it doesn’t appear on the premises.
 Clear the counters. Counter space is pure gold. In the kitchen, remove
everything from the counters including coffee pots, electric can openers,
blenders, toasters, flour tins, cookie jars, and especially knife racks and
dish drainers. In the bathroom, hide the toothbrush holder, hair
brushes, lotions and creams, and other glamour paraphernalia. 
 Empty the closets. Storage space is prime real estate.
 Ditch politically incorrect décor. A house showing is an emotional
event. Any décor that may stir negative emotions in potential buyers has
to go, including religious icons, political paraphernalia, and zodiac signs.
Adding a few tasteful furnishings
When showing a house, your goal is to create a blank canvas on which buyers
can paint their dreams and visions. Less is more, but a vacant house can be
just as unappealing. Homeowners want to be able to envision themselves
living in the house, so make it look livable with a few tasteful furnishings:
 A small kitchen or dining room table with matching chairs. Dress the
table with an attractive tablecloth (not plastic), a bouquet of fresh-cut
flowers, or some other attractive centerpiece. Better yet, opt for a table
with a glass top — it can make the kitchen look a little roomier.
 An attractive sofa and a coffee table in the living room or den. Accent
the room with a few small lamps and a bit of greenery. Hanging some
nice, simple mirrors that reflect the windows can also create the illusion
of wide-open space.
 A standard-sized bed and small dresser in the master bedroom.
 A few neutral paintings or other artwork on the walls.
Seasoned investors often have some nice surplus furniture left behind in other
homes they’ve sold. To keep costs down, consider moving some furniture
from your permanent residence to the house you’re selling or borrowing sur-
plus furniture from friends or family members.
286
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 

To gather some ideas on how to professionally stage a home, visit a few model
homes in newly constructed subdivisions. You quickly notice that these model
homes are clean, tastefully furnished, and attractively decorated. They’re
never vacant. Also check out the window dressings. In models, instead of
heavy curtains or blinds, you typically see something more airy, like valances.
Appealing to the senses
When you go out to eat at a fine restaurant, the quality of your dining experi-
ence relies on much more than the quality of the food and service. The light-
ing, aromas, and background music all contribute to the ambience. When
staging a home, you want to create a pleasant sensory experience for the
buyer. Following are some tips to assist you:
 Light it up. Turn on all the lights to make the house appear warmer and
roomier and prove that you’re not trying to hide something.
 Bring the outside in. If the weather’s nice, open up the house to air it out.
Add fresh cut flowers to the kitchen, living room, and den to add a fresh,
natural aroma. Most professional homeowners recommend against using
potpourri, scented candles, and air fresheners. If the home has a fireplace,
consider lighting it . . . only in season, of course. Another nice touch is to
arrange cut and uncut citrus fruit in a glass bowl on the kitchen counter
or dining room table — the natural aroma of fresh citrus is pleasant with-
out being overpowering and the arrangement is both attractive and 
inexpensive. 
 Play some relaxing background music. Classical music is often a good
choice. Rock, rap, and heavy metal are usually bad choices.
If you’re living in the house you’re selling, you may be tempted to hang out
while your agent shows the prospective buyers around. Avoid the tempta-
tion. Your presence can make the buyers nervous and make the house feel
crowded. Step out until everyone leaves. You can contact your agent after the
showing to find out how it went.
Generating Interest Through 
Savvy Marketing
If you took my advice and hired a top-notch seller’s agent to list your prop-
erty, she can handle the marketing for you, primarily by creating an MLS list-
ing. If you decide to sell the home on your own, the marketing job falls on
your shoulders, and without access to the MLS, you have to ramp up your
287
Chapter 18: Cashing Out: Selling or Leasing Your Property

marketing efforts. Here are some ideas on how to create your own effective
marketing campaign: 
 Set a competitive asking price. Shoppers look for value. Set the right
asking price, and you attract more buyers. Set your asking price too
high, and the property is likely to linger on the market while holding
costs chip away at your profit. Set the price too low, and prospective
buyers may think there’s something wrong with the house. Starting a
little high is preferable to starting a little low — you can adjust down,
but adjusting up can raise some eyebrows. Smart agents and buyers ask
for a listing history.
 Plant a For Sale sign on the front lawn. The For Sale sign taps into 
“the power of 20” — the five neighbors on either side of you and the ten
neighbors across the street immediately notice the sign and start telling
people about it. Use a professional sign, not one of those cheap, wire-
frame jobs they sell at the local hardware store.
 List the property online. Several companies list homes for sale by
owner, where buyers can search for homes without going through an
agent. Before you sign up with one of these services, make sure that it’s
legitimate, that it lists plenty of homes in your area, and that it’s used by
many buyers in your area.
 Advertise in the classifieds. Post an ad in the classified section of your
local newspaper and on any classifieds sites, such as Craig’s list (at
sfbay.craigslist.org) and Backpage (at www.backpage.com). 
 Design, print, and distribute flashy fliers. Include full-color photos of
the property highlighting its most attractive features. Also include the
address of the property, the asking price, a description of the property,
your name, and your phone number. Print the fliers on high-quality
paper and post them wherever you can legally do so — grocery stores,
gas stations, restaurants, and apartment complexes, to name a few.
 Design, print, and distribute business cards. Create a business card for
the house and pass it out to everyone you meet.
 Generate some word-of-mouth buzz. Soon after placing the house on
the market, host an open house and invite the neighbors. Post some
Open House signs around the neighborhood and provide food and bev-
erages. Sunday afternoons are usually the best times to schedule an
open house, because people have nothing better to do.
To effectively market any product, determine who’s likely to buy it. When
marketing a house to a first-time homeowner, for example, you may highlight
the affordability of the house and provide a lead on where to go for financing.
When marketing to movin’-on-up buyers, you may want to pitch the house as
being spacious beyond belief. Empty-nesters and down-sizers are often look-
ing for something smaller that’s in move-in condition. Consider sending flyers
to the residents of local apartment complexes. Modify your marketing materi-
als to appeal to your target buyers. 
288

Negotiating Offers and Counteroffers
When prospective buyers deem your house worthy of purchase, they present
an offer, in writing, of the price and terms. The high-profile part of the offer is
the purchase price, but savvy sellers don’t focus on price alone. They con-
sider the price and terms of the offer. In many cases, a lower offer is superior
if the buyer has the cash or financing in place and doesn’t demand a lot of
extras, such as closing costs and repairs.
In the following sections, I provide some guidance on how to pick the best
offer from two or more competing offers and show you how to negotiate to
get more of what you want.
Comparing offers
When you’re buying and selling houses, you need to be able to evaluate
offers based on the following factors:
 Price: An obvious lowball offer may cause some concern, but if you set
your asking price in line with comparable properties, the offer should
include a price that’s pretty close to your asking price. I usually consider
a cash offer of 5 percent below my asking price pretty good, and I expect
a higher offer if the buyer needs to finance the purchase.
 Buyer’s financing: Cash is King, pre-approved financing is Queen, and
pre-qualification is a Jack. An offer that proves the ability of the buyer to
close on the sale is much better than an offer from buyers who plan on
applying for a loan after they find the house they want. If you have any
doubts about a buyer’s financing, ask them to contact your mortgage
specialist (loan officer), who can then advise you on the buyers’ ability
to qualify for financing. 
 Earnest money: The more earnest money a buyer includes with the pur-
chase offer, the more likely the buyer is willing and able to purchase the
property. An earnest money deposit of at least 1 percent of the purchase
price shows a fairly strong buyer commitment.
 Conditional clauses: Standard conditions include that the property
must appraise at the sales price or higher, title must be clear, and the
house must pass inspection. Watch out for anything that can undermine
the closing, including conditions that the buyer’s existing home must
sell first. Contingencies that allow the buyer to back out of the deal with-
out just cause (commonly called weasel clauses) also raise red flags,
such as “buyer’s attorney must review and approve the offer.”
 Closing date: A faster closing reduces your holding costs, so if one
buyer offers $2,000 less than another buyer but can close a month ear-
lier, the lower offer may be the better offer.
289
Chapter 18: Cashing Out: Selling or Leasing Your Property

Accept offers only from serious buyers who are at least pre-qualified for a
loan that’s sufficient for purchasing your house. Have your mortgage special-
ist on call to check up on a prospective buyer’s qualifications before you sign
the purchase agreement. Your mortgage specialist can contact the buyer’s
lender and perform background checks to ensure that the buyer has suffi-
cient financing in place.
If you’re not 100 percent confident in a buyer’s offer, consider countering the
offer with a 72-hour contingency. This allows you to accept the buyer’s offer
while continuing to market the property. Your agent should be well versed in
this strategy. 
Mastering the art of counteroffers
Some offers are so low, all you can do is laugh and shrug them off, but in
most cases, no offer is too low to reject outright. When you receive an offer
that appears to be a little irrational, don’t take it personally. If you’re not
ready to say either “yes” or “no,” simply reply with your counteroffer.
To more effectively navigate counteroffer negotiations, employ the following
strategies and tips:
 Pitch the counteroffer through your agent. Otherwise, you risk tipping
your hand. 
 Make yourself readily available to your agent during the negotiation
process, so you can quickly respond to counteroffers. 
290
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 
Steering clear of cash back at closing deals
More and more buyers are looking to get a little
cash back at the closing table. They may even
offer to pay more than your asking price with the
agreement that you will hand the excess cash
back to them at closing. Cash back at closing
deals are illegal, no matter what the buyer claims
to need the money for—repairs, renovations, to
pay off credit cards or medical bills, whatever.
Why are these deals illegal? Because the
lender is never “in the know.” To obtain cash
back at closing, the buyer must fool the lender
into thinking that the house is worth as much as
the buyer is asking to borrow. The lender
approves the loan thinking that the home’s value
is sufficient to cover the loan amount — if the
borrower can’t pay the mortgage, the bank can
foreclose and sell the house to cover the loss.
Cash back at closing deals trick lenders into
approving riskier loans.
If someone approaches you with a cash back
deal, call the lender. The lender’s phone number
is usually listed on the mortgage note or the
closing instruction letter included in the closing
papers.

 Don’t bid against yourself. Wait for the buyer’s counteroffer before offer-
ing any additional concessions.
 Don’t give ultimatums. Ultimatums or take-it-or-leave-it offers shut down
communications. Successful negotiations require an open forum.
 Don’t let a personality clash get in the way of making the deal.
 Keep a lid on it. If you talk too much, you’re liable to tip your hand or
upset the buyer, neither of which is productive.
 Respond only in writing. If the buyers or their agent contact you over
the phone with a proposed offer, request that they present it in writing
to keep it legal. In real estate, everything has to be in writing to be legal.
If you receive an offer that is pretty close to what you want, you don’t have to
counter. If you can live with the offer, countering a couple thousand dollars
higher may be a bad idea, and it generally is. It lets the buyer off the hook
and free to pursue the search for another house. If you are getting lots of
offers, then you may want to counter, but in a buyer’s market, an offer that’s
close to what you want, with acceptable terms, may just be a great offer.
Consider countering a low-ball offer with a high-ball offer. If the buyer offers
$100,000 on a house you listed for $143,000, consider countering with
$142,500. This lets the buyer know that you’ll deal, but they have to be seri-
ous. Have your agent contact the buyer’s agent and try to feel them out why
the offer was so low. Have your agent “play the game” — tell them that the
sell has some wiggle room, but not that much. Your agent may say she con-
vinced you not to just completely reject the offer but to try to work with this
buyer. This may build some good will with the buyer that may result in a
more reasonable offer. Your other option is to simply write “Rejected” across
the offer and send it back to them.
Closing the Deal
After you and the buyers reach an agreement on price and terms, and assum-
ing nothing happens to sabotage the deal, the sale proceeds to closing, where
you receive your money and sign over the deed to the buyer. At this point,
you have two goals — to make the closing proceed as smoothly as possible
and to ensure that your back end is covered. 
As soon as you and the buyer agree on price and terms, return the docu-
ments to the buyer’s mortgage company and to your title company or real
estate attorney and schedule a closing date. Closings typically occur 30 to 
45 days from the day you sell the property, so you don’t want to waste any
time. As soon as you sell the property, you must order the title policy, the
mortgage commitment. Neither the buyer nor seller need to worry about 
291
Chapter 18: Cashing Out: Selling or Leasing Your Property

this — your real estate agent keeps the process moving forward and can rec-
ommend a title company or attorney to handle the paperwork.
To ensure that the closing proceeds as smoothly as possible, supply your
closing agent with any documents she may need to put together the closing
packets. Documents typically include the following:
 Termite inspection report. If the buyer is receiving FHA (Federal Housing
Administration) financing to purchase the house, immediately schedule
a termite inspection and send the report to the closing agent or attorney
who’s handling the closing.
 Purchase agreement and any addendums.
 Mortgage payoff information and any second mortgages or other liens.
Even if you sell the house yourself, you should have professional representa-
tion at the closing — a qualified Realtor or a real estate attorney. Remember
that Realtors are not lawyers and cannot give legal advice. Obtain the closing
packet two or three days prior to closing, review the papers with the assis-
tance of your attorney or Realtor, and clear up any issues and concerns prior
to closing time. Get your attorney involved before you sign on the dotted line.
After you sign, your attorney has much less power to protect you.
Becoming a Landlord
Most people who invest in real estate are looking for a quick score. They buy,
sell, and then sit back and count the money. Others prefer the buy-and-hold
strategy, renting out the property for some period of time before selling it.
The buy-and hold strategy offers several valuable benefits:
 By holding the property for one year and a day, you pay long-term rather
than short-term capital gains on your profit. During the writing of this
book the feds were charging 35 percent in short-term capital gains and
only 15 percent in long-term capital gains.
 You can claim depreciation of the property as a tax deduction. This is a
rare tax situation in which you can claim depreciation as the property
appreciates.
 You profit in three ways — you profit when you buy the property below
market value, the property appreciates over time, and the rent from
your tenants pays down the principle on the loan.
 You can deduct any expenses you incur for the maintenance and man-
agement of the property.

These tips are simply suggestions on strategies to discuss with your accountant.
Keep in mind that not everyone is landlord material. You have to find renters,
collect the rent, maintain the property, and be able to handle calls from 
tenants at any time of the day or night. You may be able to hire a property
management company to take care of all this for you, but that can cut into
your profits. If you’re considering the leasing option, I strongly recommend
that you read Property Management For Dummies by Robert S. Griswold
(Wiley).

 Selling your senior lien to a junior lien holder
B
uying a foreclosure property, fixing it up (or not), and then placing it
back on the market is the most common way to profit from your foreclo-
sure, but it’s not the only way. You can instantly profit from your property by
refinancing your loan for more than you’ve invested in the property, or you
can sell or lease the property back to the previous owners, or even sell the
senior mortgage you bought at auction to another lien holder.
In this chapter, I reveal several strategies to pull the equity out of your prop-
erty along with other novel ways to profit from your foreclosure investment. 
Refinancing to Cash Out the Equity
Homeowners commonly refinance their homes to cash out equity. Refinancing
consists of simply taking out a new mortgage for more than you currently owe
on the property and paying off the old mortgage. Assuming you purchased
the property significantly below market value and your credit is in pretty
good shape, you may be able to turn right around after the purchase and 
refinance to cash out that equity. 

I say “may” because some lenders won’t refinance a mortgage until after
you’ve owned a home for six months and a day or a year and a day. The
reason for this is because a house is only worth what you actually paid for it
or what it appraises for, whichever is lower. A home equity loan to cover
repairs and renovations, however, is often easier to obtain.
You don’t have to cash out all the equity in a property. You can cash out a
portion of it to cover repairs and renovations and cash out the rest of the
equity when you sell the property.
When refinancing to cash out the equity in a home, be as careful shopping for
mortgages as you were when you borrowed the money to purchase the prop-
erty. Avoid high-cost loans and any loans that have pre-payment penalties,
especially if you’re planning to place the house back on the market soon. See
Chapter 5 for guidance on shopping for low-cost loans.
Reselling the Property to the Previous
Owners . . . Or Their Family
After you officially own a property, it’s yours to sell, and the previous home-
owners have to move out . . . if they didn’t move out already. Sometimes after
foreclosure, however, the homeowners break the news to other family mem-
bers who are in a position to bail them out by loaning or gifting them some
money or buying the house and letting them live in it. In such cases, you may
be able to sell the property back to the original owners or their family.
In the following sections, I reveal some do’s and don’ts that apply to these sit-
uations along with some of the positive aspects of selling a foreclosure back
to the previous owners.
Reselling to the previous owners
The previous owners are likely to do whatever it takes to remain in their
home. If their financial situation has improved since the foreclosure or
friends and family members have offered them a good chunk of cash, they
may now be in a position to buy back the property. The opportunity, how-
ever, is not always available or attractive for you as an investor. Keep the fol-
lowing caveats in mind:
 If the property has any liens against it that were wiped off the books by
the foreclosure, those liens reattach themselves to the property if the
previous homeowners buy it back. This can often drive the homeowners
back into foreclosure, which isn’t something you or they really want.
296
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 

 You can’t strip the homeowners of all the equity they have built up in the
property. Say, for example, you purchased a property worth $300,000 
for $175,000. If you sell it back to the previous homeowners for $300,000,
you’ve taken all the equity out of the house. You have two options here —
sell the house to someone else for $300,000 or sell it back to the previous
owners at a discount of say $225,000. Whatever you do, you don’t want
to be an equity stripper. See the following sidebar, “Equity stripping —
Don’t do it!” for details.
297
Chapter 19: Checking Out Other Cash-Out Strategies
Equity stripping — Don’t do it!
Homeowners who are facing foreclosure are
often unaware of their options and of just how
much equity they have built up in their property.
They may have been making their monthly mort-
gage payments for 10 or 15 years while housing
values in their neighborhood have been rising
at a rate of 5 to 10 percent annually. They’re
completely unaware that the house they bought
for $100,000 ten years ago is now worth
$150,000, and they’ve paid off about $14,000 of
the principal, so they now have $64,000 worth of
equity. All they see are the monthly bills coming
in that they can’t pay.
The homeowners’ ignorance of the amount of
equity they have built up in their home can make
them vulnerable to predatory lenders and other
crooks who want to cash out that equity for
themselves. These equity strippers employ a
variety of schemes to bleed this money out of the
homeowners, including schemes such as these:
 Mortgage brokers attempt to convince the
homeowners to refinance their way out of a
financial setback by taking out a loan with
higher monthly mortgage payments than
the homeowners can afford. The mortgage
broker rakes in the payments until the
homeowners run out of money, and then the
lender forecloses on the property.
 Crooked investors convince homeowners
who have a substantial amount of equity
built up in their property to sell the property
to them for significantly less than the prop-
erty is worth. The “investor” may promise
the homeowners that they can continue
living in the home indefinitely, and then, as
soon as the homeowners sign the papers,
the con artist evicts them.
 Con artists offer to save the homeowners
from foreclosure. All the homeowners have
to do is sign a quit claim deed over to the
con artist, and the con artist will take care
of everything. What the con artist does take
care of is re-conveying the property’s title
to his own name.
 A con artist may offer to buy the home from
the homeowners and lease it back to them.
The con artist collects the monthly rent and
never pays off the underlying mortgage, so
the homeowners lose their rent money and
lose the house in foreclosure.
If you buy a property directly from homeowners
facing foreclosure or at auction for a bargain-
basement price and then sell the property back
to the homeowners at full-market value, you’re
practicing yet another form of equity stripping,
which the courts frown upon. Whether or not
you get caught, it’s still wrong, and if you do get
caught, you can look forward to a hefty fine and
perhaps some jail time or at least undoing the
transaction and having to put the homeowners
back in the position they were in before they
met you.

Why would you agree to accept less than full-market value for the house?
Whenever I can earn a quick, tidy profit on a house and do the right thing for
the homeowners, I jump at the chance. Usually, I develop a close relationship
with the homeowners during the foreclosure process, and I don’t want to
destroy their trust by taking them to the cleaners. In addition, I don’t want to
ruin my reputation in the community — I’m in it for the long-term. If I treat the
homeowners fairly, they’re likely to recommend me to others they know who
find themselves in similar situations. If you can earn a fair profit while helping
your fellow man and woman, I strongly encourage you to do so. Otherwise,
simply have them move out and sell to someone who can afford to pay the
full price.
Another reason you may want to consider selling the property back to the
previous owners comes down to simple economics. Say you’re facing the like-
lihood of holding the property for six months. At $100 per day in holding costs,
you’re looking at a total bill of $18,000. On top of that, figure closing costs of 
7 percent on $200,000 (a total of $14,000), and your bill is now up to $32,000.
Now figure in your time and effort plus the costs of repairs and renovations.
Sure, the homeowners get a break, but you also save yourself some money.

Life-saving life insurance
I recently had a very positive experience with a
man who lost his wife and had substantial life
insurance policy proceeds coming to him. He
had suffered with his wife’s illness on and off for
the last few years, struggling to keep things
together both at home and at work. 
I bought the house in foreclosure not knowing
the situation beforehand. The man’s wife was in
fact still alive when the foreclosure happened.
About a month or so before the end of the
redemption period, she passed away. He was
now being forced to deal with the foreclosure
on top of it all. 
He told me he would like to buy the house back
and that he would do so with cash from the life
insurance, but that the check wouldn’t arrive
until after the expiration of redemption. I spoke
with him and his family quite extensively, and
what he ultimately decided was to use the
money to buy something else. I think he made
the right decision. The house needed some
work, and he didn’t feel that he was up to the
challenge. 
He decided to buy a condo, pay cash, and let
someone else worry about the upkeep. I worked
with him and gave him plenty of time — first to
mourn, and then to close on his new condo and
move. He worked with me, and I with him, and
he left the house nearly spotless. 
Sometimes doing the right thing means you wait
a little longer for your profits. I sold that house
and made my money, he got a fresh start with-
out the burden of the house, and I know that the
time I waited will pay off tenfold with positive
word of mouth. He and his family couldn’t stop
thanking me for what I had done.

If you took out a traditional loan to purchase the property, your mortgage
probably has a due on sale clause, which means you cannot sell the property
back to the previous homeowners without the lender’s approval. 
If selling the home back to the previous homeowners is not an option due to
the possibility of having other liens reattach to the property, you may be able
to sell to a family member who agrees to let the homeowners remain living in
the house.
Financing the buyback through insurance
policy proceeds and other means
Homeowners are often unaware of assets and other collateral they may have
to secure financing, or they come into some quick money after the foreclo-
sure is a done deal. In such cases, you may be able to assist the homeowners
in obtaining the funds needed to buy back the property simply by making
them aware of their options. Following are two options that may be available:
 Life insurance policies: If the home ended up in foreclosure because
one of the homeowners passed away and the homeowner had a life
insurance policy, cashing out that policy may provide sufficient funds
for the surviving homeowner to repurchase the property. In some cases,
a serious illness drives a couple into foreclosure, and then the spouse
who was seriously ill passes away leaving behind a life insurance policy
that can cover the purchase price. See the following sidebar, “Life-saving
life insurance.”
 Retirement savings: You can borrow against some retirement plans for
the purchase of a house. If the homeowners have sufficient retirement
savings, they may be able to borrow against it to buy the house back
from you.
Leasing the Property to the Foreclosed-
Upon Homeowners
Families are often reluctant to move out of their home because they have kids
in school. They really need to sell the house and find more affordable accom-
modations, but they don’t want to force their kids to change schools. In such
cases, you may want to consider purchasing the property and then leasing it
back to the family until the kids move out or the family has more time to plan.
299
Chapter 19: Checking Out Other Cash-Out Strategies

Don’t jump into a lease agreement with the previous homeowners before
you’ve performed some serious number crunching. If the homeowners 
couldn’t afford the monthly house payments, don’t sign them up for a lease
that has them paying monthly rent they can’t afford. You’ll simply end up
with some deadbeat renters and set the family up for another failure. Before
offering them the option to rent, make sure they’ve resolved the issues that
sent them into foreclosure and that they can afford the rent.
If you decide to rent out the property to the previous homeowners, consult
your real estate attorney and have her draw up a lease agreement. Keep in
mind that not everyone is cut out to be a landlord. See Chapter 18 for details
about leasing the property and for recommendations on additional resources
that can assist you in properly managing a rental property.
Offering a Lease-Option Agreement
When a buyer really wants to purchase a property but is not currently in the
financial position to do so (whether they’re the previous owners or some
other buyers), you may consider offering them a lease-option agreement, as
discussed in Chapter 9. Perhaps the buyers need more time to secure financ-
ing or fix something on their credit report, or they’re waiting for an insurance
check or some other payment. With a lease option, the buyers agree to rent
the property from you for a fixed period with the option to purchase the
property at the end of that period.
Lease options are not always viable, but if the homeowners can come up 
with a down payment and provide some assurance that they will be receiving
money or be able to qualify for financing in the specified time, a lease option
enables you to establish some revenue flow while you’re waiting to sell the
property. I usually structure lease-option deals as follows:
 Down payment: Normally I require 5–10 percent down. You may want
more money down when dealing with buyers who’ve just been through
foreclosure. You credit them for the down payment by taking it off the
purchase price, but a substantial down payment assures you that they’re
serious. If they can’t afford it, they can’t afford it — let them move on. 
 Rent: I usually specify that rent is due on the first of the month and set
the rent at about 1 percent of the purchase price or as close to that
amount as is affordable. You don’t want to be too flexible, but you don’t
want to break the bank either. I offer a bonus for paying on time and add
the monthly payments to the down payment. 
 Terms and conditions: The agreement should spell out the lease term
and conditions. Your lease-option agreement should contain a forfeiture
300
Part V: Cashing Out Your Profit . . . after the Sale 

clause stating that non-payment results in the forfeiture of the option
and the down payment. The agreement should also contain a statement
that the option is exercisable at any time, with no prepayment penalty
or anything like that. What I tell them is if you win the lottery and want
to pay it off tomorrow that’s fine by me. I want them to succeed, and I
want to realize my profit — the faster the better.

Repeating the same mistake
Whenever you’re working with homeowners
who have a less-than-stellar track record, be
careful. People tend to follow the same patterns
and repeat the same mistakes.
I once purchased a foreclosure property at auc-
tion for $245,000. The house was worth about
$550,000. The couple who owned the property
was fairly affluent, but the wife, who was in
charge of making the monthly mortgage pay-
ments, wasn’t much of a money manager. She
failed to make the payments and failed to tell her
husband about it. The property ended up on the
auction block, and I bought it. I actually won the
auction with an overbid of $50,000 — that is, I
bid $50,000 more than what was owed on the
mortgage. That $50,000 was placed in escrow.
The couple was entitled to it. 
I could have sold the property for $550,000 and
walked away with nearly $300,000 in profit, but
when I heard the husband tell the story, I figured
I’d give the couple a break and sell it back to
them for about $300,000 — about $50,000 more
than I had paid for it. I knew they had access to
the $50,000 in overbid money, so that was a
pretty good down payment, and the husband
earned a good income, so the couple certainly
had the means to regain their financial footing
and could afford the house. The husband was
going to take over the job of paying the bills. My
attorney happened to be in my office that day
and sat in on the interview. He advised me to
have the couple move and sell the house at full
value. I went against his advice because of the
husband.
I offered the couple a lease-option agreement
that gave them 12 months to buy back the
house. They paid me the $50,000 down payment,
and I gave them back $10,000 to help them cover
their monthly bills. They managed to make their
monthly payments for about five months. Then,
they stopped making payments. What hap-
pened? After about five months, the wife
insisted on re-assuming the responsibility of
paying the bills, and the husband let her. As
soon as he stopped managing the finances, the
payments stopped. He didn’t realize what was
happening until I called and told him that they
had forfeited the lease option. 
During those first five months, they easily could
have sold the house themselves for $550,000,
paid me the balance of $250,000, and walked
away with over $200,000, but they chose to stiff
me. I took possession of the property, and they
lost everything — the $50,000 overbid, their
house, and the opportunity to make $200,000
free and clear. I didn’t feel any sympathy for
them. I had given them a break, and they went
back to their same old patterns that got them in
trouble in the first place.
When you’re working with distressed home-
owners, be careful. People often develop
expensive habits and destructive patterns that
are tough to break.

Make sure the renters understand that they are renting with an option. If they
don’t exercise their option during the option period, they may forfeit it. If
they don’t pay rent, they may forfeit it. Make the terms clear. Follow up with
them throughout the lease-option period, ask how their mortgage hunt is
coming along, and refer them to mortgage lenders you may know.
Tip during the paper-signing stage, we use a Dictaphone and ask permission
to have the transaction on tape from beginning to end. I tell my client that
this is a protection for all of us to make sure that we all live up to our parts of
the agreement. I make sure that we’re thorough, that we allow them to ask
questions, and we encourage them to seek legal counsel.
Assigning Your Position 
to a Junior Lien Holder 
Say you buy the first mortgage. Do you have to take possession of the prop-
erty to make a buck? Nope. You can sell your position to a junior lien holder
and avoid the ugliness of eviction and the hassles of repairing and renovating
the property. Here’s how it works, assuming you’re working in an area with a
redemption period:
1. You buy the first mortgage, either at auction or by negotiating a short
sale with the lender. You now have controlling interest . . . just make
sure you pay any back property taxes.
2. You wait out the redemption period. If the property has other liens
against it and they decide to foreclose, another investor may buy one of
the junior liens at sheriff sale. If another investor buys a junior lien on
the property, the clock on that redemption period just begins to start
ticking, while you’re already partially through the redemption period on
your investment.
3. You approach the holder of the junior lien and say something like,
“Look, if you buy my interest, I’ll sign over my position to you.” Make
your offer worth it for the junior lien holder; otherwise, she may be
better off redeeming your lien and waiting a little longer. If your offer
makes sense and the junior lien holder knows what she’s doing, she’ll
find the offer attractive, because she gains not only your first mortgage
but also your position in the redemption period rather than having to
start from scratch.

Leveraging your position
Knowing the lien holder positions, as discussed
in Chapter 15, can often open your eyes to win-
win situations with other parties who have a
financial interest in the property.
I purchased a first mortgage on a property 
at auction. The house had a second mortgage
on it — a lien on it by the local police depart-
ment and our county prosecutor. The owner
pleaded guilty to drug dealing and had to pay a
fine of about $50,000, which was taken as a lien
against the house. We were about a week shy
of the expiration of the redemption period, and
the county was going to redeem us, meaning
we stood to get our money back, and that was
about all.
I knew from experience that the county didn’t
want to pay me off and then take possession of
the property and have to sell it, so I called the
prosecutor in charge of drug seizures in
Macomb County and explained the situation to
her. I told her that if she would agree not to
redeem our first mortgage, we would split our
profits with the county 50/50. It took me less
than an hour to work out an agreement. She
came back with a counteroffer. She wanted a
guaranteed minimum of $20,000, which was a
smart move on her part. I agreed.
We ended up taking possession of the property
and selling it for a $37,000 profit. The county
received the first $20,000, and we received
$17,000. We sold the house pretty quickly and
got what we wanted out of it, and the county
was able to acquire $20,000 without the hassle
of dealing with the property. 
Had we not struck a deal, we would have
walked away with nothing.
The take-home message here is that you have
to remain constantly vigilant throughout the
process and be prepared to deal with the other
lien holders. Remain flexible and constantly on
the lookout for win-win opportunities . . . other-
wise, you may just find yourself the big loser.

Ten Common Beginner Blunders
In This Chapter
 Avoiding the mistake of underestimating costs and overestimating profits

 Stifling your desire to overbid on a property
 Suppressing the urge to skip research and make assumptions
 Avoiding the tendency to start renovations too soon
T
he difference between profiting in foreclosures and losing your shirt often
hinges on your ability to avoid the most common mistakes. In this chap-
ter, I point out the ten most common foreclosure investment blunders so you
don’t have to experience them first hand.
Having Insufficient Funds on Hand
Novice investors often underestimate costs and overestimate the future sales
price of a property or they take on too many projects and find that they’re
quickly in over their heads with maxed-out credit. To avoid these common
pitfalls, I offer four suggestions:
 Play it safe. Overestimate costs and underestimate profits. After doing
your research and calculations, if you’re not fairly certain that you can
earn a profit of 20 percent or better on a property, don’t buy it. Wait for
the right opportunity.
 Start small. Making mistakes on a half-million dollar property generally
cost more than making those same mistakes on a $100,000 property.
Holding costs alone on a half-million dollar property can sink a small-
time, novice investor. Start investing in more affordable properties and
work your way up slowly — take the crawl-walk-run approach.

 Start slowly. Buy, renovate, and sell one foreclosure property at a time
and do each one right from start to finish. In your enthusiasm to become
a wealthy real estate investor, you may be tempted to buy several prop-
erties at your first auction. Don’t succumb to such temptations. 
 Don’t rush a purchase. Don’t think you’re failing because it has been
three months and you haven’t bought anything. Keep working on finding
a property until the right opportunity comes along. Profits in real estate
can be high, but mistakes are almost always costly.
By starting with one property at a time, you reduce your exposure to risk
while learning from your mistakes. If you buy five properties all at once, you’re
likely to make the same mistake on all five properties. Buy one, make your
mistakes, learn from those mistakes, and then avoid making the same mis-
takes on your next property. After you’ve eliminated all of your mistakes
(something I’m still working on accomplishing in my 30 years of investing),
consider taking on more projects.
Overestimating a Property’s Value
Housing values don’t exactly have a glass ceiling. The values of comparable
homes in the same neighborhood set the upper limit on what you can expect.
If you’re thinking that you can break through the ceiling by transforming a
shack into a showpiece, think again. You ultimately over-improve the house
and end up giving away thousands of dollars in renovations as a house-
warming gift to the buyers.
You make your profit when you buy a house. Make sure you buy at a price
that enables you to earn at least 20 percent on your total investment, which
includes the purchase price, holding costs (monthly loan payments, property
taxes, insurance, and utilities for the duration of the project), the cost of
repairs and renovations, and the cost of selling the property. 
Underestimating Your Holding Costs
Investors often take a hit on holding costs — property taxes, insurance, inter-
est payments, and utilities paid between the time they purchase the property
and the time they sell it. Holding costs can be particularly burdensome when
you purchase properties in an up market and the market suddenly tanks.
Anticipate daily holding costs to exceed $100 per day (over $3,000 per month),
and carefully calculate your holding costs well in advance of any project.
Sure $100 per day in holding costs seems a little steep, but I’ve done the
math. Trust me, you can expect to pay $100 or more per day in holding costs.
See Chapter 11 for more about holding costs.
308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Don’t forget to account for holding costs through the duration of the redemp-
tion period, and whenever you pay property taxes and insurance premiums
during this period, be sure to file an affidavit at the recorder’s office, so if
someone redeems the property, you can be reimbursed for these expenses.
Overbidding in the Heat of Battle
In Chapter 11, I cover the topic of bidding at foreclosure auctions in detail
and warn you to set a maximum bid price and stick to it, but I can’t empha-
size this point enough. Bidding at auction is a very emotional experience that
often drives up the price in a hurry. If you’re anything like me, you hate to
lose a property to another investor and are likely to bid yourself right out 
of a profit.
To avoid the temptation to overbid, write down your maximum bid amount
prior to auction and look at it before the bidding starts. Consider having
someone who’s less emotionally involved accompany you to the auction 
and prevent you from exceeding your maximum bid amount. When the bid-
ding rises above your upper limit, drop out. You’ll always have another
opportunity.
Failing to Investigate the Title
The title is the single most important document attached to the property. It
contains the names of the legal owners of the property along with the names
of any lien holders and the claims against the property. If you don’t look at
the title before you bid or make an offer on the house, you’re flying totally
blind with a completely disabled instrument panel. When you fail to inspect
the title, you leave yourself wide open to the following risks:
 Buying a property that someone else has already recently closed on.
Con artists may sell the same home to several different buyers and let
the buyers sort out who really owns it. Don’t assume this won’t happen
to you — it happens more often than you may think.
 Buying a junior lien thinking that you’re buying the senior lien. After the
foreclosure process runs its course, your junior lien may be wiped out,
leaving you with nothing.
 Buying the house from the owners when some other investor has already
purchased the senior lien without your knowledge. When homeowners
get desperate, they may try anything, even fraud. Even if you research
the title on your own, when buying directly from homeowners, purchase
title insurance and hire the title company to manage the closing.
309
Chapter 20: Ten Common Beginner Blunders

Always research the title before bidding on or purchasing a property from the
homeowners. You can order a title commitment from your title company. In
Chapter 8, I show you how to properly research a property to avoid the
common pitfall of buying a house not knowing what you’re buying. If you do
the research yourself, double- and triple-check your work before you bid.
Failing to Inspect the Property 
with Your Own Eyes
Just because a property looks like a great investment on paper doesn’t mean
it’s a great investment property. My crew came very close to purchasing a
gutted shell of a home at auction, but fortunately one of my colleagues pru-
dently did a walk around inspection and noticed that the back of the house
was gutted by fire. The front and sides looked great!
Before you purchase a property, the least you should do is drive to the loca-
tion, look around the neighborhood, and do a walk-around inspection of the
property taking several photos of every side. Knock on the font door and try
to engage the homeowners in a conversation. While conversing, try to look
past them into the house. You may be able to convince them to invite you 
in, but don’t count on it. Stop short of hopping the fence, so you won’t be
charged with trespassing or find yourself staring down the barrel of a gun —
it’s happened to me.
Bidding on a Second Mortgage 
or Junior Lien
Shortly after some real estate investment guru comes to town and stages a
“free” seminar on investing in foreclosures, my office receives a rash of calls
from distressed investors who reportedly followed the guru’s advice and
stood to lose a lot of money. In most cases, the person failed to research the
title and ended up purchasing one or more second mortgages or junior liens,
which were likely to be wiped out by the foreclosure process. In one case, an
intelligent professional purchased over $100,000 in worthless paper during a
single auction!
You can make money purchasing second mortgages or junior liens, but you
really have to know what you’re doing and remain constantly aware of the
310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

liens that hold precedence over yours. In Chapter 19, I introduce you to the
strategy of buying and profiting from junior liens. However, I always advise
beginners to steer clear of junior liens until they’ve gained some experience
buying senior liens.
Never buy a junior lien unless you intend to purchase the senior lien at auc-
tion or redeem the property from the senior lien holder. Otherwise, you stand
to lose your entire investment.
Renovating a Property before You Own It
In your enthusiasm to score a quick profit from your investment property,
you may be eager to get inside and start renovating the property during the
redemption period. Many investors have made this mistake and have paid
dearly for it.
In areas that have a redemption period, the homeowners have the right to
pay off the lien, along with any penalties and interests, at any time during the
redemption period . . . up to the final day. If you invest time, money, and
effort into repairing and renovating the property, and the owners decide to
redeem, you lose all the time, money, and effort you invested. You may even
face legal claims against you. 
Some jurisdictions allow acceleration of redemption periods if the house is
abandoned, but follow the required steps and have an attorney draft the
paperwork and advise you on how to move forward legally.
Trusting What the Homeowners Tell You
Homeowners who are facing foreclosure are often willing to say anything to
convince you to let them remain living in their home or paying them as close
to full market value as they can get. They’ll tell you the house is in perfect
condition, they have money coming in, their grandmother just died for the
third time this month, or promise they’ll “move out as soon as they find a
place,” whenever that is. I’ve even had a couple tell me that their baby had
died. Their baby hadn’t died. Confirm anything that sounds fishy. 
I can’t blame people facing foreclosure for bending the truth. If I were in the
same situation, I may be tempted to float a few white lies, myself. As an
investor, try to retain your compassion, but don’t believe everything you
hear. Offer a suitable concession, have the homeowners agree to it (in writ-
ing), and then hold them to it. In Chapter 16, I offer some suggestions for
perks to consider offering to encourage the homeowners to move on. 
311
Chapter 20: Ten Common Beginner Blunders

The cleverest homeowners tell you that the house is in really bad shape and
that you will spend tons of money trying to fix it up — why not let them stay
for a “reasonable fee?” It may be that the house is in terrible shape, but if it’s
in bad shape now, they probably made it that way, and now that you own it,
do you really trust the residents to not devalue your investment even more?
Remain compassionate, but firm.
Getting Greedy
For some investors, earning a fair profit isn’t good enough. They drum up lies
and deceptions to prevent distressed homeowners from understanding their
rights and fully grasping the options at their disposal. Con artists will even
steal homes from uninformed homeowners by befriending them and convinc-
ing them to sign a quit claim deed relinquishing all their rights to a property
without paying the owners a fair amount.
The minute that you see only $$$$, you’re on the road to failure. Your name
becomes mud, or at least dirty water, and you start losing out on deals. I have
yet to meet someone who has lost in the long run by taking the high road, but
I know of many who’ve lost in the very short run by associating with crooks
or following unethical practices. Be fair, be honest, be brutally honest some
times, negotiate hard, be firm, keep your ultimate goal in mind (profits), but
never compromise yourself for a buck.

Ten Ways to Maximize Future
Leads by Acting with Integrity 
In This Chapter
 Encouraging homeowners to get a handle on their finances
 Convincing the homeowners to seek assistance from family and friends
 Persuading homeowners to contact their lenders
 Hinting at the bankruptcy option
 Suggesting legal options homeowners can explore
T
hroughout the book, I discuss the need to be on the level with homeowners
who are facing foreclosure. Acting with integrity distances you from the
foreclosure predators who take undue advantage of distressed homeowners. 
By remaining on the level, you can gain a competitive edge by building a rep-
utation as the trustworthy go-to guy or gal for homeowners who are facing
foreclosure. In other words, your integrity brings you more leads (which is
the bread and butter and vegetables and meat of real estate investing). 
In this chapter, I offer ten tips to use your integrity to maximize future leads —
ten ways you can assist homeowners even if your assistance results in a
missed opportunity to earn a profit.
Stopping the Bleeding: Providing 
Basic Financial Advice
Unless you’re a certified public accountant or a financial advisor, you can’t
offer homeowners bona-fide financial advice. Many homeowners who are

facing foreclosure, however, could benefit from such advice. They need to
figure out a way to get a handle on their finances, perhaps consolidate their
debt, and commit to an austerity program to avoid overspending. You may
not be qualified to provide such advice, but you can highlight the possible
benefits of a debt counselor or financial advisor:
 Consolidate debts, possibly reducing the total monthly payments.
 Set realistic budget goals and establish a detailed budget.
 Negotiate with lenders to restructure payments or accept short sales.
(For more about negotiating short sales, refer to Chapter 15.)
 Obtain advice on refinancing or selling the property to “get out from
under it.”
Another way to network your way to future investment opportunities is to
establish mutually beneficial relationships with debt counselors and financial
advisors. Just be sure you’re not creating mutually beneficial relationships
that compromise the homeowners’ rights.
Assisting Homeowners 
in Their Job Search
A long-time friend of mine worked in a job placement agency. On a number of
occasions, I found myself dealing with homeowners who had few options,
because they were out of work. I would tell the homeowners, “I have one
more trick up my sleeve. I’ll place a call and see if my friend at the job place-
ment agency can help you. Let me try, and I’ll get back with you.” When I
called my friend, he would ask me what field they were in before they were
fired or laid off, and I would tell him. In almost every case, he was able to find
the homeowners jobs.
If the homeowners need a job, and you know of any openings, give them a
hand. You’ll experience immediate gratification, and your good deed is likely
to reward you somewhere down the line.
Suggesting That the Homeowner Seek
Help from Family and Friends
When you’re trying to acquire a foreclosure property, it may seem counterin-
tuitive to recommend that the homeowners seek assistance from friends and
314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

family members, but this is exactly what you should be doing. I always ask
the question “Do you not want your relative to know?” The answer is almost
always “Yes, we’re embarrassed.” “Well,” I say, “Do you think it will remain a
secret or be any less embarrassing when the bailiff comes to put your stuff
on the curb?” I know that sounds harsh, but it often makes them stop and
really think about it. A number of times this has prompted the homeowners
to call a relative and get the help they needed.
If the homeowners do ask for and receive sufficient assistance to enable them
to dig themselves out of foreclosure, you lose an opportunity to acquire the
property, but you gain a friend for life. Assuming everything works out, the
homeowners will sing your praises and refer you to the people they know
who find themselves in similar predicaments. And even if they don’t, you’ll
sleep better at night knowing you did a good deed.
In many cases, a friend or relative can offer only limited assistance, and the
homeowners still face the inevitability of selling their home. If you’ve been 
on the level with them, they’re more likely to contact you rather than some
other investor when they need to sell.
Encouraging the Homeowners to Contact
Their Lenders . . . and Soon
When homeowners fall behind on their mortgage payments, they’re likely to
go into hiding, avoiding bill collectors, attorneys, and anyone else who’s look-
ing for a payment. They’re taking it one day at a time, hoping to hold on to
their home for as long as possible.
Although this approach is perfectly understandable, denial and avoidance
are the worst actions (or, more appropriately, inactions) homeowners can
take. Inaction almost always leads to the loss of the home and any equity in
it. Encourage homeowners to contact their lenders and other creditors imme-
diately, describe their situation, and explore their options. If the homeowners
refuse to contact their lenders, at least you know that option is off the table,
and you can move on to the next option.
You may be able to act as the mediator between the homeowners and their
lenders, but you’ll need signed permission to do so. For details and a sample
release you can request that the homeowners sign, refer to Chapter 9. Don’t
cross the line of giving advice that you’re not qualified to offer. Tell the home-
owners and repeat it often that you’re not an attorney or an accountant.
315
Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Maximize Future Leads by Acting with Integrity

Suggesting Short Sales and 
Other Debt Negotiations
Anxiety over debt, particularly large mortgage loans, can be so overwhelming
to people that they lose perspective. Sure “it’s only money” to people who
have enough money to pay their bills and to a few slackers out there who don’t
worry about paying their bills, but to responsible homeowners who can’t
afford their monthly mortgage payments, the problem appears insurmount-
able. Many people don’t even realize that lenders and other creditors will
often agree to accept less than full payment on a debt.
Inform the homeowners that creditors often negotiate with people who owe
them money. Describe the situation that the lender is facing — if the lender
forecloses on the property, they may receive no payment whatsoever and
end up having to pay the costs of repairing, renovating, and selling the prop-
erty. The lender is often highly motivated to work with homeowners in these
situations. 
A short sale is not always an attractive option for the lender. Also, you have
to talk to someone who can make the decision. Most people handling the
account for the lender are hourly employees who don’t have the decision-
making power. If the homeowners decide to explore this option, encourage
them to start early — once the bank has decided on a plan of action, getting
them to change course is like trying to stop a fully loaded freighter traveling
at top speed.
Assisting Homeowners in Assessing 
Their Refinance Options
Distressed homeowners often overlook the power of the equity they’ve built
up in their properties over the years. They experience a temporary financial
setback, fall behind on their property tax payments to the tune of a few thou-
sand dollars, and relinquish themselves to losing their home in foreclosure
even though they have tens of thousands of dollars in equity built up in it.
Sit down with the homeowners, as explained in Chapter 9, and calculate the
amount of equity they have built up in the home. They may be able to refi-
nance their loan, consolidate their debts, and establish affordable monthly
payments that get them out of trouble.
316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Refinancing out of foreclosure is not always an option. If the homeowners
have bad credit, no foreseeable increase in income, and cannot refinance with
a loan that provides them with affordable monthly payments, refinancing may
simply put them back on track to facing a future foreclosure situation.
Suggesting the Option of Selling 
the House before Foreclosure
One of the best decisions many distressed homeowners can make is to scale
back — sell their home and buy a more affordable home with lower property
taxes, lower utility bills, and less maintenance. By selling the home, they can
often pull out most, if not all of the equity they have in it, salvage their credit,
and have a chunk of money to use as a down payment on their next home.
Of course, this option isn’t open to everyone. If foreclosure is only a couple
weeks around the corner, and the home is located in an area that has no
redemption period, the homeowners aren’t likely to have sufficient time to
market and sell their home. If the homeowners have plenty of equity in the
home and several months to act, then this option is usually the best option.
I’m a real estate agent, so I can list and sell a home and profit from the trans-
action even if the owners choose not to sell it to me. You may not be in the
same position, but you should always present the homeowners with all of
their options and let them decide what’s best. If you’re a real estate agent,
you need to make sure you disclose this to the homeowner many times, by
card and verbally, even if you represent yourself.
Bringing Up the Bankruptcy Option
I’m not a big fan of filing for bankruptcy, because it’s usually a lose-lose situa-
tion for all involved. Even if the homeowners qualify for bankruptcy, it rarely
erases their credit card debt and simply delays an inevitable foreclosure.
Creditors can simply wait until the bankruptcy stay is lifted and then proceed
with foreclosure.
As a foreclosure investor, however, you should always present bankruptcy as
an option and inform the homeowners that they have a right to seek profes-
sional advice from an attorney. Attempting to discourage a homeowner from
seeking legal counsel is illegal, not to mention just plain wrong. Don’t even
317
Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Maximize Future Leads by Acting with Integrity

try to explain bankruptcy to them, and provide them with the names of several
qualified attorneys, just in case one doesn’t work out and the homeowners
attempt to pin the blame on you.
Offering a Helping Hand
When you’re working with distressed homeowners, think of creative solu-
tions to assist homeowners in digging themselves out of their financial hole. I
once met a homeowner facing foreclosure who was a hard worker — the kind
of guy who always has a little grease under his fingernails, the guy you want
working for you. I referred him to my friend at the job placement office, and
my friend called me later that afternoon. He said, “You know that guy you
sent me?” And I said, “Yeah, what about him?” My friend replied, “He showed
up here in stained overalls and a beat-up ball cap with grease under his fin-
gernails. His resume was on a folded up piece of lined loose leaf paper with
the names and phone numbers of where he worked and descriptions of what
he did at all those places . . . all hand-written, of course.”
“No, I didn’t know that, but it doesn’t surprise me,” I said. 
“Wait a minute,” my friend said, “You sent me over the roughest looking guy
who has ever walked into my office, and you know what . . . he’s absolutely
perfect! I had an employer who just gave me an opening for some sort of spe-
cialty hydraulic work, and this guy has ten-plus years of experience in that
very field. I called the references on that tattered resume, and each and every
one said the same thing — ‘If we I could have kept him on I would have, he’ll
be your top worker — not many like him.’” My friend then went on to say that
the guy was starting his new job the next day. 
Later, I received a call from the homeowner, and he couldn’t thank me
enough. He was sorry that I wasn’t going to make any money, because now
he wouldn’t need my help saving his house, but he was so very thankful.
He said “You just got me a new lease on life. Things are going to be okay.”
And they were. 
I didn’t make money on the deal, but my name was gold to that man, and
when his mother passed away and he wanted to sell her house for cash, who
do you think he called? Well, he didn’t actually call, he came in and saw me.
He said he wouldn’t think of working with anyone else. Win-win? I think if you
look up the definition, this story is right there.
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Revealing the Option to Walk Away
Few lenders will pursue homeowners who simply vacate the premises, but I
would never personally recommend that someone just head out of town
when facing foreclosure. Walking away without a trace usually leaves a trace
on the homeowners’ credit history, which makes obtaining future loans much
more difficult.
A better way to walk away from a property is to either sell it to an investor
who can then deal with the lenders, or offer the lenders a deed in lieu of fore-
closure with the agreement that the foreclosure will not show up on the
homeowner’s credit history, and that the homeowner won’t be responsible
for any deficiency that might arise after the sale of the house. (Some states
allow for deficiency judgments, in which the lender can pursue the home-
owner after the sale for a portion or all of the money the lender lost when the
homeowner defaulted on the loan.) I discuss this option in greater detail in
Chapter 2. Deed in lieu of foreclosure is usually an attractive option only for
homeowners who have negative equity in the property and no investor will-
ing to pay them to move on.
If the homeowners have no or negative equity in their property, crunch the
numbers and see if you can come up with an offer that’s better than the deed
in lieu of foreclosure option. The homeowners can still walk away from the
property, but they walk away with some cash in their pockets, and you end
up with the property — after paying off the senior lien holder, of course.

Foreclosure Minefields 
In This Chapter

I
f foreclosures were risk-free, easy money, everyone with a little cash and
motivation would be buying and selling foreclosures. However, the risks
are very high, and one minor misstep can tip the balance from glowing suc-
cess to financial failure. 
In this chapter, I point out the most serious and common problem areas in an
attempt to steer you clear of buried mines, including get-rich-quick schemes,
misleading information, the natural impulse to let emotions drive decisions,
the common temptation to take advantage of distressed homeowners, and
the disappointment and guilt that often paralyzes even the most empathetic
foreclosure investor.
Steering Clear of Foreclosure 
Investment Scams
Every segment of the real estate market seems to attract con artists. Most 
of these fraudsters are quite intelligent and more than capable to make an
honest living in real estate. In fact, a wide majority of them would make more
money putting their energy, knowledge, and experience into more productive
and honest pursuits. Instead, they prefer to exploit vulnerabilities in the
system and to prey on distressed homeowners.

When you’re first starting out in foreclosure investing, you, too, may be vul-
nerable to the silver-tongued promises of the slick, fast-talking con artist who
promises quick, easy profits. To spot the signs of a typical real estate invest-
ment con artist, check out John T. Reed’s Real Estate Detection B.S. List at
www.johntreed.com/BSchecklist.html.
Researching the Title Yourself
Buying any property, first and foremost, is a legal transaction. To ensure that
everyone involved in the transaction, including the seller, buyer, and lender,
are protected and that the transfer of property from one owner to the next is
legal, county offices record several documents that are publicly accessible,
including the deed, title, mortgage (and note), and city records. 
Before buying a house, have your title company supply you with a title com-
mitment and examine it carefully, so you know what you’re getting yourself
into. See Chapter 8 for details on researching the paperwork.
Inspecting the Property 
with Your Own Eyes
You wouldn’t buy a used car without test-driving it, kicking the wheels, and
taking a peek under the hood. Yet, many novice foreclosure investors do just
that. They walk into a foreclosure auction, plop down tens of thousands of
dollars for a property they’ve never even glanced at, often without knowing
where it’s located. They would probably have a better chance of making a
profit by buying lottery tickets.
As a real estate investor, “my eyes or no buys” should be your credo. Until
you see a property with your own eyes, you don’t know what it is, what kind
of condition it’s in, or the condition of the properties on the same block.
Knowing What You’re Bidding On
Novice investors often purchase “properties” at foreclosure completely
unaware that they just bought a second mortgage for $30,000 that’s almost
guaranteed to be wiped off the books once the first mortgage is foreclosed
on. They buy what almost assuredly will become a worthless piece of paper.
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

When you decide to buy a foreclosure property at an auction, realize that you
may be bidding on any of the following:
 Senior liens (first mortgages)
 Junior liens (second mortgages or other claims against the property)
 Tax liens (for unpaid property taxes)
Prior to an auction, carefully research the title, so you’re aware of all lenders
and other parties that have a claim against the property. That way, you know
whether the lien being auctioned is a senior, junior, or tax lien, and you can
bid accordingly. When you’re first starting out, bid only on senior liens or 
tax liens.
Setting Realistic Goals
I don’t want to be a wet blanket choking out the fire of your enthusiasm, but I
do want to encourage you to start slowly. Set a realistic goal of buying one or
two foreclosure properties in your first year. Next year, you may want to buy
one every quarter. The following year, you may be prepared to buy a prop-
erty once a month or even more frequently if you have a strong support team
and the necessary financial foundation in place.
Do your first foreclosure right — focus on one property from start to finish.
See how it goes, log your mistakes, and then, when you’re ready for your next
property, repeat the process — without the mistakes this time. If a transac-
tion flops, don’t give up. The knowledge you gain in a failed attempt can only
improve your chances of future success.
Muffling Your Emotions
When you’re dealing directly with distressed homeowners, empathy is the
most effective and appropriate response. As a real estate investor, however,
this is business, so avoid becoming too emotionally involved in the process.
The following list provides specific emotional guidelines to follow:
 Avoid emotional connections with distressed homeowners. Desperate
homeowners often take desperate measures to remain in the home,
trying to play your emotions against your business sense. You’ve arrived
to help them out of the hole they’re in, not to have them drag you into
the same hole.
323
Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Avoiding Common Foreclosure Minefields

 Leave your emotions at home when you attend an auction. If your love
for a property or your obsession to outbid the competition leads you to
pay more for a property than it’s worth, you lose.
 Funnel frustration into determination, not anger. You need others to
assist you in gathering the information you need and performing the
work required to turn a profit. Anger only turns the people you need
against you. Every problem has a solution. Solve the problem rather
than blaming others.
 Don’t despair. It is so totally not cool.
Investing with Integrity
Some con artists who call themselves real estate investors seem to believe
that anything they can do to get their grubby little hands on a house is good
business. They justify their immoral and often criminal actions by saying
things like:
“Everybody’s doing it.”
“I didn’t twist anybody’s arm. They could have said ‘No.’”
“If they had paid their mortgage and taxes, they never would have had to
deal with me.”
Admittedly, these statements are all true, but certain actions cross the line
that divides good and bad, ethical and unethical, legal and illegal. Here are
some practices that clearly cross the line:
 Withholding information from the homeowners that could enable them
to sell the house themselves and extract some equity from the property.
 Misleading homeowners into believing that the only option they have is
to sell the property to you. 
 Befriending the homeowners to convince them to sell the property to
you, even when that’s not in their best interest.
 Buying the tax lien and then convincing the homeowners to move out
because you now own the property, even though they could pay the
back taxes and retain possession of the home.
 In a state that has a redemption period, buying the property at auction
and then informing the homeowners that you bought the property and
they need to move out immediately without informing them of their
redemption rights and the amount of time they have to redeem the 
property.
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Cheating the homeowner out of overbid money. An overbid occurs when
an investor pays more for the property at auction than what is owed on
the property. The overbid amount is used to pay off junior lien holders
first, and then any remaining money belongs to the homeowners. Con
artists often try to charge the homeowners, sometimes 50 percent to
help them claim the overbid money. Other con artists simply take it all.
If you feel that what you’re saying to homeowners is not in their best inter-
ests, then you’re probably doing something wrong. Of course, you want to
make a profit, so what’s in your best interest counts, too, but not to the point
of misrepresenting the facts.
Anticipating Delays
Many of the most experienced and successful real estate investors refuse to
deal with foreclosures, because foreclosures can be so messy and drawn out.
In a way, that’s good for you — less competition from the high rollers — but
you have to prepare yourself for the messiness. 
Because the successful foreclosure buyer must be patient, you have to calcu-
late delays into your formula. Realize that any of the following delays often
result in your having to wait before you realize your profit:
 Homeowners taking their sweet time to make a decision
 Courts or trustees taking their sweet time to resolve the issue
 Homeowners changing their minds at the last minute
 Redemption periods that can last from several months to a year
Don’t count on quick-cash deals when you’re investing in foreclosures. If
you’re investing part time, keep your day job. You need steady income, so
you can afford to be patient. If you need the profit from a foreclosure prop-
erty to pay the bills, the stress of waiting may be enough to convince you
that investing in foreclosures isn’t exactly the best option for you.
Foreseeing Unforeseen Expenses
Investing in real estate is not rocket science. You can’t calculate to the penny
how much a property is going to cost, because of all the variables involved.
Although you can’t completely prevent unforeseen expenses from sinking
325
Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Avoiding Common Foreclosure Minefields

your budget, you can reduce the risk by creating a buffer and at least consid-
ering the following expenses:
 Purchase price is something you control, so set the price with the goal
of making a 20 percent or better profit.
 Repair and renovation expenses.
 Holding costs include stuff like property taxes, interest on loans, insur-
ance, and utilities for the duration of the project — the redemption
period (if applicable in your area), time to repair and renovate the 
property, and time to sell it.
 Real estate commissions, if you hire an agent to sell the property.
 Transfer tax is sort of like sales tax, which varies from one locale to
another.
 Research fees for the title work and any other documents you need.
 Recording fees, particularly at closing.
 Miscellaneous expenses, including mileage and phone calls.
Underestimate your profit, overestimate your expenses. See Chapter 10 for
guidelines on how much you can afford to pay for a property to be fairly cer-
tain of a profitable investment.
Dealing with the Blame and Guilt
In some people’s eyes, foreclosure investors are the scum of the earth, steal-
ing homes from poor, unfortunate homeowners and old ladies. As a foreclo-
sure investor, you’d better be able to deal with the contempt you’re about to
face. Many real estate investors simply can’t handle it, and they look for the
exits after investing in only one or two properties.
To steel yourself from the disdain you’re likely to face, keep in mind that you
didn’t cause the predicament the current homeowners are in. They’re in this
predicament either due to their own foibles or some unforeseen, financially
stressful event that’s outside their control. You’ve arrived on the accident
scene with a possible solution to their current problem.

Appendix
Foreclosure Rules and
Regulations for the 50 States
W
hen you’re playing the foreclosure investing game, you need to play
by the rules. Here I provide you with the rules and regulations govern-
ing foreclosure in each of the 50 United States as well as the District of
Columbia, and I offer some additional research resources where you can
obtain more detailed information.
For each state, we provided contact information for the Realtor in the state
who contributed the foreclosure information. To locate other qualified
Realtors, visit www.realtor.com, where you can search for a Realtor by 
city and state.
To decipher this information, keep the following definitions in mind:
 Deed type: Deed of trust, mortgage deed, or both. A deed of trust is a
mortgage contract that places control of the deed in the hands of a third
party — a trustee. The trustee has the power to foreclose on the prop-
erty in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan. A mortgage deed
is a contract between the lender and borrower that gives the lender the
right to foreclose on the property in the event that the borrower defaults
on the loan.
 Foreclosure process: Judicial, nonjudicial, or both. A judicial foreclosure
process is followed when no power of sale is provided in the mortgage
or deed of trust; lenders must file a lawsuit to obtain a court order to
foreclose on a property. A nonjudicial foreclosure process occurs when 
a power-of-sale is pre-authorized in the mortgage or deed of trust, in
which case, the lender is given the right to foreclose on the property
and sell it to pay off the balance of the loan in the event that the bor-
rower defaults on the loan. 
 Process period: This is the average amount of time that the foreclosure
process takes from the time a foreclosure notice or notice of default is
presented until the time that possession is transferred to the new owner.

 Notice of default: A notice that some states require be sent to home-
owners notifying them that they have failed to fulfill their payment oblig-
ations as borrowers. Here, I specify whether a notice of default is
required by the state.
 Notice of sale: An official announcement that specifies the time, place,
and terms of a foreclosure sale and typically includes a description of
the property, the names of the mortgagor and mortgagee, and other
information. In most states such a notice must be published and posted
in a public location and sometimes at the property for several weeks
prior to the sale.
 Redemption period: Most states have a mandatory redemption period
after the sale, during which time the foreclosed upon homeowners have
a right to redeem their property by paying off the loan along with any
interest and penalties. Here, I specify whether the state has a mandatory
redemption period, and if it does, the length of that redemption period.
The information provided here offers a general overview of the rules and reg-
ulations governing foreclosure in each state. These rules and regulations may
vary from one county to another, so consult your real estate attorney and the
county clerk or register of deeds for additional details and clarification.
