About the Authors
Christopher Hodapp is a 32° Freemason and a member of the Masonic order
of the Knights Templar. His first book, Freemasons For Dummies, has quickly
become the most popular modern guide to the ancient and accepted frater-
nity of Freemasonry. He’s also the author of Solomon’s Builders: Freemasons,
Founding Fathers and the Secrets of Washington D.C., and co-author of The
Templar Code For Dummies. He attended Indiana University, the University of
Southern California, Los Angeles Valley Community College, and California
State University Northridge. In 2006, Chris received the Duane E. Anderson
Excellence in Masonic Education Award from the Grand Lodge of Minnesota.
He has written for Templar History Magazine, Masonic Magazine, The Scottish
Rite Journal, The Indiana Freemason, and Indianapolis Monthly, and he’s a
monthly columnist for Living Naturally First magazine. Chris has also spent
more than 20 years as a commercial filmmaker.
Alice Von Kannon has been an advertising executive, a teacher, a writer, 
and even a greedy and villainous landlord. A history junkie beyond the 
help of an intervention since the age of 14, her studies of Near Eastern reli-
gious cults and sects led to her first book, The Templar Code For Dummies,
co-written with Chris Hodapp. She’s studied film production at Los Angeles
Valley Community College and history at California State University
Northridge, and she’s worked for many years in advertising as a writer and
broadcast producer. Alice has traveled widely in Europe and the Middle East
and written on the subject of the Barbary Wars and the birth of the U.S. Navy.
She’s a member of Romance Writers of America and the Order of the Grail,
the fraternal body of the International College of Esoteric Studies.
Both authors live in Indianapolis, Indiana.

To Norma for her boundless help, support, confidence, and love.
To Charlie who was at Roswell before the aliens took over.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Our deepest appreciation goes to the many friends and authors who
unselfishly shared their knowledge with us.

tance; and to Trevor McKeown and others who make the vast Web site of the
Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon such an invaluable resource.
To Nathan Brindle, Jim Dillman, Jeffrey Naylor, Eric Schmitz, R.J. Hayes,
Stephen Dafoe, and all the “Knights of the North” for their constant support
and input, and to Phillip A. Garver for his incredible knowledge of
Gnosticism, Martinism, Catharism, and all things esoteric.
To Tom Atkins for making the Federal Reserve seem like a simple concept to
understand. To Dr. William Moore for pointing us in directions we may not
have otherwise looked; and to Mark Tabbert for pointing us at William. To
Dave Pruett who graciously (and bravely) acted as the Technical Editor of
this volume. To Carolyn Steele and Rex DeLawter for caring for our business
when we weren’t able to be there.

book, and those that preceded it, through a long and sometimes tortured
route to completion; to our patient and eternally unflappable editor Natalie
Harris; to Carrie Burchfield for helping us cram a 500-page book into 348

Introduction
N
apoleon said, “What is history but a fable agreed upon?” Of course,
what nobody seems to remember is that Napoleon said a whole bunch
of really questionable things. What’s wrong with it is that it implies that his-
tory is just a matter of opinion.
Entering the world of conspiracy theories and secret societies is like stepping
into another dimension — a distant, parallel, alternate universe where the
images, words, and names that surround you are vaguely familiar, but where
the laws of physics have completely changed: Black means white; up is down;
do-gooders are really Beelzebub’s Satanic waterboys; and the world seems to
be viewed through a giant funhouse mirror.
We stepped into this alternate universe while Chris was working on
Freemasons For Dummies (Wiley). In the alternate universe of conspiracy 
theories, the fraternity that he wrote about bore no resemblance whatsoever
to the version found in stacks of conspiracy books and endless Internet 
information of anti-Masonic accusations.
Our exploration of the world of conspiracies and secret societies after 
working on the book about Freemasons led to extended discussions with
Wiley’s For Dummies folks, and the proposal for this book grew and grew 
as our research became more extensive.
Researching a book about conspiracy theories and secret societies is a frus-
trating experience, most notably because it’s all supposed to be a secret. But
it’s a balancing act, as well. Too little skepticism risks falling down Lewis
Carroll’s rabbit hole into a twisted wonderland of circular logic, but too much
skepticism risks overlooking something critical that may become tomorrow’s
tragic headline. We talk a lot in this book about secretive and suspicious
groups that are at the center of conspiracy theories around the world, but we
also let you know what you can do to spot truly malevolent secret societies
and tell the real conspiracies from the fakes.

About This Book
For the millions of people who are true believers in their own favorite con-
spiracy theories, the type of information we cover in this book is all very
important. Of course we feel that the material is important, but you don’t
have to read it in order. This book is intended to be a reference for you, so
you don’t need to read the chapters in order from front cover to back (even
though we suggest it). So if you want to read about all the secret societies
before you read about the conspiracy theories, or vice versa, that’s fine with
us. It’s all interesting stuff!
Moreover, just because you may not believe the overwhelming majority of
the conspiracies cited in this book, it doesn’t make them all wrong. There
have been real conspiracies in the world, as well as real secret societies that
were seeking to accomplish real evil. Or amass power. Or money. Or both. 
We try to separate fluff, fear, and fantasy from the facts, and we endeavor to
present them with a minimum of personal commentary so you can decide 
for yourself.
But there’s a much more vital reason we’ve come to feel this book is impor-
tant, and it’s not because we believe the world is about to end in an ultimate
showdown between the forces of Good and Evil. No, it’s a lot simpler than
that. It’s a question of what can happen when the lit match of a fiery, profes-
sional conspiracist touches off the powder keg of a susceptible believer.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book is unconventional in a whole lot of ways, but we do follow a few
rules:
 We italicize new terms, closely followed by an easy-to-understand 
definition. You also see names secret societies in italics.
 We bold important keywords in bulleted lists as well as the action 
parts of numbered lists.
 We use monofont for all Web addresses.

What You’re Not To Read
This is a reference book, which means no one is going to whack your hands
with a ruler if they catch you skipping ahead. In particular, anything marked
with a Technical Stuff icon (more about those below) may make your eyes
glaze over from information overload. Not that it isn’t interesting, but feel
free to skip ahead if you find yourself getting woozy.
Foolish Assumptions
We don’t know most of you, but we make a few assumptions about you and
why you picked up this book:
 You’re confused and want the unvarnished scoop on secret societies
and conspiracy theories. You’ve watched the History Channel documen-
taries on codes, conspiracies, and secret societies until your eyes have
swollen shut. This book puts it all together for you. It gives you the tools
to tell the difference between the big players, the small fries, the truly
scary stuff, and the piles of pernicious piffle.
 You’re a complete skeptic. All the rumors about the Illuminati, UFOs,
and underground government bunkers beneath the Denver Airport
strike you as balderdash from a weak X-Files episode. We separate fact
from fiction and let you know when to really put on your tinfoil helmet.
 You’re a true believer. You just know that at any minute black heli-
copters are going to land on your lawn and the Men In Black will bash
down your door. We’re here to help you sort through all the conspira-
cies. We’ll help you come to grips with what’s real, what’s made up, who
made it up, and why.
 You’re a member of what the rest of the world calls a “secret society”
and you want to know why everyone is talking behind your back.
Does everybody shut up when you walk into the room? Is your daughter
asking why people on the Internet claim you’re the spawn of Satan. We
examine the origins of secret societies and the more benign groups that
have become the major suspects in the New World Order.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
If you just plowed in here without bothering to look at the neatly organized
Table of Contents, we don’t mind. We prefer you to start at the top, but we
won’t call out the black helicopter guys if you don’t. We’re about to tell you
all the important stuff about the way this book is laid out. It’s chopped up
into four neatly packaged parts, and you can read them in any order.
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret
Societies: The Improbable Wedded 
to the Inscrutable
About 99.9 percent of all respectable conspiracy theories are tied hand and
foot to some sort of secret society or organization. This part lays out easy-to-
understand models, with no cryptic double talk about all the “theys” out
there, and all the dark conspiracies behind them. Chapter 1 is an overview of
the world of conspiracies and secret societies, while Chapters 2 and 3 get
down to the nuts and bolts of defining and identifying them.
Part II: A Colossal Compilation 
of Conspiracy Theories
This part covers the best and the brightest in terms of conspiracy theories —
from the sublime to the ridiculous. Chapter 4 discusses some of the most
common theories, the conspiracies so secret that everybody knows about
them. Chapter 5 is the hit parade of, well, hits — conspiracies related to
famous assassinations. Chapter 6 covers the range of race, genocide, and
apocalyptic doom, just to bring a little cheerlessness to your humdrum life.
Chapter 7 covers conspiracies not of this Earth — from Roswell to the 
Moon-landing hoaxes. And finally, Chapter 8 covers the unsettling growth 
of the ever-wilder 9/11 conspiracies.

Conspiracy Theories & Secret Societies For Dummies 

Part III: Secret Societies and 
Societies with Secrets
You can’t tell the players without a program. This part exposes the major
secret societies of the last century and a half — the ones that still haunt
every conspiracist cubbyhole in the bookstore and on the Internet. Chapter 9
discusses the Freemasons, the world’s least kept secret society, and Chapter
10 ventures into the world of Rosicrucian and occult groups, while Chapter
11 explores the origin and modern incarnations of the Illuminati. Chapter 12
delves into the tales of secret societies of assassins like the, well, Assassins,
along with the Invisible Empire, the Ku Klux Klan, and other hate groups. In
Chapter 13 you find a gallery of both frivolous and frightening secret soci-
eties, from the golden age of fraternalism and college groups, to a lineup of
military and revolutionary cabals. And Chapter 14 rounds out the list with
the criminal underground and the godfather of all secret societies, the Mafia.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
A For Dummies book wouldn’t feel right without the Part of Tens — chapters
divided into quaint lists of ten items of importance. In this part, we serve you
ten conspiracy theories that skirted the edge of madness; ten conspiracy 
theories that really turned out to be true; ten secret societies with the goofi-
est names; and ten of the drop-dead weirdest secret societies of all time.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you spot certain icons hanging around in the margins.
They’re there to help you navigate the conspiracies, conspiracists, and 
conspiratorial plots.
This icon indicates little-known or “unusual” information or facts that were
originally kept secret. Consider the info in these icons to come from a leg-
endary group or inner circle of an all-seeing, all-knowing Master within any
number of secret societies. Think of him as the Mister Know It All on all
things secret or conspiratorial.
This icon marks key points that are vital to understanding truly important
topics. Don’t skip them!
5
Introduction

This icon highlights stuff like additional data or side trips with more detail
than you may be interested in. They can be ruthlessly skipped without miss-
ing the really important topics of the chapters.
This icon gives you handy tidbits and helpful advice.
This book stinks with conspiracies. It’s loaded with them. They’re all over 
the place. This icon points out the ones that are the bedrock of conspiracy
thinking — either the most important allegations, the best known, or in 
some cases, the most ridiculous.
Where to Go from Here
The best part of a For Dummies book is that you can start at page 1, or 
you can go all the way to the Part of Tens and read the book backwards. So,
start with any chapter you want. Each chapter and section is pretty much
self-contained, and if we think there’s stuff you should’ve read about in order,
we warn you and cross-reference other chapters as those instances pop up.
A For Dummies book isn’t supposed to be the last book you pick up on a 
subject — it should be the first. But we hope that what you ultimately say
about this book is that we’ve lifted the veil on topics you may have only
vaguely heard of and presented you with enough facts to make up your own
mind, or to study further. Or to just creep out your relatives.

In this part . . .
A
bout 99.9 percent of all respectable conspiracy 
theories are tied hand and foot to some sort of secret
society or organization. This secret society or organization
is the they, as in “they hid the wrecked alien spacecraft in
Roswell in 1947.” This section lays out easy-to-understand
models, with no cryptic double talk, about all the “theys”
out there, and all the dark conspiracies behind them.

Chapter 1
Everything You Know Is Wrong
In This Chapter
 Believing the unbelievable: The age of conspiracy theories and secret societies
 Figuring out what’s worth believing
 Touring the world, one conspiracy at a time
Journalist H. L. Mencken once said, “The most costly of all follies is to
believe passionately in the palpably not true. It is the chief occupation of
mankind.”
A conspiracy theory is the idea that someone, or a group of someones, acts
secretly, with the goal of achieving power, wealth, influence, or other benefit.
It can be as small as two petty thugs conspiring to stickup a liquor store, or
as big as a group of revolutionaries conspiring to take over their country’s
government. Individuals, corporations, churches, politicians, military leaders,
and entire governments can all be conspirators, in plots as evil as secretly
developing nuclear weapons, as creepy as smuggling stolen human transplant
organs, or as annoying as cornering the market on neighborhood $4-coffee
joints.
The conspiracy theory is absolutely inseparable from the secret society.
They go together like Minneapolis and St. Paul. Face it: Everyone hates
secrets. You didn’t like it when the kids kept secrets from you in gym class,
and you’ve never gotten over it. Neither have we.
Secret societies are the repositories of the hidden knowledge that spins the
conspiracy theory. But the term secret society covers a lot of ground — every-
thing from college fraternities and the lodge your grandpa belonged to, to the
lesser known, powerful groups that stay out of the eyes of the press, like the
Bilderbergers, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the legendary Illuminati
(if they really exist at all).
This chapter begins the process of teaching you how to tell the truth from the
manure, at least where conspiracy theories and secret societies are concerned.
Throughout this book, we also set out to simplify what at least sounds stag-
geringly confusing. We clarify conspiracy theories that are coming at you
from all sides nowadays on everything from the Mafia running the Vatican to

aliens landing in New Mexico (or is it the aliens in the Vatican and the Mafia
in New Jersey?). Consider this chapter your warm-up exercise!
Living in the Age of Conspiracy Theories
and Secret Societies
The popularity of the conspiracy theory as a way of explaining society and
world events is a pretty recent phenomena, a product of the time since the
French Revolution of 1789, which was the first real marriage of paranoia and
the printing press. But it’s just within the last 40 years that the philosophy of
conspiracism has become like a wall of noise, an assault on the collective
consciousness, and the most common way to explain complex world events.
In many respects, conspiracies are a way of simplifying history into good and
bad, right and wrong.
A conspiracy theory is a way of looking at a single event and postulating that
maybe there’s a lot more to it than can be seen on the surface, with darker
forces behind the whole thing. Conspiracism expands on this, becoming an
entire philosophy, as a way of viewing the world. For the professional conspir-
acist, a person who studies the conspiracies, there isn’t much going on in the
world that doesn’t have darker forces behind it, from the price of a gallon of
gasoline to the three ounces of hand lotion you can’t ever seem to extract
from the bottom of a 16-ounce bottle. Of course, in a way, even the term con-
spiracism is too respectable to apply to much of what is floating around the
Internet and the tabloids these days. Since the middle of the last century, aca-
demic, postmodernist researchers have found it fashionable to refer to all
psychological states and moods in German. It’s a Sigmund Freud thing.
Author Thom Burnett in the Conspiracy Encyclopedia (2005, Chamberlain
Bros.) points out that the Germans have a great term, Verschworungsmythos,
which means Conspiracy Myth, and in many ways, it has lots to recommend it
as a descriptive label.
“Perhaps the conspiracy world is an updated version of ancient myths,”
Burnett says, “where monsters and the gods of Olympus and Valhalla have
been replaced by aliens and the Illuminati of Washington and Buckingham
Palace.” In other words, the new wave of jitters over conspiracies and secret
societies has beaten up the zeitgeist with their weltschmerz over weltpolitik
(the spirit of our times has had the crap kicked out of it by anxiety over
global domination). See, we can do the German thing too. Gesundheit.
What makes the study of conspiracy theories and secret societies unusual is,
when boiled down to their most common elements, the overwhelming major-
ity have grown or been adapted from the same few original sources. Historian
Daniel Pipes has said that almost all conspiracy theories have as their origin
the same two boogeymen — Jews and secret societies, most notably the
10
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies

Freemasons. They have simply been recycled and renamed, again and again,
as events have transpired over the last 250 years.
For example, if you take almost any conspiracy about the Jews from the 19th
century, and erase “Jews” and substitute “military-industrial complex” or
“neocons,” you find that very same theory in dozens of books and on hun-
dreds of Web sites about the sinister forces behind the 9/11 “conspiracy.” In
many ways, it shows a criminal lack of originality. On the other hand, conspir-
acists would claim, plots around the world and the evildoers who engage in
them haven’t changed much over the centuries. They’ve only gotten more
ambitious.
What’s Worth Scrutinizing, 
and What’s Not
Between books, the Internet, and cable television, the average American comes
into contact with a lot of ideas that are no longer sifted through “established
media.” A bigger and bigger chunk of these ideas challenges the status quo —
the beliefs of stodgy academics and of society in general. Such thoughts also
assert that organizations, from the government to the Illuminati (see Chapter
11), are in cahoots to make sure that no one yet knows the truth. But just
because an appealing idea comes from the “alternative’ media instead of the
mouths of TV anchors or White House spokesmen doesn’t always make it true.
As professional conspiracists write book after book, raking in the money
faster than they can count it, most care very little about the confusion and
fear they leave behind. Internet Web-meisters who peddle this stuff care even
less. But we care about it, a lot. Don’t fear — you can acquire the skills you
need to digest it all and discern the information. In Chapter 2, in particular,
we help you decide between information that’s worth paying attention to and
information you should ignore, and why.
Connecting the dots
There’s a very important point about exploring conspiracy theories. It is not
enough to just lay out facts or events, like dots on a page, and scream “aha!” at
the mere “fact,” for example, that over 100 people “involved” in the assassina-
tion of John F. Kennedy are dead. “Involved” often meaning as little as they
were standing in the crowd in Dallas. It’s been almost 40 years, and of the thou-
sands of people peripherally involved in the case, it’s not a big shock for more
than 100 of them to have died. Now, if 75 of them had been wrapped in plastic
and duct tape and dumped into a Dallas reservoir, you might have something.
11
Chapter 1: Everything You Know Is Wrong

The point we are making is that a box full of random dots is meaningless. To
be a true theory worth considering, the dots have to be connected. And to be
taken seriously, a conspiracy theory has to connect those dots convincingly
and with some irrefutable proof.
Benjamin Franklin once said, “Three may keep a secret when two are dead.”
When you’re confronted by a conspiracy that requires the military or the gov-
ernment or literally thousands of covert insiders around the world to keep a
Very Big Secret for tens, or hundreds, of years, and just one lone “coura-
geous” warrior steps forward with an outlandish tale that no one else backs
up, it’s time to turn on your alarm system again. Courage could be vanity, and
honesty merely accusation or sour grapes or revenge.
12
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies
What is proof?
Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14,
1865. Since about 24 hours afterwards, the
world has been trying to find out the details
about the conspiracy behind it. (And there was
a conspiracy — for more on that, see Chapter
5.) Interest in the plot has come and gone over
the years, most recently in the 2007 film
National Treasure II: The Book of Secrets,
which prominently featured the discovery of the
missing pages of assassin John Wilkes Booth’s
diary. And there really are missing pages — his-
torians just aren’t sure why.
One of the hundreds of books we consulted
during this project was a bit nostalgic —The
Lincoln Conspiracy (Schick Sun Classic Books)
by David Balsiger and Charles E. Sellier. (This
book was parent to the Sunn Classics film of the
same name that did remarkably well in theaters
in 1977.)
Like most conspiracy books, The Lincoln
Conspiracy has many footnotes and an impres-
sively long bibliography. But, also like most con-
spiracy literature, it’s a circular citing process,
with conspiracists endlessly referring to one
another’s work (see Chapter 2 for more on this
phenomenon). Despite their abundant cribbing
from an earlier conspiracist work from the 1930s
by an Austrian chemist named Otto Eisenschiml,
the authors claimed to be the only investigators
in history who’d ever gotten the story of
Lincoln’s assassination right. They also seemed
to have connected with an amazing number of
documents to back up their version of events,
papers, and diaries that had slipped past mere
mortal historians.
The book’s opening pages were touting these
various miraculous discoveries, as well as the
severe scientific methodology they had put to
use in their quest. They claimed this was espe-
cially true of their discovery of the missing
pages of Booth’s diary, a set of documents
“worth up to $1 million dollars.” Wow! But when
you read on carefully, you come across the fol-
lowing astonishing statement:
The authors acquired a full transcript of the
contents of the missing pages and had the
contents evaluated by historical experts,
but have not been able to acquire copies 
of the actual pages to authenticate the
handwriting.
What these guys are saying is that they haven’t
even seen copies of the actual “million dollar”
diary pages on which they’ve built just about the
entire thesis of their book. It is this typical ama-
teur detective work, backed up with hearsay,
innuendo, and rumor that makes so many con-
spiracists so hard to take seriously.

Being skeptical about speculative thinking
Most theories, from the Kennedy assassination to Jesus-having-a-wife books,
share the title of “alternative” histories, or “speculative” works. The word
speculative is the key point here. Because once people start speculating, it
becomes your job, to a great degree, to speculate, as well.
For example, in the mental gymnastics of the folks who love to tell you that
ancient space aliens were responsible for the Egyptian Sphinx, or that the huge
carvings called the Nazca Lines in Peru had to have been done by someone
able to fly over the countryside, there’s just a wisp of contempt for that most
amazing of all tools, the human mind. There’s an attitude that ancient man
was just too, well, primitive (for primitive, read stupid) to have been able to
build something on that scale.
The same sort of “speculative” thinking goes into more modern creations,
like crop circles (see Chapter 7). Admittedly, many crop circles are astonish-
ing as well as dramatic. But are they the watermarks of alien spaceships or
superior extraterrestrial technology? All that’s required to make a crop circle
is a two-by-four and a rudimentary understanding of mathematics and geom-
etry. Just as we were writing this chapter, a “crop circle” was discovered in
New Jersey in the shape of a swastika. Somehow we doubt it was a message
left to us from visitors from Alpha Centauri.
The Conspiracism World Tour
Where conspiracy theories are concerned, there’s nothing particularly weird
about our own time when you take a look back at history. Consider, for example,
these items from the early years of U.S. history:
 George Washington, a Freemason, was edgy about the possible infiltration
of the Illuminati (see Chapter 11) during his presidency.
 Many people believed Thomas Jefferson was secretly a member of the
Illuminati.
 After killing former Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton in a
duel, Vice President Aaron Burr really did hatch a conspiracy to wrestle
control of the western territories away from the U.S. so he could be king
of a new empire in the West (see Chapter 17).
 Economists and people nervous about financial dealings on a global
scale have been shoveling grim and prophetic jeremiads about the pri-
vately owned Federal Reserve Bank, since its very creation, as being a
hotbed of chicanery controlled by capitalist titans.
 The assassination of Abraham Lincoln (Chapter 5) resulted in a nationwide
search for conspirators, both real and imagined, a lot of whom were
hanged.
13
Chapter 1: Everything You Know Is Wrong

But, while there have been conspiracists throughout history, the 20th century
seems to have been the biggest incubator for them. As we show you in the
next sections, the 20th century was a particularly intense period that led to
clammy hands over secret societies, coverups, and intrigues.
The birth of 20th-century 
U.S. conspiracism
During World War II, the U.S. government routinely hid secret missions and
programs (along with military failures) as part of the war effort. It was vital to
keep the national mood focused on winning. And the general belief of Americans
was that government secrecy was a good thing: “Loose lips sink ships.” Secrecy
was patriotic. The government and the military were supposed to be keeping
secrets.
After the war, the U.S. engaged in a nuclear stare-down with the Soviets, who
were devouring countries all over Eastern Europe and had sworn to get around
to us eventually. The stakes were very high.
Most Americans don’t know how close the U.S. came to getting nuked by the
Axis powers during WWII, when a sub with a dirty nuclear bomb, a joint
German-Japanese endeavor, was literally on its way to San Francisco when
the war ended. Then, less than five years after the explosion of the atomic
bombs over Japan, Soviet scientists had their own full-blown nuclear bombs,
and much of the technology had been stolen from U.S. laboratories and
developed in Russia by former Nazi scientists.
While the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and
the bombastic Senator Joe McCarthy made headlines in the 1950s peering
under the sheets for Commies in Hollywood, ferreting out the deep political
thoughts of Gary Cooper, the truth was that there really were Communist
agents across the United States, funding subversive anti-American groups,
spying on military and scientific installations, and infiltrating U.S. intelligence
organizations like the CIA.
The Communist Party of the United States was no independent organization
of starry-eyed idealists. By the 1970s they were receiving $3 million a year from
the Soviet Union and had aided the Soviet Secret Police (KGB) throughout the
1940s and ’50s in recruiting spies.
High-profile spying trials, such as the trials of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and
Alger Hiss (who were, in spite of claims to the contrary, all guilty of Soviet
espionage), kept Americans looking outward for conspiracies. But that was about
to change, drastically, and the threat to our way of life suddenly seemed to be
from within.

Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies

The psychedelic ’70s: Conspiracism peaks
To understand the explosion of conspiracism that has happened over the last
four decades, you need to understand just a little of why the 1970s were the
turning point.
While famous conspiracies were alleged in the deaths of Marilyn Monroe and
John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s, most sociologists hang the modern
growth and acceptance of conspiracy theories on the Vietnam War era and
the Watergate-related events under President Richard Nixon. The government
was starting to get caught engaging in old-fashioned, WWII-type secrecy to
cover up military blunders in Cuba under President Kennedy and in Vietnam
under President Lyndon Johnson.
Distrust peaked during the second term of Richard Nixon, stoked by his own
infamous antagonism over the press and what he regarded as “subversive
elements.”
The Pentagon Papers
In 1971, The New York Times published a stack of reports leaked from the
Defense Department, famously known as The Pentagon Papers. The top-secret
reports were written in 1967 and outlined how the Johnson administration
secretly expanded the Vietnam War, while lying to the public and pretending
to seek strategic advice from diplomats, as well as engaging in “false flag”
operations — staged raids supposedly from the Viet Cong.
The revelations came three years after Johnson had left office, but they
helped turn the tide of public opinion against the war. This bitterness only
worsened under his successor, Richard Nixon.
15
Chapter 1: Everything You Know Is Wrong
JFK on secrecy
One of the most commonly printed quotes about
secrecy and secret societies in the U.S. was
made by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. It is
frequently used by conspiracists to show that
Americans distrust secret societies:
The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a
free and open society; and we are as a
people inherently and historically opposed
to secret societies, to secret oaths and to
secret proceedings.
Of course, like any sound bite, the part that gets
left out is that Kennedy was actually giving a
Cold War–era speech in favor of secrecy. He
was asking a ballroom filled with newspaper
publishers to keep their mouths shut about U.S.
government activities and to not print anything
in their papers that might give “our enemies” an
advantage. On the one hand, he blasted the
Soviet Union for controlling its press with an
iron hand. On the other hand, he sounded pretty
envious of their power to do it.

In search of . . . conspiracies
After the Watergate scandals erupted in 1973, the general consensus of a
once-trusting American public changed, drastically. The nation had seen their
president spying on the opposition party and lying about it, and the military
engaging in maneuvering war to their own ends. The vice president and the
attorney general had been proven to be liars and crooks. The Vietnam War
limped to an end, and U.S. troops were pulled out without achieving victory —
the first loss of a war in American history. Suddenly, and sadly, the Leave It To
Beaver TV universe of only 15 years before seemed absurd to a newly cynical
nation.
Influenced by this almost universal sense of suspicion, the 1970s saw an
explosion of books, movies, and TV shows about conspiracies. The first
books about the purported UFO crash at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1946
appeared in the mid-1970s (see Chapter 7), 30 years after the fact. The film-
makers at Sunn Classic Pictures were raking it in with over a dozen conspir-
acist films in that decade.
Even television got into the act, and the series In Search Of . . . covered simi-
lar topics, narrated by the most trusted, logical, and world-famous scientist
of our time, Star Trek’s Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy). It was the generation that
grew up with these influences that went on to create shows like The X-Files in
the 1990s and to fashion for conspiracism an aura of brave and indefatigable
truth in the face of powerful, dangerous enemies.
16
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies
None dare call it conspiracy
Gary Allen and Larry Abraham’s 1971 book,
None Dare Call It Conspiracy, was a watermark
for conspiracy “literature.” Closely associated
with the right-wing John Birch Society, they
trace world events, from the Russian Revolution
up through the Nixon administration and purport
that history has been controlled by an elite
cabal of international bankers.
This was the book that put the Council on
Foreign Relations and the Bilderbergers on the
conspiracists’ map (see Chapter 15). All the sus-
pects that have dominated the genre ever since
were collected in this book — the Illuminati, the
Freemasons, Jewish bankers, Cecil Rhodes, and
the Rockefellers. It also raises the alarm over the
printing of worthless paper money, fears over
gun control, and puppet presidential candidates
who are the willing stooges of the New World
Order regardless of party affiliation.

Conspiracy theories aren’t limited 
to the USA!
America doesn’t have the corner on the paranoia market when it comes to
distrust of secret groups and the creation of conspiracy theories. Take a taste
off the international menu:
 Canada has its own Roswell (see Chapter 7), called Shag Harbor.
 Israel has its own Kennedy assassination (see Chapter 5) in the killing of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
 The British believe that everyone from Princess Diana to UN weapons
inspector David Kelly was murdered by the government.
 The Italians have their own Bilderbergers (see Chapter 15) in their Club
of Rome.
 The French believe that the Freemasons (see Chapter 9) are behind
everything.
 Throughout Central Asia and in parts of South America it is commonly
believed that children are stolen from orphanages to harvest their internal
organs for sale to the highest bidders in a bizarre medical “black market.”
Variations of the tale in India claim “thousands” of stolen human kidneys
are shipped each year to rich patients in the Middle East.
 In some Islamic nations, conspiracy theories about Jews poisoning kids’
bubble gum or tainting vaccines get printed on the front page of major
metropolitan newspapers (see Chapter 6).
Such nervousness does seem to flourish best in democracies and free societies.
Tyrants, fascist dictatorships, and totalitarian regimes lock down all information
sources because they really are controlled by internal conspiracies and secret
government agencies.
Writer Christopher Hitchens calls conspiracy theories “the exhaust fumes of
democracy,” and that’s as good a phrase as any. It’s the bad part of the free
use of information, and that’s the abuse of information.
A Word About Skepticism
There’s an old bit of bumper sticker philosophy that says “just because you’re
paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you.” In a post-9/11 world,
conspiracies don’t seem to be so far-fetched anymore. This real-life conspiracy
played itself out on our TV screens. The result was the death of thousands of
17
Chapter 1: Everything You Know Is Wrong

innocent civilians, and in the aftermath, everyone saw terrorist madman
Osama Bin Laden take credit for it and the evidence unfold of the planning by
his suicidal henchmen.
Then the conspiracy theorists stepped in and told everyone not to believe
the evidence or common sense. The 9/11 conspiracy books started to come
out, and dark hints of conspiracy showed up on various TV and radio com-
mentaries. Somehow, right under our noses, the entire tone of the debate had
changed.
In the world of the conspiracy theorist, loose bands of like-minded terrorists
like Al-Qaeda can’t possibly be smart enough, rich enough, devious enough,
organized enough, or big enough to pull off such an attack, right? Besides,
who’s Al-Qaeda, anyway? No one had ever heard of them.
Many people thought someone else must be behind the 9/11 attacks, someone
in the wings, someone bigger, someone pulling the strings as part of a vast,
worldwide plan for global “control.” So, according to the conspiracy theorists,
why waste the most dramatic event of the century on a bunch of terrorists
armed with 89-cent box cutters or on their handlers hiding out in a cave half a
world away? It had to have really been the CIA. Or the president. Or the military-
industrial complex. Or the Freemasons. Or the reptilian aliens of the ancient
Babylonian Bloodline. . . .
Of course, there really are conspiracies out there. It’s just human nature, the
same human nature Chapter 3 discusses, that yearns to form secret societies.
It’s also human nature that some bully boy in Iraq, some artist in Vienna, or
some revolutionary in Chile believes that he was destined to rule the biggest
chunk of the world he can lay his hands on, or at least enthrall masses of
adoring followers. In the hands of a dictator, conspiracies are great for blind-
ing people while you grab power. It’s like pointing and shouting, “Look over
there!” while you steal all the poker chips. Yet, all the real conspiracies in the
world may not have the potential for damage to culture that lies in believing
that everything is a conspiracy. It’s not a healthy world view.

n London’s Hyde Park, there’s a place called Speaker’s Corner, where
anyone can preach or shriek anything they like, as long as they keep it
clean. There have been some famous and brilliant people who’ve made speeches
there, and there have been an awful lot of cranks, wackos, and madmen in the
park, too. Aye, there’s the rub. How do you tell the difference between a
cautionary reporter of impending calamity from a madman off his meds?
At one time, conspiracists, those who saw the dark hand of conspiracy in just
about everything, were dressed in a white jacket that laced up the back with
really, really long sleeves. Now, they have become respectable, even influential —
or at least New York Times best-selling authors. There’s no doubt that, apart
from simply being a facet of human nature, conspiracy theories rise and fall
in volume along with national tension.
This chapter examines the anatomy of conspiracy theories and the history of
the first conspiracy theories to really catch on in a big way, and it delves into
the tactics used by half-baked conspiracists to lead you to a conclusion that
just isn’t so. After reading this chapter, when some guy on TV tells you to just
“connect the dots,” in order to sell you his book, you should be able to 
determine whether this gentleman has oatmeal where his brains should be.

Defining and Recognizing Conspiracism
Simply put, a conspiracy theory is the notion that someone, or an organized
group of people, is acting secretly with evil intent. Police and courts often
charge criminals with conspiracy to commit a crime — a bad guy or a group
of his buddies meet and plan to commit theft, kidnapping, havoc, or mayhem
against other citizens. Conspiracy is a crime in and of itself.
The word conspire comes from the Latin word, conspirare, which literally means
“to breathe together,” and probably grew out of the idea of plotters whispering
together — there were plenty of plots to go around in ancient Rome.
Boiled down to their simplest ingredients, conspiracy theories attempt to
identify a struggle between good and evil, but on a much grander, and often
worldwide, scale. Like bad guys in a James Bond movie, conspiracy theories
can and often do go global and involve supercriminals, evil geniuses, megalo-
maniacal trillionaires, satanic demons, or even alien invaders who are hell-
bent on owning everything or controlling everything or destroying everything
(society, religion, economics, racial groups, or a combination of all of them).
Conspiracies are thought to exist so a small class or category of schemers
can create a situation — politically, militarily, economically, or just through
sheer snobbery — that works solely to serve their own self interests.
One small point on terminology before going any further: Many writers have
written books about conspiracy theories, and for many of them, the very term
conspiracy theory is a put-down, as is calling someone a conspiracy theorist.
We don’t feel that way. “Tinfoil hat-wearing moon bat” is more our idea of a
put-down. When we use the terms conspiracism or, when speaking of a single
person, a conspiracist, we’re talking about people who claim to identify con-
spiracies. The terms themselves don’t imply whether we believe them or not.
Just what is conspiracism?
In the last two centuries, and particularly in the last 50 years or so, people
the world over have embraced conspiracism. When we refer to a conspiracy,
we mean an honest-to-goodness, old-fashioned conspiracy, as defined by the
dictionary — a plot by some dark and nefarious characters to do something
sinister or evil.
In its milder forms, conspiracism isn’t too bad. You know what we mean —
the kind of guy who’s perfectly sane, yet he’s absolutely convinced that the
price of everything he buys is controlled by some tiny cartel of bankers in
New York or Geneva. Or maybe he thinks that the United Nations wants to
20
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

take over the U.S. government. Or that National Security Agency spies are
tracking his movements through a microchip in his neck inserted when he
had his tonsils out.
The problem is that, as this sort of thinking has become more and more
common, it’s spawned a new sort of social commentator and a new sort of world
view, seeing every major world event through the dark filter of conspiracism.
The universe of conspiracism isn’t a random place where things happen for
no reason. As Michael Barkun puts it in his book, A Culture of Conspiracy:
Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America (University of California Press):
 Nothing happens by accident: Everything that happens in the world is
intentional, by someone’s (or something’s) Grand Design.
 Nothing is as it seems: Whoever or whatever is in control disguises their
role and their identity. In fact, they go out of their way to look innocent,
deflect blame, or just plain hide.
 Everything is connected: Because of an intricate, evil design that allows
for no accidents, there’s no such thing as a coincidence, and the patterns
of evil forces are all interconnected with each other. Therefore, the right
type of person can see these patterns of numbers, designs, events, or
activities everywhere, once they know what to look for (see the sidebar
“Fnord”).
This last bit is important, because in most conspiracy theories a thread
of insistence exists that only certain, truly enlightened people can see
the truth behind the secret plots. Most conspiracies are, so the thinking
goes, invisible to the vast majority of sheeplike citizens who go grazing
through the pasture of life, never suspecting the evil wolves lurking
behind the rocks of everyday occurrences.
In a way, conspiracism can be comforting to true believers, because it removes
the scary notion of randomness from the universe. For some, conspiracies
can seem like an extension of religious faith, with God and Satan locked in a
struggle for supremacy on Earth. In fact, many conspiracists are strongly con-
nected to a belief in the coming of the end of the world. After a specific series
of world events happens, these “millenialists” believe, those events will usher
in Armageddon, the final battle between the forces of good and evil on earth
(more on this in Chapter 6).
Conspiracism and secret societies
Something else that’s bound up hand and foot with conspiracism is, of
course, the secret society. In fact, most of the popular conspiracy theories
aren’t as new as you may think, and they can be traced back either to a fear
of the Jews or a fear of secret societies. We go into more detail about general-
ities involving these groups in Chapter 3.
21
Chapter 2: Conspiracism and the Origin of Modern Conspiracy Theories

It’s important here to bring up secret societies’ role in the majority of conspir-
acy theories, because wherever there’s conspiracism, there’s always the fear
of some tightknit group of “theys” who really know the score. These groups can
be anyone — the World Bank, the Bilderbergers, the Freemasons (all of whom
have their own sections in this book — see the index). These groups are the
very breath of life to conspiracism, and the one can’t exist without the other.
Understanding How Conspiracists Think
In its most virulent forms, the fever of conspiracism can turn reality upside
down. Dealing with the conspiracist, amateur or professional, is a lot like
dealing with somebody who’s part of a religious cult. In fact, if you keep it up,
they’ll probably accuse you of being part of the conspiracy.
A big part of the mindset of conspiracism is that all facts are malleable, all of
them changeable in the right hands, none of them to be trusted. Like the cult
member, conspiracists believe what they believe because they believe it, and
they don’t like to be challenged. In fact, challenges to this sort of thinking
tend to bring out the worst in the conspiracist, which is why there’s so little
difference between a “conspiracist” and someone who’s just plain paranoid.
To the conspiracy theorist, the world is locked in a battle between a good Us
and a bad Them, whoever They happen to be. The battle may be spiritual,
physical, economic, or philosophical — or a combination of all of them. The
worst part is, Them is often portrayed as a small group, a tight group, who
really knows what’s going on, and Us takes the part of a herd of mindless cattle,
being manipulated and too stupid to know they’re being duped. Being a
conspiracist doesn’t require a love of mankind. In fact, the position is made
to order for people who hate or mistrust humankind (called misanthropes).
As Daniel Pipes points out in his book Conspiracy, someone who indulges in
conspiracism doesn’t necessarily go off the deep end, but it happens often
enough to give one pause. Question reality often enough, and you have no sense
of it left at all. This loss of reality, combined with mild to severe paranoia, can
make you see enemies everywhere. British conspiracist and anti-Semite Nesta
Webster took a gun with her every time she answered the door; Joseph Stalin,
by the end of his days in absolute power, had people shot just for looking at
him the wrong way.
Oliver Stone, director of the 1991 film JFK (see Chapter 5), once said, “Paranoids
have the facts.” But he also said, “Who owns reality? Who owns your mind?
I’ve come to have severe doubts about Columbus, about Washington, about
the Civil War being fought over slavery, about World War I, about World War II
and the supposed fight against Nazism and Japanese control of resources . . .
I don’t even know if I was born or who my parents were.”
22
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

Shall we dance to the left or the right?
Conspiracists cross the political spectrum, and, in the process, sort of create
their own party. In other words, from Holocaust deniers to Oliver Stone, they
have the same process in their thinking. Now, Holocaust deniers tend to be
right-wing and anti-Semitic, and would probably be deeply offended to be told
they had anything at all in common with left-wing Hollywood director Stone.
Yet, in the paranoid pattern of their thinking, they’re one and the same.
Hates are justifiable and grudges eternal, evil embodied by anyone who denies
the shining light of the truth they hold. For conspiracists, conspiracies are
behind most of history’s major events, even conspiracies involving so many
people that they could fill the Seattle Kingdome. This, combined with an
absolute allergic reaction to facts, is a dangerous combination. They trust no
one apart from fellow travelers, and little enough in them.
Lack of proof is the proof
For the conspiracist, evidence is the hobgoblin of little minds. Looking for
evidence is an annoyance, because for the true believer, the lack of proof is
the proof of the conspiracy itself.
Lack of evidence proves that powerful forces are seeing to it that evidence
never sees the light of day. But if evidence does come to light and refutes the
claims of a professional conspiracist, he can turn it around to his advantage.
Such evidence is simply more proof that the conspirators are frightened of
the conspiracists and are working overtime to cover their tracks by creating
plausible, but utterly false, data. After all, so the argument goes, these evil forces
control the media, business, banks, universities, governments, and all-you-
can-eat buffets; obviously, the real truth will never come out. They will in
vent and plant new evidence to make their accusers look discredited — or
ridiculous — which is a waste of time, because they can do that all on 
their own.
What the behaviorists say
Psychologists, psychiatrists, and other people who study the pathology of
conspiracy theorists have come up with a raft of behavior categories:
 Apophenia: This behavior looks at meaningless or unconnected images,
numbers, words, or other data and finds patterns in them. It can be as
harmless as gazing at clouds and seeing kittens or dragons or as bizarre
as seeing shadows and craters in a picture from Mars and deciding that
it’s a gigantic face carved by some Martian Leonardo DaVinci.
23
Chapter 2: Conspiracism and the Origin of Modern Conspiracy Theories

 Confirmation bias: This habit is the tendency to develop a preconceived
notion, then make all evidence conform to it, or to simply ignore the
contrary evidence altogether.
Political arguments between members of opposite parties often degener-
ate into this type of selective, uncritical bias, such as “He’s a tax-and-
spend liberal,” or “She’s a country-club Republican.” Any evidence to
the contrary, such as him cutting a tax or her doing volunteer work in an
inner-city church, is deemed either a lie or a complete aberration,
because nothing can be permitted to interfere with this one’s contention
that all liberals love to tax and spend, or that one’s contention that all
Republicans love restricted country clubs. For many folks out there, this
kind of thinking can be very comforting.
 Cognitive dissonance: “Cognition” is simply a knowledge you possess or
something you know or learn. “Dissonance” means any two things that
create tension by conflicting with one another. Therefore, cognitive 
dissonance is a state of mind in which a person has two thoughts or
beliefs that are at odds with one another.
Examining Types of Conspiracy Theories
The various types of conspiracy theories can be broken down by what the
perpetrators are supposedly up to. Author Michael Barkun classifies these
types as
 Event conspiracies: These conspiracies are supposedly responsible for
a specific event or chain of events, such as the creation of AIDS and “crack”
by the CIA to wipe out inner-city African-Americans, or the claims that a
U.S. military missile shot down TWA flight 800, with a subsequent coverup.
The conspiracy exists to accomplish one limited, specific, well-focused
objective.
 Systemic conspiracies: These broad-based conspiracies have ambitious
goals such as gaining the control of a country, a region of the world, or
the entire world, for that matter. Or maybe just everybody’s money.
Naturally, to pull this off requires a massive organization, operating in
secret, to infiltrate governments and institutions. These allegations
regularly include the accusations that Jews control banks, the press, and
Hollywood; Freemasons control governments and businesses; Catholics
or Muslims want to take over all world religions; and, depending on
who’s weaving the conspiracy theory, either communists or world indus-
trialists are taking over everything else. Unless, of course, you believe
that the aliens have trumped the humans, and are just raising everyone
to harvest people for food and/or sexual playthings.
24
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

 Super conspiracies: This notion comes back to the concept that every-
thing is connected in one, vast, worldwide, super-duper plan of many
conspiracies, all contained inside each other, like little Russian nesting
dolls. All the event and systemic conspiracies (see preceding bullets)
are merely tiny pieces of a giant puzzle, and their perpetrators are just
pawns being controlled by one, great, all-powerful supergenius of evil,
who’s invisible to us all and completely secret.
In conspiracist literature, this category is often called “The Grand
Conspiracy.” For lack of a better or simpler example, Satan comes to
mind for many, especially Christians who believe the end of the world is
coming soon.
25
Chapter 2: Conspiracism and the Origin of Modern Conspiracy Theories
Applying Ockham’s Razor
A maxim was devised by a 14th-century
Franciscan friar named William of Ockham (or
Occam, depending on who’s doing the spelling)
that comes up a lot in discussing conspiracy
theories. The Latin version is, “Numquam
ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate,” which
means “Plurality ought never be posed without
necessity.” The more modern version is, “Keep
it simple, stupid.”
Ockham’s Razor, when applied to a conspiracy
theory, shaves away the really complex parts of
the idea, just like a real razor does, and demon-
strates that there’s way too much that has to be
interconnected and work perfectly, every single
moment of every single day, to keep the entire
world from discovering this horrid plot. It’s just
too complicated.
For example, it requires a complex, convoluted
series of people, and of plans, to justify the
belief that Princess Diana was killed by British
agents, acting on orders from her royal ex-
in-laws, who maneuvered her into a limousine,
kept her from fastening her seatbelt, and
arranged to have a series of motorcycles and
cars goad her driver into rocketing down a Paris
street at high speed and crashing into a con-
crete pylon, simply in order to hide the fact that
she may have been pregnant by her Egyptian
lover.
Ockham’s Razor applied to the Princess Diana
situation bears a more likely scenario: that her
driver was drunk and, as drunks often do, was
driving too fast; that paparazzi on motorcycles
were irresponsible jerks and clearly trying to
make a dangerous photo-op out of the situation;
that the experienced English Royal Family and
their own security people were better at taking
care of her than the al Fayad family no matter
how rich they are; and that Paris motorists are
maniacs, which all resulted in a tragic accident.

The French Revolution and the Birth 
of Modern Conspiracism
Conspiracy theories appeal to something deep inside the human animal. In
that respect, they’re as old as man. For example, the chronicler William of
Tyre made dark assertions about the behind-the-scenes power of the Knights
Templar ten centuries ago. Yet the fact is that modern conspiracism, as expe-
rienced today, wasn’t born; it was made. It was cooked up in the lab, just like
Frankenstein’s monster. And the laboratory was the French Revolution.
The French Revolution? Yes, it does sound as though we’re taking a drunken
loop off the beaten path. But it’s necessary to understand a few of the uglier
events of the French Revolution in order to understand the forces that sewed
together the Frankenstein of conspiracism. The revolution was unlike anything
that had come before, shaking civilization to the core. It destroyed the old
society and the old culture overnight, replacing it with a completely new one,
including a new religion, new forms of address, new forms of government,
even new fashions and behaviors that were permissible in public, while the
old ones were banned.
Attitudes before the French Revolution
Western civilization, after the fall of Rome, was built on kings and their courts
and their system of justice, as well as the basic feudal system of peasant, knight,
lord, and king. Along with the arrival of learning, extended to one and all by
the printing press, the seeds of change began with the growth of an economi-
cally healthy middle class in Europe, as early as the 1500s.
By the time of the revolt in France, in 1789, the middle class was doing well.
The state was nearly bankrupt, and what money it had came from taxing this
class. Naturally, an idea took root pretty quickly — “If we’re the backbone of
the nation, then how come we get treated as if we’re no different in social
class from a peasant?”
In this period, called the Enlightenment, the buzzwords were “science” and
“reason.” Hot young philosophers were writing incredibly popular books that
asked a lot of forbidden questions, especially, “How come the church and the
nobles get to run everything, yet pay for nothing?” You’ll see the Enlightenment
referred to throughout this book, because it was a period of cataclysmic
change philosophically, scientifically, religiously, and socially. And groups
that pop up in other chapters — the Rosicrucians, the Freemasons, the
Illuminati, and many others — were formed during the Enlightenment
(roughly 1650 up through 1800).
26
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

This period led to tensions all over Europe, and even some violence, eventually
creating a much better society. What it led to in France was the French
Revolution. From 1789 until the rise of Napoleon in 1800, the richest, 
most populous (with even more people than Russia), and arguably the most
powerful nation in Europe lost its collective mind.
Off with their heads!
French peasants were better off than most of the peasants in the world until
America arrived on the scene. But several years of worsening crop failures
caused one famine after another, and the government’s response was pretty lack-
luster. All the free and easy criticism of the king got freer and ever more critical.
Storming the Bastille
The revolution erupted in the storming of the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789,
a street riot that turned into a battle. The French still celebrate Bastille Day,
like the United States’ Independence Day. The battle led to years of unbelievable
violence. Eventually, half a million people died, tens of thousands of them in
the carnival atmosphere of the guillotine set up in the public square, so that
their deaths could provide amusement for the crowds. This wasn’t just in the
Place de la Révolution in Paris but in every town and city across the nation.
In the beginning, both the middle class and the lower level of the clergy had
been generally in favor of the revolution. Yet they were the first to die, along
with the poor and the dispossessed. The violence was called “the Reign of
Terror,” because it was a far more horrifying bloodbath than most history
books tell.
More than revolution: Terror!
Officially, the “Reign of Terror” began with the September Massacres in 1792.
The royal family was held prisoner and eventually executed.
Jean-Paul Marat and his inner core of paid mercenaries were behind the
September Massacres of 1792. Marat sent out death lists of priests, business-
men, and petty nobles suspected of being against the revolution, and the
killing began. It didn’t stop for days.
After they’d polished off their assigned lists, the rioters moved to the various
prisons, on the assumption (not a true one) that the Assembly had parked
people who were against the revolution there. They found a few nobles, but
most of their victims were poor and powerless. About 1,500 people were killed
in the spree. One 17-year-old boy was guillotined for forgetting the new form
of address and calling a man “Monsieur” rather than “Citizen.” All this was the
kick-off to a national orgy of bloodletting. As for the church, Catholicism was
banned. At least 25,000 priests fled the country, until Napoleon called a truce
with the church 11 years later.
27
Chapter 2: Conspiracism and the Origin of Modern Conspiracy Theories

Eventually, Marat was stabbed in his bathtub by a young French girl from
Normandy named Charlotte Corday, who traveled to Paris specifically to kill
him, sickened by the savagery he’d inflicted on the opposing Girondist Party
in the Assembly, many of whom were from her hometown of Caen.
Assigning blame
When Napoleon appeared on the scene in 1804 with a sword in one hand and
a mop in the other, Frenchmen were left standing knee-deep in the blood-soaked
rubble, dazed, wondering how on earth this had happened in the most civilized
nation on Earth. “Cognitive dissonance” was about to afflict an entire nation.
They couldn’t deny that the cruelty, madness, and violence had occurred; the
evidence was everywhere. And they couldn’t face the fact that it had grown
out of themselves.
Someone else had to be to blame. And so was born the first conspiracy litera-
ture, along with the identification of what have become the principal hobgoblins
of the conspiracy world: the Freemasons, the Jews, and the Illuminati.
The birth of conspiracy literature
The books of conspiracy literature appeared slowly at first. Three books of
major concern were
 The Veil Withdrawn: One little volume appeared in 1791 by a French
priest named LeFranc. This book was The Veil Withdrawn. The veil
LeFranc withdrew was the one surrounding Masonic ritual, when he
accused the Freemasons of being behind the revolution.
 The Tomb of Jacques Molay: In 1792 came The Tomb of Jacques Molay
by Cadet de Gassicourt. Jacques de Molay was the legendary last grand
master of the Knights Templar, executed by French King Phillip IV in
1314. Cadet de Gassicourt made the claim that the Knights Templar were
the founders of Freemasonry, and that they were both to blame for the
revolution.
 Proofs of a Conspiracy: Next came an influential volume by an English
Freemason named John Robison called Proofs of a Conspiracy, in which
he praised noble and straightforward English Freemasonry for not causing
bloody revolutions like their French brethren.
Augustin de Barruel and the Jesuits
Many French people were living in England at the time, having escaped from
the Terror. One was an ex-Jesuit and abbot named Augustin de Barruel
(sometimes referred to in writings as the Abbé Barruel). Barruel had been a
28
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

member of the Jesuits (or Society of Jesus), a Catholic order of priests
banned all over Europe by king after king (in France in 1766) until the pope
caved and shut down the order in 1773. The ban wasn’t lifted until 1814.
Jesuits were the cream of the crop in the church intellectually, and their
missions were teaching, converting, and spreading Catholicism all over the
world. The pope was fighting Protestants, and when the Society of Jesus was
founded in the 16th century, the world-traveling Jesuits were sort of his shock
troops in this effort, which was called the “Counter-Reformation.” But the Jesuits
came to be seen by the rulers of Europe as a secret society with way too much
power and a dark Machiavellian hand in underground politics. And the fact is
that a lot of people, during this “Who did it” period, were blaming angry,
underground Jesuits for the revolution. But the Abbé Barruel had a better idea.
While living in England, this emigrant priest met the Englishman John Robison,
and their meeting resulted in the most influential conspiracist work of all
time. Inspired by Proofs of a Conspiracy, Barruel wrote a huge four-volume
magnum opus entitled Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism.
We wouldn’t recommend trying to read the whole thing, not unless you know
how to prop your eyelids open with a pair of toothpicks. Augustin de Barruel
does a lot of convoluted evidence building and also a lot of ranting, mostly
about the anti-church Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire. (Darn those
Rationalists, anyway! Nobody was confused about what they believed until
they came along.) What makes Barruel’s rants important is that he attempts
to trace the history of anti-clericalism and Rationalism, and comes to the
dubious conclusion that there have been hives of both all down through the
centuries, all of them hidden in various secret societies.
According to Barruel, it all started with the Knights Templar in the 11th century.
The Templars were a brotherhood of warriors/monks, set up as an arm of the
Catholic Church in the Holy Land during the Crusades. They’d been all but
forgotten by most people until de Barruel got hold of them. Ever since then,
the Templars have been a magnet for all sorts of conspiracy theories. (For a
lot more on the Templars, pick up a copy of The Templar Code For Dummies,
which is, in all due modesty, a book of ours.)
Barruel dug up all the old accusations that sent the Templars to be burned at
the stake by the Inquisition; they were secretly against the church, they were
magicians worshipping foreign gods they’d learned about from the Jews and
Muslims in the Holy Land, yada, yada, yada.
The Templars-Freemasons-Illuminati-Jacobins 
were ultimately responsible!
What’s more important for the history of conspiracism is that Barruel drew a
connecting line between the Templars and the French Freemasons, who he
claimed were originally founded by the Templars. All this anti-church rhetoric
29
Chapter 2: Conspiracism and the Origin of Modern Conspiracy Theories

ran from the Templars to the Freemasons, and from the Freemasons to the
Illuminati and the Jacobins (the radical group of French men who really did
start the revolution).
Barruel said the Templars, the Freemasons, the Illuminati, and the Jacobins
were one in the same. He made the case for his readers that the Templars,
who’d been denounced by the French king and burned by the church in the
early 1300s, had survived, hating both church and king, waiting for five cen-
turies to have their revenge.
Over the course of the next two centuries, conspiracist literature came in
waves. Yet, it’s a testament to the influence of Barruel that his same theories
still gallop through the books of many conspiracists today.
Barruel’s ongoing modern influence
By the 20th century, the 1920s saw an enormous rise in conspiracist books,
accompanied by the new interest in spiritualism and the occult. By the 1970s,
other conspiracist books became even more popular — the kickoff was an
underground hit that took the publishing world by surprise, called None Dare
Call it Conspiracy (Lightyear Press) by Gary Allen, which told the “real” story
of how the left-wing administration, rather than the right-wing administration
of Richard Nixon, destroyed American liberty and sold children’s futures to
bankers and industrialists. Behind the whole conspiracy stood Barreul’s old
suspects — Jews, Freemasons, and the Illuminati.
Other books soon followed, on a wide range of subjects:
 Hugh Joseph Schonfield’s The Passover Plot (1966; Random House) put
forward the notion that Christ hadn’t really been crucified and the
phony crucifixion was part of a plot to gain power in Roman Judea.
 Charles Berlitz’s The Bermuda Triangle (1974; Doubleday) suggested a
government coverup of a rash of missing military and civilian planes in
one highly charged area off the coast of Florida.
 Hal Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth (1970; Zondervan) launched a
new wave of fascination with the biblical book of Revelation and the
“End of Days.”
 Erich Von Däniken’s Chariots of the Gods? (1984; Berkley) put a new face
on archeology by revealing the hand of aliens behind the history of
mankind.
And so it went, rolling ever onward, right up to Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code.

Dreck Alert! Dreck Alert!
Books, movies, TV shows, and coffeehouse arguments by conspiracists, when
they’re lucid, can be a lot of fun. Other times, sifting through the dreck can be
like trying to get hold of the really good cashews in a jar full of mixed nuts.
Here are a few pointers to help you identify when somebody is stacking the
deck in the conspiracy world:
 Look at the sources. One of the problems with conspiracist literature is
that it can look just as scholarly and well researched as anything written
by a respectable academic or investigative author. But take a glance at
the list of books that are footnoted in the text (the bibliography).
Pat Robertson, television evangelist and former presidential candidate,
wrote a book called The New World Order that was absolutely littered
with conspiracism. When questioned about his source material, he
replied, “Well look! We have a seven-page bibliography!” But just what
books was he citing?
Conspiracists have a tendency to cite one another, so the same theories
go round and round, with little in the way of cold hard facts to back
them up. Likewise, when watching a documentary with a slew of
“authors” and “historians” intoning solemn accusations, go look up who
they are and what they’ve written (and as a side note, don’t be fooled by
researchers with British accents — they can be every bit as loopy as
Yanks, in spite of their Cambridge diction).
 No cherry-picking. Conspiracists love to straddle the fence. Government
reports, photos, and statistics can’t be trusted because the government is
usually part of the conspiracy — except when those same government
reports, photos, and statistics back up their argument. And when such
evidence is only partially favorable to the theory, conspiracists gladly
use just what they need and ignore the rest.
 Separate facts from emotional claims. Often conspiracy theories are
based on the passionate testimony of witnesses. Any good trial lawyer
can tell you that, while eyewitness testimony is the most powerful to a
jury, ironically, it’s the least reliable evidence in reality. Stories can change
over the years, especially when a witness feels the spotlight on him, and
says what the listeners want to hear. And witnesses who don’t come
forward for decades until a famous incident might provide a lucrative
book deal should be regarded with healthy skepticism.
 Be alert for unsupportable statements. Conspiracists have a tendency,
some worse than others, to make completely unsupported and unsup-
portable statements. They’re easy to spot: “John Doe claimed, of course,
that he was at the airport at the time, though that is questionable. In the
end, Irving Doe was conveniently dead, and John Doe moved ahead with
his campaign for the Senate.”
31
Chapter 2: Conspiracism and the Origin of Modern Conspiracy Theories

No proof is offered of any sort that John Doe is lying about having been
at the airport; in fact, the very carefully phrased “that is questionable”
implies that there may be evidence that he was at the airport, though this
author wants to ignore it, so he calls it “questionable,” explaining no further.
In the end, it is hoped, the reader has picked up the dark suspicion that
John Doe had Irving Doe bumped off in order to win the election. This is
classic conspiracist style.
 Examine how authoritative people are portrayed. “Question authority”
isn’t a bumper sticker with a conspiracist — it’s a way of life. If every
famous name in a position of authority you come across, from J. Edgar
Hoover to Pope John Paul II, is presented as grumpy, sullen, dark, evil,
scheming, and completely untrustworthy, with his words treated like
total lies and pulled out of the context of the statement, the style is con-
spiracist all the way.

G
ang violence is tearing many cities apart. The larger gangs have moved
out across the countryside, dealing crack in such unlikely places as
Lincoln, Nebraska, and Appleton, Wisconsin. But wherever they are, they
remain a society within a society, always underground, though they leave
clues behind.
In Los Angeles, visitors are constantly assaulted by gang graffiti, the nonsen-
sical lettering spray-painted over every available public surface, from highway
bridges to park benches. But what seems to the casual observer to be nonsense
as well as nuisance is in reality a language between gang members and rival
gangs. It can only be read by the gang members themselves, apart from a few
specialists in gang-related violence who work for police departments. For
these young people who feel so impotent in the mainstream of society, it
must cause an intoxicating rush of power to be painting that secret message
10 feet high, knowing that only your brothers in arms can understand it.
That moment, that rush, connects to one of the deepest satisfactions to be
found in any secret society — the vague sense of superiority and pride, as well
as a comforting feeling of belonging that’s the very foundation of any self-
perpetuating brotherhood. Apart from the need to feed himself and to procreate,
one of man’s most driving instincts has been the impulse to form groups,
including tribes, sects, cliques, and cults.
This we versus them mentality seems to be encoded in human DNA. That’s
why the concept of the secret society is nearly as old as civilization. For the
Greeks and the Romans, for Egyptian priests and Chinese hit men and medieval
French knights, it’s always been the same game. In this chapter, you get a better

understanding of how psychologists, historians, sociologists, conspiracists,
and the occasional cop work to understand just who and what makes up a
secret society.
Defining Secret Societies
To begin defining secret societies, you must know that various types of secret
societies exist (and are covered in this book). They are very similar — and
closely related — to the classifications of conspiracy theories discussed in
Chapter 2.
A secret society is
 An organization whose existence is known, and whose membership is
public knowledge, but whose rituals and meetings are considered to be
secret. The Freemasons are an excellent example of a secret society.
 An organization whose existence is known, but whose membership and
objectives are a closely guarded secret. The Hellfire Club of 19th-century
London is a good example of this type of secret society.
 An organization whose existence is rumored, but few, if any, concrete
facts are known. Many times, this sort of organization gives birth to
some of the wildest speculations of the amateur or professional conspir-
acy theorist, because their very existence is debatable, and in the end,
impossible to prove. The modern-day Illuminati are a good example.
 An organization whose membership, traditions, and aims are completely
open and above board, but whose meetings are conducted in private,
and consequently are perceived by many in the public at large to be a
focal point for something much more sinister, generally because of the
high-octane political power of the membership. The Bilderberg Group is
an excellent example of this sort of secret society.
 A certain high-level bureau within the federal government. They’re listed
here because they are, by their very nature, “secret societies,” whether
they admit it or not, and they have given rise to so many modern American
conspiracy theories. While rumors abound, they may or may not exist,
and their capabilities and missions may be very different from what the
public believes — good or bad.
Historically, some intelligence agencies have actually grown out of a secret
society. In Israel, for example, the famous Israeli intelligence bureau, the Mossad,
grew out of an underground secret society formed to resist the British occu-
pation of Palestine that was called the Irgun, as well as other secret offshoots of
the British-recognized Palmach, the Jewish Army in pre-1948 Palestine. The easy
transition from secret society to intelligence agency only serves to highlight how
closely linked they are, in terms of their structure.

Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

The Difference Between a Secret 
Society and a Religious Cult
Religion comes up on many occasions when discussing secret societies. Many
societies are connected to a religious faith if only through the belief in that
faith shared by their membership.
For example, the Ku Klux Klan was strictly a Protestant Christian organization,
whether the Protestants claimed them as members of the congregation or
not, while the Knights Templar was a Catholic organization, inseparable from
the pope and the Catholic Church.
Examining the fine lines
So is a religious cult a secret society? The differences and similarities between
the two can be a very fine line. Here are some very broad generalities:
 Most religious cults keep a great deal of their structure and their aims
secret. Many are controlled by one messianic and powerful figure, a
figure who often has an inner circle of trusted compatriots that can
seem an awful lot like a secret society.
 Many secret societies are founded for a spiritual purpose that seems
mighty close to a religion. (For example, a lot of the most conspiratorial
of the secret societies in this book are occult in nature.) So, isn’t occultism,
or even Satan worship, a “religion?” It certainly is for some. And these
occult beliefs are bound to spawn more secret societies than, say, the
Congress of Anglican Bishops, simply by their very self-described myste-
rious makeup.
Look up the word occult in the dictionary sometime. You may think it
means supernatural, or even witchcraft, but what it means is hidden. By
their very nature of being groups that go against the grain of society,
these organizations, such as Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis, are
going to qualify as “secret societies.” So, in that respect, religion will be
addressed, insofar as occult beliefs can be considered a religion.
Examining the specifics
In order to lend a little clarity to the cloudiness of the situation, here are a
few points of difference:
35
Chapter 3: Building the Perfect Beast: Secret Societies through the Ages

 Generally, secret societies don’t proselytize, while religious cults do little
else. To proselytize means to get out there and find potential members by
using high-pressure tactics. In general, secret societies get the wannabe
members knocking on their doors and not the reverse.
 Secret societies usually set a bar high enough to keep out members they
don’t want. Religious cults, on the contrary, use their tactics on anyone
standing nearby.
For example, cults often use a technique called “love bombing.” This
method usually happens in the period when the cult is still trying to get
the potential convert to join. During this honeymoon period, everyone
in the cult just loves you. They love the way you dress; they love your
hair; they love your insightful comments; they love your bridgework.
Meanwhile, in a completely opposite camp, a secret society is often
spending this same “honeymoon period” testing potential members to
see if they can make the grade.
 Religious cults are very often built around the absolute faith of the
members in one messianic figure, as with Jim Jones in the People’s
Temple. Historians call this psychological effect the “Cult of Personality,”
and it works even in groups of millions, as with Soviet Russia under
Joseph Stalin.
Religious cults often fade away or break apart into other cults when
their leader dies, no matter how large they might’ve been (as in the case
of the remnants of remaining Branch Davidians). Sometimes they go
rolling on, with a second-in-command who keeps things going in the
name of their dead messiah. Or worst of all, like Marshall Applewhite
and the Heaven’s Gate cult, the personality simply takes all the members
with him when he goes.
As a rule (a rule with the occasional exception),noncultish secret societies
may be founded by one man, like Adam Weishaupt and the original
Bavarian Illuminati. Such societies are usually set up to be self-
perpetuating and don’t die away with their founder.
 The effect of membership on the relationship to a person’s family is
different. Religious cults often try to cut a person off from old friends
and eventually from family members, particularly if the cults disapprove.
Many cults assign new members a sort of “keeper,” an older and more
trusted member of the group who accompanies the new member just
about everywhere including the toilet, and this means tense and weird
situations like coming home with the new convert for family events like
holidays. Until the new convert can be trusted to have become utterly
brainwashed and deaf to all criticism, the cult likes to keep him as near
to hand as possible.
36
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

Generally, secret societies do little to damage a person’s relationship with
family and friends, although this rule isn’t hard and fast. For example, a
man may become deeply involved with an organization like Freemasonry,
leaving home two or even three nights a week for Masonic events that
don’t include wives. Of course, Masons, seeing this potential for angry
wives, long ago created many subsidiary organizations that get the wife
and kids involved with the fraternity in order to ease any hurt feelings of
being left out. But the dynamic is still there with many secret societies,
and it can be far worse with some. For instance, if a man or woman is a
member of the most clandestine offices within the CIA or NSA, they’re not
even allowed to tell their family what they do for a living. This, too, can
create a strained distance in family relationships, though generally nothing
on the scale of the home wrecking that cults can achieve.
Organizations that straddle the fence
Some secret organizations out there straddle the fence between a secret society
and a religious cult. Because religions, cults, and secret societies don’t always
start with a well-designed road map, their purposes or methods can change
over time. Everything from persecution or distrust by society to a change in the
head of the organization can turn the tiller in a different direction.
In addition, people outside of the group can accuse it of different motives
than what actually motivates the group internally. And then there are those
that deliberately masquerade as one type of group, while they really are
something else entirely.
One good example of this type of organization is the ancient Cult of the
Assassins because “the Old Man of the Mountain” used the group’s Ismaili
faith to keep his men under his power. But their political ambitions and their
various plots against the governments of the world put them fairly and
squarely in the category of a secret society.
The Church of Scientology is perhaps the best modern case of straddling the
fence. Their Religious Technology Center (RTC), one of the most powerful of
the complex inner layers of organizations that govern the Church of Scientology,
is a prime example of the fusion of cults and secret societies. Because
Scientologists have a nasty habit of (allegedly) suing anyone who even sneezes
in their direction, we speak only of the (alleged) inner secret society that
governs over the (alleged) Pacific Area Command (PAC) Base Scientology
Center in the (alleged) city of Hollywood, California.
Entire books and sequels to books, running feuds in print between present mem-
bers and former members, have been devoted simply to the question of whether
Scientology even is a religion, as well as whether it’s a cult. Any organization that
can go head to head with the IRS, blackmail its commissioner to obtain a special
tax status, and get away with it is one to be deeply reckoned with.
37
Chapter 3: Building the Perfect Beast: Secret Societies through the Ages

The Second-Oldest Profession: Secret
Societies in Ancient Times
Historians believe that the concept of the secret society is one that goes back
to the concept of the tribe; in fact, one grew out of the other. Tribe members
separated by war or disaster had to have signs with which to recognize one
another. Many of the rituals of early adolescence, like the Jewish bar-mitzvah,
grew out of tribal rituals that welcomed the young initiate into the group.
That concept of being “initiated” is a bedrock of the secret society.
Egypt: Source of the first secret society?
Naming the first secret society that’s similar to those in the current era is a
difficult task. The Egyptians had innumerable secret fraternities — most
having to do with their complex and ritual-drenched religion. But one secret
society wasn’t quite as much a priesthood as the others. The society grew up
out of one of the first figures in history who wasn’t a pharaoh or a king. His
name was Imhotep, and he was the chancellor, or grand vizier, for the pharaoh
Zoser (also spelled “Djoser”) in the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom.
Apart from being a master builder of the first recognizable Egyptian pyramid,
Imhotep was also a physician, the father of Egyptian medicine. And as if these
laurels weren’t enough, he was an astronomer, a sculptor, a poet, and a philoso-
pher whose sayings were cherished 20 centuries after his death. Later, Imhotep
was made a god, with a highly imaginative lineage from a mating between a
mortal woman and the god Ptah. But for the men of the cult of Imhotep that
developed in the city of Memphis, he wasn’t a god but a man, and was revered
as such.
This cult had an inner secret society, a Brotherhood of Imhotep, that worshipped
his ability as a builder and that created a metaphor for god as an architect,
making for a striking similarity with the Freemasons who don’t come along
for at least another 4,000 years.
Greece: Ancient cults and mystery schools
The Greeks had many closed and elite alliances, from factions of Spartan
army officers to the private clubs of Athenian noblemen. The Kryptia, for
example, was a secret organization of Spartan military men with a very rigid
code by which the members lived.
38
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

The majority of the Greek secret societies grew out of the mystery schools.
These schools were called mystery schools from the Greek word myein,
meaning to close, as in close the eyes and mouth to receive the ritual secrets.
The person taking in the young initiate was called the mystag gos, the leader
of the mysteries, and his officer was called the hierophant, the “revealer of
holy things.”
Historians believe that, at one time, a couple thousand years before Christ,
these mystery schools were made up of the entire tribe — initiation into the
society and into the tribe were one and the same. Later, as their culture became
more sophisticated, the original mystery schools that centered on the worship
of mother-earth goddesses like Demeter broke apart into many mystery
schools and many other forms of cults and sects, too.
The Dionysian and Eleusinian Mysteries
In their earliest days, the two most important mystery schools were the
Dionysian and the Eleusinian.
 The Dionysiac Mysteries: An act of worship of the god Dionysus, god of
fertility and of wine. In the Dionysian Mysteries, although they weren’t
exactly having orgies, a lot of sex was going on during these joyous, days-
long, wine- and food-saturated festivals, and anthropologists believe that
young men were initiated into their sexual manhood as well as their place
in the tribe when they took part in their first mystery festival.
39
Chapter 3: Building the Perfect Beast: Secret Societies through the Ages
Animism
For almost all tribal religions, the name of the
game is animism — the communication of
human traits to animals and to elemental forces
like the wind, the tide, and the seasons. To
argue whether it’s magic or religion has taken
up a lot of room in scholarly books and papers,
when there doesn’t seem to be much point to it —
it was simply what people believed.
A part of this belief was the secret society mys-
tery schools — sometimes called sodality by
the scholars. Sodality is the tight brotherhood
(or sisterhood because many members were
women) of a particular tribe. Many of the secret
rituals of these sodalities had to do with the
attempt to placate and control the forces of
nature (which is why all the sex going on in so
many of them made sense). Humans having sex
led to fertility and either paid homage to the
god’s fertility that created the earth or perhaps
even fired the gods up to a greater amount of
sex and fertility, making for a bigger crop. Man
was born, lived, procreated, died, and was
buried in the earth to become a part of this
process of enriching the land.

 The Eleusinian Mysteries: Celebrated the myth of Demeter, the great
earth-mother and goddess of the grain, and the story of her daughter
Persephone, or Kore, who was kidnapped by Hades and tricked into
living with him for one third of the year. During this time the vegetation
on the earth died. But each spring Persephone returned to her mother
Demeter, and the land was reborn and fruitful once more.
Actually, Greece held festivals to honor the goddess Demeter, but the
superspecial secret one, the one in which Demeter herself had imparted
the ritual mysteries to the people, was only to be found at the festival in
the city of Eleusis, which was eventually annexed to the city-state of
Athens. These mysteries were open to any and all who wanted to attend,
and huge numbers did just that. But strangely enough, as more and more
Greeks attended to be initiated, it became less and less the initiation into
a single tribe, and more simply a person’s religious choice. This would
help to lead, in Greece and her imitator Rome, to the secular mystery
schools.
Greek secular schools
The secular schools retained an air of religion, but basically they were private
social clubs and sometimes political clubs, too. Secret society mystery
schools existed for those who followed the scientific quasi-religious teachings
of Pythagoras. These clubs were known as the Orphics. Many people also
followed the popular teachings of Plato.
The initiation rituals of these secular mystery schools remained the same, if
not more dramatic and elaborate as time passed. But after the initiation was
over, these societies focused on drinking together, eating together, and even-
tually, plotting together.
In the year 415 BC, the Athenian democracy was nearly destroyed by the con-
spiracy of several of these social clubs of powerful Athenian noblemen who
got together and attempted to overthrow the state. Later on in Rome, similar
attempts to overthrow the state happened several times until secret societies
of any sort were outlawed completely.
Rome: Cults and paranoia
The Romans were a very sophisticated people, and they loved to band together
into various societies and clubs, from groups of officers who served on the
frontier under the same general, to organizations devoted to a particular
trade or political party. These secret societies of a particular trade became
the first powerful craft guilds in Europe in the Middle Ages. Many of these
guilds were somewhat religious in nature and are often called religious con-
fraternities, simply because particular laborers or craftsmen looked to particular
gods or goddesses as their patrons.
40
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

But the rulers of Rome found the whole idea of secret societies to be unac-
ceptable on the grounds of danger to the state. Before the reign of the first
emperor, Augustus, they were, in fact, illegal. In ancient Rome, one of the reasons
the odd new sect of Christians was perceived, in the three centuries before
the conversion of Constantine, to be so dangerous was because the Romans
saw them not as a religion so much as a secret society.
However, as the Roman emperors conquered the East, and the Mediterranean
became their private lake, the influx of Eastern mystery cult religions was so
overwhelmingly popular that no one could stop it. Besides, as the empire
expanded, more and more people were cut off from hometowns and friends,
and these cults filled a definite need. And so these various cults to Isis or
Mithra or Bachus were allowed for a time, so long as it could be shown that
their rituals were strictly religious.
They were also incredibly odd. Here are some examples:
 Some of the cults had priestesses, while others had priests who were
eunuchs dressed in women’s clothes and wore a lot of makeup.
 Ritual progressions consisted of people carrying sacred trees or plants.
 An initiate often fasted for a week or more before the ceremony that
took him into the cult.
 Many cults had various levels or ranks through which a candidate could
rise, like the Mithras cult, with its “Lions” and “Ravens” and “Couriers of
the Sun.”
Most of these cults had an initiation ceremony that mimicked death and res-
urrection, and as Rome became richer and more technically endowed, they
relied on some great special effects for a ripping good show. The initiate may
be closed up in a casket or a sarcophagus and then buried or shut away.
Beforehand, he may be disemboweled in a phony play. The entrails of an animal
were used in this play for greater blood spatter. The cults may also put on a
show pretending to decapitate or to drown the initiate or to rip out his heart.
Instructions have survived that tell how to perform some of these tricks,
which include
 How to put sulfur on a torch so it still burned when you drew it out of a
pool of water
 How to make writing appear on a wall
 How to make a halo appear around a priest’s head
After the initiate’s “resurrection,” the initiate may have a ritual with an officer
of the cult, standing in for, say, Isis. All in all, it made for one great Saturday night.
41
Chapter 3: Building the Perfect Beast: Secret Societies through the Ages

The Vestal Virgins
The Romans had every sort of secret brotherhood, not to mention a sisterhood,
in the form of the intensely guarded cloister of the Vestal Virgins, whose
primary task was to maintain the sacred fire of Vesta.
For centuries an eternal flame burned within the Temple of Vesta on the
Roman Forum. The Romans believed that the fire was closely tied to the for-
tunes of the city and viewed its extinction as a sign of disaster.
The Vestal duty brought great honor and privileges to women who served in
the role. These women were the only female priests within the Roman religious
system. Any woman who broke her oath or revealed the secrets of the order
was led to the outskirts of the city, symbolically cast out of society, and
promptly buried alive. But the Vestals were part of the state-approved faith,
as old as Rome itself.
The rise of the gentlemen’s club
In the fading days of the Roman Republic, the gentlemen’s clubs on the Athenian
model were very popular, until, in the consulship of Cicero in 63 BC, an aristo-
crat named Lucius Catalinus, or Cataline, attempted to launch a takeover of
the government. The conspiracy was proved, and a warrant was issued for
Cataline’s arrest. He fled to his men outside the city, and many lives were lost
to bring down him and his private army.
For the rest of the period of the Republic, and on into the later Empire period,
forming a secret society in the Roman Empire was illegal, and the penalty for
doing so was death. What makes this more remarkable is that the dynamics
of the secret society haven’t changed much since Cicero’s day.
Within a few decades the Republic fell, but nervous-Nellie emperors didn’t
like the idea of secret societies any more than republican senators and consuls.
Most emperors allowed all sorts of exceptions to the law, but it wasn’t a good
idea to push it. In fact, some emperors became absolutely neurotic on the
subject of secret societies of just about any sort.
The Roman Emperor Trajan wouldn’t allow the citizens of Nicomedia to form
a club that would act as a citizen’s fire brigade, and the most paranoid of emperors
wouldn’t allow associations whose objective was obviously charitable.
The Cult of Bacchus
Much of the Roman government toleration for the mystery cults came to a
crashing end with the scandal of the Cult of Bacchus. The Bacchanalia, or the
Festival of Bacchus, was officially suppressed in 186 BC because it had gotten
completely out of hand, with public debauchery and lewdness of every sort,
rape, drunkenness, murder, and worst of all, general drunk and disorderly
conduct that resulted in more property damage with every year that passed.
42
Part I: Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies 

The Cult of Bacchus drew more of the working-class folks than the aristocracy,
and the Senate thought that the rowdy emotionalism of the festival made it
particularly distasteful (meaning “frightening”). From that time forward, the
Roman mystery cults lived with a sword over their head. (The festival still
went on privately, out in the country, away from prying eyes.) Individual wor-
ship was fine — group worship and ritual was discouraged at every turn.
Therefore, these “mystery rites” became more secret than ever, going under-
ground so they could stay in business.
Europe: Secret societies from 
the Middle Ages onward
The relentless forming of alliances and fraternities continued through the
Middle Ages, in every form from the secret fighting order of the Knights Templar,
to the trade guilds of the prosperous merchant cities. By the late 19th century,
Europe was drenched in secret societies, most of them having been formed in
the period of the Enlightenment. Many had an anti-monarchial, republican,
equality-of-mankind bent of belief, as well as the worship of the two new
Enlightenment buzzwords — science and reason.
Of course, there were more than a few frivolous societies: drinking and dining
clubs; groups that assembled secretly to read and discuss subversive literature
or just dirty books; sex clubs like the infamous Hellfire Club; and of course,
rabble-rousing political societies.
United States: Societies and fraternalism
In the United States at the end of the 1800s, belonging to a fraternal organization
was nearly a necessity for any man who expected to be an upstanding member
of the community. This was the golden age of American fraternalism with
literally thousands of organizations like the Masons, the Knights of Columbus,
the Knights of Pythias, the Maccabees, the Order of the Beavers, the Order of
the Buffalo, the Red Men, the Sons of Italy, and even the Croatian Fraternal
Union of America, just to name a very few.
Just about everybody had a society or fraternity. Most were patterned on the
granddaddy of all fraternal secret societies, the Freemasons (see Chapter 9).
All this fraternalism lasted up until the 1950s. But the post–World War II gen-
eration, the baby boomers, prided themselves on not being “joiners.” It just
wasn’t hip to become a Mason or a Moose, or anything else that smacked of
the “Establishment.” Men who belonged to such fraternities were incessantly
mocked. Only a sap would ever consider such a ridiculous investment in time
43
Chapter 3: Building the Perfect Beast: Secret Societies through the Ages

and energy. Masons wore stupid hats, the Scottish Rite had boring dances,
and Rosicrucians advertised on matchbook covers. Now, just who in his right
mind would search for spiritual fulfillment from a group that advertised on a
book of matches?
A new interest in secret societies
At the dawn of the 21st century, America is undergoing a new wave of fascination
with secret societies. And one of the most amazing aspects of secret societies
is the large number of surviving groups from the “golden age” still around to
greet them.
In our own time the dynamics behind the phenomenon are still the same.
Whatever the baby boomers thought, breaking off into cliques and cults is a
basic human trait, one that won’t be left behind for long. After all, what was
the hippie commune but just another kind of secret society, a breakaway sect
feeling itself superior to the culture as a whole? Certainly, the murderous
Charles Manson family, the dark underbelly of the hippie culture, qualifies as
a secret society with its own symbols, rules, and mythology. It sure wasn’t
the Rotary Club. And heaven help the guy in a 1960s commune who decided
that a wife, a couple of kids, and a split-level ranch house in the suburbs
wasn’t quite as “empty and futile” as his comrades had made it out to be.
Or, as the writer Eric Hoffer put it, “Woe to him inside a nonconformist clique
who does not conform with nonconformity.”

and genocide. And we discuss the eruption of post-9/11
conspiracy theories, from the sublime to the ridiculous,

t seems that we live in cynical times. No one and nothing can be trusted,
when you get right down to it. Some conspiracies are so “secret,” so “dia-
bolical,” and so “hidden from the public” that everybody seems to know about
them. Like the evil corporate conspiracy that sees to it that hot dogs are sold
in packages of ten, but hot dog buns come in packages of eight. Or that every
time some backyard genius invents an engine that runs an automobile at
highway speeds on nothing but water, the car companies buy him out, or
“silence” him.
Likewise, there are long-held beliefs about secret underground government
installations used for covert and probably evil purposes. Thanks to popular
shows like The X-Files, every school kid knows about government labs dissecting
space aliens, building sinister death rays, and testing mind-control weaponry
on entire cities. With all this “secret” knowledge going around, it’s amazing
that the government can hide anything these days.
This chapter covers the classics of the conspiracy catalog, from fluoridated
water to subliminal advertising that makes you uncontrollably consume at
the retail trough. And you find a few folks who’ve been thought to be long
dead, who may still walk among you.

Please note that a couple of the old favorites are missing from this chapter —
namely items having to do with UFOs, space aliens, faked Moon landings, and
the ever-popular “face on Mars.” Fear not. Because these topics are so
numerous, you find more information in Chapter 7.
Technological Terrors
“We’re from the government, and we’re here to help” — a phrase certain to
send a chill through the heart of any citizen of the modern world (or at least
through the hearts of conspiracy theorists). Some people believe that even
when government wants to help, somehow it finds a way to get it wrong. And
when it may involve introducing unknown chemicals into the water we drink,
the air we breathe, and the very atmosphere that keeps us alive, we tend to
get nervous. Or at least cranky.
Many of the conspiracy theories that we cover in this chapter can be traced
back to one man: Nikola Tesla. Tesla was a fascinating scientist, possibly even
the prototype for the classic Mad Scientist character of the sort usually played
by Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. He’s also a staple of the conspiracist’s universe.
Born in Croatia in 1856, Tesla came to the U.S. at the age of 28 with little more
than the clothes on his back. His work in the fields of physics, electricity, and
magnetism was groundbreaking, and probably everyday items like telephones,
radios, televisions, X-rays, microwave ovens, and even the electricity in your
home wouldn’t exist had it not been for this eccentric inventor.
But conspiracy theorists believe that Tesla’s greatest inventions — free electrical
generation, an electrical “death ray,” and a superweapon with enough power
to “split the world in two,” — have either been repressed by giant corporations
or secretly developed by the military, or both. More on those in later sections.
Fluoridated water and the Cold War
Communist Plot
In the 1964 Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove, a paranoid Army general,
Jack D. Ripper, unleashes nuclear Armageddon over something most people
have never heard of: fluoridation of water. As Ripper (played by Sterling
Hayden) explains:
Have you ever seen a Commie drink a glass of water? . . . Fluoridation is the
most monstrously conceived and dangerous communist plot we have ever
had to face. . . . A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily
fluids without the knowledge of the individual. Certainly without any choice.
That’s the way your hard-core Commie works.

Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories

In 1909, a Colorado dentist noticed a curious development in some of the teeth
of his younger patients. They were developing a strange stain on their teeth
that came to be known as the “Colorado Stain.” But what made the cases odd
was that the children with greater evidence of the stain seemed to have
markedly fewer cavities. Eventually, the discoloration was traced to large amounts
of fluoride, a naturally occurring chemical found in the rocks of the famous
Pike’s Peak. As snow melted, water ran across mineral deposits of cryolite, which
contained fluoride, and trickled into the water supply of the towns around the
mountain. The surrounding folks might’ve had brown teeth, but at least they
didn’t rot.
Over the years, the U.S. government took on several studies to determine the
safe level of fluoride in a water supply that would prevent cavities, without
causing the ugly stain. At first the studies were to determine how much fluoride
to remove from the Pike’s Peak water supply to make it safe to drink, because
fluoride in high concentration really is dangerous. But by the 1930s, dental
and healthcare researchers were recommending the chemical be added to
water supplies across the U.S. to prevent cavities.
At almost the same time, an anti-fluoride movement fought the proposals. At
first, the argument was that adding the chemical violated a citizen’s right to
not be medicated against their will. Christian scientists said it was against
their religion. Conservatives, who were watching the results of fascist forms
of socialism in Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s Germany, claimed that fluoridation
was nothing but socialized medicine.
Then an ex-Communist named Oliver Kenneth Goff testified in the House 
Un-American Activities Committee hearings in the late 1930s that Communist
agents in the U.S. were in favor of fluoridation. Why? Their plan, according to
Goff, was to take over water treatment plants and threaten to dump the large
stockpiles of deadly fluoride into the nation’s water supply if Americans
didn’t surrender.
Another tale was that the Nazis developed fluoride water treatment as a
chemical means to sterilize women. And in 1954, research chemist Charles
Perkins claimed, “Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in
time reduce an individual’s power to resist domination, by slowly poisoning
and narcotizing a certain area of the brain, thus making him submissive to
the will of those who wish to govern him.”
Actually fluoride really is poisonous in very high doses over a long period of
time — an accident in Alaska in the 1990s put excessive amounts of the stuff
into the water of Hooper Bay, making almost 300 people sick and killing one.
Nevertheless, close to 70 percent of the U.S. population drink fluoridated
water every day. So do most of those former Commies over in Russia. But to
this day there are conspiracists who believe that fluoridation really is a
massive and evil plot.

Chapter 4: The World’s Most Common Conspiracy 

Chemtrails
Look up in the sky on any given day. They seem to be everywhere across the
blue canopy of the heavens — the white, tic-tac-toe lines known as contrails.
They’re the very natural byproduct of the very unnatural machines of human
flight.
When moist air gets sucked through a jet engine, warmed up, expelled as
exhaust, and hits the freezing temperatures found in high altitudes (somewhere
around –40°F at between 25,000 and 30,000 feet), the result is the formation of
tiny crystals of ice that dangle lazily in the sky before drifting apart and melting.
If the air is too dry, contrails are short or even nonexistent. If the air is especially
moist, they can hang around a long time and stretch from one horizon to the
other. And if you live near Air Force bases that sometimes fire guided test missiles,
the contrails left behind can sometimes look like drunken Etch-A-Sketch art.
Conspiracy theorists like William Thomas and others have stared up at the
skies for a long, long time — maybe too long a time. And they see something
more menacing:
 They’ve claimed that the government has really been spraying the popu-
lation with chemical or biological substances, thus creating chemtrails.
 Other claims are that the military is attempting to devise either devious
weather-altering weapons or desperate anti-global-warming programs
(depending on if you think the military is evil or good).
 And still more have suggested that the military is seeding the skies with
metal or other electrical conductive material as part of an alleged massive
electronic weapon known by its acronym HAARP (see the section
“HAARP — The electromagnetic superweapon” later in the chapter).
The Internet is rife with “spotter’s guides” that depict the ways to determine
whether that puffy streak in the sky is a harmless contrail or a deadly chemtrail.
These seem to be almost comical in their hysteria as they pick out one cloud
or contrail as being more suspicious than others.
Most scientists agree that spraying chemicals from planes at 25,000 feet and
higher is a supremely dangerous, unpredictable, and worthless exercise,
because high winds at those altitudes can carry airborne substances hun-
dreds of miles in any direction, making studies of such activities — whether
done by good guys or evil scientists — pretty useless at best, and at worst,
liable to float down on the very heads of evil researchers themselves hun-
dreds of miles away.

Nikola Tesla and “free electricity”
Nikola Tesla eventually worked for both of the giants in electrical develop-
ment in the U.S.: Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse. When Thomas
Edison developed the first commercially viable electric light bulb, he knew
it would be worthless if communities had no way to power them. Edison’s
company, General Electric, built electrical generating stations using a power
delivery system called direct current (DC). But Tesla had different ideas.
Frustrated by Edison’s methods, he quit and developed a competing genera-
tion system (alternating current — AC) for Westinghouse that still is the stan-
dard method of electrical delivery in the U.S. (and most other countries)
today.
At the same time he was working for Westinghouse, Tesla had his own com-
pany and had much bigger ideas. What he envisioned was the transmission of
“free” electrical power through the air without the need for wires. He invented
what is still called the Tesla Coil, a device used to create bursts of extremely
high-voltage electricity (they make massive lightning-bolt displays with exciting
crackling noises and are often the centerpieces of modern day science muse-
ums). He believed that if he could create a coil big enough, electricity could be
beamed to a receiver across town, with no need of anything in between.
Over the years Tesla set up research facilities in New York and Colorado
Springs, where he built massive generators and transmission antennas to test
his theories. Accidents occurred regularly:
 In New York, he created “harmonic resonance” that nearly knocked over
buildings adjacent to his lab by vibrating them to pieces, and he feared
he could create enough power to destroy New York and split the world
in two.
 Later experiments at a more secluded lab near Colorado Springs resulted
in sparks flying out of the ground and arcing from the city’s fire hydrants.
Still, his Magnifying Transmitter did manage to illuminate light bulbs
from 25 miles away, without any wires.
Conspiracy theorists claim that Tesla’s ideas about wireless electricity have
been suppressed by giant electrical equipment manufacturers. Yet, his hundreds
of patents and stacks of writings have been publicly available for over 100 years,
and nothing has ever prevented anyone from attempting to re-create his
experiments. Nothing, that is, but the danger of much death and destruction,
since Tesla worked with thousands of volts of electricity.
There is an enthusiastic group of hobbyists and experimenters who regularly
build their own Tesla Coils and attempt truly dangerous, deadly, and, in some
cases, just plain stupid experiments with them.
51
Chapter 4: The World’s Most Common Conspiracy 

Peace ray or death ray?
Tesla wasn’t all hearts and flowers. He also recognized the destructive power
of electromagnetic energy. In the 1930s he drew up plans for a Wardenclyffe-
style tower that had a more deadly intent. He envisioned a particle beam
weapon (what science fiction writers and comic books in those days called a
“ray gun”) that would narrowly focus a beam of energy strong enough to
knock airplanes out of the sky. Tesla called it, ironically, a “Peace Ray,” a
weapon so horrible that it would end all wars. (Of course, every inventor of
horrible weaponry has believed this, from Dr. Guillotine’s beheading machine
and Alfred “Peace Prize” Nobel’s TNT, to the Gatling Gun and the atomic bomb.)
The ray gun was never produced, and when Tesla died, the most important
diagrams of the invention were never found. The FBI claims that Russian
spies broke into his apartment and stole the contents of his safe before U.S.
authorities could get there.
HAARP — The electromagnetic 
superweapon
HAARP is the more manageable acronym for the High Frequency Active
Auroral Research Program facility near Gakona, Alaska. Constructed in the
1990s, HAARP’s official purpose is to study the effects of electromagnetic
energy on the ionosphere. The way it accomplishes this is to direct 3.6
52
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories
Wardenclyffe Tower and Tesla’s “World System”
Starting in 1901, Tesla assembled financial back-
ing for his long-dreamed-of “World System.” On
Long Island he began to build a 187-foot tower,
called Wardenclyffe Tower, with a domed top,
looking like the world’s biggest salt shaker.
Tesla’s ultimate plan was to build these towers
all around the world to create a global radio
broadcasting system, a way to synchronize the
world’s clocks, a global navigation system, and
his greatest desire, the wireless transmission of
free electricity to anyone with a special under-
ground wire conductor and a dishlike antenna on
their roof.
Tesla dreamed of free power for everyone, but
financier J. P. Morgan wasn’t so generous. When
he finally heard of Tesla’s “free power” plan, he
demanded to know how investors would recoup
their money if they couldn’t sell electricity.
“Where do I put the meter?” he famously asked.
When the inventor explained his humanitarian
goal, Morgan and the rest of the finance team
walked out. The tower was never completed and
was torn down in 1917 during World War I
because the government was afraid German
submarines would use the landmark as a
navigation aid.

million megawatts of electricity into a transmitter, pump it out of an antenna
straight up into the atmosphere, and take readings from satellites.
The effect seems to be that the ionosphere gets toasted by the beam of energy,
similar to the effects of solar flares, albeit in a very tiny way (since 3.6 million
megawatts is a pinprick compared to the electromagnetic energy hitting the
Earth from the Sun). That’s the 10-cent explanation of the official mission.
Conspiracists say that the military designed HAARP with a far more sinister
intent. It is claimed that the facility is a weapon being developed to knock out
enemy satellite and radio communication by bombarding the atmosphere
with massive electromagnetic waves. Some have claimed that the 1993 power
blackout in the northeast United States and Canada was triggered by a blast
from HAARP.
In the 1980s, physicist Bernard Eastland proposed technology similar to what
was built at HAARP as part of the so-called “Star Wars” defense shield (known
in military circles as the less Hollywood-ish Strategic Defense Initiative, or
SDI). Eastland built on the theories of famed electrical pioneer Nikola Tesla
and proposed a high frequency, electromagnetic “shield” that could be used
to electronically jam incoming Soviet nuclear missiles and knock out enemy
satellites. When the government actually built HAARP, they claimed Eastland’s
patents weren’t used, in spite of the similarity of the basic principles.
But critics who claim that HAARP is quietly sitting up in Alaska just waiting to
be used by the military as a “death ray” aren’t silenced. The belief is that the
mild doses of electromagnetic pulses sent into the ionosphere are merely
trial firings and tests, in anticipation of the really big jolt. A few of the very
nervous have suggested that HAARP could direct its rays anywhere on Earth,
and can be used to do anything from creating major weather catastrophes on
demand or causing earthquakes, to causing mass brain damage on a global
scale by frying brain cells.
HAARP isn’t technically a U.S. military research site, and it has a large com-
plement of civilians working on the property. However, the project is managed
by a division of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), the
Defense Department’s super-high-tech “gee whiz” office that works with indus-
try and universities to develop sophisticated technologies that might have a
defense application (like the Internet, before Al Gore claimed it for himself).
Philadelphia Experiment’s vanishing ship
In October 1943, a U.S. Navy destroyer called the USS Eldridge was supposedly
part of a wartime experiment that went terribly wrong. That is, if you believe
in the Philadelphia Experiment.
53
Chapter 4: The World’s Most Common Conspiracy 

The story goes that the Navy’s Office of Naval Research (ONR) discovered a
way to apply one of Nikola Tesla’s concepts called the Unified Field Theory —
a method of using electromagnetic energy in conjunction with gravity to
“bend” light around a physical object, rendering it invisible.
In 1943, work began in the Philadelphia Navy Yard to install special equipment
aboard the USS Eldridge to create what Star Trek fans would describe as a
cloaking device. Supposedly, the first test in June did indeed make the ship
disappear, but shrouded in an eerie green fog. When the experiment ended,
the crew aboard the ship reported bouts with nausea. At that point, the Navy
decided the process was too dangerous to use with a human crew, and
altered the goal of the device to simply make the ship invisible to radar.
Four months later, the experiment was attempted again. This time, instead of
just disappearing from sight, the USS Eldridge physically vanished and turned
up briefly off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, almost 400 miles away. Then, it
mysteriously reappeared in Philadelphia. The scientists had accidentally dis-
covered the secret of teleportation. Unfortunately, the experiment had a hor-
rible effect on the crew. Many went mad. Five sailors were supposedly
rematerialized within the steel walls or decking of the ship. Others kept fading
in and out, appearing and disappearing. The psychological effects on the crew
were so devastating that the Navy resorted to brainwashing techniques to get
them to forget the entire experience. As can be expected, the Navy’s ONR has
always scoffed at the story, but true believers say the Navy is engaged in a
coverup.
Actually, the entire story of the Philadelphia Experiment can be traced to the
accounts of just one man, Carlos Allende. Allende claimed to be a crewman
aboard a merchant ship in Norfolk when the USS Eldridge suddenly faded into
view right before his eyes with no explanation. In 1955, Allende contacted a
UFO researcher named Morris K. Jessup and told tales of seeing crewmen
ashore wink in and out of sight and other effects of the experiment gone wrong.
However, Allende turned out to really be Carl Meredith Allen, a Pennsylvania
man with a history of psychiatric problems. Allen created an elaborate manu-
script of events, handwritten in different colored ink to look like three men
had worked on it. When Jessup was unable to interest a publisher in his book
based on Allen’s writings, he became depressed, had a mental breakdown
and committed suicide. Naturally, believers took it to be proof that Jessup
and Allen had both been discredited by the government, and “gotten rid of.”
Over the years, real Navy veterans of the USS Eldridge have attempted to
debunk the tale. They point out that the ship wasn’t even built in June 1943,
but was completed in August of that year. And it wasn’t built in the
Philadelphia Naval Yards, either. The USS Eldridge was in New York from its
christening until a shakedown cruise in the Bahamas in September of 1943. It
never even docked in Philadelphia during the period in question.
54
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories

Ships during the period really were often outfitted with massive electromagnet
coils, used to demagnetize or degauss the hull to foil underwater mines and
torpedoes with magnetic triggers. The process is still used today, and it’s
possible these giant coils were the inspiration for the story.
In 1979, Charles Berlitz and William Moore wrote the most famous account of
the tale, The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility (Grosset & Dunlap).
In 1990, Alfred Bielek came forward and claimed to have been a sailor who
jumped off of the USS Eldridge’s deck just as it winked out of sight. Bielek has
since been exposed by several sources as a fraud who was never anywhere
near the USS Eldridge during its supposed experimental mishaps.
Dirty Work Down Below — Underground
Government Installations
The U.S. government over the years has built several survival bunkers to
relocate officials or to run wartime operations from in the event of an atomic
attack or other cataclysmic catastrophe. These have often been claimed by
conspiracists to mean that a “shadow government” was in place and ready to
take over — either for a U.S. government police state or the New World Order.
Most of these facilities protected critical operations of government during
the MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) days of the Cold War with the Soviet
Union. President Dwight D. Eisenhower set many of these underground
bunker plans into motion in the 1950s.
Alleged underground bunkers
President Eisenhower believed that, in the event of a nuclear attack on the
U.S., the continuity of government had to be protected in case a large number
of elected leaders were wiped out in the first blasts. As a result, a series of
major underground installations were constructed, starting in the ’50s.
The most famous underground bunkers include the following:
 Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs,West Virginia: This facility
is possibly the most famous, least secret, and most unusual under-
ground government installation. Secretly built within a hidden wing of a
luxury hotel and resort, the bunker was designed to safely hold members
of Congress underground until the mushroom clouds passed by. No
longer an operational top-secret site, public tours are now available.
55
Chapter 4: The World’s Most Common Conspiracy 

 Mount Weather, Bluemont, Virginia: Another emergency government
relocation site was constructed at Mount Weather, near Bluemont,
Virginia. Technically a Federal Emergency Management Administration
(FEMA) facility, Mount Weather has been around since the 1960s. Its
location and purpose have been a loosely guarded secret almost since
the beginning (serving as the inspiration for “Mount Thunder” in the
1962 novel, Seven Days In May).
Vice President Dick Cheney was brought to Mount Weather immediately
following the 9/11 attacks, and it’s one of the two “undisclosed locations”
he and critical members of the administration have been taken to in
times of emergency.
Mount Weather is believed to be the present underground relocation
center for the government, with room and provisions for several thou-
sand bureaucrats. The U.S. may be glassed over from falling nukes, but
rest assured that your tax bill will be delivered come rain or shine or
nuclear winter.
 Site R: The military has its own underground emergency operations
center near Camp David, in the Pennsylvania hills. While places like
Greenbriar and Mount Weather concentrate on protecting government
bureaucrats during a nuclear attack, Site R is the temporary home of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and all branches of the U.S. armed forces.
Critics of the plans saw a Dr. Strangelove aspect to the idea, concerned that
unelected officials or the military, safe in their bomb shelters, would take over
the government, and that little or no provision was being made to protect the
general public. There was also a sentiment that military “hawks” wouldn’t
be deterred from launching nuclear attacks if they thought they would sur-
vive in a cozy, multi-million-dollar hole in the ground with all their comforts
provided for.
56
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories
Fears of FEMA
The Federal Emergency Management Admini-
stration (FEMA) may be well known for passing
out hot coffee during national disasters, but its
primary (and less publicly known) mission is to
see to the “continuity of Government” in case
of national emergencies. Since its beginnings,
FEMA has had a frightening laundry list of
police-state powers to do much more than just
provide an underground home for Washington
politicians when D.C. gets nuked. Executive
Orders over the years have given the agency
the authority to round up U.S. citizens and
detain them without charges if they are deemed
to present a danger to the nation’s security.
Rumors have abounded for years about secret
FEMA “concentration camps” existing all
across the country.
In 2003 after the 9/11 attacks, FEMA was folded
into the newly created, ever-expanding mega-
agency, the Department of Homeland Security,
which is now the third largest U.S. government
agency.

As the former Soviet bloc fell apart and the Berlin Wall got knocked down,
conspiracists started looking for different, more sinister reasons for under-
ground installations. These have included secret detention facilities for thou-
sands of military or political prisoners, underground labs for studying the
remnants of crashed UFOs or alien bodies, or hangars for building advanced
weapons and aircraft. Many of these supposed bunker locations are figments
of the imagination, but some aren’t.
Denver International Airport: The New
World Order’s subterranean HQ
Anyone who has flown since the 9/11 attacks knows that airports are Beelzebub’s
satanic stockyards, where passengers are treated like cattle. Communities can
spend all the millions of dollars they like in an effort to fill these massive spaces
with soothing artwork and soaring terminal designs, packed with wall-to-wall
retail shopping and fast-food Valhallas, but it doesn’t matter. Air travel has been
made miserable, and airports are places to be avoided.
But one airport in particular has attracted the attention of a wide range of
conspiracists who see something sinister there, and it’s even worse than TSA
cavity searches over forbidden shampoo bottles, corkscrews, and nail clippers.
When Denver, Colorado, outgrew its old Stapleton Airport, the city and county
government decided to think and build big. They went 25 miles out of town
and built a facility that takes up twice the landmass of Manhattan. The airport
was designed with the future in mind and is the largest airport in the U.S., the
third largest in the world. As with any project of this size, there was much
consideration given to the decoration and design of the terminal, and its unique
roof line was made to represent the conical peaks of the Rocky Mountains.
But it was the artwork inside the airport that first attracted curious groups of
the very, very nervous. And then more accusations started pouring in. Here
are some of the peculiarities noted by researchers:
 Evil words: Some conspiracists have pointed to words cut into the floor
as Satanic, Masonic, or just some impenetrable secret code of the New
World Order: Cochetopa, Sisnaajini, and the baffling Dzit Dit Gaii. It turns
out that these words are actually Navajo terms for geographical sites in
Colorado. The other creepy terms often pointed to as evil references
include Braaksma and Villarreal, which are actually the names of Carolyn
Braaksma and Mark Villarreal, artists who worked on the airport’s
sculptures and paintings.
57
Chapter 4: The World’s Most Common Conspiracy 

 Creepy murals: We don’t know art, but we do know that a soldier wearing
a gas mask, stabbing a dove with a scimitar, and waving a gun over a river
filled with women carrying dead babies isn’t really the sort of thing to
uplift our spirits while dashing for a far gate on a short layover Other
bizarre images include a scene with caskets featuring a dead Navajo
woman, a dead Jewish woman, and a dead African-American woman.
Artist Leo Tanguma wrote explanations of his personal, if odd, inspirations
for the paintings, describing them as depicting scenes of violence and
tragedy being overcome by peace and harmony.
 Masons and the New World Order: There is a dedication marker in the
airport that’s clearly inscribed with the square and compasses of the
Freemasons, along with listing the involvement of the two Grand Lodges
of Freemasonry in Colorado. All this is mounted over a time capsule
sealed during the dedication of the airport. Some claim that this is a
futuristic “keypad” with some unknown purpose. Spookier to them is the
notation of an organization called the New World Airport Commission.
The New World Airport Commission, says Denver Airport officials, was a
group of local businesses that organized the opening ceremonies of the
facility, and they chose the name because Denver was aiming to create a
“new, world-class” city and airport. The Freemasons participated in
laying the “capstone” (the last, finishing stone) of the airport project.
This is by no means unusual. Masons have been laying cornerstones,
capstones, and memorial markers for public buildings for almost 300
years. On the other hand, we don’t hear people grousing about the new
wave of Feng Shui “space clearing” ceremonies popping up everywhere
these days, consecrating everything from municipal buildings to nail
salons.
 Masonic Great Hall: Another claim is that the large portion of the terminal
is called the Great Hall and is named after a room found in Freemason
lodges. There may be Masonic buildings in the world with assembly
rooms or dining areas referred to as Great Halls (London’s comes to
mind), but it’s by no means a common term in the overwhelming major-
ity of Masonic buildings. It’s frankly a more common term in castles,
from Chinon to Disneyland.
 Nazi runways: Most modern airports wishing to utilize the most efficient
runway designs are built these days with two parallel runways. Not so in
Denver. Looked at from above, there’s no denying that the runways radiate
like twisted spokes from the terminal building, and they do seem to
resemble a swastika. Conspiracists claim this is either a fascist message
to secretly show off the totalitarian power of the New World Order, or
that it’s an occult depiction of the old Germanic rune for power.
 Secret underground base: This is the most common charge against the
Denver Airport, that it is built over the top of a massive, secret, under-
ground military base. The airport was budgeted to cost $1.7 billion, but
came in closer to $5 billion when all the dust cleared. While it was built
on a site chosen for its flat setting, millions of tons of earth were moved
58
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories

around the property, giving credence to the claim that something huge
was being built underground.
Bear in mind that the airport was overdesigned to be flexible for decades,
to be easily expandable, and to use the very latest in technology, which
created a nightmare of technical glitches throughout the first years of
operation. Miles of tunnels were dug for underground trains between
terminals and for a troublesome subterranean baggage handling conveyor
system that took years to get operating properly.
In addition, there are other tunnels for a huge fuel pipeline system to pump
jet fuel to gates instead of relying on tanker trucks. Part of the justification
for all this underground infrastructure is because Denver gets whacked
with major snowfall for much of the winter, and the more that can be
handled underground instead of dealing with snow, the more efficient it
will be.
Conspiracists cry balderdash. They say there is a multilevel, subterranean
base run by the New World Order, or the government, or both. Author
Alex Christopher claimed to have worked in the tunnels under the air-
port, and described what appeared to be vast holding areas for prisoners,
strange nausea-inducing electromagnetic forces, and caverns big enough
to drive trucks through, presumably filled with helpless political prisoners.
Night of the Living Dead — 
A Conga Line of Corpses
Over the years, one of the regular types of articles in supermarket tabloids
has been the dead celebrity rising from the grave to be spotted shopping in
Wal-Mart or working in a gas station. Up until Oprah Winfrey’s weight loss
and gain and Paris Hilton’s video debut changed the tabloids’ editorial vision,
the tale of the walking dead was the most popular story to tell. John F. Kennedy
was supposed to be alive and well and living in Switzerland. Hitler was goose-
stepping along the beach in Rio de Janeiro. And, of course, there was Elvis.
Elvis Presley still walks among us!
Throughout the 1950s and ’60s, Elvis Presley was legitimately a superstar. His
breakthrough combination of rockabilly, gospel, pop, rock-and-roll, and tradi-
tionally black rhythm and blues made him a universally beloved figure in the
music business. But by the late 1970s, to many people, Elvis had become a
parody of himself, and only the truly faithful fans still flocked to his concerts.
When Elvis died in 1977 at the age of 42 of a heart attack brought on by obesity
and drug use, one wag famously quipped, “Good career move.”

Chapter 4: The World’s Most Common Conspiracy 

However, claims that the King of Rock and Roll had cheated death began to
appear almost before his alleged corpse was allegedly cold in its alleged
grave. The most commonly cited evidence that he wasn’t really dead was a
discrepancy between the spelling of his middle name that appeared on his
birth certificate, Aron, versus what appeared on his grave, Aaron. Believers
say that Elvis’s family knew that he really wasn’t in the grave, so they spelled
the name wrong on purpose. But there are many more reasons why true
believers say the King is far from dead:
 There are inconsistencies between witnesses as to when Elvis’s body
was found, what he was wearing, and when his death was actually declared.
 Photos from 1977 of the corpse taken by Elvis’s third cousin and sold to
the National Enquirer don’t seem to match up with last-known photos of
Elvis when he was alive.
 The coffin weighed too much. The King was unquestionably of a portly
circumference when he joined the Choir Invisible, but witnesses say the
coffin tipped the scales at 900 pounds. Conspiracists say it was full of
bricks.
 A strange, Elvis-looking man bought a ticket to Argentina and left Memphis
the day before Elvis “died.” Some say it was really the King getting out of
town before the staged “death.”
 Elvis’s longtime creepy manager, Colonel Tom Parker, said at a press
conference shortly after Elvis’s demise, “Elvis didn’t die. The body did.
We’re keeping up the good spirits. We’re keeping Elvis alive. I talked to
him this morning and he told me to carry on.”
 And then it could’ve just been that he was sick of the adoration and his
inability to walk down a public street without getting mobbed — the
curse of superstardom.
Perhaps the most curious belief of all stems from a bizarre meeting that really
happened between Elvis and then President Richard Nixon in December 1970.
The King had written to Nixon offering his services in fighting drug use and
“hippie elements” and was hoping to be made some sort of “Federal Agent at
Large” in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. After having lunch in
the White House Dining Room, Elvis was indeed presented with his badge.
Surely a curious development for a man whose body would be found with at
least 14 significantly dangerous drugs in his system.
Believers say Elvis was really working undercover for the Bureau (precursor
to the Drug Enforcement Agency) on a supersecret case and was so recogniz-
able that he was compelled to live out the rest of his days with a secret identity
under the Witness Protection Program.

After several star-struck ghouls attempted to steal his body from its original
public gravesite at Memphis’s Forest Hills cemetery, Elvis’s coffin and marker
were dug up and replanted at his Memphis estate, Graceland. Meanwhile, the
Elvis Sighting Society keeps track of reports of the King’s postmortem activ-
ity: www.elvissightingsociety.org.
“Paul is dead”
One of the forces that knocked Elvis off his rock-and-roll throne was the arrival
of the Beatles on the ’60s music scene. And one of the strangest events sur-
rounding the Beatles was the rumor in 1966 that band member Paul McCartney
was dead. Not only dead, but replaced with a double. More amazing was that
the band seemed to be putting clues in their music and album covers to leak the
truth — although the Beatles always denied any part in promoting the rumor.
The most famous elements were contained on the Abbey Road album cover.
The four Beatles are shown walking across the pedestrian “zebra crossing”
on London’s Abbey Road, but there are curious clues. McCartney is in a suit,
barefoot and out of step with John Lennon (dressed as a priest), Ringo Starr
(dressed as an undertaker), and George Harrison (dressed in work clothes,
like a grave digger). A Volkswagen Beetle is parked on the road, with the
license plate “LMW281F,” implying McCartney would have been 28 “if” he had
lived, while LMW supposedly stood for “Linda McCartney Weeps.”
In 1969, a Detroit disc jockey named Russ Gibb received a phone call from a
listener named Tom, who announced that McCartney was dead, and for clues,
to play the Beatles song “Revolution #9” backwards. In reverse, the words
that are repeated over and over, “number nine, number nine” sort of sound
like “turn me on, dead man.”
The rumors continued to spread from University of Michigan students and
became a worldwide urban legend when a WABC disc jockey in New York
rambled on about it on an overnight show that was heard over the clear
channel AM station in two-thirds of the U.S. and halfway around the world.
Afterwards, there wasn’t a campus radio station in the country that wasn’t
running a weekend-long “Paul-a-thon,” with listeners calling in their favorite
clues as they poured over the albums and fan magazines until their eyes
fogged over. Grade-point averages plummeted all over the U.S.
Conspiracists pieced together a hodgepodge of lyric lines from several albums
to create the story. Supposedly, McCartney had a fight with the other members
of the band during the recording of the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band
album and stormed out of the studio. He hopped into his Austin-Healey at
about 5:00 a.m. on November 9, 1966, drove into the dark morning, crashed
into a light pole, and was killed. Following the accident, a secret funeral was
held, and the news was withheld from the public. A quiet search was quickly
made for a McCartney look-alike/sound-alike — named Billy Shears — who
61
Chapter 4: The World’s Most Common Conspiracy 

finished the recording of Sgt. Pepper. It was Billy Shears who went on to record
all subsequent Beatles albums and launch his own band, Wings.
Of course, all this started in the creative minds of a small group of college
students who went cherry-picking through the lyrics of wildly different
Beatles songs to invent the story. Unquestionably, the band was bewildered
at first by the story, but John Lennon in particular seemed to enjoy playing
along, while never exactly commenting on it openly.

Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories
The ageless everyman: Count de St. Germain
Just in case you think sightings of the “walking
dead” are purely a modern phenomenon, con-
sider this: In 1742, a curious man appeared in
Europe. He claimed he had just arrived from
Persia, and he seemed to be well acquainted
with the customs of the East. He also claimed to
be an alchemist, who’d learned the art of fusing
jewels like diamonds to make larger stones. To
all who met him, he looked to be in his 40s, and
he was fluent in the major European languages,
as well as Sanskrit, Latin, Arabic, and Chinese.
He was a virtuoso violinist, a painter, and he
seemed to possess incredible wealth, with no
real source for his endless funds. He was
known in social circles as the Count de Saint-
Germain, and many believe that he discovered
the secret elixir to eternal life.
Many sources claim that St. Germain was hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of years old. Voltaire
said he was “a man who never dies and who
knows 
everything,” 
and 
the 
legendary
Casanova overheard the Count say that he was
more than 300 years old. Variously, he’s been
identified as a high priest of Atlantis; the bibli-
cal character Samuel; the Greek philosopher
Plato; Joseph, husband of Mary and father of
Jesus; St. Alban, fourth-century English martyr;
Merlin the Magician; Christen Rosenkreuz, leg-
endary founder of Rosicrucianism; Christopher
Columbus; and Francis Bacon.
During the Enlightenment period of the 18th and
19th centuries, he became a world-famous
alchemist. Some have claimed that he was a
secret 
advisor 
to 
Freemasons 
George
Washington and Benjamin Franklin during the
formative years of the founding of the United
States, and it’s been said that he tended to
Franklin’s painful gout while the aging diplomat
was in Paris. Today, he’s a regular figure in fan-
tasy novels, frequently appearing as a vampire.
In the 1740s, St. Germain became a diplomat to
France’s King Louis XV. In the 1760s, he was in
Russia as part of a plot to install Catherine the
Great on the throne. And after warning France’s
Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette of the impend-
ing French Revolution nearly 15 years before it
occurred, he managed to traipse in and out of
Paris during the Terror in the 1790s without
losing his head.
Some records claim that he died in Germany in
1784. Yet, France’s Comtesse d’Adhémar saw
him many times between 1789 and the 1820s,
and he never looked older than his 40s.
Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky claimed to
know him in the 1870s, and French singer Emma
Calve said she knew him as late as 1897.
A French magician named Richard Chanfray
appeared in Paris in 1972, claiming to be the
ageless Count, and briefly made a name for him-
self on television by transmuting lead into gold.
Money troubles led him and his girlfriend to take
massive amounts of drugs and lock themselves
into a garage with their car running in 1983, so
questions about this suicidal final appearance
of the Count throw questions on his immortality.

As it turned out, it was bad timing to be claiming subliminal messages on
their albums. The Charles Manson trial was going on in Los Angeles in 1970,
and prosecutors claimed Manson had heard what he believed were hidden
messages on the Beatles’s White album to instigate the mass killings that he
thought would set off “Helter Skelter,” a race war between blacks and whites.
But John in particular was determined not to let that take the fun out of it. So
remember when looking into the dead man’s tulips through a glass onion,
that “here’s another clue for you all, the Walrus was Paul.”
Stifling Innovations that 
Threaten Corporate Profits
For years, many people have claimed that corporations regularly prevent
public access to “free” technology in order to prevent their profits from
dropping. A favorite conspiracy theory is that the major automakers have
long suppressed a wave of new engine technologies that would let everyone
drive water-powered cars. Ditto with the electric car, the hydrogen car, the
salad oil car, and the solar car. Unfortunately, there’s no need for a conspiracy
in these cases. The real culprit is economics, public demand, and really jittery
stockholders.
Fair or not, corporations, far more than government, are a favorite paranoia
magnet for conspiracists. In prime time TV, the most common character to
turn out to be a murderer isn’t a drug dealer or a thug, but a businessman.
Subliminal advertising
When 1979’s horror classic The Exorcist premiered in theaters, news articles
reported people running screaming from their seats, vomiting uncontrollably,
and other seemingly out of proportion reactions. While the movie was scary
and had its gross moments, it didn’t seem horrible enough to cause these
strange reactions in audiences.
Slowly, reports emerged that The Exorcist’s filmmakers had done something
manipulatively sneaky. They’d added single frames, seen onscreen for just 1/48th
of a second, of horrific demon faces, cut at random into the scariest scenes.
Almost completely imperceptible to the eye, subconsciously it supposedly
had the effect of making the scenes unbearable. At least, that was the hype.
The Exorcist hadn’t done anything new. In the 1950s it was claimed that certain
enterprising theater owners were using a device known as a tachistoscope, a
machine that flashed words or images onto a screen for mere fractions of a
second, with helpful messages like “Buy a Coke!” or “Hungry? Buy popcorn!”
63
Chapter 4: The World’s Most Common Conspiracy 

Researcher James Vicary became famous for a 1957 study that supposedly
induced audiences to run to the snack bar and buy popcorn, drinks, or
candy, increasing sales by more than 50 percent. Vicary’s study was hyped in
a 1957 bestseller, Vance Packard’s The Hidden Persuaders, a book that told
lurid tales of psychological manipulation by advertisers, and even politicians,
based on subliminal messages.
While the book sold millions, perplexed researchers were unable to replicate
its claims, and Vicary’s theater study actually turned out to be a hoax and
publicity stunt. Nevertheless, the notion of subliminal suggestion in advertising
became a popularly accepted urban legend.
It resurfaced in the 1970s with the publication of Wilson Bryan Key’s equally
disputed Subliminal Seduction, which actually led to a somewhat hysterical
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hearing over the topic. The FCC
decided that subliminal advertising was deceptive, contrary to the public
interest, and was banned on television. Not that many people were actually
doing it anyway.
Sex sells, apparently
Print ads were another matter. Especially between the 1960s and 1980s, ads
that featured tendrils of cigarette smoke, liquor pouring over ice cubes, swirling
hairstyles, and even puffy white clouds in a blue sky were frequently airbrushed
to include suggestive images or words.
“Sex” was a favorite, and seemed to appear everywhere:
 Pepsi Cola was compelled to stop production of a ’70s pop art can that
clearly said “sex” on the label.
 Shadowy outlines of genitalia and various sexual positions would show
up in the most innocuous ads, as a subliminal way to make you look at
them.
 An early ’80s Christian Dior ad featured a cartoon representation of a
woman in a multicolored coat, and almost every thread of it spelled out
words that would make your cousin in the Navy blush.
 A Coca-Cola ad featuring a sweaty bottle of the soft drink was headlined
“Feel The Curves,” and buried in the ice cubes below it was a blatant
drawing of what one might genteelly refer to as similar to Monica
Lewinsky’s most infamous contribution to Bill Clinton’s presidency.
Backmasking
The other famous application of subliminal encoding of messages was first
made famous when the Beatle’s placed reversed recordings within songs on
their 1966 Revolver album. John Lennon claimed he got the inspiration while
64
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories

smoking marijuana, and their experiments with the effect contain pretty
harmless, not to mention mellow, references. However, other groups climbed
on the bandwagon and used the effect.
The technique became popular enough that by the 1970s, alarmed evangelical
Christian groups began protesting that bands were hiding Satanic messages in
their music. The claims were often little more than an audio Rorschach test
(you know, those ink blots that look like all sorts of things), and perfectly
normal lines of lyrics were imagined to be something quite horrible in reverse.
One notorious rumor was that even the theme song to the talking horse
comedy Mister Ed when played backwards said, “I am Satan,” although efforts
to actually hear the message required much imagination.
The hysteria became so bad that in 1974, Congressional hearings were held,
and warning labels on albums were proposed. The publicity had the opposite
effect that the critics were seeking because more and more bands began
inserting silly, insulting, or blatantly provocative “satanic” messages into
songs, all in reverse. For example, Pink Floyd notoriously included a back-
wards message in the group’s 1979 song “Empty Spaces” that said
“Congratulations. You’ve just discovered the secret message. Please send
your answer to Old Pink, care of the funny farm, Chalfont.”
Laws recommended by Congress were never passed, and the switch from
vinyl albums that could be easily spun backwards to CDs that couldn’t
seemed to kill off the mania. The messages have been rediscovered in recent
years because computers can play back music tracks in reverse with the click
of a mouse. But the terror over subliminal messages seems to have died off.
In retrospect, compared to the straightforward lyrics of Ice-T’s “Cop Killer” or
Cannibal Corpse’s “Meat Hook Sodomy,” it all seems so trivial.
The ten-wiener, eight-bun conspiracy
Here we cover the most devious corporate conspiracy and the question that
has confounded mankind for a century. Why do hot dogs come in packages of
ten, but hot dog buns in packages of eight? If you believe in no other conspiracy
in this chapter, believe this one.
The meat-packing business has been pricing its products by the pound since
the days of Ancient Rome, so it makes sense that the average package of hot
dogs weighs one pound. At the generally accepted wiener length of 6 inches
with a 1-inch circumference, that works out to ten dogs in a one-pound pack.
That is, of course, ignoring foot-longs, jumbos, and other recent innovations that
muddy the computations and needlessly detract from the seriousness of this
issue.
65
Chapter 4: The World’s Most Common Conspiracy 

Bakers, on the other hand, are less transparent in their thinking. Some have
proposed that bakers’ fondness for dozens, or numbers more easily divided
by four, make packs of eight buns because of the mathematical functions of
the power of four. Others say it is because an eight-pack of buns fits more
comfortably on a grocery shelf than ten. Whatever the justifications may be,
we cry foul and see a clear conspiracy at work.
If you’re the sort of consumer that abhors waste, or you have obsessive/
compulsive disorder, there’s just no getting around the fact that you’ll have
to buy four packs of hot dogs and five packages of buns before you have an
equal matchup of 40 of each. It’s a big conspiracy. Everybody knows about it.

Conspiracies Behind the Guns
In This Chapter
 Investigating the queen mother of assassination conspiracies
 Swimming in the Bay of Pigs
 Getting the lowdown on plots against presidents
O
n November 22, 1963, America’s young and handsome 35th president, John
F. Kennedy, was assassinated, riding in an open limousine in Dallas, Texas.
Another passenger, Texas governor John Connally, was injured in the shooting.
Americans were shocked and grief-stricken over the brutal and senseless murder
of a beloved president who embodied the youthful optimism of the 1960s.
These bare facts of the case are the only ones not debated by conspiracists
concerning the death of JFK. Recently, the accusations against the Bush
administration of being behind the 9/11 attacks have, for the first time in over
four decades, pushed the Kennedy assassination off its pedestal as the most
talked-about and debated event in the last hundred years. Whether the 9/11
conspiracies remain at the forefront of the conspiracists’ world view is some-
thing only time will tell.
But for the time being, the handful of books that have been written about
9/11 can’t hope to compete with the over 2,000 books that have been written
about the Kennedy assassination, most from a conspiracy point of view.
Countless documentaries have featured it, and countless films have used the
assassination as a shorthand symbol for the murder of innocence by corrup-
tion. To be a true Kennedy assassinologist, you’d have to give up your day job.
In fact, for baby boomers, those people born roughly from the end of World
War II in 1945 until the heyday of suburban America in the 1950s, the Kennedy
assassination is more than just another historical event — it’s the ultimate
symbol of the smashing of their utopian dreams by The Establishment. And the
conspiracist writers and filmmakers of the baby boom have crafted a truth
that is not to be questioned — that JFK was the victim of a massive conspiracy
to be rid of a president boomers think of as representing their generation.

But was John Kennedy in truth the victim of a dark and complex conspiracy?
And another question, just as important: Were all the other American presidents
who’ve been assassinated really the victims of a straightforward “lone nut
gunman” in the way that history tells us? Both these questions are explored
in this chapter, which covers the conspiracies surrounding the death of JFK,
and the equally suspicious but not so well-known conspiracies behind the
murders of other American presidents.
JFK: The Very Model of a Modern 
Major Conspiracy Theory
The assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy has become the classic “event
conspiracy,” dosed with superatomized growth hormone, creating a many-
tentacled, 40-foot monster. Most people know the bare facts of what happened
that day; the images are woven into the very fabric of our culture. But in case
your knees don’t creak and you still have all your own teeth, here’s a brief
outline of the facts. Skip over it if you know it all, and meet us at “Taking style
over substance.”
Just the facts, please
President John F. Kennedy arrived at Love Field in Dallas around 11:40 on the
morning of November 22, 1963. He was making a goodwill tour, preparing for
the next election, and trying to shore up support amongst some renegade Texas
Democrats. He was scheduled to give a speech at the Dallas Trade Mart. The
route of the presidential motorcade had been published in the newspapers.
At about a minute before 12:30, as the open limo cruised down Elm Street,
shots rang out from the eight-story Texas School Book Depository as the
motorcade passed. Eight stories was the limit on building height in Dealey
Plaza, and the Depository was the highest building in the area. Chaos and
screaming erupted.
Three shots were fired. The first was the one that probably missed, causing a
shard of concrete to cut the face of bystander James Tague; the second passed
through the president’s back, out of his neck, and into Texas governor John
Connally; and the third struck the president in the back of the head, exiting
on the right side, horrifically blowing out blood and tissue in a cloudy red
mist as it did so, all of which is captured on a famous 8mm home movie shot
by Abraham Zapruder. The motorcade rushed to nearby Parkland Memorial
Hospital, but it was, for Kennedy, hopeless. Governor Connally survived, but
the president was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m.
68
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

Vice President Lyndon Johnson, who’d been farther back in the motorcade,
was rushed aboard Air Force One and flown to Washington, D.C. In the wake
of the Cuban Missile Crisis, there was fear in Washington that this was only
the first blow in a Russian attack. Responding to this aura of national emergency,
Johnson was sworn in as the new president almost at once, while the plane
carrying him, as well as Kennedy’s body and his widow, was safely in the air.
Lee Harvey Oswald
Many witnesses who heard the shots claimed having seen the shooter through
the sixth-floor window of the Book Depository. Cops arrived at once. The
supervisor said that only one employee was missing, a man named Lee
Harvey Oswald. Soon afterwards the rifle used in the shooting was found
carelessly hidden behind some book boxes that had been set up into a
sniper’s nest. An APB went out at 12:45 for a slender white male seen leaving
before the area was cordoned off.
At about 1:15, a Dallas police officer named J. D. Tippit spotted Oswald and
stopped to question him, as he fit the description. Emerging from his car, he
was shot by Oswald with a .38 pistol. Oswald hit him three times in the chest,
then purposely walked toward him to fire a final shot into the downed officer’s
head. Twelve people witnessed the shooting, so Oswald would not be free for
long. He ran from the scene, ducking into the nearby Texas Theatre cinema
without paying; the ticket clerk phoned the police. He was arrested at the
theatre for the Tippit murder by a large number of cops, one of whom he
attempted to shoot.
Police didn’t realize at first that this was the same man who’d shot the president.
Oswald was taken into custody on suspicion of having shot Tippit; later that
night he was questioned about the assassination. Over the course of two
days he denied everything, including eyewitness reports that had seen him
with a rifle-sized package that morning at work, a package that he claimed
contained curtain rods.
Once Oswald’s identity was established (he’d had two different sets of ID on
him with different names), his story began to emerge. Lee Harvey Oswald
was a loner, a loser, an ex-Marine, and a passionate Marxist who’d lived in
Russia for three years and had a Russian wife. He’d garnered a little
newsprint for that, and for his work for a pro-Castro organization called the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee. After his arrest, he was arrogant and cold as
ice. Oswald liked big, important-sounding words. But when he was paraded in
front of the press, his Gomer Pyle accent and his lack of a formal education
(he never got past the eighth grade) gave a “jailhouse lawyer” tone to his
bland protests that he hadn’t done anything except suffer police brutality.
69
Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns

Two days after the shooting, on national television, the assassin was assassi-
nated. Oswald was handcuffed to an officer, Detective Jim Leavelle, to be
moved to the Dallas county lockup, when Jack Ruby, a strip club owner who
regularly hung out with the cops at the station, stepped forward and fired
once; he was taken down to the ground before he could fire again. It was the
first murder ever seen live on national television. Oswald died at Parkland
Hospital a little after 1:00 p.m.
Examining the conspiracy background
Almost immediately, public opinion was fixed that there had been some kind
of conspiracy surrounding the shooting. The assassin had been “silenced”
before he could talk, and Jack Ruby must have had a secret motive. To under-
stand, in the perspective of time and place, what that motive might have
been, it’s necessary to look at the backdrop of the various conspiracies.
70
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
Why didn’t anyone believe the Warren Report?
A fair question — why didn’t anyone believe the
Warren Report? The answer’s pretty simple —
virtually nobody actually read the Warren Report.
Or very few did, anyway. But lots of people read
the ever-increasing number of conspiracist books
that said the report was garbage, and if you say
something’s garbage often enough, people begin
to believe it.
The Warren Commission that delivered the report
was made up of squeaky-clean and powerful men,
and was named for its head, Supreme Court Chief
Justice Earl Warren. It was commissioned by
President Johnson with the best intentions. Many
people, including Johnson, felt there was a prob-
able conspiracy behind the shooting, and it might
lay at the doorstep of the KGB, Russia’s far-more-
powerful-than-ours version of the CIA. But
Johnson played politics, wanting it done in ten
months, before the next election. That disap-
pointed a lot of people, who felt that the admirably
bipartisan committee should be above such
things as elections. If they’re not, why have a
bipartisan committee? On the other hand, ten
months is a long time for hundreds of people to
work on an investigation; it seems absurd when
its critics say it was slapped together.
The Warren Report is extremely valuable
because it’s contemporary to the events. In other
words, it says in black and blue exactly what the
witnesses said after the shooting, rather than
what the witnesses were saying 20 years later.
That’s important, because as conspiracism took
the assassination for its own, there were
absolutely tectonic shifts in the stories of many
witnesses. The more attention they got, the more
colorful their story became.
In the end, the report is nearly 900 pages long, with
many other volumes relating to evidence — 26
volumes in all. But it’s an excellent piece of police
work, with examinations of over 3,000 pieces of
evidence, and over 25,000 interviews. In the end,
you should read The Warren Report before pass-
ing judgment on it. Okay, it’s not exactly a Tom
Clancy novel. It reads like what it is, a police
report, one with elephantitis. But it shouldn’t be
dismissed out of hand, especially since the major
government investigations since have never dis-
proved the basic facts of the report.

Lots of important things happened during the three years of JFK’s presidency;
this wasn’t a boring administration, like say, the Calvin Coolidge years. The
president had appointed his brother Robert as attorney general, and together
they’d gone after the Mafia and organized crime. But of all the national and
world events, the overthrow of the government of Cuba, an American protec-
torate, by a Marxist revolutionary named Fidel Castro in 1959 would define
the Kennedy years. Two key events may well have led to JFK’s assassination:
 The Bay of Pigs, the name for a failed attempt on the part of the CIA and
anti-Castro Cubans, in April of 1961, to lead a small invasion force into
Cuba and free it from Castro’s iron rule. John Kennedy, newly elected, 
had promised to follow through on what had been a plan of President
Eisenhower’s, and give the Cuban rebels the air and naval support they
needed. But unwisely, at the last minute, Kennedy chose not to, fearful of
what the international community would say. Without the air support
they’d expected, the Cubans were left to die on the beach or be captured
and dumped into Castro’s prisons. After years of conspiracist accusations,
the CIA has recently admitted that they drafted the Mafia into helping with
the invasion, since the mob had contacts on the ground and a vested
interest in getting the gambling casinos back that Castro had confiscated
(sorry — stolen). Kennedy’s desertion of the small Cuban force made him
many bitter enemies in the CIA as well as in the Mafia. Kennedy also made
enemies when he had the FBI come down hard on paramilitary groups of
anti-Castro Cubans in America who were running weapons to the island.
 The Cuban Missile Crisis, the name for a terrifying two weeks at the end
of October 1962. There were several close calls during the Cold War, but
this was the nearest the world ever came to all-out nuclear war. Ever
since the Russians had gotten the nuclear bomb, a Cold War had raged
between America and the Soviets. There may not have been shots fired,
but fingers were on the triggers. On October 14, a U-2 reconnaissance
plane, flying at 7 miles above Cuba, got photographs of nuclear ballistic
missiles on launch sites being built by the Russians, Castro’s allies. They
were pointed at the U.S. – 36 missiles, with 250 times the power of the
Hiroshima bomb, now 80 miles off our coast, with all the cities of America’s
eastern seaboard, including Washington, less than ten minutes from
potential annihilation. It was an intolerable situation, and on the night of
October 22, President Kennedy addressed a frightened public to say that
Cuba was to be ringed in by a tight naval blockade. It was a game of
nuclear chicken, and finally, on October 28, Nikita Khrushchev, Stalin’s
successor, capitulated, getting a secret promise in return from Bobby
Kennedy that our missiles near the Soviet Union in Turkey would be dis-
mantled, helping Khrushchev to save face in Russia.
These two events would form the backdrop, along with the growing war
against the communists in Vietnam, for decades of Kennedy assassination
conspiracies.

Taking style over substance
The speculative books written about the Kennedy assassination are the absolute
ultimate in conspiracist literature. Three thousand years ago, Greek playwrights
loved to do plays about tragedy growing out of revenge. The Greeks were
very big on revenge. But in the killing of John Kennedy, there was enough
potential revenge for a hundred Greek tragedies.
In the end, out of the darkness of chaos, comes . . . more chaos. So, to save
you having to read a couple thousand of these tomes, here is a brief list, by
no means complete, of the most common conspiracy theories out there:
 There was more than one assassin. Oswald did not shoot alone; there was
another, or several other, shooters. More than one means a conspiracy.
 Oswald was not really Oswald. He was framed. A political assassin
simply “borrowed” Oswald’s identity, perhaps before his return to the
U.S. from Russia, and left clues that led to the real Oswald. When Oswald
was arrested, he had no idea why.
 Lyndon Johnson wanted Kennedy dead so he could be president.
Johnson was in danger of Kennedy dropping him as his vice-presidential
running mate in the 1964 election. And the murder happened in Johnson’s
home state of Texas, which spiced the conspiracist stew.
 The Military Industrial Complex wanted Kennedy dead so they could
escalate the Vietnam War. And presumably make millions of dollars.
 The CIA wanted Kennedy dead out of revenge. Cheeks still red over
the Bay of Pigs, they wanted payback.
 The Communist Cubans wanted Kennedy dead out of revenge. The
U.S. had tried to invade Cuba, and the CIA had tried to kill Castro. It
seems logical they might have wanted Kennedy dead before he could
pull anything else on them.
 The anti-Communist Cubans in exile in America wanted Kennedy
dead out of revenge. If he had properly backed the Bay of Pigs operation,
they would have gotten their homeland back. Also, Kennedy was cracking
down on freelance paramilitary operations of the anti-Castro set. This
really burned them up, after his “betrayal” at the Bay of Pigs.
 The Russians wanted Kennedy dead out of revenge. Kennedy had won
the nuclear standoff with Kruschev and humiliated the Soviet Union.
 The Mafia wanted Kennedy dead out of revenge. So did the labor
unions. JFK’s brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, had spent
two years going after the Mafia bosses and organized crime, along with
their links to powerful labor leaders like Jimmy Hoffa. Killing Kennedy
would get both men off their collective backs.

 Sam Giancana wanted Kennedy dead out of revenge. Giancana, the
heir of Al Capone and head of the Chicago Mafia, otherwise known as
“the Outfit,” said that Joe Kennedy, JFK’s father, who had Mafia contacts
from his prohibition days as a rum-runner, drafted him into helping get
his son elected. And, when Giancana was called before the Kennedys’
congressional committee on organized crime, he felt personally betrayed.
 Richard Nixon wanted Kennedy dead out of revenge. JFK and Nixon
had run against each other in the 1960 presidential election. Nixon lost
by the tiniest margin in history at the time, and he believed what lots of
historians believe, that he only lost because Kennedy looked better than
he did on TV. In fact, Nixon had been in Dallas the morning of the shooting,
attending a Pepsi Cola board of directors’ meeting with actress Joan
Crawford (who was a member of the board).
 The Jews did it out of revenge. Always a favorite. Kennedy opposed
Israeli nuclear programs, and was using former Nazi rocket scientist
Werner Von Braun as part of the NASA space program, which enraged
Jews. “Jewish bankers” were also upset because of Kennedy’s tinkering
with the Federal Reserve. Oswald assassin Jack Ruby’s real name was
Rubenstein, which was proof enough of a Jewish conspiracy for groups
like the racist John Birch Society.
In the months after Kennedy’s death, roughly two-thirds of the American
public believed it had all been part of a conspiracy. Now, decades later, more
Americans believe this than ever before. In fact, as Gerald Posner points out
in the preface to his book Case Closed (1994, Anchor), the conclusion that
both Oswald and Ruby were glory-seeking nut cases who acted on their own
has become far more controversial than anything in the 2,000 books on
Kennedy conspiracies.
Considering the source
There’s no question that the most influential of all conspiracism related to the
Kennedy shooting came late to the party — Oliver Stone’s Oscar-winning 1991
film JFK. The most remarkable thing about this murky melodrama is that it
manages to incorporate all the above theories, and even more, in a confusing
melding of fiction and fact served up with an aura of documentary truth. It
was based on two books: On the Trail of the Assassins, the memoirs of New
Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed
Kennedy, by assassinologist Jim Marrs. No book that did not take a conspiracist
viewpoint was given credit.
If we took the time to tear apart every deception, fib, whopper, misrepresen-
tation, obfuscation, misdirection, or artful piece of propaganda, we’d all be
here until Oprah gets cancelled. But we would like to address some of the real
humdingers, because so much of what is in the film has become “common
knowledge” and is taken as fact — when it is anything but factual.

Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns

Director Oliver Stone chose to build his story around the disastrous prosecu-
tion of businessman Clay Shaw in New Orleans in 1967 by “crusading” district
attorney Jim Garrison, on the charge of conspiring to assassinate President
Kennedy. This all happened in New Orleans, the Big Easy. But even in a city
that prides itself on colorful and shady public figures, District Attorney Jim
Garrison was over the top. Considering the flimsy evidence, the whole thing
played more like the Salem witch trials. It bankrupted Shaw and blackened
his name forever. Yet Garrison failed, big time, to get a conviction. (The jury
was out for less than an hour — one juror said they could have gotten back
faster, but several had to go to the bathroom.)
The pansy plot
The most distasteful aspect of Garrison’s prosecution had to do with his feel-
ings about gay men. Homosexual panic, perhaps, since several people in New
Orleans, and even columnist Jack Anderson, spoke of Garrison’s secretive
passes at young boys. After his arrest of Clay Shaw, Garrison told newspaper-
man Jim Phelan of The Saturday Evening Post that, since David Ferrie was gay,
and so was Clay Shaw, it was obvious they knew one another. (Don’t all gay
men know one another?) He said it was obvious as well that both Ruby and
Oswald were gay. Then Garrison made the incredible statement that the
murder of Kennedy was a gay thrill-killing, like the infamous Leopold and
Loeb case. It was only later, when he discovered that calling them “fascists”
played better in the press, that Garrison accused the men of being part of a
CIA/military industrial complex-conspiracy instead. However, he had no evi-
dence against Clay Shaw either way; he once told Jim Phelan that Shaw
wasn’t the first man he’d arrested, and then built the case. Really scary.
As the investigation progressed over the course of two years, Garrison sus-
pected just about everybody, and came to believe that his own gut instincts
were all the evidence he needed. Even before he had Clay Shaw arrested,
Garrison claimed that he had solved the case. He then spent two years
promising a trial that would shake America to its foundations. In the end, the
trial was a rather embarrassing flop.
None of Garrison’s stirring speeches as delivered up by Kevin Costner in the
movie-land courtroom are real; they were scripted by the screenwriters.
The film JFK accomplishes one thing beautifully; it efficiently piles just about
every major conspiracy theory about the Kennedy assassination into one
easy-open package, which makes our job of analyzing those theories a whole
lot easier. So here, in no particular order, are some of the worst of the delu-
sional piffle in JFK:
74
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

 New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison was a hero for getting to
the bottom of the real conspiracy. Jim Garrison was many things, but a
hero wasn’t one of them. Yet, in the film JFK, the carefully crafted image
of Garrison, as played by Kevin Costner, is the all-American “aw, shucks,
ma’am” innocent, crusading against evil, beloved by his staff, shy with
reporters, disdainful of fame, fixed only on the ideal of justice. The real
Jim Garrison, according to many who knew him, was a hellion with his
staff, a paranoid, an opportunist who loved publicity, and a man
obsessed with the Kennedy assassination to the point of mania. Not con-
tent with the dull and ordinary “second shooter on the grassy knoll”
conspiracy theory, he finished by claiming at least 16 gunmen in Dealey
Plaza, which would have looked more like D-Day than an assassination.
 There is overwhelming evidence that three men in New Orleans were
part of a right-wing CIA plot to oust Fidel Castro and were behind the
assassination of President Kennedy. There is no evidence whatsoever
to back up this assertion. The three men, David Ferrie, Guy Banister, and
Clay Shaw, were never proven to have CIA ties, or to have known
Oswald. None of these three men were anything like they’re portrayed in
the film. The shocking truth is that Garrison’s entire case rested on a
couple of half-baked witnesses who claimed to have seen the men party-
ing together with Lee Harvey Oswald, and to have overheard them dis-
cussing the assassination of Kennedy.
 New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw was the mastermind of the
whole Kennedy plot. Clay Shaw was in fact a highly decorated World
War II veteran, the founder of the International Trade Mart for the Port
of New Orleans that brought the city a business renaissance, and the
force behind the historical renovation of the French Quarter. The fact
that he did some intelligence work for the OSS (the precursor to the CIA)
during the war in the 1940s hardly proves that he was some sinister spy
for rogue elements of the CIA.
 David Ferris, one of Garrison’s “witnesses,” is portrayed as having
been murdered. He died a natural death of a brain aneurysm, which
was proved again with a new autopsy in 1992. His aneurysm could not
have been in any way induced by murderers. Nor did he commit suicide.
However, he had been in poor health, and more than one of his friends
felt that the stress of Garrison’s persecution of him contributed to his
death.
 Oswald never owned the rifle; it was mail-ordered by the people who
set him up. As proof, a famous photo of Oswald holding the rifle with
which he killed the president was claimed in JFK to have been a phony.
Not true. The photograph is genuine. Dozens of scientists with no political
axe to grind have proven the photo genuine. Oswald’s wife Marina also
testified to having taken it. Oswald used the same post office box to order
the .38 caliber revolver that was used to kill Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit.

Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns

 Oswald was a far right-winger. Stone makes every attempt to pry Oswald
away from the Left Wing, which Mr. Stone admires, and glue him to the
right wing, which he despises (as if there’s any difference). But Oswald’s
Communism was very real; there’s no evidence at all that it was a front
for right-wing beliefs. He’d been a Marxist since the age of 15. He loved
the way telling people shocked them, in those Cold War anti-communist
days. Also, at 15, Oswald was sent to a shrink, Dr. Hartogs, who noted at
the time that Oswald was cold, arrogant, and incapable of getting along
with others, a deeply disturbed boy with a “vivid fantasy life” that could
easily erupt into violence.
 Oswald’s defection to Russia for three years was only a ruse — he was
sent there as a CIA operative. This sounds logical, but there’s no evi-
dence whatsoever to support it. It’s a complete lie to state that the
Marines taught Oswald Russian — Oswald taught himself Russian, and
not very fluent Russian, either. As he grew more unhappy in the Marines,
unable to stand the discipline (Oswald always had problems with
authority), he told all his Marine buddies of the glories of Russia, and
how he was going there someday. They all thought he was nuts, but,
once again, Oswald enjoyed the attention it got him. The Marines didn’t
love him any more than his mother had — he was court-martialed twice.
 Oswald was allowed back into the country quickly and easily because
he was working for U.S. intelligence. It wasn’t quick or easy for Oswald
to come back after defecting to Russia. But the fact is, he had never
given up his American citizenship; the American consulate wouldn’t let
him, feeling he was too young and dumb to make such a decision. Oswald,
disenchanted with life in Russia, was grateful. This meant it only took him
a year to get back, about average for the few cases there were like his.
 Oswald wasn’t violent, and had nothing whatsoever to do with shooting
Kennedy, but was an innocent patsy, pure as the driven snow. Stone
completely omits any mention of the fact that Oswald had already
attempted one assassination, that being the shooting of the rabidly
right-wing major general Edwin Walker. Hardly the actions of an innocent
patsy. Walker was shot at through his dining room window by Oswald
while working at his desk; he miraculously survived when the bullet
missed the target of his head because it glanced over the edge of the
window frame.
 On the day of the assassination, a man fell down in Dealey Plaza with
a phony epileptic seizure, in order to act as a diversion for the police,
then disappeared. The man who had the seizure was named Jerry
Belknap, an epileptic since childhood. He was taken to Parkland by
ambulance, but was never admitted because, like most epileptics, he felt
weak but better after the seizure, and saw no reason to be admitted over
a routine for epileptics.

Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

 To believe in a lone gunman means the “magic bullet” that hit
Kennedy and Connally did impossible acrobatics. In the film, during
the trial of businessman Clay Shaw, Costner/Garrison’s speech about the
“magic bullet” uses two men as models for Kennedy and Connally during
the shooting. But the two are seated at the same level, with the model
for Connally directly in front of the president. Actually, Connally was
seated on a jump seat, farther inboard, lower down, his body turned far
to the right to look over his shoulder as he reacted to the sound of the
first shot (which can all be seen in the Zapruder film). Bullets have a ten-
dency to ricochet, skim, and go where they will. But when the two men
are shown seated as they really were, there’s nothing at all unusual
about the trajectory of the “magic” bullet — it went straight through
them both.
 “Back, and to the left. Back, and to the left.” Garrison/Costner makes
much of this general direction of the president’s body after he was shot,
repeating it over and over to prove the shot came from ground level to
the president’s right, on the so-called “grassy knoll.” If the Zapruder film
is slowed way down, there is a short and violent lurch forward of the
president’s head, before it falls backwards. Real bodies react violently to
being shot, and the Zapruder film shows the body of the president react-
ing as if to an electric shock, in a contortion that’s called a “neuromuscu-
lar spasm.” The president then slowly falls over into his wife’s arms.
Also, Kennedy had long suffered terrible back pain, and he was wearing
a stiff back brace, which probably helped to keep his spine erect,
explaining the strange way he fell over but didn’t seem to slump.
 “The guy couldn’t do the shooting. Nobody could.” Not true. Oswald’s
view from the sixth-floor window was not “through heavy foliage.” For
about two seconds, while Oswald reloaded, the limo drove under the
tree outside the Depository window. Oswald had probably already taken
one shot, and when the car reappeared, he took two more. The
Mannlicher-Carcano rifle (really just a “Carcano”) Oswald used was not
“the world’s worst shoulder weapon.” On the contrary, the Italian
Carcano is similar in design to the efficient German Mauser bolt-action
rifle. The sight on the rifle was not broken, as Stone claims. It had a bad
scrape on the side, and a slight mis-alignment that could have happened
when it was dropped by Oswald behind some other boxes, or while it
was in custody. It’s doubtful this would have ruined Oswald’s shot,
assuming that he used the sight at all. Ballistics tests of the rifle showed
it to be in perfectly good working order, and an accurate weapon.
 The president was really caught in crossfire from three different
directions, which Stone calls “a turkey shoot.” If that were true, then
the president’s car would have resembled the Ford in the finale of Bonnie
and Clyde. But it doesn’t. There is no evidence that more than three bullets
were fired, or that the fire came from more than one direction.
77
Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns

 The parade route was changed at the last minute in order to make it
easier for the assassins to do their evil deed. There was no last minute
route change. Period. The map Jim Garrison cites as “proof” from the
front page of the Dallas Morning News is simply too lacking in detail to
show tiny Elm Street. It follows the route all the way from Love Field. But
in both the Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times Herald, the route
that was laid out in the fine print, street by street, is the one JFK’s
motorcade took.
 The bullet found on the stretcher of Governor Connally at Parkland
Hospital was “pristine.” Not true. It was battered and flattened at the
nose, just as one would expect for the journey it had taken through two
men. The bullet was also a ballistic match for a test bullet fired from
Oswald’s rifle. In the film, Jack Ruby is shown planting this “pristine”
bullet on the governor’s stretcher in order to frame Oswald. But frag-
ments from the bullet were found in the governor’s wrist. How did Ruby
manage to plant those?
 President Kennedy’s brain disappeared after a sneaky and under-
handed autopsy. No. Two technicians at Bethesda Naval Hospital,
where, at Mrs. Kennedy’s request, the autopsy was performed, alleged
that the president’s body had no brain when it arrived there from Dallas.
Ghoulish nonsense. They made this claim many years later, but neither
of them was part of the team that removed the body from its casket. The
doctors on that team have stated categorically that the president’s brain
was where it belonged when his body arrived in Washington. However,
it’s true that the president’s body was buried while autopsy doctors still
had his brain and some other tissue samples. It was given over to Admiral
Burkley, Kennedy’s personal physician, preserved in formaldehyde. The
family wanted it to be buried with the body, and Bobby Kennedy’s biggest
concern was that it would never be displayed publicly. When JFK was re-
interred in 1967 in a new memorial at Arlington cemetery, the president’s
brothers quietly had the brain put back with the body.
 Oswald was not only innocent, but he tried to warn the FBI about the
assassination! Unbelievable hogwash. He hand-delivered a note to an
FBI agent who’d questioned his wife Marina about his trip to Mexico,
when he tried to get a visa to go to Cuba. He said he wanted to fight for
Castro. The note said to leave his wife alone and talk to him if they
wanted to know anything. It takes a vivid imagination to turn this inci-
dent into a warning from Oswald that JFK was about to be killed. There
is no shred of evidence to support it.
 Oswald was a lousy shot. This is the most brazen lie of all. Oswald was
an excellent shot. He killed the president from about 89 yards. His
Marine firing range scores, which are still on file, show him getting 48
and 49 of a possible 50 in a rapid-fire test range where the target was at
200 yards, over twice as far away. These results were with an M-1 that
didn’t even have a telescopic sight. The film says Oswald had less than
six seconds to fire the three “impossible” shots. It also states that FBI
sharpshooters could not re-create his shots. This simply isn’t true. And
78
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

if you’d like something more public than the FBI, look for a CBS 
documentary from 1975 in which 11 volunteer marksmen made the shots
in times ranging from 4.1 to 6 seconds, all without even practicing with
the Carcano. Also, a closer examination of the Zapruder film with
modern computer technology reveals that the first shot was probably
fired at frame 162, the last at frame number 313, leaving a generous total
of over eight seconds, plenty of time to do the job. On film for the
documentary “Beyond Conspiracy,” historian John Lattimer pulled the
shots easily at less than 8 seconds. He was 82 years old at the time.
Oliver Stone, we suppose, had no more obligation to put exact history on film
than Cecil B. DeMille did back in the 1930s. But everyone knew DeMille was
making escapist fun. In JFK, the conspiracist view of history is presented as
irrefutable fact, no matter what movie magic Stone whips up to present it. For
example, when Stone couldn’t get any gun he could find to create the “large
puff of smoke from a gun” that his favored witnesses claimed to have seen
coming from the grassy knoll, he had a special effects guy create the smoke
with a bellows. ’Nuff said.

Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns
ABC proves the single-bullet theory
Oliver Stone claimed in more than one interview
that there was nobility in his distortion of fact in
JFK, for if it opened public debate, it was a good
thing. Yet, Mr. Stone wasn’t too happy with the
reaction of one viewer who wanted to reopen
the debate; namely, newsman Peter Jennings.
Disturbed by the distortions of fact in Stone’s
film, Jennings and the ABC team put together a
powerful two-hour documentary entitled
“Beyond Conspiracy” that would win the pres-
tigious Edward R. Murrow Award for best doc-
umentary. It also put a sharp burr under the
saddle of professional Kennedy conspiracists
like Oliver Stone.
Over the years, as conspiracists controlled the
debate, the words “magic bullet” became an
American idiom for a clumsy lie and a coverup.
But using modern computer technology, in the
skilled hands of Dale Myers, a computer ani-
mator who’d studied the assassination for 20
years, it proved to an overwhelming majority of
viewers that the much-derided “magic bullet”
theory was all too true. The second bullet
passed straight through Kennedy’s neck, into
Connally’s chest, then on through Connally’s
wrist, embedding in his thigh. It’s a bullet kind of
thing to do. The documentary also points out
many other blatant errors of fact in Stone’s film.

Okay, so why did Jack 
Ruby shoot Oswald?
Jack Ruby is the lynchpin of the Kennedy assassination conspiracy. Because
in every other presidential assassination, nobody ever shot the shooter. No
matter what Jack Ruby was, no matter what the circumstances were, it’s
nearly impossible to convince a conspiracist that there’s even a possibility
that Jack Ruby did not shoot Oswald because he wanted to shut him up.
Jack Ruby thought he would be a hero for killing Oswald. He was a strip club
owner, and he loved hanging out with cops. He had a hair-trigger temper,
which earned him the nickname “Sparky,” and he may well have had petty
Mafia ties, but he was no player. He loved to hang out at the police station; it
made him feel important, at the center of things. That’s why he was there the
day before, on the day of Oswald’s arrest — that was a big day in Dallas.
Though of course, conspiracists make much more of his presence.
But Ruby had begun to fall apart psychologically; we have statements of his
ramblings and wild outbursts of temper after the shooting of his beloved
President Kennedy, from his friends, his roommate, his employees, and even
his rabbi. The fact is that Jack Ruby simply doesn’t fit the persona of a Mafia
hit man — ruthless, coolly efficient, virtually invisible. On the contrary, Ruby
would have made an unimaginably lousy choice, because he was the ultimate
loose cannon, all mouth and “Look at me!” bravado. If Ruby killed Oswald for
the Mafia because Oswald was a loose cannon, then the Mafia would have
had to send out another assassin to kill the loose cannon assassin. History
does not record this. History records, instead, that the pathetic Jack Ruby
rotted away in a Texas jail, dying of cancer in 1967.
Although Jack Ruby was the first assassin of an assassin in American history,
he was far from the first potential one. After John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln,
the whole country went a little bonkers, grieving hysterically, and searching
for the killers. In dozens of ugly episodes all across the nation, men were
beaten or even lynched, simply because they fit the description of Booth.
And as for other presidential assassins, by that time law enforcement was a
little more organized. Nevertheless, both Charles Guiteau, Garfield’s assassin,
and Leon Czolgosz, the murderer of President McKinley, had to be kept under
constant, well-armed guard to prevent any frontier justice.
Ruby thought he’d get a light sentence; instead, he got life. It was only as the
years passed and he became ill, and the attention was on him no longer, that
he liked to hint darkly of the forces behind his deed. But no names were
forthcoming, maybe because there were none to give. As a matter of fact, on
December 19, 1967, he made the deathbed statement there was no one else
behind his act, and that there was nothing to hide.
80
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

Does all this mean that we don’t believe it’s possible that there was a conspiracy
to kill Kennedy? No, that’s not what we’re saying at all. And proving a single
shooter in Dealey Plaza, as well as proving it was Oswald, doesn’t mean there
was no conspiracy here. Really, what we’re saying is that the evidence for the
“two lone nuts” theory is every bit as compelling as the evidence for a broad
conspiracy.
If you would like to know more about the Kennedy assassination, especially if
you feel yourself being sucked into conspiracist obsession, read Jim Marrs’s
Crossfire for the conspiracist side, then Gerald Posner’s Case Closed for the
other side. Amidst the literally thousands of books, films, and Web sites on
the subject, these two are the most exhaustive and best researched.
Looking at Other Presidential
Assassinations
Perhaps, when our Founding Fathers decided that what the world needed
was a new kind of government, with no king, they also thought they had left
the problem of revolutions and assassinations behind them in Europe where
they belonged. After all, if you have an election every four years, what’s the
point in killing somebody? You can just wait him out.
And for nearly a century, their logic was right on the money. America didn’t
suffer the shock of a presidential assassination until 1865, with the death of
Abraham Lincoln. After his death, Lincoln was seen as a Christ-like figure, a
sacrificial lamb whose blood healed the wound between North and South.
John Wilkes Booth assumed that he would be a hero in the South for killing
Lincoln. He was not. Instead, he was admired by some, but despised by many
others for his cowardice, shooting an unarmed man from behind, and for
bringing back the ugliness and bloodshed that was finally coming to an end.
Other murdered presidents didn’t really get elevated to permanent sainthood,
not until John Kennedy was killed. Yet, whatever you’ve heard about the
Kennedy assassination, there are far more potential “assassins behind 
the assassin” in the death of Lincoln than that of Kennedy, not to mention our
other martyred presidents. The last half of this chapter takes a look at the
morass of lies and dark intrigues surrounding them all.
Abraham Lincoln
Abraham Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated, and
however it went down, it really was the result of a conspiracy. Just how broad
that conspiracy was is the only question left to history. Afterwards, there was
81
Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns

apparently no one left in the entire District of Columbia who hadn’t said, 
“Mr. President, maybe you shouldn’t go to the theatre tonight.” Yet, there was
other blood spilled that night — assassin John Wilkes Booth had accomplices
spread over Washington, and they were trying to take out the most important
men in the government in one blow. Mr. Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. the morning
after he was shot. The conspiracy theories started about ten minutes later.
The plot thickens
It had begun as another conspiracy entirely, to kidnap Lincoln and hold him
for the release of Confederate prisoners. This scheme was hatched by several
people, including actor and Confederate agent John Wilkes Booth, along with
two of his childhood friends, Samuel Arnold and Michael O’Laughlen. Booth
met Confederate messenger and agent John Surratt in 1864, who was taken
with the plan, and then things began to jell, or so it seemed. Others were
soon drafted into the plot. All this was supposedly in revenge for an attempt
the year before by the Union to kidnap (and perhaps kill — it’s debatable)
Confederate President Jefferson Davis and two key members of his cabinet.
So Lincoln was to be kidnapped, ferried across the Potomac into Virginia,
then held for the release of thousands of Confederate prisoners of war. But
then, after months of failed and foiled kidnap plans, Robert E. Lee surren-
dered at Appomattox Courthouse. An embittered Booth, apparently on his
own, turned the kidnapping plot to assassination. His co-conspirators didn’t
find out until that very day, April 14, that Booth had decided that Lincoln’s
appearance at Ford Theatre that night was the perfect opportunity to kill.
Booth had played the theatre many times; he even picked up his mail there.
The location seemed a godsend. But the squeamishness on the part of some
of the other conspirators to commit political murder caused the night of
April 14 to unfold as a series of blunders.
The only conspirator who didn’t blunder was the determined Booth himself,
of the renowned Booth theatre family. He entered the Ford Theatre with a loaded,
.44 caliber, single-shot Derringer pistol, crept like a wraith to the president’s
box, and fired an iron ball into the back of Lincoln’s head. Like his fellow con-
spirators, he also had a Bowie knife; when one of the Lincolns’ guests in the
box, Major Rathbone, attempted to grapple with Booth, he was stabbed in
the arm.
The president’s single guard that night was a lazy incompetent named John
Parker. He’d picked up his chair from outside the entrance to the box and
moved it far away to see the play; eventually he actually took a gallery seat.
He was never punished for this, which is grist for the conspiracy mill. We have
no record of the proceedings that freed Parker without punishment, but he
was freed, in an atmosphere that could only be called a hanging mood. It’s
been suggested that his defense might have been that Lincoln told him to take
a seat and enjoy the show — this would have been very much in character for
the president.
82
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

Afterwards, Booth leapt from the box to the stage, catching his leg in the flag
draped there, and falling, landing in the worst position for any actor, with his
back to the audience. But he leapt up at once to shout dramatically, “Sic semper
tyrannis!” It’s Latin, the state motto of Virginia, and it means “Thus ever to
tyrants!” Dramatic, huh? This is what happens when actors get involved in
politics. Meanwhile, his co-conspirators were stumbling and bumbling in
their attempts to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State
William Seward.

Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns
“This last was not a wrong, 
unless God deems it so”
The above quote is from John Wilkes Booth’s
diary. Actually, to call it a “diary” is essentially
misleading. It’s not long, and is more than any-
thing else a manifesto, and a bit of a whining
one at that. The diary is simply an 1864 calen-
dar-memo book, which Booth used to jot down
notes. It tells us a lot about the man that no less
than five photographs of lovely ladies were
tucked inside it — Booth was not only secretly
married, he was apparently engaged, as well,
not to mention his other numerous liaisons. He
was the handsomest actor of his day, and the
women were nuts about him.
But conspiracists are far more concerned about
the fact that there are 18 pages (or perhaps
more) missing from the diary. Certain of impend-
ing immortality, Booth had composed a long
declaration on the day he shot Lincoln, sealing
it and stamping it, with the intention of mailing it
to the National Intelligencer, Washington’s
oldest and most influential newspaper. In one of
those quirks of historical fate, about 3 p.m. he
met in the street a friend and fellow actor, John
Mathews, who was appearing in “Our
American Cousin” at Ford’s Theatre that night.
Booth gave the letter to him instead, to be deliv-
ered the next morning to the newspaper. Booth
may have thought that the letter wouldn’t arrive
until Monday, denying him his manifesto
appearing just after the Friday night shooting; or
maybe he feared it might be lost in a shuffle of
gas bills and other, unimportant letters to the
editor. Mathews thought it a bit strange, but
promised solemnly. Then, after the assassina-
tion, and the rage that followed it that night,
Mathews panicked, fearful he might be
arrested. He read the letter through, then
burned it.
Meanwhile, on the run, Booth scanned the
newspapers every day, looking for his manifesto
on the front page. It never appeared, and he
knew something had gone wrong; in the diary
he states that he assumes the government was
keeping it from being published. And so, in ago-
nizing pain, hiding out in swamps and barns, he
jotted some of these same thoughts down in his
little memo book, hoping that at least it might
survive for posterity. Alive or dead, fame is all
that counts for an actor. Although Booth was
once seen tearing out a page to give someone
a note, the missing pages are still one of his-
tory’s great mysteries. But Booth’s diary is no
secret. Anyone can see it on public display in
the Ford’s Theatre Museum in Washington, D.C.

The passionately unhinged patriot
Every school child knows that Lincoln was a saint; but it does seem fair to
point out a few of Booth’s motivations. History has often passed him off as a
loony, even if he wasn’t a patsy. But emotional and unstable as he was, for
Booth, this was a legitimate act of war. After some time to get organized on
both sides, the Confederates had consistently out-generaled the poorly led
Union army, until generals Grant and Sherman were put in charge. Robert E.
Lee was not a messianic figure in the South for nothing — he was ten times
the general that McClellen or Burnside could have hoped to be. Even General
Grant was awed to meet with him at Appomattox, and it was his respectful
reverence for Lee that made the surrender go without a hitch. But only Lee
had surrendered. General Joe Johnston’s army was still fighting Sherman in
North Carolina. (Johnston would finally surrender on April 26, aligning himself
with Lee against the orders of the increasingly irrelevant Confederate president.)
And Lee had just surrendered, on April 9, less than a week before the Lincoln
assassination.
Of course, as commander of the Confederate army, he had this right. Lee
understood that the South was beaten, that she did not have the men or the
resources to do anything but achieve complete self-destruction if the war
continued. But President Jefferson Davis did not agree. He was on the run
that April, with wild plans of guerrilla warfare and counter-attacks, the very
thing that Lee was praying to stop. Whether or not Booth was an agent of
Davis’s, he was very much in the Davis camp — Lee might have surrendered,
but the South wasn’t beaten yet. (If you’re interested in this pivotal moment
in history, pick up a copy of April, 1865 – The Month That Saved America, by
Jay Winik.)
For Booth, as for many Southerners, Abraham Lincoln was a tyrant, attempting
to deny them the right to secede that is guaranteed in the Constitution. He
was a tyrant, suspending the heart of all judicial order, habeas corpus, which
enabled the War Department to arrest and jail thousands of suspected
Confederate sympathizers, without evidence and without trial. Worst of all,
Abraham Lincoln was the man who had ended slavery, a system which Booth
believed to have been the natural order ordained by God. According to Booth,
it was when he heard Lincoln’s last public speech, on April 11, in which he
promised the vote to freed slaves, that Booth decided the president had to
die. The thought of a black man with the right to vote was, for him, simply
intolerable. Also, it was a shock for some, because extending the vote hadn’t
been part of Lincoln’s policy. In a chilling photograph from that day, Booth
can be clearly seen on the balcony above Lincoln during the speech.
The evangelical white abolitionist John Brown led a famous raid on the U.S.
armory at Harper’s Ferry, Virginia, in 1859, attempting to arm a slave uprising.
Robert E. Lee led a force of Marines to put down the rebellion that is often
seen as a prequel to the Civil War. John Wilkes Booth was so outraged by
Brown’s actions that he volunteered for the militia squad guarding him. When
John Brown was hanged on December 2, Booth was standing at the foot of
84

the scaffold. Although, as everyone knows from the Union marching song,
“Battle Hymn of the Republic,” “John Brown’s body lies a’mouldering in the
grave, but his truth is marching on.”
Conspiracy theories galore
Historians, amateur and professional, have been trying to unravel the con-
spiracies behind the night of April 14 for a century and a half. Before the
Kennedy assassination, it was the holy grail of conspiracists everywhere.
There are many minor theories, some from outer space. Conspiracist David
Icke believes it’s even possible that an opium-addled Mary Todd Lincoln shot
her own husband. ’Nuff said. But there are many theories that have been with
us from the beginning:
 Lincoln was assassinated by Jewish bankers like the Rothschilds, for
issuing “greenbacks,” government notes to fund the war, robbing them
of high-interest loans.
 Lincoln’s murder was part of a Catholic plot, particularly a Jesuit plot,
that is clear from the fact that Booth’s co-conspirator, John Surratt, hid out
under an assumed name in the pope’s Swiss Guard after the assassination.
 Several books accused the Knights of the Golden Circle, a secret society
of Northerners on the side of the South. (Northern sympathizers were
often called “Copperheads.”)
 There were numerous theories that Booth had not been the man killed in
the burning barn at Garrett’s farm, but that he survived into old age. Some
claim that Secretary of War Stanton, in on the plot, had a look-alike hastily
buried in the Arsenal prison, and sent the real Booth to India. India?
Are we all taking note of the similarity here with many of the Kennedy con-
spiracy theories listed above? Good. We knew you were on the ball!
The whole Booth family would carry the burden of hatred and suspicion for
years; Edwin Booth, John’s brother and the most respected actor of the
family, got used to being booed off the stage in the early years after the
shooting. But Robert Todd Lincoln’s favorite story to tell in later years was
how, by sheer chance, Edwin Booth had saved his life at a New Jersey rail sta-
tion in 1863, pulling him out from in front of a moving train after he’d slipped
and fallen from the platform.
For historians, there are three key theories that are the most popular:
The Jefferson Davis theory
Although it’s a plausible theory, it may not seem important whether or not
the long-gone Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, had a hand in Lincoln’s
death. But for moderate Northern Republicans, who were trying to keep
Stanton from unleashing a scorched-earth policy on the defeated South after
Lincoln’s death, it was very important. It’s also important simply from the
85
Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns

standpoint of understanding history. If Booth was an agent of the
Confederacy, then other conspiracy theories either gain or loose momentum.
And Booth quite possibly was.
He’d already been to Montreal, Canada, a few months before. This city was a
hotbed of clandestine meetings for the Confederates and their Secret Service.
Booth also apparently made a large deposit, nearly $20,000, in his bank
account afterwards. For the Confederates, Booth would have been an ideal
spy. He’d already proven his loyalties to the South in many ways, including
smuggling quinine and medical supplies past the tight Northern blockade.
Besides, many actors were spies; their movements from town to town in the-
atre troops made excellent cover.
The Andrew Johnson theory
This one claims that Lincoln’s vice president, Andrew Johnson, was behind
the assassination, a not very plausible theory. In the climate after the assassi-
nation, no Southerner was safe from suspicion. It seems absurd looking back,
but Lincoln was barely cold before the finger was pointed at Andrew Johnson
of Tennessee. Johnson had survived the night unscathed, as well as unguarded.
He’d been a Democrat, the party of the South, and the elected Tennessee
governor. When he took an anti-war, pro-Union stance, Lincoln appointed him
military governor of Tennessee. And when Lincoln ran for a second term,
Johnson seemed the perfect running mate to reach out to southern Democrats.
Astonishingly, one of the chief proponents of the Johnson conspiracy theory
was the widowed First Lady. Mary Todd Lincoln hated Andrew Johnson, and
this lady really knew how to hate. The First Lady was an intemperate person,
at times to the point that she seemed emotionally unbalanced. Mary actually
wrote to friends that she suspected Johnson, which seems remarkably irre-
sponsible. She also wrote that a calling card Booth left on the afternoon of
the assassination (Booth and Johnson knew one another socially) was proof
Johnson was in on the whole thing. Actually, it seems pretty clear why Booth
left the calling card — he wanted to know if Johnson would be home that
night, so that he could send George Atzerodt to kill him.
An investigation ensued into whether or not Johnson could have been behind
the assassination. Despite the fact that he was deemed a Southern sympa-
thizer for wanting to carry on Lincoln’s policy of a civilized peace, and con-
versely was trying to backpedal on the Emancipation Proclamation and erode
the rights of “Free Blacks,” both of which enraged Radical Republicans, no
evidence was found against him.
But the Radicals still despised him, and in 1866 they gained control of the
Congress. They tried twice to cook up an impeachment, and the second one,
in 1868, looked like it would get him tossed out of office. The charges were
trumped up over the fact that Johnson had fired the top dog of the Radicals,
Secretary of War Stanton. The impeachment failed, by one vote, that of
Kansas senator Edmund G. Ross. A century later, John Kennedy would devote
a section of his book Profiles in Courage to Ross.
86
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

The most compelling evidence presented to clear Johnson’s name was the
fact that, although Johnson was not attacked, one of the conspirators, George
Atzerodt, had been assigned to kill him, and admitted it. Atzerodt, a native of
Germany, had been brought into the plot because he had experience ferrying
rebels back and forth across the Potomac. One of those rebels was John Surratt.
The lumbering Atzerodt was taken to meet the charismatic Booth, and he was
hooked — he would be the ferryman to take the president into Virginia.
But Atzerodt had not come on board for a murder. When the kidnapping seemed
to be going nowhere, Booth proposed blowing up the White House. At this point,
it should have been clear that Booth was erratic, vain, and just plain nuts. But
Atzerodt followed along, until, literally at the last minute, he was assigned to kill
Vice President Johnson. About ten minutes after Lee’s surrender, the Confederate
agent Surratt fled for Canada, and Atzerodt’s original contact was long gone. Still,
he grudgingly followed Booth’s orders and moved into the hotel where Johnson
lived, the Kirkwood House. The assassination night, he began quizzing the hotel
bartender about Johnson’s habits, which got Atzerodt arrested.
But the fact is, there really wasn’t anything, apart from conspiracy, to arrest
him for; he chickened out completely. In his confession, he said he never
really believed that Booth would go through with killing anybody, and that he
couldn’t work up the nerve to kill Johnson. Instead, he stayed in the hotel
bar, got roaring drunk, and wandered the streets of Washington the rest of
the night, too frightened to return to his room.
The Edwin Stanton theory
As for the Edwin Stanton theory, much is made of the fact that the secretary of
war supposedly talked General Grant out of attending the theatre with the
Lincolns that night. The general had already given a tentative yes to the invita-
tion, even though his wife was anxious to move on to New Jersey to see their
children. Stanton suggested that the situation was still too unstable for the
general to safely appear in public; he’d intercepted assassination threats. When
Grant replied that this was certainly more true for the president, Stanton dis-
missed it with an airy hand, saying that he was tired of warning the president.
In all fairness, Stanton had warned Lincoln away from appearing in public.
But conspiracists say that the real reason Stanton wanted Grant to stay away
was that the general never went anywhere without a military guard. Actually,
the real reason that Grant was just as happy to get out of going that evening
was not because he was acting under Stanton’s “orders,” but because his
wife, Julia, had had several unpleasant scenes with Mary Lincoln, and wasn’t
looking forward to spending an evening with her. The First Lady strikes again!
And so Rathbone was invited in the Grants’ place. In a rather creepy and
little-known epilogue, someone attempted to break into the Grants’ compartment
on the train that night. This, too, might indicate a much broader conspiracy
than is known to history.
87
Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns

The first book to take the Stanton-was-behind-it theory was written by Otto
Eisenschiml in 1937, called Why Lincoln Was Murdered. Many others, including
The Lincoln Conspiracy, followed in his wake. But to tell the truth, much of the
“evidence” against Stanton in these sources is pretty circumstantial:
 The fact that Stanton wasn’t targeted that night.
 The fact that Stanton had the most effective communications and spy
network in the nation. Many have put forward the theory that he probably
had some knowledge of the assassination beforehand.
 The fact that Stanton refused Lincoln’s request that his powerfully built
second-in-command, Major Thomas Eckert, accompany them to the theatre
that night; he said he had business that evening and needed Eckert.
 The fact that Stanton had Booth buried secretly and without ceremony in
the Arsenal Prison yard. But his reason given, that he wanted no mourners
or potential hero’s monument for the murderer, seems reasonable. (Later,
the body was exhumed and proven to be Booth’s.)
The fate of all the rest
With Booth dead, four conspirators were hanged on July 7, 1865:
 Mrs. Mary Surratt: Although Maryland was officially Union, this slave-
holding border state was loaded with Confederate sympathizers. This is
partly what got Mary Surratt hanged, though her execution is commonly
seen today as a miscarriage of justice. While her husband was alive, the
Surratt tavern was ground zero for local Confederate agents. It was only 13
miles from Washington. After being widowed, Mary moved to one of her
last remaining assets, a townhouse in Washington, and turned it into a
boarding house. However, there is evidence against Mary. There’s no
doubt that her boarding house was a meeting place for all the conspirators,
and little doubt she knew what was coming. Also, when Booth and
Herold fled Washington, they met at the old Surratt tavern, now run by
one of Surratt’s creditors, a John Lloyd, who gave them weapons, whiskey,
and field glasses left with him earlier that day by Mary, according to his
testimony. It should be noted that much testimony at the tribunal was
rather ruthlessly coerced. Mary Surratt was the first woman ever hanged
by a federal court. Yet, even the brutal Paine (see next bullet) insisted
until his death that Mary was innocent, pleading for her life.
 Lewis Paine: It seems bizarre that Mrs. Surratt would die next to a man
like Lewis Powell (aka Lewis Paine, the name under which he was exe-
cuted), whose brutality that night was worse than anyone’s. Paine was a
former soldier and probable agent of the Confederate Secret Service
who was assigned by Booth to kill the influential secretary of state,
William Seward. Seward was 64 and bedridden at the time, recovering
from a carriage accident. The hulking Paine talked his way into Seward’s
home a little past 10 p.m. holding a large medicine bottle, claiming to have
been sent by Seward’s doctor. He pushed his way into the house and
88
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

assaulted several servants as well as the Seward family; he stabbed a servant
and one of Seward’s sons, and tried to shoot Seward’s other son. When his
gun jammed, he pistol whipped the young man nearly to death, before diving
onto Seward’s bed and stabbing him repeatedly and viciously. Only the
fact that the old man’s broken arm and jaw were in a brace saved his life;
Paine thought that he’d cut Seward’s throat. The attacker then stumbled
out into the street, amazingly having killed no one.
 David Herold: Considered Booth’s chief henchman, he was supposed to
oversee the night’s other two assassinations. Herold had been a school-
mate of Confederate agent John Surratt, Mary Surratt’s son. Herold was
a pharmacist, and may have met Booth when the actor was smuggling
quinine into the South. He knew the city of Washington well, and on the
night of the assassination, he was supposed to escort Paine to Seward’s
house and see that the job was done. Then he was to help Paine escape
across the Potomac. But in the end he chickened out, too. When all the
screaming started, from the whole Seward household, Herold bolted and
left Paine to fend for himself. Later he met up with the injured Booth on the
road to Surrattsville, the town in Maryland named for John Surratt’s grand-
father. (It’s now called Clinton.) Together the two men went on the run.
 George Atzerodt was an unlikely conspirator. Atzerodt had been
brought into the plot to begin with simply because he was such a strong
rower, and knew the Potomac well, traits that would come in handy in
the original kidnapping scheme. Atzerodt was a German immigrant
who’d once been a carriage repairman. He was described by his friends
as good natured, and most important of all, a coward. His own defense
lawyer tried to claim that it was clear Atzerodt was a coward, because
he’d killed no one, and with a lawyer’s inverse logic, the fact that every-
one knew he was a coward should be proof enough that Booth wouldn’t
have assigned him such an important task. The tribunal didn’t buy it,
and the pathetic Atzerodt died with the rest.
Conspiracist fever gripped the North after Lincoln’s assassination, and many
innocent people were arrested — they were lucky they didn’t hang. Men
who’d known Booth, like his two boyhood friends with whom he’d planned
the kidnapping, Arnold and O’Laughlen, were imprisoned, as was the man
whose guilt or innocence has always caused the most debate — Dr. Samuel
Mudd. Many books and films (and descendants) have portrayed the good
doctor as an innocent victim of fate, just an upright Maryland man of medi-
cine who cared for a stranger with a broken leg and ended up being sucked
into the maelstrom.
Nonsense. Booth knew Mudd, of that we’re certain. In fact, it was Dr. Mudd, a
passionate supporter of the South, who first introduced Booth to his key 
co-conspirator, John Surratt. There’s a great deal of conflicting evidence, but
a good guess might be that Mudd knew about the kidnap plan, but nothing
about an assassination. In a document discovered in 1976, part of George
Atzerodt’s confession, he stated that Booth told him he had sent supplies on
to Dr. Mudd two weeks before, in order to aid them in their planned escape.
89
Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns

Mudd was sentenced with O’Laughlen and Arnold to life imprisonment, but
all three were pardoned in 1869 (O’Laughlen had died of a fever by then), the
same year John Surratt was captured, tried, and set free by a hung jury. The
conspiracist fever had waned by then, and apparently, the nation just wanted
to put the whole bloody mess behind them. As for Dr. Mudd, despite being a
slave-owner and Southern sympathizer, there was greatness in the man. In
fact, after the prison doctor died of the same yellow fever epidemic that killed
O’Laughlen, Dr. Mudd took over, and his work was so selfless that the guards
in the prison especially petitioned President Johnson for his release.
James Garfield
The 20th president was the second to be assassinated. He served only from
March to September of 1881. The history books tell us that he was shot by
the classic lone gunman, a madman named Charles Julius Guiteau, on July 2,
1881. Guiteau was the “disgruntled former employee” type, along with being a
religious fanatic. He had expected a post that he didn’t deserve in the new
administration, and when he didn’t get it, he stalked Garfield until he got his
opportunity at the Sixth Street Railway Station in Washington. He approached
the president, who was standing with his secretary of state and, ironically
enough, his secretary of war, Robert Todd Lincoln, son of the assassinated
former president. (Incredibly, Lincoln was also present, though not an 
eyewitness, when President McKinley was assassinated.)
Guiteau shot Garfield twice; one bullet struck the president in the arm, the
other, the fatal shot, lodged in his spine. As Guiteau was fought to the ground
and arrested, he shouted, “I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts! I did it and I want to
be arrested! Arthur is president now!” This is pretty interesting, conspiracy-wise.
The “Stalwarts” were a powerful faction within the Republican Party, the faction
that had kept Ulysses Grant in power, as well as causing the sad legacy of his
corruption-filled administration. Grant himself wasn’t on the take, but just
about everyone around him was, and they all got off scot-free.
In those days, federal jobs and lucrative appointments were handed out
according to a “spoils system,” as a reward to supporters, whether they were
qualified or not. Unfortunately, it’s a system still in place in many counties
and states. The “Stalwarts,” whose day was passing, wanted to retain that
system. When Rutherford B. Hayes beat Grant for the presidency, he had
promised to end Reconstruction and pull Northern troops out of the South,
and to reform the civil service. He was successful at the first, but at the
second, his attempt to give civil service jobs to Southerners outraged his
opposition and tabled reform.
Garfield had promised to pick up the gauntlet. Chester A. Arthur, Garfield’s
vice president, had not been chosen as a running mate because they were
political soul mates — Arthur was chosen to placate the Stalwarts and keep
90
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

the Republican ticket from splitting. The upright Garfield actually disliked
Arthur, knowing he’d been fired from his lucrative position as Collector of
Customs for the Port of New York, for, surprise!, graft and taking bribes. So the
greatest irony is that Arthur went down in history as a good president, 
especially because of his civil service reform.
Garfield didn’t die for an agonizing two and a half months, because his
bungling physicians couldn’t find the bullet, although just about everyone
but the cook came in and tried. Even Alexander Graham Bell designed a metal
detector to find it, but later realized he’d been foiled by the metal frame of
the presidential bed — it hadn’t occurred to him, since most bed frames of
the period were wooden.
When the reason for Garfield’s assassination hit the papers, there was suddenly
an enormous surge of protest over the spoils system. Arthur had no choice
but to back the new “merit” system in Ohio senator George Pendleton’s Civil
Service Reform Act, which created the Civil Service Commission. No more
handing out federal jobs as if they were giveaway key chains. He smiled
through it all, because if politics had taught Chester Arthur anything, it was
how to make the best of a bad bargain. Yet, there are still some historians
who believe it’s entirely possible that Arthur was in some way connected to
the assassination.
William McKinley
McKinley was the 25th president, and the third to be assassinated. Like
Rutherford Hayes and James Garfield, he was another clean-as-a-whistle Ohio
Republican. He was quite liberal in many of his beliefs, including tariffs as a
more fair form of taxation, and an attitude that diversity in the nation and
government was a great thing; his presidency is considered the opening of
the Progressive Era.
The similarities to Garfield of the actual assassination are eerie (see the pre-
ceding section). McKinley was speaking at the Pan-American Exposition in
Buffalo, New York, on September 6, 1901; he stepped down to greet the
public, and standing in the line was one Leon Frank Czolgosz, an anarchist,
with a pistol hidden in his right hand. When McKinley reached out to shake
his hand, Czolgosz fired, striking the president in the shoulder and, like
Garfield, through the internal organs to lodge in his back. Strangely enough,
the first X-ray machine was being shown at the Exposition, but this set of
bungling doctors forbid it for fear of horrific side effects from the newfangled
machine. McKinley died a week later, of gangrene.
Once again, the assassin of McKinley would eventually be termed a “lone
gunman,” and once again, the likelihood of that is pretty low. Czolgosz may
have been alone on the day he shot McKinley, but to think that he planned it
alone is a little naïve.
91
Chapter 5: JFK and Other Presidents: The Conspiracies Behind the Guns

The difference between the Garfield assassination and McKinley’s is that, as
with the assassination of Kennedy, the American people were convinced that
it had been an anarchist plot, despite the assassin’s claims he acted alone.
The cops came down like gangbusters on every nest of anarchists they could
find — they even arrested Emma Goldman, who claimed never to have met
Czolgosz, despite the fact that witnesses had seen her speaking to him a few
weeks before the shooting. But apart from supportive articles in anarchist
newspapers, they could find no evidence to prove a conspiracy. Of course,
that doesn’t mean there wasn’t one.
So, those are some of the bare facts on our other dead presidents. Not one
shooting doesn’t stink to high heaven of some sort of conspiracy. So why is it
only John Kennedy who gets the 2,000 books written about him? Why is it
only Kennedy’s assassination that gets supposedly normal people to watch
92
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
Okay, so what’s an anarchist?
The name comes from the word “anarchy,”
which means, along with “disorder and confu-
sion,” a political state in which no one is running
the government — and this is just what anar-
chists wanted. Its use as a political term dates
to the French Revolution, although the peak of
the anarchist movement was between about
1880 and 1930. Anarchists were initially a secret
society in Russia, called “Nihilists.” The illogic
of the movement is staggering, because most
anarchists of that time were also socialists or
communists, which means they wanted to see a
forced redistribution of wealth. And if you think
people are going to voluntarily give up their
income and belongings without the force of a
very powerful central government, you’re living
in a dream world.
It’s a strange movement to understand, espe-
cially because the classic Anarchist Movement
rose quickly, burned hot, then died out just as
fast. At its height, it was a worldwide terrorist
problem, with other assassinations, including
the Tsar of Russia and the King of Italy.
Leon Frank Czolgosz had been a follower of the
notorious American anarchist Emma Goldman,
portrayed by Maureen Stapleton in Warren
Beatty’s film Reds as a sort of lovable, curmud-
geonly earth-mother. But anarchists were any-
thing but lovable. Their tactic, wantonly killing
anyone in power, was called by them
“Propaganda of the Deed,” and they were intent
on killing every world leader who stood in the
way of their dreamland anarchist paradise
where there was no government and all belong-
ings were held in common. But anarchist vio-
lence was often a series of flubs, utterly
pointless, winning them no friends whatsoever.
Except, usually, it killed a lot of innocent people.
In fact, an anarchist group in Russia called the
“People’s Will” invented the suicide bomber,
taking out dozens of people before they finally
got the Tsar.
Anarchists also invented the car bomb. In their
worst attack on the American people, they set
off a massive carriage bomb on Wall Street in
1920, killing 38 people and injuring over 400; it
was the Oklahoma City bombing of the 1920s,
and the public was just plain fed up. The move-
ment died quickly in part because many anar-
chists drifted into socialist and communist
organizations to escape the heat, but there are
still some around today. Their symbol is a giant
“A” in a circle.

four-hour conspiracist documentaries that spend 15 minutes on a virtually
blacked-out Polaroid that claims to be a photograph of the shooter on the
grassy knoll? And why, after four decades, aren’t people just plain sick to
death of hearing about it?
For the boomers, the assassination of JFK was a national disaster. But any
presidential assassination is a national disaster, a shared shock and a shared
grief. Perhaps this is why the world will always be plagued with terrorists and
dark societies of political murderers — it’s just too easy for the disaffected to
assault the security and peace of an entire nation with one bomb or one bullet.

n this chapter, we move to the deadly serious (and very touchy) subjects
of race and religion. Throughout history, men and women have suffered
because of their faith or their race, and the grim facts don’t seem to allow for
a whole lot of debate. But in the hyperactive, feverish world of conspiracism,
race and religion can give birth to the most outlandish of conspiracy theories,
the ones with the biggest dose of drama. We’re dicing with dementia here, from
the CIA inventing crack to kill African Americans, to those small but loud col-
lections of folks who contend that the Holocaust was a figment of the imagi-
nation of Jews working hand in hand with Hitler. This chapter opens with an
examination of the world’s most universal neuroses.
Picking on the Jews: History’s 
Most Common Blame Game
The modern conspiracy theory and conspiracist mind-set, laid down in influ-
ential books and essays, is relatively new, having grown up since the French
Revolution in 1789, which was often blamed on the Jews and the Freemasons.
This nicely illustrates that all conspiracy theories have grown out of hatred

and fear of the Jews, or hatred and fear of secret societies, initially the
Freemasons (see Chapter 9). In fact, often both, because Freemasons were
many times perceived as the willing tools of “World Jewry.”
All conspiracy theories, right up to the present-day 9/11 ones, are the same
recycled theories that grew from this original source. Only the names of the
accused get changed. And if you accept this as being so, then it leads
inevitably to the next logical question: Why the Jews?
Turning Jews into conspiracy scapegoats
The nation of Israel (divided in two in ancient times, with Israel in the north
and Judah in the south) was conquered many times over the centuries. The
last major conqueror was Rome. In the century before Christ, Rome set up a
puppet state called “Judea,” with a royal Jewish family, the Hasmoneans. In
the year 6 AD, Judea went from a client state to a Roman province, ruled by a
viceroy called a “procurator.” But Judea was in a constant state of turmoil,
and very difficult to govern.
Eventually, in 68 AD, the future emperor Titus, son of the Emperor Vespasian,
led his legions, totaling about 60,000 men, into Judea to subdue it. Jerusalem
was put under a long and bloody siege, and by the year 70, Titus breached
her walls, and the whole city was destroyed. Two more major wars of Jewish
rebellion followed this one, until, in the year 135 AD, the Romans simply
banned the Jews from their homeland. Jerusalem was renamed Aelia
Capitolina by Emperor Hadrian, and for Rome, the problem was solved.

Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
Anti-Semitic semantics
Anti-Semitism is, according to some, a misused
word because Arabs are a Semitic people, as
well. Much of the propaganda in Nazi Germany
used this scheme to deny the persecution of the
Jews — “How can we be anti-Semites, when
we’re so fond of the Arabs?” And it’s true that
some of the most powerful Arabs of the 1930s
were close allies of the Nazis. Of course, the tie
that bound them together was hatred of the
Jews. And the other reason for the Nazi “affec-
tion” for the Arabs is because Germany had an
unquenchable thirst for Arab oil to feed its ever-
hungrier battleships and war planes.
But this is just “semantics,” playing with words
to blow a fog over the issue. Nowadays, the
same sort of people, on the Far Left and the Far
Right, from Louis Farrakhan to Pat Buchanan,
say that they’re not anti-Semitic at all. How
could you say such a thing? They’re only “anti-
Zionists,” meaning that they have nothing
against the Jews, they just hate the nation of
Israel — a free nation and American ally made
up of Jews. See the difference? But in this book,
anti-Semitism means hatred of the Jews,
period. We see no reason to muddy the waters.

For the Jews, the problem was just beginning. This was the wellspring of
what came to be known as the “Diaspora,” the scattering of the Jews to the
four corners of the earth. As a people, they became like the myth of the Flying
Dutchman, always on the move, always ready to be expelled from one country
and refugeed to another. But it’s important to remember that, despite Roman
decrees, a Jewish presence would always be in Jerusalem and the surrounding
countryside. Jews in the Middle Ages made pilgrimages to the Holy Land, just
as the Christians did, and many Jews asked to be buried there upon their death,
if their family could afford such a journey. It was more than just empty ritual
when Jews finished every Passover Seder, as well as the ritual for the holy day
of Yom Kippur, with the words, “Next year in Jerusalem.” Yet, despite this love
that burned for 2,000 years, the days of a Jewish homeland surrounding the
sacred Temple Mount were over.
A love of Jerusalem and refusal to give up their ancient faith kept the Jews a
people apart. But the upshot of the Diaspora was that just about every country
had at least some Jews. And this is part of the key here. Just about everybody
has some Jews. And it’s that very universality of the Jewish community that
has been one of its greatest assets, and one of its greatest handicaps. Everybody
could gripe about the Jews. And once a really good conspiracy theory about
them took hold in one country, it could easily move to the nation next door,
without even bothering to erase “Jews” and substitute “Estonians.”
Actually, the very fact that they seem to be everywhere becomes one more point
of paranoia in the conspiracist playbook. The communal Jewish experience
has been pretty much the same the world over, and this very sameness has
made Jew baiting an international pastime. There’s a story of the visit of the
Japanese war minister to Germany, just before the signing of the Tri-Partite
Pact in 1940 that allied fascist Germany with Japan and Italy. As the Japanese
minister was shown the capital of Berlin, seeing its rebirth from the ashes of
defeat and economic disaster after World War I, and seeing how the new Aryan
nation had united beneath the banner of racial superiority, he’s purported to
have said, “I agree, it’s a wonderful system. The problem is, we don’t have
any Jews.”
The Dark Ages get darker
During the 1100s, a superstitious Christian Europe began to believe that the
Jews were more than deniers or killers of Christ; they were downright sinister.
The “blood libel” was born, which is the belief that Jews murdered Christians,
especially babies, and used the blood in their “rituals.” In towns across France
and Germany, whole communities of Jews were burned at the stake by hysterical
Christians. Anything from a plague of locusts to a cholera epidemic could get
blamed on the Jews. Christians were dying of fever because the Jews desecrated
the communal host eaten in the mass, putting a curse on it. (Of course, people
were really dying of fever because their sewage contaminated their own water
supply.)
97
Chapter 6: Racial, Religious, and Apocalyptic Conspiracies

Jews were famous for their knowledge of medicine, but this, too, was turned
against them, twisted into knowledge of alchemy and witchcraft. All it took
was a bunch of drunks in a tavern claiming that someone’s baby had a withered
arm because the midwife had been a Jewess and that started a riot that got
hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of Jews killed.
Straining for righteousness in their cause, some rather absurd anti-Jewish
spectacles grew up in this period. Several times in the medieval world, the
Talmud, a holy book for the Jews, was put on trial. No, not the Jews. Just the
book. The Talmud, of course, always lost and was promptly burned in an equally
symbolic circus. This nonsense began to happen, slowly at first, worsening in
the years of the Crusades (11th to 13th centuries), as anti-Semitism became
more entrenched in the European mind-set. Of course, in Spain they weren’t
burning the book — they were burning the Jews.
By the 16th century, it was common to force the Jews of any city to live in a
separate area, called a ghetto. The word itself is Venetian slang for “their own
Jewish Quarter,” which was near the slag heap for the iron foundries of the
city — thus, ghetto, from gheta, Venetian for “slag.” The Germans called it the
Judengasse, the Arabs the mellah, but it’s all the same prison: a section gated
off from the rest of the community where the Jews were allowed to live.
In the ghettos Jews were forced to endure all sorts of humiliating edicts. They
had to wear special clothes or badges; they had to have passes to travel, and
they had to jump through other hoops, like making themselves scarce around
various Christian holidays, especially Easter, when Christians paid homage to
the crucifixion of Christ that they openly blamed on the Jews.
In the earlier centuries of settlement, many Jewish merchants became wealthy.
But by the 12th century, as Jewish oppression worsened, Christians began to
pass laws forbidding the Jews to take part in the normal economic life of the
community. They were banned from the various powerful guilds, each of which
controlled particular professions. If you couldn’t get into the guild, you couldn’t
be a draper, a carpenter, a stone mason, or a vintner. Less prosperous Jews
settled in the artisan trades, such as gold- or silversmiths, producing and selling
their own works; many others became small, pushcart tradesmen. But for the
men with a little capital, pushed out of the guilds, there weren’t that many
ways to make a living left open to them. Being merchants made it easy for
them to slip into both pawnbroking and moneylending (see Chapter 15).
During this period there were many mass evictions of the Jews, from cities,
duchies, and entire countries. The worst was the expulsion of all the Jews
from Spain by the rabidly anti-Semitic Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492. It’s a
sad irony that many of these Jews fled to the nearest refuge, Islamic North
Africa, where later anti-Semitic crusades on the part of the Muslims there
decimated those communities, as well. But it happened just about every-
where in Europe; the English did it twice.
98
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

The Jews as moneylenders
Much of 20th-century anti-Semitism harps incessantly on the subject of Jews
as the “world’s bankers,” controlling the world’s economy and following the
deranged Ku Klux Klan (see Chapter 12) mythology of the “five Jew bankers”
who run everything except pay toilets in airports. We talk much more about
the specifics of these allegations in Chapter 15, but it’s important to know
where these kinds of claims first came from.
The early Catholic Church, based on a very small passage in Luke that’s about
loaning money and not expecting to get it back out of Christian generosity,
interpreted that to mean that they should forbid what they called usury, the
making of money by loaning money. But people from kings to innkeepers still
needed to borrow money.
The Jews, however, didn’t arrive in the Rhine valley and start setting up ATMs.
As early as the sixth century AD, Jews expelled from Judea and pushed out of
the Near East and began to immigrate into Western Europe. In those first, quiet
centuries, no organized form of anti-Semitism in Europe existed. The two faiths,
Christianity and Judaism, often eyed one another with emotions from distrust
to distaste. But apart from that, early medieval kings had too much trouble
hanging on to their property to worry about tension between religious faiths.
Jews worked side by side with Christians, in every profession from masons to
laborers to farmers. Because they could count on the help and support of the
Jewish community scattered the world over, many Jews became merchants. But
they moved down the roads and bought and sold without facing any special
taxes or burdens simply for being Jewish. The 6th-century pope, Gregory I,
even forbade the forced conversion of Jews, as well as any attempt to interfere
with their free practice of their faith.
Extending the blame to the present day
There’s been a great rebirth recently of anti-Semitism and conspiracy theories
blamed on the Jews in Europe, Russia, and the Middle East. It’s still a universal
tie. In the U.S., it isn’t hard to sniff out the obsessive Jew baiting in many of
the “alternative conspiracy theories” offered up by the “Truthers,” for example,
who believe that 9/11 was an atrocity committed by the government (see
Chapter 8). Many common leaders who’ve predominantly associated themselves
with white supremacist groups, like David Duke of the Ku Klux Klan, have
switched over or broadened into anti-Semitism, the scheming Jewish
bankers, and Holocaust denial, which is becoming dangerously popular.

Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
Protocols of the Elders of Zion
One of the most infamous pieces of propaganda
ever devised is known as the Protocols of the
Elders of Zion. In it, a secret meeting is described
of a group of Jews who discuss their world
takeover plans, with the Freemasons (see
Chapter 9) as their accomplices. The document
first According to the Protocols, Jews are behind
a plan for world conquest, and the Freemasons
are their willing stooges. Jews and the Masons
control the press and the courts, and Jewish rev-
olutionaries use liberalism to weaken Christianity
and the State. They use their international bank-
ing power to destroy the economy by taking
countries off the gold standard. Jews and the
Masons control governments from behind the
scenes by blackmailing politicians. And during
times of war, Jews suspend civil liberties and
then secretly make the measures permanent. The
Protocols outline the use of brainwashing,
pornography, alcohol, and drugs to subvert soci-
ety, and the careful manipulation of the illusion of
individual freedom to mask society’s destruction
from behind the scenes.
Here’s the twisted path of the Protocols from
inspiration to current incarnation:
 The Protocols were inspired by Abbé
Barruel’s Memoirs, in which he blamed the
Freemasons and the Illuminati for the
French Revolution. In the early 1800s,
Barruel re-wrote his thesis, shifting the
blame to the Jews.
 In the 1840s, the French author Eugène Sue
trotted the exact same conspiracy story out
again, rewriting it to make the Jesuits, a
Catholic order with an intellectual and inter-
nationalist bent, into the villains.
 In 1864, Sue was plagiarized by another
French author, Maurice Joly, in a pamphlet
called 
Dialogues 
in 
Hell 
Between
Machiavelli and Montesquieu. Joly’s ver-
sion of the story alleged a conspiracy
between the Devil and Napoleon III, not
Freemasons, Jews, or Jesuits, but it was all
the exact same dialog with a different cast
of bad guys.
 In 1890, a Russian named Mathieu
Golovinsky, living in France, wrote what
became the modern version of the
Protocols. His family was aristocratic mem-
bers of Russian society but lost their for-
tune. Golovinsky apparently blamed the
Jews for his family’s fate, and embellished
the Protocols, expanding the story to detail
how the Jews control banking, wars, and
the world.
 The Czar’s secret police, the Russian
Okhrana, finally picked up the tale and
made the enemies both the Jews and the
Masons, circulating the Protocols as pro-
paganda. It was even ordered to be read
from the pulpit after Orthodox church ser-
vices. In their version, the Jews supposedly
dangle the hope of political freedom in front
of silly, stupid Gentiles to encourage revo-
lution, but have no intention of delivering on
their promise.
 A Russian monk named Sergei Nilus repub-
lished the Protocols in 1905 and announced
after the Russian Revolution in 1917 that they
were really part of the minutes of the 1897
Zionist Congress at Basel, Switzerland. The
congress was actually attended by a number
of Christian clergy and political figures. What
was really discussed at that famous meeting
was the creation of a Jewish organization to
purchase land in Palestine for a Jewish
homeland. Nevertheless, the Russians used
the fictional Protocols as justification for
slaughtering Jews after the Russian
Revolution in 1917.
 In 1919, American industrialist Henry Ford
purchased the Detroit Independent news-
paper for the specific purpose of presenting
his personal anti-immigrant, 

And without a doubt, anti-Semitism as part of conspiracism had its harmonic
convergence in the most important forgery of all time. With the birth of the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion (see the nearby sidebar, “Protocols of the
Elders of Zion”), conspiracy theories that grew out of hatred of Jews and of
secret societies merged, becoming one single conspiracy dogma of unprece-
dented proportions. That’s because, at that point in history, the Jews became
a secret society, bent on nothing less than world domination.
Catholic Conspiracy Theories
No organization that has been around as long as the Roman Catholic Church
could possibly escape accusations of conspiracies. The church has engaged
in its share of wrongdoings and persecutions over the last 19 centuries or so,
and after dominating the Christian world up until the growth of
Protestantism, the church didn’t take encroachment on their spiritual and
secular monopoly lying down.
The flip side was a movement of anti-Catholicism. In the original 13 British
colonies that became the United States, only Maryland allowed Catholics a
degree of freedom to worship freely and own land. Public distrust of Catholics

anti-Jewish, and anti-labor messages to the
public. In 1922, he brought the Protocols to
the American public in serial form. The
series, The International Jew, was widely
reprinted around the world, and some say
it’s how Adolph Hitler became acquainted
with them. He even gave copies away with
new cars. Curiously, Henry Ford was a
Freemason, and edited out unflattering ref-
erences to Masons.
Not long afterwards, when the Nazi party came
to power in Germany, Adolph Hitler used the
Protocols as justification for his plans to exter-
minate the Jews and the Freemasons. A popu-
lar Nazi slogan was “All Masons Jews — All
Jews Masons!” The Protocols have been cir-
culated for over 100 years, and today they can
be found all over the Internet, posted by a wide
range of conspiracist groups. The Protocols
remain very popular in Islamic countries, includ-
ing Egypt and Saudi Arabia, where they’re
handed out as texts for school children to study.
Groups as wildly divergent as the African-
American Nation of Islam, white patriot militia
groups, the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas,
and the American Nazi Party still peddle the
Protocols as fact. Others simply remove the
words “Jew” and “Freemason” from the alle-
gations and substitute words like Neocons,
globalists, or International bankers. And the
truly bizarre David Icke believes that the
Protocols are describing neither Jews nor
Masons, but actually 12-foot tall, shape-shifting
reptilian aliens.
One of the most curious developments in the
history of the Protocols is a comic book version
of their forgery by celebrated artist Will Eisner.
Called The Plot: The Secret Story of the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion, it details the
twisted path of the Protocols in a truly unique
presentation.

in America lasted openly until the election of President John F. Kennedy. In
France, arguments that started during the French Revolution over the influence
of the church over government still are hotly debated today.
Nevertheless, there are more than a few Catholic conspiracy theories that dive
off the deep end. Here are some modern accusations still making the rounds:
 The church has supposedly suppressed evidence that proves Jesus and
Mary Magdalene were actually married to each other, and had a daughter.
After Christ’s crucifixion, Mary and the child fled to France, where Jesus’
bloodline was nurtured for centuries and hidden from the public, by
groups like the Knights Templar, the Priory of Sion, and the modern
Opus Dei. If you haven’t read Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code, we just
ruined the end for you. For much more than can be covered in this book,
see The Templar Code For Dummies (Wiley) for the complete lowdown.
 On November 5, 1605, Englishman Guy Fawkes and a group of Catholic
supporters were caught in London just before attempting to blow up
Parliament and murder King James I. The Gunpowder Plot was seen as a
church-sponsored attempt to restore Catholic rule to a Protestant nation,
and many Catholic priests who had no clue about the plot were imprisoned.
 Abraham Lincoln was supposedly assassinated by the Jesuits because of
an 1856 court case in which Lincoln arranged a settlement between a
priest and the friend of a bishop. During the height of the anti-Catholic
movement in the U.S., a book written in 1897 by a member of the
Assassination Commission alleged that the Vatican was pro-slavery.
 The Vatican is purportedly dominated by Satanists or Freemasons, or
both, who support a one-world government. The European Union is just
the first step in this church-backed scheme.
 Jesuits are really secretly Freemasons who are out to destroy the church
from within.
Besides these, there are a few more serious accusations involving the church
from recent years, which we explore in the following sections.
The 3rd secret of Fatima
Between May and October 1917, on the 13th of every month, three young
Catholic girls claimed to have been visited by a vision of the Virgin Mary in
Fatima, Portugal. Lucia Santos and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto
insisted that on July 13, 1917, the image of Mary gave them three prophecies,
which remained secret for more then 20 years. The location of their vision
instantly became a holy shrine among Catholics, known as Our Lady of Fatima.
102
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

Lucia was the oldest child, and just 10 years old at the time. The Marto girls
both died in a flu epidemic in 1919, but Lucia went on to become a nun and
lived until 2005. In 1941, Sister Lucia revealed the first two prophecies as part
of the documentation needed for the canonization (bestowing sainthood) of
her cousins, but told church authorities that Mary had told her to keep the
third a secret.
 The first secret was a vision of hell, with demons and souls in human
form blackened by fire. The vision of Mary assured the girls they’d be
taken up to heaven.
 The second secret predicted the end of World War I, but it also predicted
the beginning of World War II, if Russia didn’t end its persecutions and
convert to Catholicism. (Bear in mind that the prophecy wasn’t divulged
until WWII had already begun.)
In 1943, Sister Lucia was gravely ill, and her local bishop suggested that she
write down the third prophecy so it could be revealed in case of her death. It
was sent to Rome, only to be seen by the pope. Lucia recovered, and later
granted permission for the secret to be revealed after 1960. Yet, the church
kept the prophecy a secret until 2000.
The third secret was an image of an assassination attempt against the “Holy
Father.” Many believed it referred to the attempted shooting of Pope John
Paul II on May 13, 1981. But almost immediately, suspicion arose about the
third prophecy.
 The church refused to release the text of the third prophecy in 1960, even
though Sister Lucia approved it. It took 40 more years before it was
made public.
 Cardinal Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, said in 1984 that the release
of the secret dealt with the “end times,” and would cause a sensational
reaction with the public if it became known. Given the attempt on John
Paul II occurred three years before Ratzinger’s statement, it’s hard to
understand his claim.
 The Vatican had a longstanding policy forbidding any Catholic who’d
seen sacred visions from making public statements without the specific
approval of the church. This was rescinded in 1966 — except for Sister
Lucia. She was sworn to secrecy until her death in 2005, forbidding her
to even discuss what had been officially released by the church.
“The Fatima Crusader,” a newsletter published by a fringe group led by Father
Nicholas Gruener, has long alleged that Sister Lucia died in the 1950s and was
replaced by an imposter. The group believes that the church’s reforms in the
1960s, known as Vatican II, were engineered by Communists and Freemasons
within the church, and that these evil insiders have purposely hidden the true
third prophecy that would’ve exposed their nefarious schemes.
103
Chapter 6: Racial, Religious, and Apocalyptic Conspiracies

Pope Pius XII and the Nazis
One of the most common conspiracy theories of the 20th century concerning
the church is that Pope Pius XII supported the Nazis during World War II, and
aided Nazi war criminals in fleeing Europe by using the worldwide network of
Catholic Relief Services. While the war was raging, Catholic priests were
tossed into concentration camps, and the pope in Rome was surrounded by
fascist Italy, Hitler’s allies. Pius XII attempted to keep the church politically
neutral, but in 1939 was threatened by Mussolini over communication with
leaders of nations invaded by the Nazis. In response to the threats, he told
the dictator’s foreign minister that he was ready to be deported to a Nazi
camp, rather than violate his own conscience.
Throughout the war, Pius XII generally refused to make public statements
against Axis policies and activities. Even when faced with incontrovertible
evidence concerning Nazi atrocities against Jews, gypsies, homosexuals,
Freemasons, and others, the church’s public policy was usually one of silence,
as a matter of self-preservation. Privately, however, this was another issue.
 In 1939, the pope personally arranged for 3,000 visas for “non-Aryan
Catholics” to leave Germany for Brazil, as a way to smuggle Jews out of
the country. Brazilian authorities cancelled the program a year later
once they discovered the truth.
 Within Rome itself, the pope secretly ordered all convents and monasteries
to hide Jews.
 The church instituted a policy of quietly baptizing orphaned Jewish chil-
dren as Catholics to save them from deportation to the camps.
 In 1943, when Germany occupied Northern Italy, the pope offered to use
church gold to ransom Jewish-Italian hostages.
 In 1944, the pope privately appealed to 13 Central and South American
countries to accept “emergency passports” from Jews fleeing Europe.
 When the war ended, the church assisted in resettling 6,000 Bulgarian
Jewish children into Palestine, while publicly declaring that the Vatican
wasn’t a supporter of Zionism.
After the war ended, there is evidence that some Nazis and Nazi sympathiz-
ers really were shielded by the church, especially in countries that were swal-
lowed up by the Soviet Union. And it’s assumed that Pius XII looked the other
way because the officially atheistic Soviets were considered a greater threat
to Christianity and Catholicism than the defeated Germans and their Eastern
European helpmates. Meanwhile, Pius XII became an immediate advocate for
the release of all war criminals and the commuting of all death sentences against
Axis officials. Nevertheless, Israeli diplomat Pinchas Lapide stated in the 1960s
that Pius XII saved between 700,000 and 860,000 Jews during the war.

Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

The Vatican Islam Conspiracy theory
Fundamentalist Christian comic-book artist Jack Chick has become infamous
for his “Chick Tracts,” tiny comic booklets that get slipped onto grocery
shelves, under windshield wipers, into airliner seatbacks, and into every
other nook and cranny that his many fans can find. Each one tells a little
morality tale on a wild variety of subjects, with an evangelical message. He is
a strong purveyor of a wide range of conspiracy theories, and in many cases,
he is the source of a few popular ones. One of the most notorious is the
Vatican Islam Conspiracy.
Chick’s tract “The Prophet” alleges that the Roman Catholic Church invented
the Islamic religion by manipulating events that swirled around its founder,
the prophet Mohammed. The goal was to use the followers of Mohammed’s
new religion to eliminate Jews and non-Catholic Christians. Because the
church supported Mohammed, so the tale goes, it was supposed that he and
his armies turned over control of Jerusalem to the Vatican, as the pope’s will-
ing stooge. But Mohammed’s victories were too swift and great, and he
rebelled against his Catholic masters. The medieval Crusades were an
attempt to crush the forces of Islam and bring them back under Catholic con-
trol, but Christian forces were unable to beat the Muslims. Exciting, isn’t it?
Of course, there is absolutely nothing to back this story up, historically or
archeologically, on paper or anywhere else. It all seems to have sprung from
the mind of Alberto Magno Romero Rivera, a purported ex-Jesuit priest.
Rivera was a Spanish anti-Catholic who claimed to have left the priesthood in
the 1960s when he “discovered” that the church was controlled by
Freemasons. Investigation of Rivera and his biography revealed him to have a
long history as a swindler and a colossal liar. There is no record of him ever
being a priest, much less a Jesuit, and his supposed degrees in theology were
mail-order ones. He claimed that the Jesuits threw him into a secret Vatican
madhouse and tortured him, before he escaped and rescued his own sister
from a London convent where she was near death.
It turned out that none of his story was true. Nevertheless, his biggest supporter,
Jack Chick, believed every word and featured Rivera as a character in many of
his comic tracts. Meanwhile, the Vatican Islam Conspiracy has taken on a life of
its own and is widely circulated in the evangelical Christian community.

Islamic Conspiracy Theories
The overwhelming number of conspiracy theories within the Islamic community
involve Jewish or Israeli plots against Muslims. The list is virtually endless,
but here are some highlights:
 AIDS has been spread into the Muslim community via World Health
Organization polio vaccines. This one has been perpetrated by Muslim
clerics in Nigeria and elsewhere, resulting in the spread of a Nigerian
strain of polio (see Chapter 16).
 Israeli scientists created hormone-laced chewing gum to make
Palestinian children sexually promiscuous.
 The 2004 tsunami (tidal wave) in the Indian Ocean that caused thousands
of deaths was created by the explosion of an Indian nuclear device, engi-
neered by Americans and Israelis to kill Muslims.
 The Iranian press service reported in 2006 that 10,000 Russian women
are kidnapped every year and brought into Israel, where they are sold
for as much as $10,000 apiece.
 Western products are continually criticized for bringing non-Islamic
ideas into Muslim culture. Most recently, the film Pirates of the
Carribean, McDonald’s, Levi’s, and Coca-Cola have been singled out as
evil influences. Pepsi, in particular, is alleged to hide within its name the
slogan “Pay Each Penny, Save Israel.”
 Television networks and newspapers in numerous Islamic countries con-
tinue to report the protocols of the Elders of Zion are authentic docu-
ments that outline Zionist treachery against the Muslim world.
 The 9/11 attacks in the U.S. weren’t made by Osama bin Ladin, but by
the Israeli secret service, masterminded by Henry Kissinger.
 Egyptian cleric Hazem Sallah Abu Ismail, a former Islamic lecturer in
America, appeared on Saudi Al-Risala on April 14, 2006, and proclaimed
that United Nations’s studies concluded, “Eighty-two percent of all
attempts to corrupt humanity originate from the Jews.”

The Nation of Islam
Since the 9/11 attacks, Americans have taken a
heightened interest in the Islamic faith. Most
have heard of Minister Louis Farakhan and the
Nation of Islam (NOI). The NOI is known for its
doctrine of black separatism, as well as its
members’ strong commitment to service within
the African-American community. What isn’t
commonly known is the group’s UFO cosmology.
The Nation of Islam was formed in the 1930s by
Wallace D. Fard, who proclaimed the origin of
the white race was an experiment by an evil sci-
entist named Yakub, of the Tribe of Shabazz.
According to Master Fard, the Original Man was
an “Asiatic black man.” Apparently Yakub, it’s
claimed, created a race of white devils by graft-
ing a black germ and a white germ together in his
lab on what’s now the Greek island of Patmos
(where the New Testament’s apocalyptic book of
Revelation was written). The experiment’s result
was the white race, who were destined to rule
the Earth for 6,000 years until the black race
regained power, beginning in 1914.
The NOI also teaches that visions described in
the book of Ezekiel 1:15–18 are actually portray-
ing a UFO and extraterrestrial beings: “Now as
I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel
upon the earth by the living creatures, with his
four faces. . . .”
According to Minister Farakhan’s description of
his

Elijah
Muhammad’s teachings, Ezekiel saw a giant
wheel in the sky called a Mother Plane, origi-
nally built on the island of Japan in ancient
times. This massive, flying wheel is a half-mile
in diameter, containing 1,500 smaller wheels,
with three huge bombs originally used for the
creation of mountains by alien terraforming
engineers. “That Mother Wheel is a dreadful-
looking thing,” says Farakhan. “White folks are
making movies now to make these planes look
like fiction, but it’s based on something real.”
Most other sects of Islam consider the Nation of
Islam heretical. The NOI teaches that Allah came
down to Earth in the person of W. D. Fard, a claim
that could get you stoned to death in some parts
of the Muslim world where just drawing a car-
toon of the prophet Mohammad is blasphemous.
Indeed, it was a trip to Mecca and discussion
with Muslim scholars in Africa and the Middle
East that helped to turn former NOI leader
Malcolm X away from the teachings of Elijah
Muhammad in the early 1960s. Malcolm X
started his own more traditional Sunni mosque
before his murder by members of the Fruit of
Islam, an internal NOI paramilitary group.
The NOI’s widely circulated newspaper, The
Final Call, has been the recurring source of
many outrageous urban legends and conspir-
acy theories perpetrated as fact. While the NOI
gets a lot of press and public attention (often for
Farrakhan’s notorious anti-Semitic rhetoric), it
should be pointed out that a split schism in 1978
resulted in the formation of a far more tradi-
tional Sunni-styled group that is much larger.
The Muslim American Society was created by
former NOI leader Elijah Muhammad’s son,
Warith Dean Muhammad, and doesn’t contain
the NOI’s more extreme and unorthodox Muslim
teachings. It’s bereft of NOI’s flying saucers, not
to mention its virulent anti-Semitism and wild
conspiracy theories about mad Jewish scien-
tists inventing AIDS, and other followers of the
Jews’ “dirty religion” being the biggest group of
slave owners in the South.

African Americans and 
Conspiracy Theories
African Americans in the U.S. have plenty of reasons to be suspicious and
downright distrustful of government officials, going back to the earliest days
of the colonial slave trade. Very real and oppressive conspiracies have been
perpetrated on African Americans over the centuries, from the slave business
itself, to disenfranchisement, Jim Crow laws, the infamous Tuskegee syphilis
experiments (see Chapter 17), and up to the very creepy FBI program 
COINTELPRO (see the following section).
COINTELPRO
One of the most infamous U.S. government operations against its own citizens
was a secret FBI program known by its acronym COINTELPRO (Counter
Intelligence Program). Starting in 1956 during the height of the Cold War, the
program was initially designed to discover and disrupt the activities of the
U.S. Communist Party. The Soviet Union funded Communist Party activities in
America, as well as supported an expanding list of organizations considered
“subversive” by the government. Unfortunately, as time went on and the pro-
gram grew, little distinction was made between groups advocating the violent
overthrow of the U.S. government and those that conducted nonviolent protests
of government policy. This put the growing civil rights movement of the
1960s square in the FBI’s sights.
COINTELPRO targeted all sides of the political spectrum by the mid-1960s,
from the Socialist Workers party, the Ku Klux Klan, and American Indian
groups, to the Nation of Islam, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,
the Black Panthers, and African-American leaders like Malcom X and Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr.
There’s no question (based on declassified, decoded intelligence documents,
as well as information from former Soviet agents) that the Russian KGB was
manipulating many subversive groups within the U.S. to create what might
euphemistically be called “domestic unrest.”
Nevertheless, the FBI engaged in illegal wiretapping, infiltration, legal and illegal
harassment, assault, break-ins, propaganda planted in the news media, and
other “dirty tricks” to subvert, confuse, or otherwise disrupt the groups it
was investigating.
108
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

Little, if any, good came out of the activities of the COINTELPRO program.
Some believe that the assassinations of Malcolm X and Dr. King may have been
the result of COINTELPRO activities. Neither allegation has ever been proved,
but there were many cases of blatant and often deadly criminal activities con-
ducted by the FBI or its embedded informants during the COINTELPRO years.
In 1971, one of the groups took matters into its own hands and turned the
tables on the FBI. A burglary was staged by a group calling itself the Citizen’s
Committee to Investigate the FBI, in an FBI field office in Pennsylvania, and
files were stolen and leaked to the press that outlined the agency’s illegal
COINTELPRO activities. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was forced by public
opinion to disband the program. The worst of the already sordid details were
made public in Senate hearings chaired by Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho) in
1976, commonly called the Church Committee. The committee’s final report
concluded that the FBI’s activities would’ve been intolerable even if every
single group investigated was involved in the worst possible violent and sub-
versive activities — which they weren’t.
Issues brought to light by the end of the COINTELPRO period have been res-
urrected in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, and especially over broad powers
granted to domestic intelligence agencies by the Patriot Act, which are seen
by many detractors to be every bit as unconstitutional as the FBI’s activities
between 1956 and 1971. Nevertheless, everything old is new again, because
the Internet has allowed terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda to easily inject
propaganda videos and recruitment efforts into African-American and Islamic
controversies on the Web — often, unlike the old KGB, without bothering to
hide their motives of encouraging terrorist acts against the U.S. and European
nations.
The King Alfred Plan
Conspiracy theories can spread in curious ways. In 1967, African-American
novelist John A. Williams promoted his book, The Man Who Cried I Am
(Thunder’s Mouth Press), by photocopying passages of his story and anony-
mously leaving them on subways around New York City. The circulated pages
described a fictional conspiracy called The King Alfred Plan, a government
program to round up and exterminate people of African origin (it’s named
after Britain’s King Alfred the Great). In a matter of weeks, the rumor made its
way around the city and was regarded as true by a growing number of wor-
ried blacks. Even when it was later exposed as being a fictional account,
taken from an acclaimed novel by a respected author, the rumor lingered. It
can still be found 40 years later, presented as an authentic series of docu-
ments on the Internet.
109
Chapter 6: Racial, Religious, and Apocalyptic Conspiracies

Some Web sites connect the King Alfred Plan to a very real FEMA government
readiness plan called REX-84 (Readiness Exercise 1984), a joint military/intel-
ligence service simulation held in April 1984. REX-84 presented a chilling sce-
nario that combined all military and federal intelligence and law enforcement
agencies to test cooperation between these agencies to “round up” subver-
sive groups, terrorist cells, and other gaggles of citizens deemed worrisome
by the government, and throw them into detention camps — under emer-
gency circumstances only — of course. While the methods outlined in REX-84
were never carried out, there’s no denying that the plans still exist, along
with the vast military and intelligence means to do what was planned.
FEMA has been absorbed as part of the many tentacles of the giant government
squid known as the Department of Homeland Security, which, even though
brand, spanking new, the branch is the second largest U.S. government agency
after just six years of existence.
The Willie Lynch Letter
In 1712, along the banks of the James River, a British slave owner from the
West Indies named Captain William “Willie” Lynch stood before a crowd in
Virginia and gave a speech on how to control black slaves. Lynch was called
to the colony to help plantation owners keep slaves from revolting, and he
presented an insidious method to create distrust between blacks based on
their degrees of light or dark skin. Dark-skinned blacks were to be confined to
manual labor in the fields, while light-skinned blacks were given supervisory
duties, or jobs in the plantation owner’s house. The result would be hatred
between house and field slaves, which would deflect their hatred of their
white masters.
Lynch warns the slave owners to keep their slaves in ignorance, and to never
speak to them “man to man. If you teach him all about your language,” says
Lynch, “he will know all your secrets, and he is then no more a slave, for you
can’t fool him any longer, and being a fool is one of the basic ingredients of
any incidents to the maintenance of the slavery system.” It’s a shocking
speech. Except that it never happened.
The Willie Lynch Letter, as it came to be known, is a hoax that has been widely
circulated ever since 1993 when the letter appeared literally out of nowhere.
The text of the “document” surfaced strictly on the Internet, without proof of
evidence or origin. Reputable historians who’ve studied the letter have long
denounced it as a complete fake. And there is, by the way, no record of a William
Lynch in records of the West Indies as a British landowner, nor any verifiable
record of such a person coming to Virginia for such a mission.
110
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

Some folks have claimed that the term “lynching” came from the William
Lynch cited in the letter. Most scholars agree that the term derived from the
“Lynch Law,” possibly named after a real William Lynch, a Virginia resident
who convened vigilante tribunals from 1776 through 1782 during the American
Revolution. The Virginia Assembly supposedly allowed such irregular trials
without due process because the war with Britain made regular, formerly
English courts impractical. Another candidate is a Virginia planter named
Charles Lynch, who punished British loyalists during the revolution by whipping,
tarring, and feathering, confiscating their property, and even forcing them to
join the Continental Army — everything, it seems, except hanging.
Lynching didn’t become a common term for hanging until the early 1900s and
the resurfacing of the Ku Klux Klan (see Chapter 12).
Some people have defended the continued repetition of the hoax by saying its
origin is unimportant, because of the underlying truth of the application of
what was described in the letter. Historians strongly disagree. When something
is an intentional hoax, it needs to be properly labeled as such. And this one is
a howler.
Memorandum 46
In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter’s national security advisor Zbigniew
Brzezinski allegedly drafted a document known as National Security Council
(NSC) Memorandum 46: Black Africa and the U.S. Black Movement. In it, he
proposed a devious plan to undermine black leadership in the United States,
and referred to strategies being developed by the National Security Council’s
(NSC) Political Analysis Committee and the NSC Interdepartmental Group for
Africa.
For more than 30 years, this document has made the rounds as endlessly
photocopied handouts, and later, Web sites. More damaging is that it has
been discussed on African-American radio talk shows, in black-oriented
newspapers, and as factual evidence of government-sponsored racism before
the Congressional Black Caucus, and even the United Nations.
Like the Willie Lynch Letter (see preceding section), Memorandum 46 is a
complete fake. The real NSC Memorandum 46 is available at the Jimmy Carter
Library and Museum Web site. (It’s a numbingly boring review of U.S. policy
toward Central America, and has precisely zero to do with African-Americans;
nor is it really subtitled Black Africa and the U.S. Black Movement.) Brzezinski
himself has vehemently denied the authenticity of the forged document, pointing
out that in many versions his name is misspelled, on a document he’s alleged
to have written himself! The Carter administration in 1980 made a specific point
of denying the alleged document’s contents. And there has never been an NSC
Political Analysis Committee or an NSC Interdepartmental Group for Africa.
111
Chapter 6: Racial, Religious, and Apocalyptic Conspiracies

In 1982, the CIA presented the document before the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence as part of a stack of 100 forgeries that were intentionally circu-
lated by the Soviet KGB as part of their ongoing disinformation operations
against the U.S. In short, overwhelming evidence exists that the endlessly cir-
culated Memorandum 46 isn’t genuine. Nevertheless, in June 2007, XM Radio
talk show hosts Eliot Morgan and Casey Lartigue, Jr., both African Americans,
were fired by Radio One, they claimed, for daring to question the validity of
the document on the air.
Common urban legends
Urban legends are one thing, but when they start to affect the daily behavior
of people, they’re out of hand. And when, with absolutely no basis in truth,
they’re used to damage personal and businesses reputations, based merely
on Internet accusations, they’re downright libelous. Here are some of the
most common, and hurtful, ones:
 In the 1980s, it was widely claimed that Church’s Fried Chicken was
owned by David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, or at
least that one-time owner Al Copeland gave large amounts of money to
Duke’s political campaigns. But the most enduring myth was that
Church’s used either saltpeter or another chemical to sterilize black
men, or at least render them impotent.
Variations of the story substitute Kentucky Fried Chicken, malt liquor
brewers, and Tropical Fantasy soft drinks as the evil, potency-robbing
culprit. Of course, this was a common claim around high school cafete-
rias in the 1970s, too — but saltpeter has precisely zero effect on the
male libido, teenaged, African-American, or otherwise.
 The “K” appearing on food labels, one claim goes, identifies the food
manufacturer as being owned by the Ku Klux Klan. In actuality, the K
stands for kosher, so observant Jews can plan their religious dietary
restrictions accordingly.
 Snapple iced tea was originally labeled with an antique image of the
Boston Tea Party, showing rebellious Bostonians hurling tea into the
ocean from the deck of a ship. Rumors began to spread among blacks
that the vessel depicted was actually a slave ship. The theory was so
widespread that Snapple redesigned their label in 1994 and eliminated
the ship.
 In 1992, film director Spike Lee told an interviewer for Esquire magazine
that clothing designer Liz Claiborne appeared on the Oprah Winfrey
Show the previous week and proclaimed “she didn’t make clothes for
black people to wear.” Lee recommended that blacks immediately go to
their closets, throw out Claiborne’s tags, and never buy from the company
112
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

again. Unfortunately for Lee’s story, Claiborne retired from her company
in 1989 and never appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show. A similar hoax
was circulated about Tommy Hilfiger, who also never appeared on Oprah.
 The Timberland logo depicts a tree as part of its design. A poem called
“Clothes” circulated on the Internet and was deliberately misrepresented
as the work of African-American poet Maya Angelou. The poem claims
that the tree represents one from which blacks were lynched. The poem
also alleges famed designers Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Versace, and
Liz Claiborne, along with Guess and Nautica, all disdain selling their wares
to black people. None of these rumors has any basis in fact. Angelou,
one-time poet laureate of the United States, has emphatically stated on
her Web site that the poem isn’t her work.
Cocaine and the CIA
Between 1982 and 1999, the CIA made an agreement with the Department of
Justice that drug trafficking by “non-employees” and “assets” working for the
Agency didn’t have to be reported (there was a long, detailed list of criminal
activities by intelligence assets that did have to be reported, but drug traffick-
ing was left off the list). As a result, Columbian drug lords, Nicaraguan
Contras, and Afghan rebels who agreed to provide intelligence info to the CIA
were free to import cocaine into the U.S. without being ratted out. If police or
the DEA or the FBI caught them, it was fair game. But the CIA wouldn’t tattle.
In 1995, San Jose Mercury News reporter Gary Webb wrote a three-part article
about the CIA’s program, the Contras, and cocaine. Later published as a book
called Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion
(Seven Stories Press), Webb wrote that CIA-backed Nicaraguans spread crack
cocaine across Los Angeles and sent the profits home to the Contras. Further,
Webb believed that the CIA’s actions were responsible for the spreading epi-
demic of crack cocaine use, especially in inner cities. Critics countered that
the CIA couldn’t be held responsible for simply knowing that the Contras
were financing their military activities with drug money, but it became quick
and easy, headline-grabbing shorthand that the CIA itself was importing
cocaine. The truth was complex, hard to explain, and ugly no matter what the
justification was. Then, nine months after breaking the story, the San Jose
Mercury News backed off Webb’s reports.
The African-American community reacted with outrage. The story recounted
by Webb quickly morphed into the accusation that the recipe for making
crack was created by U.S. government scientists and deliberately designed to
turn the inner-city African-American community into addicts. The allegation
was clear — it was a government plan for genocide. The accusations spread
rapidly on black-oriented talk radio and in newspapers like the Nation of
Islam’s Final Call. The story became so widespread that then-CIA director
John Deutsch made the historically unprecedented move of flying to
113
Chapter 6: Racial, Religious, and Apocalyptic Conspiracies

California and holding a town hall meeting in South Central Los Angeles. His
attempts to stamp out the fires of public distrust were a colossal failure.
Webb’s story resulted in public exposure of the CIA’s role in looking the other
way at drug operations sending dope into the U.S. In 1998, an internal report
by the CIA itself confirmed that the Reagan administration’s secret involve-
ment in the Nicaraguan Contra War resulted in the protection of at least 50
Contras and other drug importers, a situation that the National Security
Council (NSC) was made aware of. Money made directly from importing
cocaine into the U.S. was used by the Contra rebels to fund their war against
the Communist Sandanistas. Since the Contra operation was secret — and
illegal — the NSA saw no reason to pass the news along to the DEA.
It’s important to remember that Webb didn’t accuse the CIA of direct involve-
ment in smuggling drugs to the U.S. The CIA simply didn’t bother to stop it or
inform anyone else. But he also fell under criticism for overstating the CIA’s
responsibility and effects on U.S. drug imports, as well as playing fast and
loose with who and what constituted a CIA “agent.” Still, the core allegations
he made that were denied by the government turned out to be true after all.
Nevertheless, after a series of career setbacks, Webb was found dead in
December of 1999 from a double shotgun blast to the face — purportedly a
suicide. That’s what they say, anyway.
The AIDS epidemic
Since the early 1990s, conspiracy theorists have claimed that the AIDS
(Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) epidemic is the result of either a
government germ warfare experiment gone horribly wrong, or a deliberate
government creation to eliminate homosexuals and African-Americans from
the population.
The generally accepted origin of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
that causes AIDS is that the very similar SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus)
“jumped species” from chimpanzees to humans. Researchers have traced the
probable origin to the African country of Cameroon, and the virus is widely
believed to have come from an infected chimp biting a human, or transmitted
through a cut while a human was butchering a chimp. While many conspir-
acists like to claim such species jumping is almost nonexistent in medicine,
that’s simply not true; both the terrifyingly deadly Ebola and Marburg viruses
have done just that in recent memory.
Rumors abound that the virus was created at the U.S. Army Medical
Command labs at Fort Detrick, Maryland. While there has never been any
credible evidence to back up this allegation, Ft. Detrick has been the site of
medical experiments on human subjects involving germs and viruses (see the
sidebar “Operation Whitecoat”).

Apocalyptic Conspiracies
Remember the Y2K scare — the belief that when everyone’s clocks, comput-
ers, and VCRs clicked over to January 1, 2000, we’d all be plunged into a dis-
astrous reign of electronic techno-terror of cataclysmic proportions? Cars
would stop dead in their tracks. Nuclear missiles would launch on their own.
Power plants would shut down. Riots would erupt all over the world, and
woe to any unprepared, witless, doubting boob who hadn’t purchased a
year’s supply of freeze-dried food, a 55-gallon drum of drinking water, plenty
of ammunition, cyanide pills, and an emergency generator. Then, as you may
recall, nothing happened.
The approach of the millennial year packed an emotionally foreboding
wallop, and while the year 2000 was an anti-climactic dud as far as Earth-
shaking cataclysms go, the year 1000 AD was also a cause for major alarm all
across Europe. Christians were largely convinced that the End Time, foretold
in the Bible’s book of Revelation (more properly The Apocalypse/Revelation
of John), was at hand. Of course, January 1, 1000, came and went, and nothing
changed. Even an attempt to cheat a bit and shove the date to 1,000 years
after Christ’s crucifixion — 1033 AD — still didn’t result in the arrival of the
End Times. All it did was give Christians another 33 years to sweat it out.
At the heart of Millenialism is the description of Armageddon in the biblical
book of Revelation, the final battle on Earth between God and Satan. Popular
belief is that the Antichrist will reveal himself, and Christ will return to the
Earth to take the good and the righteous up to heaven in an event known as
“The Rapture,” leaving Satan behind to rule the Earth for 1,000 years. The phi-
losophy and theology surrounding these “End Times” is called eschatology.
There are variations in the way Christians interpret Revelation, and it’s without
question the hardest book of the Bible to understand. Even the author, “John,”
is disputed by scholars — no one can say with authority whether this John is
an apostle or an otherwise unknown author. These difficulties have resulted
in wildly differing viewpoints:
115
Chapter 6: Racial, Religious, and Apocalyptic Conspiracies
Operation Whitecoat
Between 1954 and 1973, Operation Whitecoat
was a secret program to test the effects of
antibiotics on germ warfare agents. Volunteers
were recruited (from a pool of conscientious
objectors to the military draft who were mostly
members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church)
to be infected with yellow fever, hepatitis, the
plague, and others, and treated with antibiotics
and vaccines. Of the 2,300 volunteers — many
of whom were Operation Whitecoat re-
searchers themselves — none appear to have
died from the effects of the diseases, just in
case you wanted to send a card or flowers.

 Revelation is a future prophecy. Its many visions and descriptions can
be laid over past, present, or future events, but readers of all times and
places tend to think Revelation is describing the prelude to the Apocalypse
as being right now. Of course, this has been done for 1,950 years, give or
take, and every evil dictator has been nominated by doomsayers as the
Antichrist, right down to Napoleon, Hitler, Libya’s president Muammar al-
Qaddafi (a big candidate in the 1980s), and Osama bin Laden.
 Revelation already happened during the Roman Empire. Some biblical
scholars argue that Revelation isn’t about some future apocalyptic cata-
clysm at all. They say that the Beast referred to in Revelation is really
the Emperor Nero, and that 666 refers to Hebrew numerology of Nero
Caesar’s name. This is the Nero who famously fiddled while Rome burned,
but more important, he was the first emperor to order official Roman
persecution of the Christians.
 Revelation is a road map that tells how to trigger Armageddon and
the Second Coming of Christ. The formation of the Jewish state of Israel
in 1945 was the first step to arming the cosmic trigger. Now that the
Jews have come back to Jerusalem, all that’s left is for them to flatten
the Islamic mosques currently occupying the Temple Mount and to
rebuild the Hebrew Temple for God to set the Final Conflict in motion.
This reason is why fundamentalist Christians strongly support Israel —
helping them will bring Christ back that much faster. It’s also a partial
reason why Islamic authorities who are in charge of the Temple Mount
categorically refuse to allow Israeli excavation under the mosques on
the Mount, or to even publicly admit that there was ever any Jewish
Temple up there to begin with.
 Revelation is an allegory, and you need to always be prepared for The
End in your heart. Some Christian sects hold that Satan is being held in
the wings by God, where he can be dragged out onto the cosmological
and ecclesiastical stage whenever God chooses to bring about the End
Times. So the best way to prepare isn’t to look for signs of The End in
headlines or warring nations, but to live every day like it’s the last one.
And there are a lot of variations in between. There’s big money being made in
eschatological opportunism, and there’s a big difference between prophets
and profits.

T
he tale has become part of the fabric of culture. A flying saucer crash-landed
on an isolated ranch near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The recovery of the
debris made headlines for just one day before the U.S. military stepped in to
silence the chatter, but rumors persisted throughout the 1950s that the bodies
of alien occupants were discovered, autopsied, and then packed off to a secret
hanger at Wright Paterson Air Force Base outside of Dayton, Ohio. Meanwhile,
the Roswell spacecraft, along with other UFOs captured over the years, was
taken to a top-secret Air Force installation in Nevada known only as “Area 51,”
where government scientists have spent the last 60 years “reverse-engineering”
the propulsion and weapons technology found on the alien ships.
Depending on whose poll you look at, somewhere between 70 and 85 percent
of Americans believe that Earth has been visited at some point by extrater-
restrial forms of life, and the overwhelming majority believes that the U.S.
government has been hiding it. But if so many people believe it to be true,
why would the government hide it? What are they afraid of?
Space really is the source of an infinite number of unknowns, which is a con-
spiracist’s playground. In this chapter, we discuss the truth, rumors, and
unknowns about UFOs, Roswell, Area 51, and the many admitted government
operations to find the truth and then hide it. And we examine allegations that
the Moon missions of the 1960s and ’70s may have been faked.

Earth versus the Flying Saucers!
Starting in the late 1800s, reports of mysterious “airships” periodically cropped
up across the U.S., Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The earliest known
photo of an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) was a stereoscopic picture of a
cigar-shaped object in the clouds over Mount Washington, New Hampshire,
taken in 1870. Just as in modern UFO sightings, some of these 19th-century
sightings turned out to be hoaxes, some hallucinations, and some real and
explainable phenomena, leaving a small handful that couldn’t be explained.
118
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
The Schulgen Memo
A real Air Force memo was issued in October
1947 on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force,
Brigadier General George F. Schulgen.
Commonly called the Schulgen Memo, it
appears regularly as “proof” that the Air Force
was secretly afraid of interplanetary UFOs.
In the light of UFO sightings beginning in June
1947, military intelligence quickly turned its
sights on the Soviet Union with much suspicion.
Declassified Air Force documents clearly show
just how nervous the military was. Soviet spies
stole the technical secrets to the U.S. atomic
bomb almost as quickly as they were devel-
oped, and the Russians exploded an A-bomb
just four years after the war. The U.S. intelli-
gence community was truly spooked by the
unknown capabilities of our former ally.
Nazi aircraft engineers Walter and Reimar
Horten were self-taught aircraft enthusiasts
who developed revolutionary “flying wing”
designs during the war. Just as the hostilities in
Europe came to a close, the Hortens designed
and built the world’s first jet-powered flying
wing, the Horten Ho 229. A jet/rocket-propelled
hybrid, as well as a much larger, intercontinen-
tal bomber to use against the U.S., were
designed just as the war ended, and the U.S. Air
Force was concerned that what was being
spotted in the summer of 1947 was a Soviet
flying wing, based on a captured Horten design.
The Schulgen Memo outlined in detail specific
fears that the Hortens were directly helping the
Russians and that the Soviets were rumored to
be building 1,800 intercontinental, jet-powered
bombers based on Horten designs. The fears
weren’t unfounded. U.S. intelligence was well
aware that the Germans came very close to
developing the atomic bomb, the Japanese
came within days of dropping a dirty nuclear
device on the California coast, and now the
Russians were close to having their own nukes.
In June 1987, a forgery of this memo was circu-
lated in books by British researcher Timothy
Good, altering a critical passage and making it
appear that the Air Force believed saucer sight-
ings may actually be interplanetary aircraft. A
comparison of Good’s version with the actual
Air Force document makes it clear that the mil-
itary’s sole belief was in a Soviet source for the
aircraft, and an inquiry into the whereabouts of
the Horten family members. Just one sentence
of the memo was altered (by Good or by his
source for the memo), and in context, it’s clear
that an “interplanetary source” isn’t talked
about at all in the real letter. It’s just one of the
many hoaxes perpetrated by some so-called
UFO researchers.

Throughout the early 20th century, science-fiction stories laid the ground-
work for tales of flying machines from outer space. During World War II, Allied
pilots reported many sightings of what came to be called Foo Fighters —
erratic UFO sightings, usually of bright lights, that have never been sufficiently
explained. A wide variety of possible causes were proposed, from ball lightning,
St. Elmo’s Fire, and anti-aircraft targeting flares to unknown secret weapons.
None of which were ever explained.
On June 25, 1947, a highly respected pilot named Kenneth Arnold was flying
over Mt. Rainier, Washington, when he spotted something he couldn’t iden-
tify. He described a group of objects that flew like geese, and moved “like a
saucer would if you skipped it across the water.” Thus was born the term
flying saucer, and a wave of UFO sightings occurred almost immediately
across the U.S. and Canada.
The Roswell Incident
The Roswell Incident is the most famous UFO story on record and is the cor-
nerstone of an alleged government conspiracy to hide alien visits from the
world. The initial discovery of a suspected UFO crash site in 1947 played out
over a three-day period, then almost completely vanished from view for 30
years, before being resurrected in the 1970s by UFO researchers.
The biggest problem facing anyone who steps into the Roswell/UFO arena is
telling truth from fiction. For every account of the event, someone debunks it.
For every so-called fact, there’s a dispute over it, and even eyewitness accounts
and deathbed confessions can’t be trusted. And, according to most dedicated
ufologists of course, nothing officially released by the government can be
trusted at all. Nevertheless, this section covers what’s generally known or
alleged and what can be verified — or at least generally agreed on.
Unidentified debris discovered
Just one month after pilot Kenneth Arnold’s publicized sighting of a UFO over
Washington State, a curious report came out of the little town of Roswell,
New Mexico (see Figure 7-1). On July 4, 1947 — Independence Day — a violent
thunderstorm swept through the area. The next morning, a sheep rancher
named Mac Brazel, who was employed at the J. B. Foster ranch, set out across
the property to look for damage from the storm. What he found was unusual
debris that he couldn’t readily identify, stretched out across a large area. After
showing it to a neighbor, he took some of the pieces into Roswell, about 70
miles away, and presented them to the local authorities, wondering if it might
be wreckage of one of the flying saucers recently reported in the news. (It may
have helped motivate him that the press was offering a $3,000 reward for
119
Chapter 7: Not of This Earth: Innocent Pawns in an Intergalactic Imbroglio

physical evidence of a flying saucer.) Brazel was interviewed by a local radio
station, whose reporter contacted the 509th Bomb Group of the 8th Air Force
at nearby Roswell Army Air Field for a comment.
The base sent Intelligence Officer Jesse Marcel into town and then to the Foster
ranch to investigate. Marcel gathered up some of the pieces and took them
home for the evening, where he showed some of them to his family. The next
morning, he took the debris to the base, and Colonel William “Butch” Blanchard
ordered the debris site cordoned off so it could be recovered, then issued a
press release about the discovery.
Newspapers and network radio reports appeared quickly, announcing that the
Air Force captured a flying disc, but by the next day, a correction was issued
changing the story to say that the debris came from a weather balloon. A press
conference was held, and debris was displayed that seemed to verify that what
was recovered was, in fact, a large rubber balloon and other pieces covered in
silver foil.
Brazel himself was dismayed over the publicity. He’d found pieces of weather
balloons on the ranch in the past, but this find had unusual composition. Still,
the rancher never claimed that what he found was metal. When it was all col-
lected, the wreckage consisted of foil, rubber, wooden sticks, paper, and tape.
Over a period of three days, the remaining debris was collected and flown to
the 8th Air Force Headquarters in Ft. Worth, Texas, where it was examined.
On July 9, the Air Force issued a press release from Ft. Worth identifying the
wreckage as a high altitude balloon carrying a radar target made of wood and
reflective aluminum. And within several weeks of the incident, the whole
event slipped from the public memory for 30 years.

Roswell resurrected
In 1978, UFO researcher Stanton Friedman was contacted by retired intelli-
gence officer Jesse Marcel, and at this point, the Roswell story was resur-
rected and it becomes difficult to separate fact, fiction, faulty memory, and
fraud. Bear in mind that all the following events, cast of characters, and recol-
lections from the Roswell incident have only come forth since 1978:
 Jesse Marcel claimed the wreckage he collected was part of a flying disc
and not a balloon. The foil-like material was unlike anything he’d ever seen
before, and there were strips of purple tape that contained symbols that
looked like either flowers or hieroglyphics. He said that photographs of
himself posing with balloon debris were taken after the real pieces were
replaced with balloon parts by superior officers. Marcel, however, 
couldn’t remember the month or year of the events.
 Frank Kaufman claimed to have been a radar specialist at White Sands
Proving Grounds. He stated that he was ordered to the White Sands facil-
ity where he tracked incoming UFOs the night of the fabled crash. He
was then sent to Roswell, where he witnessed the retrieval of at least one
alien occupant — except that Kaufman was really nothing but a civilian
clerk in the Roswell Army Air Base personnel office. And there was no
radar at White Sands. After his death in 2001, analysis of letters, memos,
and other documents show that Kaufman really was an expert at forgery,
records falsification, and spectacular lying, but not radar.
 Glenn Dennis was a local funeral director in Roswell and claimed he’d
been contacted by the air base’s “mortuary officer” about caskets and
the proper treatment of bodies recovered from the desert. Later, he
“stumbled” into an autopsy being performed on one of three alien corpses.
He further claimed that a nurse at the Roswell air base named Naomi
Maria Selff (or Naomi Sipes — it varied) told him details of the top-secret
operation and gave him sketches of the aliens. Dennis said the nurse
suddenly disappeared, but there’s no record of any such nurse ever
having worked at the base or living in Roswell. His story had enough
inconsistencies that he was eventually labeled a fraud by many UFO
researchers.
The film, Alien Autopsy, was shown on the Fox television network in 1995,
purportedly showing the dissection of these Roswell bodies. The footage
was later exposed as a hoax, although London filmmaker Ray Santilli
claims it was actually a re-creation of authentic footage. The original film
footage has never been handed over by Santilli or anyone else.
 Gerald Anderson, who was 5 years old in 1947, claimed that he and his
family discovered a crashed flying saucer with four aliens on July 5. Two
of the creatures were dead, one barely alive, and one unhurt. Anderson
later provided a forged diary supposedly kept by his uncle Ted
Anderson, written in ink that didn’t exist before 1970.
121
Chapter 7: Not of This Earth: Innocent Pawns in an Intergalactic Imbroglio

 Jim Ragsdale, a truck driver living in nearby Carlsbad, claimed that he
and his girlfriend (the perfectly named Trudy Truelove), witnessed the
actual crash, and came back the next morning to check it out, before
seeing a convoy of 200 military vehicles coming towards them in the
desert, scaring them off. Over the years, his tale has changed dramatically
as to the location of the site (35 miles north of Roswell, then 55 miles west
of town), pieces of wreckage that he and Trudy supposedly recovered
before the military arrived, and other important details. Ragsdale
claimed there were four alien bodies and that he removed several
golden helmets from the UFO, but couldn’t remember where he buried
them. As to other debris he claimed to have in his possession, all has
been lost or stolen over the years.
Over and over again, so-called Roswell witnesses have been exposed in major
inconsistencies or outright lies. So what could the motive for all these, and
literally a hundred others, have been to make these tales up?
Aliens aren’t just big business in Roswell — they’re the town’s number-one
source of income. There are no less than three UFO museums in the town of
only 50,000 people. True believers flock to Roswell, and it has become a UFO
mecca. They sell T-shirts, dolls, coffee mugs, inflatable balloons, tours of the
competing crash sites, and literally anything else you can think of — raking in
an estimated $5 million a year in revenue to the town and nearly 20 percent
of its income. The military base has been closed, there’s no interstate close
by, and there’s not a lot of economic opportunities for the town of 45,000.
Aliens are very big business.
Tracking the government’s paper trail
UFO researchers and debunkers have both been noisy attack dogs and have
made ceaseless requests for reports to be declassified and released to the
public under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. A cataclysmic, earth-
shaking event like capturing a real flying saucer and its alien occupants
would change the course of civilization. At the very least, a military culture
that’s governed by a strict code of procedures and conduct would document
such an event with a mountain of paper, photographs, and other physical evi-
dence. Every step in the investigation of alien conduct would be painstak-
ingly chronicled, if for no other reason than to cover the backsides of career
officers terrified of making a misstep and bringing down the wrath of angry
superiors on them, or worse, the wrath of an angry invading fleet of a supe-
rior intergalactic force.
Out of literally thousands of pages of FOI-released documents, there isn’t
even the hint of evidence of any such authentic events. In 1995, the General
Accounting Office (GAO), at the request of New Mexico congressman Steve
Schiff, conducted a search of all documents relating to the Roswell Army Air
Base and the events of July 1947. As a result of the GAO investigation, the Air
Force was directed to make an internal investigation and to report its findings.
122
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

The Air Force released reports about two formerly top-secret programs:
1994’s The Roswell Report: Fact Vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert, identified
a program called Project Mogul; and 1997’s The Roswell Report: Case Closed
described Operation High Dive:
 Project Mogul: This program was designed to detect Soviet nuclear bomb
tests by using very high altitude balloons loaded with sensitive micro-
phones and reflective boxes that could be tracked by radar. Several
balloons were clustered together for extra support in case some broke, as
well as to assure a constant, standard altitude position. A string of radar
targets was tied to the end of the balloon clusters like a long kite tail. The
targets were needed to track the experiment because the rubber balloons
themselves were invisible to radar. The target boxes were mass-produced,
under contract by a toy manufacturer, out of special foil, balsa wood, and
tape. The tape, it was claimed, was left over from a line of holiday items
and contained gold flowerlike patterns on a purple background, which
accounted for the claims that the so-called saucer debris had hieroglyphics
on it.
The reason for the high security involved in recovering Mogul’s debris in
Roswell was that it was a closely guarded, top-secret program, whose
complete details weren’t even known by the civilian scientists involved in
developing its technology. Likewise, the Roswell Air Base personnel
would’ve had no idea what they were looking at. The balloon flights were
conducted between 1947 and 1948, and based on the physical descrip-
tion, these may very well have been the objects spotted by pilot Kenneth
Arnold the week before the Roswell Incident. The Soviets really did set
off their first nuclear blast in 1949, based on secrets stolen from the U.S.
program (see the sidebar “The Schulgen Memo” earlier in this chapter).
 Operation High Dive: This is a little stranger, but the Air Force alleges
that this project was the genesis of claims of seeing military personnel
recovering bodies from the desert. It was a top-secret program carried
out in the 1950s to test extremely high altitude human parachute jumps,
primarily in case U2 surveillance plane pilots had to bail out from 70,000
feet or higher. The tests themselves were done on early crash test dummies
in an effort to make design changes in parachutes that prevented uncon-
trolled and fatal spinning. The Air Force believes that witnesses saw these
strange-looking dummies being collected in the desert by military crews,
who kept the public away because of the secret nature of the experiments
(the Air Force didn’t want word to get out to the Russians that they had
spy planes that flew so high).
Predictably, the Air Force and the GAO’s reports, along with a subsequent CIA
investigation and report, all raised new accusations of a government
coverup. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of UFO researchers have
begrudgingly accepted that the Roswell Incident is, in all probability, nothing
more than a colossal hoax.

Area 51
Even if Roswell wasn’t the site of an alien spacecraft crash and military recov-
ery mission, that hasn’t stopped speculation over one of the most top-secret
government installations in the world. Known by its secret designation, Area
51 (see Figure 7-1) is a highly classified military base northwest of Las Vegas
in the Nevada desert. It’s actually located within the sprawling Nellis Air
Force Base, adjacent to the Nevada Testing Site, where the military and the
Department of Energy test nuclear weapons.
During WWII, the so-called “Las Vegas Army Airfield” was the primary gunnery
school for the Army Air Corps and was the home to more than 15,000 people
between 1943 and 1944.
124
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
Majestic-12
In the early 1980s, a series of documents
appeared throughout the UFO community that
resurrected belief in government coverups of
alien visits. They described a secret govern-
ment panel, authorized by President Harry
Truman in 1947. The committee was known as
the Majestic-12, MJ-12, and several other vari-
ations. Supposedly, the group was assembled
to study the recovered Roswell spacecraft. The
members were referred to as the Majestic-12
because the dozen affiliates were very big
noises in the military, intelligence, and scientific
communities, headed by Rear Admiral Roscoe
Hillenkoetter, first director of the CIA. Later addi-
tions to the group reportedly included Albert
Einstein, rocket scientist Werner Von Braun,
and nuclear scientists Robert Oppenheimer and
Edward Teller. Other documents have been pro-
duced that allege that President Eisenhower
was briefed by MJ-12 members in November of
1952 about Roswell and a later 1950 New
Mexico UFO crash. This was on the same day
that the president really was briefed by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and the documents relating to
that briefing remain classified to this day. Which
only adds to the mystery about MJ-12.
Documents relating to MJ-12 were leaked
anonymously and under questionable circum-
stances to several members of the UFO
research world throughout the 1980s, and ufol-
ogists seem to be split over whether they’re
authentic or not. If they are what they appear to
be, they contain records of government officials
clearly discussing UFO incidents as being very
real. Unfortunately, there’s also evidence that
the papers are forgeries — that they’ve been
retyped from other non-UFO-related documents
with some paragraphs changed; that they con-
tain errors in military titles of members that gov-
ernment stenographers probably wouldn’t have
made; that they use modern phrases that
wouldn’t have appeared in the 1940s; and most
important, the unconventional and suspicious
way in which the documents have turned up.
They haven’t come from the government as part
of an FOI request. But if they’re a hoax, events
have been meticulously researched, and the
MJ-12 papers contain much factual back-
ground. Like so much in the UFO world, finding
the truth is nearly impossible.

Area 51 itself is centered on a dry lake bed called Groom Lake and was used
during WWII for bombing practice. In 1955, the Lockheed Corporation was
looking for an isolated place to test and develop the U2 spy plane. The testing
site needed to be in the middle of nowhere, easily restricted to outsiders, and
far from the interested eyes of Soviet spies.
The name “Area 51” comes from the way sections of the Nevada Testing Site
were designated in early internal maps. The area is highly restricted — the
airspace is protected, photography is strictly forbidden, and trespassers can
be fined or even shot. The perimeter is guarded by surveillance cameras,
guards, and buried motion detectors. For many years, you could see the
runway of Area 51 from a nearby hilltop known as “Freedom Ridge,” but
recently, the government expanded the land around the base by thousands of
acres, and all easy views into the facility have been effectively cut off. (The
closest public vantage point is now the very hard to hike to Tikaboo Peak,
some 25 miles from the base.) In addition to widening its “no-spy” zone, the
Groom Lake runway has been lengthened to six miles, twice as long as a con-
ventional runway. Something very fast is still landing there.
Prior to the mid-1990s, the public never heard of Area 51, and it’s clear from
the reaction of the military that they aren’t happy that everyone knows about
it now. Its very existence was classified until 1997, and even military pilots who
stray into its protected airspace are still risking major trouble. Many buildings
on the base are constructed without windows, and both civilian and military
workers are required to sign an oath not to reveal what goes on there.
Another deterrent to spies, snoops, and sightseers is Area 51’s location next
door to the principal nuclear testing range in the U.S. Is it worth it to sneak a
peek at exotic technology if you’re going to absorb enough radiation to glow
in the dark for the rest of your shortened life?
Strange aircraft
So, now that the Cold War is over, what are they hiding today? Groom Lake
and Area 51 have been used since the 1950s to test many of the Air Force’s
most revolutionary aircraft designs, including the F-117 Nighthawk Stealth
fighter. The military keeps such aircraft development a secret by providing
millions of dollars each year for “black projects,” development programs that
don’t appear in annual budgets by name or description. Today, rumors
abound on the Internet over a new Mach 6 aircraft that can fly at 130,000 feet,
code named Aurora. Military sources say it doesn’t exist, but that’s just what
we’d expect them to say. It’s these and other unconventional aircraft that
many believe are the source of supposed UFO sightings around Area 51 and
elsewhere. Face it: Until the official public announcement of the B2 Spirit
Stealth Bomber back in 1988, anyone seeing its extraordinary silhouette flying
overhead would’ve figured Batman — or maybe a flying saucer — was in town.
125
Chapter 7: Not of This Earth: Innocent Pawns in an Intergalactic Imbroglio

The UFO connection
Area 51 has an authentic and vital role in the military’s development of
“secret weapons,” but that’s not really why most Americans know or care
about the place. As you drive the three hours north of Las Vegas on State
Highway 375, the helpful signs put up by the Nevada highway department tell
the story most people want to know about. It’s been officially named the
“Extraterrestrial Highway.” The story goes that Area 51 is the location of the
wreckage of the UFO that purportedly crashed at Roswell, New Mexico, in
1947, along with the bodies of its alien occupants (see the section “The
Roswell Incident” earlier in this chapter).
In 1987, Robert Lazar claimed to have worked at a base next to Area 51 called
Sector 4 (S-4). Lazar maintained that S-4 had nine UFOs, and that he was hired
to help “reverse-engineer” alien technology from them. He also said that he
was briefed about the origin of the UFOs — they came from the Zeta Retuculi
1 and 2 star system, 37 light years from Earth, and the aliens are referred to
as Zeta Reticulians.
Lazar described the aliens as 3 to 4 feet tall, gray, with large heads, almond-
shaped eyes, and possessing telepathic, mind control power. According to his
accounts, the reverse-engineering program began in 1979, and the aliens
themselves were actually in charge of the program.
Unfortunately, Lazar’s incredible story is undermined by his claims that he
has a master’s degree in electronics Technology from Caltech and a master’s
in physics from MIT. Investigators have never been able to find any record of
Lazar attending either institution, which only scratches the surface of the lies
he has told over the years (false employment claims, incorrect details about
Area 51, misrepresentation of Site 4’s real-life role as a simple radar installation,
and many more). Lazar counters that the government has completely removed
all public records of his education and employment as either a security measure
or a sinister effort to discredit him. They even removed his name from hundreds
of Caltech and MIT yearbooks in libraries all around the country. Once again,
a story that has become a cornerstone of the UFO movement turns out to be
an elaborately embellished hoax, and no serious UFO researchers believe
Lazar’s claims anymore.
Meanwhile, UFO enthusiast Richard Boylan tells tales about Lockheed’s X-22A
“Dark Star” Anti-Gravity Fighter Disc, based on alien technology and armed
with a “neutral particle beam” weapon. According to Boylan, the X-22A is
deployed out of a secret underground base hidden underneath King’s Peak,
outside of Salt Lake City, Utah, which he believes is the new Area 51. Others
have claimed (perhaps a little more realistically) that Area 51’s location and
activities have been compromised by all the publicity in recent years, and
that the military has taken its creepy, covert aircraft business elsewhere, to
Utah’s Dugway Proving Ground (see Figure 7-1).
126
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

Nevertheless, tales of UFOs flying in and out of Area 51 continue to be
reported. If you’re truly determined, head three hours north of Las Vegas on
Nevada 375, and look for a white mailbox owned by rancher Steve Medlin —
it’s supposed to be the best vantage point on the flight path. Pull over, be
patient, and watch the skies.
Government Investigations of UFOs
At the end of 1947, the Air Force was sufficiently concerned about the grow-
ing list of UFO sightings across the country that it ordered an investigation,
called Project Sign. Over the years, there was a series of studies made by the
Air Force, along with records being kept by the FBI and the CIA on UFO sight-
ings. We cover those studies in the following sections.
Project Sign
Project Sign was conducted between 1947 and 1948 out of the Air Technical
Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio, to
investigate the flurry of flying saucer sightings that began before Kenneth
Arnold’s famous report over Mt. Rainier (see “Earth versus the Flying Saucers!”
earlier in this chapter).
The memos leading up to the formation of the investigation make it clear that
the Air Force took such reports very seriously, that they believed people
really were seeing flying disks of some kind, and that they were afraid the
objects were using advanced technology being developed by the Soviets.
They also considered the possibility that another top-secret military or civil-
ian project, unknown to the Air Force, may be constructing these objects.
An often-repeated story about Project Sign is that the investigation team ran
into enough unexplainable cases that they issued a preliminary “Estimate of
the Situation” prior to the final report, stating flying disks had a “non-earthly
source.” Such a document has never been found and there is disagreement as
to whether it ever existed. Whether it did or not, superior officers at Wright-
Patterson found flying saucer claims to be ridiculous and that any suggestion
of an extraterrestrial source translated as bias and sloppy intelligence work
on the part of Project Sign’s investigative team.
Because of the argument between superiors and the investigators, Project
Sign was shut down in 1949, and its official conclusion was inconclusive.
127
Chapter 7: Not of This Earth: Innocent Pawns in an Intergalactic Imbroglio

Project Grudge
Project Grudge was a code name deliberately chosen by anti-UFO officers
within the Air Force. It immediately replaced Project Sign in 1949, and was
given the directive to discredit any and all reports of flying saucer sightings.
While Project Sign expressed the opinions of investigators that the over-
whelming majority of saucer sightings could be explained by natural phenom-
enon and misidentification, Project Grudge went out of its way to completely
discredit even unexplainable sightings. The report’s conclusion added mass
hysteria, wartime jitters, hoaxes, and nut cases as additional causes of UFO
reports. In addition, Grudge provided “assistance” to newspapers and maga-
zines by writing UFO debunking articles.
News of the anti-UFO bias within Grudge’s organization reached Major
General Charles P. Cabell, the head of Air Force Intelligence at the Pentagon,
who was furious that serious investigations were no longer being carried out,
in favor of slapdash reporting and simply ridiculing the UFO subject. Cabell
literally ordered Grudge’s staff to have an open mind!
The general realized that public opinion of the military on the UFO subject
was a double-edged sword: If it really turned out that UFOs were authentic,
he wanted the Air Force to be able to produce a serious, scientific analysis of
any potential threat; on the other hand, if they were simply figments of wild
imaginations, he didn’t want the Air Force to be guilty of looking too credu-
lous. Most of all, he really didn’t want the word to get out that he personally
believed in the things himself.
In 1951, Project Grudge was shut down, and a new program with a new staff
was formed that was intended to be as open-minded as Cabell had ordered.
128
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
The real X-files
FBI director J. Edgar Hoover took an interest in
the reports of UFOs, Roswell, alien abductions,
cattle mutilations, and other related topics. Over
the years, he amassed these reports into one
large collection that is sometimes referred to as
the X-files. To see the 1,600 pages of FBI X-files
released under the Freedom of Information
Act, go to http://foia.fbi.gov/foia
index/ufo.htm.

Project Blue Book
Project Blue Book is perhaps the best known and most famous of the Air
Force UFO studies. Opened in 1952, the original director of the program was
Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, who was the first to actually coin the phrase
“Unidentified Flying Object.” The project had the blessing of General Cabell
(see previous section), who was encouraged by a member of his own staff —
General William Garland, who’d witnessed a UFO himself!
Project Blue Book is widely considered to be the last and best government
effort to seriously study UFOs in an unbiased and comprehensive manner,
and Ruppelt assembled a team of both military experts and civilian scien-
tists. Anyone who was found to be too obviously pro or con was fired.
Blue Book standardized the way UFO sightings were investigated, with a
questionnaire that allowed the data to be analyzed statistically. Additionally,
Ruppelt issued regular reports and press releases concerning the ongoing
investigation. The result was a growing public interest in UFOs, along with an
increase in reported sightings.
129
Chapter 7: Not of This Earth: Innocent Pawns in an Intergalactic Imbroglio
MIB: Men in Black
Throughout the UFO investigations of the 1950s
and ’60s, a persistent rumor began to accom-
pany sighting reports. Witnesses began to claim
that strange men, often dressing in black suits
and wearing dark sunglasses, appeared and
attempted to intimidate them into clamming up
about UFO reports. Descriptions varied wildly,
but these MIBs were said to know personal
information about UFO witnesses, leading to the
conclusion that they were government agents,
sent to silence UFO sightings.
Over the years, the tales were embellished. The
MIBs were described as either dressing in suits
that were years out of date, or in high fashion,
and old Cadillacs seemed to be the car of
choice. Some have claimed that the MIBs were
actually aliens themselves, and much of the
folklore about them was woven into the popular
film Men In Black (1997) and its sequel. A
centerpiece of the film was a device used to
wipe the memory of a UFO sighting from the
mind of witnesses. Those who claim the MIBs
are real say they remove UFO crash site
evidence, then erase the memories of wit-
nesses — a handy way to explain fuzzy recol-
lections and lack of evidence.
Researcher Bill Moore believes that the MIBs
are part of the very real U.S. Air Force Office of
Special Investigations (AFOSI), an internal
security department started in 1948 and pat-
terned after the FBI for investigating criminal
activity within the Air Force and its weapons
contractors. Because one of the missions of the
AFOSI is to protect Air Force technology, pro-
grams, and personnel on a global basis from
“external threats,” it would frankly be astonish-
ing if the MIB didn’t exist, especially if UFOs are
real.

The Robertson Commission: Debunking Project Blue Book
Not long after Project Blue Book was established (see the preceding section),
the CIA got involved in the UFO investigation business. The Agency was
concerned that the swelling number of UFO reports were starting to tax the
abilities of the Air Force to investigate them all (UFOs had become such a
public-relations hot potato that the other branches of the military didn’t
want to go anywhere near the subject).
In February 1953, the CIA assembled the Robertson Commission, made up of
respected civilian scientists (including future Nobel prize–winner in physics,
Luis Alvarez, and an Einstein colleague, Samuel Gaudsmit), along with skepti-
cal military officers. After studying the issue for just a few weeks, their con-
clusions were as follows:
 All UFOs could be explained by known scientific means.
 Even if they couldn’t be scientifically explained, the UFO controversy was
overwhelmingly dominated by natural events, explainable phenomenon, or
hoaxes, and took up way too much of the Air Force’s time and effort.
 An enemy (presumably the Soviet Union) could use bogus UFO reports
and mass hysteria to immobilize or otherwise preoccupy military
resources in order to mask an invasion.
 The Air Force and other government agencies should, therefore, begin a
public relations campaign to debunk UFO sighting claims and to teach
the public how to identify natural phenomena that could be mistaken as
UFO sightings. The panel went on to suggest getting Walt Disney to make
public education films on the subject.
 The CIA being the CIA, they also recommended investigating UFO-sight-
ing clubs and other pro-UFO civilian groups because of their potential to
whip up public hysteria or other subversive activities. Based on this rec-
ommendation, the FBI quickly shut down the Civilian Saucer
Investigations, a California-based flying saucer club with an impressive
list of scientists as members.
As a result of the Robertson Commission report, Captain Ruppelt was reas-
signed, Blue Book’s staff was severely reduced, and its budget was hacked to
pieces. With Ruppelt gone, the Air Force changed Blue Book’s mission to see
to it that reports of truly “unidentified” objects were kept to a minimum.
Investigators weren’t to speak to the press unless an event was neatly explained.
The new shift in Blue Book’s stance wound up wrecking its credibility with
the public, and its official explanations were increasingly seen as just plain
ludicrous. In one incident, four UFOs tracked by several radar installations
and seen by police in Oklahoma in 1965 were passed off as misidentification
of the planet Jupiter. In another notorious case, Ohio and Pennsylvania police
130
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

chased a UFO across 85 miles in April 1966, and watched it descend as low as
50 feet. Project Blue Book explained it as a communications satellite, and
then the planet Venus. Another famous incident, seen by several hundred
civilians and police officers in Michigan over several days in 1966, was
explained away as “swamp gas.”
The Condon Committee: Closing the Book
As a result of the growing public ridicule of Blue Book’s explanations, a
Congressional hearing was held in 1966, followed by yet another investigative
panel, the Condon Committee. Named for respected physicist Edward U.
Condon, the committee stacked the deck in its investigation of some of Blue
Book’s reports so that unexplained UFO sightings never even came up for
review. The investigation was held by the University of Colorado after a long
list of more prestigious universities and organizations turned it down — no
one wanted to touch the UFO question with a ten-foot pole.
The committee concluded that UFOs weren’t extraterrestrial, were com-
pletely explainable, and posed no danger to national security. These findings
brought immediate catcalls and hoots of derision from almost every corner
of public and professional opinion.
In 1967, word leaked that a memo had been circulated at the start of the com-
mittee’s investigation, known as the “Trick Memo.” In it, committee member
Robert J. Low suggested that the University of Colorado could save its repu-
tation from ridicule if the committee’s final report only appeared objective,
but came to the predetermined conclusion that UFOs were natural phenomena,
misidentifications, or figments of feverish imaginations. The memo went on to
suggest that if the conclusions were suitably dismissive and if they painted UFO
spotters as four-alarm loons, “the scientific community would get the message.”
The final report was released in 1968, and true to the Trick Memo’s sugges-
tion, any case that had been studied that couldn’t be explained was elimi-
nated from the final version, including a puzzling sighting by U.S. astronauts
during a Gemini mission. It effectively brought an end to Project Blue Book
and the government’s official investigations of UFOs. The only conclusion
that most everyone agreed with was that the Air Force spent 21 years looking
into UFOs, and almost no scientifically useful information ever came out of it.
Project Blue Book was officially closed in January 1970. Unofficially, almost 22
percent of the cases reported remain unsolved. Project Blue Book’s documents
have all been released to the public and can be seen at www.bluebook
archive.org.

The Brookings Report
In 1960, the Brookings Institute was commissioned by NASA to report on the
future of space travel and exploration. The official title of the report was
Proposed Implications of Peaceful Space Activities For Human Affairs, and it
was submitted to Congress on April 18, 1961. The Brookings Institute is the
oldest public policy think tank in the U.S., and its reports are regularly sub-
mitted to the government on a wide range of issues.
The 1961 report discusses a wide range of topics about space and NASA’s role,
but two sentences in particular are the subject of controversy in the UFO con-
spiracy universe. There is a section of the paper called The Implications of a
Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life, and the authors surmised that “face-to-face”
meetings between humans and aliens wouldn’t likely occur within 20 years
(through the 1980s). However, it was expected that NASA would discover arti-
facts or other evidence of alien life on the Moon, Mars, Venus, and other plan-
ets. The report doesn’t advocate covering up such discoveries, but it does
explore the possibly harmful effects such a discovery could have on society,
disrupting some cultural and religious groups. Conspiracists see within the
language of the Brookings Report a motive for official government coverups
of alien contact to save the world from culture shock.

Close Encounters
Astronomer J. Allen Hynek was a consultant
with all three Air Force studies, along with pre-
senting evidence to the Robertson Commission.
He started out in the beginning as a near total
skeptic, but as he investigated more and more
sightings, too many events were unexplainable,
and his views changed. In his 1972 book, The
UFO Experience: A Scientific Study, Hynek pro-
posed a scale to describe the experiences of
people who’d witnessed a UFO. The terms were
made famous by the 1977 film Close Encounters
of the Third Kind. While subsequent authors
have added to and embellished Hynek’s original
terms, most UFO researchers stick with his list:
 Daylight Disks: UFOs more than 500 feet
away, seen during the day
 Nocturnal Lights: UFOs more than 500 feet
away, seen at night
 Radar/Visual Reports: Visible UFOs also
spotted on radar
 Close Encounters of the First Kind: Visual
observation of a UFO closer than 500 feet
(flying saucers, odd lights, or flying objects
that defy known human technology)
 Close Encounters of the Second Kind:
Observation of a UFO closer than 500 feet,
combined with physical effects (heat, radi-
ation, radio interference, or damage to ter-
rain or property)
 Close Encounters of the Third Kind:
Observation of animate beings in association
with a UFO, closer than 500 feet

Britain’s “Flying Saucer Working Party”
The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence followed the same line of reason-
ing that the U.S. military did, waffling back and forth over the official origin or
existence of UFOs, depending upon who was in charge at the time. A study
team was formed in 1950 based on the recommendation of Sir Henry Tizard
(the pre–World War II pioneer of radar), who felt that UFO reports shouldn’t
be dismissed without proper scientific investigation. Known by the uninten-
tionally comical name, the Flying Saucer Working Party (FSWP), the direc-
torate did work similar to Project Sign (see earlier in this chapter). After less
than a year, the conclusion of the team was that UFOs weren’t extraterres-
trial. In 1952, Prime Minister Winston Churchill inquired about government
investigations of UFOs, asking if they were real. The reply from the direc-
torate was dismissive and made it clear that the FSWP saw no evidence what-
soever for believing in alien spacecraft.
In September 1952, NATO was holding a 12-day joint military exercise called
“Operation Mainbrace” near Norway, involving 80,000 troops from nine differ-
ent nations. Between September 19 and 22, at least four major UFO sightings
of “spacecraft” were reported by many pilots, as well as the crew of the USS
Franklin D. Roosevelt aircraft carrier. It was almost like a deliberate attempt
by intergalactic pranksters to deflate the ego of the Ministry of Defence’s dis-
missive report to Churchill. The result of the embarrassing incident was new
British military policy that no report of UFOs would ever be made public.
Service personnel weren’t to discuss such sightings with the press, and inter-
nal investigations were classified as secret.
The Ministry of Defence publicly denied they’d ever looked into the UFO
question for almost 50 years, which should’ve struck the British people as a
criminal lack of curiosity on the part of their military. The FSWP files were
classified by the British government as “Secret Discrete” until the 1990s.
They were released to the public in 2001.
NASA’s “Phony” Moon Landings
On July 20, 1969, the whole world stared into their television sets and
watched blurry, flickering, black and white images as Apollo 11’s lunar excur-
sion module, nicknamed “The Eagle,” descended from orbiting around the
Moon and touched down on the Sea of Tranquility. In 1960, deep in the heart
of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, President John F. Kennedy upped the
stakes in the “space race” between the two superpowers by proclaiming that
the U.S. would land a man on the Moon “before this decade is out.” Apollo 11
managed to pull it off with just four months to spare.
133
Chapter 7: Not of This Earth: Innocent Pawns in an Intergalactic Imbroglio

It was truly the technological achievement of the century, and perhaps the
greatest milestone in the annals of mankind. And yet, the day after astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left the first human footprints on another
world, there were those who didn’t believe it was possible. One woman inter-
viewed by Newsweek proclaimed that she didn’t believe it because she didn’t
think her TV set could pick up a transmission from the Moon. A rumor began
to spread across the countryside: Maybe the Moon landings had been staged.
Various claims have been made over the last three decades about ways in
which the Moon landings may have been faked, and why. Some of the more
common ones include:
 NASA’s first manned test flight of the Apollo space capsule and Saturn-
series rocket resulted in a tragic fire that killed astronauts Gus Grissom,
Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. In a test on January 27, 1967, fire broke out
in the oxygen-rich cockpit, and the three men died within 17 seconds.
The claim goes that the fire set the program back so badly that the

Crop circles
One thing we’ve learned over the years is never
to attack someone’s religion. And in some cir-
cles, UFO belief has become the next best thing
to a religion. No matter what evidence comes to
light to contradict their claims, true believers
just won’t be shaken.
A case in point has to do with crop circles.
To “croppies,” these strange, mathematical
designs stamped down in flattened crops in the
middle of farm fields are proof positive that
aliens are visiting Earth. To them, crop circles
are either the result of UFO propulsion systems
knocking down wheat and barley plants, or
messages from aliens that we just don’t under-
stand yet. They’ve even developed a name for
the study of crop circles: cereology. Of course,
this phenomenon is a matter of hilarity to a
growing group of people who regularly go into
fields armed with a board, some string, and wire
to make complex crop circles.
Appearing first in England in the early 1970s, crop
circles fascinated the public and the press as
they materialized overnight in the region around
Stonehenge. As the public became convinced
they were of extraterrestrial origin, the strange
designs started showing up around the world.
In 1991, Doug Bower and Dave Chorley came
forward and admitted they started the commo-
tion 20 years before after planning their first
crop circle in a pub. They’d intended the circles
to be a hoax from the beginning, and wild tales
of UFO origins only egged them on. Since then,
groups of crop-circle artists have sprung up
around the world. Crop circles have become
major tourist attractions, and the designs have
even been used for advertising in recent years —
there are professional groups like Circlemakers
in England.
To true believers, these artists are heretics and
hoaxers, who obscure the real source of the
strange designs. They believe crop circles are
created by balls of light (BOLs) emitting electro-
magnetic energy from alien spacecraft.

Moon landings had to be completely or partially fabricated in order to
make it look like the U.S. had achieved its goal on time.
 Some have claimed that the Van Allen radiation belts that surround the
earth were far too deadly to allow Apollo spacecraft to pass through
without killing the astronauts inside. Most scientists (including their
discoverer Dr. James Van Allen) reject this claim, because radiation poison-
ing is dependent upon the amount of time a person is exposed, and Apollo
astronauts passed through too quickly to have received a dangerous dose.
 Conspiracists claim that the astronauts were launched into low Earth
orbit, and that the Moon landing was videotaped in a studio. Then, after
the appropriate amount of time, the orbiting Apollo spacecraft splashed
down, all on international television.
 According to conspiracists, Stanley Kubrick, hot on the heels of directing
the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, which contained the first realistic
and convincing special effects depicting spaceflight ever put on film, was
brought from England to direct the Apollo 11 telecast. Anyone who
knows anything about the famously temperamental and perfectionist
director knows how impractical this claim is. Some claim that special
effects were created by 2001 effects artist Douglas Trumbull in a studio
in Huntsville, Alabama, home of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center.
 A variation on the claim is that only some of the six successful Moon
landings were faked, while NASA had extra time to work on its faulty
technology. Apollo 13’s almost fatal accident was staged in order to refo-
cus a bored public on NASA’s need for greater funding. And Apollo 17,
the final mission to the Moon, was the only authentic trip, because it
had a civilian crew member who couldn’t be threatened or bought off.
 The 1978 film Capricorn One added fuel to the hoax claims, by telling a
fictional story of NASA faking a landing on Mars, while filming the events
in a studio — using spacecraft virtually identical to the Apollo missions.
 The International Flat Earth Society, as their name makes clear, believed
(and still does) that the Earth isn’t round, but flat as a pancake. That being
the case, as far as they were concerned, the Moon landings could be
nothing but a hoax.
There’s too much evidence and far too many participants in NASA’s Apollo
program to convince the overwhelming majority of people that the Moon
landings were anything but authentic. The Apollo missions involved $30 bil-
lion in federal dollars and 400,000 employees, with nary a squealer in the
bunch. That hasn’t prevented a small cottage industry of authors from crying
“hoax.” The 842 pounds of lunar rocks returned to Earth by Apollo astronauts
over the course of six missions isn’t proof to them. Conspiracists claim unmanned
NASA missions brought the rocks to back Earth before Apollo 11 ever launched,
or they were simply cooked up artificially in a high-temperature kiln.
In spite of piles of photographic and physical evidence, this conspiracy
theory hangs on, largely promoted by late author Bill Kaysing. He was a
135
Chapter 7: Not of This Earth: Innocent Pawns in an Intergalactic Imbroglio

librarian at Rocketdyne, an early NASA supplier, and claimed (without proof)
that the space agency never had the expertise needed to actually land men
on the moon. He further alleged that the Apollo 1 astronauts (and later the
Challenger Space Shuttle crew) were murdered because they were about to
reveal the “truth” about NASA. Kaysing claimed that the astronauts were
actually in the Nevada desert putting on the “moonwalk show” during the
day, and hanging out with strippers and Las Vegas showgirls at night —
requiring years of psychological therapy before they could get over the guilt
of duping the public.
Amateur filmmaker Bart Sibrel has taken a more confrontational approach to
the issue. In 2002, he accosted Buzz Aldrin in front of a Beverly Hills hotel,
demanding answers to his questions about the so-called Moon landing
“hoax,” calling the astronaut a “coward, a liar, and a thief.” Aldrin reacted in a
less than Socratic method over the controversy and punched Sibrel right in
the kisser. Other Apollo astronauts have characterized Sibrel as a “stalker.”
The first time men from Earth stepped onto a new world had a profound effect
on Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and both men grappled long and hard 
with their public and private reactions to an event that the whole world 
was watching. There are two little-known items about Aldrin, in particular.
Professional atheist Madalyn Murray O’Hair sued NASA for violating church/
state separation by allowing government-employed astronauts to read from the
book of Genesis during Apollo 8’s Moon-orbiting mission in 1968. So, on his own,
Aldrin (a Presbyterian) privately gave himself Communion when Apollo 11’s
Eagle landed. Aldrin is also a Freemason, and he carried a special document 
proclaiming the moon as being under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of
Texas of Free and Accepted Masons, which means the Masons control not just
the world, but the moon!

Conspiracy Theories
In This Chapter
 Seeking out the origins of 9/11 conspiracies
 Exploring the well-known theories of 9/11
 Weighing in on the theory that the Jews did it
T
hey call themselves Truthers. Charles Dickens, that master of mirth in
monikers, couldn’t have come up with a more ironic name. “Truthers,”
people who are involved in the “Truth Movement,” believe that 9/11 was “an
inside job,” something that, in intelligence circles, is called a false flag operation.
That comes from an old naval term, because ships of all countries, including
pirate ships without a country, usually carried with them flags of several
nations, so that they could tactically hide their identity if necessary.
Truthers believe that 9/11 was a false flag operation and that the real face
behind the false flag was the CIA, the Bush administration, and the “military-
industrial complex.” Or worse. Everyone saw it happen on national television.
Everyone heard the chilling tapes of flight attendants describing the Middle
Eastern hijackers and what they were doing. Everyone saw the tape of Osama
bin Laden crowing about how he didn’t dare to hope the buildings would actu-
ally come down, and how thrilled he was that they did. Everyone saw every
horror unfold before them in real time. It’s become the ultimate event for
which everyone can remember exactly where they were, and exactly what
they were doing when it happened.
The unprecedented tragedy of 9/11 has been a gold mine for the conspiracy-
minded. In a 2006 Scripps-Howard poll, an astonishing 36 percent of Americans
considered it “very likely” or “somewhat likely” that government officials either
allowed the attacks to be carried out or carried out the attacks themselves.
This chapter explains where and how these theories started, and just how
many facts, if any, are contained in the contentions of these peddlers of what
they call the “unofficial,” rather than the “official,” conspiracy theory.

September 11, 2001
On a sunny and crystal clear Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001, commonly
abbreviated as 9/11, America suffered a shocking and appalling terrorist attack
on our own home ground, for the first time in our history. Nineteen dedicated
and highly-trained Islamic terrorist commandoes, under the leadership of
Mohammed Atta, smoothly and efficiently spread themselves into four tactical
units and hijacked four American commercial aircraft, all from the east coast
headed west, all carrying maximum fuel load, all taken within the space of an
hour. Coolly and deliberately, the first aircraft, American Airlines Flight 11, was
flown into an icon of American capitalism, the north tower of the twin World
Trade Center Towers in Lower Manhattan, in New York City. It struck the 110-
story building at 8:46 a.m., passing completely through the 94th to 98th floors.
Before America could catch its collective breath, before the nation could realize
that the attack wasn’t an accident, the second aircraft, United Airlines Flight
175, crashed into the other tower, through the 78th to 84th floors, at 9:02 a.m.
News cameras all over the country were fixed on the already burning North
Tower, and, as planned, the entire world witnessed the horror of the second
crash live on television. In a very short time, the towers collapsed, reducing
both skyscrapers and 2,750 people to a pile of wreckage and dust that smol-
dered for three months. This was no accident; it was an attack.
This was made abundantly clear when, at 9:37, American Airlines Flight 77
crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C.
It’s been the symbol of our military since its construction in 1948. By the time
of this final blow, phone calls alerted the passengers of the fourth hijacked plane,
United Airlines Flight 93, that this was no ordinary hijacking, but a suicide
mission. It’s probable their target was the White House or the Capital Building.
The passengers attempted to overcome the hijackers, and in the ensuing
battle, the plane crashed outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44
passengers and crew aboard. The numbers weren’t higher, on any of these
four jets, because they hadn’t made stops across the country to pick up more
westbound passengers. Nevertheless, nearly 3,000 Americans were dead, and
the rest of America was frightened, stunned, and caught utterly unaware.
Tracking the Origins of 9/11 
Conspiracy Theories
A group of professional terrorists, called Al-Qaeda, living in the sympathetic
nation of Afghanistan and led by a dangerous fanatic Saudi millionaire named
Osama bin Laden, brought the most powerful nation on earth to its knees with
19 commandoes and a bunch of box cutters. News cameras recorded the Mardi
Gras joy in the streets of Gaza over the attacks. There was just no way
138
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

Americans could understand it. We’d been dumping billions of dollars in foreign
aid into the Palestinians, indeed the whole Middle East, for decades, while
president after president worked to bring peace to the region. Why on earth
did they hate us?
The shock and confusion were there in part, at least, because in the past 40
years, Americans have seemed far too willing to shrug off terrorist attacks on
our citizens, so long as those citizens were abroad. Since the birth of the militant
Black September terrorist group in the 1970s, we’d seen Americans shot on
board hijacked planes, we’d seen helpless elderly Americans kidnapped and
beaten, one even thrown overboard in a wheelchair, and we’d seen Americans of
all ages blown out of the sky by terrorist bombs. All these acts were the product
of a blind, almost maniacal hatred of the United States.
Yet, right up to the most recent Al-Qaeda atrocities in the year 2001, so long
as it didn’t happen on American soil, we’ve seemed far too willing to look the
other way. As long as everyone had their TVs and SUVs and credit cards, they
didn’t really want to know about the madness in the Middle East, or the blind
hatred for the U.S. Even the first bombing of the World Trade Center, in 1994,
though a big news story, didn’t seem to make the nation as a whole feel vul-
nerable. The attacks of 9/11 was the logical outcome, the crash that will
inevitably happen when you’re asleep at the wheel. Though no one could’ve
predicted the horrific details of 9/11, many analysts were surprised that an
attack in our own back yard took as long a time in coming as it did.
Not long after the events of 9/11, a widely disparate group of people began to
reject what they disparagingly refer to as the “official version” of the attacks,
or the “official conspiracy theory.” Like those who believe FDR engineered
the attack on Pearl Harbor (see nearby sidebar), a belief has developed over
the events of 9/11 that the attacks were either allowed to happen or that the
U.S. government intentionally staged the attacks in order to justify war in
Afghanistan and Iraq. While these folks are a statistically tiny portion of
Americans, they’re also quite noisy, and they’ve used the modern technology
of the Internet and other nontraditional media to get mainstream media
attention. Apparently, some of what they claim has resounded with the public,
because, after all this time since the attacks, more than 100 million
Americans think there may be something to it.
According to the Truthers:
 Al-Qaeda didn’t plan and execute the attacks on the World Trade
Centers and the Pentagon. The government did it. They staged the
plane crashes and filled the twin towers and other buildings in the World
Trade Center complex with explosives to bring them down. (See the “Al-
Qaeda” sidebar later in this chapter.)
 The Pentagon wasn’t hit by an airplane. A 757 has a 124-foot wingspan,
but there wasn’t a 124-foot hole in the building. The hole was created by
a cruise missile. You’d think the literally hundreds of eyewitnesses who
139
Chapter 8: Tracking the Evolution of the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories

saw the plane crash, many of whom were sitting in rush-hour traffic, would
put this dog to sleep, but no such luck. (For more details on this, see
Chapter 16.)
 Flight 93 didn’t crash in Pennsylvania after its passengers tried to
rush the cockpit. It was shot down by military jets. Because the military
was given permission to shoot down Flight 93 (17 minutes too late), nobody
seems able to say why the government would hide this if it were true.
 The government and especially the 9/11 Commission can’t be trusted.
But a statement on September 20, 2001, by bin Laden originally denying
involvement in 9/11 can be.
The 9/11 “Truth Movement”
The so-called 9/11 “Truth Movement” is essentially divided into two schools
of thought:
 LIHOP: “Someone” Let It Happen On Purpose
 MIHOP: “Someone” Made It Happen On Purpose
140
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
Pearl Harbor Syndrome: The government knew
Devious conspiracy theories about causes of
war are nothing new. Controversy still rages over
whether the USS Maine, whose sinking in
Havana in 1898 set off the Spanish-American
War, was blown up by an accidental coal bunker
fire or intentionally destroyed by a Spanish mine.
In 1915, the RMS Lusitania was sunk by a
German submarine, killing 1,195 people — 128
were Americans. Almost immediately, accusa-
tions flew that the British Navy intentionally let
the ship be hit in order to turn public opinion
against Germany and goad President Woodrow
Wilson into entering World War I.
And then there’s the long-rumored theory that
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt provoked
the Japanese into attacking the U.S. Navy in the
Pacific, and that Pearl Harbor was no sneak
attack. Suddenly, Roosevelt had everything he’d
dreamed of, our military, our industry, and our
civilians fully behind him, with a healthy boost
to the economy to finally put an end to the
Depression. Who wouldn’t think he might’ve
planned it, or at least known the attack was
coming and let it happen? In spite of over-
whelming evidence to the contrary, people of
sane and moderate political beliefs continued
through the years to keep faith with the notion
that Roosevelt knew about Pearl Harbor ahead
of time, or even caused the attack as part of his
own evil plan. It’s true that Naval Intelligence
was jittery over several decoded Japanese
messages. In fact, all America had the jitters,
and we had every right. But the massive sneak
attack was a surprise to everyone. Whether we
should’ve been better prepared is another
matter entirely.

The “someone” in each camp, of course, was President George W. Bush, or
the New World Order, or the Illuminati, or the Jews. Anyone was responsible,
it seems, except a group of Islamic terrorists who left an evidence trail of their
planning behind them and whose organizers claimed victory over the U.S.
The Truthers don’t seem to have one central thesis or theory, and the LIHOPs
and MIHOPs often seem to be at odds with each other. The movement as a
whole assembles a bizarre mixture of the Far Right and the Far Left to quibble
over details. The two things they do seem to agree on are
 The “official version” of 9/11 is a lie.
 George W. Bush had something to do with it.
Those folks who do believe the official version of 9/11 are contemptuously
labeled “sheeple.”
Among the first and crankiest of the Truthers was Austin, Texas, talk radio
personality Alex Jones. He has long claimed that he “predicted” the attack on
9/11, that Osama bin Laden would be blamed, and that any future terrorist
attack in the U.S. would actually be perpetrated by the Bush administration.
Of course, Jones regularly made vague but dire predictions that there would
be terrorist attacks sometime in the future — not a big stretch of the imagination,
with regular footage of angry Islamic radicals waving banners and screaming
“Death To America!” on the news. It’s like playing roulette and always betting on 23;
sooner or later he was bound to be right. A stopped clock is right twice a day.
Examining the Main 9/11 
Conspiracy Theories
If we start getting into every single thing that conspiracists see in fuzzy photos
from weird angles, we’ll all be here till next St. Swithin’s Day. However, in this
section we address the most common 9/11 conspiracy theories — the ones
that are the bedrock of the genre.
The terrorist pilots weren’t trained well
enough to do what they did
All nervous, neurotic, terrified-to-fly types know that the most dangerous
moments in any plane are during take-off and landing. These are the moments
in which a plane is in the most jeopardy. Taking off, landing, dealing with
severe turbulence, and handling minor or major emergencies require the skill
of a pilot. But cruising is so easy that there’s a movement in aviation to allow
141
Chapter 8: Tracking the Evolution of the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories

pilots to sleep on miserably long flights, so they’ll be fresh for the important
part. The rest of the time, the copilot can handle things; the plane can handle
things, practically by itself. In short, it only takes brains to command a plane.
It doesn’t take brains to crash one.
142
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
Al-Qaeda
Al-Qaeda was born in a very different world —
bin Laden cut his teeth, militarily, on the
Russians who’d invaded Afghanistan late in
1979, and remained until 1989. Bin Laden’s orga-
nization, founded in 1988, made up a very small
and powerful minority of Saudi Arabians who
helped the Afghan rebels to drive the Russians,
and all other foreigners, out. The CIA gave them
help, and assumed they’d be grateful to
America. But for Al-Qaeda, the West was still
hated, whether they were Russians or
Americans or Belgians, for that matter. Like the
Taliban, Al-Qaeda has been a threat to regional
Middle Eastern security for years but was a
name hardly known in America. It was hard
enough to get a response to the name Osama
bin Laden, unless you prefaced it with, “You
know, that millionaire Saudi nut who’s a terror-
ist living out in the desert.” Both Hamas and the
PLO were far more well-known Islamic terrorist
organizations. But while the PLO was shattering
internally and Yasir Arafat was hiding in a
bunker from Israeli bombs, Al-Qaeda’s attacks
on the West, and America in particular, grew
bolder and closer all the time, the worst being
the two that occurred in this lead-up period:
 The first were the brazen, dual, American
Embassy bombings of August 7, 1998, one in
Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, the other in
Nairobi, Kenya, which took 225 lives and
wounded over 4,000 people.
 The second was the bombing of the
American destroyer USS Cole as it was
docked for refueling at the port of Aden in
Yemen, in October of 2000. Seventeen
sailors were killed, and 40 more wounded.
But most important, and totally discounted by
the 9/11 “Truth Movement” is the undeniable
fact that Al-Qaeda proudly claimed responsibil-
ity for attempting to blow up the North Tower of
the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993,
hoping to make it topple over and take down the
South Tower with it. Six people were killed in the
failed attempt. How is it a leap of the imagina-
tion to believe that the terrorist group would try
again, seeking out a more foolproof way to bring
down the towers?
So, as for the Truthers who contend that bin
Laden and Al-Qaeda are innocent, we have only
this to say: Bin Laden’s coy denials in videotapes
released to the Arabic Al Jazeera TV network
were deliberate messages to the West. In state-
ments to Middle Eastern henchmen, bin Laden
took full credit. Meanwhile, as Al-Qaeda cells
were busted in Europe and the Middle East,
ample proof of his involvement was uncovered.
He was, for awhile, playing the game out of the
Yasir Arafat playbook that helped to make the
Palestine 
Liberation 
Organization 
almost
respectable — deny it in the media of the West,
but proudly take the credit in the radical mosques
of the Middle East. But that game has fallen by the
wayside. In a November 2007 videotape sent to
Al Jazeera, bin Laden criticizes America’s war on
the Taliban in Afghanistan by stating that only he
and Al-Qaeda were responsible for 9/11.

As for finding their target, especially on a day as clear as September 11,
someone could do that with a map and a two-dollar compass. Or are we to
assume that a terrorist military operation planned for two years didn’t involve
even a glance at a map of the United States? There are even flight simulation
software packages for less than a hundred bucks that teach you, on your
computer, terrain and landmark recognition and basic navigational skills.
This would’ve helped them to learn the terrain they were flying over.
A lot of the Truther stuff about the hijackers seems not just patronizing, but
almost racist, as if they denied the ability of these Middle Eastern men to do
what they did. But this wasn’t done on the spur of the moment, or in an emo-
tional fit of anger or despair — this commando operation had all been care-
fully planned, to the most minute detail. Each of the four teams had one man
who was the pilot, and it was the job of what the 9/11 Commission termed
“the muscle hijackers” to keep them alive and get them into the pilot seat. As
for the terrorist pilots, take a look at the training that they did have:
 All four of these terrorist pilots obtained a license to fly private planes,
the easiest one to earn, which alone gave them basic aeronautical skills.
• Three went on to get FAA commercial pilot’s licenses for smaller
multi-engine aircraft, logging at least 250 hours in the air; the
fourth had this training, but hadn’t yet gotten his license.
• They all enrolled in flight simulation classes for large commercial jets.
 Just before the hijacking, they’d flown on these same flights before, up in
first class, where they could monitor the routine of the crews, and so on.
• Ghoulish or not, the fact is that each hijacker practiced not only
overcoming passengers in the aisles, but also slitting the throats of
animals with their small knives and box cutters.
• And, the icing on the cake — at least two of the pilots requested
and received training flights down New York’s Hudson Corridor,
while another took one over Washington, D.C.
For historians, the Hudson Corridor is the channel cut out of New
England by the Hudson River. It’s been said that it was a great feat
of navigation for the planes that left Boston’s Logan Airport to find
New York from western Vermont or New Hampshire. Unfortunately,
that’s not so. Clear from Lake Champlain on the U.S.-Canadian
border, this path of water that becomes the Hudson River points
like an arrow directly southward, down the eastern portion of New
York State, ending in an arrowhead that is the joining of the Hudson
and Long Island Sound; in the V sits the island of Manhattan. Historian
Colonel David Fitz-End calls the Hudson Corridor the “same old
invader’s road to war.” This is the route that the British used, not once
but twice to invade America, in the Revolutionary War and the War of
1812. This route delivered up both the British and the 9/11 terrorists
directly to the heart of New York City.
143
Chapter 8: Tracking the Evolution of the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories

 Apart from their knowledge of basic navigation, all four men purchased
and practiced with Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) systems. If you take
this little GPS box and stand in front of, say, the World Trade Center, it will
tell you your exact coordinates in longitude and latitude within 20 feet.
 These terrorists were also trained to use the autopilot. The autopilot is
connected to a computerized navigation system. After taking over the
cockpit, all they had to do was reset the navigation computer for the
coordinates of their targets that they’d already obtained if they got
disoriented.
But none of the pilots needed to fly on instruments to locate their enormous
and singular-looking targets — it’s estimated that the Twin Towers could be
seen at least 50 miles away on such a clear day. One Truther accusation is
correct; none of the terrorists did great in flight school. They weren’t there to
have a career in aviation. But there isn’t little doubt here; there’s no doubt at
all that the flight tasks they performed were perfectly within their abilities.
One thing more, on the subject of skill. The two planes that hit the WTC were
Boeing 767-200s. The other two planes were Boeing 757s. The two planes are
similar, but there can be minor differences from one model to the next, just
like cars. Also, modifications can be made by the airline that buys the plane
from Boeing. The terrorists trained in cockpits that were similar to these two
planes. But nothing short of the day of the hijacking could actually put them
in those pilot seats, which caused the terrorists’ only mistake.
Part of the terrorists’ plan was brilliant — they were to turn off their
“transponders,” which are navigational devices that send a message to air
traffic controllers on the ground. This message displays their plane’s flight
number and altitude on its individual radar blip being monitored by the con-
trollers. The terrorists were also told not to reply to any radio contact from
the ground. These two things made it very difficult for the controllers to
figure out what was going on before it was too late. But it was the flub on the
part of two of the pilots, who thought they were only on the plane’s PA system
talking to the passengers, but who were in fact speaking to the ground, that let
the air traffic controllers in on the fact that it wasn’t a technical problem, but a
hijacking of some sort.
Terrorists can’t hold passengers at bay
with simple plastic knives or box cutters
Some of the most distasteful remarks of the conspiracists have been made
over the assertion that the terrorists couldn’t have kept control over the
passengers who greatly outnumbered them with the weapons they pos-
sessed. Now try some truth.
144
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

First of all, only one of the sets of terrorists used box cutters, and they, like
all the others, had knives as well, sharp 4-inch blades such as Swiss Army
knives, that were allowed at the time to be carried in hand luggage. When the
takeovers began, the slightest resistance resulted in an immediate and bloody
killing, to terrorize the other passengers. Also, in the same way that the 300
Spartans were able to hold off a quarter of a million Persians, the hijackers
were only guarding a narrow aisle, a corridor up which the passengers had to
come no more than two at a time. This made the defense of the cockpit against
a larger force a lot easier for the terrorists.
There are two other facts ignored by those who say these so-called “muscle
hijackers” couldn’t have subdued the passengers:
 First, they claimed to have bombs, and wore body-wrapped phonies that
looked real.
 Second, and far more powerful, is the fact that, for 30 years, all hijackings,
with only a couple of notable exceptions, have gone down the same way;
everybody stays quiet, they end up on the tarmac in Cuba or Beirut, and
the government bargains them out. This is exactly what the hijackers
told them — to remain quiet and calm, they were being returned to the
airport, and so on — on the announcements to passengers that air traffic
controllers weren’t supposed to hear.
The terrorists knew that everyone knew what they were supposed to do in a
hijacking. Attacking the terrorists seemed foolish in the extreme. But by the
time Flight 93 was over Pennsylvania, the passengers got news from the outside
world and realized that Flight 93 was a suicide mission. Then they attacked
the hijackers at once.
The most heartbreaking part of Flight 93 is that they came so close to
succeeding. Despite the narrow aisle, the passengers obviously managed to
overcome the muscle hijackers, then used a drink cart as a battering ram,
along with anything else they could lay hands on. The passengers actually
made it into the cockpit when the terrorists decided that if they could only
kill 44 people, that would have to do. The first thing the pilot did was to turn the
plane over, thereby throwing off his attackers, before he deliberately took the
plane down.
The Air Force was ordered to stand down
Thruthers say that it’s obvious, due to their lack of a successful response,
that the Air Force was ordered to “stand down” on 9/11 by either the president
or the vice president. They also claim that annual war games were deliberately
scheduled for September 11 in order to draw fighter planes away from the
East Coast.
145
Chapter 8: Tracking the Evolution of the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories

The conspiracy theory of having the Air Force stand down doesn’t wash
because the country was in peacetime. Now, maybe these conspiracy theo-
rists have just seen too many war pictures, but this nation doesn’t live under
a constant umbrella of fighter protection in peacetime — it isn’t necessary.
Besides, hijackings are considered an issue that falls, for the most part, under
civilian rather than military authority, so discussing this as a profound mili-
tary failure is a little pointless, anyway.
As for the annual war games, the most important one was called “Northern
Vigilance,” an exercise to simulate a potential Russian threat, that was taking
place up north, in Alaska and close to Canada. (The Russians were having
their own games at the same time in the same area, and also pulled out when
word reached them of the 9/11 attacks.) The Air Force has claimed the higher
state of alert during these games actually made their response speedier,
while the Truthers say it caused a failed response. The truth is, it didn’t have
much effect one way or the other. The same 14 planes were on call to be
deployed over the East Coast that were there in 2000, 1999, and 1998. It was
just standard peacetime operating procedure then.
The only difference the war games made was to cause a few moments of con-
fusion. In calls to NORAD (the North American Aerospace Defense Command)
from air traffic controllers, the recorded conversations have pilots asking
questions like, “Is this real world?” Of course they were momentarily con-
fused, and probably hoping it was just a new wrinkle to the war games some-
one cooked up. However, overall, there’s no evidence that the war games of
that day were some deep, dark plot, or had much effect on events one way or
the other.
In a normal emergency, if an air traffic controller’s supervisor has confirmed
a hijacking, the report goes up the FAA ladder to a hijack coordinator, through
layers of FAA and Department of Defense procedures, and then NORAD is
contacted by telephone, which simply wasn’t quick enough for that unprece-
dented day. After receiving a phone call, NORAD scrambles jets to escort —
not to shoot down — the hijacked plane. This is the only thing the military
does in a hijacking. No U.S. military plane has ever shot down an American
civilian aircraft before. They’re there to supply information and to enter the
fray in case of an emergency or a search and rescue.
On the day of September 11, 2001, 14 fighter jets were on standard alert
across the continental U.S. By the time the hijackers were tracked down, even
though at the bitter end, the pilots, once airborne, were given permission to
go supersonic (normally forbidden in civilian airspace), it was too late for
them to actually intercept the hijacked planes. And there was so much confu-
sion that day, it was difficult for the military pilots to be absolutely certain
that what they were headed for was a definite hijack. It was all happening too
fast in too many different places, just as the terrorists planned.
146
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

Much is made of the fact, by Truthers, that the military response was suspi-
ciously faster in the Payne Stewart case. It wasn’t. In this 1999 case, one of the
famous incidents of this sort of military escort, golfer Payne Stewart’s private
jet decompressed at 39,000 feet, killing or knocking out all on board, but the
plane was still in the air because the autopilot was on. Truthers report that
controllers lost contact with Stewart’s Learjet at 9:33 a.m., and that a military F-
16 jet reached the plane by 9:52, 19 minutes later. But they don’t bother to tell
you that the 9:33 loss of contact was at 9:33 eastern daylight time, while the 9:52
was central daylight time. This was two different time zones. In actuality, it took
the jet one hour and 19 minutes to reach Stewart’s plane, Also, this plane didn’t
have to scramble — it was already in the air on a training flight, although in
fact, it had to refuel. If it hadn’t, it could’ve reached the plane in about 50 min-
utes. But remember, on Stewart’s plane, the transponder was still operating,
making the plane easier to track. And it was one plane, not four. Considering
that, on 9/11, there were only 104 minutes from the first report of a hijacking
until the final crash of Flight 93, it’s time to admit that the Air Force did the
best they could on that incredible day.
As for the controllers being alert, even despite the accepted chain of proce-
dures, the supervisor at Boston’s Logan Airport smelled something funny,
and contacted NORAD directly. Two F-15s were immediately scrambled from
Otis Air Force Base in Massachusetts. But they couldn’t get any coordinates,
so they had no real idea where they were going. Things were just happening
too fast. Before they were even in the air, Flight 11 hit the North Tower. Hijackers
attacked so soon after take-off not only because the fuel tanks would be full,
but because they could turn about and hit their targets before anyone could
figure out what was going on. So the Otis-based fighters took off at 8:53 and were
given a standard vector to fly out over Long Island and await exact coordinates.
Meanwhile, Flight 75 was hijacked, while the same controller was still trying to
find Flight 11. Never before in aviation history had a controller dealt with
more than one hijacking at a time. At 9:03, 10 minutes later, New York Center
reported this second hijacking to NORAD, just as the plane was hitting the
South Tower. It was only afterwards that the scrambled jets were informed
that two planes hit the World Trade Center. At that point, they did the only
thing that they could do, which was to establish fighter cover over Manhattan,
circling over the ocean out of busy commercial flight paths, in case there was
another incoming plane.
And incidentally, if the Air Force was told to stand down that day, as the
Truthers allege, then why did so many thousands of witnesses see the fighter
jets fly over the city? Was it some sort of mass hallucination?
147
Chapter 8: Tracking the Evolution of the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories

The Twin Towers were brought down 
by bombs, not the airplanes
Some conspiracists believe that the Towers were brought down by bombs
that were planted in anticipation of the attack and were set off in a series of
explosions after the planes crashed. One of the events they love to bring up
is the crash of a B-25 bomber into the Empire State Building on a foggy day in
July of 1945. Incredibly, just 14 people were killed — 3 crew members and 11
office workers. But the two events weren’t nearly as similar as the conspir-
acists would have you believe.
A B-25 isn’t a 757
First, a B-25 carries, if it’s loaded with optional extra fuel tanks, less than
1,000 gallons of fuel. A standard load was more like 600 gallons. A fully-loaded
757 carries 24,000 gallons of jet fuel to get from New York to California.
Second, the bomber made a dead-on collision on the 79th floor of the Empire
State Building, just to the right of a load bearing column, thereby, luckily,
taking out none of them, which helped to minimize damage.
All the 9/11 terrorists were told to bring their planes in at an angle, which can
clearly be seen on the footage of the disaster. That way, they took out as
many floors as possible. (Remember that Osama bin Laden grew up in the
construction business and is a civil engineer — he knew what he was doing.)
Third, the B-25 bomber was going about 200 miles an hour, while the jets
were going over twice that fast, and the bomber was about a tenth of the
weight of a 757.
The Empire State Building versus the World Trade Center
The most important difference between the two events is in the essential
structural differences between the Empire State Building and the World Trade
Center:
 The Empire State Building is a web of thick steel girders, holding up a
limestone fortress. It’s a man-made Rock of Gibraltar, and comparing it
to the Twin Towers is like comparing Belgian lace to a brick.
 The World Trade Center was a revolutionary design, the culmination of a
whole new kind of construction for high rises. It was built to be flexible.
Because of its great height and its glass curtain exterior, it needed to flex
in high winds. That’s what these buildings were constructed to do. Several
employees of the Towers have said it took them awhile to get used to
the sensation; it’s somewhat like getting your sea legs.
The chief building support was a central core of steel girders that protected
elevators, heating and AC systems, and other essential building operations.
This lack of the Empire State’s girder system gave the Twin Towers 40,000
more square feet of office space per floor. Everything on the outside was
148
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

just glass, concrete, drywall, and lightweight steel trusses. These steel
trusses were load-bearing, as well, but to a much lesser degree. In a way,
they were simply a framework from which to hang the windows. This
made the buildings incredibly lightweight. The Empire State Building
weighs 38 pounds per cubic foot; the Twin Towers were just 9 or 10. The
structure, though huge, was downright airy, a central core supporting a
glass box for show.
The men who built the World Trade Center did design the structure with
a potential “worst-case scenario” in mind, the worst at that time being
an accidental collision of a Boeing 707, the largest passenger jet in the
mid-1960s. Of course, they were also assuming the plane would be
attempting to evade the building once it appeared in front of them. But
even the structural engineers who worked on the building admit that the
fuel load of the plane wasn’t something to which they gave much thought.
Fire can’t melt steel!
Many conspiracists believe that the fires started by the planes couldn’t have
brought these buildings down. This is our very favorite conspiracy theory,
though it’s usually delivered up as fact. Fire can’t melt steel. Right.
A fireman will tell you that fighting a fire in a high rise is like being inside a
chimney. Exactly like a chimney. Think about that. It’s the same method used,
even by primitive man, to get fires hot enough to melt down metal.
After the two planes crashed into the World Trade Center, the windows on
both sides of the towers shattered, and the high altitude wind was roaring in
off the ocean like an Olympian set of bellows, feeding the flames from the
thousands of tons of combustible materials in the buildings. The thousands
of gallons of fast-burning jet fuel burst into flames, creating, in effect, the
world’s biggest commercial-grade smelter, a blast furnace. You know — the
kind they use to melt steel into girders. Yes, in spite of the scientific research
conducted by bombastic amateurs, fire really does melt steel. Girders don’t
come gift-wrapped from the pig iron fairy.
The point here is that the fire didn’t have to get hot enough to melt the girders
into a puddle. It only had to soften and weaken them. Combined with the cat-
astrophic damage to the building, fireproofing was blown away and sprinkler
systems cut off, leaving nothing to lower the temperature. The final reports
estimated that the fires reached at least 1,000 degrees Celsius, or 1,832 degrees
Fahrenheit. Steel begins to loose its structural integrity at about 600 
degrees Celsius, and by 1,000, retains only about 10 percent of it. No, they
didn’t melt into a liquid pool. They bent, buckled, and could no longer bear
the load. This sent the weight to the outer truss beams that were never
intended to carry the weight to begin with.
149
Chapter 8: Tracking the Evolution of the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories

Apart from the usual handful of opportunistic grumblers, most structural
engineers contend that it was the skillful design of the Twin Towers that
allowed them to stand for as long as they did, which enabled thousands to
escape.
Unfortunately, the “pancake effect” of the collapse plays right into conspiracists’
hands, because it looks just like a controlled implosion done by demolition
experts, who’ve removed the building’s main supports, planted explosives on
key floors, and then brought the building down in just such a fashion, in
order to avoid damaging surrounding properties. For a minute there, even a
lot of civil engineers were shocked at the way the Twin Towers came down in
such a, well, an almost orderly fashion.
Again, this was an unprecedented event. When they thought about it, they
realized that the buildings couldn’t have come down any other way; they
couldn’t have tipped over onto Broadway. They were reacting to the damage
according to the immutable laws of gravity and physics. As each floor col-
lapsed onto the floor below, mountainous gusts of air were pushed out of that
floor, creating a visual impression of an explosion going on below the col-
lapse, at least to the eyes of conspiracists. But it is simply a force of nature,
as each floor hit the one below, collapsing the next and then the next. Despite
what conspiracy Web sites tell you, this isn’t unprecedented in a building 
collapse — it’s simply extraordinary on such a dramatic and catastrophic
scale.
The gobbledygook over WTC 7
The World Trade Center was a complex of seven buildings in total. World
Trade Center 3, the Marriott Center, was crushed when the North and South
towers collapsed. The four other nearby buildings — WTC 4, 5, 6, and 7 —
suffered horrific devastation. But the collapse of WTC 7 seven hours later is a
particular conspiracist favorite. In fact, it’s become their banner. Why? Come
now. Don’t be naïve. It’s because the CIA and the Secret Service had offices
there, that’s why! But the most damning “evidence” stems from an offhand
remark made by property owner Larry Silverstein, who told firefighters, “Pull
it,” when told of WTC 7’s imminent destruction.
Structural engineers are still studying what happened at WTC 7, but there are
some things we know for certain. The wreckage from the North Tower col-
lapse put a 20-story gash into the south side of WTC 7, but the image was
drenched in smoke and away from where most cameras were placed. This
gash helped to create the same chimney effect mentioned above. Large fires
were also burning in the rarely-if-ever-mentioned buildings of WTC 5 and 6.
Initial FEMA reports (like all initial reports, issued when confusion still
reigned supreme) were seized upon by conspiracists, because they said that
they couldn’t understand exactly why the building came down.
150
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

But in the FEMA photographs used to slap together the initial report, you
can’t see much of anything for all the smoke, much less a detailed study of
what was happening in those buildings. Later, when the National Institute of
Standards and Technology began a massive study, they came to the conclusion
that the building was far more compromised by falling debris than initially
supposed.
Tower 7 also had several other things going against it. It was built straddled
over a Con Edison substation, which may have caused a flaw in the design
that helped to speed its demise, compromising proper support in that area.
Also there were two 6,000-gallon diesel fuel tanks in the basement pumping
pressurized fuel to auxiliary power generators in the building, because this
was, by chance, the emergency command post for the City of New York — it
had to stay running if the lights went out. After a six-hour uncontrolled burn,
it was clear that the building was facing imminent progressive collapse. When
the building exterior began to visibly bulge, three different fire officials ordered
their people out. The slumping east side of the building went first, the pent-
houses were swallowed up, and the west side collapsed as well. Nobody pulled
it – which sounds like possible slang for taking down a building with explo-
sives, but isn’t. It was simply an unfortunate choice of words in the final order
of the building’s lease holder, Larry Silverstein.
Later, during the cleanup of ground zero, demolition teams attempted to
“pull” buildings 5 and 6, which in this instance means literally wrapping cable
around the sadly annihilated buildings and trying to safely pull them down so
that they can be dismantled. They couldn’t manage it, even with those far
smaller buildings. Building 7 was 47 stories tall, and nobody, no-how, was
going to try to “pull it.”
The intent of Mr. Silverstein’s words was simple — pull your people out of
there (“pull it” being common slang for this with firefighters, by the way). Pull
out of the effort to save it. Let it go. Stop fighting the fire, and don’t risk any
more lives. But the conspiracists have turned those two little words into a
conspiracy, as well. How would you like for every single word you said, in a
sentence in which your words may have gotten tangled up underfoot, espe-
cially while under great emotional stress, to be taken apart for years to
come? We wouldn’t.
Also, the initial FEMA report on building 7 made the mistaken and misleading
statement that they’d never seen a building of this structure taken down by
fire alone. Later, trained fire investigators and historians found a welter of
similar situations in which similar structures completely collapsed under
similar circumstances. 
151
Chapter 8: Tracking the Evolution of the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories

As for the absurd contention that, even if the Twin Towers came down the
way they said, building 7 was taken down on purpose in order to destroy
incriminating documents within the offices of the CIA and others, it’s so
stunningly stupid it almost defies a reasonable reply. It makes sense to these
conspiracists to involve hundreds, if not thousands of people in a conspiracy to
take out the building with airplane crashes and preplanted explosives in order
to destroy some paperwork? So, these guys never heard of a paper shredder?
The Towers Struck an Iceberg
There’s a lousy joke that’s about a century old. Some guy says the Jews were
behind the sinking of the Titanic, and when the other guy says he thought it
was an iceberg, the guy replies, “Iceberg, Goldberg, what’s the difference?”
152
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
Debunking, debunkers, and the 
science of debunkation
In the afterward to his popular bestseller
Debunking 9/11 Myths, James B. Meigs, editor-
in-chief of Popular Mechanics, said:
On February 14, 2005, I became a member
of the Bush/Halliburton/Zionist/CIA/New
World Order/Illuminati conspiracy for global
domination. It was on that day the March
2005 issue of Popular Mechanics, with its
cover story debunking 9/11 conspiracy the-
ories, hit newsstands. Within hours, the
online community of 9/11 conspiracy buffs . . .
was aflame with wild fantasies about me and
my staff, the magazine I edit, and the article
we had published.
He later adds, “We had begun our plunge down
the rabbit hole. Within hours, a post on www.
portland.indymedia.org, a Web site
which claims to be dedicated to ‘radical, accurate,
and passionate tellings of truth,’ called me ‘James
Meigs the Coward and Traitor.’” Well, that’s subtle.
According to Mr. Meigs, the invective and threats
began to pour in, calling the magazine a front for
the CIA, evil scum, puppet of the Mossad (Israeli
intelligence), yada, yada, yada.
This is a favorite “Truthers” tactic — don’t
address the facts, just demonize the opposition.
It’s an old ploy, but these guys have given it a
dangerous new razor’s edge. In fact, Mr.
Meigs’s afterward essay on “The Conspiracy
Industry” is a neatly written and brief but thor-
ough guidebook on the tactics used by conspir-
acists: demonizing the enemy, argument by
anomaly (if there’s one tiny fact we don’t yet
understand, then none of it is true), ceaseless
echoing of the same ideas from one book and
Web site to another, and of course, upping the
ante on the ever-expanding number of people
who are obviously in on the conspiracy or
who’ve been silenced by it, as one by one
experts and organizations find not a shred of
reason in their arguments.
However, we’ll risk life, limb, and reputation by
saying that of all the books out there on the con-
spiracies of 9/11, you won’t find a more infor-
mative one than Debunking 9/11 Myths.

Some things never change, and one of them is the existence of the kind of
person who blames the Jews for everything. From the price of toilet paper to
the hassle of daylight saving time, it’s all a Jewish plot. No, all Truthers aren’t
anti-Semitic. But it does say something about the movement as a whole that
so many anti-Semites have found a haven there.
While America was still grieving, still trying to come to grips with what hap-
pened, the first and perhaps the ugliest conspiracy theory began to hit the
Internet. Like a number-one song on the pop charts endlessly droning in your
ears, the first theory dredged up that age-old sentimental favorite of jack-booted
thugs everywhere — the Jews did it. Did you notice that over 4,000 Jewish work-
ers in the World Trade Center didn’t show up for work that day, after receiving a
warning phone call about the attacks? Yeah. We didn’t notice it, either.
The neocon menace
Here’s how this conspiracy theory goes. Apparently, barbeque-mad, Western,
boot-and-hat-wearing George Bush, son of Texas oil money, is really controlled
behind the scenes by a small cabal (they love that word for a sinister little group)
of evil Jews called neocons. Heard the term before? It’s short for “neoconserva-
tives,” and in very broad, general terms, it means former liberals, from “red
diaper babies” to 1960s campus radicals, who’ve become conservatives — a
new kind of conservative. And yes, many of them in places of power are Jewish.
In the case of this conspiracy theory, neocon is a code word, meaning “the bunch
of Jews running the administration who only care what happens to Israel.”
According to this theory, George Bush is an accommodating boob who was
tricked by his Jewish handlers into looking the other way, while they set up
9/11. And why would they do that, you ask? Because Afghanistan and Iraq,
both peace-loving nations, were certainly no threat to America, but they were
a threat to the conniving Zionist Jews in Israel that are the sinister comrades-
in-arms of the Zionist, Freemasonic, Illuminati plotters in the White House.
And the only way that they could dupe powerful America into doing their
dirty work for them and creaming these two countries is by crafting an attack
so vicious, so diabolical, that Americans would never forgive and forget, and
never look the other way as they have at so many embassy bombings and
kidnappings and regular, standard-issue hijackings in the past.
Look, we don’t write ’em, we only report ’em.
An organization of neocons that’s most particularly in conspiracist gun sights
was founded by Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan, and called the Project for the
New American Century. Both men are Jewish, so it’s always big on the paranoia
hit parade. On the other hand, many neoconservatives, from Rupert Murdoch
to Donald Rumsfeld, aren’t Jewish. What the Jewish portion of neoconserva-
tivism really represents are former influential liberal Jewish intellectuals who
slowly changed into influential conservative Jewish intellectuals. Men like
153
Chapter 8: Tracking the Evolution of the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories

publisher and TV pundit Bill Kristol, son of the ultimate neocon Irving Kristol,
decided that liberalism of the 1970s and 1980s had drifted so far from basic
American principles that it no longer constituted a “viable and cohesive set
of ideals on which to run a country.” And, as far as Jewish liberals are con-
cerned, them’s fightin’ words.
The “proof” is in the poetry
Arguably, the starting point of this conspiracy theory can be traced to the
poet Amiri Baraka (born Everett LeRoi Jones). He was the poet laureate of
New Jersey. (The poet laureate of New Jersey?) In his ode Somebody Blew Up
America, he wrote:
Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed/Who told 4,000
Israeli workers at the Twin Towers/To stay home that day/Why did Sharon
stay away/Who know [sic] why Five Israelis was filming the explosion/and
cracking they sides at the explosion?
Well, it’s not exactly Tennyson. All artistic merits aside, it blatantly helped to
spread two completely absurd lies:
 4,000 Jewish workers didn’t show up at the World Trade Center on 9/11.
 Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon was scheduled to speak in Manhattan
that day and cancelled at the last minute.
This whole grim fairy tale got started when Syria’s government-owned news-
paper, Al Thawra (now there’s an unimpeachable source), reported from
nowhere on September 15 that 4,000 Jews hadn’t shown up for work that day
at the World Trade Center. It seems that they twisted this fantasy out of a
statement in an article in the Jerusalem Post that the government was attempting
to find 4,000 Israeli nationals who were in the Manhattan area on the day of the
explosions. Many foreign governments were doing this, since hundreds of, for
example, British and French nationals were killed on that day.
Of course, it’s sheer lunacy. If you’re the sort that finds any comfort in figures
regarding dead people, it’s provable lunacy. A total of 2,071 occupants of the
World Trade Center were killed that day. Of that number, based on the word
of family members and the records of the medical examiner’s office, at least
400 victims were confirmed to have been Jewish. That represents roughly 15
percent of the total victims, which is in line with the percentage of Jews in
the population of New York City and the state; actually, it’s a shade higher.
Probably the most dangerous part about the Jewish 9/11 conspiracy theories
is the way that they’re so enthusiastically embraced by our enemies in the
Middle East. While most really wild and wooly conspiracy theories only make
it to the Internet in America, or sometimes into self-published books, they
make the front pages of the major newspapers in the Islamic world, reported
154
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 

as gospel (pardon the expression) truth. And probably the most depressing
part about this conspiracy theory is that, even though it’s the one that got
going first, it’s proved to be the one with the most staying power. It still plays
a key role in a huge number of Truther and conspiracist accusations.
History is truth. The people who study the history of a past event, whether
it’s ten or ten thousand years in the past, are patient sojourners after truth,
because they know that truth is mankind’s only life preserver, and so it’s our
most precious possession. Truth is the only hold we have on reality. A
famous maxim states that those who don’t remember history are destined to
repeat it. But those who twist the truth beyond recognition are destined not
just to face a repeat performance of history, but to become its first victims.
155
Chapter 8: Tracking the Evolution of the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories
Screws loose in Loose Change
One of the most spectacular, and unexpected,
successes of the “Truth Movement” has been a
college-made video by three 20-something
Truthers: Dylan Avery, Korey Rowe, and Jason
Bernas. Like the Hardy Boys on crack, they set
out to do their own scathing investigative jour-
nalism into the “lies” about 9/11. The video,
Loose Change, was made on a laptop computer
by using footage cobbed off the Internet.
(Tellingly, the project started out as a fictional
story.) Sometimes rising far above its limitations
in quality, it plays right out of the Jolly Joe Stalin
Handbook for Propaganda, filled with unsup-
ported assertions, scurvy intimations, and some
out-and-out lies. They use simplistic, unscien-
tific arguments to prove their points, and they
go cherry-picking for quotes from government
officials, to juxtapose unrelated statements in
order to make it sound like the government
knew ahead of time. Some of their claims
include the following:
 The fires in the Towers weren’t hot enough
to melt steel. Quite the contrary — they
were plenty hot enough to weaken the gird-
ers, causing them to structurally fail under
the weight of the floors above.
 The Empire State Building wasn’t knocked
down when it was hit by a B-52, so the
WTC Towers should’ve survived the
smaller plane hits. The Empire State
Building wasn’t hit by a B-52. It was a much
smaller, lighter, slower B-25.
 Terrorist hijackers couldn’t have been
flying the planes, because the moves they
executed were unsafe. What part of “they
were intending to crash them” do these
boys not understand?
 The South Tower was hit by an unmarked,
gray jet, with no airline markings. Maybe it
looks unmarked when played back on an
iPod, but the United paint job is undeniable
in frame enlargements.
 $167 billion in gold was stored under the
World Trade Center and was secretly
removed. It was really $230 million — not
chump change, but considerably less than
their outrageous claim, and all of it was
recovered and accounted for.
 Flight 93 didn’t crash in Pennsylvania. They
claim the real Flight 93 was loaded with
some 200 passengers from all four planes
and landed in Cleveland, where the
continued

156
Part II: A Colossal Compilation of Conspiracy Theories 
passengers were taken off and, presum-
ably, “disposed of.” The problem with this
one being that the total manifest of all four
planes couldn’t fit onboard Flight 93. At
other times they claim Flight 93 did crash in
Pennsylvania, but after being shot down by
the military.
 A mysterious “pod” was mounted under
the fuselage of one of the planes, clear evi-
dence that it’s a massive bomb. Both planes
that hit the Trade Towers were 767-200s.
Comparisons with 767s under the same
lighting simply show a bulge where the
wings join the main body of the jet. This
reckless claim was so loudly debunked
almost immediately that the boys quickly
edited it out of subsequent versions.
Probably the worst claim was in their first ver-
sion of the film, which is hard to get your hands
on. Not surprising, since they’ve retreated from
so much of the garbage in it. In their original
film, they asserted that the phone calls from
loved ones onboard the hijacked planes were
phonies. Because pilots have never allowed
passengers to use cell phones in flight (they
have the potential to interfere with the cockpit
radios) this “documentary” (or maybe “mocku-
mentary”?) was able to get away with saying
that cell phones don’t function between 30,000
and 40,000 feet. Actually, most of the calls were
made from onboard telephones. However, when
the scientists working for Popular Mechanics
were able to easily disprove their assertion
about cell phones, one of these shrewd jour-
nalists said in a recent documentary on 9/11
conspiracy theories, “Well, we’re editing that
out in our new version, because we don’t want
to loose our credibility.”
When the documentary claimed that these phone
calls, the last words of wives to husbands and
sons to mothers, were phonies created by the
federal government as part of the plot, it was too
much for even the nuttiest of Truthers.
Subsequent versions of the video had the dis-
gusting assertion edited out. New edits of the
video continue to be released, as one by one their
most appalling claims get blasted out of the water
(www.screwloosechange.com).
Each version of the video will probably be more
slick and convincing than the one before, but
we give you fair warning. The politics of these
three is a little more than just edgy. Recently the
perpetrators of Loose Change were interviewed
by Eric Hufschmid, an all-purpose rabble-rouser
who is also a devout Holocaust denier. (For
more on the phenomenon of Holocaust denial,
see Chapter 6.) When Hufschmid accused them
of not spending enough time in their documen-
tary making it clear that the Jews were behind
9/11, this was the lucid response of Jason
Bermas:
“Take our word for it; we’re well aware of
the Illuminati and the New World Order, and
we’re well aware that there are people who
want an all-Jewish state. We realize that all
these things exist, but that’s not what we’re
about.” Bermas later added, “We’re hoping
to get to the bottom of this Zionist criminal
network you’re talking about.”
There’s a reason that Loose Change was seen
in the vast, jumbled ocean of the World Wide
Web, rather than on, say, CBS. The wild and
wooly, and often fact-free world of the Internet
is sort of a sandwich board for the alienated, a
place where they can say what they like with-
out being answerable to anyone. Most televi-
sion shows won’t even interview the Loose
Change triumvirate, for fear of giving them a
forum to spread their views. Or, as comedian Bill
Marr said, “Will you people stop asking me to
do a show on this subject, and start asking your
doctor if Paxil may be right for you?”

f you’re over the age of 60, you probably know who the Freemasons 
are — you might be one, or your dad or a relative may very well have 
been a member. At its most basic level, Freemasonry, or just Masonry, is the
largest, oldest, and best-known gentlemen’s fraternity in the world. Like 
college fraternities, this group binds its members together into a brother-
hood by providing a shared initiatory experience (without the binge drinking,
wedgie fights, pink bellies, and depantsing). Initiation into the Freemasons 
is a serious and solemn ritual ceremony, and that ritual unites its members
everywhere in the world.
In 1900, one out of every four adult American men was a member of some
kind of fraternal organization, and the Masons were the premiere group to
join. When they were in their heyday in the 1950s, there were more than 
4 million Freemasons in the U.S. alone. That number has declined to just
under 2 million today, with about 5 million worldwide.
The baby boomer/Vietnam-era men, who rejected anything that sniffed of
“The Establishment,” brought a long decline in interest and membership, 
but Freemasonry seems to be on the upswing again. Popular references in
movies, television, fiction, and even comic books generated buzz on the
Internet. In the past, prospective applicants needed to ask a known Mason 
for a petition or be referred by existing members, today’s new petitioners
pound on lodge doors electronically, via Masonic Web sites.
Even Dan Brown’s original Da Vinci Code book cover contained a clue for 
his long-anticipated sequel that implied it was about the Freemasons and
Washington, D.C. Freemasonry seems to be everywhere.

With new popularity has come new — or in most cases, resurrected — 
notoriety and suspicion. With one notable period in the 1820s and ’30s,
Freemasons in the United States have historically been regarded as pillars of
their communities, upright, clean-living, trustworthy, and charitable. That
hasn’t been the case outside of the U.S., where the Masons were accused of a
wide range of crimes, from petty deceptions to world domination, and every-
thing in between. Depending on the country, Masons were ridiculed, hounded,
arrested, imprisoned, and even executed, right up into the 21st century.
This chapter explains who the Masons are, why they attract conspiracy theo-
ries to themselves like Angelina Jolie attracts tattoos and tabloid paparazzi,
and why so many groups copy their rituals and their structure. For even
more detail about the Freemasons than we can go into in the context of this
book, see Freemasons For Dummies (Wiley) by Christopher Hodapp.
Examining the Origins of Freemasonry
The Freemasons are arguably the world’s best-known and least hidden 
secret society, and they’ve been portrayed as an object of ridicule as well as
a dark and sinister force since the early 1700s. The modern fraternity of
Freemasonry began in Scotland and England throughout the last half of the
1600s, but its legendary origins go back to the stonemason guilds of the tenth
century in the English town of York. And its mythical beginnings are said to
date to 1,000 BC with the building of King Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem.
Boiled down to its simplest philosophy, the modern day Freemasons are
based on the cathedral builders of the Middle Ages, and they use the termi-
nology of the stonemasons to teach their members allegorical lessons about
morality, charity, and honor. Instead of building cathedrals out of stone, the
Masons say they’re building cathedrals in the hearts of their members.
Very briefly, Freemasonry is a great big club, primarily for men, that uses sym-
bolism and ritual to initiate its members and to teach them allegorical, moral
lessons. The stated goal of the fraternity is to take good men and improve
them morally, spiritually, and emotionally, by encouraging them to cultivate
brotherly love, charity, honesty, and integrity. Masons believe they can
improve society by making men better husbands, fathers, sons, and citizens.
Freemason lodges can be found in nearly every country on Earth. Certainly
their existence is no secret. In the United States, Masonic lodges are listed in
the phone book, and their activities are frequently covered by local newspa-
pers. Masons wear rings, hats, and belt buckles sporting the organization’s
160
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

well-recognized symbol: the square and compasses, usually with the letter
“G” appearing in the middle (which stands for the combination of geometry
and God, referred to as the Great Architect of the Universe). They have 
Web sites and blog sites and have even recently started advertising for new 
members on television.
So what’s the big secret?
The Masons themselves often use the somewhat coy expression, “We’re 
not a secret society — we’re a society with secrets.” In recent years to help
increase their membership, they’ve gone out of their way to throw open the
doors of their lodges, invite the press in, and declare, “We have no secrets,
apart from passwords and funny handshakes.” And, indeed, on the surface,
taken very literally, that is so. The distinction is in how you perceive the 
concept of secrecy.
The Freemasons have three different levels in the initiation of their members,
called degrees, which are based on terminology from the medieval stonema-
sons’ guilds from which the Masons are ostensibly descended (there are
additional degrees in associated Masonic organizations, and we discuss them
later in this chapter):
 New members are initiated and made Entered Apprentices.
 Next, they’re passed to the degree of Fellow Craft (or Fellows of 
the Craft).
 And finally, they’re raised to the third degree, the Master Mason.
The Masons weren’t the first to have such trappings. There have been 
initiatory ceremonies in Ancient Rome, Greece, Egypt, and long before (see
Chapter 3). But for some reason, when the Freemasons started performing
them shortly after their public formation in London in the early 1700s, 
their detractors immediately piled on, both with hoots of derision and dire
warnings of evil doings.
We’re going to let the cat out of the bag right now and tell you the Very Big
Secrets of the Freemasons. Sort of. The secrets of Freemasonry are (cue the
eerie organ music):
 Passwords: These are part of the methods of recognition used to keep
non-Masons from entering a lodge meeting. Nobody gets in without
knowing the password, and it’s different depending on what part of the
world you’re in and on what “degree” the meeting is being opened on.
161
Chapter 9: The Freemasons: The World’s Longest-Running Secret Society

 Grips: These are the different handshakes used, in conjunction with the
password, to be admitted into the lodge. Again, depending on the degree,
there are different ones. Grips may also be exchanged in social settings
outside of the lodge to quietly determine if another person is a Mason.
Masons do this all the time, and it really creeps out wives and girlfriends.
 Signs: These are specific hand gestures used in a lodge meeting as 
a salute between members and officers. Again, there’s a different one 
for each degree. You may have heard your great aunt Matilda say,
“Granddad’s car broke down once. He went out and made some funny
signal and three Masons pulled over to help us.” That’s what she was
talking about. It still works.
 Steps: These refer to a specific placement of the feet, which are accom-
panied by the signs as part of a salute.
 “The secrets of a Brother Mason, when communicated as such”:
This is when the truly nervous types get truly nervous. Masons obligate
themselves to keep a brother’s secret if asked to do so — murder or 
treason excepted. Conspiracy lovers and secrecy haters, please feel 
free to leap from your reading chairs at this point and scream, “Ah-HA!”
Except that this directive is really not about secrecy, but about honor
and keeping your word. Much of what goes on in Masonic rituals deals
with that somewhat quaint, old-fashioned, out-of-date concept of honor.
But this obligation doesn’t mean Masons lie or cover up for each other.
 The particulars of the three degree ceremonies: Okay, we won’t be
telling you a lot about these, because the point of initiatory ceremonies
in any given group is to not ruin the surprises for the initiates. But it’s
another aspect of honor. The degree rituals of Freemasonry have been
available in bookstores, written by eavesdroppers, former Masons, and
other opportunistic weasels, almost since the fraternity was publicly
formed in 1717. Masons know that non-Masons can find out anything
they really want to know. But a new Mason promises to keep these
secrets, even if the whole world knows them, as a token of his personal
pledge of honor to his fraternal brothers. It’s a symbol of his integrity,
which is why Chris won’t show his mom the handshakes.
The Internet is rife with examples of the literally dozens — if not hundreds —
of symbols used in the many different branches of Freemasonry (see 
Figure 9-1). These aren’t secrets at all, and are used by Masons as part of
their allegorical lessons, or at times, to help Masons memorize their rituals
(Masonic ceremonies are usually recited by officers from memory). It’s no
exaggeration to say that there are enough books available to fill an entire
library about interpreting Masonic symbols, and every Masonic author 
(and every anti-Masonic author, for that matter) has his own opinion of what
the symbols of Freemasonry mean.

Dating back to the Old Testament
Some of Freemasonry’s legends claim that the group was descended 
from the great builders of the Old Testament — the Tower of Babel and King
Solomon’s Temple. By making such claims, Freemasons figured they gave
themselves a more “ancient” and impressive pedigree. Other legends of the
origin of Freemasonry have been advanced over the years. Here are a few
that some Masons and historians have speculated about, with very little 
(if any) proof. Most modern Masonic scholars regard them as balderdash:
 Freemasonry may have been founded by the ancient Egyptians, who 
created the pyramids — the pinnacle of geometry, architecture, and the
building arts.
 Masonry may have descended from the ancient Greek mystery schools
(discussed in Chapter 3), especially the Pythagoreans (named after 
the creator of the Pythagorean theorem that was drummed into your
head by your 7th grade math teacher). This theory accounts for the 
preoccupation the Masons have for geometry in their ceremonies.
 Masonry may have been created out of the Rosicrucians, possibly by
alchemists. Many of the early speculative Masons like Robert Moray and
Elias Ashmole were also students of Rosicrucianism, and they may have
brought a lot of those philosophies with them into their Masonic lodges.
 Freemasonry may have been created by the medieval Knights Templars,
who had been excommunicated and disbanded between 1307 and 1314.
The problem with these and other legendary origins is that non-Masons take
them as fact, or at least as being worthy of strong speculation. In most cases,
these theories were created by wishful thinkers and speculative Masons who
sought a more ancient origin. Just seeing similarities in organizations, soci-
eties, philosophies, and words that came before Freemasonry’s big change 
in the late 1600s ignores the strong probability that the new Enlightenment-
era organizers of the fraternity borrowed from many sources to create 
something new.
There were certainly influences from many of these earlier groups, and
philosophies were added to Masonic ritual, degrees, ceremonies, and 
vocabulary over the years, but it isn’t credible to believe that Freemasonry
itself has a clear line of descent from Egypt, Greece, or even the Templars 
of the 13th century. Most important, modern Freemasonry was developed 
by Enlightenment thinkers, who specifically rejected superstition and the
occult — which is what makes allegations that Freemasonry is occult 
somewhat comical.
164
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Evolving into modern Masons: Operative
and speculative periods
In their history, Freemasons speak of two periods:
 The operative period, when they were actual stonemasons building
churches, castles, and bridges
 The speculative period, when operative Freemasonry evolved into 
a philosophical fraternity
So today, here’s what’s really known about the origins of modern day
Freemasonry:
 The first stonemason guilds appeared in England in 926 AD under 
King Athelstane, grandson of Alfred the Great. They were essentially
trade unions, charged with training their members, setting wages, and
guaranteeing a level of quality for their work.
 Guild members formed themselves into lodges — the equivalent of
today’s union locals, centered around specific construction projects.
Lodge became a word both for the group of members, as well as for a
cabinlike structure on the construction site where the members 
gathered for education, meals, initiation of new apprentices, socializing,
and sometimes even sleeping.
 Written records of the Mason guilds that detail their rules, activities, and
organization have survived. The earliest is the Regius Manuscript, from
1390 AD. Modern Masons would later use these records as inspiration 
to create their own rules, rituals, and practices.
 The first records of speculative, non-stonemasons joining operative
stonemasons’ lodges were Robert Moray in 1641 in Scotland and Elias
Ashmole in England in 1646. Both men were members of the The Royal
Society of London For The Improvement Of Natural Sciences after its 
formation in 1660, and started what would be a regular association of
Royal Society gentlemen joining Freemason lodges. Between Moray’s
and Ashmole’s initiation into Freemasonry, and its official founding in
1717, the nature of the fraternity completely changed, and no one fully
understands how or why. Over the next 50 years, London lodges began
admitting nonlaboring gentlemen as speculative or “accepted” Masons.
And the groups also began meeting in pubs.
 In 1717, four London lodges, named after the taverns in which they 
met, held a joint meeting at the Goose and Gridiron Pub near St. Paul’s
Cathedral and announced the formation of the “premiere” Grand Lodge
of England. The first grand officers elected at the meeting were all 
“gentlemen,” and not operative Masons. The Freemasons were now 
officially, wholly speculative and visible to the public.
165
Chapter 9: The Freemasons: The World’s Longest-Running Secret Society

Modern Mason Methods 
and Memberships
Modern Freemasonry was created during the time of the Enlightenment in
Europe, largely in Scotland and in England. Both countries suffered through
centuries of internal wars, many of them motivated over the struggle between
Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The English Civil War seemed to be 
the final powder keg that led to the Enlightenment. The philosophy of the
Enlightenment was to put an end to superstition, magic, and surmise, and
replace it with rational thought and the scientific method — a bold goal at a
time when a belief in witchcraft and the religious persecution of heretics were
all still in full force. At the time of Freemasonry’s beginnings, people were still
being burned at the stake or having their feet roasted off in ecclesiastical 
dungeons over the question of whether there were five holy sacraments or
just two.
The Freemasons brought the ideas of the Enlightenment into their lodge
rooms and put them into practice. The lodges were places of true equality.
Two topics — politics and religion — were forbidden to be discussed in open
meetings. Out in the street at the time, such discussions in the company 
of the wrong types of people could get you killed, or at least worked over by
unsympathetic men wielding hot, pointy, uncomfortable devices.
Freemasons meet in a building called a Masonic Temple, a Masonic Center, 
or simply a Lodge. Throughout most of the world, a lodge has a name and
usually an identifying number assigned to it by the state or country’s 
governing Grand Lodge (for example, Ancient Landmarks Lodge No. 319).
The neighborhood lodges you find around the world are referred to by sev-
eral descriptions. In everyday usage, they’re interchangeable:
 Symbolic Lodge: This term was taken from the many symbols used as
part of the Masonic ritual ceremonies.
 Craft Lodge: Because Masonry is believed to have come from the
medieval craft guilds, the fraternity is often called the Craft, and the
lodge is a Craft Lodge. This term does not mean witchcraft.
 Blue Lodge: This term is the most common one for a local lodge and
may come from a line in the ritual ceremony of the first degree referring
to the canopy of heaven, meaning the sky. It may also have to do with
the traditional color decorating English Masonic aprons, which is 
light blue.
166
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Hints of suspicion
It wasn’t long after the Freemasons formed that they spread literally around
the world, by way of the colonizing ships of the English, French, Dutch, and
other European powers. The 18th century saw Freemason lodges open in
major cities and even minor outposts, and it wasn’t long before the important
men in a given area wanted to be a member. While on paper Freemasonry
talked of universal brotherhood and the equality of Man, in reality it was one
of the first, biggest, and most influential private clubs in the world, and the
lodges were always happy to have the mayor or the banker or the principal
churchmen or the successful businessmen ask for membership. And that, of
course, is where the first whiffs of suspicion came from.
The Masons were bringing the concepts of the Enlightenment out of the lofty,
utopian-minded salons of the philosophers and putting them into practical
use. Its origins in the mid-1600s occurred while Europe’s nations were busy
making war on each other, and even on their own citizens — over the so-
called “divine right of kings” to have a guaranteed job for life, and over whose
church was the most properly Christian. What the Freemasons did was to
take the Enlightenment notions of scientific knowledge, reason, equality, 
freedom, and “natural law” and apply them to the operation of their new 
fraternity. And that’s where the seeds of suspicion first came from.
Royal objections
Kings didn’t much care for Freemasonry because Masonic lodges let all their
members vote for their officers. This was a drop-dead terrifying notion for a
king, because if his subjects got the idea that they could actually vote for or
against someone in authority, his Majesty may have an open rebellion on his
hands. And, of course, the Masons met behind closed doors, where plots
could be hatched.
Kings in France and the German states, in particular, were wary of the growth
of Masonry in their countries. English Masons, on the other hand, made a
shrewd move early on — they courted members of the English royal family.
Since the mid-1700s, a royal (usually the prince of Wales) has generally
served as the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England.
Papal objections
The Catholic Church didn’t care for the Masons either, because the lodges
had a strictly ecumenical, nonsectarian arrangement. Britain’s citizens, where
Freemasonry began, had spent more than two centuries killing each other
over religion, so the founders of Freemasonry established a nonsectarian
rule: A man could become a Mason, so long as he believed in a “supreme
being” and an afterlife. What church he attended — Catholic, Quaker,
Protestant, Anglican, Calvinist, even Jewish — didn’t matter (as long as he
attended some church). His private beliefs could remain private.
167
Chapter 9: The Freemasons: The World’s Longest-Running Secret Society

That didn’t set well in an age when governments were intertwined with 
official, established religions, and keeping one’s job (or at times, one’s head)
depended on your personal declaration of the “right” church as yours. In
addition, all those ideas about voting could affect the Catholic Church in 
particular. Disgruntled faithful may get it in their heads to “replace” a pope.
Public perceptions
The public, on the other hand, seemed to quickly embrace the reputation the
Freemasons were quickly creating for themselves — of honorable, upstand-
ing men who were the leaders in their communities. Freemasons made up a
large number of the Founding Fathers in the U.S., including George
Washington, Ben Franklin, John Hancock, Paul Revere, and many others. And
Freemasons performed public cornerstone dedication ceremonies for many
projects, including the White House and the U.S. Capitol building.
The Freemasons weren’t the first secret society to have passwords, secret
handshakes, rituals, initiation rites, special clothing, and other hallmark 
practices. But they were, perhaps, the best-known group that actually came
out into the open. The Masons quickly became popular enough that, even if
the public didn’t actually know the details of what went on in the lodge room,
they came to hear about the basics.
It was that popularity that would lead to literally thousands of clubs, 
societies, and other groups that would copy the practices of the Masons 
over the next 300 years, up through today. Organizations as diverse as the
Odd Fellows and the Catholic Knights of Columbus, to college fraternities 
and the Boy Scouts’ Order of the Arrow, would all base their ceremonies and
infrastructure on the format created by the Freemasons in 1717.
The basic Masonic degrees of membership
As we say earlier in this chapter, in the Symbolic lodge (the average neigh-
borhood lodge), new candidates progress through the three most basic levels
of initiation (called degrees) to become a full, voting member: the Entered
Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, and finally, the Master Mason degrees. In U.S.
lodges, progressing through these degrees can take weeks or months, and
some state Grand Lodges will even have large events and confer all three in
one single day. In other parts of the Masonic world, the progress through the
degrees is much slower, and can take up to a year.
In the early 1700s, Masons conferred just two degrees on their members: 
the Entered Apprentice degree was the initiation of a new member, and the
Fellow Craft was the second degree ritual that made the man a full member.

Between 1725 and 1738, a third degree — called the Master Mason degree —
was created and introduced into the London lodges that quickly spread
throughout the rapidly growing fraternity. This degree tells the story of the
building of King Solomon’s Temple in 1000 BC in Jerusalem and its principal
architect, Hiram Abiff. The story of the third degree was an immediate hit
throughout most of the fraternity, and it became so popular as an additional
degree conferred in lodges that by 1738 it was officially made part of the full
lodge rituals by the Grand Lodge of England.
Aspiring to more and “higher” degrees
If one new degree could be added in 1738 (see the preceding section), the
door was now open to adding even more degrees. Over the next 150 years, 
literally hundreds of degrees associated with Freemasonry were created by
an ever-expanding list of side organizations (known as appendant bodies),
along with unauthorized pseudo-Masonic groups that walked, talked, and
quacked like Freemasonry. These different developments and influences are
covered in the following sections.
Chevalier Ramsay’s Oration
In 1730, a Scottish expatriate in France, Chevalier Andrew Michael Ramsay,
presented a paper to Le Louis d’Argent Lodge in Paris. Known today as
“Ramsay’s Oration,” he claimed that Freemasonry had originated before the
days of ancient Egypt, and that its mysterious secrets (whatever they were)
had been lost. He claims that these secrets were rediscovered by the knights
of the Crusades in the Holy Land and brought back to Europe. He didn’t 
mention the knights by name, but it was quickly surmised that he meant the
Knights Templar (he had meant the Knights of St. John, actually), and the
secrets they found must have been buried under the site of King Solomon’s
Temple.
A flurry of French degree inventions
French Freemasons in particular went wild over Ramsay’s story, and set off
inventing a whole casserole of new degrees. What particularly appealed to
France’s middle- and upper-class joiners was the notion that Freemasonry
may have had a more noble and heroic origin than just a scruffy old labor
union of rock carvers. Everyone could now have a title of nobility, even if 
it was just in the lodge.
The new degrees pulled material from all kinds of sources: biblical, historical,
and even the fresh discoveries of Napoleon in Egypt in the early 1800s. Some
degrees told stories that extended the tale of Hiram Abiff and the building of
Solomon’s Temple and some were sequels or prequels to his story. Other
degrees flashed forward to the age of crusading knights. But all of them told
some allegory of charity, fidelity, honor, and brotherhood.

Baron Von Hund
Sometime between 1742 and 1751, a German with the unwieldy name of Karl
Gotheif, Baron Von Hund, und Alten-Grotkau (or just Baron Von Hund to his
friends) was initiated into a French lodge (or claimed he had been, anyway)
that centered around a Knights Templar legend. Baron Von Hund said he 
had been received into this lodge by a very mysterious and unknown, “Knight
of the Red Feather.” In 1751, he went home to the town of Unwerde (near
Dresden, Germany), and started a lodge that conferred degrees called the
Rite of Strict Observance. While Von Hund’s version of Freemasonry with a
Templar twist only lasted 60 years before dying out, if helped to firmly plant
the Templar myth into the minds of Masons throughout Europe.
The other curious contribution of Von Hund to Masonic lore is that his Rite 
of Strict Observance was named after the oath he took in France to swear 
obedience to what he called “Unseen Superiors.” Even though his Rite had
died out by 1811, modern day conspiracy theorists claim that Masons today
still take such an oath.
The York Rite
The York Rite degrees came to North America via Scottish and Irish military
lodges in the years just before the Revolutionary War. The York Rite system
in the U.S. is a series of degrees that revolve around more stories of King
Solomon’s Temple. They include the Royal Arch degrees, the Cryptic Council
degrees (named after the “crypt” or vault under Solomon’s Temple, not 
for being obscure or creepy), and the Masonic Knight Templar Orders. The
degrees of the York Rite are progressive, meaning that they must be taken 
in order.
The Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite
The other big appendant Masonic organization is the Ancient Accepted
Scottish Rite, which is more simply known in the U.S. as just the Scottish Rite.
(No, you don’t have to be Scottish to join, and the degrees originally came
from France.) The Scottish Rite confers degrees that are numbered 4 through
32. Additionally, a 33rd degree is awarded to Scottish Rite Masons who’ve
given extraordinary service to the Rite or to their community. Because of
these higher numbers, many non-Masons are confused into thinking they’re
of higher rank.
Worldwide Distrust of Masonry
If you ask the average North American Mason about his plot to take over 
the world, the typical reply would be, “Right, just as soon as we decide what
night to hold the fish fry.” The U.S. Masonic lodges are clearly marked on the
170
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

outside. Masons themselves wear rings and lapel pins and have Masonic
bumper stickers on their cars. But in other parts of the world, Freemasonry
isn’t so public, nor are the members considered to be mostly harmless.
English society has had a longstanding mistrust of Freemasonry, and in 
the 1990s Britain held hearings over accusations of Masonic influence in the
judicial system. No evidence of any kind was ever found of institutional
favoritism among Masons who were police officers or officers of the courts.
Nevertheless, police, judges, and others in the government across the United
Kingdom today are now required to disclose their membership in the
Masons, simply because there might be something sneaky going on. No other
group is singled out in this way.
The British media today goes out of its way to point out if an accused 
criminal is a Mason, and can’t seem to resist mentioning in any article about
Freemasonry “dodgy” handshakes and the custom of initiates being required
to “roll up their trouser leg.” It seems to be part of the British journalism
handbook.
Other parts of the world have at various times treated Masons with more
than just ridicule. Here are some examples:
 Fascist or other authoritarian governments have good reason to distrust
groups that meet in secret. Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s Germany out-
lawed Freemasonry, and the Nazis sent Masons to the death camps.
 Many Islamic countries that are governed by strict Sharia law, based on
passages in the Koran, demand jail or even death for Freemasons.
 Masonry was also outlawed in the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc coun-
tries. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Freemasonry began to rebound in
the former Soviet republics, but distrust remains.
 Zealous members of the Ukrainian parliament recently recommended
jail sentences for citizens who joined Masonic lodges, with especially
harsh terms for members of the government found to be Masons.
Templars = Masons = Illuminati = Jews?
The Knights Templar, the Illuminati, and the Jews are supposedly linked 
with the Freemasons, mostly because the alleged combination of the three 
in connection with the Freemasons became the very first conspiracy theory
hatched during the modern age. And the most enduring one.
171
Chapter 9: The Freemasons: The World’s Longest-Running Secret Society

Keep in mind the upheavals going on in the world when this conspiracy was
first alleged. The American Revolution had concluded in 1783, showing the
rest of the world that it was possible to shuck off a king and create a democ-
ratic republic, where the governed decided who would govern them. But the
French Revolution in 1789 put all Europe into near total panic. The French
beheaded their king and most of his family, along with thousands of members
of the nobility and the clergy, before it even turned on its own leaders. The
French executed 40,000 people, and as many as 600,000 would die before the
revolution limped to an end. Monarchs everywhere worried that rebellion
was just around the corner in their own countries.
When the carnage in France ended, the survivors — and others outside of
France — looked for a reason for the savagery of the revolution. Three 
different writers built connections off each other that culminated in a grand
conspiracy theory that endures to this day. We’ll get to them shortly, but first
you need to see the pieces of the puzzle and how they were put together.
How the Knights Templar got involved
Early in the formation of Freemasonry, a rivalry existed over who had the
first Masonic lodges and who had the right to create, or charter, new ones.
The first group set themselves up as a Grand Lodge in London in 1717. But
earlier groups felt they had just as much right to claim governing authority
over Masonry, if not more. Much of the controversy centered in Scotland,
where lodges had existed as far back as the 1400s. Antiquity became 
something of a bragging right.
In 1737, Chevalier Ramsey’s “Oration” (see “Aspiring to more and ‘higher’
degrees” earlier in this chapter) claimed that the skills of Masonry were lost
during the days of Ancient Egypt, but had been rediscovered in the Holy Land
by crusading knights in the 1100s, and brought back to Europe. He didn’t
mention them by name, but enthusiastic Freemasons glommed on to the tale
with vigor, and believed Ramsey was talking about the legendary Knights
Templar. Enthusiastic Masons fell in love with the idea and began to create
side orders (additional Masonic degrees) based on, among other things, the
Knights Templar.
A legend appeared in Scotland that the medieval Knights Templar had fled 
to the north of the country when they were hunted down by France’s King
Phillip IV in 1307. Myths grew up that the Knights, now excommunicated 
by Phillip’s handpicked puppet pope, Clement V, hid out in Scotland and
developed the secret handshakes, passwords, and other trappings that 
eventually turned into Freemasonry.
In the late 1700s, stories suddenly appeared that the Templars had done 
all kinds of heroic deeds in Scotland — from saving King Robert the Bruce’s
bacon by riding out onto the battlefield at the Battle of Bannockburn and 
172
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

terrifying the English troops, to building the legendary Rosslyn Chapel 
near Edinburgh (seen at the end of the book and film of Dan Brown’s 
The Da Vinci Code).
Valiant as these legends seemed, and as often as they’re trotted out to this
day, these legends were probably created by Scottish Freemasons simply to
claim a more ancient pedigree than their upstart English brethren in London,
who claimed themselves to be the “premiere” and “Mother” Grand Lodge 
of the world.
To read the whole story of the Knights Templar, their myths, legends, and the
role they play in The Da Vinci Code, pick up a copy of our book, The Templar
Code For Dummies (Wiley).
Mixing in the Illuminati
For much more about the original Bavarian Illuminati, see Chapter 11. 
But for our discussion here, the second piece of the conspiratorial whammy
came when King Karl Theodor outlawed all secret societies in Bavaria in
1784, including both the Illuminati and the Freemasons. Illuminati founder
Adam Weishaupt (who really was up to no good) was forced to flee the coun-
try, chased by the king’s soldiers. He fled in such a hurry that his collection
of clearly treasonous papers was discovered and made public, pretty much
ruining his plans for a “secret” reformation and the creation of a “New World
Order,” which was the first time this famous term appeared.
Weishaupt had used his organization to infiltrate Masonic lodges as step 
one of his plan to get Illuminati members into well-placed positions of power.
His next step was really ambitious — to overthrow the kings of Europe. But
suddenly, his failed and exposed plans were splashed across the headlines
around the world.
How the Masons and Jews wound 
up controlling the world
The Knights Templar, the Freemasons, the Illuminati, and the Jews were
never connected in reality. But in the wake of the French Revolution’s 
bloodbath, the world looked for someone to blame.
Because Weishaupt’s Illuminati had planned to overthrow monarchies all
over Europe, the first suspect was this now-defunct group. Beginning in 1790,
pamphlets were circulated claiming the Illuminati had started the Terror. In
America, Illuminati paranoia set in. Freemason George Washington said that
he believed Illuminists had infiltrated the fledgling country, and non-Mason
173
Chapter 9: The Freemasons: The World’s Longest-Running Secret Society

Thomas Jefferson, who had once written with apparent admiration of the
Illuminati’s stated goals, was accused of being a member and had to defend
his own reputation over it.
Beginning in 1792, several conspiracy authors began to combine the Masons,
the Illuminati, the Templars, and the Jews in varying combinations to create 
a worldwide conspiracy of universal control. Following are the main players
in creating this story.
Cadet de Gassicourt
In 1792, French author Cadet de Gassicourt published The Tomb of Jacques
Molay, which described how the supposedly disbanded Order of the Templars
plotted for four centuries to exact their revenge against the monarchy of
France and the Catholic Church. They survived the years in hiding by 
morphing into the Freemasons.
John Robison
In 1797, a Scottish Freemason (and inventor of the first siren) named John
Robison wrote a pithy book: Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions
and Governments of Europe Carried on in the Secret Meetings of Freemasons,
Illuminati, and Reading Societies. Essentially, he claimed that the Illuminati 
had infiltrated French Freemasonry (but not English or Scottish Freemasonry),
and they had become the French Jacobin clubs where the revolution was
cooked up. Masons in Britain were virtuous, but those dirty “continentals”
were the real problem.
Abbé de Barruel
Meanwhile, a French expatriate, ex-Jesuit, abbott named Augustin de Barruel
met Robison and ran with the Scotsman’s ideas. Between 1797 and 1798, 
he published a massive four-part work called Memoirs Illustrating the History
of Jacobinism. Abbé de Barruel wove all the theories of the Templars, the
Freemasons, and the Illuminati together into one, big, fat, continuous conspir-
acy theory, along with previous secret societies, dating all the way back to
Iran’s ancient history. For the first time, the Templars, the Masons, and 
the Illuminati were all described as having some ancient, mystical knowledge
from a distant, pagan past that gave them the incredible power to sway
nations.
His multivolume work became one of the most successful publications of the
period, and de Barruel got very rich off them. There was just one last player
to add to the conspiracy: the Jews.
In 1806, de Barruel claimed to receive a letter from an Italian fan of his
Memoirs, who alleged that the secret societies had indeed plotted the French
Revolution, but they had done it at the bidding of an evil Jewish sect, who
wanted to steal the property of Christians, outlaw or otherwise destroy the
Christian faith, enslave them, and create a world government run by Jews.
174
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Because the Jews’ lot in life had actually improved during the revolution,
they were an easy mark. Abbé de Barruel discovered the devilish doings:
 The Templars had been headquartered in the Holy Land after the first
Crusade in 1119, on top of the Temple Mount, site of King Solomon’s
Temple, built in 1000 BC.
 The Freemasons built their ritual around the story of the construction 
of King Solomon’s Temple, so they had to be both Templars as well 
as Jews.
 The Illuminati were Freemasons.
 Therefore, the Templars, the Freemasons, the Illuminati, and the Jews
had all conspired to start the French Revolution.
This thinking was truly unique, because French Freemasons had primarily
been members of the nobility at that time and among the first to be executed
by the “national razor,” the guillotine.
Because the stories came from the esteemed Abbé de Barruel, people
believed without question. And because he placed the Jews in the position 
of controlling the secret societies as their willing stooges, he threw them
from being a race of people Europe never really thought much about, to the
pinnacle of the conspiracy theory pyramid, where everyone started to think
about them.
Who’s in charge? Seeking 
Masonic authorities
Anti-Masons who accuse Freemasonry of world domination contend there is
a supersecret, “high-ranking” group of Masons who really control the world,
unknown to the vast herd of unsuspecting men in their neighborhood lodges.
The truth is that Freemasonry has no international governing body. In 
the U.S., every state has its own Grand Lodge that’s sovereign within its 
jurisdictional borders. In most countries outside of the U.S. there’s just one
Grand Lodge that’s overwhelmingly recognized as the authoritative body in
each country.
There are exceptions everywhere, and different Grand Lodges that are largely
unrecognized as being legitimate Freemasonry by the larger mainstream
groups do exist, such as the Grand Orient of France, female and co-ed Grand
Lodges throughout the world, and many others. In the U.S., the most notable
exceptions are the predominantly African-American “Prince Hall Affiliated”
(PHA) Grand Lodges that co-exist by treaty (in all but a handful of former
Confederate states in the South) with their mainstream Grand Lodge 
counterparts.
175
Chapter 9: The Freemasons: The World’s Longest-Running Secret Society

What is most important to understand is that there is no such thing as world-
wide, universally recognized Freemasonry. Nor is there one, single, authorita-
tive body or person who speaks for Freemasonry. Every Grand Lodge sets 
the rules for the conduct of their members. And while a Grand Lodge, or the
equivalent of its “president,” the Grand Master, may make statements about
his beliefs, laws, or practices, his authority ends at his own state or national
borders.
When you see “high-ranking Masons” or “top Masonic authorities” being
quoted, your warning bells need to start ringing, because there are no such
things. There are Masonic authors whose opinions are respected, but they’re
usually expressing their own views, and not any official Grand Lodge 
position, unless the work so states.
Looking at Masonic plots that were real
There is a very famous incident where a group of Freemasons plotted to 
overthrow their lawful government. Several Masonic terrorists met secretly
in their lodge room and plotted destruction of property. They conspired 
to take the government into their own hands and drew up detailed plans to
place their own candidates in positions of power. Meanwhile, a wealthy
Mason began training paramilitary troops, while another conspired with 
foreign leaders to achieve military and financial backing.
We’re, of course, talking about the Founding Fathers and the American
Revolution. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Paul
Revere, the Marquis de Lafayette, and dozens of other famous figures during
the revolution were Freemasons, and there are specific Enlightenment
philosophies that were part of the Masonic rules and regulations that made
their way into the U.S. Constitution. But remember that while these famous
men were all Masons, their actions weren’t Masonic plots. The U.S. revolution
was an attempt to use Enlightenment philosophy to establish a new form of
government, just as the lodges were places where Enlightenment thought
was put into everyday practice. Still, there have been other very real Masonic
conspiracies brewing. Keep reading!
The murder of Captain William Morgan
In 1826, William Morgan and his wife arrived in the upstate New York town 
of Batavia. Unfortunately, Morgan was the sort referred to in those days as a
ne’er do well (sort of a professional bum), claiming he was a former captain
during the War of 1812. He also claimed he was a Mason, and on his arrival in
Batavia, he attempted to join the local Masonic lodge and put the touch on its
members, but was rejected. He had a similar experience when he attempted
to join a local York Rite chapter.
176
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

So, Morgan decided to get even with the Masons. He made friends with 
the local printer, who had also been ejected from the local lodge, and they
formed a plan to publish a blockbuster — a book that would expose the
secret ceremonies of the Freemasons. Unfortunately for Morgan, one of the
hallmarks of his character was a very big mouth, and as a result, members 
of the local lodge found out about his plans in no time flat. After attempting,
to no avail, to “convince” him to drop his book plans, they decided to take
matters into their own hands. They allegedly abducted Morgan, and hauled
him off to Fort Niagara on Lake Ontario, along the Canadian border. And he
was never seen again.
In court, the conspirators claimed they paid Morgan $500, put him on a
horse, pointed him north to Canada, and told him never to come back again.
Morgan’s wife Lucinda had a different view of the matter and suggested that
the Masons had drowned him in the lake. Twenty-six men were indicted in
connection with his disappearance, but only six were ever tried, and none 
on murder charges. The prosecutor and many of the jurors were Freemasons
themselves, and the trial resulted in very lenient sentences.
An explosion of protest quickly spread across New York, then the country.
The public believed that the Masons had killed Morgan “according to
Masonic ritual,” then cheated justice by receiving short sentences from their
Masonic friends who controlled the courts and the government, including
Governor and Freemason Dewitt Clinton. What began as a small-town 
crime became a nationwide outrage, and it certainly sold a lot of books and
newspapers. Morgan’s book, Illustrations of Masonry, was published after 
his death, and it was an instant bestseller. Over the next five years, the 
anti-Masonic movement grew steadily and went national.
As a direct result of the “Morgan Affair,” in 1831 the anti-Masonic Party
became the first official third-party political movement in America, running
“resigned and reformed” Freemason William Wirt for president (who inexplic-
ably gave a speech defending the fraternity at his own nominating conven-
tion). The party was strong enough to carry the state of Vermont, and won 8
percent of the national vote. Anti-Masonic governors were elected in
Pennsylvania and Vermont, along with several U.S. Congressmen.
The Anti-Masonic Party lost its momentum quickly, as most one-issue move-
ments generally do. But over the next 20 years, Masonic lodges closed all
over the country as men renounced their membership. Nationwide, Masonic
membership dropped from 100,000 in 1827 to less than 40,000 ten years later.
Masonic membership wouldn’t begin to grow again until the 1850s.
Mormons and Masons: Who had the rituals first?
Controversy has raged in both the Mormon Church (Church of Latter Day
Saints, or LDS) and Freemasonry concerning the origins of Mormon rituals
and ceremonies. Church founders Joseph and Hyrum Smith were both
Masons, as was Brigham Young, their successor. Believers in the LDS say that
177
Chapter 9: The Freemasons: The World’s Longest-Running Secret Society

Prophet Joseph Smith’s revelation of Mormon ceremonies derived from the
story of Solomon’s Temple, and it’s merely a coincidence that the church and
Freemasonry teach lessons with similar themes and phrases. More skeptical
nonbelievers think that Smith simply stole the ceremonies of the Masonic
lodge, and counted on the secrecy of both organizations to hide his 
plagiarism.
Despite her belief that her husband had been murdered by Freemasons 
(see section above), William Morgan’s widow Lucinda went on to marry
another Freemason, George Harris, and they became Mormons and moved 
to Indiana. At some point, while still married to Harris, Lucinda entered 
into a polygamous marriage with Joseph Smith as the Mormons passed
through Indiana on their way to Illinois.
In 1842, Smith received the degrees of Freemasonry, and yet somehow knew
the details of the rituals before receiving them. Mormons believe he was
divinely inspired. Skeptics point out that his wife Lucinda was the widow of a
man who had written the most notorious exposé of Masonic ritual in America,
William Morgan’s Illustrations of Masonry. Shortly after Smith’s initiation as a
Mason he began to instruct his church leaders “in the principles of and order
of the Priesthood” that bore remarkable similarity to Masonic rituals.
In 1844, Joseph Smith was killed in Nauvoo, Illinois, at the hands of an anti-
Mormon mob. Wild claims circulated that just as he was shot, he cried out
the first words of the Masonic “Grand Hailing Sign of Distress,” some say in
the hope that a brother Mason might save him.
Popular (And Untrue) Masonic
Conspiracy Theories
Hundreds of conspiracies have been attributed to the Freemasons over the
years, and the list of conspiracy theories associated with the Freemasons
grows every year. In this section, we first list a few for you to chew on, then in
later sections we move on to the really popular ones, which we cover in more
detail. Here are some conspiracies:
 Jack the Ripper was a Freemason. First propounded by Stephen Knight
in his book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution and popularized by the
films Murder By Decree (1978) and From Hell (2001). Knight alleged 
that the Ripper was Freemason William Gull, court physician to Queen
Victoria, and that he killed prostitutes on orders from the Crown to 
prevent the discovery of an illegal marriage and an illegitimate daughter
of Prince Albert Edward. Knight further alleged that the killings were
done according to “Masonic ritual,” acting out the bloody oaths taken by
Masons in their three lodge degrees.
178
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Knight’s theory is intriguing, but flawed on too many details of Masonic
ritual that he simply invented to suit his story. A key piece of evidence
erased by the Metropolitan Police was graffiti that said, “The Juwes 
are not the men who will be blamed for nothing.” Knight claimed this 
reference wasn’t to Jews, but to the three fellow craft who attack Hiram
Abiff in Masonic ritual: Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum. Unfortunately, the
characters have never been referred to as Juwes and don’t even appear
by name in English Masonic ritual! Knight’s source for the tale, Joseph
Sickert, later confessed that it was all a “whopping fib.”
 Most U.S. Presidents, including both George Bushes, were Freemasons.
Not by a long shot. Neither George Bush is a Mason. There have been 
14 U.S. Presidents who were Masons: George Washington, James
Monroe, Andrew Jackson, James Knox Polk, James Buchanan, Andrew
Johnson, James Garfield, William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, William
Howard Taft, Warren G. Harding, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman,
and Gerald R. Ford.
 Skull and Bones is a Masonic group. Skull and Bones is a Yale
University fraternity that’s a little creepy, but it isn’t a Masonic group.
(See Chapter 13 for more about the Bonesmen.)
 The Ku Klux Klan was created by the Freemasons. Nope, wrong again.
Many Klansmen during its many incarnations may have also belonged 
to the Masons. But there were also Baptists and Methodists, Lions and
Rotarians, NRA and Sierra Club members, as well as subscribers to the
Hair Club for Men (except skinheads). The Klan rituals borrowed heavily
from the structure of the Masonic lodge in arrangement, officers, and
language, but so have a thousand other groups, including college 
fraternities, ever since the early 1700s.
 Masons worship a Masonic God referred to as the Great Architect of
the Universe, which is actually called Jahbulon, which is made up 
of the words Jehovah, Baal, and Osiris. Freemasons don’t conduct reli-
gious worship in their lodges. Their meetings and degrees are opened
and closed with prayers, and no one may join a lodge who doesn’t have
a belief in a supreme being. But the term Grand Architect of the Universe
(abbreviated in their ritual books as GAOTU) is used as a generic, all-
inclusive term to encompass the faith of all members. The word
Jahbulon only appears in one degree of the appendant group, the York
Rite, and Masons don’t “worship” it. Nor is it explained as being com-
prised of Jehovah, Baal, and Osiris.
 The Masons are a front for their real masters, the Jews. Freemasonry
uses some Old Testament biblical stories and imagery in its degree 
ceremonies. Masonry was the first social group that openly and freely
accepted Jewish members in both England and America. But the major
source of this claim stems from the notorious anti-Semitic propaganda
document, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which we discuss in
Chapter 6.
179
Chapter 9: The Freemasons: The World’s Longest-Running Secret Society

 The Masons are a front for their real masters, the Illuminati. For the
lowdown on the Illuminati, real and imagined, see Chapter 11.
 The Masons are a front for their real masters, a race of shape-shifting
reptilian aliens. British conspiracist David Icke believes this rumor 
is absolutely true. And let’s just say we don’t and leave it at that.
The satanic map of Washington, D.C.
In 1789, America’s new president, Freemason George Washington, hired
Pierre Charles L’Enfant to design the new Federal City, the nation’s capitol
that would eventually bear Washington’s name. The area that the city rose
from was an almost complete wilderness, giving L’Enfant a bare slate to draw
his designs upon.
But according to some conspiracists, the designers of the city were all
Freemasons, and they purposely designed secret symbols into the map,
making it appear satanic. Here are some of the purported Masonic/satanic
symbols:
 Directly north of the White House is an inverted pentagram (Satan’s
symbol) made by the intersections of Massachusetts Avenue, Rhode
Island Avenue, Connecticut Avenue, Vermont Avenue, and K Street 
NW — almost. (The Rhode Island Avenue leg isn’t finished, but that’s 
a pesky detail when Satan is involved.) The allegations say that the
Masons put a Satanic symbol over the White House to show their 
power. But the inverted pentagram was never considered remotely 
“evil” until the 1870s, or “Satanic” until the 1970s.
And as Masonic author S. Brent Morris has pointed out, if the Masons
were all-powerful, why didn’t they build that last leg of Rhode Island
Avenue and complete their Unholy Talisman of the Damned?
 If you turn the map of Washington sideways, you see a Masonic square
and compasses directly west of the U.S. Capitol building. With a stretch,
you might make the claim that it sort of looks like a compass. But the 
so-called “square” up by Capitol Hill isn’t a perfect square, is cut off on
one side, is in the wrong position, and wasn’t a street at all but a 
decorative canal that was never built.
Of all the men who had anything to do with the original design of Washington,
D.C. (George Washington, Charles L’Enfant, Andrew Ellicott, Benjamin
Banneker, along with some meddling from Thomas Jefferson), only
Washington was a Freemason, and his biggest concern was the placement of
the Presidential Mansion on a hill of at least equal height with the Capitol.
180

The Masonic dollar bill
This theory presupposes that the Freemasons designed the Great Seal of the
United States that appears on the U.S. dollar bill. They didn’t. The seal was
designed by three committees between 1776 and 1782, and the only Mason
among all the men involved was Benjamin Franklin. And all his ideas for the
seal were rejected.
The symbol on the dollar most commonly associated with the Masons is the
unfinished pyramid and the All-Seeing Eye. But this combined image doesn’t
appear anywhere in the symbolism of Freemasonry. The All-Seeing Eye within
a triangle, alone, does appear in some Masonic symbolism as a symbol for
God, but it predates modern Freemasonry by several hundred years. The 
All-Seeing Eye is a common symbol in Renaissance Christian art as a repre-
sentation of the Holy Trinity (symbolized by the three sides of the triangle,
with the eye of God in the center). The unfinished pyramid was probably an
invention of Charles Thompson, who wasn’t a Mason.
Some conspiracy theorists have claimed the symbol is that of the Illuminati
(see Chapter 11) and that the appearance of the date 1776 on the seal is 
commemorating the formation of that group in Bavaria. True, one symbol 
of the Illuminati was an “All-Seeing Eye.” But it was represented by a circle
with a darkened dot in the center, not a pyramid shape. And why they don’t
believe that 1776 is the date of the Declaration of Independence escapes us.

Chapter 9: The Freemasons: The World’s Longest-Running Secret Society

There is a parlor trick that supposedly proves the Masons are involved
anyway:
1. Get out a dollar bill.
2. Connect the tip of the All-Seeing Eye to the “N” in Novus, and the “M”
in Seclorum, then back to the Eye.
3. Connect the second “O” on Ordo with the “A” in Annuit and the “S”
in Coeptis, then back to the “O.”
This process not only spells MASON, but also forms a Star of David.
Supposedly this “proves” the Jews and the Masons are somehow in
cahoots. Of course, you can also make more than 120 different anagrams
out of the mottoes Annuit Coeptis and Novus Seclorum, including 
uncircumcised, Micronesian, accordionists, sopranos, despots, and most
importantly, misconception.
Scottish Rite 32nd degree rings
There’s a hot Internet rumor making the rounds that pawn shops have an
inordinate number of Scottish Rite 32nd degree rings for sale. The theory
goes that the 32nd degree ceremony includes spells of witchcraft. And the
reason pawnshops have so many of them is because inept 32nd degree
Masons don’t get the spell incantations right and are vaporized in the fiery
aftermath of their Luciferian magic gone bad. *Poof!*

n the late Douglas Adams’s book, The Hitchiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, a
group of scientists build the Universe’s greatest computer, Deep Thought,
with one purpose in mind — to ask it the Answer to the Ultimate Question
About Life, the Universe, and Everything. The machine thinks a long time —
7.5 million years — and finally dispenses the answer that Mankind has
wanted to know ever since we crawled out of the slime: “42.”
I checked it very thoroughly,” said the computer, “and that quite definitely is
the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you’ve
never actually known what the question is.
Esoteric and occult studies are a lot like that. Esotericism is the study of
“hidden knowledge,” mysterious beliefs, or inner enlightenment that can only
be understood after years of introspection and study. Like Deep Thought, 
the problem with esoteric studies is that more than half of the challenge in
seeking the Answer to the Ultimate Question about Life, the Universe, and
Everything is first figuring out the proper question to ask. Otherwise, you
wind up with an answer like 42.
Answering the Ultimate Question About Life, the Universe, and Everything is
what esoteric and occult societies try to do, and that’s what we discuss in
this chapter.
Rosicrucianism introduced the modern notion of the occult secret society.
The Rosicrucians were inspired principally by the great movements within
Christian mysticism. Many of these movements, from Gnosticism to
Manichaeism, along with a whole cartload of other isms, have a history

stretching back to the first two centuries of the Christian faith. Rosicrucians
built for themselves a highly colorful mythology and ritual in the 1700s, then
slowly passed from the scene. But, like many other secret societies, they just
kept coming back again, particularly in the spiritualism-drenched 19th and
20th centuries.
This chapter goes back to the beginning, explaining the birth of
Rosicrucianism, the occult ties between the Rosicrucians and many other
esoteric groups, and the influence of Rosicrucianism on dozens of other
occult secret societies that came after it. Along the way, you meet a cast of
characters that eventually leads to the occult rituals and ceremonies, and 
the applications of the trappings of secret societies, in the creation of Nazi
Germany’s symbol-soaked Thousand Year Reich.
Before Rosicrucianism: Hermeticism
versus the Enlightenment
The Enlightenment occurred in the period roughly from the end of the
English Revolution in the late 1640s up until Napoleon came along after the
French Revolution with a sword in one hand and a mop in the other to clean
the place up.
What the Enlightenment was really about was the replacement of superstition,
magic, and the occult with reason, experimentation, and the scientific method.
The philosophers and scientists of the Enlightenment wanted to know why
things happened, how things worked, and how humans could interact with
them. And they tried to apply this methodology to religion, politics, science,
sociology, and everything else. For the Enlightenment thinkers, all the answers
to Life, the Universe, and Everything were waiting to be discovered, explained,
subjected to the scientific method, and logically catalogued.
Let’s just say the Enlightenment thinkers weren’t universally hailed as
geniuses and heroes. Another category of folks regarded the Enlightenment
as flawed, fallacious folly for a different reason. These were believers in the
occult, and they had a much different view. They felt that ancient civiliza-
tions, Eastern adepts, mystics, wizards, magicians, alchemists, and other
practitioners had already discovered the mystical answers to Life, the
Universe, and Everything long ago. But they believed this sacred knowledge
had been lost to the West — either out of stupidity, blindness, lousy record
keeping, or by being branded as heresy and rubbed out by the church.
These folks knew that the knowledge was “out there,” and it was simply 
waiting to be rediscovered by just the right people. Not the great unwashed
rabble, but a very select, special, and sometimes secret society of people.
That’s where Hermeticism comes in.
184
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

The origin of the term Hermeticism is a set of religious and philosophical 
writings attributed to a legendary ancient Egyptian figure known as Hermes
Trismegistus (meaning “thrice great”). He’s sometimes also referred to as the
Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek god Hermes, and his writings were said to
be extensive. Depending on whose lavish telling of his accomplishments you
read, he wrote somewhere between 40 and 40,000 books (even more than
Stephen King and Nora Roberts combined) on a huge range of subjects, 
from Egyptian science — astronomy, math, geometry, and alchemy — to a 
far-reaching exploration of spirituality, philosophy, and magic.
According to legend, Hermes’s writings, known as Hermetica, turn up every-
where throughout Greek, Roman, early Christian. and even early Islamic peri-
ods, and they obviously influenced the beginnings of these many religions. But
the bulk of his writings disappeared with the burning of the Alexandrian
Library in 48 BC, and as a result, the scarcity of surviving Hermetic texts just
made them more legendary, and the fewer there were for people to actually
study, the more mythical and magical the “lost” volumes became.
The problem is that none of this is true. In the 1400s, manuscripts of Hermes’s
works began to appear across Europe after Gutenberg’s printing press began
to make books easier and cheaper to mass-produce. Printers needed things to
print, and any works purporting to be by Hermes Trismegistus were snapped
up as quickly as the ink dried.
There’s zero evidence of any of Hermes’s writings before the 1400s. The
books attributed to him are undoubtedly forgeries or copies of earlier works,
with his name slapped on them. But little things like forgeries never kept a
good esoteric or occult secret society out of business for very long. At times,
it almost seems to be a prerequisite. The Rosicrucians, or the Order of the
Rose Cross, was the first organized group to endeavor to wrap what would
become a modern secret society around Hermetic works. Naturally, its 
adherents have claimed it is the oldest secret society in the world, dating
back to Ancient Egypt, just like Hermes Trismegistus.
The Rosicrucians
In their most utopian form, the Rosicrucians are essentially Christian in
beliefs but influenced by Hermeticism, philosophies that predate Christianity
by more than a thousand years, and Eastern mysticism. We cover the 
evolution of Rosicrucianism in the next few sections, starting with Christian
Rosenkreutz.
Rosicrucianism has long been associated with a symbol of a cross with a rose
in the center. Depending on which source you want to believe, this symbol
means different things:
185
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

 The rose is a symbol of “budding” spiritual growth or Christ or secrecy.
(This is based on the Roman phrase of sub-rosa, when secret societies
met under a hanging rose. The idea originated in the Greek legend 
of Aphrodite passing a rose to her son Eros, who in turn gave it to
Harpocrates, the God of silence, to hide his mother’s indiscretions.)
 The cross is a symbol of both life and death; of the quartering of the
Universe into the four alchemical elements of earth, air, fire, and water;
or simply the cross on which Christ was put to death. To alchemists,
mystics, and spiritualists, it’s a symbol of the secret of immortality. And
to prurient pervs who see Freudian symbols everywhere, the rose/cross
is a combined symbol of female and male genitalia.
The tale of Christian Rosenkreutz
The Rosicrucian legend primarily comes from published accounts in Germany
about the group’s presumed founder, Christian Rosenkreutz. He was suppos-
edly born in Germany in 1378 and was raised in a monastery. As a monk, his
travels led him to the mysterious lands of the East in search of spiritual and
mystical knowledge, where he studied under masters of the occult arts.
When Rosenkreutz came back to Germany in 1407, he met up with three
other monks, with the purpose of amassing the great mystical and scientific
knowledge of all time. Over the years, the order increased in size to eight
members, who were to travel the world and come back every year to their
headquarters, the Sancti Spiritus, to share the knowledge with the other 
members. Their ultimate goal was to assemble the combined knowledge of
the world and to unify it into one universal message in preparation of the
Final Judgment of God.
Christian Rosenkreutz died in 1484 (supposedly at the age of 106) and was
buried in the Sancti Spiritus, where his body’s whereabouts were forgotten by
the Order. Then, in 1604 during a bit of remodeling, someone was pounding a
nail in a wall of the building and whacked a hole in the plaster, revealing the
perfectly preserved body of Rosenkreutz, along with all the secret knowledge
that had been buried with him. That’s the legend, anyway.
Johann Valentin Andrae
Between 1614 and 1616, three pamphlets appeared that had been supposedly
written by Christian Rosenkreutz in the mid-1400s and freshly “rediscovered.”
These writings were Fama Fraternitatis, the Confessio, and the Chemical
Marriage of Christian Rosenkreutz. The truth was that most of the legend
186
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

sprang from the fertile imagination of Johann Valentin Andrae, a Lutheran
minister, and was largely a well-intentioned hoax based on his utopian 
wishful thinking.
Andrae and a small circle of friends set out to invent an organization that
would reform social life, through new learning and a new search for the
secrets to Life, the Universe, and Everything. The Order’s primary precepts
were religious piety, charity, anonymity, and secrecy. They were out to
improve mankind without society’s awareness of this silent, benevolent, and
secret group, and their efforts led to the creation of Rosicrucian societies.
The birth of Rosicrucian societies
The emergence of the Rosicrucians has been characterized as a great 
publicity stunt. Andrae’s writings outlined a worldwide organization of 
practitioners of occult arts, who had supposedly existed and grown in hiding
for centuries. Here was the first truly secret society that claimed to be work-
ing to change the world from behind the scenes. They possessed strange,
hidden, long-lost knowledge from ancient times, and they initiated their new
recruits using mysterious rituals. The world quickly divided between those
who completely distrusted this unseen group of manipulators and those who
couldn’t wait to join up.
The problem was that, at first, there wasn’t really anything to join. The
Rosicrucian stories began to circulate throughout Europe, and Rosicrucian
societies began to pop up all over, most popularly in Germany and Holland
starting in 1620. Even when Andrae confessed to having invented the whole
thing, true believers simply refused to believe him. The Enlightenment 
was a fertile era of looking for scientific answers to religious questions, and
Rosicrucianism was perfect for the period because it straddled the line
between superstition and science. It combined science, religion, and the
occult — alchemy, magic, Egyptian mysticism, Jewish Kabbalism, as well as
Christian teachings — with a special emphasis on reincarnation.
The first Rosicrucians came to America when William Penn invited Johann
Jacob Zimmerman’s Chapter of Perfection to move from Germany and settle in
Pennsylvania. Zimmerman’s group believed that Christ would return to earth
in 1700, and in 1694, they built an observatory in their settlement to predict
the precise moment of Christ’s Second Coming. Unfortunately for Jacob and
his predictions, their calculations were off. No Second Coming was forthcom-
ing, the group quickly disbanded, and several ex-members became known as
a wandering group of hermits.
187
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

Modern Rosicrucianism
As scientific experimentation and discovery improved, and as science and
the occult diverged from one another, the allure of Rosicrucianism died out,
and by the mid-1700s, France was just about the only place Rosicrucians

Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 
A brief glance at Kabbalah
If you do any looking into esoteric organizations,
you stumble into references to the Kabbalah (or
Cabala, Kabala, Qabalah, or Cabbalah — all
spellings are used). It was central to Rosicrucian
lore.
Kabbalah is an extraordinarily complex and mys-
tical Jewish course of biblical study. The word
Kabbalah is variously translated as “received” or
“tradition,” meaning the oral tradition of mystical
steps received by initiates from the learned
Kabbalah adepts. For centuries, it was passed
down from mouth to ear by scholars, and a stu-
dent had to be over 40 to be considered worthy
enough to even hear about it. Rabbi Bahya ben
Asher, a 13th-century Jew living in Spain, is cred-
ited with the first written examination of
Kabbalah, although the tradition of Jewish mys-
ticism stretches back much farther, at least to the
6th century before Christ. Over the next 300
years, his writings would cause great excitement
concerning the study of secret messages in the
Bible — so much so that there would be both
Christian and Islamic variations.
The essential purpose of Kabbalah is to seek the
hidden faces of God, and by doing so, to under-
stand the origins and operations of the universe.
Kabbalah’s central image is the Tree of Life,
which has ten branches emanating from the
sephiroth, the ten sacred Hebrew numbers, with
the whole tree representing a progressive path
to enlightenment and knowledge of God. It is
usually depicted as a series of ten spheres con-
nected by 22 paths, which are represented by
the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The ten
spheres describe the ten attributes by which God
can interact with Man and the Universe.
You can’t really comprehend Kabbalah without
an understanding of the Hebrew language. The
belief is that, as God dictated the books of the
Torah (specifically, the first five books of what
Christians call the Old Testament), he did it in a
certain code. For a Kabbalist, the Hebrew lan-
guage itself is holy. In Hebrew, every letter has a
numerical equivalent, and Kabbalists believed
that hidden truths and prophecies in the Torah
could be discovered by the endless and intricate
reweaving of the letters in the holy books, result-
ing in everything from simple anagrams to com-
plex geometric computations (an anagram is a
word or phrase formed out of the re-arranged
letters of another word or phrase). The numerol-
ogy aspect of Kabbalah is called “Gematra.” But
the central belief of Kabbalah is that all the
secrets to Life, the Universe, and Everything are
in the Torah, if only we can break the code.
If this sounds a lot like the modern book, The
Bible Code by Michael Drosnin, you’d be right.
Drosnin claims that the Torah is written in what is
called a “skip-code” — that every fifth letter in
every sentence forms a word. Although he suc-
cessfully used it to predict the assassination of
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, it
seems to have faltered on predictions of meteor
strikes and nuclear Armageddon in 2005.
Modern pop spiritualist movements involv-
ing Kabbalah, and high-profile followers like
Madonna, have sprung up in recent years, which
is where you will usually find the different
spellings with a Q or a C. For much more about
Kabbalah, see Kabbalah For Dummies (Wiley) by
Arthur Kurzweil.

could be found. A French occultist named Eliphas Levi resurrected interest in
Rosicrucianism when he wrote a series of books about “transcendental
magic” in the mid-1800s.
The largest and best-known modern Rosicrucian group today is the Ancient
and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), organized by Harvey Spencer
Lewis in 1915. Lewis claimed that King Solomon used Rosicrucian teachings
to build his temple, and that’s where Freemasonry came from. He claimed
that the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaton, Plato, Socrates, and Jesus were all
early Rosicrucians.
Lewis had been an early member of Aleister Crowley’s OTO (see the section
“The Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO)” later in this chapter) and incorporated
some of what he’d experienced there into the AMORC. He was also an 
inventor, and he developed several peculiar items for use in the AMORC’s
search for knowledge:
 The Luxatone (a large, triangular screen with flashing lights known in
the groovy 1970s as a color organ)
 The Sympathetic Vibration Harp
 The Cosmic Ray Coincidence Counter (that some have claimed to be 
the precursor of the Geiger Counter)
 The Black Mirror (used to focus thoughts during meditation)
In a famous incident, Lewis “proved” that he could transmute base metals
into gold, a secret sought for in vain for centuries by alchemists. But when
the experiment was concluded, he proclaimed that the process just wasn’t
cost effective, and it made much more sense to just go buy the real thing.
In the 1930s, Lewis and the Order built an impressive art deco/Egyptian 
complex in San Jose, California, that included a planetarium, a library, and
what has become a famous Egyptian museum.
Rosicrucianism and “Fringe
Freemasonry”
Because of the wild popularity of spiritualism and the occult in the 
mid- and late-1800s, a small group of British Masons became interested in
Rosicrucianism. Many of the men involved in reviving interest in the
Rosicrucians joined the Freemasons (see Chapter 9) in search of this secret
knowledge. When they didn’t find secrets of alchemy, levitation, reincarna-
tion, astral projection, and other such legendary stuff in the Masonic lodge,
most of them moved on. Others, however, created their own “side orders,”
groups that required Masonic membership as a prerequisite but were 
not otherwise related to the Masons.
189
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

Many of these Freemasons, like W. R. Woodmen, Wynn Westcott, Kenneth
Mackenzie, S. L. MacGregor Mathers, and W. E. Waite, would eventually be led
by their interests to form Rosicrucian groups outside of Masonry, such as the
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
There never was and never has been a strong interest in Rosicrucians or the
occult by Masonry as an institution, and these same few men represent a tiny
radical group that eventually worked outside of regular, recognized
Freemasonry. However, two of the Masonic-related Rosicrucian groups are
worth mentioning, largely because they still exist today. These groups are
covered in the next two sections.
Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA)
An English Freemason named Robert Wentworth Little was employed as a
clerk by the library at London’s Freemason Hall, and in 1865, he claimed to
have discovered a cache of Rosicrucian documents there. In 1867, he 
founded the Rosicrucian Society of England. The name was later Latinized
into Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA). A Scottish group (Societas
Rosicruciana in Scotia) appeared about the same time.
The group confers a series of degrees (or grades) that are based on the 
structure of the Kabbalah’s “tree of life,” but they’re essentially a research
group with a very limited membership that’s extended by invitation only.
Local chapters are called colleges. They aren’t technically a Masonic group,
only a group made up of men who are Freemasons.
Societas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus
Foederatis (SRICF)
Originally founded in 1880 as the Societas Rosicruciana Republicae Americae,
the Societas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus Foederatis (SRICF) is a very small
group made up of 31 colleges in the U.S. and Canada. The SRICF began with a
group of Masons who traveled to England in 1878 and were initiated into 
the SRIA (see the preceding section) at the college at York. They applied for
permission to begin an American branch, but the English group refused. The
branch in Scotland wasn’t nearly so uppity, and they chartered a college in
Philadelphia in 1879 and New York in 1880. These two colleges established a
High Council in April 1880 and created their own autonomous American orga-
nization. Membership is by invitation only. Members must be Freemasons
and Christians, and there may be no more than 72 members in a college. It’s
essentially an honorary research society.
190
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Martinism
A French movement in the late 1700s, called Martinism, borrowed trappings
of Rosicrucianism and became a transition between the earlier order 
and esoteric and occult societies that grew up throughout the 19th century.
Martinism combined Christianity with mysticism, and saw Christ as a
redeemer who would return man to the state of grace that had not existed
since the garden of Eden.
Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin was a poor French nobleman who was born 
in 1743. As a young believer in mysticism, he traveled throughout Europe,
making many converts. He was briefly imprisoned during the French
Revolution, but survived because local authorities were in desperate need 
of schoolteachers. Louis-Claude was only too happy to oblige and become
one. Over the years, he became a student of an 18th-century Kabbalist 
named Joachim Martinez Pasquales, and later translated several obscure
17th-century works by a German mystic, Jacob Böhme, into French. Böhme,
known as “The Teutonic Philosopher,” had theorized that in order to achieve
a state of grace, man had to fall away from God and do battle with the
demons and evil angels who caused the sins of the world. Only after spiritual
victory over these evils could man again return to God’s good graces.
Using both authors as his inspiration, Saint-Martin developed his own philos-
ophy about Life, the Universe, and Everything, called the “Way of the Heart.”
Saint-Martin’s writings were signed by the enigmatic name of the Unknown
Philosopher, and they quickly became popular. Study groups began to pop
up, called the Society of the Unknown Philosopher.
One of Saint-Martin’s biggest objections to the occult, esoteric, and fraternal
societies of Europe at the time was their refusal to allow women as members,
and his was one of the first to grant women equal membership status. 
Saint-Martin died in 1803.
Martinism revived
Saint-Martin’s writings slipped into obscurity after his death, but an enthusi-
astic student rediscovered them and changed all that. Gerard Encausse 
(who went by the name of Papus) resurrected Saint-Martin’s concepts.
Followers called themselves Martinists. Not surprisingly, there was much
crossover between the usual suspects involved in esotericism: Rosicrucians,
Freemasons, Gnostics, and these new Martinists. In 1888, Encausse formed a
mystery school called the Ordere Martinist, and by 1900, there were chapters
in a dozen countries with hundreds of members.
191
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

Synarchy hijacks Martinism
World War I killed off the principal leaders of the Ordere Martinist, and the
central organization dissolved. At one point a splinter group attempted to
restore the monarchy to France. Others became enamored with a curious
movement called Synarchy, an attempt to rule European countries by means
of secret societies.
World War II all but destroyed Martinist societies in Europe because the Nazis
imprisoned or executed most members of so-called “secret societies.” But the
Traditional Martinist Order made its way to the U.S. through Rosicrucian
groups in the 1930s, and it survives today.
The Internet has done much to spread Saint-Martin’s philosophies, and new
groups have appeared recently along with the traditional ones. They cover 
a broad range of philosophies and disciplines, with some incorporating
Rosicrucian influences, some borrowing from the Memphis-Mizraim branch
of Freemasonry that’s been deemed irregular by the majority of the main-
stream Masonic world, and some simply adhering strictly to Saint-Martin’s
philosophies.
The 19th Century and Occult Societies
During the Romantic period of the 1800s, society looked back to an earlier
age with foggy nostalgia for a simpler time. The Industrial Revolution turned
landscapes and cities into a smoke-filled illustration of Dante’s Inferno.
Families were wrenched apart by economic hardship and massive migrations
from the rural farms into the factories and slums of the cities.
Scientific discoveries were blasting away at long-held religious beliefs —
Darwin’s theory of evolution being the most controversial. Additionally, 
the period had great upheaval for organized religions. Even the largest, most
stable denominations were splintering into smaller offshoots, driven by
schisms and disagreements over the minutest differences. In the wake of this
uncertainty came a new period of charismatic, unaffiliated preachers starting
their own independent churches with their own tiny followings. It seemed
like everything about society, right down to personal faith, was up for grabs.
Across the U.S. and Europe, almost as a reaction to this wave of uncertainty,
an obsession developed for mystical Eastern tales, obscure civilizations, and
religions, witchcraft, spiritualism, séances, psychic phenomenon, and almost
any variation on occultism that could be dreamed up.
192
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn
In 1887, a Freemason named A. F. A. Woodford found an “ancient” ciphered
manuscript dealing with Kabbalah and tarot in a London bookshop. A note
was attached directing anyone who deciphered the manuscript to contact a
certain Fraulein Ann Sprengel in Nuremburg, Germany. Woodford supposedly
did so, along with fellow occult-minded Masons S. L. MacGregor Mathers and
William Wynn Westcott, and they received permission from their mysterious
German contact (known in the Order as Soror Sapiens Dominabitur Astristo) 
to start a Rosicrucian society in England. This group formed the original
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.
A temple was started in London, called Isis Urania, and attracted occultist
Arthur Edward Waite (who popularized Tarot cards in the 20th century), poet
William Butler Yeats, authors H. Rider Haggard and Bram Stoker, playwright
August Strindberg, artist Edward Munch (painter of the famous “The
Scream”), writer Aliester Crowley, and many other famous personalities of
the period. Crowley would later leave the organization and start a legal war
by publishing the rituals of the Golden Dawn in his magazine.
A second, “inner order” also existed, called the Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae
Crucis, and from the name, it’s clear that it derived at least part of its inspira-
tion from Rosicrucian philosophy. This shouldn’t be much of a surprise
because almost all the founding members of the Isis Urania Temple were also
founders of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (see “Rosicrucianism and
‘Fringe Freemasonry’” earlier in this chapter).
This activity seems to have been driven by the belief of a small clot of men
who felt that Freemasonry wasn’t secret enough or occult enough, and that
the fraternity had somehow forgotten its roots in Rosicrucianism. Most
Masonic scholars and researchers challenged the theoretical Rosicrucian
origin of Masonry then, and still do today.
The movers and shakers of the major occult movements all seemed to know
each other in the later years of the 1800s and into the early 1900s. Sooner 
or later, fights would break out and one group would accuse the other of not
doing rituals properly or of making too many innovations in an “ancient”
practice that was made up the previous year, and away they’d stomp in a 
huff to go start a new group. This is what we like to describe as the “ten guys
chanting in their socks in the living room” syndrome. This is why it’s so
important to keep these circumstances in mind when reading “definitive”
books from “high-ranking” sources in these organizations. They seemed to 
be in a constant state of tantrum, and running off to start a new group.
193
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

Golden Dawn splintered into various factions (the Independent & Rectified
Rite of the Golden Dawn and the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross, to name two)
when it was revealed in 1914 that the manuscript the Order was based on
was a hoax, and the fictitious Fraulein Sprengel was nowhere to be found.
There remain at least a half dozen modern groups all claiming to be authentic
descendants of the original Order today. Not surprisingly, there have been
lawsuits and allegations of trademark violations, which seem to be the fate 
of so many esoteric organizations the world over.
The influence of Spiritualism
Between about 1840 and 1920, a curious religious mania swept the U.S. and
Britain. This mania was called Spiritualism, which was a period of time when
religious groups like the Seventh Day Adventists and the Mormons arose,
espousing the belief that mortal, earthbound humans could directly commu-
nicate with God, angels, and the dead. This time coincided with the new 
technique of Mesmerism (hypnotism), first made use of by Vienna’s Franz
Mesmer in his practice of healing through “animal magnetism.”

The traveling Spiritualism circus
When Spiritualism was most influential, traveling
performers created very popular theatrical
shows of hypnotizing subjects and performing
séances to call forth dead spirits. The perfor-
mances contained all the familiar trappings we
know today: floating furniture, crystal balls, com-
municating by rapping on tables, and of course,
the hypnotic trance of the medium who “chan-
neled” the voices of the dead. What first started
out in private homes eventually grew into regional
and national theater tours, conventions, and even
massive summer camps for true believers.
In the early days of the growing Spiritualist
movement, women were especially attracted to
it. Traditionally, men dominated lecture halls and
theater stages, but women “trance lecturers”
became quite popular. Not surprisingly, the “spir-
its” called forth in their performances frequently
vocalized support for women’s rights and 
the abolition of slavery. And it was especially
effective on audiences when a small, frail, frilly
female suddenly spoke in the deep, booming
voice of a long-lost loved one. Naturally, wide-
spread accusations of fraud spread over the
years, but it never seemed to keep audiences
away.
There were many vocal skeptics of Spiritualism,
and more than a few investigative groups arose
to root out the blatant frauds. The magician and
escape artist Harry Houdini was especially pas-
sionate about exposing Spiritualist charlatans
after the death of his mother brought many out of
the woodwork offering to help him communicate
with her on the “other side.” Others weren’t so
skeptical. One of the most fervent believers in
Spiritualism was the creator of literature’s most
scientific, pragmatic, and dispassionate practi-
tioners of logic ever to grace the pages of 
publishing: Sherlock Holmes’s author Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle.

One of the principal beliefs of Spiritualism is that that angels and spirits of
the dead are closer to God than humans are, and therefore have greater
knowledge than we do. So it was common to ask “spirit guides” for their
advice. Spiritualists, on the whole, didn’t seem to believe in reincarnation,
nor was the major Spiritualist movement interested in occult, hermetic, 
esoteric knowledge or feats of magic.
In the aftermath of the carnage of both the Civil War and World War I,
Spiritualism was especially popular, for good reason. In both conflicts, it was
almost impossible to find any family who hadn’t been touched in some way
by death. Spiritualism tapped into the raw emotions of grief, and the comfort
of knowing that the departed loved one was doing fine in the afterlife was just
too strong for many to resist.
Spiritualism was also popular because it didn’t really conflict with Christian
beliefs in an afterlife. Just because a parishioner was a Spiritualist wouldn’t
get them kicked out of most local church pews. In its earliest days, Quakers
were drawn to the movement in its original forms, but as it grew in popular-
ity, Spiritualists were especially attracted to Christian Science, Universalist,
and Unitarian churches. There have been a few attempts to form organized
Spiritualist churches, but there never was one centralized national or 
international Spiritualist movement.
The Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO)
The Ordo Templi Orientis — OTO — (translated as both Order of the Oriental
Templars and Order of the Temple of the East) is an organization with its roots
in 19th-century Germany. Its founders were among some of the most influen-
tial promoters of esoteric, spiritualistic, and mystical movements beginning
in the late 1800s, and the group has gone through several phases. The OTO
exists today and is an enthusiastic group, claiming approximately 3,000 
members in almost 60 countries (although the bulk of its membership is in
the U.S.).
Founding the OTO
While it is usually associated with a notorious character of the 20th century,
Aleister Crowley (see “Enter Aleister Crowley,” later in this section), the
OTO’s philosophical founder, was a 19th-century German chemist named Carl
Kellner. Kellner was a student of Freemasonry, Theosophy, Rosicrucianism,
Hermeticism, mysticism, spiritualism, and every other kind of esoteric ism.
Kellner was especially fond of a variety of Freemasonry called the Rite of
Memphis-Mizraim. This was a series of pseudo-Masonic degrees that had been
created in Italy and France, influenced by Napoleon’s exploits in Egypt. The
majority of the Masonic world didn’t recognize the Memphis-Mizraim degrees
as legitimate (most Grand Lodges around the world warned their members
195
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

not to associate with purveyors of these Egyptian rites because they were
often promoted by private con artists out to earn a quick chunk of cash by
enrolling gullible initiates in their 90+ degrees). Kellner also wanted to initiate
women into the degrees, a practice that was absolutely forbidden by the 
regular Masonic world.
During this same period, Kellner met up with a Bavarian named Theodore
Reuss. Like Kellner, Reuss was endlessly fascinated by esoteric groups. In
1880, he’d been involved with a failed movement to revive the infamous
Bavarian Order of Illuminati (see Chapter 11). In the following 25 years, he
joined up with a wide range of groups in the U.K. and Europe.
Kellner’s idea was to assemble something like a college or institution to bring
all these different philosophies together under one roof because they all
touched on each other in some way. He believed that instead of withdrawing
into different factions and splinter groups, the various esoteric philosophies
needed to band together so that students of them could experience them as 
a whole.
In 1904, Reuss and Kellner assembled the Memphis-Mizraim Masonic degrees,
along with other irregular degrees that mainstream Freemasonry around the
world didn’t approve of, into what Kellner termed the Acadamia Masonica,
and the OTO would be its inner circle. Kellner wanted to bring these different
degrees from around the world into one consolidated order where only
advanced Masons could see them all.
The trouble was that the mainstream Masonic world wasn’t really interested
in them and continued to refuse to treat them as legitimate degrees of
Freemasonry. When Kellner died a year later, Reuss took over and made
changes. He was an early proponent of women’s rights, so he opened the OTO
up to women, and he incorporated a new French Gnostic church service, the
Église Catholique Gnostique, into the organization, as its official religion.
Enter Aleister Crowley
Aleister Crowley (pronounced crow, like the bird) is one of the most enig-
matic figures in the world of esoteric studies. The mention of his name in a
room full of people who study these subjects usually results in the immediate
split into two camps that either admire him as a larger-than-life genius or
deride him as a drug-addled pervert. But he was the most influential figure in
the occult world of the 20th century.
Crowley was born in England in 1875 and is best remembered in esoteric cir-
cles for incorporating “sex magick” into his occult practices. Sex magick
involved ceremonies that combined his own sexual appetites. In these days
of every imaginable sexual fetish easily accessed and delivered into our living
rooms via the Internet, it’s easy to overlook just how shocking Crowley’s
activities were to society at the time.
196
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

He was instrumental in the popularizing of Tarot cards and the use of Ouiji
boards. He was a mountain climber, a chess master, a prolific author, a mystic,
a hedonist, and a heroin addict, and he became popularly known as “the
Wickedest Man in the World,” a title he enjoyed immensely.
Crowley met Theodore Reuss (see the preceding section) in London in 1910,
and it wasn’t long before he began to influence his Bavarian friend’s OTO.
Crowley had claimed in 1904 that he’d been visited by a spiritual messenger of
the ancient Egyptian god Horus, who’d passed along the details of a new reli-
gion called Thelema, which Crowley wrote down as The Book of the Law
(never mind that it was largely lifted from the earlier satirical work of the
French author François Rabelais in the 1500s).
Reuss became an instant convert to the religion and incorporated Crowley’s
religious services into the OTO’s Gnostic Mass. (In 1920, Reuss went so far as
to suggest to a Zurich convention of Freemasons that Thelema should be the
official religion of all higher degree Masons. The assembled participants were
less than impressed.)
Reuss issued charters for OTO chapters around the world, including one to
Harvey Spencer Lewis of the Rosicrucians in San Jose (see “The Rosicrucians”
earlier in this chapter). When Reuss had a stroke in 1920, Crowley stepped in
and proclaimed himself as the new “Frater Superior of the Order of Oriental
Templars.”
Crowley took the OTO on the road, and went to the United States, but his
reception at the hands of the mainstream Masonic Grand Lodges around 
the U.S. was less than laudatory. Most regular Freemasons were appalled at
Crowley’s scandalous reputation to begin with and were less than thrilled 
with his claims that the OTO was an extension of the Masonic degrees.
Lawsuits were threatened, which was something Crowley was getting used to.
He had a habit of taking rituals from esoteric groups he’d been thrown out of
and publishing their details, which had the effect of shrinking his circle of
friends, as well as attracting legal troubles.
Crowley’s OTO
Crowley completely rewrote the rituals of the OTO to remove the more overt
references to Freemasonry’s first three degrees. Crowley frequently associated
himself with the name Baphomet, as well as the number “666” and the Beast of
the Apocalypse. Both Crowley and his subsequent fans explain away most of
his more shocking or sex-filled writings and activities by claiming the rest 
of the world is just too unenlightened to understand.
Crowley was a lightning rod for trouble. Tales of orgies, mutilation, pederasty
(sex between two men, especially when one is a minor), as well as a series of
torrid affairs with both sexes swirled around him, along with more pedestrian
legal problems. In one notorious episode, a young man died at Crowley’s villa
in Italy after killing a cat and drinking its blood.
197
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

Rumors of sex with children and even human sacrifice at the “Abbey of
Thelema” eventually led fascist dictator Benito Mussolini to have Crowley
booted from the country in 1923.
The post-Crowley OTO
After World War II, the OTO nearly died out, with the only remaining lodge
surviving in California. Shortly before his death, Crowley passed the reigns 
of the Order to a German named Karl Germer, who kept it alive on paper until
his own death in 1962. One alleged member during this slump was L. Ron
Hubbard, who was later the alleged creator of the alleged religion
Scientology. Allegedly.
In 1969, the OTO was revived almost single-handedly by Grady McMurtry,
who had received degrees in 1943 from Crowley himself. McMurtry claimed
to have letters that allowed him to invoke emergency powers and revive the
Order as its new “Caliph.” Naturally more lawsuits and counterclaims erupted
from the countryside, with at least three others claiming the right to “own”
the OTO. A splinter group largely in the U.K., referred to as the Typhonian
Ordo Templi Orientis, still survives today, and seems to be directed more to
extraterrestrial life and demonology.
These days, most of the schismatic caterwaul has quieted down, and
McMurtry’s “Caliphate” OTO is considered by most to be the legitimate heir
to Crowley’s Order. Its current Caliphate is William Breeze, known by his
more esoteric name, Hymenaeus Beta.
20th-Century Occultism and 
the Rise of the Nazis
In the occult secret societies that flourished and grew around the beginning
of the 20th century, the occult became wedded to science and reason. The
roots in Rosicrucianism from the 1600s became perverted more than any
other period in history in peddling this new packaging of an old product.
These new societies had their own brand of “scientific” proof, with their own
terminology, featuring long-winded explanations for the vital life force that
controlled the spirit world, and even new machinery designed to track and
measure the forces of that world. They dipped at will into Eastern faiths,
pulling out profound-sounding phrases for their New Age occult wisdom.
For these new occultists, Christ was no longer an old-fashioned Messiah,
weighted down with all that mouldy old Jewish influence. According to these
new thinkers, Christ became just another “avatar,” a Hindu word for a deity 
in human form, only one of many people who influenced world events. The
next step was to prove that Christ hadn’t been Jewish at all and to prove 
it “scientifically.”
198
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Spiritualism, Theosophy, and Eastern mysticism all congealed after the end of
World War I so that, by the 1920s, both Europe and the U.S. were absolutely
awash in occult secret societies. In consequence, Germany in 1933 was the
setting for a Perfect Storm — all these cultural forces were about to combine
with national humiliation and a desire to be superior, like their folk legends of
mythological gods told them they once were.
Out of it would come Hitler’s Third Reich, which annihilated bourgeois values
and Christian faith, replacing them with an entirely new society, built on
secrecy, racism, and the occult. The evolution of this Nazi thinking begins
with the influence of a 19th-century Ukrainian woman named Helena
Petrovna Blavatsky.
Madame Blavatsky’s Theosophical Society
It would be hard to invent a more colorful fictional character than Madame
Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (known often by her initials HPB), and indeed, it is
possible that many of the legends that swirled around her she created her-
self. She had an incredible influence on esoteric and occult societies that
appeared after her death. Her Theosophical Society also had an influence
into the 20th century.
A rediscovery of Blavatsky’s writings in the 1960s led to the explosion of
interest in Buddhism and other eastern religions, as well as the New Age
movement of the 1980s and beyond.
Blavatsky the medium
Blavatsky claimed to be many things, and while she was a peculiar little spud
in both appearance and personality, she understood showmanship, and
during the height of the Spiritualism movement, she became famous for her
abilities as a medium. She believed in dressing the part of a mystic, and wore
voluminous robes, a babushka (a Russian headscarf), and fistfuls of rings,
and carried her cigarettes in a pouch made from an animal’s head. Her homes
were often decorated in the trappings of the bizarre — one favorite item was
a stuffed baboon dressed in a formal morning suit, with a copy of Charles
Darwin’s Origin of the Species tucked under his arm. She regularly engaged in
séances and psychic illusions like levitation, astral projection, telepathy, and
clairvoyance.
But Blavatsky wasn’t calling forth dead relatives to see how they were getting
along in the afterlife. Her views differed greatly from the Spiritualist move-
ment of the period, and she was contacting the spirit world to receive
Hermetic, esoteric, occult knowledge.
199
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

In 1873, Blavatsky moved to New York City, and while traveling the American
countryside, she met up with Henry Steel Olcott. Olcott was an attorney and
an agricultural authority, and had served on the official government commis-
sion that investigated the Abraham Lincoln assassination. They became good
friends, and six years later, he helped her found the Theosophical Society.
Forming the Theosophical Society
In 1875, Blavatsky, Olcott, and Irish-born mystic and lawyer William Quan
Judge, along with 16 others, formed the Theosophical Society in New York. At
first, its original purpose was to investigate spiritualists and mediums, and to
report on their legitimacy or bogusness. But it soon changed to teach HPB’s
own religious concepts.
200
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 
Masters of wisdom and the 
Great White Brotherhood
One of the coauthors of Johann Valentin Andrae’s
Rosicrucian pamphlets was Heinrich Neuhaus,
and his biggest claim to fame was in publicly
identifying where the mythical originators of
Rosicrucianism had supposedly disappeared to:
Tibet and India. This was back in the 1600s, and
Europeans generally didn’t go to such exotic and
hard to get to places in those days. Thus,
Neuhaus had conveniently packed the Order off
into the mists of obscurity where it was unlikely
anyone would go looking for them.
More than two centuries later, Madame
Blavatsky did just that. While she was stomping
around Tibet and the Himalayas in the 1850s and
’60s, she claimed that she became enlightened
enough to be contacted by a spiritual assembly
of Masters of Wisdom. These Masters were sup-
posed to have once been very learned mortals
who’d discovered the secrets to Life, the
Universe, and Everything. Because of their mas-
tery of the occult arts on Earth, they retained the
ability, after they died, to communicate with a
select few living people who were spiritually
enlightened — namely, Madame Blavatsky. At
times she would summon them to speak during
her séances. Other times they would dictate 
letters for her to write out, and after the
Theosophical Society was formed, the Masters
often used this technique to pass along 
management recommendations and to suggest
officer appointments. Amazingly, such letters
always seemed to back up M. Blavatsky’s rec-
ommendations.
After Blavatsky’s death, further studies by the
Theosophical Society’s members added to
claims of the Masters’ abilities. And of course,
they continued to speak to a select few of the
Society’s leaders, guiding their decisions. A wide
range of terms developed over the years, all
alluding to the same concept. They were called
Hidden Masters, Elder Brothers, Mahatmas, and
the Ascended Masters. Later theosophical and
Rosicrucian groups have referred to them as the
Great White Brotherhood, with the term “white”
meaning the spiritual aura that surrounds them,
and not a racial term. In fact, Blavatsky had
described them as Hindu, Indian (dot, not
feather), or Tibetan. Others have described the
group of Masters as a Great White Lodge. Over
the years, various claims of membership in the
Great White Brotherhood have included Jesus,
the Buddha, Confucius, and a raft of others,
including Blavatsky’s own favorite mysterious
spiritual contact, Kuthumi.

Blavatsky’s Theosophy taught that all religions were equally true and mean-
ingful in their core philosophies — it was just their “packaging” that was
imperfect. In other words, every religion is correct when you boil them 
down to their most basic ideas, and where religions fail, or at least stumble
and confuse people, is in all the rituals, rules, trappings, costumes, saints,
statues, and holy days they attach to themselves over the years. She 
also believed that esoteric knowledge — Hermeticism, and especially the
mind/body/spirit-centered Eastern religions of Asia — contained the 
simplest, truest, and most important sacred teachings.
Her two-volume book, Isis Revealed, published in 1877, put forth the notion
that science needed to loosen its corset and accept mystical manifestations
like spiritualism and the paranormal as scientific phenomenon, along with
castigating religions for losing sight of their cosmic roots.
Blavatsky pulled a world full of inspirations together under one roof for her
Theosophical Society. She combined Buddhist philosophy, Rosicrucian
mythology, spiritualism, bogus pseudo-science, and packaged it together
under an organizational model patterned after the Freemasons. There was an
international governing office, but countries had their own regional offices,
and local chapters were called “lodges.”
The Theosophical Society’s logo was a curious symbol that combined an
ouroboros (a snake wrapped in a circle, eating its own tail), a Star of David, an
Ankh (an Egyptian symbol resembling a cross with an oval at the top), and a
swastika.
Blavatsky used the swastika because it was a symbol in India for the sun and
for positive energy. In its Indian form, the swastika is a cross, with trailing
lines that make it look like it is spinning clockwise. Its use in Nazi Germany
was the opposite — spinning counterclockwise. Some occult researchers
claim this is a symbol of negative energy, but there is no agreement on this
point. Pre-Nazi Germans used the symbol as good luck charms during WWI,
and it could face either direction. Meanwhile, the swastika is a symbol thou-
sands of years old, and it appears in ancient cultures all over the world as a
sign of the sun, power, and luck.
India, Aryans, and the Secret Doctrines
In 1879, Blavatsky and Olcott packed up and moved the international head-
quarters to Adyar, India, where they could more closely study Eastern reli-
gions and philosophy. William Quan Judge stayed home and ran the U.S. side
of the Society. While India was an exotic location on the other side of the
world, the presence of a motley crew of Western oddballs wasn’t unusual —
England had colonized India in the 1800s and was in complete control of the
country by the mid-1850s.
201
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

Blavatsky and Olcott remained in India for many years, but HPB eventually
moved to England, where she established an Inner Circle of 12 disciples (what
good is an occult society without an “inner circle?”). In 1888, she published
her magnum opus, The Secret Doctrines. Another two-volume work, it was an
attempt to combine eastern religions with science. Blavatsky claimed that the
text had been “revealed” to her through the Mahatmas, the Hidden Masters.
One of the most important items in Blavatsky’s The Secret Doctrines is the first
real concept of the Aryan Race (see the sidebar “Blavatsky’s Aryans”) — a
concept that German occultists and, later, the Nazis took very much to heart.
202
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 
Blavatsky’s Aryans
The term Aryan long predated the use of it in Nazi
Germany as a description of some master race.
The term was used throughout the 1800s to
describe an ancient Indian/Iranian language that
predates Sanskrit (somewhere around 2500 BC),
and became a common term for any of the Indo-
European peoples. By the early 1900s, Aryan had
become a generic term in some circles used to
describe “gentiles.” Blavatsky uses the term
Aryan in The Secret Doctrinesto describe the last
of what she called five Root Races, dating back
millions of years. Blavatsky’s view of evolution
was that the human race began as a purely spir-
itual race, and gradually devolved into ape-like
creatures. According to her, the Root Races were
 A perfect, Astral race that all others first
originated from.
 A race that came from the legendary land of
Hyperborea, above the Arctic Circle, the
spiritual center point of the Earth. The Arctic
was seen as pure and good, while evil
emanated from the South Pole.
 A race from Lemuria,a lost land in the Pacific
Ocean that predated Atlantis. These were 7-
foot-tall creatures who laid eggs and were
considered to be spiritually pure, but they had
no intellect. Their downfall was in inter-
breeding with animals. They fell out of favor
with the gods, who sank Lemuria into the sea.
 Not wanting to repeat their mistakes, the
gods created the fourth race, the Atlanteans,
and provided them with great intelligence.
The Atlanteans created the perfect society
and incredible cultural achievements before
Atlantis was swallowed up by the sea.
 The fifth race was the Aryans, made up of
what are now Hindus, Persians, Egyptians,
Greeks, and the Europeans. They appeared
just as Atlantis was sinking under the ocean,
about 850,000 years ago. Blavatsky creates
a hierarchy of the modern races — what
some were good at, others weren’t.
(Interestingly, she felt that “white men” were
almost incapable of performing magic.)
Blavatsky’s discussion of race doesn’t contain
much in the way of what people today call
“racial characteristics.” Blavatsky’s terms
described a spiritual makeup of people from cer-
tain regions. She wrote of a Universal
Brotherhood of Man and believed that all the
peoples of the earth were descended from one
common source. She still had a 19th-century
personal prejudice of people from certain parts
of the world behaving in certain ways. But her
writings on the Root Races were not intended as
commentary on one ethnic group being “better”
than another. Unfortunately, later readers didn’t
see it that way, and a wave of fascination over
this Aryan concept became the bedrock of
German movements that led to Nazi theories of
a Master Race.

German occultism, secret 
societies, and the Nazis
In the years leading up to World War I, there was a fascination in Germany
and Austria with Viking paganism, Norse legends, and the study of early
Germanic pictograms called runes (both the swastika and the dual lightning-
bolt symbol adopted by the Nazis are examples of these symbolic runes).
Between about 1890 and 1935, two Austrians, Guido von List and Adolf Josef
Lanz von Liebenfels, garnered a huge interest in these Nordic legends with
their writings.
Guido von List Society
Guido von List was a follower of a Russian-born mystic, magician, and eso-
teric author, Madame Blavatsky (see earlier in this chapter) and her theories
of Theosophy. He salted in his own mix of worship of the legendary Norse
god Wotan, along with tales of the magical effects of first-century German and
Scandinavian runes. List believed that a secret ancient Aryan priesthood had
developed this esoteric knowledge.
List’s writings became very popular, and a “Guido von List Society” formed
before World War I, with an impressive membership list of prestigious 
and famous people. One of those fans was Adolf Josef Lanz (who pompously
and dishonestly added the noble German title “von Liebenfels” to his 
name), another Vienna student of the occult. Like List, Lanz had been born a
Catholic and had even become a Cistercian monk for a while as a young man.
In truth, Lanz remained captivated by the ritual and history of the Catholic
Church, especially during its medieval days.
Naturally, it wasn’t long before the Society declared the existence of a special,
inner circle, called the High Armenan Order, developed to practice secret
rites of magic.
Lanz was very interested in List’s theories about ancient, secret knowledge 
of runes, magic, racial purity, and esotericism. The difference was he didn’t
need List’s claptrap about Viking gods. Lanz knew exactly who those secret
Aryan priests were: They were Knights Templar.
Ordo Novi Templi
In 1907, Lanz founded the Ordo Novi Templi (Order of the New Temple), in the
Castle Werfenstein, overlooking the Danube. Lanz developed an occult Aryan
philosophy he called Ariosophy, which he applied to his new form of chivalric
knighthood. His Aryan philosophy espoused Darwin’s “survival of the fittest,”
applied to human beings, he wrote a lengthy paper describing a novel view 
of mankind. The Aryan Race had descended from a race of extraterrestrials
called Theozoa, and the “lesser” races had come from the Theozoa breeding
with apes. We’re only reporting it.
203
Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

Germany was not the only place these ideas were being cooked up. There was
a worldwide movement growing based on the pseudo-science of eugenics, the
method of selective human evolution. That’s a nice way of saying choosy
breeding for “superior” humans, sterilization, and taken to its most horrible
extreme, extermination of inferiors. In its mildest form, it was promoted in
Europe and the U.S., supposedly to stop hereditary birth defects. But in forms
like those advanced by Adolf Josef Lanz and others, it was designed to create
a Master Race. Lanz was especially contemptuous of Christian compassion for
what he termed the “weak and inferior.” He promoted his theories in a maga-
zine called Ostara (which is undoubtedly where Hitler first read about it), and
it became popular throughout Germany and Austria.
Still, Lanz’s Ordo Novi Templi (ONT) seemed to be a secret society that was
more directed to political ambitions than engaging in racial purity experi-
ments. It supported the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in 1914, the
action that set off World War I. And the ONT was a key supporter of the
Austrian National Socialist Party in the 1930s.
Germanenorden
In 1912, a group of German believers in the occult formed a secret society
based on the writings of Guido von List, called the Germanenorden (meaning
the Teutonic Order). One of the founding members, Hermann Pohl, had some-
thing of a cottage industry selling bronze good-luck charms and rings deco-
rated with runes to German soldiers during WWI. One of the most popular
was the swastika — a symbol of power, said to be formed by Thor’s hammer
and the sun. Germanenorden was one of the increasing number of Aryan-only
groups growing in Germany, and it required new members to promise only to
marry Aryan women.
Walvater of the Holy Grail
One thing you can usually count on with fledgling esoteric societies is that
sooner or later a power struggle will lead to a schism. Sure enough, the
Germanenorden quickly suffered from internal squabbles and split off another
group called the German Order Walvater of the Holy Grail, founded by
Hermann Pohl.
Another founding member of Walvater was Rudolf Glandeck von Sebottendorff.
Sebottendorff was involved in several mystical, occult groups before and after
World War I, and in 1909 he claimed he had joined a pseudo-Masonic Memphis-
Mizraim lodge in Turkey. From his descriptions of it, this particular lodge 
combined Rosicrucianism, alchemy, astrology, and even Islamic Sufism.
Pohl believed that Freemasons and Jews were essentially one and the same,
and both needed to be run out of the country — a stance that didn’t seem to
get under the skin of self-described Freemason Sebottendorff, at least not
very much. Sebottendorff was charged with increasing the membership, and
indeed he did. The rolls of the society went from just 100 in 1917 to more
than 1,500 the next year.
204
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Thule Gesellschaft
In short order, Pohl ran out and started yet another occult group, called
Thule Gesellschaft, in 1918. On the surface, it was a study group for students
of Guido Von List’s philosophies. But behind the scenes, they were stockpil-
ing guns and ammo to attack the growing Communist Party. So much for 
esoteric book exchanges.
A year later, Thule Gesellschaft merged with the Committee of Independent
Workers, and renamed itself the German Worker’s Party, and it is at this point
Adolph Hitler enters the story. He quickly took over the Party and chose the
rune of the swastika as the group’s identifying symbol. The following year, he
changed the name to the slightly more expansive National Socialist German
Worker’s Party. We all know them as the Nazis.
Heinrich Himmler’s Nazi Knighthood
If Hitler wasn’t especially interested in the occult, some of his pals certainly
were. And Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfürer of Hitler’s Schutzstaffel (better
known as the SS, and engineers of the Holocaust), Adolf Hitler’s feared 
internal secret police, was absolutely obsessed by the subject.
Himmler came to the town of Buren in the Westphalia region of western
Germany in 1934 and took over the imposing castle of Wewelsburg. The
castle was to become the center of a college for new SS officers and
Himmler’s own elite Knightly Order. The castle became the place of initiation
of this new order and the new spiritual center of the Nazi paganism that was
based on Germanic legends.
Himmler planned very big. His goal was to make the surrounding village a
complete SS colony, only for members of the SS and their families. In 1939, 
a concentration camp was established to provide 3,900 prisoners to work on
the project. More than 1,200 were worked or starved to death building
Himmler’s dream.
Himmler saw Wewelsburg as his own private Camelot, which, of course,
needed a Round Table for its knights. In the north tower, a round chamber
was constructed, with a sunken area in the floor and a round, oak table.
There were just 12 seats around it, for the top dozen officers of the SS. In the
domed ceiling a stylized swastika set in stone can still be seen today, modi-
fied with the symbol of the SS at each corner. A different subterranean round
chamber immediately below it was to be a crypt for the ashes of all dead SS
members, complete with an eternal flame. Another one of Himmler’s goals
was to find the Holy Grail, and a special room in the castle was set aside for
the Grail when it was found.

Chapter 10: Rosicrucians and the Evolution of Occult Secret Societies

The Ahnenerbe Forschungs-und Lehrgemeinschaft (the Ancestral Heritage
Research and Teaching Society) was created to use the methods of science to
bend history and archeology enough to back up the Nazis’ racial and cultural
policies. Ahnenerbe’s headquarters were based in Wewelsburg Castle, and
Himmler had a lot of projects for them. (In the film Raiders of the Lost Ark, the
Nazi group looking for the Ark of the Covenant is supposed to be a contingent
of Ahnenerbe archeologists.)
The Nazis went to great lengths to engineer an elaborate explanation that
Jesus was descended from Jacob, who, they said, wasn’t Jewish at all, but 
an Aryan. Another part of Ahnenerbe’s mission was to prove the origin of the
Aryans, and they sent archeological expeditions to India and Tibet to seek
evidence of the earliest appearance of their “Master Race” — coming full
circle to Madame Blavatsky’s writings.

 Introducing Adam Weishaupt’s Illuminati and his world takeover plans
 Reinventing the Illuminati
T
he supersecret society called the Illuminati seems to be everywhere you
look in the world of conspiracy theories. This group supposedly consists
of the ultimate world-dominating evil geniuses. Their universal logo, the All-
Seeing Eye and the unfinished pyramid, is on the back of the U.S. dollar bill,
along with their motto, “A New World Order.” One of their earliest members,
Thomas Jefferson, wrote their criminal influence into the Declaration of
Independence. They created all that is evil, including the European Union,
barcodes, injected microchips, Paris Hilton’s career, and ATM fees.
The Illuminati are somewhat unique in the catalog of secret societies in 
this book, because in all probability, they don’t exist. Sorry to let you down
like that.
There was one famous group called the “Illuminati” in the 18th century. It
lasted less than eight years, and its membership was very, very small. Many
other groups followed, even to the present day, claiming the mantle of the
original Illuminati, or having that moniker stuck on them without their having
asked for it. In fact, in the alternate universe of the Internet, accusations about
the “vast influence” of this little-known secret society get thrown around 
constantly.
If you first heard of the Illuminati in Dan Brown’s novel, Angels & Demons
(Pocket), the truth is a lot more interesting than the fiction. This chapter
explains who the real Illuminati were, where they came from, and just why
their legacy continues to capture the public imagination.

The Original “Illuminated Ones”
The Enlightenment, a period that lasted roughly throughout the hundred
years of the 1700s in Europe and America, was an intellectual, scientific, and
philosophical movement all rolled into one. It was a time when the scientific
method of experimentation and reason replaced the more superstitious 
attitudes of the Middle Ages — a time of revolution, scientific discovery, and
invention.
The very term enlightenment was chosen as a contrast to the Dark Ages, and
light and illumination became a metaphor for knowledge and republicanism
(meaning governments free of kings, popes, and their “divine rights”). In fact,
late medieval adepts at alchemy or the sciences were sometimes called 
“the Illuminated Ones.”
The first group to be associated with the term Illuminati was known in Spain
as the Alumbrados. Appearing in the late 1400s, not much is known about this
sect of Christian mystics. They apparently believed in trancelike meditation
to the exclusion of all other thoughts in order to commune with God, and
they developed decidedly un-Catholic beliefs, such as the notion that female
adepts copulating with priests released souls from Purgatory. Not surpris-
ingly, the Spanish Inquisition came crashing down on the Alumbrados like a
ton of evangelical bricks.
What really brought down the wrath of the church on the Alumbrados was
their belief that man could achieve enough perfection through meditation
and prayer to become sinless. Where they got into hot water was the belief
that if you achieved sinless perfection, you would no longer have to fast or
even pray, and you wouldn’t have to deny your physical body anything any-
more. Your mind would become divine, so whatever you did with your body
was of no consequence. See if your partner buys that story.
A French group appeared in the early 1600s known as the Illuminés, and they
seem to have been an offshoot of the Spanish Alumbrados. But these groups
have no real connection to the Illuminati that’s at the center of so many 
conspiracy theories today, apart from the same name.
The Bavarian Illuminati: 
Short Life, Long Legacy
In 1776, just before the Continental Congress declared American indepen-
dence from England, on the other side of the world a new “secret society”
that was to become the Illuminati — the real Illuminati — was born in
Ingolstadt, Bavaria. First called The Perfectabilists, the group was the 
brainchild of a young university professor named Adam Weishaupt.
208
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Adam Weishaupt
The man who founded the Illuminati had an unlikely background for the
leader of such a radical organization. Adam Weishaupt was born in Ingolstadt
in 1748. When his father died seven years later, Adam was placed in the 
care of his grandfather, Baron Johann Adam Ickstatt, who was curator of the
University of Ingstadt. The University of Ingstadt was a Catholic school, and
the majority of the administration and teaching staff were Jesuit priests.
Weishaupt graduated from the university in 1768. He spent another four years
there as a tutor, and in 1772 he became a full professor of civil law.
What makes all this important in his development is that, a year later, Pope
Clement XIV had an explosive disagreement with the Jesuits and completely
dissolved the Order. As a result, the young Weishaupt was appointed to the
chair of canon (Catholic) law, the first non-Jesuit and layman to have the
position in almost 100 years.
What made this appointment ironic is that Weishaupt was privately very 
anti-Catholic. He spent years studying the philosophies and beliefs of the
freethinking Enlightenment writers and had no patience with superstition,
miracles, or sacraments. Unfortunately, he was in the sticky situation of 
earning his livelihood at a Catholic university, teaching canon law as 
proscribed by the Vatican!
Spartacus and the Areopagites
On May 1, 1776, Weishaupt formed his secret society, with just five 
original members, who were referred to as the Areopagites (named after the
hill in Greek mythology where Ares, the God of War, was tried and acquitted
of murder). Weishaupt had a big goal in mind for such a small bunch. He
believed that a group dedicated to mutual aid, intellectualism, and philosoph-
ical free thought could help change the world by influencing the movers and
shakers of society.
In addition (at first, anyway), they had no interest in recruiting anyone much
over the age of 35 or so, because such “old” men were too creaky and set in
their ways. This attitude would change over time, as they discovered they
needed important, well-placed men who were already in positions of some
influence to infiltrate the military and halls of government.
Because of his position at a Catholic university, which would undoubtedly 
be less than ecstatic over one of its professors writing anti-Catholic essays,
Weishaupt and his organizers communicated using code names. At least two
of the other four members were students at the university, known by their
secret names Ajax and Tiberius. Writing as Spartacus (the name of a slave
who led a massive revolt against Rome in 73 BC), Weishaupt outlined a secret
209
Chapter 11: The Illuminati: The Bavarian Boogeymen

plan to infiltrate the Freemasons’ lodges, and then overthrow governments of
nations and churches, take over the world, and create a new world order of
tolerance and equality. It was as simple as that.
But a peaceful social change wasn’t really what Weishaupt had in mind. In
order to alter society, kings and princes, as well as church leaders, all had to
be, well, gotten rid of first. These folks were the foes of his brand of enlight-
enment and republican thinking. And, of course, because he and his four
young friends saw themselves as being superior to most of the common herd,
they would remain in control of this new, improved society.
The name of the organization itself changed over time from Perfectabilists to
the Bees and finally the Illuminati. In code, the organization was represented
by a dot within a circle. The symbol was meant to represent the Sun illumi-
nating all bodies in its orbit.
The Masonic connection
In 1777, Weishaupt joined a Masonic lodge (see Chapter 9) — Munich’s 
Lodge Theodore of Good Council — and began looking for like-minded brethren
to recruit into his circle of the Illuminati. Unlike the overwhelming majority 
of so-called secret societies that sprung up all over Europe in the 1700s,
Weishaupt’s Illuminati was definitely not preoccupied with occultism, mysti-
cism, esotericism, or hidden knowledge. At least, not the medieval, alchemical
kind of stuff that groups like the Rosicrucians were hunting. In fact, anything
that seemed to have been influenced by Judaism, Kabbalah, and Catholicism
in particular, wasn’t allowed to seep into the Illuminati rituals.
What there was plenty of was secrecy. Major concentration centered around
the memorization of ciphers — secret writing codes. As the years progressed,
Illuminati members were instructed in how to mix poisons, prepare for 
suicide in case of discovery, and even construct “infernal machines” in which
to hide their secret papers (infernal machines are explosive boxes that 
self-destruct if tampered with). The Illuminati created groups of members
who were supposed to infiltrate Masonic lodges and take control of them.
Code-named the Insinuators, they quickly invaded the membership of
Munich’s Lodge Theodore of Good Council and totally controlled it by 1779.
A friend of Weishaupt’s, Baron Adolf Franz Friederich Knigge, was a well-
known diplomat and Freemason in Bavaria and assisted Weishaupt with
developing ceremonial rituals for the new Illuminati, roughly based on the
Masonic model. He became a member of the Illuminati in 1780. Eventually,
Knigge crafted 12 degrees in all for the group, divided into several groups:
 Nursery: These initiatory degrees were designed to determine whether
new members shared the group’s philosophical beliefs and to impress
upon the candidate the importance of secrecy.
210
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

 Masonry: Patterned after the degrees found in Freemasonry, the initial
“Masonry” degrees weren’t very different from what occurred in regular
lodges. Again, as candidates climbed the ladder of degrees, the goal was
to find out whether they would go along with the more revolutionary
aims of the Illuminati.
 Lower Mysteries: Later degrees slowly exposed the candidate to more 
of the Illuminati’s anti-monarchial, anti-Catholic goals.
 Greater Mysteries: The highest degrees were designed to teach new
leaders how to bring in new members.
With the new degree structure finally in place, and Knigge’s help in recruiting
prominent and influential members, the Illuminati started to catch on in intel-
lectual, Masonic circles. The German poet Johann Goethe became a member,
and in a relatively short period of time, the group attracted at least 2,000
members in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Poland,
Hungary, Italy, and France.
The Illuminati was designed to be a society of Enlightenment-era thinkers,
first and foremost. In spite of the usual accusations that appeared after 
the group’s demise, Weishaupt conceived of the Illuminati to make society
happier by enlightening the mind. It’s philosophy encouraged the end 
of superstition in both science and faith, and sought intellectual equality
between the sexes. While Weishaupt was anti-Catholic, Knigge was a practic-
ing Christian, and neither man intended the group to be anti-Christian.
The Congress of Wilhelmsbad
In 1782, a curious event occurred in the town of Wilhelmsbad, billed as 
a Congress of Masonry. Freemasonry (see Chapter 9) was developed to
enhance society by taking good men and improving their character, making
them better citizens. Masonic secrecy was simply a demonstration of honor
among its members.
But Freemasonry developed very differently on the European continent than
in Britain and the Americas. It took some strange and sinister turns, espe-
cially in the German states, with the Illuminati’s growing influence in Masonic
lodges on the one side, and another German group called the Rite Of Strict
Observance (see Chapter 9 for more about Baron Von Hund’s Rite of Strict
Observance) on the other. These new groups were something different, with a
militant obsession over secrecy, and almost no interest in any of that charac-
ter-building malarkey.
Mainstream Freemasons were alarmed about the directions these new groups
were taking them. Delegates came to the Congress of Wilhelmsbad from
Austria, France, Italy, Holland, and Russia to discuss the matter. More than a
few disgruntled Masons went home convinced that they had to do something
to stop this new movement.
211
Chapter 11: The Illuminati: The Bavarian Boogeymen

The Illuminati cracks up
While the Congress of Wilhelmsbad sowed discontent over the Illuminati’s
influence among Freemasons, the Illuminati itself was also starting to 
crack from within. Weishaupt became bolder in his professional life, and he
increasingly subjected his Catholic students at the University of Ingoldstadt
to his anti-Catholic tirades.
Meanwhile, Knigge became convinced that Weishaupt was really a closet
Jesuit spy, and he came to completely distrust him. Knigge handed over all
his Illuminati material in 1784 and walked out of the Order. Other defections
soon followed for different reasons.
Several ex-members went to the duchess of Bavaria, Maria Anna, with
Illuminati documents and a membership list. Confronted with clear evidence
of a group that was actively gunning for their regal positions, she took it to
her husband, the duke of Bavaria, Carl Theodore. As monarch of Bavaria, he
quickly enacted a law forbidding any and all groups, clubs, or societies that
hadn’t been authorized by the state, and a year later clarified his position by
naming the Illuminati specifically as the group he was really after.
Weishaupt soldiered on, creating a flurry of anti-Catholic and anti-monarchial
pamphlets. The duke at last issued arrest warrants against him and the
Areopagites in 1785. Weishaupt fled the country to Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg in
central Germany, but left behind his incriminating papers, outlining the
Illuminati’s ambitious, if not bizarre and downright silly, plans for world 
domination. They were widely published throughout Europe to expose the
Illuminati and to flush out other members, many of whom were in govern-
ment, military, and university positions. A large number of them wound up 
in prison, and more were banished from Bavaria altogether.
212
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 
Illuminati and the French Revolution
We talk about the influence John Robison’s book,
Proofs of a Conspiracy, and the Abbé Barruel’s
Memoirs had on the world of conspiracists in
Chapters 2 and 6. Their books are still cited today
as source material for conspiracy theorists, even
though so much of their information was simply
conjecture or invention.
Not to bore you with line-by-line refutations, but
both authors claimed Illuminati Insinuators were
in Paris infiltrating specific lodges. They go on to
name the men, lodges, and dates, but time and
time again, they get them wrong.
Figures of the revolution like Charles Maurice de
Talleyrand-Périgord and Honoré Gabriel Riqueti,
Comte de Mirabeau have never been proved to
be either Freemasons or Illuminati, in spite of
Robison and Barruel’s accusations. Both claim
these men, and more, made speeches in lodges
that didn’t exist when they say they did. They
both repeatedly put men who couldn’t have 
been there in lodges that weren’t open, or even
chartered yet. They put words in the mouths of
men who never said them.

The Bavarian Order of the Illuminati died officially in 1785, and its secrets and
Evil Plans For World Dominatio were discovered, published, and ridiculed,
eventually worldwide. The movement was never popular and died out com-
pletely by the end of the century. But the phantom of the Illuminati survived
in the public’s memory. Because of its ties to many European Freemasons of
the period, the two groups became intertwined in the public imagination.
As for the Illuminati’s founder, Weishaupt became a professor at the
University of Gottingen. He wrote several apologetic treatises about the
Order over the years. And he promised to never, ever, ever try to take over
the world again. Cross his heart.
Illuminati in America?
The life and death of the Illuminati in Europe has been well documented, 
and many of the organization’s papers were greatly publicized after Adam
Weishaupt (see the previous sections) fled Bavaria. But the Illuminati’s time
span coincided with the early days of the fledgling United States, during and
immediately after the American Revolution. Trustworthy records of the
group’s activities in America — if indeed there were any — are nonexistent.
George Washington was sent a copy of John Robison’s book, Proofs of a
Conspiracy (see Chapter 9 for more about this important book), warning him
of the spread of Illuminism, and the possible infiltration of Freemason lodges
(of which Washington was a member). He believed that none of the Lodges
were contaminated with Illuminati principles, but in a follow-up letter, he
explained that he didn’t
. . . doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism
had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly
satisfied of this fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey, was, that 
I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as
Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or 
pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of separation).
Some researchers have alleged that a Columbia Lodge of the Illuminati was
started in New York City in 1785. Over the next four years, as many as 14
more Illuminati lodges sprung up in the 13 states, including one in Virginia
that supposedly counted Thomas Jefferson as a member (see the sidebar
“Thomas Jefferson and the Illuminati” later in this chapter). But there is no
proof whatsoever that these lodges ever existed.
The supposed Columbia Lodge of the Illuminati was claimed to have been the
fraternal refuge of New York governor Dewitt Clinton, newspaper editor and
future politician Horace Greeley, and New York politician Clinton Roosevelt.
Roosevelt himself, it has been claimed over the years, used the philosophy of
the Illuminati in his 1841 book, Science Of Government Founded On Natural
213
Chapter 11: The Illuminati: The Bavarian Boogeymen

Law. He was a distant cousin of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR),
and some people claim that the book is a blueprint for both Karl Marx’s 1848
Communist Manifesto and FDR’s socialistic New Deal programs of the 1930s.
Those folks looking under the rug for a conspiracy claim that the Illuminati,
through Clinton Roosevelt, created Communism along with FDR’s New Deal
programs. And as icing on the cake, FDR (who was also a Freemason, by the
way) put the All-Seeing Eye and the unfinished pyramid, which are, as any
good conspiracist knows, symbols of the Illuminati (or the Masons; or both),
on the back of the U.S. one dollar bill. (The All-Seeing Eye in a triangle that
appears in the U.S. Great Seal really started out in the Renaissance as a
Christian symbol for God, with the triangle representing the Holy Trinity. See
Chapter 9 for more about the supposed Masonic symbols on the dollar.)
Building a Boogeyman: The Illuminati 
as All-purpose Evil
After the death of the Bavarian Illuminati, a bewildering amount of literature
poured out of Europe purporting to tell as many lurid details of the organiza-
tion as authors could discover (or make up). Much like today, tales of a
supersecret group engaged in conspiracies to overthrow the kings of Europe,
especially during the aftermath of the bloody French Revolution, sold lots of
newspapers and books all over the world. In spite of its small size, short life
span, and publicly ousted officials and founders, the Illuminati captured the
minds of the public in the early 1800s. After that, tales of the Illuminati
slipped into obscurity.
The Illuminati and the occult
In the 1860s, a French magician and author named Eliphas Lévi wrote a series
of books and pamphlets that became the centerpiece of modern occult lore.
In his book, A History of Magic, Lévi mistakenly claims that the Bavarian
Illuminati was occult and its members had “habitual communications with
the dead.” The last thing Weishaupt’s Illuminati involved was the occult.
Nevertheless, Lévi claimed that the Rosicrucians, the Knights Templar, the
Freemasons, and the Illuminati were all secret magicians dabbling in occult
practices.
In the 1870s, a German named Theodor Reuss was busy dabbling in obscure,
irregular Masonic organizations, and in 1880, he started his own Order of the
Illuminati in Berlin and Munich. The group never managed to attract many
members, so in 1895, Reuss decided to invent his own Masonic lodge that
claimed to be a lodge of the Illuminati. Reuss would go on to create the Ordo
Templi Orientis in 1906, and his successor Aleister Crowley took the claims of
the Illuminati and the occult and embellished them (see Chapter 10).
214

Nesta Webster and the Illuminati’s 
conspiracy against civilization
In 1920, an English conspiracy theorist named Nesta Webster published a
series of articles in the London Morning Post based on the Protocols of the
Elders of Zion, a notorious piece of Russian anti-Jewish propaganda (see
Chapter 6). The next year, she extended her articles and published them as
The Cause of World Unrest. This influential work resurrected Barruel and
Robison’s claims that secret society caused the French Revolution, making
the strong charge that it and all the unrest in the world since the revolution
were caused by a Jewish/Freemason/Illuminati conspiracy, using powers of
the occult. Webster believed this was a conspiracy against civilization, and
her theories became incredibly popular. Winston Churchill and Lord
Kitchener (England’s Field Marshal in India) were fans of her theories.
215
Chapter 11: The Illuminati: The Bavarian Boogeymen
Thomas Jefferson and the Illuminati
The evidence usually cited to peg Jefferson as a
member of the Illuminati is based on one letter
he wrote to Bishop James Madison in January
1800. The letter is frequently quoted out of con-
text, leaving out the part in which he makes it
clear that he knows nothing about the Order,
apart from what he’d just read in Abbé Barruél’s
book, published after the French Revolution (see
Chapters 2 and 6 for more about Barruél’s impor-
tant book). The spellings are Jefferson’s:
I have lately by accident got a sight of a
single volume (the 3d) of the Abbé Barruel’s
Antisocial Conspiracy, which gives me the
first idea I have ever had of what is meant by
the Illuminatism. . . . Barruel’s own parts of
the book are perfectly the ravings of a
Bedlamite. But he quotes largely from
Wishaupt whom he considers as the
founder of what he calls the order. . . . I will
give you the idea I have formed from only an
hour’s reading of Barruel’s quotations from
him, which, you may be sure, are not the
most favorable. Wishaupt seems to be 
an enthusiastic philanthropist. He is among
those . . . who believe in the infinite 
perfectability of man. He thinks he may in
time be rendered so perfect that he will be
able to govern himself in every circum-
stance, so as to injure none, to do all the
good he can, to leave government no occa-
sion to exercise their powers over him, and,
of course, to render political government
useless. . . . Wishaupt believes that to pro-
mote this perfection of the human character
was the object of Jesus Christ. . . . I believe
you will think with me that if Wishaupt had
written here, where no secrecy is necessary
in our endeavours to render men wise and
virtuous, he would not have thought of any
secret machinery for that purpose.
It should be pointed out, as an aside, that the
Bishop James Madison to whom the letter was
written wasn’t President James Madison (they
were cousins). But for a dose of extra irony, there
is actually a secret society called the Bishop
James Madison Society at William and Mary
College in Virginia. Started in 1812, it’s the second
oldest secret society on campus. The only older
one is the Flat Hat Club, to which Thomas
Jefferson belonged.

While her theory that the Illuminati (largely Jewish) world conspiracy was
the source of Bolshevism (Communism) in Russia was quickly accepted by
prominent politicians, her viral anti-Semitism was less than admired after
World War II ended. She strongly supported fascism and the Nazi persecution
of Jews and said Hitler successfully managed to stop the Jewish plan to rule
the world. Webster’s writings have influenced many conspiracists since the
1920s. She is frequently quoted by modern conspiracists who believe her
every word.
The Illuminati today: All 
things to all people
Conspiracists say the Illuminati, or something like it, still exists today, acting
as the puppet masters behind presidents, kings, banking, business, and the
United Nations. As Benjamin Franklin once said, “Three may keep a secret
when two of them are dead.” Such a conspiracy that involves hundreds of
evil geniuses is unlikely to have remained secret for all this time, yet there’s
never been a snitch.
The Illuminati has become a catchall name, a ghostly stand-in for business-
men who own too much, giant bureaucracies, and government secrecy. Over
the years, the Illuminati name badge has been pinned by conspiracists on
left-wing socialists and communists, multinational capitalists, and right-wing
political pundits. Even politicians diametrically opposed to each other on 
virtually every socio-economic level are frequently lumped together as being
“elites” who secretly think alike and are supposedly part of the Illuminati.
The Internet has only fueled the growth of this theory.
What makes the allegation of an Illuminati conspiracy for world control so
comical is that the original aim of the Illuminati wasn’t totalitarian control of
the world, but anti-Establishment revolution.
The John Birch Society’s Illuminati
The ultra-right-wing John Birch Society did much to resurrect the specter 
of the Illuminati in the 1960s and pin its tail to the backside of Communism.
The society’s founder, Indianapolis candy manufacturer Robert F. Welch,
believed everything he read in John Robison’s and Barruél’s books about the
Illuminati, the European Freemasons, and the French Revolution and con-
cluded that Adam Weishaupt’s Illuminati was the model for Marxism, Soviet-
style Communism, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the United Nations.
Welch referred to the modern Illuminati as the “Insiders” and even alleged in
his book, The Politician, that World War II general and republican president
Dwight D. Eisenhower was an insider working for the Communists. Gary
216
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Allen’s 1964 book, None Dare Call It Conspiracy, was widely promoted by the
Society, and it laid out a supposed roadmap of the modern Illuminati, com-
bined with the financing of the Rockefellers and the Rothschild banking family.
The book certainly struck a chord in America by selling 7 million copies.
Dan Brown’s Illuminati
Dan Brown, like many authors, resurrected the Illuminati as little more than
boogeymen for his first Robert Langdon novel, Angels & Demons. Using the
Illuminati allowed Brown to engage his characters in Enlightenment-style 
dialogues about the supremacy of science over religion. In the end (stop here
if you haven’t read the novel), it turns out that the mysterious head of the
Illuminati, Janus, has perpetrated a hoax and resurrected the name of the
Order as a diversionary tactic to hide his own individual treachery. It’s a
favorite Brown tactic — use the bad guy to spout your most controversial
ideas, so you have a back-door escape hatch.
“The brotherhood of the Illuminati is also factual,” says Dan Brown in his
“Author’s Note” in Angels & Demons. Not the way he wrote it, it isn’t.
Brown’s fictional Illuminati was supposed to have been a group of scientists
who rebelled secretly against church dogma in the 1500s. According to 
his story, scientists who failed to knuckle under to church teachings and
demands were arrested, tortured, and branded on the chest with a superspe-
cial branding iron identifying them as members of the subversive group, 
and their bodies pitched into the streets of Rome as a warning. According to
Brown, astronomer Galileo Galilee was a member, and they met secretly 
in an underground Church of the Illumination. Eventually, in the 1600s, this
Illuminati became dedicated to the toppling of the church and Christianity
itself. They became Satanists and were referred to as Shaitan — the Islamic
word for Satan — by the Catholic Church. Breathlessly, Langdon describes
them as the “world’s oldest and most powerful satanic cult.”
Brown even gave this Illuminati a spiffy logo, a clever bit of calligraphy that
spells out their name, which looks identical upside down or right side up. 
Far from being an artifact from history, this “ambigram” as Brown calls it, is
an invention of his friend, artist John Langdon, whose name he attached to
his fictional hero Robert Langdon in gratitude.
Brown uses a clever device in his books, dressing up old, secret, and often
fictional societies to get in his licks against the church. The history of the
Catholic Church’s activities is long, exciting, and sad enough without Brown
exaggerating it to an absurd degree. And one thing is for certain: The one
thing the real Illuminati was not was satanic.

Texe Marrs, ZOG, and the Illuminati
Former U.S. Air Force officer turned evangelical minister, Texe Marrs 
(no relation to conspiracy author and fellow Texan Jim Marrs) preaches a
message of end-times prophecy, combined with anti-Semitic, ZOG (Zionist
Occupied Government), and Illuminati obsession. He is one of the most 
prolific anti-Semitic conspiracists in America, and believes that the U.S. 
government is little more than a willing puppet of Israel. His bewildering pile
of books, DVDs, CDs, tapes, newsletters, and other merchandise, along 
with a weekly radio show broadcast via shortwave, covers everything from

David Icke’s version of the Illuminati
Former British soccer player, self-proclaimed Messiah, and professional 
conspiracist David Icke has concocted his own theory of the Illuminati, and
they aren’t of this earth. It’s probably true that Ickes has done more than any
other conspiracy author to promote the concept of an all-controlling cabal of
elites who are working secretly behind the scenes to dominate the world.
Icke believes the Illuminati are actually several races of alien reptiles who 
live underground, and who can change their outward shape to resemble
humans. Icke claims these alien Illuminati make up the British royal family,
the Rothschild banking family, the family of both Bush presidents, the
Freemasons, the Jews, and country singer Boxcar Willie, among many 
others. For more about Icke’s unusual theory, see Chapter 16.

T
his chapter opens with the facts on the most sinister of secret societies,
the ones that specialize in assassination. The very word assassin comes
from one of the oldest of these dark brotherhoods, the “Assassins,” a brutal
and bizarre cult that existed a thousand years ago in the Near East. It’s not
quite so distant as it sounds; the Crusader knights of Europe ended up on a
collision course with them, which fixed the Assassins in the mythology of
Western civilization. They were called assassins, or originally the hashasshim,
because they liked to smoke enough hashish beforehand to get themselves in
just the right mood to go out and kill the targets they’d been given by their
overlord, the Old Man of the Mountain.
From the Middle Ages, the chapter explores the world’s other murderous
secret societies, as they changed in response to the world around them. By
the 19th century, secret societies with a murderous purpose were generally
less inclined to be religious cults, and more likely to be politically or idealisti-
cally motivated, although their victims were just as dead as those of ten 
centuries before.
The 20th century added more elements to the mix, but the effectiveness of
inspiring fear in the enemy by the use of ruthless bloodshed, without pausing
to spare the innocent, remained the same. Greed combined with the rivalry
between gangs to give birth to the infamous secret society of the 1940s 
called Murder, Incorporated. Other 20th-century fraternities of terror, like the
Ku Klux Klan, were based on the most deadly scourge of that century — race
hatred. And with the dawn of the 21st century, religious terrorism has taken
center stage again, featuring secret societies like Al-Qaeda, that resemble
nothing so much as the Assassins of ten centuries ago.

The Ancient Brotherhoods of Death
The idea of a secret society whose members are “killers for the cause” is a
very old one, with a variety of types. Yet even in ancient times such a thing
was unusual, and unnerving, because it involved such intense fanaticism.
Most developed ancient societies were more ruthlessly sophisticated and
shrewd than that.
In ancient Rome, for example, the streets were ruled by the mob, and the
mob was ruled by the gangs. The most violent and enterprising of the gang
leaders were usually in the pocket of a particular senator. Generally, the
gangs were used to get out the vote, by intimidation, if necessary. And if the
senator wished to be rid of someone of the opposition, he used gang leaders
as hired assassins. But this wasn’t strictly their purpose.
Still, the idea of a secret society devoted to assassination is even older than
the Assassins, and more common than it’s comfortable to think. Following is
simply a selection, an enlightening list of the most famous, or infamous,
assassins.
The Sicarii
The Sicarii were a secret society of Jewish assassins in the time of Christ. 
As with so many other bands of assassins, the Sicarii achieved the blind
devotion of their membership with a toxic blend of religious fanaticism and
political mania.
The Latin for a dagger is sicarius, and Sicarii literally means “men who wield 
a dagger.” The term is also used for a kind of gladiator in the arena of Rome,
because gladiators were named by the type of weapon they carried.
Julius Caesar had been a great friend and admirer of the Jews, giving them 
a cozy period as a client state to the Roman Empire, in Judea. It was ruled by
the puppet Hasmonean dynasty of Jewish kings and queens, who had more
privileges than most of Rome’s conquered provinces. But the relationship
between the Jews and their conquerors (the Romans were at the end of a
long line of them, including the Babylonians, the Assyrians, and the Seleucid
Greeks) began to sour rather badly in the next century.
This new bitterness grew out of two forces: the Zealots and the Sicarii:
 The Zealots were the Far Right political party in Judea. The modern-day
word zealot, for someone who is blinded by their ideology, comes 
from here.
 The Sicarii were a secret society made up of Zealots, no longer content
with just starting riots against the Roman occupation.
220
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

The Sicarii were determined to start a bloody rebellion, and did so in part by
assassinating anyone of the other parties that they labeled as “Hellenized,”
meaning they’d been influenced by or were somewhat sympathetic to the
Roman overlords. The Sicarii finally got their doomsday scenario in 68 AD,
when the Roman legions, sick of all the violence, invaded the difficult
province — the first of three long wars that annihilated the nation and 
dispersed the Jews across the face of the earth.
Devoted Jews were horrified at how willing the Sicarii were to spill blood
even on the Temple Mount, the site of the holiest shrine in Jerusalem,
Solomon’s Temple. But it was too tempting, in the crowds that mobbed the
place during a religious festival, to be able to get in, kill the target, then 
disappear into the crowd, for the Sicarii to pass it by simply out of reverence.
As long as the blood that was spilled was that of a Roman or a Roman 
sympathizer, real or perceived, the Sicarii were just fine with it.
A band of Sicarii most likely arranged the final dramatic stage of revolt from
the cliff-top city of Masada, leading the rebels in mass suicide rather than 
surrender. They didn’t call them Zealots for nothing. When the Romans
caught one of them and tortured him, the historian Josephus said that their
“courage, or whether we ought to call it madness, or hardiness in their 
opinions, everybody was amazed at.” He goes on chillingly to say that even
Sicarii children, when tortured, wouldn’t recognize Caesar as their sovereign.
Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus Christ, was probably a 
Sicarii —Iscariot is easily translated as a Latinized version of sicarius, meaning
“one of the Sicarii.” So much for following Jesus’ advice of “rendering unto
Caesar what is Caesar’s, and unto God what is God’s.”
After Judea was in ashes, the Sicarii hotfooted it to Alexandria in Egypt,
where there was a very large Jewish population, and attempted to get them
to revolt, too. The Jews of the city replied by putting all the Sicarii they could
lay hands on to death. The rest were captured by the authorities one by 
one, and soon disappeared from the stage of history.
The Assassins
The Crusades, which began in the late 11th century, established four small
nations in the Holy Land, called the “Latin” or the “Crusader” states, or even
by their own French name for it — Outremer. They lasted two centuries, 
from about 1098 until the fall of the city of Acre, the last Crusader stronghold,
in 1291. Meanwhile, the founder of the Assassins in Persia established a 
separate colony of Assassins, with their own “Old Man of the Mountain,” in
Syria. It was here, on the border between the Latin State of Antioch and Syria,
that the explosive contact between the two was made, and the legend of the
Assassins was born in the West.
221
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

Hassan as Sabbah
The Assassins were founded around 1090 AD by an Ismaili imam and holy man
named Hassan as Sabbah, a name with many and various spellings, but a sin-
gular ability to strike fear into the heart of both East and West. (An imam is a
holy leader, to Shiites, one chosen by God.) By the time Hassan was through,
powerful kings as far away as Britain and France and the Holy Roman Empire
quivered in their shoes at the thought of ending up a target of the Assassin
leader who was called “the Old Man of the Mountain” by the Christians,
derived from his Arabic title Shaykh al Jabal, the Prince of the Mountain.
The first of these princes, Hassan, was born in Persia (Iran) in 1056 to a family
of “Twelver” Shiites, the dominant sect of Shiite Islam, but he later converted
to Ismailism, a smaller and more mystical, esoteric form of Shiite Islam that
was just about to have its greatest flowering in history; the Fatamid Dynasty
that ruled Egypt at this time was Ismaili.
Hassan left his homeland to be educated at the university in the new capital 
of Cairo. The city, and its famous college, had been founded by the Fatamids,
who ruled Egypt, North Africa, and parts of Saudi Arabia from the 10th to the
12th century. Soon Cairo rivaled Baghdad as the intellectual center of Islam. 
It was there, at the Al-Azhar University (which still exists and is one of the
oldest universities in the world), that Hassan learned the secret rituals of the
nine levels to the attainment of enlightenment, as well as mystical and occult
secrets of other beliefs, from Kabbalism to Neoplatonism.
At the time of Hassan, the majority of the world’s Muslims were Sunnis, as
they are today. The split between Sunni and Shiite began as a dynastic argu-
ment over who would follow the Prophet Mohammed. Later it degenerated
into other arguments, one of them being that Shiite sects are often more 
oriented to mysticism, ecstatic faith, and divine revelation than are Sunni
Muslims.
Eventually Hassan left the university and set out to form his own Ismaili sect,
actively seeking followers, which he found on his journey back to Persia. He
made his sect’s new home in a magnificent mountain fortress called Alamut,
famous for its gardens, its libraries, and its inaccessibility to an invading army.
Hassan liked the mystical number of seven, and so instituted seven ritual
levels to admission, similar to those he learned in Cairo. In an amazingly brief
time he became a real power in Iran. Hassan’s sect would one day be called
“Nizari Islam.” Like the parent Ismaili sect itself, Nizari arose out of a disagree-
ment over the line of the caliphate.
The Fatimid Dynasty ended and the Nizari sect was born in the same event —
the death of the eighth Fatamid caliph, al-Mustansir, in 1094. His elder son,
named Nizar, was to follow him. But he was in Alexandria when his father
died, and a powerful clique in the military double-crossed him. Their leader,
General Al-Afdar, decided that Nizar’s younger brother, Mustali, would be a lot
easier to handle. So he married off his daughter to Mustali, and then hustled
him onto the throne.
222
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

This raised a clamor all over the Muslim world, and many important men
refused to accept Mustali as caliph. Of these, the most important was Hassan
as Sabbah. Thus he became the spiritual father of “Nizari” Islam. Hassan
would have his vengeance fairly soon and in the fashion that made him
famous. In 1130, as the Fatamids grew ever weaker, an Assassin sent out from
Alamut killed the son of Mustali, al-Amir, in the name of al-Nizar.
Ismailism
Of course, the Nizaris were only the latest sect at the end of a very, very long
line. At the time Hassan founded the Assassins, the Near East was an over-
heated stewpot, with wars large and small, religious and political, boiling
over everyplace. You had the major and minor Islamic sects, the Christians,
the mighty Seljuq Empire of newly-converted Sunni Turks, the Jews, the
pagan Mongols, the Druze, important sects of Gnostic Christians, and all the
various military orders, kings, and warlords of both Islam and Christianity.
Still, Hassan managed to come up with something fresh. In his new sect of
Ismailism, Hassan became an imam with the unquestioned loyalty of his fol-
lowers, who believed him to be holy and infallible. He would live into his 90s,
never again leaving the mountain fastness of Alamut, and in that time he fash-
ioned this secret society in his own image.
Playing mind games
For Hassan, one of the most important aspects of the faith was the willing-
ness to both kill and die in Allah’s service, without question. He invented tac-
tics that gave to him the absolute, blind devotion of his followers. Hassan had
an entire bagful of tricks he used for this, many of which are used in the reli-
gious cults of today. He liked to get recruits young to make a bigger impact.
He moved the best recruits into Alamut, cutting them off from any friends or
family who might contaminate them with the teeming outside world of other
beliefs. And he liked to play mind games on them; this became an Assassin
trademark.
According to legends, when the Old Man felt that a candidate was just about
ready to be sent out on a mission, he had the man drugged into unconscious-
ness. The candidate awoke to find himself in the private gardens of Alamut.
Milk, spring water, and even wine, which was forbidden in their daily life,
flowed from various fountains, surrounded by every sort of greenery and
flower imaginable. The garden was also filled with beautiful and really
friendly women, who would spend the next three days introducing this young
man, born in poverty and accustomed to an incredibly grim life, to every sort
of sensual pleasure imaginable. These accommodating ladies would feed the
young man honey cakes, pouring him as much wine as he could hold, and
basically drop grapes into his mouth like something out of an old Warner
Brothers’ cartoon.
223
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

When he awoke once more, the candidate found himself in the receiving hall,
on the floor before the Old Man of the Mountain. When he was asked where
he’d been, he replied that he’d been in Paradise. Small wonder. Then Hassan
promised him that, if he fulfilled his mission, and if he were killed, he would
spend eternity in that pleasure garden. Especially considering the harshness
of everyday life in the desert, its little wonder they agreed to give up their
lives in the cause without question.
Hassan played a lot of other tricks, as well, to prove to his followers that he
had a personal pipeline to Allah, like the Jim Jones of medieval Persia. One
favorite was to place a follower into a hole in the floor of the receiving cham-
ber. Then, with only his head exposed above the floor, Hassan placed a large
platter that had been cut in two on either side of his neck. They splashed
some animal blood all over it, and then called in the troops. When the head
spoke, answering Hassan’s questions about what life was like in Paradise, the
whole room was awestruck. Of course, after the room was cleared, Hassan
was left with one small annoyance. So the man was then pulled out of the
hole in the floor and beheaded, his head hung on a spike outside the
entrance to the hall, as a reminder that Hassan had the divine power to call
back the dead to speak.
The position of the Old Man of the Mountain passed from father to son. Of
course, Hassan couldn’t pass the office on to a son, because he’d had them
both murdered, but never mind that. The rule held after his death.
Assassin methods and targets
The terrifying part about the Assassins was that they’d put out a hit on 
anybody who crossed them, of any kingdom or faith. The even scarier part
was that they weren’t striking goatherds and milkmaids, or even the petty
nobility — they were killing imams and kings, princes and potentates, anyone
perceived as an enemy of their faith who was high enough to be worth the
bother. That was Hassan’s motto — whenever possible, don’t fight the 
whole army, just kill the king or general leading it. Sometimes, just the threat
was enough.
One Seljuk sultan who put Alamut under siege awoke to find a dagger stuck in
the ground beside his bed. A messenger arrived and said that had the Old
Man of the Mountain wanted him dead, the dagger wouldn’t be in the hard
ground, but rather buried in his soft breast. The Turks all went home.
The Assassins didn’t like the Christians any better. Their first Christian 
victim was a powerful and respected figure, Raymond II, count of Tripoli.
Soon after came Conrad of Montferrat, king of Jerusalem. Though some said
the Assassins were paid by King Richard the Lion-Heart, it was more likely
revenge for Conrad’s attack on Assassin shipping. But this sort of thing was
still shocking to royal sensibilities, particularly in the way it was done.
224
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

The Assassins always wore white, and struck with their sacred golden (and
sometimes poisoned) dagger. They liked to hit their target in a very public
place; they especially liked the emotional shock of killing a victim in a church
or mosque. No one was above an Assassin blade — the young Prince Edward,
later the mighty King Edward I of England, was nearly killed by a poisoned
Assassin’s dagger in 1271 when he was on crusade, simply because he made
overtures of peace to the Assassins’ deadliest enemy, the Mongols. This is
why the Assassins struck fear into royal hearts as far away as Europe.
It wasn’t just the Crusaders and their fiercest warriors, the Knights Templar,
who ended up by calling the game a draw where the Assassins were con-
cerned. The other figure of Crusader myth, Saladin, the greatest general the
Islamic world has ever known, was also checkmated by the Assassins. Saladin
was a Kurd and a devout Sunni who defeated both the Christians and Fatamid
Egypt. But when he attempted to conquer the Assassins of Syria, he was
undone. After three nearly successful attempts on his life, Saladin came to an
agreement with the Assassins and just went around them, like everyone else
in the East at that time.
225
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death
Prince Aly Khan: Holy man, ladies’ man
Back in the 1940s and 1950s, it was still possible
to put “International Playboy” down as a legiti-
mate job description, even though they were
already something of a dying breed. One of the
last and most famous was Prince Aly Khan, hus-
band to movie star Rita Hayworth, premier
sportsman and horseracing fanatic, lady-killer
extraordinaire. He married twice and had affairs
with just about every big-name actress and
socialite of the day, becoming one of the hottest
sex symbols in the world. Unfortunately, he
wasn’t Euro-trash joke royalty — he was a direct
descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, spiritual
leader to the world’s 20 million or so Nizari
Muslims, who count the Old Man of the
Mountain as their founder. His father was the
“Agha Khan,” titled in both Britain and India, the
imam of the Nizaris.
The prince’s conservative father was rather put
out with Aly’s dissolute life (though Aly Khan was
a war hero and later a permanent delegate to the
UN), and so passed him over for the succession,
naming Aly’s young son Karim, who’s the present
Aga Khan. What’s really weird about all this is
that Rita Hayworth and Aly Khan had a daughter,
the lovely American Princess Yasmin Aga Khan.
Thank God she never decided to go into the
movies like her mother. In a faith that consider-
ers any representation of the Prophet or his
immediate family to be heresy and apostasy, one
can only imagine the Islamic reaction to Yasmin
tap-dancing her way through My Gal Sal, or
Tonight and Every Night. Or worse, stripteasing
her way through Gilda or Salome.
Aly Khan loved fast cars, fast horses, and fast
women; the fast cars killed him in an auto acci-
dent in Paris in 1959. Karim Aga Khan is still the
Nizari imam. It’s a shame he doesn’t have more
power in the Muslim world, due to his commit-
ment to modernization, peace, equality, and an
end to poverty. His faith, grace, intelligence, and
commitment are something that the new nutcase
president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, could
really learn from. The Imam has spent his life as
a very effective ambassador for Islamic archi-
tecture and culture.

Yet, the Assassins finally endured two fatal blows in the 13th century — the
Mongols overran and destroyed most of the fortress of Alamut, and in 1273
the Mamluks, who also defeated the Crusaders, did the same to the Syrian
Assassins in Masyaf. Surviving Assassins wandered for a time, trying to hold
their identity together. Some even hired out their skills to their Mamluk con-
querors. But their real survival came with carrying Nizari Islam underground,
hiding in Iran disguised as everything from tailors to Sufi Muslim mystics.
It’s probable that the success of their underground network can be seen
today, in the fact that Iran is the only nation of the East to be overwhelmingly
Shiite. They finally reappeared openly in the 19th century to claim their right
to a spiritual identity (see the nearby sidebar “Prince Aly Khan: Holy man,
ladies’ man”).
The Thugs
The Thugs, or the more proper Indian plural, Thugee, were a secret sect of
criminal assassins in India, going back at least to the 14th century.
The word thag means “thief” in Hindi. The modern-day word thug, for your
basic, low-life, violent criminal, comes from here.
The Thugs were extremely organized, with bands scattered all over India, 
but bound together by their fraternity. The leader of each band was called
the jamaadaar. They all worshipped the goddess Kali, and had their own ter-
minology and signs of recognition. But beyond that, don’t confuse the Thugs
with anyone like the Assassins or the Sicarii (covered earlier in this chapter),
who at least had some sort of idealistic purpose for their ritual killings. The
Thugs fully earned their name because they were killers for one thing only,
and that was money. They haunted the roads of India for centuries, cozying
up to travelers, making them feel at ease, before they murdered them and
stole all their belongings. The bodies were then buried, or, if there was a
reason to hurry, dumped into a well or pit.
Yet, it was all done according to their own bizarre ritual; even the pickaxe, 
or kussee, a tool for digging graves, was sacred to them. The group was
extremely superstitious, and used all sorts of signs and omens to determine
which fork to take in the road, which person to attack, and so on. The Thugs
who picked up victims on the rivers, claiming to be on pilgrimage, were
called Bungoos. Prayers, incantations, and the burning of Indian brown sugar,
called jaggery, were all a part of the post-assassination ritual.
Thug rituals and weapons
The initiation of a new candidate was tedious and time consuming on two
counts: first, because it usually took years of tagalong status to become a 
full-fledged Thug, and second, because the ceremony made a college 
commencement look hurried.
226
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Dressed in white, wearing a crown of flowers, the initiate was presented to 
all the various jamaadaars, with long ritual prayers by the guru. Then they
went outside, and the jamaadaars sat down in a circle with the initiate in the
middle, and waited for some sort of omen. And waited. And waited. It could
be anything, a rising wind, a falling bird, a clap of thunder or a passing
animal, to show Kali’s blessing on the ceremony. Then they headed back
inside for a feast.
Their weapon of choice was called a rumaal, from the Sikh word for a turban
or headdress, often yellow, a sacred color to Kali. But the Thugee had a more
practical use for it. A coin, or more than one coin, was placed in its folds,
lending the cloth the necessary weight to be whipped quickly around the
target’s neck, where it was used with practiced skill to strangle the victim.
This is sometimes called a garrote.
English royalty was honorably beheaded in the old days. But in the Muslim
East, those of the royal blood were usually garroted. Beheading was deemed
a demeaning death for the worst sort of low-born scum. Later on, in the 18th
century, Western seamen imprisoned and enslaved by the Islamic Barbary
states of North Africa were usually beheaded when executed, as a sign of
their lowly status, although they were occasionally burned or crucified.
The goddess Kali
Thugs were drawn from both the Muslim and the Hindu communities, but
ultimately the original faith of a Thug didn’t matter, because induction into
the society entailed the worship of the Thugee goddess, Kali, also called
Bhowanee.
Many peaceful Hindus worshipped Kali, even though she was a goddess 
that symbolized annihilation in the original Hindu pantheon. Kali has worn
many faces over the centuries in the complex Hindu religion, including that 
of a typical earth-mother goddess. But the Thugs formed their own sort of
breakaway sect, in which the goddess not only forgave their murderous 
thievery, but blessed them for it. Very convenient. After the Thugee became
an institution, membership often passed from father to son. They also got
new recruits, as in the mythology about the Romany “gypsies” of Europe, 
by kidnapping and raising the children of their victims.
Destruction of the Thugs
Estimates of how many deaths were on the hands of the Thugee range far and
wide, anywhere from 100,000 to 2 million over the course of their existence.
But the fact is that they got out of hand, and the British Raj in India finally
decided that something had to be done about it.
The term raj means “rule” in Hindi, and the British Raj is the name commonly
given to the British Empire in India.
227
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

When one Lord William Cavendish-Bentinck became Governor General of
India in 1828, he declared war on the Thugee. He used all the modern 
methods, including a sort of witness protection program, offering immunity
to Thugs who testified in court against their former brethren. Soon a 
whole police bureau popped up called the Thuggee and Dacoity (bandit)
Department. It was incredibly efficient, and the destruction of the Thugee
was reputed to be complete by the 1870s. The end of their reign of terror
helped secure for Britain a great deal of Indian loyalty.
Yet, the legend of the Thugee lives on, in everything from Indiana Jones
movies to computer games. British and Anglo-Indian authors like Kipling and
Conan Doyle incorporated the strange sect into some of their stories, and the
legend was born. Although aspects of the cult, like their glassy-eyed devotion
to the “bloodthirsty” goddess Kali would be overplayed in the West, the 
Thug image as the most murderous secret society of all time is really a fair
statement.
The ninjas
Ninjas were Japan’s original “Men in Black.” Of course, it’s only myth and 
supposition that always dresses them in black — the main thing a ninja
assassin was trained to do was to blend in with his surroundings until he
found the moment to strike. But because the favorite time for a ninja raid was
the middle of the night, it’s not unlikely that they were often dressed in the
famous black karate-style jacket and pants, with a long black cloth belt, and a
black cowl covering their faces up to the eyes. They even wore black tabi, the
classic Japanese socks with a special purse for the big toe, to fit into their
straw sandals.
But in their day, ninja were famous for wearing disguises, dressed as anything
from a monk to a beggar to an enemy guard, so long as they blended in,
unseen.
Origin of historical ninjas
The height of the period of the historical ninjas was from the mid-1400s 
to the mid-1600s. Most were trained in two particular areas of Japan, Iga and
Koga, in which whole villages were devoted, apart from the usual fishing and
agriculture, to the training and hiring out of ninjas.
Schools were there that trained promising young men from childhood. Very
often these skills were passed from father to son, until whole families became
famous ninjutsu, which means practitioners of the art of stealth. These 
highly skilled specialists were also called shinobi in Japanese. By the late 15th
century, they weren’t only master assassins, but also spies, or sekko, adept at
all forms of espionage.
228
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

As it was in Europe, this was a period in Japan when powerful Japanese 
warlords, called daimyos, were battling it out for supremacy with one another
in order to achieve the title of “shogun,” a warrior dictator. Ninjas would’ve
been an essential tool. That’s what makes it so surprising that, as far as social
status is concerned, the ninja was near the bottom.
Again, this would’ve been a bias recognizable to Europeans of the same
period. Like a chivalrous knight, the samurai warrior lived by a code, called
bushido, “the way of the warrior.” The samurai, or “servants to the lord,” were
of the nobility, far above the common Japanese foot soldier in status. Spying,
assassinating, and lurking around dark corners were absolutely beneath
them. So, with the same easily compartmentalized ethics of a knight, they
hired somebody else to do it for them. Consequently, no matter how skilled,
the ninja was still a paid mercenary. (We don’t even know how much he was
paid, because the whole subject was so distasteful to the samurai.)
Ninja tactics and weapons
Ninjas are now a great favorite of teenage boys, and these kids are right
about one thing — ninjas rock. They created staggeringly clever devices to
aid them in intelligence gathering and sneak attacks. For example, they used
a miniature ear horn, called a saoto hikigane, which could be placed against 
a wall in order to hear conversations on the other side, including of guards,
to determine their movements before attempting to get inside. Everything a
ninja carried had to be portable, and the great ninja masters developed
advanced tools of their trade. More than any other early sect of assassins,
these guys were the 16th-century James Bonds.
This business of climbing over and through castle walls like invading ants
was something for which the ninjas were famous. Some of the items that
could be found in the black kit bag hanging from a ninja’s belt, or wrapped
around his shoulders on a holster, are as follows:
 A climbing rope with a grappling hook, or even a portable climbing
ladder of rope with an iron hook, to be tossed up a castle wall
 A clever, hinged saw, as well as other cutting tools, that could be quietly
used to cut their way through wood or plaster walls
 A small lacquered box with several compartments called an inro, a 
medicine box, containing first-aid potions for the wounded, or poisons
for intended victims
Many weapons could also be found there, including:
 Ninja “stars”: Hand-sized pointed metal projectiles to be thrown like
murderous Frisbees.
 Tetsu bishi: Could be tossed on the floor in front of an enemy in pursuit.
They always landed with a sharp point up — samurai wore thin-soled
shoes, and this was a great way to slow down a pursuer.
229
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

 Katana: A ninja’s most important weapon — his sword. A katana was
razor-sharp but slightly flexible, to help parry the blows of an opponent.
Even this was also used as a tool; a ninja finding his way in the dark
could extend the scabbard of his sword outward, and then hold the
entire thing in his teeth to help him feel his way along. Should he
encounter an enemy, it was an easy matter to knock the scabbard off
and lunge with the sword in the dark.
 Kusarigama: A devilish device, miniaturized from common farming
tools. It was a chain with a heavy ball on one end and a sharp sickle on
the other. They practiced with it endlessly, like a gaucho with a whip,
until they could fling the ball to strike a pursuer, preferably wrapping
around his leg. Then they could pull an enemy off his feet, retrieve the
sickle end in a flash, and make the kill. They also carried a smaller auxil-
iary knife in a scabbard.
 Explosives: Come in many shapes and sizes. The matchlock guns of the
period were rarely used by them, but ninjas were masters at using 
black powder.
Sometimes during a battle, a ninja’s chief task was to set fire to the enemy
warlord’s compound. Small explosives could come in handy for this. A larger
bomb might contain black powder packed tightly into a clay pot or metal
cylinder, the powder salted with shards of metal and glass to do the utmost
shrapnel damage. They also used small, paper-wrapped bombs, almost like
grenades, particularly to frighten or scatter people rather than to kill. And
how did they light these things? In those days, before the invention of the
sulfur match, small tinderboxes were used, striking metal on flint with pieces
of an oil-soaked rag at the box bottom, which could take a whole lot of
tedious tries in order to get a spark. Ninjas carried with them pieces of smol-
dering cord in a clever lacquered and weatherproof box.
Yes, they looked a little like members of a SWAT team when they headed out
for a job. But part of their deadly skill came in dexterity and familiarity with
their tools and weapons, as well as intelligence about their target. For exam-
ple, when they had to get across a castle moat, they invented collapsible,
portable boats or rafts. Another incredibly clever device was a pair of “water
spiders,” round rings of wood that would float, like balsa, with thick pieces of
rope to attach a footpad at the center. The ninja then used it to virtually walk
across the water of the moat, smoothly and silently.
Separating myth from fact
With such an incredible array of skills, it’s not surprising that myths of the
ninja arose ascribing to them all sorts of magical powers, like being able 
to fly across rooms or turn themselves into a flying weapon. They must have
almost seemed to be flying to anyone who watched a ninja raid and survived
to tell the tale. Among the many skills they practiced was the art of gymnas-
tics and acrobatics, and they often quickly and silently launched themselves
up into human pyramids to get over walls. They even used spears to 
230
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

pole-vault over ravines or obstacles. They tossed ropes between buildings,
and then shimmied across with their hands and feet like bats hanging 
upside down.
It’s easy to see why ninjas required so much training. They learned every-
thing, from the proper way to don disguises and blend in, to how to stay
underwater for hours at a stretch and breathe through a reed. Of course, 
warlords did try to guard themselves. They built ninjaproof homes, with
things like stairwells that could be collapsed, or hiding holes, or even
“nightingale floors,” where the wood was fashioned with air pockets that
made it sing whenever anyone walked across it, warning the intended victim.
The ninjas died out in Japan after the late 1600s. Several forces contributed
to this, the most important being the rise in 1638 of the Tokugawa Shogunate.
Japan experienced two and a half centuries of peace, during which the 
skills of the ninjas weren’t required. They eventually were blended into the
shogun’s army. And so they fell into the obscurity of a Japanese legend 
virtually unknown here until the last few decades. Of course, nowadays the
once obscure ninja are a staple of computer games and Japanese anime, as
well as manga, popular graphic novels named after the Japanese word for
comic strips. (See Manga For Dummies by Kensuke Okabayashi.)
Murder, Incorporated
Secret societies of murderers aren’t only the stuff of ancient times. In fact,
with Murder, Incorporated, they became as modern and streamlined and 
capitalistic as any business on Wall Street.
Lepke Buchalter was the only major mob boss to ever go to the electric chair,
and it was Murder, Incorporated that put him there. This very secret society
existed all through the 1930s and ’40s, acting as a firm of murder-for-hire hit
men for the mob as well as other clients. The colorful name was hung on 
this guild by the newspapers; within the Mafia, it was referred to as “the
Combination.”
Its founding is shrouded in mystery, though it was probably set up by Bugsy
Siegel and Meyer Lansky, the two Jewish mobsters who were close friends 
of Mafioso Lucky Luciano, whose enforcers ran the show. Later both men
drifted into other work, principally setting up gambling for the mob, and the
underboss in charge of the Combination became Louis “Lepke” Buchalter,
who was a chief liaison for assignments from “the Commission,” which was
the name Lucky Luciano had given to the governing board of the Five Mafia
Families of New York (see Chapter 14 for more info).
231
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

Lepke is a diminutive of Lepkeleh, which means “little Louis” in Yiddish, and
it was the nickname Lepke’s beloved mother had given him. Ah, a boy who
loves his mother!
Buchalter was the most ruthless of the short-lived but powerful “Jewish
Mafia” of 1940’s New York that often worked hand-in-glove with the real
Italian Mafia. Lepke’s biggest going concern was labor racketeering — he
practically invented it. While others were making the usual mob bucks on
booze, gambling, and prostitution, Lepke was muscling in on labor unions,
forming his own army of scabs who could be hired by either side in a labor
dispute. The number of murders he committed or ordered is staggering;
Lepke had everything but a conscience.
Murder, Incorporated was a going concern, with many a mobster picking up
extra money freelancing for Lepke; he liked to send men far from their home
city to do the job, where they weren’t known.
As well as the Combination, this secret society was often called “the
Brownsville Boys” by insiders, because its two most trusted and efficient 
hit-men were from Brownsville in Brooklyn — Martin “Bugsy” Goldstein and
Abe “Kid Twist” Reles. High or low, famous or infamous, it didn’t matter to
these two natural-born killers. If the blood was bought and paid for, you were
a dead man.
232
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 
Have you seen Judge Crater?
In 1930, there was a very famous disappearance
of a member of the NY State Supreme Court
named Judge Crater, “the Missingest Man in
New York.” You may have heard of him before.
Somehow, his name became a national joke for
five decades whenever someone was missing, a
staple of stand-up comics from the Catskills to
The Tonight Show. Conspiracy theorists have
even speculated he was a victim of alien abduc-
tion — in the film Close Encounters of the Third
Kind, during the scene near the end when miss-
ing people are pouring off the alien ship, some
guy is standing there by a board full of pictures,
crossing them off one by one as each appears.
One of the pictures is of Judge Crater. However,
his disappearance is far more likely to have been
the work of Abe Reles. After all, Crater’s mistress
went missing later that same year. It seems
doubtful that the aliens came back to get her
because the judge was pining.
In 2005, a letter turned up written 50 years before
by the wife of Robert Good, one of Reles’s paid
killers, disclosing that Judge Crater had been
killed and buried under the boardwalk at Coney
Island. Bones had indeed been found at that
location in the 1950s, but were never identified.
They were quickly reburied in Potters Field, a
mass grave for the poor.

Unfortunately for Lepke, he ended up in the determined gun sites of the most
successful and ambitious of all “mob-busting” federal attorneys, Thomas
Dewey, who would one day be governor of New York. Despite so much blood
on his hands, Lepke went down for only one murder — that of a man named
Joe Rosen, a candy store owner who’d once been a trucker, driven out of
business by Lepke’s takeover of the N.Y. Teamsters. Rosen had sworn his
revenge on Lepke. Despite the mobster’s warnings, Rosen decided to rat him
out to Dewey. Lepke ordered his Brownsville Boys to kill Rosen, one of
dozens of such crimes. But this order was heard by two people that Dewey
talked into turning state’s evidence: Albert Tannenbaum and Abe Reles. Both
were hit men. But the jury believed them, sentencing Lepke to the chair, as
well as his two closest Murder, Inc., associates, Mendy Weiss and Louis
Capone (no relation to Al Capone).
There was a little justice for the two rat/hit men. Alfred Tannenbaum ended
up testifying at several mob trials, after which he was banned from U.S. soil
as part of his deal. He died in 1976. As for his fellow stool pigeon, when the
really creepy Abe Reles decided to sing, prosecutors couldn’t quite believe
what they were hearing. They had in their hands the most feared, ruthless,
and conscience-free hit man in the business.
A gun was far too impersonal for Reles; his favorite weapon was an ice pick
driven through the victim’s ear into his brain. He got so good at it that the
coroner mistakenly labeled several of these hits a cerebral hemorrhage. Reles
liked to kill for the sheer joy of it — he once murdered a car wash employee
for leaving a smudge on his fender. Prosecutors, though repelled by him,
were forced to protect him for the prospect of breaking up Murder, Inc., for-
ever. But this was long before the witness protection program, and despite
being under heavy guard, Abe Reles “fell” from a hotel window on Coney
Island in 1941. It wasn’t exactly a shock when it was uncovered many years
later that the cops guarding him had been paid a hefty bribe to look the other
way, probably by Frank Costello, head of the Genovese family. Reles became
known in history as “the canary who could sing but couldn’t fly.” Yet, there
was one victory, because when the supposedly “untouchable” boss Lepke
ended up sitting on “Old Sparky,” Murder, Inc. was history.
Hate Group Assassins
Anyone who kills is someone who hates, right? Well, not exactly. As the sto-
ries above about thugs and ninjas relate, some secret societies kill with very
little in the way of emotion. But other secret societies kill with more than a
surplus of emotion, driven by a blinding and fanatical hatred for those of
another race or another faith.
233
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
The Klan isn’t precisely a secret society of assassins. Or so the Klan says. If
you ask the remnants of the Ku Klux Klan what they do today, they’ll reply
that they simply defend the white race. But the truth is that the Klan has
been behind far too many shootings, bombings, and church burnings not to
deserve a place on the list beside the Assassins and the Thugs.
The Ku Klux Klan is a peculiarly American institution. Does that mean that
other nations don’t have secret societies based on hatred of other races? Not
at all. In fact, throughout history, whole nations have been founded on race
hatred. As for the KKK-type organizations of other countries, you’ll find a list
of some famous ones at the close of this section. Unfortunately, there are lots
to choose from.
Yet, the fact remains that the Klan is unique to America, for several reasons.
The KKK was an outgrowth of the American Civil War, and in its opening
years, it concentrated strictly on a hatred of the newest group of American
citizens, the “Free Blacks,” or former slaves freed by the war. Like some 
multiheaded monster out of a Greek myth, the Klan would be decapitated
three times, but each time it would return, different from before, but always
with the same core message of hate.
Birth of the first Klan
When the Confederacy, the union of breakaway states in the Civil War, was
defeated in April of 1865, there were a lot of Northerners who wanted to make
the South pay for starting the whole bloody mess. The defeated South was
occupied by victorious Northern troops, and many Northerners thought the
only way to treat the former enemy was to grind them under the conqueror’s
boot heel. And apart from that, one of the favorite ploys of Northerners to
humiliate the still proud Southern aristocracy was to place their former
slaves in positions of authority over them. Soon the South struck back,
mainly in the form of the underground guerrilla force called the Ku Klux Klan.
There’s some debate about how this really weird name was chosen. Most 
historians think that the name came from the Greek word kuklos, meaning
“circle,” as in a circle of brothers. The “Klan” was added later for the allitera-
tive sound of it, and also because so many of these men were of Scots-Irish
heritage and the word harked back to the Scottish clans.
According to the Klan’s version of history, their founder and first “Grand
Wizard” was the famous Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest. In real-
ity, Forrest was offered this job as an honorary position, and accepted it,
from the mysterious “six Southern gentlemen” who founded the Klan in his
234
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

home state of Tennessee. Historians aren’t certain of the identities of any of
these six men; this was a dangerous time, and making war on the Northern
occupation was a hanging offense.
The worst of all Klan punishments were reserved for anyone who ratted them
out to the authorities. That’s why they wore the hoods to begin with. Plenty
of people knew who the Klansmen really were, but maintained either an
admiring or a frightened silence. As for the ex-General Forrest, he’d taken a
stand for racial equality by 1870, and long before that had disowned the Klan
because of their use of violence and terror.
Soon the president, the former Union general Ulysses S. Grant, was forced to
declare war on the Klan. In 1871, he put through the Republican Congress
The Force Acts of 1870 and The Civil Rights Act of 1871, often called The Ku
Klux Klan Act. They gave federal troops the right to intervene when the Klan
did things like attempting to frighten newly enfranchised blacks away from
voting. They could declare martial law, if necessary, to get the job done. It
would break the back of the Reconstruction Klan.
“Birth of a Nation” and 
the rebirth of the Klan
Anyone who denies the ability of movies to affect society needs to bone up
on director D. W. Griffith and his greatest work, the 1914 film Birth of a Nation.
Unfortunately, it can be a painful film to watch, in terms of its primitive 
racial stereotypes. In Birth of a Nation, members of the Ku Klux Klan of the
post–Civil War era are portrayed as the good guys, not the bad guys. They’re
the ones who ride in at the end to save the day.
Griffith was Southern born and bred; his father had been a colonel in the
Confederate army. Like many Southerners, he was raised on stories of the
brutality of the Northern occupiers after the war. His previous films had 
been everything from westerns to Biblical epics, but it all jelled for Griffith
when he read a novel almost as influential as his film would be, called The
Clansman. It was written by Thomas Dixon as part of a trilogy of novels set 
in the South, nowadays sold as a historical document under the title The
Reconstruction Trilogy. The three novels separately are The Leopard’s Spots,
The Clansman, and The Traitor.
Dixon wasn’t a sinister character; he was a Baptist minister, a lawyer and 
legislator, and a supporter of abolition before he turned to writing. But like
Griffith, he’d inherited his ideas on race from his Southern childhood, and,
like Griffith, he’d been raised on stories of the Klan as the protectors of
defeated white Southerners. Griffith decided to film the novel The Clansman
as Birth of a Nation, and both the feature-length film and the American race
riot were born.
235
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

This wasn’t just because the film portrayed African Americans negatively —
it was because it was so good at doing it. Birth of a Nation was the first fea-
ture-length film, with a ticket price, and even an intermission, that put it on a
par with respectable stage shows. It would leave the contemptuous term
“flickers” in the dust. D. W. pulled out all the stops and used all the new tech-
niques, things people had never seen before, like close-ups, two-shots (films
previously were shot from one distant angle on one camera, just like a stage
show), cross-cutting and other editing effects to play with time, flashbacks,
and numerous other devices that we don’t even notice today; they’re simply
understood as part of the language of film. It’s a language that was, to a great
degree, invented by D. W. Griffith. This is why modern film lovers have such
conflicted feelings about Birth of a Nation — it was a giant leap forward for
film, and a giant leap backwards for race relations in America.
It’s difficult to overstate the popularity of the film when it hit. Really, only
Gone with the Wind or Star Wars can compare in terms of the number of
people who saw the film. Until long into the period of the “talkies,” the arrival
of sound in 1929, it was the highest-grossing picture of all time. But when
black Americans saw the way they were portrayed in it, as evil schemers and
rapists of White Womanhood, they began rioting from L.A. to New York, 
and from Philadelphia to Minneapolis. Many cities refused to play it at first,
fearful of what would happen.
The politics of change
Beginning around 1900, over a million African Americans left the economi-
cally depressed South and moved North (in what was known as The Great
Migration) to find more freedom and opportunity. What they got, of course,
was lousy factory or service jobs, oppressive bigotry, and Birth of a Nation.
In the period of World War I early in the 20th century, white Americans had
the jitters, not only over black Americans, but red ones, as well. No, we don’t
mean the Apache or the Sioux. These “Reds” were Bolsheviks, the commu-
nists that had brought down the Russian government, and were now, it was
said, trying to do the same in America. The street-corner politicians said that
a pack of Jewish anarchists were using African Americans as a pawn in their
sinister game.
And so white Southerners, still licking their wounds from the Civil War,
watched with undisguised glee as bloody race riots began to break out all
over the sanctimonious North, and the West, as well. The arrival of race
hatred in the North was soon to combine with one more factor to breathe
new life into the Klan.
236
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

A nation of joiners
The 1920s was the Golden Age of American fraternalism, spawning a nation 
of joiners. Every man had a lapel pin, every woman an auxiliary. Most men
belonged to a fraternal group like the Freemasons, the Elks, the Buffalo,
and the Moose. These were overwhelmingly white and Protestant, but the
Catholics had the Knights of Columbus, the Jews had the Sons of Israel, and
the African Americans had the Prince Hall Masonic Lodges and the Knights of
the Flaming Circle.
These and literally hundreds of other groups offered not just fun and friend-
ship, but the serious perk of insurance and a safety net for a man’s family
should he be killed or disabled, in those days long before Social Security.
Because we’re talking millions of members here (and millions of dollars in
dues), most of these fraternities employed professionals for the purpose of
organization and membership drives.
One of these professionals was an un-Reconstructed Dixiecrat from Atlanta
named Colonel William J. Simmons, a member of at least 12 fraternities and 
a professional recruiter for the Woodmen of America. He was “inspired” to
create a new Ku Klux Klan by three separate incidents:
 The release in February 1915 in Atlanta of Birth of a Nation. Colonel
Simmons was an absolutely rabid fan of the film.
 The rise of social disorder all over America, from race riots to draft riots
to “Red scare” riots, as well as the freewheeling lack of morals in the
“flappers” and “sheiks,” the flaming youth of the Prohibition-era 1920s.
 The formation of a sinister gang of thugs made up of a couple of dozen
prominent men in Atlanta politics, called The Knights of Mary Phagan.
Mary Phagan was a 13-year-old employee of an Atlanta pencil factory,
who was found raped and murdered in April of 1913. On incredibly
flimsy evidence, the factory manager, a Jew named Leo Frank, was tried
and convicted for the crime. The governor of Georgia commuted his
death sentence in preparation for a new trial, when evidence of his inno-
cence was uncovered. But in August, the Knights of Mary Phagan roared
into the work farm where Frank was being held and lynched him.
Two months later, these “knights” met atop Atlanta’s famous landmark,
Stone Mountain, the proposed site for a monument to the fallen warriors
of the South. They built an enormous cross and set it on fire against 
the night sky. It was so bright it could be seen all over Atlanta, a deadly
warning that was really unnecessary; half the Jews of Georgia had
already fled the state. They claimed that the inspiration for this desecra-
tion of the cross was the mountain-top signal fires of the Scottish clans.
Colonel Simmons co-opted (stole) it as a dramatic centerpiece for his
new Klan ritual.
237
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

All these forces prompted Simmons to create a new fraternity, dedicated to
“100-percent Americanism,” and patterned after the long-dead Ku Klux Klan.
But so little was known of the rituals of the Reconstruction Klan that the
Colonel had to invent most of it out of whole cloth. He clearly had a swell
time, using his knowledge of fraternal organizations to create a modern 
Klan ritual.
The secrets of this new ritual were never that secret. New initiates were
referred to as being “naturalized,” a reference to their new “citizenship” in
the “Invisible Empire,” another name for the Klan. As with Freemasons, new
recruits had to memorize some ritual, but for many the hardest part was
picking up on Simmons’s absurd new Klan lingo, all of it starting with a k.
As if grown men in those outfits needed to prove they had a sense of humor,
the Colonel’s nomenclature had a stunningly stupid ring to it.
 The Klan lodge was called a “klavern,” and officers included the Titan,
Cyclops, Kligrapp, Kludd, Nighthawk, Klabee, Kloreore, King Kleagle, and
Grand Goblin.
238
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 
Klan wardrobe
Many theories exist on the meaning of the Klan’s
signature white robes and goofy pointed hats.
The robes are pretty simple — they supposedly
stand for both purity and the white race. It should
be noted that the first Klan, during the
Reconstruction, didn’t really have a strict dress
code. Often these night riders simply wore dark
clothes and a burlap sack over their heads. Later
Klan uniforms were out of the imagination of D.
W. Griffith and Hollywood rather than Nathan
Bedford Forrest.
As for the pointed hats, it makes people think of
old-fashioned dunce caps that bad children had
to wear in the last century, but this only dates
from the 1840s. The pointy cap is much older, and
has had many meanings. For example, in the 13th
century, the Catholic Church forced Jews to
wear pointed hats, or Judenhuts, in the same
way Hitler made them wear yellow stars. But
holy men from ancient Hindus, Celts, and even
Iranian Scythians wore pointed hats. (The image
of witches and wizards in pointed hats probably
comes from this Celtic/Druidic root.) In the
Christian world, the most common meaning
behind the high pointed hat is the same meaning
as the towering spire on top of a cathedral; it sig-
nifies the person reaching for the grace of
heaven. This meaning has survived in Europe to
the present day. American tourists get really ner-
vous when they come across ritual festivals like
those of the Nazarenos, the Brotherhood of the
Passion, a fraternal order of Catholics in Spain
who wear robes and pointed hats with hoods of
scarlet and black when they march in solemn
procession during Easter.
It’s doubtful, however, that the Klan in 1870 knew
anything about the Nazarenos. It’s far more prob-
able that the inspiration for the pointed hat came
from the fact that the dreaded executioners of
the Spanish Inquisition wore them, in drawings
from books that were common currency in the
South. These night riders wanted to inspire
terror, so they unwittingly borrowed a symbol
from Catholicism, a religion that they despised.
Go figure.

 Their book of ritual was the Kloran.
 Conventions were referred to as klonvocations.
 Fundraisers were kleagles.
 Dues were called klecktoken.
In pretty short order, officers, rituals, and manic rhetoric all revolved around
one thing — the dues, because in order to perfect yourself in your “klannish-
ness,” you had to cough up at least a ten-buck klecktoken every year. And, as
the Most Worshipful Grand Goblin probably never admitted, with 4 million
members, that made for a slush fund that was a konsiderable kernal of kash
in 1925.
A recruit swore to hold his secrets and keep his oaths until “death and the
call of your Eternal Maker.” He (or she — there was also a popular ladies’ 
auxiliary) was then solemnly asked a series of nine sacred questions, to
which he was expected to give an equally solemn “yes.” They included krap-
ola such as, “Do you believe in Klannishness and will you faithfully practice
same toward your fellow Klansmen?” “Is the motive prompting your ambition
to be a Klansman serious and unselfish?” “Are you a native-born, WHITE!!!,
Gentile American citizen?” And our personal favorite, “Do you swear to 
preserve and protect the sacredness of White Womanhood?”
There were also recognition signs for one another, just like the Masons. 
For example, a Klansman might say the word “Ayak,” meaning “Are you a
Klansman?” If he found one, he might get the answer, “Akia,” which means 
“A Klansman I am.”
There’s one thing that’s essential to understand about this new Klan. The
Klan of the Civil War South was principally about hatred of the new class of
“Free Blacks” and their supporters. But this reborn Klan was far more about 
a deep hatred of Jews, Catholics, and most foreigners in general. Yes, they
hated black Americans, but the lives of African Americans in that period were
so marginalized, so beaten down, that they didn’t seem to present the sort of
threat in the 1920s that Jews and Catholics did. After all, a lot of Jews and
Catholics looked just like normal people! They could be out there, infiltrating
our businesses and fraternities and neighborhoods, and we wouldn’t even
know it! This, for the Klansman of 1920, was an intolerable situation.
Hijacking the Klan
For a little man, Colonel Simmons had a big dream. He wanted to send the
Klan north of the Mason/Dixon line, for the first time in history. The whole
country, including Simmons, had gone secret-society crazy. So why not add
the Klan to the list? Simmons hired a public relations firm to help him, but
they wouldn’t do the job nearly as well as a fast-talking, hard-drinking 
traveling salesman named D. C. Stephenson.
239
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

David Curtiss (Steve) Stephenson was born in Oklahoma, migrated to the
Midwest, and arrived in Evansville, Indiana, in 1920 as a typesetting sales-
man, the same year the Klan arrived. He was a powerful public speaker, and
also very politically minded. But more than anything else, he was a savvy
businessman and opportunist. Within a year of joining the struggling
Simmons’s Klan, Stephenson had become a professional recruiter for the
organization.
Stephenson’s rise in the Klan
Stephenson clearly saw the money and power to be had; money from the
avalanche of membership dues, and power in the form of calling the shots 
for a huge voting block. Soon his Klan career soared like a comet, with
Stephenson, nicknamed “the Old Man,” becoming the Grand Dragon of 22
states, ruling over 4 million Klansmen from his palatial home in Indianapolis.
Under his leadership, membership went through the roof; in Indiana alone, 
it rose to over 300,000 — an astonishing one-third of the men in the state. 
For the next four years, Stephenson was the most powerful single force 
in Midwestern politics, ordering mayors and governors around as if they
were waiters.
Most of the down-to-earth farmers and businessmen of the Midwest who
flocked to join the Klan knew nothing at all about the Ku Klux Klan of the 
Old South — many just thought it was a neat Greek name for a fraternity with
some cool rituals and fancy uniforms. They didn’t make the connection to
violence in the name that we do today. They’d have to see that violence in
action before they walked away from the Klan.
At the top of his game, Stephenson enjoyed an opulent lifestyle, hosting
grand parties, flying back and forth to address huge Klan rallies, indulging
without restraint his taste for the finest food, bootleg booze, expensive
cigars, and good-looking women. He lived like a gangster, with two armed
bodyguards at all times. In other words, being catapulted out of poverty and
obscurity had definitely turned his head. It seems unbelievable today, but
Stephenson had set his sights on becoming president of the United States.
And he nearly made it, too.
The Old Man had been a Democrat before turning Republican, and he had
stooges in both parties, but especially the Republican Party. One of Indiana’s
senators was on his deathbed, and the governor, who had the responsibility
of appointing someone to fill out the term, was in Stephenson’s pocket. If he
became a senator and moved to Washington, Stephenson believed his light-
ning political career would carry him to the White House on the shoulders of
millions of Klansmen.
240
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

But pride, as they say, goeth before the fall, and although Stephenson was
high, he was standing on a cliff with his foot on a banana peel. The Old Man
once said, “Everything is fine in politics as long as you don’t get caught in
bed with a live man or a dead woman.” His joke would come back to bite him
in the backside. No, it wasn’t a live man. It was a dead woman.
Stephenson the lady-killer
Stephenson was a portly, short sort of a guy, with thinning blonde hair and a
pasty complexion, but when he looked in the mirror, he saw God’s gift to
women. Wherever he went, no waitress or hotel maid was safe, particularly if
he was drunk, which was fairly often. The fact that he would marry four times
serves to highlight his ability to get along with women. By 1925, he’d already
bought or bullied his way out of a couple of rape charges, and this had made
him even bolder. He clearly thought that any woman who caught his eye was
fair game.
Unfortunately for her, the next woman to catch his eye was a pretty secretary
in the Indiana Statehouse named Madge Oberholtzer. Stephenson sat next to
her at the governor’s inaugural dinner, the symbolic peak of his political
power, because the governor was his hand-picked man. He was ripe and
randy that night and began maneuvering Madge at once. When she admitted
her dreams of being a writer, he convinced her he was writing a textbook, on
nutrition of all things, and that because she was in the Department of
Education for the state, he proposed that they write the book together.
Closing the trap
But on the night of March 15, 1925, when Stephenson lured Madge to his
house on the pretext of beginning work, he had something else entirely in
mind. By the time Madge arrived, he was already blasted, and before she
knew what hit her he’d drugged her, assaulted her, and hauled her, half-
conscious, into his private stateroom on the night train to Chicago. Over the
course of the next three days he held her prisoner, raping and brutalizing 
her repeatedly, while her family desperately searched for her. At last, after
three hellish days, Madge was able to slip away for a moment from one of
Stephenson’s bodyguards. She then calmly walked into a drug store, 
purchased a bottle of mercury bichloride, and swallowed it.
Mercury bichloride is a highly toxic form of mercury, sold in those days in a
concentrated form to be mixed with water for use as, among other things, an
antiseptic. Mercury poisoning is a dreadful and painful death.
Madge had clearly hoped the poison would be fatal, but instead it made her
desperately ill. Stephenson, ever the gallant gentleman, threw her in the back
of a car and drove through the night with her and his two bodyguards, then
dumped her at her home while her parents were out looking for her.

Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

Madge’s death was agonizing; it took nearly a month. She’d not only 
been beaten, raped, and poisoned, but she was also covered with vicious
bites inflicted on her by Stephenson. Her doctor said it looked as if she’d
been attacked by cannibals. All he could do was give her morphine for the
pain. Pathologists later said a secondary cause of her death was septicemia,
an infection from the horrific bites.
Death of the Klan in the Midwest
Stephenson was fond of telling people that he was the most powerful man 
in America, and that he outright owned the state of Indiana. He would find
himself wrong on both counts. Will Remy of the District Attorney’s office 
was sometimes called the “boy prosecutor,” but he couldn’t wait to try
Stephenson, with Madge’s deathbed statement as evidence, despite the 
death threats aimed at him. The men in the jury were equally unimpressed 
by Stephenson’s position, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The
Indianapolis Times would win the Pulitzer Prize for its exposure of Klan 
corruption in the Midwest.
The Klan was dead in Indiana, and would soon die across the Midwest.
Although the hard times of the Depression just around the corner were a
factor, the fact is that once people discovered what sort of man Stephenson
really was, they couldn’t tear up their membership cards fast enough. The
numbers of the faithful plummeted, and the Klan would never again be a
force of any legitimate political power in the United States.

The pope of Kokomo
One of the few comic moments in this whole Klan
business came about because of the fear of
“popery,” or Catholicism, that was pumped up by
1920’s Klan organizers. Somehow, the rumor
started amongst the Klansmen of the state of
Indiana that the pope was building a multi-mil-
lion-dollar “palace” in the city of Washington,
and that he was planning to move the Vatican to
the United States. No, we’re not kidding. Several
Protestant ministers had even commented on the
danger during their sermons. Then the rumor got
started that His Holiness had been tossed out of
Washington, and was shopping for property in
Chicago. And Chicago was uncomfortably close
to Indiana. Once this rumor spread, the Klan
went into high gear. Literally.
According to the Indianapolis Times, after a par-
ticularly heated rally in Kokomo, a bunch of
Klansmen drove out onto Highway 31, armed and
ready to face the Catholic hordes. Word had
come down that Chicago didn’t want the pontiff,
any more than those folks in England or France
did. The pope was living in disguise in the Windy
City, and he was coming with his minions to
Indiana to scope it out for a new Vatican. Well,
by God, Hoosiers would give him the welcome he
deserved if he tried it! This nonsense went on for
weeks. For sheer, baggy-pants burlesque, it’s
hard to beat the image of a bunch of farmers 
with shotguns waiting out in the middle of
nowhere for the pope’s army to invade the nation
of Indiana.

The Klan goes underground
In the mid-1920s, Klan membership in the United States was estimated at
roughly 4 to 5 million. By 1930, after the one-two punch of the Great Klan
Scandals and the Great Depression, membership hit 30,000. That’s not a drop,
or even a plummet — that’s the Wrath of God. By 1970, the figures were 
estimated at just 2,000 to 3,000. Unfortunately, there has been a rise to 5,000
in 2007, as high as 10,000 in some estimates. Yet, the Klan of old was deader
than a dead hog by 1950. So, what do you do when you can’t sway elections
anymore? You go underground and start blowing things up.
Mississippi burning
The Klan in its death throes would kill more people than it had in its heyday.
Klan diehards were unfazed by their small numbers; when a mayor or gover-
nor passed laws against cross burning, they bought neon crosses to go with
their permanent press sheets. This diehard group of violent men still
believed, mistakenly, that the Ku Klux Klan was forever. As the society around
them began to change and to integrate, they used violence as their last
remaining weapon.
During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, the Klan was behind one act
of terror after another: the assassination of NAACP leader Medgar Evers in
June of 1963; the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham,
Alabama, in September of 1963, one of dozens of such bombings, in which
four little girls were killed; the drive-by shooting of Detroit housewife and vol-
unteer Viola Gregg Liuzzo, who was driving demonstrators back and forth to
Montgomery, Alabama; and the senseless murder of Lt. Colonel Lemuel Penn,
an African American who’d fought in World War II in the Pacific, and who was
simply driving home to Washington, D.C., from a training session at Fort
Benning, Georgia. His Washington license plate was spotted by a carload of
Klan goons, who followed his car and killed him, thinking he was another
Civil Rights worker.
There were other deaths as well, and many more innocent people hurt during
street rioting, from a Boston nun to a black newspaperman. But of all the
deaths, the ones that captured the public imagination with the greatest inten-
sity were those of three young and idealistic Civil Rights workers who’d gone
into the heart of Klan country in Mississippi to register African Americans to
vote — James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner. On the
night of June 21, 1964, they drove out to investigate a burning of a black
church, and on the way back to Meridian they were pulled over for a traffic
violation. Briefly jailed, they got back into their car, and two carloads of
Klansmen ran them off the road. The young men were beaten, shot, and then
buried on a farm six miles from Philadelphia, Mississippi.
243
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

The FBI, under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover, swarmed into the South,
particularly Mississippi, to take on the Klan. Some Southerners viewed it as
another Yankee invasion. The Klan continued in Stephenson’s footsteps to
rain hate down on Catholics and Jews as well as African Americans, but in 
the highly charged atmosphere of the 1960s South, tension between blacks
and whites brought the Klan some support even in heavily Catholic cities like
St. Augustine, Florida.
Yet the Klan, not known for its intellectualism, had badly miscalculated in
their bloody efforts to fight integration in the South. They were losing their
base of supporters. High-profile politicians who once could’ve been counted
as friendly to the Klan were now denouncing them; even the most right-wing
major political figure of the day, Alabama governor George Wallace, was taking
them to task for the shootings and bombings. By the end of the decade,
people of all stripes were just plain sick to death of all the bloodshed. And 
by the middle of the 1970s, the joke in Mississippi was that the best place to
meet an FBI agent was a Klan meeting.

The secret codes of white supremacists
The white supremacist movement has its 
own secret language, symbols, and slogans.
Swastikas, lightening bolts, spider webs, and
Nazi symbology all commonly appear as tattoos,
graffiti, or logos. Likewise, many acronyms are
used to disguise white supremacist and neo-
Nazi slogans from outsiders. Some of the most
common include
 RAHOWA: Racial Holy War
 ORION: Our Race Is Our Nation
 WPWW: White Pride World Wide, com-
monly used as a greeting between white
supremacists.
 KIGY: “Klansman, I Greet You.” This acronym
pops up on Web sites, in e-mail addresses,
or as a salutation in messages to indicate
membership in the KKK. The phrase dates
back to the Klan of the early 1900s, along
with similar expressions: AYAK (Are You A
Klansman), and AKIA (A Klansman I Am).
 311: K is the 11th letter of the alphabet, so 311
means three 11s, and stands for KKK.
 14 or the term 14 Words: Shorthand for the
phrase, “We must secure the existence of
white people and a future for white children.”
It was coined by leader David Lane of the
1980s hate group The Order (now defunct),
which engaged in bombings, robberies, and
murder. Lane died in prison in 2007.
 88: H is the 8th letter of the alphabet, so 88
stands for Heil Hitler. It often appears in
e-mails. Sometimes combined as 14/88. Using
similar logic, 18 stands for AH, Adolf Hitler.
 ROA: “Race Over All.” A greeting used by
groups like Volksfront (see “The wide world
of hate groups” later in this chapter).

The Klan today
The Klan has little brand-name power anymore. There’s no one single Klan —
it splintered apart long ago. Today, there are somewhere between 100 and
150 small groups out there calling themselves the Klan; two thirds are in the
South. Several in the country could be said to be prominent, if any of them
could be called that — the Imperial Klans of America, the American Knights of
the KKK, the Bayou Knights of the KKK in Texas, Louisiana, and the Southeast,
and the Texas-based Knights of the White Kamelia.
Membership numbers can’t be trusted. For example, the one claiming to be
the biggest is the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Zinc, Arkansas. Its national
director, the Reverend Thom Robb, refers to this as the Klan’s “fourth era,” a
kinder, gentler Klan, preaching love and not hate. God is invoked a great deal,
and he claims that race-mixing is a product of Satan. Yet, he also claims a
massive membership, while the Southern Poverty Law Center estimates his
membership at 50.
The spawn of the KKK
Aggressive young racists today tend to perceive the Klan as being creaky and
out of date. Yet there’s little question that the ugliest legacy of the Klan has
been the number of smaller, and even more virulent, hate groups that have
been spawned in its wake.
The racist skinhead movement began in the late 1970s in England, coinciding
with the punk rock music culture. What originally started as a fashion state-
ment, quickly morphed into a white nationalist political movement, and they
have been historically known by their shaved heads, high-top military-
style boots, and openly racist tattoos. Skinheads have a far right-wing, neo-
Nazi ideology, and are especially violent — Jews, Muslims, gays, and left-wing
political groups are their frequent targets. The skinhead movement spread to
Europe and North America, and most recently, Russia. Estimates vary wildly,
but some sources claim there are 120,000 skinheads worldwide.
The second generation of skinheads has become more media-savvy. Many
have grown out their hair, and traded the Doc Martin stompers for wing-tips.
They’ve become the entrepreneurs of hatred, making money off everything
from white supremacist rock music to hatemongering documentaries.
Likewise, “hate radio” podcasts are bringing their messages of racism to a
worldwide listenership.
245
Chapter 12: Secret Societies of Terror and Death

Here are a few of the more common modern race-hatred groups around 
the U.S.:
 White Aryan Resistance (WAR): A group founded in 1983 by Tom
Metzger. An ex-Klansman, he reaches out to young skinheads with
heavy-metal rock music that carries a racist message. Metzger has
begun to advocate what he calls the “lone wolf” method of organizing
white supremacist groups, meaning that no group member should wear
anything or discuss anything that gives him away — hide behind the 
golf shirt or the old suit and tie, until the time to strike. There are now
two prominent companies out there doing white supremacist rock:
Resistance Records and Panzerfaust Records.
 Aryan Brotherhood: This is largely a prison-based hate group, started
in 1967 in California’s San Quentin prison. On the outside, they function
as a street gang, combining white supremacism with violence and a
lucrative trade in methamphetamine.
 Aryan Nation: This is the so-called “political wing” of the white
supremacist Church of Jesus Christ-Christian — and splinter groups 
like Ayran Nations of South Carolina, whose motto is “Violence Solves
Everything,” and The Order, all of whom have conspired to commit 
various acts of racial violence.
 World Church of the Creator: Holocaust deniers all, this violent fascist
organization is still up and running, despite the fact that their leader
Matthew Hale went to the slammer in 2003 for plotting to kill a federal
judge. In an unintentionally hilarious attempt at public relations, it has
recently changed its name to The Creativity Movement.
 Nazi Low Riders (NLR): Affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood, the NLR
is a prison and street gang that became popular in the 1990s. They 
combine the usual violence and white supremacism with drug dealing.
Black Supremacism
White supremacist groups don’t have the corner on hate. Black separatist
groups appeared as early as the 1930s, but the 1960s saw the emergence of
the “Black Power” movement and the growth of both black separatist and
black supremacist groups:
 The Nation of Islam, currently led by Minister Louis Farrakhan, is the
most famous of the U.S. black supremacist/separatist groups.
246
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

 The Neuwabians, a lesser-known group, founded by Malachi Z. York in
the 1970s, combines black supremacy with Egyptian symbols, ancient
alien astronauts, hollow Earth theories, Freemasons, Islam, Christianity,
Rastafarianism, and, unbelievably, Dr. Seuss into a bizarre black sepa-
ratist movement. In 1993, the group built Tama-Re, a massive Egyptian-
themed African-American colony outside of Eatonton, Georgia. York was
imprisoned in 2002 on over 100 charges of child molestation, and Tama-
Re was sold and demolished.
Some violent black supremacist groups have crossed the line from simply
preaching hatred to racially motivated killings. The more famous ones are
 The Black Panther Party: The most famous group from the 1960s. While
it started as a violent black separatist organization, it changed direction
in the 1970s and became a proponent for socialism for all races.
 The New Black Panther Party: Formed in 1989 in Dallas, Texas, by
former Nation of Islam minister Khalid Abdul Muhammad. Their message
is virulently racist, anti-Semitic, and violent.
 Death Angels: A violent offshoot of the Nation of Islam, believed respon-
sible for at least 14 murders in San Francisco between 1973 and 1974
(they came to be known as the “Zebra murders,” named after a radio
channel used by police working on the case). As many as 70 killings
across California may have been committed by the Death Angels.
 Nation of Yahweh: A black supremacist religious cult founded by
Yahweh ben Yahweh (aka Hulon Mitchell, Jr.), who taught that blacks are
the true Jews, and that white Jews are Satan’s spawn. An inner circle
called The Brotherhood went on a killing spree in 1986, murdering
random white “devils” around Miami, Florida, and cutting off their vic-
tims’ ears as trophies. Former Oakland Raiders player Robert Rozier was
a member who admitted to murdering seven whites to gain favor with
Mitchell. Cult defectors were beheaded.
In what has to be the strangest ideological dance among race-baiters, 
amazingly some white and black separatist groups do get along with each
other. Some separatists on both sides of the color bar are in favor of peace-
fully keeping the races apart, and have no problem working together for that
goal. White supremacist Tom Metzger has addressed gatherings of the Nation
of Islam, at the invitation of NOI’s Louis Farrakhan. Likewise, black separatist,
Holocaust denier, and anti-Semite Robert L. Brock spoke to a 1994 Aryan
Nation conference dressed in a KKK robe.

The wide world of hate groups
While the KKK and its kindred imitators are
known across the U.S., there are groups on the
march across the world that have racism, big-
otry, and violence as their motivating creed. The
Internet has made both the growth and the track-
ing of hate groups around the world grow at an
exponential rate. Online sites that recruit for
these groups can now look every bit as slick, pro-
fessional, and appealing as a Fortune 500 corpo-
ration or a church Web site. And their targeted
enemies are as varied as the countries in which
they reside.
There are hundreds of international violent hate
groups around the globe, but here is a smattering
of them:
 Blood & Honour: A British neo-Nazi group
formed in 1987 as a white supremacist
recording company. Their armed wing,
Combat 18 (or C18) was formed in the early
1990s, and conducted attacks on left-wing
political groups and immigrants. Several C18
members within the British Army were
arrested in a crackdown between 1998 and
2000. Foreign divisions of Blood & Honour
have been hunted down and outlawed in
Germany and Spain, but C18 cells remain elu-
sive because of their leaderless structure.
 Volksfront: One of the fastest growing 
neo-Nazi, skinhead groups in the world.
Originally started in 1994 by Randall Krager in
the Oregon State Penitentiary, Volksfront
(German for popular front) has spread to at
least seven countries.
 Génération Kémi Séba (KGS): A violent
French black Muslim separatist group. Based
on Nation of Islam teachings, KGS is fiercely
anti-Semitic and anti-white. Formerly known
as Tribu Ka, the group was outlawed in
France, but has reappeared since 2006 with
its new name. Central to their beliefs is the
idea that France’s 6 million Muslims are being
held in poverty and ignorance by the coun-
try’s 600,000 Jews. You do the math.
 Watchmen On The Walls: An evangelical
“ministry” group, based in Latvia, that stages
fierce protests against gays and lesbians in
Europe and the U.S. The group has spread
into the U.S. Pacific coast via waves of Slavic
immigrants, and it has stepped up the inten-
sity of its protests to include violent attacks. A
group of Watchmen murdered a gay man at
a picnic in Sacramento, California, in 2007,
and the organization remains unrepentant.
Instead, it has stepped up its violent rhetoric.
 Jewish Defense League (JDL): With a world
full of violent anti-Semitic groups dedicated
to killing Jews, it’s only natural that a group
arose to fight fire with fire. The JDL was
formed in 1968 by radical Rabbi Meir Kahane
in New York City and immediately attracted
hundreds of Orthodox Jews to sign up as a
vigilante force to protect themselves from
frequent attacks. In the 1970s it grew into a
worldwide terrorist organization, engaging in
assassinations, bombings, and especially
anti-Soviet activity. In the 1980s, the JDL
committed at least 18 known violent attacks
in the U.S., but after arrests and schisms
within the leadership, today they seem to be
more of a protest group.
In 2007, the European Union made “incitement to
racism” a crime in all 27 member nations.
Meanwhile, Germany has had a long-standing
law that forbids the use of symbols connected
with Hitler’s Nazi Party or the public declaration
of Holocaust denial. Nevertheless, anti-Semitism
is on the rise worldwide. Between 2005 and 2007,
Israel’s Tel Aviv University reports that attacks on
Jews worldwide have doubled.

Frolicsome Fraternalism and
Nefarious Foes of Freedom
In This Chapter
 Exploring the Victorian fascination with fraternal groups
 Explaining the connection between secret societies and college fraternities
 Unmasking secret societies with a sinister bend
T
here was a time in America when every red blooded adult man, armed
with a fraternal ring or a club pin in his lapel, trotted off to his lodge each
week, armed with a secret handshake and a password.
This chapter discusses the phenomenal growth of fraternal “secretive soci-
eties” in the 1800s. It explores some of the positives of secret societies,
including the social safety net of the fraternal organizations. And we talk
about the formation of similarly styled college fraternities and university
secret societies like Yale’s infamous Skull and Bones.
Then we jump to an examination of a few of the many secret societies that
really did have the destruction of the social order as their aim (and still do
today, in some cases). Some are historical and had revolution on their 
collective minds. But such nefarious foes of freedom aren’t just confined to
the past, as the formation and activities of the Islamic terrorist organization
Al-Qaeda has shown.
The Golden Age of Fraternalism
The 19th century in America was a period of tremendous upheaval for soci-
ety. The Industrial Revolution brought millions of people into the cities off
the farms, and extended families that had stayed together for generations
were left behind. The cities became places where everyone was a stranger.
This, combined with a strong period of anti-Masonic sentiment throughout
the 1830s, resulted in an increase of new fraternal organizations, basing much
of their organization and ritual on the pattern of the Masons.

Throughout the 1800s, fraternalism exploded across the U.S. Literally 
hundreds of these secret societies were created, all with passwords, secret
handshakes, flamboyant names for officers, and elaborate, fictitious tales of
their origins. All of them had initiation ceremonies and levels of membership
based on rites of passage. Most were created for men only, but as the century
progressed, women’s groups began to develop too, either as their own 
independent organizations, or as “women’s auxiliary” groups to the larger 
fraternities.
In the 1870s, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows eclipsed the Masons 
for a while in terms of membership numbers. The other large group was the
Knights of Pythias, actually formed during the Civil War with the blessing of
the U.S. Congress and Abraham Lincoln, with the hope that a new fraternity,
with no past history, may draw members from the North and South to help
unite the war-torn nation.
The birth of the fraternalism movement
In the late 1820s, nationwide suspicion fell on the Freemasons in the United
States, especially after the Morgan Affair (the disappearance of Captain
William Morgan and the subsequent trial of Masons, discussed in Chapter 9).
Masonic lodges closed all across the country and state grand lodges fell on
hard times until the 1840s.
But the Masons’ losses benefited a steadily growing gaggle of other fraternal
groups who blatantly patterned themselves after the Masonic model of a
series of levels or degrees, based on elaborate ritual ceremonies, with exalted
officer names and increasingly bilious titles. All of them made their own
attempt to imitate Freemasonry’s initiation experience for their new 
members, in a wildly varying range of legendary origins and seriousness.
Inspiration: Myths, legends, and other interesting things
While the principal role of the fraternal groups was for fellowship (and 
perhaps business contacts), virtually all groups stressed the life-changing
experiences of progressing through their degree rituals. And these rituals
could literally be inspired by anything:
 Biblical allegories (like the Knights of the Maccabees)
 Greek and Roman myths (like the Knights of Pythias)
 Native American legends (like the Improved Order of Redmen, who also
claimed to be descended from the American colonists who dressed as
Indians and threw English tea into Boston Harbor)
 Popular novels (like the Supreme Tribe of Ben Hur, based on the book
Ben Hur by General Lew Wallace; or the Independent Order of Foresters,
based on Robin Hood)
250
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

 Professions inspired many groups that developed for specific types of
workers (like the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen), and many of these
would eventually morph into labor unions in the 1900s.
Other fraternal groups organized themselves by nationality or racial or 
religious lines, each with their own rituals, passwords, handshakes, and
“secrets”:
 Ancient Order of Hiberneans formed in the U.S. in the mid-1800s and 
primarily for Irish Catholics. Regarded as “unwanted” immigrants, Irish
and Italians formed dozens of fraternal groups across the U.S. German,
Polish, Russian, and many other groups of immigrants created their 
own clubs to associate with people from back home.
 B’Nai Brith started in New York in the 1840s because so many other fra-
ternal groups refused to allow Jews to join. The opposite was true of the
Catholic order, the Knights of Columbus, who formed because of Vatican
threats of excommunication for parishioners who joined the Masons.
 African-American fraternal groups were hugely popular in the black 
community and played as important a role as black churches in spread-
ing messages of morality, brotherly love, charity, and mutual aid. Like 
so much else in American society, an unspoken “separate but equal”
convention became commonplace until the 1970s — a social situation
that still exists to an extent today, with notable exceptions. While the
Masons, the Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, and hundreds of others
were supposed to be colorblind according to their own rules, in practice
that wasn’t so, and unwritten rules kept blacks out. The result was the
growth of “colored” versions of the same fraternal groups, with no 
connection to their white counterparts, apart from the similarities in
name and rituals:
• Prince Hall Freemasonry (named after founder Prince Hall 
in Boston)
• The Colored Knights of Pythias
• Grand United Order of Odd Fellows
Additionally, dozens of independent black fraternal groups formed over
the years. The same is true of historically black college fraternities and
sororities, which were formed because white students wouldn’t vote
blacks into their frats. These include
• Omega Psi Psi
• Alpha Phi Alpha
• Kappa Alpha Psi
• Phi Beta Sigma
251
Chapter 13: Frolicsome Fraternalism and Nefarious Foes of Freedom

And sororities like
• Alpha Kappa Alpha
• Deta Sigma Theta
• Sigma Gamma Rho
• Zeta Phi Beta
 Whites-only groups also formed, and the Ku Klux Klan (see Chapter 12)
is the best known and the most notorious. The U.S. has been through
several periods of nativism in its history, promoting the notion that
America was for White Anglo-Saxon Protestants only. Organizations like
the Know Nothings (named for the answer members were to give if 
questioned about the group) wielded much political power for a while 
in the mid-1800s.
Secrets of initiation
The neophytes who joined these groups, along with outsiders who didn’t
join, generally believed that the secrets of these secret societies were their
passwords, identifying handshakes, and other hand signals, along with the
ceremonials themselves. But overwhelmingly, men who joined one, or as
many as they could afford, knew better. The true “secrets” of these orders
were considered by their members to be the life-altering truths and lessons
experienced by participating in the ceremonies. Even today, men and women
who join similar secretive societies vividly recall their initiation night with
great clarity.
Reading through the rituals for dozens of these organizations reveals remark-
able similarities between them. The initiation of a new member was designed
to lead him from the outside world into the very different, solemn, and even
sacred space of the lodge room:
 He was almost always blindfolded and underwent several trials or ques-
tions put to him, as he was led through the room by a brother whom he
came to trust.
 He was required to take an oath or obligation in which he promised to
keep the secrets of the lodge, to support his lodge brothers, and to 
protect their families. These pledges were almost always accompanied
by the threat of a grisly penalty that threatened to lop off limbs, gouge
out eyes, apply hot pokers, or other suitably terrifying punishments.
 Members were encouraged to contemplate their own mortality as a
lesson to improve their lives and to live as though they could be gone
tomorrow. Death was a constant theme in the hundreds of secret 
societies that formed. Images of coffins, skulls, and skeletons were
common, and the secret societies were in the side business of selling
insurance policies (and there were loads of them).
252
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

 Enlightenment occurred when the new member’s blindfold was removed.
Depending on the order, this event was commonly accompanied by a
startling event: bright lights, loud noises, and in more than one case, 
a burst of real flame. Special effects became more and more common, 
and fraternal supply manufacturers invented new and exciting ways to
stage degrees.
 Religious faith (usually liberal forms of Protestantism, although there
were notable exceptions like the Catholic Knights of Columbus and the
Jewish B’nai Brith) was almost always folded into the rituals. The 
majority of these societies tried to espouse the Masonic model of being
open to all faiths (why limit your potential membership base?), and
many used generic terms for God to keep things ecumenical (Great
Chief, Great Captain of Salvation, Great Spirit, and so on). The over-
whelming majority of them encouraged their members to be religious
and to go to church on Sundays, but there’s no question that a large
number of men felt that they got their weekly dose of religion in their
lodges — something their wives and ministers didn’t agree with.
Bear in mind that the Victorian period when all this was going on was also
the period of explosive growth in belief in paranormal, psychic, and occult
subjects, combined with new discoveries of ancient Egyptian temples and
artifacts after Napoleon’s exploits there. The period also consisted of tent
revivals and traveling evangelical preachers not affiliated with mainstream
churches, who were creating their own take on traditional Christian teach-
ings. The result was a century of new religious and philosophical ideas 
flying across the countryside and being expressed in a wide variety of new
and innovative (and often unexpected) settings.
Parody and fun orders
Not all groups were about death, doom, and gloom. With the huge growth in
fraternal societies in the 1800s came more than a few parody groups. Many
existed for the sole purpose of hazing new candidates and then allowing 
the new guy to participate in exacting revenge on the next generation of 
candidates.
Other groups, like the Masonic Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic
Shrine (Shriners), grew up within the existing orders as a side group, often 
for the sole purpose of dressing in costumes, putting on a brief ceremony,
then getting down to some serious drinking. Like the Shriners, an incredible
number of these fun groups used Oriental, Arabic, and Egyptian sources for
their inspiration:
 The Odd Fellows’ Oriental Order of Humility
 The Veiled Prophets of Baghdad
 The Knights of Oriental Splendor
 The Knights of Columbus’ International Order of the Alhambra
 The Knights of Pythias’ Dramatic Order of the Knights of Khorassan
253
Chapter 13: Frolicsome Fraternalism and Nefarious Foes of Freedom

As a side consideration amidst all the drinking, paddling, practical joking, and
projectile puking, these groups quite often created charities (the Shriner’s
Hospitals for Children, being the largest and most successful of its kind).
Benevolent benefits
Masonry had become the club for movers and shakers in the early 1800s,
which led to suspicion by the general public. Many of the new groups that
formed in the wake of the Masons were promoted as being more egalitarian
than the Masons had become and concentrated more on the needs of the
growing working class. As literally hundreds of new fraternal groups formed
around the U.S., they added new benefits for members like insurance pro-
grams, death benefits paid to the members’ widows, retirement homes, and
orphanages to care for members’ children — in short, the sort of safety-net
programs taken over by the government in the 20th century.
By the end of World War I, many fraternal groups died out. And by the Great
Depression in 1929, many more were wiped out because of economic reasons,
but also because their mission had been taken over by Social Security, relief
programs, county and state homes for the aged, public orphanages, and many
other things the fraternal groups had originally been formed to provide.
What about women?
The overwhelming growth of fraternalism in the 1800s wasn’t confined to
men only, although secretive societies for women weren’t nearly as common
or popular. Women, as a broad generality, seemed to gravitate more to
church and the social aspects of the congregation. Nevertheless, stand-alone
and auxiliary orders for women did exist. Some of the most notable were
attached to the men’s fraternal groups:
 Order of the Eastern Star (Freemasons)
 Rebekahs (Odd Fellows)
 The Pythian Sisters (Knights of Pythias)
These groups were mostly designed by men within the larger parent organi-
zation to provide experiences similar to the men’s rituals, without actually
conferring Masonic, Odd Fellows, or Pythian degrees on the ladies. While
they had elaborate initiation ceremonies and involved rituals, passwords,
handshakes, and other trappings of the men’s groups, they were totally 
separate.
Female and co-ed Masonic orders were formed in France, Belgium, and
England in the 1800s, and a few such lodges still exist in the U.S., but are
regarded as unrecognized and clandestine (secret) by mainstream
Freemasons.

The fraternal military orders
The veterans of the Civil War influenced fraternalism in a major way in the
decade after the conflict ended. The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) was
formed in 1866 as a group for veterans of the Union Army, primarily to dress
in uniforms, wield ceremonial swords, and march in parades (along with
becoming a huge lobbying organization that influenced the Republican Party
for decades).
The result was that every major fraternal organization in the country bought
the same uniforms and swords, marched in the same parades, and competed
with the GAR with their own military drill teams: The Knights Templar
(Freemasons), the Patriarchs Militant (Odd Fellows), along with uniform drill
teams of the Knights of Columbus, the Knights of Pythias, and many other
orders. The Soldiers of Woodcraft (Modern Woodmen of the World) were a
little different. They marched with large axes and performed firemen’s drills.
College Fraternities and Secret Societies
The first college fraternity in the U.S. was called FHC (probably standing for
the Latin phrase, Fraternitas, Humanitas, et Cognitio meaning Brotherhood,
Humanity, and Knowledge), and was founded at the College of William and
Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1750. Because of its initials, it quickly
became nicknamed the Flat Hat Club, as a reference to mortarboard caps 
regularly worn by students in those days (not just on graduation day).
Perhaps its best-known member was Thomas Jefferson, who entered William
and Mary (W&M) in 1760. Patterned in some ways after Masonic lodges, 
FHC had secret handshakes, passwords, special medals, and membership
certificates.
Phi Beta Kappa was started as a secret debating society at William and Mary
in 1776 by student John Heath — some say out of revenge for being denied
membership in FHC. Many of its founders were Freemasons.
Fraternities with a Masonic connection
Most college fraternities share some characteristics of the Masonic fraternity:
a ritual ceremony, an oath of fidelity, an air of mystery or secrecy, a philoso-
phy of high idealism, or the strong tie of friendship. But several college frater-
nities were started in the last century specifically for Freemasons, or with a
blatant Masonic connection:
255
Chapter 13: Frolicsome Fraternalism and Nefarious Foes of Freedom

 Acacia was originally started in 1904 at the University of Michigan as a
fraternity for Masons only, and the organization was to be built on the
ideals and principles of Freemasonry. Members were supposed to be
driven by a desire for high scholarship and character, keeping the group
free from “unbecoming activities” that for years had been a blot on the
fraternity lifestyle. That was the theory, anyway. In 1934, the Masonic
membership requirement was dropped, largely due to reduced member-
ship during the Great Depression. However, because Acacia was founded
by Master Masons, it still enjoys an informal spiritual tie to Masonry.
 Sigma Mu Sigma started in 1921 at Tri-State College in Angola, Indiana,
by three Knights Templar and nine Master Masons. It too dropped the
Masonic affiliation during the Depression.
 Square and Compass fraternity began as a Masonic club in 1897 at
Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. It officially became
a college fraternity for Masons in 1917 and enjoyed tremendous growth
over the next 11 years. Fifty-seven chapters formed with 5,000 members,
including 15 college and university presidents, as well as professional
and government leaders. In 1952, it merged with Sigma Mu Sigma. Today,
there are ten active chapters of Sigma Mu Sigma–Square and Compass.
Other fraternities were influenced by different popular fraternal groups. 
Pi Kappa Alpha, for instance, based its ritual on the Independent Order of
Odd Fellows.
Skull and Bones
During the presidential election of 2004, both Republican candidate George
W. Bush and Democrat candidate John Kerry were asked about their member-
ship in a Yale fraternity known by the decidedly creepy name of Skull and
Bones. John Kerry said, “It’s a secret,” and changed the subject. Bush’s
answer was similar: “It’s so secret we can’t talk about it.”
Skull and Bones is the oldest fraternity on the Yale University campus. Its
original name was the Eulogian Club, and was a U.S. chapter of a German stu-
dent organization. According to Skull and Bones lore, the club’s name came
from Eulogia, a supposed Greek goddess and patron of eloquence and debate,
who ascended into the heavens in 322 BC. “Bonesmen” refer to themselves as
the Knights of Eulogia, and the number 322 appears on their letterhead.
Originally founded in 1832 by William Huntington Russell (another disgrun-
tled student who couldn’t get into Phi Beta Kappa), the Eulogian Club 
originally met in a chapel on campus, and the members posted their symbol,
a skull and crossbones, on the door. In 1856, the fraternity moved into its 
permanent and distinctly spooky headquarters — a windowless, austere pile
of a building on the Yale campus, called The Tomb.
256
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Creepy décor and ceremonies
Break-ins and leaked videos of the Tomb’s interior reveal it to be a typical 
college frat house with décor reminiscent of the Addams Family. Skulls are a
big motif, and supposedly the skull of famed Indian chief Geronimo is housed
there too. Skull and Bones’ ritual ceremonies are closely guarded. Bonesmen
undoubtedly love the infamy and wild speculation, as most college 
students would.
The 2000 movie The Skulls presents an over-the-top tale of the club that has
little to do with reality, but it’s claimed that real initiates must lay in coffins
and confess their most lurid sexual secrets to the other members.
Famous Bonesmen and the CIA
Bonesmen are accused of appointing each other to powerful business and
political positions. Because Skull and Bones has an impressive list of famous
and powerful members, past and present, conspiracy theories have naturally
grown up around the fraternity.
The most common belief is that the CIA was created largely by Bonesmen —
dramatically portrayed in the 2007 film The Good Shepherd. Interestingly, the
CIA actually developed a Web page to debunk or correct errors in the film —
strange behavior for a government agency devoted to secrecy. But it is true
that many of the founding members of the CIA, like Sherman Kant, James
Angleton, Norman Holmes, and “Bay of Pigs” planner Richard Bissell, Jr., were
Bonesmen. And of course, before he was Ronald Reagan’s vice-president, and
then president himself, Bonesman George H. W. Bush was director of the CIA.
In addition to the two Bush presidents, other members of Skull and Bones
included
 President William Howard Taft
 Henry Luce, founder of Time magazine
 William F. Buckley, Jr., founder of National Review (and himself a former
CIA operative)
Skull and Bones started to admit “Boneswomen” in 1991, resulting in a failed
legal protest by the society’s older “patriarchs,” led by Buckley himself.
Just for the record, Yale’s Scroll and Key, Berzelius, and Wolf’s Head secret
societies also meet in imposing, windowless buildings, very similar to, and
just as creepy as, The Tomb. High-profile, financially well endowed, exclusive
secret societies for seniors have been a hallmark at Yale for 170 years, and
Skull and Bones is far from the only one.
257
Chapter 13: Frolicsome Fraternalism and Nefarious Foes of Freedom

Revolutionary Brotherhoods
There are hundreds of cases of militaristic secret societies throughout his-
tory that have tried, and at times succeeded, in staging coups, rebellions, and
takeovers of governments. Some, like Boston’s Sons of Liberty (of Boston Tea
Party fame), between about 1766 and the start of the American Revolution,
are revered as patriots by one side and traitors by the other. Such is the role
of the winning team when writing history.
In the following sections, we cover a few notable revolutionary societies.
Copperheads and the Knights 
of the Golden Circle
In the years leading up to the Civil War, several organizations started in the
North that sympathized with the rights of southern states, proclaiming that
there wasn’t anything in the Constitution that said a state couldn’t secede from
the Union, if it so desired. Some of these Northern sympathizers formed into
clubs, some more secret than others. The Copperheads was one such club.
The Copperheads were named for their use of a large copper penny depicting
lady Liberty, used as identifying lapel badges, and were set up much like other
fraternal groups, with initiations and symbolism. They eventually became
known as a front organization for a variety of subversive and deadly activities
in the North.
George Bickley’s knightly order
The most notorious group connected with the Copperheads was the order 
of the Knights of the Golden Circle. Founded in 1854 by an eccentric character
named George W. L. Bickley, the group was first headquartered in Cincinnati.
Bickley had an impressive-looking pedigree, with a wall full of medical
degrees — all of which were forgeries. Like so many other fraternal groups,
his elaborate degree rituals were very appealing, but his had a darker pur-
pose. The first degree was the Knight of the Iron Fist, and it was a probation-
ary position. After a candidate reached the two “inner” levels of the degrees
(Knight of the True Faith and Knight of the Columbian Star), he was told the
true purpose of the Order.
The Order’s secret goal was for the Knights to eventually invade and 
overthrow the government of Mexico to make it a new Southern slave state.
Ultimately, they wanted to take over the island of Cuba and control access 
to the Gulf of Mexico’s shipping. Using Havana as its center, a great “golden”
circle was drawn that included Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, all the
Southern states, plus part of Kansas, most of Texas, Mexico, Central America,
part of South America, and all the West Indies.
258
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Their dream was a new Southern Empire that produced most of the world’s
cotton, sugar, and tobacco, along with a substantial part of its best coffee and
rice. Pretty exciting, as dreams go, especially if you were a plantation owner
who was in danger of losing his “peculiar institution” (their precious
euphemism for slavery) and “cherished way of life.”
The Order’s local chapters, called “Castles,” became recruiting stations, 
and the ritual was a way of sounding out men’s political sympathies. Only the
most trusted and dedicated secessionists made it past the mumbo jumbo
lower degrees to discover the real purpose. Castles formed in both the North
and the South, and if the rumors were to be believed, the order had some-
thing like 60,000 men in the non-slave state of Missouri alone. The Knights
were strongly represented in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri, as
well as all across the South.
The Mexican invasion plan
Twice in 1860, large groups of Knights assembled in Texas and Louisiana to
begin the invasion of Mexico. As many as 16,000 are believed to have shown
up along the banks of the Rio Grande in April, but Bickley never arrived with
his mass of men from the North that he’d promised. At last, he showed up in
October, claiming the troops were right behind him, but that his shipment of
weapons had gone missing.
When the Civil War started, the Knights drifted apart. The real Confederate
Army needed them as soldiers, and the Order was swallowed up in the car-
nage that followed. They briefly tried to reorganize without Bickley under the
name Order of the American Knights in 1863, and again the next year as the
Order of the Sons of Liberty, but they quickly passed into obscurity.
Meanwhile, Bickley was arrested in Indiana for spying in 1863. He died in
1867. But the story doesn’t necessarily end there.
The lost Confederate treasure
Canada became the refuge of choice for Confederate officers and politicians
fleeing war-crime trials after the end of the Civil War. Warren Getler and Bob
Brewer, co-authors of Shadow of the Sentinel, believe the Knights of the
Golden Circle spirited off the treasury of the Confederacy to Canada, then
when the war ended, brought back the gold and silver coins and buried them
throughout the South to prepare for a new Southern uprising. One version
says that Jacob Thompson, Clement Clay, and Thomas Hines, all associated
with the Knights of the Golden Circle, managed to amass $2 to $5 million in
gold and silver and smuggle it into Canada before the war ended.
Of course, ever since the end of the Civil War, there have been dozens, if not
hundreds, of claims of secret buried treasure belonging to the Confederacy,
often involving gold bars stamped “CSA” (Confederate States of America).
Allegedly, they’ve been buried in forgotten mineshafts, sunken in shipwrecks,
hidden in false graves in Southern cemeteries, and submerged into bogs and
even the Everglades.
259
Chapter 13: Frolicsome Fraternalism and Nefarious Foes of Freedom

One version even identifies outlaw Jesse James as a Confederate spy and a
Knight of the Golden Circle, hauling some $90,000 off to a secret location in
New Mexico. (Of course, the wacked-out claims made about Jesse James over
the years could fill a book by themselves, including that he killed the “real”
John Wilkes Booth in a hotel room in 1890, and that he faked his own death
and lived until 1947.)
With all that stolen and hidden gold being spirited off into the night, it 
wouldn’t be surprising if the other, more accepted, theory really is true — 
the Old South just went broke.
The Fenian Brotherhood
When they clash, Irish and English politics are challenging to navigate
through just on their own. But when the ongoing disputes bubbled over into
the U.S., very peculiar developments took place. Such a case involved the
Fenian Brotherhood and their grandiose plans to invade Canada.
The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) formed in Ireland in the 1850s and led a
failed revolt against English rule in 1867. Members of the group often referred
to themselves as the Fenians, a word derived from mythological Celtic war-
riors, the Na Fianna, who were legendary protectors of Ireland. The IRB’s
Fenians became the most influential group in Ireland who campaigned for vio-
lent overthrow of the English government in the fight for Irish independence.
The Irish invasion of Canada
In 1858, the Fenian Brotherhood was formed as a secret society in the U.S. by
immigrants who carried the conflict between the Irish and the English to
North America. The Fenians hatched a daring plot: They’d invade Canada
(which was an English province), hold it hostage, and force the British to
declare Ireland independent if they ever wanted to see Canada alive again.
Think big, we always say.
The Fenians raised money by selling bonds to hundreds of thousands of
gullible Irish immigrants; the bonds would be redeemable six months after
Ireland was declared a republic. Weapons were purchased, and plans were
made. Curiously, the U.S. government, involved in its own Civil War, did noth-
ing to prevent the planning of the Canadian invasion — mostly because the
British had failed to back the North’s Union cause. So, on May 31, 1866, some
800 Fenian troops crossed the Niagara River into Canada at Buffalo, New
York. (The Canadians claim 1,500, mostly to make it sound like a bigger deal
than it turned out.)
The U.S. Army finally decided an international incident was a lousy idea and
cut off the supply lines and reinforcements to the Fenians. While the little
group briefly managed to capture Fort Erie and make a few more raids along
the St. Lawrence Valley, the whole adventure was doomed from the start.
260
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

After a week or so, the Irish were convinced to return to their homes when
the U.S. Army bought them all railroad tickets home, in exchange for their
solemn promise that they wouldn’t invade any more foreign countries. Still,
fear of Fenian mischief was one factor that drove the Canadian provinces to
form a confederation the next year for mutual protection.
Irish invasion redux
In 1867, the Fenians caught Canadian invasion fever again, and 6,000 
uniformed Fenian soldiers marched through the streets of Philadelphia at a
national convention (one wonders how the government would react today 
if 6,000 armed, white militiamen were to do the same thing through the City
of Brotherly Love).
In 1870, an estimated 15,000 Fenians crossed into Canada from New York and
Vermont to try again. Reportedly, one volley fired by Canadian troops sent
them packing back across the border. Another attempt was made in 1871, and
rumors of another invasion flew across western Canada in the 1880s. They
were taken seriously enough that British warships were anchored offshore
during the celebrations opening the Canadian pacific railway in 1885, just in
case the Fenians attempted any terrorist activities.
Officially, the IRB withdrew its support for its American brethren in 1867,
mostly over internal feuds and a major split between factions. The IRB was
finally dissolved in 1924 after a lengthy political battle and the signing of the
Anglo-Irish Treaty that created the Irish Republic.
The Shield Society
Yukio Mishima had a dream. Throughout the 1950s and ’60s he was one of
Japan’s hottest young authors and playwrights. But that wasn’t enough.
Mishima (born Kimitake Hiraoka in 1925), was the product of an odd family
background. His father was a brutal man who disciplined him ruthlessly, but
Mishima was actually raised by his peculiar grandmother, Natsu. She had her
own personality quirks and refused to let the young boy go outside in sun-
light or play with other children. It’s not surprising that the adult Mishima
became fascinated with images and philosophies about death.
Mishima had a succession of gay partners and became fascinated with 
body building. Even though he was just 5-feet 2-inches tall, he developed a
tough-guy look and many people mistook him for a westernized gangster —
something that delighted him to no end (in fact, he appeared in a Japanese
movie as the title character, a gangster called Tough Guy).
261
Chapter 13: Frolicsome Fraternalism and Nefarious Foes of Freedom

While Mishima became very famous, a poll in the 1950s revealed that 
50 percent of the female population of Japan would rather kill themselves
than marry him. Nevertheless, he married his wife Yoko in 1958, and they 
had two children. Still, his three favorite fetishes were armpit hair, sweat, and
white gloves. And death — preferably suicide.
In 1967, Mishima joined Japan’s Ground Self-Defense Force (their version of
the Army, formed by treaty with the U.S. after World War II). Then, in 1968, he
formed a private military organization called Tatenokai, or the Shield Society.
It was made up of young men, mostly students, who’d studied martial arts
and who proclaimed allegiance to Japan’s Emperor.
At the end of World War II, Japan’s Emperor Showa (known in the U.S. by his
more familiar given name, Hirohito) renounced his claim of divinity, some-
thing no emperor before him had ever done. Men like Mishima were ashamed
of the emperor’s actions, and the members of Tatenokai wanted to return
Japan to what they saw as a proper veneration of their emperor as a god —
whether the emperor liked it or not. They were great followers of the Bushido
code of Samurai conduct, and Mishima and his private army hatched a plot
to stage a coup and influence the Japanese military to join with them.
On November 25, 1970, Mishima and four members of Tatenokai raided the
office of the Tokyo commander of the Eastern Command of Japan’s Self-
Defense Force. They tied the commander to his chair and then unfurled a
banner detailing their manifesto from the office balcony. Mishima stepped 
triumphantly onto the balcony, dressed in his very spiffy Tatenokai uniform,
and addressed the SDF troops who gathered below.
Unfortunately, his attempts to rouse them to his cause of re-deifying the
emperor didn’t exactly meet with wild cheers and applause. Laughs, catcalls,
and loud farting noises, accompanied by hurled vegetables, greeted his
remarks (we’re big believers in bringing rotting vegetables to public speeches
and live theatre performances).
It didn’t look like the coup could be pulled off with just his four loyal
Tatenokai members, so Mishima went back into the office and committed 
seppuku (ritual suicide), along with his second in command, Masakatsu
Morita. Of course, Mishima had long planned for this possibility, and had
carefully written out his jisei (death poems) ahead of time. The remaining
members of the order — between 90 and 100 — quickly disbanded.
Operation Werwolf
In the closing days of World War II, the Nazis set up a secret guerilla warfare
unit called Werwolf to wreak havoc on the Allies, just in case Germany lost
the war. SS Lt. General Hans-Adolf Prutzman was made General Inspector of
Special Defense and placed in charge of the unit. Prutzman arranged for his
262
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Werwolf troops to be instructed in the latest methods of insurgency that
sound remarkably similar to activities in modern-day Iraq: arson, sniper
attacks, sabotage, and the building and use of improvised explosive devices.
Werwolf was comprised of approximately 5,000 troops drawn from the SS, as
well as Hitler Youth groups. On March 25, 1945, German propaganda minister
Joseph Goebbels gave a speech known as the “Werwolf Speech,” in which 
he urged all Germans to fight to the death, and postwar insurgency lasted
several years after the end of the war — as late as 1950, by some estimates.
Allied troops, especially French and Soviet forces, reacted against insurgency
strikes after the end of the war with strong retaliation — summary executions
of uncooperative civilians, and destruction of entire villages when suspected
guerillas weren’t turned over.
While the degree to which Operation Werwolf troops were effective is dis-
puted by some historians, there’s no question that Nazi insurgency through-
out France, Poland, Germany, and the Ukraine continued at least four years
after the war ended. If they’d been as organized and well equipped as General
Prutzman had wanted, postwar Europe may very well have been far bloodier
than it ultimately was. Meanwhile, some believe that the influence of Werwolf
activities — real and legendary — influenced former Hitler Youth to keep 
the concepts of neo-Nazism alive, right up through today.
Al-Qaeda
A young, idealistic millionaire from Saudi Arabia named Osama bin Laden
saw the Soviet invasion in the mid-1980s as the beginnings of a holy war
against Islam (jihad). Bin Laden spent a not-insignificant part of his inherited
fortunes on importing Muslims into Afghanistan from dozens of countries
throughout the Middle East. Bin Laden paid to transport, train, and arm 
thousands of these mujahedeen, who were in turn supported by the U.S. By
1988, the Soviets gave up and went home. But bin Laden and his fellow
jihadists did not.
With the Russian troops gone, Afghanistan fell into a civil war, fought
between mujahedeen warlords, and the government fell to pieces. By 1994,
the fundamentalist Taliban began to take over the government of the country,
and enforced the most brutal application of Islamic Shar’ia law the world had
seen in centuries.
The 1990 Gulf War
In 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, which put Iraqi forces within 
striking distance of the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden went home to
Saudi Arabia and offered the services of his mujahedeen to the Saudi King
Fahd. Instead, the king gave U.S. and other Western troops the unheard of
opportunity to base military forces in the sacred home to the holy sites of
Mecca and Medina.
263
Chapter 13: Frolicsome Fraternalism and Nefarious Foes of Freedom

Having the infidels so close to such sacred Islamic sites was too much for 
bin Laden and his fundamentalist group’s prickly religious sensibilities, and
he turned his anger on Saudi Arabia’s ruling family. After making public 
statements denouncing the Saudis, he was exiled to the Sudan and his Saudi
citizenship was revoked. In 1996, Sudan expelled him, but the Taliban 
government of Afghanistan welcomed him with open arms.
The Taliban made Afghanistan an isolated country in the world — only
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized them as the
legitimate government of the country. Such universal scorn made Afghanistan
the perfect place for his private army of terrorists to grow and recruit new
members without government interference.
Organization of Al-Qaeda
In 1998, bin Laden formed a new group called Al-Qaeda (“the base”), with the
avowed purpose of expanding the holy war far outside of Afghanistan’s bor-
ders. Bin Laden was especially admiring of the tactics used by Muslim terror-
ist organizations like Hezbollah.
Al-Qaeda was patterned along the classic lines of a secret society, and it
remains so today. Secrecy and strict obedience to superiors are hallmarks of
the organization, and the name Al-Qaeda itself was considered secret infor-
mation. They never used the name in public until after the 9/11 attacks made
them front-page news.
According to captured internal Al-Qaeda documents, the goals of the 
organization are to
 Establish the rule of Allah on Earth
 Attain martyrdom in the cause for Allah
 Purify the ranks of Islam from the elements of depravity
Seized documents and testimony of captured members have revealed some
details of the inner workings of the group:
 Bin Laden is the emir (religious leader) of the organization, as well as its
chief of operations. A shura council of between 20 and 30 advise him on
activities.
 A law committee decides whether knocking down skyscrapers and killing
more than 3,000 civilians conforms to Islamic law or not.
 A fatwah committee issues religious pronouncements, like a 1998 order
for Muslims to kill all Americans.
 A business committee handles the extensive finances of Al-Qaeda, paying
members, authorizing expenses like training suicide pilots, along with
managing their many for-profit businesses.
264
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

 In 1995, Al-Qaeda formed As-Sahab Foundation for Islamic Media
Publication, for the production of propaganda videos and publication,
run by Adam Gadahn, an American convert to Islam.
Al-Qaeda’s activities
In February 1998, leaders of Al-Qaeda issued a fatwa under banner of “The
World Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders” stating that it
was the duty of all Muslims to kill U.S. civilians and military personnel and
their allies, everywhere. Since then, activities known to have been carried out
by Al-Qaeda include the following:
 Two hotels bombed in Aden, Yemen, in December 2002, designed to
scare off U.S. involvement in famine relief efforts in Somalia
They were the wrong hotels, with no Americans in them, but it was the
first attack on civilian targets by Al-Qaeda.
 A failed plot to kill Pope John Paul II in 1994 during a visit to the
Philippines, and a similar failed plan in 1995 to kill President Bill Clinton
 Bombings of U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi,
Kenya, on August 7, 1998, resulting in 300 deaths, mostly civilians
 A plan to blow up 12 U.S.–Pacific flights in 1995, and a failed bombing at
Los Angeles International Airport in 1999
 USS Cole bombing in Aden, Yemen, on October 12, 2000, killing 17 crew
members and wounding 39
 The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September
11, 2001
 A failed attempt by Richard Reid to explode a shoe bomb on American
Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami in December 2001
 A fuel tanker explosion outside a Tunisian synagogue in April 2002
 Attack on a French tanker off the coast of Yemen in October 2002
 A car bomb attack and a failed attempt to shoot down an Israeli jetliner
in Mombasa, Kenya, in November 2002
 Car bomb attacks on residential compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in
May 2003
Al-Qaeda has also been implicated in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; a
series of incidents in Saudi Arabia against U.S. targets between 1995 and 1996;
the October 12, 2002, nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia; and the May 2003
suicide bombing attacks in Casablanca, Morocco.
265
Chapter 13: Frolicsome Fraternalism and Nefarious Foes of Freedom

By the end of 2004, the U.S. government claimed to have two-thirds of 
Al-Qaeda’s leadership from 2001 under arrest or killed, but attacks attri-
buted to the group have both continued and increased. Because of the 
high-visibility 9/11 attacks, Al-Qaeda has become much like a popular and
successful franchise, and terrorists no more organized than three high school
friends with a post office box have started to claim “links to Al-Qaeda.”
The Internet has been used as a way to broadcast propaganda, recruit new
members, and communicate with worldwide operatives. The result has been
self-spawning Al-Qaeda–styled groups. Both authentic Al-Qaeda cells and
copycat organizations fully understand the use of public relations and the
effects on the public if it’s believed that Al-Qaeda is everywhere and can

hen you hear the word Mafia, a definite set of images probably comes
to mind. One may be of Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone from The
Godfather. But there are others, too: John Gotti in an expensive suit, grinning
as he breezes out of the courtroom; or one of his victims, like Paul
Castellano, and his bullet-ridden body lying on the pavement in front of his
favorite restaurant. (Restaurants seem to be a great place to nail a Mafia don;
it was Gay Talese, in his 1971 book on the Mafia, Honor Thy Father, who joked,
“They always die with spaghetti in their mouths.” You’d think they’d start
buying TV dinners.)
This chapter covers the major secret societies of the criminal underworld.
But a substantial portion of this chapter examines just how much truth there
is in any of the myths of the secret society called the Mafia, or Cosa Nostra.
Exposing secrets and rituals is hard enough; but myths can be even harder to
tackle, because they’re so pervasive and so elusive.
Some people believe in the myth, particularly in America, of the don as a man
of honor, with a code of ethics that forbids drug dealing or violence against
innocents. According to John Dickie, author of Cosa Nostra, this belief is
common but misleading. Where old-style American Mafiosos are concerned,
we’re not certain we agree, but Dickie emphatically states:

There was never a good mafia that at some point became corrupt and vio-
lent. There never was a traditional mafia that then became modern, orga-
nized, and business-minded. The world has changed, but the Sicilian mafia
has merely adapted; it is today what it has been since it was born: a sworn
secret society that pursues power and money by cultivating the art of killing
people and getting away with it.
This chapter explores not just the organization of the Mafia, but some of the
characters who built it. We’ll leave it to the reader to decide if there is any
truth in the legends of Mafia honor. But you can’t understand the typical
Mafia don without a nodding acquaintance with the source of Mafia culture.
Birth of the Mafia — Queen Mother 
of Criminal Secret Societies
Most underworld secret societies owe at least part of their structure and
ritual to the most infamous of them all — the Cosa Nostra, or the Mafia. The
Mafia was born on the sun-drenched, rocky island of Sicily, just off the boot 
of Italy across the Strait of Messina. Because of its history and geographic
location, Sicily has always had a dialect and culture of its own, distinct from
mainland Italy.
In order to understand the psychology of the Mafia, it’s necessary to under-
stand the psychology of the typical Sicilian, a mind-set that was created by
the political and social realities of the region.
Sicily: Mafia’s motherland
Sicily sits in an extremely strategic position, smack in the middle of the
Mediterranean trade routes. Consequently, just about everyone had a 
shot at owning the place, for to take and hold Sicily was a necessity for every
general from Scipio Africanus to George S. Patton. Phoenicians and Greeks,
Byzantines and Arabs, and then in the 11th century the Norman French, of 
all people, all had their turn on the Sicilian throne.
It serves to highlight the foreign rule of the island that one of Sicily’s greatest
kings was a German, Frederick II, who protected and encouraged Sicilian art
and poetry in the time of the Crusades. He’s probably the main reason why
the Sicilians don’t all speak French. Apart from being strategic, Frederick’s
Sicily was rich in culture and in cash, the result of two things that it retains
today — its busy ports and its grain production. That’s what makes it so
unforgivable that for the next 800 years, feuding landlords would run this
first-rate property into the ground.
268
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

By the 13th century, kings of Spain and France both claimed the title of king of
Sicily. Not that either one was actually going to live there. The Spanish Borbón
kings most often held Sicily. But by the late 18th century, as the revolution
broke out in France, revolution-fever swept all of Italy, as well. A huge number
of Italians were on the side of Napoleon when he invaded Italy, because
Napoleon was going to bring down the feudal system. In Italy, sending the
kings, dukes, barons, and dons to the guillotine seemed like a swell idea.
From the fall of Napoleon to the rise of Mussolini a full century later, a series
of revolutions and lousy kings kept Sicily in a constant state of turmoil. Most
of these kings cared far more about what was happening on the mainland. So,
in effect, Sicily was ignored into poverty and anarchy. The land was aban-
doned, cursed with absentee landlords and uncaring monarchs.
The Sicilians were a tribal people, with a culture built on an ancient bottom-
to-top pyramid: the family, the clan, the tribe. The clan was perhaps the most
important. It was that unit of the extended family, often numbering into the
hundreds, that expressed the tie of blood so important to the Sicilian people.
Every clan had its leader, and that leader was called a don, a word of Spanish
origin that simply meant “sir,” the title of a gentleman or a person of noble
blood and rank.
During this period between Napoleon and Mussolini, the dons, the men of
honor, took hold of the island, becoming the only force for social order that
existed on a local level. And, although many of the dons were respected as
well as feared, the fact is that the Sicilian peasants would just as soon have 
cut their heads off, too, given the chance. That’s because the dons had their
hands in every business dealing on the island, and they always got their cut.
Every Sicilian peasant at harvest time ended up with granaries that were
bulging. And by the time the government and the dons had gotten done 
stealing their share, the peasant was left with a tiny pile of grain to feed his
family. Hunger was a constant and haunting specter over their lives, and most
peasant families never saw a plate of meat. They couldn’t afford it.
The dons of the various powerful Mafia clans ruled Sicily with small armies 
of “soldiers” called soldati that were rarely seen without their favored weapon,
the shotgun. They had no qualms about using it on anyone who got in 
their way.
The Code of Silence, the sacred Omertà, governed the lives not just of the
Mafiosos, but of the entire population. This code would follow the Mafia to
America. Its definition was simple: If you found yourself in the unfortunate
position of being questioned by a civil official about one of the dons or his
men, you didn’t see anything, you didn’t hear anything, and you didn’t know
anything. Otherwise, there was a shotgun in your future.

Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

The birth of the Cosa Nostra
By the 19th century, all the years of living as a conquered people had left
their mark on the Sicilian mentality. Whoever ruled from the capital, the port
city of Palermo, didn’t much matter to the common folk. If you get conquered
enough, a certain level of indifference, if not contempt, to the civil authority
is a natural by-product. The attitude is simple enough to understand — pay
lip service to whoever’s in power, and pay your taxes as well; but we all know
who’s really in charge.
While the lip service was being paid to the government, it was the dons of the
clans that had the real power. Generally speaking, the foreign government of
Palermo couldn’t have cared less who stole a farmer’s cow, or who’d gotten
the farmer’s daughter pregnant. These matters of great importance to a peas-
ant were of little or no importance to the Borbón king. The don settled these
270

Morphing into “Mafia”
So, just how many different explanations are
there for where the word “Mafia” comes from?
A lot — all with different levels of believability:
 The linguists contend that the word grew out
of an adjective in Sicily, mafiusu, which had
its roots in the Arabic word mahyas, which
means “boasting” or “bragging.” The adjec-
tive mafiusu is usually translated as meaning
“to swagger,” implying someone proud or
arrogant.
 Others say the word arrived on the scene
after a play called I mafiusi di la Vicana,
which means “The Beautiful People of
Vicaria,” a story which takes place in the
1850s among the gangs in a Palermo prison,
although the word is only used in the title, to
give it local flavor.
 Though it may or may not have come from
there, the most widespread early usage of
the term came out of a wildly popular 1890
opera by Mascagni called Cavalleria rusti-
cana, which means “rustic chivalry.” All the
men in the play are called “Mafiosi,” and all
are the victims of swaggering pride and blind
honor, the result of the wild, romantic
Saracen blood in Sicilians. In fact, the music
of this opera is playing all through the last
half-hour of The Godfather Part III. But in ref-
erence to the swagger of gangsters calling
themselves “men of honor,” the word first
appeared in a police report of the prefect of
Palermo in 1865.
 The most romantic version of all came out of
the occupation of the island by the Borbón
king during the revolution of 1848. Two
Spanish soldiers rape and murder an inno-
cent Sicilian peasant girl, dumping her body
in a church. When her mother discovers the
body, she runs into the street, crying, “Ma
fia! Ma fia!” which means, “My daughter!”
She will get justice only from the dons of the
island, who arrange for the assassination of
the murderers as part of their battle to take
back their homeland, taking “Ma fia!” as
their battle cry. Okay, maybe not, but it’s a
great story.

issues, and his word was law. He was paid a tithe, like a tribute tax, by the
peasants who owed him fealty, and they gave it over sometimes out of fear,
but more often than not out of intense loyalty and respect, in the beginning.
But as the dons became more powerful, they also grew more ruthless and
were usually involved in many crimes, such as stealing cattle or sheep, 
extortion, and muscling in on just about any sort of business deal that took
place on the island. The respect of old turned to fear and then terror.
Vendetta!
The system of local power and control under the dons didn’t necessarily
bring the plus of stability along with it. The problem was that, along with 
the freight of the don’s authority in each village and town, came the heavy
baggage of the vendetta, which comes from the Italian word for revenge. The
vendetta was a fierce, violent, and sometimes interminable war between two
Sicilian families.
All through the Middle Ages, Europe had kings, but in most places, it was the
power of the local warlord or feudal baron that was the real authority over
daily life, just as in Sicily. Of course, these petty feudal lords were constantly
making war on each other, all over Europe. Yet, as Europe progressed into the
Renaissance of the 15th century, the power of kings became greater, with 
the power of feudal lords lessening, until the nation was bound together into
a tighter, unified whole.
This process didn’t occur in Sicily. There, the dons, similar to feudal warlords
in their position of clan patriarch, often made war on one another in the same
fashion as the days of old. But since the clan was the central structure of
these warring factions, it wasn’t just an impersonal war over territory. It was
a blood feud. When you attacked an enemy, you didn’t just kill his sergeant-
at-arms or his knight; you killed his uncle or his cousin or his brother. This is
why vendettas could go on for years between two families, sometimes until
all the men of both clans had been killed. This incessant vendetta violence,
along with the extortionate demands of the dons, is what drove over a million
Sicilians to leave the land of their birth in the early 20th century.
For those remaining in Sicily, the grip of the dons would only tighten. They
organized themselves into the “Cupola,” a governing body of the Mafia 
families. Because of the number of families represented, the Cupola had a
complex organizational pyramid. It met in Palermo, and there’s no question
that the Palermo-area families had the greatest power. But theoretically, all
the families on the island were represented in a system of “mandamentos,” 
or provincial areas. (For more on Mafia families, please see “The Big Five of
the Commission,” later in the chapter.)
271
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

A mandamento is an old term for the district of a Sicilian magistrate. The
dons hijacked the word and used it to describe a connected area controlled
by three mafia families. One don was chosen to represent all three in the
Cupola; he was called a capomandamento. At the dawn of the 20th century,
over a million Sicilians left the economically depressed island; this was
roughly a quarter of the entire population. About 800,000 of them came to
America. By 1903, newspapers across America decried the fact that Italy was
“dumping its criminals” at our doorstep. By 1910, there were more Italians in
Little Italy on the Lower East Side of Manhattan than there were in the city of
Rome. This was the beginning of the prejudice all Italian-Americans would
have to fight, the myth that Italians were inclined to criminality.
The Mafia and Organized 
Crime in America
When Sicilians first started arriving in America, there were lots of “made
men,” or members of the Mafia, on those boats. Many of them were on the
run from either the law or the vendetta of another family. And the fact is that,
when they got here, they discovered that things weren’t very different in New
York than they’d been in Palermo, especially where politics and influence
peddling were concerned. The Mafiosos who’d done well in Sicily were 
starting all over again, but they would do well here, too.
Many of the Mafiosos who came to the U.S. hadn’t really thought of staying;
they were on the lam, for one reason or another, and they were going to bide
their time in America before returning. Yet, most never went home again,
unless the federal government deported them.
Tales of the Five Points gangs
It was rough going in the beginning, for all these Sicilian immigrants. Life in
America was better than what they’d left behind; there was more promise for
a brighter future. But it was incredibly rough going in the beginning. The
newly arrived Italian immigrants ended up in Little Italy, some in Brooklyn or
Greenwich Village; but the bulk of them were dumped in Five Points, a grim
slum on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. There was a very definite pecking
order in the Five Points, based on who’d already gotten there and assimilated
into the culture, and who was just getting off the boat.
This area was called “the Five Points” because it sat on five corners created
by the convergence of three streets; Anthony, Baxter, and Park. It was near a
48-acre lake called the Collect Pond that had once been a source of fresh
water, but became horribly polluted by sewage and industrial runoff from the
272
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

tanneries and slaughterhouses of the area. The pollution caused more than a
god-awful smell throughout the neighborhood — it caused continuing out-
breaks of typhus and cholera, as well. Disease spread like a wildfire, because
the density of immigrants on the Lower East Side was roughly 700 people per
square acre, the highest in the world. (None of these streets of Five Points
have the same name today — in fact, the pond was filled in and the whole
area turned into Columbus Park in the late 19th century.)
Many of the newly arrived Sicilian Mafiosi got right into bed with the most
corrupt gang of all in New York — Tammany Hall and the Democratic Party
machine. These folks slowly transformed into the Black Hand, the ruthless
gang that was the seed of the American Mafia. The Black Hand hustled votes
(called “ward heeling”) just as they’d done at home, muscling in on business,
often construction, giving out jobs for votes, and so on. This aspect of the
Black Hand, in fact, led to one of the Mafia’s most lucrative ties in America —
control of organized labor.
Paddywhacked — The Irish Mafia
The street gangs who ruled the Five Points neighborhood of Manhattan were
eager to greet Sicilians — with a club. Most of the toughest gangs at the time
were Irish, who’d arrived in a mass during the mid-1800s because of the Irish
Potato Famine. Their gang names, chosen to instill fear, seem a little silly to
our ears — not just the Bowery Boys or the Five Pointers, but the Plug-Uglies
and the Dead Rabbits.
However, despite the names, much of gang life and lingo is startlingly similar
to today. These gangs wore colors, they called their headquarters their
“cribs,” and their area of strength was called their “turf.” The biggest turf
wars began when the Little Italy neighborhood was born, and Five Points was
inundated with Sicilians.
The irony is that the Irish, first off the boat in the immigrant age, were also
the first to begin assimilating, and a popular place to assimilate into was 
the police force, which was populated by more Irishmen than any other
ethnic group.
This is where the classic gangster story was born, out of the reality of the
Lower East Side. It was the plot for dozens of gangster films. Either two broth-
ers, or two close friends who grow up together in the New York slums, take
different paths, one into gangsterism, the other into politics or law or the
District Attorney’s office. Sooner or later, their worlds collide, with painful
choices all around, dead sons, and weeping Irish mothers that didn’t leave a
dry eye in the house. In 1938, it was a Jimmy Cagney movie. In 1928, it was 
a common story of the rackets on the Lower East Side.
273
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

The Kosher mob
A Jewish Mafia? In the late 19th century, the reaction to this piece of
Americana was a bit comic, from Jew and Gentile alike. Most of the major
newspapers of the day took an anti-immigrant stance, and the wafting 
aroma of race prejudice was usually there, in all their coverage. But a Jewish
Mafia? Even the newspapers were surprised. Many essays of the day took 
an attitude indicative of one quote: “The Jew, whatever his faults, has never
before been a threat to public order.” As for the Jewish community’s reaction,
it was nothing less than appalled.
The Jews of Europe were used to living in ghettos — the very word has its
roots in the Austrian language for “Jewish Quarter.” Aryans without business
there were discouraged from going, and relations between Aryans and Jews
were looked on with distaste. But when the Jews arrived in free-wheeling
America, they discovered that it wasn’t so easy to control their children. Yes,
Jews lived in neighborhoods together, but no one was locking you in at night;
no one was saying that you had to stay south of Delancy Street.
There was bound to be inter-mixing, and different races came into contact
with one another with much greater ease and social acceptance. It was nearly
impossible to keep your son from mixing with the young Irish and Italian
gangs. For a race born and bred in respect for the law, it was a painful scandal
for old-world Jewish parents when their 14-year-old son was out running 
the numbers.
274
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 
Hey! Watch who you’re calling a bohunk!
You might not know what the word “Paddy”
means, a sign that American society is going in
the right direction. In fact, this aspect of New
York in the 19th century was an ethnic reflex that
spread to the rest of the nation along with the
Mafia. In the melting pot of America, everybody,
and we mean everybody, had an ethnic nick-
name that was, to at least some degree, pejora-
tive as well as jocular. Meaning simply that, some
guys used it to start a fight, while other guys used
it in a friendly way to their buddies. As to deter-
mining whether the name was an insult, the
source and the tone told you all you needed to
know. The Irish were “Paddies” and “Micks.”
Hungarians were “Hunkies,” the Dutch were
“Clog Wogs,” the Ukrainians were “Bohunks,”
the Germans were “Huns” or “Fritz,” the Jews
were “Yids” or “Kikes,” and the Scotch-Irish
were “Cohees.” It was just that kind of world.
Little wonder that the gangs formed up along
ethnic lines.
And the Sicilians of the newest gang, the “Black
Hand,” were the “Guineas,” the “Wops,” and the
“Mustache Petes,” based on a common news-
paper cartoon image that had been taken from a
photo of an arrested member — high stiff collar,
bowler hat, cropped hair, and an enormous mus-
tache. By 1910, they were outmaneuvering the
Irish gangs all over the Lower East Side.

Although the Kosher mob was pretty short-lived, it would leave an indelible
mark on the Italian Mafia, as will be seen in the stories of infamous Jewish
hoods like Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky.
Shadow of the Black Hand
The Black Hand, borne of the Sicilian immigrants, soon became the most
feared gang on the Lower East Side, putting the ruthless Irish mob in the
shade. Their favored method of punishment was called “barrel murder” —
shooting a victim or cutting his throat, then folding the body over into a
barrel and leaving it on a public street to be found by some innocent with a
blood-curdling scream that would create terror of the Black Hand in the
whole neighborhood.
The first two law-enforcement officers to start investigating these barrel mur-
ders were Joe Petrosino of the New York Police Department, one of the first
Sicilian-Americans on the force, and David Hennessey, the Police Chief of New
Orleans. They were both later assassinated by the Mafia (see “The Ongoing
Struggle to Crush the Mafia,” later in this chapter). Both men understood the
fact that the Black Hand was a sort of seafaring mob, very strong in the dock
neighborhoods of both cities, because there was a tie between the Black
Hand and the Mafia back home in Sicily that was growing stronger as time
passed. It’s interesting to note that during this period, in newspaper reports,
the word “Mafia” was used, perhaps for the first time in America, rather than
the more popular term “Black Hand.”
All the gangs of the Lower East Side made money the same way, from 
extortion, gambling, theft, and prostitution. But the forces of Puritanism in
American were about to unleash a constitutional amendment that would
make millionaires out of these young Italian toughs (called picciotti), literally
overnight.
Prohibition and the birth of the Rackets
Prohibition was the common name for the Eighteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, which went into effect in America in 1920, and made it illegal to
transport or manufacture liquor. It was the first time an amendment took
away a freedom rather than protecting one, the result of an incessant 20-year
din on the part of the Anti-Saloon League, the Women’s Temperance
Movement, and a lot of other loud killjoys.
275
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

The fantasy was that everyone would just stop drinking if you made it 
illegal. It’s the same waltz these days with cigarettes. And, in both cases, it’s 
a dizzy dance in circles, because it’s based on a false assumption. What really
happens when you make something as popular as drinking illegal is that the
average Joe loses respect for the law; most people would rather keep on
drinking and break the law.
Mob bosses laid awake at night dreaming about this kind of situation. The
Mafia and organized crime established itself as an empire because of
Prohibition, making untold millions off America’s thirst for beer and booze.
They either made their liquor here, in hidden breweries and distilleries, or
they imported the more expensive brand-name liquor, smuggling it in from
Canada, Mexico, and Europe.
The infamous Chicago gangster Al Capone was fond of pointing out that there
was nothing in the law about drinking liquor. This little catch was cleaned up
with the passage of the Volstead Act, the federal Prohibition act that gave the
government powers to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment.
Actually, the “speakeasies,” the most common name for a hidden, illegal bar,
had an enormous social impact on the period. Jazz, America’s most impor-
tant contribution to music, was born there. In some places speakeasies were
called “blind pigs,” because of a colorful way around the law against selling
liquor that sprang up. The innkeeper charged you to see some sort of exhibit
or unusual animal, then the booze was complimentary. The Irish sometimes
called speakeasies “shebeens,” which was the word in the old country for a
pub that operated on the sly without a license. These places were lively and
fun, and became the backbone of American social and clubbing life in the
roaring 1920s.
276

Making a racket
Did you ever wonder where the term “the rack-
ets” came from? Well, even if you didn’t we’re
going to tell you. In the grand old days of the Five
Points gangs, the gangsters used to hold dances
to raise money and to have a good time. They
sold tickets to these dances, and being gang-
sters, would often use a bit of a strong arm to get
people to buy them. In those wild pre-Prohibition
days, these dances got very rowdy, and the noise
was deafening; cops got constant complaints
about all the racket. And somehow, as happens
with slang, the rackets and “racketeering” came
to be a term not just for the dances themselves,
but for the methods the gangs used to sell the
tickets. In later years, the tickets being sold as
part of the “numbers racket” weren’t to a dance.
The classic numbers racket was like a lottery.
The bets could be on any set of numbers; one of
the most common was what the last four num-
bers of the close of the Dow would be that day.
People would bet small amounts, like a nickel,
but when they won, they won big. It was a very
lucrative business.

Reprieve! Open up the taps
Franklin Roosevelt made himself beloved, not just to Democrats but to all
Americans, when he finally got the 21st Amendment passed in 1933, the only
time a constitutional amendment (the hated 18th) was repealed by another.
Well, he made everyone happy except the gangsters, who saw untold millions
going out the window with every legal bar and liquor store that opened.
Actually, many a rumrunner, even some of the most powerful of the gang-
sters, simply retired with the money or used it to open legitimate businesses.
But for the hard-core Mafiosos, those millions would have to be replaced, and
eventually of course, they were, by the traffic in heroin and other drugs.
The war between the wars
Between World War I and World War II, the period of the 1920s and the 1930s,
several Mafia wars broke out in New York, as the money poured in, and 
dons of the various families began jockeying to be the Capo dei capi, more
commonly the Capo di Tutti Capi, the Boss of Bosses, the most powerful and
influential of the dons. There was so much money in bootlegging, that too
many bosses wanted to run the whole show. Eventually it broke into two
major factions: Salvatore Maranzano and Joe “the Boss” Masseria. (For much,
much more on mob lingo, see the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book.)
It was called the Castellamarese War, a very bloody struggle between 
the older West Sicily families of the Castellamarese area represented by
Maranzano and the Young Turks under Masseria. Maranzano felt he was the
big boss, because he had ties to Don Vito Cascio Ferro in Sicily, the Boss of
Bosses (69 arrests, no convictions), who’d helped to found the Black Hand in
New York before being deported. As usual with Mafia wars, the hits and the
retaliatory hits and the boomerang-back-at-you hits drug on for a couple of
years, killing business for everyone.
Charles “Lucky” Luciano was of the Masseria faction, the biggest bootlegger
in New York. He ran a class operation, with imported brand-name liquor,
instead of bathtub gin and wood alcohol hooch. He felt the war had to stop.
Boss Masseria was going paranoid, and he’d tried to have Luciano killed. So
Luciano hit Masseria and made peace with Maranzano. But it didn’t last long.
The old man from Castellamarese was still itching for a fight, and when his
close friend Meyer Lansky told Lucky that now Maranzano had a hit out on
him, Lucky took him out, as well. Luciano found himself the last man stand-
ing, the capo di tutti capi, whether he wanted it or not.
No Luciano on the Marquee
Luciano decided there should never again be any such thing in New York as a
“Boss of Bosses.” There would be a new way, like the Cupola in Sicily, a board
of families. It’s true that none of the Five Families of New York ever bore the
name of Luciano (see “The Big Five of the Commission,” later in the chapter).
Nevertheless, he was the man who founded them, leaving his mark on 
Mafia history.
277
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

The very phrase Cosa Nostra, the term for the Mafia preferred by insiders,
was coined by Lucky Luciano. It simply means “our thing,” or “our affair.” The
story goes that at the first meeting of the new five Mafia families, Lucky
Luciano decreed that there would no longer be a “Boss of Bosses” — all the
members would be equal. When he was asked what this new commission
would be called, he shot back, “No names. Give it a name, and you give them
something to come after. This is just our thing, our private thing.” And so an
infamous name, Cosa Nostra, was born. Luciano’s two biggest allies within
the Mafia were Frank Costello and Vito Genovese. Though the family founded
by Luciano would be called the Genovese Family, Vito would not wrest con-
trol for many years from Frank Costello, the dapper and clever gangster
called the Prime Minister of the Commission. But both men had been set up
in business by Luciano. Outside of the Mafia, Lucky had two close friends,
Bugsy Siegel, and his closest friend of all, Meyer Lansky, both of the Kosher
mob. Luciano was making a staggering amount of money as a bootlegger, and
he wasn’t about to let another pointless war destroy his empire. He imple-
mented ideas from many sources when he created the Commission, and
though he was only one more member, it wasn’t healthy to get in his way.
Legend has it that Lanskey and Seigel set up for Luciano a contract killing
firm, Murder, Incorporated, to get rid of any of Lucky’s dangerous enemies
(for more on Murder, Inc., see Chapter 12).
Some of America’s most infamous Prohibition gangsters were not in the Mafia.
That’s why, as a whole, it was called organized crime. The Mafia was only
interested in drafting young men with familiar bloodlines from the old coun-
try. And because Sicily had no more murderous sociopaths per capita than
any other place on earth, they got to be pretty choosy. But America’s most
famous gangster of all, Al Capone, wasn’t in the Mafia. He was an Italian,
whose family hailed from Naples on the mainland, and he was a leader of
organized crime, but not of the Mafia. Capone’s operation was called the
Chicago Outfit, and was sometimes allied with the New York Mafia. But
Capone was an equal opportunity employer; he’d hire anyone for the Outfit,
so long as they did their job well. In fact, he ran his empire a lot like Donald
Trump, except that if you screwed up, he didn’t fire you. He just beat you to
death with a baseball bat. But still, he wasn’t a Mafioso. Apart from the big
Five Families, Luciano also pulled together 26 other families and organiza-
tions, like the Jewish mob, into a National Crime Syndicate, all working
together for the good of the whole. Various other Mafia families were given
other territories, like the Scarfos in Philadelphia, for example.
Lucky’s connections
Lucky Luciano paid lip service to all the Sicilian mob stuff, but in truth had
little patience with it. After all, he had a Jew as his closest friend; as boys,
Luciano and Meyer Lansky had worked the streets together. The two met
when Lucky and some of his gang tried to shake down the small and soft-
spoken Lansky. His defiant and gutsy but unprintable reply endeared him to
Luciano, and they became friends at once. It was the closest friendship in the
history of the mob, and through it the Jewish Lansky would gain great power
in the Mafia.
278
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

As Jews, Meyer Lansky and his partner in crime, Ben “Bugsy” Siegel, were 
forbidden membership in the Mafia, but they had their own smaller Jewish
mob going. Their organization even had its own lingo; for example, their
muscle enforcers weren’t piciotto; they were schtarka, Yiddish for someone
who’s a climber. Even the word “shamus” for a private detective that was so
popular with writers like Micky Spillane and Raymond Chandler, had its roots
in the Yiddish word shammus, which was a caretaker in a synagogue. Later it
came to mean a guard in the organization.
Luciano helped out their new gang and made friends with Siegel, although he
found Bugsy’s fits of temper unnerving; after all, the man was called “Bugsy”
for being crazy as a bed bug. Prohibition made these three young toughs
major underworld players. And Lucky Luciano was “the connection,” the man
who made it possible for his two closest cohorts, both outsiders, to be
powers within the Mafia.
Luciano goes up the river
For Meyer Lansky, rising mob star, the toughest blow was when he ultimately
lost Lucky Luciano. And the irony is that Luciano was put away by a man
whose life he saved.
Thomas Dewey, “the Racket Buster,” became fixated on putting Luciano, the
big fish, behind bars. Dewey was a high-profile crime fighter, and he tried to
nail one of Luciano’s men, Dutch Schultz, on tax evasion. Despite getting off,
Schultz became obsessed with killing Dewey. When nothing Luciano could do
would stop him, he had no choice but to put out a hit on Schultz in order to
save Dewey and keep the wrath of God from coming down on the Commission.
Dewey knew this fact. Yet, when he couldn’t get Lucky on a legitimate charge,
he finally nailed Luciano on a trumped-up charge of running a prostitution
ring. Luciano was sentenced to 30 years in prison, which seems awfully
harsh. Yet, it’s said that he continued to run his empire from his prison cell,
thanks to the loyalty of his friends on the Commission and his closer friends
like Lansky outside of it. (After World War II, in gratitude for his services to
the government during the war, the absurd 30-year sentence was commuted,
and Luciano was deported to Sicily.)
The shift from booze to dice
Even with Luciano in jail, the plan remained the same — find new sources of
income to take the place of bootlegging. And the idea for that source came
from Saratoga Springs, in upstate New York. The mob often vacationed there
in August, when the racetrack was open. The horsey high-society types loved
it, and when the track closed at six, the gangsters rented the nearby grand
Saratoga Lake homes and turned them into party-house casinos throughout
the high-flying month. There was great food, star-studded floor shows, and
gambling until the wee hours.
279
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

In Saratoga Springs, Lansky saw a vision of another kind of money pot. He
noticed that, unlike the smoky back-room poker games and gambling dives of
New York, here the men brought their wives and girlfriends, because there
was so much for them to do. And the women started playing the tables, as
well, meaning everybody stayed longer and bet more. The dream took hold of
him of building a mob-owned palace in a mob-dominated place, somewhere
far from racket-buster Thomas Dewey in New York, somewhere that gambling
was legal year-round, where he could re-create this same atmosphere. The
gambling had to be honest; nothing drove the big players away faster than
any whiff of a “bust-out joint,” where the games were fixed. And it had to be
luxurious in feel, with great food and shows.
Both Lansky and Siegel were sent out to scout for gambling businesses.
Lansky did it quietly and carefully, and Siegel did it with enough noise to be
heard back in New York.
Cuban Pete with the rumba beat
Lansky started in Florida, in a few municipalities where gambling was legal.
But Cuba soon beckoned. It was an easy destination, less than 100 miles off
the Florida coast, and it was already a hotspot for playboy and Hollywood
types. And best of all, not only was gambling legal in this American posses-
sion, but also the president, Fulgencio Batista, walked around with a big “For
Sale” sign on his back. Cuban music was hot, and Cuba was often featured in
the movies as an exotic locale.

Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 
The Valachi Papers
Part of the inspiration for the RICO Act and bul-
letproof witness protection came out of the tes-
timony of the first, and the most famous, Mafia
rat of all time — Joe Valachi. His story spawned
both a popular book and a movie. The Witness
Protection Program was created because the
FBI knew they would never be able to prosecute
the bosses who gave the orders unless they
could shatter the Omertà, the Code of Silence. In
Valachi’s case, the FBI used good old-fashioned
head games. Godfather Vito Genovese, in a coup
for the government, had been sent to a federal
prison for heroin trafficking. Joe Valachi, one of
his soldiers, was in the same jail with him. The
FBI played a little game with Genovese — 
they kept calling Valachi in for long sessions of
questioning, again and again. Valachi sat for two
hours and more, saying nothing. But the ploy
worked, because after awhile, nobody, including
Vito Genovese, believed Valachi wasn’t singing
to the feds.
Finally, one day in the prison cafeteria, Genovese
grabbed Valachi and gave him the “kiss of
death,” sealing his doom. Valachi, with nowhere
else to turn, took the feds up on their offer. When
Valachi testified before Congress on national
television in 1963 for the McClellan hearings, the
whole country was riveted by his stories of the rit-
uals and secrets of la Cosa Nostra. It sent the FBI
out on a 30-year crusade against organized crime
that would be, for the most part, successful.

The mob couldn’t dump money into the Havana casinos fast enough. But it all
came crashing down around their heads on New Year’s Eve of 1958. Batista
had been fighting the forces of the revolutionary Fidel Castro since early fall,
but he’d blown it badly. That night, Castro came rolling into Havana, and the
wise guys all hopped on the next plane back to Florida. Castro declared the
casinos government property, and promptly made gambling illegal. (This mess
was the cause of the most believable conspiracy theory concerning Sam
Giancana, the Mafia, and the assassination of JFK. For more, see Chapter 5.)
Bugsy Siegel and the founding of modern Las Vegas
While Meyer Lansky was busy keeping a low profile and doing his job, Bugsy
Siegel was making a splash in Hollywood. He ran with the “in” crowd, and his
closest friend was superstar George Raft. The ladies loved Bugsy; he was the
most charming and handsome psychopath to ever rat-a-tat-tat a Tommy gun.
And when he met mob tramp and actress wannabee Virginia Hill, the
romance caught fire. But Bugsy was still out West to do a job, and he’d fixed
his eyes on a new potential source of gambling riches.
Nevada was the only state in the union that had legalized gambling. And 
way, way off the beaten track, was a little tourist trap called Las Vegas, with
tiny casinos done up to look like the background for a Roy Rogers movie. Its
location in the southernmost tip of Nevada made it very convenient to Los
Angeles by air. The Chicago Outfit was already considering buying up some of
these casinos, but Bugsy found a bigger dream, when he discovered that a
gambler and builder named Billie Wilkerson was constructing a large, modern
casino, but was out of cash. Bugsy muscled in, and the dream of the Flamingo
was born.
Unfortunately, Bugsy was a great killer, but a lousy businessman. He was per-
sistently being double and even triple billed, and costs were soaring, while the
opening date loomed. Unwisely, he stuck by his announced Christmas Eve
1946 open, and it was a disaster. The rooms weren’t finished, none of his big
stars showed up because of a storm that kept them from flying, and all the
shoddy construction kept causing problems for guests and staff. The whole
thing was supposed to cost $1 million; Bugsy had already spent $4 million.
The last straw came when Bugsy and Virginia were caught skimming off the
top. Mob casinos always took some off the top in the counting rooms, before
the money was banked and seen by the IRS. But this glittering pair, apparently
believing they could get away with anything, had skimmed a couple million for
themselves. Bugsy had signed his own death warrant, and even Meyer Lansky
couldn’t stop it.
Siegel was gunned down through a plate glass window while staying in Virginia
Hill’s mansion in Beverly Hills. Virginia may have been warned not to be 
there. Even though he was shot from behind, the bullets, chillingly enough,
came through his eyes, those deadly blue eyes that the ladies had found so
irresistible.
281
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

The FBI, RICO, and the 
Decline of the Mafia
With the death of Bugsy Siegel, much of the glamour went out of the Mafia.
The last nail in that coffin came in 1951 with the Kefauver Senate hearings 
into organized crime. The godfathers didn’t seem quite so distant and 
forbidding when they could be drug before a senate subcommittee by one
little subpoena. By the 1970s, the FBI declared war on the Mafia, and the 
new federal anti-Mafia laws, particularly the RICO Act (Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act), made it awfully difficult for the mob to do
business.
The RICO Act basically provides additional federal charges and gives stiffer
sentences to those who persistently commit the same crime over the course
of a ten-year period in what is deemed by the attorney general to be a “racke-
teering” pattern. Up until then, mobsters had defended themselves in court by
declaring there was no such thing as organized crime. But after a RICO indict-
ment, the government can seize the assets of this non-existent activity.
Although it’s been used on everyone from abortion protesters to stockbro-
kers, the law is written with the Mafia in mind. It’s there to nail the godfathers,
not just the soldiers. Wiretapping and patient surveillance were the FBI’s chief
weapons. As part of a one-two punch with the Witness Protection Program,
the old days of the Mafia’s way of doing business, at least in America, have
been torpedoed.
The Big Five Families of the Commission
In this section, we cover the Five Families of the New York Mafia, families
whose names live on, even in cases where the founder’s bloodline is long
dead. These Families were established by 1931, each one named for the
Capofamiglia, the don of each Family.
282
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 
What’s in a name?
As with all Mafiosi, Joe Bonanno had a nick-
name, Joe “Bananas” Bonanno, and, as with all
Mafiosi, he hated it. You didn’t call Ben Siegel
“Bugsy” to his face, not if you wanted to live
through dinner. But the Mafia is very fond of
saying that it’s a business like any other. So, what
if other businesses were like this? Would you
have Bugsy “the Enforcer” Gates running
Microsoft, or Steve “the Mechanic” Jobs at
Apple? How about Dave “the Burnoose” Lesar
at Halliburton, or Rex “the Valdez” Tillerson at
Exxon. After all, Ted “Crackers” Turner of CNN
once challenged Rupert “Crocodile Dundee”
Murdoch to a public boxing match to settle their
feud. Maybe corporate American isn’t so differ-
ent from the Mafia after all.

Unfortunately, we don’t have enough room in this single chapter for the juicy
stories within each Family of wars for control, peaces brokered, and assassi-
nations, not to mention the shifting alliances among the five. They played out
like a Greek tragedy, more like a movie than real life. In other words, it’s not
surprising that five Mafia bosses, not to mention all their underbosses, would
be in a constant state of plotting and scheming against one another in various
combinations.
The Gambino Family
The Gambino family was founded by one Vincent Mangano, who had all the
usual rackets: unions, loan sharking, gambling, and prostitution. Carlo
Gambino and Paul Castellano were powerful lieutenants in the family. After a
period of murder and mayhem, Carlo Gambino got rid of the biggest psychos
and took over. He became the most powerful leader of the Five Families in 
the 1960s. At Gambino’s death in 1976, control of the powerful family passed
to his brother-in-law Paul Castellano. At this time, John Gotti was merely a
comer, a muscle mobster under Castellano, but really on the crew of another
faction of the family under a capo named Dellacroce, an enemy of
Castellano’s.
By the late 1970s, the FBI had targeted the Gambino Family big time. They
bugged Castellano’s house and caught him on tape discussing some highly
illegal family business. In the early 1980s, he was up on charges, and it looked
like the old man was going to the hoosegow. Castellano had already named
his old friend and ally Thomas Gambino, Carlo’s son, as his successor. But in
1983, the poop hit the fan when 13 of the Gambino Family were arrested by
the FBI for drug trafficking, including John Gotti’s brother Gene, and his best
friend Angelo “Quack Quack” Ruggiero. (Quack Quack? Can you imagine 
getting the job of having to whack Quack Quack?) With the death from cancer
of Castellano’s main family rival, Aniello Dellacroce, Gotti saw the vacuum,
and decided to act fast. On December 16, when Castellano was headed for a
dinner meeting at Spark’s Steak House, he was gunned down in the street by
four men. Gotti was now head of the Gambino Family.
Unfortunately, Gotti was a new style Mafioso, all brash vanity and braggado-
cio. The FBI wanted him bad on that account. After a long and unprecedented
battle and a series of trials, the FBI got Sammy “the Bull” Gravano, a long-time
Gotti associate, to turn state’s evidence, and the Teflon Don went to the 
slammer, where he died of cancer in 2002. John Junior took over for a time,
until he was sent up the river, as well. The war against the FBI had turned the
once-mighty Gambino Family to a shadow of its former self. What’s left of it is
presently being run, so it’s said, jointly by Nicholas “Little Nick” Corozzo and
John “Jackie Nose” D’Amico. They are both, needless to say, keeping a very
low profile.
283
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

The Genovese Family
This is the family founded by Lucky Luciano and his close associate, Frank
Costello, who ran it for many years until his retirement after an attempt on
his life made by Vito Genovese. The family is named for Genovese, who had
been one of the founders, with Frank Costello and Lucky Luciano. But in the
1930s, Genovese was indicted for murder and fled to Italy. Costello took over.
Years later, after World War II, Vito Genovese returned, beat the murder rap,
and began fighting to topple Costello, who by that time was just as happy to
retire and hand it over to him. Along with the numbers rackets, one of the
Gambino specialties was buying up politicians and judges. Longtime boss
Frank Costello was called “the Prime Minister of the Underworld.” He also put
the Family into the legitimate liquor import business. In the style of their
founder Luciano, the Genovese Family is probably the most tightly run in
New York, and the one that draws the least press. Nevertheless, when Joe
Valachi, a Genovese soldier, broke Omertà and testified before the McClellan
hearings, it ratcheted up a 20-year FBI fever to bring the Family down.
They’ve had a number of damaging successes. Genovese was nailed for drug
dealing in 1959, and died in prison in 1969.
The most colorful boss of the later period was definitely Vincent “the Chin”
Gigante, dubbed “the Oddfather.” Like most Genoveses, he kept a high level
of secrecy about operations. But his favorite trick for getting out of trouble
with the Feds was to act as if he’d gone nuts. He was always pleading insan-
ity. He liked to walk around Greenwich Village in his pajamas and slippers,
pretending to talk to himself. It worked for years. The present don is proba-
bly Mario Gigante, brother of “the Chin,” though he’s in his 80s and probably
at least semi-retired. If he wanders around in his PJs and talks to himself,
there’s a reason. Daniel Leo is probably the acting boss. No one knows for
sure, because the Genoveses are keeping a very, very low profile.
The Colombo Family
The Colombo Family was founded by Joe Profaci and once known as the
Profaci Family. Giuseppe “Joe” Profaci was an old-fashioned Sicilian Mafioso
in the worst sense, hated by many for his heavy-handed use of taxes and
tithes on family members. Those soldiers who didn’t pay into his slush fund,
which was supposedly for the families of dead or imprisoned family mem-
bers, ended up dead themselves. Many dons lived surprisingly simple lives,
but Profaci liked to live large, making himself a target. In the 1950s, the Feds
went after him big time with their usual mob weapons, charges of tax eva-
sion, and threats of deportation, but he died of liver cancer in 1962 before
any punishments were inflicted.
284
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Because Profaci was so hated, his family was often torn by internal strife and
takeover attempts. After a 1961 internal war, Joe Colombo was named head of
the new Colombo Family. He was young, only 41, and did several things to
annoy his fellows on the Commission, including forming the Italian-American
Civil Rights League. It made him far too public, and at a League event in 1971,
he was shot as he stepped up to the podium. He lingered in a coma for eight
years before he died. Internal strife weakened the family; it is now run from
prison by Carmine Persico, one more casualty of the RICO Act.
The Lucchese Family
The Lucchese Family was founded by Gaetano “Tommy” Gagliano and his
underboss Gaetano “Tommy Brown” Lucchese. After the death of Gagliano in
1953, his loyal underboss Lucchese took over. He had a reputation for making
big money (including interests in trucking and the Teamsters) while keeping
a low profile much admired by the Commission. In 44 years, he was never
once charged with a crime. After his death, the Family wasn’t so lucky, and
several members went down over the infamous “French Connection” heroin
busts. The next boss, Tony “Ducks” Corallo also fell victim to FBI bugs and
the RICO laws. Once again, the family is officially being run by 72-year-old
Don Vic Amuso from his prison cell, while his street boss Aniello Migliore
attempts to bring some stability back to the operation.
The Bonanno Family
The Bonanno Family was founded by Joseph (Giuseppe) Bonanno, a Sicilian
immigrant from the town of Castellammare del Golfo, in the westernmost
region of Sicily called the province of Trapani. He left Sicily at the age of 26
during Mussolini’s crackdown on the Mafia, taking his young wife and new-
born son Salvatore (Bill) to America. Bill is often seen as a mythic figure, the
conflicted Sicilian-American mobster who starting out wanting to run the
legitimate end of the family business, and ended up being drawn into the
Mafia by deep ties of honor and obligation. In 1956, he married the innocent
young Rosalie Profaci, a royal Mafia marriage between the Bonanno and
Colombo families.
We probably know more about the inner workings and personalities within
the Bonanno Family than any other. First came Gay Talese’s groundbreaking
1971 book, Honor Thy Father, which was the story of the Bonanno family 
and their everyday life. Then came the autobiography of Rosalie Bonanno,
followed by autobiographies written in retirement by Bill Bonanno, and by
his father Joseph, the paterfamilias. Code of Silence or no Code of Silence,
this is a family that likes getting things off its collective chest.
285
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

Welcome to the Family! Mafia Rituals
A lot of hogwash has been written over the years about the rituals and initia-
tion rites of the Mafia. But this section explains the real ritual of admission 
to the Mafia that’s come to light slowly over the course of the last 40 years,
ever since Joe Valachi made a few references to it in his testimony before
Congress. Tommasso Buscetta added more details when he told the tale of
his initiation to Sicilian mob-buster Giovanni Falcone after his extradition
from Brazil. Minor differentiations exist, but the core of it remains the same,
both in Sicily and America.
The hard part isn’t the ritual itself; you don’t have to memorize reams of
ritual phrases and responses. The hard part is getting there. Generally, you
have to bloody your hands, particularly if you weren’t born into the family.
Here’s an outline of the general process:
1. The candidate, or neophyte (which is a phrase from Christian history
for a man entering the faith), is brought to a darkened, candle-lit
room, where the don of the family is sitting in dignified silence.
2. Depending on the time and the people involved, various symbolic
items may be laid out on the table before him.
These items can include a knife and a gun, a photograph of the founder
of the don’s family, or other symbols important to the Big Guy.
3. The neophyte is accompanied by at least three “men of honor” within
the Family; the oldest of them reminds the candidate that he’s been
brought into the Family’s house to protect the weak from the strong.
Right.
4. The oldest man of honor cuts the finger of the neophyte (or sometimes
the don does the cutting) and then presents him with a sacred image,
usually a saint card.
The saint card was popular in the Catholic Church in the last century;
they contained a representation of the saint, usually a reprint from one
of the old masters, and the story of the saint on the back. This pricking
of the finger is why the whole ceremony is sometimes called Punciuto,
from the root for the verb pricked.
5. The neophyte then smears the card with his blood and sets it on fire.
The candidate must hold the card in his hands as it burns. After the card
turns to ashes, the neophyte swears before the silent don, “May my flesh
burn like this saint if I fail to keep my oath.”
The oath he’s speaking of is the oath of Omertà, which was explained in
the opening of this chapter. This sacred oath of silence is the most
important one a member of the Mafia will ever take. Even if you or your
loved ones are the victims of someone within the Family, you will never
betray its secrets, and you will never cooperate with the authorities, or
286
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

any other outsiders, in betraying what you know of the organization. It
can be a heavy oath to bear. For example, if you’re ratted out and sent to
the slammer for a crime that someone else in the Family committed,
you’re expected to serve your time and keep your mouth shut. To break
this sacred oath is a death sentence.
The mob bosses were devout Catholics in their fashion, and the records of
their crimes are loaded with their idea of proof. Joe Colombo was given a
jewel-studded crown stolen from a Brooklyn church. He ordered it returned,
and when the thief kept three of the jewels, Colombo ordered him murdered,
left with a rosary around his neck. Joe Profaci had two petty thieves tortured
to death for robbing a Catholic donation box.
The Ongoing Struggle to Crush the Mafia
The great divide in dialects, culture, and economic wealth that separated
Sicily from mainland Italy still resonates into the 21st century. Today Sicily is
considered to be a part of Italy, although after the fall of Mussolini, in 1947, it
was granted a special autonomous status, meaning that in many respects, it’s
now a country of its own. This left the problem of dealing with the dons to
the local magistrates. They would soon discover that the code of Omertà
combined with Mafia ruthlessness would make this a tall order.
As a magistrate, cop, or judge in Sicily, you were either on the Mafia’s payroll,
or you were in their gun sights. The hundreds of funerals for magistrates who
didn’t play by these rules that darkened the late 19th and early 20th century
bore silent witness to the power of la Cosa Nostra.
Ever since 1903, police in New York and New Orleans have known there was
an “Atlantic pipeline,” a tie between Sicilian crime in the U.S. and Palermo.
But what the Americans were too naïve to understand was the absolute
power of the dons over Sicily. An American cop named Joe Petrosino
famously walked right into Sicily without understanding this fact of life.
Taking the fight back to Sicily
As the Sicilian gang influence became powerful in New York (see the section,
“Mafia and Organized Crime in America,” earlier in this chapter), Joe Petrosino
convinced his superiors that they needed a special Italian squad — officers
who knew the language and the methods of the Mafia. It was created, and he
was promoted to lieutenant in charge in 1908. He had many successes with
solving murders and kidnappings. He even protected the world-renowned
opera singer Enrico Caruso, when the Black Hand, the early Mafia, attempted
to extort money from him.
287
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

Petrosino soon figured out that to bring down Sicilian gangs like the Black
Hand in the U.S., he had to start at the source. And so, in March of 1909, he
went to Sicily undercover to investigate. He arrived on March 9, and checked
into a Palermo hotel under the name Guglielmo De Simini. On March 12, he
was waiting, unarmed, to meet a contact in the Piazza Marina, when two men
gunned him down in the street. He was killed instantly. For Americans, it was
a shock and an outrage; in Palermo, there was hardly a ripple. For a Sicilian,
this death was to be expected for someone who openly opposed the Mafia.
All through the 1960s, during the so-called First Mafia War in Sicily, it was
open season on honest government officials. Even by the 1980s, there were
two kinds of magistrates in Sicily: the Mafia ones, and the dead ones. This
was the period of the Second Mafia War, when the Corleonese Family, who
weren’t even in the Cupola, tried to take over the heroin trade by literally
declaring war on both the government and all the other Mafia families. It was
a bloodbath. Led by a little maniac named Toto Riina, nicknamed “the Beast,”
the violence level reached an all-time high, both in numbers and in gruesome-
ness. No more bullet to the back of the head. Now it was chain saws and tor-
ture murders. No more leaving the family alone. Riina killed them all, and if he
could get hold of their children, he killed them, too.
It seems strange that when director Francis Ford Coppola set out to make 
his classic The Godfather, he chose the name of “Corleone” for his character.
Corleone is a real place, a small town in the Province of Palermo in north-
western Sicily. In fact, the family of the film’s lead, Al Pacino, immigrated 
from there. But it’s strange because, in the real history of the Sicilian Mafia,
the Corleonese of Toto Riinawere brash outsiders who flooded Sicily in a sea
of blood.
Two real “men of honor”
After the death of so many officials over the years, it might seem that the
Sicilian people were shockproof, but it wasn’t so. During this second period
of bloody Mafia violence in the 1980s, a very brave Sicilian magistrate
stepped up to the plate to take on the Cosa Nostra. His name was Giovanni
Falcone, and he formed a task force of prosecutors to bring the Mafia down.
His closest friend from childhood was named Paulo Borsellino, a fellow 
attorney, and Falcone drafted him into the battle as his second-in-command.
For more than a decade, they had one spectacular success after another.
The most famous success was called “the Maxi Trial” for the incredibly large
number of defendants. A staggering 474 defendants were put on trial; 119 of
them, who’d escaped, were tried in absentia. Falcone finally got a mobster to
turn informant — a powerful man extradited from Brazil named Tommaso
Buscetta, who’d lost many close family members. Under Falcone’s expert
handling, Buscetta started to sing. The Maxi Trial was the result. Until that
time, the very existence of the Mafia had been either denied or downplayed
288
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

by officials who were in its pocket. Falcone was the first to name them openly
for who and what they were.
The trial took two years to pull off. In the end, 360 of the defendants were
convicted, a great victory for Italian justice. The state seemed to be winning
the war. In fact, it was Falcone’s naming of the Mafia as an organization, and
his trying of them as a whole, rather than as individuals for individual crimes,
that inspired U.S. officials in the same fight to draft the successful RICO Act.
(See “The Valachi Papers” earlier in this chapter.)
In the beginning, the people around him held their breath, waiting for Falcone
to be assassinated. But as the years passed, it seemed that a golden glow of
good luck surrounded the man. On May 23, 1992, that luck ran out. Falcone
landed at Palermo airport with his wife, and then drove in a caravan of 
three cars toward the capital city at high speed, in case of sniper attack. 
A Mafia lookout spotted them with binoculars outside Capaci and picked up 
a cell phone. Moments later, a shattering explosion from about 400 kegs of
explosives laid into hidden roadside trenches and drain pipes took out a
huge section of the highway. It left an enormous, debris-filled crater. Giovanni
Falcone was killed, along with his wife, Francesca Morvillo, who was also a
magistrate, as well as three of his police escort bodyguards.
Many Sicilian officials said that the only parallel in feeling in America
would’ve been the death of JFK. The entire nation of Italy was steeped in
mourning for its hero. But there would be no time to put away the black
dresses and suits before they were needed again. On July 19, less than two
months later, Falcone’s successor, Paulo Borsellino, was killed. He went to
ring the bell at his mother’s apartment house in Palermo to pick her up for 
a doctor’s appointment. At that pre-arranged signal, an enormous car bomb
nearby exploded. The shock could be felt for miles — windows were broken
in the apartment building 11 floors up. Borsellino was killed instantly, along
with five of his bodyguards.
We’re mad as hell, and we’re not 
going to take it anymore!
The island of Sicily erupted, as grief turned to rage, and rage was taken 
to the streets. In many respects, from that moment, the Mafia’s days were
numbered, at least as a hidden society. No one was looking the other way
anymore. The Italian government sent thousands of troops to help the
Sicilian police and people wipe out the Mafia. Mafiosos fled the island like
rats out of a flooded drain. Finally, in 1998, the troops went home. The Mafia
was pronounced officially dead in Sicily.
289
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

So, is the Cosa Nostra really dead? It would seem that, apart from the new
mafia organizations in Italy, Cosa Nostra is still breathing. The president of
the Sicilian Region has been under investigation for Mafia ties, and another
investigation is looking into Mafia infiltration of the Forza Italia political party.
As Mark Twain said on reading his own obituary, “The reports of my death
are greatly exaggerated.”
Other Mafias, Lost and Found
“Mafia” is one of those words like “Kleenex” or “Coke,” in that the product
itself was long ago merged with the brand name in the public’s perception.
Yet, in the late 20th century, the word, which was coined by the international
press, was well chosen, because these copycat criminal organizations were
inspired by the Mafia, and often structured in the same pyramid pattern.
There have been many mafias through the years, some lost to history and
faded from memory. Others are relatively new, and are yet to achieve any
fame, particularly in America.
Apart from often having an international reach, these groups generally share
something else with the Mafia — their birth occurred during a time in which
the government was weak or virtually non-existent. In many cases it’s difficult
for American intelligence to gauge who’s really running the country — the
government or the forces of organized crime.
Going Italian
There are quite a few new Italian-based mafias active in the United States; 
the FBI refers to them as a whole as “IOC,” Italian Organized Crime. They’re
all involved in the same old Mafia-style operations: drug dealing, arms sales,
counterfeiting, smuggling of both goods and people, illegal gambling, 
kidnapping, blackmail, and extortion. They use the classic Mafia methods 
to maintain their power base — bribery, terror, and assassination.
The scary part about all these new Italian mafias is that they have such
chummy relations with all the other mafias in Russia, China, Eastern Europe,
and just about anywhere else on the planet. Here are the major “other 
Italian mafias.”
The Comorra
The Comorra reached its height of fame and power about the time the 
Mafia was getting big in Sicily, in the late 19th century. In fact, the Comorra
became so powerful in the area around Naples that the Borbón monarchs
drafted them into key positions in the police and the military, as well as the
civil service. Although they shared much with the Mafia, from thievery and
extortion to the code of Omertà, their big game was piracy.
290
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Like the Mafia, the Comorra survived the attempts of dictator Benito Mussolini
to stamp them out, but afterwards they were never again as powerful. In
America, the Comorra was absorbed by the powerful Morello crime family early
on, and so eventually into the American Mafia. However, it does make a point of
interest that the Comorra may be more powerful in Italy today than it was a cen-
tury ago. It seems that the Comorra muscled in on the garbage business in the
Campanian region of Italy, for which Naples is the capital. Unfortunately, they
ran it in typical Mafia fashion, ignoring laws about disposal, mixing in heavy
metals and chemical waste with garbage that is supposed to be free of such
things, and burning it when they were found out, causing very bad pollution
problems in the area. The government, as this is being written, is attempting to
bring the Comorra to heel over the problem, but it’s no mean feat.
The ’Ndrangheta
The ’Ndrangheta (which means The Honored Society) is little-known in this
country. They have ties to the Sicilian Mafia because of their geographic 
nearness — their central turf is in Calabria, the boot tip of Italy. Italian
authorities estimate about 5,000 members in 100 ’Ndrangheta clans around
Calabria. For their small number they’re remarkably wealthy, mostly from
drug money, but also from quasi-legitimate businesses in restaurants, super-
markets, and of course, that old mafia standby, the construction business.
(What is it about concrete and mobsters? Even Yasir Arafat was in the 
concrete business.)
They’re often called mafiosi in the press, but they’re known properly as
’ndrinu. Occasionally ’Ndrangheta groups will pop up far from home; outposts
have been discovered in Australia, France, Spain, and even Canada. But for
the most part, they’re a tighter-knit group than the Mafia, and they’ve done 
a better job of keeping a low profile.
The Sacra corona unita
The Sacra corona unita, or United Sacred Crown (aka the SCU), is a 
much newer mafialike organization in Apulia along the southern boot heel,
especially in Brindisi and Lecce. They’re principally smugglers, smuggling
Albanians into Italy (and into prostitution), as well as smuggling cigarettes,
drugs, and arms. There are about 50 clans and 2,000 members. They have 
ties to other mafia groups in Eastern Europe, as well as Russia and Columbia.
They also may have extended into Florida, Illinois, and New York.
The Stidda
The Stidda is another new mafia, born on the southeast coast of Italy, but
moving in on northern Italy, where mafia activity has historically been far less
prevalent. The reign of terror on Sicily brought about a general disenchant-
ment with Cosa Nostra, and many of the capos in this organization in particu-
lar are men who walked away during the Corleonese wars. For this reason,
the bloodthirsty Toto Riina not only waged war on all the families of Cosa
Nostra, but also on the Stidda, as well, killing over a thousand of them before
291
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

he was finally put away. The fact that they remained standing has given them
a great deal of respect as a mafia organization.
Stidda means “star” in the Sicilian dialect. Many members of the Stidda, the
stiddari, have a tattoo of five green marks in a circle that look like a star, the
symbol of their creed, i punti della malavita, or “the points of the criminal life.”
For this five-pointed symbol they’re also sometimes called “the Fifth Mafia.”
The Mala del Brenta
The Mala del Brenta, also called la Mafia del Brenta or Malavita del Brenta,
is the Venetian version of the Mafia. It’s a rare bird, being classified under
Italian law as a mafia-type organization, despite being operated by northern-
ers. Still, it was originally spawned in the south. For the last 20 years they’ve
been operating in the Veneto region of northern Italy, moving as far northeast
as Yugoslavia, Hungary, and other former Russian satellite nations.
But there are few areas of Italy more independent-minded than Venice; there
is, in fact, a strong political party there in favor of achieving a breakaway
status that has caused a lot of trouble in the last 20 years. So of course, the
name “mafia” wasn’t good enough; they had to have a name of their own for
essentially the same organization.
Going International
The last four decades have proved one thing for certain — you don’t have to
be Italian to have a mafia. Everybody, it seems, wants to be Don Corleone.
Below are the most prominent of the international mafia organizations:
 Russia should certainly get pride of place for the Russian Mafyia — also
called Bratva. Probably the most powerful mafia in the world, because
their emergence from the shadowy world of the Russian black market in
1991 occurred as the Soviet system was headed for a tumble. They are
now a worldwide operation, and according to an FBI agent assigned to
them, the Mafyia is far more ruthless than the American Mafia. Or, in his
words, “These guys’ll shoot you just to see if the gun works.” Russia
being a poor country, they like to live large, though at least they have a
sense of humor about it — several have big American cars with a horn
that plays the theme from The Godfather. The kingpins are never seen
without a bodyguard almost always in the uniform of dark pants and a
black leather bomber jacket. The Russian Mafyia’s success spawned
numerous mafias behind the former Iron Curtain, such as the Chechen
mafia and Albanian mafia. Their yearly profits are in the hundreds of 
millions, and their economic strength probably outstrips that of the
legitimate Soviet economy.
 Great Britain is overrun with London street gangs, some of whom have
become very powerful. The good old Irish mob, which still has major
292
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

teeth in Boston and New York, also operates there. Some of the mobs are
referred to by family names, the Brindles or the Daleys, but the most
powerful is purported to be the Adams Family, aka the Clerkenwell
Syndicate or the A-Team. Despite the fact that their boss, Terry Adams,
went to jail in 2007, and MI-5 is taking a page from the FBI playbook 
and monitoring every word they say, the A-Team is still a powerful
underworld society.
 France is still known for its Unione Corse, or Corsican underworld. Like
Napoleon, it was born on the island of Corsica of mostly Italian descent,
but moved up into Marseilles (still its principal stronghold) and the rest
of France. Unione Corse is most famous for its heroin trade, the infa-
mous French Connection of 1940–1972.
 Central America has numerous gangs, but the most powerful are proba-
bly the remnants of the Colombian drug lords, like the Black Eagles or
the Norte del Valle cartel, and the new kids on the block, called MS-13, a
ruthless secret organization dealing in drugs, forced prostitution, and
general nastiness that is moving up into the U.S.
 The Chinese Triads are very old underworld secret societies, initially
formed as a group of revolutionaries who wanted to overthrow the
Manchu Dynasty. When that task was completed, they had nothing else
to occupy their time, and so turned to crime. In America, the infamous
Chinese Tong considered themselves an offshoot of the Triads.
 Japan has one of the most colorful mafias, literally, with the Yakuza, the
famous tattoo-covered Japanese mobsters, with rituals like Yubitsume,
which is ritually cutting off a finger as penance. They deal in drugs,
extortion, and forced prostitution, particularly in Southeast Asia.
 Nigeria, last but not least, has set upon the world the irritation of the
Nigerian OC crime brotherhood, which has become a particular thorn 
in the side of Internet cruisers, because it’s hard to move through the
World Wide Web without being assaulted by one of their numerous
scams to get their hands on your private banking information.
The Impact of the Mafia 
on Popular Culture
The mob and the movies have had a symbiotic relationship for longer than
most people realize. And if you’re wondering what a symbiotic relationship is,
well, did you ever hear the story of the bird in Africa that rides around on a
rhinoceros’s back? The tickbird survives by eating ticks and other bugs off
the rhino’s back, and the rhino acts as the tickbird’s great big bodyguard.
This is a symbiotic relationship, and the mob has had one with the movies
since the birth of them both in America.
293
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

In the early years of the 20th century, the era of silent films, new immigrants
flocked to the movies — by 1907, roughly 200,000 of them attended one of
New York’s 500 movie houses every single day. Early gangsters loved going to
the movies as much as any other immigrants, and rather than being offended
by them, they loved gangster movies. They imitated the dress and the man-
nerisms of the actors who played them. And the movies loved to claim to be
putting the real story of gangsterism in America on film, scouring newspaper
stories for their plotlines, and making up the actors to look like newspaper
photographs of real Black Hand or other gang members. Musketeers of Pig
Alley, a D. W. Griffith film of 1912, was shot on location on the Lower East
Side, and promoters claimed that real gangsters had been used as extras 
and bit players, and had even served as technical advisors on the film’s big
gunfight sequence.
Close to 80 percent of the silent movies ever made are lost to historians.
That’s because they were shot on something called celluloid nitrate film stock,
which was, believe it or not, combustible. If you open up an old can of film,
the smell that hits you is unforgettable, not to mention the orange acid all
over the celluloid base that has literally eaten away the image. Occasionally,
these stored cans of film would self-ignite, causing a fire that could wipe out
hundreds of other films. Unfortunately, it wasn’t until the 1970s that universi-
ties and fans started getting into the business of film preservation, and by
that time, silent films were already lost.
Early gangster films
Despite the number of lost silents, the date on the oldest surviving gangster
film is still impressive — 1906. It was a one-reeler (a reel of film lasted ten
minutes) called The Black Hand, which tells the melodramatic tale of a shop-
keeper in New York who goes head to head with the Black Hand and gets his
little daughter kidnapped by them. It was based on newspaper reports at the
time on the activities of the Black Hand in the Five Points, though of course,
it has a happy ending, with a triumph of justice over lawlessness. It was so
popular it was remade three times soon after. And the symbiotic relationship
was already unfolding, because members of the Black Hand started dressing
and wearing their hair like the classic “Mustache Pete” portrayed in the film.
By the early 1920s, movies were getting a little more sophisticated and less
obsessed with a happy ending. When Lon Chaney played gangster Big Mike in
the 1920’s Outside the Law, real gangsters aped his mannerisms and looks. Yet
the great age of movie gangsters didn’t even occur until the arrival of the
talkies. These gritty and hard-edged dramas came just on the heels of sound
in 1929, and they were masterpieces still treasured today. It made stars out of
some very unlikely Warner Brothers contract players, but the public couldn’t
get enough of Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, and the ultimate gang-
ster pinup, James Cagney. It’s a testament to Cagney’s talent that he was able
to survive being typecast, because he defined the consummate American
294
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

mobster in such films as The Public Enemy, The Roaring Twenties, and White
Heat. The same was true of Edward G. Robinson, whose talent kept him from
staying forever the bad guy after unforgettable performances at the dawn of
sound in Outside the Law, Little Caesar, and a bit later in films like The Last
Gangster and Key Largo.
The weird symbiosis continued as filmmakers struggled to do gangsters that
were realistic, while the gangsters were picking up the clothing, slang, and
mannerisms of the mobsters they saw on film.
The Godfather myth cycle
Joe Valachi appeared before Congress in 1963. Next came The Valachi Papers
in 1968, the true story of the mob informant. The book was a very big hit.
Then, on its heels, came Mario Puzo and The Godfather, in 1969. This was the
smash novel of all time, and Mob mania was about to take hold of the country.
Puzo considered it a pity that his first book on the subject of Sicilian immi-
grants, The Fortunate Pilgrim, was respected, but not a hit. It was the story of
his immigrant mother’s struggle to make it in a new land, and in Puzo’s opin-
ion, it was a better, truer book than The Godfather. Personally, we think both
books are great. A few Mafia films came along in the wake of Valachi and
Mario Puzo, but none captured the public’s imagination.
Then, when everybody in Hollywood said you couldn’t recapture the glory
days of the 1930s, and that the gangster film was as dead as the micro-mini
skirt, the Queen Mother of all mob movies came looming up over the horizon,
probably one of the ten greatest American films ever made — Francis Ford
Coppola’s The Godfather.
The Godfather was seared into the public consciousness, its images part of
the fabric of our culture. In 1962, the public was aware of organized crime,
but the Mafia was almost unheard of — even in Sicily they denied its exis-
tence. By 1972, the Mafia was as well known an American institution as base-
ball or hot dogs or Marilyn Monroe, an unbelievable about-face. Coppola’s
film also became one of America’s leading exports, sending those indelible
images around the world, until, from Russia to Venezuela, everybody wanted
to be Don Corleone.
The Godfather was rich in characterization, in appearance, and in historical
truth. Even Don Tommasso Buscetta, the most powerful Sicilian Mafia figure
to ever turn state’s evidence, said it was his favorite film (though he thought
the business at the end with everyone kissing Michael Corleone’s ring wasn’t
realistic). By the time Coppola had done two sequels to the film, it took on
the appearance of an American myth cycle, something like a Wagnerian opera
for a German.
295
Chapter 14: Thugs, Mugs, and Lugs 

And for good or ill, Coppola also unleashed on America a new onslaught 
of mob films, from Goodfellas to The Sopranos, still with us today, though
they’re far more violent and obscenity laced than any studio would have 
tolerated in the golden age of Cagney and Bogart and Robinson. Every major
Hollywood director, it seems, has done his take on the mob, hoping for the
same cash cow. This has only helped to create the glamorous aura 
surrounding the Mafia that’s spread around the world.

Old Blue Eyes and the boys
Did Frank Sinatra really get an Oscar-winning
part in From Here to Eternity because the pro-
ducer woke up with a horse’s head in his bed?
Probably not. This colorful fiction was born in the
mind of Mario Puzo in the novel The Godfather,
which, in all fairness, was based on the stories
Puzo had grown up hearing about the mob.
For Frank Sinatra, 1951 was a lousy year. He was
going through a bitter and protracted divorce,
while his career was literally in the toilet.
Hollywood and music business trades were
openly calling him a has-been, while the panting
hordes of bobby soxers who’d once mobbed him
wherever he went in 1942 were now long gone.
It was during this difficult period that he was
called before the Kefauver Congressional
Committee, the first Senate committee to investi-
gate organized crime, which they generally called
“the Syndicate.” Sinatra’s faded celebrity at least
spared him the indignity of being dragged before
the cameras in the committee room. He was
allowed to give his testimony at four in the morn-
ing, in the private office of his attorney. But the ink
still stuck, and for all his life his name would be
associated with organized crime.
Sinatra had read James Jones’s best-selling
novel From Here to Eternity, and he knew that he
was born to play the doomed soldier Maggio. But
Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures,
treated him with complete contempt, even
demanding that Sinatra do a screen test, a humil-
iating thing for a man who’d already shown his
natural acting gifts in several films. But Sinatra
did the test, gladly, and the word on the lot was
that he had the part, because the test was terrific.
But Harry Cohn, who was a legendary boor, per-
haps the most boorish of all the studio moguls of
his day, still treated Sinatra with a “Don’t call us,
we’ll call you” attitude. However, it’s not likely that
Sinatra got the part by having his friends in the
Mafia put the squeeze on Cohn, no matter how
colorful a story it makes. It’s far more likely that
Sinatra’s wife, actress Ava Gardner, helped him
get the part. She was the hottest actress in
Hollywood at that moment, and Cohn wasn’t likely
to refuse her anything she agitated for.
Nevertheless, there’s no denying that Sinatra’s
Mob ties had helped him in his early career. You
didn’t need to put a horse’s head in anyone’s bed;
just mentioning that Lucky Luciano was your dear
friend could get you nightclub work in the 1930s.
The fact is that Sinatra, born in Brooklyn, had hung
out on the Lower East Side and made friends with
gangsters, friendships that would last his whole
life. He was particularly close to Sam Giancana
(notorious head of the Chicago Outfit), Lucky
Luciano, and Willie Moretti, a high-ranking under-
boss of the Genovese Family. Sinatra was not a
gangster, but a man who liked hanging out with
gangsters. Or as one music critic put it, it was hard
to tell whether Sinatra was a gangster groupie or
the gangsters were Sinatra groupies. Ultimately,
it was the durable talent of “the Voice” that made
him an Oscar-winning actor and America’s 
premiere pop singer of the 20th century.

his chapter discusses the distrust of international bankers, and the origin
of the notion of the Jewish Bankers who conspiracists believe control the
world’s banking. We follow that with the lineup of the most mentioned (and
least trusted) one-world, one-government, New World Order committees —
the Rhodes-Milner Round Table, Tri-Lats, CFRs, Bilderbergers, and the creepy
outdoor rituals of the Bohemian Grove. Think of them all as the zoning com-
mission for world domination.
Bankers and Nefarious Banking Plots
Much of 21st-century anti-Semitism harps on the subject of Jews as the
“world’s bankers,” controlling the world’s economy (as explained in Chapter
6). The old favorite was that “five Jew bankers” (most notably, the members
of the Rothschild banking family — we’ll get to them in this chapter) ran
everything; now, modern conspiracists have upped the ante to eight Jewish
bankers, and they run the U.S. Federal Reserve. But, what about the
Rockefellers and the Morgans, the Goulds and the Fisks? They weren’t
Jewish. What about Cecil Rhodes? (They all get to Cecil Rhodes, sooner or
later. And so do we.) He wasn’t Jewish, either. How can it be said that the
Jews run all the banks?
Well, according to some conspiracists, they still do; others say they don’t. It
depends on whose conspiracy magnum opus you’re reading. Some subscribe
to the theory of a tightly-knit, White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) group of

financiers that really run things, their history generally dated from John D.
Rockefeller, the Standard Oil giant straddling early-20th-century history, and
America’s first billionaire. For them, the nasty derogatory label isn’t “Jew;”
it’s “banker.” Others, who don’t like to let go of the “five Jew bankers” theory,
believe that Rothschild’s money seeded these WASP empires, and that they
were basically all in this together, because race and religion have nothing to
do with it — money and power are the only things that matter.
However, one principle guides it all — international financiers control all 
historical events and get rich off them. They start all the wars, so they can
loan money to both sides. They reap the benefit of boom years, but arrange
busts, like the 1929 Stock Market Crash, so they have an excuse to use a time
of devalued currency to snap up huge chunks of real estate and foreclosed
property.
Why do the Jews get the banking blame?
Way back in the old days, the Catholic Church, based on a very small passage
in Luke, forbade what they called usury, the practice of lending money. With
the arrival of the Middle Ages, hatred of the Jews became part of the fabric 
of European culture. For that reason, Jews were banned from the powerful
guilds, the labor unions that controlled most of the various jobs. Confined to
the ghetto, cut off from society, there weren’t that many ways to make a 
living left open to them. Not being Christian, and therefore not forbidden by
the Catholic Church to lend money, it became easy for Jews to slip into both
pawnbroking and moneylending.
Moneylending
The interest charged by Jewish moneylenders was high. This is one accusa-
tion of the Jew-baiters that’s true. It could go as high as 50 percent, because
the risk in loaning money to Christians was so high. See it from the lender’s
perspective; the next pogrom or the next mass expulsion of the nation’s 
Jews might leave you holding the bag, not to mention the fact that powerful
Christians often simply refused to pay back the loan, figuring the Jews had
little legal recourse against them. Kings were often the worst offenders. They
may have lived the high life, but most of them weren’t good money managers,
with some outstanding exceptions, and they were always on the mooch. So,
they borrowed money to hire mercenaries, to build a new capital, or to put
on a swell show for a visiting foreign king whose daughter was marrying 
their son.
There were other moneylenders in the Middle Ages; the bankers of Lombard,
for example, being the most famous. Lombards were Northern Italians living
in France (and elsewhere) who practiced a form of usury that slipped around
the church by setting things up along the lines of a pawnshop; “Lombard
Street” in a European city was usually where the pawnbrokers were.
298
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Both Jews and Lombards became part of the “merchants and bankers” 
structure of finance in the early Middle Ages, using an idea that was a bit
older. The Christian Knights Templar had been the largest bankers of Europe
during the Crusades, issuing paper documents, like deposit slips, for money
deposited in one of their thousands of preceptories. The slip could then be
cashed at another preceptory. This made it easier for pilgrims making the
long and dangerous voyage to the Holy Land, because they did not have to
carry gold or valuables on their persons.
Medieval trade fairs picked up on the same idea. You could go to one fair, 
and a merchant would give you a bill of exchange, refundable at another fair,
so you didn’t have to hassle with actually carrying gold on buying trips.
This was really the beginning of banking in Europe. The Lombards were the
biggest force in trade-fair banking, but the Jews did it, as well. By the 16th
century, banking in London, for example, which had grown out of the money-
lending going on in the London coffee houses, would lead to the founding by
Queen Elizabeth I of the Royal Exchange, the famous center of the city’s 
commerce.
The Court Jew
Eventually, the myth, or the truth, of Jewish prowess in banking (you’ve 
got to learn something after five centuries) was so great that a peculiar 
social phenomenon grew up in Europe — the “Court Jew.” It started during
the Renaissance, and was particularly popular in the courts of the petty
Germanic kings of the Holy Roman Empire. Sometimes they were also called
“court factors,” or “chamber agents.” These were men deemed especially
knowledgeable about money. Occasionally they were Jewish moneylenders
who had leant money to the duke or king. They were brought to court and
kept close to the ruler to advise him in all money matters, and often came up
with clever ideas, such as various lotteries and tontines, to make the ruler
money as well.
Court Jews both enjoyed and suffered an odd status, neither fish nor fowl.
They had certain social privileges in the Christian world, and of course
prominence among other Jews. But there was also jealousy and bitter resent-
ment from their fellow Jews, as well as dangers in the Christian world, not 
to mention being the ruler’s favorite target for jokes, something of a royal
stooge. The other dangers were more life threatening; if a petty king or prince
owed his court Jew money, he might just whip up a pogrom, a persecution of
the Jews, and quietly get rid of him. Court Jews could find themselves rising
precariously high, sometimes even into diplomatic circles. But again, if things
went wrong, they made the perfect scapegoat.
Protestantism changes the rules
As Protestantism began to arise, particularly in the states that are now
modern Germany, the middle classes embraced it with open arms at least in
part because Protestantism was tailor made for the man of business. There
299
Chapter 15: Banks and Super Committees

was no injunction against moneylending in the Protestant faith, and many
businessmen of the great early Protestant states of the Netherlands and
Germany and England got into this business, competing with and pushing
aside the great Jewish moneylending families. Here was born the Protestant
work ethic, and the pride, rather than Catholic shame, to be found in acquir-
ing wealth from labor and business savvy. Still, Jewish competitors in this
new, 16th- and 17th-century banking universe kept Protestants on their toes.
Still, the belief that banks were all in the hands of Jews became commonplace
all over Europe and remained strong well into the 20th century and beyond.
The most notorious Nazi propaganda film of all time, Jew Süss, fixed the image
of the wily and usurious Jew banker in the public consciousness. It didn’t
matter that most of the greatest fortunes in the world were in the hands of
Gentiles, like the Morgans and the Rockefellers and the Carnegies. The image
was set in stone; the Jews ruled the banks, and the banks ruled the world.
The Rothschild banking family
Of all the boogeymen, all the disliked people of the conspiracy universe,
there’s none more universally suspected than the Rothschild family. Sooner
or later, conspiracists from Texe Marrs to David Icke to Louis Farrakhan all
get to the Rothschilds. To these guys, they’re the very soul of evil.
The Rothschilds are a wealthy and powerful family. And when one looks at
their history, it’s easy to see that old Mayer Bauer Rothschild, the founder of
their empire, was pretty smart, keeping all the banks family owned (as they
still are today). It certainly made his empire elastic enough to survive one
disaster after another, from Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz to the arrival of
the Nazis.
Mayer Rothschild was a man who started with almost nothing, a Jewish pawn-
broker in the city of Frankfort. He built his fortune out of his first big loan, to
Wilhelm IX, Elector of Hesse-Cassel, holder of one of the largest private for-
tunes in Europe. Wilhelm discovered that Mayer Rothschild was dependable,
shrewd, and scrupulously honest.
When Wilhelm was driven out of his country for several years during the
Napoleonic Wars, as were many kings, he left his fortune in Mayer’s hands.
Mayer Rothschild would remain his closest advisor.
Frankfurt was the wheeling-and-dealing capital of European banking and
stock speculation, a powerful center of the medieval trade fairs. In Mayer’s
day, Frankfurt was ruled by the Hapsburgs, and he learned one thing from
them: Keep it in the family. That was how the Hapsburgs procreated and mar-
ried their way into numberless branches of royalty, creating ruling houses of
the Holy Roman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire (Germany), Spain,
300
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Portugal, Tuscany, Hungary, and more. It was even a Hapsburg princess who
married Napoleon after he dumped the empress Josephine, in his obvious
attempt to polish up his humble Corsican bloodline.
Mayer became like a mini-Habsburg, encouraging his sons to marry cousins
or relations of some sort. He then set his five sons up in five banks across
Europe, the cleverest move a financier ever made. If the House of Rothschild
in Naples got in trouble, the House of Rothschild in Vienna or London could
take up the slack. These five houses in five major capitals kept the family on
top of every important development in politics that affected the world of
finance. Consequently, Mayer Rothschild became the most powerful money-
lender of the age. He was called a banker by then — a banker who walked
with kings.
Remaining a family business, even today, has enabled the Rothschilds to
maneuver more shrewdly, with more resilience. Their most recent reorganiza-
tion and merger with their London branch has made Rothschild & Cie
Banque, once again, the most important bank in France.
Perils of the Federal Reserve
Where pure banking conspiracism is concerned, it all arrives, sooner or later,
at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, affectionately known as “the Fed.” The
essential structure of the Fed is so unusual that it leaves the door wide open
for conspiracists to cry foul.
The Federal Reserve isn’t really “federal” at all. The name is purposefully mis-
leading. In fact, it’s a consortium of private banks and holding companies that
together form the core of the banking system of the United States. It was
formed out of private interests in 1913 (the same year of the graduated per-
sonal income tax); however, it does have a governing board of presidential
appointees, making it something of a shotgun wedding between a private and
a public institution.
These “national banks” become members by buying stock in their district
from the Federal Reserve and are required by law to jump through all sorts of
hoops. The rules of the Fed determine how much they have to have in
reserve, among other things. In theory, they don’t operate for profit, and they
can’t sell off the stock they own in the Fed, any more than they can make
loans based on their government-mandated reserves.
However, thanks to the system engineered by the Fed, those reserves are
meaningless. At one time, paper money was literally a receipt for an equal
amount of gold in the bank. Now that piece of paper is just, well, a piece of
paper. It’s only money because we believe it’s money. But it’s paper, and they
print as much of it as they like, thereby causing an ever-spiraling devaluation
of currency.

Chapter 15: Banks and Super Committees

For many years, conspiracists have said that it isn’t “Reagan’s economy” or
“Bush’s economy” or “Clinton’s economy” — it’s Alan Greenspan’s economy.
And really, there’s a great deal of truth in it. Despite political changes, Alan
Greenspan remained chairman of the Fed for nearly 20 years. Current Fed
chairman Ben Bernanke is a personal protégé of his. For conspiracists, this is
more proof that political parties are all smoke and mirrors to keep the masses
amused, but have nothing whatsoever to do with who’s running things.
In the same way that your credit card company can keep you paying off just
the interest for years, without ever touching the principle of the debt, that’s
all our government ever does with this complex web of bankers, making them
ever richer. On the other hand, the bankers didn’t have a gun in the back of
the government forcing it to drive the nation further and further into debt.
There is much chatter amongst conspiracists that this is a way for the wealthy
to control the government, but it seems to us that this is a two-way street —
it’s also a way for the government to feed off its wealthiest citizens.

“I killed the Bank”
In the first struggling years of the United States,
the nation didn’t have much in the way of an
international impact and didn’t have any sort of
federal bank. Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of
the Treasury, was annoyed to no end. It was an
article of faith for Alexander Hamilton that the
federal government had to have a national bank,
which would assume the debt of the states and
control the federal debt. (There’s a task.) He also
founded the U.S. Mint and, finally, the First
National Bank of the United States, in 1791.
At that time, America had only three banks.
Unfortunately, it also had over 50 different kinds
of currency, the most popular still being British
pounds. But people were just as likely to pay for
things with anything from a Spanish gold dou-
bloon to a French bank note or a Portuguese real.
It was economic chaos. A system of credit and 
a national coinage had to be established;
Hamilton’s bank achieved this.
But when the bank’s 20-year charter from the
Congress ran out in 1811, the Congress chose not
to renew it, and the bank folded, which led to
arguments aplenty, not to mention street riots,
over the eventual establishment of the Second
Bank of the United States, whose principal foe
was President Andrew Jackson. It was rechar-
tered in 1816, but Jackson declared war on it,
refusing to deposit federal funds into a privately
owned bank. It lost its federal charter in 1836.
Jackson routinely referred to all bankers (you
know, the guys investing their private money into
the future of the United States) as “vipers,” and
the bank as “subversive,” though he did have a
point when he said that it was, in some respects,
a monopoly, one that had been caught in several
financial scandals. Yet, all states had the right to
charter banks anytime they wanted to. Jackson
was so proud of this veto that the hero of the
Creek Wars and the War of 1812, not to mention
the president, had put on his tombstone “I killed
the Bank.” National banks wouldn’t rear their
head again in America until 1863, because, once
again, there were too many different currencies
out there, issued by individual states, that caused
economic chaos and destabilization.

This is what Alexander Hamilton envisioned in his first national Bank of
America: The nation’s wealthiest men buy shares in the future of America, in
the same way that a man buys shares in a company, and the government uses
that money to build the nation. Hamilton understood something that a lot of
clever businessmen will still tell you today; whenever possible while buying
something, use somebody else’s money to do it with.
Supersecret Committees
In this section you will find what many conspiracists fear most — the alleged
supersecret committees that meet privately around the world and decide 
the destiny of the rest of us poor, clueless “sheeple.” In truth, virtually all
these groups have meetings that issue reports, Web sites that publicize their
activities, and even lists of their members and guests. But it’s the closed
doors and the importance of their participants that raise the nervous hackles
on investigators and the perennially suspicious. Worried about the undue
influence of the United Nations on national sovereignty? Mere pikers, 
compared to these groups.
Cecil Rhodes and the Rhodes-Milner
Round Table
You have undoubtedly heard of academic brain boxes known as Rhodes
scholars (see the “Rhodes scholarships” sidebar), but you may not have
heard of the man who they’re named for — Cecil John Rhodes. Rhodes is a
regular in the Rogues Gallery of conspiracism, and his name gets attached 
to a passing parade of secret “world government” New World Order groups.
There’s a reason for that. He was the founder of the De Beers diamond 
company, which at one time controlled 90 percent of the diamonds sold
around the world, and still about 60 percent these days. A diamond is 
forever, indeed.
Rhodes was born in England in 1853, but made his fortune on the African 
continent. He was a sickly child and was sent from England to live with his
brother in the healthier climate of Cape Colony (what’s now South Africa) in
1870. Diamonds were discovered nearby in Kimberley, and Rhodes became a
prospector. By the time he was just 19, he’d already made a tidy fortune in
the diamond business. He went back home to study at Oxford between 1873
and 1881, but returned to Africa where he spent the rest of his life.
303
Chapter 15: Banks and Super Committees

Rhodes was a staunch advocate of British colonialism, from which he 
profited handsomely. He wasn’t shy about using powerful friends in English
government to exact mineral rights and mining claims across the colonies in
Africa. In 1888, he founded De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. and monopo-
lized the diamond business across much of what’s now South Africa, Zambia,
Zimbabwe, and Botswana.
In honor of his activities and prestige, the region of Zambia and Zimbabwe
were named Rhodesia. And how did Rhodes manage to afford to snap up all
the major and minor diamond mining in southern Africa? By a massive loan
from his friend Lord Nathan Mayer Rothschild and the London House of
Rothschild.
Rhodes had his own peculiar brand of colonial philosophy. He believed 
that the English “race” was the most “civilizing” on Earth, and that British
colonialism would raise up the “inferior” people of the world. Cape Colony,
Australia, New Zealand, and Canada (what he thought of as the “white”
colonies of Britain) would extend the Empire to new heights of greatness, and
of course improve the lot of those miserable darker natives. Of course, what
was really going on was the wholesale plundering of natural resources, along
with large-scale destruction of all those insignificant folks who’d lived there
first. The time between 1880 and the outbreak of World War I was known 
as the Mad Scramble for Africa, as European nations carved up the African
continent for themselves. Eventually, Rhodes was convinced that the British,
Germans, and Americans would eventually rule the Earth.
Rhodes and the Society of the Elect
Rhodes struggled with lousy health all his life, and he rewrote his will at least
six times. It was worth rewriting, because at the time he was the richest man
in the world. It is the first of his six wills, written when he was just 23, before
he had much in the way of money, that generally raises eyebrows in conspir-
acy camps. It stated, in part, that he wanted to provide “for the establish-
ment, promotion and development of a Secret Society, the true aim and object
whereof shall be for the extension of British rule throughout the world . . . the
furtherance of the British Empire and the bringing of the whole uncivilized
world under British rule, for the recovery of the United States, for the making
the Anglo-Saxon race but one Empire.”
Rhodes became a Freemason as a young man, but was unimpressed with it, at
first. He believed that Freemasonry (covered in Chapter 9) was missing the
boat by not using its worldwide reach and influence to really change the
world. He wrote, “I see the wealth and power they possess, the influence they
hold and I think over their ceremonies and I wonder that a large body of men
can devote themselves to what at times appear to be the most ridiculous and
absurd rites with no object, with no end.”
Naturally this all sets off alarm bells that Rhodes set up his secret society and
set about his plan to fill all the continents of the world with red telephone
304
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

boxes, double-decker buses, Beefeaters, and cars with the steering wheel on
the wrong side. If Rhodes had his way, everyone would be eating bangers and
mash, bubble and squeak, boiled steaks, and spotted dick. Moreover, the
accusation has long been made that Rhodes eventually warmed up to the
Masons, in which he was a life member, and eventually co-opted them for his
plan to spread his world domination scheme.
Some researchers make the claim that Rhodes did in fact succeed at forming
his own secret society, the Society of the Elect. He and Pall Mall Gazette
editor William T. Stead met in 1891 and hammered out the details of such a
group, which included himself as the General of the Society, with Stead and
Lord Nathan Mayer Rothschild as his immediate underlings. Next came a
level called the Junta of Three, followed by a Circle of Initiates, and finally the
rank and file Association of Helpers. Important members of the British peer-
age and notable members of government were named to many of the higher
positions, but it has never been proved that any of this ever got beyond the
talking stage. Author Carroll Quigley claimed in his 1966 book Tragedy and
Hope that the Society of the Elect was absolutely real, and that the members
of the Association of Helpers were eventually organized as the Rhodes-Milner
Round Table.
Again, we come back to Rhodes’s various wills. By his fifth and sixth ones,
the references to his secret society idea stopped, to be replaced by his plan
for the Rhodes scholarships (see the “Rhodes scholarships” sidebar). There’s
no evidence that the Society of the Elect ever existed. It is only Carroll
Quigley’s allegation, with no proof.
305
Chapter 15: Banks and Super Committees
Rhodes scholarships
Rhodes did die quite young, at 42, in 1902, and his
sixth will and testament prevailed. Because he
believed in the genetic, economic, and philo-
sophic superiority of the British, German, and
American people, when he died, he left the over-
whelming bulk of his incredible wealth to set up
the Rhodes scholarship program. The scholar-
ship provides for studies at England’s Oxford
University.
Of course, he included the United States as an
ulterior motive — he wanted to foster the growth
of a new breed of “philosopher kings” who
would eventually come to their collective senses
and compel America to rejoin the British Empire.
Ultimately, he believed that by bringing American
and German students to Oxford, greater under-
standing and war prevention between the coun-
tries would be fostered. That said, Germans were
written out of the scholarship from 1914 to 1932,
and again from 1939 through 1970. Women were
permitted to apply after 1975.
Notable U.S. recipients of the Rhodes scholar-
ship have been Supreme Allied Commander
Wesley Clark, former secretary of labor Robert
Reich, Supreme Court Justice David Souter,
former president Bill Clinton, singer songwriter
Kris Kristofferson, and Louisiana governor Piyush
Jindal.

Rhodes-Milner Round Tables
Here’s where the cast increases and the plot thickens. Rhodes was not alone
in his beliefs that the English were superior and destined to rule the world.
High Commissioner Alfred Lord Milner became an incredibly influential
statesman during this period and was a kindred soul to Rhodes’s way of
thinking. While he’d been born in Germany, Milner considered himself
English, and like Rhodes, he had a dream for the Empire. Milner’s vision was
that all the major British colonies would have their own governments, with
an Imperial Parliament in London that handled the overarching affairs of the
Empire itself. The colonies would be represented in the Imperial government,
which would handle defensive issues and international trade agreements, but
the colonies would remain largely independent.
The United States was the best example of this kind of state/federal system,
and Milner saw an Imperial Federation as the only way to extend and pre-
serve the Empire, while encouraging white Englishmen to go forth, be fruitful,
multiply, and be prosperous. Otherwise, he reasoned, sooner than later, the
local, native populations (and previous owners) would rebel and demand
independence. Which is exactly what happened.
While in Cape Colony after the end of the second Boer War (which led to 
the union of four different colonies into the nation of South Africa), Milner
surrounded himself with a group of young civil service officers and adminis-
trators whom he influenced with his grand scheme, and they were branded
as Milner’s Kindergarten. Even though Milner and his like-minded friends
attained very important and influential positions in the British government
over the next few decades, his Imperial Federation idea never came to be.
In 1910, the group founded the Round Table magazine to discuss these 
ideas, and the group (which actually called itself “Moot” — Round Table was
only the name of the magazine) still exists today. They have a Web site at
www.moot.org.uk.
At the end of World War I, U.S. president Woodrow Wilson’s closest advisor,
Edward M. House, met in Paris with the Round Table group, and it’s believed
by some researchers that the New York–based Council on Foreign Relations
was formed, based on that meeting. The allegation is that Americans 
wouldn’t listen to such an Anglo-centric organization, so they spawned the
CFR (see the section “Council on Foreign Relations”).
Council on Foreign Relations
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is a think tank, a nonpartisan organi-
zation made up of American and global leaders dedicated to educating 
policymakers, journalists, businesspeople, and students about international
cultures, economies, policies, and defense issues.
306
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

First started as an informal group in 1917, the Council consisted of 150 his-
tory and political scholars (mostly from New York) assembled by President
Woodrow Wilson. Their mission was to provide Wilson with guidance about
post–World War I foreign policy, so he could negotiate halfway intelligently 
at the Paris Peace talks. While Wilson had originally envisioned a British 
and American group of academics and diplomats, the Council eventually con-
sisted of just over 100 New York manufacturers, attorneys, and bankers and
was presided over by Nobel Peace Prize–winner and then secretary of state
Elihu Root.
The Council was officially formed in 1921, and was quickly dominated by
financiers, many with connections to J. P. Morgan. The Rockefeller family also
became major players in the Council, providing funding and donating a New
York mansion as its headquarters. David Rockefeller became a director of 
the Council in 1949, and its chairman between 1970 and 1985. He remains its
honorary chairman today.
CFR study groups had great, if secret, influence on the government of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt during WWII, and on post-WWII policies. It is
believed that the Marshall Plan, NATO, and the Cold War policy of Soviet
“containment” all came from CFR study groups. CFR members were impor-
tant members of the Eisenhower administration, and Nixon’s national secu-
rity advisor Henry Kissinger was a longtime CFR member and contributor to
its study groups. Critics have nervously pointed out that between 1945 and
1972 more than 500 top government officials were CFR members. Half of the
U.S. presidents since WWII have been CFR members.
The CFR today has more than 4,300 members. How secret a group can that
be? It publishes Foreign Affairs magazine, and their Web site (www.cfr.org)
lists dates and locations. Its self-proclaimed goal is to increase America’s
understanding of the world, and to contribute ideas to U.S. foreign policy.
Annual reports on a wide array of topics are available to anyone.
Notable members include former president Bill Clinton, former secretary 
of state Colin Powell, former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, former NBC
anchorman Tom Brokaw, and actress Angelina Jolie. For the nervous folks on
the Right, there’s Move-On.org investor George Soros. For the nervous on 
the Left, Henry Kissinger is still kicking it. Their lofty goals are regarded with
great suspicion by conspiracists, who believe that the CFR, like the other
groups mentioned in this section, is creating the policies that will lead to a
one-world government — the New World Order.
Their Web site is at www.cfr.org.

Chapter 15: Banks and Super Committees

The Trilateral Commission
The Trilateral Commission is a nongovernment think tank of some 300 mem-
bers. Membership is drawn from North America, Europe, the Pacific Asia, and
Australia, because these places are considered the dominant areas of indus-
trialized democracy in the world. (Or they were at the time of its founding in
1973 at the behest of Chase Manhattan Bank’s David Rockefeller.) The goal of
the Commission is to promote international cooperation, and members are
business leaders and former government and United Nations officials.
Naturally, that makes them suspected candidates for architects of the New
World Order.
The Tri-Lats, as they’re better known, became objects of suspicion in 1980
when three presidential contenders during the primaries — Jimmy Carter,
George H. W. Bush, and third-party candidate John Anderson — were all
members of the Commission, along with Carter’s vice president, Walter
Mondale. Carter had appointed 26 Tri-Lats as senior members of his adminis-
tration in the late ’70s, and suddenly the Commission found itself at the
center of election-year mudslinging. The far-right John Birch Society went
ballistic. And even though nonmember Ronald Reagan won the 1980 election,
he did make Tri-Lat Bush his vice-presidential running mate.
If powerful bankers worry you, it should be noted that Paul Volker and Alan
Greenspan were both founding members of the Trilateral Commission. Both
eventually became head of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Members meet regularly and publish the papers presented at their 
gatherings, frequently on issues of expanding democracy. Far from being
secret, you’re free to contact the group for a list of its approximately 350
members. Annual meeting reports are publicly available online. However, 
the evil, world takeover plots don’t seem to be available on their Web site:
www.trilateral.org.
The Bilderberg Group
The Bilderberg Group was started during the Cold War to increase under-
standing between world leaders of Europe and the United States. The group
was created in 1954 by Prince Bernhard in Oosterbeek, Netherlands, and is
named after the hotel that they met in that first year. The theory goes that
the World Wars that had started in Europe could be averted in the future if
leaders of those countries had a chance to meet and get to know each other
in an informal setting. Each year, 100 government, economic, and business
308
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

leaders are invited to meet and talk freely without the interference of the
news media (or their own constituents). The list of attendees is made public,
and members of the press may attend, but may not report on proceedings.
Minutes are kept, but they don’t contain the names of who said what, only
what was spoken.
The buzz among conspiracists is that no one can become President of the
United States without being a Bilderberger. Both President Bushes, John
Kerry, John Edwards, Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, Donald
Rumsfeld, Steven Spielberg, as well as Tony Blair and a list of equally well-
placed European notables, have attended past meetings. The group is 
undeniably an elite collection of movers and shakers, and what they say
behind closed doors is kept a secret. Conspiracy addicts see this as an evil
plot for one-world government, yet the group proposes no legislation, issues
no policy statements, and takes no votes. The participants regard it as an
opportunity to chat informally with people who are their international peers
without every word being scrutinized on the nightly news.
All these similarly designed groups bring up an important conundrum. On the
one hand, democratic societies don’t like closed door sessions of powerful
people, under any circumstances. Without public input and the vigilance of
public watchdogs, secret “star chambers” of rich or influential power brokers
can plan evil doings, or at least hatch remarkably bad ideas. On the other
hand, national and international leaders need to share ideas and concerns
just like professional associations of doctors, real estate agents, and school-
teachers do, without always having to screen every word they say with a
camera rolling. As for the connection between groups like the Bilderbergers,
the Trilateral Commission, and the Council on Foreign Relations, and 
members who go on to become presidents, prime ministers, and CEOs of
multinational companies, it’s a small world when you get to that level. The
conspiracy allegation is that these councils and commissions tell these influ-
ential wannabees what to do, on their way to creating some creepy, universal,
“Zionist-dominated,” global-controlled, New World Order.
Bohemian Club and Bohemian Grove
In 2007, former president Bill Clinton was making a speech and was inter-
rupted by a “9/11 Truther” who shouted allegations about the 9/11 attacks
being a hoax, followed by a reference to Clinton and Bohemian Grove. As the
guy was dragged out of the auditorium, Clinton quipped, “That’s where all
those rich Republicans go up and stand naked against redwood trees right?
I’ve never been to the Bohemian Club but you oughta go. It’d be good for 
you. You’d get some fresh air.”
309
Chapter 15: Banks and Super Committees

Word on the street is that the boyish fun at the campouts of the Bohemian
Grove, the world’s most star-studded Scout troop, includes Satanic rituals,
rapes, outdoor S&M, public urination “swordfights,” and setting fire to a great
big owl. We’ll tell you right from the start. The owl stuff is true. So is the
public urination.
San Francisco’s Bohemian Club was started in 1872 as a private men’s club by
a group of journalists who were looking for a little culture, along with attract-
ing avant garde artists, musicians, actors, and writers, known in those days 
as Bohemians. The trouble with trying to form an exclusive men’s club with a
bunch of starving, off-kilter, and unusual, artsy types is that most of them
were broke. So, the club had to also admit a few rich patrons, just to keep the
lights on.
The result was that the rich men stayed and quickly crowded out most 
of the starving artists. The membership quickly became dominated by finan-
cial titans, famous politicians, and other powerful figures (overwhelmingly
Republicans). Yet, the bylaws required that a certain number of members still
be writers and other artists. Authors like Mark Twain, Jack London, and
Ambrose Bierce were early members.
In the late 1800s, the Bohemian Club held regular summer camp outs in 
several locations in the forests outside of San Francisco. The feeling was that
the club had become too socially conscious, too clubby, too cushy, and had
lost the Bohemian spirit of unconventional living. So, in 1899, the group
established a permanent campground on an isolated, 2,700-acre, redwood-
filled property known as Bohemian Grove, near the tiny town of Monte Rio.
Every July since then, the Grove has been the location of an annual outdoor,
two-week celebration of Bohemian life. And because of the many influential
members and guests of the club, along with rumors of certain activities, a
growing suspicion has developed over their carryings-on.
Retreat for the ruling class
The Grove itself is a massive compound made up of different themed camps,
sort of like a rural Disneyland. These days, some 1,500 members and guests
attend. Each area has its own cabins and dining area, and the more than 100
campsites all have their own names like Valhalla, Mandalay, Cave man, Pink
Onion, Woof, Jungle, and Dragons (William F. Buckley, Jr., George H. W. Bush,
and Astronaut Frank Borman hang out at the Hillbilly Camp). Throughout the
16 days of the Grove, there are lectures, plays, and music, along with great
food, cigars, and endlessly flowing booze. The Lakeside Speakers are an
annual lineup of the world’s most powerful guest speakers who address the
campers throughout the session (many aspiring Republican presidential can-
didates have tried out their stump speeches here). But if an attendee wants
to go swim nude in the Russian River, that’s his business. Women are not
allowed on the property during these summer festivities.
310
Part III: Secret Societies and Societies with Secrets 

Remember that the Bohemian Club has a mandated group of members who
are actors, writers, musicians, and artists, so the entertainment is nonstop —
annual events are the Lo-Jinx musical comedy show and a more serious
Grove Play. The Clubhouse back in San Francisco has a 600-seat auditorium 
in the basement for putting on plays throughout the year, and for rehearsing
shows headed for the Grove. The “Men of Talent” are often given reduced
membership fees, in return for their work on Club shows, which are 
presented in the Clubhouse every Thursday night from October to May. Mark
Twain would work all year on phony Elizabethan poems and suggestive fish-
ing songs involving the size of a man’s cod, to be presented at the Grove.
Member Herman Wouk, author of The Winds Of War, said of the Grove, 
“Men can decently love each other; they always have, but women never quite
understand.” Still, not everyone thinks highly of the Grove and its antics.
Member Richard Nixon once called it, “the most faggy goddamn thing that
you would ever imagine.” Interestingly, even though past presidents and 
presidential hopefuls are regular attendees, the Grove has a rule that sitting
presidents may not give speeches during the event. Nevertheless, members
and guests are a stunning array of business and political leaders, which is
what makes the decidedly lowbrow, high-schoolish level of pranks, name 
calling, theatrical drag acts, and fart jokes seem so out of place for these 
otherwise dour men of power. And then there’s all that public urinating.
Yes, the Grove is a freewheeling place where guys like George Schultz, Henry
Kissinger, and Newt Gingrich can pee on a tree and not have some reporter
from The Inquirer plaster it on the cover. The Grove isn’t a place where world
domination is planned; it’s where the men who already dominate the world
go to relax. They aren’t worshiping Satan; they aren’t sacrificing orphaned
children to the ancient god Moloch. They are doing what the rest of us can do
privately without having cameras and microphones thrust at us while we’re
sitting in a boat, baiting a hook and drinking a beer. They drink nonstop, joke
with each other, and act like big kids for a couple of weeks a year. The Grove’s
meetings have been infiltrated many times, and the overwhelming conclusion
is that there’s nothing sinister going on. Unfortunately, that doesn’t sell
books and DVD exposés to a breathless public who believes otherwise.
The Cremation of Care
For over 100 years, the opening of the Grove’s annual outdoor session has
been a dramatic, overproduced, and slightly bizarre ceremony called the
Cremation of Care. The centerpiece of the Grove’s central gathering area is 
an outdoor amphitheater, with a pond and a 45-foot-tall concrete owl — 
a symbol of wisdom and the Bohemian Club’s mascot and logo.
311
Chapter 15: Banks and Super Committees

The point of the ceremony is that the majority of attendees at the Grove may
be the movers and shakers of the financial and political world, but while they
are in the Grove, they are to put the cares and worries of the outside world
aside. And they do this by burning them. Well, not literally, even though 
conspiracist Alex Jones thinks otherwise. The ceremony begins with a boat
slowly crossing the pond carrying an effigy that represents Dull Care. This
dreaded reminder of the outside world mocks the attendees, and shouts at
them over the booming PA system, “Fools! Fools! Fools!” The Bohemians have
the last laugh, as hooded, vaguely Druidic-looking Grovers take Dull Care out
of the boat, put it on an altar, and set it on fire, to the happy cheers of the
crowd, which are accompanied by triumphant music and fireworks. And the
voice of the Owl during the ceremony? Former CBS news anchorman Walter
Cronkite. Of course, Alex Jones believes this is a live body they burn every
year. His clandestine video of the event is all over the Internet.
The point being made goes along with the Bohemian Club’s motto: “Weaving
spiders come not here” (a line taken from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s
Dream). It means don’t come and make plots or transact business or bring
the evil cares of the outside world in here.
The Committee of 300
Also referred to in some circles as The Olympians, the Committee of 300 is
such a super-duper secret organization, that only one man in the whole world
has ever discovered anything about it. Conspiracist Dr. John Coleman, in his
book Conspirators Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300, describes an
organization supposedly made up of top political, military, and business 
leaders. This one is allegedly led by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II.
Coleman, who claims to be a former British MI6 intelligence officer, alleges
the Committee is responsible for “phony drug wars” in the United States 
that allow government to confiscate property of otherwise innocent citizens
(we don’t question that this goes on only that Coleman is pointing to the
wrong group). But the real aim of the Committee is population control to 
save natural resources. It was allegedly formed by Cecil Rhodes (see “Cecil
Rhodes and the Rhodes-Milner Round Table”) to organize a one-world 
government. The usual suspects of Rockefellers and Rothschilds are named
as possible members.
Coleman goes on to allege that the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations 
in London has been brainwashing citizens for decades, while developing
mind-control programs for the CIA and other agencies. These techniques, 
so the tale goes, are used to modify public opinion and behavior and render
everyone helpless to oppose world dictatorship. And of course to keep 
the “sheeple” from ever discovering the truth about the mysterious 
Committee of 300.

A few words about order
To quote Howard Johnson in the movie Blazing
Saddles, “You know, Nietzsche said ‘Out of
chaos comes order.’” Well, it might eventually,
but it doesn’t without any help. We’re going to
say it without beating around the bush. The com-
mittees, councils, commissions, clubs, and soci-
eties mentioned in the last part of this chapter
really are out to rule the world.
There. Cat’s out of the bag. It’s a nasty, filthy, and
frequently dangerous job, but for crying out loud,
somebody has to do it. They are made up of the
richest and/or the most powerful people in the
free world, so there’s little in it for them to engi-
neer more power or more money for themselves.
Most important, they are the most successful at
their chosen professions, and they have lots of
collective experience. And who are you going 
to consult about international monetary policy
and the effects of political destabilization — 
your dentist?
What all these groups are ultimately after is the
same thing: They want to keep some 6.6 billion
selfish, greedy, single-minded, uneducated, trib-
alistic Neanderthals from murdering, robbing,
spending, starving, or exploding each other into
oblivion. When you get right down to it, that’s all
any of them, and a whole raft of others, are 
after — from the World Trade Organization, the
G7, the World Social Forum, and the Project for
the New American Century, to the United
Nations, the International Monetary Fund,
Greenpeace, and whatever crazy bunch Ted
Turner is pimping this week. They all have a dif-
ferent solution to the problems that plague the
world, some dumber than others. But the people
involved in them, whether you agree or disagree
with their ideas, are the people who have studied
the world’s problems far more closely than most
of us who sit in bars and wag our fingers in the
air, believing we have all the answers to all the
troubles in the world.
Groups like the CFR, the Trilateral Commission,
the Bilderbergers, and even the Bohemian
Grovers peeing on old-growth trees in the red-
wood forest are not summoning forth Satan,
electing the Antichrist, or sacrificing kidnapped
third-world babies to pagan gods on pyres lit
with Saudi oil. Their influential members may
own a lot and control a lot, but they don’t own
and control it all; the world is too unpredictable a
place, and there are still elections held like
clockwork in the democratic parts of the world.
Conspiracy mongers who spread these accusa-
tions are little more than modern-day Barnums
bilking a gullible public into having a peek at the
alligator woman.
Like it or not, civilization comes to a grinding halt
and order descends right back into chaos when
we all refuse to trust anyone anymore. The old
Cold War saying about nuclear weapons negoti-
ation was, “Trust and verify.” Likewise with the
people who step up to try to bring a little order to
central Africa, downtown Cleveland, or a New
England town hall meeting. It should never be
blind trust — trust and verify, hold them to the
highest standards, and demand transparency.
But we have to trust the people we put in charge
of our businesses, neighborhoods, and nations.
They can’t all be crooks and thieves and evildo-
ers and schemers, because if they are, that
means no one can be trusted, anywhere, any-
time. That’s no way to live, and the alternative is
lousy, because no anarchist will ever let you
keep your Chevy Tahoe parked in the driveway
for long.

xploring conspiracy theories can be fun or frightening, depending on
your point of view. But there are some theories that are just too crazy,
and in a few cases, some folks are just crazy enough to attempt to pull them
off. And at least one of the conspiracy theories presented in this chapter 
has caused a great deal of harm on a global scale (see the section, “Polio
Epidemic Spread by a Conspiracy Theory”). Following are ten conspiracy 
theories that just plain defy rational thought.
There’s More than One Pope
In 1962, Pope John XXIII announced that it was time to “throw open a
window” so that the church could look out at the world and the world could
look in. That year, he assembled the first of four annual sessions of what
became known as the Second Vatican Council, or in more Hollywood sequel-
esque terms, Vatican II (Vatican I had been held a century before, but was
interrupted by a revolution in Italy and never reconvened). Pope John’s pur-
pose with Vatican II was to drag the Catholic Church, screaming and kicking,
into the 20th century. He wouldn’t live to see the end result — he died of
cancer in 1963. But his successor, Pope Paul VI, continued with the council
meetings and subsequent reforms.
The changes made to the church in the mid-1960s were massive:
 The Mass would be said in the vernacular of the country rather than
liturgical Latin, so the congregation could actually understand what 
was being said.

 The altar was turned around so parishioners could see what was going on.
 The church admitted the possibility of eternal salvation for believers of
other faiths.
 Jews, who’d historically been held responsible as a race for the killing of
Christ, were ordered to be held blameless — individuals had been 
responsible, not the Jews as a people.
 Catholics didn’t even have to eat fish on Fridays anymore.
For lifelong Catholics, Vatican II, for good or ill, was a shock to the system, and
those who regarded it as heretical abandonment began to sniff a blasphemous
rat. Breakaway groups of “traditionalist Catholics,” who believe that Vatican II
was a Masonic conspiracy to destroy the church and that Popes John XXIII and
Paul VI were responsible, have formed over the last 40 years. In fact, some of
these groups say that Paul VI was actually kidnapped and replaced by an actor.
Others simply say that all popes since John XXIII have been illegally elected.
In the light of this vacuum of legal and proper spiritual leadership, somebody
just had to step in. In fact, there have even been a few who’ve stepped to their
own balconies, sent up a little white smoke, and proclaimed “Habemus papem”
(We have a pope). As of this writing, there are perhaps a dozen worldwide
(including a Popette, Gregoria XVIII in Quebec). Here are the best known:
 David Allen Bawden was elected pope on July 16, 1990, and took as 
his papal name Pope Michael I. Bawden isn’t an ordained priest, because
his election was held in his family’s store in Belvue, Kansas. While all
Catholics from around the world were invited to attend the election 
and vote, only six showed up, including Bawden, his parents, and his girl-
friend (who has since withdrawn her support and proclaimed Pope
Michael a heretic). The latest estimate of Catholics who believe the Holy
See is situated in Kansas is less than 50.
 While Kansas’s Pope Michael I disses the Roman pretenders ever since
Paul VI, some traditional Catholics think even Pope John XXIII was bogus.
Such a contrarian is Father Lucian Pulvermacher, known to his flock as
Pope Pius XIII. Pulvermacher believes that John XXIII’s election was illegal
because, according to some, Pope John had become a Freemason in 1935
while in Turkey. Masonic membership among Catholics can be an excom-
municable offense, which rendered Pope John’s election void, according to
some traditionalists (even though his Masonic membership has never
been proved). Pulvermacher was elected pope on October 24, 1994, in a
conclave held in rural Montana. Unfortunately, because all electors had
trouble getting to the location, some of the voting was done by telephone.
Nevertheless, he won by unanimous vote and was consecrated at a local
hotel the next year, taking the name of Pius XIII, while surrounded by an
enthusiastic throng of 28. He has since moved the Vatican to a rural 
location in Springdale, Washington.
 The Palmarian Catholic Church in Spain took the step of simply pro-
claiming Clemente Dominguez y Gomez as Pope Gregory XVII in 1978.
318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Gomez believed Vatican II’s real Pope Paul VI had been drugged and 
kidnapped by Communists and Freemasons. Gomez died in 2005 while
saying Easter Mass and was made Saint Gregory the Very Great. He was
succeeded by Manuel Alonso Corral, who calls himself Pope Peter II.
Space Shuttle Columbia’s 
“Deliberate” Destruction
On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia mission STS-107 was headed
for a routine Florida landing after 16 days in space. Suddenly, just 16 minutes
away from the Cape Canaveral runway, the shuttle, traveling at Mach 18, broke
up in the skies 203,000 feet above Texas. The crash killed all seven members of
the crew. Debris rained down on the area around Palestine, Texas, and almost
immediately, the conspiracists saw something far more 
sinister than just a simple accident.
Conspiracist Alex Jones had “predicted” some kind of disaster several days
before it happened, with the hypothesis that the U.S. government may stage
some kind of tragedy as a way to either divert the public’s attention from war
activities, or to justify a much larger war in the Middle East. Of course, Jones
regularly “predicts” this kind of thing, so he’s always ready for any major event.
The tragedy brought a shameless pack of conspiracy theories front and center:
 The Jews did it: Ilan Ramon was an Israeli colonel who’d taken part in the
bombing of an Iraqi nuclear facility back in 1981 and the first Israeli to be
launched into space. With an Israeli on board, such a high profile attack
on the American spacecraft would’ve been a major publicity and ideologi-
cal coup. Rumors circulated that Ramon had been making atmospheric
and photographic studies of Iraq from space for biological warfare use,
and that his “martyrdom” was intentionally staged to gin up support for
Israeli military action in Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, and 
eventually, Iraq.
 The U.S. Military did it: The military, alleged by “investigator” Sherman
Skolnick, shot down the shuttle using a sophisticated particle beam
weapon (an as yet unverifiable technology). But most who ascribed to the
notion that it was deliberately destroyed by the government figured it was
just a boring old missile attack. Naturally, because the shuttle 
disintegrated over Texas, home of President George W. Bush and his big
spread in Crawford, Bush was immediately implicated in either having
prior knowledge, or even having ordered the “attack.”
 The Chinese did it: This particular Columbia mission was the first to
receive its own Internet address and satellite connection to the Web. It
was over this connection, so the story goes, that the onboard computer
was hacked and infected with a virus or worm from China that managed to
cause some sort of reentry maneuver that resulted in its destruction. An
319
Chapter 16: Ten Conspiracy Theories That Skirt the Edge of Madness

alternate enemy named was North Korea. Curiously, this particular theory
came from an unusual source — the Russian news service PRAVDA.
 The hand of God did it: The Islamic press claimed the disaster was the
hand of Allah punishing both the Americans and the Jews, as well as a
message from God that Jews weren’t welcome in space. Christian funda-
mentalists saw portentous symbolism in the death of an Israeli and the
debris falling on the town of Palestine, Texas, while Palestinians in the
Middle East regarded it as an anti-Israeli message. Doomsayers claimed it
was the first sign of the Apocalypse, and as proof, pointed to a small
scroll of the Torah that Ramon carried into space with him that read:
“Has any nation ever heard the voice of God speaking out of the midst 
of the fire, as you have, and yet lived?” (Deuteronomy 4:33).
White supremacist Richard Barrett saw the shuttle’s destruction as a 
cautionary message from God exacting his vengeful wrath against 
insidious “diversity” — out of the seven crew members, only three had
been white, American men.
A NASA investigation concluded that the accident had been caused by a piece
of insulating foam from the orbiter’s external fuel tank falling off and destroy-
ing several insulating tiles from the shuttle’s left wing. Heat during reentry
caused the unprotected area to burn through and tear the wing apart.
Conspiracists disagree.
Richard Hoagland and the Face on Mars
In July 1976, NASA’s Viking I spacecraft orbited the planet Mars and sent back
photos of a region known as Cydonia Mensae, a portion of the planet’s surface
in between the smooth northern plains and the heavily pockmarked, crater-
covered area in the south. Upon close examination of one photo taken from
directly overhead, the combination of sun and shadow made the surface of a
large mesa appear to have the vague features of eyes, a nose, a mouth, and a
squared-off helmet or hair line.
“The Face on Mars!” quickly became the stuff of supermarket tabloid head-
lines. Author Richard Hoagland and others believe the photo is “evidence” of
a Martian race of creatures. Hoagland sees a ruined city, and even pyramids,
around the “face.” Subsequent photos with far better resolution have shown
that the “face” is really nothing more than a lumpy bit of geology, combined
with an out of focus photo taken when the sun was low on the Martian 
horizon to create what amounts to an interplanetary Rorschach test. But
somehow those conspiracy theorists who believe in NASA’s fuzzy first
photos, disbelieve that same agency’s more detailed photographic evidence.
Hoagland and other true believers continue to allege that NASA is covering
up the truth about evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars.

Polio Epidemic Spread by 
a Conspiracy Theory
In the 1990s, an international campaign began to wipe out polio worldwide,
once and for all. By 2000, virtually all parts of the world had been made polio
free. But beginning in 2003, a conspiracy theory gripped the Muslim world,
and the result was deadly.
It started in Nigeria. The president of Nigeria’s Supreme Council for Islamic
Sharia Law, Doctor Ibrahim Datti Ahmed, announced that Americans had 
poisoned polio vaccinations with an infertility drug to sterilize Muslim 
children. According to Dr. Ahmed, Americans were the “worst criminals on
Earth.” Ibrahim Shekarau, governor of Kano, one of the three Nigerian states
that outlawed the vaccines, said that it was preferable for a few children to die
than to risk rendering thousands of their girls infertile. Angry villagers chased
health workers, assaulting and threatening them so badly that they simply
dumped the vaccines.
By the next year, the conspiracy theory had spread to India, and by 2005, in
countries where polio cases had all but disappeared, the disease came back
with a vengeance. Sixteen nations reported major outbreaks, and the disease
shot like wildfire through mostly Muslim countries — strains spread from
Nigeria by pilgrims making the annual hajj to Mecca. Despite pleas from the
World Health Organization (WHO), Muslim governments have been uncooper-
ative about confronting the conspiracy theory, as well as unsupportive with
money for the vaccination project.
David Icke, Reptilian Humanoids, 
and the Babylonian Brotherhood
There’s a certain brand of conspiracist who goes so far overboard, who seems
to have such a large deficiency of marbles, that you have to admire the sheer
boldness, inventiveness, and wackiness of their theories. The pinnacle of this P.
T. Barnum style of conspiracy peddling is British writer David Icke (rhymes
with “Yike!” — not “sick” or “icky”).
In 1991, Icke, a former English soccer goalie, sports commentator, and Green
Party activist, claimed to have been given a special message from the spirit
world. He began wearing only turquoise-colored clothes and announced that
he was the Son of God. Since then, he has written 20 books that weave a tan-
gled haze combining New Age spiritualism, apocalyptic doom, and a bizarre
take on the Masonic–Jewish–New World Order global domination theory.
321
Chapter 16: Ten Conspiracy Theories That Skirt the Edge of Madness

Icke spouts the standard stuff about the Illuminati and the vast Global Elite that
“runs everything,” but he does it with a twist. Because, you see, according to
his book, The Biggest Secret, Icke believes the real power on Earth is a race of
shape-shifting alien lizards from Alpha Draconis, known as the Babylonian
Brotherhood. By night, behind closed doors, they are 12 feet tall and they drink
blood, nibble on rodents, molest children, and sacrifice humans in an alien
Satanic ceremony. But by day, their bodies change size and shape and they
become Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and his two sons, Hillary Clinton,
both George Bushes, Tony Blair, William F. Buckley, Jr., Bob Hope, Billy Graham,
Kris Kristofferson, and even country singer Boxcar Willie, just to name a few.
According to Icke, he was told about the royal family’s alien lizard lineage by
Princess Diana, and it was, apparently, the Royal lizards who had her rubbed
out. (We thought the most exotic alien place the Windsor’s came from was
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.) And the reason that England’s royal family has a massive
estate in Scotland is because it guards the entrance to their vast subterranean
lizard city.
Further, the Global Elite answers to what Icke calls the Luciferic Consciousness
of the Fourth Dimension. The Babylonian Brotherhood supposedly uses alien
technology to change weather patterns on Earth, and are using “global warm-
ing” as a cover story. They also created the New Age movement to prepare the
Earth for a “vibrational change.”
Of course, Icke drinks in ridicule like mother’s milk. His speaking engagements
are very well attended, and his rambling books sell well. But in addition, he 
regularly writes extensively about the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (see
Chapter 6), a phony “exposé” of a supposed board of Jewish elders outlining
their plan for world takeover.
The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), founded in 1913 to help stop anti-Jewish
hate speech, has since branched into all forms of activism against prejudice.
Needless to say, when Icke launches off on his typical “the Roshschilds start 
all the wars so they can loan money to both sides, and the Protocols is a true
document of the plot by the Aryan Brotherhood to take over the world” rant,
the ADL gets a little testy. The problem is, with all due respect to the ADL and
the work that they do, we think they just don’t get it here. When Icke says that
the Rothschilds and their minions are lizards, “lizards” isn’t a code word for
“Jews.” No, he really means lizards.
Icke has classified a long list of different lizard races that are vying for
supremacy on Earth: Grays, Troglodytes, Crinklies, Tall Robots, Tall Blondes 
(!), Elderbarians (they make crop circles), Zebra Repticulars, Annunaki (which
include the Bush presidents), the Interdimensional Sasquatch . . . it’s quite 
a list.
Naturally, the more he’s mocked, the more Icke and his fans believe he’s really
on to the tricks and the truth of the reptilian Illuminati. And the reason that the
322
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

famous folks he has “outed” as Satanic, baby-eating alien reptiles have never
sued him? Because they really are 12-foot lizards, of course. Boxcar Willie?!
The “Murder” of Princess Diana
On August 31, 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales and former wife of England’s
prince Charles, died after a high-speed car accident in the Pont d’Alma tunnel
in Paris. Diana was traveling in a black Mercedes S280 with Dodi Al-Fayed 
(son of billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed, owner of Harrod’s department store 
in London and the Hotel Ritz in Paris). In the front seats were bodyguard
Trevor-Rees Jones and the Hotel Ritz’s acting security manager, Henri Paul,
who’d been ordered to shake the cars and motorcycles packed with paparazzi
that were chasing the famous couple. Paul crashed into a support column
(portentously, the 13th one) in the tunnel, and eventually all but Jones died
from their injuries.
Almost immediately, Dodi’s famous father came out swinging. He claimed 
that Diana was murdered by the English Crown to hide the fact that the couple
was about to be engaged, and that Diana was pregnant with her Egyptian
boyfriend’s child, a scandal that Britain’s royal family wouldn’t stand for.
French authorities investigated the case and judged it an accident, caused by
driver Henri Paul’s reckless driving while under the influence of antidepres-
sants and too much booze (three times the legal limit in France).
Al-Fayed was relentless, and wild charges were made over the years (not to
mention the fact that the eccentric billionaire turned his equally eccentric
take on the once dignified Harrod’s into a virtual altar of Dodi-Diana worship,
with gaudy full-scale statuary that makes the Vatican look like minimalist
architecture):
 The late Henri Paul was accused of being in the paid service of the
British, French, or U.S. intelligence communities (it varied, depending on
who was telling the tale).
 French investigators were accused of swapping Paul’s blood samples
with a drunken suicide victim (later debunked by DNA records).
 Britain’s MI5 and MI6 security services were implicated, as were Prince
Charles and Queen Elizabeth’s husband Prince Phillip.
Other claims bubbled to the surface. One especially lunatic one was that
Diana’s well-publicized campaign against the use of landmines had cut into the
business of unscrupulous landmine manufacturers, so she had to be snuffed
by the military-industrial complex.
Conspiracy whack-job David Icke (see “David Icke, Reptilian Humanoids, and
the Babylonian Brotherhood”) got in the game, claiming that Diana had seen
323
Chapter 16: Ten Conspiracy Theories That Skirt the Edge of Madness

Queen Elizabeth transform herself into a 12-foot-tall alien lizard, a secret so
devastating that she had to be murdered.
As for the pregnancy claims, Diana had never said anything to anyone about
it, and blood tests, in fact, revealed no sign of pregnancy, though an early
stage of pregnancy in a late post-mortum is apparently difficult to determine.
Reports that Dodi had purchased an engagement ring turned out to be false.
As for Feyed’s notion that the couple had been murdered out of some racist
motivation, Diana had just ended a two-year liaison with a Pakistani Muslim
that the Royal Family seemed to have no objections to her marrying, if she’d
been so inclined.
In January 2004, London’s Metropolitan Police began its own inquiry,
Operation Paget, led by then commissioner Lord John Stevens, with a team
that would eventually include 14 officers. (Your tax pounds at work!) After
nearly three years and a cost of £3.7 million (more than US $7 million), the 
initial 832-page report was issued in December 2006 saying that every single
one of the conspiracy theories were without foundation, and that Diana hadn’t
been murdered.
The Bombing of New Orleans’s Levees
The destruction and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina across Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana was the source of a rapidly spread conspiracy
theory in 2006, making it the first tropical depression with a conspiratorial
agenda. Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan quickly alleged that the gov-
ernment had intentionally blown up a levee to allow floodwaters to destroy
poor parts of New Orleans’s 9th Ward, inhabited by African Americans. 
Some breathless believers embellished the story with Coast Guard cutters
supposedly ramming the earthen dikes or even shelling them with artillery 
to flood black neighborhoods and lower the floodwaters of white suburbs.
It’s true that at least one river barge broke free from its moorings in the 
aftermath of the storm and busted through a levee in the lower 9th Ward 
(lest anyone forget that a powerful hurricane had just passed through). The
massive barge wound up coming to rest in a residential neighborhood, but it’s
a whale of a stretch to allege that it was deliberately piloted there to destroy
the levee and take out the neighborhood. Some said they heard as many as
seven “explosions” attributed to the levee story, but such sounds would be
common as millions of gallons of water tore through the barriers, or as loose
barges slammed into them.
Filmmaker Spike Lee repeated the story on television interview programs,
saying on Real Time with Bill Maher, “Presidents have been assassinated. So
why is that so far-fetched?” It’s far-fetched because it presupposes that no
324
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

white people in local, state, and federal government have any sense of moral
right and wrong; it presupposes that any African-Americans in the government
(of which there were many, including the mayor) would go along and shut up
about such a genocidal plan; and it presupposes that members of the Army
Corps of Engineers, the Coast Guard, FEMA, and the Department of Homeland
Security would all be willing accomplices.
The same kinds of allegations were made in the very same neighborhood
during Hurricane Betsy’s hit on New Orleans in 1965. Design changes to
breeched levees during Betsy were made by the Army Corps of Engineers to
make them taller and stronger, but these “improved” designs failed during
Katrina.
Hurricane Katrina was one of the five deadliest in American history, the sixth
strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic, and the third strongest to hit
the U.S. It didn’t just devastate New Orleans, but also Biloxi, Pascagoula, Pass
Christian, Long Beach, Gulf Port, and Ocean Springs. The final death toll of
1,836 people was the worst from a hurricane in America since 1928. There’s no
question that the federally built flood protection levees experienced a total
meltdown. But it’s also true that, when Mother Nature gets that cranky, all you
can do is get out of the way.
Scientology and the IRS
The Church of Scientology was created in the 1950s by California science 
fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, as the “religious” extension of his self-help
method Dianetics. Because of the psychological basis of Scientology’s meth-
ods, the religion is adamant about its followers refusing psychiatric care from
the mainstream medical community. Depending on which source you read, it
costs as low as $30,000 or as high as $360,000 to enter into the higher levels of
the religion, and members are forbidden to discuss their progress or the mate-
rials they’ve studied, even with each other. Presumably, only after you’ve lost
enough free will, common sense, and cash are you ready for the awesome 
revelations about mankind’s role in an intergalactic space opera.
For 25 years, the Internal Revenue Service regarded Scientology’s various
operations as a commercial enterprise and not a church worthy of tax-exempt
status. So, in the 1970s, Scientology went on the attack against 136 govern-
ment agencies, foreign embassies, and organizations critical of the church, in
what they called Operation Snow White.
Using as many as 5,000 church members as agents worldwide, Scientologists
went on the warpath, especially against the IRS in order to steal or destroy
reports and records critical of the church, and to pressure the Feds into grant-
ing the church tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion. Scientologists infil-
trated the IRS and other agencies, and engaged in theft of government
325
Chapter 16: Ten Conspiracy Theories That Skirt the Edge of Madness

documents, wiretapping, and conspiring to create smear campaigns against
government employees.
While Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard avoided prosecution as an “un-
indicted co-conspirator,” his wife Mary Sue didn’t, and she did hard jail time
for following his orders. Eleven church officials were convicted in U.S. Federal
court in 1979 and seven more in Canada in 1996.
Nevertheless, the scheme worked. In 1993, the IRS changed its mind and
granted tax-exempt status to the Church of Scientology and its various con-
nected entities, along with complaining to foreign countries that didn’t follow
suit. Belgium and Germany both continue to fight the well-financed forces of
Scientology, and both countries regard the church as a for-profit business that
illegally makes medical claims while financially fleecing its flock.
The Pentagon Cruise Missile of 9/11
One of the most insane accusations of the so-called 9/11 “Truth Movement”
(see Chapter 8) is that the Pentagon wasn’t hit by an airplane, but by a U.S.
Navy cruise missile, intentionally fired to simulate a terrorist attack, in order
to create popular support for granting the government unheard-of powers in a
phony “war on terror.” Whew.
The “evidence” of this accusation begins with a series of time-lapse pho-
tographs released by the Pentagon of a security camera pointed at a parking
lot guard shack immediately adjacent to the crash site. Because the photos
are taken several seconds apart, the first image shows nothing, the second
shows a blur, and the third shows a massive explosion. Bear in mind that the
images were from a security camera, taking one frame per second, of a plane
traveling at 780 feet per second.
Conspiracists say that the hole punched in the side of the Pentagon was far
too small to have been made by a plane, and that no wreckage was found from
a jetliner. The 16-foot diameter hole punched into the interior walls of the
Pentagon was too small to be made by a 757, but the fuselage of that plane is,
in fact, 16 feet in diameter. Photos of the aftermath clearly show a 90-foot-wide
section of the building smashed in, with further damage beyond that width —
clear evidence of the wings’ impact.
Of all the claims made by 9/11 “Truthers,” this is without question the most
insane in our opinion. The Pentagon was hit by American Airlines Flight 77, a
Boeing 757. Literally hundreds of drivers stuck in morning rush hour traffic on
the roads that densely surround the Pentagon saw it fly into the side of the
massive military administration building, regardless of what doesn’t show up
on security camera tapes. There were passengers aboard the plane talking on
their cell phones when it hit, and their bodies were found in the wreckage.
The plane’s black box recorders were both recovered.

Deniers of the Holocaust
World War II was a meat grinder in which 70 million people died. An assess-
ment by the Russian government after the fall of Communism puts their losses
alone at a staggering 26 million human beings. And the concentration camps
were equal opportunity destroyers — nearly 18 million civilians were killed 
by the Nazis.
It wasn’t only the Jews who got sent to the camps; they got Freemasons,
Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, unruly priests and nuns, Slavs, evangelical
Christians, gypsies, communists, labor organizers, criminals, malcontents, 
and publishers of anti-Nazi materials of any sort.
Yet, there are revisionists who say that the Holocaust, the common term for
the targeted extermination of nearly 6 million of Europe’s Jews by Adolph
Hitler and his Nazi regime, never really happened.
There are all sorts of Holocaust deniers out there, but the lynchpin of the
movement is a small group of “scholars” who call themselves, with due 
modesty, the “Institute for Historical Review.” Along with the fancy name, 
they publish a quarterly, off and on, between lawsuits, called the Journal of
Historical Review. It is not, needless to say, a normal, peer-reviewed academic
historical publication. Nevertheless, since the 1970s, this motley crew of
pseudo-historians has attempted to wrap themselves in the trappings of a
legitimate scholarly organization.
Because the evidence is so unbelievably overwhelming, there are certain
points that most deniers concede:
 The Jews were subjected by the Nazis to a systematic oppression
throughout the 1930s that led to their expulsion from society.
 Their belongings were confiscated.
 They were confined in concentration camps.
 Tens or hundreds of thousands of Jews were either worked to death in
these labor camps or died of hunger and disease in either the camps or
the ghettos.
 Mass shootings of Jews occurred (some concede) on the eastern front as
Hitler’s army moved into Soviet Russia. But they don’t concede that the
Nazis built concentration camps that gassed the Jews, or anyone else.
In 1941, SS Gruppenfuhrer Reinhard Heydrich presided over the Wannsee
Conference, a high-level meeting of Nazi officials to plan for the ultimate exter-
mination of 11 million Jews across Europe and the Soviet Union. The standard
method of simply rounding up Jews from villages, taking them to the edge of
town, and shooting and burying them in trenches was deemed inefficient and
cruel to the soldiers required to carry out such killings. Mobile vans that
327
Chapter 16: Ten Conspiracy Theories That Skirt the Edge of Madness

pumped exhaust into sealed compartments filled with victims were expensive,
time consuming, and didn’t kill enough people at one time.
So, by 1942, a string of death camps was designed and built to murder Jews
and other undesirables with factorylike efficiency and to dispense with their
bodies in massive incinerators. By the end of the war, Adolf Eichmann, head 
of the Gestapo’s department on Jewish Affairs, estimated that 2 million Jews
had been killed in mobile vans and other methods, and 4 million in the death
camps (mostly located in Poland). The methodical, detail-obsessed Nazis left
a fact-filled paper trail of their activities, despite the fact that, after the Allied
invasion, an order came down called “Aktion 1005,” to dismantle and destroy
all evidence of mass murder.
None of the major players in the Nazi party, while on trial for war crimes, 
ever denied that the Final Solution, the program of methodical destruction of
the Jewish race, had happened. Eichmann, who was hanged by the Israelis in
1962, never once denied that the liquidation of the Jews had taken place. He
fell back on the same old line as every war criminal — the laws of his country
had decreed it to be proper, and he was obeying those laws. He was proud of
his role. But he never denied that it happened.
Yet, Holocaust deniers do. They claim that men like Eichmann were simply
bragging. They claim poisonous gas like Zyclon B was only used in camps to
delouse clothes, and that the gas chambers weren’t designed in such a way
that anyone could’ve been killed in them. They were simply rigged to look that
way later, for the tourists.
For Holocaust deniers, the contention goes something like this: When the Jews
who survived WWII decided to take up Zionism and refound a new Israel in
British-held Palestine, they schemed that they could get what they wanted by
guilting the world into giving it to them if they could invent a story that mil-
lions more Jews died at the hands of the Nazis than really did. Zionists could
also get more money that way, because in the 1950s the German government
paid out some funds in reparation to Israel to help settle Holocaust survivors.
Overestimating the loss by 3 or 4 or even 5 million people would be financially
advantageous to the new Jewish nation.
Some of these Holocaust deniers are just plain curmudgeonly contrarians,
who’ll argue with anyone over anything, and the Internet has suddenly pro-
vided them with a worldwide soapbox to shout their opinions from. They’re a
tiny fringe group, to be sure. But if as a culture, we allow the Holocaust deniers
to hijack this most horrible of all inhuman crimes, then there’s no more anchor
on the boat. It can drift anywhere.
So, maybe mass murderer Ted Bundy was innocent, after all. Maybe Charles
Manson really was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Maybe American
Southerners never really kept slaves. And maybe Stalin never had millions 
of people killed. In the final analysis, this “revisionist” train ride can’t take
you anywhere but a dead end.

istorians can be a bit like scientists in the way they think — “show me
the evidence” is their motto — though they have to be imaginative
enough to look at the evidence and form a viable conclusion. Still, we’re a bit
pragmatic by nature.
So, there may have been times in this book that we’ve seemed to be more con
than pro on conspiracy theories because too many of them are way too short
on empirical evidence. But take this chapter as our mea culpa and sincere
apology. Because the truth is that sometimes, yesterday’s conspiracy theory
is proven by the passing of time to have been not theory, but fact.
These ten tales of conspiracy meander through history, from 19th-century
France to 1940s Los Angeles. Some entries are far longer than others, because
of the level of complexity involved. But each plot and each intrigue has been
proven true. So, these aren’t conspiracy theories anymore. These are ten
dark and scary instances of conspiracy fact.
The Aaron Burr Conspiracy
In the summer of 1806, America’s third president, Thomas Jefferson, received
a long and disturbing letter out of Nashville from Andrew Jackson, who would
one day be president himself. Jefferson’s mail pouch had been bulging for
more than a year with ominous letters warning him about his former vice
president, Aaron Burr. There were rumors of his plots to create a new empire
carved out of the Western territories, including the newly acquired lands of

the Louisiana Purchase, with Burr himself as its emperor. Some of the letters
had been signed, and some had been anonymous, but all of them were dis-
turbing. The letter from Jackson finally got Jefferson’s full attention.
Aaron Burr had been Jefferson’s first-term vice president, but it hadn’t been a
happy marriage. The presidential election of 1800 changed history. It was the
first and last tie in a run for the presidency — Burr and Jefferson, both
Republicans, had gotten exactly the same number of votes. John Adams came
in third. In those days, America had an electoral college, as we have today. It’s
a complex system that gets a lot of flak; each state has the number of electors
that is the same total as their representatives in the Congress. Today there is a
total of 538 of them, and the election isn’t official until they meet and vote,
which is why the popular election is in November but the swearing-in is in
January. People get appointed to be electors in all sorts of ways, because
states have their own laws, but think of it this way: When you mark your ballet
for your choice for president, you’re really voting for the electors from your
state who elect the president. The problem was that in 1800, the electors
could only vote for president — the vice president was automatically the 
man who came in second. Apart from George Washington, of course, all our
presidents up to that time had served as a vice president first, and so this was
becoming the norm, like the preparation for the big job. It was therefore
understood that former vice president Jefferson would be president, and Burr
vice president. But it was a gentlemen’s agreement, not a law. When Burr got
the same number of votes, he decided to make a bold grab for the presidency.
After all, there was no law against it. This whole mess took a long time (and a
lot of ballots) to sort out, and the whole time Burr never did the gentlemanly
thing, and simply refuse the office. Jefferson never forgave him.
The Constitution was amended to get rid of the president/vice president popu-
larity vote problem in time for the 1804 elections, and Jefferson ran for a second
term, this time dumping Burr as his running mate.
Along with being dumped by Jefferson (they barely spoke during Jefferson’s
first term), Burr finished off his political career with his infamous duel in 
1804 with Alexander Hamilton. The two men were political rivals, and when
Hamilton was killed, public opinion came down against Burr. It was a fatal 
one-two punch, and politically, Burr was finished in the East.
In the spring of 1805, Aaron Burr traveled to Pittsburgh, built himself a very
comfortable flatboat, and headed 2,200 miles down the Ohio and Mississippi to
New Orleans. Initially he traveled incognito, under the nom de treason Aaron
King. That last name says it all. Burr had decided that the real golden opportu-
nities were in the West. But he had no intention of starting over again at the
bottom. In fact, what Aaron Burr had in mind was to start at the top — all the
way at the top. From what historians can gather, Burr had three plans:
330
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

1. While still vice president, Burr told England’s king George through the
British ambassador that he would betray the U.S. if Britain would give 
him money and a few warships to help him steal the West from the 
U.S. government. As time passed, it was clear that Britain’s king either
wasn’t really interested or didn’t trust him. (Gosh, how could you not
trust him?)
2. Burr had a plot to get cozy with the Spanish and set up an alliance where
he’d get to be emperor over a new kingdom carved out of the Mississippi
Valley, in exchange for being their solid ally against the constant encroach-
ments of the new American nation into remaining Spanish holdings.
3. Burr would enlist the aid of the Spanish before betraying them and leading
his hardy band of frontiersmen into either Florida or the West to carve out
a new empire for himself. It was clear he’d take either place, Florida or the
Mississippi Valley, or even the far West, so long as he got to be king of it.
Nashville, Andrew Jackson’s home, was a common jumping-off point from land
to river traffic. Burr was popular in the territories, and while in Nashville he
spoke airily of taking over the West, as if it were a done deal, and then of 
turning his army about to invade and take Washington, D.C. He even spoke of
assassinating Thomas Jefferson. Andrew Jackson had welcomed Burr at first,
but this sort of thing turned Jackson, and prompted his letter to the president.
In it, he brilliantly outlined all Burr’s potential plans in great detail, based
mostly on intelligent guesswork. He also mentioned a “certain general,” never
by name, as being Burr’s henchman in the plot. Everyone knew he was talking
about General James Wilkinson, a close friend of Burr’s since they had fought
together in the Revolutionary War, who was at that time both the commanding
general of America’s army and the governor of the northern Louisiana
Territory.
In fact, Wilkinson had been a spy in the pay of the Spanish government for
years. And, he and Burr had been plotting this scheme about the West for
nearly as long, sending coded letters to one another, meeting in the dark of
night, and in general shopping around for just the right opportunity. But by the
late autumn of 1806, General Wilkinson found himself in a prickly position. He
had pledged his loyalty to the United States government, to the King of Spain,
and to Aaron Burr. And there he sat, upriver from New Orleans, facing a force of
Spanish soldiers on the eastern side of the Sabine River, the side that suppos-
edly belonged to America. They were obviously getting ready for a showdown
over the border, perhaps even an attempt to take territory that the U.S. bought
in the Louisiana Purchase. Wilkinson was ordered from Washington to stop
them by force if they tried, this Spanish army whose possessions in America
he’d sworn to protect. But Wilkinson was also supposed to wait where he was
for Aaron Burr’s forces, gathering on Blennerhassett Island in Virginia to make
their trip down the Ohio and Mississippi to meet up with him. Then they would
cross the lines to meet the Spanish officers with whom Wilkinson had remained
chummy, and together they would invade New Orleans, cutting the heart out of
the Louisiana Purchase, and betraying Jefferson.
331
Chapter 17: Ten Conspiracies That Were Absolutely True

Yet, Burr’s constant delays, for lack of funds, had given Wilkinson too much
time to get cold feet. When Burr’s letter came proclaiming that the attack
wasn’t some far distant dream date, but now, Wilkinson decided to rethink the
matter. If he betrayed Aaron Burr and gave him up to the president, he would
have the government’s eternal thanks. And if he made out to the Spanish that
Burr had been planning to double-cross them, that Burr had been their real
enemy all along, but on-the-ball Wilkinson had been there to stop him from
stealing Spanish territory, he’d be a hero with his Spanish paymasters, as well.
This seemed like a better idea all the way around.
So, Wilkinson betrayed his friend and brother-in-arms, and wrote to Jefferson
to tell him all about it. Of course, he had to be a little vague, because if he
wrote too much, someone might have had the common sense to ask, “Hey,
how do you know so much about it?” He gave over just enough information
about the “widespread conspiracy” of which he’d been a part to finally 
propel Jefferson to take action. The president sent the Virginia militia to go
downriver and arrest Burr and his men.
Burr’s trial took place that summer in Richmond, Virginia. By another simple
twist of fate, Aaron Burr ended up with the most subtle legal mind of the 
century sitting the bench in his case — Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
John Marshall. Marshall was a first cousin to President Jefferson, but they
despised one another politically. Of course, this didn’t mean Burr was auto-
matically going to walk; Justice Marshall was too honorable for that. Also,
Burr happened to be the murderer of Marshall’s close political ally and 
friend, Alexander Hamilton. None of these factors entered into Marshall’s 
performance on the bench.
With a dream team for both the prosecution and the defense, both sides spent
days on end arguing subtle legal points, with famous lawyers drafted into jury
duty who interrupted to ask questions of their own. The crowd was so large
that the trial had to be moved to the House of Delegates in the Capital build-
ing. John Marshall, always calm and controlled, didn’t let any of the sideshow
throw him. His instructions to the jury interpreting the Constitution stated
that he saw no evidence of an “overt act” of treason, nor had the state pro-
duced the necessary two witnesses to such an act. Therefore, he didn’t see
that Burr could be convicted of “levying war” against the United States, as the
law was written.
The jury agreed, and declared Burr not guilty, with a little addendum that the
charge was “not proven,” a leftover verdict available under the old British
common law system. In other words, “we think he did it, but the prosecution
didn’t prove it.” Burr was a free man. Jefferson, of course, was livid, but he
had his share of satisfaction. Burr would never again hold public office, and
for the rest of his life would be marked a traitor.

The Tuskegee Study of Untreated
Syphilis in the Negro Male
The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male was a clinical
study conducted in Tuskegee, Alabama, from 1932 to 1972, funded by the
Public Health Department with the support of the prestigious Tuskegee
Institute and its hospital. The study was patterned after a similar one in Oslo,
Norway, on white men. A total of 399 black men with syphilis were studied
over the course of 40 years, with a control group of 201 healthy black men.
These men were mostly illiterate sharecroppers in the rural South, and it was
easy for the doctors running the show to mislead them.
In 1929, when the study was proposed, there was no viable cure for syphilis,
and very legitimate questions were being raised about the medications used
to treat it. These “treatments” consisted of caustic and poisonous substances
like arsenic and mercury, that were probably doing the patients more harm
than good. That’s why, originally, there was nothing cruel about the structure
of the experiment, except perhaps for the fact that it involved black men only.
But the argument for using black men was that syphilis was a particular
plague in that community: That’s why the Tuskegee Institute was involved
with it. Tuskegee was founded by a former slave, Booker T. Washington, and a
former slave owner, who came together in the post–Civil War South to create a
“normal school,” a teaching college to improve scholastic opportunities for
freed slaves.
But two decades later, in 1947, this legitimate medical study turned into a
nightmare of abuse. That’s because in 1947, the wonder drug penicillin
became widely available. One shot of penicillin stomped syphilis flat. So, of
course, you’d think that the researchers would simply cure their patients with
syphilis, right? Wrong. These doctors went right on lying to these men, allow-
ing the syphilis to run its painful and potentially deadly course, just to see
what would happen. At every turn, they tried to keep the men in the trials
unaware that there was a cure out there for them now. The horrors of syphilis
are absolutely biblical, starting with boils and fevers, then blindness or crip-
pling loss of muscle control, and ending years later in an excruciatingly painful
death. But these “doctors” stood back and watched, just to see and record
what would happen.
Finally, a venereal disease investigator named Peter Buxtun discovered what
was going on, and the story broke in 1972 in the Washington Star and The New
York Times. The public was appalled. This event has since gone down in his-
tory as the most notorious medical experiment ever conducted in the United
States, and many new laws were enacted to protect the rights of sick people
taking part in medical studies.

Chapter 17: Ten Conspiracies That Were Absolutely True

The General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy
The reason that the major streets of America have no charming streetcars 
running down the main thoroughfares is quite simply because General Motors,
Standard Oil, Firestone Tire Company, and Phillips Petroleum all got together
in a massive conspiracy to destroy the streetcar. They used every trick in the
book to do it.
The four companies, all tied hand and foot to the growth of the automobile,
formed a holding company called National City Lines (NCL). All throughout
the 1940s and early 1950s, the NCL traveled all over the country, buying up
more than 100 electric interurban systems in 45 cities. And then they junked
them, replacing them with buses.
General Motors had been working for some time to eliminate competition
from streetcars, and Standard Oil practically invented the sort of “sink the
competition at any price” tactics that had caused many antitrust and fair-
trade laws to be passed. Together, especially after they got people, like the
Interstate Highway Commission, on their side, they ensured that the days of
the streetcar were numbered. Eventually General Motors was prosecuted
under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but the judge thought the case lacked
merit, and the company was fined a measly $5,000.
Project MKULTRA — The CIA’s Mind
Control and LSD Experiments
Project MKULTRA was the CIA’s attempt to use LSD and other drugs to interro-
gate enemy agents, and, more ominously, to attempt to discover the inner
secrets of the buzzword of the day, “brainwashing.” They dreamed of a
“Manchurian Candidate” effect, using LSD to create mind-controlled assassins.
The entire project was an absurd waste of time, money, and worst of all,
human lives.
The same thing was going on in other countries, but within MKULTRA, the
most unethical part of the study was the general lack of informed consent.
Various people, soldiers and civilians, were drugged with LSD by the CIA 
without their knowledge, just so they could play mind games with them to see
the effects of the drug. Several of these subjects suffered permanent mental
damage, some went literally mad, and a few even committed suicide.
Throughout the early 1970s, the CIA was pressured from all sides to reveal the
facts of MKULTRA. But many of the records for the project had been
destroyed. Still, thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, the papers that
have survived are pretty damning.
334
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Although it’s impossible to tie all the incidents of madness, addiction, and 
suicide to MKULTRA without a shadow of doubt, the project paperwork makes
plausible deniability difficult to achieve. Clinical research eventually proved
that LSD not only caused temporary or recurring psychosis, but that in roughly
4 in 1,000 users, it caused a permanent state of psychosis.
When ex-CIA director William Colby was subpoenaed to testify about the
reopened MKULTRA case in 1993, he was found a few days later face down in
the river near his vacation home. The death was ruled to have been accidental.
Those who are cynical have our sympathy.
The Ford Pinto Memorandum
The Pinto was marketed by Ford from 1971 to 1980 to try to feed the new
American appetite for smaller cars. With its dinkster four-cylinder engine, the
Pinto was battling the Volkswagon Beetle and the Toyota Corolla for the hearts
and minds of those who wanted sewing-machine engines under their hoods.
Up until the first gas crisis of the 1970s, Americans were used to 30-cent-a-
gallon gasoline. So American engineers weren’t quite used to this business of
dropping weight wherever possible in order to increase gas mileage.
Consequently, the Pinto contained a major and potentially dangerous design
flaw — the car had no classic, heavyweight bumper, as well as little reinforce-
ment between the rear panel and the gas tank. When a Pinto got rear-ended, it
was far too easy, even in a relatively minor accident, for the fuel tank to be 
ruptured, or worse, driven into the differential and punctured by the large bolts
that held it in place. On top of this flaw, the doors could very easily jam after an
accident, again due to the cracker-box construction that caused the metal to
be so easily twisted and compressed. In other words, the Pinto was a deathtrap
on four wheels.
Now the conspiracy begins. Ford was fully aware of all these construction prob-
lems. However, people didn’t know that, until Mother Jones magazine published
a stolen copy of an infamous memo that was sent out to all senior management
at the Ford Motor Company.
Here are the highlights of the memo on the altar worshipping the Almighty
buck:
1. With expected unit sales of 11 million Pintos, and a total cost per unit to
modify the fuel tank of $11, a recall would have cost Ford $121 million.
2. But, using mathematical formulations of a probable 2,100 accidents that
might result in 180 burn deaths, 180 seriously burned victims, and 2,100
burned-out vehicles, the “unit cost” per accident, assuming an out-of-
court settlement, came to a probable $200,000 per death, $67,000 per
serious injury, and $700 per burned-out vehicle, leaving a grand total of
$49.53 million.
335
Chapter 17: Ten Conspiracies That Were Absolutely True

3. Allowing the accidents to occur represented a net savings of nearly $70
million.
4. Therefore, a human life was mathematically proven to be worth less
than an $11 part.
Ford continued to build and market the Pinto without modifications. Or so
they thought, until news of the memo broke. It led to criminal charges, an
avalanche of lawsuits, and a recall of all Pintos; the mess went on for years.
Not to mention the fact that Ford got some of the worst press an American
car company has ever received. Later studies indicated that the Pinto may
not have been any more prone to blowing up on contact than any other car,
but by that time the damage was done.
The FDR Putsch Conspiracy
Though it’s long forgotten today, the FDR Putsch Conspiracy was a serious
threat to the presidency. This theory has also been called the Business Plot,
but we just love the word putsch, the German term for an attempt to over-
throw a government. This potential putsch was revealed to the American
public during the hearings of the McCormack-Dickstein Committee, which 
was a precursor to HUAC, or the House Un-American Activities Committee.
The purpose of the hearings was to look for influence of Nazis and Nazi propa-
ganda in American culture. What they got was an unexpected face-full from a
retired Marine Corps major general named Smedley Butler. He was a highly
decorated military officer (he won the Medal of Honor twice) and was greatly
respected by the common soldiery, but he could also be a teeny-weeny bit of a
loose cannon.
Smedley Butler was asked to testify before the committee, and he informed
them that a shadowy group of men had come to him with a plan to overthrow
President Roosevelt and take over the government. He claimed that these men
were being funded by an organization called the American Liberty League, and
that the organization had approached him through their strong contacts in the
American Legion. Butler said they offered him half a million men, $30 million,
and terrific conscience balm, because they weren’t exactly going to get rid of
Roosevelt. They would simply install one of their own in a newly created
office, and he would keep Roosevelt in line, as a pampered and protected 
figurehead.
More than any other president in U.S. history, Roosevelt used the power of
his personality, combined with the disaster of the Great Depression that had
gotten him elected, to completely restructure the capitalist system as well as
the power of the federal government. For Roosevelt’s enemies, his ever-tight-
ening grip on the office proved that if he wasn’t a dictator, he was the next
336
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

best thing. Those enemies would grow bitter over the years, as Roosevelt
was elected to an unprecedented four terms. Only death had the power to 
get him out of the Oval Office.
The congressional committee investigated and then corroborated Smedley
Butler’s story, as well as dug up a couple of other officers who claimed that
they’d been approached. Basically their final report said that they believed
him. So why wasn’t anyone arrested? Maybe the White House didn’t think
there was enough evidence to prove treason, like the Burr case discussed
earlier in this chapter. Or maybe FDR just wanted to have something great to
hang over the heads of his Wall Street enemies to keep them in line.
The P2 Masonic Lodge Conspiracy
The P2 Masonic Lodge Conspiracy is still going on and is still considered
Italy’s most lethal political plot since the days of the old Roman Empire. It
involved the Vatican, the Mafia, the Freemasons, and a collection of very
shady power-brokers. New revelations about this vast banking conspiracy are
still coming out, more than 20 years after the scandal first broke.
In 1877, a Masonic lodge was chartered by the Grand Orient of Italy, called
Propaganda Due (pronounced doo-ay, Italian for “two”). Propaganda Due
Lodge over the years became a meeting place for dirty-dealing Italian busi-
nessmen, as well as government and military officials, many of whom had
Mafia connections. By 1976, it had become so notorious that the Grand
Master of the Grand Orient of Italy finally ordered it shut down. He pulled its
charter, and expelled its members as well as its Worshipful Master, Licio Gelli.
In response, Gelli simply collected up the mailing lists of his 1,000 or so mem-
bers and went right back into business. He called the group P2 Lodge and still
ran it like a Masonic lodge. Never mind that it was illegal, unrecognized, and
unsanctioned by any Masonic body.
Two of Gelli’s cohorts were Roberto Calvi, a Milan bank chairman who was
secretly smuggling cash out of the country, and Michele “the Shark” Sindora,
a banker who was in the employ of the Mafia. Sindora and Calvi were both in
charge of managing the investments of the Vatican, and it appeared they were
using Vatican accounts to launder Mafia heroin money. In 1981, police raided
Gelli’s offices of the P2 Lodge and made some jaw-dropping discoveries:
 P2 was literally a state within a state, the ultimate gray eminence.
 The list of over 1,000 P2 members was a who’s who of anyone with
power and money in Italy.
 There was ample evidence of Robert Calvi’s money laundering within his
Banco Ambrosiano, which seemed to be a sort of P2 private bank.
337
Chapter 17: Ten Conspiracies That Were Absolutely True

An audit was immediately called for the bank. It revealed that nearly 1.3 billion
dollars had gone missing. Oops!
Banco Ambrosiano collapsed. Roberto Calvi was tried and sentenced to 
four years. However, he was released on bail pending a new trial, and went
merrily on working at the bank, now cleverly renamed the Nuovo (New) 
Banco Amrosiano. The bank shut down its off-shore banking, and while every-
one argued over who would take the losses, the Vatican quietly replaced 
the money.
The darkest aspect of the tangle of conspiracies behind the P2 Lodge is the
possibility of their involvement in the murder of “the Smiling Pope,” Pope
John Paul I. He was a reformer, and he’d begun looking into the affairs of the
Vatican Bank. He died on September 28, 1978, a shocking 33 days after his
election, and the cause of his death has been much debated. First it was said
to have been a myocardial infarction, a type of heart attack, though his long-
time physician said he had no history of heart trouble. It’s traditional not to
perform an autopsy on a pope, although it had been done once before. But
even more shocking was the fact that his body was embalmed within four
hours of his death, thereby effectively destroying any proof that he could have
been poisoned.
After the P2 scandal, the government fell in May of 1982. In July, Italy outlawed
all secret societies. Meanwhile, Roberto Calvi fled to London, where he
thought he’d be safe. He wasn’t. On June 18, 1982, Calvi was found twisting at
the end of a rope under Blackfriar’s Bridge, his pockets stuffed with bricks,
and his feet dangling in the Thames River.
NATO, Nazis, and the Gehlen Conspiracy
It’s not pleasant to report a conspiracy between Americans and Nazis, but the
truth is still the truth. It happened.
After World War II, most fleeing Nazi officers were terrified of being caught by
the Russians, and practically groveled to get into gentler American hands. But
Major General Reinhard Gehlen sauntered into Bavaria and announced he
would only surrender to American intelligence. He then told them that buried
in the Alps, in various locations that only he knew, were microfilmed copies in
watertight containers of all the intelligence paperwork the Nazis possessed on
Russia; her weapons and officers, her military structure, and her battlefield
tactics. Needless to say, he got what he wanted. Gehlen and a small corps of
his closest officers were given forged documents, put into American uniforms,
and flown to the United States, where they went to work for us.
Working with the CIA, Gehlen helped to set up an entire network of what were
called “stay behind” armies, paramilitary groups funded by the American 
government and given weapons. They were to be made operational either in
338
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

the case of a Soviet invasion, or the less likely but possible victory of the 
communists at the polls, which was a major fear in Italy. These various stay
behind armies operated under the CIA and NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, a union of Western nations protecting Europe from the Russians)
for over 40 years, and they employed not only ex-Nazis, but a whole laundry
list of undesirable types, from Mafiosos, to terrorists, to all-purpose thugs.
The CAN Coverup
The Cult Awareness Network (CAN) was a place for families to turn to when
their kids had become involved in religious cults that might be dangerous.
CAN kept records on the status and practices of over 200 mind-control orga-
nizations. It was founded by Patricia Ryan, daughter of Congressman Leo
Ryan, who was assassinated in Guyana by members of Jim Jones’s People’s
Temple cult. According to a Time magazine article from 1991, CAN got more
concerned phone calls about Scientology than any other single organization.
To quote the Chicago chapter’s executive director, “Scientology is quite likely
the most ruthless, the most classically terroristic, the most litigious, and the
most lucrative cult the country has ever seen. No cult extracts more money
from its members.”
That’s what made it so ironic that in the end, it was Scientology that would
pervert the Cult Awareness Network. Scientology keeps a veritable coven of
lawyers on call, and anyone who criticizes them, in any way, finds himself del-
uged by lawsuits. After the magazine article quoted above was released, they
turned their guns full facing on the CAN:
1. First, they filed 50 civil lawsuits against them all over the U.S.
2. Next, they filed dozens of frivolous discrimination complaints against
CAN with state-level human rights commissions. By 1994, CAN, which
had an annual budget of about $300,000 a year, had been dumped by its
insurers and owed tens of thousands of dollars to attorneys.
3. At the same time, Scientologists infiltrated CAN with employees who
spied on the organization’s day-to-day operations.
These were all the same ruthlessly successful tactics that the Church of
Scientology used in order to take their pride of place as the only organization
in American history to take on the IRS and come out the winner. Even Al
Capone couldn’t pull that one off. Despite the fact that many European nations
refuse to grant Scientology the status of a religion, the church enjoys a special
status with the IRS not granted to any other organization.
CAN did go down fighting. After some insulting remarks about the organization,
CAN filed a few countersuits, but it was David and Goliath, and this David got
creamed. The Scientologists drove CAN into bankruptcy, and all CAN’s records
339
Chapter 17: Ten Conspiracies That Were Absolutely True

ended up in the hands of the Church of Scientology. Then, once CAN had been
driven into receivership, the Scientologists bought the Cult Awareness
Network! They didn’t change the name, or the supposed purpose. And so now,
when a frightened wife or husband or parent calls looking for help because
someone they love has been sucked into a cult, the person answering the
phone is a Scientologist. Worse, the caller will not be informed of this fact. So,
despite the fact that to many people around the world, Scientology is itself a
cult, they remain the friendly folks behind the “Cult Awareness Network.”
The Dreyfus Affair
The Dreyfus Conspiracy, what came to be known as L’affair Dreyfus, or the
Dreyfus Affair, scared the French government out of 100 years’ growth.
Literally. It happened in the late 19th century, and it went on for 12 nightmarish
years — one of the ugliest and longest-running conspiracies of all time. And 
the fact is, the French still don’t like to talk about it.
The year was 1894. The French nation’s particular enemy at that time was
Germany; the last German invasion of France had occurred in 1868, in a war
that the French lost. With the defeat at the hands of Germany still fresh in
everyone’s mind, someone in the French Ministry of War was selling artillery
secrets to the Germans. When this fact was discovered, an innocent young 
captain in the Ministry, Alfred Dreyfus, was the perfect fall guy, made to order,
because he was Jewish.
Dreyfus’s sudden and unexpected arrest came with the discovery of the infa-
mous bordereau (a memorandum or a list). This bordereau was a torn-up note
describing the new French 120mm field howitzer. The piece of paper was found
in a wastebasket in the German Embassy in Paris, in the office of the German
military attaché, by a maid in the service of French intelligence. Naturally, an
artillery officer would be suspected, because of the specifics of the note. And
because the handwriting on it was somewhat similar to Dreyfus’s, he was
arrested.
In an irregular and scandalously short court-martial, with no evidence apart
from the note (a note that Dreyfus and his counsel weren’t allowed to see),
Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on the Devil’s
Island penal colony off the coast of French Guiana in South America — a hell
on earth if ever there was one.
The Ministry thought it had everything neatly tucked away. But though
Dreyfus was gone, he wasn’t forgotten. Unfortunately, anyone who tried to
reexamine the case ended up sharing his fate. The defender of truth who suf-
fered most was Lieutenant-Colonel Georges Picquart. The Dreyfus court-mar-
tial had always smelled funny to him, and when he was promoted to the office
340
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

of Chief of Army Intelligence in 1896, it didn’t take him long to discover who
the real traitor was; one Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy, who had already
been accused, in 1892, of having become too chummy with the German mili-
tary attaché. His handwriting was a far better match than Dreyfus’s had been.
But the War Ministry wouldn’t back down, even when Colonel Picquart com-
pletely exposed Esterhazy as a spy. Unbelievably, despite the mountain of evi-
dence against him, Esterhazy was acquitted in a closed-door court-martial in
1898. As for Picquart, he was demoted from his position and accused of
having written the bordereau himself; he was promptly arrested and jailed, to
await court-martial.
After Dreyfus was found guilty of treason, he was officially stripped of his mili-
tary honors on January 5, 1895. In this ancient ceremony of being degraded,
or cashiered, Dreyfus was displayed to the public in a cobbled courtyard. His
epaulets and buttons were torn from his military coat, his sword broken in
two. There was a large crowd to witness the degradation of the “Jew traitor.”
Two very important people were standing there in that crowd. They would
soon extend the effect of this tragic moment in history far and away beyond
Paris or the French military. These men were:
 Theodore Herzl: A Viennese attorney and newspaperman working in
France as a foreign correspondent. Like many Jews of his day, Herzl
thought of himself as a “modern” Jew, and he believed that the best way
to defeat anti-Semitism was through assimilation, which meant being a
German or a Frenchman or whatever first, and a Jew second. Dreyfus, the
first Jew in the War Ministry, was the ideal for assimilation. But when
Herzl covered the Dreyfus trial, when he witnessed Dreyfus’s degrada-
tion, as well as the bloody anti-Semitic riots that came after it, he did a
complete about-face. It was Theodore Herzl who conceived the idea of
“Zionism,” meaning that Jews should have a homeland of their own. His
work would bear fruit in 1948, with the establishment of the state of
Israel in the former British Palestine.
 Emile Zola: France’s greatest living writer. He believed in the innocence of
Dreyfus, and, furious over Dreyfus’s degradation and Picquart’s “coverup”
arrest, he wrote the greatest single newspaper essay of all time, on
January 13, 1898: “J’accuse,” French for “I accuse.” It was written in the
form of an open letter to the president and the French government,
sharply firing off one accusation after another. He definitely named names.
Eventually Zola was brought to trail for criminal libel. A month after the
absurd acquittal of Esterhazy, Zola was found guilty, whereupon he hot-footed
it to England. But the government had underestimated the firestorm created
by the publication of Zola’s newspaper essay — “J’accuse” sold 200,000 copies
the first day. After Colonel Picquart was jailed and Zola driven out of France,
no one was talking about anything else. The whole country was splitting into
two parties, the “Dreyfusards,” and the “anti-Dreyfusards.”
341
Chapter 17: Ten Conspiracies That Were Absolutely True

Finally, the New Minister of War, Godfrey Cavaignac, decided to find out once
and for all what was going on. One of Zola’s charges was that many of the doc-
uments that condemned Dreyfus and Picquart were forged. Cavaignac set one
of his men to work to examine the documents, and a startling discovery was
made on the very first one; it was a sneaky composite of two different docu-
ments that were two years apart. Eventually Cavaignac’s men discovered one
forgery after another, phony telegrams, wires, and departmental paperwork,
most of it the work of a Major Joseph Henry, a chief witness against Dreyfus in
the original 1894 court-martial. The whole house of cards collapsed around
the conspirators with stunning speed. Major Henry was arrested and held for
questioning, after which the spy Esterhazy fled the country. Major Henry then
slit his throat with his shaving razor.
Unlike Esterhazy, who would die in exile in England, Zola came back within a
year to see the fall of the government he’d accused. He was then offered a
pardon. It wasn’t an exoneration, but he’d achieved what he wanted and so
didn’t really care.
Dreyfus faced the same choice. In June of 1899, he was finally released from
Devil’s Island to face a new court-martial. Unfortunately, the government also
offered him a pardon instead if he chose, meaning he could go free and not
have to face either the new court-martial or a return to Devil’s Island — but he
would still be considered guilty. A physically shattered Dreyfus accepted the
pardon, certain that a return to Devil’s Island would mean his death.
Finally, in 1906, the French Supreme Court completely exonerated Dreyfus.
Within the week he was formally re-instated in the army as a major, and was
given France’s highest award, the Legion of Honor. The noble Picquart’s name
was cleared as well, and he became a brigadier general and eventually the
Minister of War.
And for anyone who thinks all the bitterness ended there, it didn’t. The 
hatred lived on for years — someone even tried to assassinate Dreyfus at
Zola’s funeral. And in 1986, a statue of Dreyfus, titled 1986, was commissioned
to stand before the prestigious Ecole Militaire, France’s military academy and
Dreyfus’s alma mater. The officers and students refused point blank to allow 
it on the grounds. It’s spent the years since then being carted from place to
place all over Paris, like some sort of party game where the last guy holding
the statue has to take his pants off and sing the Marseillaise while balancing a
beer stein on his head. The French may like to gripe about Americans being
“warmongers,” but they still get really testy if you mention the Dreyfus Affair.
Perhaps this is understandable, because in the century since this massive
conspiracy to imprison two innocent men was uncovered, not one person has
ever been tried, or even charged, over their part in the plot.

Ten Weirdest Secret 
Societies of All Time
In This Chapter
 Exploring extremely extreme secret societies
 Bellying up to bastions of the bizarre
W
e’ve all known that kid in school who was weird just for the sake of
being weird. In fact, we’ll fess up and just let you know right now, both
of us were that sort of oddball. Chris was, anyhow. Well, there have been
thousands of secret societies over the centuries, and more than a few have
been abnormal, eccentric, unorthodox, and more than a little strange. This
chapter covers a collection of secret societies that run the gamut from
mostly harmless to truly dangerous, and all points in between — but all of
them are truly bizarre.
Bohemian Grove
The Bohemian Grove is actually more like the summer camp for a creepy,
world-dominating secret society. It’s the name of the massive country retreat
of San Francisco’s Republican, male-only Bohemian Club, but it’s more com-
monly used as a term used to describe their lakeside gathering of the world’s
most influential business and political figures. This getaway is a retreat from
reporters, advisors, wives, and other pests, and an opportunity to dress like
slobs (or occasionally in drag), and the chance to drink like Jimmy Buffet
fans on steroids.
The centerpiece of the annual Bohemian Grove festivities is the Cremation of
Care ceremony, where a statue representing cares, woes, and responsibility is
burned in a lavish pyrotechnic display by men dressed as priests in front of a
large owl sculpture, which is the symbol of the Grove. Detractors have
claimed the “body” used is actually a real human sacrifice. As impressive as
that would be if it were true, the chief obsession of participants, from Henry
Kissinger and George H. W. Bush to the most famous captains of business,

seems to be, as we reveal in far more detail in Chapter 15, the freedom to uri-
nate on trees without paparazzi photographing their shortcomings, if you get
our drift.
Carnation-Painted Eyebrows Society
In spite of the seemingly precious-sounding name, the Carnation-Painted
Eyebrows Society was one of the most feared secret societies of first-century
China. It was a period of raging anarchy in China, as the Han dynasty briefly
lost control of the throne to the usurper Wang Mang, and secret groups of
bandits were carving up the country.
This group in particular rose to power and was named for the manner in
which they painted their faces before a battle. The story goes that they 
came close to seizing the throne but were crushed by a cunning military
strategy — troops loyal to the emperor painted their faces the same way as
the society to confuse society members during the battle. It worked and the
society was defeated. Seemed sort of obvious. Okay, so they didn’t think it
through.
E Clampus Vitus
Because of the wild popularity of secret societies — especially the
Freemasons (see Chapter 9) and the Odd Fellows (see Chapter 13) — in 
the 1800s, inevitably parody groups arose. One such group was E Clampus
Vitus, a Latin name that meant, well, absolutely nothing. It isn’t even real
Latin. The group’s motto, the Credo Quia Absurdium, hints to the society’s
ultimate goal: Take nothing seriously unless it’s absurd.
In 1848, only 2,000 people lived in California. After the discovery of gold at
Sutter’s Mills in 1849, 53,000 greed-crazed ’49ers poured into the territory
within just one year. Many from the East were looking for, or founded, 
lodges like they had back home. Others decided on a different path for 
their fraternalism.
E Clampus Vitus seems to have been brought to the California Gold 
Rush village of Hangtown (now more delicately called Placerville) by Joseph
H. Zumwalt from Virginia in 1850. Zumwalt founded the first “lodge” in
Mokelumne Hill, and the group quickly spread throughout Western mining
towns and camps. Members were called Clampers, or Clamperers, depending
on whom you ask, and the head of the organization was the Sublime Noble
Grand Humbug. Officers included the Grand Iscutis, the Grand Gyascutis, 
the Clamps Petrix, the Clamps Matrix, and the Royal Platrix.
344
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

This group’s “secret” sign of recognition was to extend the palms vertically,
facing out on either side of the head, stick the thumbs in each ear, and 
madly waggle their fingers. They occasionally marched in parades with the
other fraternal organizations, carrying their banner — a ladies’ hoop skirt,
festooned with the message, “This is the flag we fight under.”
Meetings were held in “Halls of Comparative Libations” (saloons). The 
initiation ceremony was essentially designed to give far more enjoyment to
the members of the club than to the new candidate and involved the sort of
serious horseplay that only a crowd of drunken miners tormenting a poor
dope in a blindfold can cook up. Hauled in “The Expungent’s Chair” (a wheel-
barrow full of wet sponges) across the rungs of a ladder on the floor, the 
candidate “crossed the rugged road to Dublin.” He was often tossed onto a
saddle that was attached to ropes looped over ceiling rafters for the ride of
his life. And sometimes lack of imagination simply knocked him in the head
and flattened him into a pile of horse dung. The point was to make it so 
raucous and unpleasant that the new recruit kept the tradition alive, if only
to seek revenge on the next initiate.
Fils d’Adam (Sons of Adam)
The Fils d’Adam were — and presumably still may very well be — a peculiar
group of necrophiliacs who hired prostitutes to do themselves up as corpses,
climb into coffins or graves, and do the dirty deed with them — lying
absolutely still, of course.
According to Alan Axelrod’s exhaustive International Encyclopedia of Secret
Societies & Fraternal Orders (Checkmark Books), this group’s other rites have
included a ritual involving sexual intercourse between females and snakes,
supposedly to atone for original sin. The group seems to be confined to
France.
The Khlysty
There’s sometimes a very fine line between secret societies and religious
sects, and sometimes a sect becomes a secret society because of its clash
with the accepted norm. This is true of the Khlysty, a sect that emerged within
the Russian Orthodox Church in the 1600s with a Russian peasant named
Daniil Filippovich, when the group immediately started getting in hot water.
And no wonder.
Khlysts didn’t much care for priests or saints or the Bible. They believed that
communion with God was a purely psychic communication with the Holy
Spirit, who could appear in human form. Christ was a mortal reincarnation of
345
Chapter 18: Ten Weirdest Secret Societies of All Time

God on Earth, but Christ’s story wasn’t an isolated incident. Humans were
constantly being born with the Holy Spirit in them, and it could happen to
anyone. The name they actually gave themselves was Khristovery, meaning
“Christ-believers.”
Like many other religious groups, they believed in self-flagellation, and the
term Khlysty actually comes from the Russian word khlyst, meaning “whip.”
But here’s where it gets a little kooky. Their reasoning went that people who
tried to lead virtuous lives were too prideful. Only someone who’d sinned a
lot could be worthy of being saved by repenting and becoming reincarnated
as God. A whole lotta sin was the path to salvation. So sin they did. Their
ritual ceremonies, called radenyi, frequently turned into wild, noisy orgies.
Members weren’t allowed to be married, because sex between legal spouses
was an abomination. Go figure.
The concept of this group then became popular all across Russia. Before the
Russian Revolution in 1917, roughly 40,000 to 65,000 members existed in the
countryside, secretly sinning their way to salvation. It’s not surprising that
the mad monk Rasputin was a member, what with all those orgies. To keep
themselves hidden from church officials, Khlysts were encouraged to show
almost fanatical devotion to the Russian Orthodox Church on the outside,
while secretly practicing the beliefs and rituals of their sect.
It’s believed that cells of Khlysts exist today. Some claim that they’re in pos-
session of Rasputin’s infamously preserved sexual anatomy, which is revered
as a sacred relic.
Los Hermanos Penitentes
The practice of whipping oneself (known as self-flagellation) as part of 
religious adoration has a long history, especially among a handful of zealous
Christians who do it to symbolize Christ’s suffering on the Way of the Cross.
The Catholic Church, as a rule, was never wild about the practice, and 
many groups of religious fanatics over the centuries were described as sacri-
legious by the church because of their excessive enthusiasm over it. Within
Catholicism, penance is one thing, but big, noisy, bloody, public processions
of the faithful ripping their backs to shreds with a cat o’ nine tails is just 
too much.
That hasn’t stopped the group, Hermanos Penitentes (the Penitent
Brotherhood). They grew out of the Spanish society in what is now Colorado
and New Mexico. While the Spaniards brought Catholicism to their American
colonies, they also brought their rigid social class structure. The Spanish
colonists were on top. Next came the native Pueblo Indians.
346
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Slavery was permitted by Spanish law, but slaves could only be held for 10 to
20 years, after which they were freed. Unfortunately, this created a cultural
purgatory for former slaves, who lived the rest of their lives as neither free
nor slave, neither Spaniard nor Indian. They were known as genizaros, and
were essentially noncitizens. They lived apart from the rest of the society 
and formed communities, customs, and a language of their own. They did the
same with their religion, and combined Catholicism — especially the teach-
ings of Franciscan friars — with native beliefs.
When Mexico gained its independence in 1821, the Spanish religious 
orders (Dominicans, Jesuits, and Franciscans) fled, or were removed, from
the country, and villages all over Mexico were reduced to little more than a
weekly visit by a traveling priest for their religious guidance. In the vacuum
of more traditional influences, the genizaros developed their own practices.
Initiation into the male order is done during Holy Week. The candidate is 
conducted to the council house (morada), where he’s stripped to the waist,
asked a series of questions, and prays for the forgiveness of his sins. He then
washes the feet of all present. Anyone he has offended may whip him during
this part of the ceremony (the whip is called a discipline). Then comes the
true test of his faith. A series of slices are made in his back, just below 
the shoulders, in the shape of crosses.
Initiates are led into the street where they publicly whip themselves, while
some drag crucifixes through the street. In chapters that do things the 
old-fashioned way, one man is picked to actually be crucified in front of the
village church, and more than a few have died over the years as a result.
This group’s beliefs combine 19th-century Catholicism with a Christian 
mysticism that seems similar to the study of Kabbalah. Their ritual has much
in common with Masonic and Rosicrucian terminology:
 Candidates seek “light.”
 The group is constituted as a brotherhood and agrees to help 
each other.
 Charity is a strong aspect of the order.
While the groups exist today throughout the southwestern U.S., there’s no
official central authority. The Hermanos Penitentes came into conflict with
American Catholic officials in the early 1900s and went underground as a
secret society. Some say they have reconciled since the end of World War II,
while others disagree. Some groups function openly, using statues instead 
of people for the scourging and crucifixions. Others clearly remain secret.
347
Chapter 18: Ten Weirdest Secret Societies of All Time

Order of the Peacock Angel
The mysterious author of the 1961 book Secret Societies Yesterday and Today
(later reissued as A History of Secret Societies, published by Citadel) went by
the pseudonym of “Arkon Daraul.” To this day no one really knows who he
was, although many believe the author was really 1960’s mystic, Idries Shah.
In the book, Daraul described a secret society called the Order of the Peacock
Angel that he came across in the posh suburbs of London. Their meetings
were distinguished by ecstatic, whirling dances to the beat of a drum, in front
of an 8-foot-tall stone statue of a large peacock.
According to Daraul, the group was brought to Britain by a Syrian expatriate
in 1913. It’s ritual seems to be based on Kabbalah and sacred numbers, and
apparently is meant to “enlighten” members into finding their true vocation
and life path. Their lodges are called halkas, and must consist of at least
seven members.
Daraul claims the real origin of this group is in Mosul, Iraq, among the
Kurdish tribes, much like the famed “whirling Dervishes.”
The Skoptzy
The Skoptzy (meaning “the castrated”) first came to the attention of Russian
authorities in the 1770s. They seem to be the inverse opposite of the Khlysts
(see the “The Khlysty” section earlier in this chapter), who existed at the
same time. While the Khlysty were sinning their way to salvation, the Skoptzy
were all about removing any vestiges of sin whatsoever.
The Skoptzy believed that Adam and Eve, when they were thrown out of
Eden, attached the Garden’s forbidden fruit to their bodies, which became
the male’s phallus and testicles and the female’s breasts. We’re only 
reporting here.
What pushes the Skoptzy over the edge was their remedy to this problem.
Their most dedicated members had themselves, let’s just say, surgically
altered, in order to return their bodies to the state of grace before the stain 
of Adam and Eve’s Original Sin. Female breasts and labia were removed, and
males were either castrated (known as the “lesser seal”) or removed the
entire set of organs (known as the “great seal”) so they more resembled a GI
Joe out of uniform. Just to add the proper amount of sacrifice, the tool used
was often a hot poker, so the subject was truly “baptized by fire.” Over the
years, to prove their courage, members used cut glass or smashed their
hated organs between two bricks. Membership was secret, and accepted
members dressed all in white at their meetings, referring to themselves as
“white doves.”
348
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Members were severely punished and publicly humiliated whenever the
Tsar’s police found them, but it’s estimated that there were close to 6,000 
of these folks in the 1870s. Some were deported to Siberia and others to
Romania, but these schemes had little effect on dissuading new recruits. The
Skoptzy believed that Christ would return to Earth after they’d achieved 
the mystical membership goal of 144,000 (an apocalyptic number mentioned
three times in the Bible’s Book of Revelation). They never did, and the sect
seems to have died off by about 1930.
The Vril Society
The Vril Society is a troublesome topic, because there’s no authentic proof
that such a group really existed, even though there’s no shortage of people
who claim that it did. What makes the alleged Vril Society really weird is that
it started out as a science fiction story and from an author who is rarely con-
nected these days with anything short of a joke.
Edward Bulwer-Lytton was a Victorian-era author whose books like The Last
Days of Pompeii made him a household name (see the sidebar “A dark and
stormy night”). In 1870 he published a science fiction novel, The Power of the
Coming Race. It described an underground race of superhuman angel-like
creatures and their mysterious energy force, Vril, an “all-permeating fluid” of
limitless power. The story goes that the people, called Vril-ya, are able to 
control this energy source with their minds, both to do good, as well as to
destroy. And, so the story goes, they’re filling up the inside of the earth and
are about to come out onto the Earth’s surface looking for new real estate.
And of course, before they can build their terrestrial civilization, the pesky
humans will have to be destroyed.
The book was a huge success, and was partially responsible for a wave of
speculation that the earth was indeed hollow and filled with aliens. The 
Vril-ya were supposed to be the descendants of Atlantis who crawled into 
the Earth’s core to escape the deluge that supposedly destroyed the leg-
endary city, and the novel became a favorite among true Atlantis believers.
More important, the term Vril became widely used as a description of “life-
giving elixir.”
In 1935, German rocket scientist and science fiction author Willy Ley fled 
Nazi Germany and came to the U.S. In an article two years later, he mentioned
that there was a group called Wahrheitsgesellschaft (Society for Truth) 
that formed to look for the real existence of Vril, in order to build a perpetual
motion machine, among other goals. Based on Ley’s mention of the group,
other researchers began making claims that a real Vril Society did exist in
Germany, before and after World War II.
349
Chapter 18: Ten Weirdest Secret Societies of All Time

In 1960, Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels published their speculative (and
largely silly) book, Morning of the Magicians, in which they made claims about
the Vril Society in Berlin being the precursor to the Thule Society and the
Nazi Party. Others have built upon their somewhat sandy foundation to claim
that the Society did indeed manage to communicate with the Vril-ya and 
that the Nazis built a Vril-powered flying saucer, the V-7, that made a flight to
Prague in 1945. At the end of the war, the Vril Society, so the story goes,
packed up its kit, took its flying saucers, and flew to a secret underground
base in Antarctica. It has also been claimed that Vril technology allowed the
Nazis to land on the Moon in 1942, where they built an underground base 
that still exists today — which sounds to us like one giant leap of delusional
fantasy for mankind.
Worshippers of the Onion
More properly known by their French name, Les Adorateurs de l’Oignon, the
Worshippers of the Onion were inspired by the writings of François Thomas,
who marveled that the onion was a perfect symbol of “conservation of
energy.” The organization was started in 1929 after François had an epiphany
in a vegetable stand in Paris. He took the name “Brother Thomas” and went
in search of disciples.
The Worshippers were organized as a society that advocated sexual absti-
nence, and used the noble onion as the pinnacle of their adoration.
According to Thomas, the miracle of the bulb is that if planted in rich earth,
it will grow. If a stem is broken to prevent it from going to seed, it becomes 
a poor eunuch — and yet still manages to germinate and grow again. He
wrote, “Prevented from having children, it becomes a child again itself. . . .
Thus, year by year, the onion is renewed in a body better than that which it
had the year before. It strives for perfection and will always live.”
Frankly, we never gave this noble vegetable that much thought, although 
it’s troubling to think of a eunuch on your hamburger. But ultimately, that a
society that didn’t believe in sex could be born in France is weird beyond
description.
