 Pref ace  
 The idea for this book started several years ago from an invitation by Helen 
Desmond at Springer to write a second edition of the 2004  Audiophotography book. 
I was busy at the time, but taken with the idea of delaying until 2014, by which time 
10 years would have elapsed. This seemed to be a good period over which it would 
be good to look back at what happened since 2004. As it turned out, the current book 
was written over a longer period than anticipated – between January 2014 and 
August 2015. This was due to a combination of work pressures in 2014 and an 
unforeseen sight problem which required a period of recovery that put the writing 
schedule back. Readers should be aware therefore that ‘Ten years on’ should be 
interpreted ﬂ exibly as meaning 10 or 11 years on, depending on when exactly the 
new chapters of the book were written, and bearing in mind that the original book 
was completed early in 2004 and took 18 months to write. 
 These ﬂ exibilities in the interpretation of time pervade more than the title of the 
book. In starting the research, I quickly realised that I would need to make decisions 
about when and how the original  Audiophotography vision was published, and that 
various related publications to the book itself date back to 1999. Unpublished work 
was also important in beginning to inﬂ uence colleagues within HP, who later went 
on to carry out related studies before and after 2004. Indeed, the earliest research in 
which the audiophoto concept emerged was a series of focus groups in 1996. This 
puts the notion of audiophotography as it occurred to me, around 19 years ago. 
Similar anomalies abound in the subsequent work I reviewed, because of lags in the 
time taken to publish any study. Sometimes sequential studies appear in publication 
in the same year, and in principle could appear in reverse order if earlier studies are 
temporarily withheld from publication or delayed due to review and publishing pro-
cesses. So the timing of studies in the literature is only an approximate indication of 
when they were done. Products are even more difﬁ cult to date, since documentation 
of releases is hard to ﬁ nd and details of obsolete products tend to hang around on the 
web. Nevertheless, the approximate timing of research and development activities 
is indicated by whatever time stamps one can ﬁ nd, and still serves to show the tre-
mendous fertility and volatility of ideas released into different scientiﬁ c and com-
mercial forums.

 The attribution of ideas to authors is also an approximate science, as is the causal 
links between ideas. Academic papers are usually co-authored, and citation of pre-
vious work does not necessarily imply direct development of an idea. So the tracing 
of developments in audiophotography had to be done somewhat delicately, and 
through awareness of what substantive elements were being ‘advanced’. 
Furthermore, boundaries between research groups started to break down when 
authorship straddled institutions, or staff later moved from one group to another. 
And groups said to be developing an element of audiophotography may not have 
thought of their work in quite that way. Despite these challenges of interpretation, it 
is clear from the review that a surprisingly small number of groups around the world 
have continued to explore the dynamics of sound and image recording since 2004, 
and have extended the claims and application of my original work. I am happy to 
have been an ongoing part of this community over the years, and look forward to 
continued collaboration with colleagues and friends in the area, both old and new.

 Acknowledgements 
 In contrast to work on the original  Audiophotography book, this has been a rela-
tively solitary journey. Nevertheless I have a number of people to thank for their 
input along the way, starting with previous colleagues at HP Labs. In particular I 
would like to thank Guy Adams, Andy Hunter, Stephen Pollard and Fraser Dickens 
for discussions relating to Chap.   7 , and Wayne Davies for gaining permission to use 
various photographs of HP products and prototypes. HP also returned the copyright 
for the original book to me, allowing Part I of this book to be reprinted here. In addi-
tion, I would like to thank the following people for comments on earlier drafts of 
individual chapters, including Elise van den Hoven, Risto Sarvas and Alan Brown. 
Alan was especially generous in lending me his business books and discussing their 
meaning over a beer or two. I am also grateful to Matthew Sansom at Surrey for his 
help in organising a related exhibition of audiophotography content and technology, 
and recommending an accessible way of archiving the audiophotographs in Part I of 
the book as a Vimeo album. This was also a vehicle for discussing the boundaries 
between art and domestic audiophotography, and its relation to video. 
 Concurrent work on the Interactive Newsprint, Light Tags and Storytelling for 
Development projects, as well as discussions within the EU COST FP1104 network 
on ‘New possibilities for print and packaging’, also contributed to my understand-
ing of Audioprint Products in Chap.   9 . I thank all colleagues involved in these col-
laborations and at Digital World more generally for their support and insights on 
augmented paper and digital storytelling. Special thanks go to Jocelyn Spence, 
Connie Golsteijn, Janko Calic, Victoria Alexander, Kristina Langhein, Peter 
Lancaster and Radu Sporea, whose support and ideas have been especially impor-
tant to me over the period of writing the book. I am also enormously grateful to my 
commissioning editor, Helen Desmond at Springer, whose patience and support at 
difﬁ cult moments have been invaluable. Her colleague James Robinson has also 
helped with editing and permissions in a way which allowed me to concentrate on 
the content of the book ﬁ rst and foremost. I am also grateful to my son Joel and 
daughter Lily for their help with creating the cover image for the book.

 Finally, I would like to acknowledge the support of the University of Surrey and 
my manager Andy Lavender in encouraging this scholarship during a time of 
increasing pressure on academics to generate new income, projects and impact in 
the world. I hope the resulting book will show that there is a role for reﬂ ecting on 
past innovations as well as for generating new ones, and that impact comes in many 
forms over long periods of time.

 Chapter 1 
 Introduction 
 Knowledge-based innovation has the longest lead time of all 
innovations. There is, ﬁ rst, a long time span between the 
emergence of new knowledge and its becoming applicable to 
technology. And then there is another long period before the 
new technology turns into products, processes or services in the 
marketplace  Drucker ( 1985 , p. 98) 
1.1  Slow Innovation 
 Corporate research labs like to work on technology that is 3–5 years away from 
introduction in the market. Any shorter, and it is not enough of a step change from 
what is out there now. Any longer, and the conditions for its deployment may have 
changed too much for it to be useful. Companies are also impatient. Who wants to 
wait more than 5 years for a new product to get to market, especially in the high tech 
industry? 
 This book is about a new photographic technology started in a corporate research 
lab. It was introduced to the market 15 years ago and was 4 years in the making 
before that. In that time, the conditions for its use have changed out of recognition 
from its early beginnings, which were pre-cameraphone, pre-internet and pre-social 
media. And the use of this technology is not yet a mass-market practice in consumer 
photography, although there are signs of its emergence as a new social media form. 
Some would conclude the technology is a failure. And who wants to write about 
failure? 
 But what if innovation is not like this: hit or miss? What if innovation is more 
like a nexus of ideas,  all of which have a ripple effect on other ideas? What if  noth-
ing is a failure, but rather a lesson pointing to a better idea? The traditional view of 
innovation is very technology-centric, and based on the notion of ‘technology trans-
fer’ into a commercial product or service. But many business and market factors are 
involved in commercialization, and few new product releases are an instant success. 
In this context, it becomes difﬁ cult to tell whether and when new technology ideas 
have become innovations, and at what point they have succeeded or failed. In fact 
short-term failure appears to be the default mode by which technology and product 
ideas get reﬁ ned and improved, and the route by which all technologies evolve. 
Most popular stories of innovation focus on a minority of cases where adoption was 

2
fast and unequivocal (e.g. Kirkpatrick  2011 ). But in fact there is usually a ‘long 
nose’ of about 20 years to the reﬁ nement and adoption of new technologies (Buxton 
 2008 ). Interestingly for the current argument, Buxton argues that “ Any technology 
that is going to have an impact in the next 5 years is already 15 years old, and still 
likely below the radar ” (op cit). 
 This being the case, perhaps we would learn more from the vast majority of cases 
where technology failed to take off as expected and was iteratively reﬁ ned and re- 
designed. This is the premise and topic of this book, using  audiophotography as its’ 
case study. 
1.2  Audiophotography 
 Ten years ago I outlined a vision for a new branch of photography incorporating 
sound (Frohlich  2004 ). I proposed that audiophotography could be a new medium 
and practice, lying somewhere between photography and videography. Still images 
with sounds offered all kinds of opportunities for capturing memories, expressing 
emotions, and telling stories in new ways, yet were not properly supported by the 
camera, display and print technology of the day. The possibility of playing back 
sounds from printed photographs (audioprints) further differentiated audiophotos 
from video clips, and seemed to open up a new design space for augmented paper 
products such as audio-enabled photo frames and albums, cards, documents and 
actual talking books. Put in a historical context, this revived a belief by Edison that 
families would want to make phonographic as well as photographic family albums, 
and seemed to me to be on a par with the addition of sound to moving images. If 
consumers preferred ‘talkies’ over silent movies, why would they NOT prefer 
audiophotos over silent photos, given the choice? 
 The evidence I presented was based on a series of small-scale user studies with 
families from the UK and US, who were given the chance to make ambient, musical, 
talking and conversational photographs, on print and on screen. Families discovered 
different properties and values for each type of sound when combined with domestic 
photographs, and their preferences for paper or screen-based playback varied with 
the social context of use. In answer to my own question above, families wanted 
sound capture as an optional feature of a camera or display device, and something 
that could be mixed or muted at playback time. This became the recommended man-
ifesto for supporting audiophotography at the end of the book, with sound as a cre-
ative new dimension of photography available at capture time or later in the history 
of the photograph; to enhance its meaning and impact in different ways. The context 
and scope of the work was limited to domestic rather than art or professional photog-
raphy, and the era was marked by the advent of the digital camera (and dictaphone), 
and the early rise of the internet. The company supporting the work was Hewlett 
Packard (HP) whose business still includes printing, imaging and computing.

1.3  Ten Years On 
 It is now 2014/2015 as I write this extended second edition of the audiophotography 
book and vision. When I wrote the ﬁ rst version, I fully expected that we would all 
be capturing and sharing sounds with our photographs by now, as routinely as we 
capture and share photos alone. Yet we are not doing this. So why not? 
 Different theories of innovation have different answers to that question. 
Management theories might suggest that HP’s market strategy was ﬂ awed. Did HP 
target innovators and early adopters for the use of audio with pictures, or were they 
working with an established majority of more conservative digital camera users that 
were just not interested in innovating themselves (Moore  2014 )? If HP had correctly 
identiﬁ ed the value proposition for the correct market, did they really implement 
with sufﬁ cient focus and market leadership to make audio the next big thing in pho-
tography (Drucker  1985 )? Then there is the question of standards. In the absence of 
an accepted ﬁ le format for audiophotos, could enough HP customers share audio-
photo material with non-customers to make it worthwhile to capture (Gawer and 
Cusumano  2002 )? 
 Sociological theories of innovation might suggest that there was not sufﬁ cient ﬁ t 
to existing photographic practices (e.g. Flichy  2007 ). In the absence of a solution for 
audioprints, how would families integrate sound into their traditional activities of 
printing audiophotographs for physical distribution and placing them in frames or 
albums? If they had moved to online distribution and display, how would they share 
audiophotos by email or on photo websites? Typically such practices change slowly 
over long periods of time, with feedback from the market inﬂ uencing, or ‘socially 
constructing’, new versions of the product (Biijker et al.  2012 ). So had customers 
been given sufﬁ cient time to experiment with different audiophoto products and 
their associated information and communication technologies, to domesticate them 
into their everyday lives (e.g. Haddon  2006 ; Shove et al  2007 )? 
 Media theorists might make a similar point to this last one. Every new medium 
requires a period of assimilation and experimentation with the content as well as the 
technology (e.g. McLuhan  2001 ; Murray  2011 ; Balsamo  2011 ). Was it even clear to 
existing customers, let alone new customers, what they were supposed to do with 
sound and what emerging genres of audiophotography they were supposed to fol-
low. Related precedents were available in the wider culture, such as photographic 
portraits, music videos, podcasts, business presentations, talking greeting cards and 
so on. But how were early adopters expected to adapt these or invent their own 
without a reference to a community of practitioners? 
 Of course there is a much a simpler explanation than all of these. Perhaps I was 
wrong about the value of audiophotos and the attraction to the consumer. Perhaps I 
‘conﬁ gured’ my users incorrectly (Woolgar  1990 ). My studies were small-scale 
after all. However, that goes for most of the studies in my professional ﬁ elds of 
design research and interaction design, and small-scale studies have always served 
me well in the past. So like the innovation theorists, I prefer to blame someone or 
something else! 
1.3 Ten Years On

 But theoretical assignment of blame doesn’t get us very far in reﬂ ecting on the 
past, present and future of audiophotography. Rather than asking why something 
never happened in a ﬁ xed amount of time, it is better to ask ‘what actually happened 
next?’ This is a more productive question, born of inductive scientiﬁ c curiosity. It is 
also closer in spirit to the view of innovation as a nexus of evolving ideas. With the 
metaphor of a ripple effect in mind, it becomes immediately obvious that you could 
look at the effect of the audiophotography vision on the immediate colleagues and 
company through which it was originated. Or you could look further aﬁ eld to its 
effect on the wider world. Within these private and public domains, you could 
examine the effect on research and development activities separately. These inter-
acting dimensions are illustrated in the ripple diagram of Fig.  1.1 .
 The internal and external circles of Fig.  1.1 reﬂ ect an important distinction in the 
literature between closed and open innovation. This hinges on the extent to which 
innovation activities are carried out ‘in-house’ or not. In recent years there has been 
growing recognition that open innovation can be cheaper and more effective for 
companies if managed correctly, drawing not only on the world’s best researchers 
and engineers across the globe but also on the ingenuity of a company’s most inno-
vative customers (e.g. Chesbrough  2003 ; von Hippel  2005 ). It applies both formally 
and informally to HP, which formally promotes a strong in-house R&D capability, 
balanced with a programme of global university and partner engagement (Savage 
 2011 ). Further forms of open innovation work informally as in house staff are inﬂ u-
enced by scientiﬁ c literature, conferences and workshops, and allowed to publish 
their own work, subject to publication approval. 
 In the audiophotography case, HP allowed a steady stream of publications of the 
work to emerge from 1999 onwards and encouraged the writing of the 2004 book to 
promote the approach (Frohlich and Tallyn  1999 ; Frohlich et al.  2000 ,  2004 ; 
 Fig. 1.1   The innovation ripple effect

Frohlich  2004 ). Further openness happened through collaboration across institu-
tions and staff turnover. For example, work on an  audiophoto desk for playback of 
sound from printed photographs was a collaboration with photographer Tony Clancy 
at the University of Central Lancashire and engineers John Robinson and Enrico 
Costanza at the University of York. Furthermore, Ella Tallyn and myself left HP by 
2005 for other university contexts at Kings College London and Surrey, leaving Guy 
Adams as the only original co-author at HP. 
 The impact on research and development can be considered separately because they 
are essentially different activities with different objectives and outputs. The aim of 
research is to generate new knowledge with either internal reports or external scientiﬁ c 
publications as outputs. The aim of development is to reﬁ ne the design and manufac-
ture of products which are themselves the output. Core research ideas and ﬁ ndings may 
have a life of their own, independent of product development, while products may 
evolve without necessarily using or generating related research. Of course company 
research labs are usually set up to inform and generate new product development 
opportunities, but the translation of research into product is not a guaranteed process – 
as this book demonstrates. In fact, there is a research-practice gap affecting this transla-
tion, especially in the new technology ﬁ eld (Norman  2010 ). Early prototoypes with 
small-scale feedback are a long way from ﬁ nished products. However, they may inspire 
other prototypes, which eventually ﬁ nd their way into the market via other companies. 
Therefore, looking at both halves of the audiophotography ripple effect in Fig.  1.1 , 
inside and outside HP, should reveal the full extent of its impact and evolution.  
1.4  How to Read This Book 
 The rest of this book is in two parts. Part I introduces the Audiophotography vision 
and technology. It contains ﬁ ve of the original chapters republished from the 2004 
book  Audiophotophotography: Bringing photos to life with sounds  (Frohlich  2004 ). 
The chapters are unabridged, apart from the correction of ﬁ gure and table numbers 
corresponding to the new chapter numbers of this book, and the modiﬁ cation of 
other cross-references. This means that ‘Related work’ sections have been left in 
tact, and are current only to 2004. More recent work is described in Part II. The 
chapters in Part I step through the properties of ambient, talking, musical and con-
versational photographs, before concluding with a discussion of paper versus screen 
preferences. Audiophotos are quoted throughout, and can be played from the follow-
ing website instead of from an accompanying CD:   https://vimeo.com/album/3548546  . 
The chapters discuss the role of different kind of sounds in six photographic activi-
ties identiﬁ ed in a ‘diamond framework’ showing the interplay of photographs, audi-
ence, subject and photographer. This framework is reproduced in Fig.  1.2 below to 
introduce new readers to these activities and their relationship to each other.
 Part II of the book then takes up the story of what happened next in HP and 
beyond. The inﬂ uence of the audiophotography work on research and development 
within HP is summarized together in Chap.   7 . However its’ inﬂ uence on external

research and development is summarized separately in Chaps.   8 and   9 . Related 
work in the broader research literature (Chap.   8 ) is traced mainly by following its 
forward citation in academic articles and books. The same technique cannot be used 
for tracing related products in Chap.   9 , so a separate review is done of  current 
audiophoto products and services that embody the original ideas across different 
platforms and technologies. This glosses the history of these products and under-
scores Buxton’s call for better ways of archiving the evolution of digital products (in 
Melanson  2011 ). In fact, while academic citation guarantees that new authors were 
aware of earlier work in further research, the lack of commercial product citation in 
new product development does not allow design inﬂ uences to be publically tracked 
in the same way. Hence I do not strictly review the inﬂ uence of audiophotography 
on related product development, but rather look for its  functionality in a snapshot of 
existing products. While limited, this has the practical beneﬁ t of exposing how it is 
possible to do audiophotography today in a way that was not possible in 2004. 
 A ﬁ nal discussion chapter takes stock of the lessons of this case study for audio-
photography and innovation. I will argue that design and innovation naturally work 
over very different (fast and slow) time frames, and that different factors are involved 
in stabilizing their relationship in research and development contexts. Design is 
deﬁ ned in ordinary language to mean the art of conceiving a plan of something 
before it is made, while innovation is deﬁ ned as making changes in something 
established by introducing new methods, ideas or products (Oxford English 
Dictionary). Design is naturally faster than innovation although there are interesting 
calls for slow design and fast innovation that will be considered in the discussion. 
Hence the book will be of interest to students, scholars and developers of digital 
media content and services, and to research and business managers concerned with

 Ambient Photographs 
 It deﬁ nitely made you more aware of your sense of hearing and 
more aware of sounds… You had to think more about capturing 
the sound and taking a photo to go with it, rather than taking a 
photo and then the sound (Debbie, audiocamera trial). 
 Sounds are an integral part of our physical environment and psychological experi-
ence. In the context of recording, ambient sounds are deﬁ ned as those which hap-
pen spontaneously without being consciously created  for the recording. These can 
be both natural and man-made. Natural sounds include the sounds of the elements 
such as water, wind and rain, and of animals such as birds, insects and mammals. 
Man- made sounds include the noises made by people themselves, such as foot-
steps, speech and music, and the sound of technology such as trafﬁ c, machinery 
and television. The balance of natural and man-made sounds changes as we move 
across geographic and cultural boundaries, between rural and urban areas, and into 
and out of buildings. Ambient sounds in general may be growing louder and more 
artiﬁ cial over time, with corresponding losses in natural sounds (Schafer  1977 ). In 
fact, each part of the world can be considered to have a  soundscape as dynamic 
and fragile as its landscape and wildlife, and equally in need of protection and 
management (Schafer  1976 ). 
 This chapter examines for the ﬁ rst time what kind of ambient sounds people 
would like to save with their photographs. It is based on an exercise in which 
families were given the ability to record sounds on a conventional camera. I 
report what kind of sounds were recorded and how they were associated with the 
images taken around the same time. I also examine the comments of participants 
as they explain why they took particular audiophotos, what they think of them, 
and how they would use them according to the diamond framework described in 
Chap.   1 . These data give an initial insight into the role of ambient sounds in all 
the activities shown in the framework. They also provide an opportunity to test 
early speculations that ambient sounds may enhance memory for a photograph, 
and that ambient photographs may even be preferable to home video clips under 
some circumstances. But to put this study onto context, I begin with a brief 
review of related work. 

12
2.1  Related Work 
 In general, there is very little scientiﬁ c work on the sentimental value of sound, and 
none which connects this to photographs. For example, social scientists have stud-
ied the physical and psychological properties of sound to understand how we hear 
and identify different sounds. However, they have failed to explore the personal 
meanings of sounds. At another level, members of the world  soundscape  move-
ment , such as Schafer referenced above, have begun to classify and map geographic 
soundscapes, and campaign for an improvement in the quality of the sonic environ-
ment. While this work calls attention to certain general preferences for natural over 
man-made sounds, it seems to stop short of mapping personal preferences within a 
soundscape (Truax  1978 ). 
 In contrast, a number of artistic projects with sound have begun to do this, and 
reveal a rich set of meanings and preferences for particular kinds of sounds. In one 
such project, the sound artist and recordist Peter Cusack collected people’s favourite 
sounds of  London  . His method was to invite proposals from members of the public 
and then go out and capture examples of these sounds for himself. Some of the 
resulting recordings were broadcast on a local radio-art station in 1998 and released 
on CD in 2001 (Cusack  2001 ). Favourite sounds of the city turn out to be highly 
ideosyncratic, and just as likely to include man-made sounds as natural sounds. The 
CD collection contains a number of natural sounds you might expect, such as a 
dawn chorus of blackbirds, a fountain, and the rise and fall of barges moored on the 
Thames. However, it also contains the less predictable sounds of underground 
trains, the bell of a London bus, Big Ben chiming and a street market packing up. 
Some sounds are extremely delicate and speciﬁ c, such as the sound of a bicycle roll-
ing over loose concrete slabs on a particular part of a canal towpath. Others are quite 
generic such as the sound of the turnstiles on entry to a football match or the sound 
of a coffee making machine. All these sounds are likely to have particular associa-
tions for the people proposing them, although these are not explored directly within 
the project. In a related piece, Cusack draws on his own memories of the Lea Valley 
in East London to create a collection of representative sounds (Cusack  2000 ). This 
time he included spoken stories of the area told by locals, alongside familiar sounds 
of the place. These were recorded around the canal running through the valley, and 
include bird and frog calls, dogs barking, footsteps under railway arches, dripping 
water, gentle motor boat sounds and conversation outside a waterside pub. The 
sounds for both these projects are loosely associated with a series of images of 
London and the Lea Valley which are included in the audio CD booklets. 
 Another noteworthy project is the  Lost and Found  Sound programme on National 
Public Radio in the United States. This is produced by the Kitchen Sisters (Davia 
Nelson & Nikki Sylva) and Jay Allison, and features stories about sound recordings 
or sound-related memories phoned in by radio listeners. For example, a recent story 
concerned the Green Street Mortuary Band and its tradition of giving past residents 
of San Fransisco’s Chinatown a musical send off. While these stories might be trig-
gered by a single radio caller, some stories are based on a host of submissions on a 
particular theme. A dramatic example of this became the  Sonic Memorial Project , in 
2 Ambient Photographs

13
which listeners were invited to send in their sound memories of the World Trade 
Centre just after its destruction on September 11th 2001. This invitation resulted in 
a ﬂ ood of stories and recordings relating to different personal memories of the 
buildings over time. Some callers described the sounds of the day itself, comment-
ing on the silence which followed the collapse of the towers. Others noted the 
sounds of the buildings in use, such as the beat of the revolving entry doors, the 
creak of the walls in a high wind, or the sound of latino music played by the South 
American janitors in the evenings. A ﬁ nal group of callers described their memories 
of the original site of the centre where music would play from loudspeakers outside 
the electronics shops of ‘Radio Row’. 
 These examples show that ambient sounds clearly trigger memories and stories 
of a location or event in much the same way that photographs do. The question that 
has not yet been answered by these projects is how such sounds might be captured 
alongside photographs, and integrated with the practice of domestic photography in 
all its forms. It is to this question that I now turn. 
2.2  The Audiocamera Trial 
 An audiocamera trial was organised to allow people to capture sounds with photo-
graphs. Ambient sounds could be captured around the time of taking each photo-
graph, or other sounds could be consciously added later by recording into the 
audiocamera device. Four PC-owning families with children were given the oppor-
tunity to capture audiophotos with this camera on their summer holidays, and to 
review them at home before commenting on a range of new product options in what 
we call a ‘feedback group’. In addition to discussing audiophoto usage, the families 
were speciﬁ cally asked about the value of sound capture and its comparison with 
home video. The study was carried out in collaboration with Ella Tallyn. 
 Middle-income families with children living at home were chosen for the study 
because they happened to be the target market for early digital cameras. In our 
study, they comprised two families of ﬁ ve and two families of four. The parents and 
all but four of the children used the unit and took part in the ensuing discussions. 
This meant that we had eight adults and six children as full participants. The partici-
pating children ranged in age from 11 to 16. Each family owned several point-and- 
shoot cameras and a multimedia home PC. 
 Families were given an audiocamera to use on their 1996 summer holiday. This 
unit comprised a Minolta compact camera combined with a slimline Lanier 
Dictaphone with an omnidirectional external microphone (see Fig.  2.1 ). Each unit 
allowed users to record photographs and sounds in any combination, but did not 
allow them to associate the two at capture time. Individual sound recordings could 
be marked with a beep on the tape. Before the trial families were visited at home and 
given a written explanation of the trial process at this stage, together with instruc-
tions and guidance on how to operate the unit. After the trial families sent their 
photos to us for developing. We then revisited each family at home for a preview 
and editing session in which we

•  discussed their experiences of using the capture units, 
•  observed and discussed their initial review of the printed photos alone and then 
in combination with their raw sound clips, and  
•  obtained their instructions regarding the arrangement and association of their 
best audiophotos for a holiday album. 
 Afterwards we edited their sound clips as instructed and supplied the family with 
a cassette tape copy for using at leisure with their prints. At the same time we used 
extracts from their best materials to make up audiophoto album demonstrations for 
the feedback group. 
 Two separate feedback groups were held for two families at a time in HP Labs 
Bristol. We structured the discussion to obtain their general impressions of the 
audiophoto medium, before asking them to summarise their private use of the edited 
tape and prints. We then showed the families a number of ways of reviewing their 
audiophoto albums on screen and paper. These are explained further in Chap.   6 , 
which examines the reactions and comments of families in this part of the study. 
 The rest of this chapter looks mainly at the ﬁ ndings of the ﬁ rst part of the trial in 
which families recorded ambient audiophotos, reviewed and commented on them, 
and selected favourites for an album. It begins by examining the kinds of audiopho-
tos that were captured initially, before considering what families said about them.  
2.3  Audiophotos Captured 
 A total of 261 photos and 158 sound clips were captured by families in the trial. 
Their structure and content reveals a lot about the attractiveness of ambient sounds 
and audiophotos. In particular, this set of audiophotos reﬂ ects the kinds of ambient 
sounds and images that participants thought they wanted to keep, before they had a

chance to see the results later on. Although the set includes audiophotos which are 
later judged to be poor or ineffective (as with any set of ordinary photos) it does not 
include sounds and images in which the photographers had no interest. The set as a 
whole therefore reﬂ ects the kind of image and sound associations that people may 
want to capture on an audiocamera. 
2.3.1  Types 
 The different types of sound recorded are shown in Fig.  2.2 . This pie chart was 
generated by classifying each sound clip as containing one or more of the types of 
sound shown in the key. Hence, these are not mutually exclusive types of sound 
clips, but rather properties or components of all the clips recorded.
 The chart shows that the three most common properties of these recordings were 
 ambient sounds  of the environment in which a photo was taken,  ambient conversa-
tion taking place between participants in the scene, and  voiceover spoken to the 
camera sometime after the photograph was taken. The chart also distinguishes 
 ambient music from more natural environmental sounds, and three other types of 
deliberate speech recordings. These were  stage directions  spoken by the photogra-
pher to subjects in the scene (such as ‘say cheese’),  interviews between the photog-
rapher and the subjects, and  live commentary designed to describe an event as it 
unfolds. These last three forms were less common but nonetheless important to the 
overall effect of the sound when they occurred. A mix of different kinds of sound 
can take place within clips as well as between them. This is illustrated in Fig.  2.3 .
 Hence, Fig.  2.3 shows a pair of audiophotos of the same people, containing ambient 
music and ambient conversation. However, in Fig.  2.3a  the ambient music of the street 
band is more prominent than the background conversation. In Fig.  2.3b the reverse is 
the case, since the hubbub of conversation in the restaurant is louder and precedes the

faint introduction of background music half-way through the clip. Note also that the 
composition of the images in these photos also affects the salience of the music. Only 
the street café photo shows the source of the music in the image – behind the main 
subject. This also illustrates how the sound and image work together to create a com-
bined audiophoto effect, since the music of Fig.  2.3 serves to call attention to the band 
in the background of the image, changing the salience of its visual features.  
2.3.2  Durations 
 Figure  2.4 shows a graph of the duration of sound clips recorded in the trial. Each 
bar in the graph represents the number of clips lying within each 5 s interval along 
the bottom. Hence, the ﬁ rst bar on the left shows that there were 22 clips between 5 
and 10 s long. Although the most popular duration was 10 s, the average duration 
overall was 24 s, with about 95 % of clips lasting under a minute.
  The shortest clips were voiceovers which served only to attach a voice label to 
the photo. Examples include 2 s clips to say ‘Sunny Zakopane’ or ‘A bendy bus’, 
and were equivalent to the kind of label that might be handwritten on the back of a 
photo or on an album page. More extensive voiceovers varied in length from 
between 5 s and about 30 s depending on the subject matter. 
 Pure ambient sound clips were about 10 s long. These included the sound of a 
horse and carriage (8 s), a tram (8 s), rain on a window (6 s), the rattle of a toy car 
(8 s), and the sound of a stream (13 s). Pure ambient conversation clips tended to be 
longer than this to allow for the closure of someone’s turn or the completion of a 
phrase. For example, there were numerous conversations recorded around a table 
ranging from 18 to 38 s. In this respect, the clip represented in Fig.  2.3b was a typi-
cal duration of 29 s. 
 The majority of clips were between 15 and 40 s and contained unfolding combi-
nations of sounds. Those containing music and talk were not cut-off in mid-sentence 
or bar and tended to reach a natural closure. This may have extended their duration 
compared to a clip of ambient sounds that could be stopped at any point. The

 combination of different types of sounds often unfolded over time, making up a 
sound event. For example, Fig.  2.5 shows two people jumping into a swimming 
pool. The sound clip lasts for 29 s and moves through a sequence of sound types. 
These start with ambient conversation and a count-down to the jump, the ambient 
sound of their splash into the water, more ambient conversation in the form of excla-
mations, and a comment from the photographer which serves to label the photo.

 The longest sound clips were music recordings made at a concert (4 min 57 s), 
live commentary on an open-topped bus tour (3 min 19 s) and a small number of 
sound-only recordings of conversations and comments, lasting 1 or 2 min. Although 
these were long in comparison to other clips recorded on the audiocamera, they are 
relatively short for recordings made on a dictaphone. This reveals the constraining 
inﬂ uence of the camera on sound recording in the trial, and the fact that sound clips 
were almost always designed to go with corresponding images. It is to the nature of 
this correspondence that we now turn. 
2.3.3  Associations 
 The capture of sound and image was completely unconstrained on the audiocamera 
unit, and our instructions encouraged participants in the trial to think about record-
ing sounds and images out of sequence and adding sounds later. However, in prac-
tice, most sounds were recorded around the time of image capture, and in strict 
chronological order. 
 Recording seemed to begin from a variety of positions around each shutter 
depression on the camera, but could not be said to precede or follow it by any pre-
dictable duration. This meant that a lot of the sound and image associations were 
obvious even to us as spectators of the audiophotos, since the two media essentially 
indexed the same event and proceeded in sequence across the recorded ﬁ lm and 
tapes. Any ambiguities were cleared up later in conversation with the families. 
 Figure  2.6 shows that about two thirds of sound clips were associated with a single 
image in the corpus. This association could usually be recognised by the sound of a 
single shutter click occurring within a sound clip, and by the connection between the 
content of images and sounds. Of the remaining one third of clips, most contained 
one or more sound clips for an  image sequence . Finally, there were a small number 
of occasions in which participants attached several sounds to the same photograph.
 Simple sound to image associations are easy to visualise and comprise audiopho-
tos like that shown in Fig.  2.5 . Other kinds are more difﬁ cult to visualise. Composite 
audiophotos with one sound for many images included action shots with a running 
commentary like a sequence of four surﬁ ng photos with a running commentary, a 
sequence of sailing photos with ambient sounds, and three photos of an obstacle race 
with 90 s of instructions and cheering sounds. A related form of  audiophoto narra-
tive was also generated when people took 2 or 3 photos of a more static scene that 
was indexed by a single piece of ambient sound or voiceover. The Restaurant picture 
of Fig.  2.3b was one of two photos taken at the time of that ambient sound. Other 
examples include the recording of a single voiceover for multiple photos of a beach. 
 Sometimes multiple sound clips were recorded for a single image. Figure  2.7 shows 
an example of this type of association. Here a comment was recorded ﬁ rst about a 
castle that was visited and photographed as shown. A further two audio clips followed, 
containing an interview between the photographer and other members of the family 
shouted between the bottom and top of the castle tower, and their joint conclusions 
when re-united at the bottom. These were rare because it was more usual for people to

record multiple phases of an event live in a single recording, as in Fig.  2.5 . Note also 
that the distinction between the sound clips in Fig.  2.7 disappears at playback, because 
the clips have been joined together to play through as a single piece.
 Many-to-many sound and image associations are a variation of the other com-
posite forms. An example is shown in Fig.  2.8 , which contains two ambient sound 
recordings for three street market photos. The photographer’s intention here was 
usually to create a mood in multiple sound clips for a set of photos that might be 
viewed together like a collage, rather than to illustrate a sequence of photos to be 
viewed one at a time. This has been indicated by printing the images as a collage in

the Figure. Technically these might be decomposed into simpler forms, but we pre-
serve them here to indicate the behaviour of capturing an entire scene with looser 
collections of sounds and images.
2.3.4  Silent Photos 
 Because of the complexity of associations between sound and images in the collec-
tion, the 158 sound clips corresponded to many more than 158 of the 261 photos 
taken. Nevertheless, a residual set of 43  silent photos were left over when these 
associations had been taken into account. There was no particular theme to the con-
tent of these photos that might explain why they were left silent. However, a com-
bination of technical features and comments by families explained why sound was 
not recorded on certain photos. 
 The majority of  silent photos occurred amongst sets for which there was already 
sufﬁ cient ambient sound coverage. A good example of this was in one family’s 
 Fig. 2.8   An audiophoto collage of two sound clips for three images

record of a trip to London. They took a variety of tourist photos with conversation, 
ambient sounds and some commentary from an open-topped bus, but six out of nine 
photos were technically silent. Another major reason for silent photos was sound 
equipment failure. This accounted for 11 out of 15 silent photos at the end of one 
family’s ﬁ lm, after the microphone batteries had run out. This resulted in conse-
quent disappointment since the family believed they were still capturing sounds 
with these images. A batch of beach photos at the end of another family’s photo set 
were also silent, due to salt water corrosion of the battery contacts in the dictaphone. 
Other reasons for not taking sound included the lack of any strong or distinctive 
sounds worth recording in certain environments, for example in the home, and the 
extra effort required to think about sound and control the dictaphone in combination 
with the camera. These factors will be discussed further below. 
2.3.5  Solitary Sound Clips 
 In addition to photos without sounds there were also a number of sounds without 
photos recorded on the audiocamera. These might be called  audiographs . Ten sound 
clips were recorded in this way during the main part of the trial, and a further six 
clips were captured by one family who asked to borrow the unit again afterwards. 
 As with  silent photos ,  solitary sound clips were sometimes recorded at the end of 
sequences when the other medium had run out. For example, the teenage children 
of one family recorded a mock argument and a summary of the day at the end of one 
tape, after the ﬁ lm in their camera had ﬁ nished. Other solitary clips were taken to 
record sounds that were considered attractive in their own right, such as street music 
and singing, or sounds that were difﬁ cult to capture with corresponding images, 
such as laughter. In one case, there was also a second take of an interview that was 
later rejected by the participants. 
 All these examples begin to indicate the value of sounds in extending what can 
be captured on a camera, and the way in which families quickly fell into the habit of 
recording sounds for this purpose. More direct evidence for the value of sound 
comes from how families reacted to their own audiophoto material, in terms of their 
preferences and comments. 
2.4  Reactions to the Audiocamera and Audiophotos 
2.4.1  Initial Reactions 
 Many of the participants initial reactions were to the audiocamera unit itself and the 
experience of recording sounds with photos. The unit was generally too complicated 
to operate and slowed down the process of taking photos. This was annoying when 
participants were trying to capture something quickly, since they had to remember 
2.4 Reactions to the Audiocamera and Audiophotos

22
to switch on both the camera and the dictaphone, and decide when to start and stop 
the sound recording in relation to taking the photograph. As one mother put it:
 In some ways it was distracting and you tended to rush the photo (Viv) 
 Most participants reported getting better at this with practice. Sometimes they 
would decide not to record sound with an image, while at other times they would 
take a picture to index a sound recorded earlier. With extended use, people appeared 
to treat the sound less as an adjunct to picture taking and more as a central or even 
primary medium to be captured with an image. This appeared to increase people’s 
awareness and atunement to sounds in the environment, as indicated in the opening 
quote of this chapter. Such  attunement appeared to increase the importance of sound 
during playback as well as during the capture period:
 For me the sound initially augmented the visuals. But then as you run through it and you’ve 
got the sound going, the visual begins to augment the sound. You start with one, and become 
driven by one of the two media that are going on. (Paul) 
 This awareness of sounds appeared to make adult participants self-conscious 
about the sounds and comments they were making in front of the audiocamera. 
Some participants mentioned not liking the sound of their own voice, or feeling 
stupid recording comments into ‘thin air’. All this was less of a problem for children 
who either ignored the audiocamera unit entirely or enjoyed playing up to it. Self- 
consciousness appeared to diminish for adults over time as they got used to the 
presence of the audiocamera, and even began to play up to it occasionally for better 
effects. For example, the very next audiophoto following the restaurant scene in 
Fig.  2.3b was of two adult members of the family singing silly lyrics to the ‘The 
Yellow Rose of Texas’ after the meal. 
 Another discovery made by participants using the audiocamera was that it raised 
privacy issues about the appropriateness of recording sound in certain situations. 
While it was ﬁ ne to record sounds within a group of friends or family who knew 
they were being recorded, it was more of a problem with strangers. Such people 
would not expect a camera to record their conversation and might be offended to 
learn that it had been used to do so. 
 This problem is similar to that encountered with camcorders, except that cam-
corders are commonly known to record sound as well as moving images. Again, 
participants appeared to get used to this constraint by avoiding sound recording in 
delicate social situations, or other locations where it seemed inappropriate. For 
example, one family had visited the site of Austwitz concentration camp in Poland, 
and felt strongly that they didn’t want to record any ambient sound there. 
 Despite some of the reservations expressed about the process of recording audio-
photos, the families were intrigued to see the results for the ﬁ rst time. Their ﬁ rst lis-
tening was accompanied by a good deal of laughter and conversational banter, and 
was followed by a ﬂ ood of comments to us about what they liked and disliked about 
the material. There was more consensus about the kinds of sounds they disliked most, 
with positive preferences for sounds and audiophotos being more idiosyncratic. 
2 Ambient Photographs

23
 The sound of the camera shutter going off within a sound clip was unanimously 
judged to be annoying. Within a gentle ambient sound clip it destroyed the mood of 
the moment. Families asked for this sound to be edited out in the process of con-
structing an album of their best audiophotos. Similar intrusions sometimes occurred 
in the form of unexpected ambient sounds like trafﬁ c going past, or someone shout-
ing in the background. For example, one clip of a distant steam train pufﬁ ng past 
was spoiled by the sound of a relative yelling at a dog in the foreground. Other 
disliked sounds included wind noise on the microphone that tended to drown out 
other sounds, nondescript sounds whose source could not be recognised, and record-
ings that were not true to life. All these have their parallels in ordinary photography 
where images can turn out to be masked by overexposure, to depict subjects too 
distant to recognise, or to contain colours that are not true to their source. 
 One surprise discovery was the relative unattractiveness of voiceovers to the 
people who had recorded them. Families who had recorded short voice labels or 
comments on their photos tended not to like these themselves at playback. They 
usually remembered the context of each photo, which after all was taken less than a 
month before, and felt that the comments were redundant. 
 In contrast, participants liked ambient sounds that were distinctive, uninterrupted 
and true to the actual sound as it was heard and remembered. If this sound also 
matched the content of an associated photo then it was usually perceived to work 
well as an audiophoto. A good example of this is shown in Fig.  2.9 , which shows a 
view of a horse and cart ride. The sound is a clear recording of the cart rattling down 
the road with the clip-clop of the horses hoofbeats in the foreground. While ambient 
commentary was also recorded on about a quarter of audiophotos, it was really these 
 Fig. 2.9   Distinctive sounds appear to make the best audiophotos 
 
2.4 Reactions to the Audiocamera and Audiophotos

24
more distinctive types of natural sounds that delighted the families most, on listen-
ing to their audiophotos for the ﬁ rst time. Further evidence of this effect was pro-
vided through the selection of ‘favourite’ audiophotos for albums we made up for 
each of the four families after their initial review of material.
2.4.2  Favourites 
 In selecting about ten audiophotos for a favourites album, families explicitly 
revealed their preferences for sound and image combinations in the set. In the 
course of making this selection, individual family members also discussed the rea-
sons for their preferences, and sometimes volunteered their overall favourite audio-
photo in the set. 
 In general, there was a preference for ambient sounds over other types. There 
was also a tendency to prefer more complex sound and image combinations in the 
favourite set. This suggests that looser or more complex associations may be con-
sidered more interesting or evocative than simple one sound one image associa-
tions. Nevertheless simple audiophotos made up the majority of favourite as well as 
non- favourite audiophotos. 
 In discussing their favourite audiophotos, families conﬁ rmed these overall pref-
erences. They listed the following types of ambient sounds among their favourite 
recordings:
•  Children’s voices 
•  Crowds 
•  Rain 
•  Running water 
•  Chinking cups 
•  Street music 
•  Foreign language being spoken 
 These sounds turned up in various individual ‘all-time’ favourite audiophotos. 
Three of these are discussed here in order to illustrate their composition and explain 
why people found them so attractive. The ﬁ rst all-time favourite is shown in 
Fig.  2.10 below.
 Figure  2.10 was taken and selected by the mother of one family (Viv), and shows 
her husband and dog in the sea. A pure ambient soundtrack has captured the lapping 
of the water as Viv walks through the shallows. Although this is a simple one-to-one 
association of sound and image which contains little additional information in the 
sound channel, it was favoured because of the way the sound added to the mood of 
the photo and reminded Viv of the peace of that particular summer evening on a 
Devon beach. As spectators on this scene we can imagine something of the external 
atmosphere involved, but to Viv herself it appears to be her own internal feelings of 
the moment that are triggered by the sound and image. The fact that it was these 
very sounds she heard, from that particular perspective, is probably important to the

effectiveness of the audiophoto in triggering this recollection, but it is the recollec-
tion itself that makes the audiophoto so special. 
 Another all-time favourite audiophoto is shown in Fig.  2.11 . This was singled 
out by the parents of Philip, shown on the far left of the photo, who recorded the 
associated voiceover describing where the photo was taken. The rest of the family 
found Philip’s mistake at the end of the voiceover very funny, because he had 
rehearsed what he was going to say several times before making this recording. 
Philip’s clear displeasure at the end of the clip added to this effect. Although this 
mixture of embarrassment and humour make the audiophoto appealing in its own 
right, its main value for the parents lies in the fact that it reveals something of 
Philip’s personality that he might not want to reveal about himself, namely that he 
likes to get things exactly right. In this respect, the audiophoto operates as an 
enhanced self-portrait.
 A ﬁ nal all-time favourite audiophoto is shown in Fig.  2.12 . This was chosen by 
Debbie, another mother in the trial. The ﬁ gure shows a collection of photos of 
Debbie’s friend and daughter, taken at her friend’s house on a weekend visit. Her 
friend was learning to play the piano at the time, and the background sounds were 
recorded while she practiced over the weekend, as shown in one of the photos. These

sounds end with Debbie wishing her daughter goodnight. This extract is an audio-
photo collage of sounds and images. The images could be made to reveal themselves 
one-at-a-time at playback, or be viewed together as shown in the ﬁ gure.
 While the individual photos were taken at different times, Debbie chose to com-
bine them with the music and conversation to create an impression of her friend’s 
house. She used to live with her friend who often ﬁ lled the house with the sound of 
her cello playing, and the sound of the piano reminded her of that. The inclusion of 
her daughter situates the photo in more contemporary times, in which Debbie has a 
new life with her own family. The selection of what sounds to record and how to 
combine them with images, opened up new creative possibilities for the families. 
This piece is an example of how some participants began to exploit these to good 
effect. Again the overall aim was to create something that operated as an effective 
reminder of thoughts and feelings of the moment, or revealed something of the 
character of the people in the photographs.  
2.4.3  The Value of Ambient Sound 
 The above discussions of favourite audiophotos begin to reveal some of the proper-
ties of ambient sound that participants valued most in the trial. For example, the 
ability of sound to add mood and humour to an image, and to foster increased cre-
ativity in photo taking, appeared to be key values of the medium. This was con-
ﬁ rmed and extended in direct discussions of the value and attraction of audio. 
 The most common comment about the addition of ambient sound to photographs 
was that it  brings the photographs to life . The notion of enlivening a still image 
through sound appeared to have a number of facets. Ambient sounds were seen to 
add a general mood or atmosphere to the scene, as in the market square shown in 
Fig.  2.8 , the café and restaurant of Fig.  2.3 , or the seascape of Fig.  2.10 . In some 
cases, a sequence of events unfolds within these clips, lending a further impression 
of the life going on within them. This is particularly evident in Fig.  2.5 where the 
depicted action of jumping into the swimming pool is introduced and completed by 
the sound clip. The sound of voices in a clip also served to bring the human subjects 
of a photo to life, and to reveal something of their thoughts and feelings of the 
moment through the recorded conversations. By these means, the photos them-
selves were seen to inherit a kind of human agency, even without the inclusion of 
deliberately staged or annotated commentary. As one person put it:
 The photo speaks for itself (Viv) 
 In bringing a photo to life, sound also appeared to supply  additional stimulation 
to trigger people’s memory of the original events. This was shown by the fact that 
the families recalled and discussed the events in greater detail when looking at the 
photos with the sounds than without them. In fact the very act of listening to the 
associated sounds made the families look longer at each photo, and attend to the 
extra details of the event that were contained in the sounds. For example, sounds 
2.4 Reactions to the Audiocamera and Audiophotos

28
might be made by objects outside the frame of the photo, such as by a waterfall 
behind the photographer in one beach scene. In other cases they contained repetitive 
or typical sounds of the location. For many of the participants these sounds seemed 
to trigger an existing sound-memory for events that might be just as salient as their 
visual-memory yet untouched by photographs alone. As one participant put it:
 I have an audio memory in my brain. (Debbie) 
 Some audiophotos were even taken for the audio memory alone. For example, 
one family reported taking the audiophoto in Fig.  2.13 only for the sound of the 
marching band. Ordinarily, they wouldn’t have taken a picture of a marching band 
at all. In this case the photo was used to index the sound, which acted as the primary 
cue for the family’s memory of the scene.
 Another major value of sound was  the element of humour it often introduced. 
There was a noticeable increase in the amount of laughter experienced looking at 
the photos with sound rather than without them. Sometimes this was due to the 
strangeness of the sounds encountered in certain locations. For example, the music 
of Fig.  2.13 was found by the same family to be playing down a salt mine visited 
later in the holiday. At other times the humour was strongly linked to the embarrass-
ment of being caught saying something revealing, as in the private conversation 
between one of the teenage girls in the trial and her friend about which members of 
a  pop band they liked the most. This is shown in Fig.  2.14 . The girls hated the audio-
photo while the rest of the family loved it. This made for an interesting discussion 
at playback time.

29
 Such embarrassment also extended to the commentary and staging of audiopho-
tos which went wrong in funny ways. The all-time favourite photo shown in Fig.  2.11 
is of this kind, where the son makes a mistake in his commentary on the mountain. 
Another example of a humorous ‘mistake’ was created by one father who tried hard 
to get his dog to bark for an audiophoto. The resulting picture of his dog is accom-
panied by increasingly desperate calls for her to bark, ending with some heavy pant-
ing as he holds the microphone to her snout. Hence, the general feeling was that:
 Its much more fun with the sound. (Thomas) 
 Its something that would prompt you to play around a bit and have more fun (Paul) 
  Two of the families did begin to play around with sound recording to exploit the 
humourous potential of sound deliberately. For example, a surﬁ ng sequence was 
done as a spoof sporting commentary by one father for his son. This turned out to 
be especially funny to everyone except the son, because of the number of times it 
took him to catch the wave. The favourite photo shown in Fig.  2.12 of a friend play-
ing the piano was later sent to the friend as a  joke . It contained her own playing, 
which she did not know was being recorded, preceded by a fast  classical piano solo 
taken from Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto Number 3. Finally, the same father and 
son team as in the surﬁ ng commentary, created the audiophoto shown in Fig.  2.15 . 
This shows the father accidentally hitting his son several times, while putting up a 
windbreak on the beach. The ambiguity of the sound and image combination is 
exploited here to tell a false story-of-the-image. All these examples not only rein-

2.4 Reactions to the Audiocamera and Audiophotos

30
force the humorous value of sound, they also show how sound encouraged people 
to take more creative photographs and audio-photo combinations.
 Perhaps the most revealing ﬁ nding about the overall value of sound was the dis-
appointment that was expressed at any sound loss. Whatever the value, it was missed 
when taken away. This happened on about three occasions when the microphone 
batteries ran out within the trial period, and when the audiocamera unit was removed 
at the end of the trial. One family had got so used to the habit of recording natural 
sounds with their photographs they asked to borrow the unit again after the trial. 
 As a ﬁ nal indication of the value of ambient sound, we asked families directly if 
they would like to use an audiocamera again if they could. Twelve out of the 14 trial 
participants said yes. Most participants felt that that sound capture would be a good 
option on a camera, to use whenever there was some interesting sound going on in 
the background. An associated perception was that this might increase the overall 
use of the camera, because there would then be two kinds of events, visual and audi-
tory, to trigger recording.

2.5  Practice 
 It is clear from the trial that users of the audiocamera began to listen more atten-
tively to sounds in their environment, and to watch for audio as well as photo 
opportunities. A number of difﬁ culties in realising these opportunities were 
revealed by comments on the process of capturing, editing and reviewing audio-
photos, and by observing review behaviours. These are drawn together in this 
section to reveal the potential of the medium for transforming current practices, 
and to identify usage problems which need to be addressed by the enabling 
technology. 
2.5.1  Capture 
 The prototype unit was generally considered to be too difﬁ cult to use, despite hav-
ing very few controls and settings. The requirement to switch on the dictaphone 
separately to the camera meant that some people missed action shots or composed 
their photos badly. The consensus view was that an audiocamera should be as auto-
matic as possible to preserve the point-and-shoot feel of a compact camera:
 There was too much to think about for a snap (Debbie) 
 There’s no time to ﬁ ddle around (Sue) 
 A number of people commented on the difﬁ culty of anticipating the quality of 
the sound being recorded at capture time, based on a series of dissappointments on 
ﬁ rst hearing the results. People seem to make the same mistake with sound capture 
as they do with image capture, in assuming that whatever they can see or hear will 
be picked up faithfully by the recording equipment. 
 Participants also expressed a variety of opinions about the overall quality of 
sound playback. In general, the  sound quality achieved on the prototype unit was 
adequate for most people, although our impression is that high ﬁ delity stereo sound 
would accentuate the feeling of being taken back into the recorded scenes by the 
ambient sound clips. People tended to complain about sound quality when the 
recording diverged too far from the remembered sound of the source; such as when 
a boat engine was said to sound like a building site. We also found more tolerance 
for poor quality sound clips by members of the capture group who share the same 
memory of the recorded event. Presumably their memory helps with the interpreta-
tion of sounds which might be unintelligible to outsiders. From these effects it 
appears that the expectation for sound quality is the same as that for image quality. 
A relatively high baseline quality is expected by most users, but some users prefer 
higher quality recordings.  
2.5 Practice

32
2.5.2  Editing 
 The fact that sound clips were recorded selectively around the time that photos were 
taken meant that the families did not need to cut out extensive portions of recorded 
sound or to signiﬁ cantly alter the order and association of sounds and photos. Most 
of the families’ requirements for editing were expressed to us in terms of exceptions 
to a “keep everything” rule. For example, we were asked to take out the bits of sound 
where “nothing happened”, such as when Thomas recorded his sister waking up, or 
when one couple waited for a cow to moo. Other bits of sound which were singled 
out for deletion were either interruptions to the clip, such as the sound of the camera 
shutter, or sources of embarrassment. However, as discussed above, it was often the 
embarrassments and mistakes in the sound tracks which added humour to the photo-
graphs and we found unaffected members of the family arguing to keep these in. 
 Arguments within the family about what sound or images should be kept or 
thrown away were common, and reﬂ ected a deeper issue about editing rights. 
Individual members of the family appeared to have different rights to editing 
depending on whether they personally took the audiophoto. Family members also 
had different opinions about the audiophotos depending on who they were going to 
be shown to outside the family. The situation was analogous to deciding which con-
ventional photos should go into the family album. Nobody wanted to look foolish 
within the formal family record, and everybody wanted to show their own version 
of an event to personal friends. 
 Another important factor for editing was that participants began to record longer 
sound clips with practice. This was particularly noticeable with one family who 
used the unit for two cycles, shooting a 36 exposure ﬁ lm each time. On the ﬁ rst 
cycle they recorded about 21 min of unedited sound, whereas on the second cycle 
they recorded about 36 min. Both sets of sounds were edited down to about 17 min. 
This implies that families may be willing to do more sound capture and editing to 
achieve better effects over time. 
2.5.3  Review 
 Most of the comments people made about the value of ambient sound were made in 
the context of thinking about its impact for them personally. To this extent, we can 
say that there was a positive perception of ambient photographs enhancing  private 
review by photographers and subjects in the trial (see again Fig.   1.2 ). Although we 
have not formally collected the feedback of a private audience on this material, 
readers might reﬂ ect on their own experience of these audiophotos in that role. 
Speaking for myself as a researcher reviewing the materials for the ﬁ rst time, the 
sounds added a good deal of context to each photo that helped me not only to inter-
pret the photos more easily, but also to picture the mood, emotions or interpretations 
of the participants more effectively. I felt I was getting more of an insight into the 
2 Ambient Photographs

33
character of the subjects of the photos with the sounds than without them. Spoken 
commentary was particularly effective in this respect, even though it was much less 
effective for the participants themselves. 
 Other comments made about the value of sharing audiophotos begin to extend 
these ﬁ ndings to the practice of  social review . For example, several people felt that 
distant family and friends would appreciate a spoken voice message with a photo, 
either as an  audiophoto postcard from the capture location, or as an  audiophoto 
reprint upon return home. It was thought that a spoken voiceover on a photo would 
be perfect for this purpose:
 Sound (commentary) would be good if you aren’t there to explain (Anna) 
 Commentary would be good for sending to people who aren’t there (Debbie) 
 There was some ambiguity about people’s perception of how they would like to 
share ambient audiophotos directly with others. At one extreme, some participants 
spoke about wanting to make up a full-blown slide show of images and sounds to 
show to family and friends as a presentation. At the other extreme, several people 
could foresee themselves showing the photos to others, such as a secretary at work, 
without the sounds, so as not to overcomplicate the process of sharing. 
 In fact this prediction came true within the methodology of the trial, since we left 
separate cassette tapes of sound clips with each family after the second home visits 
and before the feedback groups. At the feedback groups, some people reported 
showing their photos to others without playing the sounds. In between these 
extremes, the majority of people expressed a desire to selectively control or curtail 
the amount of sound that would play with each photo, so that they could adjust it for 
the audience at hand. As one participant explained:
 A choice of sound would be good. It depends on the subject matter and the audience 
(Christine) 
 The reasons for this ambiguity and sensitivity to the audience become clearer if we 
observe what happened when families began to share the audiophoto material within 
and between themselves. This happened on the second home visit when we gave 
families a chance to review their audiophotos together, and in the feedback groups 
when they were asked to show their audiophotos to another family. The ﬁ rst occasion 
represented a reminiscing situation in which photographers and subjects of the audio-
photos interacted with each other. The second occasion represented a storytelling situ-
ation in which photographers and subjects interacted with an external audience. 
 By observing audio playback from a cassette tape in the home visits, we found 
that families automatically modiﬁ ed the way they handled and discussed the photos 
in order to accommodate the audio. They switched spontaneously from passing 
individual photos along the family group (without audio playback), to a process of 
one person turning over photos in the pack whilst others looked over their shoulder. 
This led to a more intimate group experience, with much laughter and conversation 
occurring over the rolling soundtrack. 
 However, this arrangement removed individual choice of how long to look at 
each photo. In fact, the photo holders tried hard to turn over the photos in pace with 
the sounds, to preserve the correspondence between image and audio. This some-
2.5 Practice

34
times caused the families to dwell on photos with long sound clips for longer than 
they wanted to, and to speed through photos without sounds too quickly. As one 
participant said:
 There is no time to linger over the photos when you are listening to the sounds at the tape 
pace (Philip) 
 The same effect was observed in the feedback sessions later when families tried 
to show each other their favourite audiophotos from a pack of selected prints. Each 
print with sound had an audio track number written on the back, which could be 
played from a minidisc player connected to nearby speakers. Prints were turned 
over by a single member of the authoring family rather than passed around the 
group. Furthermore, photo holders tended to turn over the pack systematically and 
let the audio clips play through, rather than using the minidisc controls to pause the 
audio or randomly access audio clips out of sequence. 
 Whereas in the home visits this behaviour had led to a good deal of laughter and 
enjoyment, in the feedback session it led to frustration with the audio getting in the 
way of conversation about the photos. Ambient sounds appeared to interfere with 
storytelling:
 Its very frustrating ‘cos I want to tell Viv all about where we were and what we were doing 
but I can’t do that with the water noise on (Sue) 
 Participants pointed out how different this felt to sharing audioprints within the 
family, when listening to the ambient sounds was more fun. Here, ambient sounds 
appeared to enhance reminiscing:
 If you do this with somebody else its quite different. ‘Cos the ﬁ rst one we heard as a family 
was hilarious really wasn’t it? We had Lucy with us, and she was covering her face, and the 
girls were so embarrassed at the sound of their voices, and it was actually real fun. But that 
wouldn’t come over in an (outside) group… (Viv) 
 These ﬁ ndings show that introducing sound data into the existing activity of 
photo sharing dramatically affects its organisation and enjoyment. Ambient sounds 
seemed to enhance the experience of  reminiscing with members of the original cap-
ture group, but potentially interfered with the experience of  storytelling to others 
who weren’t there at the time. 
 However, the extent to which sounds enhanced or interfered with photo sharing 
behaviours appeared to depend on the type of sound and its method of control. We 
noticed more frustration in families who recorded more voiceover with their photos. 
Ambient sounds and music appeared to be easier to talk over than forms of recorded 
speech. We also found that families were able to control the timing and pace of 
sound playback better on a  PC album , where photo had to be clicked on before they 
began to play. The minidisc controls, although simple, were too much to think about 
in conversation where attention was focussed on the images and participants rather 
than the audio technology (see Chap.   6 for further details).

2.5.4  Comparisons Between an Audiocamera and a Camcorder 
 To explore the issue of whether many of these values are provided better by video 
recording, we asked participants at the end of the trial whether they would prefer a 
camcorder or an audiocamera at the same price. Eleven out of fourteen people pre-
ferred the audiocamera. 
 Since none of the families in the trial were camcorder owners, one might at ﬁ rst 
glance think that this result was due to the fact that they didn’t understand the beneﬁ ts 
of camcorders. However, all of the four families had experience of capturing and 
watching video or cine ﬁ lm, and were well aware of the costs as well as the beneﬁ ts 
of camcorder use. Indeed they had deliberately chosen not to buy camcorders because 
of this. This suggests that their preference for the audiocamera reﬂ ected an informed 
judgement about its true beneﬁ ts over and above a conventional camcorder. In dis-
cussing this preference, participants identiﬁ ed a number of beneﬁ ts of audiophotos. 
 Several people in the trial said they just liked the aesthetic qualities of photo-
graphs better than those of video for capturing the mood of an event or moment. For 
them, enhancing the richness of a photograph with sound was inherently more 
attractive than switching to what they see as a completely different (video) medium. 
 Another factor in the preference for an audiocamera was that it allowed the user 
to participate more fully in the scene being recorded. Some participants contrasted 
this with the lack of participation when using a camcorder:
 We don’t go on holiday to create a ﬁ lm. We are much more instant people. We prefer to live 
life rather than record it (Geoff) 
 One of the reasons we haven’t got a video camera is that it is too intrusive and you end 
up not participating the event that you are in (Mervyn) 
 People reported using the audiocapture unit selectively, like a point-and-shoot 
camera. This enabled them to get back into the scene quickly after use. Furthermore 
sound recording could be left on with the user still participating in the scene itself, 
as shown in a number of audiophotos where the user’s voice was in the sound clip. 
This is in stark contrast to video recording where the user is usually distanced from 
the scene for the entire duration of (longer) recording periods. 
 One family member commented that the audiophoto medium is easier to master 
than video for beginners. This is substantiated by any casual look at the families 
favourite audiophotos which are remarkably good for a ﬁ rst attempt at using the 
new medium.
 You need less skill and aptitude as a beginner to use this (audiocamera) than you would 
with a video. Video gives you more ﬂ exibility but aesthetically the results of the last audio-
photo set were better than a ﬁ rst go at video. (Paul) 
 The ﬁ nal appearance of video is critically dependent on the editing of raw video 
material, which is something camcorder users seldom get around to doing. In contrast 
we found that the editing requirements for audiophotos were very simple because of 
the way sound clips were recorded selectively around the time of image capture. 
2.5 Practice

36
Some trial participants recognised that this might be an advantage of audiophotos 
over home video, as long as sound editing and handling didn’t turn into a big job:
 You had to be more thoughtful about what to select with the audiocamera. It’s a one take 
opportunity.... With a camcorder you can take a chance and keep it running more. (Debbie) 
 Its different from a camcorder. You are looking for the moment (Geoff) 
 Editing is the downfall of video for personal use. Would this be the same? I couldn’t be 
bothered to edit each ﬁ lm we produce. Half the time we don’t get round to putting photos in 
albums (Paul & Viv) 
 A ﬁ nal reason for the selection of an audiocamera in preference to a camcorder 
relates to the way the captured material is reviewed. All the trial participants  without 
exception wanted to review audiophotos in the same interactive manner that they 
review ordinary photos – by discussing some audiophotos in more detail than others 
depending on the audience. While this was not always possible within the review 
scenarios experienced in the trial, a number of people seemed to recognise that this 
would be an advantage for audiophotos over watching home video presentations 
which are notoriously boring to outsiders.  
2.6  Discussion 
 Although modest in scale, the audiocamera trial has revealed a good deal about the 
properties of ambient sound for memory and communication, and its role in domes-
tic photography. In this section I draw together these lessons with reference to the 
diamond framework. 
 In general, we found that the families taking part in the trial adapted quickly to 
the use of a camera with sound, taking a large number of sound clips with their 
photographs in all kinds of contexts and forms. This device appeared to unleash a 
widespread interest in sound, as revealed in the art and radio projects mentioned at 
the beginning of the chapter. There was even evidence that this interest began to 
overtake picture taking. Hence the act of capturing sounds began as an adjunct to 
capturing pictures but soon became an equivalent or even primary task in the pro-
cess of recording memories. 
 This transformation occurred as users became better attuned to the sonic prop-
erties of their environment, and the aesthetic properties of the combined medium. 
In reviewing this medium, families were delighted to discover that sounds 
brought many of the pictures to life, gave them mood and atmosphere, and pro-
vided additional information by which to interpret and remember the moment. 
This prompted them to think about how to improve the method of capture on the 
prototype unit, and the editing of sounds and associations afterwards, so as to 
consolidate and expand these values in more creative ways. This positive experi-
ence resulted in the majority of participants wanting to record audiophotos again, 
and led some people to regret the absence of the audiocamera when it was 
withdrawn. 
2 Ambient Photographs

37
 Not all of these effects were due to the recording of pure ambient sounds tak-
ing place exactly as the photographs were taken. In fact a major ﬁ nding of the 
trial was that ambient sounds are made up of multiple components lying before, 
during or after the images to which they relate. In fact, the ambient audiophotos 
contained music, conversation and commentary as well as environmental 
sounds, and comprised sound and image  sequences that overlapped in different 
ways. 
 To the extent that these other sound types were recorded around the moment(s) 
of image capture, they remain part of the ambience of a scene or event and can still 
be distinguished from music or voiceover added later, and from the conversation 
about an image that occurs when it is shown to others. Nevertheless, the fact that 
these components occur or can be recorded as part of the ambient sound track adds 
to the complexity of its role in photography and to the expressiveness of the 
 audiophoto medium itself. To understand this role and expressiveness better, it is 
useful to relate the study ﬁ ndings to the personal and social contexts for interacting 
with photographs, as shown in Fig.   1.2 . 
2.6.1  The Role of Ambient Sound in Personal Image Review 
 Ambient sound was found to be beneﬁ cial for the personal  recall and  recollection 
of a scene or event by those involved in it. This conﬁ rms the expectation of people 
in our pilot study. Ambient sound has also been found to be useful for the  interpre-
tation of images by those not involved. 
 In the ﬁ rst case, participants told us directly that the recording and playback of 
ambient sounds with images improved their memory of the original event. In par-
ticular, natural sounds, ambient music and background conversation all served to 
capture more of the atmosphere of the time, and appeared to help people recover or 
remember their feelings of being there again. This was most clearly illustrated in the 
seascape audiophoto shown in Fig.  2.10 , where the simple sound of walking through 
shallow water helped to recreate the mood of an entire summer evening on holiday. 
Ambient sound undoubtedly provides more information about the scene that people 
may use to access their memory of it, but it is the  emotional aspect of the sound that 
they appear to recognise and value most. This partly explains why voiceover was 
seen as less valuable than natural sound by the participants themselves. Although 
voiceover adds information about where and when the photograph was taken, it 
does little to mentally transport the participant back there, compared to ambient 
sounds of the moment. 
 Thus, ambient sound appeared to enhance memory by helping participants to 
emotionally re-live the event, rather than by furnishing details of the event to recol-
lect cognitively. This effect is similar to that of  telepresence in remote communica-
tion, where some systems and media are more effective in creating an illusion of 
being in a remote location than others (Lombard and Ditton  1997 ). Through photog-
raphy, people can be transported to a previous time of their lives, and experience the

38
illusion of being back at a particular location and moment. I will call this illusion 
 retropresence to distinguish it from telepresence. Through audiophotography, the 
illusion of retropresence can be heightened by the use of ambient sounds, which 
literally surround you with the same auditory stimulation you experienced at the 
time. The same effect will be created by the ambient sound track of a video clip, 
although its literal depiction of movement through the moment may be less condu-
cive to an overall sense of retropresence at the moment of review. This is an issue 
for future research. 
 In the second case, the interpretation of an unfamiliar scene was assisted by the 
playback of sound or comments providing additional contextual information. This 
could be seen in the reactions of families to each other’s audiophotos, and in our 
own reactions to the trial materials as they arrived for editing and analysis. The 
images were easier to read with ambient sounds providing extra clues about the 
identity of people and objects in the scene, and comments providing a personal 
description of their signiﬁ cance. By deﬁ nition, these audiophotos revealed more of 
the story-of-the-photo (Berger  1982 ), either through the unfolding of sounds 
stretching beyond the moment of image capture, or directly through a voice com-
ment. This made them highly suitable for sending to others who weren’t there at 
the time, as observed by several participants in the trial. The same effects also 
enriched the depiction of people in the images. The inclusion of the voice of a 
subject was found to be particularly revealing of their character, as in Fig.  2.11 . 
This is not surprising with hindsight, since the essence of someone’s personality is 
likely to be conveyed at least as effectively by what they say or how they say it, as 
by what they look like.  
2.6.2  The Role of Ambient Sound in the Social Interaction 
 There were mixed effects of ambient sounds on the social interaction around images. 
As with personal review, these effects depended on  who was involved. 
 In reminiscing conversations amongst themselves, families were observed to 
laugh more and generally enjoy the experience more with sound than without it. 
The element of humour was a key value of ambient sound noted by participants 
themselves, but it manifested itself most in social interaction where families 
could share the jokes and tease one another about how they sounded or what 
they had said. 
 In contrast, storytelling conversations between families were less fun. Indeed, 
people complained that they had difﬁ culty talking over the background sounds and, 
in some cases, wanted to switch them off. People were trying to provide a live nar-
rative commentary on their audiophotos, outside the sounds and commentary 
recorded with the images. These appeared to compete with each other, at least in the 
case of recorded speech. Hence ambient sound appeared to restrict rather than 
enhance the process of sharing photos with those outside the capture group, because 
it drew attention away from what the author and audience wanted to say about the 
2 Ambient Photographs

39
image. The fact that the same sounds can be beneﬁ cial in one social setting and 
detrimental in another, is an important ﬁ nding for audiophotography, to which we 
will return in later chapters. 
 In short, we have found that families take readily to the practice of recording 
ambient sounds with photographs, and produce audiophoto effects they prefer to 
conventional home video. This kind of audio adds considerably to what Schaverian 
( 1991 ) calls the  life in the image , by ﬂ ooding the senses with some of the most dis-
tinctive sounds heard at the time of image capture. While music, commentary and 
conversation were all present in ambient sound to contribute to these effects, their 
contribution was usually secondary to that of environmental sound which was the 
most common type overall. In the next three chapters we consider each of these 
other kinds of sound in turn, as something added to the life of an image  after it is 
captured. This will deepen our understanding of other kinds of audiophotos, before 
going on to consider the effect of screen and paper formats on the playback 
experience.

 Musical Photographs 
 For me the voice captured the memory, the music captured the 
mood (John, audio annotation trial). 
             In a survey of 29 funeral homes in the south west of England it was found that 
people are choosing more popular music to be played at funeral services (The West 
Briton  2002 ). Traditional hymns are being replaced by classic songs such as Elton 
john’s  Candle in the wind and Simon and Garfunkel’s  Bridge over troubled waters , 
or by contemporary hits such as  Angels by Robbie Williams. At the top of the 
funeral charts calculated in the survey were pieces from Hollywood movies about 
bereavement and loss. Number one was Bette Midler’s  Wind beneath my wings 
from the ﬁ lm  Beaches while number two was Celine Dion’s theme from  Titanic , 
 My heart will go on . Outside the top ten were occasional choices for more light-
hearted music such as  I ’ m the king of the swingers  from  The Jungle Book ,  Party 
Atmosphere by Russ Abbot, and  Always look on the bright side of life from the 
Monty Python ﬁ lm  The life of Brian . The point of this story is that ordinary people 
are rather good at selecting music based on its personal meaning to them or to their 
close family, and using that music to create particular emotional and symbolic 
effects. Those familiar with any of the examples above will recognize symbolic 
connections with enduring love and the celebration of life in adversity, and these 
meanings will be ampliﬁ ed when there is some personal association between the 
music and the person who has died. Indeed the funeral directors interviewed about 
the survey results, stated that people are turning to popular music to  personalise the 
funeral service and make it relevant to their loved one who may not be familiar 
with church hymns and choruses. 
 This chapter explores whether people can do the same sort of thing with photo-
graphs. Perhaps music can be chosen to add personal meaning to a photograph and 
inﬂ uence the kind of effect it has on oneself or others. For example, music associ-
ated with the time or place the photograph was taken might serve to enhance the 
memory of the event. These possibilities are examined here by encouraging con-
sumers to annotate a small set of their own photographs with music from their own 
personal collections. However, before reporting the details of this study, we pause 
brieﬂ y to consider what is already known about this activity from previous studies 
or design practice.

3.1  Related Work 
 Very little academic research on music has considered its sentimental value and use. 
Research questions have centred more on how we perceive and remember pure 
musical phrases (psychoacoustics), and on how musical tastes and styles differ 
across cultures and time (musicology). For the best insights into the personal value 
of music, we need to turn again to popular culture. 
 An experiment in personal music selection has been carried out through an ongo-
ing BBC radio show called  Desert Island Discs . The show celebrates its 73rd anni-
versary this year (2015) and must surely be the longest music-psychology study in 
history. The format for the half hour show is to invite a celebrity guest to choose 
eight records they would take with them to a desert island. The guests are inter-
viewed about their lives in the context of the music selection, and always give a 
reason for each piece of music before it is played (in shortened form). Only four 
main interviewers have hosted the show over the years: Roy Plomley (1942–1985), 
Michael Parkinson (1986–1988), Sue Lawley (1988–2006) and Kirsty Young 
(2006- present day 2015). The very success of this format says something about the 
appeal of hearing about other people’s choice of music as well as hearing the music 
itself. It also reveals the suitability of music as a vehicle for talking about the past. 
 In commentaries on the show, Roy Plomley and Sue Lawley discuss patterns in 
the choice of music across shows (Lawley  1990 ; Plomley  1975 ,  1982 ). The top 10 
or 20 music choices appear to change over time, particularly as new popular music 
replaces old. Classical music selections are more stable and include well-known 
pieces such as Beethoven’s  Ode to Joy (Symphony No. 9, last movement) and 
 Pastoral Symphony (No. 6), Mozart’s  Clarinet Concerto (second movement, 
Adagio), Dvorak’s  New World Symphony  (largo), Elgar’s  Pomp & Circumstance 
(March No. 1), Brahm’s  Violin Concerto  (last movement) and Rachmaninov’s 
 Piano Concerto No. 2 (last movement). However, the reasons for choosing the very 
same piece of music can be quite different across people. Sometimes the music is 
chosen for its connection with the past and ability to conjure up a happy memory. 
At other times, the music is chosen primarily for entertainment or because of a pref-
erence for a particular composer or performer. In all cases the choices are  personal 
and idiosyncratic. They therefore reveal something about the personality of the 
guest that might otherwise have been difﬁ cult to elicit by direct interview alone. 
 These points can be illustrated by some music choices made by Brian May of the 
rock group Queen, speaking on the show during the week I was originally writing 
this chapter (broadcast on BBC Radio 4, Sunday 15th September 2002). His choices 
fell into three categories. Some tracks were chosen because of their aesthetic quali-
ties and ability to lift his mood. These included:
•  Since you ’ ve been gone , Rainbow – “This always gets me and lifts me” 
•  Highway to Hell , AC/DC – “This is pure rock. It clears you out and gets you back 
to basics”. 
•  We will rock you , Queen – “It brings people together and makes them feel strong 
and uplifted”.

 It turned out that Brian had been subject to depression in the past, and wanted to 
use music to avoid this on his desert island. 
 Other tracks were chosen because of their association with important people in 
his life. These included:
•  Maybe baby , Buddy Holly – “An early inspiration” 
•  To know him is to love him , Anita Dobson & Brian May – “My darling wife. I 
couldn’t be without her”. 
 Discussion of these two choices revealed a secret love of  pop music in a quiet 
and conservative home setting, and the break up of a ﬁ rst marriage. 
 Finally, three tracks were chosen because of their nostalgic value. Each one 
reminded Brian of a different time in his life:
•  Saturn - Bringer of old age , Planets Suite by Holst – “I wrote a monolog when I 
was a kid and used to perform to this” 
•  Back on my feet again , The Babies – “My driver used to play this as a pick-me-up 
on the car radio on the way back to the hotel after an all-night drinking 
session”. 
•  Tracks of my tears , Smokey Robinson and the Miracles – “This took me all 
through my college days after a break-up with my girlfriend”  
 The meaning of each piece is indicated by its associated quote, and reveals some-
thing about Brian’s past attitudes and behaviour. The Planets Suite movement 
relates to his love of astronomy, which he developed as a child and later studied at 
university. The monolog he wrote was about the night sky in winter. The Babys 
track refers to a period of excessive partying on tour with the band, while the 
Smokey Robinson track relates to his time at university. He played  Tracks of my 
tears when getting over an important relationship with a girlfriend, and pretending 
to be OK when he was not. The lyrics of the chorus articulate this feeling exactly, 
and expressed for him something he couldn’t put into words himself. This also 
prompted him to talk about his reason for wanting to write songs, as a way of con-
necting to people ‘Heart to heart’. 
 Chorus:
 Take a good look at my face 
 You’ll see my smile looks out of place 
 If you look close its easy to trace 
 The tracks of my tears 
 These examples suggest that music has a variety of meanings and associations in 
one’s life, and can be used privately to trigger memories and alter moods. 
Furthermore, the  discussion  of these meanings and associations seems to be reveal-
ing of personality. All this is relevant to the photographic context in which images 
serve a similar function. In this context it is interesting to reﬂ ect on what the associ-
ated images might be for Brian May’s music selection. While the people selections 
could be linked to standard photographs of the performers, such as you might ﬁ nd 
on a CD cover, the nostalgic selections could not. It would be more meaningful to 
3.1 Related Work

combine the  Saturn music with a photograph of Brian as a child, or of the night sky, 
than with a picture of an orchestra performing the Planets Suite. Similarly a photo-
graph of his driver or car would be best with  Back on my feet again , while a photo 
of his long lost girlfriend or his smiling face at that time might be appropriate to 
 Tracks of my tears . 
 Unfortunately, the format of this radio show does not support such speculation, 
and there is little scientiﬁ c work on the connection between music and images. In a 
recent conference on  Musical Imagery , the ability of people to hear and sing tunes 
in their heads was discussed and studied, as was the ability to read music or other 
visual symbols and hear inner sounds (Godoy and Jorgensen  2001 ). However, the 
ability to hear actual sounds and mentally picture a scene was not discussed in any 
detail, nor was the ability to look at an image and imagine the sounds or music that 
go with it (although see Mountain  2001 for an exception). 
 That people can do both these things is indicated by some of the ﬁ ndings in 
Chap.   2  of this book and by a book on music in modern art (Maur  1999 ). Hence, 
Maur ( 1999 ) shows that a number of famous painters and musicians were heavily 
inﬂ uenced by each others work, taking inspiration from one medium and translating 
it into the other. For example, Kandinsky was inspired by Schoenberg’s use of dis-
sonant sounds to develop a more abstract form of cubist painting than had been done 
before. Furthermore, in Chap.   2 of this book, we saw that ambient sounds could 
either trigger a visual memory of an event or be recalled from a photograph of the 
event. The history of the cinema also attests to the ability of musicians to set music 
to silent ﬁ lms. In fact many cinema pianists and organists of the time could impro-
vise music which watching the ﬁ lm live. This is exactly the kind of thing that is done 
today over a longer timescale by ﬁ lm  music composers . As this is such a relevant 
activity to the selection of music for still images, we will consider the ﬁ lm compos-
ers’ skill as a ﬁ nal backdrop to our study. 
 Composers in general talk a lot about ﬁ nding inspiration outside music for their 
compositions (Mountain  2001 ). They draw on analogies with human emotions, his-
torical characters and stories, animals and landscapes. For ﬁ lm  music composers , 
these analogies are given visual form and pace through ﬁ lm footage. Note also that 
this footage is generated in relation to a screenplay and accompanied by ambient 
sounds and dialogue telling the story of the ﬁ lm. The process of producing such 
material takes time, and can be more or less integrated with the creation of the 
music. Hence we ﬁ nd that a perennial concern of ﬁ lm music composers is which 
comes ﬁ rst; the image or the music? This issue is discussed in a series of interviews 
with famous ﬁ lm composers, talking about their work (Russell and Young  2000 ). 
While it is more usual for a composer to be shown rough-cut footage as a stimulus 
for the music, some directors are open to discussion with the composer about the 
intention of a scene before it is shot or edited. For example, Elmer Bernstein was 
able to create a ‘temp’ score for Martin Scorsese, before editing  The age of 
innocence :
 Scorsese is one of those directors who will talk through the sequences and the way he would 
like the music. He said that listening to music is what made him want to become a director. 
For him the image and the music are inseparable. He ﬁ nds it very difﬁ cult to edit a ﬁ lm cold , 
3 Musical Photographs

45
 so he will tend to bring in the music as he ’ s editing the ﬁ lm. In the case of The age of inno-
cence ,  I wrote some themes for him which he liked and I then suggested we make a temp 
score based on these themes ,  so he was always working with what became the ﬁ nal score 
( Bernsein quoted in Russell and Young  2000 , p. 43). 
 Nevertheless, one of the key skills developed by ﬁ lm composers is to look a 
sequence of images and imagine the kind of music that goes with it. For some ﬁ lm 
composers this can be an immediate experience:
 Whenever I see a ﬁ lm ,  a good ﬁ lm ,  I feel the orchestration right away ( Maurice Jarre 
quoted in Russell and Young  2000 , p. 55). 
 The intention of the music is usually to deﬁ ne and accentuate the  mood of the 
scene or characters, and to assist the  narrative ﬂ ow of the ﬁ lm in telling the story. 
Individual characters may have separate themes associated with them, which com-
municate their own emotions to the audience. At other times, the music may cut 
against the (primary) emotions of the characters in the ﬁ lm, to communicate another 
(secondary) emotion to the audience – as in the warning of an unforeseen danger. 
These techniques have been shown to be effective both in inﬂ uencing the emotional 
experience of the audience and their understanding and recollection of the ﬁ lm (e.g. 
Boltz  2001 ; Thayer and Levinson  1983 ). Finally, the music is only one of the sound 
elements in a modern ﬁ lm and must be combined with ambient sound, dialogue and 
voiceover. The control and balancing of these various elements is the job of the 
 sound designer who must understand each contribution and ﬁ t them together in time 
to the visual events (Sonnenschein  2001 ). 
 Whether or not these kind of skills can be applied by ordinary people to domestic 
photographs remains to be seen in the rest of this chapter and book. However, we 
now know from this review that such skills can be acquired, and might be combined 
with already well-developed abilities to select music for personal and social effect. 
So let us put this to the test.  
3.2  The Audio Annotation Trial 
 Using a methodology similar to the audiocamera trial in Chap.   2 , we gave a small 
number of families the opportunity to annotate their photographs with music and 
voiceover recordings. The study was carried out with Adam Drazin and Tony 
Clancy, and was designed to provide insights on both musical and talking photo-
graphs. This chapter reports the ﬁ ndings on music annotation while Chap.   4 reports 
the ﬁ ndings on voice annotation. 
 The main difference between this study and the audio-camera trial is that partici-
pants were not given a technology prototype for an unsupervised trial period. 
Current methods of annotating photographs with digital music or sound recordings 
were considered too complex to use by untrained consumers or too simple to accom-
modate their requirements. Indeed, one aim of the study was to generate user 
requirements for such a system. Instead, we visited families at home to supervise 
3.2 The Audio Annotation Trial

46
their  choice of music and photo combinations that we later digitized and assembled 
into audiophoto albums. We also took in audio equipment to record voiceover nar-
rations for other photo content that we again digitised and assembled later. This 
exercise comprised a pseudo-trial period, after which there was a return visit by 
families to the Labs. At this feedback session, families reviewed and discussed elec-
tronic versions of the albums they had designed, in a variety of forms. 
3.2.1  Participants 
 This approach was followed with eight households in the Bristol area. The house-
holds were all PC-owning families in which one member had a special interest in 
photography or music. This interest was measured through attendance at a photog-
raphy, album making or music club. 
 These criteria were used to ensure some level of technological sophistication, 
together with a propensity to beneﬁ t from either voice or music annotation of pho-
tos. For example, people involved in photography and album making might be will-
ing to consider using voice annotation with photographs. Alternatively, those with 
an interest in music might consider playing music from photographs as well as from 
vinyl records or CDs. We also hoped to assess the general appeal of these activities, 
by involving other members of the household, and looking at the reactions of photo 
enthusiasts to music and music enthusiasts to voiceover. 
3.2.2  Home Visits 
 Each of the eight households generated one musical and one talking photo album in 
the home visit, apart from one couple who generated a pair each on separate visits. 
There was usually one main contact and interviewee from each household, with 
partners or other family members present at about four of the visits. The ﬁ rst part of 
the home visit involved a general discussion about photo and music use in the home. 
This was designed to explore photo album making behaviours and the role of music 
in remembering the past. The concept of audio annotation of photos was introduced 
in the second part of the home visit for comment. Participants were then asked to 
select a set of photos to annotate with music, and a set to annotate with voice. We 
left this choice open as far as possible, to allow people to direct the activity towards 
photo content they felt might beneﬁ t from audio annotation. For practical purposes 
we asked people to limit the size of each set to about 10 photographs. 
 Once the photographs for music annotation were selected, participants began to 
work through the set with reference to their own music collection available in the 
house. Sometimes a piece of music came to mind immediately as they looked at a 
particular photo or group of photos. In these cases, they would search directly for

that piece to hand over to us later. At other times, participants would be less sure of 
the particular piece they wanted, but usually had in mind the mood and sentiment it 
should express. In these cases, they would browse parts of their collection looking 
for inspiration or ask us for advice. When answering these questions we encouraged 
them to make their own selection. Each choice was documented on a simple two- 
column form on which we wrote photo names in the ﬁ rst column and music track 
names in the second. The discussion of music choices was also recorded to capture 
the participants’ reasons for particular selections. A different procedure was used 
for voice annotation, and is described in Chap.   4 . 
3.2.3  Album Creation 
 At the end of each home visit we took away the music and voice album speciﬁ ca-
tion forms, and borrowed all the music and photo materials relating to them. Music 
samples and voiceover materials were digitized by recording them into a sound 
editing application on a PC. Photographs were scanned into an image editing 
application. The composite sound and image ﬁ les were then assembled into audio-
photo albums on the PC, using Macromedia Director. This is a professional multi-
media authoring system that had sufﬁ cient ﬂ exibility to support the variety of 
sound and image combinations chosen by participants in the trial. It is worth not-
ing here that simpler, photo album software of the day provided either no support 
for audiophotos, or only poor support in the form of one sound per album or one 
sound per image. 
 This procedure raised a number of music copyright issues. Music copying within 
the European Union is allowed for personal use, and could be supported in musical 
photo editing software. However, the distribution of musical photographs to other 
people begins to infringe copyright law by denying revenue to artists from recipi-
ents. This would inhibit the development of photoware for musical photographs. 
The study procedure itself was legal in the sense of facilitating the composition of 
personal musical photographs for live sharing and discussion. However, it left par-
ticipants with a dilemma about how to share their new music-photo albums after the 
study, and me with the job of requesting music licences for all the music in this 
chapter. This is an important issue to which I will return later. 
 The composition process resulted in the creation of 9 musical and 9 talking photo 
albums containing about 10 photographs each. In addition to these personal albums, 
we made up a demonstration set comprised of one musical and one talking audio-
photo from each album. This set was used to create screen and paper-based demon-
strations, showing a variety of non-PC formats for the same material. These included 
presentations on a TV, a palmtop PC, a tablet PC, and in the form of an audio 
enabled print, card and physical photo album. These are described in further detail 
in Chap.   6 , which deals with the ﬁ ndings of this comparison. 
3.2 The Audio Annotation Trial

48
3.2.4  Feedback Groups 
 Three separate feedback groups were then held for two or three families at a time in HP 
Labs Bristol. Each group session started with pairs of participants reviewing their own 
album material together. Pairs sat up to a ﬂ at panel display with active stereo speakers 
on a café table, and clicked through their PC-based albums using only a mouse. A 
laptop computer driving this experience was placed out of sight beneath the table. The 
interface to each album was kept simple and uniform, as shown in Fig.  3.1 .
 Most album pages showed one photo at a time at nearly full screen size, above a 
set of multimedia control buttons displayed at the bottom of the screen. Forward and 
back buttons had to be clicked to advance or reverse the display of pages, and audio 
tracks played automatically on presentation of their corresponding page. Sound 
could be muted using the mute button, but not paused. Where one audio track was 
speciﬁ ed to play over several photographs, it simply played continuously while any 
of those photographs were displayed. In a few cases where participants had speciﬁ -
cally requested it, multiple photographs were displayed on the same page to one or 
more audio tracks. After reviewing each other’s albums, pairs were asked to select 
their favourite musical and talking photographs from each album. They wrote down 
their selections with corresponding reasons on a form. 
 The initial sharing period was followed by a group discussion of the uses and 
values of music and voiceover with photographs. This was an opportunity for 
 Fig. 3.1   Screenshot of a PC-based musical photo album 
 
3 Musical Photographs

49
 participants to reﬂ ect on the experience of creating and reviewing their personal 
albums, and comment on the problems and beneﬁ ts involved. Groups were then 
shown a demonstration set of audiophotos in a series of alternative screen and paper 
formats. At the end of this demonstration each participant expressed their prefer-
ences for musical and talking photo formats on a form, before discussing their 
answers. 
 Findings on the  format discussions for music and voiceover are described in 
Chap.   6 , along with a similar comparison made for ambient audiophotos in the 
audio-camera trial. Findings on the  content selections and discussions are described 
separately for music and voiceover in this chapter and the next. The analysis in these 
chapters follows that used in Chap.   2  for ambient sound, where technical features of 
the audiophoto corpus are described ahead of the users’ perspectives on the mate-
rial. In fact, the analysis section headings are kept the same to enable easier com-
parison between chapters on each of these three major audiophoto types. 
Conversational audiophotos are treated somewhat differently in Chap.   5  where con-
versation is explored as another method of eliciting voiceover  narration . 
3.3  Musical Photos Captured 
 A total of 48 music clips were combined with 94 photographs to make up nine 
music-photo albums. The range of musical and photographic material used was 
extensive, and people approached the task of selection in a number of different 
ways. For example, some participants chose a recent collection of photos and set 
each one to a separate piece of contemporary music. Others chose an older photo 
collection and set it to a single piece of nostalgic music. Some people even selected 
ten of their favourite photographs and ten of their favourite pieces of music and 
tried to match them with each other. This made for a very interesting set of audio-
photos, albums and discussions, as participants began to explore the possibilities of 
the new medium and ﬁ nd its value. 
3.3.1  Types 
 The different types of music selected are shown in Fig.  3.2 . This chart was gener-
ated by classifying each music clip as belonging to one or other of a standard set of 
a music categories used by music shops. It shows that  classical music was the most 
commonly selected type of music for this group, but that a wide range of other types 
were also used.
   Three typical example combinations of music and photos are shown in 
Figs.  3.3 ,  3.4 , and  3.5 . The photographic components consist of a landscape shot, 
a group photo and an individual head-and shoulders portrait. These are combined 
respectively with a piece of  classical music, a modern  dance track and an old-

Figure  3.3 conveys the mood of a rolling sea that occasionally crashes on the

reaches a series of crescendos. Figure  3.4 communicates the energy and fun of a

return to each of these examples later, but for now it is sufﬁ cient to note the vari-
ety of content used in the study and the powerful effect of the music in modifying 
and accentuating the perception of each photograph.

3.3.2  Durations 
 The duration of audio clips used for music was understandably greater than the 
duration of audio clips used for ambient sound. The average duration of a music clip 
was about 3 min (182 s) compared to 24 s for an ambient clip. However, the spread 
of durations was similar as shown in Fig.  3.6 . Ninety ﬁ ve percent of the clips varied 
from about 1–5 min. This variation is partly due to inherent differences in the length 
of published music tracks, especially those including short  dance or  jazz numbers 
and longer  classical movements. In addition, this distribution was skewed towards 
the lower durations, by people who expressed a preference for speciﬁ c parts of a 
track to be combined with their photos.
 The request for parts of a track to be associated with a photograph was espe-
cially important in the case of long  classical pieces or songs with extensive lyr-
ics. This is because the mood and meaning of these kinds of tracks can change 
dramatically within the track. For example, the symphony represented in Fig.  3.3 
starts off quietly and builds to a loud ﬁ nale in 7 distinct cycles over 6 min. By 
including all these cycles in this audiophoto the music echoes the repetitive 
movement of the sea depicted in the photograph. Selecting the quieter or louder 
part of each cycle would have emphasised the calmer or more dramatic aspect of 
the sea respectively. 
 A further consideration is that each piece of music may not be played back in 
its entirety. This can be seen from the section on music-photo review below, 
which shows that participants often skipped onto the next audiophoto after just a 
few seconds of conversation about it. This means that the most important  work of 
each track, in triggering a memory or conveying a mood, is done in the opening 
sequence.

3.3.3  Associations 
 None of the photos selected in the study were combined with more than one music 
clip. This contrasts with the ambient sound photos in Chap.   2 where a small subset 
were combined with several sound clips (see again Fig.   2.6 ). Instead, the photos in 
this study were combined with a single music clip, as shown in Fig.  3.7 . In two 
thirds of cases there was a one-to-one association of sound to image. In the other 
third of cases, there was a one-to-many association, meaning that a single piece of 
music was combined with two or more photographs.
 The ocean scene and group photo shown in Figs.  3.3 and  3.4 were both associ-
ated with a single music track. However, the portrait shown in Fig.  3.5 goes with an 
additional full length photo of the same woman. Both were associated with the same 
Matt Munro song. Usually a pair of photos like this depict the same scene or subject 
from different angles, in landscape and portrait mode, or at consecutive points in 
time. Other examples of  musical pairs  of photos in the study were a pair of animals 
taken on the same trip, a pair of buildings found near to each other, and different 
parts of the same waterfall. 
 Some associations of sound and images involved more than two photos. These 
tended to be sequences of images relating to the same episode in time or even to an 
entire photo album. For example, Fig.  3.8 shows four photos taken on a trip to 
Japan, combined with a single song by a Welsh male-voice choir.
 The fact that music was often used to link pairs, groups or albums of photographs 
together in this way is reminiscent of the use of ﬁ lm music to achieve continuity 
between shots or scenes in a movie. Conversely the combination of music tracks 
with individual photographs serves to set them apart from each other, even when 
they belong to the same set or episode. We turn now to the participants’ own reason-
ing about these choices, and their reactions to the resulting material. This will show 
how conscious they were of using particular techniques, and what value they per-
ceived them to have.

3.4  Reactions 
3.4.1  Initial Reactions 
 Most people were extremely skeptical of the value of combining music with photo-
graphs at the beginning of the study. As the quotes below indicate, they tended not 
to associate the two media in their minds and struggled to imagine what the combi-
nation would feel like. Consequently, the music annotation exercise was performed 
under sufferance, primarily to please us.
 I wouldn ’ t naturally put them together. I ’ m not convinced ( Rob ) 
 I don ’ t know. I ’ ve been trying to think about it after we talked the last time. I ’ m looking 
forward to seeing it because at the moment I can ’ t ( Traci ) 
 I can ’ t picture it in terms of what we are doing at the moment ( Byron ) 
 I don ’ t tie up photographs with music speciﬁ cally. I don ’ t like concerts on television 
( Gordon ) 
 Only two participants spoke favourably about the possible beneﬁ ts of combining 
music and photos. One of the older men in the study drew a comparison with ﬁ lm

music, while the youngest man of the study immediately saw it as another way of 
organising and playing his music by its date of release:
 If one sees a ﬁ lm with the soundtrack off ,  however emotional it is ,  one can watch it fairly 
dispassionately. But you put the music on with that ﬁ lm and watch it and however stoic you 
may be ,  you ’ ll ﬁ nd tears coming into the corner of your eyes or get other emotions. So 
certainly music can have a terriﬁ c effect in that respect and if you could ﬁ nd the right music 
to go with the photos I could well imagine that it would be more nostalgic ,  much more 
evocative ( John ). 
 It sounds good yes ,  so I ’ d choose a song for each photo would I ?  If you ’ ve got a photo 
during the time you were into that sort of music ,  like at school or something ,  that might 
work ( Nick ). 
 After reviewing their own music photo albums on the PC for the ﬁ rst time, we 
asked participants what they thought of them. Most people were pleasantly sur-
prised and a few were positively shocked at how much they liked them. The major-
ity of comments were positive, and mentioned the power of music in capturing a 
mood or atmosphere for the photos. This can be seen in the opening quote for this 
chapter, and in the comments below:
 I liked the music ones ( Traci ) 
 I thought they worked surprisingly well ( Byron ) 
 I thought it was really good actually. I think putting pictures and music together does 
actually work ( Nick ) 
 I think music does give the atmosphere ( Gordon ) 
 The most dramatic conversion was experienced by Rachel. Rachel was quite 
outspoken at the beginning of the trial about the lack of appeal of combining music 
with photos and the difﬁ culty of associating them in her mind:
 It doesn ’ t appeal to me personally really. I don ’ t necessarily ﬁ nd the photos that I take are 
evocative of a certain musical experience. Although some pictures do evoke some kind of 
music or sounds I wouldn ’ t necessarily want to sit here and have it played at me. Pictures 
are good enough in their own right ( Rachel ) 
 However, for her album, Rachel chose two family photographs and a series of 4 
landscapes. The landscapes were set to  classical or  choral music that appeared to 
match the images perfectly. One of these musical landscapes is shown in Fig.  3.9 . 
The combined effect of listening to these photographs was to change her mind 
completely:
 I was impressed. I came thinking I wasn ’ t going to be. The whole concept was quite moving 
really ( Rachel ) 
 As experimenters, we also experienced something of the same conversion effect. 
Despite anticipating the potential value of music, rather like John quoted above, and 
being familiar with ambient sounds and commentary on photographs, nothing pre-
pared us for the range of emotions triggered by some of the families’ material. We 
found John’s portrait of his wife Betty shown in Fig.  3.6 to be particularly touching, 
and were amazed at how well Rachel and others were able to match the mood of an 
image with appropriate music.

3.4.2  Favourites 
 After reviewing each other’s music-photo material in pairs, participants were asked 
to choose a favourite from each set. They were also asked to write down the reasons 
for their selections. In this section we concentrate on the selection of personal 
favourites from people’s own music-photos, and contrast this brieﬂ y at the end of 
the section with their selections from other people’s material. 
 Preferences were based purely on aspects of the content, rather than on the type 
of music, the duration of the clip or the type of sound-to-image association. Two 
distinct qualities were mentioned as reasons for preferring particular music photos 
over others. The ﬁ rst was the goodness of ﬁ t between the image and the music. 
Wherever the music appeared to capture and amplify the mood of the photograph it 
was liked. For example, Rachel liked all her music-photos but singled out that in 
Fig.  3.9 as her favourite. Her reason was that:
 The music and images work together so well. The Rutter music perfectly reﬂ ects the mood 
of the photos ( Rachel ) 
 A similar reason was given by Byron who chose the Japanese photos and Welsh 
music shown in Fig.  3.8 as his favourite. He singled out the ﬁ rst image of a wooden 
walkway as working particularly well with the music:
 Because the music seems to ﬁ t the tranquil mood of the garden ,  despite the Japanese / Welsh 
mix ( Byron )

3 Musical Photographs

57
 The second quality that appeared to distinguish favourite music photos was the 
personal signiﬁ cance of the image or music. The more signiﬁ cant the music or 
photo, the more it was liked as a combination. For example, the group photo shown 
in Fig.  3.4 was Nick’s favourite because:
 Its one of my favourite photos anyway and I thought the music went very well with it ( Nick ) 
 In another example, one participant chose a favourite music photo because of the 
signiﬁ cance of the music. It was a Christian rock song called  Surrender and was 
combined with multiple photographs from a holiday in Italy. The lyrics of the song 
were important to him because they described his recommitment to God following 
a recovery from cancer. 
 In contrasting the choice of favourites from within one’s own or another person’s 
music-photo set, we found little consistency of selection. In other words, the same 
music-photos tended not to be chosen by both members of a pair of participants. 
Instead, the choice of favourites was highly idiosyncratic. This is understandable in 
terms of the personal signiﬁ cance of the material, since everyone had his or her own 
reasons for judging it to be signiﬁ cant to them. For example, Nick’s girlfriend Kerry 
chose a different favourite from Nick’s music-photo album than the favourite Nick 
chose for himself. Nick chose the shot of his friends shown in Fig.  3.4 while Keri 
chose the shot of Nick shown in Fig.  3.10 below. She considered the latter to be a 
good  audio-portrait , much like the favourite ambient-photo shown in Fig.   2.11 , and 
felt it captured Nick’s personality and love of music well:

 It ’ s very real ,  even though this was taken over three years ago ,  you will still ﬁ nd him doing 
this now -  everyday ! ( Kerry ) 
 However, we expected more consistency in the judgement of ﬁ t between a photo 
and a music track. As we discussed this with people later in the feedback groups we 
found that this too was highly subjective. It depends on the mood they read into the 
image, which is coloured by their experience of being there in the case of one’s own 
photographs. This might be quite different to what is read into another person’s 
photograph from the image alone. For example, the connection between the music 
and image in Fig.  3.11 is somewhat obscur, but was chosen as the authors’ favourite 
music-photo. To Harry who took the photo, the music went with the mood of East 
Berlin when he visited it before the fall of the Berlin wall. The multi-lingual cabaret 
song is both aggressive and inviting, much like the sign and the gateway in the pho-
tograph, although these allusions might be difﬁ cult to appreciate for someone who 
never experienced the city at this time.
3.4.3  The Value of Music 
 After selecting their favourite music-photos, participants were asked what they 
liked about adding music to photographs and what they would use it for. Taken 
together, these responses suggested four key values of music perceived by families 
in the study.

3 Musical Photographs

59
 First, adding music was seen as a way of re-creating and reinforcing the mood of 
the scene, as experienced at the time of capture. The music for the ocean view and 
the group of friends in Figs.  3.3 and  3.4 appears to have been selected for this effect, 
as well as the  choral music for the images of Japan and Skye in Figs.  3.8 and  3.9 . It 
provides a similar value to that of ambient sound in adding atmosphere and bringing 
the photo to life, although in a more controlled and personal way. This is because 
music can be selected to be more representative of the  feelings of the moment rather 
than of the literal  atmosphere of the moment, as given by ambient sound. Hence 
there was a sense for many people that they were often selecting the music for them-
selves, and that the choice of music was personal and not necessarily to be shared 
or understood by others:
 Well I chose my music for something I liked ,  something I enjoyed listening to ,  but also 
something that would be sort of upbeat and positive and in general reﬂ ect the mood of the 
photos or the place of the photos ( Vicky ) 
 The music would be evocative of your own feelings at the time and it would be your 
personal choice. When I go home and show this to my husband he wouldn ’ t necessarily ﬁ t 
those particular pieces of music with this picture ( Rachel ) 
 To me its just a personal souvenir that ’ s been enhanced by the music ,  and as such it 
wouldn ’ t be something that was a showpiece to be put in a museum or an art gallery. It ’ s 
something which is personal and helps to improve it ;  to make it real ( John ) 
 As with the use of ambient sound reported in Chap.   2 , there was some attempt to 
subvert the atmospheric value of music, to create effects that deliberately conﬂ icted 
with the mood of the photograph. This led to a second value of music in creating a 
new mood for the photo, designed more for amusement or entertainment value than 
for capturing a past mood. Harry’s Brandenberg Gate audiophoto shown in Fig.  3.11 
has something of this value, although the contrasting effect of sound and image may 
also be true to Harry’s perception of Berlin at the time. In another example, a pair 
of mopeds in Italy were set to a piece of opera by Verdi. This was done by Gordon 
as a deliberate  joke , to undermine the seriousness of Verdi’s music with a modern 
image, taken near to the place in which the music was ﬁ rst performed. A more 
straightforward use of music for entertainment, was also discussed by Vicky as a 
way of making the photo album as interesting as possible for others:
 Music sort of adds to the dull part. If you are not really into photo albums you can just sit 
back and go with the music ( Vicky ) 
 A third value of music was to evoke memories by association with nostalgic 
music of the time the photo was taken. Music associated with a particular holiday or 
person was said to have this kind of value, and would remind people of a whole col-
lection of events around a time period. A good example of this is shown in Fig.  3.12 .
 Figure  3.12 is a picture of Traci’s daughter taken on a trip to Bristol zoo, but set 
to a song from her favourite video of the time (‘Veggie Tales’). This combination 
not only makes for a good  audio-portrait of the daughter, it also reminds the mother 
of a period of home life which was punctuated by this music several times a week. 
Music listened to repeatedly at home, on car journeys and on the radio was also 
mentioned as having this nostalgic value. 
3.4 Reactions

60
 Finally, a fourth value of music was to communicate some hidden message 
through the music itself. This use of music was surprisingly common in the 
 music- photo collection, and second only to the selection of music to match a mood 
of the moment. In some ways it is the complete opposite of this latter value, since 
here the music is designed for someone else rather than for oneself. However, the 
effects may be just as subtle and poetic. 
 This can be seen from a series of what can only be described as ‘love photos’ 
comprising a picture of the loved one together with a song with romantic lyrics. 
Figure  3.5 is a good example of this, created by a husband for his wife. A more 
contemporary example is shown in Fig.  3.13 and was created by Nick for his girl-
friend. It is a picture of his girlfriend set to the track Wonderwall by Oasis and 
contains lyrics that might have been difﬁ cult to speak to her directly. Other love 
photos were created by the wives in the study for their husbands, including a picture 
of Rachel and her husband set to Alison Moyet’s  Is this love ?, and one of Jane and 
Byron set to  Wind beneath my wings by Bette Midler. We also found that parents 
sometimes used love songs with images of their children, as with a pair of photos of 
Jane and Byron’s daughter set to  Your song by Elton John.
 In all these cases, the lyrics of the songs took on extra signiﬁ cance when paired 
with the photographs, and appeared to speak about the people in the photos. Outside 
this class of romantic music-photos, we found the same use of music to communi-
cate more subtle meanings. For example, Dvorak’s  New World Symphony was cho-
sen with the ocean image in Fig.  3.3 not only for its mood, but also for its connection 
to the New World:
 So I think that goes with that because it is the New World. It ’ s California. Its all the things 
that go with the States ( Jane )

3.5  Practice 
 Although participants in the study did not have chance to make their own music- 
photo albums, the acts of specifying content, reviewing it together and discussing it 
later gave rise to a number of comments about the album creation process. In this 
section we examine these comments in the context of what people told us about 
their existing music and photo practices, to understand how music and photographs 
might be used together in the future. 
3.5.1  Capture 
 The most obvious way to create music-photos is to annotate existing photographs 
with music. Indeed this was the method promoted in our study. However, it was 
mentioned above that a number of participants approached the task of combining 
music and photographs somewhat differently. In particular, some of the music 
enthusiasts in the trial pulled out favourite pieces of music to combine with favou-
rite photos. This shows that it is possible to approach the combination of music and 
photographs in two ways, either by adding music to photographs or by adding pho-
tographs to music. Both views are represented in the following two quotes. These 
indicate the spread of opinion on whether photographs or music should be the

primary medium. Eventually, these views could lead people to capture photographs 
or music differently, in order to improve the match with the complementary medium
 As Byron and I have both said ,  if we ’ d had more time we ’ d have picked something more 
appropriate. But its deﬁ nitely the photograph itself which is the centre point. It ’ s not the 
talking or the music –  those are purely supplementary ( Jane ) 
 This is what I was getting at before. Sometimes you ’ ve got to approach it from one side , 
 sometimes the other. If you ’ ve got a deﬁ nite visual image in your mind then you may decide 
to ﬁ t music to it. If you ’ ve got a deﬁ nite musical image ,  say the 20 ’ s or something like that , 
 then you might ﬁ nd a photograph of the Charleston going on ,  to ﬁ t with the music. It 
depends which point you are making ( Gordon ) 
 The majority view was that photographs were the primary medium, as expressed 
in Jane’s quote above. In this context, three scenarios for adding music emerged 
from the discussions. Most participants in the trial captured many more photographs 
than they ever got around to putting in albums. The best of these were quickly 
reprinted and distributed to close family and friends, or slowly archived in a chrono-
logical album. In addition, the photo enthusiasts in the trial, tended to draw on their 
best photos to make themed albums or scrapbooks based around speciﬁ c trips or 
events. Some of these were given away as personal gifts. Each of these photographic 
creations might beneﬁ t from music, which could itself be added at the time of cre-
ation. Hence, music could be attached to a reprint at the point of sending it to a 
friend. Alternatively, music could be selected for attachment to an album or scrap-
book at the point of its physical assembly. The challenge here would be to support 
music selection and capture in a way that does not add too much time to the album- 
making activity, and in a format that can be integrated with the selected photo-
graphs. Another approach would be to turn the album-making activity into a social 
event, so that people could enjoy spending time together selecting and playing 
music for their photographs. This idea was suggested by Rob in the study, who was 
aware of the way his wife hosted album-making events:
 I know one of the things which works well in what Traci does ,  is that most of the people that 
want to make albums just don ’ t have the time. So once a month they all get together and 
glue together. So it ’ s sort of a social thing. You ’ ve got ten people round the table with all the 
tools. I don ’ t know how possible that would be to have ten people working on this at the 
same time ( Rob ) 
 Finally, people said very little about the practicalities of music selection and 
digitisation in the trial. Selection was  felt to be difﬁ cult, although people managed 
rather well to locate suitable music tracks from within their own music collections. 
This activity sometimes involved a search for a particular track within an identiﬁ ed 
genre or album, and might have beneﬁ ted from computer assistance. Digitisation 
was not mentioned because the trial methodology did not require participants to 
digitise their own music. This is currently being made easier for consumers by digi-
tal media players which can copy music from an audio CD for personal use. 
Digitisation from records or cassette tapes is not so easy and involves connecting a 
record deck or tape player to a computer for copying. Such difﬁ culties may decrease 
in the future if personal music collections become centralised in a digital ﬁ le-store, 
and connected to commercial music services on the World Wide  Web .

3.5.2  Editing 
 Participants seemed pleased with their music-photo albums for the most part, and 
expressed few desires to change them. The main comments made about editing related 
to cropping the music clip to focus on the most important part of a track for the desired 
effect. Many of the  classical pieces were considered to be far too long on playback, 
and even some of the more contemporary songs had long introductions that could 
have been cut out. For example, Nick expressed a desire to cut straight to the chorus 
of one track while Jane noted that they never reached the opening lyrics of another. 
 We also found that the one-at-a-time presentation of photographs used in most of 
the albums was annoying to the photo album enthusiasts who were used to arrang-
ing multiple prints on a page. In fact Traci and Vicky both requested a small number 
of multi-photo screen pages for their own audiophoto albums. They might have 
increased this number if they had been able to manipulate the layout themselves and 
view the effects. 
3.5.3  Review 
 At the beginning of each Feedback group participants were given the chance to view 
their music-photo and talking-photo albums together. This was usually done 
between pairs of people who knew each other, although Rachel and Rob were 
exceptions to this since they had never met before the study. We also had Jane, 
Byron, Nick and Kerri share two sets of albums together in a foursome. For any pair 
or group, the photographs were usually of events not shared by the other parties. 
However, Jane and Byron and John and Betty created joint albums of photos whose 
memories they both shared. This meant that we were able to record a rich set of 
interactions around the material, representing all the possible sharing combinations 
shown in the diamond framework in Fig.   1.2 . 
 By examining these interactions and participants comments about them after-
wards we quickly discovered that the review of photographs with music was very 
different to the review of photographs with voiceover. The main difference was in 
the ability to talk over music but not voiceover:
 We didn ’ t talk over the voices ,  we just talked over the music ( Jane ) 
 Indeed, not only was it possible for participants to talk over the music-photos, the 
music seemed to positively encourage this. As in the lively reminiscing conversa-
tions observed with ambient sound photos, we found that the review of music- photos 
was animated and noisy. The musical atmosphere appeared to break the ice between 
those who didn’t know each other so well, and generally improve the ambience of 
the occasion. This was true for reminiscing conversations  and storytelling ones. In 
contrast, voice-photo review sessions were very quiet and subdued, as all parties 
paused to listen through to the recorded comments (see Chap.   4 for further details). 
3.5 Practice

64
 The style of music-photo review was as follows. We noticed that the owners of 
each album tended to take control of the mouse and decide when to turn each page. 
In reminiscing conversations both parties made occasional comments or exchanged 
questions and answers while listening to the music and looking at the photos. These 
conversations contained short periods of silence between comments, as participants 
absorbed the album content. In storytelling conversations, the album owners took 
the initiative in telling the story of certain photos. These stories were prompted and 
steered by the audience, as in ordinary photo talk (see Chap.   5 ). One minor differ-
ence was that the music itself was sometimes noteworthy, and was allowed to run to 
the end of a bar or phrase before being curtailed. 
 However, for the most part, the kinds of stories that were told were similar to the 
comments recorded as voiceovers for the talking-photo albums. This was illustrated 
most dramatically by Jane and Byron, who happened to use the same photographs 
for both types of albums. They reviewed their music-photos ﬁ rst with Nick and 
Kerri, telling the same stories as were heard later on their talking-photo album. The 
similarity was so striking that Jane often skipped through the talking-photo album 
without letting the comments play through because she had just said the same thing 
live to the background music. 
 An example of a live and recorded story on the same photograph is shown in 
Table  3.1 below. The photograph itself is shown in Fig.  3.14 , together with its 
accompanying music clip. This type of conversation around music-photos meant 
that the music tended to be listened to for the duration of the talk on each 
 photograph, rather than for the duration of the music track itself. From a rough 
calculation on each music session, the average length of time spent listening to 
each track was about 40 s rather than 3 min. This ﬁ ts with the average duration 
of recorded voice commentary, which was about 30 s (see Chap.   4  ). This com-
mentary was inﬂ ated here by about 10 s worth of prompting and reaction from 
the live audience.

3.5.4  Comparisons with Home Video 
 On the whole, participants in the audio annotation trial did not connect the music or 
talking photos they created with home video. This was in contrast to the audio cam-
era trial in which it was natural to compare the camera to a video recorder. Here, 
participants viewed what they were doing as an extension of photography and a way 
of enhancing photograph albums. The most common comment about audio annota-
tion itself, was that both music and voice annotation should be supported on the 
same set of photographs. This issue will be taken up again in the next chapter:
 To make it even better it would have been ideal to have it in together ,  music and voice 
( Vicky ) 
 I thought as a medium it worked ,  but not to separate voice from music ( Gordon ) 
 When people were prompted to compare music-photos and talking-photos with 
conventional home video they tended to express a preference for the photographic 
medium. This is revealed in the following quotes which echo the sentiments of the 
comparisons made in Chap.   2 . The effects of combining music and voices with 
photographs were seen as more professional than those obtained by capturing ambi-
ent sounds on moving images.
 The ( audiophotos )  looked better. I suppose the only videos I ’ ve looked at in this setting are 
home videos and they ’ re chronic aren ’ t they ?  This is much more professionally put together , 
 much more effective ( Rachel )

 Its like someone saying ‘ Now for a little video set ’.  It ’ s great for ﬁ ve minutes ,  wonderful 
if you are a grandparent ,  maybe and hour –  but after that ,  no. But if you have actually 
snapshot it and put it to music ,  you ’ ve got two interest points. You ’ re actually telling people 
about it ,  which is why  journaling  is so important for photo albums ,  and music sort of adds 
to the dull part ( Vicky ) 
3.6  Discussion 
 This investigation began with a sense that ordinary people might be rather good at 
selecting music for photographs, and that this would entail engaging with the kinds 
of concerns held by ﬁ lm composers in designing music for cinema. It was also 
assumed, from the  Desert Island Discs radio show, that music would have a variety 
of personal meanings for people, and might stimulate private nostalgic feelings or 
more intimate social interaction. 
 In fact, many of these starting assumptions were borne out in the results of our 
study. We found that despite an initial scepticism about the music selection task and 
their own abilities to perform it, participants were surprised at the quality and power 
of the music-photos they produced. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this ﬁ nd-
ing was that the music was selected ‘blind’ so to speak, without playback or sam-
pling with the photographs, and only reviewed sometime later when the two media 
streams had been assembled according to speciﬁ cation. The results are likely to 
improve further with the ability to review music-photo combinations on the ﬂ y, and 
with the beneﬁ t of experience. 
 As in the case of selecting funeral music, participants in the trial were sensitive 
to the aesthetic effects of the music, and to its symbolism for the audience in mind. 
The selection and discussion of favourite music-photos revealed that people were 
concerned to match the mood of the photographs and music aesthetically, and to 
choose music of personal signiﬁ cance to them or others. This signiﬁ cance factor 
was sometimes determined simply by how much they liked the music, but more 
often than not there was a deeper and more symbolic reason for selection, such as 
its association with past listening contexts, or with its title and lyrics. This meant 
that the connections between the music and the person selecting it were idiosyn-
cratic and as potentially revealing of personality as those observed on  Desert Island 
Discs . However, in contrast to what happens on this show, participants in the trial 
rarely discussed their reasons for music selection when reviewing music-photos 
with others. These connections remained implicit in the material, and it was left to 
the audience to work out the meaning of the music against a backdrop of conversa-
tion about the image. This gave the music-photos a certain poetic and cinematic feel 
to them, particularly when viewed in the absence of the author. 
 The cinematic analogy is appropriate not only to the music-photo material, but 
also to the mindset of the participants. They tended to look at their sets of photo-
graphs as sequences of images, and used the music either to tie short sequences 
together or to set individual photographs apart. As with professional ﬁ lm composers, 
3 Musical Photographs

participants were able to choose the music to reinforce the primary emotions of 
characters in the scene, or of themselves as photographers. They were also able to 
trigger new secondary emotions in the audience for the photographs, as in the cre-
ation of  joke music-photos. Some participants even voiced ﬁ lm music composition 
concerns about which medium should come ﬁ rst when combining music and images, 
and began to ask for the incorporation of other kinds of sounds, such as voiceover, 
in the overall sound design. 
3.6.1  The Role of Music in Personal Image Review 
 Regarding the prediction that music may enhance a personal memory for a photo-
graph, we found this to be true in two ways. In some of the music-photos, partici-
pants used nostalgic music, listened to around the time the photographs were taken, 
to remind them of that period. This appeared to work best for people when there was 
a history of repeated listening, as with theme tunes of regular TV programmes or 
popular music played on the radio. In these cases, an individual’s memory for the 
scene depicted in the photograph appeared to be enhanced by association with 
music of the time. 
 Another form of memory enhancement was through the use of music to match the 
mood of the scene or characters in the scene, including the photographer. This was 
the most common use and value of music in the study, and served to ‘colour’ a pho-
tograph with the emotion of those who were present at the time. This is an altogether 
more intimate function than the attachment of nostalgic music or the capture of 
ambient sound of the moment, since it goes beyond the recording of sensory stimula-
tion to reﬂ ect the inner feelings of the moment. To the extent that it is does this suc-
cessfully, we can speculate that mood music will heighten the sense of  retropresence 
to the past scene for those involved, and amplify the memories that follow. 
 Further beneﬁ ts for the personal review of images were provided by music of 
other kinds. These beneﬁ ts went beyond the enhancement of memory, into the 
realms of entertainment and communication. Pure entertainment value was deliv-
ered by music that  didn ’ t match the mood of the moment but created some other 
mood in the audience for the photograph. This was observed in a number of  joke - 
photos. Communication values were realised by music containing hidden messages 
in the title or lyrics. These were most commonly seen in  love-photos designed by 
men or women for their partners or children, as illustrated in Figs.  3.5 and  3.13 . 
Such messages were usually designed to travel between the photographer and the 
subject of the photo, although with practice, we can imagine others being designed 
for a more general audience. 
 Indeed, the interpretation of photographs by those not present at the time was also 
improved by music. At one level, the entertainment and information values of the 
photographs were simply increased by the additional medium – making them more 
interesting. But at a deeper level, participants appeared to recognise from their own 
behaviour, that there was some method to the selection of music for photographs, 
3.6 Discussion

68
and that this method often involved re-creating the mood of the moment. To this 
extent, even complete strangers in the study were able to review each other’s music-
photos with noticeably more interest and potentially more  empathy than usual. 
 Given the beneﬁ ts of music for photo interpretation, it is unfortunate that this 
behaviour would be inhibited today by music copyright law. Creators of musical 
photographs comprised of published music tracks could not send copies of such 
photographs to others without breaking the law. This increases the urgency for some 
form of micro-payment system for copies of full music tracks, or for a change in the 
law to accommodate different forms of music and multimedia consumption. One 
possibility here would be to waive charges for  partial music tracks used with pho-
tographs, since participants in the trial either selected fragments of a track or only 
listened to full tracks for a fragment of their duration.  
3.6.2  The Role of Music in Social Interaction 
 The possibility that music might enhance social interaction around photographs was 
also realised in the trial. It appeared to liven up both reminiscing  and storytelling 
conversations, which occurred over the top of the music itself. 
 Part of this effect may have been due to the inﬂ uence of music in any social setting 
as a method of raising the atmosphere and as a catalyst for conversation. As proof of 
this inﬂ uence, imagine a party without music. However, as we have seen from the 
previous section, the personal impact of speciﬁ c music on the photographs at hand 
went beyond the playing of party music on a home hi-ﬁ . This experience was more 
akin to the viewing of ﬁ lm music and images, with all the associated emotions. 
 The particular effect of music  annotations on photo sharing may therefore be to 
trigger precisely those emotions that are appropriate to the story of each photo-
graph. This may serve to stimulate story-telling or simply to elaborate it in a non- 
verbal way. The use of music in this supporting role to conversation, was exactly 
what we observed in the miss-match between the duration of each music track and 
the length of time it was listened to. Listening time was tied directly to the duration 
of conversation about corresponding photographs, and usually fell well short of the 
duration of each track.

 Chapter 4 
 Talking Photographs 
 Spread before you your photo or photos, memorabilia and any 
notes. Ask yourself this critical question: ‘If I am to give voice 
to this material, what would I have it say?’ Think in terms of 
what information is important to capture for sharing with the 
next generation. Focus on what you value, and let your insights 
help you determine where to put your emphasis (Campbell Slan 
 1999 , p. 77). 
 While most of us ﬁ nd it difﬁ cult to enough to sort our photographs into conven-
tional albums, a small but active community of people in the United States pur-
sue the hobby of  scrapbooking . This is referred to in the quote above, and 
involves the use of photos and other memorabilia to tell life stories in scrap-
books. Scrapbookers use special paper, glue and plastic covers to preserve the 
photographs in their books, they personalise the presentation of materials by 
cropping and decorating the pages in various ways, and handwrite labels and 
stories in the margins. In this way the scrapbook is designed to stand alone as a 
document for future generations in a family to review as a piece of  family his-
tory . An example scrapbook page taken from Joanna Campbell Slan’s book, cited 
above, is shown in Fig.  4.1 .
 A related hobby to  scrapbooking is  journaling . This involves writing down one’s 
life experiences as a way of expressing thoughts and feelings and documenting 
one’s life story. Hence the journal itself is usually more personal than a scrapbook, 
and designed primarily for authors themselves to read later in life. More important 
than the product, is the process of producing it, which is said to be therapeutic and 
life enhancing (e.g. Weldon  2001 ). 
 In this chapter we consider whether some of the personal and social values of 
writing in journals and scrapbooks might be captured in talking photographs. That 
is, if it were made possible to record voice labels or commentaries over photos, 
would people use this capability to capture their life stories for themselves, or record 
accounts of their  family history for others? And if they did that, would others want 
to listen to the results? 
 An additional consideration of the chapter is the  ease with which voice anno-
tation might be done, compared to writing. We note that  scrapbooking and  jour-
naling are specialist hobbies and not part of the common practice of domestic 

72
photography. In contrast, talking about one’s photos to others is an integral part 
of this practice. Furthermore, storytelling and reminiscing in conversation 
appear to confer all the same practical and therapeutic beneﬁ ts as personal his-
tory writing (c.f. Haight and Webster  1995 ; Harvey  1996 ). If verbal storytelling 
skills could be harnessed more easily around photographs, either by voice anno-
tation when photographs are ﬁ rst reviewed, or by recording subsequent photo-
sharing conversations, then the practice and beneﬁ t of personal storytelling 
might be brought into the realm of domestic photography. This chapter exam-
ines the prospect for voice annotation while Chap.   5  examines photo-conversa-
tion recording.

4.1  Related Work 
 Previous attempts to record voices with images fall into two categories. First, 
v oiceover narration is often used in ﬁ ction ﬁ lms and documentaries to complement 
the visual storytelling. Second, the use of voiceover narration with photographs is 
also ﬁ nding its way into emerging forms of  digital storytelling , in which digital 
technologies are used to record personal stories. 
 Voiceover narration in ﬁ lms can be done from the point of view of a character in 
the ﬁ lm, or of an outside commentator on the story scene (c.f. Kozloff  1988 ). An 
example of ‘ ﬁ rst person ’ narration by a character is the voice of Philip Marlowe in 
the famous detective ﬁ lms. His voice was used to set the scene and communicate his 
own thoughts and feelings about the unfolding case, as in the following quote:
 The joint looked like trouble ,  but that didn ’ t bother me. Nothing bothered me. The two twen-
ties felt nice and snug against my appendix . 
 Other examples include the reading of a letter shown on screen in the voice of its 
writer, or to preface a  ﬂ ashback or  ﬂ ash-forward in the story. 
 An example of  third person narration by an outside onlooker is often to be found 
at the beginning and end of a ﬁ lm to introduce the story and draw conclusions from 
it. In the following quote, the invisible narrator introduces the main character of the 
ﬁ lm and sets up the rest of what follows as ‘his story’:
 His name was Jeremiah Johnson and they say he wanted to be a mountain man. Story goes 
that he was a man of proper wit and adventurous spirit suited to the mountains. Nobody 
knows whereabouts he came from but it don ’ t seem to matter much …  This here ’ s his story . 
 Other  third person narrators are used in news programs and documentaries to ﬂ esh 
out the details of events and explain their meaning. Because such narrators appear to 
know more than the characters in the events, can travel to different events in space 
and time, and are never seen on camera, they may be referred to as the  voice - of - God . 
In some documentaries the voiceover is combined with camera movement over a still 
image. For example, in programmes on the American Civil War, group photos are 
often used as a backdrop from which to describe historic characters or events. 
 All these techniques add an extra dimension to visual storytelling that plays on 
the time course of the story, and the relationship between the characters, the story-
teller and the audience. All voiceovers create a kind of secret complicity and inti-
macy between the storyteller and the audience, and the origin of the voice deﬁ nes 
whether they lie inside or outside the story-world. 
 A few attempts have been made to apply these techniques to digital photographs. 
In a recent study of an electronic photo viewer, Balabnovic et al. ( 2000 ) asked peo-
ple to organise their own photographs into sequences over which they could narrate 
a story. The system allowed users to do this in a number of ways. These included 
selecting an existing chronological set of photos as a basis for voice annotation 
( photo-driven ), or assembling a new set for the story at hand ( story-driven ). It also 
allowed users to narrate after the photos had been selected or to begin speaking ﬁ rst 
and select photos within the ongoing narration. The authors found that everyone 
4.1 Related Work

74
chose to select photographs before narrating over them, at least one photo in 
advance. However, as they selected the photographs, users often moved between a 
photo-driven and a story-driven style of storytelling. For example, they might start 
recording comments on an existing set of photos, but then be prompted to bring in 
other photos to elaborate a story. A further ﬁ nding was that users did not use the 
voice recording facilities when showing their photographs to others face to face, nor 
did they record voice comments for their own use later. They preferred to explain 
the photographs live in conversation, and only resorted to recording a voiceover 
when asked to select photographs to send to remote family or friends. 
 Finally, a story-ﬁ rst approach to photographs and other memorabilia is used in an 
ongoing movement to encourage ‘ digital storytelling ’ (Lambert and Mullen  1998 ). 
This is really a form of  scrapbooking using digital and screen-based technology 
rather than paper and pens. The movement arose from the work of the late Dana 
Atchley who was a solo performer and storyteller based in San Francisco. In the 
early 1990s he developed a one-man show called  Next Exit in which he used digital 
media technology to project photographs and home movie clips as a basis for telling 
personal anecdotes. This approach was subsequently embraced and adapted by oth-
ers in the area, to encourage more private forms of storytelling with digitised pho-
tographs, video clips and voice narration. A particular adaptation was to capture 
aspects of the verbal story within a digital scrapbook or presentation. To this end Joe 
Lambert and Nina Mullen set up the San Francisco Digital Media Centre in 1994, 
and continue to run workshops teaching business and community groups how to do 
this. A recent book of their experiences has been published, although it lacks detail 
on exactly how people choose to use voiceovers in their digital scrapbooks (Lambert 
 2002 ). For example, we cannot tell what voice, content or structures are used in 
voiceovers recorded at the workshops, or what relationship they have to other visual 
media. The same details are also missing from the analysis of user behaviour in the 
study by Balabnovic et al. ( 2000 ). 
 These issues are now taken up with reference to the audio annotation trial intro-
duced in the last chapter. Having already described the ﬁ ndings for music annota-
tion, I focus here on how participants chose to combine voiceover narration with 
photographic content.     
4.2  The Audio Annotation Trial 
 Nine people were presented with the ability to record voiceover content on their 
photographs in the context of the  audio annotation trial described in Chap.   3 . 
Essentially, voiceover recordings were made during a home visit, on a small selec-
tion of photographs. These were later assembled into PC-based ‘talking photo’ 
albums, alongside additional musical photo albums and demonstrations, in prepara-
tion for a review session in HP Labs Bristol. Details of the overall study methods 
and music album procedures are given in Chap.   3 . However, it is necessary here to 
clarify the procedure for voice recording during the home visit. 
4 Talking Photographs

75
 Participants were instructed to select a set of about 10 photographs that might ben-
eﬁ t from voice annotation. They then worked through the photos in order, speaking 
comments they wanted to associate with particular images or groups of images. These 
comments were recorded on minidisc as part of the ongoing record of the interview, 
and were later extracted for digitisation and association with the corresponding 
images. We also kept a log of these associations on a two-column form, detailing 
individual photos by name and the topic of any connected comments. Some partici-
pants planned the outline of what they were going to say in advance of recording, but 
most simply began speaking and recorded their comments in a single ‘take’. All par-
ticipants were given the chance to listen to their voiceovers, but most listened to only 
a small fragment and declined to change anything. The fact that we remained present 
in the room throughout the recording session may have led some participants to bias 
their comments towards our own interests and status as strangers, although we stressed 
the importance of choosing a target audience of their own for the recordings. 
 Analysis of the talking photo set, together with participants’ reactions to it, is 
described below. As before, these data are treated separately and in order, according 
to the section headings used to report the ﬁ ndings on ambient and musical photos. 
4.3  Talking Photos Captured 
 Nine talking photo albums were created in the trial. These were made up of 105 
voiceovers on 112 photos. The majority of associations between voiceovers and pho-
tos were therefore one to one, as discussed below. However, as with the musical pho-
tographs, there was great variety in the audio material used and in the intentions behind 
the creation of each album. Some albums were used to tell the story of a single family 
trip. Others were used to relate interesting aspects of favourite photos, or to comment 
on the importance of various people in a photo set. Because the methodology involved 
sharing these creations with others, participants got to see at least one other person’s 
material in full, and the demonstration albums showing a cross-section of audiophotos 
from everyone. They were also able to discuss their views on these materials in a 
group. This method was effective in circulating different opinions about the value of 
voiceover, and generating some consensus by the end of the process. In this section I 
try to represent the variety before working towards the consensus in later sections. 
4.3.1  Types 
 Figure  4.2 shows the kind of things discussed in the 105 voiceovers recorded in the 
trial. This was based on a content analysis of what people mentioned in each 
voiceover. We found that most of the basic questions that can be asked of an event 
or scene were covered in the voiceovers. These questions include Who, What, 
Where, When and Why. These topic categories were not mutually exclusive. This 
4.3 Talking Photos Captured

76
meant that several topics could be mentioned in the same commentary, and explains 
why the percentages don’t add up to 100. Each percentage should be read on its own 
as an indication of the proportion of voiceover clip mentioning a speciﬁ c topic. For 
example, in 60 % of voiceovers, participants described  who was in the photograph. 
The only question we couldn’t map onto the recordings was ‘How?’. The method of 
doing something in the photo was seldom discussed, or was incorporated into a 
more general description of ‘What’ was happening. Instead, we found that an addi-
tional question was addressed concerning the author’s  emotional relationship to the 
photo. Hence in 60 % of voiceovers, people gave a value judgement about how they 
or others felt at the time, or now feel about the photograph itself. This is an interest-
ing discovery in view of the importance of emotion in music annotation. It suggests 
that here again, voiceover might be used to attach emotion to a photograph as well 
as to describe factual details of the depicted scene.
 Four talking photographs are shown in Figs.  4.3 ,  4.4 ,  4.5 , and  4.6 . These illus-
trate the ways in which various questions about the photographs are addressed in the 
voiceovers. Figure  4.3 is the talking version of Fig.   3.14 in Chap.   3 . In fact the 
voiceover itself is transcribed in column two of Table   3.1 . It is Jane’s story of her 
daughter’s hat and cane discovery whilst clearing out the loft before a house move. 
As such, it involves a reference to every question that can be asked about the photo-
graph, including the author’s emotional relationship to it. This makes it one of the 
most complete and complex voiceovers in the collection.
 The following question topics are addressed by the voiceover for Fig.  4.3 :
•  The subject of the photo is Rhiana when she was four and a half ( Who ?), 
•   The activity she was engaged in was dressing up with Byron’s grandfather’s hat 
and cane ( What ?) 
•  The photo was taken in their previous house ( Where ?) 
•  The photo was taken just before they moved from the house ( When ?)

•  Rhiana was dressing up was because they had discovered the props whilst clear-
ing out the loft ( Why ?) 
•  The photograph of Rhiana is one of Jane’s favourites ( Emotion ) 
 Note that the questions are not addressed in order, but rather worked into a 
chronological story form beginning with Jane’s evaluation of the photograph. 
Details of the time and location are not literal, but relative to other times and loca-
tions, and the fact that Rhiana is Jane’s daughter is not given in this particular 
voiceover because it was introduced in a previous one. A ﬁ nal complexity is that the 
story is told in two voices. The discovery of the top hat and cane is told in the  ﬁ rst 
person as a joint activity, while Rhiana’s dressing up behaviour is reported in the 
 third person . In general, the 1st person voice is used in 57 % of voiceovers. This 
ﬁ gure rises to 77 % if the speaker is a subject of the photograph. 
 Figure  4.4  is another example of a voiceover addressing multiple questions 
about the photograph. However, this time, it is not so clear who is depicted or 
when exactly the photograph was taken. Also, the voiceover is not structured as 
a story. Instead, it takes the form of a series of observations about the most strik-
ing feature of the photo; which is the fact that everyone is wearing the same 
‘tank top’ sweater. Thus, the main activity is said to be “ Us looking very smart 
with our tank tops on ”, during a holiday in Malia. The broader context for wear-
ing them and taking the picture emerges later in the voiceover. They were 
bought cheaply as a gift by one of the group and worn for at least three nights 
out on the town, of which this was “ a particularly good one ”. The point of the 
voiceover is not really to tell the story of the tank tops being purchased and 
worn repeatedly, but to use the joint wearing of the tank tops as an example of 
how  together they were as a group and how much fun they had. In fact, the fun 
elements are underscored by no less than four separate references to positive 
emotions in the voiceover, while togetherness is emphasised by narration in the 
 ﬁ rst person . 
 Figure  4.5 gives another indication of the complexity and richness of 
voiceovers recorded in the study. As in the previous two examples, the voiceover 
addresses some of the standard questions that can be asked about the photo-
graph. The difference here is that those questions relate to two distinct time 
periods in which the scene was visited; the current time at which the photo was 
taken and previous times “ when my children were small ”. In other words, the 
voiceover incorporates a  ﬂ ashback . In the ﬁ rst part of the narration John talks 
about the difﬁ culty of capturing the particular view of the bridge and village 
shown in the photograph. Through this account he is able to say where the pho-
tograph was taken and something about why. In the second part of the narration 
John goes further back in time, to talk about a previous habit of coming to the 
same place with his children. In this ﬂ ashback he uses a past participle in the  ﬁ rst 
person   with phrases like “ we used to take bits of bread and throw them in the 
stream ”. With this technique John describes a new set of actors and activities for 
the scene that are not shown in the photograph, but are triggered by it. This 
example shows that photographs can be used to talk about memories associated

with any aspect of their content, and may not necessarily relate to the time the 
photograph was taken. 
 The practice of speaking about things outside the photograph at hand is also 
illustrated in Fig.  4.6 . This is our ﬁ nal example of voiceover types, and relates to a 
picture of gun turrets in an Albanian landscape. It is one of a series of photographs 
of a trip to this country by Rob in the trial. Although some of Rob’s other voiceovers 
are more personal and descriptive of people and events in the pictures, this one is 
not. Instead it talks about the gun posts in the image and the fact that they point 
inward towards the population rather than outward towards the sea. Where, what 
and why questions about the image are covered in the voiceover, but in a way that 
describes the politics of the country rather than Rob’s personal memories of the 
scene. Insofar as they can be counted, these kinds of externally-facing voiceovers 
accounted for about 18 % of those recorded in the study. These included other sto-
ries about the character of a country or its citizens, and references to the personali-
ties of people in the photographs.  
4.3.2  Durations 
 The length of voiceover clips varied from a few seconds to a few minutes as shown 
in Fig.  4.7 . However, the average duration was 29 s, with 95 % of all clips lying 
between eight and 50 s. These ﬁ gures are similar to those found for ambient sound 
clips in the audio-camera trial, but considerably shorter than the 3-min music clips 
also observed in the audio annotation study.
 The talking photographs already shown in Figs.  4.3 ,  4.4 ,  4.5 , and  4.6 are a fairly 
typical length. The voiceovers in Figs.  4.4 and  4.6 are around 30 s long, while

those in Figs.  4.3 and  4.5  are somewhat longer (41 and 60 s respectively). The 
1-min narration in Fig.  4.5 is due to the fact that two stories are told about the 
photograph, one for the time it was taken and one in  ﬂ ashback . These parts could 
almost be separated into two separate voiceovers of about 30 s each. Other long 
voiceovers have this multiple story form, although sometimes it is from the contri-
butions of two different speakers. For example, the talking photo shown in Fig.  4.8 
has a 66 s voiceover with contributions from both Byron (46 s) and Jane (20 s) 
about their mutual friend shown in the image.
 At the other end of the spectrum, some voiceovers were under 10 s long. These 
tended to be simple voice labels for the photographs, such as you might write on the 
back of a print. An example of one of these is shown in Fig.  4.9 . This is a picture of 
Buckingham Palace in London with a 7 s voiceover saying so. Voice labels of this 
kind typically addressed only one of the questions shown in Fig.  4.2 – usually either 
Where or Who.
   Another reason for very short voiceover recordings was that they were embed-
ded in a narration relating to a series of photographs. Individual portions of this 
narration still related to particular photographs, but were short. They could also 
cut in at the beginning or cut off at the end. This issue concerns the relationship 
between the voiceovers and the photographs, and will now be explored in the 
next section.

4.3.3  Associations 
 The majority of sound and image associations for the talking photo set were one-to- 
one. Hence participants recorded a single voiceover for a single photograph in 94 % 
of cases. For this reason I have not included a graph of associations, as in previous 
chapters. Many of the voiceover recordings were self-contained stories or reﬂ ec-
tions on the photographs, as in most of the above examples. However, sometimes 
these stories were designed to ﬁ t together across photographs, even though their 
individual parts still bore a one-to-one association with constituent photographs. An 
example of this is given in Fig.  4.10 , which is the ﬁ rst part of an album describing a 
trip to Disneyland. After a scene-setting voiceover on the ﬁ rst photograph in the set, 
Vicky recorded a series of shorter voiceovers describing individual Disney charac-
ters encountered on the visit. Note that the recorded speech on each photograph is 
understandable in its own right, but works better when viewed in the context of the 
series. In rare cases, we found that the speech on individual photographs could be 
truncated at the beginning or end of each clip and therefore become less understand-
able on its own. This is actually true of Fig.  4.9 , which is a voice label embedded in 
a longer account of a trip to London. If you listen carefully to the opening of this clip 
you can hear the talking begin in the middle of a sentence. We decided not to clas-
sify these voiceovers as one sound to many photographs unless authors expressed an 
intention to have the speech run over more than one photograph at a time.
 
4 Talking Photographs

83
 Where participants did express a desire for a voiceover to run over more than one 
photograph, it was always in the context of requesting more than one photograph 
per screen page. The album enthusiasts Vicky and Traci did this more than others in 
the trial, since they were used to arranging multiple prints on a single photo album 
page. An example of one of Traci’s screen-based versions of this with voiceover is 
shown in Fig.  4.11 . The voiceover relates to two photographs taken inside Hamley’s 
toy store in London. It therefore falls into the 6 % of one sound to many photo asso-
ciations in the talking photo set.

4.4  Reactions 
4.4.1  Initial Reactions 
 The idea of recording voice commentary on photographs was less alien to partici-
pants than the notion of attaching music. Nevertheless, they expressed some skepti-
cism about its value, and a certain amount of dismay at having to record their own 
voices. Most people said that they didn’t like the sound of their own voice, but 
would be happy to listen to the voices of others: 
 This prejudice continued beyond the recording process at home, and coloured 
the participants’ initial reactions to the talking photograph albums in the Feedback 
Groups. In general, they preferred listening to other people’s talking photos than to 
their own. This also made them also more inclined to favour their own music photos 
over their own talking photos. Both effects are apparent in the following quote by 
Nick:
 I preferred the music photos. It might have been because it was my own voice though. I 
think Jane ’ s sounded better than mine (Nick) 
 However, the physical sound of one’s own voice was only one reason for this 
preference for other people’s voiceovers. In fact, several people said they got used 
to hearing their own voices after a while. Another reason was that the content of 
other people’s talking photographs was simply more interesting. By deﬁ nition, par-
ticipants already knew the content of their own talking photographs, and were natu-
rally more interested in what other people had to say about  their photographs. This 
was revealed in a number of comments questioning the point of recording voiceovers 
for yourself, and praising the voiceovers of others:
 You know in your head the memories that you have of that particular holiday ,  so you don ’ t 
need the voiceover (Rachel) 
 I felt the photographs with the commentary were much more interesting than the music 
because it enabled me to see what Nick was thinking and feeling at the time (Jane) 
 Alongside the preference for other people’s talking photos, was a realisation that 
one’s own talking photographs would be more interesting to other people, and espe-
cially to those who weren’t present at the time the photograph was taken. This was 
stated directly by Gordon in the trial, when asked if it was worth the effort of record-
ing voiceovers on his photographs.
 It depends on whether the person I ’ m showing it to was with me at the time I took the photo , 
 because if they were there ,  there is no point to all the explanation. I would do this to show 
to people who weren ’ t there at the time (Gordon) 
 For others, the same realisation was expressed in terms of a shift in the intended 
audience for their talking photographs. When asked at the home visit who they were 
recording the voiceovers for, participants were evenly split in saying they were for 
themselves or for their close family and friends. However, when asked at the 
4 Talking Photographs

85
Feedback Group who they thought would beneﬁ t most from the albums, they tended 
to mention only geographically distant family and friends:
 I would send it. We’ve got an uncle that lives in the States so if we’d been able to send him 
something like this to look at the kids, a self-explanatory thing, that would be good ( Rachel ) 
 I would use it more to send to people than to sit someone down ( Traci ) 
4.4.2  Favourites 
 After seeing the talking photo material for the ﬁ rst time, participants voted on their 
favourite combinations from their own and each others’ albums. They also wrote 
down the reason for these choices. There appeared to be three main reasons for 
selecting favourites from any album. These included the personal signiﬁ cance of the 
photograph, the interest of the voiceover, and the mention of emotion. 
 As with the selection of favourite music photos, the personal signiﬁ cance of the 
material was important to the selection of talking photos. For example, some par-
ticipants chose a favourite talking photo from their own set because they simply 
liked the photograph and its associated memories. This could be seen in the selec-
tion of favourites by three of the mothers in the trial who selected talking photos 
containing images of their children. Jane chose Fig.  4.3 showing her daughter with 
the hat and cane, Traci chose Fig.  4.11 showing her daughter and nanny together at 
 Fig. 4.12   Nick and Kerry’s favourite talking photo of Kerry 
 
4.4 Reactions

86
Hamleys, and Vicky chose an audiophoto of her children meeting Mini Mouse at 
Disneyworld. A similar choice was made by John, who chose a talking photo about 
his grandchildren. Figure  4.12 shows Nick’s favourite talking photo of his girlfriend 
Kerry who was also present at the feedback group. Kerry also chose this audiophoto 
as her favourite, perhaps as much for the personal signiﬁ cance of what Nick said 
about her in the voiceover, as for the image itself. Note that this is the talking ver-
sion of the same photograph that is set to music in Fig.   3.13  .
 The interest of the voiceover was also used as a criterion for selecting a favourite 
talking photo. This was a slightly different criterion to the ﬁ t between sound and 
image, which was important to the selection of favourite music photos. It seemed to 
have more to do with the form and content of the voiceover itself. For example, Jane 
selected Byron’s talking photo of a Japanese temple, simply because “Byron’s 
description is so clear and interesting”. This voiceover is contained within Fig.  4.13 , 
and is the counterpart to a musical version shown in Fig.   3.8 . Byron himself chose 
a favourite talking photo of a friend’s daughter from his own album “Because it

describes the picture so well”. In a ﬁ nal example, Rachel chose Rob’s talking photo 
of the Albanian gun posts shown in Fig.  4.6 as a favourite for the following reason:
 It’s a gorgeous photo in its own right, but the message behind it is so telling ( Rachel ) 
 The mention of value or  emotion in the voiceover also seemed to increase its 
attraction and the likelihood of selecting it as part of a favourite talking photo. This 
could be seen statistically in content of voiceovers selected as favourites from par-
ticipants’ own albums. Seventy eight percent contained references to the emotion of 
the image or scene. This compares with an incidence of 60 % in the rest of the 
 corpus. However, additional evidence came from the  reasons for selection, which 
often referred to the fact that the voiceovers revealed something about how the 
author was feeling or thinking at the time. This was expressed by Rachel as a reason 
for selecting her own favourite talking photo, shown in Fig.  4.14 . The photograph 
was signiﬁ cant to Rachel because it contained the image of a cross. The voiceover 
allowed her to explain this signiﬁ cance and therefore to reveal something of her own 
faith and personality.

4.4.3  The Value of Voiceover 
 From discussion of the talking photo material in the Feedback Groups it became 
apparent that participants attached different values to voiceover, depending on 
whether it was theirs or not. If they were the author, they valued the ability to per-
sonalise the photographs or add a message to someone else. If they were the audi-
ence, they valued the way in which the voiceovers added interest and interpretation 
to the photographs, and revealed the personality of the sender. 
 In the ﬁ rst case, we have already seen how a voiceover was valued by an author 
for the way that it allowed them to  personalise a photograph. This was introduced 
above, in connection with Fig.  4.14 . Rachel’s favourite talking photo shown in the 
ﬁ gure was actually a self-portrait in which she appears in both the photograph and 
the voiceover. In her case, she liked the voiceover because it allowed her to speak 
about her faith. 
 Equally personal voiceovers were recorded on images that did  not contain the 
speaker (see for example Figs.  4.3 ,  4.4 , and  4.5 ). These can also be seen as self- 
portraits of a sort, in which the speaker can enter the life of the photograph through 
the voiceover. Clearly they are most revealing when the author speaks about their 
own feelings, thoughts or beliefs. However they are also revealing even when such 
things are not mentioned, simply because of the way the voiceover is spoken. This 
can be seen in Rob’s Albanian gun post voiceover in Fig.  4.6 , whose content is 
impersonal and doesn’t mention emotion. His voice itself is still full of character, 
and serves to personalise a photograph that is utterly devoid of people and life. In 
this way, voiceovers came to act as  voice signatures for photographs, through which 
people could reveal more or less of themselves to others, depending on what they 
‘wrote’ into the recording. 
 Writing is actually a good analogy for how people used and valued voiceovers as 
a communication medium. Again for authors, voiceovers were seen as another way 
of  adding messages to photographs, akin to writing a letter to send with reprints, or 
 journaling in the margins of a photograph album page. In both these situations, the 
writing explains the reason for sending a photograph to a particular audience. 
Voiceovers did a similar job for their authors. They also appeared to give authors a 
chance to voice thoughts and feelings that are hard to articulate face-to-face. For 
example, Traci told us that she designed her favourite talking photo in Fig.  4.11 as 
part of a series for Rebecca her nanny who is shown in the picture. On an earlier 
photo she stated that Rebecca came over from the States to help out during a period 
when Rob was ill, and “ was very much an encouragement to us ”. This choice of 
words, and their location within a series of happy photographs taken during a sad 
time, underscores the value that Traci placed on Rebecca’s help, and constitute a 
kind of multimedia thank you card. Although Traci had tried to tell her this directly, 
she felt that the talking photographs would be more effective in communicating her 
feelings. 
 This kind of subtle communication is similar to that observed for some of the 
music-photos that communicated a hidden message in their lyrics. The most direct 
4 Talking Photographs

89
use of music for this purpose was in love photos of the kind shown in Fig.   5.5 . The 
same phenomenon was observed again in talking photos such as Nick’s message to 
Kerry in Fig.  4.12 and John’s talking version of Fig.   3.5 to his wife, shown in 
Fig.  4.15 . This shows the same image of Betty’s face, accompanied this time with 
some of John’s thoughts about her. For people who may ﬁ nd it difﬁ cult to talk about 
their feelings for their partners directly, voiceovers like this may provide a more 
natural alternative to letters, email or text messages.
 In the context of receiving photographs voiceovers were seen to  add interest to 
photographs that might have been more boring on their own. This was mentioned 
directly by John who was thinking about being handed a large pile of someone 
else’s holiday photos to look through. In this scenario he seemed to judge the talking 
photos to be more interesting than a live explanation by the author, although the 
majority of participants felt that their greatest beneﬁ t was realised when the author 
was absent. There may also be an overall enhancement of interest by virtue of 
selecting certain photographs for annotation, thereby ﬁ ltering out the least interest-
ing ones. Finding out more of the  story of the photo and the memory of the author 
appeared to be the key sources of interest added by voiceover:
 This to me is part of the boredom when people get their holiday photos out and they bring 
out a big pile of envelopes with hundreds of photos in. Whereas with this ,  as we have all 
been saying ,  it seems that the voice makes it more interesting (John) 
 In Vicky ’ s the music was excellent ,  but it needed the voice to tell me what was going on 
(Traci) 
 Discovering the thoughts and feelings of the author in relation to the photo-
graphs, was the ﬁ nal value of talking photographs to those receiving them. This is 
the ﬂ ip side of the value of expressing such feelings by senders. There were many

wife 
 
4.4 Reactions

90
indications that participants liked this revelatory aspect of the voiceovers, not least 
of which was the use of this criterion in selecting favourite talking photos (see 
above). But perhaps the most succinct comment on this value came from Betty who 
noticed that the playback of a voiceover on a photograph shifts the receivers’ atten-
tion from the photograph to the speaker. To this extent a talking photograph raises 
questions not only about the scene and what is happening within it, but also about 
the person recording the voiceover on the scene and their relationship to it:
 With the voice you immediately think of the person that ’ s speaking (Betty) 
4.5  Practice 
 The ease or otherwise of recording and using talking photographs is discussed in 
this section. Some initial judgements are made from observing the process of voice 
recording during the home visits, and the process of reviewing the results during the 
feedback groups. Participants also made comments about their likely use of the 
medium after the review sessions. 
4.5.1  Capture 
 On the whole, participants took easily to the role of recording voiceover on their 
photographs. This was despite their professed dislike of hearing their own voice on 
playback. Recording may have been made easier by our presence as strangers in the 
house, since we inadvertently became a live audience for their commentaries. 
However, participants were encouraged to think of another, more realistic, audience 
for their comments, and seemed to have little trouble in visualising someone and 
thinking of something to tell them. 
 The real problem was in selecting the right someone, and the appropriate set of 
photographs to annotate. I have already noted above that there was an initial ten-
dency for participants to record voiceovers for themselves or their close family, such 
as children and partners. Once they had seen the results of these attempts, they 
reported wanting to shift their audience to distant family and friends. This can be 
seen in terms of the three album contexts for annotation mentioned in the discussion 
of music capture in Chap.   3 . Attempts to annotate chronological photo albums with 
voiceover were judged less successful than attempts to annotate sets of reprints or 
themed albums to give away. Future voice annotation would therefore be directed 
towards the latter two contexts, as illustrated in the following quote:
 Its probably just like a gift to someone. That ’ s what I would use it for (Traci) 
 In the context of designing talking photos to give away, participants made two 
kinds of suggestions for enhancing capture. Either the voice comments could be 
4 Talking Photographs

91
made more spontaneous by capturing them along with the photographs on camera, 
or they could be made more professional by scripting voiceovers recorded later. The 
ﬁ rst suggestion might be more appropriate to reprints, while the second would 
enhance themed albums or scrapbooks:
 If I was taking a role of ﬁ lm and I could talk and say something about the photographs ,  then 
I might want to do that (Byron) 
 I ’ d record it at night when the kids were in bed. I would probably sit down and write 
down what I wanted ,  then record (Vicky). 
 There was also a feeling that a sequence of photos worked better for voiceover 
and needed to be selected carefully before recording. This was encapsulated in a 
discussion between Traci and Vicky in the study. Vicky used a series of photographs 
of her children with different characters at Disneyworld for her talking photo album, 
while Traci used more of a mixed set relating to different days out. Both women 
judged Vicky’s album to be more effective because it told a single story over the 
photo set.
 Traci :  I mean it sounded like I was just saying it off the top of my head ,  whereas Vicky ’ s 
sounded like a story 
 Vicky :  I think my photos probably helped compared to yours ,  because yours would have 
been hard to carry a theme through or create a dialog that was sort of a continuous story 
4.5.2  Editing 
 Apart from the observations made above about capturing talking photos differently, 
participants said very little about editing them. Most voiceover recordings were 
done in one take, and were judged good enough to use in their original form. This 
ﬁ nding on the acceptability of voiceovers should not be surprising, since it is the 
very same attitude that participants had to their photographs. While some photos 
were judged better than others, few were judged bad enough to require 
modiﬁ cation. 
 What was requested was the ability to combine voiceover with music on the 
same photographs. This was mentioned brieﬂ y in the context of reporting the music 
ﬁ ndings, and demands further attention here. This combination can be seen as quite 
a natural thing to request by people who were asked to review the value of music 
and voice annotation in the same study. Some of these people even experimented 
with putting both types of sound on the same set of photographs and could directly 
compare the effects. These included Byron and Jane, John and Betty, Gordon, and 
Nick. Aesthetically the mix is more compelling than the individual sounds, since 
voice and music serve to personalise a photograph in different ways and communi-
cate different kinds of information about the associated mood and memory. 
 The main problem with combining music and voice has to do with the relative 
loudness of each and the difﬁ culty of listening to both tracks together, especially 
when there are lyrics in the music track. Participants acknowledged this interference 
4.5 Practice

92
problem in responding to an extra music-and-voiceover album we had made up 
from Jane and Byron’s albums. This highlights the need for careful sound balancing 
in mixed tracks, and perhaps for manual controls at playback that could be used to 
change this balance interactively. 
4.5.3  Review 
 The presence of voiceover on a photograph tended to inhibit conversation around it, 
when participants tried to share their albums with each other. This was in stark con-
trast with the review of musical photographs which seemed to stimulate conversa-
tion. In a typical session, the author of the talking photo album would control the 
turning of each screen-page, in time to the ending of each full voiceover clip. While 
the voiceover played, participants would listen quietly, waiting until the end to make 
further comments or ask questions. This pattern was broken only in rare cases where 
the same photograph had been seen before as part of a music album, and the author 
had already told the recorded story live (see again Table   3.1 ). 
 This kind of review behaviour meant that participants tended to look quietly at 
each talking photograph for about 29 s – the average duration of voiceovers them-
selves. However, because of the wide range of clips around this time, some pairs of 
participants spent far longer staring at a single image in silence. The record was 
achieved by John and Betty who listened patiently to John’s verbal description of 
their association with a waterfall for 103 s. This is a long time to sit without talking 
in any social setting, and is made all the more noticeable by the fact that their focus 
of attention was on a single static image. 
 To put this into perspective, the average pause length in conversation is usually 1 
s (Jefferson  1988 ) while the average duration of a  moving image shot on television 
is about 5 s. So the tendency to suspend conversation for so long around a  photograph 
is very unusual indeed, and must be due to some powerful social force at work. One 
possibility is that participants were treating the voiceover  as conversation. They 
would therefore tend to wait for its contribution to ﬁ nish before speaking them-
selves. This is in marked contrast to something like watching the television, where 
speaking over television voices appears to be more acceptable. 
4.6  Discussion 
 In short, the opportunity to record voiceover on photographs was welcomed by 
participants in the trial, despite some misgivings about the sound of their own 
voices. Everyone had a lot to say about the photographs they selected and were keen 
to experience what a talking photograph would feel like. However there were vari-
ous problems with voiceovers which limited their usefulness to listeners. 
4 Talking Photographs

 For example, the content of voiceovers did not always tell the story-of-the-photo 
in Berger’s terms (Berger  1982 a). Stories were something that participants strived 
for in the activity of selecting and commenting on their photographs. But they were 
not always evident in what they actually said. Typically, participants would answer 
two or three classes of questions about each photograph, such as who was in it, 
where the photo was taken and what was happening. Furthermore, when they did 
describe a temporal sequence of events, this was just as likely to refer to a period 
covered by multiple photographs or not really covered at all (for example with a 
 ﬂ ashback ), as it was to refer to the local period of time in which the photo was situ-
ated. These accounts could also be told in the ﬁ rst or  third person . In short, any 
voiceover pointed to the  context for a photograph, but it could do this at any level, 
from more than one perspective, and in more or less detail depending on the intended 
audience. This kind of selective description was identiﬁ ed by Rachel in the trial, at 
the end of her voiceover on the stone cross of Fig.  4.14 . She concluded by saying:
 So that was a potted history ,  a snapshot of our time in Cornwall (Rachel) 
 The notion that a voiceover is itself a snapshot of all the things that  could be said 
about a photograph is reminiscent of work by Sacks ( 1970 ) on the news-worthiness 
of stories in conversation. By analysing the presentation of news in conversation, he 
found that what is news to one audience is common ground to another. Speakers are 
aware of this and act to select, mark and phrase information interactively, in order 
to maximise its news-worthiness. 
 Participants in our study appeared to do something similar with their voiceovers, 
giving a  version of what could be said which they believed would be news to the 
intended audience. This arrangement worked well as long as the intended audience 
was someone else who could be clearly visualised at the time the voiceover was 
made. However, if the intended audience could not be visualised, or was the author 
him/herself, the voiceover was less newsworthy and effective. 
 In the worst cases, it was impossible for authors to record any version of events 
that was not already known to them. This made them disinclined to use voice 
 annotations for archiving photographs for future personal use. This is despite the 
fact that they might beneﬁ t from such annotations long term, when their own mem-
ory for events fails. One way out of this paradox might be to archive voice annota-
tions recorded for others, within a personal photo collection. These might be used 
to retrieve photographs from the collection and to remind authors of forgotton 
details with the passage of time. A similar technique has been developed for collect-
ing text annotations from email messages with photo attachments (Lieberman and 
Liu  2002 ). 
4.6 Discussion

4.6.1  Role of Voiceover in Personal Image Review 
 Thus, although voiceovers were recorded for almost all the uses of photographs 
shown in the diamond framework of Chap.   1 , participants settled on one use above 
all as having the highest value. This was the ability to add personal and contextual 
details to a photograph in order to aid its  interpretation by a remote audience. This 
ﬁ nding explains why the ambient commentary in the audiocamera trial was felt to 
be less valuable than ambient environmental sounds. Participants in that study 
tended to use such commentary as a voice label for themselves rather than as a voice 
message for others, and were consequently disappointed in the results. In both trials, 
voice labels were not found to enhance the memory of a photograph for the people 
involved. This pattern of ﬁ ndings is similar to that observed by Balabanovic et al. 
( 2000 ) using different methods. In their study, subjects only recorded voiceover on 
photographs they imagined sending to others. 
 The reason for these effects becomes clear when we consider the speciﬁ c reported 
values of voiceover in our study. A talking photograph was perceived by its receiv-
ers to be more interesting than a silent photo and to be more revealing of the thoughts 
and feelings of its author. These were the end-user beneﬁ ts. In addition, the authors 
and senders of talking photographs valued the way they allowed them to ‘frame’ a 
photo with contextual information and to personalise it with something of them-
selves. Such personalisation could be done directly, by including a direct emotional 
reference to how the author felt about the image or activity depicted. It was also 
done implicitly by attaching the author’s voice itself as a signature or self-portrait of 
sorts. These dual beneﬁ ts of voiceover to senders as well as receivers imply a value 
to the processes of recall and recognition of an image, as well as to its private inter-
pretation (see again Fig.   1.2 ). However, this value has more to do with the represen-
tation of the self to oneself and others, than with the remembering of the event itself. 
Voiceovers then, appear to inﬂ uence the communication and interpretation of 
images, and this can be just as much of a beneﬁ t to senders as to receivers. 
4.6.2  Role of Voiceover in Social Interaction 
 Despite the beneﬁ ts of voiceovers in the interpretation of photographs, they were 
found to be less than useful in live social interactions. Their presence was found to 
inhibit conversation around photographs. This led to the bizarre situation of two or 
more participants staring at a photograph for long periods of time while listening in 
silence to recorded voice comments. Because speakers are so sensitive to the shift-
ing interests and responses of recipients in conversation, live commentary on a pho-
tograph is likely to be altogether more newsworthy and interesting than recorded 
commentary. 
 This may also go some way to explaining the frustration with ambient sound in 
the audiocamera trial of Chap.   2 . Many of the ambient sound clips included voice

commentary and recorded conversation. Participants found it difﬁ cult to talk over 
these, especially in storytelling conversations. Any ambient commentary arising in 
these situations would therefore be more difﬁ cult to talk over because of the com-
petition between live and recorded  explanations .

 Conversational Photographs 
 Had I showed for example all my wedding photos – I’d have 
had a summary of the day from my perspective which in years 
to come would be a nice memory for me or an interesting story 
for our daughter (Brid, Storytelling photograph study) 
 Imagine for a moment you are a photograph. You would have a pretty interesting 
social life for an object. You will be conceived instantaneously in an environment of 
ambient sound and activity. You will be born into a family with at least one parent, 
either at hospital (the photo processing lab) or at home (the home photo printer). 
Your family will fuss over you at birth, passing you around and talking about your 
resemblance to people and things in the past. Then you will get proudly shown off 
to family and friends who will comment on your charm and good looks. Eventually 
your novelty will wear off, and you will be put to bed for a while, possibly in your 
own space (album), until such time as one of your parents decides to wheel you out 
with your brothers and sisters to see how you are getting on, or to show you off 
again at social gatherings. If you are really lucky, you will get to stay out forever 
(frame) to attract the comments of visitors. Granted this is something of a shallow 
life, which revolves around appearances and gives you very little scope for initia-
tive. But hey, you don’t have to go to school or work, and you still get to meet a lot 
of interesting people and make a variety of friends for life. 
 This scenario illustrates for domestic photography what Schaverian ( 1991 ) 
means by the  life of an image in  art therapy . I have represented this life as lines 
of social interaction around a photograph in the diamond framework of Chap.   1 
(Fig.   1.2  ). These lines show that there is a sonic environment around printed 
photographs which is every bit as rich and varied as that which exists around the 
original experience that the photograph represents. Just as we can choose to 
preserve the original ambient sound context of this experience with the photo-
graph, so we can choose to preserve the later sound context – not once, but 
many times during the life of the photo. Although the later sound contexts may 
include ambient sounds, they are likely to contain a greater proportion of con-
versation, this time about the photograph or experience itself. I call this kind of 
conversation  photo - talk , to distinguish it from ambient conversation around the 
time of image capture. Just as we considered the properties and value of  ambient 

98
photographs in Chap.   2 , we now consider the properties and value of  conversa-
tional photograph s, by which I mean photographs combined with recordings of 
photo-talk. 
 Because photo-talk occurs spontaneously around photographs and contains 
conversation about the images, it serves as a free source of voiceovers. Given the 
beneﬁ ts of voiceovers described in the previous chapter, at least in aiding the 
interpretation of photographs by a remote audience, it would be useful to capture 
them automatically. This would overcome the time and effort required to con-
sciously record voiceovers for each new set of photographs. In the example 
above, perhaps the conversation between family members about a new photo-
graph, could be recorded and transmitted with the photograph itself to remote 
family and friends. Alternatively, perhaps a collection of conversations around a 
single photograph could be recorded and kept with the photograph for future 
personal reference by the author or subject. These possibilities are explored here 
and contrasted with previous ﬁ ndings on the properties of voiceover on 
photographs. 
 The approach to studying conversational photographs is somewhat different to 
that used to study other kinds of audiophotos. The use of a single trial methodology 
is possible, but would affect the very behavior we are trying to study. It would 
involve asking people to share photographs with each other, and then to select parts 
of the recorded conversation to keep with the photographs for posterity. The ensuing 
conversation might be very different from that which would have taken place spon-
taneously without intervention. A more suitable approach would be to record spon-
taneous episodes of photo-talk, and then to ask participants to identify those parts of 
the conversation they would like to keep with the photographs involved. This is a 
considerable challenge, since an experimenter would either have to be on hand to do 
this sporadically over long periods of time, or delegate the tasks of recording and 
selecting to participants themselves. 
 In fact, a variation of both approaches is reported here. A study of naturalistic 
photo sharing was used to examine the character of photo-talk itself, and its poten-
tial to serve as an effective form of voiceover for the photographs involved. The 
ﬁ ndings also establish a basic understanding of ordinary printed photo sharing 
against which to evaluate comments on print-based and screen-based methods of 
sharing audiophotos in the next chapter. Participants in this study were asked to ﬁ ll 
in photo-diaries tracking the occurrence of photo sharing conversations over a 
3-month period, and to record as many conversations as possible on audiotape. A 
subsequent laboratory study of photo sharing was used to assess the value of record-
ing particular kinds of conversational photographs identiﬁ ed in the ﬁ rst study. 
Participants here reviewed a video of their photo sharing session and ticked off, 
from a contact sheet, those photographs for which they would have like to have 
saved the corresponding conversation. To set the scene for both studies, I brieﬂ y 
review existing work in this area, in order to build on what is already known about 
these sorts of conversations.

5.1  Related Work 
 While almost nothing is known about photo-talk itself, a related form of talk with-
out photographs has been extensively studied. I will refer to this form as  conversa-
tional storytelling . This involves telling stories of one’s own or other people’s lives 
in order to make points in the course of a conversation. This is one kind of talk 
amongst many that have been studied within the ﬁ elds of sociolinguistics and con-
versation analysis (Goffman  1981 ; Drew  1994 ). The relevance of conversational 
storytelling to photo-talk will become clear as we apply what is known about it to a 
common sense view of storytelling with photographs. I present this view as a ‘straw 
man’ theory about photo-talk that is de-bunked by the work on conversational sto-
rytelling, and by work reported later in this chapter. 
 Thus from any experience, such as a holiday abroad, people may take photo-
graphs to remind them of the things they did. Any individual photograph can trigger 
a memory of what actually happened and this can be used in conversation to illustrate 
a story describing the course of events. Because the photograph always indexes the 
same event and memory, it should lead to roughly same story being re-told time and 
again in different conversations. Furthermore, because the order of photographs in a 
set usually corresponds to the order in which they were taken in time, the stories they 
trigger will tend to be narratives describing the unfolding of activities over time. I 
will call this account the  slide - show model  of photo - talk , because it suggests a single 
person standing up before an audience and taking people through a series of photo-
graphs and memories in a ﬁ xed presentation. Although the audience might call out 
questions of clariﬁ cation from time to time, or gasp in amazement at twists in the 
storyline, the presentation would run its course until the last photo had been explained. 
In fact this model is implicitly assumed in current digital photo sharing applications. 
They usually distinguish between an ad hoc photo browsing mode for personal use, 
and a more linear slide-show mode for presentation to an audience. Stories are 
assumed to be cued by the presentation, and to unfold with the photographs. 
 Conversational storytelling turns out to be an altogether more difﬁ cult and com-
plex achievement. In the ﬁ rst place, the storyteller must ﬁ nd a way of introducing the 
story in the course of an ongoing conversation and phrase it in such a way as to reach 
a conclusion. Failure to do so would result in the storyteller being perceived as mad, 
rude or self-indulgent, and the point of the narrative would be lost (Polanyi  1985 ). 
Consequently there is usually ‘entrance’ and ‘exit’ talk in the course of telling a story 
in conversation that marks it out from other activities such as remarks, questions, 
requests and so on. This marking is particularly important if the story is to take more 
than one turn, since it forestalls the listener from interrupting the story in its telling 
(Sacks et al.  1974 ). Sacks ( 1968a ,  1974 ) describes the talk which does the initial 
marking as a  story preface , and shows how it sets up the listener to listen for a certain 
point in the story’s completion. For example, in the following story preface, a woman 
(A) gets ready to tell her friend (B) about a car wreck she saw on the freeway (see 
Fig.  5.1 ). However, the point of the story is that it was not reported in the local paper. 
The relevance of the paper is introduced at the outset of the story. Consequently, B 
5.1 Related Work

does not respond to A’s initial question about reading the papers in the second turn. 
She waits until the story of what happened on the drive to Ventura is completed with 
“It wasn’t in the paper last night, I looked” some 19 turns later (not shown). In each 
of these examples the ﬁ gure labels are used to introduce a number of conventions for 
transcribing talk, developed within conversation analysis. Only those which are 
helpful to the analysis are used. For further details of these and other transcript con-
ventions see the opening sections of Atkinson and Heritage ( 1984 ).
 While the introduction of stories relating to photographs might be prefaced by 
the presentation of a particular photograph, it is unlikely that this act alone would 
perform all the subtle work of a conventional  story preface . It is much more likely 
that any stories about photographs will be embedded in a stream of non-story talk, 
and require introduction and conclusion in the usual way. 
 Another ﬁ nding about the conclusion of stories further complicates this picture. 
In conversation, people often tell  second stories in response to a ﬁ rst. A second 
story not only demonstrates that they have been listening and understand the point 
of the ﬁ rst story (Sacks  1968b ), it also serves as a form of reciprocal self-disclosure 
(Duck and Pittman  1994 ; Sprecher  1987 ). For example, in response to the story 
prefaced in Extract 1 above, B offers the second story shown partially in Fig.  5.2 . It 
describes her witnessing a different disaster and also failing to ﬁ nd it reported in the 
papers. Although these stories are not full of intimate life details, their exchange 
serves to maintain a friendship between these two women that includes sharing their 
observations and questions on life (c.f. Duck  1994 ). In the context of a friendship, a 
one way sharing would be strange. The telling of a series of (ﬁ rst) stories from pho-
tographs without allowing the audience to respond would also be strange, especially 
if the audience is well known to the storyteller. Photo-talk then, might be more or 
less littered with second stories by audience members. These would have nothing to 
do with the photographer’s memory of events but everything to do with the audi-
ence’s memory of similar events and observations.
 So far we have seen that stories about photographs, as about anything else, might 
be embedded in a stream of talk that includes non-story talk, introductions to the 
stories, conclusions or punch lines, and  second stories told by the audience. A ﬁ nal 
set of ﬁ ndings from the literature shows that individual stories themselves are sub-
ject to variation within and between tellings. This means that the same story may 
never be told in the same way twice. This has to do not only with the inﬂ uence of 
the audience on the story, but also with the inﬂ uence of the storytelling on the 
author’s memory for the story.

 From any event it is possible for people to generate a wide variety of accounts or 
descriptions. This can be seen from witness statements to the police following a 
crime, or from the verbal accounts of crimes in courtroom interactions (Atkinson 
and Drew  1979 ). In fact, the system of cross-examination in court can elicit quite 
different accounts of the same event from the same witness, depending on the choice 
of words and line of questioning used (Drew  1985 ). In general, people try to design 
their versions of events to be relevant and understandable to the person they are talk-
ing to, and that person usually cooperates with them to understand what they are 
saying (Grice  1975 ). These two factors of  recipient design and  audience participa-
tion work together to shape the account or story that is told for any event. 
 Stories are further affected by the presence and participation of others who 
share the memory of the story subject. In fact, where two or more people share 
the memory, the story is often told collaboratively with input from each of them. 
A brief example of  collaborative storytelling is shown in Fig.  5.3 . This shows 
part of a joint account of the ﬁ lm ET, being generated by a group of undergradu-
ates who have just watched it (Edwards and Middleton  1986 ). Instances of this 
kind of talk are challenging for theories of human memory which overlook the 
role of other people in the process of remembering. They are cited as evidence for 
new theories of  collective remembering    which suggest that memory itself can be 
reconstructed and shaped through storytelling with others (Edwards et al.  1992 ; 
Edwards  1997 ). Eventually, people may come to believe more strongly in the 
stories they tell of an event than in the memory of the event itself (e.g. Tversky 
and Marsh  2000 ). They may also learn to recognise and participate in the  re-
telling of familiar family stories as a way of fostering group rapport and passing 
on family values. Norrick ( 1997 ) has called this  re - membering , because it 
involves the strengthening of family or group membership through the joint re-
telling shared stories.
 Only two published studies have attempted to look at these kinds of behaviours 
in the context of storytelling with photographs. One of these was mentioned in 
Chap.   6 in connection with recording voiceover on digital photos (Balabanovic 
et al.  2000 ). This study also included a 10–15 min period of face-to-face photo shar-
ing using a handheld photo viewer. Participants were found to move between a 
‘ photo-driven ’ and a ‘ story-driven ’ method of sharing photographs. Either the pho-
tographs themselves appeared to trigger the conversation or the conversation sug-
gested a story that might be illustrated with new photographs. This begins to place 
the style of talk somewhere  between a slide-show and ordinary conversation.

 The focus on photo selection in this study obscured analysis of the conversation 
itself, and lacked consideration of story prefacing,  second stories and  audience par-
ticipation . The use of pairs of participants also excluded the possibility of looking at 
 collaborative storytelling , in which two or more people tell a shared story to others. 
An earlier study of printed photo sharing between parents and young children, aged 
between 4 and 6, discovered some of these phenomena operating in photo-talk 
(Edwards and Middleton  1988 ). For example, parents acted to bring the children 
into a conversation about the past events represented in the photographs, increasing 
audience participation and encouraging collaborative storytelling. The main short-
coming of the study was the fact that the setting was not characteristic of ordinary 
photo sharing situations with a variety of adults and children of more equal status in 
the conversation. 
 In the next section, I describe a new study of photo-talk recorded in situations 
with just this kind of diversity. The aim of the study is to see whether the ﬁ ndings of 
studies on  conversational storytelling apply to photo-sharing conversations, or 
whether the latter are special in some sense, because of their dependence on photo-
graphs. This will reveal the extent to which the  slide-show model applies, in spite of 
known phenomena that cause speakers to mark and change their stories for the audi-
ence at hand, and listeners to collaborate, steer and respond to stories in various 
ways. The implications of the ﬁ ndings will then be used to target particular kinds of 
photo-talk that might be recorded as free voiceover for photographs. A follow-up 
study is then reported which elicits reaction to the use of this kind of talk in conver-
sational photographs.     
5.2  The Photo-Talk Study 
 Eleven families in Northern California were interviewed at home about their photo 
organisation and sharing practices (Frohlich et al.  2002 ). Each family owned a per-
sonal computer, and at least two of the following three digital photography prod-
ucts: a scanner, a digital camera, and a photo-quality printer. In addition, they used 
at least 10 rolls of conventional ﬁ lm a year. These criteria ensured that the

brackets ([) on consecutive lines are used to indicate overlapping speech

participants were involved in both analogue and digital photography and could 
answer questions on both subjects in the interviews. 
 At the end of the interviews, families were given photo diaries and audio tape 
recorders with which to record subsequent photo-sharing conversations. The diary 
comprised a simple table in which each row represented a single photo-sharing epi-
sode, and each column entry represented a piece of information about it. The infor-
mation was written in by hand, and included details such as when and where the 
episode took place, the name of the photo set, whether the photos were in loose or 
album form, the names of the other participants, and whether they were present at 
the time the photos were taken. Families were asked to ﬁ ll in one entry in the diary 
each time they got their photos out to share with someone, or each time someone else 
presented their photos to them. They were also asked to tape record these conversa-
tions if possible, with the permission of the other people involved. This procedure 
was followed by each family for a 3-month period over the Christmas of 1998. 
 Some basic properties of photo-talk are evident from the resulting diary data. 
This will be reviewed ﬁ rst before examining the details of the recorded conversa-
tions themselves. This approach is similar to that used in Frohlich et al. ( 1997 ), in 
which various quantitative aspects of a set of conversations are used to motivate the 
qualitative analysis of individual conversations. 
5.3  Background Features of Photo-Sharing Conversations 
 A total of 127 photo-sharing conversations were recorded in full in the photo dia-
ries. This amounts to about one conversation a week for each family. The majority 
of conversations involved collections of printed photographs, despite the fact that 
families were using digital photography products. This can be seen in Fig.  5.4 , 
which shows the proportion of different types of photographs shared. Most sessions 
involved either loose prints or prints in albums, with only seven recorded episodes 
of screen-based photo sharing. This suggests that participants may have been print-
ing out digital photos to share them face-to-face, in preference to sharing them on 
the PC or the camera itself.
 The form in which photographs are shared is likely to inﬂ uence the kind of con-
versation that takes place around them, since this will affect how many people can 
see individual images at the same time and who can take control of them at any 
point. Other contextual factors that may inﬂ uence the conversation include the loca-
tion in which the photos are shared and the number and type of participants. On 
these dimensions we found that 82 % of conversations took place in participants’ 
homes; usually in a kitchen, dining area or living room. The average number of 
participants present was four. These people tended to be family (40 %) or friends 
(50 %) rather than acquaintances (10 %). 
 A ﬁ nal feature of these conversations was recorded for its relevance to the dia-
mond framework in Fig.   1.2 and turned out to be a critical factor in the ensuing talk. 
Participants were asked to indicate in the diary, whether or not each partner in a 
photo-sharing conversation shared the memories represented in the photographs. 
5.3 Background Features of Photo-Sharing Conversations

104
This effectively determined whether the conversations involved reminiscing or sto-
rytelling. The ﬁ ndings are summarized in Fig.  5.5 . We found that the majority of 
conversations involved reminiscing between people who had all been present at the 
time the photographs were taken, while a sizable minority involved storytelling with 
people who had not been present at that time. An additional discovery was that a 
third set of conversations involved a mixture of reminiscing and storytelling because 
they included more than one person of each kind. Typically a couple sharing the 
memories of the photographs would show them to another couple.
 While this picture of photo-sharing may not be representative of the full spec-
trum of domestic photographic practices, it does resonate with what has been 
reported by other methods (e.g. Chalfen  1987 ). In the next section we go beyond 
both interview and diary self-reports of photo-sharing, to examine the content and 
dynamics of photo-talk from 80 conversations recorded on tape.

5.4  The Content and Dynamics of Photo-Talk 
 The character of the recorded conversations was dramatically affected by whether 
or not the participants shared the memory of the events depicted in the photographs. 
Essentially, stories of the photographs emerged only in the storytelling conversa-
tions, or in the joint storytelling-and-reminiscing conversations, between people 
who did not all share the memories represented by the photographs. Together these 
conversations made up 40 % of the total number of conversations recorded in the 
study (see again Fig.  5.5 ). In the remaining 60 % of reminiscing conversations, 
participants tended to make a series of short remarks and observations about the 
photographs. These were often directed towards ﬁ nding the memory together, only 
to leave it unelaborated once it had been discovered. 
 An example of this kind of reminiscing talk is shown in Fig.  5.6 . This conversation 
took place within a family of ﬁ ve who were looking over a new set of prints developed 
from an old roll of ﬁ lm. It was Christmas 1998 when the conversation was recorded. 
The main topic of the conversation was deciding when the photos were taken. Each 
member of the family chips in their own contribution to this topic, often in the form 
of questions, until the family as a whole arrives at an estimate of Christmas 1996. 
Many of these contributions are difﬁ cult to hear because they are made in overlap with 
an existing speaker (shown in square brackets). Although the question of ‘ When ?’ the 
photographs were taken is addressed by this talk, it is done so in a way that is both 
protracted and unclear. Furthermore, the participants did not go back to address other 
questions about individual photographs shown in the conversation: making it alto-
gether unsuitable as a form of voiceover on the photographs themselves.
 One reason why a range of questions are not addressed in reminiscing conversa-
tions is that the participants already know the answers to most of them. In fact, tell-
ing the story of a photograph to someone who was with you when you took it would 
be bizarre, unless they had forgotten the event altogether. Even in these cases, there 
is evidence that people are reticent to explain a photograph directly. This can be 
seen in Fig.  5.7 , which shows a fragment of conversation between two sisters, Jenny 
and Clare. They are looking at photographs of Jenny’s daughter’s birthday party at 
which they were both present. Jenny has forgotten  why she is shown making a 
phone call in one of the photographs. Instead of telling her, Clare feeds her clues 
about the event that cause Jenny to remember that she was phoning her daughter’s 
new pager. In this way, the two sisters arrive at the answer together. This kind of 
collaborative question-answering is typical of reminiscing conversations, but tends 
to stop short of collaborative story-telling itself. The instruction to “Remember” is 
used here as elsewhere to encourage others to ﬁ nd and rehearse their own version of 
events from memory rather than to listen to someone else’s version.
   In the absence of storytelling about the events depicted in photographs, reminisc-
ing talk tends to focus on individual questions of context, on the superﬁ cial appear-
ances of people and things in the photographs, or on the technical features of the 
photographs themselves. Question-answering has already been illustrated in 
Extracts 5.6 and 5.7. An example of commenting on appearances is shown in

Fig.  5.8 . Dan compliments Marjorie’s appearance in one of the photographs and 
Marjorie objects and ﬁ nally diverts attention to another photograph. This is a com-
mon response to compliments, but should not be taken to indicate that the compli-
ments are unwelcome (Pomerantz  1978 ). Other things people commented on included 
subjects taken from unusual angles, how people and things have changed, the expo-
sure, focus and composition of a photograph, and the camera equipment used. Again, 
these subjects are unlikely to make good voiceover clips for photographs. 
 More promising voiceover material can be seen in the storytelling conversations 
recorded in the study. These include conversations in which there is also an element 
of reminiscing (shown as ‘Both’ in Fig.  5.5 ). In these cases, some account of the 
activities taking place in the photographs is often given to those who were not pres-
ent at the time. However, as we shall see, these accounts were not presented rou-
tinely for each photograph as the slide show model of photo sharing might suggest. 
Instead, they were often triggered by audience interest in a particular photograph or 
by a turn in the ongoing conversation that made an account relevant at that point. As 
in storytelling without photographs, accounts or stories of photographs were often 
marked at their beginning and end, modiﬁ ed according to audience interest and 
participation, told collaboratively with others who did share the memory, and fol-
lowed at times by  second stories from the audience. The main difference between 
photo-talk and ordinary conversation seemed to be in the pace and focus of the talk. 
Photo-stories were embedded in a photo-turning activity that formed the focus of 
the conversation, and served to prime certain topics associated with each photo-
graph at a particular time and pace. It also meant that participants could pause qui-
etly for several seconds in the conversation to examine a photograph in mutual 
silence. To appreciate these characteristics, let us consider some further fragments 
of photo-talk.
 Figure  5.9 shows a typical photo-story being told by a wife to her husband. Tracy, 
the wife, had recently been on vacation with a friend, Annabelle, and was showing 
photographs of the trip to her husband Simon when she got back. In contrast to the 
symmetrical kind of reminiscing conversation shown in Fig.  5.6 , this conversation 
is led by Tracy with occasional contributions from Simon. Tracy marks out a photo-
graph of a tea room in Atlanta Springs as worthy of particular attention, by saying 
“This was an interesting thing” and asking Simon a question about the picture. This

5.4 The Content and Dynamics of Photo-Talk

serves as the preface to a story about the discovery of cups suspended in a tree and 
dishes (saucers) placed in the ground beneath it. The close of the story is prompted 
by Simon who asks for clariﬁ cation of the name of the place and, by implication, 
some further explanation of the strange decorations. Tracy doesn’t provide an expla-
nation but changes her earlier description of the tea room to a “dish garden”, under-
lining the strangeness of the experience. The joint laughter at the end of the story 
serves to mark its closure for both parties. In this way, the account exhibits many of 
the properties of storytelling in ordinary conversation, but happens to be triggered 
by a photograph of the place being spoken about.
   The fact that this story is tailored to Simon’s interests and intervention, can be 
seen in Fig.  5.10  where Tracy tells the same story to two other friends, Katie and 
Lyn. The story elements are similar but the telling is different. It is now more 
appropriate to the relationship Tracy has with her female friends. Hence, Tracy 
ﬁ rst picks up on the name of the tea room, the “Painted Lady”, to make a  joke 
about its  connection to herself and Annabelle. Katies’ humourous response and 
Lyn’s laughter indicate that they get the joke, allowing Tracy to continue with the 
account. This time the story is told in an extended turn which Katie and Lyn 
refrain from interrupting despite several pauses in the middle. Whereas Tracy’s 
description of the place as a “dish garden” was prompted by Simon’s question in 
the ﬁ rst telling, it has now become the punchline of the story as something she 
said to Annabelle at the time. In fact these words were most probably spoken to

109
Simon ﬁ rst, judging from Fig.  5.9 . These modiﬁ cations show that photo-talk is 
subject to  recipient design   in the same way that ordinary conversation is, and that 
this inﬂ uence may even lead people to modify story elements between tellings.
 In addition to the implicit role played by the  identity of the audience in the story-
telling, we observed a much more direct role through their active participation in the 
conversation. Some indication of this role can be seen in the contribution of Simon 
to the conversation shown in Fig.  5.9 . For example, Simon asked a series of ques-
tions that led to the framing and conclusion of the ﬁ rst story told by Tracy. A more 
dramatic illustration of  audience participation is shown in Fig.  5.11 . Here Emily and 
Jack were showing two visiting friends, Grace and Ted, pictures of an old vacation 
in New Zealand.
 The photo-talk in Fig.  5.11 was triggered by the fact that Grace and Ted were 
soon to visit New Zealand themselves, and were interested in learning more about 
the country from their hosts’ old photographs and experiences. At the beginning 
of the stretch of conversation shown, Emily and Jack are showing a photograph 
of a farmstead that contained a craft museum. As it turned out, this was near 
where Emily bought a spinning wheel, and both Emily and Jack begin to tell the 
story of the spinning wheel purchase until Grace interrupts with a question. The 
interruption is done in overlap with the  story preface   in which the spinning wheel 
is ﬁ rst mentioned. This serves to reject the story at that point in favour of obtain-
ing further information about a Ferry shown either in the farmstead picture or in 
another one close by. After a pause, Emily and Jack go on to answer the question 
together, and a series of related questions about the weather in that region. 
However they don’t give up on the spinning wheel story. A subsequent photo-
graph “back in queensland” is used to set-up the story preface for the second time, 
using an almost identical form of words. This time the visitors desist from inter-
ruption and the story follows. 
 Although  audience participation here only served to delay the onset of a photo- 
story from the storyteller’s point of view, it also elicited useful details of the geog-
raphy of New Zealand from the audience’s point of view. In the context of a pending 
 Fig. 5.10   A  re-telling of the same story as in Fig.  5.9 , to two female friends 
 
5.4 The Content and Dynamics of Photo-Talk

vacation to the country this information is likely to have been more interesting to 
Grace and Ted than the fact that Emily bought a spinning wheel there on a previous 
trip. This trade-off between the interests of the storytellers and the interests of the 
audience lies at the heart of this kind of photo-talk and was actively negotiated in 
the storytelling conversations we analysed. 
 Where there was more than one storyteller, this conﬂ ict of interest and perspec-
tive extended to the storytellers themselves. Two storytellers might want to draw out 
different lessons from the same experience or would simply remember different 
details of the same event. This led to exactly the kind of  collaborative storytelling 
observed by Edwards and Middleton ( 1986 ). 
 An example of this is shown in Fig.  5.12 . In a typical photo-sharing session, 
Natalie and Edward are showing their photos of a recent camping trip to their par-
ents, Jim and Delia. In this part of the conversation, Natalie and Edward are 
prompted by Delia to tell a story of their encounter with racoons. Natalie and 
Edward work together to relate the story from their own recollections, with Natalie 
uttering the  story preface “The ﬁ rst place we stopped was like a zoo”. Edward sub-
sequently takes up the story and resists an attempt by Natalie to take over half way 
through. Natalie completes the story with a more forceful ending than Edward’s “So 
we packed up and left”. She uses more dramatic language such as “just freaking 
along” to indicate the frantic state in which they left, and tie the ending back to her 
own story preface in which she likened the campsite to a zoo. This shows that photo- 
stories are not only inﬂ uenced by the audience, they are also inﬂ uenced by multiple 
storytellers who may collaborate to tell the story together.

redirected by the audience  
 
5 Conversational Photographs

111
 Another feature of the episode shown in Fig.  5.12 is that the story is triggered 
from a single photograph that does not seem to contain images of the racoons or 
skunks that the story is about. Delia’s original observation is about the campsite 
Natalie and Edward travelled to  after  they had escaped from the killer racoons! We 
found it was common for stories to spring off a single photograph in this way, often 
at the prompting of the audience and sometimes in a direction not illustrated by the 
photograph itself. 
 Another example of a story about something  not shown in the photographs is 
shown in Fig.  5.13 . In this conversation Dan and Mary are being shown photographs 
by their friends Nicola and Lenny, whose daughter is also present. Just prior to the 
clip shown, Dan asks if the photographs were taken with Nicola’s point and shoot 
camera. As it turns out, they were taken with another camera that was lost and then

112
surprisingly found and returned sometime later. Nicola tells this story with help 
from Lenny, and Dan responds with a  second story about a similar incident in which 
Mary’s purse was stolen and then discovered sometime later.
 Sometimes people did unfold a story with reference to a sequence of photos, 
but this was always at a pace and manner dictated more by the audience than the 
material. More often than not, the turning or passing of photographs within the 
group served to make relevant certain topics of conversation, and some of these 
would be developed into stories at the whim of the storytellers or the prompting of 
the audience. In between these developments, which have been picked out for 
illustration in Figs.  5.9 ,  5.10 ,  5.11 ,  5.12 , and  5.13 , there appeared to be a good deal 
of what might be called ‘ﬁ ller talk’ by storytellers such as that shown in Fig.  5.14 . 
This is taken from another portion of the conversation between Tracy and her hus-
band featured in Fig.  5.9 . Here phrases such as “an then this”, “here”, and “that 
was”, are used to mark the passage onto a new photograph and preface a simple 
voice label. Pauses are introduced between each photograph, at which point the 
audience gets a chance to make a comment or ask a question. In this exchange 
Simon remains silent apart from expressing an objection to Tracy’s assertion that 
the trees were changing colour.

5.5  Summary of Findings on Photo-Talk 
 In short, we have found in this study that photo-talk is composed of two quite dis-
tinct types of talk. Reminiscing talk was the most common type, and took place 
between people who shared the memory represented in the photographs being 
shown. It was characterised by equal participation in the conversation by all con-
cerned, a good deal of overlapping talk, and a reticence to elaborate the story-of- 
the-photo beyond identifying where and when it was taken. Storytelling talk was the 
other kind of talk, and took place between people who shared the memory of the 
photographs and those who didn’t. It was characterised by unequal participation in 
the conversation, little overlap, and a tendency for the photographer to develop the 
story behind  particular photographs in a set. The way in which such stories were 
told in these conversations, appeared to be similar to the way in which stories are 
told in other forms of conversation. Hence they involved opening and closing 
sequences, tailoring to the audience,  audience participation , collaboration, and even 
the telling of  second stories in response. The main difference between storytelling 
in photo-talk and ‘ordinary’ talk, appeared to be in the way the story was initiated 
out of a photo-turning activity that made certain kinds of information  topical . 
 Returning to the slideshow model of photo sharing we can say that these ﬁ ndings 
provide further evidence against it. Both kinds of photo-talk are highly interactive 
and inﬂ uenced by the participation of an audience. In fact, in reminiscing conversa-
tions, the contributions are so equal that it is not appropriate to distinguish between 
an audience and a presenter. These roles move between participants with each utter-
ance. Even in storytelling conversations where the presenter or presenters are deﬁ ned

shown in brackets between the lines  
 
5.5 Summary of Findings on Photo-Talk

114
by their knowledge of the photographs, the audience was found to prompt and direct 
the conversation by timely interventions and responses. Indeed, the presenter’s talk 
was interspersed with pauses to encourage this. The fact that most photo-sharing 
conversations were found to involve the handling of loose prints may also have con-
tributed to this effect, since it would have allowed the audience to look at images 
which were out of synch’ with the current narrative. Such dislocation of image and 
sound consumption may have created opportunities for redirecting the narrative to 
images not currently being talked about. While this would be frustrating in a slide 
show, it appeared to be the norm in the photo-sharing conversations we examined. 
 The implications of these ﬁ ndings for capturing conversational photographs are 
that only certain kinds of conversation are likely to be interesting enough to keep. In 
particular, only storytelling conversations appear to contain details that generalise 
beyond the conversational context itself and concern the story-of-the-photo in 
Berger’s sense ( 1982a ). The kind of reminiscing conversations shown in Figs.  5.6 , 
 5.7 , and  5.8 are unlikely to have long-term value as a form of voiceover on the cor-
responding photographs. Furthermore,  within storytelling conversations, it may 
only be the stories themselves that are required for capture and storage with the 
photographs. The intervening ﬁ ller talk and audience comments may be judged too 
boring or distracting to retain. 
 To test these hypotheses, we move onto a second study in which we gave people the 
chance to decide for themselves, which parts of a storytelling conversation they would 
like to keep with its associated photographs. This study is similar to those reported in 
earlier chapters, and involves the generation and review of audiophotos themselves.  
5.6  The Storytelling Photograph Study 
 In order to give people a chance to record their own conversational photographs 
from storytelling conversations, it was necessary to ﬁ nd a situation in which these 
conversations could be recorded in full for later review. The spontaneous conversa-
tions recorded in the previous study were tape recorded without reference to their 
associated photographs, and could not easily be followed-up. However, an unpub-
lished laboratory study of photo-sharing, carried out for other purposes, had 
recorded 14, 20 min sessions of storytelling conversations on video. This study was 
carried out with Nadja Linketscher and Maurizio Pilu. In this study, each photo-
graph had been scanned and captured in digital form, so that it could be shared on- 
screen across two rooms through a photo-conferencing application called  PicShare . 
An average of 30 photographs were shown and discussed in each session, at a rate 
of about one every 40 s. One of the values of this system is that it could easily sup-
port the capture of photo-sharing conversations. To explore this possibility, an addi-
tional follow-up exercise was carried out 12 months later on the recorded 
conversations. This was done in collaboration with Tony Clancy and allowed us to 
test reactions to recording storytelling photographs in general. 
 Ten pairs of work colleagues and four extended family groups were asked to 
review their photo-sharing sessions at home, by watching themselves on video. 
5 Conversational Photographs

115
Work colleagues were originally drawn from the HP Bristol site, while families 
were recruited from the local Bristol area. During this task they were given a printed 
contact sheet showing thumbnails of all the photographs shared, and asked to mark 
all photographs for which they would like to keep the corresponding conversation. 
In addition, they were asked to select a favourite conversational photograph from 
this set. Participants were then requested to complete a simple questionnaire describ-
ing their reasons for keeping the selected conversational photos, for  not keeping the 
others, and for choosing their favourite audiophoto. The questionnaire also prompted 
participants to vote on whether or not they believed the recorded conversation made 
the photographs more interesting, informative or enjoyable, and to indicate whether 
they would like to record conversation with photographs again. Most of the conver-
sations related to recent sets of photographs not seen by the photo-sharing partners 
in each pair or group. However, the interval between the original session and the 
follow-up research was about 1 year, and gave the conversations and photographs 
an older feel. This interval also made it difﬁ cult for us to track down all the original 
participants and encourage them to respond. Sixteen out of twenty-two individuals 
carried out the follow-up task and completed the questionnaire. Twelve people were 
members of the original pairs of subjects, while four belonged to one family group 
of two parents and two grandparents. 
 Despite the missing data, the responses from our 16 respondents contained a 
wide variety of opinions and experiences with the task, and furnished us with 
enough data to report a preliminary set of ﬁ ndings on the value of conversational 
photographs. This is done in the next section through an abbreviated form of analy-
sis used in previous chapters. Statistical data are reported ahead of a discussion of 
favourite audiophoto selections and comments on the value of conversational audio. 
However, the statistics refer more to the subjective judgements and votes cast on the 
medium, rather than to the properties of the conversational photo set, and there is no 
discussion of the practice surrounding the capture, editing and playback of conver-
sational photo material. We leave these details for a future full-scale trial, and con-
centrate on determining whether such a trial is justiﬁ ed from the data we have. 
5.7  Storytelling Photos Captured 
 It has already been mentioned that the mean duration of a conversational photograph 
in this study was about 40 s. The association between sound and image in this set was 
always one-to-one because of the way a single photograph was presented at nearly 
full-screen size for discussion at any time. In fact, the duration of an individual conver-
sational photograph was deﬁ ned by the duration for which the image was displayed at 
this scale. For the most part, participants tailored their conversation to correspond to 
the currently displayed photograph, and the speech stream could be segmented quite 
straightforwardly at image transitions. The exceptions to this rule usually occurred 
when authors began to introduce the next photograph ahead of the current one. In these 
cases the entire conversational recording window for any given photograph was dis-
placed to start a few seconds before the display of the photograph itself. 
5.7 Storytelling Photos Captured

116
 A key question for the study was whether or not participants would choose to keep 
 any of the conversation corresponding to particular photographs. We found that on 
average they opted to keep the conversation on about half of the photographs shared. 
In those cases they did not express a desire to edit the conversations. This begins to 
show that there was some perceived value to the storage of storytelling conversation 
around photographs, but that this did not apply to every single photograph. 
 Two other factors in the selection of conversational fragments and photographs, 
were the ownership of the photographs and the relationship between photo-sharing 
partners. The interaction between these two factors is illustrated in Fig.  5.15 . In 
general, people opted to keep important or forgotten details mentioned in their own 
talk on their own photographs, or revealing details on the photographs of close part-
ners. They tended to reject most or all conversation on photographs shared by casual 
acquaintances, as shown by the low percentage of photographs saved by this group 
in Fig.  5.15 . We deﬁ ned acquaintances as people who did not socialise with each 
other outside work. In contrast, acquaintances retained nearly as many of their own 
photographs as did friends. Within the family group, we found that people were 
more interested in saving conversation on each other’s photographs as shown in the 
ﬁ gure. In fact, the grandparents in this group opted not to keep any of their own 
conversation on their own photographs on the grounds that they would not have 
time to listen to conversation on their own photos in the future. This explains the 
very low proportion of own photos saved by family members in Fig.  5.15 .
 The overall ratings for the conversational photographs saved are shown in 
Fig.  5.16 below. These show that the addition of conversational audio to these pho-

tographs was considered to increase their interest, information value and enjoyment 
by the majority of participants. The biggest consensus was around the ‘informative’ 
dimension. When asked at the end of the exercise whether they would like to record 
conversation on photographs again, three quarters of participants said ‘Yes’. The 
remaining quarter were split equally between saying ‘No’ and ‘Don’t Know’. While 
the reasons for these votes are complex, their importance is clear. There are at least 
some circumstances in which saving the conversation around a photograph will be 
considered worth doing, and therefore worthy of further study and support.

5.8.1  Favourites 
 A number of favourite conversational photographs were selected because they con-
tained well-formed stories. These stories possessed the same kind of clarity and 
interest found in favourite talking photographs with voiceover. For example, 
Fig.  5.17 shows two people on a paraglider from the boat below. The conversation 
is led by one of the paragliders, Christine, who describes her feelings of terror as she 
took part in the ride. The story therefore provides an evaluation of the experience as 
well as a broader description of it, and was voted a favourite by Christine’s photo- 
sharing partner Viv. As Viv points out in her own words, this audiophoto was a 
favourite because:

 However, favourite conversational photos were not always chosen because they 
were complete stories. Often the talk was considered attractive because it triggered 
a memory in the author or had some other personal signiﬁ cance. For example, the 
photographs shown in Fig.  5.18 were chosen as favourites because they reminded 
the author, Amanda, of the changing appearance of the same lake on consecutive 
days of her holiday. The accompanying conversation isn’t so much a story as a 
description of the lake on both days with additional questions and observations by 
the audience, Jess.
 A similar conversational photo was selected by Dorothy in the study. She chose 
a picture of herself in a mountainous landscape, taken by her husband. Her own 
conversational comments described her memories of being surrounded by wild 
herbs such as sage, rosemary and thyme, which gave the place a wonderful smell. 
The conversation itself appeared to remind her of this smell:
 The conversation talked mainly about the sights/sounds/smells that went with the photo. 
This was deﬁ nitely a bonus that the photo does not capture (Dorothy) . 
  Other conversational photographs were chosen for their personal signiﬁ cance. 
These included a snapshot of Debbie outside a boutique in New York on her 40th 
birthday. This was chosen by her mother in the family group, not only because 
of the content of the conversation but also because of the association with that 
event:

 By hearing the conversation it helped me to feel I was sharing in that special day (Joy) . 
 Both factors appeared to be at work in Fig.  5.19 , which was the favourite audio-
photo of its author, Lyn. It shows the presentation of a birthday present at a friend’s 
party, and led Lyn to describe what was in the present bag shown. The event was 
signiﬁ cant in its own right and the chosen moment indicates the kind of relationship 
Lyn and her friends have with the birthday girl, Tracy. Listening to the conversation 
later, Lyn was also reminded of details of the event she had forgotten since the 
conversation:
 I’d forgotten Tracy kept asking ‘Do you want to know the time?’ and kept carrying the bag, 
until I heard the conversation (Lyn) .

5.8.2  The Value of Storytelling Conversations 
 The criteria used for the selection of favourite conversational photographs begin to 
indicate some of the values of storytelling conversation of this kind. To a large 
extent it appears to be similar to the value of voiceover on photographs, as identiﬁ ed 
in the previous chapter. Hence, when people were judging the value of conversation 
on  other people’s photographs they tended to appreciate talk that told the story-of- 
the-photograph and added interest to it, or which personalised the photograph with 
the speakers’ voice and opinion. However, there did not seem to be the same sense 
of intimacy in the conversational records as in the privately recorded voiceovers. 
Whereas voiceover appeared to convey the speaker’s inner thoughts and feelings, 
and sometimes communicate hidden messages to the recipient, conversation did 
not. In fact most of the reasons for keeping conversation with photographs were 
pragmatic rather than sentimental. This brings us to one major difference between 
the value of voiceover and the value of conversation. Conversation was often 
selected on people’s  own photographs  as a personal reminder of forgotten details of 
the memory. 
 The reminding value of one’s own storytelling activities was actually the most 
commonly mentioned. An example of this has already been given in Fig.  5.19 , 
which showed the handing over of a present at a party. Another example of the

canoeing. Meg’s excitement at this encounter is evident from the story she tells of it 
in the conversation, and is echoed in her comments about why she chose to keep it:
 I chose to keep this mostly because the moment was pretty cool (seeing a moose) and there 
was a good story behind it – some of which I had since forgotten about (Meg) . 
 The other values of interest and personalisation can be illustrated with reference 
to some of the conversational photographs selected by the family group. Their pho-
tographs were unusual in that they contained not only recent photographs taken by 
the younger ‘parents’ of the family, but also older photographs of one of the parents, 
Debbie, when she was about 6 years old. These were brought in by her parents, who 
we refer to as the ‘grandparents’ of the family. This set of photographs is interesting 
because it shows how different members of a family have different views of the 
value of each others’ photographs and conversation. 
 Regarding the recent photographs brought in by the parents, these were judged 
by the grandparents as much more attractive than their own photographs. Figure  5.21 
shows the grandmother’s favourite conversational photo of Debbie mentioned in the 
previous section. This contained a description of Debbie’s 40th birthday trip to Paris 
which served to connect her mother to the occasion. It was also valued by Debbie’s 
father, who was unfamiliar with Paris and was interested in the comments about it:
 The Parisian scenes and context was outside my experience and the images were enhanced 
by the commentary and the added information (Ron) .

 Regarding the older photographs brought in by the grandparents, these were 
judged differently by Debbie who formed the subject of the photos, than by Debbie’s 
husband Chris. Chris was intrigued by the commentary provided by his in-laws 
about his wife when she was 6. For example one of his favourite conversational 
photos was that shown in Fig.  5.22 of Debbie, her brother and two school friends. 
Debbie appears second from the left. Chris’ interest in these kinds of conversations 
is somewhat understated in the following quote:
 It was useful to identify the background to the photograph, i.e. when, where, who, etc. (Chris) 
 Debbie’s interest in her parents’ photographs of herself was perhaps the most 
complex of all. She appreciated the new information provided by her parents in 
conversation and also liked the fact that the photographs were personalised by the 
voices of her parents and husband. In addition, the photos and conversation worked 
together to trigger personal memories she had not had for years. These effects can 
be appreciated from the audiophoto in Fig.  5.23 , and her comments below:
 The most valuable part for me was the sharing of historic photos from my parents’ collec-
tion. I chose to keep the parts where my mum and dad were sharing pictures of me and 
answering my questions. It forms a good memory for the future. It is good to have a stored 
memory of mum and dad chatting and explaining their playful responses to Chris’ com-
ments….Memories of actually wearing the clothes came to me as I saw the photos (Debbie) .

 Some ﬁ nal comments from participants in the study suggested that there was also 
value in the original video record of the photo-sharing session. One participant pre-
ferred the entire video record to any selection of individual conversational photo-
graphs, and pointed out the different feel it had to conventional home video. Another 
liked the fact that the video happened to contain a split screen showing the face of 
the ‘sender’ or main speaker in the conversation. 
5.9  Summary of Findings on Storytelling Photographs 
 By giving people the opportunity to store their storytelling conversations around 
photographs, we have found that  some parts of the conversation were considered 
worthy of keeping because they enhanced the photographs. However, these parts did 
 not  always correspond to well-formed stories as predicted from the previous study. 
The selection of conversational segments was related more to the relationship par-
ticipants had to each other and to the photos at hand. 
 A key relationship factor was whether the photographs belonged to you or oth-
ers. This could be seen from Fig.  5.15 , which showed that acquaintances were 
more interested in keeping conversation on their own photographs than on other 
people’s photographs, whereas the reverse was true of family members. Friends 
were equally interested in keeping conversation on their own and their partner’s 
photographs. Another way of looking at these ﬁ ndings is to say that the value of 
keeping conversation on someone else’s photographs was related to the value of 
keeping the photographs themselves. Only very close friends or family were inter-
ested in doing this, perhaps because they had more shared history and context to 
maintain with each other. 
 The choice of which pieces of conversation to keep was dictated by the value 
they had for each group of people involved. Clear and well-formed stories were 
selected out of interest in other peoples’ photographs. Other remarks and conversa-
tional banter were selected for the way each type of talk personalised one’s own 
photographs and reminded the photographer of forgotten details. We also found that 
a mixture of these motives could be evident in individual selections, such as those 
made by Debbie in Fig.  5.23 . Debbie liked the banter on her parents’ pictures of her 
as a child, but also appreciated her parents stories on these pictures. In fact, Debbie 
was in the same position as the children in Edwards and Middleton’s ( 1988 ) study 
of parent–child photo-sharing. Although she was a subject of the photographs being 
shared, she did not fully share the memory of the original event. This gave the remi-
niscing talk a storytelling quality – which was further extended by the presence of 
her husband as an independent audience. 
 Despite the provisional nature of these data, the evidence for the value of conver-
sational photographs is clear enough to warrant further research. A future study 
might explore the use of such facilities in a trial setting, to examine again what 
conversation would be recorded but also to ﬁ nd out how such recordings would 
subsequently be used.

5.10  Discussion 
 We began this chapter with the observation that photographs live in an environment 
of conversation, and that some of this conversation could be captured in another 
kind of audiophoto. Two studies were then reported which looked at this environ-
ment and the prospects for recording it. 
 In the ﬁ rst study of photo-talk we found that all the features of  conversational 
storytelling reported in the literature were present around photographs, but only in 
40 % of photo-sharing conversations. These conversations were those in which pho-
tographers or the subjects of photographs shared the images with an audience who 
was not present at the time the photographs were taken. We referred to these as 
storytelling conversations in Fig.   1.2 , although the stories they contained were sub-
sequently found to be embedded in other kinds of talk involving questions, answers 
and general observations. A further 60 % of photo-sharing conversations took place 
exclusively between people who shared the memory of the events depicted in the 
photographs. We referred to these as reminiscing conversations in Fig.   1.2 , since 
they involved remembering the event together. Somewhat surprisingly we found 
that reminiscing talk did not involve direct descriptions of the events or memories 
represented by the photographs, but rather contained a collection of remarks, ques-
tions and judgements about the photos which were highly speciﬁ c to the partici-
pants own recollections. These conversations appeared to be unsuitable for saving, 
although further work might try to verify this conclusion. In contrast, storytelling 
conversations appeared to contain just the kind of details recorded in voiceovers, 
which had already proved to be useful for the interpretation of other people’s pho-
tographs (in Chap.   4 ). 
 In the second study we examined whether storytelling conversation might have 
the same properties as voiceover, and expected participants to select well-formed 
stories as a kind of free voiceover. While conversational stories were found to be of 
greatest interest on other people’s photos, other parts of the talk were valued on 
one’s own photographs. Other people’s voices and one’s own conversation was 
found to be useful for personalising the photographs and reminding the photogra-
phers of forgotten details. 
 These two uses of conversational photographs are summed up neatly in the open-
ing quote of the chapter, in relation to a wedding album. Conversation over the 
album might be used as a long-term reminder for the bride and groom, or as an 
interesting story for their children in the future. 
5.10.1  The Role of Conversation in Personal Image Review 
 The value of recorded conversation on personal photographs for enhancing memory 
was a surprising outcome of the study. It ﬂ ies in the face of the rejection of voiceover 
for this purpose in the audio-annotation study. 
5.10 Discussion

126
 One factor may be related to the methods used in the studies. The time interval 
between recording and listening to personal voiceovers (several weeks in Chap.   4 ) 
was much shorter than that involved in recording and listening to personal conversa-
tions (several months in this chapter). It is likely that  any spoken commentary on a 
photograph will become more useful as a reminder over time. 
 Another reason may relate to the expected practice of recording voiceover 
and conversation. Even if the value was perceived to be equivalent, participants 
may have rejected the idea of recording voiceover on their own photographs 
because of the effort and time involved. In contrast, participants may have rec-
ognised that recording photo-sharing conversation would take little extra effort. 
This may have led them to view it more positively as a form of indexing their 
own photographs. 
 However, a third explanation is particularly compelling. Participants in the 
audio-annotation trial were most reticent of recording voiceover when they could 
not imagine an appropriate audience. In fact the most difﬁ cult audience to record 
for was oneself, since participants already knew the story of their photographs 
and found it hard to anticipate what details they might forget. In conversation, 
the issue of identifying an audience disappears. The audience is physically pres-
ent, and from the analysis of photo-talk we know that speakers act with great 
skill to tailor their conversation accordingly. We also know that audiences them-
selves act to bring out new details and explanations from speakers. This process 
results not only in free voiceover for speakers, but  freely-tailored voiceover full 
of twists and surprises that speakers could not have anticipated themselves. In 
this sense the conversational recordings are also personalised, beyond the mere 
inclusion of other people’s voices. They reﬂ ect accounts that emerge with the 
audience, containing facts and details that speakers could not have deliberately 
recorded for themselves. Such account may work as better reminders of the 
events than voiceovers, whilst also reminding speakers of the people they shared 
their photographs with in the past. 
 The value of recorded conversation on other people’s photographs is more easily 
explained, especially in the light of the earlier ﬁ ndings on voiceover. Essentially, the 
stories in storytelling conversations work just like voiceovers for a remote audience. 
They add contextual details and interest that reveals more of the story-of-the- 
photograph. What is curious in the case of recorded conversation is that these details 
have already been heard live in conversation. The decision to record them must 
therefore be related to a desire not to forget them on subsequent reviews of the pho-
tographs. This presupposes that the audience expects to keep and review the photo-
graphs again and explains why their relationship to the photographer or subject is so 
important. If the relationship isn’t close enough to involve keeping the other per-
son’s photographs, then there is no need to remember their interpretation. This 
account also explains why recorded conversation lacks the intimacy and impact of 
voiceover heard for the ﬁ rst time. It suggests that the value of recorded conversation 
for an audience is ultimately linked to a second-hand use in memory, rather than a 
ﬁ rst-hand use in interpretation.

5.10.2  The Role of Conversation in Social Interaction 
 The activity of using recorded conversation in live conversation with photographs 
was not examined in the studies. However, this is unlikely to be valuable, given the 
strong negative effect of playing voiceovers in live conversations reported in Chap. 
 4 . The activity itself is somewhat bizarre and seems to stretch the reﬂ exive nature of 
photography too far. While there may be some circumstances in which people want 
to listen back to themselves or others talking about photographs, I have assumed 
that they would do this alone and without further conversation. To want to review a 
conversational photograph with someone else is certainly possible, but would need 
to involve an interest in the conversation itself rather than the photograph to which 
it related. A feasible scenario for this might be listening to photo-sharing conversa-
tions your ancestors had with their friends and family when they were young. Future 
work might address such interactions, but I predict that participants will ﬁ nd it dif-
ﬁ cult to talk over the recorded conversations, and will not want to further record the 
conversation on a  conversation .

 Paper Versus Screen Playback 
 You’ve got ﬂ exibility about who’s got what and where (Paul, 
audiocamera trial) 
 Our journey so far has taken us through the properties of different kinds of 
audiophoto content. PC-owning families have been encouraged to combine 
audio of various kinds with photographs in order to reﬂ ect on its potential value 
and use. This chapter changes direction somewhat, in order to connect these 
perceptions of content to the practicalities and technicalities of its capture and 
playback on different devices. In particular, it looks at the way various playback 
options affect the experience of reviewing audiophotographs. The interrelation-
ship between content and technology is one of the lessons from the history of 
new media development. All successful new media have involved innovation on 
both fronts, with content responding to and favouring particular forms of tech-
nology. This relationship is examined here by drawing together reactions from 
the same families to the playback of ambient, musical and talking photos on a 
range of different devices. 
 As noted in Chap.  1 , there are two main classes of devices for the playback of 
audiophotos. Screen-based devices, such as the PC, TV or PDA, already support the 
presentation of sounds and images and could be used quite easily to create and pres-
ent audiophoto albums. In addition, paper-based artefacts, such as the conventional 
photographic print, album, frame or card, might be augmented with audio using 
existing or new technology. These technologies support audio playback from paper, 
or  audioprints . Indeed, technologies for audio-enabled books have been around for 
some time, and have led to a number of commercial audioprint products for talking 
photo albums, frames and cards. 
 Both screen and paper forms of playback of the same material were presented to 
families in the audio-camera and audio-annotation studies. Their reactions and 
comments are reported in detail here. However, before launching into the methods 
and ﬁ ndings of this comparison, I brieﬂ y review insights from related work to guide 
our approach and analysis. 

130
6.1  Related Work 
 Two sets of prior research are relevant to the question of paper versus screen play-
back of audiophotos. The ﬁ rst set of work stems from the debate on the future of 
reading, while the second relates to the importance of tangibility in design. 
6.1.1  The Future of Reading 
 Insights on the use of information on paper and screen come from an extensive lit-
erature on the reading of ofﬁ ce documents. Developments in document scanning 
and management technologies in the 1980s led to an active debate about the pros-
pects for paperless ofﬁ ces. It was suggested in the business press of that time that 
these would be more efﬁ cient and environmentally friendly places, in which docu-
ments would be routinely authored or captured into the electronic realm, before 
being distributed, read and processed on-line. Although this prediction has not 
turned out to be true, it generated and good deal of research into the use of paper and 
screen-based documents and a clearer understanding of the value of each (Sellen 
and Harper  2002 ). 
 The locus of the debate has now moved to the future of the book, rather than the 
future of the ofﬁ ce (Nunberg  1996 ). This is because recent developments in comput-
ing and screen technology now make it possible to design lightweight reading devices 
for ‘ electronic books ’ ( e-books ). These might be used to carry large amounts of up-
to-date information in a form that can be annotated, linked and shared in new ways 
(Schilit et al.  1999 ). Because of the high cost of specialised e-book devices, they have 
been targeted at the professional reading market, and research has continued to focus 
primarily on ofﬁ ce documents and information. However, some of the insights from 
all this research may carry over to the use of domestic documents and photographs. 
 For example, it is not just the optical characteristics of a display that affect read-
ing on screen. Reading performance is also affected by text formatting, manipula-
tion and control factors (Dillon  1992 ). Another insight is that it is important to 
distinguish between different kinds of paper and screen experiences when making 
comparisons between them. The history of reading shows that reading (and writing) 
behaviours have changed with each development in paper technology (Manguel 
 1996 ). Hence reading from clay tablets and papyrus scrolls was very different to 
reading from a handwritten parchment codex or a bound textbook. In the modern 
age, similar differences exist between the reading of cards, posters, documents, bro-
chures, magazines, books and other forms of paper. Different kinds of screen expe-
rience result from reading the same content on screens of different sizes and 
resolutions; such as on a PC monitor, a TV and a handheld device. Furthermore, 
extensions and modiﬁ cations to the  content of screen-displayed information are also 
possible on screen-based devices. These include the addition of other media such as 
audio and video, and other structures such as hyperlinks – including links and com-
munication back to the original author. 
6 Paper Versus Screen Playback

131
 These possibilities are creating new forms of computer  literacy   which have only 
just begun to be recognised and studied (Bolter  1991 ; Snyder  1998 ). A ﬁ nal compli-
cation is that people have been found to read material differently, depending on 
what they are trying to do with it (Adler et al.  1998 ). For example, people will 
search speciﬁ cally for matching information when trying to make comparisons 
within or between texts. 
 Leaving aside differences in the  content and  purpose of paper and digital docu-
ments, a number of studies have begun to reveal important differences in the proper-
ties of paper and screen-based media. Thus, in an experimental comparison of 
reading the same technical document in order to summarise it, O’Hara and Sellen 
( 1997 ) identiﬁ ed a number of  affordances of paper that made it easier to use for this 
task than a computer screen. They deﬁ ne affordances, after Gibson ( 1979 ), as physi-
cal properties of paper which encourage certain kinds of interactive behaviours. 
These included:
•  Support for annotation while reading 
•  Ease of manipulation and navigation within a document 
•  Ability to spread out and compare information across pages 
 Subsequent work in more naturalistic settings has conﬁ rmed the importance of 
these  affordances of paper, especially for supporting the interweaving of reading 
and writing activities (Sellen and Harper  2002 ). At the same time it has also shown 
the value of the following affordances of screen-based material for carrying, ﬁ nding 
and exploring information:
•  Allows access to a large amount of material 
•  Supports full-text searching 
•  Quick links to related materials 
•  Content can be dynamically modiﬁ ed or updated 
 The fact that paper and screen media have such different  affordances for reading 
and writing behaviours leads people to move between them for different tasks. For 
example, the creation of documents tends to be done on-line, with paper in a sup-
porting role. In contrast, the review and discussion of documents tends to be done 
on paper (Figs. 3.2 and 3.3 in Sellen and Harper  2002 ). 
 In reality then, people do not opt for paper  or screen forms of reading as a gen-
eral preference, but move between them for different purposes. In a ﬁ nal twist to this 
conclusion, Luff and Heath ( 1992 ,  1997 ) have shown that this movement can take 
place at both macro and micro levels. Paper or screen documents may be consulted 
in different phases of work (macro level) or in the same phase concurrently (micro 
level). This latter activity involves the co-reading of screen and paper surfaces, and 
is common not only to conventional ofﬁ ces but to other complex workplaces such 
as trafﬁ c control centres, medical centres and call centres (Luff et al.  2000 ). In such 
settings, the  micro-portability    of paper becomes important as a resource for calling 
attention to information, orienting it to colleagues and bringing it into a conversa-
tion. In this respect, paper makes the information itself more tangible.   
6.1 Related Work

132
6.1.2  Tangibility in Design 
 The notion of tangible interaction with information has been promoted for some 
time as a desirable property of future personal computing. When computing is 
‘ubiquitous’ and resides in all manner of objects, furniture and architecture, people 
may be able to interact with it in more natural ways (Weiser  1991 ). This will not 
necessarily be through dedicated reading devices. For example, simply moving into 
a room might trigger the display of ambient sound, or moving an object on a desk 
might control the display of projected information (Ishii and Ullmer  1997 ). This 
approach to the design of future interfaces between people and computers attempts 
to augment the behaviour of ordinary objects and spaces, in contrast to simulating 
those objects and spaces within an enclosed computer world. For this reason it aims 
to create a kind of  augmented reality rather than a  virtual reality (Wellner et al. 
 1993 ). Considerable progress is now being made in this area, especially through the 
use of tags, sensors and wireless networks of information that can be triggered in ad 
hoc ways (e.g. Hawley et al.  1997 ; Want et al.  1999 ). 
 I mention these developments because they are part of a trend towards tangible 
computing. They show that the tangible nature of paper is now recognised as an 
advanced and desirable property of human computer interfaces in general. Such 
tangibility may give paper some functional advantages over screen-based devices, 
when it comes to reading, writing and sharing information. 
 Another reason for mentioning tangibility in design is that it may also confer 
some non-functional advantages over screen-based technology, especially in the 
photography domain. This is because people have a tendency to develop sentimen-
tal attachments to objects, both as personal possessions and as souvenirs. For exam-
ple, in a survey of cherished possessions, it was found that the  utility  of the possession 
was a relatively minor reason for the object being special (Csikszentmihalyi and 
Rochberg-Halton  1981 ). More common reasons were that the objects triggered 
 memories  or  associations with people or events, gave a certain  style  or  personality 
to the home, and provided enjoyable  experiences  or  qualitie s. Photographs in par-
ticular were valued for their memories, qualities and association with others. They 
turned out to be the most cherished objects cited by grandparents and the second 
most cherished objects cited by women of all ages. The association of objects and 
photographs with people was particularly strong. This has been noted in other con-
texts and cultures where objects become almost magically endowed with the per-
sonal characteristics of their owners (Hoskins  1998 ). In some cases these objects are 
considered to have power in their own right, while in others they are seen as merely 
signs or remembrances; as in the catholic and protestant views of the bread and wine 
used in Christian worship (Schaverien  1991 ). Schaverien goes on to show that 
images as well as objects can take on these kinds of meanings, even to the extent of 
serving as tangible talismans or charms. 
 Given the importance of tangible objects as both functional and non-functional 
things, it may not be so easy or desirable to replace them with digital copies. This 
can be seen from a recent study of digital music, which found that although users 
enjoyed the greater choice of music available in MP3 format, they still wanted to 
6 Paper Versus Screen Playback

133
purchase and handle it through a form of physical music packaging (Brown et al. 
 2001 ). In another context, it has been suggested that physical souvenirs might be 
brought into the digital world by taking a photograph of them and annotating the 
photographs with stories (Stevens et al.  2003 ). However, a photograph of a souvenir 
is unlikely to be as powerful as the object itself in evoking a connection to the past. 
A more promising approach might be to augment the souvenirs themselves with 
stories, so that the objects can continue to be handled in the usual way (Frohlich and 
Murphy  2000 ). Essentially the same argument has been applied to audiophotos 
(Frohlich et al.  2000 ) and is developed below. 
6.1.3  Application to Audiophotography 
 In short, although the idea of a paperless home has never received the same attention 
as a paperless ofﬁ ce, we can expect many of the same insights to apply. Rather than 
domestic paper documents and photographs being replaced by screen-based tech-
nology, it is more likely that they will continue to co-exist with it, perhaps in a modi-
ﬁ ed form. This is because the  affordances of paper and screens are different, and 
will continue to lead people to move between them for different purposes. The key 
question for digital photography is therefore not ‘Which is best, a printed or screen- 
displayed photograph?’ but rather:  ‘In what contexts will people prefer certain kinds 
of paper or screen-based experiences with photographs?’ 
 This question is also a key research issue for audiophotography. Because of the 
existence of talking book technology for augmenting physical paper with sound, it is 
possible to provide a paper alternative to the screen-based audiophoto. The audioprint 
alternative not only removes the need to use screen-based technology for this particular 
multimedia format, it also provides continuity with existing tangible methods of han-
dling photographs. As we have seen from previous work on tangibility, this may be an 
advantage both functionally and non-functionally. Functionally, it may easier or more 
ﬂ exible to handle, retrieve and share printed photographs than screen-based ones. 
Paper may also be a more accessible and reliable medium for archiving photographic 
images long term. Non-functionally, prints may be better for forming psychological 
attachments to photographs. Conversely it may be more difﬁ cult to form attachments 
to ephemeral screen images, or to believe that they will not vanish forever. Viewed 
from this perspective, we might ask an additional question to the one mentioned above, 
concerning movement from the status quo:  ‘What advantages must screen-based pho-
tographs offer for people to give up the tangibility and familiarity of prints?’  
6.1.4  Approach 
 Our approach to these questions is to layout a range of different paper and screen 
options for playback of the very same audiophoto content. These options were then 
experienced and discussed by participants in our two main studies of ambient sound,

music and talking photographs. Analysis then focuses on the contexts in which 
people report using or preferring certain playback options, and especially on the 
conditions for shifting to screen-based forms of playback. In exploring context, we 
refer again to the diamond framework in Fig.   1.2 . Because the playback experience 
in these studies was limited by the early technology for audioprints, we rely largely 
on the participants anticipated uses of audiophotos on paper and screen. This is a 
shortcoming of the focus group methodology itself. These studies should therefore 
be seen as precursors to more extensive ﬁ eld trials with fully integrated versions of 
each playback technology shown. 
 In the next two sections, we step through the ﬁ ndings of each study separately, 
before bringing them together in a ﬁ nal discussion 
6.2  Playback of Ambient Photographs 
 Photographs with ambient sound attachments were reviewed on paper and screen in 
the context of the audio-camera trial described in Chap.   2 . The overall methods used 
in the trial are described in that chapter. In this section we describe the review pro-
cedures in further detail. 
 The ﬁ rst stage of audiophoto review took place in home visits after four families 
had captured ambient sound photographs using an audio-camera unit on their sum-
mer holidays. Within these visits families jointly reviewed the total set of photos 
and sound clips captured. This was done ﬁ rst without sound from the prints alone, 
and then with sound played continuously from an  audio-cassette loaded into each 
families’ home hi-ﬁ  unit. This can be seen as a form of audioprint playback from 
paper, in which the prints and sounds are unsynchronised. After this experience the 
families selected about 10 favourite audiophotos for incorporation into a digital 
album that we later assembled for them. The original prints and cassette tapes were 
left with the families for them to show to others if they wanted to. 
 About 1 month later, families were invited in pairs to attend two separate 
‘Feedback Groups’ at HP Labs Bristol. Each group session started with a discussion 
of their overall reaction to audiophotos and their subsequent use of the prints and 
cassette tape. Their favourite audiophoto albums were then made available for them 
to show to each other in two forms:
•  PC album : Participants could click through a screen-based album on a multime-
dia PC, using a mouse to select on-screen navigation buttons. Albums were 
authored in a multimedia editing package called  StudioM from GoldWorks Inc. 
Sounds played only when the photographs were themselves selected by clicking 
on them. Simple audiophotos with a one-to-one association of sound and image 
were shown one screen at a time. More complex audiophotos with a single sound 
clip for several images were also shown on the same screen, but with individual 
images revealing themselves at the right time in the sound clip. It was suggested 
that material from the camera could be uploaded to the PC for this experience. 
6 Paper Versus Screen Playback

135
•  CD album : Participants could randomly access sound tracks from a hi-ﬁ  system 
using track numbers written on the back of each printed photograph. The hi-ﬁ  
unit was placed on a table next to a pack of loose prints. It was suggested that 
track-numbered prints might be provided with a corresponding audio CD from a 
photoﬁ nishing shop, or that the prints and CD could be made with a home PC 
and printer. 
 After each family had reviewed each others’ albums in these formats, two further 
options were presented for comparison:
•  TV album : The  PC album experience could be replicated on an interactive tele-
vision. It was suggested that the camera might be plugged into the television and 
used to control the on-screen album. 
•  Audioprint scanner : The printed photograph could have sound data on the 
back, in a form that could be scanned and played back from a handheld device. 
This capability was simulated using the prototype shown in Fig.  6.1 . A handheld 
box containing a speaker and a slot was plugged into a minidisc player. Four 
audioprint samples, one from each family, were prepared with corresponding 
audio tracks stored on minidisc. Automatic playback of sounds from the prints 
was demonstrated by inserting a print into the slot in the box, pressing ‘Play’ on 
the minidisc unit, and passing the print around the group. It was suggested that 
such prints could be made on a conventional printer.

6.2 Playback of Ambient Photographs

136
 Individual participants were then given forms containing all the above options, 
including the original audio cassette method experienced at home. They were then 
asked to place them in order of preference. The results of individual rankings of 
these options were discussed in relation to the handling of entire sets of audiopho-
tos. Two further options for sending or exhibiting individual audiophotos were pre-
sented for ﬁ nal discussion:
•  Audiophoto cards : A self-playing audiophoto could be created as a gift by cus-
tomising a recordable greeting card. Three commercial cards of this kind were 
passed around the group as examples of this. They contained photographs from 
different families in the trial with sounds that could be played by pressing a cor-
ner of the card. It was suggested that these could be made up manually by stick-
ing adhesive prints to a card base and recording the sound through a line in 
socket or an integral microphone. Alternatively they could be requested as a digi-
tal photoﬁ nishing service. 
•  Audiophoto frame   : A self-playing audiophoto could be displayed in an 
audio- enabled photo frame. In the absence of any commercial frames of this 
kind at the time of the study, a prototype was made as shown in Fig.  6.2 . This 
comprised a standard 6″ × 4″ picture frame with an analogue sound recording 
and playback unit stuck to the back. The sound could be started or stopped by 
pressing a button on the back of the sound unit. It was suggested that this 
could be made up  manually by inserting a printed photo into the frame and 
recording a corresponding sound through a line in socket or integral 
microphone.

6.3  Results for Playback of Ambient Photographs 
6.3.1  Overall Preferences 
 The results of the playback ranking exercise are shown in Fig.  6.3 . The average rank 
score is shown for each playback type. So higher preferences are shown by lower 
scores. Essentially, people preferred the two methods of review with the strongest 
association of sound and image; the  PC album   and the audioprint scanner. In both 
these cases the sound and image data are stored and invoked together, rather than kept 
separately and indexed to each other, as with the audio-cassette or the  CD album . 
These last two options were felt to be too difﬁ cult or restricting to handle in the con-
text of discussing and sharing photos face-to-face. The following comments were 
made about the audio-cassette method, but apply equally to the CD method. This is 
because in practice the CD was allowed to play through like an audio- cassette tape, 
without manual intervention from the users. It appears that in the heat of a photo-
sharing conversation it is not possible to control images and sounds separately:
 “It was too ﬁ ddly” (Mervyn) 
 “There’s no time to linger over the photos when you are listening to the sounds at the 
tape pace” (Philip) 
 “I wanted to control the pace (of the tape) and hold the photo myself” (Sue) 
 In the course of discussing the status of these preferences, it became clear that 
each individual was not voting for a single method of playback in order of prefer-
ence. In conversation afterwards, most people expressed a desire to use more than 
one method of playback depending on the context. Signiﬁ cantly for our analysis this 
often included a screen  and paper method. This can be seen from Fig.  6.4 which

shows the overlap of ﬁ rst and second choices made in the study. The participants 
were split broadly on whether they voted for a paper-based option or a screen-based 
option as their ﬁ rst choice. The undisputed paper option was the audioprint scanner 
while there was heated discussion between the advantages and disadvantages of the 
PC versus the TV (see below). However, when we look at the  second choices of 
each group we ﬁ nd that a subset select the alternative medium. Furthermore, paper 
is chosen by these people as a  complement to the screen option or vice versa.
6.3.2  Reactions to Devices 
 The reasons for the above preferences become clearer when we consider partici-
pants’ reactions to individual device options. Since the audio-cassette and CD 
options were quickly rejected by participants, discussion centred around the other 
main options of the PC, TV and audioprint scanner. We now step through discussion 
of these devices in turn. Reactions to the card and frame are also covered at the end 
of this section. 
 PC Album 
 The  PC album was liked and disliked for a number of reasons. The teenagers in the 
trial mentioned liking the PC itself, and associated it with playing games in an 
upstairs study or bedroom. The idea of presenting photographs and sounds on the

PC therefore ﬁ tted into this recreational pattern of use. The PC also turned out to be 
in an appropriate location for sharing audiophotos with their friends, who they 
tended to entertain upstairs.
 “I like computers. I can switch off and go and play games” (Julie) 
 “All you have to do is turn on the computer” (Thomas) 
 “It’s so easy to use, there’s an option to have sound or you can just ﬂ ick through” (Liz) 
 “I don’t take my friends to the lounge because that’s adult. With a computer in my bed-
room that would be a social place” (Anna). 
 The adults were more ambivalent. Their opinions split roughly along gender 
lines. The fathers in the study recognised the power of the PC for editing audiophoto 
material and creating albums. They found the demonstration album interface easy to 
use and enjoyed the professional look of various features such as the automatic 
transitions associated with multi-photo pages.
 “It looked impressive and you can trawl through them easily” (Chris) 
 “I’m starting with the editing and I’m thinking you’re going to have to sit at a PC and 
do that anyway so why not have it based around a PC and have it portable to other media?” 
(Paul) 
 In contrast, the mothers in the study disliked the PC itself, and considered it too 
‘technological’ a device for presenting photographs. They also argued that it was in 
the wrong place for sharing audiophotos with family and friends, since visitors 
tended to be entertained downstairs in the living room.
 “I just think the more technological it gets, the more it puts me off. I want something simple, 
I don’t want it complicated” (Sue) 
 “The PC is not for us. Its in a small room in our loft conversion” (Debbie) 
 “I don’t want to get away from prints” (Viv) 
 One of the objections to the  PC album was that it was not portable. This was seen 
as a disadvantage because it restricted audiophoto access to a particular room of the 
house and also prevented the sharing of audiophotos with others outside the home. 
Sharing with grandparents who did not have a PC was thought to be a particular 
problem in this respect. A number of suggestions were made by teenagers and 
fathers to overcome these objections. These included the use of a portable (laptop) 
computer for sharing audiophotos, storage onto ﬂ oppy disks or CD-ROMs, and 
printing the photographs without the sounds. In all these cases, the solutions were 
seen as supplementary to the presentation of audiophotos on a desktop PC, which 
was still seen by some participants as the best vehicle for showing material to a 
group of people. Again these ﬁ ndings imply a movement between different devices 
for different contexts of use. 
 TV Album 
 Many of the advantages of the PC were seen to apply also to the TV. Hence the large 
screen format for photographs and the high quality sound, were appreciated by 
those who valued such attributes on the PC. Additionally, the TV was sometimes 
6.3 Results for Playback of Ambient Photographs

140
seen as more suitable than the PC as a device for sharing photographs, because it 
encouraged a more relaxed and familiar style of interaction in a better location. 
Since the TV was considered equally at home in a bedroom or living area, this 
option appealed to both teens and adults who imagined using one in the most suit-
able location for them. The compatibility of storage format was also seen as an 
advantage. Because the study pre-dated the launch of DVD players in the UK, par-
ticipants assumed that the audiophoto albums would be stored on video-cassette 
which was seen as a pervasive medium. Interestingly, these participants expected 
the same level of control and interactivity with the video-album as with the PC-based 
album, and did  not want to view the album as a static slideshow.
 “You could have it just like a PC. You could just ﬂ ick through and have a special thing to 
put it through. I just thought it would be much better to have the video because more people 
have got a TV and video than have a PC – so that means you could show it to your friends” 
(Will) 
 “You would sit on comfy chairs, and if you were showing special occasion photos to 
friends you’d present them on TV in the lounge” (Debbie) 
 “TV is more sociable and people are used to it” (Viv) 
 The similarity of the TV and PC albums led some participants to propose an ideal 
solution involving both. This was either seen as a single integrated device or two 
separate devices with connectivity between them. The PC could then be used for 
editing and creating albums that could be moved to the TV for sharing.
 “I think ultimately if PCs are in every home and they are going to be Entertainment Centres 
in people’s lounges, then no problem” (Chris) 
 “Well if you have one of these predicted combined PC/home TV things then it would be 
an ideal combination wouldn’t it?” (Geoff) 
 “Well if you had an input that was for both PC and TV then you could do anything you 
like on the PC, if you’ve got one, and send it down the line on the internet or fax or what-
ever, or print and edit, and use the television in a social situation and send it to someone 
else with a TV. So you’ve got ﬂ exibility around who’s got what and where” (Paul) 
 Audioprint Scanner 
 The ability to print audiophotos and play them back in your hand was welcomed by 
all the women in the trial. They saw instantly that this would allow them to continue 
using printed photographs as usual but with the added bonus of associated sounds. 
They praised the ‘low tech’ feel of the device, the fact that there was little or no set-
 up required, and the beneﬁ t of preserving tangible prints. One of those beneﬁ ts was 
the longevity of paper as a storage medium. They simply didn’t trust digital forms 
of storage. Another beneﬁ t was portability. Printed photographs can be shown any-
where, and mothers wanted the same ﬂ exibility with audiophotographs.
 “Its small and mobile and the photos and sounds are together” (Christine) 
 “And you’ve still got prints” (Viv) 
 “I just want to show them casually where I am at the time… With this you could sit out 
in the garden” (Sue)

 “There is something nice about having that tangible print in your hand. In fact I'd feel 
very insecure if the images were just stored on the PC” (Debbie) 
 The use of physical prints also appeared to imply a more intimate form of sharing 
than displaying photographs on a large screen. For this reason it was seen as particu-
larly suitable for sharing audiophotos within the family, in reminiscing conversations.
 I imagine we would use it more than when we are showing photographs to other people 
(Christine) 
 A subset of men and teenagers also saw the audioprint scanner as a useful com-
plement to the PC or TV (see again Fig.  6.4 ). They also mentioned portability as an 
advantage over a ﬁ xed PC or TV, and even suggested that the scanner was more 
appropriate than a laptop, which seemed too ‘high tech’ for sharing audiophotos. 
This sentiment also appeared to extend to the  micro-portability of handling indi-
vidual photographs. This was reﬂ ected in a number of comments about the acces-
sibility of prints.
 “I don't want to show £5 worth of photos on a £2000 laptop” (Chris) 
 “It’s portable. You can bring it to other places” (Mervyn) 
 “I ﬂ ip through photos’cos they’ve got that feel to them. If you add equipment it feels like 
you are imprisoning the thing” (Geoff) 
 “You can go to the back one (with the scanner) without pressing the button all the time” 
(Thomas) 
 A number of concerns about the audioprint scanner emerged in this discussion. 
These included the ramiﬁ cations of sending audioprints to others, editing audio-
photo material, putting audioprints in albums, and getting better  sound quality   from 
a smaller device. Mothers in particular asked about sending material to others and 
realised that recipients would also need a scanner to playback the sounds. Although 
the cost of these devices was said to be low, this was still seen as a drawback to the 
solution. Fathers were concerned about editing material on the camera alone and 
struggled to understand if this could be done on the scanner. In fact, with this tech-
nology it could not. Some participants noticed that the scanner could not be used on 
photographs in albums where the printed sound data would be inaccessible. Several 
also objected to the size of the scanner itself and wondered if the external sound 
quality could be maintained in something more like an MP3 player. All these con-
cerns lowered the perceived value of the audioprint scanner somewhat, especially in 
the eyes of fathers and teenagers. This led them to ask for printing from the PC, 
where editing, sending and high quality playback could be achieved more easily. 
 Audiophoto Cards 
 The additional options of sending or exhibiting individual audiophotos in self- 
playing cards or frames were shown at the end of each session. The technology 
involved in both solutions was similar, comprising the storage of up to 20 s of sound 
on a voice chip attached to a miniature microphone and speaker. However, the 
6.3 Results for Playback of Ambient Photographs

142
packaging of this technology within a cheap cardboard greeting card designed for 
sending, or a solid wooden photo frame with a glass cover, led to quite different 
reactions from participants. In general, they loved the cards but hated the frame. 
 Initial reaction to the audiophoto cards was overwhelmingly positive, as people 
imagined themselves receiving cards from friends and family. They were seen as 
novel, fun and easy to use. Furthermore, participants recognised that there was no 
need for the receivers of cards to have additional playback technology, such as a 
special scanner. The fact that they were self-contained and self-playing was seen as 
their biggest strength. This train of thought led participants to consider how they 
would use the cards as senders, and generated a range of creative ideas. Special 
occasions such as graduations, the birth of a baby or a birthday were mentioned in 
this context, as well as postcards from holiday. One father in the trial noted that new 
sounds could be re-recorded over olds ones, so that you could re-use a birthday card. 
Another father thought of recording holiday postcards from home before 
departure.
 “That’s brilliant… You could send a photo of the kids to grandma with them singing ‘Happy 
birthday’ ” (Debbie) 
 “They’d be great for a special occasion” (Mervyn) 
 “You could say’Happy birthday’ and send something else from your holiday” (Thomas) 
 “You could get your mother to send her birthday card back!” (Geoff) 
 “It would be a lot easier than writing (postcards). You could record it before you go!” 
(Chris). 
 To make the cards more suitable for these uses, participants suggested several 
improvements. They wanted the cards to be slimmer and in postcard form. They 
asked for a longer duration of sound storage so that they could send a clip of ambi-
ent sound with a voice message appended. Others suggested the possibility of add-
ing multiple photographs. A ﬁ nal request was the ability to generate the cards from 
a PC, since the process of attaching digital photographs and sound clips from a 
camera was unclear. In short, the cards received considerable attention in the discus-
sion because they were seen to have so much potential for sharing audiophotos with 
remote family and friends. In contrast, discussion of the audiophoto frame was short 
and not so sweet. 
 Audiophoto Frame 
 Contrary to our expectations, there was an almost universal negative reaction to the 
audiophoto frame demonstration. In fact the most positive comments related to 
using it as a more long-lasting card that the recipients might want to keep. For 
example, one family thought of giving a framed audiophoto of their friend’s baby’s 
dedication to them as a present. The idea of keeping and displaying personal audio-
photos in this form just didn’t work for most of the participants. Whereas people 
were comfortable with the notion of glancing repeatedly at the same displayed pho-
tograph, they reacted against listening repeatedly to the same sound clip.

 “Oh my goodness, That is over the top” (Christine) 
 “It would sell very well in Bavaria or Russia. They go in for musical boxes there” 
(Geoff) 
 “I wouldn’t want to hear it over and over again” (Sue) 
 Although the audiophoto frame was not liked as a vehicle for displaying personal 
audiophotos, several people thought of commercial applications such as talking 
books, travel guides and holiday souvenirs. The most creative application was a 
kind of autographed audiophoto , explained enthusiastically as follows:
 Imagine if you were in a fan club and it was (a photo of) your favourite  pop  star… David 
Cassidy in my day… And it had a personal message. [’Hello Debbie I’ll always love 
you’(Chris)]. You could sell buckets. Fantastic! (Debbie) 
6.3.3  Summary 
 In short, we have found that it was rare for individuals to express a preference for a 
single paper or screen-based method of audiophoto playback. Most participants rec-
ognised that one solution did not ﬁ t all circumstances of use, and expressed a desire 
to move between solutions depending on circumstance. A common combination, at 
least for teenagers and men in the trial, was to use a PC to create audiophoto albums 
which could then be shown on the TV or printed out as audioprints. Women were 
more inclined to favour audioprints alone, but also expressed interest in sharing 
audiophotos on the TV. 
 Within each paper or screen-based playback category, participants were very 
sensitive to the form and type of option available. Not all options were considered 
equal, even when the very same core technology was involved. For example,  audio-
photo cards and frames elicited opposite reactions as a result of the very different 
packaging involved. The card packaging implied a model of purchasing and cre-
ation designed for sending audiophotos to others. This behaviour was valued by 
participants and judged to be well-supported by the technology. In contrast, the 
frame packaging suggested the long-term display of audiophoto material for one-
self. This was not valued so highly, and led to rejection of the technology. A similar 
thing happened with the perception of audioprints whose sounds could be played 
back from an audio CD or a handheld scanner. Although printed photographs were 
used in both cases to trigger the sounds, the  method of triggering was seen as simply 
more convenient with the handheld scanner and allowed greater freedom of move-
ment. The scanner also simpliﬁ ed the overall process of producing audioprints, 
since it cut out the necessity for a separate storage device (i.e. the CD itself). 
 The perception of screen-based options was also sensitive to the option type. 
Careful attention was paid to the different behavioural ramiﬁ cations of using the PC 
or the TV as an audiophoto player. Participants noted that they were located in dif-
ferent rooms in the house and that this would affect how easily they could show 
audiophotos to different groups of people. The distance from the TV and PC screen 
6.3 Results for Playback of Ambient Photographs

144
was thought to affect the tone of the playback experience, and the greater ﬂ exibility 
of the PC was felt to be more suitable for editing audiophoto material. Finally, the 
different storage formats of PCs and TVs and their ownership by others became an 
issue, as participants thought of taking audiophotos out of the house or sending 
them to others. All these ﬁ ndings show that participants judged each playback 
method on a very wide range of criteria. These included the set-up costs of using the 
equipment, constraints on the contexts of use, and compatibility with existing tech-
nology and behaviour – as well as the playback experience involved. 
6.4  Playback of Musical and Talking Photographs 
 A similar approach to that used in the audio-camera trial was used again to assess 
reaction to paper and screen–based methods of musical and talking photo playback. 
Participants in the audio-annotation trial were shown the same demonstration mate-
rial on a variety of paper and screen devices. All of these demonstrations were 
shown in the Feedback group sessions, after participants had reviewed and dis-
cussed their own musical and talking photo albums on a desktop PC (see again 
Chaps.   3 and   4 ). 
 As a result of the playback ﬁ ndings in the audio-camera trial, reported above, we 
modiﬁ ed the mix of paper and screen-based options used in the audio-annotation 
trial. The importance of portable screen-based options was acknowledged by the 
addition of a Tablet and a Palmtop device to the PC and TV. The success of self- 
playing audioprints and the involvement of album enthusiasts in the trial also led us 
to include an Audiophoto album option, alongside a handheld  Audioprint player 
and  Audiophoto card . Because of the lack of interest in the  Audiophoto frame , and 
the already large number of playback options, we decided to drop the frame from 
the list of paper options. This left us with four screen-based and three paper-based 
demonstrations as described below. 
 The screen-based options for audiophoto playback were shown as follows. In 
each case it was suggested that participants could associate music or record 
voiceover on the device itself, or via an editing process on a desktop PC.
•  PC album : Participants viewed each other’s musical and talking photo albums 
on a ﬂ at panel display with stereo speakers, placed on a circular café table. The 
interaction was controlled by using a mouse to select forward and back buttons 
which turned over virtual pages of the album (see Fig.   3.1 ). Sounds played auto-
matically on presentation of each page.  
•  TV album : Demonstration material was presented on a 21 inch TV screen with 
stereo speakers. The TV album was authored using HP Memories Disk software 
on a PC to burn a CD-ROM in video CD format. The CD was then played back 
from a DVD player connected to the TV, and controlled from a DVD remote 
control device. The album was played through in slideshow mode, but it was sug-
gested that pages might also be advanced manually, as with the  PC album .

145
•  Tablet album : A demonstration  PC album , also created in Macromedia Director, 
was shown on a 12” Fujitsu 512 Tablet PC. Photographs were shown nearly full- 
screen at an absolute size of about ﬁ ve inches by seven inches. Participants con-
trolled the turning of screen pages by tapping on screen-displayed buttons with a 
pen stylus. Again, sound played automatically on presentation of each page. 
•  Palmtop album : A lightweight version of the  Tablet album with more com-
pressed image and sound ﬁ les was created using the HP Pocket PC camera soft-
ware running on an HP Jornada PDA. This software already supports audiophoto 
capture and playback; automatically associating sound and image ﬁ les with the 
same ﬁ lenames. Photographs were shown full-screen at a size of about two 
inches by three inches. They could be controlled using forward and backward 
movements of a rocker switch on the casing, with sounds playing automatically 
for each new page. 
 The paper-based options for audiophoto playback were shown in the following 
way:
•  Audioprint album : An audio-enabled photograph album from Brookstone Gifts 
was ﬁ lled with demonstration content from the trial. This product supported the 
association and playback of a 20 s sound clip for each double page spread, from 
numbered buttons beneath the pages (see Fig.  6.5 ). The demonstration album 
was created by placing individual six inch by four inch photographic prints on 
self-adhesive pages and recording the ﬁ rst 10 s of their associated music or 
voiceover tracks in memory. Participants could then browse the album, pressing 
the appropriate buttons for each page at will. It was suggested that participants 
could create their own albums manually.
•  Audioprint player : A new improved audioprint player prototype was built in 
response to feedback on the previous prototype and the results of a separate tech-
nical investigation. The second version was based on the use of solid-state storage 
in the paper itself to hold the audio data associated with the photograph. Hence a 
voice chip from ISD measuring 5 mm square and just 1 mm thick was mounted 
on a substrate and embedded in each print sample. Each chip stored up to 30 s of 
high quality sound. The sound could be played back in real-time via contact with 
the handheld player shown in Fig.  6.6 . Three audioprint samples were created for 
demonstration in the Feedback session. It was suggested that individual audio-
photos could be printed on an adapted HP printer loaded with ‘audiopaper’.
•  Audiophoto card : A two-page opening card similar to that used in the previous 
trial was demonstrated in the Feedback groups. It was suggested that participants 
could create their own cards manually. 
 After seeing these demonstrations, participants were asked to indicate on a form, 
which device they would like to use to playback musical or talking photographs. 
They were allowed to tick more than one option for each type of audiophoto, in 
recognition of the fact that multiple options were requested by individuals in the 
previous study. Forms were then collected as a basis for discussing selections. The 
resulting votes and comments will now be described.

6.5.1  Overall Preferences 
 The preferences for different kinds of playback methods are shown in Fig.  6.7 . This 
time, preferences are expressed in terms of the number of votes for each method. 
Each of the 11 participants was allowed to vote for as many methods as they thought 
they would use. Votes were cast separately for the playback of music and talking 
photographs.
 This graph is a dramatic illustration of the fact that no single playback method 
was preferred over others. The PC and TV options came out top overall, but a large 
number of people also indicated wanting to use the palmtop, album, card and print 
methods. The least favoured method was the tablet, although even here, four out of 
11 individuals said they would be interested in using it. A further ﬁ nding, not shown 
in the table, was that each participant selected an average of 2 screen methods and 
1 paper method of playback. Again there was no single dominant playback method, 
even within the preferences of individual participants. 
 One pattern that is evident in Fig.  6.7 is the divergence of playback preferences 
by content type. Some playback methods received more votes for musical rather 
than talking photographs or vice versa. The PC and TV were seen as more suitable 
for playback of musical photographs, while the handheld devices and paper meth-
ods were seen as more suitable for talking photographs. The reasons for this pat-
tern and the selection of multiple methods of playback, can be seen from the 
discussion of preferences that followed the voting activity. It is to this discussion 
that we now turn.

6.5.2  Reactions to Devices 
 As before, there was more discussion of favoured than non-favoured options for 
playback, with comments focusing more on the positive than the negative aspects of 
each device. However, no device in this study was ruled out as a potential method of 
playback, unlike the audio-cassette and  CD album in the previous study. There was 
also more openness to playback of audiophotos on the PC and other screen-based 
options, particularly by women in the sample. This may have been because the 
study was carried out in 2003; several years later than the audio-camera trial. 
Participating families were therefore more familiar with computers and the sharing 
of photographs via the PC and internet, even if they did not necessary own a digital 
camera themselves. Hence we begin with comments on the PC as an audiophoto 
viewer, and go on to consider all the other screen and paper-based methods of play-
back in turn. 
 PC Album 
 The PC was seen as a good way of storing, editing and sharing audiophotos privately 
within the family, and as a method of sending audiophotos to other people. It was 
seen as less suitable than the TV for showing audiophotos to extended family and 
friends. This was partly because the interaction was said to become cramped with 
more than about 2 people, and because the location of the TV was more appropriate 
to entertaining guests (see below). PC and TV contrasts of this kind were common in 
the discussions and the idea of networking one to the other emerged again as a way 
of getting the ‘best of both worlds’. One elderly member of the group pointed out that 
the PC screen was difﬁ cult to read from compared to the TV, but on the whole the 
consensus was that both devices delivered a high quality audio-visual experience.
 “I would get a reasonable sized display with the quality and resolution but I’m very biased 
I think” (Harry) 
 “Well my PC screen is bigger than your TV screen so its ﬁ ne for showing photos” 
(Vicky) 
 It was the storage, editing and communication capabilities of the PC that really 
differentiated it from the TV. People could imagine editing audiophoto material 
much more easily on the PC, and sending audiophotos to others via email or the 
web. They also saw the PC as a possible place to archive photographic material. 
These kinds of uses were cited as often as sharing audiophotos on voting forms, 
which also asked participants to write down when they would use each playback 
method selected. Some typical written comments were as follows:
 “As a record or to send to family or friends” (Traci) 
 “Sending or placing on the internet” (Rob) 
 “Editing photos and manipulation” (Gordon) 
 “Personal use only” (Rachel) 
6 Paper Versus Screen Playback

 TV Album 
 The TV was seen primarily as a way of showing audiophotos to groups of family 
and friends. This was cited as the most common context of use on the voting forms. 
The viewing distance from the TV, seating comfort, and the public location of the 
TV were all said to contribute to its suitability for group sharing. Some typical com-
ments from the discussions were as follows.
 “Its more relaxed I think sitting around like this than sat on a computer chair…I just ﬁ nd it 
more relaxing to sit and watch a TV than a PC” (Rachel) 
 “For me the TV is something where a group of people can share it and there’s no prob-
lem. With the PC once you get more than two people it tends to get a bit crowded” (Jane) 
 Other reasons for using a  TV album included greater familiarity with watching 
TV rather than using a PC, especially by visiting parents or grandparents. This rea-
son carried over into a debate about how to send audiophotos to distant relations 
who did not have a PC. Although the possibility of sending video-cassette tapes was 
mentioned here, participants were more inclined to send augmented prints of one 
kind or another (see paper options below). 
 Tablet Album 
 Only a small number of participants voted for the tablet as a playback device, and 
most comments made in discussion were negative. For example, it was considered 
too heavy and bulky to hold or carry for long, and too difﬁ cult to share with others 
because of its restricted angle of viewing. Essentially, only about two people could 
comfortably look at its surface at any one time. On top of this the  sound quality was 
thought to be poor compared with the PC and TV.
 “You’ve got an angle problem” (Harry) 
 “You’ve got to get it at the right angle as well otherwise you can’t see anything. Sounds 
awful as well” (Rachel) 
 “Its unrecognisable” (Gordon) 
 In spite of these sentiments, several people mentioned its potential for showing 
audiophotos in a business context. Jane worked in an Art and Design Department of a 
university and thought that the tablet would be useful for carrying around a multimedia 
portfolio. Bryon suggested using it as a selling tool, and began to imagine new kinds 
of audiophoto adverts that might be created for this purpose. These comments show 
that certain devices are associated with certain contexts of use, and that both these fac-
tors affect the kind of content that might be created and shown in them. Unfortunately 
here, the work-related contexts of use associated with the tablet device appear to be 
similar to those of a laptop and worked against its use with domestic audiophoto-
graphs. A similar effect was encountered in the audio-camera trial when discussing the 
merits of sharing audiophotos on a laptop computer. Like the laptop, a tablet was felt 
to be a form of technology overkill for the casual showing of photographs.

 Palmtop Album 
 In contrast to the tablet, the palmtop received a large number of votes and much 
more positive comments. Its main advantage appeared to be its extreme portability, 
which made it suitable for showing audiophotos out of the home. This was cited as 
the main context for use on the voting forms in connection with visiting friends, 
going on trips and carrying it around to use in unplanned conversations. These fac-
tors were reiterated in later discussions. Somewhat surprisingly, the strongest advo-
cate of the palmtop was Betty, a grandmother in the trial. She preferred it to more 
familiar paper-based solutions because it held a great number of photographs but 
ﬁ tted in her handbag.
 “I like the idea of that, that you can take it around anywhere if you were visiting somebody 
you could take it there to show them” (Betty) 
 “Well that is one for the grandmothers to put all the photos of the grandchildren in, 
similar to the things they carry around now to the WI (Womens’ Institute) or wherever they 
gather” (Jane). 
 Although the viewing angle and  sound quality  problems were mentioned again 
for the palmtop album, participants seemed more willing to tolerate them for the 
convenience of showing audiophotos wherever they happened to be. Two conces-
sions they did make to these problems were to mention one-to-one sharing with 
individuals rather than groups of people, and to favour the showing of talking rather 
than musical photographs. In fact twice as many people voted for the palmtop album 
as a method of playing back talking photographs compared to musical ones (see 
again Fig.  6.7 ). 
 Audioprint Album 
 In contrast to the palmtop, the self-playing audioprint album was seen as too large 
to carry around. It was therefore considered to be a piece of technology for archiving 
and sharing audiophotos in the home. Its two perceived uses both related to ‘special’ 
photographs. Participants saw themselves using it as a showcase for archiving and 
sharing memories of an important event or trip. Alternatively they considered it suit-
able for creating as a gift to send to family and friends abroad. Given these occa-
sional uses, participants required much higher quality sound capture and reproduction 
to match the high quality of printed images. This was revealed in complaints about 
the short duration and poor quality of music and voice clips in the demonstration 
album. Like other print-based methods of playback, the album was seen as more 
suitable for voice commentary than music. In this case the commentary was felt to 
go particularly well with the personalisation of a special set of photographs, as 
shown in the following quote.
 I think the album would be nice with the sound to send to people who live a long way away 
who you don’t ever see. So you could do the pesonalised message that went with it. I’m

thinking about years ago when my mum’s brother lived in South Africa and we used to sit 
at home and make tapes that we sent him with all the news, which wasn’t just about news, 
but family voices. (Jane) 
 A number of participants were concerned about the potential cost of an audio- 
enabled album compared to what they usually spend on a conventional one. This led 
two people to suggest a re-usable album player, similar to the audioprint player, 
which could be used with any album. Albums themselves would have to have some 
kind of removable storage medium associated with them that could be inserted into 
the player when required.
 “Could you put something different in there to record on, like a tape or CD, for different 
albums?…What I mean is, if you’ve got a lot of albums, if you had something like that which 
would slot into the album, you could put a different recording into each album to suit” 
(Byron) 
 “You’d have to make it so that the photo album wasn’t disposable, i.e. you can take the 
photos out and put a new photo in and play it” (Vicky) 
  Audioprint Player 
 Whereas the audioprint album was seen as a device for special audiophotos, the 
audioprint player was seen as a device for playing back routine audiophotos. This 
distinction roughly echoes that between loose prints and albums today, where 
albums are reserved for a subset of the best prints (Frohlich et al.  2002 ). Hence, 
participants spoke about using the player to browse through printed audiophotos 
themselves, and also to annotate regular prints with voice messages for sending to 
others. This accounts for the increased number of votes for voice rather than music 
playback in Fig.  6.7 . The issue of recipients of audioprints needing a player to play-
back the comments emerged again in this study. However, participants here resolved 
it by limiting the use of sending to very regular or routine recipients who could be 
provided with a player with the initial set of audioprints.
 I could buy the attachment and send it too, if I was going to send a lot of photos. And the 
kids could record their voices and photos or whatever and I would just have to mail the 
photos off. And they can just plug them in and listen, or just look at the photos if they don’t 
want to listen (Vicky) 
  Audiophoto Card 
 Audiophoto cards received the same pattern of votes as the audioprint player (see 
again Fig.  6.7 ). However, they were judged more similar to the audioprint album in 
their potential use. They were associated with the sending of special audiophoto-
graphs to distant family and friends on occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries 
6.5 Results for Playback of Musical and Talking Photographs

152
and other causes of celebration. In fact they were treated as extension of conven-
tional greeting cards, which could be used to hold personal audiophoto material 
instead of a pre-designed message and graphic. Participants appreciated this ﬂ exi-
bility, not only for sharing photographs more effectively, but also for designing new 
kinds of communication on these special occasions.
 I would certainly be willing to make a card on some speciﬁ c special occasion. I guess that 
is taking a picture from the camera, printing it out and making a recording, whether that’s 
music or voice (Jane) 
6.5.3  Summary 
 Findings on the playback of musical and talking photographs were essentially simi-
lar to those on the playback of ambient photographs. No single playback method 
was preferred above others and participants expressed a desire to use different 
methods for different purposes. In fact, because of the change of methodology for 
measuring preferences, we were able to determine that each individual wanted to 
use about three different playback methods. On average two of these were screen- 
based methods while one was paper-based. In this study, movement between 
options was more a matter of context than personality, since there were fewer idio-
syncratic choices or age and gender differences. Common contextual factors affect-
ing playback selection were the type and size of the audience for audiophotos, 
whether they were being shown in or out of the home, and whether the audiophotos 
were routine or special in some sense. Mention of this latter dimension was a new 
development, and appeared to be signiﬁ cant for the choice of screen or paper meth-
ods of playback. 
 Routine audiophotos were associated mainly with screen-based playback. 
Participants expressed a desire to review their own audiophotos together on the PC, 
or to show them to visitors on the TV. They also favoured use of a Palmtop device 
for showing routine audiophotos out of the house. This trend extended to the regular 
sending of audiophotos to distant family and friends through the PC. The only 
exception to this rule was mentioned in the case of sending audiophotos to people 
without computers. Participants seemed to favour using audioprints with duplicate 
sets of audioprint players distributed across households. 
 In contrast, special audiophotos were usually associated with paper-based play-
back. Hence, the audioprint album was seen as a vehicle for archiving precious sets 
of audiophotos for personal use, or for sending to others as a gift.  Audiophoto cards 
were seen as a more disposable kind of photographic communication to others on 
special occasions. This trend appears to mirror a recent decline in the number of 
digital photographs being printed at home. Consumers are becoming more comfort-
able about reviewing photographs on-screen and more selective about which photo-
graphs they decide to print out.  
6 Paper Versus Screen Playback

6.6  Discussion 
 Having remained neutral about the technology involved in audiophotography in pre-
vious chapters, this chapter has been devoted to its examination for audiophoto play-
back. A key issue to resolve was the relative value of paper versus screen-based 
methods of playback, since unlike video clips, audiophotos could technically be 
played back from a variety of audioprint devices. Previous research on the future of 
reading and tangibility in design suggested that both paper and screen methods of 
playback might be preferred for different reasons, although the usefulness and famil-
iarity of photographic prints might inhibit a move away from the paper medium. 
 In fact we found that participants were impressed by the screen-based audio-
photo albums they were shown in each study, and indicated their willingness to use 
them for playback in a variety of contexts. The PC, TV and Palmtop albums were 
found to be most appealing, because of a number of features they possessed which 
paper prints did not. These can be seen as comparable to the  affordances of 
 screen- based documents observed by Sellen and Harper ( 2002 ) and listed in the 
introduction to this chapter. For audiophoto review, screens were valued for the fol-
lowing affordances:
•  Compact access to a large amount of material 
•  Content editing 
•  High quality audio-visual experience 
•  Viewing comfort 
•  Efﬁ cient transmission of material 
 These screen properties overlap with those of Sellen and Harper, particularly 
through the inclusion of editing and access to large amounts of material. The latter 
property was probably the main attribute underlying the attraction of the Palmtop as 
a portable method of playback. However, other properties in their list were not men-
tioned as important in the domestic audiophoto context, such as full-text searching 
or links to related materials. Instead, other properties were important, such as audio- 
visual quality, comfort and transmission. All these factors lead us to an answer to 
the question of  ‘What advantages screen-based photographs must offer for people 
to give up prints?’ They must begin to create a more comfortable and compelling 
viewing (and listening) experience than can be achieved on paper, with associated 
gains in the efﬁ ciency of storage, editing and transmission of material. 
 This shift towards screen-based methods of playback by no means eradicated the 
desire for printed audiophotos, but it did mitigate their use. Essentially audioprint 
methods of playback came to be reserved largely for the review and sharing of 
 special audiophotos. In particular, the audioprint album and cards were seen as 
good ways of packaging selected audiophotos for special occasions and sending 
them as personalised gifts to other people. Audioprints used with a handheld player 
were considered for more routine use, alone or with a small number of family mem-
bers. These methods possessed a number of properties in common that made them 
6.6 Discussion

superior to screens for these purposes. These can be seen as  affordances   of paper 
that are relevant to audiophoto playback.
•  Ease of manipulation and navigation 
•  Ability to spread out and compare information 
•  Longevity of archiving 
•  Lowest common denominator for sharing 
•  Tangible form 
 Again there is overlap with the  affordances   of paper important to the ofﬁ ce set-
ting, mainly through the continued relevance of manipulation and the ability to 
spread out more than one image at a time. However, the ability to write on prints or 
other paper whilst reviewing photographs was not relevant. Instead, it was more 
important to know that recipients had a way of playing and seeing what they had 
been given, that the material was not going to become obsolete over time, and that 
it had a tangible form that could count as a gift. Other beneﬁ ts of tangibility may 
well emerge in practical use, since differences in the dynamics of screen and paper 
conversations are not immediately apparent in a focus group setting. 
 In short, we have found that the lesson of the paperless ofﬁ ce debate also applies 
to the debate about the future of digital photographs in the home. Domestic photo-
graphs like ofﬁ ce documents will not go completely paperless because the proper-
ties of paper remain valuable for particular contexts of use. This value is increased 
in the case of audioprints where ambient, musical and spoken sounds can be invoked 
from the paper to enhance memory and communication around it. Screen-based 
photographs and sounds extend these values, when contexts of use change. This 
leads us to predict the co-existence of paper and screen-based methods of audio-
photo playback in and out of the home. 
 Exactly which methods are appropriate to which contexts is complicated to 
explain from the data, but some answer is demanded from our other research ques-
tion about context switching:  ‘In what contexts will people prefer certain kinds of 
paper or screen-based experiences with photographs?’ Using the contexts of use 
identiﬁ ed in the diamond framework of Fig.   1.2 , I have attempted to summarise the 
ﬁ ndings for each context in Table  6.1 . This shows the playback methods considered 
most suitable for each context, across the two studies. An entry in a cell refers to the 
kind of photo sharing that was thought to be appropriate to that particular method 
and playback context. Empty cells simply reﬂ ect the lack of any comments on the 
appropriateness of the method and context combination.
 Rather than describing these playback choices again for each context, it is worth 
noting some of the factors that led participants to change their choices within each 
column of the table. For example, we found that the  location of the activity affected 
playback selection especially in social settings. The PC and TV were preferred for 
sharing audiophotos in the home, while the palmtop or audioprint scanner were 
preferred for sharing out of the home.  Audio quality was another factor affecting 
choice of playback method in several contexts. In general, higher quality was 
required for music playback and for public sharing of audiophotos, and this favoured 
the PC and TV methods whenever possible. The  existing infrastructure  was also an 
6 Paper Versus Screen Playback

155
issue in the selection of methods in the ‘Interpretation’ column of the Table  6.1 . This 
led some participants to choose self-contained paper-based methods of playback 
like the audioprint card or album when sending material to other people. Finally, the 
 effort of creating or transmitting material was considered when thinking about the 
overhead of using each method. This worked against some of the paper- based meth-
ods such as the audioprint album. 
 These factors reveal more than the use of a wide variety of criteria for playback 
selection. They show a certain kind of systems thinking by participants, who judged 
each method in terms of its overall process of use as well as by the playback experi-
ence it delivered. This view is consistent with a way of thinking about media as 
socio-technical systems of production and consumption rather than simple, techno-
logical means of presentation. 
 Hesse ( 1996 ) develops this argument in relation to the future of the book, by 
contrasting the printing press (technology) with the modern literary system of 
supporting authorship and readership around ﬁ xed writings (system). The real 
challenge of new technology, according to Hesse, is not in providing new tech-
nical methods of reading books, but in changing the relationships between 
author and reader so as to transform the system of book publishing. In the same 
way, the real challenge of audiophoto technology is not  only in providing new 
ways of reading photographs, but  also in changing the relationship between 
photographers, subjects and audiences so as to transform the system of domestic 
photography. 
 Participants in these studies appeared to recognise this instinctively for the sys-
tem of photography represented by the diamond framework. Some presentation 
methods appeared to priviledge or disadvantage certain actors or activities in the 
system, compared with others. This led people to optimise the system for particular 
uses, by switching technical methods. This results in a kind of  domestication of 
technology, by selecting and adapting its properties to existing social practices.

 Research and Development in HP 
 With some simpliﬁ cation, we can divide the inquiry into two 
main categories: user oriented and technology oriented. Both 
are equally important! Without a strong grounding in potential 
users’ desires and needs, it is unlikely that any new idea will 
gain traction. But at the same time, an invention may be ever so 
desirable, but if it is not actually within the possibilities of 
existing or future technology, it will simply never be realised 
Holmquist ( 2012 , p. 39) 
7.1  Introduction 
 The historical and company context of the original audiophoto work, very much 
inﬂ uenced what happened next within HP. And what happened next, unfolded both 
as an impact on HP products but also on the ongoing research work carried out by 
other research scientists in the Labs and Divisions. I review these different impacts 
in the following two Sects.  7.2 and  7.3 . 
 One recurrent difﬁ culty in conducting this analysis has been framing the origi-
nal audiophotography research and vision, and following its evolution over time. 
Scientists, designers and inventors naturally want to know what happened to their 
ideas and tend to adopt an egocentric point of view. This is reinforced by compa-
nies who want to track and manage the year-on-year performance of research 
staff. However, most innovation contexts are populated by multiple people with 
the same innovation remit. And people routinely inﬂ uence each other and work in 
teams to develop their ideas. This means that it becomes harder and harder to track 
the inﬂ uence of particular ideas and research as time goes on, and as those ideas 
take hold within the culture of the research group and larger company. Individual 
insight and one-way inﬂ uence soon turn to mutual inﬂ uence and joint develop-
ment, as more people get involved and the research ideas drift from their original 
context. This is actually one of the biggest discoveries of the exercise and some-
thing we will return to in the discussion. But ﬁ rst let us trace the uptake of the 
early collaborative audiophotography work in HP, as described in Frohlich ( 2004 ), 
as best we can.  

160
7.2  Inﬂ uence on HP Development 
 The commercialization of audiophotos started some time ahead of the 2004 
Audiophotography book, as reported in a recent paper (Frohlich and Sarvas  2011 ). 
The ﬁ rst audiophoto product from HP was an application for the Pocket PC camera 
attachment for the  Jornada Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) in 1999 (see Fig.  7.1 ). 
It supported the annotation of captured images with a short voice message. The 
audio was saved in WAV format and given the same ﬁ lename as the image ﬁ le. The 
device was targeted at mobile professionals such as surveyors, journalists, estate 
agents and salespeople, so adding voice labels to photographs was considered use-
ful in supporting their work. Interestingly this was not a hypothesis that came out of 
the audiophoto research, which was focused on mainstream domestic photography 
by families. But the interpretation and transfer of the idea in this context came about 
through a colleague, Guy Adams. Guy happened to be working on a  Pocket PC 
camera attachment for the Jornada with Chee-Keat Fong at HP Singapore where the 
Jornada was made. The transfer of audiophoto support was easy because the Jornada 
device already had sound capture built into it, for recording voice memos and con-
siderable processing capacity for supporting novel applications. In this respect, it 
anticipated the smartphone platforms of today, which make very good devices for 
capturing audiophotos as we shall see later in the book. The audiophoto ‘app’ later 
transferred from the Jornada to the iPaq around 2001 when HP bought Compaq and 
rationalized its production of mobile devices.
 Although we had argued for the creation of a specialized ‘audiocamera’ in the HP 
range, the company decided to introduce sound capture on all its cameras in 2002. 
This was heralded a year earlier by its introduction in the HP Photosmart 650 camera 
which was a high end digital SLR, likely to be used for professional as well as ama-
teur use (see Fig.  7.2a ). A particular feature of the sound design was the use of an 
audiophoto ‘mode’ which, when on, activated sound recording on half- depression of 
the shutter button and continued recording as the shutter was fully depressed and

held down after the image-capture click. This allowed users to frame the capture of 
a sound window around the image capture event, as recommended by our research. 
However this was considered to be too complex for incorporation in the compact 
camera line in 2002 (see Fig.  7.2b ). It was dropped in favour of a modeless point-
shoot-and-hold action, where users simply held down the shutter button after the 
click to record sound until the shutter button was released. The resulting sound clip 
(WAV ﬁ le) was then stored inside the corresponding JPEG image ﬁ le. The audiopho-
tos could be played from the back of these cameras or transferred to a computer, and 
onward to the internet and other computers. Unfortunately for the uptake of audio-
photography, embedded sound playback from JPEG images was not universally sup-
ported by all image viewers of the day, nor even by HP’s own photo website. This 
meant that audiophotographs could not be easily shared with non-HP camera own-
ers. Even more unfortunately, HP pulled out of camera manufacture in 2007.
 A ﬁ nal audiophoto product was HP’s 2004 software for sharing and authoring 
photo slideshows in Video CD format on a CD-ROM. This was called HP Memories 
Disc and conventionally allowed users to set the slideshow to music (see Fig.  7.3 ). 
A later version worked with the import of embedded sound-photos from HP cam-
eras and mixed the ambient sounds with the music backing at playback time. A 
version of this software was eventually taken into a common image management 
application called HP Image Zone used across all HPs imaging products. Such mix-
ing of different kinds of sounds with single or multiple photographs was a strong 
recommendation of the audiophoto work and featured at the end of the 2004 
Audiophotography book. Some aspects of this recommendation were incorporated 
into a new ﬁ le format for CDs and DVD being developed by the Optical Storage 
Technology Association called MPV (derived from MultiPhotoVideo or 
MusicPhotoVideo). However MPV now seems to be an inactive format due to the 
rise of downloadable rather than physical media.
 More recent products from HP continue to support elements of the audiophotog-
raphy vision, especially those including augmented paper. However these become

more difﬁ cult to trace back to the early audiophoto work as time goes on, because 
of the inﬂ uence of further related research projects both inside and outside HP. For 
this reason, we turn now to review the subsequent internal research before describ-
ing HPs very latest product innovations in this area as part of the Discussion 
section. 
7.3  Inﬂ uence on HP Research 
 In addition to these commercial activities, many of the core ideas and technologies 
related to audiophotography appeared to inﬂ uence other people and research proj-
ects in HP Labs. Again, the inﬂ uence of the work reported in the 2004 book, was felt 
earlier inside HP because most of the ﬁ ndings were available 4 years earlier from 
the year 2000. The following summary is essentially a snapshot of the way ideas 
inﬂ uence other ideas, especially in the vibrant creative culture of HP’s research 
centres. It should be remembered that the audiophoto work had involved about 10 
other members of staff directly, each of whom had their own research agendas and 
projects going on in parallel. Regular seminars, meetings, trips and demonstrations 
also served to expose the work to many more staff, especially in the Bristol and Palo 
Alto Labs. Consequently, the ideas became part of the collective ‘zeitgeist’ of the 
Labs and appeared to stimulate or inﬂ uence a number of other projects.

 Perhaps the biggest internal consequence of the work was the setting up of a 
team of engineers led by John Waters and Ed McDonnell to create a tiny wireless 
chip that could be embedded in paper, with sufﬁ cient memory to store an audio clip 
and perhaps other data. This derived directly from our audioprint demo of 1999 and 
several related patents (Adams et al.  1998 ,  1999a ,  b ; Frohlich and Hickey  1999 ; 
Frohlich et al.  2000 ). HP announced the successful development of the resulting 
chip, called  HP Memory Spot , 4 years later in July 2006 (see Fig.  7.4 ). The chip is 
the size of a grain of rice, holds between 256 k and 4 MB of data, and could cost as 
little as 10–50 cents. It can also transfer the data to any reading device such as a 
smart phone at up to 10 megabits per second, via a proprietary wireless link. Despite 
the promise of the chip for audioprint and other applications, HP have yet to com-
mercialise it; illustrating the many factors needed to take a new technology to mar-
ket and the time this takes.
 Six other augmented paper projects also sprung up in the early 2000s. Four of 
these were part of my own continuing work in the area, as crystalised in an ongoing 
project called TANGENT: tangible media interaction. Following our audioprint 
demonstration in 1999, Guy Adams and I took the simple step of taking the same 
audiochip we used in the photographic print and embedding it in a paperclip instead. 
In fact we had to design a new kind of  Audiopaperclip with the clip at one end and 
an electronic tab connected to the embedded chip at the other. Then we designed a 
handheld and desktop audiopaperclip player to playback the sound (see Fig.  7.5 ). 
The players had both play and record settings so that new messages or sound record-

book, and ( d ) a hospital wristband (Reprinted with permission)

ings could replace or extend old ones. We imagined that such clips could come in 
different colours for different kinds or durations of sound, and that they could be 
recorded and attached manually to printed photograph albums. Alternatively the 
player could be built into an album with wired contacts around each page (Adams 
and Frohlich  2002 – patent application). As with HP Memory Spot, the audiopaper-
clip concept opened up new applications outside photography, and was probably 
best suited to exchanging voice messages with ofﬁ ce documents. This use was dem-
onstrated in the UK Design Council’s  Great Expectations exhibition of October 
2001 in Grand Central Station New York, and featured as one of ten Best of British 
designs of the year (Carlowe  2001 – Focus Magazine).
 Having separated the audiochip from paper and embedded it in a paperclip, it 
was only a small additional step to consider embedding it in other objects. Physical 
memorabilia and souvenirs were an obvious target, since they stood to gain many of 
the same beneﬁ ts of sound as photographs. In some ways, memorabilia act like 
photographs as memory triggers, and can be seen to extend domestic photography 
as a form of reminiscing (Frohlich and Fennell  2007 ). A variety of new product 
concepts in this area were envisioned through personal collaborations with Rachel 
Murphy and Jacqueline Fennel around 2000–2003, both of whom were hired by HP 
from the Computer Related Design course at the Royal College of Art. 
 The earliest concept was a Memory Box, inspired by a woman’s jewellery box 
and the layers of history that can accrue on precious objects that outlive a human 
lifetime (Frohlich and Murphy  2000 ). The box was designed to support the capture 
and playback of spoken stories on objects, which we suggested would be tagged 
with RFID stickers to identify them. As owners placed a new object in the box for 
the ﬁ rst time they would be given the chance to record the story, which would be 
played back automatically as the object was removed (see Fig.  7.6 ). A mock-up of 
this idea was shown to 11 US families for feedback and discussion, leading to fur-
ther concepts and design ideas. For example, women liked the idea in its current 
form, but children wanted a version that worked for their secret collections of things 
stored in other containers and drawers. There was also a call for audio-annotation of 
larger objects such as furniture, and a mobile solution to allocated household pos-
sessions in a talking will.
 The augmentation of memorabilia represented by the Memory Box work proved 
so promising that we looked for opportunities to extend it. This materialized in 2002

through an inclusive design project sponsored by HP Labs Bristol but run by the 
Helen Hamlyn Research Centre at the Royal College of Art. This was a managed 
form of open innovation as discussed above, but is described here because of its’ 
funding by HP. Jacqueline Fennel carried out the project on ‘Multisensory memora-
bilia’ which aimed to explore how partially sighted people remember the past with-
out the usual recourse to photographs (Fennell and Frohlich  2005 ). In partnership 
with ﬁ ve reference users who were registered blind, Jacqueline worked up a variety 
of ten novel product concepts for remembering the past in new ways. Interestingly, 
many partially sighted people go gradually blind through age or disease, so an 
emerging requirement was for a way of bringing existing photos back to life through 
touch. This was explored in two concepts for tactile photographs. However, the 
closest concepts to audiophotography were those featuring the novel use of audio. 
These included a  History Answering Machine for keeping conversations and offer-
ing them for playback on their birthday each year, a  Memory Shelf for creating a 
database of talking objects recognized by their weight,  Best China for recording 
memorable conversations around the dinner table, and  Hospital Armband Chatter 
for recording conversations around the hospital bed. Memory Shelf and Best China 
were created as full working demonstrators for exhibition and feedback, and are 
shown in Fig.  7.7 .
 My fourth augmented paper project, was a collaboration with John Robinson and 
Enrico Costanza at York University and the photographer Tony Clancy from 
University of Central Lancashire. We co-designed and built an  Audiophoto Desk for 
playing back sounds from printed photographs thrown onto a desk surface (Frohlich 
et al.  2004 ). The desk used an overhead camera to recognize the prints and fetch 
associated sounds from a hidden PC, and was exhibited at the Royal College of Art 
 Fig. 7.6   The memory box 
 
7.3 Inﬂ uence on HP Research

166
in the autumn of 2004 (see Fig.  7.8 ). An interesting property of the desk was its 
ability to playback multiple audiphotos simultaneously, and to allow the physical 
control of their volume and stereo panning by pushing them backwards or forwards 
and left or right. This led Tony Clancy to explore the creation of small sets of audio-
photos with different kinds of sounds and images that worked well as an ‘ensem-
ble’. The vision for a commercial version of this was as a domestic desk lamp with 
wireless connection back to a home PC. The photographic part of a stored audio-
photo could be printed out in the usual way, but its associated sound could be played 
back under the lamp.
 A related audioprint exhibition called  Walk in the Wired Woods  was hosted in the 
Labs itself 2 years earlier, as an outgrowth of the Mobile Bristol project. This was 
exploring the notion of ubiquitous media that could be triggered anywhere in both 
indoor and outdoor environments by location sensors. The resulting ‘mediascapes’ 
could be authored by artists and content developers to create walking tours, situated 
plays, mixed reality games and gallery experiences (e.g. Stenton et al.  2007 ). An early 
experiment was to playback sounds on an iPaq handheld computer relating to large 
printed posters suspended from the ceiling, using overhead ultrasonic microphones to 
identify its indoor location. A photographer and sound artist collaborated to make the 
audiophoto content of woodland scenes and sounds (Hull and Reid  2003 ). 
 A ﬁ nal audioprint technology was developed by a combined Bristol and Palo 
Alto group of scientists and engineers. This was called  Active Photos and involved 
the association of text, audio, image and video data with different regions of a 
printed photograph (Kindberg et al.  2004 ). This was done by placing the photo on a 
passive digitizer tablet and marking up the photo with a stylus to either associate or 
playback content for speciﬁ c regions. The associated content was played back on 
either an integral iPaq screen in the tablet or on a nearby computer.

 In addition to the interest in augmented paper and objects around the Labs at this 
time, there was equal interest in supporting new kinds of screen-based experiences 
with photographs and other personal media. This included various kinds of story-
telling with images. For example, a small group in Bristol had created a wearable 
camera and were experimenting with the processing of large amounts of personal 
video data, akin to Microsoft’s work on  SenseCam and  MyLifeBits (Gemmel et al. 
 2002 ,  2004 ). One immediate ﬁ nding was that much of the video taken passively on 
a wearable camera is shaky and difﬁ cult to watch without feeling sick. However, it 
can be used to extract so called ‘trophy shots’ (still image frames) and candid audio 
clips around them. Furthermore, video can be generated from individual or multiple 
images in a series to tell short stories, as in a documentary ﬁ lm. My own collabora-
tion with Dave Grosvenor from this group resulted in numerous patent applications 
for  audiophoto storytelling and annotation , including one for panning over still 
images during an ongoing narration (Grosvenor et al.  2002 ). 
 Other members of the same Bristol group, including Guy Adams and Andy 
Hunter, were working on new CMOS camera hardware and software, and creating 
a ﬂ exible camera testbed (or ‘breadboard’) for exploring new functionalities. In fact 
this was used to create a reference design for a programmable CMOS camera 
docked to a PC. Discussions about adding sound capture to this camera resulted in

the design and implementation of  Blink in 2001: the Labs ﬁ rst digital audiocamera 
with a separate sound capture button for the left index ﬁ nger (see Fig.  7.9a ). This 
had been a key recommendation for capturing sound on a camera following the 
audiocamera trial of 1996/1997, to allow separate sound and image capture from 
different buttons. This allowed memories to be captured by sound or image alone, 
but also by ﬂ exible combinations including the holding down of the sound capture 
button while one or more photos were taken. Blink supported this ﬂ exibility, and 
displayed the resulting sound, image, audiophoto and audio-slideshow media in an 
interactive webpage. While we never got to trial the new audiocamera with mem-
bers of the public, it was popular for its creative potential, and explored artistically 
by Tony Clancy in a number of audiophoto works. It also triggered an envisionment 
for a new audiocamera product, by Jim Gerard, an HP industrial designer on sab-
batical in the Bristol Labs. The proposed audiocamera form is based around the 
circular shape of speaker, but was never commercialized by HP (see Fig.  7.9b ).
 An additional design exploration of audiophotography products was commis-
sioned by HP Labs as part of a collaboration with the Computer Related Design 
Department at the Royal College of Art. Bill Gaver and Heather Martin were briefed 
in 1999 to explore the space of products in this area, by creating a workbook of 
related concepts. The results of this work were subsequently presented back to HP 
and documented in a conference paper (Martin and Gaver  2000 ). A range of new 
domestic product concepts were developed and linked to a broader investigation 
(Gaver and Martin  2000 ). This culminated in two new audiophoto prototypes shown 
at the RCA in November 1999. One was an  Evesdropping Camera , whose audio-
photographs could be triggered in response to loud sounds such as laughter. The 
other was a  Digital Shelf , along which barcoded photographic prints could be moved 
to play different sounds along the shelf. Alternatively it was suggested that a small 
postcard-sized display could be moved along the shelf to ﬂ ip through digital 
 audiophotos stored in the shelf. Although these concepts were never commercial-
ized by HP, they served to illustrate the potential of the approach for new forms of 
creative expression and communication.

 Several years later and further aﬁ eld in Palo Alto and Cambridge Massachusetts, 
colleagues were thinking about how to generate and retrieve audiophotos automati-
cally. Hence in Palo Alto, Margaret Fleck created a system for ‘ evesdropping on 
storytelling’ in which all conversations around a photograph were captured, as in 
the notion of conversational photographs in my original book. However, she took 
this further by doing automatic speech-to-text translation on the recorded speech 
(Fleck  2004 ). The resulting text could then be used as keyword tags for later retrieval 
and browsing. In Cambridge, Beth Logan and colleagues had developed a search 
engine called  SpeechBot for ﬁ nding speech, video and music from the web (van 
Thong et al.  2002 ). After Beth heard about audiophotos as a new media type, we 
ﬁ led a joint patent for retrieving and browsing audiophotos from their associated 
audio alone (Logan and Frohlich  2004 ). Both inventions suggest new ways of 
reviewing photographs based on the stories told about them or the similarity of 
music and ambient sounds associated with them. 
 A ﬁ nal group of colleagues in Palo Alto were beginning to research the future of 
photography on cameraphones rather than cameras, in anticipation of the revolution 
to come. Central to their vision was the notion of multimedia storytelling based on 
the circulation of personal media and conversation in a social network (Debaty et al 
 2004 ; Rajani and Vorbau  2004 ). Talking photographs were therefore a natural ﬁ t to 
this vision and something they explored in two systems with very different starting 
points.  MemoryNet Viewer was essentially a photo sharing web service (like Flickr) 
supporting both text and voice annotation of photographs. Interestingly this was 
intended to display the media of networked ‘friends’ in a continuous slideshow on 
a situated display. Other friends could comment on individual photos and see or 
hear the comments of others. Most spoken comments were provided in co-located 
storytelling around the displays, while most textual comments were provided alone 
for remote circulation. To encourage the recording of spoken comments for remote 
audiences, the team created another system called  StoryMail . This was essentially a 
voicemail system accessible from a cameraphone that allowed users to record and 
share voicemails augmented with photographs or video clips. This was later released 
as an HP product called  StoryCast  in 2005, as reported by Red Herring magazine. 
Again the integration of audiophoto recording and sharing in another context, both 
ampliﬁ ed and changed the original idea. 
7.4  Discussion 
 The range and variety of subsequent audiophoto projects in HP following the origi-
nal work, is testimony to the attraction of the idea within the company. But how 
much do these projects tell us about the uptake of innovation within large corpora-
tions and the prospects for widespread industry support of audiophotography itself? 
It turns out that the company focus of this analysis and chapter tells us more about 
innovation than audiophotography as such, because the company perspective is 
always to maximise the impact of research on products and therefore the return on

research investment. The company inclination with any new business opportunity 
such as audiophotography, is to realize any immediate beneﬁ ts within existing prod-
uct lines whilst at the same time working up that opportunity for future products. In 
HP’s case, their products span computing, printing and imaging industries of which 
photography is only a very small part. Hence there was a natural long-term pull 
away from the original photographic context to explore the beneﬁ ts of audiovisual 
media and augmented paper for other products and markets. In general, the shorter 
term work was carried out by divisional marketing and R&D groups specialized by 
product category, while the longer term work was carried out by the corporate 
research labs segregated by geography. This situation is represented in Fig.  7.10 and 
played out in Sects.  7.2 and  7.3 above.
 Hence, immediate commercial transfers affected the capture of photographs with 
sounds on HP cameras and their playback through HP imaging software on mobile 
and desktop computers. This was relatively straightforward to implement since 
some cameras were being developed to support video as well as still image capture 
at the time, with integral microphones for sound capture and speakers for sound and 
video playback. Interestingly, these features were inherited ‘for free’ on the Jornada 
PDAs and the high-end digital SLR cameras, both of which were targeted more at 
mobile professionals than at domestic consumers. This led to an initial commer-
cialisation of audiophotography outside the market for which it was originally 
researched and designed. 
 The implementation of audiophoto capture support was also different to that rec-
ommended by our research. Ironically, the Jornada supported voice annotation of 
photographs which we argued against, rather than ambient sound capture around the 
photographic event. The HP 650 DSLR camera tried to rectify this, but with a single 
button rather than with a separate sound capture button as recommended for the left 
index ﬁ nger (see again Fig.  7.9a and the  Blink prototype camera). The second button 
was too difﬁ cult to implement because of the placement of the optical viewﬁ nder in 
this top left position on the body of the camera (from rear). So with Divisional 
 colleagues, we co-invented, designed and patented an alternative method of half-
button depression for onset and offset of sound recording from a single shutter but-

ton (Battles et al.  2002 ). These examples show the opportunistic nature of technology 
and knowledge transfer, and the way that this sometimes leads to modiﬁ cations of 
the original ideas on the one hand and further invention on the other. 
 The transfer of audiophoto support to HP Memories Disc and Image Zone soft-
ware was also relatively straightforward and opened up other uses of audiophotos 
outside photography. Because the same software was supported with computers, 
printers, scanners and all-in-one devices this opened up a debate about the possible 
role of audio and audiophotos in each of their markets. Greatest interest was prob-
ably from the printer divisions intrigued by the possibility of augmented paper, and 
this emboldened the Labs to propose and eventually fund the HP Memory Spot 
project. The fact that this technology had applications outside photography in the 
printing of multimedia documents and labels (Fig.  7.4 ) was seen as a strength that 
might eventually offset the cost of additional research investment. The HP corporate 
Labs was the best place to develop this, because of its research orientation and prod-
uct independence, although that created the problem of ﬁ nding a Divisional cus-
tomer later on. 
 Smaller scale investments were represented by the many other lab projects which 
sprang up more spontaneously to incorporate elements of audiophotography in 
other research contexts. Some of these were opportunistic, making small step 
changes in other prototypes to test the feasibility and beneﬁ ts of sonic augmenta-
tion. For example, the creation of audiopaperclips from the same chips used to cre-
ate embedded chip audioprints (Fig.   6.6 ) was a small step technically, but it opened 
up a new user experience with photographs and other documents that could be anno-
tated with detachable sounds. This was ultimately more suitable to an ofﬁ ce station-
ary market than a domestic photography one, although HP chose not to commercialize 
this either, even though it sold ofﬁ ce stationary such as paper and ink. Other inves-
tigations into voice annotation of online photographs through MemoryNet and 
StoryMail were small adaptations of the audiophoto idea that led to further com-
mercializations both inside and outside HP. StoryMail resulted in the HP StoryCast 
multimedia messaging service, while aspects of MemoryNet can be seen in numer-
ous digital storytelling apps that will be discussed in Chap.   9  . Again these examples 
show a diversiﬁ cation of applications of audiophoto  technology  outside the domes-
tic photography domain. They also generate opportunities that may not be particu-
larly well suited to HP’s existing technologies, markets, channels or competencies. 
In this respect they do what all good research labs should do, which is to challenge 
the company with opportunities to change and grow their business in new 
directions. 
 A ﬁ nal observation can be made about the nature of this challenge with respect 
to the involvement of external collaborators. In general, the research projects involv-
ing other organizations and people  outside HP, generated the most different and 
challenging opportunities. This could be seen in the collaboration with artists on the 
Mobile Bristol project for  Walk in the Woods (Fig.  7.9 ), with photographers and 
engineers at the Universities of Central Lancashire and York for the  Audiophoto 
Desk (Fig.  7.8 ), with students and staff at the Royal College of Arts for the  Memory 
Box, Memory Shelf, Best China, Eavesdropping Camera and Digital Shelf proto-

types (Figs.  7.6 and  7.7 ). For the most part these were not done in partnership with 
Divisional customers and were deliberately provocative with respect to their audi-
ence, which included academic and end user groups of interests to the other part-
ners. In effect, these collaborations were controlled forms of open innovation, 
commissioned by HP in collaboration with HP staff, but subject to some indepen-
dence from HP goals and thinking. Consequently they were valuable to consider but 
difﬁ cult to commercialize. 
 The fact that many of these prototypes and ideas did not make it into direct prod-
uct ‘descendents’, does not mean they did not inﬂ uence later HP products. Depending 
on the timing of their creation and the relationships between researchers, they mutu-
ally inﬂ uenced each other as described in publications and cross citations. And this 
inﬂ uence continued over time, as new researchers adapted  those technologies to 
new contexts and HP markets, as in the above examples. Within the evolving culture 
of HP there continued to be interest in multimedia photography and memory cap-
ture, and in the augmentation of paper with digital content and life. These interests 
can be seen in more contemporary product innovations and acquisitions such as the 
Aurasma augmented reality platform from HP Autonomy (  www.aurasma.com  ), the 
HP Live Photo smartphone app (  http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/ads/printables/live- 
photo.html    ) and the recently announced HP Sprout PC with overhead camera and 
projector (  http://sprout.hp.com/  ). In fact the Audiophoto desk approach of doing 
image recognition on photographic prints to fetch associated digital content, turned 
out to be the most powerful way of bringing paper to life, and extensible to objects 
and hand gestures. HP Live photo is a simple commercialization of this approach 
through a smart phone app which recognises a printed photograph to play an associ-
ated video clip on the phone. And the overhead camera of the Sprout PC echos that 
of the Audiophoto desk, but for bringing paper and objects to life through a fully- 
ﬂ edged PC screen and speakers. While this  also echos much earlier experiments 
with digital desks (e.g. Wellner  1993 ) and the growing momentum of an internet of 
things, it would be wrong to overlook the role that  all the audiophoto prototypes 
played in these recent developments. As we have seen, ideas are taken up and used 
rather opportunistically by individual people or teams within particular institutional 
contexts, and there is evidence of at least early uptake of these ideas within the 
Zeitgeist of HP Labs and Divisions. 
 Many of these HP developments exploit the technology and functionality of audio-
photographs outside the photography context. In the next two chapters we will con-
sider audiophoto research and product developments in the wider industry to see if 
they have brought the proposed practice of audiophotography any closer to reality.

 External Research 
 Invention is not a matter of a sudden ﬂ ash of inspiration from 
which a new device emerges ‘ready-made’. Largely it is a 
matter of minute and painstaking modiﬁ cation of existing 
technology. It is a creative and imaginative process, but that 
imagination lies above all in seeing ways in which existing 
devices can be improved, and in extending the scope of 
techniques successful in one area into new areas.  (Donald and 
Wajcman  1986 , p. 8) 
8.1  Mapping the Territory 
 Identifying external research in audiophotography after 2004 is a difﬁ cult but not 
impossible task. It is made tractable by the academic practice of citing references 
related to any current ﬁ eld of study. This makes it possible to trace the forward cita-
tion of references to the initial audiophotography vision, as represented in four 
papers (at 17 November 2014):
 1.  47 citations to an early conference paper on the approach (Frohlich and Tallyn 
 1999 ) 
 2.  24 citations to a journal paper describing the audioprint opportunity (Frohlich 
et al.  2000 ) 
 3.  86 citations to the original  Audiophotography book (Frohlich  2004 ) 
 4.  10 citations to a conference paper on the audiophoto desk (Frohlich et al.  2004 ) 
 While many of these citations to these four publications overlap, and others are 
being made continuously, there were probably around 100 unique pieces of work to 
consider 10 years after publication of the Audiophotography book. These broke 
down into three categories which further reﬁ ne the search for external developments 
in the ﬁ eld. Some references were from  HP authors whose related work has already 
been reviewed in Chap.   7 . Other citations are really  passing references to aspects of 
the original work or its representation of a class of similar works. Hence, the audio-
photography work contains a number of contributions which can be referenced 
separately, such as the method of conducting ethnographic work in the home (cited 
in Drazin and Frohlich  2007 ), the ﬁ ne-grained analysis of ‘phototalk’ (cited in Swan 
et al.  2008 ), linking sounds to printed photographs on the Audiophoto desk (cited in 

176
van Erve et al.  2011 ), and representing interactions with photographs in a diamond 
framework (cited in Lindley et al.  2009 ). The examination of sound with pictures 
can also be classiﬁ ed more generally as a form of multimedia photography (e.g. 
cited in Durrant et al.  2011a ,  b ; Whittaker et al.  2010 ; Wilson et al.  2012 ) or a new 
form of multimedia communication on cameraphones (e.g. cited in Kindberg et al. 
 2005a ,  b ). However, a third set of citations were from authors who were  developing 
the core ideas or claims of audiophotography in different ways. It is to these authors 
that we now turn, ﬁ rst to identify particular strands of research and second to review 
their ﬁ ndings. 
 Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that there are only a small number of research 
strands and groups who have been actively developing the notion of audiophotogra-
phy since 2004. In fact there are only six main lines of investigation as shown in 
Fig.  8.1 . The ﬁ gure shows developments as branches of an audiophotography ‘tree’, 
exploring the ideas of audiophoto  messages and  narratives , audio  context for pho-
tographs and  triggers for memory, and the playback of audio from  paper and  arti-
facts . The metaphor of a tree was more productive here than that of the ripple used 
in Chap.   1 , since distinct lines of research can be shown to emanate from the cited 
references, growing and sometimes splitting over time. 1 Three industrial research 
groups are actively involved, including Microsoft Research Cambridge, Motorola 
1  The fact that coherent rings of wood develop together across the trunk and branches of a tree is a 
nice connection between the two metaphors.

Labs and IBM Research Tokyo. Eight other university groups are involved, includ-
ing Aalto, Surrey, Swansea, Victoria Institute, MIT Europe, Shefﬁ eld, York, 
Maryland and UCSD. This is in addition to internal HP developments reviewed in 
Chap.   7 by HP Labs and their open innovation partners the Royal College of Art, the 
University of Central Lancashire and the University of the West of England. Many 
of the individual researchers in these groups know each other, are co-authors across 
the tree, and indeed have moved between these institutions over the 10 year period 
from 2004 to 2014. This illustrates again the personal nature of scientiﬁ c research 
and technological design, and the way in which ideas circulate and develop within 
academic and industrial communities.
 In the next six sections of this chapter, I review the lessons of each strand of the 
audiophotography tree in turn. A ﬁ nal section discusses the connections between 
them. Discussion of the implications of the ﬁ ndings for audiophotography and theo-
ries of innovation are reserved for Chap.   10 , following a brief review of commercial 
developments in Chap.   9 . 
8.2  Audiophoto Messages 
 The initial context for work on audiophotography, as the name suggests, was pho-
tography. More speciﬁ cally it was the process of capturing images through CCD 
and CMOS sensors inside digital cameras that brought everyday photographs into 
the digital domain. This laid the foundation for combining photographs with other 
digital media such as sound, and for considering the impact of sound on photogra-
phy itself. However, a second step in the digital photography revolution took place 
in parallel to this work around 2001–2002, with the embedding of digital cameras 
inside mobile phones. The resulting ‘camera phones’ were seen as communication 
devices (phones) ﬁ rst and foremost, with images as an exciting new way of illustrat-
ing conversations or text messages with pictures (c.f. Sarvas and Frohlich  2011 ). 
Audio capture was not supported on early versions. Furthermore picture quality was 
low and did not rival that of contemporary digital cameras of the day. In this context, 
Koskinen and colleagues ( 2002 , p. 95) referenced our early audiophoto work (refer-
ence 2 above) in a design recommendation to incorporate spoken narratives with 
pictures. This was based on ﬁ ndings from a small-scale trial in which participants 
sent sequences of picture-and-text messages to each other, telling true or ﬁ ctional 
stories over time. 
 Audio was subsequently incorporated into an early Multimedia Message Service 
(MMS) supported by Radiolinja, the Finnish mobile phone operator. This allowed 
users to combine photographs, text and audio clips in multimedia messages that 
could be sent directly to other camera phones. The service was tested in a further 
study led by Koskinen in which 25 participants used a Nokia 7650 with integral 
camera. Subsequent write-ups referenced the 2004 Audiophotography book and 
explicitly considered the role of sound in ‘mobile multimedia’ communication 
(Koskinen  2005 ,  2007 ; Koskinen and Battarbee  2006 ). The uptake of MMS 
8.2 Audiophoto Messages

178
 messaging in the trial, and subsequently the market, was somewhat disappointing. 
Participants took many photographs to share face-to face with those around them or 
with others later on. When photographs were sent to others on the phone, they usu-
ally  incorporated text annotations rather than audio. Text was used in two genres of 
picture messages referred to as  postcards  or  stories (Koskinen  2007 , Chap. 4). 
Postcards were simple image + text combinations containing a greeting and some 
description of the surroundings or context for the photograph. Stories were 
sequences of postcard- style messages designed to reveal an unfolding experience or 
storyline over time. 
 About 10–13 % of messages contained audio, depending on the way they were 
counted and analysed in different publications (c.f. Koskinen  2007 , Chap. 5; 
Koskinen and Battarbee  2006 ). Audio was generally used to enhance an image-and- 
text combination assembled by default through the interface. For this reason it sel-
dom carried the main narrative content of the message but rather embellished it 
through greetings, singing, laughter, cries or other ambient sounds. Elements of 
sound could be recorded intentionally or unintentionally by the sender, and recipi-
ents appeared to make use of both to imagine the context and location of the mes-
sage and sender. Various reasons were given for the modest use of sound in relation 
to text, including the lack of familiarity compared to texting, the mundane nature of 
images compared to conventional snapshots, and the lack of adequate support for 
sound management and editing. 
 These ﬁ ndings on multimedia communication have carried through to the pres-
ent day in many ways, with text remaining the dominant method of annotating 
images now shared over the web via social networking sites. In the next section we 
see that this is culturally speciﬁ c, and could change in communities with low levels 
of textual literacy and stronger oral storytelling traditions.  
8.3  Audiophoto Narratives 
 The storied nature of some picture messages was also evident in early audiophoto 
recordings, such as the surﬁ ng narrative of Fig.   1.2 in the original Audiophotography 
book. This contained a spoof BBC sports commentary by a father while taking a 
sequence of pictures of his son trying to surf. Quite independently, this kind of 
audiophoto narrative was also under development at the time by Joe Lambert and 
colleagues in California, within the digital storytelling movement (Lambert  2002 ). 
This emerged from the digitally mediated storytelling performances of Dana 
Atchley and subsequent community ﬁ lm-making workshops designed to allow ordi-
nary people to tell their personal stories in pictures and sound. Typically, stories 
would be up to 2 min long comprising a sequence of still images with voiceover, 
music and ambient sound. They would be assembled in Adobe Premiere on desktop 
Macintosh computers with expert training and facilitation in ﬁ lm writing and pro-
duction. Because of the community context in which this was done, the activity was 
elevated above the level of personal photography to capture the lives and

experiences of communities, and has been applied in numerous forms of commu-
nity empowerment and activism ever since (e.g. Hartley and McWilliam  2009 ; 
Lambert  2013 ). 
 In 2006 at the University of Surrey, I was given the opportunity with new col-
leagues across the UK and beyond, to bring together the audiophoto work with the 
digital storytelling approach. We did this in an ICT for development project in India. 
The project was called  StoryBank and aimed to explore the role of ‘mobile digital 
storytelling’ for information exchange within rural developing communities. This 
addressed a problem of low literacy rates in such regions which was impeding the 
use of ICT and the web. It did this by allowing people to express news stories and 
information in audiophoto narratives on the new generation of camera phones that 
were exploding into the emerging markets of that time (Frohlich and Jones  2008 ). 
Situating ourselves within Budikote village in southern India, we studied the suc-
cess of a local community radio station in order to develop a form of radio-like 
content with pictures that could be created quickly and easily on a mobile phone. 
This could be shared using Bluetooth (without internet connection) with other 
phones or with a public display on the balcony of the village ICT centre. The system 
was a success in encouraging wider participation in content creation and a virtuous 
circle of production and consumption within different segments of the community 
(Frohlich et al.  2009a ,  b ). The approach went beyond conventional digital storytell-
ing by using audiophoto capture techniques on a mobile device rather than ﬁ lmmak-
ing software on desktop computers. It also went beyond early audiophotography, by 
developing new techniques to support audiovisual narratives within a new cultural 
context. Unlike the ﬁ ndings of early MMS use in Finland, voiceover and sound 
recording was embraced with photography by rural Indian participants, as an inclu-
sive new form of cultural expression in their local language. The fact that we used 
local Bluetooth communication, also removed the cost of sending MMS messages, 
albeit at the expense of remote story sharing. 
 The generalizability of mobile digital storytelling was tested in a follow-up proj-
ect, carried out in the Mankosi region of eastern South Africa from August 2010. 
This aimed to explore audiovisual information sharing over wider distances and in 
a different African culture. It also committed to develop and release an open source 
toolkit by the end of the project 2 years later. I was co-investigator on the project led 
by Matt Jones from the University of Swansea, with the Universities of Glasgow, 
Cape Town and the Meraka Institute involved. The new dynamic of this project was 
the sparsity of electricity and internet connectivity across the region, and the lack of 
affordability of mobile internet tariffs. We therefore designed a more robust version 
of the StoryBank system to be geographically based around solar powered charging 
stations and community story repositories (Bidwell et al.  2014 ). As part of this proj-
ect we designed a new audiophoto narrative app for Android devices called  Com- 
Phone , itself an element of the  Com-Me (community media) toolkit:   http://
digitaleconomytoolkit.org/com-phone/  This allowed users to string together audio-
photo frames with up to three layers of sound, a photograph, and a piece of text on 
each frame. Any or all of these media items could be inserted into each frame. The 
interface is shown in Fig.  8.2 . Text annotation was also supported because of the 
8.3 Audiophoto Narratives

180
higher literacy rates in this region, but was seldom used in practice (Frohlich et al. 
 2012 ). The resulting digital stories or narratives could be sent via Bluetooth to 
nearby devices, but also emailed or uploaded to social media sites like YouTube in 
wi ﬁ  zones or over 3G.
 From an audiophotography perspective, the above projects essentially re- 
imagined the audiocamera as a mobile digital storytelling app, designed for a smart-
phone with intermittent connection to the web. Similar apps have since been 
developed for Apple and Microsoft devices and will be reviewed in Chap.   9 . While 
most of these are designed for youth or working adults in a Western context, one app 
is designed more inclusively for children and older adults, and has more in common 
with Com-Phone. This a called  StoryKit and is described in a research paper by 
Quinn et al. ( 2009 ) from the University of Maryland who cite the original audiphoto 
work as well as StoryBank. The app runs on an iPhone and was co-designed by 
children and older adults working with researchers to support the creation of multi-
media storybooks. The interface is shown in Fig.  8.3 and allows the creation of 
complex pages of a book comprising (a) live or (b) stored photographs (c) text (d) 
audio and (e) drawings. The paper is the story of the design journey rather than the 
effectiveness of the tool itself, and proposes design guidelines for similar apps. 
These include recommendations about re-sizing content, attaching sound, adding 
text and sharing privately.
 A subsequent test of StoryKit involved seven intergenerational pairs of users on 
a day out in a national park, the families of two pairs using it for a further 7 weeks. 
It also involved an analysis of 245 anonymous stories shared through an on-line 
portal by people downloading the StoryKit from the app store on iTunes (Bonsignore

 2010 ). The app was found to be fun to use by children and adults alike, and the 
mobile device was often passed between them for different contributions to stories. 
For example children would often record spoken narrative while adults preferred to 
type. Children seemed to especially enjoy recording sound effects and drawing. 
Some adults marveled over how it gave the children a new method of expression 
and a tool for learning and reﬂ ection following an experience. Story analysis showed 
a great variety of forms, from a one page story with two audio clips to a 22 page 
photo-narrative with 37 photos, one drawing and one sound recording. Audio was 
used in 40 % of the stories and often accompanied photographs and text (see also 
Bonsignore  2013 for an expanded analysis with additional data). Again these ﬁ nd-
ings suggest that narrative audiophotography is a creative new medium that may 
have more attraction outside a typical Western adult audience, in this case for child-
hood education and intergenerational collaboration.

8.4  Audio Context for Photography 
 In the sections above we have seen how the use of spoken voiceover with single or 
multiple photographs can lead to audiophoto messages or narratives of different 
kinds. In this section, I review three explorations of the use of ambient audio 
recorded around the photo event. Two of these develop the artistic and aesthetic 
potential of the audiphoto medium in different directions, while a third uses it in a 
very practical way to make photography more accessible to people with visual 
impairment. I begin with the audiophoto arts-based studies. 
 In a project called RAW, a team from MIT Media Lab Europe developed the audio-
photography approach into a distinct form of documentary ﬁ lmmaking for capturing 
‘audiovisual impressions of everyday life’ (Bitton et al.  2004 ). Inspired by the mun-
dane nature of scenes within the documentary  Sans Soleil (1982) by Chris Marker, 
and the need to promote greater cultural understanding, the team created a new audio-
camera system. This recorded 1 min of high quality spatial audio before and after each 
photograph was taken, through binaural in-ear microphones and software which 
selected segments from a continuous sound recording. If photos were taken less than 
1 min apart, an audiophoto narrative resulted with continuous sound starting and end-
ing 1 min before and after the photo sequence. An additional screen-based playback 
feature was designed, based on user-selected points of interest in each photograph. 
These were used as locations from which the image would zoom out to reveal itself 
up to the photo capture point, before fading out to the end of the audio clip or next 
photograph. Audiences could also skip to the next photo at will. This system was 
evolved through user engagements in Ireland, France and Mali, where various user 
groups were given the chance to record and review the resulting material. 
 User reactions differed between locations but were generally curious and posi-
tive in equal measure. Feedback in Ireland led to the animated and interactive play-
back scheme, presumably because staring at a static image for 2 min is frustrating. 
This was about four times as long as the average duration of an audiophotograph in 
my own work, and even then I found users often skip on before the end of each clip 
(Frohlich  2004 ). Feedback from secondary school children in France, revealed idio-
syncratic uses for capturing impressions of things inside a home, architectural fea-
tures outside, or people on the street. Further uses were revealed in a larger study in 
Mali with 23 participants ranging from 10 to ‘over 50’, recruited opportunistically 
across three locations. Analysis of recorded material indicated four distinct uses of 
the system as described below. Local audience reaction to the audiophotos in a sub-
sequent exhibition reﬂ ected satisfaction in what was captured, but some confusion 
as to the motivations of the researchers.
•  Social glances – recordings used as a means to strike up conversations with other 
people 
•  Caught in activities  – the capture of everyday activities and skills such a collect-
ing water or performing music 
•  Active documentation – explanation of an activity or issue with narration and/or 
interview recording 
8 External Research

183
•  Intentional discourses – direct political messages or commentary to a foreign 
audience with photo illustration  
 Three papers from researchers at the Viktoria Institute cite the earliest audiopho-
tography reference (1) in a series of studies in  ‘context photography’ (Ljungblad 
et al.  2004 ; Håkansson et al.  2006 ; Ljungblad  2007 ). The ﬁ rst and third papers con-
centrate on the methodology used in developing the approach and especially the 
inspiration drawn from  lomography (Ljungblad et al.  2004 ,  2007 ). This is an ama-
teur photography practice using low cost Russian analogue cameras to create par-
ticular visual effects. Lomographers ‘shoot from the hip’ without using a viewﬁ nder 
and this results in strangely framed and exposed images with a distinctively sponta-
neous aesthetic. Context photography also attempts to create a new photographic 
genre by applying image ﬁ lters based on aspects of the surrounding context. In 
practice, sound and movement were used in various ways to change the visual 
appearance of a photograph, as described in Hakansson et al. ( 2006 ). Four visual 
effects were supported on Nokia 660 and 6630 camera phones, through software 
analyzing the frequency and loudness of ongoing sounds and the amount and loca-
tion of ongoing movement in relation to the photo capture ‘click’. One of these 
transformations called ‘Wave’ is shown in Fig.  8.4 . In this case, movement creates 
waves in the image, making it look like a dense liquid; the size of the pixels is pro-
portional to the surrounding sound level.
 A user trial with seven Swedish participants ranging in age from 23 to 49 years 
generated 303 context photographs in total (Håkansson et al.  2006 ). This revealed 
interest in the creative possibilities of using movement and sound context to inﬂ u-
ence photography, but also some frustration in the lack of control and the resulting 
 Fig. 8.4   A context picture showing distortions due to movement and surrounding sound levels in 
an ofﬁ ce environment (Hakansson et al.  2006 ) (Used with permission) 
 
8.4 Audio Context for Photography

184
images. As in lomography, the context photographers were often surprised by the 
appearance of images and sought ways of inﬂ uencing them to create certain effects. 
Here, this included ways of moving the camera itself as in spinning or panning it or 
taking photos from a moving car or train, and seeking out noisy environments or 
screaming whilst the photo was taken. Consequently, the technology affected the 
kind of photographs taken, rather than reﬂ ecting the naturalistic context for conven-
tional camera phone images. Users wanted more control over the calibration of 
sensor data and its effects, and more subtle inﬂ uence so that images were not ren-
dered unrecognizable by those effects. 
 Finally, Harada and colleagues at IBM Research Tokyo and UCSD draw on 
audiophotography to develop a new kind of camera system for the blind (Harada 
et al.  2013 ). Following an observation that many visually impaired people continue 
to take or share photographs with sighted family and friends, they consider the use 
of both ambient sound and voice annotation for enhancing and managing photo-
graphs for this population. In their ‘ Accessible photo album’  app for the iPhone they 
support ongoing capture of ambient sound which can be restarted with a double-tap 
gesture on the iPhone screen, and stopped on photo capture through a downward 
swipe gesture. Post capture spoken labels can be recorded on each photo by a tap- 
and- hold action which stops on release. In this way all photographs can have associ-
ated ambient and voice label audio for browsing and playback. In browsing mode, 
the user can swipe through photo lists, listening to key metadata read out on presen-
tation. On full display the app plays the voice label for a photo followed by the 
ambient sound. A small scale trial of the system with 5 visually impaired users 
showed great enthusiasm for the approach in encouraging more photographic cap-
ture and better sharing, due to the simple gestural control interface and additional 
audio information. Voice labels were practically useful for identifying and selecting 
photos to share while ambient sounds were valuable for conveying atmosphere and 
additional information to photographers and audiences alike. There was some dis-
cussion of  when each type of sound might be recorded around the image capture 
event, since the auto-recording of ambient sound before the click often contained 
set-up talk between the user and their companion. Some users kept this as the voice 
label, while others wanted more naturalistic sound kept separately. Furthermore, not 
all users wanted to play voice labels to audiences at sharing time. Notwithstanding 
these design issues, the approach was highly successful and the authors discuss 
ways of further combining photographs, sound, video and metadata in the future, 
and standardizing data formats for sharing.  
8.5  Audio Memory 
 A major ﬁ nding of the original audiophoto work was that people have a sonic as 
well as a visual memory for events. That is, they are able to remember the sounds of 
particular places, events and periods of their lives as well as their visual character-
istics. This is not so surprising given that hearing is probably the second major sense 
8 External Research

185
after sight for perception of the world. But we are not so used to the idea of captur-
ing sounds as reminders of the past as we are with the idea of capturing photo-
graphs. This led me to coin the term ‘audiographs’ in the 2004 book (page 2) to 
refer to the equivalent of a photograph in sound alone, as a way of triggering sonic 
memory for events. 
 This notion has been developed in subsequent research citing the audiophotogra-
phy book. A fascinating introduction to this comes from a serendipitous set of ﬁ nd-
ings across two studies carried out by Bentley and colleagues at Motorola Labs. 
They noticed similarities in the properties and use of photographs and music emerg-
ing from separate studies of each medium carried out between 2002 and 2005 
(Bentley et al.  2006 ). Some of these similarities were in the organization and 
retrieval of photo and music content. For example, people struggled with an inten-
tion to organize both media better, sometimes ﬁ nding the time to classify, label and 
ﬁ le items and sometimes not. This interacted with their ability to browse and ﬁ nd 
items later, which was typiﬁ ed by a kind of satisﬁ cing behavior to settle with some-
thing similar enough to what they had in mind. In browsing through both photos and 
music, people reported getting sidetracked into reviewing material discovered by 
accident that they hadn’t seen or heard for a long time. This reminded them of for-
gotten people and events and led to protracted stretches of private reminiscing. The 
authors report strong similarities between the way photographs and music appear to 
be linked to past events in people’s minds, and a propensity to share and talk about 
this. For example, particular songs were associated with people who had given them 
the music or listened to it with them, and musical preferences were found to be 
highly idiosyncratic and indicative of a person’s personality. The paper concludes 
with recommendations for integrating music and photo collections and supporting 
common activities of managing, combining and sharing media relating to particular 
people or events. 
 Two further explorations of the sentimental properties of sound citing the audio-
photo work were carried out in my own group at the University of Surrey in collabo-
ration with Microsoft Research Cambridge, and at the University of Shefﬁ eld. Both 
investigations involve multiple studies and explore the role of ambient sound in 
memory. 
 In the ﬁ rst published study of the domestic soundscape, we found that certain 
naturally occurring sounds in the home are evocative of family life and would be 
worth saving (Oleksik et al.  2008 ). This was discovered almost by accident through 
a methodology that asked families to record certain sounds in the home for later 
discussion. Those recorded in the categories of ‘favourite sounds’, ‘sounds that 
reminded them of home’, and ‘sounds they would like to keep’ turned out to be 
particularly attractive and many families asked for a copy of the recordings. We 
referred to these as  sonic gems because they stood out from the majority of mundane 
and forgettable domestic sounds as precious discoveries. They included sounds 
such as children talking while at play or breathing while asleep, the cat purring, and 
conversation around a meal. This led to a design proposal for a sonic gem recorder 
in the form of a wearable recording device on a pendant, and a sonic gem bowl for 
playing back sounds from physical gems broken off from the pendant (see Fig.  8.5 ).

 In a follow up study on sonic gems, Oleksik and Brown ( 2008 ) at Microsoft 
Research Cambridge carried out a trial of sentimental sound recordings and gauged 
reactions to playback from a prototype sonic gem and bowl set. Four families with 
children under the age of 6 were interviewed at home about their existing sound 
recording practices before being asked to capture sonic gems on a digital Dictaphone. 
Some of the recordings were edited and associated with physical ‘gems’ in the form 
of plastic eggs containing RFID tags. Families were interviewed in a second home 
visit about the captured sounds, and gave their reactions to playback from a sonic 
bowl with integral RFID reader. This played edited sound clips from each gem as it 
was removed from the bowl. 
 The ﬁ ndings from phase 1 of the study revealed that families all had prior sound 
recording experiences but that these had declined with the replacement of audio 
cassette tapes by CD and MP3 technology, and answering machines by voicemail 
services. Practices of recording music from the radio had sometimes spilled over 
into accidental or deliberate ambient sound recording, and many participants 
reported having ad hoc collections of precious sound recordings in their homes. 
These included children having fun with audio cassette recording, compilation 
music tapes, and voice messages on answerphone tapes that had become precious 
with the death of speakers. Families could not always play back these sounds from 
old technologies, and in some cases the recordings had been lost or accidentally 
thrown away. 
 In phase 2 of the study families were fascinated with the challenge of capturing 
precious sounds and responded in a variety of creative ways. They recorded children 
and baby sounds, people singing, conversations, indoor and outdoor ambient 
sounds, and music. Each of these types appeared to have different sentimental prop-
erties and values, but all conjured up memories as they listened back to them with 
researchers. In many cases the sounds triggered vivid mental images of associated 
people, events and places, and this led to a discussion of the relationship with photos 
and video. Where audiences were present at the time the recording was taken, unac-
companied audio was felt to be more immersive and evocative, giving room to the

et al.  2008 ) (Used with

imagination in the way imagery did not. Playback from the sonic gems and bowl 
was liked in this regard, especially where audio clips had been shortened to play key 
phrases rather than long rambling episodes. The paper concluded with recommen-
dations for larger scale studies and for the design of new technology for supporting 
digital sound capture and playback, with and without other media. 
 This design challenge was taken up by other researchers at Microsoft Research 
Cambridge and the Technical University of Eindhoven (Helmes et al.  2009 ). Taking 
inspiration from the sonic gems work and other research on lifelogging (e.g. 
Gemmell et al.  2006 ), the authors designed and tested  The Other Brother . This was 
a semi-autonomous device for the home that captured images and video around 
sonic events. In fact the device used twin microphones to identify the source of the 
sound, towards which the device could then turn. A ﬁ rst prototype was tested with 
three families over Christmas 2008. Although some surprising moments of family 
life were caught on camera so to speak, families were reluctant to interact directly 
with the device and somewhat confused about its recording behaviour. A second 
prototype gave more feedback on its behaviour and invited more interaction and 
manual control over its operation (see Fig.  8.6 ). In addition, it was given audiophoto 
capabilities in the form of recording 10 s of sound around each photograph taken. 
The resulting sound content was seen as a surprise bonus to still photographs in a 
second trial with two families. A ﬁ nal prototype retained audiophoto and video 
capture, removed manual control, and reﬁ ned the way sound deviations triggered 
capture. Further testing and development appears to have stopped at this point, but 
the approach demonstrates some new possibilities for automatic capture of audio-
photos and video clips in everyday life.
 A ﬁ nal pair of papers describe a new study of family sound recording and the 
design and testing of new technology to support this. Researchers at the University 
of Shefﬁ eld collaborated with a visiting anthropologist from Rice University to con-
duct a study of  sonic souvenirs , deﬁ ned as sound-only mementos of a family holi-
day (Dib et al.  2010 ). These contrast with sonic gems in relating to speciﬁ c trips

 away from the family home, where sounds are likely to be less familiar and recorded 
from a wider diversity of outdoor as well as indoor environments. In fact the study 
was a replication of the early audiophoto trial reported in references 1, 2 and 3 
above, using Dictaphones rather than audiocamera devices. Hence, 10 families with 
children aged 7–15 were given 30 dictaphones over the summer of 2008 to docu-
ment 3 days of their holidays in sound alone. They were later interviewed about the 
captured sounds at home. 
 Families greatly enjoyed the capture exercise and listening back to the sounds 
together. In fact, group listening stimulated conversation and speculation about the 
sounds being played, which itself led to better remembering and spontaneous story-
telling in front of the researchers. A great variety of sounds were recorded, includ-
ing live commentary, distinctive sounds of the areas being visited, and family 
conversations. As in the Oleksik and Brown ( 2008 ) study, families were often sur-
prised by the detail recorded in the sound clips and enjoyed the ‘imaginative free-
dom’ of listening back at the pace of the recording itself without accompanying 
images. In addition, families in this study found the sound clips to be more candid 
and less ﬂ attering than photographs, because they took place over longer stretches 
of time and were less controllable. This sometimes led to the recording of argu-
ments, crying, and shouting with children, which were either seen as funny in hind-
sight or deleted before the researchers returned. In other cases, participants used the 
recording medium as an opportunity for playful performances of various kinds, 
such as interviewing fellow travellers or speaking to an imagined audience in mock 
documentary style. This led the authors to discuss differences between sounds and 
pictures for recording the past, and to recommend more accessible and creative 
technology for sound management and editing. 
 One such technology was later developed by the authors themselves, in collabo-
ration with Nicolas Villar from Microsoft Research Cambridge. This was called 
‘Family Memory Radio’ or  FM Radio for short (Petrelli et al.  2010 ). The device 
re-purposed an old Roberts R707 analogue radio with volume and tuning dials and 
channel selection buttons. It’s analogue speakers and interfaces were preserved but 
re-arranged and driven by hidden digital hardware comprising a CPU, audio chip, 
USB port and a display for channel labels. Sound clips organized into four folders 
on a USB stick were accessed from one of four channel buttons and played sequen-
tially in chronological order at a speciﬁ ed volume level (left control knob). Users 
could also rewind or advance the playback/tracks by rotating the tuning dial anti-
clockwise or clockwise respectively (right control knob). Channel classiﬁ cation 
became a subject of discussion, but was set by default to  Time travel  (chronological), 
 Ambient ,  Voices and  Favourites . Pressing a ﬁ fth button, marked the current track as 
a favourite and put it in the Favourites playlist (see Fig.  8.7 ).
 The prototype was taken back to 6 of the original 10 families taking part in the 
Dib et al. ( 2010 ) study, 1 year later in the summer of 2009. Families listened and 
reminisced to the original sounds which many had forgotten due to lack of access in 
the intervening period. The radio interface was generally appealing and served to 
support more convenient shared listening and trigger discussion of future use. 
Members of the family had different suggestions for channel types but generally 
8 External Research

189
agreed with the model of creating and managing these from a computer. A recurring 
suggestion was for sounds to serve as background to photo sharing activities, with 
some disagreement as to whether this should be synchronized directly to photo dis-
play. This opens up a new design space for more loosely connected audiophoto 
materials, designed to evoke past memories and emotions in more poetic combina-
tions for a group setting.  
8.6  Audiopaper 
 One of the most novel aspects of the original audiophotography vision was the pos-
sibility of playing back sounds from printed photographs or  audioprints . This led to 
a number of granted patents on what might be called  audiopaper for either embed-
ding sound within a photograph or otherwise identifying it so that associated sound 
can be retrieved from elsewhere. This vision was entirely consistent with the HP 
context of the original work, since HP were market leaders in printers and could 
have introduced augmented paper into their printer and consumables range. It was 
also consistent with early studies of digital photography in which consumers 
expressed reluctance to move away from the tangibility of printed photographs to 
screen-based ones. Given the subsequent transition to screen-based photography on 
smartphones and tablets, at least in the more technologically saturated parts of the 
world, we might have expected subsequent work on audiopaper outside HP to 
decline. However, three university research groups as well as my own at Surrey have 
continued to explore the ﬁ eld, citing connections to the original audioprint work.

8.6 Audiopaper

These include York, Swansea and the University of California San Diego (UCSD) 
(see again Fig.  8.1 ). 
 The ﬁ rst exploration of audiopaper after 2004 was a user study of the audiophoto 
desk by collaborators at York. Three groups of four friends created audioprints to 
share on the desk in a living lab setting called the York Responsive Home (Lindley 
and Monk  2005 ). About 8 existing photographs per person were annotated with 
sound effects, music or voiceover in the knowledge that they would be shared with 
three particular other people. The selection of audio for this purpose was analysed 
along with the ﬁ rst 8 min of group photo sharing on the desk, in order to understand 
the function of audio in reminiscing and storytelling and its inﬂ uence on the result-
ing conversation. 
 Sound did appear to add atmosphere, fun and humour to the activity, but at the 
cost of authoring associations deliberately for the audience at hand. Music was the 
most effective category of sound leading to the longest clips, the shortest duration 
of silent listening, and the longest surrounding conversation. Participants often rec-
ognized the track within about 3 s and could begin talking about the photo or its 
music, while the music continued to play through for about 40 s. In contrast, 
voiceover clips varied greatly in length and tended to inhibit conversation for an 
average of 7 s until completed. They then resulted in slightly longer turns at talk 
than ambient sound photographs, perhaps due to their meaningful content (an aver-
age of 37 rather than 33 s). Some delay in the responsiveness of the desk in playing 
or pausing sounds, together with the tabletop conﬁ guration, gave the sessions a 
more unpredictable and formal character than passing around printed photographs 
from person to person. This led to recommendations for faster and more reliable 
audio association and playback with photographs, perhaps from a handheld device. 
 A further study of the audiophoto desk as a public art installation was carried out 
by myself and other colleagues from York, originally in Glasgow (Blythe et al. 
 2008 ). A visual artist and product designer 2 collaborated to create audiophoto sto-
ries of the Govan shipyard area of Glasgow, for public display in the city. The instal-
lation was called ‘Weegie’ which is a slang term for Glasgow residents (Glaswegians) 
but also a reference to a kind of ouija board experience we tried to create of past 
voices and sounds from the history of the area. The desk was re-designed for this 
purpose as a circular table enclosed in a tent-like space (see Fig.  8.8 ). This allowed 
users to gather around it from any angle and begin to combine images and sounds 
from six distinct stories sets, comprising three audioprints each. Individual sets 
 contained ambient, voiceover and musical audiophotos describing past and present 
life in Govan. Sound volume was controlled by moving photographs between the 
edge and the centre of the desk, with stereo panning moving to the left or right side 
of the room as usual.
 Exhibition of the desk and its material was cut short in the Glasgow LUV gallery 
by a technical problem caused by one particular photograph, itself depicting several 
framed photographs. The exhibition was later restaged in the York Responsive 
Home and visitors were interviewed about their experience. In addition, a theatre

reviewer, ﬁ lm and radio reviewer and comic book reviewer were all invited to write 
reviews of the exhibition itself. The diversity of audience and reviewer reactions 
were contrasted with conventional lab-based evaluations of interactive prototypes, 
such as the Lindley and Monk ( 2005 ) study above. Word clouds from audience 
interviews showed subtle shifts in the perception of Glasgow before and after expo-
sure to the exhibition, while critics discussed the aesthetics of the piece as a whole, 
the ‘magic’ of the technology, and its relation to examples and genres of art in other 
media. The broadly positive feedback served to validate the desk and approach as a 
new form of artistic expression, and raised questions about the role of interaction 
critics in interaction design. 
 An independent line of research by Ann-Marie Piper and colleagues at UCSD 
examined the role of audiopaper photographs for encouraging social interaction 
with older people (Piper et al.  2013 ,  2014 ). In a detailed case study of an extended 
family, the authors used the Livescribe digital pen and Anoto paper to augment 
printed photographs with custom audio recordings. For this they used the TAP & 
PLAY authoring toolkit created on another project (Piper et al.  2012 ) to allow users 
to mark regions of photographs or surrounding areas and associate them with 
recorded voiceover or other sounds. Sounds could be played back from a speaker in 
the pen, simply by tapping on active regions in the album. In the study, a printed 
audiophoto album was created by relatives of Ethel for her 105th birthday, and sub-
sequently enhanced and reviewed by Ethel and her family and friends over a 5 
month period. The ﬁ ndings revealed a strong interest in the technology, together 
with tangible improvements in Ethel’s memory for relatives and shared events

through repeated playback of names and stories from pictures. The album also 
brought disparate members of the family together in its creation and sharing, and 
gave Ethel a new focus for interaction with carers and other residents in her home. 
 In quite a different context, Robinson and colleagues at Swansea University built 
and tested the  AudioCanvas system for playing back voice annotations from printed 
materials in an Indian village and South African township (Robinson et al.  2014 ). 
This used a voice service on mobile phone to read aloud aspects of the text or play 
additional instructions and explanations in local language, for participants with low 
levels of literacy in the printed language. Voice snippets were invoked by touching 
regions of a  snapshot of the printed material, which contained QR codes in two 
corners to identify and register the page boundaries. 
 A sample of pre-prepared items including a phone bill and map in India, and a 
newspaper and ﬂ ier in South Africa, were tested by local people to great acclaim. 
Despite some problems of framing snapshots and locating active regions on the 
phone, 58 participants praised the concept and gave it an average usefulness rating of 
over 8 out of 10. In subsequent work the researchers have developed an authoring 
toolkit called  PaperChains  (Pearson et al.  2015 ). This works like the TAP & PLAY 
toolkit, in allowing audio recordings to be linked to arbitrary regions of printed mate-
rial for later playback. However, the main focus of  PaperChains appears to be col-
laborative storytelling through hand drawn sketches and voice annotation. This 
application of audiopaper moves away from audio-photo material to illustrate the 
value of other tangible image and sound combinations for developing communities.  
8.7  Audio Artifacts 
 Two parallel investigations from researchers based mainly at the University of 
Shefﬁ eld and Microsoft Research Cambridge explored the stories people tell about 
cherished objects in the home. Both cite the audiophoto book as highlighting pho-
tographs as a class of cherished objects, but also the related HP research by myself, 
Rachel Murphy and Jacqueline Fennel (Frohlich and Murphy  2000 ; Frohlich and 
Fennell  2007 ). This is described in Chap.   7 and essentially shows that objects them-
selves can function as memory triggers in the same way as photographs, and can be 
augmented with sound or other media to enhance remembering (see again Figs.   7.6 
and   7.7 on the  Memory Box ,  Memory Shelf and  Best China design concepts). The 
overarching practice of using physical or digital artefacts as icons of experience and 
identity, was referred to as a kind of  domestic iconography in Frohlich and Fennel 
( 2007 ). The new lines of investigation begin to show how this works for objects. 
 Petrelli, Whittaker and colleagues from Shefﬁ eld approached this question from 
the perspective of what they call  mementos : ‘an object given or deliberately kept as 
a reminder of a person, place or event’ (Petrelli et al.  2008 ). They carried out a 
single study of mementos kept by 12 families with children in the north of England 
to see how they served to map the memories and identities of individual family 
members amongst the ecology of other objects within the home. The methodology 
8 External Research

193
involved taking a tour of the home with each participating family member, and ask-
ing them to identify public, family and personal rooms in the house and select at 
least three objects from each type of room that they considered ‘special’. Participants 
explained their choices and reasoning as they went along and were asked further 
questions about special digital objects in a ﬁ nal phase of the home visits. Three 
related papers documented different analyses of the data, focusing on physical 
mementos (Petrelli et al.  2008 ), the contrast between physical and digital mementos 
(Petrelli and Whittaker  2010 ), and photo mementos (Petrelli et al.  2014 ). While a 
full summary of this work is beyond the scope of this review, I will now highlight 
some signiﬁ cant ﬁ ndings on the relationships between photos and other objects as 
memory triggers, and the contrast between physical and digital mementos. 
 One of the most striking ﬁ ndings to emerge from the study was the sheer diver-
sity of objects that came to have special meaning to people, and the idiosyncratic 
nature of those meanings. These included professional and self-made artwork, 
everyday objects like mugs, clocks, furniture, books and ornaments, functional and 
non-functional objects which are seldom used such as old children’s toys, diaries, 
receipts, jewellery and shells. The meaning of these objects related to their origin 
and history with participants, and often represented signiﬁ cant relationships with 
other key people, or periods of self-discovery, achievement and happiness. The ﬁ nd-
ings were reminiscent of those from a similar study of Chicago families carried out 
in the 1970s, and demonstrate the importance of sentimental personal possessions 
in everyday life (Csikszentmuhalyi and Rocheberg-Halton  1981 ). 
 Printed photographs around the home made up about 16 % of selected memen-
tos, and themselves took a variety of forms. These included framed photos placed 
on surfaces or mounted on the wall, as well as loose photos arranged in albums, 
pinned to boards, carefully made into collages, or stored in shoeboxes and other 
containers. Signiﬁ cantly, only one participant chose a digital object unprompted in 
the original tour of the home, revealing the hidden nature of most digital photos, 
video and other materials. Digital mementos were greatly appreciated according to 
the prompted discussions, but did not lend themselves to the same kind of distribu-
tion and display around the home. This led the authors to propose new technologies 
for integrating the digital with the physical, as in a  MemoryBook for storing elec-
tronic snippets of media with physical trinkets, or a  ProjectoFrame for projecting a 
collage of images on the wall from a physical photo display on a table (see Fig.  8.9 ). 
The creative act of assembling and crafting artefacts for remembering was taken 
further in a related study, also citing the audiophoto work. Petrelli et al. ( 2009 ) 
asked 10 families to make time capsules of their lives to be viewed 25 years in the 
future. Although this was a departure from the analysis of naturally occurring 
mementos in the home, the results showed a similar preference for physical artefacts 
which were actively selected or created to be expressive and personal.
 Sellen, Kirk and colleagues at Microsoft Research approached the question of 
domestic iconography from the slightly different perspective of home archiving 
(Kirk and Sellen  2010 ). Skeptical of the argument for life logging technologies to 
record human experiences in ever increasing detail, the authors look to existing 
practices of collecting objects and capturing media in the home for clues about the 
8.7 Audio Artifacts

194
role of such artefacts in everyday life. They also apply these ﬁ ndings to the design 
of new home-based archiving systems. Taking a more sociological view than 
Petrelli and colleagues, they explored how and why families keep sentimental 
objects and media in their homes. A similar methodology was used with 11 UK 
families at different stages of family life, invited to discuss special objects during a 
home tour. This time participants were asked to cover every room in the house and 
mention any items of sentimental value, which were photographed for detailed dis-
cussion in a second home visit. They were also prompted to identify special digital 
artefacts around key electronic devices such as the home computer, and given time 
in the follow-up visit to reﬂ ect explicitly on the differences between their physical 
and digital collections. 
 Analysis of the types of artefacts discussed, revealed two new categories lying 
between three dimensional physical objects and digital media. These included so 
called ‘ 2  1  / 2 D ’ items such as paper documents, letters, certiﬁ cates, cards and cuttings, 
and ‘ hybrid ’ (analogue) media objects such as vinyl records, audio cassettes, CDs 
and DVDs. Furthermore, a classiﬁ cation of the function of objects across all catego-
ries showed six core values of home archiving:
•  Deﬁ ning the self – items reﬂ ecting the personality and history of individual 
members of the family (e.g. a Bay City Rollers book or old university work) 
 Fig. 8.9   ProjectoFrame prototype (Petrelli et al.  2014 ) (Reprinted with permission) 
 
8 External Research

195
•  Honouring those we care about – items displayed to celebrate the achieve-
ments or identity of signiﬁ cant others in the family (e.g. pictures of grandchil-
dren, artwork by children) 
•  Connecting with the past  – items demonstrating a link to past events or people 
(e.g. a grandmother’s jam recipe book, a stone from a beach)  
•  Framing the family – items showing what kind of family lives in the home (e.g. 
artwork in public rooms, family photographs)  
•  Fulﬁ lling duty  – items important to family roles (e.g. adoptive children’s toys, 
photographs of distant or deceased relatives) 
•  Forgetting – upsetting items too precious to throw away (e.g. boxes of old let-
ters, old email messages) 
 Drawing on these ﬁ ndings and their implications for design, Kirk et al. ( 2010 ) 
and Sellen ( 2011 ) report the design and use of a  Family Archive  device which aims 
to allow families to integrate their physical and digital artifacts in the digital realm. 
In effect they implemented and tested an earlier design concept by Stevens et al. 
( 2003 ) for a  Living Memory Box through which to scan and store photographs of 3D 
and 2 1 / 2 D physical objects alongside digitized and digital media. The  Family Archive 
was implemented as a waist-height touch-sensitive tabletop display. It also con-
tained an overhead camera for scanning documents and objects into virtual shoe-
boxes which appear to be ﬂ oating beneath the table surface. A 1 month trial of the 
system by three households showed uneven use of digital media uploading and 
scanning functions by different family members, with mixed reaction to scanning. 
Some items such as sweet wrappers didn’t scan well, producing disappointment, 
while others such as a 6 year old boy’s dinosaur collection did, producing delight. 
Serious archiving of precious objects was accompanied by playful scanning of 
unusual objects such as one family’s new kittens. The system raised questions about 
gender roles for archiving and long term compatibility with other devices such as 
the home PC. Reﬂ ecting on the lessons of this research, Sellen ( 2011 ) pointed out 
the importance of iterative development and testing of domestic technology, with 
attention to family dynamics and relationships. She also went on to promote physi-
cal augmentation as an alternative approach to digitizing physical objects. This 
involves augmenting physical objects with digital data, as in the  Memory Box 
(Frohlich and Murphy  2000 ). Shoebox is one such system explored by the Microsoft 
group to browse photograph sets as represented in an adapted slide transparency 
box (Banks and Sellen  2009 ). Running a ﬁ nger along the top of the stack displays 
the corresponding photo set on an integral display on the front face of the box (see 
Fig.  8.10 ). Further explorations of this kind are reported in Banks ( 2011 ).
 Although audio is not explicitly represented in many of the design concepts and 
prototypes emerging from both strands of work above, physical artefacts are shown 
to be powerful triggers for memory, and symbols for other social acts within the 
family. As such they attract comment and conversation around them in a way which 
goes beyond the original audiophoto medium, into live storytelling and 
performance.

8.8  Connections Between Research Strands 
 In the last chapter we saw how the original audiophotography work was followed up 
inside HP, through research and development activities designed to maximise the 
impact on HP products. This sometimes resulted in the attempted transfer of new 
technology ideas to domains outside photography, as in demonstrations of location- 
based services (e.g. Hull and Reid  2003 ), or in the application of design ideas to new 
technology platforms such as web services (e.g. Rajani and Vorbau  2004 ). Conscious 
attempts to stimulate open innovation through collaborations with academic groups 
were only partially successful from HPs point of view. They opened up the design 
space for audiophoto products and services, but in a way which was difﬁ cult to map 
to existing HP products and plans. In this chapter, we have seen this happening in 
even more stark contrast to HP company interests, through independent research 
carried out at other universities and companies. A major ﬁ nding of this review is 
that this external research has been focused mainly within the domain of domestic 
photography and its three core values of supporting memory, communication and 
identity (Van Dijck  2008 ).

 This can be seen in part from the tree diagram of Fig.  8.1 summarising the six 
strands of new research citing the original work. A deeper understanding of the 
properties of sound, paper and memorabilia for memory is given by the audiograph 
and tangible audio research strands. Research into audiophoto messages and narra-
tives is all about communication through audiovisual storytelling, while context 
photography deals with the stimuli and dynamics of experience capture, and the 
way it can represent the identity of individuals and communities. Many additional 
design and technology ideas were developed across these categories, but most deal 
with support for what we later called ‘domestic iconography’, broadly deﬁ ned 
(Frohlich and Fennell  2007 ). 
 Elaborating further, the research generated a range of new insights relating to the 
role of sound and sound-image combinations, beyond those suggested in the origi-
nal audiophotography work. In general these were supportive of the audiophotogra-
phy vision, but served to extend it into new territories of application, markets and 
technologies. 
 For example, the audiophoto message and narrative work served to highlight the 
value of image sequences with accompanying sound and text, as a new form of 
communication on a mobile phone. This was seen to have great value in non- 
Western cultures with stronger oral storytelling traditions. Work on the audio con-
text for photography took this emphasis on the sequential environment for 
photography further. It ﬁ rst showed the value of very high quality binaural record-
ings before and after a photograph is taken, and the need to animate images through 
pan and zoom effects when accompanying sound clips are long (Bitton et al.  2004 ). 
It also raised new possibilities for triggering image capture from sound events and 
even modifying the quality of the image itself to reﬂ ect aspects of the sonic and 
movement context of capture (Ljungblad et al.  2004 ). Audio context was also 
shown to be useful in making photographs more accessible for sight impaired users 
(Harada et al.  2013 ). 
 Further details on the properties of sound for memory emerged from research on 
sonic gems and souvenirs, with accompanying design ideas for how to capture and 
browse sound clips  without associated photographs (e.g. Oleksik et al.  2008 ; Petrelli 
et al.  2010 ). Finally, new insights on the value of printed photos or other materials 
as interfaces to sound and memory, emerged from work on audiopaper and audioar-
tifacts. Essentially, physical items can come to have sentimental associations for 
people, and can serve as accessible triggers for sonic memories and information, 
especially for those less familiar with modern screen-based technologies (e.g. Kirk 
and Sellen  2010 ; Piper et al.  2013 ; Robinson et al.  2014 ). 
 In addition to these substantive new ﬁ ndings on audiophotography and related 
practices, the research in this chapter also calls attention to the human factors of 
research and innovation in a scientiﬁ c context. This is illustrated here by the fact that 
relatively few research groups are involved in developing this work, and many of the 
individual researchers have a history of collaboration within or between groups. 
 At one level this is not so surprising, since members of the scientiﬁ c commu-
nity from both industry and academia meet like-minded people at conferences 
and workshops, and read their work. They may also enter into joint research bids, 
8.8 Connections Between Research Strands

 projects and PhD supervision, in areas of shared interest. What is perhaps more 
 surprising here is the extent of these collaborations across a single research area, 
and the level of history that builds up between individuals and groups over time. 
Hence, in the 10 year span of research reviewed above, many individuals have 
conducted not one but several projects together as can be seen in the patterns of 
direct co- authorship shown in the reference list for this chapter. Often this is 
within groups such as the Microsoft Research Cambridge (MSRC) partnerships 
of Sellen/Kirk/Banks/Lindley/Taylor, the UCSD team of Piper/Weibel/Hollan, or 
the Swansea team of Jones/Robinson/Pearson. At other times it is between indi-
viduals at different groups such as the UTS-Shefﬁ eld collaboration between van 
den Hoven and Petrelli/Whittaker, or my own collaborations from Surrey with the 
MSRC and Swansea teams above. Furthermore, most individuals in this commu-
nity have moved institution at least once between 2004 and 2014/2015, with 
many travelling to join others with the same interests or continuing their own 
research strand with new colleagues. This can be seen in the movement of Oleksik 
from Surrey to MSRC, of Whittaker from Shefﬁ eld to UCSC, of Lindley from 
York to MSRC, and so on. 
 The timing of these collaborations and movements is deeply signiﬁ cant for 
the development of work in the ﬁ eld. Most studies are not one-off pieces of 
research by individuals, but have a history for  each co-author, and set up trajec-
tories for future research. Therefore a collaboration can merge two or more 
viewpoints and previous research strands in exciting ways, and a job move can 
inject new expertise or ideas into a team. To give one example from my own 
experience, the sonic interventions project between Surrey and MSRC was excit-
ing because it brought to bear Gerard Oleksik’s sociological approach to domes-
tic soundscapes together with MSRCs interests and expertise in domestic 
technology design; resulting in a raft of new design concepts and patent ﬁ lings. 
At the end of his contract for this work, Gerard then moved to MSRC to carry out 
a follow-up study of one of these concepts, Sonic Gems, with Lorna Brown. 
Again the combination of a sociologist and computer scientist working together 
on a new media innovation was a great recipe for unique work which could not 
have been done by either party alone. This work in turn triggered a response and 
further development of ideas on ‘sonic souvenirs’ by the Shefﬁ eld team of Dib/
Petrelli/Whittaker within a couple of years. 
 The fact that many of these lines of research can pass between groups in this way, 
and pass back again further down the line, leads to a kind of scientiﬁ c arms race. 
However, unlike weapons development, scientiﬁ c advances are shared openly in 
annual conferences and publications, fueling faster turnover of studies and design 
ideas.  Fast design is therefore a consequence of the free exchange of people and 
ideas within a scientiﬁ c culture, and can be seen as a kind of fuel for innovation 
which seems to proceed at a slower pace. In the next chapter, we turn to the classes 
of innovation in audiophotography that typify today’s market, before reﬂ ecting on 
the interplay between research and development, design and innovation at the end 
of the book.

 External Development 
 The digital photographer potentially will be so thoroughly 
linked to a multiplicity of media, both as recipient and producer, 
that communication of whatever kind becomes more important 
than the singularity of the photographic vision. (Ritchin  2009 , 
pp. 145–146) 
9.1  Product Design Space 
 In 2004, the only way to conveniently record audiophotographs was on an HP 
Photosmart camera, or on a ‘feature phone’ with MMS. Most other methods 
involved capturing images and sound clips separately and assembling them into 
combinations or narrative sequences in video editing software. A few other models 
of digital cameras or camcorders supported the annotation of photographs with 
voice labels, and photo browsing software sometimes allowed users to play a slide-
show of photographs with accompanying sound. But these uses barely scratched the 
surface of the aesthetic and affective possibilities afforded by the audiophoto 
medium, as described in Part I of this book. As we have also seen in Chap.   7 , the 
lack of a widespread standard for encoding audiophotos meant that the embedded 
sound JPG used by HP cameras was not interoperable with other devices or ser-
vices. These particular audiophotos could not be sent by email or Bluetooth to other 
people for playback, or posted on a website in a form that would play. 
 In July 2015 as I write this chapter, the audiophoto product landscape is very dif-
ferent. Three signiﬁ cant classes of innovation have created new possibilities for cap-
turing and sharing audiophotos in different forms, and new combinations of image 
and sound are now supported outside the photography domain. Innovations include 
3G and 4G smartphones with downloadable multimedia apps, tablets of all shapes 
and sizes providing a new platform for photo and video browsing, and social net-
working sites like Facebook and Twitter which support collaborative multimedia ﬁ le 
exchange. Furthermore, developments in augmented reality and printed electronics 
are leading to the maturation of a number of audiopaper products featuring photo-
graphs and sound. Finally, the falling costs of data storage together with the increas-
ing rates of data transmission, now mean that audiophotos can be encoded and 
shared in  video format without compromising the use of a camera or camera 

204
 functions on portable devices. This makes audiophotographs or audiophoto narra-
tives a kind of video genre, which is suddenly compatible with all video enabled 
devices and services. 
 In the rest of this Part I brieﬂ y review the  kinds of audiophoto products available 
in various technology categories, using current products as examples. These prod-
ucts will date quickly or become obsolete in due course, because of the fast turnover 
of software and hardware in the computer industry. However, the classes of product 
may change and evolve more slowly, and begin to indicate the different social con-
texts in which audiophotographs are entering the cultural consciousness. Since most 
examples are taken from technology-rich Western cultures, this review is biased 
geographically and culturally towards the global North/West. Given the promising 
uses of audiovisual expression in developing communities, as described in Sect.   8.3 
above, it would be interesting to compare this review with one generated from 
within the global South/East. 
 Regarding the technology categories which follow, I begin with camera and cam-
corder products supporting audiophoto capture, before reviewing two kinds of apps 
for smartphones and tablets. Audiopaper products are then reviewed before a ﬁ nal 
discussion of the relationships between categories. 
9.2  Cameras and Camcorders 
 Somewhat ironically, current cameras and camcorders provide the least support of 
all product categories for audiophotography today. In initial phone enquiries to a 
number of major dealers in the UK, I was told that they have no products supporting 
sound and photo combinations. Furthermore, early web searches for cameras with 
sound resulted in sites containing recordings of mechanical shutter noises. 
Interestingly, an early discovery from these searches was of surveillance cameras 
with sound, and the  Boriyuan spy clock (23 July  2015 ) which uses motion and 
sound detection to trigger silent video capture from a hidden camera. This is a com-
mercial application of the context photography paradigm and the Other Brother 
prototype of Sects.   8.4 and   8.5 above, although not for the aesthetic or sentimental 
purposes they propose. 
 However, further feedback from more knowledgeable sales staff, online forums 
and colleagues, revealed a number of digital cameras with voice annotation features 
or hybrid photo-video modes. Some of these are reviewed by Chesler ( 2015 ) in an 
online magazine called Opposing Views. They include the following models and 
features:
•  Casio Exilim series cameras – several models have Dictaphone capabilities for 
monoaural voice recording from a rear-facing microphone (e.g. EX-S6SR, EX- 
G1RD). The intended user model appears to be voice note dictation in between 
photo and video capture, to remind users of locations they have visited or to 
capture lectures or meetings in pictures-then-sounds.

•  Nikon COOLPIX series cameras – support both Dictaphone voice recording and 
Voice Memo functions for annotating individual photographs with a voice label 
of up to 20 s (e.g. COOLPIX S9).  
•  Ricoh RDC and  Caplio series cameras – support Voice Memo features on photo-
graphs. These can be played back from images on the camera itself, or sound 
clips can be exported separately as WAV ﬁ les. They also support general purpose 
Voice Recording (e.g. Caplio G3 and G4). 
•  Samsung cameras – support both Voice Recorder and Voice Memo functions 
with up to 10 h capacity or 10 s/photo (e.g. TL105 and PL200 respectively). 
 Since it is becoming popular to take short video clips on digital SLRs, a number of 
cameras now support still image capture from  within a video recording (e.g.  Canon 
EOS 750D ). This hybrid video/still mode has the potential to record audio but this has 
not yet been realised by manufacturers. They appear to take the technical point of 
view that if you are going to record ambient sound you might as well do it with mov-
ing image rather than still image. However, as Chap.   2 shows, there are other aesthetic, 
psychological and social reasons to record ambient audiophotos rather than video, and 
this capability could be a new media option that consumers may appreciate. 
 In short, the support for audiophotography on cameras and camcorders has 
changed little in the last 10 years. Essentially it is missing, or relegated to specialist 
sound recording or annotation features which are not seen as central to the capture 
of photographs or video clips.  
9.3  Audiocamera Apps 
 In stark contrast with the conservatism of digital camera design, the app market is 
brimming with innovations in multimedia capture and editing. Many of these support 
audiophotography, either through simple  audiocamera apps focusing on sound and 
image capture, or through  audiophoto narrative apps supporting sound and image 
combination of various kinds. This distinction is similar to that between simple 
audiophoto messages and more complex audiophoto narratives described in Chap.   8 . 
There is a tendancy for the audiocamera apps to be designed for smartphones and the 
narrative apps to be designed for tablets, although many apps can be installed on both 
platforms. Because of competition between mobile operating systems, there are dif-
ferent types of audiophoto apps for Apple, Android, and Microsoft devices. None 
have yet been developed for Amazon devices. In the rest of this Part I will review 
audiocamera apps, leaving audiophoto narrative apps for the next section. 
 At the time of writing this chapter in July 2015, there are at least 20 audiocamera 
apps on the market. Their names, platforms and tag-lines are shown in Table  9.1 .
 Seven apps are implemented for both Android and Apple devices, six are exclu-
sive to Apple, ﬁ ve are exclusive to Android, one is exclusive to Windows and one is 
for Android and Windows. By far the majority of audiocamera apps are focused on 
supporting the kind of talking photos described in Chap.   4 . These have names like 
9.3 Audiocamera Apps

206
 Speaking Photo, PicSpeak, Talking Photos, Talking Pictures, Photo Speaks and so 
on. They are usually simple 1:1 image-to-sound associations designed to be shared 
on social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter or Facebook. The duration of 
sound recording is usually kept low, and ranges between 5 and 30 s. Two of these 
apps,  Incerts Snap and  Chatter Pix are designed for teachers and young children 
respectively for justifying assessments or bringing iPad pictures and images to life. 
The  Talking Pictures app in this category is unusual in supporting multiple (1: 
many) image-to-sound associations from up to ten touch regions of a single photo. 
The  RIXA app is also unusual in putting emphasis on the ‘audio greeting’ ﬁ rst, and 
inviting image annotation to illustrate a spoken message. Finally, the  Photo Speaks 
app is particularly innovative in converting a photograph into an animated ‘3D’ 
avatar, who speaks the voice message associated with the photo.

 Four apps are designed primarily for ambient sound capture around an image 
event, as in Chap.   2 . These include  Voisnap, Audio Photos Free, Photo 360 and 
 Foundbite . This all allow the image capture event to take place within or alongside 
the sound recording. For example, in  Voisnap , the audio recording is started ﬁ rst 
before the photo is taken, and stopped manually or automatically after 30 s. In 
 Photo 360 , sound is recorded during the rotation of the smartphone through 360° as 
a panoramic photo is taken. 
 Only one app in Table  9.1 is focused on supporting musical photographs for 
sharing, as in Chap.   3 .  Tunepics recognises the emotional power of music in its’ 
tagline, and allows users of iTunes music to pair tracks with personal photographs 
as well as provided artwork. 
 No apps in this category support the recording of conversational photo-talk on 
photographs, as in Chap.   5 . However, an approximation of this is supported through 
asynchronous sharing of talking photos on social media sites where verbal discus-
sion threads may build up. This is also an explicit aim of certain audiophoto narra-
tive apps, as shown in Table  9.2 and discussed in the next section.

9.4  Audiophoto Narrative Apps 
 Table  9.2 shows 18 example audiophoto narrative apps, found at the time of writing. 
All of these apps go beyond the early PC and Mac software to set photo or video 
slideshows to music, and make more or less sophisticated efforts to incorporate 
voiceover and ambient sound as well. For example,  Flipagram allows you to set a 
photo series to a music backing  or to a voiceover narration, but not both. It does 
however allow the incorporation of short video clips in the series, along with photo-
graphs, resulting in a kind of photo/video slideshow with sound. A typical user 
model for adding music is to associate the whole image series with a music track 
and set a duration for the show or each image presentation. A typical user model for 
adding voiceover is to manually advance the image series during voiceover record-
ing. The insertion of video or other sound clips will usually result in automatic 
adjustment of the duration of associated visuals. This is easier using a frame-by- 
frame organisation as in our own  Com-Phone app, where up to three layers of sound 
(for ambient, voiceover and music) can be overlaid on a single image (see again 
Fig.   8.2 ). These are mixed from a single starting point and play out to the length of 
the longest clip. In fact  Com-Phone is a kind of cross-over audiocamera/audiophoto 
narrative app, which allows the recording of single audiophoto or multiple audio-
photos in sequence on a smartphone, so that ambient sound can be recorded at the 
same time as each image. Otherwise ambient sound has to be recorded separately at 
image capture time and imported into the narrative apps later. 
 A number of differing contexts and motivations are evident for the apps in 
Table  9.2 and these affect the way in which multimedia narratives are supported and 
shared. Four distinct value propositions can be seen in the description of apps and 
can be used to roughly classify them as follows:
•  Improved memories of life –  Roxio MediaBook, Memory Box Stories, Appture, 
Shared Impressions 
•  Better storytelling over photographs –  Story Maker, Com-Phone, Pixengo, 
Clipagram, Blurb Mobile 
•  Clearer explanations –  Explain Everything, Adobe Voice, Shadow Puppet, 
Educreations 
•  Richer conversations –  Flipagram, Shuttersong, Brabble, U Messenger, 
Digisocial 
 The memory-oriented apps seek to bring photos to life mainly through voice nar-
ration. For example,  Memory Box Stories encourages users to select a sequence of 
photos and record up to 5 min of narration which is later synchronized to the photos. 
It also suggests family reminiscing activities in which old photographs are re- 
captured (digitized) with stories from parents. The book or album metaphor often 
underlies these apps, as with the  Roxio MediaBook which uses professional tem-
plates for layout of photographs and numerous transition effects.  Appture also intro-
duces location details as a way of capturing special journeys or travelogues. These 
apps are intended to generate rich multimedia accounts of private experiences 
9 External Development

209
within a family or small group, as suggested by the description of  Shared Impressions , 
and the emphasis on secure photo sharing in  Appture . 
 While the memory-oriented apps are centred on reminiscing, the story-oriented 
apps are centred on storytelling. These apps use similar techniques to tell a multi-
media story to a wider audience, and emphasise verbal storytelling as the central 
component. Hence,  Story Maker is a journalistic tool designed by The Guardian 
Project to help mobile/citizen journalists capture secure and compelling stories in 
pictures, video and sound. It uses story templates and has links to a “55 lesson 
course in Journalism, Security, Photo, Audio, and Video production”.  Com-Phone, 
Pixengo and  Clipagram seek to support successively less sophisticated effects for a 
consumer market. They do this in simpler ways that still enable users to narrate over 
single or multiple photo sequences, which may or may not be annotated with text or 
other sounds.  Blurb Mobile is an interesting variation on these apps, coming as it 
does from Blurb’s background in the self-publishing of print or e-books (  http://
www.blurb.co.uk/ ). The app can be seen as a supporting a kind of multimedia pho-
tobook or photo essay with up to eight photos, a 30 s audio clip per photo and a 10 s 
video clip per story. 
 Four explanation-oriented apps lie outside the domestic photography mar-
ket altogether.  Adobe Voice is directed to the business presentation market while 
 Explain Everything, Shadow Puppet (Edu) and  Educreations are directed to the 
education market. In fact Adobe Voice was described in one on-line article as “A 
happy app for making explainer videos”, since it is radically simpler than other 
Adobe software such as Photoshop, and can be used to explain just about anything 
(Pogue  2014 ). Users are prompted to start with a verbal explanation of their idea or 
concept and illustrate it with stock photographs and music before choosing a visual 
theme.  Shadow Puppet is a simpler version of this without access to stock photos 
and music, which tries to handle both music and voiceover across a series of images. 
Its  Edu  version is promoted to teachers and pupils for creating classroom materials 
or allowing children to express themselves in multimedia stories.  Educreations and 
 Explain Everything have a different interactive whiteboard metaphor and user 
model, for allowing concepts to be explained in real time through mash ups of back-
ground images, text and handwritten annotations with sound effects and voiceover. 
 Finally, ﬁ ve audiophoto narrative apps attempt to start audiophoto social net-
works or introduce audiophotos into existing ones. For example,  Digisocial bills 
itself as a new ‘revolutionary voice social network’. It has been likened by com-
mentators to be a photo sharing website like Instagram, but with the possibility of 
audio as well as text annotation (e.g. Davison  2013 ). This option is carried through 
to responses on posts to the  Digisocial website, so that audio discussions and threads 
can build up on audiophotos themselves. I count these as new kind of audiophoto 
narrative in which the narrative builds up in audio form on a single photo, in an 
asynchronous version of the conversational photographs of Chap.   5 .  Shuttersong is 
similar, while  Brabble generalizes the approach to support the sharing of standard 
photo, video, text and audio ﬁ les with ‘brabbleback’ commentary in any of these 
formats.  U Messenger lies somewhere between  Shuttersong and  Brabble in support-
ing a range of audiophoto posts, but in the context of organizing live photo chats 
9.4 Audiophoto Narrative Apps

with small groups of friends or family who can discuss and further annotate online 
materials.  Flipagram does not yet support its own social network as such, but pro-
motes the sharing of audio photo/video narratives to other social networks like 
YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Vine. However it is pro-
moting the approach on its own website and through  Flipagram pages and commu-
nities on other networks (  http://ﬂ ipagram.com/  ). 
9.5  Audioprint Products 
 Perhaps one of the biggest changes in domestic photographic practice brought about 
by the digital revolution is a movement away from printing photographs. Certainly 
the routine printing of photographs to view them has now gone, since they can be 
viewed on the originating camera or smartphone immediately and at zero cost, and 
then sent to a variety of other screen-based viewing devices such as desktop com-
puters, televisions, tablets and photo displays. Initially this was done as a device-to- 
device (peer-to-peer) communication, but it is now done increasingly as an internet 
transaction in which photographs are posted on photo websites or social networking 
sites to be accessed remotely. In writing about this in 2011, Risto Sarvas and I 
pointed to a transition from the Kodak era of photography (“you press the button 
and we do the rest”) to a Digital era in which printing becomes a more reﬂ ective and 
selective activity (Sarvas and Frohlich  2011 ). Interestingly, this is now enabled by a 
new raft of digital print services tied to online collections and albums, including 
photobook printing by companies such as PhotoBox. 
 All this is relevant to the product landscape of what I call ‘audioprint products’, 
for playing back sounds from printed photos. It turns out that this not only mirrors 
the history of analogue to digital photography in many ways, but it also anticipates 
what may be a new analogue/digital or Post-Digital era. This is because the market 
contains legacy audiophoto frames, cards and albums designed to allow manual 
recording of sounds with printed photos, but is also starting to support online speci-
ﬁ cation of audiphotos to similar devices. Furthermore, the rise of augmented reality 
techniques for tagging real-world objects or locations with digital content is just 
starting to be applied to printed images to fetch associated sounds or video. In fact, 
services like  Blippar described below, directly implement the audiophoto desk tech-
nique of recognising a printed image to playback associated content. This begins to 
realize an ‘internet of things’ vision for photography, linking ordinary photobooks 
and other printed photo outputs to audio content and players lying outside the paper 
itself. 
 Different generations of audioprint products can be illustrated by stepping 
through the history above. These essentially co-exist today, given that analogue 
photography remains a niche practice. Figures  9.1 ,  9.2 , and  9.3 represent solutions 
in the Kodak, Digital and Post-Digital eras respectively, using photograph albums as 
an example print output. Similar activities apply to other audioprint outputs such as 
talking photo frames and recordable greeting cards. Hence Fig.  9.1 shows the pho-

towork activities involved in assembling a conventional and so called ‘Talking photo 
album’ based on ﬁ lm photography. Essentially, analogue camera ﬁ lm is developed 
and printed as loose prints, which are then inserted into the transparent sleeves of a 
photo album. Talking photo albums simply instruments these albums with electron-
ics to capture and playback sounds from individual pages, recorded manually into 
the album during assembly. A wide variety of blank  Talking photo albums of this 
kind can currently be bought for about £20 or £30, from companies such as 
Brookstone, Talking products, EKKO, TTS and Talking Albums. Some of these 
companies such as Alz Products, Liberator and Inclusive Technology promote these 
products for use with people suffering memory loss or experiencing communication 
problems. Other instantiations of this technology are designed for single photos to 
be displayed in  Talking photo frames or sent as  Recordable greetings cards . Many 
of the same companies are involved, or others such as Sound Expressions special-
izing in the card market. Sound Expressions sell a wide variety of talking paper 
formats including greeting cards, envelopes, postcards and toys. They also sell 
adhesive sound module inserts to stick onto existing cards. The variety of products 
is now great than in 2004 and the quality of solution better at the high end of the 
range. This is because the digital audio technology embedded in these products has 
advanced in recent years, but also because the use model still ﬁ ts with digital pho-
tography as shown in Fig.  9.2 .
 The use of a digital camera or cameraphone instead of an analogue camera, still 
allows consumers to print and assemble conventional and talking photo albums,

frame and cards as before. This is shown on the left hand side of Fig.  9.2 , which 
shows that manual assembly is now enabled by a digital print service or self- printing 
of photographs at home. The big transformation shown in this diagram is the pres-
ence of on-line photo content assembly. This can lead either to on-line posting to a 
photowebsite or social networking service, or to speciﬁ cation of a printed  photo-
book via an on-line print service. A big difference between these two options is cost, 
with photobooks being expensive and on-line posting being free, or at least cheaper 
if extended cloud storage is involved. Hence printing has become more selective 
than online posting. Typical photobook services are provided by companies such as 
Photobox, Snapﬁ sh, Bob Books, PhotoLeaf, Yo Photo and Artesan State. Many of 
these companies also sell alternative print outputs such as personalized greeting 
cards, posters, t-shirts, mugs and so on, while others are specialized in a subset of 
these (e.g. MoonPig for personalized cards and gifts). Note that audioprint products 
are supported in this era, but not in a way that is compatible with the emerging 
audiophoto camera apps and audiophoto narrative apps described in previous sec-
tions. For this we need to look to Fig.  9.3 . 
 Full audiophoto capture is shown at the top of Fig.  9.3 and is shown to lead 
directly to on-line audiophoto content assembly. This can result in on-line audio-
photo album display on a variety of non-specialist services such as YouTube, 
Facebook and Twitter, or specialist ones such as Digisocial, Shuttersong, U 
Messenger or Brabble. It can also result in speciﬁ cation of a printed photobook with 
associated sound. In principle, this could take the form of a conventional Talking 
photo album or card populated with content from the online version. Sound 
Expressions and EKKO seem to have some provision for online design of certain 
promotional cards in their range. However, the market seems to have moved to an

easier solution based on straightforward printing of photobooks or cards with QR 
codes or other tags to invoke associated sound playback on a smartphone. This aug-
mented reality solution is represented in several services such as Shutterﬂ y’s  Photo 
Story book. This comes with an iPad app through which to create the album with up 
to 30 s of narration per page. Users can then send off for the printed photobook ver-
sion which has QR codes on each page which then play the sound on the scanning 
device (Dove  2013 ). 
 As before, this solution also applies to other print formats such as cards and post-
ers with services such as HP Live Photos mentioned at the end of Chap.   7  , which 
allows consumers to print index shots of video clips which trigger video playback 
on a smartphone. Moon Pig and Blippar have similar apps for consumer and com-
mercial advertising markets respectively, and work by recognising the image itself 
rather than a tag on the image. In contrast,  Tap For Message is a company and ser-
vice based on the sale of greeting stickers than can be attached to any package or 
card, and associated with online audio or video content via a smartphone. Stickers 
contain near ﬁ eld communication (NFC) tags which are recognised by certain 
smartphones, and legacy printed QR and URLs for non-NFC enabled phones. 
 An interesting hybrid product that approximates the self-contained photobook of 
Fig.  9.3 , is a new kind of ‘Videocard’ with integral LCD panel and speakers. This is 
supplied by a number of companies including Spreengs, Vidioh and TQR cards. For 
example, the Spreengs video card currently sells for £20–30 and contains an embed-
ded display of between 2.4″ and 7″ in the right hand side of an opened greeting card 
with 165 MB of embedded storage. It can play either video clips or photo slide-
shows with music. The content can be transferred to the card via a mini USB cable 
from a laptop (‘You card it!’) or speciﬁ ed online for the card to be made and mailed 
to its recipient (‘We card it!’). Although designed for conventional video content, it 
could display audiophoto narrative content just as well, to bring digital stories to the 
printed page.

9.6  Discussion 
 The development of new technology products and services is a vibrant area which 
often appears to progress in a piecemeal fashion, by constantly seeking novelty in 
functionality and design. However, by reviewing developments in one particular 
area over a 10 or 11 year period, we have seen that these experiments are under-
pinned by bigger changes in computing infrastructure and driven by growing con-
sumer interest in particular types of information or media experiences. In the case 
of audiophotography products and services, they have been hugely inﬂ uenced by 
the development of the world wide web itself and the practice of sharing media on 
social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. The posting of photographs for 
textual comment has become a widespread practice in the West, which audiophoto 
products must ﬁ t into. In addition, the emergence of smartphones and tablets with 
their corresponding app model of evolution has inﬂ uenced the way in which sounds 
and images can be captured and shared, compared with the more camera-oriented 
model that was the subject of the Audiophotography book of 2004. This led us to 
three major discoveries about the development of products in this area. 
 First, we found that innovation in the capture of audiophotos on digital cameras 
and camcorders has stagnated, compared with the explosion of audiophoto-related 
apps for smartphones and tablets. The latter products are competing across multiple 
platforms to establish a new user model for attaching simple voiceovers or ambient 
sounds to individual images (in audiocamera apps) or assembling audiophoto slide-
shows to tell visual stories with all kinds of sound (in audiophoto narrative apps). 
These can usually be posted on the web as a kind of  video , for textual comment in 
the usual way. The sophistication and complexity of audiovisual capture and editing 
distinguishes one app from another, and probably serves a diverse market of users 
who want more or less control over the process. This appears to mirror the differ-
ences between various point-and-shoot, compact zoom and digital SLR cameras 
themselves, which offer more or less control over the process of image capture. The 
fact that these cameras cannot support audiophotography in the same way as the 
apps, constitutes a product opportunity in its own right. Camera and camcorder 
manufacturers would do well to attend to the developments we have reviewed and 
consider incorporating some of them in their products. Since they already have a 
portfolio of products varying in complexity for different user groups, they could 
support audiophotography at different levels of complexity across this range. 
 A second discovery of the review is that a battle seems to be raging over the way 
in which audiophoto materials are shared over the web. Different formats for audio-
photos still exist, making them more or less simple to share on existing photoweb-
sites or social networking sites. Those which are stored in video format are the 
easiest to share, while those stored in specialist multi-ﬁ le or slideshow formats 
require their own sites. This has led some companies like Digisocial to position 
audiophotos as a new social media form with a dedicated network, whereas others 
like Flipagram are attempting to stimulate community formation within or across 
other platforms. Whichever model takes hold, the sharing of audiophoto material 
9 External Development

215
over the web is already well underway and is only likely to increase in the future as 
people realize that they can add sounds to photographs for special effect or create 
video-like presentations out of still images and sound. As with many other forms of 
specialist media production, this may lead to an online community of practice in 
which tips and techniques are shared and inspirational material is exhibited. 
 A ﬁ nal discovery of the review is that printed audiophotos are enjoying a resur-
gence through twin developments in printed electronics and augmented reality. 
These embody hybrid physical/digital interactions within an emerging internet of 
things. Hence, physical multimedia documents can be speciﬁ ed online and printed 
as a service like photobooks (digital-to-physical). Alternatively they can be printed 
with markers, tags or recognised visually to cause associated sound to play on an 
adjunct device (physical-to-digital). This is why the future era for digital photogra-
phy might be called Post-Digital, because context and behaviours will not reside in 
the digital realm alone, but be distributed across digital and physical artifacts, 
including paper. In this domain it may result in a resurgence of printed photographs 
with digital ‘connections’, and an eventual spillover into the world of objects and 
souvenirs. Experimental activity of this kind has been evident in the research litera-
ture for some time, as described in Chaps.   7 and   8 , but is now emerging into the 
commercial market. This is the long nose of innovation in action again (Buxton 
 2008 ), bringing audiophotography closer to a mass-market practice, but not in the 
forms envisaged at earlier stages of its development. This miss-match between early 
designs and later innovations runs through the entire audiophotography case study, 
and will now be discussed in the ﬁ nal chapter of the book.

 Lessons 
10.1  Introduction 
 In the high tech computer industry, products themselves evolve at a tremendous 
rate. Anything more than about 3 years old is probably in need of an ‘upgrade’, and 
the mindset of the industry is ever forward-looking in search of the next big thing. 
In this book we have looked back over 10 years to some audio-enabled camera 
products from HP, and traced their obsolescence and subsequent re-emergence as 
smartphone and tablet apps by other companies. We have also seen the development 
of new scientiﬁ c understandings about the role of sound and pictures in communica-
tion and memory, through numerous research projects and prototypes. This has 
been a story of what it means from  inside the industry to try to research and develop 
the next big thing. In stark contrast to the speed with which products come and go, 
ideas and values appear remarkably stable. Furthermore, the process of realizing 
new values through technology is remarkably long, interconnected with other inno-
vations, and distributed across the globe. Individual products have a  history and 
provenance that usually stretches back many years, into the corporate research labs 
of other companies or university groups, and previous products in an evolutionary 
tree. This history is illuminating as an insight into how innovation actually works 
and what can be done to manage it better. 
 In this chapter I draw together some of the insights and lessons of the audiopho-
tography innovation story in three categories. First I review the lessons for audio-
photography itself, in terms of its’ value, practice and technology. Second, I discuss 
the lessons for innovation and how it seems to work at a practical and personal level 
in the new media area. Finally, I return to topic of fast design and slow innovation 
which framed the investigation, to comment on their relationship as it has been 
illustrated here. This involves a consideration of the links between research and 
development, and their implications for the research-practice gap as discussed by 
Norman ( 2010 ). I also consider some connections with movements promoting slow 
 What counts as an innovation is historically relative because 
they are constituted within particular technocultural formations. 
These formations emerge at certain historical moments in 
response to a wide range of inﬂ uences – economic, political, 
institutional – through interactions among people, between 
people and the matter of the world. (Balsamo  2011 , p. 8)

design and fast innovation. The book ﬁ nishes with some conclusions for the indus-
try and recommendations for those who work in it. 
10.2  Lessons for Audiophotography 
 The ﬁ ndings of the review have different implications for the value, practice and 
technology of audiophotography as interrelated facets of the subject. Let us con-
sider these in turn. 
 Regarding lessons on the value of combining sound with pictures, numerous 
studies both inside and outside HP have endorsed and extended the original claims. 
Small scale evaluations of various HP audiophoto systems such as  Active Photos 
(Kindberg et al.  2004 ),  MemoryNet Viewer (Rajani and Vorbau  2004 ),  StoryMail 
(Debaty et al.  2004 ) and the  Audiophoto Desk (Frohlich et al.  2004 ) were all posi-
tive and conﬁ rmed many of the values of sound in Part I of this book. For example, 
we saw that Lindley and Monks’ ( 2005 ) evaluation of the  Audiophoto Desk con-
ﬁ rmed the value of sound for adding fun, atmosphere and humour to photo sharing, 
and that music was particularly effective in enriching the activity without inhibiting 
the talk. 
 Other studies and systems reinforced the value of speciﬁ c types of sound for 
memory and storytelling. For example, studies of sonic gems and souvenirs showed 
that people have an audio memory for events which is triggered by  ambient sound 
recordings in a similar way to the triggering of visual memory by photographs (e.g. 
Oleksik et al.  2008 ; Dib et al.  2010 ). A recent collection of readings on ‘Sound 
Souvenirs’ deepens these insights on ambient sound, and also promotes again the 
nostalgic value of music (Bijsterveld and Van Dijck  2009 ). Furthermore, the design 
exploration of Fennell and Frohlich ( 2005 ) show how  conversations of different 
kinds, around the hospital bed or the dinner table, could be recorded and played 
back in different ways to remind people of relationships and encounters. Finally, the 
work on audiophoto narratives described in Sect.   8.3 shows the value of  voiceover 
for explaining image sequences in story form (e.g. Frohlich and Jones  2008 ; 
Frohlich et al.  2012 ; Quinn et al.  2009 ), and connects with a large body of work in 
digital storytelling. 
 While much of this work was conducted in the domestic photography domain, 
other work was not, and serves to open up the application of audiophoto content to 
other areas and markets. A few of these areas are listed below and show that there 
may be multiple  audiophotographies stretching outside the domestic context which 
was the motivation for the original work:
•  Community journalism, e.g.  Com-Me (Frohlich et al.  2012 ) 
•  Cultural heritage, e.g.  RAW (Bitton et al.  2004 ) 
•  Literacy learning, e.g.  StoryKit (Quinn et al.  2009 ) 
•  Photography for the blind, e.g.  Accessible Photo Album (Harada et al.  2013 ) 
•  Public art, e.g.  Weegie (Blythe et al.  2008 )

•  Oral history, e.g.  Tap and Play (Piper et al.  2012 ) 
 Regarding lessons on the practice of audiophotography, these stem from a mas-
sive expansion of the user model for capturing and sharing sounds and images. My 
original vision was for the recording of an extensible multilayered audiophoto, par-
tially recorded on an audiocamera, with further sound added or mixed at playback 
on a variety of screen-based devices (Fig. 9.4 in Frohlich  2004 ). A loose printed 
version was also envisaged to play from an associated holder or mobile device. 
Subsequent research and development work has explored many other user models 
customised to their particular application contexts and inﬂ uenced by the technology 
of the day. 
 One such model reverses the primacy of audio in relation to photo, and proposes 
an  audio-only or  audio-ﬁ rst approach. Audio-only activities can be seen in the 
 Sonic Gems ,  Memory Shelf ,  Best China and  FM Radio prototypes which support 
different ways of capturing and playing back sound clips without photographs. 
Audio-ﬁ rst activities can be seen in the  StoryMail model of voicemail with pictures, 
and an option in the  StoryBank and Com-Phone apps to record voiceover ﬁ rst. At 
the opposite end of this dimension, an alternative photo-ﬁ rst user model is repre-
sented by  audio-annotation of regions of an individual photograph supported in the 
 Active Photo and  Tap And Play systems. 
 Another user model is the  audiophoto narrative model of  StoryBank ,  Com- 
Phone and  StoryKit which imply an image sequence accompanied by voiceover and 
various other optional sound types or layers. Some of these also support  audio- 
photo- text combinations to further extend the expressive power of the medium with 
written language. A variation of this approach is to record a linear sequence of 
 audio-photo-audio , as in the  Accessible Photo Album . All these systems can play 
audiophotos back as a kind of animated  slide show , and some can be encoded and 
shared as video ﬁ les on social media websites. Full  integration with video or video 
effects is another new user model that is evident in both research and development 
work. For example, virtual zooming or panning over an audiophoto was evident in 
the  RAW system and represents the generation of  video from stills . In the commer-
cial realm, systems such as  Flipagram and  Shadow Puppet support the  insertion of 
video clips themselves in audiophoto sequences. 
 These and other ways of combining sound and image affect the practice of 
assembling an audiophotograph and how it appears to audiences. The main lesson 
here is that there are now multiple ways of doing audiophotography, and different 
user models may be more or less appropriate to different application domains. 
 Regarding lessons on the technology of audiophotography, these have been par-
tially covered in Chap.   9  . There has been a stagnation of support on cameras them-
selves, but a growth in the number of audiocamera and audiophoto narrative apps on 
smartphones and tablets. These vary according to the user model they employ from 
amongst the kinds discussed above. In general, there is an emphasis on supporting 
talking photographs over other types, and stringing these together in narrative 
sequences. The prevalence of photo sharing with family and friends over social 
media, is leading to the integration of audiophoto narratives as a form of video (e.g. 
10.2  Lessons for Audiophotography

220
 Adobe Voice ), or single audiophotographs as talking points in a more verbal social 
network (e.g.  Digisocial ). 
 Taken together, these trends appear to be leading to a kind of  hyperphotography 
of the kind discussed by Ritchin ( 2009 ). This involves the transcendence of single 
images into linked combinations and sequences accompanied by other media: “ A 
digital photograph also can be said to represent a single moment, but one that can 
be easily lengthened and ampliﬁ ed by joining it to many other moments through 
various forms of hyperlinks and hybrid media, including extending it as a movie ” 
(Ritchin  2009 , p. 142). Modern audiophotography combines photography, sound 
recording and videography in this kind of way, and opens up a more integrated 
practice of self-recording and expression. 
10.3  Lessons for Innovation 
 Perhaps the biggest lesson of this review for innovation, is that it never stops. 
Innovation is a large multifaceted thing, which is best looked at as an ongoing pro-
cess rather than a bounded activity with a beginning and end. Indeed, the audiopho-
tography lense on innovation, taken in this book, originated itself in a particular 
time and context, and owes a debt to many preceding innovations in analogue and 
digital audio capture, photography and communication. And it will be possible and 
interesting in another 10 years to consider the integration of sound and image in 
future media technologies and behaviours. 
 To understand the multifaceted nature of innovation a little better, I would like to 
return to a framework I have used before in a previous publication about the rela-
tionship between innovation and human computer interaction (Sarvas and Frohlich 
 2011 ). HCI studies the way in which people interact with digital technology and is 
involved in the design and testing of new technologies to change the way we live. In 
the article we used the story of the early HP audiophotography work to argue that 
HCI tends to overlook business factors in its methods of study, and to stop short of 
tracking the evolution of prototypes and products over time. The current book takes 
up that argument by tracking the evolution of work in audiophotography since then, 
and highlighting its’ current manifestation in products. In reﬂ ecting on innovation 
before, we pointed to four research activities that deﬁ ne any new business opportu-
nity and the various lines of connection between them. These included  User research 
to understand the domain of application and user value of the technology,  Technology 
research to realize the core technology to be applied,  Design research to package 
the technology solution in a product and  Business research to work out who to sell 
it to at a proﬁ t. A diagram of these activities and connections was given in Fig. 7 of 
the article, and suggested as a way of documenting R & D activity to reﬁ ne any 
individual business opportunity. For present purposes, I show an adapted version of 
this ﬁ gure with the research activities replaced by their  outputs , including 
Applications, Technologies, Designs and Markets respectively (Fig.  10.1 ).

 We can use this framework to characterize the starting vision for the audiopho-
tography opportunity as expressed in Frohlich ( 2004 ) and Part I of this book. 
Taking the domestic photography application area as its starting point, the proposal 
was to use co-indexed sound-and-image software to record audiophotographs on 
an audiocamera and play them back on the camera and other ICT screen devices. 
An additional element of the proposal was to use embedded chip technology in 
paper to playback the sound from printed photographs from a handheld player. The 
creation of a new paper stock with embedded electronics ﬁ tted with HP’s business 
model at the time of making proﬁ t from paper and ink consumables. The main 
market for all this was to be families, which were the biggest purchasers of HP 
home computers and printers at the time. This combination of elements is shown in 
Fig.  10.2 below, and was itself the result of a whole series of studies and experi-
ments in each research area dating back to about 1996. Some of these studies are 
reported in Part I of this book.
 Subsequent R & D activity as reviewed in Part II of this book essentially 
expanded the business opportunities for audiophotography enormously, by explor-
ing new applications, technologies, markets and designs for the idea. Designs are 
represented by either prototypes or products that appear to embody assumptions 
about applications and markets in their design rationale (c.f. Moran and Carroll 
 1996 ). This can usually be read in research papers describing the motivation for 
prototypes and who they are tested on, or in the advertising literature describing the 
beneﬁ ts of products and their intended customers. Assumptions about technologies 
can usually be read from their design speciﬁ cations. Some example new elements 
to emerge from the review are shown in Fig.  10.3 below. With so many elements 
listed on the diagram, this is clearly no longer depicting a single coherent business 
opportunity. Instead, the elements outline an expanded business opportunity space 
from which individual businesses have been or could be deﬁ ned. In fact one way of 
 generating innovations would be to mix and match elements across categories to 
evolve designs for new applications, markets and technologies.
 One pattern to emerge from the review of these developments has been noted 
before in Chaps.   7  and   8 . Closed innovation within HP appeared to take a classic 
technology transfer approach of considering the use of sound-and-image software

and audioprint technology in other market and application contexts within the com-
pany. This resulted in prototypes such as  Audiopaperclips and  Active Photos for an 
ofﬁ ce worker market, and products such as  StoryMail and the  HP Jornada audio-
photo software for a mobile professional market. Open innovation on the other hand 
tended to look for other technologies, markets and designs for the same domestic 
photography application. Examples here include prototypes such as  Context pic-
tures ,  The Other Brother and  FM radio , or the  audiocamera apps of Table   9.1 . 
Exceptions apply to both areas, and in time the distinction seems to disappear, espe-
cially in open innovation, which is inﬂ uenced by so many other factors and uncon-
strained by a single company strategy. This applies to my own work, which was able 
to consider the application of audiophotography to community journalism in devel-
oping communities through  Com-Phone , and a more artistic implementation of the 
 Audiophoto Desk as a public art installation in  Weegie . Other examples include the 
 StoryKit prototype for school children and the  RAW prototype for capturing cultural 
life and heritage in developing communities.

 One aspect of innovation not captured in these ﬁ gures is the way in which one 
idea leads to another over time. This was another strong ﬁ nding of the review that 
was illustrated by the story-like write up of examples in the text where I tried to 
preserve the sequential order of studies and systems. This can be seen most clearly 
in Chap.   8 , which is framed by the tree diagram of Fig.   8.1 showing six related 
branches of research. One study follows another down each branch of the tree, and 
often builds on the ﬁ ndings and insights of previous studies. For example, on the 
Audio Memory branch of Sect.   8.5 , Oleksik et al. ( 2008 ) study of domestic sound-
scapes led directly to a follow-up study on sonic gems (Oleksik and Brown  2008 ), 
which itself was inspiration for Dib et al. ( 2010 ) study of sonic souvenirs and later 
development of the  FM Radio prototype (Petrelli et al.  2010 ). For this sequence, the 
domestic photography application was initially relaxed to include other aspects of 
domestic life, only to be returned to later in new solutions for memory recording, in 
and out of the home. 
 Because academic research in a university context is not framed by any business 
imperative to make money, it does not need to align all the elements of Fig.  10.2 into 
a coherent business opportunity for any prototype. Typically markets are underde-
ﬁ ned in character and size. Alignment only becomes necessary for commercializa-
tion, as a ‘knowledge transfer’ task for industry. We consider this dynamic further 
in the next section in the context of reﬂ ecting on the time course of research and 
development activities and the relation between them. For now we can conclude that 
innovation involves the development of sequences or portfolios of design proposals 
over time, in either prototype or product form, and that these proposals make 
implicit assumptions about other key elements of innovation. 
 Tracing the arc of multiple designs over time and what they teach about various 
associated applications, markets or technologies would therefore be a good thing to 
do in speciﬁ c innovation areas. This would help to understand what has and has not 
been explored, and to learn the lessons of design history in a current area of innova-
tion. I have done some of this task here for the audiophotogaphy area, but better 
tools and techniques are needed for mapping the relationships between prototypes 
and products and showing their evolution over time. Developing such techniques is 
beyond the scope of this book, but there are ﬁ ve areas of research which would be 
worth looking at as starting points for this work. 
 Thinking and methodology on  design rationale , mentioned above, was speciﬁ -
cally aimed at articulating the implicit assumptions behind the design of interactive 
systems in the 1990s. A good introduction to the area is given in a special issue of 
the HCI journal edited by Carroll and Moran ( 1991 ) and also in their later book on 
the subject (Moran and Carroll  1996 ). Although this subsequently fell out of favour 
in the area, elements of the same idea have emerged in a recent recommendation for 
 annotated portfolios as a way of capturing the lessons of design explorations 
(Bowers  2012 ; Gaver and Bowers  2012 ). Rather than theorise such lessons in scien-
tiﬁ c papers, the authors suggest the simple textual annotation of design portfolios 
for related design concepts or prototypes. This can be said to generate a kind of 
intermediate level design knowledge between artifacts and theory (Lowgren  2013 ). 
While design rationales capture the assumptions of individual systems, and 
10.3  Lessons for Innovation

224
 annotated portfolios convey the knowledge and approach of particular designers or 
studios, my recommendation is to map the evolution of ‘naturally occurring’ proto-
types and products in particular innovation areas. This is much closer to a  design 
collection or history project, or the kind of new techniques now used in  patent 
mapping to visualise patent families sharing similar claims or citations. Bill Buxton 
has promoted the tracking of digital technology prototypes and products through his 
own  Buxton Collection , now supported by Microsoft (  http://research.microsoft.
com/en-us/um/people/bibuxton/buxtoncollection/    ), and a number of patent map-
ping tools are now available including  PatSnap which claims to embody the next 
step in ‘IP analytics’ (  http://www.patsnap.com/home/report  ). Making sense of such 
collections or analytics may require the sensibilities of a historian or design critic in 
a kind of  interaction criticism , which is another approach currently gaining ground 
in HCI (Bardzell et al.  2010 ). All these movements adopt the kind of evolutionary 
approach to understanding innovation that is strongly suggested by the audiopho-
tography case study. However, none could quite capture the way in which different 
research and development issues have been explored by industry or academia in the 
audiophotography area, as reviewed above. 
10.4  Fast Design, Slow Innovation 
 Returning to the overarching theme of the book, we can see in the evolution of 
audiophotography that design and innovation proceed at different rates over time. 
Design is represented by both prototypes and products on either side of the Research 
and Development divide, and these change rapidly in response to research ﬁ ndings 
and customer demand. We saw this in Chap.   8  through the academic arms race 
between universities and corporate research labs, as new prototypes were developed 
along strands of research about every year or two. It could also be seen in Chap.   9 
in the vibrancy of the app market and the redundancy of competing offerings of 
audiocamera and audiophoto narrative apps in Tables   9.1 and 9.2  . Innovation on the 
other hand is represented by the impact of design on everyday practice, and change 
in the established way something is done. This appears to have changed very slowly 
in terms of the practice of combining sound clips with photographs, and is only now 
beginning to emerge as a genre of video which is easy to generate as part of a photo 
slideshow, or a method of discussing still images on the web. 
 Related practices may even have declined, as in the case of capturing and sharing 
music and other recordings on cassette tapes. This is despite the great potential of 
audio recording demonstrated in the Audio Memory Sect. 8.5 of Chap.   8 . What 
takes hold as a new activity in the consumer market is difﬁ cult to predict and highly 
sensitive to the cost and effort involved, as well as its ﬁ t to existing patterns of 
behaviour. In an age when recording music from the radio was the cheapest and 
easiest way to share it, cassette technology thrived. But in the current age where 
music is available digitally over the web, its manual recording in real time is no 
longer efﬁ cient or attractive. The management of music and other kinds of sound 
recordings are a key ‘related practice’ for audiophotography to ﬁ t with, as are 
10 Lessons

225
 photography and video recording. In order for audiophotography to become more 
commonplace, the technologies of sound, image and video need somehow to 
become more  integrated , so that audiophoto capture and sharing is just part and 
parcel of a new multimedia literacy and communication practice. I believe this is 
what we are starting to see in the digital storytelling area, which supports all kinds 
of audio/photo/video combinations through various narrative apps. 
 A ﬁ nal complication for innovation timescales is that they appear to overlap for 
different classes of user. In Geoffrey Moore’s ( 2014 ) terms, there may be groups 
such as innovators, early adopters, early and late majority and laggards who take 
increasingly longer amounts of time to embrace any new technology. We saw this in 
the photowork diagrams of Figs.   9.1, 9.2, and 9.3  describing three eras of audioprint 
solutions. The continuing existence of analogue ﬁ lm cameras with silent and talking 
photo albums, demonstrates that there is still a market for the activities of Fig.   9.1 
despite the range of new digital and ‘post-digital’ technologies and activities shown 
in Figs.   9.2 and 9.3  . We must therefore be even more careful not to dismiss new 
technologies and products too early for their failure to reach the mainstream, since 
Moores’ analysis shows that what innovators and early adopters use today, the 
mainstream may use tomorrow. It is just that ‘today’ and ‘tomorrow’ are more likely 
to be 15 or 20 years apart, rather than 3–5 years apart as folklore has it.  
10.5  The Research-Practice Gap 
 While this message may be less surprising and less concerning to researchers in 
academia, colleagues and investors in industry may be more concerned. As we have 
seen, researchers don’t need to commercialise their prototypes and see them become 
mainstream within a short period of time, whereas developers are paid to do just 
that. Perhaps one way to speed up innovation is for these two communities to work 
more closely together, and close what Norman has called the research-practice gap 
( 2010 ). This is a cultural difference between research and development staff with 
different backgrounds and objectives, often working on similar technologies in dif-
ferent institutions. If only the bright ideas from university or corporate research labs 
could be handed off to companies and development units quicker and more efﬁ -
ciently, companies could turn them into products faster. Conversely, if academics 
understood the needs of industry better, then technology innovation might attend to 
market factors and be more closely tied to business model innovation (c.f. Baden- 
Fuller and Haeﬂ iger  2013 ). 
 The lesson of the audiophotography story here is that Norman is right to high-
light the cultural divide between R & D. Researchers in either university or industry 
are part of a scientiﬁ c community which meets to share ﬁ ndings and ideas on a 
 regular basis through conferences and publications. In Chap.   8  we saw how this led 
to rapid development of independent research on audiophotography by a small clus-
ter of interacting institutions and individuals, many of whom knew each other. This 
contrasts sharply with the picture in Chap.   9 , of a raft of independent companies all 
bringing out similar products in the audiophotography area, without any formal 
10.5  The Research-Practice Gap

226
reference to each other or a sense of building on common work. No doubt some 
developers in these companies know each other from trade shows or forums on the 
web, but the culture of competition rather than collaboration is one which surely 
slows them down in relation to their scientiﬁ c colleagues. 
 The mixture of commercial competition and scientiﬁ c collaboration seen in the 
corporate R & D of Chap.   7  , lies somewhere between the two cultural extremes, 
especially when open innovation is encouraged into the mix. In practical terms, this 
led to the rapid spread of ideas on audiophotography into a number of products and 
domains both inside and outside photography itself. At least here, staff on both sides 
of the research and development divide talk to each other, and collaborate to turn 
prototypes into products when there is a ﬁ t to business strategies and competencies. 
This then is a model for how research and development communities should interact 
more closely with each other in a common area, through actual contact, collaboration 
and the free ﬂ ow of ideas. Mechanisms for facilitating this include the integration of 
conferences with exhibitions and product fairs, and publication venues for a range of 
contributions which acknowledge the different ways in which research and develop-
ment knowledge is generated and documented. Staff exchange between universities 
and companies, or between corporate and divisional research labs is another mecha-
nism which appears to happen naturally in high tech clusters like Silicon Valley, or 
multinational companies like HP. This may itself result in the kind of  translational 
developers that Norman recommends, for translating the results of research into 
development actions, and development challenges into research questions.  
10.6  Slow Design, Fast Innovation 
 Given the conclusions about fast design and slow innovation described above, it is 
interesting to note the existence of two movements for slow design and fast innova-
tion. I comment on each of these brieﬂ y in reverse order, before summarizing the 
main conclusions of the book. 
 Fast innovation is an idea especially associated with the software industry and 
promoted through the agile development and lean startup approaches. Agile soft-
ware development was a reaction to the experience of large-scale IT system projects 
of the 1990s which often went over time and over budget, due to over-planning, 
insufﬁ cient communication and ‘all-at-once’ delivery (Cooke  2012 ). The agile 
approach in contrast involves incremental planning and iterative development and 
testing to evolve a system with the engagement of stakeholders. The lean startup 
movement is a related approach promoted by Eric Ries ( 2011 ) to apply agile 
 development to new companies or ventures. Ries recommends a process of fast 
innovation through shortening the time taken to carry out iterative Build-Measure-
Learn cycles. Interestingly for this book, he advocates the use of a ‘Minimal Viable 
Product’ (MVP) early in this process, deﬁ ned as “that version of the product that 
enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with a minimum amount of 
effort and the least amount of development time” (op. cit., p. 77). Examples include 
10 Lessons

227
a video of the Dropbox ﬁ le storage service for users to sign up from, and a food 
recommendation service done initially in person by the CEO of  Food on the Table 
for a single customer. 
 These ideas are sympathetic in principle to the evolutionary nature of innovation 
illustrated by the audiophotography story. In fact they use evolution as a driving 
principle of design. The MVP is particularly interesting in relation to the division 
we have found between prototypes and products in the computing industry. 
Prototypes are both an input and output of research, and act to collect new knowl-
edge about user values and behaviours through some kind of conceptual, experi-
mental or ﬁ eld-based test. Products are also a kind of input and output of 
development. They generate revenue whilst also gauging customer reaction to the 
associated design and business model. Usually there is a clear distinction between 
prototype and product, which may often be created by different research and devel-
opment communities. In the lean startup approach, this distinction is collapsed to 
allow development companies to experiment more freely and repeatedly with differ-
ent versions of a product in the market. This addresses the research-practice gap 
above by bringing more research and knowledge generation into the heart of devel-
opment, and making the company more responsive (agile) to user needs. The down-
side of this approach is that customers may feel cheated with the lack of functionality 
and ﬁ nish of early products, in the same way that participants react to prototypes. 
While this may speed up product and company development, it is harder to argue 
that it speeds up innovation itself. However many prototypes and products are tested 
on a market at any one time, it will still take a particular conﬂ uence of application, 
technology, market and design factors to cause an innovative shift in established 
practice worthy of the name. As we have seen, many of these factors are outside the 
control of individual companies and take years to move into a constellation adopted 
by a mainstream segment of the population. 
 Slow design is another movement which has much in common with an evolution-
ary model of innovation, but for quite different reasons. The slow movement started 
in the food industry of Italy as a reaction to the fast food revolution of the US. Its 
original values were to promote engagement with local produce, sustainable farm-
ing, and a respect for cultural traditions of preparing and eating meals slowly, in 
community with others. Slow design is a term coined by Fuad-Luke ( 2002 ) to apply 
these principles to a more sustainable process of design for wellbeing, which rec-
ommends fewer iterations of products over time to increase their value and longev-
ity. It also recommends designs which cause us to slow down as human beings, into 
a less frenetic and more reﬂ ective pace of life. Hence his entry in the Dictionary of 
Design (Erlhoff and Marshall  2008 ) says this:  “Slow design positions itself again 
the “fast design” of the current industrial paradigm, which is governed by 
 unsustainable cycles of fashion and over-consumption, business ethics, and an 
anthropology that deﬁ nes everyone as customers. The use of “slow” as an adjective, 
or instructive adverb, deliberately introduces ambiguity in this context; it implies 
that time is implicit in all facets of (the) design, and that the purpose is to slow down 
the process, the outcome, and the effects of the outcome ”. In partnership with 
Carolyn Strauss, Alistair Fuad-Luke has written a set of principles for slow design 
10.6  Slow Design, Fast Innovation

228
(Strauss and Fuad-Luke  2008 ). Strauss currently runs  SlowLab as a platform for 
slow design projects (  http://www.slowlab.net/  ) and the movement has now spread to 
other domains such as slow cities, travel, schools, books, lifestyles and money 
(  http://www.slowmovement.com/  ). An example slow design project is the Slow 
Lloyd project which invited architects, designers, innovators, students and commu-
nity members to imagine future uses and interactions with the Lloyd Hotel and 
Cultural Embassy in Amsterdam (  http://slowlloyd.slowlab.net/  ). 
 Instead of promoting design evolution as a way of speeding up innovation (as in 
agile/lean development), slow design recommends it as a way of slowing down 
innovation and our reaction to it. In an age of rising consumerism across the globe, 
this is a timely and provocative message which may cause us to think differently 
about the  purpose of design and its sustainability in a world of ﬁ nite resources. The 
lessons of this review offer some comfort to this movement, in showing that despite 
the fast iterations of designs in any area, consumers are slower and more discerning 
than we realise in  adopting technologies that are offered to them. True innovation is 
already a slow process and not controlled by any one organisation alone. Furthermore, 
human values remain remarkably stable in the face of technological change, with 
technology offering new ways of realizing values rather than offering new values 
themselves. Audiophotography is a good example of this, since it extends the mem-
ory, communication and identity values of photography by offering additional audi-
tory cues and content to complement an image, and new ways of playing back the 
results on paper as well as screen. As a slow design project it has resulted in numer-
ous related designs over many years, and encourages new forms of reﬂ ection on 
experience captured in auditory form. 
10.7  Conclusions 
 What then can we conclude about audiophotography and innovation as a result of 
reviewing 10 years’ worth of research activity in the ﬁ eld and a snapshot of current 
products? 
 Regarding audiophotography we can say that it is very much alive in current 
smartphone and tablet apps, and has been considerably advanced by numerous 
research studies and prototypes exploring new ways of combining sound and image 
for different purposes and markets. Promising new application areas have emerged 
in addition to domestic photography, including community journalism, literacy 
learning and cultural heritage capture. Furthermore, the initial possibilities for play-
ing back sound from paper are getting closer to a commercial reality because of 
advances in printed electronics and augmented reality. As a result of these develop-
ments, there are business opportunities for cameras and camcorders to provide bet-
ter support for audiophoto capture alongside photo and video shooting modes, and 
for social media sites to incorporate sound with pictures for enhanced storytelling 
and discussion. There is also an opportunity to improve the augmentation of photo-
books with sound, through both online speciﬁ cation and ofﬂ ine addition of voiceover 
10 Lessons

or conversation. A key additional ingredient necessary to the future expansion of 
audiophotography is the formation of a stronger community of practice. This is 
beginning to be nurtured online amongst users of various audiophoto apps, but 
might be brought together across these groups by an overarching online community 
portal and a series of localized clubs. Synergies with the digital storytelling move-
ment might be exploited here, or other communities such as oral historians, to pro-
mote the approach as a contribution to other domains. 
 Regarding innovation we have found that closed innovation can be used to 
explore technology transfer to other applications and markets, while open innova-
tion can be used to ﬁ nd other solutions and technologies for the same domain. 
Although the design of prototypes and products can be accelerated or connected in 
various ways, researchers and developers should still expect adoption to take many 
years in any market, at different rates for different segments. In general, we should 
think of innovation as something which happens across institutions and time, in an 
evolutionary fashion. Its development can be steered but not controlled by any one 
individual or institution, and could be documented and mapped more effectively to 
identify trends, gaps and opportunities. This constitutes a research challenge in its 
own right, to reveal the history and provenance of prototypes and products in any 
area, and the connections between them over time. 
 Finally, the audiophotography story contains a number of personal implications 
for would-be innovators. I express these here in six recommendations:
 1.  Be persistent and don’t give up on a good idea 
 2.  Be smart and don’t hold onto an idea which doesn’t work 
 3.  Treat failure as a learning exercise and advance in design 
 4.  Treat success as a short term victory 
 5.  Engage with the scientiﬁ c community in your area to beneﬁ t from and contribute 
to research activity 
   6.   Engage with the commercial community in your area to beneﬁ t from and con-
tribute to development activity 
 Perhaps the overarching implication is that innovators are individual members of a 
global learning community. Their contribution is always situated and built on a history 
of previous contributions, whether they know it or not, and they have little control 
over the uptake of their ideas by others. The lesson of this book is to accept that, and 
enjoy the sociability, serendipity and unpredictability of innovation in all its forms.
