iPad All-in-One For Dummies, 7th Edition

Introduction
A

pple turned the computing world on its ear when it introduced the 
iPad. This small wonder, which weighed less than a pound and a half, 
sold many tens of millions of units in its first few years for good reason: It’s 
well designed and feature rich, and it opens a world of apps and media view­
ing in a highly portable format.
About This Book
iPad All-in-One For Dummies, 7th Edition, has one aim: to be the ultimate 
­reference on the coolest digital device of the day. If you’re reasonably 
­computer savvy, you can use this book to get up to speed quickly the day 
you buy your iPad, and then you can pick up the book again anytime you 
feel like taking your knowledge of the iPad to the next level. Even if you’ve 
been puttering with your iPad for a while, you’ll still find things between 
these covers that you didn’t know about.
Though the iPad is relatively simple to use, a lot is packed in there, and you 
can get even more from it by downloading apps to do seemingly everything 
under the sun. This book approaches the iPad from every angle: from the 
basics to powerful road-warrior tools.
You can read step-by-step instructions for basic tasks, hot tips for getting 
the most out of iPad, and tips about apps that can take your iPad experience 
further.
Foolish Assumptions
To offer you a book that gives you insight into the powerful ways you can use 
iPad, I have to assume that you’re computer and mobile-phone literate. You 
don’t have to be an iPhone user to use this book (though iPhone has a great 
many similarities to iPad and shares many apps with it). You don’t even have 
to be a Mac-oriented person — PC people do just fine with the iPad.
I also assume that you want to take your use of the iPad to the next level by get­
ting helpful tips and advice as well as discovering several apps that are useful 
in expanding your iPad experience. You may use the iPad for personal pleasure 
or to get your work done — or both. If you travel a great deal or use the iPad to 
work, you’ll find extra benefits in the material covered in Books III and IV.

Icons Used in This Book
Icons Used in This Book
Little pictures often found in the margin of technical books help you quickly 
find certain types of information, such as tips or warnings. Here are the 
icons you should look for in iPad All-in-One For Dummies, 7th Edition:
	
The Tip icon points to a tiny bit of advice about the current topic or other 
useful strategies for advancing your iPad experience to the next level.
	
The Remember icon signals either a pertinent fact that relates to the topic 
you’re reading about (but which could also be mentioned elsewhere in the 
book) or a reiteration of a particularly important piece of information that’s, 
well, worth repeating.
	
The Warning icon alerts you to potential pitfalls, so don’t ignore it. Ignoring 
the Warning icon might leave you with lost data, a broken iPad, or a lost 
connection.
	
For the latest and greatest features of iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 , hunt for 
the New icon. If you own an earlier generation of iPad or iPad mini, this infor­
mation can help you understand where your model might differ in its func­
tionality. Note: Most features on your iPad will match this book no matter 
what version of iPad you have if you upgrade to the current operating sys­
tem, iOS 8. However, the original iPad doesn’t support iOS 8 at all, so none of 
the coverage in this book is relevant to that model.
	
The Technical Stuff icon marks iPad information that ventures beyond the 
basics.
Beyond the Book
This section describes where you can find the book’s companion content at 
www.dummies.com. Here’s what you can find there:
	
✓	Cheat Sheet: Visit www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/ipadaio to find 
ways to personalize various iPad and Safari browser settings and a list of 
free apps.
	
✓	Dummies.com online articles: Head to this book’s Extras page located 
at www.dummies.com/extras/ipadaio to read about cool apps for 
your iPad. You’ll find information about entertainment apps, apps for 
business power users, apps to use with iWork, and informative apps 
such as dictionaries and news sources.

Where to Go from Here
	
✓	Updates: I provide information on changes to the iOS or iPad hardware that 
occur after this book’s publication on my website at www.ipadmadeclear.
com, so you can continue to use this book even if changes are introduced 
after you buy it. Please check this website periodically as Apple makes 
software and hardware updates to iPad now and then. You can also check 
for updates and corrections at www.dummies.com/extras/ipadaio.
Where to Go from Here
After you read this book’s introduction, it’s time to jump into all things iPad. 
I hope that when you turn to any chapter in this book, you’ll find something 
you didn’t know about iPad that will increase your enjoyment of your new 
device.
Start by checking out the basic concepts and instructions in Book I (you 
might be surprised at what you discover, even if you’ve been tinkering with 
your iPad for a bit) and then jump to any minibook that addresses topics 
you want explore next — to have fun or get work done, for example.
Wherever you dive in, you’re likely to find some advice or information that 
will make your iPad experience even more rewarding.
The first step you should take (and this is covered in Book I, Chapter 2) is to 
update to the latest operating system for iPad — iOS 8, at the time this book 
went to press. (All steps in this book are based on iOS 8.)

Y

ou’ve read about it and seen people using it everywhere you go. You 
know you can’t live without your own iPad to have fun, explore the 
online world, read e-books, organize your photos, play games, and more.
Trust me; you’ve made a good decision because the iPad does redefine the 
computing experience in an exciting new way.
This chapter is for those of you who don’t already have an iPad. Here is 
where you discover the different iPad models and their advantages, as well 
as where to buy this little gem and the accessories you can purchase to 
trick out your iPad.
Discovering What’s New in iOS 8.0
iPad gets its features from a combination of hardware 
and its software operating system, with the most cur­
rent operating system being iOS 8.0, though small 
updates appear all the time, so by the time you’re 
reading this, you might have 8.1, 2, or 3. If you’ve 
seen an older iPad in action or own one, it might be 
helpful to understand what new features the iPad 
Air 2 and iPad mini 3 bring to the table (which are all 
covered in more detail throughout this book). In 
addition to features on previous-generation iPads 
through the iPad Air, the latest iPad models offer
	
✓	Design: iPad Air 2 is lighter (.96 lb.) and thinner (.24 
inches thick) with thinner bezels for more screen area. 
Both iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 offer awesomely crisp displays 
with 2048 x 1536 resolution — which, trust me, makes for a very good 
viewing experience.

8
Discovering What’s New in iOS 8.0
	
✓	An improved chip: The 64-bit A8 processor in the iPad Air 2 increases 
the processor and graphics speeds accomplished by the A7 chip on the 
previous generation iPad. The iPad mini 3 retains the A7 processor.
	
✓	Better Wi-Fi: Two-antennae dual-channel Wi-Fi and the use of MIMO 
(multiple-input, multiple output) technology allows for much faster wire­
less connections. In iPad Air 2, support of the latest Wi-Fi standard, 
802.11 ac, ups the ante on Wi-Fi performance. Note that the iPad mini 3 
doesn’t support this standard.
	
✓	M8 Motion Coprocessor: This coprocessor on the iPad Air 2 processes 
game features like the gyroscope and accelerometer faster.
	
✓	Video Recording: Video recording features include the addition of a 
Slo-mo mode as well as improved stabilization and face detection.
	
✓	Touch ID: This security feature has been added to both iPad models. 
Essentially, sensors in the Home button allow you to train iPad to recog­
nize your fingerprint and grant you access to your iPad with a finger 
press, as well as to use the new Apple Pay feature to buy items without 
having to enter your payment information every time.
	
✓	A barometer sensor: Only on iPad Air 2, this new sensor makes it possi­
ble for your iPad to sense air pressure and weather around you. This 
one’s especially cool when hiking a mountain where the weather may 
change as you climb.
	
✓	A “soft” SIM card: With iPad Air 2 you get a software-based SIM card. 
This means that if you get an iPad that supports a 3G/4G connection 
through a phone carrier such as AT&T, you don’t have to get a little plas­
tic card from the service provider to hold all your account data. SIM 
functionality is now built into the iPad Air 2, and you can use it to con­
nect to your account. This is great news for international travellers who 
can connect with another carrier without getting a physical SIM card.
	
Throughout this book, I point out any features that are available on only cer­
tain models of iPads, so you can use much of this book even if you own an 
earlier model.
Any iPad device other than the original iPad can use iOS 8.0 if you update 
the operating system (discussed in detail in Chapter 2 of this minibook); this 
book is based on version 8.0 of iOS.
This update to the operating system adds a few new features, including
	
✓	Family Sharing: Apple has provided a new feature called Family Sharing 
with iOS 8. This feature allows up to six people to partake of purchased 
iTunes content on their separate devices. You can also create a Family 
calendar that helps everybody in the family create and view upcoming 
family events.

Book I 
Chapter 1
Buying Your iPad
Discovering What’s New in iOS 8.0
	
✓	Continuity: This concept, enhanced in iOS 8, allows you to move from one 
iOS device to another to pick up where you left off using a feature called 
Handoff. For example, you might start to watch a TV show on your iPhone 
on the train but then pick up where you left off viewing the show on your 
iPad when you get home. You can even hand off a document or email and 
start where you left off on another device, as well as have text messages 
and phone calls ring through from your iPhone to your iPad or Mac.
	
✓	Improved Notification Center: Notification Center is a centralized location 
for reviewing things like calendar appointments, messages, and weather, 
With iOS 8, you can interact with notifications from the center, for example, 
replying to a message listed there. The new Today view lets you display 
your choice of notification types on both the Home and Lock screen.
	
✓	Mail Improvements: In iOS 8, you can access other email messages 
while composing a new message. You’ll now be prompted to add a 
phone number or flight number mentioned in an email to your Calendar 
app. You can also flag or mark email by simply swiping across the screen 
to access those commands.
	
✓	Quick Type for iPad Keyboard: Now the iPad onscreen keyboard uses 
predictive technology to suggest words as you type. The keyboard also 
notes whether you’re typing an email or message and makes suggestions 
based on the tone of voice each type of message calls for.
	
✓	Improvements to the Photos App: To help you organize your photos, in 
iOS 8 you can now store your photos in iCloud and download them when 
you want to view them via your iCloud Photo Library. Photos or videos 
can also be shared among up to six people’s devices using Family Sharing. 
There are also several improved tools for editing photos in iOS 8.
	
✓	Shazam: Shazam is a music identifier service that has been integrated 
into Siri to identify songs and other media as they play around you.
	
✓	Messaging: The Messages app has some improvements. For example, 
you can name group messages by swiping down in the Details screen to 
access the hidden group name setting, and remove people from conver­
sations. You can also set up a Do Not Disturb feature for certain threads 
so that you’re not interrupted by messages on those threads, and you 
can record and send voice messages.
	
✓	Siri Hands-Free: If you are driving or otherwise occupied and want help 
from Siri, such as getting directions or to send a message, you can use a 
new feature to open Siri without touching your iPhone — as long as it is 
connected to a power source. With this feature enabled, all you have to 
do is say “Hey, Siri,” and your electronic personal assistant opens, ready 
to hear your wish, which is, of course, Siri’s command.
	
✓	Instant Hotspot: You’ve been able to use your iPhone as a hotspot in the 
past, essentially using your iPhone connection to get other devices 
online. With iOS 8, this personal hotspot is improved; nearby devices 
such as a computer now automatically display the iPhone as an optional 
network that you can join to go online.

Choosing the Right iPad for You
Choosing the Right iPad for You
Though there are slight differences in thickness and weight among the different 
generations of the larger iPad model, if you pick up an iPad (see Figure 1-1), 
you’re not likely to be able to tell one model from another on first glance, 
except that some are black and some are white or gold or silver. Newer models 
get gradually thinner and lighter. Still, most of their differences are primarily 
under the hood.
Figure 1-1: A black iPad has a classic look.
If you’re in the market for a new iPad, Apple’s latest offerings are iPad Air 2 
and the iPad mini 3. The iPad mini is smaller, but its screen resolution 
matches that of the iPad Air 2. However, the iPad mini 3 lacks a few features 
of the iPad Air 2, including the Burst and Slo-mo features for the Camera app, 
the higher-end laminated display and antireflective coating, support for the 
latest Wi-Fi standard, and the faster A8 processor.
The larger iPad Airs have three variations:
	
✓	Case color
	
✓	Amount of built-in memory
	
✓	Method used for connecting to the Internet: Wi-Fi only, Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi and 
3G/4G.

Book I 
Chapter 1
Buying Your iPad
Choosing the Right iPad for You
Your options in the first bullet point are silver, gold, or space gray, but if 
you’re confused about the other two, read on; I explain these variations in 
more detail.
	
Because Apple upgrades the software and releases new versions of the hard­
ware on a somewhat regular basis (a practice that keeps tech writers on 
their toes), I’ve avoided getting too specific on memory specifications and 
pricing in this chapter. However, you can go to www.apple.com/ipad to 
check out the latest details at any time.
Deciding how much memory is enough
You know that computer memory is a measure of how much information — for 
example, movies, photos, and software applications, or apps — you can store 
on a computing device. Memory can also affect your iPad’s performance when 
handling tasks, such as streaming favorite TV shows from the World Wide Web 
or downloading music.
	
With video and audio streaming, you can enjoy a lot of content online with­
out ever downloading the full content to your hard drive or iPad flash mem­
ory, and given that the iPad has a relatively small amount of memory in any 
of its models, that’s not a bad idea. See Book II, Chapters 1 through 3 for 
more about getting your music and movies online.
Your memory options with an iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 are 16, 64, or 128 giga­
bytes (GB). You must choose the right amount of memory because you can’t 
open the unit and add to it, as you usually can with a desktop computer. 
There is also no way to directly insert a flash drive (also known as a USB 
stick) to add backup capacity because iPad has no USB port — or CD/DVD 
drive, for that matter. However, Apple has thoughtfully provided iCloud, a 
service you can use to save space by backing up content to the Internet. 
(You can read more about that in Chapter 5 of this minibook.)
	
With an Apple Digital AV Adapter accessory, you can plug into the iPad to 
attach an HDMI-enabled display. See Book II, Chapter 3 for more about using 
these AV features. For example, ViewSonic offers several HDMI projectors, 
DVDO offers an HD Travel Kit for smartphones and tablets, and Belkin has 
introduced a new line of tools for HDTV streaming.
So how much memory is enough for your iPad? Here’s a good rule: If you like 
lots of media, such as movies or TV shows, and you want to store them on 
your iPad (rather than experiencing or accessing this content online on sites 
such as Hulu or Netflix or from your Mac or PC using an app like Air Video), 
you might need 64GB or more. For most people who manage a reasonable 
number of photos, download some music, and watch heavy-duty media such 
as movies online, 64GB is probably sufficient. If you simply want to check 
email, browse the web, and write short notes to yourself, 16GB might be 
enough, but for my money, why bother?

12
Choosing the Right iPad for You
	
You can’t expand memory in an iPad. Apple is banking on your wanting to 
stream and sync content via iTunes or iCloud. Only you can decide whether 
that will work for you.
What’s the price for more memory? For the iPad Air 2, a 16GB Wi-Fi unit (see 
the next section for more about Wi-Fi) costs $499; 64GB adds another $100. 
But doubling that to 128GB adds just $100, boosting the price to $699. If you 
buy an iPad mini 3, you’re looking at $399, $499, or $599 for the three levels 
of memory it offers.
Determining whether you need Wi-Fi 
only or Wi-Fi and 3G/4G
Another variation on price and performance for the iPad is whether your model 
has Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi and 3G/4G. Because the iPad is great for browsing online, 
shopping online, emailing, and so on, having an Internet connection for your 
device obviously is pretty essential. That’s where Wi-Fi and 3G/4G come in. 
Both are used to connect to the Internet, and in case you need a refresher 
course, here’s a quick summary:
	
✓	Wi-Fi is what you use to connect to a wireless network at home, at work, 
or at public locations such as your local coffee shop or an airport. This 
type of network uses short-range radio to connect devices to the Internet; 
its range is reasonably limited — so if you leave home or walk out of the 
coffee shop, you can’t use it.
	
✓	3G and 4G cellphone technologies allow an iPad to connect to the Internet 
via a cellular network that’s widespread. You use it in much the same way 
that you make calls from just about anywhere using your cellphone. 3G is 
available as of iPad 2 and all later models. As the latest cellular connection 
technology, it may not be available in every location. You’ll still connect to 
the Internet when 4G service isn’t available, but without the advantage of 
the superfast 4G technology.
You can buy an iPad with only Wi-Fi or one with both Wi-Fi and 3G (or 3G and 
4G) capabilities. Getting a 3G/4G iPad costs an additional $130, but it also 
includes GPS so that you can get more accurate driving directions. You have 
to buy an iPad model for your preferred data connection provider — AT&T, 
Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon in the United States, as of this writing.
Also, to use your 3G/4G network, you have to pay AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or 
Verizon a monthly fee. The good news is that none of these carriers requires 
a long-term contract, as you probably had to commit to with your cellphone 
and its data connection — you can pay for a connection the month you 
travel to Hong Kong and then get rid of it when you return home.

Buying Your iPad
Choosing the Right iPad for You
Features, data allowance (which relates to accessing email or downloading 
items from the Internet, for example), and prices vary by carrier and could 
change at any time, so visit each carrier’s website to see what each offers. 
Note that if you intend to stream videos (watch them on your iPad from the 
Internet), you can eat through your data plan allowance quickly.
	
If you have a Wi-Fi network available and a smartphone whose data plan 
allows tethering over 3G/4G, you might consider just getting a Wi-Fi–only 
iPad model and save the rather high cost of provider data plans and the 
higher cost for these models if you only need 3G/4G occasionally.
	
Of course, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon could change their pricing 
and options at any time, so go to these links for more information about 
iPad data plans: AT&T is at www.att.com/shop/wireless/devices/
ipad.jsp, Sprint’s home page is http://sprint.com, T-Mobile’s URL is 
www.T-Mobile.com, and Verizon is at www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/
splash/ipad.jsp.
	
You can use the hotspot feature on a smartphone, which allows iPad to use 
your phone’s 3G or 4G connection to go online if you pay for a data-use plan 
that supports hotspot usage with your phone service carrier. Check out the 
features of your phone to turn on hotspot. See Book III, Chapter 3 for more 
about this feature.
So how do you choose? If you want to wander around the woods or town — or 
take long drives with your iPad continually connected to the Internet — get 
3G/4G and pay the price. But if you’ll use your iPad mainly at home or using a 
Wi-Fi hotspot (a location where Wi-Fi access to the Internet is available, such as 
at an Internet cafe, an office, or a library), don’t bother with 3G/4G. And 
frankly, you can now find lots of hotspots out there, including restaurants, 
hotels, airports, and more.
	
Because 3G/4G iPads are GPS devices, they know where you are and can act 
as a navigation system to get you from here to there. The Wi-Fi–only model 
uses a digital compass and triangulation method for locating your current 
position, which is less accurate; with no constant Internet connection, it 
won’t help you to get around town. If getting accurate directions when 
you’re on the go is one iPad feature that excites you, get 3G/4G and then see 
Book III, Chapter 2 for more about the Maps app.
Knowing what you need to use your iPad
Before you head off to buy your iPad, you should know what other devices, 
connections, and accounts you’ll need to work with it optimally. At a bare 
minimum, you need to be able to connect to the Internet to take advantage 
of most of iPad’s features. You can open an iCloud account (Apple’s online 

14
Getting Your Hands on an iPad
storage and synchronization service) to store and share content online, or 
you can use a computer to download photos, music, or applications from 
non-Apple online sources such as stores or sharing sites like your local 
library, and then transfer them to your iPad through a process called sync­
ing. You can also use a computer or iCloud to register your iPad the first 
time you start it, although if you have an Apple Store nearby, you can have it 
handle the registration for you.
Can you use iPad without owning a computer and just use public Wi-Fi hotspots 
to go online (or a 3G/4G connection if you have one of those models)? Yes. 
However, to be able to go online using a Wi-Fi–only iPad and to use many of its 
built-in features at home, you need to have a home Wi-Fi network available or 
be lucky enough to live in a town that offers town-wide Wi-Fi (or at least Wi-Fi in 
your neighborhood). You also need to use iCloud or sync to your computer to 
get updates for the iPad operating system.
For syncing with a computer, Apple’s iPad User Guide recommends that you 
have
	
✓	A Mac or PC with a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 port and one of the following 
operating systems:
	
•	 Mac OS X version 10.6.8 or later
	
•	 Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP Home or 
Professional with Service Pack 3 or later
	
✓	iTunes 11.0 or later, available at www.itunes.com/download
	
✓	An Apple ID and iTunes Store account
	
✓	Internet access
	
✓	An iCloud account
Apple has set up its iTunes software and the iCloud service to give you two 
ways to manage content for your iPad — including movies, music, or photos 
you’ve downloaded — and specify how to sync your calendar and contact 
information. Chapter 4 in this minibook covers those settings in more detail.
Getting Your Hands on an iPad
As of this writing, you can buy an iPad at the Apple Store and from several 
brick-and-mortar stores such as Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Sam’s Club, and Target, 
and at online sites such as MacMall. You can also buy 3G/4G models, which 
require an account with a phone service provider, from the data providers 
AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon, as well as from Apple.

Chapter 1
Buying Your iPad
Considering iPad Accessories
If you get your iPad from Apple, either at one of its retail stores or through 
its online store, here’s the difference in the buying experience.
The brick-and-mortar Apple Store advantage is that the sales staff will help 
you unpack your iPad and make sure it’s working properly, register the 
device (which you have to do before you can use it), and help you learn the 
basics. There are also occasional workshops offered to help people learn 
about how to use iPads, and Apple employees are famous for being helpful 
to customers.
However, Apple Stores aren’t on every corner, so if visiting one isn’t an option 
(or you just prefer to go it alone), you can go to the Apple Store website 
(http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipad/family/
ipad), as shown in Figure 1-2, and order one to be shipped to you (and even 
get it engraved, if you wish). Standard shipping typically is free, and if there’s a 
problem, Apple’s online-store customer service reps are very helpful — they 
will help you solve the problem or possibly replace your iPad.
Figure 1-2: iPad model options are spelled out on Apple’s site.
Considering iPad Accessories
Accessories for your iPad can make your computing life easier. You can get 
them from Apple or explore the broad and ever-growing world of third-party 
accessories.
Apple’s stable of accessories
At present, Apple offers a few accessories you might want to check out when 
you purchase your iPad (or you can purchase them down the road), including

16
Considering iPad Accessories
	
✓	iPad Smart Case/Smart Cover: Your iPad isn’t cheap, and unlike a lap­
top computer, it has an exposed screen that can be damaged if you drop 
or scratch it. Investing in the iPad Smart Case or Smart Cover is a good 
idea if you intend to take your iPad out of your house — or if you have a 
cat or grandchildren. The iPad Smart Cover costs about $40 for polyure­
thane, and the Smart Case costs $70 for leather. Other cases vary in 
price depending on design and material.
	
	The official Apple iPad Smart Case has an ingenious little slot on the 
back. You can flip the front cover back and tuck it into the slot to make 
the case rest on your desk or counter at a very handy angle for viewing 
and typing. You can also prop up the case in a kind of U-shaped configu­
ration to give presentations to others.
	
✓	iPad Camera Connection Equipment: Because there’s no USB port on 
an iPad, you can’t use a USB connection to upload photos from your dig­
ital camera or media card to your iPad. If you want to add this function­
ality, you can buy a MicroUSB camera connector and a MicroSD reader, 
each of which will set you back about $30 for the privilege.
	
✓	Stands: The Apple Store offers several stands, including the Incase 
Origami Workstation at $29.95 and the Just Mobile Upstand for iPad at 
$49.95. The Twelve South HoverBar Stand for iPad costs $116.95, and 
attaches your iPad to your computer. Twelve South BookArc is another 
good option at just $29.99. For a truly special handcrafted tablet stand, 
visit http://www.mebskitchenwares.com/accessories.html to 
buy a one-of-a-kind tablet stand made of your choice of hard woods.
	
✓	Apple Earpods with Remote and Mic: This device offers in-ear listening 
and remote control of your audio for about $29.
	
✓	Apple Digital AV Adapter: To make use of the HDMI technology that 
allows you to connect devices to output high-definition media through 
HDMI ports in TVs, monitors, and projectors, you can buy this adapter 
(see Figure 1-3) for $49.
	
✓	AirPrint Printers: There are printers available from HP, Canon, Brother, 
Lexmark, and Epson that support Apple’s AirPrint feature. Prices range 
from $129 to $399. HandyPrint and Printopia are Macintosh apps that 
can make any printer shared on a network accessible to your iPad.
	
It’s a good idea to have a spare cable available to charge your iPad in case 
one gets mislaid.
Checking out what others have to offer
If you want to explore third-party accessories, there are many, and more 
appear all the time. Just perform a web search for iPad accessories. You’ll 
find that there are suede, leather, neoprene, aluminum, and canvas cases; a 
variety of stands; carrying bags; screen protectors; and external batteries to 
supplement iPad’s impressive ten-hour battery life.

Want to stand out from the crowd by carrying your iPad around in a case 
with character? The relatively inexpensive Vintage Book case from Zazzle is 
a good option if you like the look of a rare book wrapped around your tech­
nology. If you’re made of money, the Louis Vuitton model, a high-priced 
model at $795, will make you the envy of your friends. And eBags offers 
some nice canvas bags if your tastes, and budget, are more down to earth.
Macally’s Lightning Wired keyboard is a fully extended keyboard with a num­
ber pad, which you can use with your iPad device in portrait or landscape 
mode. Aduro Facio offers a combination of case, stand, and keyboard all in 
one for only $29.99.
There are even a few clothing companies coming up with duds that can hold 
an iPad. (SCOTTeVEST, whose website is shown in Figure 1-4, offers a line of 
iPad-holding clothes. iClothing and iPad Suit are following suit — excuse 
the pun.
	
Don’t bother buying a wireless mouse to connect with your iPad via 
Bluetooth — the iPad recognizes your finger as its primary input device, 
and mice need not apply. However if you’re finger-clumsy, you can also get 
a stylus for touch input. The Wacom Bamboo is among those that I like, but 
you can get less expensive ones at stores such as Amazon with several to a 
pack so that if you lose one, you have a spare.

fter you get your hands on an iPad, you should 
explore what’s in the box and get an overview 
of the buttons and slots you’ll encounter — luckily, 
there are very few of them.
You also need to get comfortable with the touch­
screen. If you have a smartphone or computer with a 
touchscreen, you’re ahead of the game here, but even 
if you do, you should take a little time to get comfort­
able working with using the iPad screen.
iPads (with the exception of the original iPad) have two cam­
eras and a customizable side switch. In addition, iPad has native 
printing ability, all of which I introduce you to here.
Finally, after a tough day of playing with your new gadget, you need to know 
how to put it to sleep. I cover all these iPad basics in this chapter.

Exploring What’s in the Box
Exploring What’s in the Box
When you fork over your hard-earned money for your iPad, you’re left hold­
ing one box about the size of a package of copy paper. Here’s what you’ll find 
when you take off the shrink wrap and open the box:
	
✓	iPad: Your iPad is covered in two plastic sheets that you can take off and 
toss (unless you think there’s a chance you’ll return it, in which case you 
might want to keep all packaging for 14 days — Apple’s return period).
	
✓	Documentation (and I use the term loosely): You find a small, white 
envelope under the iPad itself, about the size of a half-dozen index 
cards. Open it, and you’ll find
	
•	 A single sheet titled iPad Info: This pamphlet is essentially small print 
(that you mostly don’t need to read) from folks like the FCC.
	
•	 A mysterious label sheet: This contains two white Apple logo stickers. 
(Apple has provided these for years with its products as a form of 
cheap advertising when users place stickers on places like their com­
puters or car windows.)
	
•	 A small card containing the actual documentation (sort of): This dis­
plays a picture of the iPad and callouts to its buttons on one side, 
and the other side contains about three sentences of instructions for 
setting it up and info about where to go online to find out more.
	
✓	Lightning to USB Cable: Use this cord (see Figure 2-1) to connect the 
iPad to your computer, or use it with the last item in the box, which is 
the power adapter.
	
✓	10W USB Power Adapter: The power adapter (see Figure 2-1) attaches 
to the Lightning to USB Cable (or the Dock Connector to USB Cable) so 
that you can plug it into the wall and charge the battery.

Taking a First Look at the Gadget
That’s it. That’s all there is in the box. It’s kind of the typical Apple study in 
Zen-like simplicity.
Taking a First Look at the Gadget
The little card contained in the documentation (see the preceding section) 
gives you a picture of the iPad with callouts to the buttons you’ll find on it. 
In this section, I give you a bit more information about those buttons and 
some other physical features of the iPad. Figure 2-2 shows you where each of 
these items is located.
Figure 2-2: There are probably fewer gizmos to get used to on an iPad than on the average cellphone.

22
Taking a First Look at the Gadget
Here’s the rundown on what these things are and what they do:
	
✓	(The all-important) Home button: On the iPad, press this button to go 
back to the Home screen to find just about anything. The Home screen 
displays all your installed and preinstalled apps and gives you access to 
your iPad settings. No matter where you are or what you’re doing, press 
the Home button, and you’re back at home base. You can also double-
press the Home button to pull up a scrollable display of apps called the 
App Switcher so that you can quickly move from one to another or quit 
apps that you don’t want or need to have running. (Apple refers to this 
as multitasking.) If you press and hold the Home button, you open Siri, 
the iPad voice assistant. Finally, on recent iPad models, the Home button 
contains a fingerprint reader used with the Touch ID feature.
	
✓	Sleep/Wake button: You can use this button to power up your iPad, put 
it in sleep mode, wake it up, or power it down (more about this in the 
final section of this chapter).
	
✓	Lightning connector: This is where you plug in the Lightning connector 
at the USB end to the power adapter to charge your battery or use it 
without the power adapter to sync with your computer (which you find 
out more about in Chapter 5 of this minibook). Also use this slot for the 
Camera Connection Kit or to connect various AV adapter cables.
	
✓	Cameras: iPads (except for the original iPad) offer front- and rear-facing 
cameras that you can use to shoot photos or video. The rear one is on 
the top-right corner, and you need to be careful not to put your thumb 
over it when taking shots. (I have several very nice photos of my thumb 
already.)
	
✓	Side switch: In case you hadn’t heard, the iPad screen rotates to match 
the angle you’re holding it at. If you want to stick with one orientation 
even if you spin the iPad in circles, you can use this little switch on the 
iPad mini 3 to lock the screen, which is especially handy when reading 
an e-book. (Note that some apps can override this functionality if they 
require one orientation or the other.) iPad Air 2 no longer has a side 
switch, but you can change Rotation and Volume settings in the Control 
Center (swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open Control Center).
	
✓	(Tiny, mighty) speakers: One nice surprise when I first got my iPad Air 2 
was hearing what a great little stereo sound system it has and how much 
sound can come from these tiny speakers. The speakers are located 
along one side of the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3.
	
✓	Volume: This is a volume rocker that you use like any other volume 
rocker: Press up for more volume and down for less. You can also use 
this rocker as a camera shutter button when the camera is activated.
	
✓	Headphone jack and microphone: If you want to listen to your music in 
private, you can plug a 3.5mm minijack headphone and some ⅛" head­
phones in here (including a set of Beats headphones sold through the

Charging the Battery
Apple Store, if you have one, which gives you sound to both ears). 
There’s also a tiny microphone that makes it possible to speak into your 
iPad to deliver commands or enter content using the Siri feature. Using 
Siri, you can do things like make phone calls using the Internet and dic­
tate text, or work with other apps that accept audio input.
Charging the Battery
You’ve heard about the awesome ten-hour battery life on your iPad, and it’s 
all true. My iPad showed up almost fully charged from the Apple Store, but 
even if you got yours shipped, it should’ve been at least partially charged. 
But all batteries run down eventually (the little battery icon in the iPad 
Status bar tells you when you’re running low), so one of your first priorities 
is to know how to recharge your battery. This is a pretty obvious procedure, 
given the few items that come with your iPad, but just in case you need help, 
you can follow these steps to get that battery meter up to 100 percent:
	
1.	 Gather your iPad, Lightning to USB cable (fourth generation and later) 
or Dock Connector to USB Connector (earlier models), and Apple USB 
power adapter.
	
2.	 Gently plug the USB end of the Lightning to USB Cable (or the Dock 
Connector to USB Cable) into the USB Power Adapter.
	
3.	 Plug the other end of the cord (see Figure 2-3) into the Lightning 
Connector (or Dock Connector slot) on the iPad.
Figure 2-3: Assembling the connector cord and power adapter to charge the iPad battery.

24
Turning the iPad On and Registering It
	
4.	 Unfold the two metal prongs on the power adapter (refer to Figure 2-3) 
so that they extend from it at a 90-degree angle, and plug the adapter 
into an electrical outlet.
	
Power adapters from earlier versions of iPad or other Apple devices such 
as iPhone or iPod will not work with your fourth-generation iPad or later. 
Replacement adapters are available, however, from Apple and various third-
party vendors.
Turning the iPad On and Registering It
The first time you turn on your iPad, you need to go through a sequence of 
setup steps. The best way to do this is to be in range of a Wi-Fi network.
When you’re ready to get going with your new toy, be sure you’re within 
range of a Wi-Fi network that you can connect with, and then hold the iPad 
with one hand on either side, oriented like a pad of paper. Plug the Lightning 
to USB Cable that came with your device into your iPad and plug the other 
end into a USB port on your computer, just in case you lose your battery 
charge during the setup process.
Now follow these steps to set up and register your iPad:
	
1.	 Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button on the top of your iPad until 
the Apple logo appears.
	
	 In another moment, a screen appears with a cheery Hello on it.
	
2.	 Slide your finger to the right on the screen where it says Slide to Set Up.
	
3.	 Enter a password if you have an Apple ID, choose how other people 
can reach you with text messages through the Messaging app or video 
calls through FaceTime (choose your phone number, iCloud account, 
or email account), and whether to update to iCloud Drive (an online 
storage service).
	
Be sure to update to iCloud Drive on all your devices, such as iPhone, Mac, 
or Windows PC to make sure that your iCloud-stored documents continue to 
sync to them all.
	
4.	 You next see a series of screens that involve settings such as language, 
country, Wi-Fi network, and use of iCloud.
Follow the series of screens to respond to questions and make initial set­
tings, all of which can be changed later in iPad Settings.
	
5.	 After you deal with all the setup screens, a Welcome to iPad screen 
appears; tap Get Started to display the Home screen.

Meeting the Multi-Touch Screen
	
You can choose to have certain items transferred to your iPad from your 
computer when you sync, including music, videos, downloaded apps, con­
tacts, calendars, e-books, podcasts, and browser bookmarks. You can also 
transfer to your computer content that you download directly to your iPad 
using the iTunes and App Store apps as well as content that you gather 
through the Newsstand, iBooks, Podcasts, and iTunes U apps. See Book II, 
Chapter 1 for more about these features.
Meeting the Multi-Touch Screen
When your Home screen appears (see Figure 2-4), you’ll see a pretty picture in 
the background and two sets of icons. One set appears in the Dock along the 
bottom of the screen. The Dock contains Messages, Mail, the Safari browser, 
and Music app icons by default, though you can add up to two other apps to 
it. The Dock appears on every Home screen. (You start with one Home screen, 
but adding new apps creates additional Home screens — up to 15 in all.) You 
can also nest apps in folders, which theoretically gives you the capability to 
store limitless apps on your iPad — limited, that is, only by your tablet’s 
memory.
Figure 2-4: Icons for various apps live in the Dock or on a Home screen.
Other icons representing your installed apps appear above the Dock. (I give 
you an overview of the functionality of all these apps in Chapter 4 of this 
minibook.) Different icons appear in this area on each Home screen, but this 
Home screen contains most of the preinstalled apps.

26
Meeting the Multi-Touch Screen
	
This may or may not need saying, but the screen is made of glass and will 
smudge when you touch it and break if you throw it at the wall, and contrary 
to Apple’s boasts, can also be scratched. So, be careful and treat it nicely.
Connecting with the touchscreen
The iPad touchscreen technology allows you to swipe your finger across the 
screen or tap it to provide input to the device just as you use a mouse or 
keyboard with your computer. You read more about using the touchscreen in 
the next section, but for now, go ahead and play with it for a few minutes. 
Just as you may have become used to with your mobile phone, you use the 
pads of your fingertips (not your fingernails) and do the following:
	
1.	 Tap the Settings icon.
	
	 The various settings (which you read more about throughout this book) 
appear. (See Figure 2-5.)
Figure 2-5: Settings is your central command for all things iPad.
	
2.	 To return to the Home screen, press the Home button.
	
3.	 Swipe a finger or two from right to left on the screen.
	
	 Because the iPad has a few additional Home screens available (15, to be 
exact) that you can fill up with all the apps you’ll be downloading, the 
screen shifts slightly to the left. (If you have more apps downloaded, fill­
ing additional Home screens, this action moves you to the next Home 
screen.)

27
Book I 
Chapter 2
Getting Started with 
iPad
Meeting the Multi-Touch Screen
	
	 With multiple Home screens in use, you get little dots at the bottom of 
the screen above the Dock icons, indicating which of the Home screens 
you’re on. You can tap to the right or left of the dots to move one screen 
in either direction.
	
4.	 To experience the rotating screen feature, hold the iPad firmly and 
turn it sideways.
	
	 The screen flips to a horizontal orientation. If it doesn’t, check the Side 
switch (above the volume rocker on the side of your iPad) to make sure that 
it’s not active. Though this Side switch can be set to mute the iPad rather 
than control orientation, by default it works with the orientation feature.
	
5.	 To flip the screen back, just turn the device so that it’s oriented like a 
pad of paper again.
	
6.	 Tap Music in the Dock.
	
7.	 Drag your finger down from the top of the screen to reveal the 
Notification Center (covered in Book V, Chapter 4).
	
8.	 Drag up from the bottom of the Home screen.
	
	 Notification Center disappears and the Control Center (discussed later 
in this chapter) is displayed.
	
9.	 Practice multitasking by double-pressing the Home button.
	
	 All running apps appear in a display across the middle of the screen.
	
10.	 Swipe to scroll through the apps, and tap one to jump to it without 
going back to the Home screen.
	
You can customize the Home screen by changing the wallpaper and bright­
ness. Read about making these changes in Chapter 8 of this minibook.
Goodbye, click-and-drag; hello, tap-and-swipe
If you’re like me, you’ll fall in love with the touchscreen interface that iPad 
sports. It’s just so intuitive to use your finger as a pointing device — some­
thing you’re probably already doing on your iPhone, laptop, or other mobile 
device.
You can use several methods for getting around and getting things done in 
iPad using its Multi-Touch screen, including
	
✓	Tap once. To open an application on the Home screen, choose a field 
such as a search field, select an item in a list, select an arrow to move 
back or forward one screen, or follow an online link, tap the item once 
with your finger.
	
✓	Tap twice. Use this method to enlarge or reduce the display of a web 
page (see Chapter 6 in this minibook for more about using the Safari web 
browser) or zoom in or out in the Maps app.

28
Meeting the Multi-Touch Screen
	
✓	Pinch and expand. As an alternative to the tap-twice method, you can 
pinch or expand (unpinch) two fingers (most people use their index fin­
ger and thumb) on the screen (see Figure 2-6) when you’re looking at 
photos, maps, web pages, or email messages to quickly reduce or 
enlarge them, respectively.
	
	You can use a three-finger tap to zoom your screen to be even larger, or 
use Multitasking Gestures to swipe with four or five fingers. (See 
“Exploring Multitasking Gestures,” later in this chapter.) These tech­
niques are handy if you have vision challenges.
Figure 2-6: Pinch to zoom in or out on a page.

Book I 
Chapter 2
Getting Started with

Meeting the Multi-Touch Screen
	
✓	Drag to scroll (known as swiping). When you press your finger to the 
screen and drag to the right or left, you move from one Home screen to 
another. (See Figure 2-7.) Swiping to the left on the Home screen, for 
example, moves you to the next Home screen. Swiping up while reading 
an online newspaper moves you down the page, while swiping down 
moves you back up the page.
	
✓	Flick. To scroll more quickly on a page, quickly flick your finger on the 
screen in the direction you want to move.
	
✓	Tap the status bar. To move quickly to the top of a list, web page, or 
email message, tap the Status bar at the top of the iPad screen.
Figure 2-7: Swiping gets you around a screen quickly.

30
Meeting the Multi-Touch Screen
	
✓	Tap and hold. If you’re in any application where selecting text is an 
option, such as Notes or Mail, or if you’re on a web page, tapping and 
holding on text will select a word and bring up a contextual menu with 
editing tools that allow you to select, cut, copy, or paste text, and more. 
You can also use this tap-and-hold method to reposition the insertion 
point under the magnifying glass icon that appears.
	
Notice that when you rock your iPad backward or forward, the background 
moves as well. (This parallax feature was introduced in iOS 7.) You can dis­
able this feature if it makes you seasick. Open the Settings app, tap General, 
tap Accessibility, and then set the Reduce Motion switch to Off.
To display the Notification Center, swipe down from the top of the screen 
with one finger. It lists all messages, mail, calendar events, and more in one 
handy spot.
If you feel like having a practice session, try the following steps from the 
Home screen:
	
1.	 Tap the Safari button to display the web browser.
	
	 You may be asked to enter your Wi-Fi network password to access the 
network to go online.
	
2.	 Tap a link to move to another page.
	
3.	 Double-tap the page to enlarge it; then pinch two fingers together on 
the screen to reduce its size.
	
4.	 Drag one finger around the page to scroll up or down or side to side.
	
5.	 Flick your finger quickly on the page to scroll more quickly.
	
6.	 Tap and hold your finger on text that isn’t a link.
	
	 The word is selected, and a contextual menu appears, as shown in 
Figure 2-8. Its options include Define and Copy.)
	
7.	 Release your finger.
	
8.	 Tap and hold your finger on a link or an image.
	
	 A contextual menu appears with commands that allow you to open the 
link or picture, open it in a new page, add it to your Reading List (see 
Chapter 6 in this minibook), or copy it. The menu also offers the Save 
Image command.
	
9.	 Put two fingers slightly apart on the screen and then pinch them 
together to reduce the page.
	
10.	 Press the Home button to go back to the Home screen.

Displaying and using the onscreen keyboard
Part of the beauty of iPad is that it’s highly portable, but that portability 
comes at a price: the absence of a physical keyboard. You can use a wireless 
or Bluetooth keyboard, but for short text entry, you don’t really need either. 
That’s where the onscreen keyboard comes into play, allowing you to enter 
text as you may have done on a touchscreen mobile phone.
	
iPad’s built-in keyboard appears whenever you’re in a text-entry location, 
such as in a Search field or when writing an email. With the debut of iOS 8, 
iPad makes suggestions based on the words you enter in the keyboard in the 
new QuickType bar above the keyboard, and can even recognize the person 
you’re typing a message to when you’re in Mail or Messages so that those 
suggestions are appropriate to the tone you might use with that recipient.
Follow these steps to practice using the onscreen keyboard:
	
1.	 Tap Notes on the Home screen to open this easy-to-use notepad.

4.	 Type a few words using the keyboard.
	
	 You can tap the Dictation key on the keyboard (see Figure 2-9) to activate 
the Dictation feature, and then speak your input. This requires that the Siri 
feature be turned on and an active Internet connection because the trans­
lation is done on Apple’s servers.
	
	 To get the widest keyboard display possible, rotate your iPad to be in 
landscape (horizontal) orientation, as shown in Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9: The onscreen keyboard is handiest to use in landscape orientation.
	
5.	 If you make a mistake (and you may when you first use it), use the 
Delete key (the key in the top-right corner of the keyboard with a lit­
tle x on it) to delete text to the left of the insertion point.
	
6.	 To create a new paragraph, press the Return key, just as you would on 
a computer keyboard.
	
7.	 To type numbers and some symbols, press one of the number keys

You can unlock the keyboard to move it around the screen. To do this, press 
and hold the Keyboard button on the keyboard and, from the pop-up menu 
that appears, choose Unlock. Now by pressing the Keyboard button and 
swiping up or down, you can move the keyboard up and down on the screen. 
To dock the keyboard again at the bottom of the screen, press and hold the 
Keyboard button and choose Dock from the pop-up menu. (For this to work, 
go to Settings and be sure to enable Split Keyboard in the Keyboard section 
of the General pane.)
	
To type a period and space, double-tap the spacebar. (For this to work, go to 
Settings and enable "." Shortcut in the Keyboard section of the General 
pane.)
Using the split keyboard
The Split Keyboard feature allows you to split the keyboard so that each side 
appears nearer the edge of the iPad screen. For those who are into texting 
with their thumbs, this feature makes it easier to reach all the keys from the 
sides of the device. The feature is on by default, but if it doesn’t work for 
you, it may have been turned off. (You can enable it by going to Settings and 
turning on Split Keyboard in the Keyboard section of the General pane.) 
Follow these steps to use it:
	
1.	 Open an application, such as Notes, where you can use the onscreen 
keyboard.
	
2.	 Tap in an entry field or page, which displays the onscreen keyboard.
	
3.	 Place two fingers in the middle of the onscreen keyboard and spread 
them toward the left and right.
	
	 The keyboard splits, as shown in Figure 2-11.
	
4.	 Hold the iPad with a hand on either side and practice using your 
thumbs to enter text.
	
5.	 To reconnect the split keyboard, place two fingers on each side of the 
keyboard and move them together to join them again.
	
When the keyboard is docked and unified at the bottom of your screen, you 
can also simply drag the Keyboard key upward. This both undocks and splits 
the keyboard. To reverse this, drag the Keyboard key downward. The split 
keyboard is both docked and joined into one keyboard.

Flicking to search
Can’t find that song you downloaded or an email from your boss? You’ll be 
relieved to know that a search feature in iPad called Spotlight helps you find 
suggestions from the Internet, Music, iTunes, and the App Store, as well as 
suggestions for nearby locations, photos, music, emails, contacts, movies, 
and more. This search feature can be found on the screen to the left of the 
default Home screen.
Follow these steps to access and use Spotlight:
	
1.	 Swipe downward near the top of any Home screen (but not from the 
very top or bottom of the screen).
	
	 The Search field appears.
	
2.	 Tap in the Spotlight Search field.
	
	 The keyboard appears. (See Figure 2-12.)
	
3.	 Begin entering a search term.
	
	 For example, in Figure 2-13 I typed the letter C. iPad might display any 
app, contact, music, video, or note that begins with C. As you continue 
to type a search term, the results are narrowed down to match.
	
4.	 Tap an item in the search results to open it in the associated app or player.
	
	 To close the app and go back to the Search screen, tap the Home button, 
and then tap the left side of the Home button to display the Search 
screen again.

Updating the Operating System
	
You can use some standard search techniques to narrow your search. For 
example, if you want only the emails that include both Bob Smith and Jane 
Jones, enter Smith, Jones and Bob, Jane as your search terms. To change the 
search language, tap the key on the onscreen keyboard that looks like a little 
globe to cycle through available languages.
Updating the Operating System
This book is based on the latest version of the iPad operating system at the 
time, iOS 8.0. If you have an iPad (generation 4 and later can update to iOS 
8.0), to make sure that you get the latest and greatest features in iPad, it’s a 
good idea to update right now to the latest iOS (and periodically, no matter 
which recent model of iPad you have, to receive minor upgrades). If you’ve 
set up an iCloud account on your iPad, updates will happen automatically, or 
you can update over a Wi-Fi or 3G/4G connection by going to Settings and, 
on the General pane, tapping Software Update. Note that the original iPad 
model cannot run iOS 7 or later, so this book’s coverage will not match its 
functionality in large part.
	
It’s a good idea to have your iPad plugged into a power source before you 
start to download an iOS update so that the battery doesn’t drain before the 
update is complete.
	
Before you perform an update to the iOS, make sure that you have updated 
to the latest version of iTunes on your computer. (iOS 8.0 requires iTunes 
11.4 or later.) After you do, here’s how to update the iOS via a connection 
with your computer:
	
1.	 Plug the Lightning to USB Cable (or the Dock Connector to USB Cable) 
into your iPad and plug the USB end into your computer.
	
	 When iTunes opens on your computer, look for your iPad name in the 
Devices section in the Source List on the left side of the screen (see 
Figure 2-14).
	
2.	 Click your iPad’s name in the Devices pop-up menu and then click the 
Summary tab if it’s not already displayed.
	
3.	 Read the note next to the Check for Update button to see whether 
your iOS is up to date; if it isn’t, click the Check for Update button.
	
	 iTunes checks to find the latest iOS version and walks you through the 
updating procedure.
	
Your iPad has to have enough memory to download the latest iOS. If you 
have an iPad with smaller memory, you may actually have to remove some 
apps or content such as music to make room for it before the update can 
take place.

A new iOS introduces new features for your iPad. If a new iOS version 
appears after you’ve bought this book, go to the companion website, www.
ipadmadeclear.com, for updates on new features.
Understanding Multitasking Basics
Multitasking means that you can easily switch from one app to another with­
out closing the first one and returning to the Home screen. This is accom­
plished by viewing all open apps and jumping from one to another, and 
quitting an app by simply swiping it upward. Follow these steps to multitask:
	
1.	 Open an app.
	
2.	 Press the Home button twice.
	
3.	 On the App Switcher view that appears (see Figure 2-15), scroll to 
the left or right until you find the other open app that you want to 
switch to.
	
4.	 Tap an app to switch to it.
	
Press the Home button to close the App Switcher and return to the app you 
were working in.

Figure 2-15: The App Switcher
Exploring Multitasking Gestures
Multitasking involves jumping from one app to another. Rather than using the 
Home button to open the App Switcher and then moving from one open app 
to another, you can use iOS’s multitasking gestures. You turn on these ges­
tures by tapping Settings on the Home screen, and then in the General pane, 
set the Multitasking Gestures switch to On.
Here are the three multitasking gestures:
	
✓	Swipe up with four or five fingers on any Home screen to reveal the App 
Switcher.
	
✓	Swipe down with four or five fingers to close the App Switcher.
	
✓	With an app open, swipe left or right using four or five fingers to move to 
the next app. (The apps are in order by what was most recently used, so 
swiping right opens apps from most to least recently used, whereas 
swiping left opens apps from least to most recently used.)
Examining Your iPad Cameras
iPad has both front- and rear-facing cameras. You can use the cameras to 
take still photos or shoot videos (both covered in Book II, Chapter 4). The 
fourth-generation iPad introduced a higher quality FaceTime front-facing 

40
Examining Your iPad Cameras
camera useful for making video calls. For now, take a quick look at your cam­
eras by tapping the Camera app icon on the Home screen. An image appears, 
as shown in Figure 2-16.
Figure 2-16: Simple tools let you start and stop a recording or switch between cameras.
The third-generation iPad introduced a super-clear Retina display and 
5-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera for viewing and taking the best iPad-
generated photos and video yet.
Controls located around the screen allow you to
	
✓	Switch between the front and rear cameras.
	
✓	Take a picture or start recording a video.
	
✓	Turn the new Time-Lapse feature on or off.
	
✓	Open the previously captured image or video.
When you view a photo or video, you can use several features to do things 
like send the image via AirDrop, post it to Facebook or Flickr, send it by 
email or as a tweet, print an image, use a still photo as wallpaper or assign it 
to a contact, or run a slideshow. See Book II, Chapters 3 and 4 for more 
details about using iPad cameras.

iPad
Exploring the Status Bar
	
AirDrop works only with the fourth-generation (or later) iPad and original 
iPad mini (and later). If your iPad uses the Lightning connector (the small 
oval port on the bottom), it supports AirDrop.
Customizing the Side Switch
You can customize the Side switch on your iPad mini 3 (it’s at the top-right 
side if you’re holding the iPad in vertical orientation). Use these steps to set 
it up to either control the screen orientation or mute sound:
	
1.	 From the Home screen, tap the Settings icon.
	
2.	 In the General pane, tap either the Lock Rotation or Mute option in 
the Use Side Switch To section to choose which feature you want the 
switch to control.
	
3.	 Tap the Home button to return to the Home screen.
	
4.	 Move the Side switch up or down to toggle between the settings you 
chose: screen rotation locked or unlocked, or sound muted or 
unmuted.
	
If you choose to use the Side switch to mute or unmute system sound, you 
can use the Control Center to lock and unlock the screen rotation. This 
works the same way if you have set up the switch to handle screen rotation 
and want to mute or unmute the sound using the Control Center.
Exploring the Status Bar
Across the top of your iPad screen is the Status bar. (See Figure 2-17.) Little 
icons in this area can provide some useful information, such as the time, 
your battery charge, or the status of your wireless connection. Table 2-1 lists 
some of the most common items you’ll find on the status bar.
	
Though it doesn’t sport an icon, you can swipe down on the status bar to 
display the Notification Center. This handy feature shows you all your alerts, 
updates, appointments, and more in one place.

If you have GPS, 3G or 4G, and/or a connection to a virtual private network 
(VPN), symbols appear on the status bar when these features are activated. The 
GPS and 3G icons appear only with 3G/4G–enabled iPad models. If you have a 
3G/4G model but no 3G/4G available, you may see an icon for EDGE. If you’re out 
of range of 3G/4G and EDGE, you see GPRS. Essentially, iPad tries for the best 
connection and then jumps to a lesser connection if the best isn’t available.
Using Control Center
	
Control Center is a one-stop screen for common features and settings such 
as connecting to a network, increasing screen brightness or volume, and 
using the Calculator or Camera. Control Center settings include
	
✓	Music playback controls
	
✓	Audio volume
	
✓	Airplane mode
	
✓	Wi-Fi connection
	
✓	Bluetooth
	
✓	Do Not Disturb
	
✓	Orientation Lock or Mute, depending on what the Side switch is set to con­
trol (the side switch is not available on the iPad Air 2, though these Control 
Center settings allow you to change orientation and volume settings)

Locking the iPad, Turning It Off, or Unlocking It
You’ve seen how simple it is to turn the power on for your iPad earlier in this 
chapter. Now it’s time to put it to sleep (the iPad screen goes black, but iPad 
can quickly awaken again) or turn off the power to give your new toy a rest. 
Here are the procedures you can use:
	
✓	Press the Sleep/Wake button. iPad goes to sleep and the screen goes 
black. If iPad is asleep, pressing the Sleep/Wake button does its wake-up 
thing. If you set up a Passcode Lock in the General pane of Settings, you 
need to provide a passcode to wake up your iPad.

44
Locking the iPad, Turning It Off, or Unlocking It
	
✓	Press the Home button and then use the Slide to Unlock bar. This 
wakes up iPad. Swipe the onscreen arrow on the Slide to Unlock bar to 
unlock the iPad.
	
✓	Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the Slide to Power Off bar 
appears at the top of the screen, and then swipe the bar. You’ve just 
turned off your iPad.
	
✓	Use the Smart Cover or Smart Case accessory. When you attach the 
Smart Cover and close it over your screen, iPad goes to sleep automati­
cally; it wakes up when you pull back the cover.
	
iPad automatically goes into sleep mode after a few minutes of inactivity. 
You can change the time interval at which it sleeps by adjusting the Auto-
Lock feature in Settings. (I tell you how to do that in Chapter 8 of this 
minibook.)

Pad users are all different; some face visual, motor, or 
hearing challenges. If you’re one of these folks, you’ll 
be glad to hear that iPad offers some handy accessi­
bility features.
To make your screen easier to read, you can adjust 
the brightness or change wallpaper. You can also 
set up the VoiceOver feature to read onscreen ele­
ments out loud. Then there are a slew of features 
you can turn on or off, including Zoom, Invert 
Colors, Speak Selection, Large Type, and more.
If you struggle to hear your computer’s sounds at times, 
you can do the obvious and adjust the system volume. The 
iPad also has settings for mono audio (useful when you’re wear­
ing headphones) and a setting to use Speak Auto-text. iPad features 
that help you deal with physical and motor challenges include Assistive Touch 
for those who have difficulty using the iPad touch screen, Switch Control for 
working with adaptive accessories, and the Home Click Speed and Call Audio 
Routing settings that allow you to adjust how quickly you have to tap the iPad 
screen to work with features.

46
Setting Brightness
Finally, the Guided Access feature provides help for those who have difficulty 
focusing on one task, and also provides a handy mode for showing presenta­
tions of content in settings where you don’t want users to flit off to other apps, 
as in school or at a public kiosk.
Setting Brightness
Especially when using iPad as an e-reader, you may find that a slightly less-
bright screen reduces strain on your eyes. To adjust screen brightness, fol­
low these steps:
	
1.	 Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
	
2.	 In Settings, tap Display & Brightness.
	
3.	 To control brightness manually, tap the Auto-Brightness On/Off switch 
(see Figure 3-1) to turn off this feature.
Figure 3-1: Lower brightness on your screen can also save battery life.
	
4.	 Tap and drag the Brightness slider (refer to Figure 3-1) to the right to 
make the screen brighter or to the left to make it dimmer.
	
5.	 Press the Home button to close Settings.
	
If glare from the screen is a problem for you, consider getting a screen 
­protector. This thin film not only protects your screen from damage but can 
also reduce glare.

Changing the Wallpaper
The default iPad background image may be pretty, but it may not be the one 
that works best for you. Choosing different wallpaper may help you to see all 
the icons on your Home screen. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Start by tapping Settings on the Home screen.
	
2.	 In Settings, tap Wallpaper and then tap the > character to the right of

as Stills, as shown in Figure 3-3, to view choices; then tap a sample to 
select it.
	
	 Alternatively, on the initial wallpaper screen, tap an album in Photos to 
locate a picture to use as your wallpaper; then tap it.
	
4.	 Tap Set Lock Screen, Set Home Screen, or Set Both.
	
5.	 Press the Home button to return to your Home screen with the new 
wallpaper set as the background.

If you choose a picture from your Photos gallery for wallpaper, tap the 
Perspective Zoom setting at the bottom of the preview screen to have the 
background move behind the apps on the Home page as you move the iPad 
around.
Setting Up VoiceOver
VoiceOver reads the names of screen elements and settings to you, but it 
also changes the way you provide input to the iPad. In Notes, for example, 
you can have VoiceOver read the name of the Notes buttons to you, and 
when you enter notes, it will read words or characters you’ve entered. It can 
also tell you whether features such as Auto-Correction are on. To turn on 
this feature, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen. Tap General and then tap 
Accessibility.
	
2.	 In the Accessibility pane shown in Figure 3-4, tap the VoiceOver 
button.
	
3.	 In the VoiceOver pane, shown in Figure 3-5, tap the VoiceOver On/Off 
switch to turn on this feature.
	
	 With VoiceOver on, you must first single-tap to select an item, such as a 
button, which causes VoiceOver to read the name of the button to you. 
Then you must double-tap the button to activate its function. (VoiceOver 
reminds you about this if you turn on Speak Hints, which is helpful when 
you first use VoiceOver, but it soon becomes annoying.)

	 This is the new method of tapping that VoiceOver activates.
	
5.	 Practice using gestures such as pinching or flicking left, and 
VoiceOver tells you what action each gesture initiates.

Using VoiceOver
	
6.	 Tap the Done button and then double-tap it to return to the VoiceOver 
pane.
	
7.	 Tap the Speak Hints On/Off switch, and then double-tap the same button. 
VoiceOver speaks the name of each tapped item.
	
8.	 If you want VoiceOver to read words or characters to you (for example, 
in the Notes app), tap and then double-tap Typing Feedback.
	
9.	 In the Typing Feedback pane, tap and then double-tap to select the 
option you prefer.
	
	 The Words option causes VoiceOver to read words to you, but not char­
acters, such as the “dollar sign” ($). The Characters and Words option 
causes VoiceOver to read both.
	
10.	 Press the Home button to return to the Home screen.
	
	 Read the next task to find out how to navigate your iPad after you’ve 
turned on VoiceOver.
	
You can change the language that VoiceOver speaks. In the General pane of 
Settings, choose Language & Region and then iPad Language and select 
another language. This action, however, also changes the language used for 
labels on apps on the Home screen and various settings and fields in iPad.
	
You can use the Accessibility Shortcut setting to help you more quickly turn 
the VoiceOver, Zoom, Switch Control, Assistive Touch, Grayscale, or Invert 
Colors features on and off. In the Accessibility settings, tap Accessibility 
Shortcut. In the settings that appear, choose what you want a triple-click of the 
Home button to activate. Now a triple-click with a single finger on the Home 
button provides you with the option you selected wherever you go in iPad.
Using VoiceOver
After VoiceOver is turned on, you need to figure out how to use it. I won’t kid 
you — using it is awkward at first, but you’ll get the hang of it! Here are the 
main onscreen gestures you should know how to use:
	
✓	Tap an item to select it. VoiceOver then speaks its name.
	
✓	Double-tap the selected item. This action activates the item.
	
✓	Flick three fingers. It takes three fingers to scroll around a page with 
VoiceOver turned on.
Table 3-1 provides additional gestures to help you use VoiceOver. I suggest 
that if you want to use this feature often, you read the VoiceOver section of 
the iPad’s User Guide, which goes into a great deal of detail about the ins and 
outs of using VoiceOver. You’ll find the User Guide at http://manuals.

so that white backgrounds are black and black text is white.
	
	The Invert Colors feature works well in some places and not so well in 
others. For example, in the Photos application, pictures appear almost 
as photo negatives. Your Home screen image will likewise look a bit 
strange. And don’t even think of playing a video with this feature turned 
on! However, if you need help reading text, Invert Colors can be useful in 
several applications.

Adjusting the Volume
	
✓	Larger Type: If having larger text in apps such as Contacts, Mail, and 
Notes would be helpful to you, you can turn on the Larger Type feature 
and choose the text size that works best for you.
	
✓	Bold Text: Turning on this setting will first restart your iPad (after ask­
ing you for permission to do so) and then cause text in various apps and 
in Settings to be bold. This is a handy setting because text in the iOS 7 
redesign (also used by iOS 8) was simplified, meaning that it got thinner!
	
✓	Increase Contrast: Use this setting to set up backgrounds in some areas 
of iPad and apps with greater contrast, which should improve visibility.
	
✓	Reduce Motion: Tap this accessibility feature and then tap the On/Off 
switch to turn off the parallax effect, which causes the background of 
your Home screens to appear to float as you move the phone around.
	
✓	Manage On/Off Labels: If you have trouble making out colors, and so 
have trouble telling when an On/Off setting is On (green) and Off (white), 
use the On/Off Labels setting to add a circle to the right of a setting when 
it’s off and a white vertical line to a setting when it’s on (see Figure 3-6).
Figure 3-6: Can’t see what’s on and what’s off? Use the Manage 
Labels setting.
Adjusting the Volume
Though individual apps such as Music and Video have their own volume set­
tings, you can set your iPad system volume for your ringer (essentially 
alarms) and alerts as well to help you hear important alerts.

Setting Up Subtitles and Captioning
To adjust the volume, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen and then tap Sounds.
	
2.	 In the Sounds pane that appears (see Figure 3-7), tap and drag the 
Ringer and Alerts slider to the right to increase the volume of these 
audible attention grabbers, or to the left to lower it.
Figure 3-7: If you want to control ringer and alerts from the volume 
buttons, tap Change with Buttons here.
	
3.	 Press the Home button to close Settings.
	
In the Sounds pane, you can turn on or off the sounds that iPad makes when 
certain events occur (such as receiving new mail or Calendar alerts). These 
sounds are turned on by default.
Setting Up Subtitles and Captioning
Closed captioning and subtitles help folks with hearing challenges enjoy 
entertainment and educational content. Follow these steps to turn them on:
	
1.	 From the Accessibility pane in Settings, tap Subtitles and Captioning.
	
2.	 On the following screen, shown in Figure 3-8, tap the On/Off switch to 
turn on Closed Captions and SDH (Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of 
Hearing).
	
	 If you’d like, you can also tap Style and choose a text style for the captions.

54
Managing Other Hearing Settings
Figure 3-8: Closed-captioning is available only in certain movies.
	
3.	 Tap the Style setting and a menu of font styles for captions and subti­
tles appears. Tap Default, Large Text, or Classic.
	
	 If you want to get your own look, tap Create New Style.
Managing Other Hearing Settings
A couple of hearing accessibility settings are simple on/off settings, including
	
✓	Mono Audio. Using the stereo effect in headphones or a headset breaks 
up sounds so that you hear a portion in one ear and a portion in the 
other ear, to simulate the way your ears process sounds (unless there is 
only one channel of sound, in which case that sound is sent to both 
ears). However, if you’re hard of hearing or deaf in one ear, you’re hear­
ing only a portion of the sound in your hearing ear, which can be frus­
trating. If you have such hearing challenges and want to use iPad with a 
headset connected, you should turn on Mono Audio. When it’s turned 
on, all sound is combined and distributed to both ears.
	
✓	Have iPad Speak Auto-text. The Speak Auto-text feature, which you 
access through the Speech selection under Accessibility, speaks auto-
corrections and auto-capitalizations (you can turn on both these fea­
tures using Keyboard settings). When you enter text in an app such as 
Notes or Mail, the app then makes either type of change, while Speak 
Auto-text lets you know what change was made.

55

Turning On and Working with AssistiveTouch
	
	Why would you want iPad to tell you whenever an auto-correction has 
been made? If you have vision challenges and you know that you typed 
ain’t when writing dialogue for a character in your novel, but iPad cor­
rected it to isn’t, you would want to know. Similarly, if your son’s girl­
friend’s name is SUNshine (don’t worry, he’ll break up with her soon) 
and auto-capitalization corrects it (incorrectly), you need to know 
immediately so that you can change it back again.
Turning On and Working with AssistiveTouch
The AssistiveTouch Control panel helps those who have challenges working 
with buttons to provide input to iPad using the touchscreen.
To turn on AssistiveTouch, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen, and then tap General and Accessibility.
	
2.	 In the Accessibility pane, scroll down and tap AssistiveTouch.
	
3.	 In the pane that appears, tap the On/Off switch for AssistiveTouch to 
turn it on (see Figure 3-9).
	
	 A gray square (called the AssistiveTouch Control panel) then appears on 
the right side of the pane. This square now appears in the same location 
in whatever Home screen or apps you display on your iPad, though you 
can move it around the screen using your finger.
	
4.	 Tap the AssistiveTouch Control panel to display options, as shown in 
Figure 3-10.
Figure 3-9: Turn on the AssistiveTouch feature here.

56
Turning On and Working with AssistiveTouch
Figure 3-10: AssistiveTouch displays a small panel that’s always present.
	
5.	 Tap Favorites or Device on the panel to see additional choices, tap Siri 
to activate the personal assistant feature, tap Notification Center or

In addition to using Siri, don’t forget about using the Dictation key on the 
onscreen keyboard to speak text entries and basic keyboard commands.
Managing Home Click Speed
Sometimes if you have dexterity challenges, it’s hard to double-tap or triple-
tap the Home button fast enough to have an effect. Choose the Slow or 
Slowest setting when you tap the Home Click Speed setting to allow you a bit 
more time to make that second or third tap:
	
1.	 Tap Settings➪General➪Accessibility.
	
2.	 Scroll down and tap Home Click Speed.
	
3.	 Tap the Slow or Slowest settings to change how rapidly you have to 
double- or triple-tap your screen to initiate an action.
	
If you have certain adaptive accessories, you can use head gestures to con­
trol your iPad, highlighting features in sequence and then selecting one. Use 
the Switch Control feature in the Accessibility settings to turn this mode on 
and make settings for this feature.
Focusing Learning with Guided Access
Guided Access is a feature that you can use to limit a user’s access to the 
iPad to a single app, and even limit access to that app to certain features. 
This is useful in several ways, ranging from use in a classroom to use by 
someone with attention deficit disorder, and even in a public setting such as 
a kiosk where you don’t want users to be able to open other apps. To use 
this feature, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings and then tap General.
	
2.	 Tap Accessibility and then tap Guided Access, and on the pane that 
appears (see Figure 3-11), tap Guided Access to turn on the feature.
	
3.	 Tap Passcode Settings and then tap Set Guided Access Passcode to 
activate a passcode so that those using an app cannot return to the 
Home screen to access other apps.
	
4.	 In the Set Passcode pane that appears (see Figure 3-12), enter a pass­
code using the numeric pad. Enter the number again when prompted.
	
5.	 Press the Home button and tap an app to open it.
	
6.	 Press the Home button three times.

✓	Using cameras and organizing and sharing your photos
✓	Getting organized with Calendar, Contacts, Notes, and Reminders
✓	Going places with Maps
✓	Using apps for e-reading and playing music, podcasts, and videos

i

Pad comes with certain functionality and applications 
(which you probably know as apps, for short) already 
installed. When you look at your Home screen (1 of 15 
possible Home screens that you can fill with other 
apps without doing workarounds to add more Home 
screens), you’ll see 15 icons for apps, plus 1 for 
accessing iPad Settings.
Four icons are displayed across the bottom in 
iPad’s Dock: Messages, Mail, Safari, and Music. The 
other apps (Videos, Photos, Camera, Maps, Clock, 
Photo Booth, Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Reminders, 
Newsstand, iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks, Game 
Center, and FaceTime) are above the Dock and include 
apps for organizing your time and contacts, playing 
videos and reading periodicals, snapping pictures, gaming, 
shopping for content, and yet more. An Extras folder contains 
helpful Tips and the My Podcasts app.
The Dock icons appear on every Home screen. The others appear on the 
first Home screen unless you move them elsewhere. Note that you can add 
up to two additional apps to the Dock, if you want to have those apps 

62
Getting Online with iPad
available on every Home screen or replace apps in the Dock with others. 
With iOS 8, iBooks and Podcasts are included as bundled apps, and they 
appear on the second Home screen.
This chapter gives you a quick overview of what each bundled app does. 
You find out more about every one of them as you move through the chap­
ters in this book.
	
Settings is a very important item on the Home screen you should know 
about: It’s the central location in iPad where you can adjust all the settings 
for various functions, change settings for how apps (both preinstalled and 
the ones you add) function, and perform administrative tasks like setting up 
email accounts or a password. Read more about using Settings in Chapter 8 
of this minibook. You can also find advice about using settings for various 
apps in Books II, III, and V, and information about email settings in Chapter 7 
of this minibook.
Another built-in feature (but not an app on your Home screen) to check out 
is Siri. See Book V, Chapter 6 for more about this cool personal assistant that 
does everything from finding the nearest Italian restaurant to providing the 
latest stock quotes.
Getting Online with iPad
iPad would kind of be a very expensive calendar, address book, and music 
player if you couldn’t go online to browse, buy things, get email, stream 
video and audio, and more. Two bundled apps, Safari and Mail, help to con­
nect your iPad to many of the Internet’s resources.
Going on Safari
Safari is Apple’s web browser. If you’ve owned a Mac computer, iPhone, or 
iPod touch, you’ve already used Safari (see Figure 4-1) to navigate around 
the Internet, create and save bookmarks of favorite sites, and add web clips 
to your Home screen so that you can quickly visit favorite sites from there.
	
If you’ve been a Windows user in the past, you may also have used Safari, or 
you may be more familiar with browsers such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, 
or Firefox. If you haven’t used Safari, don’t worry; the browser should be 
pretty easy for you to get the hang of, with its familiar integrated address/
search field, tabs, navigation buttons, and bookmarks.
Using a browser on iPad is a lot of fun because of the touchscreen functional­
ity that gives you the ability to zoom in or out on a page by flicking two fin­
gers inward or outward. Tabbed browsing allows you to move easily among 
open web pages, and the All Tabs view new with iOS 8 for iPad lets you see 
all your open tabs as thumbnails on a single screen. You can read more 
about using Safari in Chapter 6 of this minibook.

Be sure to check out iCloud connectivity with a feature called Handoff. If you 
have several Apple devices, you can use iCloud tabs to pick up where you 
left off searching or viewing tabs on one device on another.
	
You can get done much of what you want to do on your iPad by using Siri. 
This personal assistant, which you learn more about in Book V, Chapter 6, 
can help you go to a web page, create and send an email, enter an event in 
Reminders or Calendar, and more.
Getting Mail
iPad lets you get all your mail in one place through the Mail app — the pro­
gram you use to access email accounts you set up in iPad. You can set up 
accounts that you have with popular email providers such as Gmail, Yahoo!, 
AOL, and Outlook.com. You can also access accounts through iCloud or 
Microsoft Exchange/Office 365. (Your work email account might use 
Microsoft Exchange, for example.) Almost any IMAP- or POP3-type account 
(the two most common mail protocols) is supported, which lets you access 
the email accounts you have with your Internet service provider (ISP).
After you set up an account, when you tap the Mail icon, your email will 
display without your having to browse to a site or sign in. Then you can 
use tools to move among preset mail folders, read and reply to mail, and 
download attached photos to the iPad. You can also use the Print feature in 
Mail to print your email messages to a printer that supports AirPrint. You 
can read more about setting up and using email accounts in Chapter 7 of 
this minibook.

64
Shooting and Organizing Photos
	
In portrait orientation, emails are displayed full screen, and you can use a 
drop-down menu to view your inbox. In landscape orientation, the inbox 
stays put on the left side of your screen.
	
iPad users (except those with an original iPad or iPad 2) can use the 
Dictation feature to enter email addresses and messages in Mail by tapping 
the Dictation key on the onscreen keyboard and speaking them. See 
Chapter 3 in this minibook for more about the Dictation feature.
Using iMessage to connect
iPad’s instant messaging app is called Messages. This app allows you to use 
the iMessage service to swap text messages with others in real time using a 
cellphone number or email address. You can forward your conversations to 
others as well.
You can use the Messages settings to turn on the app or allow others to get a 
read receipt when you’ve read their messages. You can also use the data in 
your Contacts app to make addressing messages quick and easy. New with 
iOS 8 comes the ability to send audio or video messages.
Shooting and Organizing Photos
All iPads (except for the original iPad) include front- and rear-facing cam­
eras. You can use the cameras to take still photos or shoot videos (both of 
which are covered in Book II, Chapter 4). To review and play around with 
photos you snap or bring onto the iPad from another source, you have the 
Photos app.
Examining the iPad cameras
The third-generation and later iPads have a super-clear Retina display and 
rear-facing iSight camera for viewing and taking the best iPad-generated 
photos and video yet.
Take a quick look at your camera’s features by tapping the Camera app icon 
on the Home screen.
You can use the controls in the Camera app to
	
✓	Switch between the front and rear cameras.
	
✓	Change from still-camera to video-camera operation by using the 
Camera/Video slider.
	
✓	Take a picture or start recording a video.
	
✓	Turn on a grid to help you autofocus on still photo subjects.

Book I 
Chapter 4
Overview of 
Bundled Apps
Shooting and Organizing Photos
	
✓	Use square, time-lapse, or panorama settings and use filters to modify 
the colors and other effects on a shot.
	
✓	Open previously captured images or videos.
When you view a photo or video, you can use an iPad feature to send the 
image via a tweet or email, share it via iCloud Photo Sharing, send it to those 
close to you via AirDrop, post it to your Facebook or Flickr account, print 
images, use a still photo as wallpaper or assign it to represent a contact, or 
run a slideshow or edit a video. See Book II, Chapters 4 and 6 for more detail 
about using the iPad cameras.
Perusing your photos
Photos isn’t exactly Photoshop or any other sophisticated photo-imaging 
program — it’s just a pretty simple app for organizing and viewing photos 
with a few very simple editing tools including a set of filters for cool effects. 
Still, although it doesn’t do much, its features are very easy to use.
	
Photos (see Figure 4-2) allows you to organize pictures in folders; email, mes­
sage, or tweet photos to others or post photos to Facebook; use a photo as 
your iPad wallpaper; or upload someone’s picture to a contact record. Photos 
organizes photos by year or location taken.
You can use tools to apply filters, rotate, enhance, remove red-eye, or crop 
photos. You can also run slideshows of your photos. You can open albums, 
use the pinch or expand gestures to shrink or enlarge photos, and scroll 
through photos with a swipe.
Figure 4-2: A simple but fun way to view your photos.

66
Using Apps to Stay Organized
You can use the Photo Sharing feature to share photos among your friends. 
In addition, you can share photos and other content using Twitter, Flickr, 
iCloud Photo Sharing, or Facebook from right within several apps, including 
Photos.
The sexy part of Photos is the way you interact with the photos with your 
fingers on the touchscreen, moving from one collection to another, scrolling 
through collections, and expanding or shrinking photos. You can also use 
Photos to convert your iPad into a digital photo frame while you have it 
docked or charging, and you can run slideshows of your photo albums as 
well. If Photos sounds like fun (and it is), read more about how it works in 
Book II, Chapter 6.
Using Apps to Stay Organized
Scheduling your time, tracking contacts, jotting down notes — they’re all a 
part of keeping organized in today’s hectic world. iPad offers five apps to 
help you do just that: Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, Clock, and Notes.
	
More recent iPads have native print capability, which can be useful for print­
ing Notes documents, for example. You have to have a printer that supports 
AirPrint wireless printing to use this method. See Book V, Chapter 1 for more 
about printing.
	
iPads have a multitasking feature that you can turn on or off in the General 
pane in Settings. That means that you don’t have to return to the Home 
screen every time you want to switch among all these great apps. As on the 
iPhone, multitasking is dead simple. With one app open, just press the Home 
button twice or place five fingers on the screen and pinch them together. A 
horizontal display of app icons for any open apps appears along the middle 
of the screen along with photos of recent contacts. Scroll to find the one you 
want, tap it, and it opens. To quit an app, just slide it upward. You can also 
use four fingers and swipe to the left or right to move through any currently 
running apps or apps you’ve used recently.
Tracking your schedule with Calendar
What would any computing device today be without a calendar feature, given 
our busy lives? If the calendar features on your computer and mobile phone 
don’t already keep you on track, try iPad’s Calendar. This app provides a 
handy onscreen daybook that you can use to set up appointments and send 
alerts to remind you about them. You can also sync Calendar with other calen­
dars that you maintain online such as on Google, Yahoo!, computer-based 
­calendars via iTunes, or iCloud.
See Chapter 5 in this minibook for more about syncing and Book V, Chapter 3 
for details on using Calendar.

Using Apps to Stay Organized
Keeping in touch with Contacts
Today, it’s all about who you know and staying in touch. Contacts is the 
built-in address book feature (see Figure 4-3) for the iPad that lets you do 
just that. You can use Contacts to enter contact information (including pho­
tos, if you like, from your Photos app) and share contact information via Mail 
or Messages. You can also use a search feature to find contacts easily.
Contacts is another app that you can sync with your iPhone or computer to 
save you tedious reentry of information. Read more about this in Book V, 
Chapter 5.
	
Want to find your contact in the real world? Tap that person’s address in 
Contacts, and the iPad Maps app shows you how to get there! You can also 
tap an address that you find in Maps and add it to Contacts.
Figure 4-3: Keep the basics about all your contacts in this handy app.
Making Notes
Notes is a simple notepad app in which you can enter text or cut and paste text 
from a website or email. You can’t do much except create and edit your notes, 
or email or print them — the app has no features for formatting text or inserting 
objects. You’ll find Notes handy, though, for simple scribbles on the fly.
You’ll feel right at home with the clean interface that Notes sports. The font also 
has a clean, sans-serif look, and the icons along the top are pretty straightfor­
ward. You can move to the previous note, email a note, trash a note, or move to 
the next note. You can even tap the Dictation key on the onscreen keyboard of 
an iPad (except for the original iPad and iPad 2) and speak your content.

68
Going Places with Maps
If this simple note-keeper appeals to you, read more about the Notes app in 
Book V, Chapter 2.
	
You can enter info into Notes using Dictation or the onscreen keyboard. If 
you are a heavy note taker and dictating notes has no appeal, consider buy­
ing a compatible Bluetooth keyboard or keyboard dock for easier typing.
Keeping yourself on track with Reminders
Reminders is a handy electronic to-do list in which you can enter tasks or 
pull tasks from the Calendar app. You can organize reminders into custom 
categories and see them in a list or organized by date, which also displays a 
useful monthly calendar on one side of the screen.
Of course, an obvious feature of an app called Reminders is that you can set 
it up to remind you of an event. Location-based reminders (which work most 
efficiently with the always-on 3G or 4G connection on iPad 3G/4G models) 
prompt your iPad to remind you about an event based on your location; for 
example, set a reminder to buy milk when you get to a specific location, and 
you receive the alert when you arrive at the market. This feature uses 
Location Services to track your whereabouts at any point in time.
Staying on time with Clock
This app is a simple utility that is especially useful to all you world travelers. 
Clock allows you to display clocks from around the world side by side, so if 
you’re in Paris, you can easily see what time it is in New York.
Clock also has a feature that lets you set alarms to keep your day on sched­
ule. Finally, you can use timer and stopwatch features. The timer lets you do 
things like time the cookies you just put in the oven, and the stopwatch lets 
you add up the minutes of your morning jog or workout. You can even use 
the lap-timer feature to keep track of multiple laps in a workout, such as 
those runs around the track or swimming pool laps.
Going Places with Maps
The Maps app allows you to view classic maps or aerial views of addresses; 
get directions from one place to another by car or on foot; and check on traf­
fic in large cities.
If you own a Wi-Fi–only iPad, a less sophisticated system than 3G/4G can 
identify your current location and help you find directions from there to 
other places. 3G/4G iPad owners enjoy a much more targeted location sys­
tem using GPS, but all models can take advantage of the ability to bookmark 
or share locations, or add an address to Contacts.
See Book III, Chapter 2 for step-by-step procedures for using the Maps app.

Being Entertained by iPad
Being Entertained by iPad
One of the joys of the iPad is its use as a media consumption tool. Playing 
music and watching videos are very entertaining uses of iPad, indeed. The 
bundled Music and Videos apps make playing media easy to do. In addition, 
by using the iBooks app, you can use your iPad as an e-reader, and the 
Podcasts app opens up a world of audio content.
Playing around with Music
Unless you’ve been living in a cave without 3G/4G or satellite TV for the last 
several years, you know perfectly well that the iPod has historically been the 
Apple-preferred player. On your iPad, the Music app is your media player 
with a heavy emphasis on music. You can use Music to play music, audio 
podcasts, or audiobooks.
One of the nicest things about Music on the iPad is the fact that the iPad 
comes with a very nifty sound system and stereo speakers, so listening with 
or without headphones will be a pleasing experience for everyone who’s 
addicted to MP3 listening devices. You can also browse your music by a vari­
ety of criteria, such as artist, album, song, or genre.
	
iOS 8 gives Siri access to the Shazam music identifier service. Sitting in a 
café and want to know what that song is that’s playing on the music system? 
Just ask Siri, which checks with Shazam and offers you the chance to buy the 
music from the iTunes Store
Watching Videos
You can use the Videos app to play TV or movies, and it offers some useful 
features for controlling video playback.
The Videos app is a media player like Music, but it specializes in playing vid­
eos and offers a few more features, such as breakdowns of the various chap­
ters in the video and information about related movies and casts for media 
you got from iTunes. You can move between widescreen and full-screen dis­
play, and it shines at showing high-definition content, especially with the 
third-generation (and later) iPad’s awesome Retina display. See Book II, 
Chapter 3 for more on the Videos app.
Reading e-books
With iOS 8, the popular e-reader app, iBooks, comes preinstalled. Using this 
app, you can read books, add highlights and bookmarks to text, look up defi­
nitions, and more. You can access the iBooks Store from iBooks to buy con­
tent, or use other sources to purchase and download books.
iBooks allows you to adjust text size and background to make your book 
pages more readable. Also, the iPad’s highly portable size makes taking your

books on the road very easy. For more about downloading apps for your 
iPad, see Book II, Chapter 1, and to work with the iBooks’s e-reader app 
itself, go to Book II, Chapter 7.
Listening to Podcasts
My Podcasts is another app that now comes preinstalled on your iPad in the 
Extras folder. My Podcasts is a gateway to a world of audio content, from pop­
ular content such as The Daily Show to comedy and motivational talks. Most 
podcasts are free, and you can download individual shows or subscribe to 
ones that publish on a regular basis.
Going Shopping at iTunes and the App Store
The iTunes app takes you to the iTunes Store, where you can shop’til you 
drop (or your iPad battery runs out of juice) for music, movies, TV shows, 
and audiobooks and then download them directly to your iPad. You can also 
preview content before you download it. See Chapter 5 in this minibook for 
more about how to buy apps, and www.dummies.com/extras/ipadaio 
for a listing of some of the very best apps out there.
Ready for more shopping? Tapping the App Store icon takes you directly to 
the Apple online store, where you can buy and download apps that do every­
thing from enabling you to play games to building business presentations. At 
last count, more than 550,000+ apps were available for the iPad, with more 
being added all the time. Some were created for iPhone/iPod touch and run 
on the iPad; some were created especially for the iPad. And some are even 
free!
	
Check out the iTunes U app that gives you access to hundreds of great 
online courses from sources such as major universities. You can download 
iTunes U for free from the App Store.
Reading Periodicals with Newsstand
Newsstand is a handy interface for subscribing to and reading magazines, 
newspapers, and other periodical apps. Publications you subscribe to are 
laid out in neat rows on virtual shelves, and there’s a handy Store button to 
shop for more periodicals.
Playing with Game Center
Game Center is a way to essentially browse game apps in the App Store by 
bestselling titles and compare your scores with your friends. Tap Game 
Center on your Home screen and tap one of the sets of colorful icons that

appear on the Game Center screen, and you’re taken to the App Store, with 
information about a game displayed.
From then on, it’s about obtaining the game (either free or for a price 
through your iTunes account) and playing it. You can add friends to build 
your gaming social network and play and track scores for interactive games. 
See Chapter 5 in this minibook for more about buying apps, and Book II, 
Chapter 8 for more about gaming with your iPad.
Connecting with Friends on FaceTime
iPads (with the exception of the original iPad) ship with front- and rear-facing 
cameras, which unleash all kinds of possibilities. One of the coolest is using an 
app called FaceTime. The FaceTime video calling app lets you use the iPad’s 
video cameras to talk face-to-face with someone who has an iPad (except an 
original iPad); Mac (running OS X 10.6.6 or later); fourth- or later-generation 
iPod touch; or iPhone 4 or later. (See Figure 4-4.) You can call someone via his 
or her iPhone cellphone number or email address.
Figure 4-4: Talk face-to-face using FaceTime.
FaceTime even works directly over a cellular connection, though you’ll pay 
for it by eating up your data allotment.
	
You can also hold audio-only FaceTime sessions. This feature is handy when 
you don’t want to drain battery power, when you want to use less band­
width, or when you’re having a bad hair day.

Exploring Fun Photo Effects with Photo Booth
You’ll want to start trying FaceTime with all your friends who own a compat­
ible Apple device, so head straight to Book II, Chapter 4 to get up to speed 
on FaceTime features.
Exploring Fun Photo Effects with Photo Booth
The very fun Photo Booth app has been included with Mac OS X for some 
time, and it came to the iPad with the release of iOS 5. It lets you take photos 
with weird and wonderful results (see Figure 4-5). You can use the built-in 
effects, such as Kaleidoscope, Mirror, and Thermal Camera, along with your 
iPad camera, to take photos that turn out unlike any others.

✓	Updating your apps
A

pple designed its iTunes desktop application as a way for you to man­
age settings for how your iPad syncs with your computer. Using 
iTunes, you can share information and content such as calendar events, pic­
tures, music, movies, and contacts. Before you can use iTunes to sync 
from a PC, you have to download the software, and if you want to 
make purchases from the store, you need to open an iTunes 
account, both of which I cover in this chapter. You can 
also use the iCloud service to store and share content 
online using a Wi-Fi connection. In this chapter, I 
cover how to set up an iCloud account and make set­
tings to back up and share content in the cloud.
But iTunes isn’t just for syncing content. Some apps, 
such as Contacts and Videos, come preinstalled on 
your iPad. But as you know if you’re an iPhone user, 
a world of other apps is out there, including many 
that are designed specifically for your iPad. After you 
set up iTunes, you can buy apps (or download free 
ones) in the App Store using your iTunes account. Some 
are free and some come for a price (typically from 99¢ to 
about $10, though a few go up to $50 or more).
In this chapter, I tell you how to connect to the Internet (you need an 
Internet connection to access the App Store). Then I tell you how to set 
iTunes and iCloud to sync your iPad with other devices and how you can 
acquire apps for your iPad through the App Store.

74
Connecting to the Internet
	
After you have an iTunes account, you can also shop iTunes for music, videos, 
audiobooks, and more. See Book II, Chapter 1 for more about shopping for 
multimedia content.
Connecting to the Internet
To browse the web, access Mail, and shop online, you first have to be con­
nected to the Internet, so I’m putting this information right up front. How 
you connect to the Internet depends on which iPad model you own:
	
✓	The Wi-Fi–only iPad connects to the Internet, logically enough, via a Wi-Fi 
network. You may already have set up this type of network in your own 
home using your computer and some equipment from your Internet pro­
vider. You can also connect through public Wi-Fi networks (hotspots). You 
probably have already noticed how many hotspots your town or city has: 
Look for Internet cafés, coffee shops, hotels, libraries, and transportation 
centers such as airports or bus stations. In fact, after you start looking, 
you’ll notice lots of signs alerting you to free Wi-Fi locations — they’re 
everywhere.
	
✓	If you own a Wi-Fi and 3G- or Wi-Fi and 4G-enabled iPad, you can still 
use a Wi-Fi connection (which is usually much faster if you have a good 
connection), but you can also use a paid data network through AT&T, 
Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon to connect via a cellular network just about 
anywhere you can get cellular phone coverage. If you have a 3G or 4G 
model, you don’t have to do anything; with a contract for coverage, the 
connection is made automatically wherever cellular service is available, 
just as it is on your cellphone.
	
See Chapter 1 in this minibook for more about the capabilities of different 
iPad models and the costs associated with a cellular network.
When you’re in range of a hotspot, a pop-up may display automatically; if it 
doesn’t, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
2.	 Tap Wi-Fi.
	
3.	 Be sure that Wi-Fi is set to On (see Figure 5-1) and choose a network to 
connect to.
	
	 Network names should appear automatically when you’re in range of 
networks. When you’re in range of a public hotspot, if access to several 
nearby networks is available, you may see a message asking you to tap a 
network name to select it.

Setting Up iTunes
Figure 5-1: Turning on Wi-Fi.
	
4.	 After you select a network (or if only one network is available), you 
may see a message asking for your password; if you do, enter the 
password.
	
	 You may need to ask the owner of the hotspot (for example, a hotel desk 
clerk or business owner) for this password or enter your home network 
password.
	
5.	 Tap the Join button and you’re connected.
	
Free public Wi-Fi networks typically don’t require passwords. However, it’s 
therefore possible for someone else to track your online activities over these 
unsecured networks. No matter how much you might be tempted, you might 
want to avoid accessing financial accounts or sending unencrypted sensitive 
email when connected to a public hotspot.
Setting Up iTunes
Think of iTunes as Apple’s version of the Mall of America. It’s both one place 
from which you can manage your iPad settings for syncing content, and a 
great big online store from which you can buy content and apps for your 
Mac or PC, iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad. It’s also the place where you can 
make settings for several of these devices to control how they download and 
share content. Even if you find some other sources of content for your iPad, 
it’s worth having an iTunes account, if only to use the settings it provides.

76
Making Settings and Syncing
Before you can use iTunes to manage your iPad, you have to download the 
latest version of iTunes by going to www.apple.com/itunes. You should 
also create an iTunes account, providing a payment method so that you can 
use iTunes on your computer or use the iTunes app on your iPad to pur­
chase apps and content.
	
You can use an iTunes account, or an Apple ID and iCloud, to register your 
iPad when you first buy it before you can use it. In my case and perhaps in 
yours, the nice man at the Apple Store activated my iPad before I left the 
store with it, so I set up my own iTunes account the first time I wanted to 
buy a hot movie title.
Making Settings and Syncing
Remember that great photo of your promotion party you have on your hard 
drive? How do you get that onto iPad so you can show it off at the next fam­
ily reunion? Or how about that audiobook on career success that you bought 
and downloaded to your laptop on your last business trip? It would sure be 
handy to get that sucker onto your iPad. Never fear: By making a few easy 
settings and syncing with your computer, you can bring all that content over 
in a flash.
	
Remember that you can also sync content using iCloud. See the section 
“Understanding iCloud,” later in this chapter, for more about that option.
Making iPad settings using iTunes
When you plug your Lightning to USB Cable (the Dock Connector to USB 
Cable for third-generation iPads and earlier) into your iPad and computer 
and then open iTunes, a whole group of settings becomes available. These 
help you determine how content will sync between the two devices.
If you’re using a Mac, you already have iTunes installed, but be sure that you 
have the latest version (at the time of this writing it’s version 11.4). Open 
iTunes and choose Check for Updates. For Windows users, you should down­
load the iTunes application to your computer so that you have the option of 
using it to sync (transfer) downloaded content to your iPad.
	
Note that you can sync wirelessly to your computer by tapping Settings on 
the Home screen, tapping General, and tapping iTunes Wi-Fi Sync. In the set­
tings that appear, tap Sync Now. This works only if your computer is con­
nected to the same Wi-Fi network.

	 A series of tabs displays. The tabs offer information about your iPad and 
the settings you can use to specify which content such as music, mov­
ies, or podcasts to download and, for some content types, when to 
download. Figure 5-3 shows the settings on the Movies tab. The settings 
on the various tabs relate to the kind of content you want to download 
and whether you want to download it automatically when you sync or 
do it manually. See Table 5-1 for an overview of the settings that are 
available on each tab.

Understanding iCloud
Figure 5-5: Set up your iPad to sync using the nearest Wi-Fi network.
Understanding iCloud
You have an alternative to syncing content by using iTunes. iCloud is a ser­
vice that allows you to back up all your content and certain settings, such as 
bookmarks, to online storage. (However, note that some content, such as 
videos, aren’t backed up, so consider an occasional backup of content to 
your computer or from your computer to an external storage device such as 
a USB stick, as well).That content and those settings are then pushed auto­
matically to all your Apple devices through a wireless connection.
All you need to do is get an iCloud account, which is free, and then make set­
tings on each device for which types of content you want to have pushed to 
each device. After you’ve done that, any content you create or purchase on 
one device — such as music, apps, books, and TV shows, as well as docu­
ments created in Apple’s iWork apps, photos, and so on — can be synced 
among your devices automatically.
When you get an iCloud account, you get 5GB of free storage. If you want 
additional storage, you can buy an upgrade from one of your devices. In 
round numbers, 20GB is $12 a year; 200GB is $48 a year; 500 GB is $120 a 
year, and 1 terabyte is $240. Most people will do just fine with the free 5GB of 
storage. Note that items you’ve purchased from iTunes, which include any 
music such as ripped CDs that you’ve synced across devices using the 
iTunes Match service, don’t count toward your data storage.

82
Understanding iCloud
To upgrade your storage, go to iCloud in Settings, tap Storage, and then tap 
Buy More Storage. In the settings that appear, tap the amount you need and 
then tap Buy.
	
You can make settings for backing up your content to iCloud in the iCloud 
pane of Settings. You can have content backed up automatically, or you can 
back it up manually. See Chapter 9 in this minibook for more about this topic.
	
If you pay $24.99 a year for the iTunes Match service, you can sync a huge 
amount of audio content (up to 25,000 tracks) in your iTunes library to your 
devices, which may be a less expensive way to go than paying for added 
iCloud storage. Tap Match in iTunes or visit www.apple.com/itunes/
itunes-match for more information.
Getting an iCloud account
Before you can use iCloud, you need an iCloud account, which is tied to the 
Apple ID that you probably already have. You can turn on iCloud when first 
setting up your iPad or use Settings to sign up using your Apple ID. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 When first setting up your iPad (except for an original iPad), tap Use 
iCloud in the sequence of screens that appears (see Figure 5-6).
Figure 5-6: Set up iCloud while setting up your iPad.

2.	 In the next screen, tap Back up to iCloud.
	
	 Your account is now set up based on the Apple ID you entered earlier in 
the setup sequence.
Here are the steps to set up iCloud backup on your iPad :
	
1.	 Open the Settings app, tap iCloud, and then tap Backup.
	
2.	 In the next screen (see Figure 5-7), tap the On/Off switch to turn on 
iCloud Backup.
	
	 To perform a manual backup, tap Back Up Now.
	
	 An alert may appear asking whether you want to allow iCloud to use the 
location of your iPad. Tap OK.
	
	 Your account is now set up.

Making iCloud sync settings
When you have an iCloud account up and running (see the preceding sec­
tion), you have to specify which type of content should be synced with your 
iPad via iCloud. Note that content you purchase and download from the 
iTunes Store is synced among your devices automatically via iCloud. Follow 
these steps to specify the type of content to sync:
	
1.	 Tap Settings and then tap iCloud.

84
Buying Apps or Downloading Apps
	
2.	 In the iCloud settings, as shown in Figure 5-8, tap the On/Off switch 
for any item that’s turned off that you want to turn on (or vice versa).
	
	 You can sync Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Safari, Notes, 
Photos, Passbook, Keychain (an app that stores all your passwords 
across all your Apple devices), Find My iPad, and iCloud Drive.
Figure 5-8: Choose the items you want to have synced over iCloud 
with your iPad here.
	
3.	 To enable automatic downloads of music, apps, and books, scroll 
down and tap iTunes & App Store in Settings.
	
4.	 Tap the On/Off switch for Music, Apps, Books, or Updates to set up 
automatic downloads of any of this content to your iPad via iCloud.
	
If you want to allow iCloud to provide a service for locating a lost or stolen 
iPad, tap the On/Off switch in the Find My iPad field to activate it. This ser­
vice helps you locate, send a message to, or delete content from your iPad if 
it falls into other hands.
Buying Apps or Downloading Apps
Apps provide all kinds of functionality, from the ability to plan travel, man­
age finances, and find local restaurants and gas stations to hard-core busi­
ness productivity and serious gaming fun. By buying and downloading apps, 
you can assemble a custom computing experience.

Most iPhone apps will work on your iPad, so if you own the trendy mobile 
phone and have favorite apps on it, you might want to use them on your 
iPad! Also, for more about my recommended apps, go to www.dummies.
com/extras/ipadaio.
Searching the App Store
Apple isn’t one to miss a profit opportunity, so naturally, one of the iPad 
built-in apps is the App Store. This is the apps portal that will get you to 
thousands of great apps for everything from games to bean counting.
	
If you want to get apps that aren’t available in the App Store, you can join 
the estimated 4 million people who have done what’s called jailbreaking to 
liberate their iPhones or iPads from the tyranny of getting apps solely 
through iTunes. Be forewarned that jailbreaking voids your iPad warranty, 
impedes your access to Apple updates, opens you up to the dangers of mal­
ware, and could even make it hard to download and use legitimate Apple-
approved apps. A handful of jailbreaking tools cut down on the installation 
of malware, such as https://cydia.saurik.com/upgrading/. But 
again, for the average iPad user, I recommend avoiding jailbreaking.
Here’s your quick introduction to using the App Store to obtain whatever 
apps your heart desires:
	
1.	 Tap the App Store icon on your iPad Home screen.
	
	 The site shown in Figure 5-9 appears.
Figure 5-9: Viewing your purchased apps.

2.	 At this point, you have several options for finding apps:
	
•	 Tap in the Search field, enter a search term, and tap the Search but­
ton on the onscreen keyboard to see results.
	
•	 Tap and swipe the screen to scroll down to see more selections.
	
•	 Tap the Categories button at the top of the screen to see different cat­
egories of apps.
	
•	 Tap the Top Charts button at the bottom of the screen to see which 
free and paid apps other people are downloading most.
	
•	 Tap the Explore option to display apps in categories such as Great Free 
Games, Get Stuff Done, and Interactive Kids Stories. Tap a category to 
display apps that fit within it.
	
•	 Tap the Popular Near Me button at the top of the Explore view to dis­
play apps that are popular among people in or near your location. 
(This may or may not produce useful results, depending on where 
you are.)
	
•	 Tap the Purchased button to view apps you’ve already purchased, as 
shown in Figure 5-10. An item with a cloud symbol to the right of it 
means that you need to download it to use it.
	
•	 Tap the See All button in any category shown in the Featured view to 
view all the items in that category.
	
•	 In the Top Charts view, use the Paid, Free, and Top Grossing tabs to 
narrow down your search.

Getting apps from the App Store
Getting free apps or buying apps requires that you have an iTunes account, 
which I cover earlier in this chapter. After you have an account, you can use 
the saved payment information there to buy apps or download free apps. 
Follow these steps to get an app from the App Store:
	
1.	 With the App Store open, tap the Search field, enter an app name (a free 
app that you might like to have is Netflix, for example, so I use that for 
these steps), and then tap the Search button on the onscreen keyboard.
	
2.	 Tap Netflix in the suggested search results that appear, as shown in 
Figure 5-11.
Figure 5-11: Tap the app you need.
	
3.	 In the app details, tap the price button (which in this case reads Free) 
for Netflix.
	
	 Note that to get a paid app, you’d tap the price button, which displays 
the cost of the app.
	
	 The price button changes to read Install App (or in the case of a paid 
app, the button changes to read Buy App).
	
4.	 Tap the Free (or price) button and then tap Install.
	
	 You may be asked to enter your iTunes password and tap the OK button 
to proceed. Note that an app with a cloud icon indicates one that you have 
already purchased but is not installed on your iPad; you can download it 
at no charge.

88
Buying Apps or Downloading Apps
	
	 The app downloads and appears on a Home screen (probably your second 
Home screen if you haven’t yet downloaded many apps). If you purchase an 
app that isn’t free, at this point, your credit card is charged for the purchase 
price or your Store credit is reduced by the amount of the purchase price.
	
Only preinstalled apps are located on the first iPad Home screen of your 
iPad by default, plus a few more such as Podcasts and iBooks on the second 
Home screen. Apps you download are placed on additional Home screens, 
and you have to scroll to view and use them. See the next section for help in 
finding your newly downloaded apps using multiple Home screens.
If you’ve opened an iCloud account, any iOS app that you purchase on your 
iPad can be set up to automatically be pushed to other Apple iOS devices. 
See earlier sections in this chapter for more about iCloud.
	
If you’re a road warrior, you’ll be glad to hear that the travel industry is all over 
apps to help you get around because the iPad is such a logical travel compan­
ion. Lonely Planet has released country guides for the iPad, and iPhone apps for 
travelers are being re-created for iPad. See Book III, Chapter 3 if you’re someone 
who hits the road on a regular basis and wants to make the most of your iPad.
Organizing your apps
iPad can display up to 15 Home screens. By default, the first and part of the 
second contain preinstalled apps; other screens are created to contain any 
apps you download or sync to your iPad. At the bottom of any iPad Home 
screen (just above the Dock), dots indicate the number of Home screens, as 
shown in Figure 5-12.

You can use some very nice features in iTunes to organize apps on your con­
nected iPad, but you can also organize things right on the iPad using a few 
different methods.
Here’s some advice on how to organize your apps:
	
1.	 Tap the Home button to open the last displayed Home screen.
	
2.	 Flick your finger from right to left or tap either end of the Home 
screen dots to move to the next or previous Home screen.
	
	 Note that the dots near the bottom of the screen indicate which Home 
screen you’re on. To move back, flick from left to right.
	
3.	 To reorganize apps on a Home screen, press and hold any app on 
that page.
	
	 The app icons begin to jiggle, and any apps you installed will sport a 
Delete button (a gray circle with a black X on it (see Figure 5-13).

5.	 Tap the Home button to stop all those icons from jiggling!
To move an app from one page to another, while things are jiggling, you can 
press, hold, and drag an app to the left or right to move it to the next Home 
screen. You can also manage what app resides on what Home screen and in 
which folder from iTunes when you’ve connected iPad to iTunes via a cable 
or wireless sync, which may be easier for some.

Buying Apps or Downloading Apps
	
You can also manage your apps from iTunes with your iPad connected using 
the settings on the Apps tab for that iPad. You can even reorder the Home 
screens there.
	
Press the Home button twice and you get a preview of open apps in the App 
Switcher. With iOS 8, you also get a row of recently used contacts with photos 
if the contact contains one. When you tap a contact, you then get options to 
call, message, or FaceTime call that person. Scroll among the apps and tap 
the one you want to go to. The App Switcher also allows you to swipe to 
move an app upward, out of this preview list, and stop it from running.
Organizing apps in folders
iPad lets you organize apps in folders so that you can find apps more easily. 
When you’ve populated a folder, you can flick it to open the folder and see 
all the apps in it. The process is simple. For iPad, follow these steps to get 
more organized:
	
1.	 Tap and hold an app till all apps do their jiggle dance.
	
2.	 Drag one app on top of another app.
	
	 The two apps appear in a box with a placeholder name in a strip above 
them. (See Figure 5-14.)

3.	 To delete the placeholder name and change the folder name, tap in 
the field above the box.
	
	 The placeholder text is deleted, and the keyboard appears.
	
4.	 Tap the Delete key to delete the placeholder name and then type one 
of your own.
	
	 If you change your mind and want to put the app back on the Home 
screen, you can easily drag it out of the folder.
	
5.	 Tap anywhere outside the bar to save the name.
	
6.	 Tap the Home button to stop all that jiggling!
	
	 The folder appears on the Home screen where you began this process.
To get to the items stored in your folder, just double-tap it.
Deleting apps you no longer need
Not all apps are endlessly entertaining or useful. When you no longer need 
an app you have installed, it’s time to get rid of it to save some space on 
your iPad. (Note, however, that you can’t delete apps that were preinstalled 
on the iPad such as Notes, Calendar, or Photos.) If you use iCloud to push 
content across all Apple iOS devices, note that deleting an app on your iPad 
won’t affect that app on other devices.
To send an app on its way, do this:
	
1.	 Display the Home screen that contains the app you want to delete.
	
2.	 Press and hold the app until all apps begin to jiggle.
	
3.	 Tap the Delete button for the app you want to delete.
	
4.	 In the confirmation dialog, as shown in Figure 5-15, tap Delete to pro­
ceed with the deletion.
	
5.	 Tap the Rate button to rate the app or No Thanks to opt out of the 
survey.
	
	 If you have several apps to delete, you can delete them by using iTunes 
when your iPad is connected to your computer, making the process a bit 
more streamlined.
	
	 Don’t worry about wiping out several apps at one time by deleting a 
folder. You can’t delete full folders, only individual apps within them.

Figure 5-15: Tap Cancel if you have regrets; otherwise, tap Delete to 
send the app on its way.
Updating apps
App developers update their apps all the time to fix problems or add new 
features, so you might want to check for those updates. The App Store icon 
on the Home screen displays the number of available updates in a red circle. 
Tap the App Store icon when you have some apps with updates ready.
Now you can proceed with these steps to update your apps:
	
1.	 Tap the Updates button to access the Updates screen (see Figure 5-16) 
and then tap any item you want to update.
	
	 To update all, tap the Update All button. Note that if you have Family 
Sharing turned on, there will be a folder titled Family Purchases that you 
can tap to display apps that are shared across your family’s devices. To 
update all of those, tap each one’s Update All button.
	
2.	 If you choose the Updates button in Step 1, in the app screen that 
appears, tap Update.
	
	 You may be asked to confirm that you want to update, or to enter your 
Apple ID password and then tap OK to proceed. You may also be asked 
to confirm that you are over a certain age or agree to terms and condi­
tions; if so, scroll down the Terms form (reading all items as you go, of 
course) and at the bottom, tap Agree.

You can download multiple apps at one time. If you choose more than one 
app to update instead of downloading them sequentially, all items are down­
loaded simultaneously. You can keep working in the App Store after you’ve 
initiated a download.
	
If you have an iCloud account and update an app on your iPad, it’s also 
updated on any other Apple iOS devices automatically via an Internet con­
nection. Apps updated on your other devices are also updated on your iPad 
if you enable automatic updates on the iPad, as explained earlier in this 
chapter.

etting on the Internet with your iPad is easy using its Wi-Fi or 3G/4G 
capabilities. After you’re online, the preinstalled browser, Safari, can 
take you all around the web. Safari will be familiar to you if you’ve used an 
Apple device before or the browser on your Mac or PC. On iPad, 
you’re actually using a hybrid of the mobile version of Safari, 
also used on iPhone and iPod touch, and the desktop Safari.
If you’ve never used Safari, this chapter helps you get 
up to speed quickly. In this chapter, you discover 
how to open Safari and navigate among web pages 
using tabbed browsing, as well as how to use iCloud 
tabs to share your browsing history among devices. 
Along the way, you learn about All Tabs view, a ver­
sion of which has been available in iPhone and now 
comes to the iPad. All Tabs view lets you view all 
your open web pages as thumbnails.
You see how to place a bookmark for a favorite site or web 
clip on your Home screen. You can also view your browsing 
history, save online images to your Photo Library, post photos 
to sites from within Safari, and email a hotlink to a friend. Two useful Safari fea­
tures are Shared Links to see URLs posted to your Twitter timeline and iCloud 
Keychain, used for storing passwords and credit card information in one 
handy, safe place online. You explore the Safari Reader and Safari Reading List 
features, including the ability to save links and web pages to Reading List, and 
find out how to keep yourself safer while online using private browsing. I also 
show you the simple steps involved in printing what you find online.

Exploring Safari
Exploring Safari
If you need to know how to connect to the Internet, see Chapter 5 in this 
minibook. After you’re connected, you’re ready to browse with Safari.
If you’ve used Safari before, you’ll notice a major difference in how it works 
on your iPad. It offers all the typical browser tools, but an important iPad 
feature is the use of gestures on the touchscreen to manipulate pages and 
navigate the web.
	
Though Safari is a fine browser, you aren’t limited to it. You can download 
other browsers to iPad, such as Google Chrome, Atomic Web Browser, and 
Safe. Check out the App Store for the latest available browsers.
Try the following steps to practice using Safari:
	
1.	 After you’re connected to a network, tap the Safari icon on the Home 
screen.
	
	 Safari opens, probably displaying the Apple Home page the first time 
you go online. (See Figure 6-1.)
Figure 6-1: These tools will be familiar to you from almost any browser 
you may have used.

2.	 Put two fingers together on the screen and swipe outward to enlarge 
the view, as shown in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-2: Enlarge the screen so that you can read the 
fine print.
	
3.	 Double-tap the screen with a single finger to restore the default 
screen size.
	
	 Using the pinch method (see Chapter 2 in this minibook) allows you to 
enlarge or reduce the screen to various sizes, giving you more flexibility 
and control than the double-tap method.
	
4.	 Put your finger on the screen and flick upward to scroll down the page.
	
5.	 To return to the top of the web page, put your finger on the screen 
and drag downward, or tap the status bar at the top of the screen.
	
When you enlarge the display, you gain more control using two fingers to 
drag from left to right or from top to bottom on the screen. On a reduced dis­
play, one finger works fine for making these gestures.
Navigating among web pages
I expect that you have entered URLs and used the Forward and Back buttons 
in a browser to navigate around the web. However, the iPad’s onscreen key­
board differs slightly from a standard keyboard, and it might help you to run 
through how you navigate with the mobile version of Safari.
Follow these steps for a bit of navigating practice:
	
1.	 With Safari open, tap in the Address/Search field.
	
	 The onscreen keyboard appears, as shown in Figure 6-3.

98
Exploring Safari
Figure 6-3: This keyboard requires you to do a few unique things to use 
numbers and symbols.
	
2.	 To clear the field, press the Delete key on the keyboard. Enter a web 
address, using the .com key to make entry faster.
	
	 Hold down the .com key to access options like .edu, .gov, and .net. If 
you have no website in mind, go to this book’s companion site, www.
ipadmadeclear.com.
	
3.	 Tap the Go key on the keyboard (refer to Figure 6-3).
	
	 The website appears.
	
	
•	 If, for some reason, a page doesn’t display, tap the Reload icon at the 
end of the Address/Search field.
	
	
•	 If Safari is loading a web page and you change your mind about view­
ing the page, you can tap the Cancel icon (the X) that appears at the 
end of the Address/Search field during this process to stop loading 
the page.
	
	 4.	 Tap the Back button to go to the last page Safari displayed.
	
	 5.	 Tap the Forward button to go forward to the page you came from 
when you tapped Previous.
	
6.	 To follow a link to another web page, tap the link with your finger.
	
	 To view the destination web address of the link before you tap it, just 
touch and hold the link, and a menu appears that displays the address 
at the top, as shown in Figure 6-4.

Using tabbed browsing
Safari includes a feature called tabbed browsing, which allows you to have 
several web pages open at one time on separate tabs so that you can move 
easily among those sites. You may have used tabbed browsing in other popu­
lar browsers, such as the desktop version of Safari, Internet Explorer, Google 
Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox. This is a handy feature of Safari that’s worth 
exploring.
To add a tab, follow these steps:
	
1.	 With Safari open, tap the Add button (shaped like a + symbol) near 
the upper-right corner of the screen (refer to Figure 6-1).
	
	 A new tab opens with a list of your saved Favorites (see how to save 
Favorites later in this chapter), the Address/Search field becomes active, 
and the onscreen keyboard appears (see Figure 6-5).

100
Exploring Safari
Figure 6-5: Here’s where you can enter the address for the new tab 
you created.
	
2.	 To add a new page (meaning that you’re opening a new website), tap 
one of the Favorites or frequently used sites displayed (refer to 
Figure 6-5) or tap in the address bar that appears, enter a website 
address, and then tap the Go key.
	
	 Note that you can get to the same new page by simply tapping in the 
address bar from any site.
	
	 The site opens.
	
3.	 Switch among open sites by tapping another tab, or tap the Show All 
Tabs button to see all open web pages.
	
	 If you tap Show All Tabs, you can then tap a page to go to it or tap Done 
to close the All Tabs view.
	
4.	 To close a tab, scroll to locate the tab and then tap the Close button in 
the upper-left corner of the tab.
	
Using tabbed browsing, you can not only place a site on a tab but also place 
a search results screen on a tab. If you recently searched for something, 
those search results will be on your Recent Searches list. Also, if you’re dis­
playing a search results page when you tap the plus (+) button to add a tab, 
the first ten suggested sites in the results will be listed there for you to 
choose from.

Viewing browsing history
As you know, when you move around the web, your browser keeps a record 
of your browsing history. This record can be handy when you visit a site that 
you want to view again but whose address you’ve forgotten. (We’ve all done 
it.) On your iPad, you use the Bookmarks popover to get to your history.
Follow these steps to browse your browsing history:
	
	 1.	 With Safari open, tap Bookmarks.
	
2.	 In the popover that appears, as shown in Figure 6-6, tap the 
Bookmarks tab.
	
	 Alternatively, tap and hold the Back button in Safari to quickly display a 
list of your browsing history.
Figure 6-6: In addition to bookmarks, this menu is your gateway to your 
browsing history.
	
3.	 In the Bookmarks list that appears (see Figure 6-7), tap a site to navi­
gate to it.
	
To clear the history, tap the Clear button in the bottom-right corner (see 
Figure 6-7). This button is useful when you don’t want your spouse or chil­
dren to see where you’ve been browsing for birthday or holiday presents!

Searching the web
If you don’t know the address of the site you want to visit (or you want to do 
research on a topic or find information you need online), get acquainted with 
Safari’s Search feature on the iPad. By default, Safari uses the Google search 
engine.
	
You can use Spotlight Search on your iPad to search the web without having 
opened Safari first. Also, with Siri, you simply speak a request, such as 
“Search the web for information on dogs.” You can also use the On this Page 
results to go to a match on the currently displayed page.
	
1.	 With Safari open, tap in the Search/Address field. (See Figure 6-8.)
	
	 The onscreen keyboard appears.
	
2.	 Tap one of the suggested sites that appears in a list or enter a search 
word or phrase.
	
	 What you enter can be a topic or a web address.
	
3.	 In the search results that are displayed, tap a link to visit that site.
	
You can change your default search engine from Google to Bing, 
DuckDuckGo, or Yahoo!. In Settings, tap Safari and then tap Search Engine. 
Tap Yahoo!, DuckDuckGo, or Bing, and your default search engine is set.
	
You can browse for specific items such as images, videos, or news by tap­
ping the corresponding link at the top of the Google results screen. Also, tap 
the More button in this list to see additional options to narrow your results, 
such as searching for books or shopping sources related to the subject.

Adding and Using Bookmarks
Bookmarks, which you have probably used in other browsers, are a way to 
save sites that you visit often so that you can easily go to them again. Follow 
these steps to add bookmarks:
	
	
1.	 With a site displayed that you want to bookmark, tap the Share button.
	
2.	 On the popover that appears (see Figure 6-9), tap Add Bookmark.
	
3.	 In the Add Bookmark dialog, as shown in Figure 6-10, edit the name of 
the bookmark (if you want) by tapping the name of the site and using 
the onscreen keyboard to edit that name.
	
4.	 Tap Location and choose whether to save this page to Favorites or 
Bookmarks.
	
	 Favorites is the default option, which displays this site in the Favorites 
list in the search suggestions.
	
5.	 Tap the Save button.
	
	 6.	 To go to the bookmark, tap Bookmarks and then tap the History tab.
	
7.	 On the History list that appears (see Figure 6-11), tap the bookmarked 
site you want to visit.
	
	 If you want to save a web location to your desktop, read “Adding Web

Using Safari Reading List
Remember when you were in school and had lots of reading assignments to 
keep track of from all your classes? Well, after graduation, reading lists don’t 
go away; whether you’re staying up-to-date in your chosen field or just keep­
ing up with the latest articles and information, being able to assemble a list 
of online reading can be a great help. The Safari Reading List provides a way 
to save content that you want to read at a later time so that you can easily 
visit it again.
You can save not only links to site pages but also the pages themselves, 
which allows you to read the content even when you’re offline.
	
	 To use Reading List, follow these steps:
	
1.	 With a site displayed that you want to add to your Reading List, tap 
the Share button.
	
2.	 On the menu that appears, tap Add to Reading List.
	
	 The site is added to your list.
	
	 3.	 To view your Reading List, tap Bookmarks and then go to the Reading 
tab (the eyglasses icon).
	
4.	 In the Reading List that appears (see Figure 6-12), tap the content you 
want to revisit and resume reading.

106
Reading with Safari Reader
Figure 6-12: It’s so easy to find where you left off reading with Safari’s 
Reading List.
	
If you want to see both the Reading List material you’ve read and the 
material you haven’t read, tap Show All near the bottom of the Reading 
List tab. To see just the material you haven’t read, use the Show Unread 
button (refer to Figure 6-12). Be aware, however, that with websites that 
change content frequently, the content you placed on your Reading List 
may not be available at a later date.
	
To save an image on a web page to your Reading List, tap and hold the image 
until a menu appears, and then tap Add to Reading List (this is available only 
for some images).
To delete an item, with the Reading List displayed, swipe left or right, and 
the Delete button appears. Tap this button to delete the item from the 
Reading List.
Reading with Safari Reader
Reading content on the web isn’t always user friendly. The ads, sidebars, and 
various distractions can take away from your reading experience. Happily, 
the Safari Reader feature gives you an e-reader type of experience right 
within your browser, removing other stories and links as well as those dis­
tracting advertisements. Not all websites support the Reader view.
	
1.	 Tap the Reader button (see Figure 6-13) on the left side of the Search/
Address field when you’re on a site where you’re reading content 
such as an article that supports the Reader feature.

3.	 When you finish reading the material, just tap the Reader button in 
the Search/Address field again to go back to the material’s source.
	
If you’re holding the iPad in landscape orientation, the Reader window 
doesn’t fill the screen, and you can tap either side of the Reader window to 
go back to the source material.
	
If a video is contained in an article that you’re perusing in Reader, it still 
appears with the standard Play button. Tap the button, and the video plays 
right within Reader.
	
When in a Reader screen, tap the small or large letter A at the top of the 
screen to adjust the font size for the article.
Adding Web Clips to the Home Screen
The Web Clips feature allows you to save a website as an icon on your Home 
screen so that you can go to the site at any time with one tap. You can then 
reorganize those icons just as you can reorganize apps icons. (See Chapter 2 
in this minibook for information on organizing apps on Home screens.)
Here are the steps for adding web clips:
	
	 1.	 With Safari open and displaying the site you want to add, tap the 
Share button.
	
2.	 On the popover that appears (refer to Figure 6-9), tap Add to Home 
Screen.
	
3.	 In the Add to Home dialog that appears (see Figure 6-15), you can edit 
the name of the site to be more descriptive (if you like) by tapping the 
name of the site and using the onscreen keyboard to edit its name.
	
4.	 Tap the Add button.
	
	 The shortcut to the site is added to your Home screen.
	
You can have up to 15 Home screens on your iPad to accommodate the web 
clips and apps you download. You can also use folders to organize your web 
clips and save space on your Home screens. If you want to delete an item 
from your Home screen for any reason, press and hold any app on the 
Home screen until all items on the screen start to jiggle and Delete buttons 
appear on all items except preinstalled apps. Tap the Delete button on the 
item you want to delete, and it’s gone. (To get rid of the jiggle, press the 
Home button.)

Saving an Image to Your Photo Library
Have you found a photo that you like online? Maybe your BF’s Facebook 
image or a picture of your upcoming vacation spot? You can easily save 
images you find online that are not protected from copying to the iPad 
Photos app library. Here’s how:
	
1.	 Display a web page that contains an image you want to copy.
	
2.	 Press and hold the image.
	
	 The menu in Figure 6-16 appears unless the website protects images 
from being copied.
	
3.	 Tap the Save Image option (see Figure 6-16).
	
	 The image is saved to the Photo Library in the Photos app.
	
Be careful about copying images from the Internet and using them for 
business or promotional activities. Most images are copyrighted, and you 
may be violating that copyright if you use an image in (say) a brochure for 
your association or a flyer for your community group. Note that some 
search engines offer the option of browsing only for images that aren’t 
copyrighted.

If you find a great site that you want to share, you can do so easily by sending 
a link in an email; just follow these steps:
	
	 1.	 With Safari open and the site you want to share displayed, tap the 
Share button.
	
2.	 On the popover that appears (refer to Figure 6-9), tap Mail.
	
3.	 In the message form that appears, which contains the link (see 
Figure 6-19), enter a recipient’s email address, a subject, and your 
message.
	
4.	 Tap Send.
	
	 The email goes on its way.
The email is sent from the default email account that you’ve set up on your iPad. 
For more about setting up an email account, see Chapter 7 in this minibook.

Making Private Browsing and Cookie Settings
Figure 6-19: Use this simple email form to send an image 
and message.
	
When entering a user name or password in any online form, such as an email 
message or Search field, you can take advantage of Safari’s AutoFill feature. 
Turn this on by going to Settings and tapping Safari. Safari can then use informa­
tion from iPad’s Contacts app as well as remember names and passwords that 
you’ve entered before to offer options for completing text entries as you type.
	
To tweet the link using your Twitter account, in Step 2 of the preceding 
steps, choose Tweet, enter your tweet message in the form that appears, and 
then tap Send. For more about using Twitter with the iPad, see Book II, 
Chapter 5. If you have a fourth-generation or newer iPad, you can also 
choose AirDrop in the same menu to share with someone in your immediate 
vicinity who has an AirDrop-enabled device.
A four-finger swipe from right to left on your screen gets you back to Safari 
from either Mail or Twitter.
Making Private Browsing and Cookie Settings
Apple has provided some privacy settings for Safari that you should con­
sider using. Private Browsing automatically removes items from the down­
load list, stops Safari from using AutoFill to save information used to 
complete your entries in the Address/Search field as you type, and erases 
some browsing history information. These features can keep your online 
activities more private. The Accept Cookies setting allows you to stop the 
downloading of cookies (small files that document your browsing history so 
that you can be recognized by a site the next time you go to or move within 
that site) to your iPad.
You can control both settings by choosing Safari in Settings. Tap to turn the 
Do Not Track feature on or off (see Figure 6-20). Tap the arrow next to Block 
Cookies and choose to never save cookies, always save cookies, or save 
cookies only from the current website or visited third-party and advertiser 
sites (the default setting).

Printing from Safari
If you have a wireless printer that supports the Apple AirPrint technology 
(most major manufacturers such as HP, Epson, Lexmark, Canon, and Brother 
offer at least one AirPrint model at this point), you can print web content 
using a wireless connection. Here’s how:
	
	 1.	 With Safari open and the site you want to print displayed, tap the 
Share button.
	
2.	 On the popover that appears, scroll to the right on the bottom list of 
buttons and then tap Print.
	
3.	 In the Printer Options dialog that appears (see Figure 6-21), tap Select 
Printer.
	
4.	 In the list of printers that appears, tap the name of your wireless printer.
	
5.	 If you need more than one copy, tap either the plus or minus button in 
the Copy field to adjust the number of copies to print.
	
	 The default is set to print one copy, so you can skip this step if you don’t 
need more. If you have a printer capable of two-sided printing you can 
tap the Double-Sided switch.
	
6.	 Tap Print to print the displayed page.

Figure 6-21: Print directly from your iPad if you 
have a compatible wireless printer.
	
The Mac applications Printopia and HandyPrint make any shared or network 
printer on your home network visible to your iPad. Printopia has more fea­
tures but will cost you, whereas HandyPrint is free. A still better option is an 
xPrintServer because it can use AirPrint to print to all printers on your net­
work and lets you attach a USB printer.
	
If you don’t have an AirPrint–compatible wireless printer or don’t wish to 
use an app to help you print wirelessly, just email a link to the web page to 
yourself, open the link on your computer, and print from there.
Understanding iCloud Tabs
iCloud Tabs were new with iOS 6.0. What this feature allows you to do is to 
access all browsing history among your different devices from any device. If 
you begin to research a project on your iPad before you leave home, for 
instance, you can then pick up where you left off as you sit in a waiting room 
with your iPhone.

✓	Setting up a VIP list
W

hat use would an iPad be if you couldn’t stay in touch with your 
friends online? You can access an existing email account using the 
handy Mail app supplied with your iPad, or you can sign into your email 
account using the Safari browser. Using Mail involves adding one or more exist­
ing email accounts using iPad Settings. Then you can use Mail to write, format, 
retrieve, and forward messages from any email accounts you added to iPad.
Mail offers the capability to mark the messages you’ve read, delete 
messages, and organize your messages in folders, as well as use 
a handy Search feature. You can create a VIP list so that you 
are notified when that special person sends you an email.
A few new features for Mail arrived with iOS 8, 
including a feature that makes jumping between a 
draft email and other messages in your Inbox possi­
ble, as well as the ability to quickly swipe to mark 
an email as read or flag it for future action.
In this chapter, you find out about Mail and its vari­
ous features.
	
If you’re wondering about IM (instant messaging) and iPad, 
check out Book II, Chapter 5 to discover the IM app, Messages.
Adding an Account
To use the Mail app to access email on iPad, you first have to make settings 
for an existing email account on your iPad. You can add one or more email 
accounts using iPad Settings, including any email account that you’ve 

118
Adding an Account
associated with an iCloud account. If you set up multiple accounts, you can 
then switch between accounts by tapping an account name in the upper-left 
corner of the displayed inbox and then tapping Accounts and choosing 
which account to display. Or you can use the consolidated inbox and check 
your mail from all active accounts on one page.
If you have an iCloud, Microsoft Exchange (mostly used for business 
accounts), Gmail, Yahoo!, Outlook (this includes Microsoft accounts from 
Live, Hotmail, and so on), or AOL account, iPad pretty much automates the 
setup. Here are the steps to get you going with any of these email providers:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
2.	 In Settings, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
	
	 The settings shown in Figure 7-1 appear.
Figure 7-1: Mail settings allow you to set up multiple email accounts.
	
3.	 Tap Add Account.
	
	 The options shown in Figure 7-2 appear.
	
4.	 Tap iCloud, Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo!, AOL, or Outlook.com and then 
enter your account information in the form that appears (a descrip­
tion is optional). (See Figure 7-3.)
	
5.	 Tap Next.
	
6.	 After iPad takes a moment to verify your account information, tap any 
On/Off switch to have Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Notes, and/or 
Reminders services for that account synced with iPad.

Adding an Account
	
	 iCloud and Exchange support syncing all five services. Google supports 
all but Reminders. Other email account support is usually limited to 
Mail or to Mail and Notes.
Figure 7-2: Choosing built-in email providers is a quick way to 
get set up, if you have an account with one.
Figure 7-3: Enter your name, email address, and password, and the 
iPad finds your settings for you.

Setting Up a POP3 Email Account
	
7.	 When you’re done, tap Save.
	
	 The account is saved, and you can now open it using Mail.
Setting Up a POP3 Email Account
You can also set up most email accounts, such as those available through 
EarthLink or a cable provider, by obtaining the host name from the provider. 
To set up an existing account with a provider other than Gmail, Yahoo!, 
Outlook.com, or AOL, you have to enter the account settings yourself.
Follow these steps to set up an IMAP or POP3 account:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
2.	 In Settings, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then tap Add Account.
	
3.	 In the settings that appear (refer to Figure 7-2), tap Other.
	
4.	 In the screen that appears (see Figure 7-4), tap Add Mail Account.
Figure 7-4: Proceed by choosing to add an email account in these settings.
	
5.	 In the next form, enter your name and the account address, password, 
and description, and tap Next.
	
	 The iPad takes a moment to verify your account and then returns you to 
the Mail, Contacts, Calendars pane with your new account displayed.

Working with Email 
in Mail
Opening Mail and Reading Messages
	
	 Your iPad will probably add the outgoing mail server information for 
you, but if it doesn’t, tap SMTP and enter this information.
	
6.	 Tap Done.
	
	 You can now access the account through the Mail app.
	
You can have more than one active account set to On for receiving email; tap 
the account name in Settings. When you do, you can then open different 
accounts to view their inboxes from within the Mail app. If you don’t want a 
particular account’s emails to be downloaded, you can turn off any active 
email account by opening it in Settings and tapping the On/Off switch.
	
If you turn on Calendars in the Mail account settings, any information you’ve 
put into your calendar in that email account is brought over into the Calendar 
app on your iPad and reflected in the Notification Center (discussed in more 
detail in Book V, Chapter 4).
Opening Mail and Reading Messages
The whole point of email is to send and receive messages. Mail offers a pretty 
simple interface for reading your email. It displays an open message and a 
pane that you can use to show inbox contents or change to a different folder. 
In landscape orientation, the Mailboxes/Inbox pane is always displayed, but 
in portrait orientation, you display it by tapping the Inbox button.
When you tap the Mail app to open it, it automatically heads out and checks 
for any new email. (If you use Microsoft Exchange or iCloud, you can turn on 
push settings to have your email host initiate a check for new messages to 
download them to your iPad.)
Here are some common actions in Mail:
	
✓	To follow a link in a message, simply tap it. Note that tapping web links 
opens them in Safari, and tapping address links opens the Maps app with a 
map to that address displayed. You can also tap phone number links to call 
that person, or tap flight code links to check on a flight’s status in Safari.
	
✓	To open an attachment, tap it, and Mail presents you with a menu to 
select the one you want to use to open it.
	
✓	To open a meeting invitation, tap the meeting icon (what it looks like 
depends on the originating application; for example, Outlook.com uses a 
little calendar symbol).
iPad supports many common file types — including those that run on multi­
ple platforms, such as PDF and text; those available on Macs, including 
iWork Pages and Numbers; those familiar to Windows users (though also 
available in Mac versions), including Microsoft Word and Excel; as well as 
most common graphics and audio file formats.

122
Opening Mail and Reading Messages
	
When your iPad gets an email, it alerts you with a little sound. If those email–
received alerts are driving you nuts, you can go to Settings and, under 
Sounds, use the slider to lower the volume or tap the On/Off switch to turn 
off the chimes.
The following steps take you through the simple process of using Mail to 
open and read emails if you have a single email account set up on iPad:
	
1.	 Tap the Mail app on the Home screen (see Figure 7-5), which displays 
the number of unread emails in your Inbox in a red circle.
	
	 If you have only one email account set up on your iPad, a list of mes­
sages displays (see Figure 7-6); skip to Step 3.
Figure 7-5: Without having to open Mail, you can see how many unread 
messages you have.
Figure 7-6: Open your inbox and view its contents.
	
2.	 If the list doesn’t display, tap the arrow with the name of the currently 
opened mailbox in the top-left corner (refer to Figure 7-6) to display a 
list of Inboxes. Tap the Inbox whose contents you want to display.

123
Book I 
Chapter 7
Working with Email

Opening Mail and Reading Messages
	
3.	 Tap a message to read it.
	
	 The message opens, as shown in Figure 7-7.
	
Use gestures such as double-tapping and pinching to reduce or enlarge email.
Figure 7-7: Open your email and read it.
	
4.	 If you need to scroll to see the entire message, place your finger on 
the screen and flick upward to scroll down.
	
	 You can swipe right while reading a message in portrait orientation to 
open the Inbox list of messages, and then swipe left to hide the list.
	
You can tap the Next or Previous button (top-left corner of the message in 
Portrait orientation) to move to the next or previous message.
	
If you have multiple email accounts set up, you can choose which inbox to 
display. From the inbox that appears when you open Mail, tap the Back but­
ton to view the list of your mailboxes (see Figure 7-8).
With several accounts set up, in addition to each account listed on the 
Mailboxes screen, an All Inboxes item is listed. Tapping this takes you to a 
consolidated Inbox containing all messages from all accounts in one place.
	
Email messages that you haven’t read are marked with a blue circle in your 
inbox. After you read a message, the blue circle disappears. If you like, you 
can mark a read message as unread. This can help remind you to read it 
again later. With your messages displayed, swipe to the right on a message 
and then tap Mark as Unread.

124
Opening Mail and Reading Messages
Figure 7-8: Mailboxes for various accounts and 
the consolidated Inbox are listed here.
	
To escape your email now and then if you have a 3G or 4G model iPad, you 
can stop retrieval of data including email by tapping Settings and then tap­
ping Cellular and setting the Cellular Data switch to Off. Now you’ll get data 
on your device only if you’re logged into a Wi-Fi network.
Replying to or forwarding email
Replying to or forwarding emails is pretty darn easy with iPad as well. In fact, 
there’s a handy button for replying or forwarding. There’s also a Print com­
mand on this menu to make printing your emails to a compatible printer easy.
	
You can attach a photo or video to new email messages when you create 
them by pressing in the message body and then tapping Insert Photo or 
Video. You can also use features in apps such as Photos, Contacts, Notes, 
iWork Pages, and Maps to share individual documents via email.
Here’s how to use the simple Reply/Forward functions in iPad:
	
1.	 With an email open (see the preceding section), tap the Reply button, 
as shown in Figure 7-9.
	
	 If you are the only recipient, there will be no Reply All option; if available, 
this option allows you to reply to the sender and all other recipients.

2.	 Do one of the following:
	
•	 Tap Reply to respond to the message sender. The reply message form 
shown in Figure 7-10 appears. Tap in the message body and jot down 
your inspired thoughts.
Figure 7-10: What you reply is up to you!
	
•	 Tap Reply All to respond to the sender and all other recipients. A mes­
sage form appears with all those folks included in the To field. You 
can now add your response for all to see.
	
•	 Tap Forward to send the message to somebody else. If the email has an 
attachment, you can choose Include or Don’t Include in the dialog 
that appears. The form in Figure 7-11 then appears. Enter a recipient 
in the To field; then tap in the message body and enter a message.
	
To find out how to print an email, see “Printing Emails,” later in this chapter.
	
3.	 Tap Send.
	
	 The message is sent.

Figure 7-11: When you forward a message, all previous contents are 
included.
	
If you want to move an address from the To field to the Cc/Bcc field or vice 
versa, tap and hold the address and drag it to the other field.
	
Although you can choose whether to keep original attachments when for­
warding an email, any attachments to the original email can’t be included in 
a reply.
Creating and sending a new message
You’re probably an old pro at creating and sending email messages, but it’s 
worth a quick trip through the iPad’s Mail feature and its approach to writing 
an email using the onscreen keyboard.
	
Note that, by default, your emails have a signature that says, “Sent from my 
iPad.” This will definitely impress your geekiest friends, but if you want to 
change it to something a little more useful, just go to Settings. In the Mail 
section of the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings, choose Signature. You can 
then enter any signature text you want. If you have multiple email accounts, 
Signature displays options to use the message for All Accounts or Per 
Account. If you choose Per Account, settings for each account appear so 
that you can specify unique signatures for each.
Follow these steps to create and send email:
	
	 1.	 With Mail open, tap the New Message button.
	
	 A blank message form (see Figure 7-12) appears.

127
Book I 
Chapter 7
Working with Email 
in Mail
Opening Mail and Reading Messages
Figure 7-12: The very basic email message form.
	
2.	 Enter a recipient’s address in the To field either by typing it or by tapping 
the Dictation key on the iPad’s onscreen keyboard (fourth-generation 
iPad and later) and speaking the address.
	
	
	 If you have saved addresses in Contacts, tap the plus sign (+) in an 
address field to choose an addressee from the Contacts list that 
appears.
	
3.	 If you want to copy other people on the message, tap the Cc/Bcc field.
	
	 Both Cc and Bcc fields are displayed. Enter addresses in either or both. 
Use the Bcc field to specify recipients of blind carbon copies, which means 
that no other recipients are aware that that person received this reply.
	
4.	 Enter a subject for the message in the Subject field.
	
5.	 Tap in the message body and type your message.
	
6.	 If you want to check a fact or copy and paste some part of another 
message into your draft message, swipe down near the top of the 
email to display your Inbox and other folders. Locate a message or 
messages and if you wish, copy text; when you’re ready to return to 
your draft, tap the Subject of the email, which is displayed near the 
bottom of the screen along with any other open emails, and paste any 
text you might have copied into the new message.
	
7.	 Tap (you guessed it) Send.
	
You can also use Siri to address an email to a person for whom you’ve cre­
ated a record in your Contacts app that includes an email address. Just press 
and hold the Home button and say something like “Email Joe Smith,” confirm 
the contact, and then fill out the form that appears using either Dictation or 
the keyboard.
	
Want to shout at somebody in an email (not, of course, a practice I advo­
cate)? You can activate Caps Lock when using the onscreen keyboard on 
your iPad by double-tapping either Shift key. To turn off Caps Lock, tap 
either Shift key once. To use this functionality, first be sure to tap Settings➪
General➪Keyboard and enable Caps Lock.

128
Formatting Email
Formatting Email
You can apply some basic formatting to email text. You can use bold, under­
line, and italic formats; also, you can indent text using the Quote Level fea­
ture. To use the Quote Level feature from within your emails, you need to 
first make sure that it’s on. In Settings, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars; next, 
tap Increase Quote Level and then tap the Increase Quote Level On/Off 
switch. This setting allows you to increase and decrease how forwarded or 
reply text is indented. Then follow these steps to apply formatting:
	
1.	 Press and hold the text in a new or forwarded message and choose 
Select or Select All from the menu that appears to select a single word 
or all the words in the email.
	
	 Note that if you select a single word, handles appear that you can drag 
to add adjacent words to your selection.
	
2.	 To apply bold, italic, or underline formatting, tap the BIU button (see 
Figure 7-13).
Figure 7-13: Use BIU to add standard styles or emphasis, such as 
italicized book titles.
	
3.	 In the pop-up that appears (see Figure 7-14), tap Bold, Italics, or 
Underline to apply the respective formatting.
	
4.	 To change the indent level, tap at the beginning of a line and then tap 
Quote Level (refer to Figure 7-13).
	
5.	 Tap Increase to indent the text or Decrease to move indented text far­
ther toward the left margin.

Searching Email
I’m sure you’ve never mislaid an email, but some people do it all the time. 
What if you want to find all messages from a certain person or that contain a 
certain word in the Subject field? Of course, you can enter a name or term into 
Spotlight Search, and results will include any emails that match the search 
term as well as contacts, songs, and so on. Or you can use Mail’s handy Search 
feature to find that email. You can search To, From, and Subject fields.
Follow these steps to practice using Mail’s Search feature:
	
1.	 With Mail open, tap an account to display its Inbox.
	
2.	 In the Inbox, tap in the Search field.
	
	 The onscreen keyboard appears.
	
3.	 Enter a search term or name, as shown in Figure 7-15.
	
	 Matching emails are listed in the results.
	
	 If you have an email account set up to download messages to your 
device instead of accessing them from the mail server, you can use Mail 
to search the entire contents of the messages in that account.
	
To start a new search, tap the Delete key in the upper-right corner of the 
onscreen keyboard to delete the term, or tap the Cancel button next to the 
Search field.

Mark Email as Unread or Flag for Follow-Up
Figure 7-15: Tapping in the Search Inbox field opens the onscreen 
keyboard.
	
You can also use the Spotlight Search feature covered in Book I, Chapter 2 to 
search for terms in the To, From, or Subject lines of mail messages from this 
search feature that searches several apps.
Mark Email as Unread or Flag for Follow-Up
	
With a new feature in iOS 8, you can use a simple swipe to access tools that 
either mark an email as unread after you’ve read it, which places a blue dot 
before the message, or flag an email, which places an orange circle before it. 
These methods help you to remember to reread an email that you’ve already 
read or to follow up on a message at a later time.
	
1.	 With Mail open and an Inbox displayed, swipe to the left to display 
three options: More, Flag, and Trash. Note that you should swipe only 
about halfway across the message; swiping all the way to the left 
deletes the message.
	
2.	 Tap More.
	
	 On the menu shown in Figure 7-16, you’re given several options, includ­
ing Mark as Unread and Flag. Tapping either command applies it and 
returns you to your Inbox.
	
3.	 Tap Mark as Unread.
	
	 Note that you can also get to the Mark as Unread command by swiping 
to the right on a message displayed in your Inbox.
	
4.	 Swipe to the left on another email and then tap Flag.
	
	 An orange circle appears before the email.
	
You can either mark an email as unread or flag it; you can’t do both. Either 
action provides a unique visual clue indicating that you need to revisit this 
message before deleting it.

Deleting an Email
Deleting an Email
I have friends who never delete emails, but that, frankly, drives me nuts 
(plus, at some point, their mailbox fills up and new emails are rejected). 
When you no longer want an email cluttering up your Inbox, you can delete 
it. When you delete an email on your iPad, it’s gone from your Inbox, includ­
ing the Inbox you access through your mobile phone or computer. However, 
for a time, you can retrieve it if your email provider offers a Trash folder for 
your email account and if your settings for your account with that provider 
don’t cause emails to be deleted from their server on download.
Here’s how to delete those emails you no longer want:
	
1.	 With the Inbox displayed, tap the Edit button.
	
	 Circular check boxes display to the left of each message (see Figure 7-18).
Figure 7-18: Delete several messages at one time using the Delete feature.
	
2.	 Tap the circle next to the message you want to delete.
	
	 You can tap multiple items if you have several emails to delete. 
Messages marked for deletion show a check mark in the circular check 
box. (Refer to Figure 7-18.)
	
3.	 Tap the Trash button.
	
	 The message(s) moves to the Trash folder.

134
Organizing Email
	
Depending on your email provider, Mail may keep a copy of all deleted mes­
sages for a time in a Trash folder. To view deleted messages, go to the list of 
all mailboxes. Tap the account name in the Accounts list in the Mailboxes 
panel, and a list of folders appears. Tap the Trash folder, and all deleted mes­
sages display.
	
You can also delete an open email by tapping the Trash button in the toolbar 
that runs across the top of Mail or by swiping left or right on a message dis­
played in an Inbox and tapping the Trash button that appears.
Organizing Email
In most email accounts your ability to create folders is dependent on the 
email program’s abilities. Some providers don’t offer much support for man­
aging messages in folders. Depending on your email provider, you may be 
able to move messages into any of a few predefined folders in Mail, or you 
may have access to all the folders you’ve already set up using your 
computer.
Assuming that you have access to folders in your email account, with the 
folder containing the message you want to move (for example, the Trash or 
Inbox if you have an Outlook.com account) displayed, tap the Edit button. 
Circular check boxes display to the left of each message.
Follow these steps to move any message into another folder:
	
1.	 Tap the circle next to the message you want to move.
	
2.	 Tap the Move button.
	
3.	 In the folder list that appears (see Figure 7-19), tap the folder where 
you want to store the message.
	
	 The message is moved.
	
If you get a junk email, you might want to move it to the Spam or Junk Email 
folder. After you do, any future mail from that same sender is placed auto­
matically in that folder.
	
If you have an email open, you can move it to a folder by tapping the Folder 
icon on the toolbar that runs along the top. The Mailboxes list displays; tap 
a folder to move the message.

T

he Settings app is a command center for your iPad, allowing you to 
adjust the functionality of features such as the screen brightness and 
wallpaper, sound volume, and security features. You can also set up email 
accounts (which I tell you about in Chapter 7 of this minibook) and control 
how the Calendar and Contacts apps manage their respective details. 
Finally, you find settings for each of the individual preinstalled apps, as well 
as for many apps designed for the iPad that you may have downloaded to 
your device.
	
Check out settings for the Siri personal assistant feature of 
iPad in Book V, Chapter 6.
In this chapter, you get some highlights of the settings 
you’re likely to need most often and advice for how 
to use them.
Making Brightness and 
Wallpaper Settings
You might as well set up the visual side of iPad first so 
your interaction with the device is easy on the eyes and 
battery power. Two such categories in Settings help out 
with your display: Display & Brightness and Wallpaper.
Setting brightness
When using iPad day in and day out, you may find that a dimmer screen 
reduces strain on your eyes. Also, by reducing the brightness when using 
any app, you can save a little on your iPad’s battery life.

140
Making Brightness and Wallpaper Settings
To modify the brightness setting, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
2.	 In Settings, shown in Figure 8-1, tap Display & Brightness.
Figure 8-1: Display & Brightness settings are combined in one pane.
	
3.	 To control brightness manually, tap the Auto-Brightness On/Off switch 
(refer to Figure 8-1) to turn it off.
	
4.	 Tap and drag the Brightness slider to the right to make the screen 
brighter or to the left to make it dimmer.
	
5.	 You can also tap the Text Size setting to choose a size of text for any 
apps that support the Dynamic text feature, and tap the Bold Text 
switch to turn on this feature that may make text easier to see.
	
6.	 Tap the Home button to close Settings.
	
If glare from the screen is a problem for you, consider getting a screen pro­
tector. This thin film not only protects your screen from damage but also can 
reduce glare. These are available from a wide variety of sources (just do a 
web search for iPad screen protector) and cost about $2 each.
	
In the iBooks app, you can set a sepia tone for book pages, which might be 
easier on your eyes. See Book II, Chapter 7 for more about using iBooks.

Changing the wallpaper
Just as your desktop computer or laptop can display a pretty picture or pat­
tern as a desktop background called a wallpaper, so your iPad can display an 
image on the Home screen and the same or another picture that displays 
when your iPad is locked.
The default picture may be pretty, but it may not be the background that’s 
most appealing to you. Choosing different wallpaper may help you to see all 
the apps and status bar information on your Home screen, or just provide an 
image that appeals to your artistic sensibilities.
To change the wallpaper, do this:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen, and then tap Wallpaper.
	
2.	 In the Wallpaper settings that appear, tap Choose a New Wallpaper row.
	
3.	 In the pane that appears, tap either Dynamic or Stills under Apple 
Wallpaper to display wallpaper images.
	
	 Dynamic images use animation, and stills are static images.
	
	 You can also use your own picture for your wallpaper. Instead of choos­
ing Apple Wallpaper, tap a Photos collection such as Recently Added to 
browse your saved photos, select the picture you want to assign, and 
then resume with Step 5.
	
4.	 In the Wallpaper pane (see Figure 8-2), tap a wallpaper image.
	
	 A preview of that wallpaper appears onscreen.
Figure 8-2: Choose from various built-in wallpapers.

5.	 Tap Set Lock Screen (the screen that appears when you lock the iPad by 
tapping the power button), Set Home Screen (to use as the wallpaper), 
or Set Both.
	
6.	 Press the Home button.
	
	 You return to your Home screen where you can view the new wallpaper 
set as the background.
Managing General Settings
A great many of the iPad settings are tucked into the General category. These 
include Software Update to update the iOS, Spotlight Search, Siri, security 
settings such as Auto-Lock and Restrictions, and settings for things like date 
and time, the keyboard, and accessibility.
Here’s a rundown of some of the settings you’ll find tucked under General 
settings.
Handling security
Because you’re likely to take your iPad on the road on a regular basis, it’s a 
good idea to consider a few security features. Some save battery life and pro­
tect your data or access to certain apps.
Security settings involve three features, which you access through the 
General settings:
	
✓	Lock/Unlock: Turns off your display to save battery power when you 
close the cover for your iPad.
	
✓	Auto-Lock: Locks your iPad at a set interval. You can set the amount of 
time you want before your iPad goes to the Lock screen by tapping this 
setting.
	
✓	Restrictions: Allows you to restrict access to certain apps and content 
using a passcode (see Figure 8-3). This is useful if you don’t want your 
kids to access a particularly adult app or simply don’t want them brows­
ing with Safari or buying things with iTunes, for example.
In addition, there are two items in the main Settings (not within General set­
tings) that relate to security: Passcode and Privacy.
	
✓	Passcode allows you to assign a passcode to the Lock screen. You can 
set a passcode, turn it on or off, change the passcode, and set the time 
interval at which your passcode is required. This is useful if you don’t 
want to bother with a passcode for only brief periods of locking your 
iPad. Finally, you can use the Erase Data setting so that multiple failed 
attempts to access your device results in your iPad erasing all data on it. 

143
Book I 
Chapter 8
Managing iPad 
Settings
Managing General Settings
This could protect from prying eyes your contacts’ information, for 
example, or map data that shows your location. Note that if Simple 
Passcode is turned on (the default setting), you’re limited to a four-digit 
passcode. If you turn off the Simple Passcode setting, you can use a lon­
ger, stronger, passcode using a combination of letters and numbers.
	
✓	Privacy shows you which apps have requested access to your data or 
social accounts, and lets you enable or disable the access of an app to 
the various iPad features listed, such as its microphone or contacts.
	
If you forget a passcode, the only thing to do is restore iPad software, which 
can be a headache. The obvious advice here: Don’t forget your passcode!
Figure 8-3: Set a password and choose the apps or content you want 
to restrict in this pane.
Setting the date and time
By default, your iPad is set to Cupertino time — Cupertino, California, that 
is, home to Apple. If you have occasion to reset the time zone or date and 
time, either because you live somewhere other than near Apple headquar­
ters or you travel around with your iPad, here’s how you control the time 
setting on your iPad:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
2.	 Tap General.
	
3.	 Tap Date & Time.
	
	 The settings shown in Figure 8-4 appear.

144
Managing General Settings
Figure 8-4: Choose the time format or time zone, or let your iPad set 
things up for you.
	
4.	 Do any of the following:
	
•	 Tap the Off switch to turn 24-hour time on. This is military time, so 
2 p.m. is 1400, and so on.
	
•	 Tap the On/Off switch for Set Automatically. This feature sets your 
time and date based on your current location.
	
•	 Turn off the Set Automatically setting and then tap Time Zone, and a 
text-entry field displays along with your onscreen keyboard. Press the 
Delete key to delete Cupertino, and type your location. (If you type a 
major city near you and in the same time zone, it comes up on a list 
as you type, and you can just tap to select it.)
Controlling keyboard settings
Your keyboard is one of the most important ways in which you interact with 
iPad, so it’s helpful if you have all the onscreen keyboard settings just the 
way you want them. You can access these in Settings, under the Keyboard 
option in the General settings (see Figure 8-5), and they include the following:
	
✓	Auto-Capitalization and Auto-Correction: Allow iPad to help you avoid 
mistakes by automatically suggesting corrections to what it perceives as 
spelling errors, based on a built-in dictionary, or correcting capitalization 
mistakes you make after you finish entering a sentence.
	
✓	Check Spelling: If you want iPad to automatically check spelling, turning 
on this feature causes two things to happen: A jagged red line appears 
under problematic text in apps such as Notes and Mail; and as you type a 

145
Book I 
Chapter 8
Managing iPad 
Settings
Managing General Settings
word with a misspelling, a suggested correct spelling appears in a little 
bubble. If you also have Auto-Correction turned on, the word is corrected 
automatically when you finish typing it and add a space or punctuation 
mark (such as a period) after the word. Note that you can use the Undo 
key on the onscreen keyboard with numbers displayed to undo auto­
matic changes.
	
✓	Enable Caps Lock: Activates a feature that lets you double-tap the Shift 
key to activate Caps Lock. Note that when Caps Lock is activated, the 
Shift key on the onscreen keyboard is blue, and you tap the Shift key to 
turn Caps Lock off. This setting is turned off by default.
	
✓	“.” Shortcut: Turning this on activates a shortcut that allows you to 
enter a period and a space by double-tapping the spacebar.
	
✓	Keyboards: Gives you access to a choice of built-in keyboard styles such 
as QWERTY and AZERTY. You can also choose from dozens of language 
keyboard layout options, including German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, 
and my personal favorite, Estonian.
	
✓	Split Keyboard: Turns on a feature that allows you to break the 
onscreen keyboard into two pieces, one on each side of your screen, to 
make a more texting-like experience for those who like to type mainly 
with their thumbs.
	
✓	Shortcuts: Use these two settings to have iPad automatically convert 
common texting phrases into shortcuts — for example, you can replace 
omw (the shortcut) with “on my way” — or add new shortcuts to its 
repertoire.
Figure 8-5: Set up your keyboard to work the way you want it to.

146
Managing Sounds
	
In addition to modifying Keyboard settings in the General category, you can 
tap Language & Region to access more settings. You can change the language 
you use for interacting with the iPad; add new keyboards; set the region for­
mat (for example, for date, time, and phone numbers); and pick which calen­
dar to use (Gregorian, Japanese, or Buddhist).
Working with the Reset feature
If only life had a Reset button to put some things back the way they were. 
Well, life doesn’t, but iPad does. The last item in the General settings is 
Reset. When you tap it, you get options for resetting the following:
	
✓	Reset All Settings: All the preferences and settings are reset, although 
information that you’ve added to apps such as Calendar and Contacts 
doesn’t change at all.
	
✓	Erase All Content and Settings: This one both resets your settings and 
erases information that you’ve added to apps such as Calendar and 
Contacts. This is useful if you plan to sell your iPad (you also should 
turn off Find My iPad in the iCloud settings in this scenario, as otherwise 
the device will be locked to your Apple ID).
	
✓	Reset Network Settings: By choosing this, any networks you’ve set up 
are removed. iPad also turns off Wi-Fi and then turns it on again, which 
disconnects you from any network you’re connected to. Note that the 
Ask to Join Networks setting stays on.
	
✓	Reset Keyboard Dictionary: When you turn down the iPad’s suggestions of 
words as you type, you can add custom words to the keyboard dictionary. 
You do this by tapping an unrecognized word that an app has underlined; 
tapping the word rejects the suggestion and adds the current spelling of 
the word to the dictionary. If you don’t want to keep all those added words, 
use this Reset Keyboard Dictionary option.
	
✓	Reset Home Screen Layout: If you want to get back to the original Home 
screen that you saw when you took your iPad out of its box, choose this 
Reset Home Screen Layout option.
	
✓	Reset Location & Privacy: When you use an app like Maps that checks 
your location, it asks you whether it’s okay to do that. When you tap OK 
two times to let it proceed, it stops asking. If you want it to start asking 
again, tap this option.
Managing Sounds
The Sounds category has two main settings. One adjusts the volume level for 
all apps on your iPad; the other modifies whether system sounds play for 
events such as new email, calendar alerts, and keyboard clicks.

147
Book I 
Chapter 8
Managing iPad 
Settings
Managing Sounds
Adjusting the volume
Although individual applications such as Music and Videos have their own 
volume settings, you can set your iPad system volume as well to control the 
level of system sounds and sounds in apps that don’t have their own volume 
control. This system setting is the max against which Music volume settings 
work; if you set volume to 80% here, for example, Music’s 100% volume set­
ting will actually be the maximum system volume, or 80%.
You can simply press the volume rocker controls on the top-right side of 
your iPad (when it’s in portrait orientation) to increase or decrease volume. 
However, this doesn’t change the volume of ringers and alerts unless you 
change one additional setting. To adjust the system volume from the Settings 
pane, tap Sounds. In the Sounds pane that appears (see Figure 8-6), tap and 
drag the slider to the right to increase the volume or to the left to lower it. 
Note that you can also adjust system volume in the Control Center, which 
you display by swiping up from the bottom of the iPad screen.
Figure 8-6: Use this familiar volume slider to adjust your system’s volume.
	
Under General settings, make a choice from the Use Side Switch To settings 
to set the side switch on your iPad to mute all sounds. If you prefer to use 
that switch to lock screen rotation, another way to mute your iPad is to hold 
down the volume switch (below the Side switch on the top-right corner of 
the device) until the sound is effectively off. This method assumes that you 
have set this switch to control volume.

148
Making Network and Bluetooth Settings
Turning system sounds on and off
In my experience, people are either big fans or big haters of system sounds 
on computers. You know, sounds like that annoying chime you hear when a 
new email arrives? iPad also makes sounds when certain events occur, if you 
want it to. You can turn on and off the following system sounds:
	
✓	Ringtone
	
✓	Text Tone
	
✓	New Mail
	
✓	Sent Mail
	
✓	Tweet
	
✓	Facebook Post
	
✓	Calendar Alerts
	
✓	Reminder Alerts
	
✓	AirDrop
	
✓	Lock Sounds
	
✓	Keyboard Clicks
To turn these off or on, or to choose different system sounds, from the 
Settings pane, tap Sounds and use the On/Off switch for the last two settings, 
or choose None or a different sound for any of the others.
	
You can control the Apple Push Notification Service, used to push alerts to 
your Apple device, via the Notifications category in Settings. This lets you 
control the alerts sent to you. You can turn alerts on and off, for example, 
which can save a bit of your battery life. You can also control alerts in a spe­
cific app’s settings.
Making Network and Bluetooth Settings
You can make a few settings for your networks and Bluetooth: ones for vir­
tual private networks (VPNs) under General settings, ones for Wi-Fi net­
works, and finally, settings for 3G/4G network cellular data.
	
You may have read in the news that your iPad and iPhone save a record of 
your every move. If you don’t like that idea, plug your iPad or iPhone into your 
computer and, when iTunes opens, click your device. Then, with the Summary 
tab selected, click the Encrypt iPhone/iPad Backup option. Apple can find your 
phone if you enable Find My iPhone, but Apple can’t view your backed up 
information in iCloud!

149
Book I 
Chapter 8
Managing iPad 
Settings
Managing iCloud Settings
A virtual private network (VPN) allows you to set up an encrypted connec­
tion with a private network, such as one at your office, over the Internet. A 
VPN lets you make such a connection securely, and your iPad allows you to 
make settings for activating your connection through General settings.
	
For more about connecting to your company network remotely and configur­
ing a VPN, see Book III, Chapter 1.
The Wi-Fi settings include simply turning Wi-Fi on or off, choosing which net­
work to connect to, and activating a feature that joins recognized networks 
automatically.
I can’t forget 3G and 4G. If you have a 3G or 3G/4G iPad, you can make some 
settings for your 3G/4G connections by tapping Settings and then tapping 
Cellular Data. See Book III, Chapter 1 for more about these settings.
	
Note that you can also use the Airplane Mode setting to turn your Wi-Fi and 
Bluetooth signals off when in flight and quickly turn them back on again 
when you’re safely on terra firma. This setting is also available through 
Control Center.
	
Another setting that you can make in Privacy Settings to protect you when 
you’re online is to turn Location Services on or off. Turning this on lets apps 
like Maps find your current physical location. If you turn this feature off and 
an app needs Location Services to function, it prompts you to turn it on.
Managing iCloud Settings
iCloud is Apple’s online storage and sharing service. Chapter 5 of this mini­
book takes you through the steps involved in setting up an iCloud account, 
one of the things you can do using the iCloud pane in the Settings app. (See 
Figure 8-7.) Here are the other three main things you can control for iCloud 
from within Settings:
	
✓	Turn various apps on or off for inclusion in iCloud syncs. For example, 
you can set Contacts to sync contacts stored in your iCloud account. 
Your iCloud account can sync Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, and 
Notes in your iCloud account.
	
✓	Control Storage & Backup. This includes checking your available stor­
age, buying additional storage, or turning iCloud Backup on or off.
	
✓	Set Up Family Sharing. Use this to set up an account that up to six peo­
ple can use to make and share purchases using a single credit card.

Most bundled apps have a corresponding group of settings in the iPad. 
Rather than bore you by taking you through each and every one, I provide 
Table 8-1, which gives you an overview of most of the types of settings you 
can control. (Note that settings for the first three apps, Mail, Contacts, and 
Calendar are all included in the Mail, Contacts, and Calendars settings.) If 
you like to work with a particular app often, it’s worth your while to explore 
the settings for it to see whether one might make your life with that app a bit 
easier.

Pads don’t grow on trees — they cost a pretty penny. That’s why you 
should know how to take care of your iPad and troubleshoot any prob­
lems that it might have so that you get the most out of it.
In this chapter, I provide some advice about the care and maintenance of 
your iPad, as well as tips about how to solve common problems, update 
iPad system software, and even reset your iPad should something go 
seriously wrong. In case you lose your iPad, I even tell you about 
a feature that helps you find it, activate it remotely, or even 
disable it if it’s fallen into the wrong hands. Finally, you 
get information about backing up your iPad settings 
and content using iCloud.
Maintaining Your iPad
You have a great gadget and an investment to pro­
tect in your iPad. A few simple precautions can keep 
it damage-free — at least until you rush out and buy 
the next version.
It’s wise to keep the screen clean and safe from damage, 
as well as maximize your battery use. The following sec­
tions tell you how.
Keeping the iPad screen clean
If you’ve been playing with your iPad, you know — despite Apple’s claim 
that iPads have fingerprint-resistant screens — that iPads are fingerprint 
magnets. They’re covered with an oil-resistant coating, but that definitely 

154
Maintaining Your iPad
doesn’t mean they’re smudge-proof. One way to avoid those finger smudges 
is by obtaining an inexpensive stylus — just be sure it’s got a soft or pliable 
tip and is designed for use with an iPad.
	
Avoid a few smudges in the first place by using a stand or dock to hold your 
iPad. With a stand or dock, you spend less time picking up your tablet, 
which cuts down on fingerprints.
Here are some tips about cleaning your iPad screen:
	
✓	Use a dry, soft cloth. You can get most fingerprints off with a dry, soft 
cloth such as the one you use to clean your eyeglasses or a cleaning tis­
sue that’s lint- and chemical-free. Or try products used to clean lenses in 
labs, such as Kimwipes or Kaydry, which you can get from several major 
retailers such as Amazon.
	
✓	Use a slightly moistened soft cloth. To get the surface even cleaner, 
very slightly moisten the cloth before you use it to clean the screen. 
Again, make sure that whatever cloth material you use is lint free.
	
✓	Remove the cables. This may go without saying, but I’ll say it anyway: If 
you don’t want a fried iPad, turn it off and unplug any cables from it 
before cleaning the screen with a moistened cloth.
	
✓	Avoid moisture. Avoid getting moisture around the edges of the screen 
where it can seep into the unit.
	
✓	Never use any household cleaners on your iPad screen. They can 
degrade the coating that keeps the screen from absorbing oil from your 
fingers.
	
	Do not use premoistened lens-cleaning tissues to clean your screen. Most 
of these products contain alcohol, which can damage the screen’s coating.
Protecting your gadget with a case
Your screen isn’t the only element on the iPad that can be damaged, so 
consider getting a case for it so that you can carry it around the house or 
around town safely. Besides providing a bit of padding if you drop the 
device, a case makes the iPad less slippery in your hands, offering a better 
grip when working with it.
Several types of cases are available for iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3, and more 
are showing up all the time. You can choose the Smart Cover from Apple that 
covers the screen, for example ($39); the Smart Case from Apple, which 
wraps around the iPad completely ($79 for Air 2 and $69 for iPad mini 3); or 
covers from other manufacturers. I’ve found the covers from other manufac­
turers to be somewhat sturdier than Apple cases. For instance, Tuff-Luv 
(www.tuff-luv.com) and Griffin Technology (www.griffintechnology.
com) come in materials ranging from leather (see Figure 9-1) to silicone (see 
Figure 9-2).

155
Book I 
Chapter 9
Maintaining and 
Troubleshooting
Maintaining Your iPad
Cases range in price from a few dollars to $125 or more for leather; some will 
cost you hundreds of dollars. Some provide a cover (see Figure 9-1), and 
others protect only the back and sides or, in the case of Smart Cover, only 
the screen. If you carry around your iPad much at all, consider a case with a 
screen cover to provide better protection for the screen or use a screen 
overlay, such as the InvisibleShield from ZAGG (www.zagg.com).

of iPad cases.

Maintaining Your iPad
Extending your iPad’s battery life
The much-touted ten-hour battery life of the iPad is a wonderful feature, but 
you can take some steps to extend that battery life even further. You can 
estimate how much battery life you have left by looking at the battery icon 
in the far-right end of the status bar at the top of your screen. Here are a few 
tips to help that little icon stay full up:
	
✓	Use a wall outlet to charge. Though it can vary depending on your com­
puter model, generally when connected to a recent model Mac computer, 
iPad will slowly charge; however, some PC connections don’t provide 
enough power to prevent battery drain. Even so, the most effective way to 
charge your iPad is to plug it into the wall outlet using the Lightning to USB 
Cable (or Dock Connector to USB Cable for pre–fourth-generation iPads) 
and the 10W USB Power Adapter that came with your iPad. (See Figure 9-3.)
Figure 9-3: The provided cord and power adapter.
	
✓	Turn off the iPad. The fastest way to charge the iPad is to turn it off 
while charging it.
	
✓	Consider letting your iPad totally run out of battery charge once a 
month and then recharging it to prevent a memory effect that can have 
an effect on your lithium-ion battery life.
	
✓	Avoid USB ports on keyboards. Your battery may lose some power if 
you leave it connected to the USB port on a keyboard or other device.
	
	The best way to charge your iPad is with the included cord plugged into 
an electrical outlet. Using your computer to charge it can take a great 
deal longer. There are also power strips and adapters now available that 
have USB ports so that you can charge several USB devices at one time.
	
✓	Limit the screen’s impact on the battery. Turn off the screen when not 
in use because the display eats up power. Also, reduce the screen bright­
ness in Settings to save power.

✓	Turn off Wi-Fi. If you’re not using Wi-Fi, turn it off in Settings or in the 
Control Center. Constantly maintaining a Wi-Fi connection or searching 
for a signal can use up a bit of power.
	
Your iPad battery is sealed in the unit, so you can’t replace it as you can with 
many laptops or your cellphone battery. If the battery is out of warranty, you 
have to fork over the money, possibly more than $100, to get a new one. If 
you use your iPad a great deal, consider getting the AppleCare service con­
tract for free replacement. See the “Getting Support” section, later in this 
chapter, to find out where to get a replacement battery.
	
Apple has introduced AppleCare+. For $99, you get two years of coverage, 
which even covers you if you drop or spill liquids on your iPad. If your iPad 
has to be replaced, it costs only $50, rather than the $250 it used to cost with 
garden-variety AppleCare (but only for two instances). That means $149 ($99 
for AppleCare+ plus $50 replacement fee) versus the $299 price Apple offered 
me to replace my fourth-generation iPad when it died 14 months into its life 
(after I was advised that Apple couldn’t service it). You can also purchase it 
when you buy your iPad or within a month of the date of purchase. See www.
apple.com/support/products/ipad.html.
Troubleshooting Your iPad
Although everyone wants to think that his or her iPad is a perfect magical 
machine, unburdened with the vagaries of crashing and system software 
bugs, that’s not always the case.
Here are some common issues that can come up with your iPad, along with 
ways to deal with them.
Dealing with a nonresponsive iPad
If your iPad goes dead on you, it’s most likely a power issue, so the first 
thing to do is to plug the Lightning to USB Cable (or Dock Connector to USB 
Cable for pre–fourth-generation iPads) into the 10W USB Power Adapter, 
plug the 10W USB Power Adapter into a wall outlet, plug the other end of the 
Lightning to USB Cable (or Dock Connector to USB Cable) into your iPad, 
and charge the battery.
Another thing to try — especially if you think that an app might be hanging 
up the iPad — is to press the Sleep/Wake button for a few seconds. Then 
press and hold the Home button. The app you were using should close.
You can always try the old reboot procedure, which in the case of an iPad 
means pressing the Sleep/Wake button on the top until the Slide to Power Off 
control displays. Drag the slider to the right to turn off your iPad. After a few 

158
Troubleshooting Your iPad
moments, press the Sleep/Wake button to boot up the little guy again. Be 
sure that your battery has a decent charge because this procedure can eat 
up battery power.
If the situation seems drastic and none of these ideas works, try to reset 
your iPad. To do this, press the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at 
the same time until the Apple logo appears onscreen.
Troubleshooting keyboard woes
When you’re using a Bluetooth keyboard, your onscreen keyboard won’t 
appear. The physical keyboard has, in essence, co-opted keyboard control of 
your device. To use your onscreen keyboard with a Bluetooth keyboard con­
nected, you have a few options: You can turn off your connection to the 
Bluetooth keyboard, turn off Bluetooth in iPad’s Settings or the Control 
Center, switch off the keyboard, or move the keyboard out of range. Your 
onscreen keyboard should reappear.
Are you accidentally tapping extra keys on the onscreen keyboard as you 
type? Wearing a wrist support can keep you from hitting extra characters 
with your wrists. Also, it’s much easier to use the onscreen keyboard in land­
scape mode where it’s just plain wider.
Updating software
Just as software manufacturers provide updates for your main computer, 
Apple occasionally updates the iPad system software to fix problems or offer 
enhanced features. Occasionally check for an updated version (say, every 
month). You can do this by opening Settings, tapping General, and then tap­
ping Software Update.
	
Note that if you’ve chosen to back up and restore iPad via iCloud when you 
first set up the device or later using Settings, restoring and updating your 
device happens automatically. (See Chapter 5 in this minibook for more 
about iCloud.)
If you choose not to use iCloud, follow these steps to update the iPad system 
software using a connection to your computer and iTunes 11:
	
1.	 Connect your iPad to your computer.
	
2.	 On your computer, open iTunes.
	
3.	 Click your iPad’s name near the top-right corner of the screen.
	
4.	 Click the Summary tab, as shown in Figure 9-4.
	
5.	 Click the Check for Update button.
	
	 iTunes displays a message telling you whether a new update is available.

6.	 Click the Update button to install the newest version if yours isn’t 
up-to-date.
Figure 9-4: Get system updates for iPad through your 
iTunes account.
	
If you’re having problems with your iPad, you can use the Update feature to 
try to restore the current version of the software. Follow the preceding set of 
steps and then click the Restore button instead of the Update button in Step 6. 
Typically, restoring an OS to another version does run the risk of going back 
to original settings, so be aware of that going in.
Restoring sound
Coincidentally, the very morning I wrote this chapter, my husband was put­
tering with his iPad when the sound suddenly stopped. We gave ourselves a 
quick course in recovering sound, so now I can share these tips with you. 
Make sure that
	
✓	You haven’t touched the volume control keys on a physical keyboard 
connected to your iPad via Bluetooth. They’re on the right side of the 
top-right side of your iPad when holding it in portrait orientation. Be 
sure not to touch one and inadvertently lower the sound ’til it’s essen­
tially muted.

160
Getting Support
	
✓	You haven’t flipped the Side switch. If you have the Side switch set to 
control sound, moving the switch mutes sound on your iPad.
	
✓	The speaker isn’t covered up. Make sure that you haven’t covered up 
the speaker in a way that muffles the sound.
	
✓	A headset isn’t plugged in. Sound won’t play through the speaker and 
the headset at the same time.
	
✓	The Volume Limit is set to Off. You can set up the Volume Limit in Settings 
for Music to control how loudly the Music app can play (which is useful if 
your partner’s into loud rap music). Tap Settings on the Home screen and 
then tap Music. In the settings that appear, tap the Volume Limit controls 
(see Figure 9-5) and move the slider to adjust the Volume Limit.
Figure 9-5: Volume Limit lets your iPad get only so loud.
	
If all else fails, reboot. That’s what worked for us — just press the Sleep/
Wake button until the Slide to Power Off control appears. Drag the slider to 
the right. After iPad turns off, press the Sleep/Wake button again until the 
Apple logo appears, and you may find yourself back in business, sound-wise. 
If you’re also an iPhone user, and Siri or Voice Control stops understanding 
you, you’ll be glad to know that this reboot trick works for them, as well!
Getting Support
As you may already know if you own another Apple device, Apple is known 
for its great customer support, so if you’re stuck, I definitely recommend 
that you try them. Also, be aware that every new iPad comes with a year’s 

161

coverage for repair of the hardware and 90 days of free technical support. 
Here are a few options that you can explore for getting help:
	
✓	The Apple Store: Make an appointment online or by phone and then go 
to your local Apple Store if one is handy to find out what the folks there 
might know about your problem.
	
✓	The Apple iPad Support website: Visit this site at www.apple.com/
support/ipad (see Figure 9-6) or check out the iBooks Store. Here you 
find online manuals, discussion forums, downloads, and the Apple 
Expert feature, which enables you to contact a live support person by 
phone.
Figure 9-6: Don’t forget to check out the manuals and discussions for help.
	
✓	The iPad User Guide: You can visit http://manuals.info.apple.
com/en_us/ipad_user_guide.pdf to view your iPad user guide. You 
can also download the manual and read it in most popular e-reader 
programs.
	
✓	The Apple battery replacement service: If you need repair or service 
for your battery, visit www.apple.com/batteries/replacements.
html.
	
Note that your warranty provides free battery replacement if the battery 
level dips below 50 percent and won’t go any higher during the first year you 
own it. If you purchase the AppleCare service agreement, this is extended to 
two years. Also note that Apple recommends that the iPad battery should be 
replaced only by an Apple Authorized Service Provider.

Finding a Missing iPad
You can take advantage of the Find My iPad feature to pinpoint the location 
of your iPad. This is a very handy feature if you forget where you left your 
iPad or somebody walks away with it. Find My iPad lets you not only track 
down the critter but also wipe off the data contained in it if you have no way 
to get the iPad back.
	
If you’re using Family Sharing, your family can help each other out if some­
one in your family loses an iOS device. Anybody in the family can find the 
device and play a sound without having to sign into the missing device with 
its password. This works even if the ringer on the iPhone is turned off. See 
Book II, Chapter 1 for more about Family Sharing.
Follow these steps to set up this feature:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
2.	 Tap iCloud.
	
3.	 In the iCloud settings that appear, tap Find My iPad.
	
4.	 Tap the On switch for the Find My iPad setting (see Figure 9-7) that 
appears to turn the feature on if it isn’t already.
	
5.	 Tap the Send Last Location On switch so that iPad sends your iPad’s 
location to Apple if your battery is almost out of juice, if you’d like.
If your iPad is ever lost or stolen, go to www.icloud.com on your computer 
and enter your ID and password. Click the Find My iPad button to display a 
map of its location, as shown in Figure 9-8. Click the circle representing your 
iPad; then click the Information button (the small i) in the toolbar that 
appears. In the dialog that appears, to erase all information from the iPad 
in a process called wiping, click the Erase iPad button. Remember that this 
action erases all content, including contacts, music, notes, and so on, for 
good. To lock the iPad from access by others, click the Lost Mode button.

You can also tap Play a Sound to send whomever has your iPad a note saying 
how to return it to you — or a note that the police are on their way if it has 
been stolen! If you choose to play a sound, it plays for two minutes, helping 
you track down your iPad or anybody holding it within earshot.

Backing Up to iCloud
Backing Up to iCloud
You used to be able to back up your iPad content only using iTunes, but with 
iCloud, you can back up via a Wi-Fi network to your iCloud storage. Note that 
whereas iTunes backs up everything, iCloud backs up only what Apple con­
siders your most important content — Apple never backs up videos you get 
from sources other than iTunes, for example. Note that you can back up to 
iTunes or iCloud, but not both at the same time. However you can always 
sync to iTunes which copies apps and documents.
You get 5GB of storage (not including iTunes-bought music, videos, apps, 
and electronic books or content pushed automatically among your Apple 
devices by iTunes Match) for free, or you can pay for increased levels of stor­
age (10GB for $20 per year, 20GB for $40 per year, or 50GB for $100 per year).
To perform a backup to iCloud, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
	 See Chapter 5 in this minibook for details on creating an iCloud account.
	
2.	 Tap iCloud and then tap Backup (see Figure 9-9).
Figure 9-9: Backing up to the cloud.
	
3.	 In the pane that appears (see Figure 9-10), tap the iCloud Backup On/
Off switch to enable automatic backups, or to perform a manual 
backup, tap Back Up Now.
	
	 A progress bar shows how your backup is moving along.

i

Pad is set up with a preinstalled iTunes Store app that makes it easy to 
shop for music, movies, TV shows, audiobooks, and podcasts at Apple’s 
iTunes Store.
In this chapter, you discover how to use your iPad to find content on the 
iTunes Store website. That content can be downloaded directly to your iPad, 
or to another device and then synced to your iPad. With the new Family 
Sharing feature, which I cover in this chapter, as many as six people 
can share purchases and make purchases using the same 
credit card. Finally, I cover a few options for buying content 
from other online stores and how to download pur­
chases automatically using iCloud.
	
I cover opening an iTunes account and downloading 
iTunes software to your computer in Book I, 
Chapter 5. If you need to, handle those two tasks 
before digging into this chapter.
Exploring the iTunes Store
Whether it’s your favorite shopping source or not, the 
iTunes Store is set up to be your most convenient source 
for content on your iPad at the moment. Sure, you can get 
content from other places, but the iTunes Store app comes prein­
stalled on your iPad — and Apple makes it easy to access it from various 
Apple devices or your PC.

170
Exploring the iTunes Store
So, it’s time you get to know the iTunes Store: the easiest way to grab all 
those movies, TV shows, and music that you love for viewing and listening 
to on your iPad.
Visiting the iTunes Store
Using the iTunes Store from your iPad is easy with the preinstalled iTunes 
Store app. You just tap the iTunes Store app on the Home screen.
Now you can roam around trying different options. You have music, movies, 
TV shows, and audiobooks to choose from. If you begin to purchase or rent 
an item and you’re not already signed in with your Apple ID, the dialog 
shown in Figure 1-1 appears, asking for your sign-in information. Enter your 
ID and password (you may have created one when you set up your iPad or 
may have already had one) and tap OK.
Figure 1-1: Log in to the iTunes Store.
Start exploring musical selections by tapping the Music button in the row of 
buttons at the bottom of the screen, if it’s not already selected, as shown in 
Figure 1-2. Tap the See All link in any category of music to display more 
music selections.
Tap the Music button in the upper-left corner to go back to the featured 
Music selections; then tap the Genres button at the top left of the screen. 
This step displays a list of music genres that you can choose from. Tap one. 
Items in the genre are organized by criteria, such as New and Noteworthy 
Albums and iTunes Essentials. Tap any listed item to see more details about 
it, as shown in Figure 1-3.
The navigation techniques in these steps work essentially the same in any of the 
content categories (the buttons at the bottom of the screen), which include 
Music, Movies, Audiobooks, and TV Shows. Just tap one to explore it.

If you want to use the Genius playlist feature, which recommends additional 
purchases based on the contents of your library, open the iTunes Store app 
on your iPad and tap the Genius button at the bottom of the screen. If you’ve 
made enough purchases in iTunes, song and album recommendations 
appear based on those purchases. You also see the content in your iTunes 
Match library (a fee-based music service) if you have one.
Finding a selection
You can look for a selection in the iTunes Store in several ways. You can use 
the Search feature, search by genres or categories, or view artists’ pages. 
Here’s how these work:
	
✓	Search: Tap in the Search field shown in Figure 1-4 and enter a search 
term, which could be a genre of music, the name of an album or song, or 
an artist’s name, for example, using the onscreen keyboard. Tap the Search 
button on the keyboard or, if one of the suggestions given appeals to you, 
just go ahead and tap it. Search results are divided into categories such as 
Songs and Albums. Flick down to scroll through them and find what you 
need. Tap Cancel to return to the Music selections screen.
Figure 1-4: Search by composer, artist, or album title.
	
✓	Link: On a description page that appears when you tap a selection, you 
can find more offerings by people involved, such as a singer or actor, if 
you tap the Related tab, as shown in Figure 1-5.

If you find a selection you like, tap the Share button at the top of the descrip­
tion page to share your discovery with a friend via Mail, Message, Twitter, or 
Facebook. For all sharing choices but AirDrop, a message appears with a link 
that your friend can click to view the selection. Enter an address in the To 
field and tap Send or Post. Your friend is now in the know.
Previewing music, a movie, or an audiobook
Because you’ve already set up an iTunes Store account (if you haven’t done 
so yet, see Book I, Chapter 5), when you choose to buy an item, it’s automati­
cally charged to the credit card or PayPal account you have on record or 
against any allowance you have outstanding from an iTunes gift card.
However, you might just want to preview an item before you buy it to be sure 
that it’s a good fit. If you like it, buying and downloading are then easy and quick.
Follow these steps to preview your content:
	
1.	 Open the iTunes Store and locate a selection you might want to buy 
using any of the methods I outline in earlier sections.
	
2.	 Tap the item to see detailed information about it, as shown in Figure 1-6.
	
3.	 Sample the content:
	
•	 For a movie or audiobook selection, tap the Trailer button (see 
Figure 1-6) to play a preview.
	
•	 For a TV show, tap an episode to get further information.

174
Exploring the iTunes Store
Figure 1-6: Why not preview before you buy?
	
•	 If you want to listen to a sample of a music selection, tap the track 
number or name of a selection with a red preview icon to the right of 
it, as shown in Figure 1-7. A small square appears and the track plays. 
Tap the square to stop the preview.
Figure 1-7: You can also preview music before you rent or buy.
If you like what you hear or see, you’re ready to buy. Which brings you to the 
next section.

Book II 
Chapter 1
Buying Content at 
iTunes and Beyond
Exploring the iTunes Store
Buying a selection
Although you can find some freebies out there, and you can rent certain 
movies rather than buy them, you’ll often have to buy the music, video, or 
audio that you want to enjoy. Buying involves authorizing the purchase and 
downloading the content to your iPad (which is done automatically after the 
purchasing part is complete).
	
Buying and downloading a movie while running your iPad on a 3G/4G net­
work can eat up your data allocation and take a while — if such a large file 
can even download at all. You’re better off downloading this content while 
connected to a Wi-Fi network. To play it safe, to disable cellular download 
for the iTunes Store, go to Settings➪iTunes & App Store and turn off the Use 
Cellular Data switch.
When you find an item you want to buy, here’s how to make your purchase:
	
1.	 Tap the button that shows either the price (if it’s a selection available 
for purchase; see Figure 1-8) or the word Free (if it’s a selection avail­
able for free).
	
	 The button label changes to Buy X, where X is the particular content 
you’re buying, such as a song or album.
Figure 1-8: Buy the content you want using these buttons.
	
2.	 Tap the Buy X button.
	
	 The iTunes Password dialog appears. (Refer to Figure 1-1.)

176
Exploring the iTunes Store
	
3.	 Enter your password and tap OK, or if you have a credit, tap the 
Redeem link and enter the code provided.
	
	 In the confirming dialog, tap Download. The item begins downloading 
and is automatically charged to your credit card or against a store 
credit. When the download finishes, you can view the content using 
the Music or Videos app, depending on the type of content you 
bought.
	
If you want to buy music, you can open the description page for an album 
and click the album price, or buy individual songs rather than the entire 
album. Tap the price for a song and then proceed to purchase it.
Note the Redeem button on many iTunes Store screens. Tap this button 
to redeem any iTunes gift certificates you might have gotten from your 
generous friends, or from yourself. Your purchases are debited against 
your certificate balance; if the item costs more, your credit card is then 
charged for the remainder.
If you don’t want to allow purchases from within apps (for example, Music or 
Videos) but rather want to allow purchases only through the iTunes Store, 
you can tap Settings➪General➪Restrictions and then tap Enable Restrictions 
and enter a passcode. After you set a passcode, you can tap individual apps 
to turn on restrictions for them, as well as for actions such as deleting apps, 
sharing via AirDrop, or using Siri.
Renting movies
In the case of movies, you can either rent or buy content. If you rent, which 
is less expensive but makes the content yours for only a short time, you 
have 30 days from the time you rent the item to begin to watch it. After you 
have begun to watch it, you have 24 hours remaining from that time to watch 
it as many times as you like (but only on the same device). To rent a movie, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 With the iTunes Store open, tap the Movies button.
	
2.	 Locate the movie you want to rent and tap to open it, as shown in 
Figure 1-9.
	
3.	 Tap the Rent button.
	
	 The Rent button changes to a Rent Movie button (see Figure 1-10). At 
this point, you may be asked to enter your Apple ID and password.
	
4.	 Tap the Rent Movie button to confirm the rental.
	
	 The movie begins to download to your iPad immediately, and your 
account is charged the rental fee.
	
	 After the download is complete, you can use the Videos app to watch it. 
(See Chapters 2 and 3 in this minibook to read about how these apps work.)

Some movies are offered in high-definition versions in addition to standard 
definition. These HD movies look great on that crisp, colorful iPad screen, 
especially if you have a third-generation (or later) iPad with Retina display. 
It’s best to download these over a Wi-Fi connection because a 3G/4G connec­
tion could incur hefty charges.

178
Shopping Anywhere Else
You can also take content that you’ve downloaded to your computer and 
sync it to your iPad. See Book I, Chapter 5 for more about this process.
Shopping Anywhere Else
Many content stores have added iPad-friendly videos to their collections, so 
you do have alternatives to iTunes for your choice of movies or TV shows. 
You can also shop for music from sources other than iTunes, such as 
Amazon.
You can open accounts at these stores by using your computer or your 
iPad’s Safari browser and then following a store’s instructions for purchasing 
and downloading content. Keep in mind that costs will vary. For example, 
one such provider is Hulu. To get iPad-friendly content from Hulu, you have 
to sign up for the Hulu Plus service and pay a monthly fee (less than $10). 
Then, download the app directly from Hulu and start watching content.
Here are some online stores and content providers that offer iPad-compatible 
content:
	
✓	TV (www.tv.com) provides its online television and movie content to 
iPad.
	
✓	Ustream (www.ustream.tv) has a mobile app for streaming sports and 
entertainment programs to mobile devices.
	
✓	ABC (http://abc.go.com) and CBS News (www.cbsnews.com) 
stream live TV programming to the iPad.
	
✓	Netflix (www.netflix.com) makes movies and TV shows available that 
can be streamed to the iPad.
	
✓	PBS (www.pbs.org), the king of documentary and artsy movie pro­
gramming, has several apps for iPad including Nova Elements iPad App, 
PBS Kids iPad app, and PBS for iPad for other programming.
	
✓	iMP4hub (www.imp4hub.com) is all about free MPEG-4–format movies 
for iPad, iPhone, and Android devices.
Additionally, if you get content onto your Mac or Windows machine, you can 
stream it to your iPad using Air Video ($2.99) and Air Video Server, and it will 
do an on-the-fly conversion. For more information, go to www.inmethod.
com/air-video/index.html. Another free utility for Windows, OS X, and 
Linux that converts most video to an iPad-friendly format is HandBrake. Go 
to http://handbrake.fr for more information.
	
There are also apps that stream content if you pay a subscription fee or are 
an existing customer. Two good ones are Xfinity TV from Comcast and 
TWCable from Time Warner.

Enabling Autodownloads of Purchases 
from Other Devices
With iCloud, after you set up an iCloud account, either during the initial 
setup of your device or through iPad Settings, you can make a purchase or 
download free content on any of your Apple devices that have been set up 
for auto-download, and you can have those purchases automatically copied 
onto any or all your Apple devices. To enable this auto-download feature on 
iPad, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
	 To use iCloud, first set up an iCloud account. See Book I, Chapter 5 for 
detailed coverage of iCloud, including setting up your account.
	
2.	 Tap iTunes & App Store.
	
3.	 In the options that appear, tap the On/Off switch to turn on any cate­
gory of purchases you want to auto-download to your iPad from other 
Apple devices: Music, Apps, or Books (see Figure 1-11).
	
	 At this point, Apple doesn’t offer an option of auto-downloading video 
content using these settings, probably because video is such a memory 
and bandwidth hog. You can always download video directly to your iPad 
through the iTunes Store app or sync to your computer using iTunes to 
get the content or through the iTunes U app for educational content.

Setting Up Family Sharing
Setting Up Family Sharing
Family Sharing is a new feature that allows up to six people to share whatever 
anybody in the group has purchased from the iTunes, iBooks, and App Stores 
even though you don’t share Apple accounts. Your family must all use one 
credit card to purchase items, but you can approve purchases by younger 
children. You can also share calendars, photos, and a family calendar (see 
Book V, Chapter 3 for information about Family Sharing and Calendar, and 
Book II, Chapter 6 for information on sharing Photos in a Family album).
Start by turning on Family Sharing:

lmost everybody on Earth has heard of the iPod — that small, 
­portable, music-playing device from Apple that’s seemingly 
glued into the ears of many. The iPad includes an iPod-like 
app called Music that allows you to take advantage of the 
iPad’s pretty amazing little sound system to play your 
favorite style of music or podcasts and audiobooks.
In this chapter, you can get acquainted with the 
Music app and its features that enable you to sort 
and find music and control playback from your 
iPad. You also get an overview of the AirPlay fea­
ture, which you can use to play music on your iPad 
over a home network. Finally, I introduce you to 
iTunes Radio.
Looking Over Your Library of Music
In Chapter 1 of this minibook, I guide you through the process of get­
ting content onto your iPad. After you have some audio content in the form 
of music, podcasts, or audiobooks, it’s organized into collections, and you 
can find that content by categories such as artist or genre with predefined 
category buttons along the bottom of the Music app screen.

184
Looking Over Your Library of Music
Viewing the library contents
You can easily view the contents of your library collections, which you may 
have synced from your computer or shared over a network, pushed to your 
device through iCloud, or downloaded directly using iPad’s Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi+
Cellular capability. (See Chapter 1 in this minibook for details.)
Take a tour of your Music library collections by following these simple steps:
	
1.	 Tap the Music app, located in the Dock on the Home screen.
	
	 The Music library appears (see Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-1: The Music library showing your music by Artists.
	
2.	 Tap the Playlists, Artists, Songs, Albums, Genres, Compilations (such 
as the Best of British Rock), or Composers button at the bottom of the 
library to view your music according to these criteria. (Refer to 
Figure 2-1.)
	
	 The Purchased button appears only if you’ve already obtained content 
on iTunes.
	
3.	 Tap the Radio button (see Figure 2-2) to view this feature, discussed in 
more detail later in this chapter.

The iTunes Store has several free items that you can download and use to 
play around with the features in Music, including music and podcasts. You 
can also sync content stored on your computer or other Apple devices to 
your iPad and play it using the Music app. See Book I, Chapter 5 for more 
about syncing.
Apple offers a service called iTunes Match (www.apple.com/itunes/
itunes-match). You pay $24.99 per year for the capability to match the 
music you’ve bought from other providers or ripped from CDs (and stored 
on your computer) to what’s in the iTunes Store inventory. If there’s a match 
(and there often is), that content is added to your iTunes library at 256 Kbps. 
If there’s audio that isn’t a match, it’s uploaded to iCloud and synced to your 
iPad. Then, using iCloud, you can sync the content among all your Apple 
devices. The upward limit of 25,000 tracks works for most users.
	
You can use the iTunes Summary tab on your computer to make a setting to 
sync music at 128 Kbps. Doing this saves space on your iPad if you’re an 
avid music downloader, though the audio quality is lower. You can also make 
a setting for whether to download album covers in iTunes.
Creating playlists
Everybody loves playlists. They give you a way to compile your very own 
music mix to match your mood or the occasion. You can easily create your 
own playlists with the Music app to put tracks from various sources into col­
lections of your choosing.

186
Looking Over Your Library of Music
With the Music app open, follow these steps to create your own playlists:
	
1.	 Tap the Playlists button at the bottom of the iPad screen.
	
2.	 Scroll up the screen and tap New Playlist in the options that are 
revealed.
	
3.	 In the dialog that appears, enter a name for the playlist and tap Save.
	
4.	 Tap an album such as Recently Played or Purchased, and in the list 
that appears (see Figure 2-3), tap the plus sign next to each item you 
want to include.
	
	 The Add symbol on selected items turn gray.
Figure 2-3: Personalize your Music experience with custom playlists.
	
5.	 Tap the Done button.
	
6.	 Tap the Playlists button.
	
	 Your playlist appears in the Playlists list, and you can play it by tapping 
the list name to reveal its songs and then tapping the Play button in the 
playback controls at the upper left.
	
You can use the Genius Playlist feature in iTunes Store to set up playlists of 
recommended content in your Music library. Based on items you’ve pur­
chased, iTunes Store suggests other purchases that would go well with your 
collection. Okay, it’s a way to get you to buy more music, but if you’re build­
ing your music collection, it might be worth a try! Visit the iTunes site at 
www.apple.com/itunes for more information.

To delete a song from the playlist, swipe left to right across the name of the 
song you want to delete and then tap the Delete button.
Searching for audio
If you can’t find what you want by going through collections or categories, 
you can search for an item in your Music library by using the Search feature. 
You can enter an artist’s, audiobook author’s, or composer’s name or a word 
from the item’s title in the Search field to find what you’re looking for.
	
You can also ask Siri to play a selection or use the Spotlight Search feature 
from the Home screen to search for music. You can also ask Siri to identify 
music that’s playing around you, for example in an elevator or at a club, and 
using the Shazam music identification service, Siri tells you the name of the 
tune and allows you to buy it at the iTunes Store.
With the Music app open, tap in the Search field (see Figure 2-4). The 
onscreen keyboard opens.
Figure 2-4: Enter your search terms and see what you find!
Enter a search term in the Search field. Or tap the Dictation key (see Figure 2-5) 
on the onscreen keyboard of an iPad (the Dictation key is not present on 
the iPad 2) to speak the search term; then tap the Search button on the 
­keyboard. Results display, narrowing the search as you type. Now just tap 
any item in the search results to play it.

Figure 2-5: Music search results.
Playing Music and Other Audio
You have all that music and other audio content to listen to, and beyond 
downloading and organizing your selections, that’s what Music is mainly for. 
You’ll find the typical playback tools in the Music app, but in case you want 
a refresher, here’s the quick rundown on how to use Music as a player.
Playing your tunes
Playing an audio file is simple, and you’ll be glad to know that Music can con­
tinue to play in the background while you go about using other apps. If 
you’re browsing in Safari, for example, with a track playing in Music, you can 
double-tap the Home button and a mini toolbar opens where you can control 
playback without leaving the browser. If your iPad is showing the Lock 
screen, you can also use controls displayed there to control music playback 
for currently playing selections.
The procedure for playing music is to basically find what you want to play, 
and then use the playback tools to play it. Here’s how:
	
1.	 Locate the item you want to play using the methods I describe in pre­
vious sections of this chapter.
	
2.	 Tap the item you want to play from the list that appears.
	
	 If the item is stored on iCloud, tap the iCloud symbol next to it to down­
load it before you can play it.

	 The song begins playing. Note: If you’re displaying the Songs tab, you 
don’t have to tap an album to open a song; you need only tap a song to 
play it. If you’re using any other tab, you have to tap items such as 
albums or multiple songs from one artist to find the song you want to 
hear.
	
3.	 Tap Now Playing to display the album cover full screen (see Figure 2-6).
Figure 2-6: View your album’s cover as you listen.
	
4.	 If you want to go to a specific item, such as a song in the album that’s 
playing, tap the item you want to play from the list that appears.
	
	 It begins to play.
	
5.	 Use the Previous and Next buttons that display when you tap the top 
of the screen (refer to Figure 2-6) to navigate the audio files.
	
	 The Previous button takes you back to the beginning of the item that’s 
playing or the previous track if nothing is playing; the Next button takes 
you to the next item.
	
6.	 Tap the Pause button to pause playback.
	
	 You can also use music controls from the Lock screen to control music 
that’s playing.
	
7.	 Tap and drag the line just below the album cover that indicates the 
current playback location on the progress bar left or right to “scrub” 
to another location in the song.

190
Playing Music and Other Audio
	
8.	 Don’t like what’s playing? Tap the Back to Library button (the < icon) 
in the top-left corner to return to the Playlist list, or tap the Album 
List button in the top-right corner to show other tracks in the album 
that’s playing and make another selection.
You can use Siri to play music hands free. Just press and hold the Home but­
ton, and when Siri appears, say something like “Play ‘Take the A Train’” or 
“Play The White Album.”
	
The Home Sharing feature of iTunes allows you to share music among as 
many as five computers that have Home Sharing turned on (iOS devices and 
Apple TVs, second generation or later, don’t count against that limit). To use 
the feature, each device has to have the same Apple ID for Home sharing. 
After you set up the feature via iTunes, you can retrieve music and videos 
from your iTunes shared library to any of the devices. For more about Home 
Sharing — which is discussed further in the later section, “Using AirPlay and 
Home Sharing” — visit this site: www.apple.com/support/homesharing.
Shuffling music
If you want to play a random selection of the music you’ve purchased or 
synced through iCloud or from your computer to your iPad, use the Shuffle 
feature. With the Music app open, tap the Songs or Albums button at the bot­
tom of the screen. Next, tap the Shuffle button shown in Figure 2-7. Your con­
tent plays in random order.
Figure 2-7: Shuffle your music for a varied musical experience.

Adjusting the volume
Music offers its own volume control that you can adjust during playback. 
This volume is set relative to the system volume that you control using the 
iPad’s Settings app; if you set it to 50%, it will play at 50 percent of the sys­
tem volume setting.
With Music open, tap a piece of music to play it. In the controls that appear 
onscreen (see Figure 2-8), press and drag the button on the Volume slider to 
the right for more volume or to the left for less volume. To mute your iPad’s 
speaker at any time, press the Mute button to the right of the volume slider 
or, if it’s set up to control volume in Settings, slide the Side switch on the 
side of your iPad to on.
Figure 2-8: Louder or softer, just use the slider to get the effect you want.
	
If you have volume set at high and you’re still having trouble hearing, con­
sider getting a headset. These devices cut out extraneous noises and should 
improve the sound quality of what you’re listening to. I recommend that you 
use a 3.5mm stereo headphone (a 1/8" headphone sometimes works fairly 
well) and insert it in the headphone jack at the top of your iPad. You can also 
use Apple’s iPod or iPhone EarPods, which work just fine with the iPad. The 
iPhone EarPods include a microphone as well.

192
Using AirPlay and Home Sharing
Using AirPlay and Home Sharing
AirPlay and Home Sharing are two methods of sharing music among devices.
AirPlay gives you the ability to stream audio to externally powered speakers 
on your wireless network as well as to home entertainment centers that 
include an Apple TV unit. Several speaker manufacturers have built AirPlay 
hardware into their systems. AirPlay streaming technology is built into the 
iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, as well as being available to iTunes on 
Windows PCs and Macs. With AirPlay, you can send media files from one 
device to be played on another. You can send (say) a movie that you pur­
chased on your iPad or a slideshow of photos to be played on your TV — 
and control the playback from your iPad. You can also send music to be 
played over speakers.
There are a few ways to do this. You can purchase an Apple TV and stream 
video, photos, and music to the TV, or you can purchase an AirPort Express 
Wi-Fi router and attach your speakers to it to play music. Finally, if you buy 
AirPlay–enabled wireless speakers, you can stream audio directly to them. 
Because this combination of equipment varies, my advice — if you’re inter­
ested in using AirPlay — is to visit your nearest Apple Store or certified Apple 
dealer and find out which hardware combination will work best for you.
	
iOS 8 supports peer-to-peer AirPlay support, which means that if you can 
make a direct connection to AirPlay speakers or Apple TV, you can share 
content such as music and photos without being on the same network.
To use AirPlay with another AirPlay–enabled device on your network or in 
close proximity, swipe up from the bottom of your screen and tap the 
AirPlay button in the Control Center.
	
If you get a bit antsy watching a long movie, one of the beauties of AirPlay is 
that you can still use your iPad to check email, browse photos or the 
Internet, or check your calendar while the media plays.
Home Sharing is a feature of iTunes that you can use to share music and 
video among devices that have Home Sharing turned on. To use the feature, 
each device has to have the same Apple ID on your network. After it is set up 
via iTunes, you can stream music and videos to any of the devices, and even 
click and drag content between devices using iTunes on your computer. 
iTunes on your computer can also share its library over a network. For more 
about Home Sharing, visit this site: www.apple.com/support/homesharing.

I

n this chapter, I cover the preinstalled app called Videos. The Videos app 
is a player with which you can watch downloaded movies and TV shows, 
as well as media you’ve synced from iCloud or your Mac or PC.
If you own an iPad that can run iOS 8, you can take advantage of the rear-
facing iSight camera with the ability to record video in 720p HD (high defini­
tion) and video stabilization to prevent those wobbly video moments. You 
can also benefit from the Retina display on iPad/iPad mini to watch videos 
with super-high resolution, which simply means that they’ll look very, very 
good.
If you like to view things on a bigger screen, you can use 
iPad’s AirPlay technology and Apple TV, a device that 
will cost you $99, to send your iPad movies and photos 
to a TV that supports HDMI.
	
Note that iPads that can run iOS 7 or later sport two 
video cameras that you can use to capture your 
own videos. By purchasing the iMovie app (a 
scaled-down version of the longtime mainstay on 
Mac computers), you add the capability to edit 
those videos. You find out about both of these fea­
tures in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
In this chapter, I explain all about watching, rating, delet­
ing, and sharing video content from a variety of sources. You 
might want to refer to Chapter 1 in this minibook first to purchase 
or download one of many free TV shows or movies you can practice with.

198
Finding Videos
Finding Videos
Note that you can get video content through the iTunes Store and some 
third-party companies that support iPad, including Netflix and ABC TV. You 
can also use an app such as Air Video to send content from your Mac or PC 
to your iPad via a wireless connection, or use the EyeTV app from your Mac 
to send live TV or recordings. Some of the content you find online is free, 
and some shows or movies will cost you a few bucks.
	
You can also view videos you stream from a Home Sharing–enabled iTunes 
library over a home network, which can really save space on your iPad 
because the content can be stored on another device (such as a hard drive 
attached to your Mac or PC). Turn on Home Sharing in the Video category of 
Settings on your iPad.
This chapter focuses mainly on the bundled Videos app, but you should also 
note that more and more online content providers are making it possible to 
view videos on their sites. For example, you can go to Flickr and use its 
HTML5 player for video playback. Also, using Family Sharing, you have 
access to videos purchased by anybody in your Family Sharing group.
See Chapter 1 in this minibook for more about buying or renting movies or 
TV shows using the iTunes Store and setting up a Family Sharing account. For 
information about shooting your own videos, see Chapter 4 in this minibook.
Playing Movies or TV Shows
Did you realize that your iPad is a miniature home entertainment center? 
The built-in Videos app can play TV shows and movies.
Also, note that you can stream video content from your iPad to play on your 
TV. Buy an app such as Samsung TV Media Player, and you can fling video 
content playing on your iPad to your Samsung Smart TV.
When you first open the Videos app, you may see relatively blank screens 
with a note that you don’t own any videos and a link to the iTunes Store. 
After you purchase TV shows and movies or rent movies, you see tabs for 
the different kinds of content you own. Use the steps in Chapter 1 of this 
minibook to download video content to your iPad. After you download con­
tent, use these steps to work with Video’s familiar playback tools to play it:
	
1.	 Tap the Videos app on the Home screen to open the application.
	
2.	 On a screen like the one shown in Figure 3-1, tap the appropriate 
category at the top of the screen (Movies, Rentals, or TV Shows, 
depending on the content you’ve downloaded).

•	 Tap either Go to Previous Chapter or Go to Next Chapter to move to a 
different location in the video playback if the video supports chapters.
	
•	 Tap the circular button on the Volume slider and drag it left or right to 
decrease or increase the volume, respectively.
	
•	 Tap the circular button on the Progress bar to move to another spot in 
the video.

Turning on Closed-Captioning
	
You can set up widescreen viewing options in the Videos section of Settings. 
For more about using Settings, see Book I, Chapter 8.
	
Note that if you’ve watched a video and stopped it partway through, the next 
time you open the video in iPad, it opens, by default, at the last location that 
you were viewing. To start a video from the beginning, just as with most play­
ers, you simply tap and drag the circular button on the Progress bar all the 
way to the left. You can also change the default setting from starting where 
you left off to starting from the beginning in iPad’s Settings app under Video.
Turning on Closed-Captioning
If you have hearing challenges or are a fan of foreign flicks, you’ll be glad to 
know that iPad offers support for closed-captioning and subtitles. This feature 
requires that you have content that supports closed-captioning (not all shows 
or movies do) and that you go to Settings to turn on the feature. Look for the 
CC logo on media that you download to use this feature; be aware that video 
you record using the iPad video camera won’t have this capability.
Are you limited to iTunes video content on your 
iPad or viewing all your downloaded content on 
the smaller screen? Not at all. You can connect 
iPad to your television, so you can watch ­videos 
on the more vision-friendly larger screen. To do 
this, you have to buy the Digital AV Adapter at 
the Apple Store. The Apple Digital AV Adapter 
is a $39.95 accessory; the Apple TV costs $99. 
You also need any other appropriate cables for 
your TV to complete the connection. (Or you 
can use AirPlay via an Apple TV.)
Note that iPad supports only the following 
video formats: H.264 video up to 1080p, 30 
frames per second; MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 
Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second; 
and Motion JPEG (M-JPEG), up to 35 Mbps, 
1280 by 720 pixels, 30 frames per second. You 
can use conversion software such as Mac AVI 
to iPad Video Converter to be able to convert, 
edit, and play AVI movies on your iPad. You can 
also stream with Air Video Live Conversion or 
use the free HandBrake app to convert to an 
iPad-friendly format.
In addition, you can rip Blu-ray video disc con­
tent to an iPad-compatible format and then 
transfer the content by syncing to your com­
puter using iTunes. You can use the Blu-ray 
Ripper for Mac here: www.aunsoft.com/
blu-ray-ripper-mac. You can use the 
free Windows Aiseesoft Blu-ray to iPad Ripper 
at 
www.aiseesoft.com/blu-ray-
ripper.html to handle the transfer.
Finally, check out the Air Video app from 
InMethod. Using this app, you can stream 
content to your iPad, convert content, or save 
content to iTunes, which you can then sync to 
your iPad.

Deleting Video Content
Media files can, as you know, take up lots of space in a computing device. 
Even if you bought the iPad model with the largest amount of memory, its 
memory can fill up fast. When you’ve bought content from the iTunes Store, 
you can always download it again, so if you’re not planning on watching an 
item again soon, deleting it from your iPad and freeing up some space is a 
good idea. Or, sync with iTunes on a computer again to get the content back 
on your iPad. If you want to delete content that you didn’t purchase from the 
iTunes Store, be sure to back it up to your computer first; otherwise, you 
can’t get at it again when it’s gone from your iPad.

204
Sharing Your Favorite Videos
	
Note that if you rent content and delete it after watching it, you can’t get it 
back without paying for it again.
To delete items that aren’t stored in iCloud (items stored in iCloud have a lit­
tle cloud next to them), tap Videos on the Home screen. Locate the item you 
want to delete on the Movies, TV Shows, or Rentals tab and then press and 
hold the item; a Delete button appears. Tap the Delete button, and the item 
is deleted. (To delete multiple items, tap the Edit key instead at this point.)
	
If you buy a video using iTunes Store, you’ll find it saved in iCloud. You can 
tap the iCloud button to download the video.
Sharing Your Favorite Videos
You can share your opinion about a video using Mail, Twitter, or Facebook:
	
1.	 Tap the Videos app on the Home screen to open it and then tap the 
Store button. Find a video you want to share and tap it.
	
2.	 In the information screen shown in Figure 3-6, tap the Share button 
(a box with an arrow at the top of it, at the top of the screen).

W

ith its gorgeous Retina screen (from third-generation iPads on), iPad 
is a natural for viewing photos and videos. It supports most common 
photo formats, such as JPEG, TIFF, and PNG. You can shoot your photos and 
videos by using the built-in cameras in iPad with preprogrammed square or 
panorama modes, and edit your images using filters that are new with the 
Camera app that comes with iOS 7. Additionally, you can sync photos from 
your computer, iPhone, or digital camera, and save images you find online or 
receive by email to your iPad.
If you have the third-generation or later iPad, you have a built-in 
iSight camera for your rear-facing camera. This improvement 
on previous iPad cameras is a 5-megapixel beauty with an 
illumination sensor that adjusts for whatever lighting is 
available. Face detection balances focus across as 
many as ten faces in your pictures. The video camera 
option offers 1080p HD (high-definition video) with 
video stabilization that makes up for some shaking 
as you hold the device to take videos.
When you have photos to play with, the Photos app 
lets you organize photos from the Camera Roll and 
view photos in albums, one by one, or in a slideshow. 
A new feature lets you view photos by the year they 
were taken, with images divided into collections by the 
location or time you took them. You can also AirDrop, email, 
message, post to Facebook, or tweet a photo to a friend, or print 
it. And if you like to play around with photo effects, you’ll enjoy the 
photo-editing features as well as the preinstalled app, Photo Booth.

208
Working with Photos
If video is more up your alley, in this chapter, you also discover how to use 
the video cameras in iPad. For those who want to share videos of themselves 
and their surroundings with others, I cover using the video cameras along 
with FaceTime to make video calls.
Working with Photos
iPads (except for the original iPad) come with cameras — two, to be exact. 
These cameras allow you to capture video and photos. And because one 
camera is front-facing and the other is rear-facing, you can switch between 
them to capture images of yourself holding the iPad or images of what you’re 
looking at.
On an iPad, the front-facing camera captures high-definition video at 720p; 
the rear-facing camera captures high-definition video at 1080p.
When you capture photos, they appear in the Photos app’s Camera Roll, 
where you can view them, email them, and so on. (See Chapter 6 in this mini­
book for more about using the Photos app.) The Photo Streams feature lets 
you share groups of photos with people using iCloud on an iOS 6 device or 
later, or on a Mac computer with the Mountain Lion OS or later installed, or 
on a PC via iCloud. (See Book V, Chapter 1 for more about sharing files using 
iCloud.)
The cameras in the iPad are just begging to be used, so get started!
Taking pictures with the iPad camera
When you use an iPad camera, you can switch it between a standard camera 
and a video camera, and choose whether to use the front or rear camera. To 
work with the standard camera to take pictures, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap the Camera app icon on the Home screen to open the app.
	
	 If the orange-highlighted word in the row of words below the Capture 
button (see Figure 4-1) is Video, slide up to set Photo (the still camera) 
as the active setting rather than video.
	
2.	 Set the Square option using the same slider control below the Capture 
button.
	
	 This setting lets you create square images like those you see on the 
­popular Instagram site.

3.	 Move the camera around until you find a pleasing image, and then 
you can do a couple of things at this point to help you take your 
photo:
	
•	 Tap the area of the grid where you want the camera to autofocus.
	
•	 Pinch the screen to display a zoom control; drag the circle in the 
zoom bar to the right or left to zoom in or out on the image. Note 
that zooming doesn’t change resolution and so can degrade the 
image.
	
4.	 Tap the Capture button at the right side of the screen.
	
	 You’ve just taken a picture, and it’s stored automatically in the Photos 
app Camera Roll.
	
5.	 Tap the icon in the top-right corner to switch between the front 
­camera and rear camera.
	
	 You can now take pictures of yourself.
	
6.	 Tap the Capture button, hold and release it to take another picture.
	
	 Alternately, you can use the volume rocker as a shutter release. 
Remember to smile!
	
7.	 To view the last photo taken, swipe to the left or tap the thumbnail of 
the latest image in the bottom-right corner of the screen (visible in 
Figure 4-2).
	
	 The Photos app opens and displays the photo.

8.	 Tap Done.
	
	 You return to the Camera app.
	
9.	 Tap the Home button to close the Camera app and return to the Home 
screen.
Printing photos
If you have a printer that’s compatible with Apple AirPrint technology, you 
can print photos. As of this writing, most major manufacturers offer printers 
that have this capability, and you can bet that Apple’s working with other 
manufacturers to provide more compatible choices. However, if you don’t 
want to spring for one of these models, you can also use apps such as 
Printopia and HandyPrint to provide this functionality to other printers on 
your network.
	
If you don’t have access to this kind of wireless printer, when you plug iPad 
into your computer, you can sync both devices via iTunes.
To print a photo, do this:
	
1.	 With Photos open, maximize the photo you want to print.
	
2.	 Tap the Share icon and then tap Print.
	
	 The Printer Options dialog appears. (See Figure 4-3.)

	 Your photo goes on its way to your printer.
Playing around with Photo Booth
Photo Booth is a photo-manipulation app that goes hand in hand with the 
still camera built into the iPad (except for the original iPad) hardware. You 
can use this app to capture photos using various fun effects, such as 
Kaleidoscope and X-Ray. You can then copy or email photos from within 
Photo Booth.
Note that photos you take with Photo Booth open automatically and are 
saved to your Photos app’s Camera Roll.
Here’s how to take photos using Photo Booth effects:
	
1.	 Tap the Photo Booth icon on the Home screen.
	
	 The different possible effects that can be used in the current view of the 
camera appear. (See Figure 4-4.)
	
2.	 Tap an effect.
	
3.	 Tap the Capture button.
	
	 An image using that effect is captured. (See Figure 4-5.)
	
	 To return to the various effects, tap the Effects button in the bottom-left 
corner of the screen.

Before you start recording, make sure you know where the camera lens is 
(in the top-center portion of the device on the front and top-right side of the 
back when holding iPad in a portrait orientation) — while holding the iPad 
and panning, you can easily put your fingers directly over the lens!

Getting Face to Face with FaceTime
Getting Face to Face with FaceTime
FaceTime is an excellent video-calling app that’s available on the iPhone 4 
and later and is now available on iPads (except for the original iPad). The 
app lets you call people who have FaceTime on their iOS 5 or later devices 
using a phone number or an email address. You and your friend or family 
member can see each other as you talk, which makes for a much more per­
sonal calling experience.
In iOS 7, the ability to make audio-only FaceTime calls has been added. The 
audio quality beats a phone call by quite a bit, and the audio-only calls don’t 
require quite so robust a connection or use as much data bandwidth as a 
video FaceTime call does.
You can also show the person on the other end of the call your surroundings 
by using the rear iPad camera and panning around you. The possibilities are 
limitless: Show your husband the toy you’re thinking of buying your son for 
his birthday, let your girlfriend see your new car while she’s busy at work, or 
share your artwork or trip to the wine country with friends.
You can use your Apple ID and email address to access FaceTime, so after 
you install it, it works pretty much out of the box. See Book I, Chapter 5 for 
more about getting an Apple ID.
	
If you’re having trouble using FaceTime, make sure the feature is turned on. 
Tap Settings on the Home screen and then tap FaceTime. Tap the On/Off 
switch to turn it on, if necessary. You can also select the email and phone 
account that can be used to make phone calls to you on this Settings page.
Who can use FaceTime
Here’s a quick rundown of what device and what iOS you need for using 
FaceTime’s various features:
	
✓	FaceTime is available on all iPads except the original iPad.
	
✓	You can call people who have iPhone 4 or later, iPad 2 or later, fourth-
generation iPod touch, or a Mac (running OS X 10.6.6 or later).
	
✓	You can use a phone number to connect with iPhone 4 or later.
	
✓	You can connect using an email address with a Mac, iPod touch, or iPad.
Making a FaceTime call
You can make and receive calls with FaceTime using a phone number 
(iPhone 4/4s/5/5s/5c) or an email account (iPad 2 or later, iPod touch fourth-
generation or later, or a Mac running OS X 10.6.6 or later), and show the per­
son on the other end what’s going on around you.

216
Getting Face to Face with FaceTime
	
If you have a Wi-Fi–only iPad and use FaceTime over a Wi-Fi network, that 
limits the places from which you can make or receive video calls to your 
home wireless network or a public hotspot. On the other hand, you avoid 
costly data usage over a 3G or 4G network with this setup even if you own a 
3G/4G iPad model.
You have to use the appropriate method for placing a FaceTime call, depend­
ing on the kind of device the person you’re calling has. If you’re calling an 
iPhone 4 or later user, use a phone number the first time you call, and there­
after, you can use the phone number or email address; if you’re calling an 
iPad 2 or later, an iPod touch, or a FaceTime for Mac user, you have to make 
the call using that person’s email address.
	
You can’t adjust audio volume from within the app or record a video call. 
Nevertheless, on the positive side, though its features are limited, this app is 
very straightforward to use.
Follow these steps to use FaceTime:
	
1.	 Connect to a Wi-Fi or cellular (with iOS 6 or later) network.
	
	 See Book I, Chapter 5 for details on connecting.
	
2.	 If you know that the person you’re calling has FaceTime on an iPhone 
4 or later, an iPad 2 or later, or a Mac, add the person to your iPad 
Contacts.
	
	 See Book V, Chapter 5 for how to do this if that person isn’t already in 
Contacts.
	
3.	 Tap the FaceTime app icon on the Home screen.
	
	 The first time you use the app, you may be asked to select the phone 
number and email account you want to use for FaceTime calls and then 
to click Next. The FaceTime screen appears.
	
	 4.	 Tap the Contacts button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
	
5.	 Scroll to locate and tap a contact’s name.
	
	 The contact’s information displays (as shown in Figure 4-8).
	
	 You can also place a FaceTime call using Siri. Just say something like 
“Make a FaceTime call to Joey” and confirm Joey’s contact information, 
and the call is placed.

6.	 Tap the contact’s stored phone number or email address and then tap 
the Call button (shaped like a phone handset).
	
	 You’ve just placed a FaceTime call!
	
When you call somebody using an email address, the person must be signed 
in to his Apple ID account and have verified that the address can be used for 
FaceTime calls. iPad 2 or later and iPod touch (fourth-generation and later) 
users can make this setting by tapping Settings and then FaceTime; 
FaceTime for Mac users make this setting by choosing 
FaceTime➪Preferences.
When the person accepts the call, you see the person’s image and a small, 
draggable box containing your image (referred to as a Picture in Picture, or 
PiP). (See Figure 4-9.)
	
You can also simply go to the Contacts app, find a contact, tap the FaceTime 
icon in that person’s record, and then tap her phone number or email 
address in the pop-up menu that appears to make a FaceTime call.

	 To view recent calls, tap the Recents button (refer to Step 4). Tap a recent 
call to call the person back.
Accepting or ending a FaceTime call
If you’re on the receiving end of a FaceTime call, accepting the call is about 
as easy as it gets. When the call comes in, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap the Answer button to take the call or tap the Decline button to 
reject it. (See Figure 4-10.)
	
	 If you want to decline the call and get a reminder to call back later, tap 
the Reminder button. You can choose to get a reminder in an hour or 
when you leave your current location. If you’d rather not answer but 
send a message to the caller, such as “Can’t talk right now” or “Call me 
later,” tap the Message button. If you do accept the call, chat away with 
your friend and tap the FaceTime button if you want to view video 
images.

To add a caller to your Favorites list, with FaceTime open, tap the Favorites 
button (marked with a star icon), and then tap the plus sign and select the 
person’s name from the contact list to add the person to Favorites. You can 
then locate the person to make a call to her by tapping Favorites and choos­
ing that person from a short list rather than scrolling through all your 
contacts.
Switching views
When you’re on a FaceTime call, you might want to use iPad’s built-in cam­
era to show the person you’re talking to what’s going on around you. Tap the 
Switch Camera button (refer to Figure 4-11) to switch from the front-facing 
camera that’s displaying your image to the rear-facing camera that captures 
whatever you’re looking at (shown in Figure 4-12).

U

nless you’ve spent the last few years working in Antarctica without a 
radio, you know that Twitter is a social networking service referred to 
as a microblog because it involves only short posted messages. Twitter sup­
port is incorporated into the iPad’s iOS, so you can tweet people from within 
the Safari, Photos, Camera, Maps, and other apps.
The Facebook app can also be activated through Settings. Facebook, the 
most popular social networking site, is integrated into iPad. You can 
also post messages and items such as photos to your 
Facebook page right from within several apps.
Messages is an app used for instant messaging (IM). IM 
involves sending a text message to somebody’s 
iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, or Mac (using any phone 
number or email address that the person has regis­
tered to her iCloud account) to carry on an instant 
conversation. With iOS 8 comes a few new features 
for Messages, including the capability to opt out of 
certain conversations, leave group conversations, 
and share your current location.
In this chapter, I introduce you to ways in which iPad 
makes use of Twitter, Facebook, and instant messaging to 
let you stay connected to the world.
Experiencing Twitter and Facebook on iPad
Twitter and Facebook are the darlings of the social networking world. 
Twitter, as a microblog, allows you to post only short messages (up to 140 
characters) called tweets. Facebook is much more robust, allowing lengthy 

222
Experiencing Twitter and Facebook on iPad
postings as well as photographs, videos, and various gifting schemes to woo 
Facebook friends. The use of each is integrated into iPad, typically via the 
Share feature in apps. When you tap the Share button, you can tap the 
Twitter or Facebook button to share the selected content via those services, 
if you have installed their apps and enabled them in Settings (see Figure 5-1).
Figure 5-1: Use app-sharing features to tweet or post to Facebook.
Connecting your iPad to Facebook and Twitter
Facebook and Twitter are integrated into the sharing feature of iPad. When 
you’re in an app such as Maps and you tap the Share button, you can post an 
item, such as a map, to Twitter or Facebook. This integration is described in 
the next task.
Before you use these integrated features, however, you have to have an 
account on those systems, install the Twitter and/or Facebook app, and 
enter information about your accounts. Follow these steps to do this with 
Facebook:
	
1.	 Tap Settings and then tap Facebook.
	
2.	 In the settings that appear (see Figure 5-2), tap the Install button to 
install the app.
	
3.	 When prompted, enter your Apple ID and password.

Figure 5-2: Tap the Install button, and the Facebook app appears on 
one of your many Home screens.
	
4.	 Enter your Facebook username and password and then tap Sign In.
	
5.	 On the confirming screen, tap the Sign In button.
	
Note that signing into Facebook downloads all Facebook friends to your 
Contacts app and downloads any Facebook events to your Calendar app on 
iPad. You can turn off individual apps that use your Facebook account one 
by one in the main Facebook settings.
Twitter is a social networking service that involves posting very short mes­
sages (tweets; limited to 140 characters; an attachment such as a photo may 
limit this character count further) online so that your friends can see what 
you’re up to. The ability to tweet is integrated into several apps. You can 
post tweets using the Share button within Safari, Photos, Camera, and Maps. 
First, go to Settings and tap Twitter. Then tap the Install button and add your 
account information.
Many readers already have a Twitter account and are hooked on tweeting. If 
you’ve never tweeted, you can go to www.twitter.com to sign up with the 
service; then activate Twitter in Settings and use the Twitter for iPad app to 
manage your Twitter account. After you have an account, you can post 
tweets, have people follow your tweets, and follow the tweets that other 
people post.

224
Experiencing Twitter and Facebook on iPad
Tweeting or posting to Facebook
When you have your Twitter account set up, you can be in a compatible app 
such as Safari, Photos, Camera, and Maps, and choose Twitter in the screen 
that appears when you tap the Share button. You see a Tweet form like the 
one shown in Figure 5-3. Just write your message in the form and then tap 
Send. Note that a number in the bottom-left corner lets you know how many 
characters you have left to use in your tweet.
To post to Facebook, just tap Facebook in the Share menu (refer to Figure 5-2), 
and follow pretty much the same procedure as for Twitter, except that you are 
allowed to choose who can see your posting: the general public, your friends, 
just you, or all friends (which includes friends of your friends).
Figure 5-3: Tweeting is a simple menu choice in several apps.
See Book I, Chapter 6 or Chapters 3 and 6 in this minibook for more about 
tweeting in the Safari or Photos apps.
	
When you’re filling in the tweet or Facebook posting, you can tap Location 
and then tap Enable in the dialog that appears to turn on Location Services, 
which allows Twitter to ascertain your location and share it with others. Be 
cautious about using this feature; if many people follow you on Twitter, they 
can use your location to track your movements and know where you live, 
where you go to school, where you socialize, and so on. This information can 
be used to commit a variety of online and offline crimes.

Setting Up an iMessage Account
Setting Up an iMessage Account
iMessage is a messaging service that is available through the preinstalled 
Messages app that allows you to send and receive instant messages (IMs) to 
and from others using an Apple iOS device (and on your Mac, if you have OS 
X Mountain Lion or later).
Instant messaging differs from email or posting to Facebook in an important 
way. Whereas you might email somebody and wait days or weeks before that 
person responds, or you might post a comment to your Facebook timeline 
that could sit a while before anybody views it, instant messaging communi­
cation happens almost immediately. You send an IM, and it appears on some­
body’s Mac, iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad right away; if the person wants to 
participate in a live conversation, that conversation begins immediately, 
allowing a back-and-forth dialogue in real time.
To set up iMessage, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
2.	 Tap Messages.
	
	 The settings shown in Figure 5-4 display.
	
3.	 If iMessage isn’t set to On, tap the On/Off switch (shown in Figure 5-4) 
to turn it on.

4.	 Check the Send & Receive setting to be sure that the email account 
associated with your iPad is correct.
	
	 This should be set up automatically based on your Apple ID.
	
5.	 To allow a notice to be sent to a sender to indicate that you’ve read a 
message, tap the On/Off switch for Send Read Receipts.
	
	 You can also choose to show a subject field in your messages.
	
6.	 If you want to include a subject field in messages, tap the On/Off 
switch for the Show Subject Field option.
	
7.	 Tap the Home button to close Settings.
	
Messages adds your iPhone’s number (if you have an iPhone using the same 
iCloud account) automatically as a location to which people can message 
you. Your iCloud email addresses are also added automatically. To add other

Remove This Email, and then confirm the deletion.
Using Messages to Create and Send Text, 
Audio, and Video Messages
Now you’re ready to use iMessage. This is a remarkably simple process that 
involves typing and sending a message and then waiting while the other per­
son types and sends a message back. This can go on for hours, so prepare a 
quick exit message ahead of time, just in case. (I have to walk my dog, the 
cat just exploded . . . you get the idea.)
Sending text messages
If you just have words to share, text messages are the tried-and-true method. 
Follow these steps to use Messages to send a text-based instant message:
	
1.	 From the Home screen, tap Messages in the Dock.
	
2.	 If this is the first time you’re using Messages, on the screen that 
appears (see Figure 5-5), tap the New Message button to begin a 
conversation.
	
3.	 Address your IM.
	
	 You can address a message in a couple of ways:
	
•	 Begin to type a name, email address, or phone number in the To 
field, or tap the iPad’s Dictation key (not present on the iPad 2) on 
the onscreen keyboard and speak the address, and a list of matching 
contacts appears.

	 You can also use Siri (not present in iPad 1 or 2) to send a message by 
simply pressing and holding the Home button, speaking your command, 
and then selecting the correct contact and method of messaging (phone 
or email).
	
4.	 Tap a contact on the list you chose to display in Step 3.
	
	 If the contact has both an email address and phone number stored, the 
Info dialog appears, allowing you to tap one or the other, according to 
which method you want to use for addressing the message.
	
5.	 To create a message, simply tap in the message field near the bottom 
of the screen and type or dictate your message.
	
6.	 To send the message, tap the Send button.
	
	 When your recipient(s) responds, you see the conversation displayed on 
the right side of the screen, as shown in Figure 5-7. Tap in the message 
field again to respond to the last comment.

and forth.
	
Here are some additional tips for using Messages:
	
✓	Talking with multiple people: You can address a message to more than 
one person by simply choosing more recipients in Step 4 in the preced­
ing list.
	
✓	Canceling a message: If you begin a conversation and change your mind 
before sending your message, tap the Cancel button near the top right of 
the screen.

If you want to start a conversation with a group of people, you can use group 
messaging. Group messaging is great for keeping several people in the con­
versational loop. You can
	
✓	Create a group message simply by addressing a message to more than 
one person and sending it. The message and replies to it are delivered to 
everybody in the group.
	
✓	When you receive a group message, you can manage your participation 
in the conversation by tapping the Details button. To temporarily mute 
notifications of responses to a conversation, set the Do Not Disturb 
switch to Off. Set Do Not Disturb back On to again receive contributions

W

ith its gorgeous screen, iPad is a natural for taking and viewing 
photos. It supports most common photo formats, such as JPEG, 
TIFF, and PNG. With an iPad, you can shoot your own photos using the 
built-in cameras (see Chapter 4 in this minibook for more about using 
them) with preprogrammed square or panorama modes, and 
edit your images using smart adjustment filters. You can 
also sync your photos from iCloud or your computer, 
iPhone, or digital camera using the iCloud Photo 
Library. You can save images that you find online to 
your iPad or receive them by Mail or Messages to 
your iPad.
After you have photos to play with, the Photos app 
lets you organize photos from the Camera Roll, 
viewing them in albums, one by one, or in a slide­
show, and you can view photos by the year they 
were taken, with images divided into collections by 
the location or time you took them. You can also 
AirDrop, email, message, post to Facebook, or tweet a 
photo; print it; or use your expensive gadget as an elec­
tronic picture frame. Finally, this chapter discusses the Photo 
Stream feature, which you can use to share groups of photos with 
people using iCloud on a Mac or iOS device.

234
Getting Photos into iPad
Getting Photos into iPad
Before you can play around with photos, you have to take some with the 
iPad camera, covered in Chapter 4 in this minibook, or get them onto your 
iPad from another source. You have a few different ways to get photos from 
elsewhere. You can buy an accessory to import them from your camera or 
iPhone; save a photo that you find on the web or receive as an email, mes­
sage, or tweet attachment; have somebody send you a photo via AirDrop 
from another nearby device; or sync to iCloud or your computer to down­
load photos you’ve saved there. The whole syncing process is discussed in 
Book I, Chapter 5. The two other methods are explained here.
	
Screenshots you take of your iPad screen are also saved to the Camera Roll 
album. To take a screenshot, display what you want to shoot, press and hold 
the Home button, tap the Sleep/Wake button, and then release. You’ll find 
your screenshot in the Photos Camera Roll album.
Importing photos from a digital camera
Your iPad camera and a computer aren’t the only sources of photos. You can 
import photos from a digital camera and photos or videos from your iPhone/
iPod touch if you buy the Lightening to USB Camera Adapter from Apple, 
which will set you back about $29, and the SD Card Reader to import image 
files from an SD card, also available at $29. You can also take advantage of 
the iOS 8 iCloud Photo Library, which stores images taken on any of your iOS 
devices.
	
You can find information in Book I, Chapter 5 about syncing iCloud content 
or your computer with your iPad to port over photos. You can also find out 
how to take and use photos from the iPad’s built-in camera in Chapter 4 of 
this minibook.
Follow these steps to import photos, after you have the adapters described 
earlier in this section in hand:
	
1.	 Start the import process by putting your iPad to sleep using the switch 
on the top right.
	
2.	 Insert the Lightening to USB Camera Connector into the Dock 
Connector slot of your iPad.
	
3.	 Connect the USB end of the cord that came with your digital camera 
or iPhone into the Camera Connector.
	
4.	 Connect the other end of the cord that came with your camera into 
that device.

Getting Photos into iPad
	
5.	 Wake your iPad.
	
	 The Photos app opens and displays the photos on the digital camera.
	
6.	 Tap Import All on your iPad.
	
	 If you want to import only selected photos, tap individual photos and 
then tap Import. Finally, tap Import rather than Import All.
	
	 The photos are saved to the Last Import album.
	
7.	 Disconnect the cord and the adapter.
	
	 You’re done!
	
You can also import photos stored on an SD (secure digital) memory card 
often used by digital cameras as a storage medium. Simply put the iPad to 
sleep, connect the SD Card Reader to the iPad, insert the SD card containing 
the photos, and then follow Steps 5 through 7 in the preceding list.
	
Remember that with AirDrop you can quickly send photos directly from your 
iPhone 5 or later to your iPad (fourth-generation or later, or mini), as long as 
the devices are within about 12 feet of each other, as well as to mid-2012 or 
newer Macs running OS X Yosemite.
Saving photos from the web
The web offers a wealth of images that you can download to your Photo 
Library on the iPad. The built-in Safari browser makes it simple to save any 
image you come across to your iPad. (Of course, you should be careful not 
to violate copyrights when using pictures you’ve grabbed online.)
	
Several search engines have advanced search features that allow you to 
search for only nonlicensed images, meaning, at least theoretically, that you 
don’t have to pay for the images. But it’s always a good idea to get written 
permission to use an image, especially if you intend to use it to make money 
(as with a company brochure or online course).
Follow these steps to save images from the web:
	
1.	 Open Safari and navigate to the web page containing the image you 
want.
	
2.	 Press and hold the image.
	
	 A popover appears, as shown in Figure 6-1.
	
3.	 Tap Save Image.
	
	 The image is saved to your Camera Roll album in the Photos app.

Looking at Photos

your iPad.
For more about how to use Safari to navigate to or search for web content, 
see Book I, Chapter 6.
	
A number of sites protect their photos from being copied by applying an 
invisible overlay. This blank overlay image ensures that you don’t actually 
get the image you’re tapping. Even if a site doesn’t take these precautions, 
be sure that you don’t save images from the web and use them in ways that 
violate the rights of the person or entity that owns them.
Looking at Photos
Pictures were made to be looked at, so knowing how to view the albums and 
individual photos that you manage to get into your iPad is a way to tap into 
the key strength of the Photos app. In this section, you get some tips for tak­
ing your viewing experience to the max.
	
If you want to do more than look at photos, check out a few of these photo-
editing apps that were designed to work with iPad: Adobe Photoshop Touch, 
Photogene for iPad from Mobile Pond, PhotoForge for iPad from GhostBird 
Software, and the free PhotoPad by ZAGG. All are available through the App 
Store.

Looking at Photos
Viewing an album
The Photos app organizes your pictures into albums using such criteria as 
the folder on your computer from which you synced the photos or photos 
captured using the iPad camera (which are stored in the Recently Added 
album). You may also have albums for images that you synced from devices 
such as your iPhone or digital camera, and collections of your photos by 
year or location.
To view your albums, start by tapping the Photos app on the Home screen. 
Tap the Albums tab shown in Figure 6-2. Now you can tap an album, and the 
photos in it display.
Figure 6-2: Switch between individual photos, photos stored on iCloud, 
and albums using these tabs.
	
If you’re on a Windows PC, check out two products for managing and sync­
ing photos to iPad: Lightroom from Adobe (www.adobe.com) or Adobe’s 
Photoshop Elements (version 8 or later). You can also create picture subfold­
ers in Windows Explorer or the Photo folder hierarchy on a Mac, and when 
you sync, each subfolder becomes an album on your iPad.
Viewing individual photos
After you figure out what album your images are in, you have several fun 
ways to interact with individual photos. The iPad touchscreen is the key to 
this very tactile experience.

238
Looking at Photos
Tap the Photos app on the Home screen and then tap the Photos tab at the 
bottom of the screen (shown in Figure 6-3). Your photos are displayed by cri­
teria, such as the time taken or location.
Figure 6-3: Viewing thumbnails of individual photos.
Now try these techniques:
	
✓	Full-screen view: To view a photo, tap the photo’s thumbnail. You can 
also pinch your fingers together on the photo and then spread your fin­
gers apart. The picture enlarges.
	
✓	Browsing an album: Tap to display an album and then flick your finger 
to the left or right to scroll through the individual photos in that album.
	
✓	Multiple photos: To reduce the display size of an individual photo and 
return to the multipicture view, place two fingers on the photo and then 
pinch them together. You can also tap the Back button (the < icon) in the 
top-left corner (which may display different words depending on where 
you are in a collection of photos) to view the next highest level of photo 
collection.
	
✓	Twirling: Place two fingers on a photo and spin them to the left or right. 
This maneuver, known as grab and spin, twirls the photo on the screen 
and returns you to the folder view (and it’s lots of fun to do).

Editing Photos
	
Do you like to associate a face with a name? Doing so can help you keep your 
clients or other contacts straight. You can place a photo on a person’s infor­
mation page in the Contacts app on your iPad. For more about how to do 
this, see Book V, Chapter 5.
Editing Photos
The Photos app also lets you do some simple editing of your photos, and 
with iOS 8, you have several new editing tools to work with, including smart 
adjustment filters and smart composition tools. Editing features allow you to 
rotate images, enhance image quality, get rid of that pesky red-eye effect, or 
crop to exactly the area of the image that you want to display. You can also 
work with the newly available filters to apply effects to your images.
Follow these steps to edit photos:
	
1.	 Tap the Photos app on the Home screen to open it.
	
2.	 Using methods previously described in this chapter, locate a photo 
that you want to edit.
	
3.	 Tap Edit.
	
	 The Edit Photo screen, shown in Figure 6-4 with Filters displayed, 
appears.
Figure 6-4: Photos provides some simple but useful tools to edit photos.

240
Organizing Photos
	
4.	 At this point, you can take a few possible actions:
	
•	 Enhance: Tap Enchance to turn it on or off. Enhance improves the 
overall “crispness” of the figure with one tap.
	
•	 Crop: To crop the photo to a portion of its original area, tap the Crop 
button. You can then tap any corner of the image and drag inward or 
outward to remove areas of the photo. Tap Crop and then Save to 
apply your changes.
	
•	 Filters: Apply any of nine filters such as Fade, Mono, or Noir to 
change the feel of your image. These effects adjust the brightness of 
your image or apply a black-and-white tone to your color photos. Tap 
the Filters button in the middle of the tools at the bottom of the 
screen and scroll to view available filters. Tap one and then tap 
Apply to apply the effect to your image.
	
•	 Smart Adjustments: Tap Light, Color, or B&W to access a slew of tools 
that you can use to tweak contrast, color intensity, shadows, and 
more.
	
•	 Red Eye: Adjusts those dreaded red-eye effects that are caused by 
reflections of flash in eyes in some photos that include faces.
	
In each of the editing features, you see Cancel, Undo, and Revert to Original 
buttons. If you don’t like the changes you made, use these to stop making 
changes or undo the changes you’ve already made. Choosing Cancel will end 
the editing session, and Revert to Original leaves you in Editing mode.
Organizing Photos
You can organize photos in albums so that you can locate them more easily 
in the future. To do this, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Display an album such as Recently Added.
	
2.	 Tap the Select button in the top-right corner and then tap individual 
photos to select them.
	
	 Small check marks appear on the selected photos (see Figure 6-5).
	
3.	 Tap the Add To button and then tap Add to Album (which appears 
only if you’ve previously created albums) or New Album.
	
4.	 Tap an existing album or enter a name for a new album (depending on 
your previous selection) and tap Save.
	
	 If you created a new album, it appears in the Album screen with the 
other albums.

A

pple has touted the iPad as a great e-reader, so though it isn’t a tradi­
tional dedicated e-reader device like the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, 
you won’t want to miss out on this cool functionality.
Apple’s preinstalled iBooks app is what turns your iPad into an e-reader. 
iBooks is an application that enables you to buy and download 
books from Apple’s iBooks Store and other e-book sources, as 
well as to read PDF files. You can also use several other free 
e-reader apps, for example Kindle or Stanza, to download 
books to your iPad from a variety of online sources, 
such as Amazon and Google, so you can read to your 
heart’s content.
Another preinstalled app, Newsstand, has a similar 
look and feel to iBooks, but its focus is on subscrib­
ing to and reading magazines, newspapers, and 
other periodicals.
In this chapter, you discover the options available for 
reading material, and I tell you how to buy books and 
subscribe to periodicals. You also find out how to navi­
gate a book or periodical and adjust the brightness and type, 
as well as how to search books and organize your iBooks and 
Newsstand libraries.

Discovering How the iPad Differs from Other E-readers
Discovering How the iPad Differs 
from Other E-readers
An e-reader is any electronic device that enables you to download and read 
books, magazines, PDF files, or newspapers, as well as documents such as 
manuals or reports. Some e-readers use E Ink technology to create a paper­
like reading experience. These devices, such as Kindle Paperwhite, are por­
table and typically dedicated only to reading electronic content.
The iPad is a bit different: As you know, it isn’t used for only reading books, 
and it allows you to download other e-reader apps such as Kindle in addition 
to the preinstalled iBooks app. Also, the iPad doesn’t offer the paper-like 
reading experience — you read from a computer screen (though you can 
adjust the brightness of the screen and change its background color).
When you buy a book or magazine online (or get one of many free publications), 
it downloads to your iPad in a few seconds using your Wi-Fi or 3G/4G connection. 
After you have your e-reader app and some content, iPad offers several navigation 
tools to move around an electronic book, all of which you explore in this chapter.
iBooks contains tools for reading and interacting with book content. The 
development of books with interactive content has so far been targeted pri­
marily at the textbook market, and you can even create and publish your 
own interactive textbooks using a Mac app called iBooks Author.
Finding and Buying E-books
Before you can read books or other publications, you have to get your iPad’s 
hands on them (so to speak). This involv0es downloading e-reader software 
and then using it or online stores to buy publications. I start by introducing 
you to iBooks, the e-reader that came preinstalled on your iPad.
	
You can also buy content on your computer and sync your purchases to your 
iPad using iTunes or iCloud. See Book I, Chapter 5 for more about this topic.
Finding books at the iBooks Store
You can shop using Apple’s iBooks Store by tapping the iBooks app on the 
Home screen to open it.
	
If you become addicted to iBooks, consider placing it in the iPad Dock for 
quick access from any Home screen. To do this, tap and hold the app till all 
apps jiggle, and then tap and drag the iBooks app to the Dock. Press the 
Home button, and the jiggling stops.
	
	 The iBooks Library opens (see Figure 7-1). The first time you use it, you see 
a bookshelf with no books on it. (If you don’t see the bookshelf, tap the My

Finding and Buying E-books
Try any of the following methods to find a book:
	
✓	Tap the Search field at the top right of the screen and type a search word 
or phrase using the onscreen keyboard.
	
✓	Tap the Categories button at the upper left of the screen and scroll down 
to browse links to popular categories of books, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-3: Find your publication using Categories.
	
✓	Tap See All on the right side above different categories of books to view 
all titles in a category.
	
✓	Tap the appropriate button at the bottom of the screen to view catego­
ries: The New York Times bestsellers list; books listed on Top Charts; 
and Top Authors.
	
✓	Tap Purchased at the bottom of the screen to see any books you’ve 
bought on devices signed in with the same Apple ID. You can tap the All 
tab to show content from all devices or tap the Not on This iPad tab to 
see only content purchased on other devices.
	
	Scroll to the bottom of many screens to access Quick Links, which 
include shortcuts to Best of the Month, Free Books, and Award Winners.
	
✓	Tap a suggested selection or featured book to display more information 
about it.
	
To avoid buyer’s remorse, you can sometimes download free samples before 
you buy. If the publisher provides a sample, you get to read several pages of

the book to see whether it appeals to you, and it doesn’t cost you a dime! 
Look for the Get Sample button when you view details about a book to get 
your free preview.
Exploring other e-readers
Though iBooks can handle content from many ePub sources, such as Google 
and Project Gutenberg, you may prefer to explore the tools offered by other 
e-readers. Your iPad is capable of using other e-reader apps to display book 
content from other bookstores, so you can get books from sources other 
than iBooks Store. To do so, first download another e-reader application 
such as Kindle from Amazon or the Barnes & Noble Nook from the iPad App 
Store. (See Book I, Chapter 5 for how to download apps.) You can also down­
load a non-vendor-specific app such as Bluefire Reader, which handles ePub 
and PDF format, as well as most formats that public libraries use. Then use 
that application’s features to search for, purchase, and download content.
The Kindle e-reader application is shown in Figure 7-4. After downloading the 
free app from the App Store, you just open the app, go to the Amazon Kindle 
Store and enter the email address associated with your Amazon account and 
password. Any content you have already bought from Amazon for the Kindle 
is archived online and can be downloaded using your Kindle app on your 
iPad for you to read anytime you like. Use features such as changing the 
background to a sepia tone or changing the font to enhance your reading 
experience. Tap the Device tab to see titles stored on your iPad. To delete a 
book from this e-reader, just press the title with your finger, and the Remove 
from Device button appears.
Figure 7-4: Kindle was one of the first free e-reader apps for iPad.

254
Finding and Buying E-books
	
You can also get content from a variety of other sources: Project Gutenberg 
(www.gutenberg.org), Google, some publishers like Baen (www.baen.
com), and so on. Get the content using your computer if you want and then 
just add it to Books in iTunes and sync to your iPad.
	
You can also sync books you’ve downloaded to your computer to your iPad 
by syncing to the computer and your iTunes account. Using this method, 
you can find lots of free books from various sources online, as long as 
they’re in the ePub or PDF format, and drag them into your iTunes Books 
Library; then simply sync them to your iPad. If you have a Mac you can just 
drag the books directly into your connected iPad. See Book I, Chapter 5 for 
more about syncing. You can also download books from the web and use an 
online file-sharing site such as Dropbox to make them available to iBooks via 
an Internet connection, or right-click a title and select Open In to send a 
book to your iPad.
Buying iBooks
If you have set up an account with iTunes, you can buy books at the iBooks 
Store easily using the iBooks app. (See Book I, Chapter 5 for more about 
iTunes.) To buy a book, follow these steps:
	
1.	 When you find a book in the iBooks Store that you want to buy, tap it, 
and then tap its price button, as shown in Figure 7-5.

If you have signed in, your purchase is accepted immediately. No returns are 
allowed, so tap carefully!
	
With Family Sharing, as many as six people can make purchases for iOS 
devices, including e-books, using the same credit card. See Book II, Chapter 1 
for more about setting up Family Sharing.
Experiencing E-reading
After you have an e-book in iBooks, put on some music, settle back in a com­
fortable chair, and read it. Luckily, reading an e-book is just as easy as (or per­
haps easier than) reading a paperback. The next section shows how to do it.

Navigating an e-book
Here are the simple steps involved in making your way around an e-book 
using the iBooks e-reader:
	
1.	 Tap iBooks, and if your Library (the bookshelf) isn’t already dis­
played, tap the My Books button.
	
2.	 Tap an e-book to open it.
	
	 The book opens, as shown in Figure 7-7. Note that if the book is stored 
online, which you can discern by the cloud and down-arrow icon in its 
top-right corner, downloading it to your iPad may take a few moments. 
(If you hold your iPad in portrait orientation, it shows one page; if it’s in 
landscape orientation, it shows two by default.)
Figure 7-7: Landscape orientation on the iPad.
	
3.	 Take any of these actions to navigate the book:
	
•	 To go to the book’s Table of Contents: Tap the Table of Contents but­
ton near the top-left corner of the page (it looks like a little bulleted 
list) to go to the book’s Table of Contents (see Figure 7-8) and then 
tap the name of a chapter to go to that chapter.
	
•	 To turn to the next page: Tap your finger anywhere on the right edge 
of a page.

•	 To turn to the preceding page: Tap your finger anywhere on the left 
edge of a page.
	
•	 To move to another page in the book: Tap and drag the slider at the 
bottom of the page to the right or left.
	
To return to the Library to view another book at any time, tap the Library 
button. If the button isn’t visible, tap anywhere on the page, and the tools 
appear.
Adjusting brightness
iPad doesn’t offer a simulated page surface as some dedicated e-readers 
such as most Kindle e-readers do, so it’s important that you make the read­
ing experience as comfortable on your eyes as possible by adjusting the 
brightness.
iBooks offers an adjustable brightness setting that you can use to make your 
book pages comfortable for you to read. Follow these steps to make an 
adjustment:
	
1.	 With a book open, tap the Display button, which is represented by a 
capital and lowercase A, as shown in Figure 7-9.
	
	 A dialog containing the iBooks Brightness slider and other settings 
appears.

3.	 Tap anywhere in the book to close the Display dialog.
Experiment with the brightness that works for you. It’s commonly thought 
that bright white computer screens are hard on the eyes, so setting the 
brightness to halfway (default) or below or choosing a sepia background is 
probably a good idea. Changing background color is covered in the next task.
Changing the page background 
and font size and type
If the type on your screen is a bit small for your taste, you can change to a 
larger font size or choose a different font for readability. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 With a book open, tap the Display button.
	
	 It sports a small letter a and a large capital A, as shown in Figure 7-11.
Figure 7-11: Need larger type? Set that up here.
	
2.	 In the Display dialog that appears, tap the small letter a button on the 
left to use smaller text, or tap the button labeled with the capital A on 
the right to use larger text.
	
3.	 Tap the Fonts button.
	
	 The list of fonts, as shown in Figure 7-12, appears. This list may vary 
slightly if Apple adds more or you’re using a language other than English 
on your iPad.

Experiencing E-reading
Figure 7-12: Though limited, a selection of fonts is available in iBooks.
	
4.	 Tap a font name to select it.
	
	 The font changes on the book page.
	
5.	 Tap White, Sepia, or Night to choose the theme you want to display.
	
	 If you want to have a sepia tint on the pages or to reverse black and 
white, which can be easier on the eyes, you can change from the default 
White setting to one of these. Turning Auto-Night Theme to On lets your 
iPad determine whether you’re reading in dimmer light and adjust to the 
Night theme accordingly.
	
6.	 Tap outside the Display dialog to return to your book.
	
Some fonts appear a bit larger on your screen than others because of their 
design. If you want the largest font, use Iowan.
	
If you’re reading a PDF file, you’re reading a picture of a document rather 
than an electronic book, so be aware that you can’t modify the page’s 
appearance using the Display dialog.

Using bookmarks and highlights
Bookmarks and highlights in your e-books are like favorites that you may be 
familiar with saving in your web browser: They enable you to revisit a favor­

iPad automatically bookmarks the page where you left off reading in a book, 
so you don’t have to do it manually. A feature called Continuity allows you to 
pick up where you left off on one iOS device, such as the iPad, on another, 
such as your iPhone.
Checking Words in the Dictionary
I know that some people just skip over words they don’t understand when 
reading, but being a writer, I like to know what every word means. If you do, 
too, you’ll appreciate the iPad’s built-in dictionary. As you read a book, if you 
come across unfamiliar words, don’t skip over them — take the opportunity 
to learn a word! The built-in dictionary in iBooks even recognizes many 
proper names, such as historical figures and geographic locations.
Follow these steps to look up a word in the dictionary:
	
1.	 With a book open, press your finger on a word and hold it until the 
menu shown in Figure 7-19 appears.

Deleting Books in Collections
After you download lots of books (I know one person who has 1,000), you 
may become organizationally challenged. iBooks lets you delete books you 
no longer need on your iPad to keep your bookshelf manageable. Remember 
that those books aren’t gone; you can find and download them again anytime 
by using the Purchased tab at the bottom of the Store.
Here are the steps for deleting books from your iPad:
	
1.	 When you finish a book, tap the List view button in the top-left corner 
of the Library.
	
2.	 Swipe to the left on a title in the list.

✓	Challenging friends in Game Center
iPad is, after all, a close relative of the iPhone, and no matter who tells you 
that he uses his iPhone to get work done, he’s probably spending most of his 
time gaming. iPad outstrips iPhone as the ultimate portable gaming machine 
because of its beautiful screen (especially if you have a third-generation or 
later iPad with Retina display) and the ability to rotate the larger screen as 
you play and track your motions. You can download game apps from the App 
Store and play them on your device. You can also use the preinstalled Game 
Center app to help you find and buy games, add friends to play against, and 
track and share scores.
In this chapter, you discover why iPad is such a great mobile gaming device, 
what kinds of games are out there, how to create a Game Center account 
and purchase and download games, how to play games against yourself 
and others, and what cool accessories you must get to be a com­
pletely awesome iPad gamer.
Let the games begin!
Appreciating iPad’s Gaming Strengths
The iPhone is a fun gaming device, but the screen is 
too small. Your computer is a good gaming device, 
but it may lack some of the tactile input of a touch­
screen. iPad may be just right as the ultimate gaming 
device for many reasons, including these:
	
✓	iPad’s fantastic screen: If you have an iPad Air 2 
you have a few things going for you here. First, the high-
resolution, 9.7" screen has a backlit LED display. As Apple 
describes it, it’s “remarkably crisp and vivid.” They’re not lying. 
The In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology means you can hold it at almost 
any angle (it has a 178-degree viewing angle) and still get good color and 
contrast. If you own a third-generation iPad (or later), things get even 

274
Appreciating iPad’s Gaming Strengths
better. These versions of iPad with their Retina displays give you four 
times as many pixels as earlier iPad models (3.1 million, to be exact). 
You get 2048 x 1536 resolution, greater color saturation, and a crisp 
image that rivals many HDTVs.
	
✓	Faster processor: The dual-core A8 chip in your iPad Air 2 is a super-fast 
processor that can run rings around your iPhone, making it a great 
device for gaming. The A8 chip is very speedy and drives the Retina dis­
play without sacrificing the ten-hour battery life iPads are known for. 
With iPad Air 2, the A8X chip offers 2.5x faster graphics than other 
models.
	
✓	A built-in accelerometer and three-axis gyroscope: Gamers will find 
these elements useful to shift around in a more versatile manner as they 
virtually move through games that involve motion. The built-in acceler­
ometer and three-axis gyroscope let you grab your iPad and use it as a 
steering wheel or other game feature, so you really feel as though you’re 
in the action. (With iPad 2, the gyroscope, accelerometer, and compass 
were added to help apps like Maps pinpoint your location and move­
ments as you stroll around town.)
	
✓	M8 coprocessor: This feature provides the ability to sense your move­
ments. This ability is likely to result in some interesting new gaming and 
exercise apps.
	
✓	Playing games in full screen: Rather than play on a small iPhone screen, 
you can play most games designed for the iPad in full-screen mode on 
your iPad. Having a full screen brings the gaming experience to you in a 
more engaging way than a small screen ever could.
	
✓	Dragging elements around the screen: The Multi-Touch iPad screen is 
responsive — and if you’re about to be zapped by aliens in a fight-to-the-
death computer game, that responsiveness counts.
	
✓	The ten-hour battery life of an iPad: This long battery life on every ver­
sion of iPad means you can suck energy out of it playing games into the 
wee hours of the night.
	
✓	Specialized game-playing features: Some games are coming out with 
features that take advantage of iPad’s capabilities. For example, 
Gameloft came out with a version of its N.O.V.A. game that includes a 
feature called multiple-target acquisition, which lets you target multiple 
bad guys in a single move to blow them out of the water with one shot. 
The Need for Speed racing games allow you to look in your rearview mir­
ror to see what’s coming up behind you, a feature made possible by 
iPad’s large screen, compared to an iPhone.
	
✓	Great sound: The built-in stereo speakers in the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 2 
are powerful little things, but if you want things even more up-close and 
personal, you can plug in a headphone, some speaker systems, or a micro­
phone using the built-in jack.

Finding Some Very Cool Games
Finding Some Very Cool Games
Now it’s time to tell you about some of my favorite iPad games (the part of 
the book where you wonder why I get paid for what I do,’cause reviewing 
games is so much fun).
Looking at what’s out there
	
First, take a look at the gaming landscape. Several types of games are avail­
able (some ported over from iPhone and some customized for iPad; price 
noted if not free):
	
✓	Arcade games include apps such as Arcade Bowling (free with in-app 
purchases), Pinball Arcade ($0.99), and Foosball HD ($2.99).
	
✓	Kids’ games are sometimes educational, but almost always entertaining. 
These include Ace Kids Math Games (free), Addition UnderSea 
Adventures (free), and Monkey Word School Adventure ($1.99).
	
✓	Card and board games, such as Astraware Solitaire – 12 Games in 1 by 
Handmark, Inc. ($0.99); Mahjong Deluxe ($0.99); and Payday Roulette 2 
HD ($1.99).
	
✓	Adventure games like Animal vs. Zombies (free), Everest: Hidden 
Expedition (free), AirAttack HD ($0.99), Amazon: Hidden Expedition (free 
with in-app purchases), and Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter ($2,99).
	
✓	Sports games, such as 2XL’s SnoCross ($1.99), Stick Golf HD ($2.99), and 
Pool Bar – Online Hustle ($2.99).
Exploring a half-dozen games
Narrowing down choices to just a few must-have games is hard because 
everyone likes different kinds of fun. To add to the choices, there are both 
iPhone- and iPad-engineered games that you can use on your iPad, and more 
are coming out all the time. If you have a third-generation (or later) iPad, you 
might want to look for games that are optimized for the new Retina display.
Understanding the accelerometer
The iPad has a built-in motion sensor called 
an accelerometer, as well as a three-axis 
gyroscope. These allow designers developing 
apps for iPad to have lots of fun as they use the 
automatically rotating screen to become part 
of the gaming experience. For example, they 
can build in a compass device that reorients 
itself automatically if you switch your iPad 
from landscape to portrait mode. Some racing 
games allow you to grab the iPad as if it were a 
steering wheel and rotate the device to simu­
late the driving experience.

276
Finding Some Very Cool Games
Still, the following list is a sampling of six recommended games for you to try 
that won’t break the bank:
	
✓	Scrabble for iPad ($9.99): You remember Scrabble, that favorite old 
board game that can let you shine or put you to shame for your spelling 
and vocabulary skills? Scrabble is available on iPad, and it’s hot (see 
Figure 8-1). Shake your iPad to shuffle tiles. Use the drag-and-drop 
motion to play your letters. Want to share the fun? Reach out to your 
Facebook friends to take the game to the multiplayer level.
	
✓	Broken Sword – The Smoking Mirror ($0.99): This classic adventure 
game lets you virtually become the main character to experience all the 
game has to offer. Great art and animation distinguish this game, and the 
iPad version (see its description in the Game Center Store and see 
Figure 8-2) has a handy hint system that you’ll appreciate.
	
✓	Civilization Revolution for iPad ($6.99): If you like a world-building 
type of game, you’ll find Civilization Revolution right up your alley. It has 
been fine-tuned for iPad to be even better than the iPhone version. The 
game also offers a feature called Scenario Creator, which lets you create 
your own unique challenges, essentially allowing for unlimited variety in 
the game.
Figure 8-1: Scrabble is awesome on the iPad.
	
✓	Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck’s Revenge for iPad ($4.99): 
A point-and-click adventure game classic on iPhone, in its iPad incarna­
tion, Monkey Island has great graphics and sound, and an engaging story 
at its heart. If you like adventure games, don’t miss this one.

✓	Minecraft Pocket Edition ($6.99): Minecraft is a wildly popular game 
that involves a virtual reality in which you build things with blocks (see 
Figure 8-3). But these aren’t Tinkertoys — with Minecraft, people are 
building entire cities, engineering feats, and alternative realities.
	
✓	t Chess Pro ($7.99): You can play against the computer or another 
player. You can modify the appearance of the chess pieces. It even 
sports features that help chess beginners learn the game painlessly, but 
more advanced players will enjoy it as well.
Figure 8-2: Broken Sword is a classic game updated from its iPhone version for iPad.
	
As well as costing money, games take up a lot of memory, so choose the 
games you buy wisely. If you no longer want to play a game, delete it from 
your iPad to save space.
	
Special mention: ComicBookLover (free) isn’t a game, but it’s a blast of an 
app that most gamers can appreciate. The iPad screen is perfect for those 
bright, crisp graphics, and iPad’s navigation tools let you swipe your way 
through the panes in several interesting ways. This app uses CBR and CBZ

files, which are available from various online sources. You can even scan 
your own comic books and graphic novels and use them with this app.
Figure 8-3: Minecraft is a very creative world to explore and build.
Getting Gaming Accessories
Some interesting accessories are coming out for iPad. No doubt more will 
appear over time, and Apple itself may add features or gaming accessories in 
a next-edition device. For example, for a future iPad, Apple or somebody else 
might offer an external control accessory so that you don’t have to cover up 
your onscreen game to use onscreen control mechanisms, and Apple might 
add a feature to simulate gaming sounds.
For now, here are a couple of iPad gaming accessories that caught my 
attention:
	
✓	Incipio iPad Hive Honeycomb dermaShot Silicone Case ($39.99) is a 
rugged case for serious gamers. The back sports molded grips that help 
you keep a good hold on your iPad while playing those action-packed 
games.
	
✓	JoyStick-It (around $5) from ThinkGeek is an arcade-style stick you 
attach to your iPad screen. The joystick, available on Amazon.com, 
won’t harm your screen, and you can move it around at any time. It gives 
you that real arcade-game feel for controlling games. It won’t work with 
every game but does claim to work with thousands of them.

Playing through the Game Center
The Game Center is an app that comes preinstalled with iPad. If you’re into 
gaming, you may enjoy the features it offers that allow you to challenge 
friends to beat your scores; buy games; and keep track of your games, 
friends, and achievements.
Of course, you can also download games from the App Store or play online 
games and play them on your iPad without having to use Game Center. What 
Game Center provides is a place where you can create a gaming profile, add 
a list of gaming friends, keep track of and share your scores and perks, and 
shop for games (and only games) in the App Store, along with listings of top-
rated games and game categories to choose from.
Think of the Game Center as a kind of social networking site for gamers, 
where you can compare your scores and find players to challenge. The 
Achievements listing shows you your score history for all the games you 
play. Finally, Leaderboards allows you to compare your performance with 
your gaming friends.
Figure 8-4 shows you the Game Center interface with the following five 
choices along the bottom:
	
✓	Me: Contains your profile and summary of number of friends, games, 
and achievements.
Figure 8-4: Game Center’s opening screen shows an overview of your 
friends, games, and achievements.

Opening an account in Game Center
Using the Game Center app, you can search for and buy games, add friends 
with whom you can play those games, and keep records of your scores for 
posterity. In order to do this, however, you must first open a Game Center 
account by following these steps:
	
1.	 From the Home screen, tap the Game Center icon.
	
	 If you’ve never used Game Center, you’re asked whether to allow push 
notifications: If you want to receive these notices alerting you that your 
friends want to play a game with you, tap OK. You should, however, be 
aware that push notifications can drain your iPad’s battery more quickly.
	
2.	 On the Game Center opening screen (see Figure 8-5), sign in.
	
	 If you want to use Game Center with another Apple ID, tap Create New 
Apple ID and follow the onscreen instructions, which ask you to enter 
your birth date, agree to terms, choose a security question, and so forth; 
or enter your current account information and tap Go.
	
	 The screen that appears after you’ve signed in shows games you’ve 
downloaded, requests from other players, friends, and so on (see 
Figure 8-6).
Figure 8-5: Sign in to Game Center here.
	
3.	 Tap any of the floating balloons to get to these categories or tap a 
­button along the bottom of the screen.

	 When you first register for Game Center, if you use an email address 
other than the one associated with your Apple ID, you may have to cre­
ate a new Apple ID and verify it by responding to an email message 
that’s sent to your email address.
Figure 8-6: Tap a balloon to get to a category.
Creating a Game Center profile
When you have an account with which you can sign into Game Center, you’re 
ready to specify some account settings. To create your Game Center profile, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 On the Home screen, tap Settings.
	
2.	 Tap Game Center, and in the settings that appear (see Figure 8-7), if 
you don’t want other players to be able to invite you to play games 
when Game Center is open, tap the Allow Invites Off/On switch to 
turn off this feature.
	
	 If you want your friends to be able to send you requests for playing games 
via email, check to see whether the primary email address listed here is the 
one you want them to use. If the primary email address is the one you want 
to use, skip to Step 5.
	
3.	 If you want to change the email address listed, tap the current Apple 
ID and, in the settings that appear, tap Sign Out.
	
4.	 On the screen that next appears, tap in the Apple ID field and enter 
another account.
	
	 Or tap Create a New Apple ID.

282
Playing through the Game Center
	
5.	 Tap to Allow Invites or to allow Nearby Players to find you and invite 
you to games. (see Figure 8-7.)
	
6.	 If you want others to see your profile, including your real name, scroll 
down and tap the current profile and then tap the Public Profile On/
Off switch to turn on the public profile.
	
7.	 Tap Done; then press the Home button when you’re finished with set­
tings and tap Game Center.
	
	 You return to the Game Center Home screen, already signed in to your 
account with information displayed about friends, games, and gaming 
achievements (all at zero, initially).
Figure 8-7: When you’re playing games with others, your handle 
identifies you.
	
After you create an account and a profile, whenever you go to the Game 
Center, you log in by entering your email address and password and then 
tapping Sign In.
Adding friends
If you want to play Game Center games with others who have an Apple ID 
and an iPhone, iPod touch, Mac with Mountain Lion or later, or iPad, follow 
these steps to add them as friends so that you can invite them to play:
	
1.	 From the Game Center Home screen, tap the Friends button at the bot­
tom of the screen.

283
Book II 
Chapter 8

Playing through the Game Center
	
2.	 On the Friends page, tap the Add Friends button in the top (shaped 
like a plus sign).
	
3.	 Enter an email address in the To field and edit the invitation, if you 
like.
	
4.	 Tap the Send button.
	
	 After your friend accepts your invitation, her name is listed on the 
Friends screen.
	
Game Center includes the Friend Recommendations feature. Go to the 
Friends tab and then tap the A–Z button in the top-left corner. A Recommen­
dations section appears above the list of your current friends. These are 
people who play the same or similar games, so if you like, try adding one or 
two as friends. You can go to the Points tab to view the points these folks 
have accumulated so that you can stay in your league.
	
You will probably also receive requests from friends who know you’re on 
Game Center. When you get these email invitations, be sure that you know 
the person sending it before you accept it — especially if you’ve allowed 
email access in your account settings. If you don’t double-check, you could 
be allowing a potentially abusive stranger into your gaming world.
Purchasing and downloading games
Time to get some games to play! Remember that you can buy any game app 
from the App Store and simply play it by tapping to open it on your iPad. But 
if you want to use Game Center to buy games, here are the steps involved:
	
1.	 Open Game Center and sign in to your account.
	
2.	 Tap the Games button at the bottom of the screen and, under the 
Recommended category, tap Show More.
	
3.	 In the list of games that appears, scroll through the list of featured 
games and tap one that appeals to you.
	
4.	 Tap the Price/Free App button to display details about the game.
	
	 Note that you can tap the Store button from here to go to the iTunes 
store to view more games.
	
	 Accessing apps from the Game Center displays only game apps, as 
opposed to accessing apps from the App Store, which shows you all cat­
egories of apps.
	
5.	 To buy a game, tap the button labeled with either the words Free App 
or the price, such as $1.99.
	
6.	 In the detailed app page that appears (see Figure 8-8), tap the button 
again and then tap the Buy or Install button.

284

Figure 8-8: Tap to buy a game.
	
7.	 Enter your Apple ID and password in the dialog that appears and then 
tap OK.
	
	 Another verification dialog appears, asking you to sign in.
	
8.	 Follow the instructions on the next couple of screens to enter your 
password and verify your payment information if this is the first time 
you’ve signed in to your account from this device.
	
9.	 When the verification dialog appears, tap Buy or Install (for a free 
game).
	
	 The game downloads.
	
If you’ve added friends to your account (see the preceding section), you can 
go to the Friends page and view games that your friends have downloaded. 
To purchase one of these games, just tap it in your friend’s list.
Playing against yourself
Many games allow you to play all on your own. Each game has different rules 
and goals, so you have to study a game’s instructions and learn how to play 
it, but here’s some general information about these types of games:

285
Book II

Playing Games
Playing through the Game Center
	
✓	Often a game can be played in two modes: with others or in a solitaire 
version, where you play yourself or the computer.
	
✓	Many games that you may be familiar with in the offline world, such as 
Carcassonne or Scrabble, have online versions. For these, you already 
know the rules of play, so you simply need to figure out the execution. 
For example, in the online Carcassonne game, you tap to place a tile on 
the board, tap the placed tile to rotate it, and tap the check mark to com­
plete your turn and reveal another tile.
	
✓	All the games you play on your own record your scores in Game Center 
so that you can track your progress.
Challenging friends in Game Center
After you’ve added a friend and both of you have downloaded the same 
game, you can challenge her to beat your scores:
	
1.	 Tap the Game Center app icon on the Home screen and sign in, if 
necessary.
	
2.	 Tap Me; and then tap the Games bubble.
	
3.	 Tap one of your scores.
	
4.	 In the dialog that appears, tap the Challenge bubble (see Figure 8-9).
Figure 8-9: Keep challenging friends to widen your gaming universe.

286
Playing through the Game Center
	
5.	 Tap a friend in the dialog that appears and then tap Next.
	
6.	 In the form that appears, enter a message, if you like, and then tap 
Send.
	
	 Game Center tracks your achievements, including points and perks that 
you’ve earned along the way. You can also compare your gaming achieve­
ments to those of top-ranking players across the Internet — and check 
your friends’ scores by displaying the Friends page with the Points por­
tion showing.
	
If your friends aren’t available, you can play a game by tapping its title on 
the Games page and then tapping Play. You can then compare your scores 
with others around the world who have also played the game recently.

Chapter 1: Configuring Your iPad 
to Connect Everywhere
In This Chapter
✓	Making Wi-Fi and 3G/4G settings
✓	Tethering your iPad to your smartphone
✓	Setting up a Microsoft Exchange account
T

his chapter is all about connecting, whether you’re connecting to the 
Internet via Wi-Fi, 3G, or 4G (not available on the original iPad or iPad 2) 
or connecting to your company network. Apple has made an effort over the 
years with iPhone to support enterprises, meaning that you can use the 
phone to connect with your company network and vital work data. The iPad 
continues that tradition with support for Microsoft Exchange Server, virtual 
private networks (VPNs), and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 
accounts.
Your best ally in setting up the more technical of these is your network 
administrator. In this chapter, I give you an overview of the capa­
bilities of iPad to connect and some guidance in making the 
settings you need to make.
Making Wi-Fi and 3G/4G Settings
The way people with iPads can connect to the 
Internet, the grandmother of all networks, is via its 
Wi-Fi or 3G/4G capabilities (assuming that you have 
a 3G or 4G model).
The third-generation (and later) iPad and the iPad 
mini offer Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi and 3G/4G, which gives 
you the ability to connect to a super-fast 4G LTE network; 
if a 4G network isn’t available (and they aren’t yet in many 
areas), your 4G iPad can still access several types of 3G net­
works including GSM/UMTS networks around the world.
In this section, I go into the settings you can make to manage your Wi-Fi or 
3G/4G connection.

290
Making Wi-Fi and 3G/4G Settings
Making Wi-Fi settings
Book I, Chapter 5 gives you the information you need to connect to a Wi-Fi 
network, a matter of simply signing in to the network, with a password, if 
necessary. Now it’s time to go over some of the finer points of your Wi-Fi 
connection.
A basic Wi-Fi setting tells iPad to automatically search for and join networks 
that are in range. If several networks are in range, using this setting, iPad 
joins the one that it used most recently.
After iPad has joined a network, a little Wi-Fi icon appears in the status bar. 
The number of dots indicates the strength of the signal, just as you’re used 
to seeing on your cellphone.
To get to Wi-Fi settings, tap Settings on your Home screen and then tap Wi-Fi 
(see Figure 1-1).
Figure 1-1: Wi-Fi settings.
Here’s a rundown of the items you can work with in Settings for your Wi-Fi 
configuration:
	
✓	Wi-Fi On/Off: Simply tap this switch to On to turn on Wi-Fi. If you want it 
off, perhaps to avoid battery drain or because you’re on an airplane and 
the pilot tells you to, set this to Off. (Note that iPads also have an 
Airplane Mode setting, which I discuss in the next section.)
	
✓	The network you’re currently connected to: The current connection is 
listed. Tap it to change any settings for it or to disconnect.

291

Making Wi-Fi and 3G/4G Settings
	
✓	Other: If you want to join a network that doesn’t appear on the list, tap 
Other under the Choose a Network section of these settings. In the dia­
log that appears, enter the network name and choose a type of security, 
such as WEP or WPA. When you choose a form of security and return to 
the dialog shown in Figure 1-2, the Password field appears. Some net­
works might need other information, such as a username or static IP 
address, to complete this dialog. Check with your administrator for any 
information you can’t provide.
Figure 1-2: Accessing a closed network.
	
✓	Ask to Join Networks: iPad automatically connects to the previously 
joined network. With this setting on, an alert will appear asking if you 
want to join other networks that you come in range of. Tap this switch to 
the On position, and iPad displays all possible network connections. If 
a network requires a password, it sports a padlock symbol. If no known 
networks are available, you’re asked whether you want to join unknown 
networks. To forget a network so that iPad doesn’t join it automatically, 
tap the Information icon on the right of the network name and then tap 
Forget This Network.
	
To adjust settings for individual Wi-Fi networks, tap the Information icon to 
the right of a listed network.
	
You can set up Home Sharing to share music and video content from your 
Mac or PC with your iPad if they are on the same network and have the same 
Home Sharing ID as your iPad. See Book V, Chapter 1 for more about Home 
Sharing.

292
Making Wi-Fi and 3G/4G Settings
Making 3G/4G settings
When you own a Wi-Fi+Cellular model of iPad, in addition to modifying Wi-Fi 
settings as covered in the preceding section, you can make changes to your 
cellular data in Settings. Cellular Data settings enable you to manage data 
roaming and your account information (see Figure 1-3). You can use these 
settings to sign up for a data plan by entering your name, phone number, 
and credit card information; when you submit this information, your account 
is set up with your provider with a unique phone number associated with 
the account. You need this phone number to speak to customer representa­
tives about your account.
You can find the following items under the Cellular Data category in Settings:
	
✓	Cellular Data: Turn 3G/4G on or off here.
	
✓	Enable LTE: To enable your iPad to search for and connect to LTE net­
works, turn on this setting. Data may load faster using LTE, but remem­
ber that downloading still takes a toll on your battery life.
	
✓	Data Roaming: Data Roaming is a feature of cellular networks that takes 
advantage of other carriers’ networks, if you’re out of range of your pri­
mary carrier’s network. Using data roaming can result in additional 
charges, so you may want to turn it off when you don’t need it.
	
✓	View Account: Tap this setting to view account information.
	
✓	Add a SIM PIN: You may want to protect the data on your SIM card from 
prying eyes. Beyond setting a password to unlock your iPad, you can 
assign a PIN to your SIM card here. When you’ve assigned a PIN, when­
ever you try to use a new SIM card or restart your Wi-Fi or 3G/4G iPad, 
you have to enter the password. Don’t forget your PIN, though, or you 
can’t unlock your SIM card.
With any Wi-Fi and 3G/4G model iPad, you also have access to the Airplane 
Mode setting in both the Settings and Control Center. This setting allows 
you to disable wireless features of your device as required by airline regu­
lations when you’re on an airline flight. With Airplane Mode turned on, you 
won’t be able to browse, email, sync, buy stuff online, or stream videos 
(which you would only be able to do with a 3G/4G model a few miles up in 
the sky) unless the airline provides Wi-Fi. If it does, you can use the Wi-Fi 
only setting in the Control panel to enable this, but do turn it off before 
takeoff and landing. Also, the GPS locator of Maps won’t work, but you can 
play content that you’ve downloaded, play games, and create documents 
in apps like Pages and Numbers. Just don’t forget to turn off the Airplane 
Mode setting when you land!

If you want to connect your Wi-Fi–only iPad to your smartphone to go online 
when out of range of a Wi-Fi network, you can tether the iPad to the phone 
using Verizon’s, T-Mobile’s, or Sprint’s Personal Hotspot or AT&T’s iPhone 
3G/4G Tethering. Tethering with any of these services allows your iPad to tap 
into your phone’s data connection to go online. You can get a connection 
anywhere your phone gets a connection — even if you have a Wi-Fi–only 
iPad model.
Tethering involves a few challenges. You don’t go online instantly because 
you have to complete a few steps first, the connection speed might be a tad 
slow, and it can drain your phone battery quickly.
After you’re comfortable with the trade-offs of the tethering option, you need 
to do two things:
	
1.	 Add the tethering option for your carrier on the carrier’s website by 
logging in to your account and adding the feature.
	
	 This can come with a cost; for example, with AT&T you might pay for 
tethering support (based on GB of usage) anywhere from $50 to $100 at 
the time of this writing.
	
2.	 Make the setting on your iPad turn on the tethering service feature by 
doing the following:
	
a.	 Tap the Settings icon.
	
b.	 Tap Wi-Fi.
	
c.	 Tap the tethering service in the Choose a Network section and make 
settings specific to your carrier.
	
Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon pricing and features for iPad Air 2/mini 
3 vary. For example, Verizon offers an individual plan at $45 a month and a 
family plan called More Everything for up to 4 lines for $140. AT&T offers 
3GB of data for $30 a month and 40GB of data for a family for $150. You need 
both a basic data plan and a tethering feature plan which could cost an 
additional $50, which can add up. Still, if you often wander into areas that 
have no Wi-Fi and you don’t have a 3G or 4G iPad, it may — or may not — be 
more cost effective to use this feature.
Connecting to an Enterprise
Microsoft Exchange support opens possibilities for connecting with an enter­
prise network and its data remotely. If you work at a company using Microsoft 
Exchange and use an iPad, this is very good news.

294
Connecting to an Enterprise
Thanks to these enterprise features, here are some of the things you can do 
to connect to your organization’s network and data.
Setting up a configuration profile
Microsoft Exchange is a messaging standard that allows the exchange of 
information between networks. With a configuration profile in place, you can 
set up a Microsoft Exchange account on your iPad. A configuration profile is a 
way for the network administrator at your enterprise to set up your iPad to 
use the systems in your company, via Microsoft Exchange or a VPN (virtual 
private network), which controls access to corporate email or contacts.
Your administrator should check out the Enterprise Deployment Guide and 
the iPad Configurator utility from Apple (www.apple.com/support/ipad/
enterprise) to set up a configuration profile. After a configuration profile 
is in place, it can be emailed to you or placed on a secure web page. Alter­
natively, your company’s network administrator can install a configuration 
profile on your iPad for you.
When you receive a configuration profile, you can install it yourself by open­
ing the message and tapping the file. Tap Install and enter any information 
that’s requested, such as your password.
Setting up a Microsoft Exchange account
Many companies use Microsoft Exchange to exchange their email, contacts, 
and calendar information with devices. iPhone has supported Microsoft 
Exchange for a while now, and iPad carries on the tradition. You can use 
Microsoft Exchange to wirelessly sync that information to your iPad from 
your corporate network.
	
One benefit of a connection with Microsoft Exchange is that your IT adminis­
trator can wipe the data and settings off a device remotely by using a com­
mand in Exchange if it’s lost or stolen, keeping those confidential business 
contacts private. Another option for erasing content on a lost device is to 
use iCloud’s Find My iPad feature, covered in more detail in Book I, 
Chapter 9.
To set up Microsoft Exchange, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings.
	
2.	 Tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
	
3.	 Tap Add Account.
	
4.	 Tap Exchange.

5.	 Enter your account information in the dialog shown in Figure 1-3 
(email address, password, and a description) and then tap Next.
	
	 The iPad then uses Microsoft’s Autodiscover feature to verify your 
Exchange server.
Figure 1-3: Exchange settings.
	
6.	 If your iPad can verify your information, tap Save and you’re all set.
	
	 If it can’t, you may have entered incorrect information. Check with your 
network administrator to get the info you need.
	
When you’re setting up a Microsoft Exchange account, you can choose 
which items you want to sync with, including your email, contacts, or calen­
dar. You get choices for how existing data on your iPad is handled (merged, 
kept in a separate account, or overwritten).
Setting up an LDAP account
You can also set up a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) account. 
LDAP accounts allow you to search for contacts on an LDAP server, which 
many organizations use to store data, and access them through iPad 
Contacts.
Here’s how to set up an LDAP account on your iPad:
	
1.	 In Settings, tap Mail, Contacts, Calendars.
	
2.	 Tap Add Account.
	
3.	 Tap Other.
	
4.	 Tap Add LDAP Account.

296
Connecting to an Enterprise
	
5.	 Enter your LDAP account information (see Figure 1-4) and then tap 
Next to verify the account.
	
6.	 Tap Save.
Figure 1-4: The LDAP settings.
When you’ve set up this type of account, contacts imported from the 
account appear as a group in the iPad Contacts app as with any group. To 
see these contacts, your iPad has to be connected to the Internet because 
they aren’t stored locally (meaning that they’re stored on your company’s 
servers). If necessary, check with your company’s network administrator for 
information about your network and LDAP requirements.
Setting up a virtual private network
If you want to be able to connect to your organization’s network, you may be 
able to use a virtual private network, or VPN. A VPN, which works over both 
Wi-Fi and 3G/4G cellular data connections, allows you to access data securely 
whether you’re using a network outside your company — such as at home or 
in a café — to access the servers inside your company’s network. After a VPN 
is set up at your company, you can use VPN settings on your iPad to connect 
to your company network.

297

You might need to ask your network administrator for information on how to 
make settings for accessing a VPN. If you’ve set up VPN on your computer, 
you should be able to use the same VPN settings on your iPad. You might 
want to let your admin know that iPad can connect to VPNs that use the 
L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSec protocol.
To add a new VPN configuration, go to Settings and tap General➪VPN➪Add 
VPN Configuration. The settings shown in Figure 1-5 appear. Fill in the infor­
mation requested and tap Save.
Figure 1-5: The Add Configuration settings.
You can have multiple VPNs set up, for example if you consult with several 
companies with their own VPNs. Tap the one you want to use, and then set 
the VPN switch to On. To switch VPNs, disconnect from one, select the new 
one, and then turn VPN back on. Only one VPN can be active at any time. To 
delete a VPN configuration, tap the blue arrow to the right of the configura­
tion name in the General settings and then tap Delete VPN.
	
Have your administrator check out third-party tools that help to enable the 
use of the corporate network by remote iPad users. Good for Enterprise 
helps a user manage and update smartphone-like standards if that person’s 
company has no single standard. Array Networks provides the iPad app 
Desktop Direct – My Desktops that, along with Citrix Receiver software, 
helps users access their desktop from afar.

Y

ou may have used a maps app on a smartphone before. The big differ­
ence with the iPad is its large screen, on which you can view all the 
beautiful map visuals, traffic flow, and streets in standard views and even 3D 
as long as you have an Internet connection. You can also display a map and 
written directions simultaneously or have Maps speak your directions, guid­
ing you as you drive with your 3G/4G iPad.
You will find lots of great functions in the Maps app, including 
getting directions with suggested alternative routes from one 
place to another by foot or car. You can bookmark loca­
tions to return to them again. And the Maps app makes 
it possible to get information about locations, such as 
the phone numbers and web links to businesses. You 
can even add a location to your Contacts list or 
share a location with your buddy using Mail, 
Message, Twitter, or Facebook.
Be prepared: This app is a fun way to find your way 
in the world.
Getting Where You’re Going
The first duty of a map is to get you where you want to go. The 
Maps app can go directly to wherever you are or to any other location 
you wish to visit. You can also use tools that help you find different views of 
locales by displaying streets, terrain, or aerial views or zooming in and out 
for various levels of detail. In this section, you find out how to use Maps to 
get around.

300
Getting Where You’re Going
Going to your current location
The iPad is pretty smart; it can figure out where you are at any point in time and 
display your current location using GPS technology (with a 3G/4G model) or a 
triangulation method (Wi-Fi model). You must have an Internet connection and 
turn Location Services on in the Privacy pane in Settings; your location can be 
pinpointed more exactly if you have a 3G or 4G iPad, but even Wi-Fi models do a 
pretty good job, and they do even better when you’re surrounded by hotspots.
To display your current location in Maps, follow these steps:
	
1.	 From the Home screen, tap the Maps icon.
	
2.	 Tap the Current Location icon (the arrow shown in the lower-left cor­
ner of Figure 2-1).
	
	 Your current location is displayed with a pin in it and a pulsating blue 
circle around it (see Figure 2-1). The circle indicates how accurate the 
location is — it could actually be anywhere within the area of the circle.
Figure 2-1: Go to your current location quickly to see where you are.
	
	 Having trouble getting Maps to work? That could be because if you turn 
off Location Services in Settings, Maps can’t find you. Go to Settings and 
in the Privacy setting, make sure that Location Services is set to On for 
the Maps app.
	
3.	 Double-tap the screen to zoom in on your location.
	
	 Additional methods of zooming in and out are covered in the “Zooming 
in and out” section, later in this chapter.

301
Book III 
Chapter 2

Getting Where You’re Going
	
If you don’t have a 3G/4G version of iPad, your current location is a rough 
estimate based on a triangulation method. Only 3G- and 4G-enabled iPads 
with GPS can really pinpoint your location. Still, if you type a starting loca­
tion and an ending location to get directions, you can get pretty accurate 
results even with a Wi-Fi–only iPad.
Changing views
The Maps app offers three views: Standard, Satellite, and Hybrid. You see the 
Standard view by default the first time you open Maps. Here’s what these 
views offer:
	
✓	Standard: Your basic street map that you might find in any road atlas
	
✓	Satellite: An aerial view
	
✓	Hybrid: A satellite view with street names included
	
Another cool app for those who like their maps of the topographical variety 
is Topo Maps for iPad from Phil Endecott ($7.99). This app taps into the 
United States Geological Society (USGS) and Canadian topographical maps 
and is great for planning that next trek into the wilderness.
Follow these steps to switch among the views in Maps:
	
1.	 With Maps open, tap the Information button in the bottom-right corner 
of the screen and reveal the Maps popover, shown in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: The controls for Maps are displayed when you tap the 
Information button.

2.	 Tap the Satellite option.
	
	 The Satellite view, shown in Figure 2-3, appears.
Figure 2-3: Using Satellite view, you look at a location from the sky.
	
3.	 Tap to reveal the menu again and tap Hybrid, as shown in Figure 2-4.
	
	 Doing this displays a Satellite view with street names superimposed.
Figure 2-4: Street names and highway numbers appear in Hybrid view.

4.	 Tap the Show 3D Map button in the Maps popover.
	
	 A 3D effect is applied to whatever view is displayed (see Figure 2-5).
Figure 2-5: 3D seems to rotate and slant the map before your eyes.
	
You can drop a pin to mark a location on a map that you can return to. See 
the “Dropping a pin” section, later in this chapter, for more about this feature.
You can also turn on a feature that displays an overlay on the Standard map 
to show current traffic conditions. (The Show Traffic setting is shown earlier 
in Figure 2-2.) This feature works best in major metropolitan areas and dis­
plays red dashes on roads indicating accidents or road closures, and orange 
dashes to indicate traffic slowdowns to help you navigate your rush-hour 
commute or trip to the mall.
	
To print any displayed map to an AirPrint-compatible printer, just tap Share 
in the top-right corner and then tap the Print button.
Zooming in and out
If you’ve used an online mapping program, you know that you frequently 
have to move to more or less detailed views of the map to find what you’re 
looking for: The street detail doesn’t show the nearest highway, and the 
region level doesn’t let you see that all-important next turn. You’ll appreciate 
the feature in the Maps app that allows you to zoom in and out to see more 
or less detailed maps and to move around a map.

304
Getting Where You’re Going
You can use the following methods on a displayed map to zoom in and out 
and move around a map:
	
✓	Double-tap with a single finger to zoom in and reveal more detail.
	
✓	Double-tap with two fingers to zoom out and reveal less detail.
	
✓	Place two fingers together on the screen and move them apart to 
zoom in.
	
✓	Place two fingers apart on the screen and pinch them together to 
zoom out.
	
✓	Press your finger to the screen and drag the map in any direction to 
move to an adjacent area.
	
It can take a few moments for the map to redraw itself when you enlarge, 
reduce, or move around it, so have a little patience. An area that’s being 
redrawn will look like a blank grid but will fill in, in time. Also, if you’re in 
Satellite or Hybrid view, zooming in may take some time; wait it out because 
the blurred image will resolve itself.
Going to another location
If you’re at Point A and want to get to Point B — Calcutta, Des Moines, or 
wherever — you need to know how to find any location other than your cur­
rent location using Maps. Doing this involves entering as much information 
as you have about the location’s address in the Search field.
Try going to another location using these steps:
	
1.	 With Maps open, tap in the Search field.
	
	 If you don’t see the Search field in the upper-right corner, you may have 
to tap the Clear button.
	
	 The keyboard opens (as shown in Figure 2-6).
	
2.	 Type a location, using a street address with city and state, a stored 
contact name, or a destination, such as Empire State Building or 
Detroit airport.
	
	 Maps may make suggestions as you type if it finds any logical matches.
	
	 Tap the Dictation key (not available on iPad 2) on the onscreen keyboard 
(refer to Figure 2-6) and speak a location to iPad if you prefer. Tap in the 
Search field and then tap the Dictation key and say the location; tap the Dic­
tation key or in the Search field again and what you’ve spoken appears there.
	
	 Double-tap the Home button and ask Siri (third-generation iPad or later) 
for a type of business or location by zip code. For example, if you crave 
something with pepperoni, say “Find pizza in 99208 zip code.” The results 
typically display a small map that you can tap to open the Maps app to 
find your way there. See Book V, Chapter 6 for more about using Siri.

see in Figure 2-7.
	
Add the city and state, if you know them, whenever you enter a destination. 
A search for Bronx Zoo landed me in the Woodland Park Zoo in Tacoma, 
Washington, because the search uses the individual words and the closest 
geographical location for a Zoo match to find results!
Remembering Where You’ve Been
Why reinvent the (mapping) wheel? One of the great capabilities of a map­
ping program is the ability to store locations you like to go to for future refer­
ence. In Maps, you can do this in a few ways. You can drop a pin on a map, 
which marks a beginning point for getting directions from one site to 
another. Or you can place a bookmark for a site you want to revisit often. 
You then access your bookmarks by tapping Recents in the Search field; tap 
Favorites to see your bookmarks.
Dropping a pin
With the iPad, pins act like the pins you might place on a paper map to note 
routes or favorite locations. Also, pins are markers: A green pin marks a start 
location; a red pin marks search results; a pin you that drop yourself appears 
in a lovely purple; and a blue pin (referred to as the blue marker) marks your 
iPad’s current location.
Use these steps to try the pin feature of iPad:
	
1.	 Display a map that contains a spot where you want to drop a pin to 
help you get directions to or from that site.
	
	 If necessary, you can zoom in to a more detailed map to get a better view 
of the location you want to pin using the techniques I cover in the earlier 
“Zooming in and out” section.
	
2.	 Press and hold your finger on the screen at the location where you 
want to place the pin.
	
	 The pin appears, together with an information bar (shown in Figure 2-8).

If a site has associated reviews on Yelp, you see a More Info on Yelp button 
in its Information dialog. Tap this button to install the Yelp app and read the 
reviews. If you like the destination, add it to your contacts to find it easily in 
the future.
Adding and viewing a favorite
Favorites are a tried-and-true way to save a destination so that you can dis­
play a map or directions to that spot quickly. You’ve probably used a similar 
bookmark feature in a web browser. With Maps, you can save favorites and 
access those locations from the search field.
Here’s how to add a favorite in Maps:
	
1.	 Place a pin on a location, as described in the preceding section.
	
2.	 Tap the Information bar to display the Information dialog.
	
3.	 Tap the Share button. (See Figure 2-10.)
Figure 2-10: Click here to add a favorite.
	
4.	 Tap Add to Favorites.
	
	 The Add to Favorites dialog and the keyboard appear (as shown in

a location to return to it.
Deleting a favorite
Eventually, a site you used to visit gets crossed off your A list. At that point, 
you might want to delete a bookmarked favorite, which you can easily do by 
following these steps:
	
1.	 Tap the Search field, enter a location, and then tap Favorites.
	
2.	 Tap the Edit button.
	
	 A red minus icon appears to the left of your bookmarks, as shown in 
Figure 2-13.

4.	 Tap Delete.
	
	 The bookmark is removed.
	
To use a touchscreen shortcut after you’ve displayed the bookmarks in 
Step 1, simply swipe across a bookmark and then tap the Delete button that 
appears.
	
You can also clear all recent locations stored by Maps to give yourself a 
clean slate. Tap the Bookmark icon and then tap the Recents tab. Tap Clear 
and then confirm by tapping Clear All Recents.

Getting Directions, Information, and More
Getting Directions, Information, and More
Maps can provide all kinds of information, from directions from one location 
to another to the street address and phone number for a particular business 
or landmark.
Getting directions
You can get directions by using pins that you drop on a map for the starting 
and ending locations, or by entering an address or name of a place, such as an 
airport or shopping mall. The directions are shown in a blue line leading from 
one place to another. You can even choose directions by car or foot. Directions 
also give you an idea of the miles and hours it will take you to get to your des­
tination. (It will take you 15 hours and 43 minutes, for example, to walk from 
the Bronx Zoo to the Empire State Building — in case you wondered.) Here are 
the steps to get directions to two different locations in Maps using pins:
	
1.	 With at least one pin on your map (at your destination) in addition to 
your current location, tap Directions in the top-left corner of your 
screen and then tap another location on the list that appears.
	
	 A line appears, showing the route between your current location and the 
closest pin. (See Figure 2-14.)
Figure 2-14: Go from pin to pin on your map to get directions.
	
2.	 Tap the Drive or Walk tab to get the kind of directions you prefer; tap 
Clear to return to the Maps main screen.

312
Getting Directions, Information, and More
	
3.	 You can also enter two locations in the boxes at the top of the page to 
get directions from one to the other.
Here are the steps to get directions in maps by typing the addresses in the 
Search fields:
	
1.	 Tap the Directions button in Maps and then tap in the field labeled 
Start.
	
	 The keyboard appears (see Figure 2-15).
	
2.	 Enter a different starting location.
	
3.	 Tap in the End field and enter a destination location. Tap Route.
	
	 The route between the two locations displays. If you like, you can tap 
the Drive or Walk button to select a category of information once the 
route is displayed.
You can also tap the Information bar that appears when you select a pin and 
use the Directions to Here or Directions from Here button to generate 
directions.
Figure 2-15: Enter addresses using the keyboard or Dictation key.
With a route displayed, an information bar appears telling you about the 
time it takes to travel between the two locations. If there are alternative 
routes, Maps notes the time it takes for any alternative routes alongside the 
routes on the map. Tap a route timing to make it the active route.

Getting Directions, Information, and More
Getting information about a location
Previous sections of this chapter tell you how to display the Information dia­
log for locations in order to get directions. This section focuses on the other 
useful information displayed there. Using the Information button for any 
location, you can get the street address, phone number, and even the URL 
for some businesses or landmarks.
To get to the Information dialog, go to a location and tap the pin. In the infor­
mation bar that appears above the pinned location, tap the arrow (shown in 
Figure 2-16).
Figure 2-16: An information bar above a pinned location.
In the Information dialog, you can tap the web address listed in the Home 
Page field to be taken to the location’s web page, if it has one associated 
with it.
You can also press and hold the Phone or Address field (refer to Figure 2-16) 
and use the Copy button to copy the phone number, for example, so that you 
can place it in a Notes document for future reference. When you have all the 
information you need, tap anywhere outside the Information dialog to close it.
	
Rather than copy and paste information, you can easily save all the informa­
tion about a location in your Contacts address book. See the “Adding a loca­
tion to a contact” section, later in this chapter, to find out how that’s done.

314
Sending Location Info beyond Maps
Sending Location Info beyond Maps
When you find a location you want to come back to or tell others about, you 
can use features of Maps that help you out. You can save a location to the 
Contacts app, which also saves the address, phone number, and URL, if any. 
You can also share a link to locations with friends via email, Messages, 
AirDrop, Facebook, or Twitter. They can then access the location informa­
tion by using Maps on any iOS device or Mac.
Adding a location to a contact
The beauty of this feature is that not only can you store valuable information 
such as phone numbers and street addresses in Contacts quickly and easily, 
you can also use stored contacts to quickly find locations in Maps.
Here’s how this works:
	
1.	 Tap a pin to display the information bar.
	
2.	 Tap the arrow on the bar.
	
3.	 In the Information dialog that appears, tap Create New Contact.
	
	 The New Contact dialog appears (as shown in Figure 2-17). Whatever 
information was available about the location has been entered.
Figure 2-17: Any available information can be stored to Contacts.
	
4.	 Enter any additional information you need, such as name, phone num­
ber, or email address.

Have you found a fantastic restaurant or movie theater that you absolutely 
have to share with a friend? From within Maps, you can use a simple proce­
dure to email a link to your friend. When your friend is connected to the 
Internet and taps the link, that link opens the map to the location in Maps (a 
free service).
After you save a location in Contacts, take these steps to share a location:
	
1.	 Tap a pin to display the information bar.
	
2.	 Tap the Share button at the top right of the Maps screen and then tap 
Selected Location.
	
	 In the dialog that appears (see Figure 2-18), you can choose to share via 
AirDrop, text message, Facebook posting, tweet, or email.
Figure 2-18: You have a variety of ways to share locations.
	
3.	 Tap Mail to see how this option works.

4.	 In the email form that appears, use the onscreen keyboard to enter a 
recipient’s information as appropriate to the service you chose to share.
	
5.	 Tap Send.
	
	 A link to the location information in Maps is sent to your designated 
recipient(s).
	
If you tap Twitter or Facebook in Step 4, you have to have activated Twitter 
or Facebook and have the appropriate account set up using Settings. Tapping 
Message in Step 4 displays a new message form; just enter an email address 
or phone number in the To field, enter your text message, and then tap Send.
	
Use this feature to share your current location so that a friend or emergency 
service can find you. However, beware of sharing your current information 
with strangers!
Getting Turn-by-Turn Navigation Help
When you’ve entered directions for a route and displayed that route, you 
can then, with a 3G/4G iPad model, get spoken instructions that can be help­
ful as you’re driving. Follow these steps to get spoken navigation:
	
1.	 Tap the Start button at the bottom of the screen.
	
2.	 The narration begins and large text instructions are displayed, as 
shown in Figure 2-19.

i

Pad is practically perfect for people who travel a lot for business or plea­
sure. It’s lightweight, slender, and stays powered up for about ten hours 
at a time. Depending on the model, you can connect around the world using 
3G/4G or Wi-Fi (or both) to stay in touch or browse the Internet for what­
ever you need. You have an onscreen keyboard, so you don’t have to tote 
around a physical keyboard. Robust business apps such as those in the 
iWork suite let you get work done as you travel. You may never drag a lap­
top on a trip again!
That’s why, in this chapter, the focus is on how people on 
the road can use the iPad. I start by pointing out the pre­
installed apps that work for travelers and then provide 
some general advice and specific app suggestions for 
making travel arrangements, finding great hotels and 
restaurants, getting maps and travel guides, and 
keeping track of what you spend as you travel. I 
also provide a reminder about using Personal 
Hotspot to go online using your smartphone con­
nection, as well as about using FaceTime, a great 
way to connect with others face to face.
You can use Siri with an iPad mini or third-generation 
or newer iPad to ask for answers and information about 
many of the things handled in the apps in this chapter, such 
as the time of the next flight to Dallas or the highest-rated hotel 
or restaurant in town. See Book V, Chapter 6 for more about Siri.

Starting with Built-in Apps
Starting with Built-in Apps
Before I get into the marvelous world of apps for travelers, consider the 
tools that come with the iPad out of the box. You can find your way around 
the world quite nicely with these little gems, including the following:
	
✓	Maps: This app allows you to locate worldwide locations and get detailed 
street maps (see Figure 3-1), show directions from one point to another, 
and bookmark favorite locations. You can navigate as you drive, walk 
around using blow-by-blow navigation, and share location information 
with others by email or by other means. (See Chapter 2 in this minibook 
for details about how to use Maps.)
Figure 3-1: If your rental car doesn’t have a navigation feature, use your 
iPad instead!
	
✓	Contacts: If you’re going on the road to visit clients or friends and have 
their address information in Contacts, you can tap the address and be 
taken to it instantly in the Maps app. Keep phone numbers handy to get 
in touch when you hit town, and even use the Notes field in a Contacts 
entry to keep track of your business activities with that person or com­
pany. Remember that you can add fields to contact records, including 
job title, related people, department, and birthday using editing tools in 
Contacts. (See Book V, Chapter 5 for more about Contacts features.)
	
✓	Safari browser: Don’t forget that if you have an Internet connection, you 
can use the Safari browser to get online and tap into all the travel-related 
information and sites on the web. Use sites such as Expedia or

Making Travel Arrangements
Travelocity (shown in Figure 3-2) to book travel, check flight information 
at airline websites, go to sites such as MapQuest to get directions and 
maps, and so on. (For more about using Safari, go to Book I, Chapter 6.)
Figure 3-2: Travelocity offers price comparison services for flights, hotel, 
car rental, and more.
	
✓	Mail: This built-in email client lets you keep in touch through any 
accounts you set up in your iPad as long as you have an Internet connec­
tion. Find out more about setting up email accounts in Book I, Chapter 7.
	
✓	Notes: Although there isn’t a travel expense tracker app in iPad, you can 
always use Notes or the Numbers app’s Expense Report template to keep a 
record of what you spend or any other information about your trip that you 
need to recall after you get home. You can even email a note to yourself or 
your bookkeeper so that it’s on your office computer when you get back.
	
Travel can get tedious with long waits in lines or terminals. Don’t forget that 
you have a built-in music player in Music and a built-in video player in the 
Videos app to keep you entertained.
Making Travel Arrangements
Now I move on to apps that don’t reside on your iPad when you buy it. This 
chapter features just a few of the available apps — more are covered at www.
dummies.com/extras/ipadaio. Some are actually iPhone apps that work 
on the iPad (so be sure to check out the iPhone apps category), and some 
were built specifically for iPad.

322
Making Travel Arrangements
Start at the beginning, when you’re planning your trip. You need to book flights 
or other modes of travel and check to see that your flight is on time. You may 
need a rental car when you arrive and perhaps maps of public transit to help you 
plan your route. Examples of all these types of apps are covered in this section.
Getting there by air
This list is a mixed bag of travel-booking tools and apps that help you check 
on your seat assignment or flight status. Try these:
	
✓	Expedia Hotels & Flights: This free, nicely designed app, shown in 
Figure 3-3, lets you book travel online, save itineraries, and get flight 
information. My favorite feature is the ability to explore destinations by 
great deals, upcoming events, or available travel guides. You can even 
check out hotels and sort the results by distance, price, or rating.
Figure 3-3: Expedia is free and offers lots of travel-booking options.
	
✓	Seat Alerts: You know how you always get on the plane thinking that 
your seat will be fine, only to find out that you’re three miles from the 
restroom or stuck in the middle of a seven-seat row on an international 
flight? By using Seat Alerts, which has data from more than 60 airlines 
and many plane models, you get the advice you need to choose the best 
seat to make your travel more enjoyable. This one is free and well worth 
downloading in terms of in-flight comfort.
	
✓	AirportStatus: Get information about flight status and delays all around 
the United States and parts of Canada with this $0.99 app. (See Figure 3-4.) 
You even get information about the cause of delays, such as weather and 
airport closures.

323

Figure 3-4: Check about delays before you leave home 
using AirportStatus.
Several airlines have their own mobile apps for booking or checking flight 
status (see Figure 3-5 for an example) and, in some cases, features for check­
ing your standby status, checking in, and generating a boarding pass. These 
include
	
✓	American Airlines HD
	
✓	Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air Mobile
	
✓	British Airways
	
✓	Fly Delta for iPad
	
✓	Southwest Airlines
	
✓	United Airlines
	
✓	Virgin Atlantic Flight Tracker

324

Figure 3-5: Enter information about your flight and get 
information back.
	
If you’re a frequent flier, check out the Air Milage Calculator app. (Make sure 
to exclude the first e in mileage when searching the Apps Store for this app.) 
For $0.99, you can get the mileage for travel between airports worldwide 
with up to three legs for each trip. You can also have the app calculate 
bonuses based on your frequent-flier status and the class of travel.
	
If packing is a challenge for you and you don’t have a valet to help you out (mine 
quit last week), try Packing Pro. Keep track of lists of what you need by trip, 
including your passport, clothing, and vital accessories such as an umbrella for 
that trip to Seattle. It costs you $2.99, but if you’re organizationally challenged, it 
might save your neck as you prepare for business or family trips.
Renting a car
If you want to deal with your car rentals from your iPad, you’ll be glad to 
hear that there are apps that help you do just that. Consider apps such as 
these that help you find the right rental deal:

Finding Just the Right Hotels
	
✓	ABN Car Rentals: Helps you claim car rental discounts for Hertz cars; it 
even comes with a free Hertz #1 Club Gold membership. You can use 
this free app right at the car rental counter, typically saving about 20 
percent on your car rental cost.
	
✓	Airport Car Rental: This free app lets you search for car rental agencies 
available at many major airports. You can enter your car rental require­
ments in your iPhone or iPad and let the app search for the best match 
at your destination airport and make real-time reservations.
You can also get individual apps for your favorite car rental companies, such 
as Avis Reservation App or Hertz Car Rental.
	
Road Trip HD is a $4.99 utility that helps you track your mileage and fuel econ­
omy, which may help you estimate your costs if your rental car doesn’t include 
unlimited miles. It sports a nice visual graph of fuel economy, and if you use 
your own car on the road, the feature that lets you track mileage and fuel cost 
by trip can be a neat way to sum up your travel expenses every month.
Finding your way around town
Before you set off on your trip to cities such as New York, San Francisco, or 
Chicago, you may want to download one of these apps to get local transit 
system maps, schedules, and more.
Transit Maps is free and comes with one transit map, but it enables you to 
download transit maps as graphics files from the Internet using its own 
browser feature. The beauty of this app is that it helps you download large 
image files and view them offline, so you can check a map even if you’re not 
able to get online.
iTransitBuddy is a series of apps costing $0.99 for various metro areas; 
they’re designed for the iPhone but usable on the iPad. These apps have a 
helpful feature for looking up free transfers and schedule updates. Maps are 
downloaded to your device, so you don’t have to have an Internet connec­
tion to use them. An iTransitBuddy app is handy for commuters as well as 
those who travel to metro areas on business or for pleasure.
	
As you’re exploring a new town, make sure that you’re dressed right for the 
weather. PocketWeather (free) lets you get weather reports on the go.
Finding Just the Right Hotels
Hotel chains have begun to jump on the app bandwagon. Some chains, such 
as Holiday Inn, Marriott, Hilton, and Best Western, offer apps. Some offer 
apps for only individual hotels within the chain. Another option for finding 

326
Finding Just the Right Hotels
hotels around the country or world is to depend on hotel-booking apps for 
your hotel travel.
Here are a few free hotel-booking apps (be sure to check out www.dummies.
com/extras/ipadaio for a few more) that can get you started on your 
iPad hotel search/booking experience. Most (including the Hotels.com HD 
app, shown in Figure 3-6) allow you to search for hotels and check ratings, 
price, and availability.
Figure 3-6: Details about hotels include a description, map, list of facilities, 
policies, and more.
You can also book your reservation and, in some cases, check local 
attractions.
	
✓	Booking.com Hotel Reservations Worldwide
	
✓	Choice Hotels
	
✓	HotelsByMe — Hotels & Hotel Room Reservations
	
✓	Hotel Tonight
	
✓	Hotwire Hotels & Cars
	
✓	Near by Me
	
Some general travel sites, such as Kayak and Travelocity, also have hotel 
searching and booking features.

Locating the Perfect Restaurant
Locating the Perfect Restaurant
What’s a road warrior without his lunch? Hungry, that’s what. So, why not 
use your iPad to find food? Here’s a selection of some intriguing restaurant-
listing apps for you to explore:
	
✓	Vegetarian-Restaurants: Do you avoid meat in your diet? If so, check out 
the free Vegetarian-Restaurants app (shown in Figure 3-7). Look for vege­
tarian restaurants worldwide as well as vegetarian recipes and informa­
tion about the vegetarian lifestyle.
Figure 3-7: Vegetarian-Restaurants helps you locate food 
without meat around the world.
	
✓	Yelp: This free app taps you into a huge resource of customer reviews of 
restaurants to help you pick the best spot for your next meal.
	
✓	Michelin Travel Guide: For anywhere from $9.99 to $18.99, you can get 
the latest Michelin guide by country. Michelin is kind of the gold

Using Maps and Travel Guides
standard in restaurant rating systems, so if you’re a serious world trav­
eler and gourmand, you can appreciate its insights into the quality of 
food, specialties of the house, hours, and even the name of the chef so 
that you can send your compliments to him or her.
	
✓	Where to Eat? Pro: A poor man’s Michelin Guide can be found in Where 
to Eat? HD, a $2.99 app that has been reworked for the iPad. Search for 
the closest restaurants anywhere you are in the world, find the cuisine 
you’re looking for, and customize searches.
	
If you want to find a restaurant with available Wi-Fi, you can find such loca­
tions using WiFi Get HD. This very handy app helps you spot hotspots even 
if you’re not connected at the moment. This one costs $2.99. Or you can 
always ask Siri something like “Where can I find a good Italian restaurant?” 
Siri uses your location to return the information.
If you’re concerned about your waistline, here are a few more free and help­
ful food-oriented apps:
	
✓	Dotti’s Food Score: Can help you check out more than 600 restaurants, 
including those that qualify for Dotti’s Weight Loss Zone ranking. 
Download to a Favorites list so that you can view it as you sit at a table, 
even in restaurants with no Wi-Fi.
	
✓	Restaurants & Nutrition: For $1.99, this app shows you carbohydrates, 
calories, and fat for more than 80 chain restaurants, such as TGI Fridays 
and The Cheesecake Factory. (Well, forget what I said about watching 
your waist!)
	
Note that in the Maps app, you can enter the term restaurants in the Search 
field and search, and pins are dropped on the map indicating restaurants 
near your location.
Using Maps and Travel Guides
One important part of the road-warrior experience is finding your way 
around and connecting with the local culture. For that, you can explore some 
mapping apps and travel guides. These will get you started:
	
✓	Barefoot World Atlas: With this $4.99 app, you get an interactive globe 
that you can browse using your finger and touchscreen. The app is opti­
mized for third-generation (and later) iPads, so the visual experience is 
stunning.
	
✓	cityscouter GmbH guides: These handy little guides run about $3.99 per 
city and can be used offline. That’s useful if you’re on a plane, wandering 
around a foreign city nowhere near a hotspot, or out of range of your 3G 
provider’s services. Find out about top attractions, take advantage of a

currency converter, or find a wiki article, photos, or maps (see Figure 3-8). 
Many include up-to-date information about local public transportation 
as well.
Figure 3-8: The cityscouter.com guide to Copenhagen.
	
✓	World Travel Channel: This free app makes the programming from the 
Travel Channel available to help you brave bizarre foreign foods or find 
a hotel that’s haunted.
In addition to the preceding apps, check out popular travel guides and tools 
such as Lonely Planet Travel Guides (as much as $14.99 each). Also, the 
Travel + Leisure Magazine is a free app for Newsstand, though you’ll pay for 
each issue you buy using the app.
Tracking Your Expenses
My favorite part of any business trip is when I get that expense reimburse­
ment check. Of course, to get that check, I have to go through my receipt col­
lection trying to figure out what I spent where and to itemize it for my client.
To make your iPad travel experience easier, try these great apps that help 
you keep all your trip expenses in order:
	
✓	XpenseTracker: For $4.99, you get both an expense-tracking app and 
mileage log. This one comes with several PDF report templates that can 
come in handy.

330
Staying Connected
	
✓	my Travel Assistant: With a $2.99 price tag, this app designed for the 
iPhone is easy to use for tracking expenses and has some very nice tools 
for analyzing your expenditures as well. Plus, it supports 51 languages.
	
✓	MileBug: This easy-to-use app costs $2.99 and helps you keep track of 
dollars spent and miles traveled.
	
If you frequently travel out of the country, you may want to check out www.
dummies.com/extras/ipadaio for apps that help you juggle currency 
exchange rates.
	
Don’t forget that when you’re in the privacy of your hotel, you can use the 
Dictation feature on your iPad to speak your expense entries into a Numbers 
or other dictation-compatible app. Hands-free expense reporting!
Staying Connected
When you’re on the road, staying connected with your office or family is 
important. That’s why you should be sure to take advantage of two cool 
­features, FaceTime and Personal Hotspot. Here’s what you can do with 
these two:
	
✓	FaceTime: This video and audio-calling app (covered in detail in Book II, 
Chapter 4) allows you to take advantage of the video camera in the iPad 
(except for the original iPad) to call others who have the FaceTime fea­
ture on their iPad, Mac, iPhone, or iPod touch. You can use the front 
camera to show the person you called your own bright smile, or switch 
to the rear camera to let that person see what you’re looking at right 
now. Great way to make others jealous when you snagged that sales 
account in Hawaii!
	
✓	Personal Hotspot: Gives you the ability to use your iPhone’s 3G/4G con­
nection (in some cases for a fee to your service provider) to take your 
Wi-Fi–only model iPad online when Wi-Fi is out of reach. Personal 
Hotspot can, in fact, perform this service for up to five Wi-Fi devices on 
the Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, and AT&T versions of iPhone. This is a 
very useful feature for driving road warriors who can’t sit in an airport 
or hotel lobby to get online or make calls. (I cover Personal Hotspot in 
more detail in Chapter 1 of this minibook.)
	
Don’t forget that by using the iCloud storage and sharing service, you can 
have all the content you buy on other Apple devices automatically synced to 
your iPad. If your spouse downloads some new music or a movie to her 
iPhone and you both use the same Apple ID, with a Family Sharing account, 
for example, you can access that movie on your iPad wherever you are.

W

ord-processing and spreadsheet applications are among the most 
widely used software products; presentation software is not far 
behind, along with programs such as graphics and database editors. Having 
started from scratch on the hardware side and then the operating-system 
side, Apple employees started dreaming about what they could do if they 
were to start from scratch to write modern versions of word-processing, 
spreadsheet, and presentation programs. They knew they’d have to fol­
low one of their advertising campaign themes: Think Different.
The result was the iWork suite of applications (a collec­
tion of applications that can work together) for the 
Mac — Keynote, Pages, and Numbers — that were 
developed one by one over a period of several years.
Today, iWork is a terrific suite of programs that 
have become a trio of dynamite apps for iPad and 
iPhone, and all the apps are now free when you buy 
a new iOS device.
In addition, Apple introduced iWork for iCloud in 
2013, so you can work in very similar software inter­
faces online using your browser. All documents you cre­
ate in these versions of iWork apps are stored both in 
iCloud and on your devices. (For more about iWork for iCloud, 
go to www.apple.com/iWork-for-iCloud).

334
Presenting the iWork for iOS Apps
	
In this chapter, the focus is on the three iWork for iOS apps, including how to 
use their common interface elements. You also find a summary of differences 
between iWork for iPad and iWork for Mac in those cases where it matters.
Presenting the iWork for iOS Apps
iWork provides applications that are office oriented — so-called productivity 
applications. The iWork office suite includes three apps that are similar to 
Microsoft Office applications (but way cooler, I think):
	
✓	Pages: A word-processing and page-layout application (similar to 
Microsoft Word)
	
✓	Numbers: A spreadsheet application (similar to Microsoft Excel)
	
✓	Keynote: A presentation application (similar to Microsoft PowerPoint)
All three apps are optimized for those iPad models with a brilliant Retina 
display, plus they have some new templates that you can base your presen­
tation on.
	
Each program that you download from the App Store on a new iOS device is 
free. iCloud automatically migrates the apps and documents you create with 
these programs to any other Apple devices running iOS. (See Book I, 
Chapter 5, for more information.)
In the following sections, you take a quick look at these three iWork for iOS 
apps, all of which have been upgraded with the release of iOS 8.
Pages
For many people, word processing is the core of an office suite. In fact, many 
people don’t get beyond it. Pages for Mac adds a big desktop publishing plus 
to word processing in that it also allows you to create page layout docu­
ments. These have the type of structure that you see in newspapers and 
magazines — articles don’t just flow one after the other. Instead, an article 
on Page 1 may be continued on Page 4, and another article on the first page 
may be continued on Page 8. Also, objects such as photos can be anchored 
to associated text, or placed in specific positions on a page, and they don’t 
move as the text around them is added or deleted.
iWork provides you with a variety of sophisticated tools to create your Pages 
documents. These include advanced font handling, color, tables, and charts, 
as well as the ability to place QuickTime movies and hypertext links in your 

335
Book IV 
Chapter 1

Pages documents. iWork applications also provide a variety of template 
options for your documents. Figure 1-1 shows some of the templates avail­
able with Pages for iOS.
Figure 1-1: Choose a Pages template as a starting point.
	
For more on the Pages app, see Chapter 2 in this minibook.
Numbers
As with all spreadsheet programs, Numbers enables you to enter data in rows 
and columns. One of the most useful features of spreadsheets is that they per­
form calculations by means of formulas. For example, if you have a column 
listing your grocery expenditures by week, the addition of another grocery 
bill will cause the program to recalculate the column’s total. Spreadsheets are 
about data (usually numbers) and fast calculation updates, but they can also 
help you organize data such as address lists and even generate charts to 
show data trends.
Spreadsheets can go beyond the common grid interface, and Numbers 
excels at this approach. Take a look at the Numbers document shown in 
Figure 1-2, which is based on the Travel Planner template.

336
Presenting the iWork for iOS Apps
Figure 1-2: A highly visual Numbers spreadsheet.
A single document can have a number of sheets (like sheets in a Microsoft 
Excel workbook). On the iPad, sheets appear as tabs, as shown in Figure 1-2.
A Numbers sheet can contain a variety of objects such as tables and charts, 
but it can also contain other iWork objects, such as graphics, text boxes, 
movies, and audio. In Figure 1-2, the sheet is shown with a table and five 
pictures above it.
For more on the Numbers app, see Chapter 3 in this minibook.
Keynote
Call them lectures, classes, sermons, dog-and-pony shows, or sales pitches, 
but presentations are all much the same: Someone stands in front of a large 
or small group of people and explains, teaches, inspires, entertains, or per­
suades them. In some cases, a presentation can run on its own or be run by 
the viewer in person or online.
Today, a presentation often includes multimedia elements: slides of buildings 
in an architecture class; slides with music in a presentation about your

community theater’s latest musical production; movies of good times on the 
beach in a talk about Uncle Charlie’s summer vacation.
Keynote was the original iWork application. Built by Apple engineers for 
Macworld and Worldwide Developers Conference keynote speeches deliv­
ered by Steve Jobs, Keynote has been refined over the years to become the 
powerful tool it is today. (See Figure 1-3.)
For more on the Keynote app, see Chapter 4 in this minibook.
Figure 1-3: Editing a Keynote presentation.
Starting Out with an iWork App
The first time you run an iWork app, you’re greeted by a Welcome screen. 
The next time you open an app, you find yourself exactly where you were the 
last time you left it. Each iWork app has its own graphic. The first-time 
Welcome screen for Numbers is shown in Figure 1-4.

338
Getting Familiar with the iWork Interface
Figure 1-4: Numbers is launched for the first time on an 
iCloud-enabled iPad.
Tap Continue, and you’re taken to a screen showing Numbers templates with 
callouts to some of the tools available, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Getting Familiar with the iWork Interface
You’ll find that each of the iWork apps has a similar look and feel. One of the 
coolest advantages of iWork is that major features — not just small opera­
tions such as changing a font or selecting a color — are available using the 
same method in all its apps. You have only one set of features that you must 
understand when you’re using iWork, so I give you an overview of all that 
common functionality here to get you started.
	
The iWork apps (like all apps) are updated periodically. If an update is avail­
able, you see the App Store on your iPad Home screen with a number indicat­
ing that downloads are available. Updating your iWork apps when updates 
are available is generally a good idea so that their interfaces remain in sync.

to share view-only docs, and the ability to search for docs by name.
Creating a new document
You create a new document in the same way for each iWork app. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Tap any of the iWork app icons to launch the application.
	
	 The Documents screen appears. This screen is titled Pages in the Pages 
app (see Figure 1-5), Spreadsheets in Numbers, and Presentations in 
Keynote.
Figure 1-5: Create a new document from the Documents screen.
	
	 Note that when you first open an iWork app, you see a single document 
that contains basic information and instructions for that app. After that, 
when you create and save any documents, they will also display on the 
Documents screen.
	
	 If you see Documents on the button in the top-left corner while in Pages, 
you’re not on the Documents screen; you’re on the screen for working 
with an individual document, and tapping Documents (or Spreadsheets in 
Numbers or Presentations in Keynote) brings you back to the Documents 
screen.
	
2.	 Tap the plus sign (+) in the square titled Create Document at the top 
left of the Documents screen.
	
	 Templates are displayed in categories. The Basic template options (see 
Figure 1-6) will vary depending on which app you’re using. In Pages, for 
example, you can create a new Blank document, a Blank Landscape doc­
ument, or a Note Taking document. You can also scroll down and tap 

340
Getting Familiar with the iWork Interface
another document template on which to base your new document, such 
as Modern Report or Project Proposal.
Figure 1-6: Select a template.
	
3.	 Tap the template you want to use as a starting point, or tap Blank 
(Pages and Numbers) or Black or White (Keynote) to start working 
with a completely clean document.
	
	 If you decide not to create a document right now, you can tap Cancel on 
the Templates screen and return to the Documents screen.
	
	 The templates are different for each of the iWork apps, so I discuss them 
in the appropriate chapters in this minibook.
	
	 Your new document opens on the screen.
Locating a document
Before long, you’ll have created several documents, and chances are good 
that you’ll want to go back and work on some of them, print them, or share 
them via iCloud, AirDrop, Mail, or Message. As with creating new documents, 
locating a document is done the same way in each of the iWork apps.
To locate a document, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap any of the iWork app icons to launch the application.
	
	 The Documents window appears. After you’ve created several docu­
ments, that screen looks like Figure 1-7.

2.	 View the documents and find the one you want to work with.
	
	 Below each document, you see its title and the date you last worked on it.
	
3.	 Tap the document you want to work with.
	
	 The document opens, and you can begin working in it.
Identifying other common iWork features
You’ve already seen the major iWork controls in Figures 4-2 and 4-3. In the 
following sections, you look at each one more closely.
Using popovers and dialogs
An important interface element in the Pages document shown in Figure 1-8 is 
the popover. Common to all iWork apps, the popover is essentially a menu. 
Like a menu, it goes away when you tap elsewhere. A dialog, on the other 
hand, offers settings and choices and you have to close it to get it off the 
screen.
This list describes three actions you can take with a popover:
	
✓	Recognize the purpose of the popover. Each popover includes an arrow 
that points to the object that opened it.
	
✓	Dismiss the popover. If you want to dismiss the popover (the equivalent 
of the Close or Cancel button on a dialog on your Mac or PC), tap any­
where outside the popover.

342
Getting Familiar with the iWork Interface
	
✓	Make a selection on the popover. When you tap a choice in a popover, 
it’s carried out and the popover closes automatically.
Working with the Documents toolbar
Also visible in Figure 1-7 and most other figures in this chapter is the toolbar, 
which runs along the top of the screen. On a Documents screen, the toolbar 
displays the name of the app in the center, the Help and Edit buttons at the 
right, and the plus sign (+) and Share buttons at the left.
Tap Edit, and your document icons start to jiggle — just as the icons do on 
the Home screen of your iPad. (And, just as on the Home screen, tap and hold 
a document icon and you enter Edit mode automatically.) While the icons are 
jiggling, you can drag one onto another to create a folder — just as on your 
iPad Home screen. Tap Done to stop all that jiggling and leave Edit mode.
Tap a folder to open it. The folder expands, as shown in Figure 1-8. From 
there, you can tap any document to open it.
Figure 1-8: You can rename your folders at any time.
Press and hold the folder name, and the name field opens so that you can 
rename the folder. This press-and-hold method also works with individual 
document files so that you can rename them.
You can drag a document out of the folder and back to the Documents 
screen. When you remove the last document from a folder, the folder 
disappears.

343

When you’re finished organizing and renaming your folders and documents, 
tap Done.
	
If you choose an action such as copying a document, the iWork app automat­
ically ends the jiggle-editing without your having to tap Done.
Working with a toolbar for a single document
When you’re working within a single document, you see a different toolbar, 
as you can see in Figure 1-9. (This is from Keynote.)
Figure 1-9: Work with a single document’s toolbar in Keynote.
On the far-left side of the toolbar, the Documents button (titled Presentations 
in Keynote and Spreadsheets in Numbers) lets you see all your documents in 
Documents view. Next to Documents is the Undo button. (It’s the same as the 
Edit➪Undo command that you may have used in OS X for iWork and most 
other apps.) In the center of the window is the document’s name.
At the right of the iWork toolbar is a group of buttons:
	
✓	Format: Provides information and formatting choices about the current 
selection in the document. From here, you may choose a style, a list 

344
Getting Familiar with the iWork Interface
format, or a layout (alignment, columns, and line spacing) for a selected 
paragraph, or modify the style of an image. If nothing is selected, this 
button is dimmed.
	
✓	Insert: Lets you insert images from your photo albums on iPad. If you 
want to insert a photo into your iWork document, add it to your album 
by taking the photo or synchronizing it in iTunes. (I tell you more about 
this button in the next section.)
	
✓	Tools: The wrench-shaped button opens a popover containing tools that 
are based on the document as a whole rather than on the current selection 
within the document. Figure 1-10 shows the tools for a Pages document.
Figure 1-10: Tools for a Pages document.
	
✓	Share: Use this popover to share a link to the document via iCloud, to 
send a copy via Mail or Messages, or to open the document in another 
app (such as opening a PDF file in Adobe Reader).
	
✓	Play: In Keynote only, you tap this button to play the slideshow.
Some menus have disclosure triangles that let you drill down one more level. 
For example, Figure 1-11 shows the Printer Options menu. Print settings are 
described in Book V, Chapter 1.

You can use the < button in the popover to return to the tools. The Settings 
submenu of the Tools menu is shown in Figure 1-12. Note that Word Count 
has been turned on, which causes the current word count to be displayed at 
the bottom of the document.
Figure 1-12: Adjusting settings.

346
Working with Images
	
The ruler that you may have noticed in Pages is used by its word-processing 
features. Similar tools at the top of the screen are used in Numbers and 
Keynote depending on what you’re trying to do. I discuss them in the rele­
vant chapters in this minibook.
Working with Images
One important feature that distinguishes Apple software from many other 
products is how easily you can use graphics and video in the documents you 
create. It’s not unusual for you to see Pages templates with photo placehold­
ers in them, and it certainly makes sense that Keynote templates often include 
photos. In today’s world, you expect images in word-processing documents 
and presentations. But spreadsheets? Take a look at the Numbers templates 
to see how the people at Apple are suggesting you rethink your understanding 
of spreadsheets.
Photos, images, and video can be added — easily and productively — to any 
iWork for iPad document. You have two ways to do this:
	
✓	From the Documents window, tap the Insert button (it looks like a plus 
sign).
	
✓	Select a template that includes a placeholder image.
Using a template with a placeholder image requires one more step than 
using the Insert button. Here’s how this process works:
	
1.	 Create a document based on a template.
	
	 Figure 1-13 shows the Harmony template in Keynote.
	
2.	 Tap the plus sign (+) in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
	
	 A pop-up displaying various types of slide styles appears.
	
3.	 Tap a slide style that contains an image.
	
	 In the lower-right corner of the image placeholder that appears is an 
Insert button. Tapping this button allows you to access a dialog from 
which you can insert another image to replace the placeholder image.
	
4.	 Tap the Insert button in the bottom-right corner of the placeholder 
figure to open a list of your photo albums, as shown in Figure 1-14.
	
	 You can browse photos on your iPad as well as albums you have created 
in iPhoto or other programs such as Photoshop Elements and synchro­
nized to your iPad or from Photo Streams.

Figure 1-15) to adjust the size of the image.

348
Working with Images
Figure 1-15: Tap an image to reveal resizing handles.
	
	 You start with the image the same size as the frame, but if you tap and 
drag handles in any direction, as you see in Figure 1-16, the image is 
shown dimly filling more and more of the entire screen. You can use 
these eight handles on the frame to change its size and shape. This is a 
hands-on way to handle tasks such as cropping images. Rest assured 
that the original image file is unchanged by these steps: You’re changing 
the image’s appearance only within the document.
	
	 You can drag the image around so that the part you want is inside the 
frame.

Managing Your iWork Documents
Managing Your iWork Documents
The data for your iWork documents is stored in files on your iPad, possibly 
on your Mac, and also sometimes on shared WebDAV (Web-based Distributed 
Authoring and Versioning, used for collaboration and managing of files on 
the web) servers and, as you will see, on iCloud, if you choose.
You can also take advantage of the fact that iWork documents can by synced 
across all your devices via iCloud.
Deep down inside the iPad operating system (iOS) are files and folders, but 
most of the time you manipulate them through apps. When it comes to apps, 
the files and folders are in a special area reserved only for that app (it’s called 
a sandbox).
	
The storage areas for files on your iPad are kept separate for each app. If you 
install Pages and then remove it from your iPad, your Pages documents dis­
appear along with the Pages app. Before uninstalling any app from your iPad, 
make certain that you have backed up any files you’ve created.
Sharing documents
You’ve copied a file from another place onto your iPad, and now it’s time to 
reverse the process. To share a file you’ve created in iWork on your iPad, fol­
low these steps:
	
1.	 From the Documents window, open the document you want to share.
	
2.	 Tap the Share button.
	
	 As you see in Figure 1-17, the Share popover allows you to Share a Link 
via iCloud (which allows others to make changes to your document); 
Send a Copy via AirDrop, Messages, or Mail; or open the document in 
another format such as PDF and share it in that format.
Figure 1-17: Share in a variety of ways.

350
Managing Your iWork Documents
Moving files with iTunes
You can move files to and from iTunes on your computer with a cable or 
with a Wi-Fi connection.
	
You can also use cloud storage programs such as Dropbox to manage files, 
which is sometimes simpler and avoids certain constraints imposed by 
Apple-centric iTunes.
Moving files to your computer from your iPad
Each iWork app has its own storage area for your files. You move files from 
your iPad to your computer using iTunes and these steps:
	
1.	 Connect your iPad to the computer where you want to move the files.
	
	 Your computer can be a Mac or PC. It must have iTunes installed. If 
iTunes isn’t installed, see Book I, Chapter 4, and then come back here.
	
	 You can also sync between your iPad and your computer using a Wi-Fi 
connection rather than a cable. On the iTunes Summary screen, select 
Sync with This iPad over Wi-Fi under Options. If you have that option 
turned off or do not want to use it, you can connect your iPad to your 
computer with a cable.
	
2.	 When iTunes launches, find your iPad in the Devices section of the 
Source List and select it by clicking once.
	
3.	 Select the Apps tab from the group of tabs running across the top of 
the pane, as shown in Figure 1-18.
	
	 If you’re running iTunes with the OS X Mavericks on a Mac, you won’t see an 
Info tab to the left of the Apps tab, but you will if you’re running Yosemite.
Figure 1-18: Connecting your iPad to iTunes on your Mac or PC.

4.	 Scroll down to the bottom of the pane and select the iWork app you’re 
interested in.
	
	 The documents on your iPad for that app are shown.
	
5.	 Select the document you want and click Save To.
	
6.	 Choose the folder and the name you want to use for the saved file.
	
	 The file is moved to your computer.
Moving files to your iPad from your computer
The process for moving files from your computer to your iPad is similar to 
the process described in the preceding section. To copy files from your com­
puter to your iPad, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Connect your iPad to the computer from which the files are to be 
moved.
	
	 You can use a cable or a Wi-Fi connection if you have selected that 
option.
	
	 You can use a Mac or PC, but you must have installed iTunes on it.
	
2.	 Find your iPad under the Devices section of the Source List and click it.
	
3.	 Select the Apps tab from the group of tabs running across the top of 
the pane.
	
4.	 Scroll down to the bottom of the pane and select the iWork app you’re 
interested in.
	
	 The documents on your iPad for that app are listed.
	
5.	 Click Add in the lower-right portion of the window.
	
6.	 When prompted, select the file on your computer’s hard drive.
	
	 When you select a file, it moves to the list of files in iTunes and usually 
moves immediately to your iPad. If it doesn’t move immediately, click 
Sync.
	
In Step 5 in the preceding list, you can also simply drag the document icon 
from the Finder or Windows File Explorer window into the file list area.

T

his chapter delves into the Pages app, which is the word-processing and 
page-layout tool in the iWork suite of apps. Pages gives you powerful 
tools for creating documents of all kinds.
In this chapter, I tell you how to work with text and text boxes, format a 
­document, and use the simple-to-use Pages interface.
To find basic instructions for managing documents and 
sharing them via WebDAV, iCloud, email, or iTunes, see 
Chapter 1 in this minibook.
Editing a Pages Document
After you open a Pages document, you can edit it 
using the tools shown in Figure 2-1.
	
To find out how to create a new Pages document, see 
Chapter 1 in this minibook.

354
Editing a Pages Document
When you tap somewhere within the text, the keyboard and tools shown in 
Figure 2-1 appear. When you tap an image, a toolbar offering Cut, Copy, 
Delete, and Comment tools appears. When you leave an iWork document for 
another app and then return to it, remember that you return to the same 
location you left.
Figure 2-1: An open document with text tools displayed.
	
When a document is open, the Documents button is visible at the left of the 
toolbar, at the top of the screen; tap this button to return to the Documents 
window, where you can create a new document by tapping the button 
labeled with the plus sign (+).
When working on a multipage document, you can quickly move through the 
document by swiping up or down.
In Pages, you can touch and hold your finger anywhere at the right side of a 
page to bring up the navigator (shown in Figure 2-2), which shows a thumb­
nail of a page; you can move very quickly through the document by dragging 
up or down on the screen. When you’re on the page you want, just lift your 
finger off the screen. If you don’t want to leave the page you started from, 
swipe to the right to make the navigator disappear.

355
Book IV 
Chapter 2
Pages Has a Way

Working with Text in Pages
Figure 2-2: Using the navigator.
Working with Text in Pages
You can get a leg up on creating a document if you start from an iWork tem­
plate (a template other than the Blank template, which is, well, blank). Even 
though you may see only a text placeholder in the template, the basic struc­
ture helps you get started. Templates appear when you tap the plus sign (+) 
on the Documents window to add a new document. Just tap a template to 
open it.
After you open a document, entering text is simple. You have four ways to 
start entering text:
	
✓	Type text. Tap the spot in the document where you want to enter text 
and start typing. You can use the onscreen keyboard or a wireless 
keyboard.
	
✓	Dictate text. Tap the Dictation key (not available on iPad 2) on the 
onscreen keyboard (the small microphone) and speak your text, includ­
ing punctuation. Dictation also allows some simple commands such as 
“Next line.”
	
✓	Cut, copy, or paste text (or a combination). Use the cut, copy, and paste 
tools to cut text in your Pages document and move it to another location, 
or to copy text in any iPad app (for example, from a website accessed by 
the Safari browser) and paste it into your Pages document. You get these 
controls by pressing and holding on text to display a set of tools.

356
Setting Basic Formatting by Using the Ruler
	
✓	Import text. You can use iTunes, iCloud, Mail, or cloud storage apps 
such as Dropbox to move existing documents to your iPad. You can cre­
ate the documents on your Mac or PC by using tools such as iWork, 
Microsoft Office, or Google Apps. When the document is ready, import 
that file saved in .txt, Word, or Pages formats to your iPad as 
described in Chapter 1 of this minibook and continue working with the 
document using iWork for iPad. If you work on a document using iWork 
for iCloud with a browser from a PC or Mac, the document will automati­
cally be saved both in iCloud and to all your iOS devices.
After you have text in your Pages document, you can start to manage it.
Setting Basic Formatting by Using the Ruler
As is the case in most word-processing programs, a ruler at the top of a page 
in document editing view lets you set basic formatting. The ruler can be hid­
den, but tapping in the document displays it, as shown in Figure 2-3. Tapping 
text also displays the keyboard with formatting tools along the top. You can 
also tap the Format button shaped like a paintbrush at any time to display 
the Formats dialog.
The ruler shows you the settings for whatever is selected in the document. 
Tap text in the document, and the ruler is immediately enabled and reflects 
the settings for the selection (in this case, the margins). Tapping in the docu­
ment may also bring up the onscreen keyboard and a contextual set of tool 
buttons, as shown in Figure 2-3. You can use them to use features such as 
Cut, Copy, Delete, and Paste.
Figure 2-3: Displaying the ruler and formatting tools in Pages.

357
Book IV 
Chapter 2
Pages Has a Way

Setting Basic Formatting by Using the Ruler
	
Press and hold text to bring up a set of contextual buttons, a double-tap 
selects the word at the insertion point, and a triple-tap selects the paragraph 
and brings up slightly different selection buttons.
The formatting bar along the top of the onscreen keyboard provides basic 
formatting tools. The tools on the ruler that can be used on the selection 
(from left to right in Figure 2-4) are described in this list:
	
✓	Tab: Tap this button to set new tab stops.
	
✓	Indent: Tap either of the Indent buttons to indent text in one level or out 
one level at a time.
	
✓	Font: In Figure 2-4, the font is Helvetica Neue. Tap the font name to open 
a popover with a list of fonts to select from. Note that available fonts in 
Pages on iPad are fewer than in Mac or Windows programs, and you 
can’t add fonts as you can on a computer. So if a font isn’t supported on 
iPad, another font is substituted, which could affect layout and appear­
ance adversely.
Figure 2-4: The ruler indicates settings for the current selection.

358
Getting and Setting Info about the Selection
	
✓	Font Size: Tap the large A on the right to enlarge selected text by one 
point; tap the smaller A on the left to decrease the text size. By using the 
tool in the middle, you can set the font size to an exact number.
	
✓	Font Styles: You can choose bold, italic, or underlining.
	
✓	Alignment: The selected paragraph can be aligned to the left, center, or 
right, or justified so that both margins are straight with no ragged edges. 
You don’t have to select the paragraph with a triple-tap for alignment to 
work. If you have selected a word or an insertion point, the paragraph 
containing either item is the selected paragraph.
	
✓	Insert: Tapping the last button on the Formatting toolbar displays a 
menu of insertion commands including Comment, Link, Page Break, 
Column Break, and Footnote. (Link appears only if text is selected; Line 
Break appears only if no text is selected.)
Feel free to experiment with the formatting within your Pages documents, 
and remember that the Undo button in the upper left is there to help you out 
if you change your mind about an action you’ve taken.
	
You can also use the ruler to set the margins for paragraphs. Just slide the 
indicators along the ruler. Note that the top indicator for the left margin 
reflects the margin of the first line in a paragraph; the lower indicator is the 
left margin of all other lines in the paragraph. You can indent the first line of 
a paragraph, but you can also outdent it (or provide a hanging first line); an 
outdent works well in a list.
Getting and Setting Info about the Selection
The Format button on the toolbar at the top-right of the document opens a 
popover that provides settings in addition to those shown on the ruler. (See 
the preceding section.) When you select text and tap the Format button, you 
see a popover with three tabs along the top: Style, List, and Layout. Select a 
tab to access various formatting options, as I describe in the following three 
sections.
Setting character style: Font, size, and color
One setting that you can adjust by using the Format button is Style. Tap the 
Format button, and the popover shown in Figure 2-5 opens. (The Style tab in 
the top-left corner of the popover is selected by default.)

359
Book IV 
Chapter 2
Pages Has a Way 
with Words
Getting and Setting Info about the Selection
The powerful Style tab of the Format popover has a wide range of functional­
ity. The topmost section lets you set the character style for the selected text. 
The character style is simply the set of styles applied to characters. The sec­
ond section of the popover lets you set the paragraph style — the style for 
the entire paragraph in which the selection is set.
	
You can’t create your own paragraph styles in Pages for iOS, but you can use 
any you created in Pages for Mac. Pages for iOS retains styles from Pages for 
Mac documents internally so that they still work if you open the document 
back in Pages for Mac.
After selecting the characters you want to style, tap Format and then the 
current font setting in the popover. (It’s 14-point American Typewriter in 
Figure 2-5.) The popover shown in Figure 2-6 opens, and you can select 
another font, font size, or color for the font.

Figure 2-6: Adjust character styles.
Tap the color well (the swatch of color next to the word Color), and you can 
select a new color, as shown in Figure 2-7. You can tap one of the small cir­
cles at the bottom of this popover to display additional choices.
Creating indents and list styles
After you select a paragraph, tap the Format button and then, in the pop­
over, tap the List tab to experiment with indentation and lists. The options 
shown in Figure 2-8 include arrow buttons at the top of the view that let you 
move the left margin in (indent) or out (outdent). You also can choose to 
make automatic numbering, lettering, or bullets available by choosing a list 
format.
	
When you add an element to the list or delete an element from it, Pages auto­
matically renumbers the list for you.
Establishing alignment, columns, and line spacing
The Layout tab in the top-right corner of the Format popover lets you set 
layout options, as shown in Figure 2-9. These include the options for creating 
columns and adjusting line spacing.

Formatting a Document
You can format the text in your document, but you should attend to one 
other type of formatting: formatting the document itself. It includes page 
headers and footers, page numbers, and backgrounds that appear on all 
pages. Here’s how to do just that:
	
1.	 Open a Pages document and tap Tools.
	
	 The Tools popover appears, as shown in Figure 2-10.

2.	 Tap the Document Setup option.
	
	 You see a blueprint-like section that’s markedly different from the view 
you see when you edit an individual page. Note that this page will not 
rotate when you turn your iPad, it displays in portrait orientation only 
(see Figure 2-11).
Figure 2-11: Set up your document.
	
3.	 Tap a header or footer to customize it.
	
	 You can use the three footer sections to insert the author’s name, a title, 
the version number, or the page number, for example.
	
4.	 Type some text in the section of the header or footer that you want to 
customize.
	
5.	 To add page numbers to your document, tap in the header or footer 
section that you want to use for the page number; then tap the Page 
Numbers button in the contextual menu that appears.
	
	 This contextual menu is displayed only when you tap a header or footer.
	
	 You can choose the format of the page numbers, as shown in Figure 2-12.

Working with Selection Buttons
When you read this chapter from start to finish, you see various sets of 
selection buttons shown on the toolbar that appears whenever you press 
and hold in a document — and often shown with selected text. The buttons

vary depending on which element is selected. Some selection buttons may 
look familiar to you from other apps that you may have used on the iPad and 
the Mac (as well as on other types of computers), including the Cut, Copy, 
and Paste commands.
When you select a chunk of text, you may also see these options:
	
✓	Delete: Delete the selected text or object.
	
✓	Highlight: Highlight selected text with a felt-tip marker effect.
	
✓	Comment: Insert a comment where you can enter a note about items in 
your document or comment on the work of others that you’re reviewing.

N

umbers takes a different approach to the concept of spreadsheets. It 
brings to spreadsheets not only a different kind of structure but also 
data formats that you may never have seen. In addition to being able to use 
numbers and text in your spreadsheets, you can use on-off check boxes and 
star ratings as part of your data. Think of an inventory spreadsheet with 
check boxes for in-stock items and star ratings based on reviews or user 
feedback. What you may have thought of as just a bunch of numbers can 
now provide true meaning and context to users.
Numbers is a very practical addition to the other iWork apps. 
Tables and charts are built into both Keynote and Pages, but 
Numbers is the main number-crunching tool on the iPad.
In this chapter, you discover how Numbers helps orga­
nize data into manageable units. After you enter your 
data, you can display it in charts and graphs.
Introducing Numbers
When you create a Numbers document, you work 
with these three items:
	
✓	A Numbers document: A container for spreadsheets 
(sheets) and their data; similar to a Microsoft Excel 
workbook.
	
✓	One or more sheets: One or more spreadsheets called simply sheets.
	
✓	Tables: The sub-spreadsheets or tables created in other spreadsheet 
programs exist in Numbers as formal, structured tables rather than as a 
range of cells within a spreadsheet. Numbers gives them a specific 
name: tables. (And yes, a Numbers document can have no tables but 
must have at least one sheet.)

368
Introducing Numbers
The simple idea of making tables into an actual part of the Numbers appli­
cation rather than letting people create them any which way leads to a 
major change in the way you can use Numbers when compared to other 
spreadsheet programs. Because a table is an entity of its own and not a 
range of cells, you don’t break the tables you’ve organized in a spreadsheet 
when you reformat another part of the spreadsheet. You can work within 
any table, and you can reorganize tables within a sheet, but you can’t break 
tables by simply adding a row or column to your spreadsheet.
Figure 3-1 shows a Numbers for Mac template (Team Organization).
Figure 3-1: The Team Organization template in Numbers for Mac.
Figure 3-1 is a single document with four sheets visible in the tabs in the 
Sheets pane:
	
✓	Roster
	
✓	Schedule
	
✓	Statistics
	
✓	Budget
Some sheets contain tables or charts, and you see them listed in the Sheets 
pane under their corresponding documents. For example, the Roster sheet 
contains the Team Roster and Team Management tables (scroll down to see 
the Team Management table). The Budget sheet contains the Cost 

369
Book IV 
Chapter 3
Counting on 
Numbers
Introducing Numbers
Breakdown table as well as a chart (Team Costs). The idea that a single 
sheet can contain defined charts and tables that don’t depend on ranges of 
cells is the biggest difference between Numbers and almost every other 
spreadsheet program.
As you can see in Figure 3-1, sheets can also contain images and other graph­
ics; they aren’t part of the structure of charts and tables. You simply insert 
these elements the same way you insert any other objects in iWork 
documents.
You can select individual tables. A selected table has a frame with its column 
and row titles as well as other controls. Note also that each table within a 
sheet has its own row and column numbers (you can also name them, if you 
want) and that each table you deal with starts with cell A1. (The first row is 1 
and the first column is A.)
Various tools are available to you in the top-right corner of Numbers, as with 
other iWork apps. The buttons on this toolbar access settings for formatting 
tables; for inserting photos, charts, text, and shapes (see Figure 3-2); and for 
sharing documents and getting help.
Figure 3-2: The Insert popover in Numbers.
Numbers lets you insert charts along with tables on your sheets, as you see 
in Figure 3-3. (Remember that you can also insert graphics and other objects 
on your sheet.)

370
Using the Team Organization Template
Figure 3-3: You can use charts in Numbers, too.
Numbers also includes the ability to create forms, which simplify data entry. 
When you create a form, you select a table and you’re taken to a tab that dis­
plays each column heading with a text entry box next to it. You can then 
focus on entering data for one row at a time and eliminate the possibility of 
accidentally tapping and entering data in the wrong row. You can find more 
about forms in the “Using Forms Efficiently” section, later in this chapter.
Using the Team Organization Template
This chapter uses the Numbers Team Organization template to demonstrate 
Numbers features. You can create your own copy of the template so that you 
can follow along on your iPad, if you want. Sample data is part of the template, 
so you have data to work with, but you can add any other data you want. After 
you’ve experimented with Team Organization, you can pick another template, 
including the Blank template, and customize it for your own data.
To create your own copy of the Team Organization template, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Launch Numbers on the iPad.
	
2.	 Go to the Documents window.
	
	 If you had a spreadsheet open when you were last using Numbers, you 
return to that spreadsheet. Simply tap Spreadsheets at the top left to go 
to the Documents window.
	
3.	 Tap Create Spreadsheet.

	 Your new spreadsheet opens. Any changes you make are saved 
automatically.
Working with Tabs and Sheets
Every tab displays a sheet, which can have one or more tables or charts (or 
both) on it as well as graphics and text frames. Tabs help you organize the 
contents of your Numbers documents. In this section, I tell you what you 
need to know about setting up tabs in a document.
Adding a new tab
As with all iWork apps, starting a new Numbers document involves choosing 
a template. Each template has its own predefined tabs. The Blank template 
has only one tab (cleverly titled Sheet 1). You can add more tabs by using 
the plus sign (+) tab on the left end of the tabs (see Figure 3-4).
Figure 3-4: The plus sign (+) tab always appears to the left.
Tap the plus sign (+) tab, and Numbers asks whether you want to add a new 
sheet or a new form. Tap New Sheet, and Numbers creates a new tab that 
contains one table (see Figure 3-5). The sheet is labeled Sheet 1. See the sec­
tion “Changing a tab’s name,” later in this chapter, for how to rename the 
tab. (If you’re interested in forms, I tell you about that topic later in this 
chapter, in the “Using Forms Efficiently” section.)
Figure 3-5: Add a new sheet.

372
Working with Tabs and Sheets
Deleting or duplicating a tab
If you add a tab by mistake, you can remove it. Also, if you want to reuse a 
tab as the basis for a new tab, Numbers allows you to duplicate it. To per­
form either of these actions, tap and hold the tab you want to delete or 
duplicate, and a contextual menu appears below it (see Figure 3-6). All you 
have to do now is tap the option (Duplicate or Delete) for the action you 
want to take.
Figure 3-6: Duplicate or delete a tab.
	
Remember that a double-tap opens the tab so that you can edit its name. A 
single tap opens the tab’s content. A press-and-hold opens a contextual 
menu, if available.
Rearranging tabs
If you don’t like the order of your tabs, drag a tab to the right or left in the 
row of tabs to the desired new position, and then release your finger when 
the tab is in the position you want (see Figure 3-7).
Figure 3-7: Rearrange tabs.
Navigating tabs
If you have more tabs than can be shown on the screen, just swipe right or 
left to slide along the tabs. Remember to swipe in the row of tabs. Swiping 
the body of the sheet scrolls over to the right or left of the content on that 
sheet.
	
If you’re holding your iPad in portrait orientation, turn it to landscape orien­
tation to show more tabs on the screen.

Using Tables
Changing a tab’s name
Double-tapping text anywhere in Numbers allows you to edit the text. The 
same statement applies to tabs, too. Double-tap the name of a tab to begin 
editing it (see Figure 3-8). The onscreen keyboard appears, and you can 
delete the current name and enter a new one.
Figure 3-8: Edit a tab’s name.
Using Tables
Tables are at the heart of Numbers — they’re where you enter your data. 
This section shows you how to work with a table as a whole; the later sec­
tion “Working with Cells” shows you how to work with individual cells within 
a table.
Selecting a table
To be able to work on a table, you need to select it. If the table isn’t visible 
in the current tab, just tap the tab it’s in first. To select a table in Numbers, 
tap it.
	
If you need to find an entry within a table, it’s easy to do. Tap the Tools but­
ton (the wrench icon near the top-right corner) to open the Tools popover. 
Tap Find and enter a word or phrase; then tap Search on the keyboard to 
search the entire Numbers document for a match in that table.

374
Using Tables
When a table is selected, its appearance changes (see Figure 3-9). A selected 
table is framed with gray bars above (the column frame) and to its left (the 
row frame). To the left of the column frame, a button with concentric circles 
lets you move the table. To the right of the column frame, as well as beneath 
the row frame, are buttons, each with four small squares (looking a bit like 
table cells). These Cells buttons let you add rows, columns, or cells and 
manipulate the cells in the table. (See the later section “Working with Cells.”)
Figure 3-9: Select a table.
	
Select a table by tapping it once. Note that the location of your tap is 
important:
	
✓	If you tap in a cell, the table and that cell are selected.
	
✓	If you tap inside the table bounds but outside the cells, the table itself 
is selected. For example, if you tap the table’s title or the blank space to 
the left or right of the title, the table itself is selected. (Refer to 
Figure 3-9.)
Moving a table
You can move a table around on its sheet. Select the table and tap the round 
button to the left of the column frame. Then drag the table where you want 
it. (See Figure 3-10). Numbers shows you the absolute coordinates of the 
location you’re dragging to. Light-colored lines called guides help you align 
the table to other objects on the sheet. These lines appear and disappear as 
the table is aligned with the edges or centers of other objects.

375
Book IV 
Chapter 3

Using Tables
Figure 3-10: Relocate the table.
	
You can select several objects at the same time. Tap and hold the first object 
to select it, and then, while still holding down your finger, tap with another 
finger the other objects you want to add to the selection. After that, they 
move or resize together. (You may need to use two hands for this task.)
Cutting and pasting a table
You can select a table and then drag it around on a sheet by using the round 
button at the top left of the column frame; you can resize the table as 
described in the “Resizing a table” section, later in this chapter. But what if 
you want to place the table on a different sheet? To copy (or cut) and paste a 
table onto a different sheet, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the table by tapping the round button at the top left.
	
	 The Cut, Copy, and Delete tools appear, as shown in Figure 3-11.
	
2.	 Tap Cut from the selection buttons that appear.
	
3.	 Tap the tab of the sheet you want to add the table to.
	
4.	 Tap in the sheet (but not in an existing table).
	
	 This step brings up new selection buttons.
	
5.	 Tap Paste.
	
6.	 Move and resize the table as you want.

376
Using Tables
Figure 3-11: Select an entire table.
Adjusting columns or rows
If you’ve ever used a spreadsheet program, you know that data you enter doesn’t 
always fit into the default column and row sizes. In Numbers, you can select the 
columns or rows you want to work on and then rearrange or resize them.
	
Especially with spreadsheets that have lots of rows and columns, resizing 
can be easier when using a stylus.
Selecting a row or column
Tap in the row frame to select the corresponding row, as shown in 
Figure 3-12.

Using Tables
After you select a row or column, you can adjust the selection by dragging 
the handles (the round buttons) at the top and bottom for rows and at the 
left and right for columns, as shown in Figure 3-13.
Figure 3-13: Adjust a selection.
The selection buttons Cut, Copy/Paste, Delete, Hide, and Create Chart 
appear above a selected row, whereas Cut, Copy, Delete, Fill, or Comment 
appear above a selected cell. Figure 3-14 shows several cells selected 
within a column.
Figure 3-14: Select a few cells in a column.
The selection button you tap affects the selected column or cell.
For example, use the Merge selection button to merge selected cells in a col­
umn (or row).

378
Using Tables
Resizing a row or column
The two vertical lines (known as the Cells button) in the top-right corner of 
the column frame (refer to Figure 3-14) and the two horizontal lines in the 
bottom-left corner of the row frame (refer to Figure 3-12) let you resize the 
selected columns or rows. You always resize a column to its right and a row 
to its bottom, whether you’re making it larger or smaller. The contents are 
automatically adjusted, and the adjoining rows or columns are moved aside.
Moving a row or column
Sometimes, you want to rearrange the rows or columns in a sheet. With one 
or more rows or columns selected, press and drag it (or them) to a new posi­
tion. All selected rows or columns move as a unit, and the other rows or col­
umns move aside.
Resizing a table
You can resize a table in two ways: add or remove rows or columns to or 
from the table, or leave the number of rows and columns the same and 
change the overall size of the table. You may even want to do both.
Adding or removing rows and columns at the right or bottom
Tap the Cells button in the top-right corner of the column frame to add a 
new column at the right of the table. To add a new row at the bottom, tap the 
Cells button in the bottom-left corner of the row frame, and a new row is 
added to the bottom of the table.
To remove a blank column or row at the right side or bottom of a table, drag 
the appropriate Cells button to the left or to the top of the frame — the extra 
rows or columns disappear.
Adding or removing rows and columns inside the table
Select the row or column below or to the right of the new row or column. 
From the selection buttons, tap Insert to add a new row above the selected 
row or a new column to the left of the selected column.
Changing a table’s size
Select the table so that the handles (small blue dots) are visible at the right 
side and bottom. These handles work like any other resizing handles in 
Numbers: Simply drag them horizontally or vertically to change the table’s 
size. The content of the table automatically resizes to fit the new table size. 
The numbers of rows and columns remain unchanged, but their sizes may be 
adjusted.

Working with Cells
Double-tap a cell if you want to add or edit data. A blue outline appears 
around the cell, and the keyboard appears so that you can begin entering 
data.
Single-tap if you want to select a cell. The cell is outlined, and the table-selection 
elements (the column and row frames, the Cells button, the round button to the 
left of the column frame, and the button to the right of the column frame as well 
as the button beneath the row frame) appear.
	
A double-tap makes the cell available for editing. Figure 3-15 shows how, 
after a double-tap in a cell, the keyboard appears.
Figure 3-15: Start to edit a cell’s data.
After you set up your spreadsheet, most of your work consists of entering 
and editing data of all types. That’s what you find out about in the next 
section.

380
Working with Cells
Entering and editing data
The keyboard for entering data into a Numbers cell is a powerful and flexible 
tool — it’s four keyboards in one. Above the keyboard, the Formula bar lets 
you quickly and easily enter formulas. (Refer to Figure 3-15.) On the left of 
the Formula bar are four buttons that let you switch from one keyboard to 
another. You can choose these keyboards, starting from the left:
	
✓	Numeric (42 icon): Lets you use the numeric keyboard.
	
✓	Date and Time (clock icon): Lets you enter dates and times.
	
✓	Text (T icon): Displays the standard text keyboard.
	
✓	Formulas (= icon): Opens the formula-editing keyboard.
Whichever keyboard you’re using, you see the characters you’re typing in 
the Formula bar above the keyboard. To the right of the oblong area is a but­
ton labeled Done (or a check mark, depending on which keyboard you’re 
using) that moves your typing into the selected cell and then hides the 
keyboard.
The Dictation feature on iPad works in Numbers and the other iWork apps. 
Tap the Dictation key on the onscreen keyboard and speak your text; tap the 
key again to insert the text in your document.
	
You can bring up the keyboard when you double-tap a cell or another text 
field (such as a tab name). That means that the cell is selected and the key­
board knows where the data should go when you tap OK or Done.
	
Note that many of these features are unavailable on a Bluetooth keyboard, 
which may or may not have a number pad and special symbols used in 
entering formulas.
To the right of the keyboard in the numeric and date-and-time keyboards are 
three large keys:
	
✓	Delete: This is the standard keyboard Delete key.
	
✓	Next (adjacent): The Next key with the right-pointing arrow inserts the 
typed data into the selected cell and moves to the next cell to the right.
	
✓	Next (next line): The Next key with the hooked arrow pointing left and 
up inserts the typed data and moves to the next line and to the leftmost 
cell in the section of cells you’re entering. For example, if you start in the 
third column of the fourth row, the Next (next line) key moves you to the 
third column of the fifth row, not the first column.
Entering numeric data
The numeric keyboard (accessed by tapping the 42 button) has a typical 
numeric keypad along with four large buttons on the left (see Figure 3-16).

381
Book IV 
Chapter 3
Counting on 
Numbers
Working with Cells
Figure 3-16: Use these tools to input numeric data.
These four buttons let you choose the formatting for the cell you’re editing. 
If you need a symbol (such as stars for ratings or a currency symbol), it’s 
added before or after the numeric value as is appropriate. Your formatting 
options, from top to bottom, are described in this list:
	
✓	Currency: This option adds the appropriate currency symbol, such as $, 
£, or €.
	
✓	Percentage: The percent symbol follows the value.
	
✓	Stars (rating): This option lets you display a number from 1 to 45 as a 
star rating. Numbers greater than 5 display with five stars. To change 
the number of stars, type a new number or tap the star display in the 
cell or in the display above the keyboard. You can use stars in a spread­
sheet and then sort the column of stars so that the ratings are ordered 
from highest to lowest, or vice versa.
	
✓	Check box: A check box is either selected or not. Check boxes are 
selected and deselected by a user or as the result of a calculation.
Customizing check boxes
A check box can indicate, for example, that an item is in stock or out of stock 
(yes/no or true/false). However, you can also use it to represent numeric 
data. Computers and programs often represent nonzero and zero values as 
yes/no or true/false values. That’s one way you can use check boxes to track 
inventory. If you show the number of in-stock items in a cell, you can use a 
check box to indicate that none is in stock (a deselected check box) or that 
items are in stock (a selected check box). Numbers handles the conversion 
for you.

382
Working with Cells
Here’s how check box customization can work:
	
1.	 Double-tap a cell to start editing it; tap the 42 icon and then tap the 
Checkbox button when the keyboard opens.
	
	 You see a check box in the selected cell; in the area above the keyboard, 
you see the word false, as shown in Figure 3-17. The green outline distin­
guishes the word false from text you type in. It has the value false 
because, before you type anything, its numeric value is zero.
Figure 3-17: A check box starts as off and false.
	
2.	 Type a nonzero value.
	
	 This value can represent the number of items in stock, for example.
	
3.	 Tap the Checkbox button again.
	
	 You see that the value you typed changes to true (see Figure 3-18) and 
that the check box is selected in the table.
	
	 Because the formatting is separate from the data value, you can some­
times display the in-stock inventory count as a number and sometimes 
as the check box. Customers are likely to care only about the check box, 
but the inventory manager cares about the number.
Figure 3-18: A nonzero value is on and true.
Everything in Numbers is linked, so you don’t have to worry about a sequence 
for doing most things. If you’ve followed these steps, you’ve seen how to enter 
a number and have it control a check box, but that’s only one of at least three 
ways of working with a check box.
With a cell selected and the Checkbox formatting button selected, you see 
the true/false value above the keyboard and the check box itself in the table 
cell. Tap the check box in the table cell: The true/false value is reversed, as 
is the state of the check box itself.
Likewise, if you tap the word true or false in the display above the keyboard, 
the check box flips its value and true/false reverses.

Working with Cells
When you tap a formatting button, it turns blue and formats the number in 
the selected cell (or cells). You can tap another formatting button to switch 
to another format (from stars to a percentage, for example). Tapping a high­
lighted formatting button turns it off without selecting another.
Entering date/time data
Tap the clock button above the keyboard to enter date/time or duration 
data, as shown in Figure 3-19. The Date & Time button lets you specify a par­
ticular moment, and the Duration button lets you specify (or calculate) a 
length of time.
Figure 3-19: Enter date and time, or duration, data.
Above the keyboard, the units of a date or duration display. To enter or edit 
a date or time (or both), tap Month in the Formula bar and use the keypad to 
select the month. (The keys have both the month name abbreviations and 
the month numbers on them.) Similarly, tap any other time increment and 
enter a value. As you do so, the display changes to show the value. (Tapping 
AM or PM toggles the value — you don’t need to type anything.)
Entering text data
When you tap the T button to enter text, the standard QWERTY keyboard 
appears, as shown in Figure 3-20.
As with most onscreen keyboards, you can switch among letters, numbers, 
and special characters. (If you need a refresher on how to do it, see Book I, 
Chapter 2.) Everything you type or dictate is inserted into the selected cell 
until you tap the Done button, which is at the right of the display above the 
keyboard. If you enter a Return character, it’s part of the text in the cell. The 
cell automatically expands vertically to accommodate the text you type, and 
you can resize the column so that the cell is the appropriate size. Remember, 
these specialized features are not available on Bluetooth keyboards, so it’s 
often preferable to use the onscreen keyboard when using Numbers.

384
Working with Cells
Figure 3-20: Enter text.
Entering formulas
Tapping the equal sign (=) button lets you enter a formula, which automati­
cally computes values based on the data you type. The result of the formula 
can display in a cell in any of the usual formats, and that value can be used 
in a chart.
When you’re entering a formula, the four buttons controlling the date-and-time, 
text, and numeric keyboards disappear. In their place, a button with three dots 
appears. Tapping this button returns you to the display that gives you access 
to the other three keyboards. This setup is just a matter of Numbers saving 
space onscreen.
	
Formulas are accompanied by good news and bad news. The good news is 
that you don’t have to type many common formulas: Almost all spreadsheets 
have the same built-in list of formulas. The bad news is that the list of formu­
las is quite long.
Formulas can consist of numbers, text, dates, durations, and true/false ­values. 
They can also include the results of formulas and the values of individual cells.
The example in this section, which presents the basics of creating a simple 
formula in Numbers, adds a number to the value of an existing cell and 
then displays the result in the cell that contains the formula. In this exam­
ple, I use the Team Organization template that you see in the figures 
throughout this chapter.

	 The table’s column and row frames now contain row and column identi­
fiers. The columns are labeled A, B, C, and so on; the rows are labeled 1, 
2, 3, and so on. Every cell can be identified by its coordinates (such as 
A1 for the top-left cell).
	
	 Also note that at the right of the keyboard is a different set of buttons 
than on the text, date, and number keyboards. On the right side of the 
keypad, you’ll find four buttons that represent the following:
	
•	 Functions: Brings up a list of functions for use in formulas. (Refer to 
Step 3.)
	
•	 abc: Displays the text keyboard. You can type text and tap Done, and 
the text is added to the formula you’re constructing. You return to 
the formula keyboard.
	
•	 Date/Time: Takes you to the date-and-time keyboard. The date or 
duration you enter uses the same interface shown in Figure 3-19. 
When you tap Done, the date or duration is added to the formula, 
and you return to the formula keyboard.
	
•	 True/False: Uses the same interface as check boxes; the result is 
added to the formula you’re constructing, and you return to the for­
mula keyboard.
	
5.	 Add the game starting time to the formula.
	
	 Just tap the cell containing the game start time. The formula reflects the 
name of the table and the referenced cell. In this case, that reference is
C2
	
	 This references column C, row 2 in the Game Schedule table. You don’t 
have to type a thing — just tap, and the correct cell is referenced.
	
	 You now need the formula to add 2½ hours to the starting time.
	
6.	 Tap + from the operators on the left side of the keyboard.
	
7.	 Tap the Date/Time button on the right side of the keyboard and then 
tap the Duration button at the left.
	
8.	 On the Formula bar, tap Hours and enter 2.
	
9.	 Tap Minutes and enter 30.
	
	 Figure 3-23 shows what the screen looks like now.
	
10.	 Tap Done.
	
	 You’re done entering the duration. You return to the formula keyboard.
	
11.	 Finish the formula by tapping the button with a check mark on it.
	
	 Figure 3-24 shows the formula as it is now. Note that rather than seeing 
the Done button, as with other keyboards, you see a button with a check

mark and a button with an X at the right. The X cancels the formula, and 
the check mark completes it. If you want to modify the formula with the 
keys (including Delete) on the keyboard, feel free.

Using Forms Efficiently
Changing a cell’s content formatting
Your end time may include the date, which is probably not what you want. 
Here’s how to change the formatting of a cell’s contents:
	
1.	 Select the cell by making a single tap.
	
	 You can also select a cell and drag the highlighted selection to include 
more than one cell. Your reformatting affects all selected cells.
	
2.	 Tap the Format button at the top of the screen.
	
3.	 In the Format popover, tap the Information button to the right of Date 
& Time.
	
4.	 Tap the format you want to use in the selected cell or cells, or tap the 
arrow at the right of the format name to customize the format.
	
	 Not all formats have customizations.
To properly format the end time cell, you may want to remove the date. In 
the Date & Time Options popover, set the date option for None, as shown in 
Figure 3-25, and the time option for the hour.
Figure 3-25: Format the result.
Using Forms Efficiently
A form is a user-friendly way to provide input to a single row of a spread­
sheet. Because a form interacts with a table, you must create a table in your 
spreadsheet before you can create an associated form.
To create a form, tap the plus sign (+) tab on the left end of the row of tabs. 
You’re asked whether you want to create a new sheet or a form. (Refer to 
Figure 3-25.) Tap New Form, and you see a screen similar to the one shown in 
Figure 3-26, which uses the Team Organization template for the example.

Figure 3-26: Start to create a form.
You see a list of all the sheets and all the tables on them. Choose the one that 
the form will be used with. In this case, I’m using my Team Management table.
	
Every form is associated with only one table, and every table can be associated 
with only one form (though it doesn’t have to be associated with any forms).
The form is then created automatically, as shown in Figure 3-27.
Figure 3-27: Use a form to browse, enter, and delete data.

390
Working with New Tables
The labels for the rows on the form are drawn from the labels of the columns 
on the tables. You don’t have to label the columns on your tables, but it 
makes creating forms and calculations much easier if you do.
You can use the tab to go to the form and enter data or browse it. The four 
buttons at the bottom of a form let you (from left to right) go to the previous 
record (row), add a new row, delete the current row, or go to the next row.
	
You can delete a form by tapping the form’s tab and then tapping Delete, but 
you can’t duplicate a form as you can duplicate a sheet tab.
Working with New Tables
Tables contain the data for your spreadsheets and charts, so it may be a bit 
surprising if you’ve reached the end of the chapter without creating a single 
table. That’s because you have numerous templates to work with. You don’t 
have to start from the beginning; instead, you can start from further along in 
the development process.
Tables can be relatively small and focused. You can use formulas to link 
them, and that’s a much better strategy than putting every single piece of 
data into an enormous spreadsheet.
Tables aren’t simply repositories of data; they also drive charts. When you’re 
organizing data in a table, you may want to consider how to transform it to 
create the kind of charts you want.
As you’re planning the structure of your tables and sheets, pay attention to 
the moments when you realize that you have to add more data to a table. 
Ask whether you truly need more data in that table or need a table that can 
be linked to the first table by a calculation.
	
A table often has a header row above its data rows; the header row usually 
contains titles but may also contain calculations such as sums or averages. 
Numbers tables can have several header rows. A column to the left of the 
table also has the same functionality — it’s a header column. People often 
believe that a header appears only at the top, but in this usage, it appears on 
whichever side is appropriate.
Creating a new table
Follow these basic steps to create a new table:
	
1.	 Go to the sheet you want the table to be on.
	
	 It can be an existing sheet from a template or a new sheet you create just 
for the table. Remember that tables can be cut and pasted, so you have 
a second (and third and fourth and so on) chance to determine the 
sheet for your table.

2.	 Tap the Insert Objects button (the + button) in the toolbar at the top of 
the window.
	
	 The Insert Objects popover opens.
	
3.	 Tap the Tables tab.
	
4.	 Swipe from one page to another to find the table layout you like.
	
	 Though you can change any element in the table layout, start with one 
close to what you want to end up with.
	
	 There are five pages of templates — each of the five pages has the same 
layouts but with different color schemes. This list describes them from 
the upper-left corner, as shown in Figure 3-28:
	
•	 Header row and a header column at the left: This is one of the most 
common table layouts.
	
•	 Header row at the top: This one works well for a list such as students 
in a class.
	
•	 No header row or header column: Before choosing this blank spread­
sheet, reconsider. Headers and titles for the tables make your spread­
sheet more usable. You can add (or delete) them later and change 
them, but take a few moments to identify the table along with its 
rows and columns as soon as you create it.
	
•	 Header and footer rows and a label column: This one works well for titles 
at the top and left and for sums or other calculations at the bottom.
	
•	 Check boxes in the left column: This option makes a great list of 
things to do.

5.	 Tap the table layout you like.
	
	 It’s placed on the sheet you have open.
Changing a table’s look
Whether you recently created a new table or created it long ago, you might 
want to change its appearance. Here’s how:
	
1.	 Select the table you want to format (to select the table, tap inside the 
table bounds but outside the cells) and tap the Format button in the 
toolbar.
	
	 The Format popover opens, as shown in Figure 3-29. You can change the 
basic color scheme and layout by tapping the design you want to use.
Figure 3-29: Use Format to reformat a table.
	
2.	 Tap Table Options and fine-tune the table with a title, outline, and 
shading for alternating rows (see Figure 3-30).
	
	 Every table has a name. (It starts as Table #, with the next sequence 
number for all your tables.) The Table option simply controls whether 
the title is shown. Change the name to something meaningful that you 
can use in referencing it in formulas. Likewise, each table is a certain 
size. The Table Outline option determines whether a thin line is applied 
as the table’s border. In the Alternating Rows option, every other row is 
shaded with a contrasting color.
	
	 For large tables, alternating the shading of the rows can make it easier 
for users to follow the data.
	
3.	 Tap Grid Options to show or hide the cell dividers.
	
	 Many people think that showing the lines in the main table and hiding 
them in the headers looks best. Experiment. As you tap to turn options 
on or off, the display changes so that you can see the effect.

or the Smaller or Larger text size buttons to format the text in the 
table.
	
5.	 Tap Table in the popover and then tap the Headers tab to modify 
headers for rows and columns.
	
	 You can set the number of header rows or columns. (You have either 
zero footer rows or one footer row.) These elements are created using 
the existing color scheme.
	
	 Freezing rows and columns keeps the header rows and columns on each 
page. As you scroll the data, the data itself moves, but the headers never 
scroll out of sight. This option is often the best one unless the table’s 
content is self-explanatory.
	
6.	 When you’re finished, tap anywhere outside the popover to close it.

K

eynote, the first component created for iWork, was originally written 
for Steve Jobs to use in presentations at conferences and trade shows, 
including Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference and IDG Worldwide’s 
Macworld conferences. After these “trials by fire,” Keynote was joined by 
Pages to become the first two components of iWork.
Presentation software is a different type of product in comparison to the 
other two iWork applications. It typically consists of content presented by a 
speaker (whether in person or in absentia) to an audience.
With Keynote you have a few presentation possibilities. Small-
group or one-on-one presentations using iPads are made 
possible because you can easily present short but 
impressive presentations almost anywhere. In addi­
tion, you can connect the iPad to a projector or TV 
via a VGA adapter or HDMI adapter, and present to 
larger groups from a smaller machine. On iPad, you 
can also use the video-mirroring feature AirPlay and 
Apple TV to put your iPad display on your TV 
screen. If you choose to display a presentation to a 
single person or small group on the iPad itself and 
you have a third-generation (or later) iPad, you’ll find 
the Retina display a dazzling way to wow your 
audience.
In this chapter, you find out how to prepare and stage a presen­
tation using Keynote. After adding text to slides and using animated 
transitions, you’ll soon have a sophisticated and useful presentation.

Concepts to Consider before You Create a Presentation
Concepts to Consider before 
You Create a Presentation
A presentation is meant to be viewed. A person (usually you, but sometimes 
the viewer) controls the pace of the presentation. Follow these tips when 
building a presentation:
	
✓	Weigh small-group versus large-group presentations. You have options 
on iPad in addition to the traditional model of presenting to a group. 
This model offers an opportunity for one-on-one presentations that you 
can give in almost any setting, such as a sales call in a client’s office. If 
you’re working on a small-group or one-on-one presentation, the text 
and graphics don’t have to reach across a ballroom to the viewer’s eye, 
so size elements on the slide accordingly.
	
✓	Make use of existing content. Keynote for iOS helps you easily transfer 
presentations between your iPad and your Mac via iTunes. It also syncs 
its content via iCloud. Sometimes, that’s the right thing to do. You can 
reuse the slides and rearrange them (possibly splitting a large presenta­
tion into many). Restructuring and rearranging an existing Keynote pre­
sentation that’s going to be presented to a small group rather than to a 
larger audience can be a good idea.
	
✓	Consider your canvas. When working on a presentation, you’re using a 
small canvas. A slide has much less space to hold information than does 
a piece of paper (or a spreadsheet page). No matter how large your audi­
ence, never overcrowd your slides.
	
✓	Avoid too much variety. Using too many graphical object styles (such 
as illustrations, photos, and line drawings) or too many font styles (such 
as bold and underline) can make for a choppy-looking presentation. 
Luckily, Keynote themes help you provide a cohesive and clean look for 
your presentation. Even though you may make small changes to text and 
add graphics, try to maintain an overall look and feel.
	
✓	Add movement to slides. You have options for movement (see the 
“Using Transitions and Builds” section, later in this chapter) that you 
don’t have with printed documents. You can add effects to transition 
from one slide to another. Experiment with the Keynote transitions and 
use them to help people understand your progress in the presentation. 
For example, you can use a transition to introduce a new topic.
Getting Started with Keynote on iPad
You get started with the Keynote app the same way you do with Numbers or 
Pages: Create a new document or open an existing one. The basic windows 
are the same, but Keynote has some minor differences. This section is your 
guide.

Getting Started with Keynote on iPad
Navigating the Keynote screen
When you open (or create) a Keynote document (which is always presented 
in landscape orientation), the basic Keynote screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 4-1. The name of the document is centered on the toolbar at the top. 
At the left, the Presentations button returns you to the Documents window, 
where thumbnail images represent the first page of each of your saved files.
Figure 4-1: The basic Keynote screen.
On the right side of the toolbar (refer to Figure 4-1) are the usual buttons. 
The buttons, from left to right, are described in this list:
	
✓	Format: As always, this button lets you modify the selected object or 
objects. Your choices depend on which type of object is selected. (If 
nothing on the slide is selected, the button is grayed out.)
	
✓	Insert Objects: Lets you insert media such as photos, tables, charts, and 
shapes, as shown in Figure 4-2.

398
Getting Started with Keynote on iPad
Figure 4-2: Insert objects into slides.
	
✓	Tools: Shows you the popover you see in Figure 4-3. You can use various 
tools to add transitions and builds, find text in the presentation, work 
with Presenter Notes and presentation tools, work with Keynote’s inter­
nal settings, set a password to protect the Keynote document, print, or 
go to Help for assistance using the application.
Figure 4-3: Use the Keynote tools.
	
✓	Share: Share by using iCloud; sending a copy via AirDrop, Message, or 
Mail; or opening the presentation in another app in a format such as PDF 
or PowerPoint.

Getting Started with Keynote on iPad
	
✓	Play: Use this button to play your presentation on your iPad screen; if 
you have an external display adapter or Apple TV enabled in the Control 
Center, the slides appear on the display while the iPad screen shows the 
controls.
Tap Settings on the Tools menu to access the following tools (see Figure 4-4):
	
✓	Check Spelling: Turn on this option to have Keynote alert you to spell­
ing issues as you type.
	
✓	Slide Numbers: This option lets you turn slide numbers on and off. Just 
as with pages of a Pages document, you should let the app handle the 
numbering so that the slide (or page) numbers are correct even if you 
move elements around, delete slides, or add slides.
Figure 4-4: Use the advanced tools in Keynote.
	
✓	Guides: The Guides option on the Advanced menu makes a setting avail­
able to display guidelines that appear as you move an object toward the 
center of the slide or other objects, at the edges of the slide, or in 
10-percent increments horizontally and vertically along the slide. You 
can choose which style of guide you want to appear.
	
✓	Comments: Tap this selection to turn Comments off or on. When you 
turn them on, small yellow sticky notes appear in a presentation wher­
ever there’s a comment.
	
✓	Author Name: Tap this option to enter a name for Keynote to use in any 
comments you insert (see Figure 4-5).
	
One difference between Keynote and the other iWork apps is that it always 
appears in landscape (horizontal) orientation; as you rotate the iPad, the 
image doesn’t rotate because the slides are all designed to be shown hori­
zontally. It isn’t a Keynote limitation as much as a nod to the realities of pro­
jectors and other displays.

presentation and comments.
On the left side of the screen, in the navigator, are thumbnail views of the 
slides in your presentation. To go to any slide in your presentation, just tap 
its thumbnail.
Creating your first Keynote slide and adding text
The templates in all iWork apps provide you with useful starting points. In 
Keynote, you’re almost certain to find prebuilt slides you can use, and then 
it’s only a matter of organizing your own data. To create a presentation, fol­
low these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Keynote on the Home screen.
	
2.	 On the Documents window, tap the plus sign (+) to create your new 
presentation from a template or from another presentation, as 
described in Chapter 1 of this minibook.
	
3.	 Tap the Standard or Wide tab, depending on the appropriate scale of 
slides for your presentation, and then tap a theme to use it on your 
new presentation.
	
	 A new presentation based on that theme opens.

4.	 Double-tap a text placeholder on the slide to edit it.
	
	 The text placeholder opens for editing and the onscreen keyboard 
appears.
	
5.	 Enter any text you want and then tap the slide itself or the Hide 
Keyboard key in the bottom-right corner of the onscreen keyboard to 
close the keyboard when you’re done.
Formatting text
With Keynote — perhaps more than with the other iWork apps — it’s more 
fill-in-the-blanks than fuss around with formatting. You can get right to work. 
The font is determined by the theme you choose, but you can modify its size 
and add effects such as bold and italic. Here’s how:
	
1.	 Double-tap text to select the type you want to change.
	
2.	 Tap the Format button, and from the various tabs of the Format pop­
over, choose a text style option (Title or Subtitle, for example), and tap 
any of the formatting choices (Bold, Italic, Underline, or Strikethrough) 
to apply them to the selected text.
	
3.	 Tap anywhere else on the screen to hide the Format popover.
Adding a new slide
To add a new slide, tap the plus sign (+) in the lower-left corner (see Figure 4-6) 
and choose the style of slide from the gallery that appears. Want to add a bul­
leted list? Just choose a slide style with a bulleted list already on it.
Figure 4-6: Add a new slide.

402
Getting Started with Keynote on iPad
	
You can choose the layout for the slide you’re adding from the thumbnails 
shown in the popover. As Figure 4-7 demonstrates, the layouts for new slides 
vary from template to template.
Figure 4-7: Slides vary by template.
Adding media
Themes provide image placeholders for some slides. To change a place­
holder image, simply tap the Insert Objects button (shaped like a plus sign) 
in the lower-right corner of the current image. A popover opens, showing the 
various albums in the Photos app. Locate an item and tap to insert it.
If you want to add an image outside a placeholder, make sure that no place­
holder is selected and then tap the Insert Objects button. Tap any of the four 
tabs: Tables, Charts, Shapes, or Media. Choose the item you want to insert, 
and it appears on your slide.
You can now tap and move the object around with your finger. Keynote pro­
vides the coordinates for precise positioning and also provides you with 
guidelines as you align the object with the center of the screen or the edge of 
another object via rulers on the top and left side of the screen. To resize an 
object, drag a corner handle until it’s the size you want and then let it go.
Managing slides
Tap a slide in the navigator to select it. Tap the slide again to bring up the selec­
tion buttons shown in Figure 4-8. You can now take an action; for example, tap 
Delete, and the slide is gone. (Remember, if you make a mistake, just tap Undo at 

403

Using Transitions and Builds
the top left of the screen.) The Transition button brings up a selection of transi­
tion effects to apply (see the next section for more about this).
Figure 4-8: Delete a slide.
You can also use the contextual menu’s selection buttons to cut, copy, and 
paste slides. After you have cut or copied a slide (tap it twice and then tap Cut 
or Copy), tap the slide after which you want it to appear, and then tap Paste. 
(You always paste the contents of the Clipboard after the slide you select.)
Another option appears in the selection buttons: Skip. It collapses the 
selected slide in the navigator into a thin line. When you play the presenta­
tion, the slide is skipped over. The thin line in the navigator is big enough for 
you to tap it to bring up its selection buttons: Tap the Don’t Skip button to 
bring the slide back to full size and include it in the presentation.
	
Select the slide from the navigator. If you tap the slide itself, the selection 
buttons act on the selected object within the slide.
Using Transitions and Builds
You can enliven a presentation and make it a better communication tool by 
using Keynote animations to animate the transition as you move from one 
slide to another. You can also use animations to build a slide. Building refers to 
the process of applying an animation effect that controls how each bullet or 
another object within a single slide appears onscreen. The process of creating 
transitions and builds is much the same, and I cover them in this section.

404
Using Transitions and Builds
	
A little animation is a good thing. Feel free to try all the options, but then decide 
which one — or maybe two — you want for your presentation. Too many 
animations are distracting and compete with the content you’re presenting, 
unintentionally becoming the focus for the audience.
Working with transitions
Tap a slide and then tap Transition from the toolbar that appears (refer to 
Figure 4-8). Tap a transition effect, such as Clothesline. Tap the Options tab 
to make transition settings. To preview the transition, tap Play.
Transitions can work on slides as a whole or work on parts of slides; when 
they work on parts of slides, they’re often called builds. Note that a transi­
tion consists of two parts:
	
✓	Effects: These are the visual effects that are displayed.
	
✓	Options: Options include the direction in which the animation moves as 
well as whether it starts in response to a tap or when a previous transi­
tion is finished. Options also include the duration of the transition or the 
amount of delay before it starts.
Though a transition may appear to happen between two slides, it happens 
after you tap a slide to go to the next one. The transition is attached to the 
first slide in the sequence of two adjacent slides.
Here’s how to build a transition:
	
1.	 In the navigator on the left side of the screen, press and hold the slide 
for which you want to build a transition and tap Transition in the 
tools that appear.
	
	 The list of transition effects appears in a popover, as shown in Figure 4-9. 
A number of transition effects are available; swipe up and down to see 
them all. (The list of transitions is controlled by the Effects button at the 
bottom-left corner of the popover.)
	
2.	 When you find a transition effect that interests you, tap the name and 
then tap Play to select it and see a preview.
	
3.	 Tap the Options button in the bottom-right corner of the popover (see 
Figure 4-9) to set the effect options, as shown in Figure 4-10.
	
4.	 Set the duration and when the effect should start.
	
	 If you want the effect to start after a delay of a certain duration, use the 
Delay setting.

Figure 4-10: Set the duration 
and start.
	
5.	 Continue to change the effects and options until you’re satisfied.
	
	 Options vary depending on the effect you’ve selected. You’ll probably 
want to try the combinations by tapping the Play button in the upper-
right side of the popover several times.
	
6.	 Tap Done in the upper-right corner of the screen to apply the transi­
tion and return to the navigator.
	
	 After you apply a transition effect to a slide, the Transitions button 
appears next to the slide whenever you select that slide in the navigator 
(see Figure 4-11). You can tap the Transition option to open the 
Transitions popover to edit the effect.

406
Using Transitions and Builds
Figure 4-11: The effect is indicated on the slide in the navigator.
Working with builds
Builds are much like transitions except, rather than occurring between 
slides, they work when elements within a single slide are displayed and con­
trol how those elements appear on the slide. For example, you might build a 
bulleted list displaying one bullet at a time. Here’s how to set a build:
	
1.	 In the display portion of the screen, tap the object you want to build.
	
	 Each object can have two sets of builds: effects used when the object 
appears and an effect when it disappears.
	
2.	 Tap to choose the type of build you want to apply — either a build-in 
or a build-out, as shown in Figure 4-12.
	
3.	 Select the build effect you want to use, as shown in Figure 4-13.
	
	 As with slide-to-slide transitions, as soon as you select an effect, tap the 
Play button and the effect previews for you.
	
4.	 Tap the Options button at the bottom of the popover to set options, as 
shown in Figure 4-14.
	
	 You can begin the build when you tap or after the previous object 
appears. You can also set a delay in seconds before the next step in the 
build begins. Note that a number in a yellow circle is created on the 
object you’re applying the build to; you can tap the number later to go 
back and change the effect or options.

5.	 Tap the Delivery button at the bottom of the popover to select 
whether the build happens all at one time or with the addition of each 
component.
	
	 Depending on what the selected object is, this step can build each item 
in a bulleted list separately or each wedge in a pie chart in sequence. 
(Delivery options are not available if they don’t apply.)

Managing multiple builds on a single slide
As you create builds, each one is numbered. The numbers appear in small, 
yellow circles as soon as you have chosen an effect. You can manage the 
sequence of these builds. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the appropriate slide, tap the Tools button, and then tap 
Transitions and Builds.
	
	 You see the yellow circles around the numbers of the builds on that slide 
(see Figure 4-15).

	 The yellow circle for a build is shown in Figure 4-16. You can see two 
transitions for the selected object. In this case, transition 2 is the build-
in, and transition 1 is the build-out. (That happens to be the order they 
were created in, but they don’t have to be in that order.) Thus, you can 
separately tap either transition number to change its settings or even 
delete it if you’ve gone transition-crazy.
Figure 4-16: Edit an existing build.
	
3.	 To reorder the builds, tap a build number and then tap the Order but­
ton in the bottom-right corner of the popover (see Figure 4-17).
	
	 Drag builds to arrange them in the order you want them executed (see 
Figure 4-17). The numbers automatically change. Keynote picks up iden­
tifying text, such as the title, so that you can keep them straight.
	
4.	 Tap the Play button in the top-right corner of the popover to test the 
builds.
	
5.	 When you’re satisfied, tap Done.

Preparing to Present
After you’ve dotted every i and crossed every t in your presentation, added 
all the great ideas you’ve been storing in your brain, and tweaked the anima­
tions, your presentation is done. However, you still have to prepare to pres­
ent your presentation.
Using a projector
The cable known as the Lightning to VGA Adapter ($49 from the Apple Store) 
connects your iPad to any VGA device, such as a projector. With it, you can 
use Keynote to give your presentation. There’s also a $39 version for older 
iPad Dock connectors.
	
The Digital AV Adapter cable accessory is available for $49 for the Lightning 
version and $39 for the Dock version. You can use it to connect to devices 
such as HDTVs and many projectors that have HDMI connectors.
When you connect a projector (or any other type of display) to your iPad 
with the HDMI or VGA adapter, the Keynote app can sense that it has a sec­
ond display. It uses this display when you start a slideshow in the Keynote 
app. (See the “Playing Your Presentation” section, later in this chapter.) 
While it’s sending the presentation to the external display, it lets you control 
it from your iPad. Figure 4-18 shows what you see on the iPad as it plays a 
presentation on an external display.

Chapter 4

Preparing to Present
Figure 4-18: Control a presentation on an external display.
The slides appear on the external display, but you can control the presenta­
tion using your iPad. On the left side of the screen, a navigator shows thumb­
nail images of your slides. Being able to see the next slide helps you 
transition to it elegantly without shuffling papers and distracting your audi­
ence and yourself. You can tap the arrows in the center of the iPad screen to 
move forward and backward among slides.
You can also mirror or stream what’s on your iPad screen using an Apple TV 
connected to your HDTV’s HDMI port.
Mirroring shows what’s on your screen, such as a Keynote slide. You can 
zoom in and out and rotate your screen on your iPad, and that’s what you’ll 
see mirrored on your TV. As you move through your Keynote presentation 
on your iPad, the presentation on the TV changes right along with it.
Using nanopresentations
iPad is a game-changer in many ways. Its size (and therefore its portability) 
and its remarkably clear screen (especially on third-generation or later iPads 
with Retina display) are only two of its features that open great new oppor­
tunities. Keynote for iOS can help you take advantage of nanopresentations 
(presentations you make one-on-one or to a small group of people).
Whether you’re used to presentations as a presenter or an audience 
­member, you’ll probably be pleasantly surprised at how well presentations 
to small groups can work. Perhaps the most interesting difference is the 

412
Preparing to Present
simplest one: Because the speaker can sit down and join the audience 
around a table, in a circle, or in a group of chairs, the speaker/audience or 
teacher/student paradigm of many presentations is immediately broken — 
and this can be a breath of fresh air. It certainly seems to make discussions 
and audience questions livelier.
For presentations to large (or even medium-size) groups, your iPad and a 
projector work well. But for a smaller group, a projector is often a bit of over­
kill. You can use your iPad for a presentation to a few people seated around 
a table or — to be more iPad-like — seated or standing anywhere they want.
Think about the possibilities. If you’re selling something that’s not easy to 
carry around, a photo album on your iPad is a helpful way to show prospec­
tive customers what you’re talking about. But a Keynote presentation — 
even a handful of slides shown one-on-one — can be much more effective 
and impressive than a photo album or brochure.
Great presentation pointers
Here are a few presentation pointers:
	✓	Avoid the dark. If you’re using a projector, 
use the least possible amount of room-
darkening for your presentation. Make 
certain you can see your audience.
	✓	Use question-and-answer sections. Use 
frequent, short Q&A sections in your 
presentations to involve your audience as 
much as possible.
	✓	Use a road map. Let people know where 
they’re going in your presentation and 
where they are at any moment. When you’re 
reading a book, the heft of the unread pages 
gives you an idea of how far you’ve come. 
With a presentation, one slide after another 
can come out of the dark with no clue to 
how each one fits into the presentation.
	✓	Use big font sizes. Have you ever looked 
closely at the presentations given by the 
late Steve Jobs and others at Apple? 
Consider using 60 points for the font size. 
Whether you’re creating your Keynote 
presentation on a Mac or an iPad or using 
iWork for iCloud with your browser, you’re 
probably close to the screen. Your audi­
ence will be far away (even if you’re just 
sitting across a table from them). In addi­
tion, you may have become accustomed to 
using font sizes that print well. Those font 
sizes are smaller than sizes that appear 
well on a screen. Go big.
	✓	Buy a dock or cover for your iPad that acts 
as a stand. Several iPad cover options let 
you prop up your iPad display so that some­
body sitting across from you can get a good 
view of its screen. Check out the Apple iPad 
accessories section in the online store, or 
search for iPad covers at a search engine 
and find one that appeals to you.
	✓	Check out the physical setup.  Leave time 
to check out your equipment and space 
before the presentation to make sure 
everything works properly.

Book IV 
Chapter 4
Presenting Keynote
Playing Your Presentation
Are you canvassing door to door for a politician or a cause? Again, a Keynote 
presentation of perhaps half a dozen slides can present the issue with pic­
tures, text, and diagrams. You can even hand a printed version of the presen­
tation out for people to ponder after you’ve gone. You can fill in the gaps and 
answer questions, but it’s certainly more effective than knocking on a door 
and asking whether you can come in and set up a computer and a projector.
	
One great advantage of nanopresentations is that instead of talking to a large 
group that’s sitting in the dark, you’re presenting to a few people sitting 
around a table or on a sofa with you. People generally don’t have enough 
time to doze off or become distracted.
Playing Your Presentation
After you prepare all the elements in your presentation, little remains to do 
when you want to play it. Tap the Play button at the right side of the toolbar 
to begin playing. The transitions and builds happen automatically.
Tap to advance to the next slide. If you’re using an external monitor, tap the 
Next and Previous buttons. (Refer to Figure 4-18.)
If your presentation contains hyperlinks, simply tap to open them in Safari 
on iPad. (Keynote automatically detects hyperlinks by the presence of an 
Internet schema, such as http://.)
The Keynote app has a built-in laser pointer, so to speak: Tap and hold the 
iPad screen, and a red pointer appears on the display along with a set of 
pointers that use other colors. (If you’re using an external display or projec­
tor, it appears on that display as well.) You can then emphasize parts of the 
slide to the audience. One advantage of this method is that you can continue 
to face your audience while pointing out details on the slides. The alterna­
tive is to walk over to the slide, turn your back on the audience, and 
point — not an outstanding idea. (Audience members sometimes sneak out 
the moment you turn your back.)

Chapter 1: Managing 
Files and Printing
In This Chapter
✓	Understanding how iPad stores files
✓	Sharing files by emailing, AirDrop, or through the cloud
✓	Setting up Home Sharing
✓	Printing wirelessly from iPad
O

kay, I’m going to be very upfront about this: Apple has not used a tra­
ditional paradigm for moving files to and from your iPad or managing 
files on the device. In essence, this is partially a chapter about the following:
	
✓	What iPad does differently from how traditional file management is han­
dled by OS interfaces such as OS X’s Finder or Windows Explorer 
(Windows 7 and earlier) or File Explorer (Windows 8 and later). (For 
brevity, I just refer to this feature using the Windows 8 nomenclature, 
File Explorer, in the rest of this chapter.)
	
✓	How you can get things in and out of the device without 
a USB port or DVD drive.
One exciting way to back up content is iCloud, which 
allows you to store content online, and I discuss that 
in this chapter as well as in Book I, Chapter 5. In 
addition, you can share content with somebody in 
close proximity by using the AirDrop technology.
The other topic in this chapter is printing, and there 
are two options here: Use iPad’s native printing 
capability with a compatible wireless printer or use a 
third-party printing app.
Finding Your Files
iPad stores files locally by app, or if you use iCloud, iPad automatically 
stores and shares files among iOS devices and with your Mac or PC. Here’s 
how this works.

418
Finding Your Files
How iPad stores files
Though there’s no Mac Finder or Windows File Explorer on iPad where you 
can view all your stored files in one place, apps on iPad do store files. Open 
the Photos app, for example, and you see lots of photos, each one contained 
in a separate file. The Music app contains audio files, Videos contains movie 
files, iBooks contains e-book files, and if you own Pages, it contains word-
processing documents (as shown in Figure 1-1), and so on.
Figure 1-1: Documents stored by Pages.
	
Though there’s no Windows File Explorer feature on iPad, when you connect 
iPad to a PC, you can use the Windows File Explorer feature on your com­
puter to view the files stored on your iPad.
How did those files get there? You may have created them in an app on your 
iPad; you may have downloaded them from the Internet, as with music or 
video purchases from iTunes; or you may have synced them from your com­
puter or had them pushed to all your iOS devices from iCloud, as with music 
files or photos. Perhaps you grabbed a document from a website or from an 
online storage service such as Dropbox.
Depending on the app you open, you may see a Documents button to display 
thumbnails of documents (refer to Figure 1-1); libraries of photos, as in 
Photos; albums of music or individual song files, as in Music (see Figure 1-2); 
or bookshelves or lists of e-books, as in iBooks. Each app offers a slightly dif­
ferent way to find whatever you’ve created on, downloaded to, or synced to 
your iPad.

419

Sharing Files
Figure 1-2: Music shows you files by album, song, composer, artist, 
and more.
	
See Book II, Chapter 1, for information about buying and downloading con­
tent, and see Book I, Chapter 5, for information about syncing to your com­
puter and buying apps. Book IV, Chapter 1, gives some details about moving 
files around for use with iWork products.
Going with iCloud
iCloud isn’t so much a place as it is a storage service. If you choose to back 
up or share files by using iCloud, you can’t go to a website and organize 
those files. Rather, they’re automatically backed up from your devices, and 
new files created or downloaded to one device are automatically pushed to 
your other devices. In essence, this process is invisible to you. You still 
access these files by opening the associated app.
	
Note that iCloud Drive, which released just as this book was going to press, will 
eventually replace simple iCloud storage. iCloud Drive includes storage, calen­
dar and contact syncing capabilities, email, location services, and app sharing.
Sharing Files
As mentioned in the previous section, iPad doesn’t let you get at files the 
way your computer does with a series of folders and files. You open files in 
individual apps, such as Photos and Videos. You can’t save files to a storage 
medium, such as a flash drive that you can remove and place in another 
computing device. Therefore, managing and sharing your files with other 
devices or other people works a bit differently on your iPad.

420
Sharing Files
You have a few options for getting files out of your iPad:
	
✓	Sync them via iCloud, which automatically pushes them to other iOS 
devices.
	
✓	Email them.
	
✓	Sync via iTunes with a computer to share things like calendar events, 
contact records, music, or photos, which is covered in Book I, Chapter 5.
	
✓	Share them over a network.
	
✓	Share them with somebody in close proximity using AirDrop.
Also consider using wireless devices from manufacturers such as Kingston 
or Maxell for external storage.
Relying on good old email
You can use tools in individual applications to email files to yourself or oth­
ers. Emailing files to yourself can be useful if you’ve worked on a document 
on your iPad and then want to get a copy of it on your computer. You can’t 
exactly save a copy because (remember) no removable storage medium 
exists on your iPad, so you email the file and open and save the email attach­
ment to your computer hard drive or other storage.
Here’s an example of emailing from an app; in this case, Photos:
	
1.	 Open Photos and locate a picture you want to email.
	
2.	 Tap the picture to open it and then tap the Share button to display the 
Sharing popover shown in Figure 1-3.
Figure 1-3: View the several options for sharing.

421
Book V

3.	 Tap Mail.
	
	 The email form shown in Figure 1-4 appears.
Figure 1-4: The email form and onscreen keyboard appear 
together.
	
4.	 Fill out the email form and tap Send to get the email on its way to 
yourself or somebody else.
Getting up close with AirDrop
To use the AirDrop feature, you need to be near another AirDrop–enabled 
device (I’m talking within a few feet). Then, as in the previous email example, 
you can use the Share popover from within an app. (Refer to Figure 1-3.) Tap 
AirDrop in that popover, and any eligible devices in your vicinity appear. Tap 
the device you want to share with, and the content appears on the other 
device when the recipient accepts it.
That’s it!
Going through the cloud
In addition to iCloud, there are other cloud-based options for sharing files. 
Apps such as Dropbox and FileFly, and Easy Wi-Fi Sharing and Viewing (a 
wireless file-sharing app) allow you to upload files to an online site and, 
using an app you download to your iPad, access and view those files. Some 
of these options provide more flexibility for managing your files than iCloud 
does.
Take a look at how this works with Dropbox, which is a good, free, file-sharing 
app that provides one of the easiest ways to get any and all files to and from 
your iPad to any and all other computers and devices.

422
Sharing Files
Dropbox is a cloud-based service that allows you to store your files on its 
servers and access them on any device that’s connected to the Internet. 
(Figure 1-5 shows you what the Dropbox interface looks like if you surf there 
using Safari.) It directly supports (in the form of dedicated software) OS X, 
Windows, Linux, Android, BlackBerry, and of course, iOS.
Figure 1-5: Accessing Dropbox through Safari.
When you’re on a computer, Dropbox works like any other folder on your 
hard drive. When you open it with your browser, you have instant access to 
all your files. When you drop something into your folder, it’s copied to the 
company’s servers, and then pushed out to anywhere you’ve set up with 
your Dropbox account, including your iPad or others you’re sharing folders 
with.
After you download the Dropbox app, you can open a file on iPad and print 
or view it, but not edit it, unless you choose the option of opening the docu­
ment with an app you have on your iPad that would be a logical fit. Figure 1-6 
shows the iCloud app for iPad with shared photos from iPad’s Photos app 
available; this feature is offered to you the first time you log in to Dropbox 
from the Dropbox app on your iPad.
	
Dropbox folders can be selectively shared with other Dropbox users, making 
it a great tool for any sort of collaborative project.

Setting Up Home Sharing
With Home Sharing, you can stream content from any Mac or PC to your iPad 
directly. You simply set up Home Sharing on your iPad, turn on the feature in 
iTunes on your computer, and you’re good to go.
Here are the steps for setting up Home Sharing when you’re connected to a 
Wi-Fi network:
	
1.	 On your computer, open iTunes.
	
2.	 Click the File menu and choose Turn On Home Sharing.
	
	 The Home Sharing dialog appears.
	
3.	 Enter your Apple ID and password and then click Create Home Share.
	
	 A message appears, telling you to use the same account you just signed 
in to on devices you want to share with.
	
4.	 Click Done.
	
5.	 On your iPad, tap Settings and then tap Music.
	
6.	 In the Home Sharing section, shown in Figure 1-7, enter your Apple ID 
for the same account you used in iTunes on your computer and, 
beneath the ID, enter a password.

8.	 Tap Songs and then tap a shared song to download it from the cloud.
	
	 To view shared videos, follow the same procedure for Videos settings 
and the Videos app.
Printing from iPad
If you need to print from your iPad, you can use its built-in wireless printing 
capability or a third-party app, which is likely to give you a few more print­
ing controls.
Native printing capability is part of iPad’s bag of tricks. This capability 
requires a wireless-enabled printer that supports the AirPrint protocol. All 
the major printer manufacturers offer AirPrint–compatible printers, includ­
ing HP, Epson, Canon, Brother, and Lexmark, so check to see whether your 
model has such support.
The only control you have over your printing is to set the number of copies 
to be printed; with some printers, you can also specify a page range and 
double-sided printing. You can also use an app such as Printopia or AirPrint 
Activator 2 on your computer to print through that computer from iPad to 
shared and networked printers, whether wireless or wired.

When you have print jobs going to your printer, you can access a Print 
Summary popover that shows the name of the document that’s printing, the 
printer it’s printing to, the number of copies, when the print job started, and 
its status (for example, Printing 1 of 3). You access this summary by double-
tapping the Home button to open the App Switcher. There, scroll to the left 
in the list of apps to locate the Print Center app. Tap it, and the summary 
displays.

N

otes is a preinstalled app that you can use to do everything from jot­
ting down notes at meetings to maintaining to-do lists. It isn’t a robust 
word processor like Apple Pages or Microsoft Word by any means, but for 
taking notes on the fly or dictating a poem using the Dictation feature (not 
available on the original iPad or iPad 2) while you sit and sip a cup of tea on 
your deck, it’s a useful option.
In this chapter, you discover how to enter and edit text in Notes and manage 
notes by navigating among them, searching for content, sharing, deleting, 
and printing them.
Making Notes
Notes are pretty simple to create — kind of like grab­
bing a sticky notepad, jotting down your thoughts, 
pulling off the note and sticking it somewhere, and 
starting to write the next one. You can even use Siri 
to create a note and the Dictation feature to speak 
your note contents. You can use the included edit­
ing tools to select, cut, copy, and paste. Notes are 
saved for you in a list of notes so that you can easily 
find the one you need (covered in the “Finding Notes” 
section, later in this chapter), and they can be synced 
across iOS devices and your Mac.
Opening a blank note and entering text
If you have no stored notes, Notes opens with a new, blank note displayed. 
(If you have used Notes before, it opens to the last note you worked on. If 
that’s the case, tap the New Note button in the top-right corner to create a 
new, blank note.)

428
Making Notes
Here are the steps to get going with Notes:
	
1.	 Tap the Notes app icon on the Home screen.
	
	 Depending on how you have your iPad oriented, you see the screen 
shown in Figure 2-1 (portrait) or Figure 2-2 (landscape).
	
2.	 Tap the blank page.
	
	 The onscreen keyboard, shown in Figure 2-3, appears.
	
3.	 Tap keys on the keyboard to enter text.
	
	 If you’re using a third-generation (or later) iPad or an iPad mini, tap the 
Dictation key — see Figure 2-3 — and speak your text using iPad’s 
speech recognition feature).
	
	 For more about Dictation, see Book I, Chapter 3.

430
Making Notes
Here are some tips for working with the virtual keyboard:
	
	
•	Enter numbers or symbols. Tap the keys labeled .?123 on either side of 
the keyboard. The numeric keyboard, shown in Figure 2-4, appears. 
When you want to return to the regular keyboard, tap either of the keys 
labeled ABC.
Figure 2-4: Use this alternative keyboard for numbers and many 
common symbols.
	
•	Capitalize a letter. Tap the Shift key and then tap the letter.
	
	If you turn on the Enable Caps Lock feature in Settings, you can also turn 
on Caps Lock by double-tapping the Shift key; tap the Shift key once to 
turn off the feature.
	
•	Start a new paragraph or the next item in a list. Tap the Return key.
	
•	Edit text. Tap to the right of the text you want to edit and tap the Delete 
key to delete text to the left of the cursor or enter new text.
	
•	Change the default font. Go to the Notes Settings.
	
	Tap either of the keys labeled #+= to access more symbols, such as the 
percentage sign, the euro symbol, and additional bracket styles. Tapping 
and holding some of these keys displays alternative characters. This 
also works on some keys on the alphabetic and numeric keyboards. (For 
example, tapping and holding N gives you foreign language options such 
as the Spanish ñ, and pressing and holding the exclamation key on the 
numeric keyboard offers the upside-down exclamation point used in 
some languages.)

No need to save a note — it’s automatically kept until you delete it.
Creating a new note
If you have stored notes, when you open Notes, the most recently used note 
displays. If you then want to create a new note, it’s a simple procedure. To 
create a new note, tap the New Note button (the one that looks like a page 
with a pen on it) in the top-right corner. The current note is saved and a new, 
blank note appears (refer to Figures 2-1 and 2-2). Enter and edit text as 
described in the preceding section.
	
If your iPad is in portrait orientation and you want to display the list of saved 
notes beside the current note, tap the Notes button to view a list of notes.
Using copy and paste
Let’s face it, most of us don’t nail what we write on our first draft. That’s 
why, after you enter content into a note, you may want to modify it. The 
Notes app includes essential editing tools you’re familiar with from using 
word processors: Select, Copy, and Paste. You can use these to duplicate 
content or to cut and paste it from one part of a note to another.
To use the Copy and Paste tools, follow these steps:
	
1.	 With a note displayed, press and hold your finger on a word.
	
	 The selection tools, shown in Figure 2-5, appears.
Figure 2-5: This menu provides selection and pasting tools.

432
Finding Notes
	
2.	 Tap the Copy button.
	
3.	 Press and hold your finger in the document where you want to place 
the copied text.
	
4.	 On the menu that appears (see Figure 2-6), tap the Paste button.
	
	 The copied text appears.
Figure 2-6: Use the press-and-hold method again to display the 
editing menu.
	
If you want to select all text in a note to either delete or copy it, tap the 
Select All button in the menu (refer to Figure 2-5). All text is selected, and 
you can select commands from the menu that appears to cut, copy, or paste 
the selected text.
	
To delete text, you can use the Select or Select All command and then press 
the Delete key on the onscreen keyboard.
Finding Notes
After you create a note, you need to find it if you want to view or edit it. You 
can scan the Notes List to find a note or use the Search tool. You can also 
swipe on the Notes pad to move among notes. The following sections help 
you find and move among notes you’ve created.

Finding Notes
Displaying the Notes List
The Notes List contains all your notes listed chronologically by the last date/
time you modified the note. This list isn’t available in portrait orientation, 
but it’s the list you need in order to see the notes you have stored. If you’re 
using landscape orientation, a list of notes appears by default on the left side 
of the screen.
If you’re using portrait orientation, you can display this list in portrait orienta­
tion by tapping the Notes button in the top-left corner of the screen; the Notes 
List appears, as shown in Figure 2-7. Tap any note in the list to display it.
	
The Notes List is also the Accounts List if you’ve enabled notes syncing in 
iCloud or other sharing sites in Settings.
Figure 2-7: Tap the Notes button to display a list of saved notes.
Moving among notes
If you want to look for a note based on how long ago you created it, you 
should know that notes are stored with the most recently created or modi­
fied notes at the top of the Notes List. Older notes fall toward the bottom of 
the list. The date and/or time you last modified a note also appears in the 
Notes List to help you out.
It’s easy to move among notes you’ve created:
	
1.	 Tap the Notes app on the Home screen to open it.
	
2.	 With the Notes List displayed, tap a note to open it.
	
	 You can display the Notes List by either turning iPad to landscape orien­
tation or tapping the Notes button in portrait orientation; see the pre­
ceding section for more on viewing the Notes List.
	
Notes isn’t a file-management pro; it allows you to enter multiple notes with 
the same title, which can cause confusion. Be advised, and name your notes 
uniquely!

434
Finding Notes
	
Remember that Notes names your note using the first line of text. If you want 
to rename a note, first display the note, tap at the end of the first line of text, 
and then tap the Delete key on your onscreen keyboard to delete the old title. 
Enter a new title; it’s reflected as the name of your note in the Notes List.
Searching Notes
If you’re not sure which note contains that very important item, you can 
search to locate a note that contains certain text. The Search feature lists 
only notes that contain your search criteria; however, it highlights only the 
first instance of the word or words that you enter within a note.
	
The Spotlight Search feature in iPad also locates notes that match any 
search term you enter there, along with many other types of content. See 
Book I, Chapter 2, for more about the Search feature.
Follow this procedure to use the Notes Search feature:
	
1.	 Tap the Notes app on the Home screen to open it.
	
2.	 Either hold the iPad in landscape orientation or tap the Notes button 
in portrait orientation to display the Notes List. (Refer to Figure 2-7.)
	
3.	 Tap in the Search field at the top of the Notes List. (See Figure 2-8.)
	
	 The onscreen keyboard appears.

Keyboard Dock.

4.	 Begin to enter the search term.
	
	 All notes that contain matching words appear on the list, as shown in 
Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9: The Search feature narrows the results by words that 
match your entry.
	
5.	 Tap a note to display it and then locate the instance of the matching 
word, which is highlighted with a yellow background. Tap the item 
again to highlight subsequent occurrences of the search term.
Sharing a Note
Today, it’s all about sharing content. If you want to share what you wrote 
with a friend or colleague, or even access your note on your main computer 
to move it over into a word-processing program and flesh it out, you can eas­
ily share the contents of a note by following these steps:
	
1.	 With a note displayed, tap the Share button on the top of the screen.
	
2.	 In the pop-up menu that appears, tap Mail.
	
	 You can also share using AirDrop by tapping that button and then tap­
ping on the nearby device you want to send the note to at this point.
	
3.	 In the email form that appears (see Figure 2-10), type one or more 
email addresses in the appropriate fields.
	
	 At least one email address must appear in the To, Cc, or Bcc field.

436
Deleting Notes
Figure 2-10: Enter addressees; use Bcc if you don’t want that recipient 
to be visible to others.
	
4.	 If you need to make changes to the subject or message, tap in either 
area and make the changes by using either the onscreen keyboard or 
the Dictation key (on a third-generation or later iPad) to speak your 
changes.
	
5.	 Tap the Send button.
	
	 Your email is sent.
	
If you want to print a note in Step 2, tap Print rather than Mail. Complete the 
Printer Options dialog by designating an AirPrint–enabled wireless printer 
(or a shared printer on a network that you can access using AirPrint) and 
indicating how many copies to print; then tap Print.
	
To cancel an email message and return to Notes without sending it, tap the 
Cancel button in the email form and then tap Delete Draft on the menu that 
appears. To leave a message but save a draft so that you can finish and send 
it later, tap Cancel and then tap Save Draft. The next time you tap the Mail 
button with the same note displayed in Notes, your draft appears.
Deleting Notes
Over time, notes can accumulate, making it harder to find the note you need 
in the long list that displays. There’s no sense in letting your Notes List get 
cluttered or leaving old content around to confuse you. When you’re done 
with a note, delete it. Follow these steps:

437

Deleting Notes
	
1.	 Tap the Notes app on the Home screen to open it.
	
2.	 With the iPad in landscape orientation, tap a note in the Notes List to 
open it.
	
3.	 Tap the Trash Can icon at the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 2-11.
Figure 2-11: With a note displayed, tap the Trash Can button to delete it.
	
4.	 Tap the Delete Note button that appears. (See Figure 2-12.)
	
	 The note is deleted.
Figure 2-12: Go ahead; delete whatever you 
don’t need with a tap of this button.
	
Notes is a nice little app, but it’s limited. It offers very few formatting tools and 
only one font for your text. You can’t paste pictures into it. (Actually, you can, 
but what appears is the filename, not the image.) So if you’ve made some notes 
and want to graduate to building a more robust document in a word processor, 
you have a couple of options. One way is to use the Pages word-processor 
application for iPad, which comes with newer iPads, and copy your note (using 
the Copy and Paste feature discussed earlier in this chapter). Alternatively, you 
can send the note to yourself in an email. Open the email and copy and paste 
the text into a full-fledged word processor, and you’re good to go.
	
If you want to move beyond Notes and use a note-taking app that lets you 
write with a stylus, check out PaperDesk for iPad ($3.99) or Penultimate 
(free) in the App Store. Both make drawing and writing handwritten notes 
easy and fun. Pogo Sketch and Pogo Stylus are two good stylus tools to 
check out (at www.tenonedesign.com).

Chapter 3: Keeping On Schedule with 
the Calendar and Clock Apps
In This Chapter
✓	Viewing your calendar
✓	Adding and repeating calendar events
✓	Working with, searching, and sharing calendars
✓	Deleting events
✓	Using the Clock app
M

ost people have busy lives full of activities that aren’t always easy to 
keep straight. You may need a way to keep on top of all those work-
related and personal activities and appointments. The Calendar app on the 
iPad is a simple, elegant, electronic daybook that helps you do just that.
In addition to being able to enter events and view them by the day, week, 
month, or year, you can set up Calendar to provide alerts to remind you 
of your obligations, and you can search for events by keyword. 
You can also set up repeating events, such as the weekly staff 
meeting, a regular social get-together, or monthly flea 
treatments for your cat. By taking advantage of the 
new Family Sharing feature in iOS 8, you can create 
a family calendar that everybody in your family can 
add events to.
Another useful preinstalled app is Clock. Though 
simple to use, Clock helps you view the time in mul­
tiple locations, set alarms, and use a timer and 
stopwatch.
In this chapter, I show you how to master simple pro­
cedures for getting around in your calendar, creating a 
family calendar, entering and editing events, setting up 
alerts, and searching. You also discover the simple ins and 
outs of using Clock.

Taking a Look at Your Calendar
Taking a Look at Your Calendar
You’ve probably used calendar apps in a slew of settings — in your email cli­
ent, on your cellphone, and even in robust contact-management programs. 
The Calendar app on iPad is more robust than some and less robust than 
others, but it’s quite a nicely designed and simple-to-use program that saves 
you the cost of buying one more app, plus it syncs with your computer and 
iCloud, Google, Exchange, or Office 365 calendar. Calendar offers several 
ways to view your schedule, so the first step in mastering Calendar is to 
understand how to navigate those various views.
You get started by tapping the Calendar app icon on the Home screen to 
open it. Depending on what you last had open, you may see today’s calendar 
or the weekly, monthly, or yearly calendar or an open event.
Next, tap one of the top buttons described here to change the view:
	
✓	Today: This view, shown in landscape orientation with Search open in 
Figure 3-1, displays your daily appointments and a small monthly calen­
dar on the left page, along with an hourly breakdown of the day on the 
right page. In portrait orientation, the two pages are narrower. Tap an 
event on this list to view more details.
Figure 3-1: Calendar in landscape orientation.
	
✓	Week: Use Week view to see all your events for the current week, as 
shown in Figure 3-2. In this view, appointments appear in their sched­
uled time slots on the grid.

view, days that have scheduled events display the color of the calendar 
associated with the event.

Adding Calendar Events
To move from one day, week, month, or year to another, use your finger to 
scroll up or down the list.
To jump back to today, tap the Today button in the bottom-left corner of 
Calendar. And now you know the basics about views in Calendar!
The portrait and landscape orientations of your iPad with the Calendar app 
give you a slightly different display. Play around with turning your iPad in 
different directions to see which one you prefer to work in.
	
Note that you can tap text that mentions a reservation or phone number in 
an email to add an event to Calendar.
	
If you’re looking for a more robust scheduling app, consider buying Pocket 
Informant HD for $12.99. This app is easy to use and has helpful scheduling 
tools for your tasks. You can also sync information that you save in the app 
by using Google Calendar. Also, if you want to use a calendar program for 
business, check out Shifty ($13.99), a work-shift management app that has 
tools that can be quite useful to managers and supervisors.
Adding Calendar Events
Events in your life might range from business meetings to karaoke dates, but 
whatever the nature of your appointments, Calendar can help you keep them 
all straight. You can enter single events or repeating events and include 
alerts to remind you that they’re coming up.
Adding one event at a time
If you’ve used other calendar programs, you know that adding events is usu­
ally a simple procedure. You can easily add events to iPad’s Calendar app, 
but if you haven’t used a touchscreen computer or smartphone, it’s worth a 
walk-through.
Follow these steps to add an event to your calendar:
	
1.	 With Calendar open in any view, tap the Add button to add an event.
	
	 The New Event dialog, shown in Figure 3-6, appears.
	
2.	 Enter a title for the event and, if you want, a location.
	
3.	 Tap the All-day button for an all-day event, or tap the Starts or 
Ends field.
	
	 The tools for setting a date and time, as shown in Figure 3-7, displays.

swipe your finger to scroll up or down.
	
5.	 (Optional) To add notes, use your finger to scroll down in the New 
Event dialog; then tap in the Notes field.
	
6.	 After all items are set correctly, tap Add.

Adding Calendar Events
Note that you can edit any event at any time by simply tapping it in any view 
of your calendar. The Edit dialog appears, offering the same settings as the 
Add Event dialog. (Refer to Figure 3-6.) Just tap the Done button in this dia­
log to save your changes or Cancel to return to your calendar without saving 
any changes.
Adding events with Siri
Siri, the personal assistant feature, offers a hands-free way to schedule events. 
There are several ways to schedule an event with Siri because the feature is 
pretty flexible. For example, you can say, “Create event,” and then Siri asks 
you first for a date and then for a time. Or you can say, “I have a meeting with 
John on April 1st,” and Siri might respond by saying, “I don’t find a meeting 
with John on April 1st; shall I create it?” Then you can say, “Yes” to have Siri 
create it, asking you for more details like the time and place.
Follow these steps to have Siri schedule an event for you:
	
1.	 Press and hold the Home button.
	
2.	 Say a command such as “Create meeting October 3rd at 2:30 p.m.”
	
3.	 When Siri asks you whether you are ready to schedule the event, 
say “Yes.”
	
You can also use Siri to delete events, change details about an event, or 
remind you about an event. Siri recognizes holidays so that you can say, 
“Schedule a family dinner on Christmas,” and Siri will know what you mean. 
Play around with Siri; it’s a lot of fun!
Creating repeating events
Many events in your life probably happen regularly: that Tuesday evening 
book club, the monthly sales meeting, or your company’s yearly audit, for 
example. You can use the Repeating Events feature of the Calendar app to 
set repeating events.
Follow these steps to create a repeating event:
	
1.	 With any view displayed in the Calendar app, tap the Add button to 
add an event.
	
	 The Add Event dialog (refer to Figure 3-6) appears.
	
2.	 Enter a title and location for the event and set the start and end dates 
and times (see the preceding section).
	
3.	 Scroll down the page if necessary and tap the Repeat field.
	
	 The Repeat dialog, shown in Figure 3-8, appears.

446
Adding Calendar Events
Figure 3-8: You have to use preset intervals, but you can choose from 
among several.
	
4.	 Tap a preset time interval: Every Day, Week, 2 Weeks, Month, or Year.
	
	 If you want, you can tap Custom and enter a Frequency and Day. For 
example, you can create an event to happen monthly, but only every 
three months, or daily every three days.
	
5.	 Tap New Event to close the Repeat dialog, and then tap Add.
	
	 You return to the Calendar.
	
If you have an iCloud, Exchange, or Gmail account, your iPad recognizes and 
supports all calendars you’ve compiled there as well as those you’ve synced 
and the iPad calendar. Be sure to set the Calendar switch to on in the Settings 
app’s Mail, Contacts, Calendars pane for any accounts that you want Calendar 
to access.
Adding alerts
Once upon a time, helpful assistants placed printed paper schedules of the 
day’s activities in front of their bosses to remind them of scheduled commit­
ments. Today, I’m not sure anybody but the highest-paid CEOs get this type 
of service. Instead, most people set up alerts in calendar programs to remind 
them where to be, and when.
Luckily, in the iPad Calendar app, you can easily set up alerts by following 
these steps:
	
1.	 Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen and then tap Sounds.

447

Adding Calendar Events
	
2.	 Scroll down and tap Calendar Alerts and then tap any alert tone, 
which causes iPad to play the tone for you.
	
3.	 After you choose a tone, tap Sounds to return to the Sounds settings.
	
4.	 Press the Home button and then tap Calendar.
	
5.	 Create an event in your calendar or open an existing one for editing 
(see the preceding sections).
	
6.	 In the Add Event dialog or Edit dialog for an existing event (refer to 
Figure 3-6), tap the Alert field.
	
	 The New Alert dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-9. Note that if you 
want two alerts — say, one per day before and one an hour before — you 
can repeat this procedure using Second Alert instead. The Second Alert 
field appears directly below the Alert field in the Add Event dialog after 
you set an alert.
	
7.	 Tap any preset interval, from 5 Minutes Before to 2 Days Before or at 
the time of an event.
	
8.	 Tap New Event or Edit Event to return to the New Event or Edit Event 
dialog.
Figure 3-9: Use these preset intervals to set up alerts.
	
9.	 Tap Add (for a new event) or Done (if you’re done editing an existing 
event) to save the alert.
	
10.	 Tap the Day button to display the date of your event in Day view and 
then tap the event.

448
Working with Your Events
	
	 Note that the alert and time frame are listed under the event in that 
view, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Figure 3-10: An alert is noted along with the appointment in 
your calendar.
	
If you’re on the road and change time zones, iPad may not recognize the 
local time, which can cause your alerts to become useless. To avoid this 
problem, you can adjust the time of your iPad manually by using the Date & 
Time feature in the General category in Settings.
	
To view any invitation or event that you accepted, which placed an event on 
your calendar, tap Inbox, and a list of invitations is displayed. Tap Done to 
return to the calendar.
Working with Your Events
After you have entered some events in Calendar, you can use features to 
search for events, sync your events with other calendars on other devices, 
or delete events that have been canceled.
In this section, you work with the various events on your calendar to keep 
things up-to-date and organized.
Searching calendars
Displaying events by day or week and scrolling the pages is one way to look 
for appointments, but if you need to view a particular event and can’t 
remember its time frame, you can use the Calendar Search feature to find it.
	
Don’t forget that you can also search for events in your calendar by speaking 
a command to Siri or searching with the Spotlight Search feature.
Follow these steps to search for events in Calendar:
	
1.	 With Calendar open in any view, tap the Search field (refer to 
Figure 3-5) in the top-right corner.

Working with multiple calendars
You can choose a calendar — for example, Business, Personal, Parties, Classes, 
and Volunteering — for every event. If you’re synchronizing your calendars 
with your Mac or PC or by using iCloud, Google Calendar, Microsoft Exchange, 
or AOL, each source can have its own calendar. You can also sync a local calen­
dar on your Mac or Windows PC via iTunes. On your iPad, tap Calendars at the 
bottom of the screen in the Calendar app. Every calendar is listed with a dot of 
a different color.

450
Syncing Calendars
You can choose calendars on this list to display the events from several cal­
endars at one time, including calendars you sync with from your PC or Mac, 
only your PC calendar, only your Mac calendar, cloud-based calendars, or 
only your iPad calendar. With the Calendar app open, tap the Calendars but­
ton, and in the Calendars dialog, tap to select or deselect the calendars you 
want to display: All from My <Account>, Birthday Calendar, My Calendar, or 
US Holidays. If you have synced to calendars from other sources, you can 
choose them by tapping them to select or deselect them; for example, tap All 
iCloud to show all your iCloud-synced calendars. Tap Done, and your chosen 
calendar displays. When you add a new event, use the Calendar field to 
choose the calendar you want to add the event to.
	
If you’ve created lots of events, you might want to tap Hide All Calendars in 
the Calendar app, and then tap the one or two calendars you need to see 
now so that you can quickly find their events.
Syncing Calendars
If you use a calendar available from an online service, such as Yahoo! or 
Google, you can sync to that calendar to read events that are saved in it on 
your iPad. To sync a calendar, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap the Settings icon on the Home screen.
	
2.	 Tap the Mail, Contacts, Calendars option on the left.
	
3.	 Tap Add Account.
	
	 The Add Account options, shown in Figure 3-12, appear.
	
4.	 Tap an email choice, such as Outlook, Gmail, or Yahoo!
	
5.	 In the settings that appear (see Figure 3-13), enter your name, email 
address, and email account password.
	
6.	 Tap Next.
	
	 iPad verifies your address.
	
7.	 On the following screen, tap the On/Off switch for the Calendars field.
	
8.	 Your iPad retrieves data from your calendar at the interval you have 
specified, so to review these settings, tap the Back button in the top-
left corner of the pane, and then tap the Fetch New Data option in the 
Mail, Contacts, Calendars pane.
	
9.	 In the Fetch New Data pane that appears (see Figure 3-14), be sure that 
the Push option’s On/Off switch is set to on (green) and then choose 
the frequency option you prefer your iPad to use for querying the 
server for new data: every 15 or 30 minutes, hourly, or manually.
	
	 More frequent pushing of data can use battery power and incur data 
charges on a 3G/4G connection.

Using Stopwatch and Timer
Sometimes life seems like a countdown or a ticking clock counting up the 
minutes you’ve spent on a certain activity. You can use the Stopwatch tab of 
the Clock app to time the length of an activity such as a walk. Use the Timer 
feature to do a countdown to a specific time such as the moment when your 
chocolate chip cookies are done baking.

These two work very similarly: Tap the Stopwatch or Timer tab and tap the 
Start button. When you set the Timer, iPad uses a sound to notify you when 
time’s up. When you start the Stopwatch, you have to tap the Stop button 
when the activity is done (see Figure 3-21).

The Reminders app and the Notification Center feature warm the hearts of 
iPad owners who need help remembering the details of their lives.
Reminders is a kind of to-do list that lets you create tasks and set reminders 
so that you don’t forget important commitments. Notifications let 
you review all elements that you should be aware of in one 
place, such as new mail messages, text messages, calendar 
appointments, reminders, and alerts.
If you occasionally need to escape all your obliga­
tions, try the Do Not Disturb feature. Turn this fea­
ture on and you won’t be bothered with alerts till 
you turn it off again.
In this chapter, I tell you how to set up and view 
tasks in Reminders, and I explain how Notification 
Center can centralize all your alerts.
Creating a Task in Reminders
Reminders help you stay on schedule, avoid embarrassing missed 
appointments, and stay on top of your hundreds of errands each and every 
day. Creating a task in Reminders is pretty darn simple.

460
Creating a Task in Reminders
	
Note that when you first begin to use Reminders, you’ll have only the 
Reminders list to add tasks to. However, you can create your own categories 
of reminder lists; see the “Creating a List” section, later in this chapter, to 
find out how to do this.
To create a reminder, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Reminders on the Home screen.
	
2.	 On the screen that appears (see Figure 4-1), tap a blank slot in any cat­
egory in the displayed list to add a task.
	
	 The onscreen keyboard appears.
Figure 4-1: Add a reminder task.
	
3.	 Enter a task name or description using the onscreen keyboard and tap 
the Done button.
	
	 The new task is added to the Reminders list.
	
You can create reminders using Siri. Just press and hold the Home button till 
Siri asks what you need to do, and then say something like “Create a 
reminder to call Mom this Thursday at noon.” Siri displays the reminder and 
asks you to confirm that you want to create it. Just say, “Yes,” and it’s done.

Editing Task Details
	
See the next task to discover how to add more specifics about an event for 
which you’ve created a reminder.
Editing Task Details
What’s a task without the details? For example, try to remember the task 
Pick Up Grammy Award without having a few notes to specify when and 
where and what you should wear. Reminder tasks help get you where you 
need to be when you need to be there.
To edit a task and add details, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap a task and then tap the Details button (it looks like a small i ) that 
appears to the right of it to open the Details dialog (see Figure 4-2).
Figure 4-2: Add the information you need about a particular event in 
this dialog.
	
2.	 Tap a Priority.
	
	 Choose None, Low, Medium, or High from the choices that appear.
	
	 The Notes priority settings display the associated number of exclama­
tion marks on a task in a list to remind you of its importance.
	
3.	 Tap List and then, from the options that display (see Figure 4-3), select 
a list to put your task on.
	
4.	 Tap Details to return to the dialog and then tap Notes.

Get Some Rest with Do Not Disturb
Get Some Rest with Do Not Disturb
Do Not Disturb is a simple but useful setting you can use to stop any alerts 
and FaceTime calls from making a sound or being displayed. You can make 
settings to allow calls from certain people to get through or to allow several 
repeat calls from the same person in a short time period to come through. 
(Apple has assumed in designing this app that such repeat calls may signal 
an emergency situation or urgent need to get through to you.)
To set up Do Not Disturb, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings.
	
2.	 Tap Do Not Disturb to turn the feature on.
	
3.	 Tap the Manual On/Off switch to turn the feature on.

C

ontacts is the iPad equivalent of the address book on your cellphone. 
In fact, if you own an iPhone, it’s similar to your Contacts app. The 
Contacts app on iPad is simple to set up and use, and it has some powerful 
little features beyond simply storing names, addresses, and phone numbers.
For example, you can pinpoint a contact’s address in the iPad 
Maps application. You can use your contacts to quickly 
address emails, messages, and tweets. If you store a con­
tact record that includes a website, you can use a link in 
Contacts to view that website instantly. And, of course, 
you can easily search for a contact by a variety of cri­
teria, including people related to you by family ties 
or mutual friends, or by groups you create.
In this chapter, you discover the various features of 
Contacts, including how to save yourself time by sync­
ing your email contacts lists to your iPad instantly.
Populating Your Contacts 
with Information
The Contacts app’s sole purpose is to store contact information and make it 
available to you, but first you have to make that information available to the 
Contacts app. You can do it by manually adding records one at a time, by 

472
Populating Your Contacts with Information
syncing via iTunes, syncing contacts with other accounts such as your Gmail 
or Yahoo! email, or pushing your contacts to other devices via iCloud to 
transfer your contacts instantly.
	
If you have access to or can set up a lightweight directory server (LDIF or 
LDAP), you can import the contacts stored in such a directory. You can 
do this by choosing Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars and then tapping 
Add Account. Choose Other and then, under Contacts, tap Add LDAP 
Account.
Adding contacts
You can, of course, enter your contacts the old-fashioned way, by typing 
their names, addresses, phone numbers, and other information in a contact 
form.
Follow these steps to create a new contact record:
	
1.	 Tap the Contacts app icon on the Home screen to open the 
application.
	
	 If you haven’t yet entered a contact, you see a blank address book with 
the Add (plus) icon at the top of the Contacts List, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1: Tap to add a new contact.
	
2.	 Tap the Add button (the + button).
	
	 A blank Info page opens, and the onscreen keyboard displays, as you 
can see in Figure 5-2.

473
Book V 
Chapter 5
Managing Contacts
Populating Your Contacts with Information
Figure 5-2: Enter as much information about your contact as you want.
	
3.	 Enter some contact information.
	
	 Enter a first name in the First field, for example. To create a contact, only 
a first name, last name, or company name is required.
	
	 To scroll down the contact page and see more fields, swipe upward on 
the page.
	
	 If you’re entering a phone number that requires a pause, such as when 
you access an outside line from your workplace, insert a comma into the 
number at the spot where the pause must occur. This comma produces 
a one-second pause. You can also enter a period (.) in the number to 
pause until you tap Dial to continue. If you sync this contact information 
to your phone via iTunes, it’s then set up to dial correctly.
	
4.	 (Optional) To add information such as a mailing or street address, tap 
the related Add field, which opens additional entry fields.
	
5.	 (Optional) To add another information field such as Nickname or Job 
Title, tap Add Field toward the bottom of the pane. In the Add Field 
dialog that appears (see Figure 5-3), choose a field to add.
	
	 You may have to swipe your finger upward to view all available fields.
	
	 If your contact’s name is difficult for you to pronounce, add the Phonetic 
First Name (or Phonetic Last Name) field to that person’s record.

Managing Contacts
Populating Your Contacts with Information
	
If you’ve set up a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) account on 
iPad to connect with your organization’s directory service, you may be able 
to access its directories via Contacts. See Book III, Chapter 1, for more about 
setting up an LDAP account.
	
If you want to add multiple email addresses to a contact so that you can 
­easily send email to all of that contact’s email addresses, enter a work email 
address in the steps above, and another Add Email field titled Other opens. 
Tap the pop-up and enter an appropriate title; then enter another email 
address there. Another Other field opens, and so on. Simply enter all email 
addresses you want included for that contact and then tap Done.
	
A new feature in iOS 8 allows you to create a new contact from contents of 
an email such as an email signature. If that information isn’t already in your 
Contacts app, a banner appears at the top of the message offering you the 
option of adding the person to Contacts.
Syncing contacts with iCloud
You can use your iCloud account to sync contacts from your iPad to iCloud to 
back them up. These also become available to your iCloud email account, if you 
set one up. Note that these steps can also be used for Google and Exchange 
accounts through the Mail, Contacts, Calendars section of Settings.
Follow these steps to sync your contacts:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen and then tap iCloud.
	
2.	 In the iCloud settings shown in Figure 5-5, tap Contacts to sync contacts.
Figure 5-5: Choose what to sync through iCloud here.

476
Assigning a Photo to a Contact
	
3.	 Tap Merge (see Figure 5-6) to merge your iPad Contacts contents with 
iCloud.
Figure 5-6: Merge your iPad Contacts contents with iCloud.
	
If you don’t use a server-based syncing method with accounts such as 
iCloud, Google, or Exchange, you can use iTunes to automatically sync con­
tacts among all your Apple devices and even a Windows PC. See Book I, 
Chapter 5, for more about making iTunes settings to specify how your con­
tacts are synced in iTunes.
	
You can use the iTunes Wi-Fi sync feature in the General pane in Settings to 
sync with iTunes wirelessly from a computer connected to the same Wi-Fi 
network.
Assigning a Photo to a Contact
It’s always helpful to associate a face with a name. In Contacts, you can do 
just that by adding a person’s photo to his contact record. You can add 
­photos from various sources, such as
	
✓	The Photos app’s albums
	
✓	Digital cameras
	
✓	Email attachments
	
✓	iPad’s camera
	
✓	Photo collections stored on your computer or in iCloud (see Book II, 
Chapter 6, for more about working with the Photos app)

Adding Twitter or Facebook Information
	
If you want a more powerful contact-management app, check out Contacts 
Journal – iPad Edition. It syncs with your Contacts app content and can also 
sync with a computer contact-management program such as Outlook. The 
most helpful aspect of Contacts Journal for road warriors is that it maintains 
a record of whom you’ve visited and when you’ve emailed those people.
Adding Twitter or Facebook Information
You can add Twitter and Facebook information to a contact so that you can 
quickly tweet (send a short message) to contacts using Twitter or post a 
message to your contact’s Facebook account.
To specify Facebook or Twitter account information for a contact, first be 
sure that you’ve activated and set up a User Name and Password for your 
Facebook and/or Twitter accounts under Settings. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	 With Contacts open, tap a contact.
	
2.	 Tap the Edit button.
	
3.	 Scroll down and tap Social Profile.
	
4.	 In the list that appears (see Figure 5-10), enter a Twitter label.
	
	 If you want to create a different social networking field, tap Add Social 
Profile. A Facebook field appears. You can also tap again to get a Flickr 
account, and then a LinkedIn account, and so on.

social network.
	
If you prefer to add Facebook information instead of Twitter, tap Add Social 
Profile just under the Twitter field in Step 5 and enter the contact’s Facebook 
information. (You can also click the Add Social Profile link again and choose 
Flickr, LinkedIn, Myspace, Sina Welbo, or Add Custom Service in the fields 
that appear.)
Designating Related People
You can quickly designate a relation — such as your mother, assistant, 
friend, or manager — in a contact record if the person is saved to Contacts. 
To add a relationship to a contact, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap a contact and then tap Edit.
	
2.	 Scroll down the record and tap Add Related Name.
	
	 A new field, labeled Mother, appears (see Figure 5-12). You can tap a field

After you add a relation to a contact record, whenever you select the person 
on the Contacts main screen, all related people for that contact are listed.
Setting Ringtones and Text Tones
If you want to hear a unique tone whenever you receive a FaceTime call or 
a text from a particular contact, you can set up this feature in Contacts. For 
example, if you want to be sure that you know instantly when your spouse, 
a sick friend, or your boss is calling, set a unique tone for that person by 
following these steps:
	
1.	 Tap to add a new contact or select a contact from the list of contacts, 
and tap Edit.
	
2.	 Tap the Ringtone field.
	
	 If you want to assign Text Tones, make that choice in this step. A list of 
tones appears (see Figure 5-14). You can also tap Buy More Tones at the 
top of this list to buy additional ringtones from Apple or a variety of 
third-party sites, or even create your own.

3.	 Tap a tone to preview it.
	
4.	 When you hear a tone you like, tap Done.
	
5.	 Tap Done again to close the contact form.
	
If your Apple devices are synced via iCloud, setting a unique ringtone for an 
iPad contact also sets it for your iPhone, iPod touch, and Mac for FaceTime, 
and Messages. See Book I, Chapter 5, for more about iCloud.
	
You can set a custom tone for FaceTime calls and text messages through 
Settings➪Sounds. You can also create your own custom ring/text tones in 
GarageBand on a Mac or iOS device, with any of several ringtone-maker 
apps, or by using the contents of your iTunes Library on either a Mac or PC.
Finding Contacts
You can use the Spotlight Search feature to find a contact in the Contacts 
app by looking for that person’s first or last name or a company name. This 
feature on the iPad is much like every search feature you’ve ever used. It’s 
somewhat simple in comparison to others because you can search only for 
names and because no advanced search techniques are available.
	
You can also use Siri or the Spotlight Search feature to locate contacts that 
match specified search criteria. Swipe down from near the top of any Home 
screen to display the Spotlight screen.
Follow these steps to search for a contact:
	
1.	 With Contacts open, tap in the Search field at the top of the left page 
(see Figure 5-15).
	
	 The onscreen keyboard opens.
Figure 5-15: Easily search for contacts.

2.	 Type the first letter of either the first or last name, or the company 
name.
	
	 All matching results appear, as shown in Figure 5-16. In the example, 
typing J displays Jane Arnold and Ted And Joan Stier in the results, 
which both have J as the first letter in either their first or last names.
	
3.	 Tap a contact’s name in the results to display that person’s informa­
tion on the page on the right (see Figure 5-16).
Figure 5-16: Search results narrow as you type.
	
You can search by phone number, website, or address in Contacts as well as 
by name.
	
If you’ve entered many contacts, you can use the alphabetical listing that 
appears along the right side of Contacts to locate a contact: Tap and drag to 
scroll the list of contacts on the All Contacts page on the left.
Using Contacts beyond the Contacts App
Contacts isn’t simply a static database of names and addresses. After you’ve 
entered contact information into the app, you can use the information to 
reach out to people in several useful ways. You can jump to a contact’s web­
site to see what she, or her company, is up to online; use a contact’s email 
information to quickly send an email message; share the contact information 
with somebody else; or find the physical address of the contact by using the 
iPad Maps app.

Visiting a contact’s website
Everybody (well, almost everybody) now has a website, so whether your 
contact is a person or an international conglomerate, you’re likely to find an 
associated website that you might want to access now and then. You can 
access it from your iPad by using the Contacts app.
If you entered information in the Home Page field of a contact record, the 
text you entered automatically becomes a link to that person’s website. With 
Contacts open, tap a contact to display the person’s contact information on 
the page at the right and then tap the link in the Home Page field, as shown 
in Figure 5-17.
Figure 5-17: Tap to go to a web page related to a contact.
The Safari browser opens with the web page displayed.
	
You aren’t returned directly to Contacts after you follow a link to a web­
site. You have to tap the Home button and then tap the Contacts app icon 
again to reenter the application. Or you can use the multitasking feature 
to get back to Contacts by double-tapping the Home button and choosing 
Contacts from the icons that appear along the bottom of the screen. 
However, if you have the Multitasking Gestures setting turned on in the 
General pane of Settings, you can do the four-finger swipe to the left to 
return to the app you just left and keep swiping to go to the apps on the 
multitasking bar in sequence.

Using Contacts beyond the Contacts App
Addressing emails using contacts
If you’ve entered an email address for a contact, the address automati­
cally converts to a link in the record that allows you to open an email 
form and send a message. This shortcut is handy for getting in touch. 
Note that the steps outlined here also work for creating Messages or plac­
ing Facetime calls.
First, be sure that you’ve entered an email address in the contact’s record 
and then follow these steps:
	
1.	 Tap the Contacts app icon on the Home screen to open Contacts.
	
2.	 Tap a contact’s name to display her contact information on the page 
on the right, and then tap the email address link labeled Work, as in 
the example shown in Figure 5-18.
	
	 Note that people you’ve contacted recently are displayed along the top 
of the multitasking screen, which you get to by double-pressing the 
Home button. When you tap a recent contact, any available methods of 
connecting with her in her record, including Messages or Facetime, are 
listed; just tap a button to make the connection.
Figure 5-18: Tap to open a new email message.
	
	 The New Message form appears with the contact’s email address already 
entered, as shown in Figure 5-19. The title bar of this form initially reads 
New Message but changes to the specific title as you type on the Subject 
line.
	
3.	 Tap in a field and use the onscreen keyboard to enter a subject and a 
message.
	
4.	 Tap the Send button.
	
	 The message is sent.

Sharing contacts
After you’ve entered contact information, you can share it with others in an 
email message. Sharing is especially handy when you store locations in 
Contacts, such as your favorite restaurant or movie theater.
Here’s how to share your contacts’ information:
	
1.	 With Contacts open, tap a contact name to display its information.
	
2.	 On the information page, tap the Share Contact button.
	
	 If you want, you can select AirDrop, and then tap the name of a device 
near to you to send the contact information wirelessly to that device.
	
3.	 In the popover that appears, shown in Figure 5-20, tap Mail or Message.
	
	 The New Message form appears. Both the email and message form let 
you enter a message and include the contact information as an attach­
ment to be sent to the recipient. Figure 5-21 shows the email form.
Figure 5-20: Easily share contact information with others.

Figure 5-21: Fill out the email form to share your contact.
	
4.	 On the email New Message form, use the onscreen keyboard to enter 
the recipient’s email address.
	
	 Note: If the person’s information is saved in Contacts, you just have to 
type his or her name here.
	
5.	 Enter information in the Subject field.
	
6.	 If you like, enter a message.
	
7.	 Tap the Send button.
	
	 The message goes to your recipient with the contact information 
attached as a .vcf file (in the vCard format, commonly used to transmit 
contact information).
Someone who receives a vCard containing contact information simply clicks 
the attached file to open it. At that point, the recipient can perform various 
actions (depending on the recipient’s email or contact-management pro­
gram) to save the content. Other iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad users can ­easily 
import .vcf records into their own Contacts apps.
Viewing a Contact’s Location in Maps
If you’ve entered a person’s street address in Contacts, you have a shortcut 
for viewing that person’s location in the Maps app. Once again, this is useful 
for places you need to visit for the first time, such as several clients’ offices 
on that next business trip.
Follow these steps to pinpoint your contacts in the iPad Maps app:
	
1.	 To open the Contacts app, tap its icon on the Home screen.
	
2.	 Tap the contact you want to view to display her information.

489

Managing Contacts
Deleting Contacts
	
3.	 Tap the address.
	
	 Maps opens and displays a map of the address, as shown in Figure 5-22.
	
You can use information stored in Contacts to access more than your friends’ 
addresses. You can also save information about your favorite restaurant or 
movie theater, or any other location, and then use Contacts to jump to the 
associated website in the Safari browser or to the address in Maps.
	
After you jump to a contact’s location in Maps, you may want to use the fea­
tures of Maps to display different views, determine the condition of traffic on 
that route, or calculate the route between two locations. For more about 
using the Maps application, see Book III, Chapter 2.
Figure 5-22: Tap the information bar to view more details in the Maps app.
Deleting Contacts
Remember that iPad’s storage capacity is limited compared to your typical 
computer. Though a contact record is tiny compared to a TV show, there’s no 
sense keeping lots of old records around when you no longer need them. When 
you need to remove a name or two from your Contacts, doing so is easy.
Follow these steps to delete contacts on your iPad:
	
1.	 With Contacts open, tap the contact you want to delete.
	
2.	 On the information pane on the right, tap the Edit button.

490
Deleting Contacts
	
3.	 Drag your finger upward to scroll down (if necessary) and then tap 
Delete Contact at the bottom, as shown in Figure 5-23.
	
	 A confirmation alert appears.
	
4.	 Tap Delete Contact to confirm the deletion.

O

ne of the coolest features of iPad is Siri, a personal assistant feature 
that responds to spoken commands using a third-generation (or later) 
iPad and iPad mini. With Siri, you can ask for nearby restaurants, and a list 
appears. You can open apps with a voice command and with iOS 8, for the 
first time, Siri can open the App Store. You can dictate your email messages 
rather than type them. Calling your mother is as simple as saying, 
“Call Mom.” Want to know the capital of Rhode Island? Just ask. 
Siri checks several online sources to answer questions rang­
ing from the result of a mathematical calculation to the 
size of Jupiter. You can also have Siri perform tasks 
such as returning calls and controlling iTunes Radio. 
Finally, you can even play music, and with iOS 8 
comes integration with Shazam, a music identifier 
service that can identify tagged songs for you.
Activating Siri
When you first go through the process of setting up 
your iPad or iPad mini, making settings for your loca­
tion, using iCloud, and so on, at one point, you see the 
screen shown in Figure 6-1. To activate Siri, just tap Use Siri 
and then tap Next. When you first set up your iPad, it reminds 
you about using Siri by displaying a message.

492
Activating Siri
Figure 6-1: Activate Siri now or later, but definitely give it a try!
If you didn’t activate Siri during the registration process, you can use 
Settings to turn Siri on by following these steps:
	
1.	 Tap Settings on the Home screen.
	
2.	 Tap General and then tap Siri (see Figure 6-2)
Figure 6-2: Siri offers a few simple settings.

Activating Siri
	
3.	 In the dialog in Figure 6-3, tap the On/Off switch to turn Siri on.
Figure 6-3: Get Siri going here.
	
4.	 If you wish to change the language Siri uses, tap Language and choose 
a different language in the list that appears.
	
5.	 To change the gender of Siri’s voice from female to male, tap Voice 
Gender and then tap Male.
	
6.	 If you want to be able to activate Siri hands free when your iPhone is 
plugged in to power by saying “Hey, Siri,” set Voice Activation to On.
	
7.	 Tap My Info and select your own contact information in the Contacts 
list that appears.
	
	 Siri now knows your name, phone number, website, contacts who are 
related to you and their relationship, and so on, so it can respond to 
requests that require that information.
	
You can make a setting that allows Siri to be used when the Lock screen is 
displayed, but Siri can then bypass any passcode you’ve required. If some­
body else gets his hands on your iPad and you have this set to On, it could 
compromise your data security. To change this setting under General set­
tings, tap Passcode Lock. When the lock is set to on, you can use the Siri 
field to turn access via Siri on or off.

494
Understanding All That Siri Can Do
	
Siri is available on the iPad only when you have Internet access, and cellular 
data charges could apply when Siri checks online sources if you’re using a 
3G/4G iPad model. In addition, Apple warns that available features may vary 
by area.
Now, to use Siri, press and hold the Home button until Siri opens, displaying 
a dialog with the phrase, “What can I help you with?” (see Figure 6-4) and a 
small microphone icon; wait a moment, and Siri begins to show you the 
types of commands it can follow. Remember that this works with only third-
generation iPads and later, and iPad minis with iOS 6 or later installed.
Figure 6-4: Siri awaits your command.
Understanding All That Siri Can Do
Siri allows you to interact with many apps on your iPad by voice. You can 
pose questions or ask to do something, such as make a FaceTime call or add 
an appointment to your calendar. Siri can also search the Internet or use an 
informational database called WolframAlpha to provide information on just 
about any topic. You don’t have to be in an app to make a request involving 
another app.

495
Book V 
Chapter 6
Talking to Your iPad 
with Siri
Understanding All That Siri Can Do
	
Siri also checks with Wikipedia, Bing, and Twitter to get you the information 
you ask for. In addition, you can use Siri to tell iPad to play your voicemail, 
open and search the App Store, or control iTunes Radio playback.
Siri is the technology behind the iPad’s Dictation feature. When you have the 
onscreen keyboard open, note that it contains the Dictation key, which you 
can tap to begin to dictate and tap to end dictation. This works in any app 
that uses the onscreen keyboard.
You don’t need to use any preset structure for the questions you pose to Siri; 
you can phrase things in several ways. For example, you might say, “Where 
am I?” to see a map of your current location, or you could say, “What is my 
current location?” or “What address is this?” and get the same results. Also, 
Siri gets better at responding to your requests the more you use it, as it 
learns more about you from your browsing habits and requests.
When you ask a question about, say, setting up an appointment, Siri responds 
to you both verbally and with text information, in a form as with email (see 
Figure 6-5) or in a graphic display for some items such as maps. When a 
result appears, you can tap it to make a choice or open a related app.
Figure 6-5: If you ask to send an email, Siri provides the email form.
	
With iOS 8, you can activate Siri hands-free. With your iPhone plugged into a 
wall outlet, car power port, or computer’s USB port, just say “Hey, Siri” and 
Siri opens up ready for a command. In addition, with voice recognition, Siri 
displays in text what it’s hearing as you speak, so you can verify that it has 
understood you instantly. This streaming feature makes the whole process of 
interacting with Siri faster.
	
With iOS 8, Siri now supports 22 languages, so you can finally show off those 
language lessons you took in high school.
Siri works with FaceTime, the App Store, Music, Messages, Reminders, Calendar, 
Maps, Mail, Clock, Contacts, Notes, and Safari. In the following tasks, I provide a 
quick guide to some of the most useful ways you can use Siri.

496
Staying in Touch and Staying on Schedule with Siri
Staying in Touch and Staying on Schedule with Siri
When you’re on the run, Siri can be a wonderful ally. You can ask Siri to make 
calls for you, set up reminders and alerts, and even add appointments to 
your calendar, all by speaking your requests.
Calling contacts via FaceTime
First, make sure that the people you want to call are entered in your 
Contacts app and include their phone numbers in their records. If you want 
to call somebody by stating your relationship to her, such as “Call sister,” be 
sure to enter that relationship in the related field in her contact record and 
make sure that the settings for Siri (refer to Figure 6-2) include your contact 
name in the My Info field. (See Chapter 5 in this minibook for more about 
creating contact records.)
	
1.	 Press and hold the Home button until Siri appears.
	
2.	 Speak a command such as “Make a FaceTime call to Earl” or 
“FaceTime Mom.”
	
	 If two contacts exist who might match a spoken name, Siri responds with 
a list of possible matches (see Figure 6-6).
Figure 6-6: If two similar contacts exist, Siri asks you to choose.
	
3.	 Tap one of the contacts in the list or state the correct contact’s name 
to proceed.
	
	 Siri places the call.
	
4.	 To end the call before it completes, tap the Home button and then tap 
End.
	
To cancel any spoken request, you have four options: You can say “Cancel,” 
tap the Microphone button on the Siri screen, tap the Home button, or tap 
anywhere on the screen outside the Siri panel.
Creating reminders and alerts
You can also use Siri with the Reminders app. For example, you might want 
to set a reminder to meet a friend for lunch next Tuesday. Rather than 

497
Book V 
Chapter 6
Talking to Your iPad 
with Siri
Staying in Touch and Staying on Schedule with Siri
opening the Reminder app and adding a new reminder and settings for it, 
you can tell Siri to do it for you.
To create a reminder using Siri, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Press and hold the Home key and then speak a command, such as 
“Remind me to call Dad on Thursday at 10 a.m.” or “Wake me up 
tomorrow at 7 a.m.”
	
	 A preview of the reminder is displayed (see Figure 6-7), and Siri asks you 
whether it should create the reminder.
Figure 6-7: Siri presents the reminder as it understood it for you to 
confirm.
	
2.	 If Siri asks you to confirm, tap or say Confirm to create the reminder 
or alert.
	
3.	 If you want a reminder ahead of the event you created, activate Siri 
and speak a command, such as “Remind me tonight about the play on 
Thursday at 8 p.m.”
	
	 A second reminder is created, which you can confirm or cancel if you 
change your mind.
Adding tasks to your Calendar
If you live by your Calendar appointments, you’ll be happy to hear that Siri 
can also set up events on your Calendar for you. Siri not only records the 
event on your Calendar, but it also alerts you if a conflict exists.
Follow these steps to set up an event using Siri:
	
1.	 Press and hold the Home button and then speak a phrase, such as “Set 
up meeting at 10 a.m. on October 12th.”
	
	 A sample calendar entry appears, and Siri asks whether you want to 
confirm it.

498
Playing Music
	
2.	 If a conflict exists with the appointment, Siri tells you that you already 
have an appointment at that time (see Figure 6-8) and asks whether 
you still want to set up the new appointment.
Figure 6-8: Double-booked? Siri lets you know.
	
3.	 Say Yes or Cancel or tap the Yes or Cancel button.
Playing Music
How often do you find that you don’t have the time or free hands to unlock 
the iPad screen, open Music, search for music, and tap to play it? Well, you’ll 
find worse problems in the world, but if this is one that nags at you, just press 
and hold the Home button and tell Siri to play your favorite tune. You can use 
Siri to play a song from the Music app or play a station on iTunes Radio.
To play music using Siri, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Press and hold the Home button until Siri appears.
	
2.	 To play music, speak a command, such as “Play music” or “Play ‘As 
Time Goes By’” to play a specific song or album.
	
3.	 When the music is playing, use commands such as “Pause music,” 
“Next track,” or “Stop music” to control playback.
	
One of the beauties of Siri is that you don’t have to follow a specific com­
mand format as you do with some other voice-command apps. You could 
say, “Play the next track” or “Next track” or “Jump to the next track on this 
album,” and Siri gets your meaning.
Letting Siri Put You in the Know
You’re late for an appointment and need help. You can call on Siri. From get­
ting you directions to your next appointment to calling up your customer’s 
website to check her product catalog or check facts on the price of the cli­
ent’s stock today, Siri can find it all.

Chapter 6

Letting Siri Put You in the Know
Getting directions
You can use the Maps app and Siri to find your current location, find nearby 
businesses such as restaurants or a bank, or get a map of a location. Be sure 
to turn on Location Services to allow Siri to know your current location. (Go 
to Settings and tap Privacy➪Location Services to make sure that the Location 
Services setting and Siri are turned on, both are in the same dialog.)
Here are some of the commands you can try to get directions or a list of 
nearby businesses:
	
✓	“Where am I?”
	
	Displays a map of your current location. If you have a Wi-Fi–only iPad, 
this location may be approximate.
	
✓	“Where is Apache Junction, Arizona?”
	
	Displays a map of that city.
	
✓	“Find restaurants.”
	
	Displays a list of restaurants near your current location, as shown in 
Figure 6-9; tap one to display a map of its location.
Figure 6-9: If you’re hungry, Siri could be your new best friend.
	
✓	“Find Bank of America.”
	
	Displays a map with the location of that business (or in some cases, sev­
eral nearby locations, such as a bank branch and all ATMs) indicated.

500
Letting Siri Put You in the Know
	
When a location is displayed in a map, tap the Information button on the 
location’s label to view its address, phone number, and website address, if 
available.
	
Note that all your requests to Siri are routed through Apple servers. If you 
are, say, a spy and you don’t want your movements and activities stored on 
somebody else’s server, avoid using Siri for directions or reminders! But if 
you’re a law-abiding citizen, don’t worry about this.
Asking for the facts
WolframAlpha is a self-professed online computational knowledge engine. 
That means it’s more than a search engine because it provides specific infor­
mation about a search term rather than multiple search results. If you want 
facts without having to send time browsing websites to find those facts, 
you’ll find that Wolfram Alpha is a very good resource.
Siri uses WolframAlpha and sources such as Wikipedia and Bing to look up 
facts in response to questions such as “What is the capital of Kansas?”; 
“What is the square root of 2003?”; or “How large is Mars?” Just press and 
hold the Home button and ask your question; Siri consults its resources and 
returns a set of relevant facts.
You can also get information about many facts, such as the current weather, 
stock prices, or the time. Just say a phrase like one of these to get what you 
need:
	
✓	“What is the weather?”
	
	This shows the weather report for your current location. If you want 
weather in another location, just specify the location in your question.
	
✓	“What is the price of Apple stock?”
	
	Siri tells you the current price of the stock or the price of the stock when 
the stock market last closed. (Let’s hope you own some.)
	
✓	“What time is it?”
	
	Siri tells you the time in your time zone and displays a clock (see 
Figure 6-10).

Getting Helpful Tips
	
Note that Siri can understand many languages and therefore works in many 
countries. If you love to travel, Siri could help make your next trip much 
easier.
Searching the web
Siri can use various resources to respond to specific requests such as “Who 
is the Queen of England?” For more general requests, however, Siri searches 
the web.
For example, if you speak a phrase, such as “Find a website about birds” or 
“Find information about the World Series,” Siri can respond in a couple of 
ways. The app can simply display a list of search results using the default 
search engine specified in your settings for Safari, or suggest, “If you like, I 
can search the web for such-and-such.” In the first instance, just tap a result 
to go to that website. In the second instance, you can confirm that you want 
to search the web or cancel.
Sending Email, Tweets, or Messages
You can create an email, a tweet, or an instant message using Siri and exist­
ing contacts. For example, if you say, “Email Jack Wilkes,” a form opens 
already addressed to that contact. Siri asks you the subject and what to say 
in the message; speak your message and then say “Send” to speed your mes­
sage on its way.
Siri also works with the Messages app. Tap Siri and say, “Message Sarah.” Siri 
creates a message and asks what you want to say. Say, “Tell Sarah I’ll call 
soon,” and Siri creates a message for you to approve and send.
	
It’s hard to stump Siri. For example, at this point in time, Siri can’t tweet unless 
you download and set up the Twitter app. But if you try to speak a tweet, Siri 
gives you a link to tap to install the app! After you install these apps, you can 
say things to Siri such as “Post Tweet” or “Post to Facebook,” and Siri asks 
what you want to say, lets you review it, and posts it. Siri can also connect you 
with Flickr and Vimeo when you have those apps installed.
Getting Helpful Tips
I know you’re going to have a wonderful time learning the ins and outs of 
Siri, but before I close this chapter, here are some tips to get you going:
	
✓	If Siri doesn’t understand you: When you speak a command and Siri 
displays what it thought you said but misses the mark, you have a few 
options. To correct a request you’ve made, you can tap Tap to Edit 

502
Getting Helpful Tips
under the command Siri heard and edit the question by typing, or you 
can tap the Microphone key on the onscreen keyboard and dictate the 
correct information. If a word is underlined in blue, it’s a possible error. 
Tap the word and then tap an alternative that Siri suggests. You can also 
simply speak to Siri and say something like, “I meant Sri Lanka” or “No, 
send it to Sally.” If even corrections aren’t working, you may need to 
restart your iPad to reset the software.
	
✓	Headsets and earphones: If you’re using iPhone EarPods or a Bluetooth 
headset to activate Siri, instead of pressing the Home button, press and 
hold the center button (the little button on the headset that starts and 
stops a call).
	
✓	Using Find My Friends: You can download a free app from the App Store 
called Find My Friends that allows you to ask Siri to locate your friends 
geographically, if they are carrying a device with GPS turned on and 
location tracking allowed.
	
✓	Getting help with Siri: To get help with Siri features, just press and hold 
the Home button and ask Siri, “What can you do?”
	
✓	Joking around: If you need a good laugh, ask Siri to tell you a joke. It has 
quite the sense of humor . . .
