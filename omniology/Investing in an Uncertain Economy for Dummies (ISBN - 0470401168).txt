mission to “help make competent, objective fi nancial advice accessible to all

inappropriate fi nancial advice.
She has authored, coauthored, or served as a technical editor on more than 
a dozen books and several magazine columns. These books include Garrett’s 
Guide to Financial Planning (National Underwriter), Just Give Me the Answer$

Introduction
T
he only certainty in investing — and probably in life — is uncertainty. 
That can make investing seem like an adventure; however, it’s more like 
a transcontinental expedition than a day trip to an amusement park. You 
can’t anticipate the turbulent waters or the snowstorms you may encounter 
along the way, but you’ll reach your destination if you plan ahead and pre-
pare for all potentialities.
If you’re feeling uneasy about the current economic environment or your 
ability to protect yourself and your nest egg, you’re not alone. You’re living in 
truly interesting and uncertain times. Treat this book as your survival guide — 
it can help you limit your ris2ks, plan for the long term and the short term, and 
invest in ways that let you sleep comfortably at night, no matter what the 
markets throw your way.
About This Book
Over 70 professional financial advisors collaborated to bring you Investing 
in an Uncertain Economy For Dummies. It’s designed as a reference guide, so 
don’t worry if you don’t have the time or inclination to read it from cover 
to cover. This one-of-a-kind resource contains over 80 individual strategies 
to address the risks you face, plan for life’s certainties, and prepare for the 
uncertainties of any economy.
The book contains seven parts, each focusing on an investing theme — 
accumulating wealth, preparing for retirement, and so on. Focus on the 
strategies or part that addresses your specific need at this time. Then refer 
back to this book whenever you have additional questions or areas about 
your personal financial life for which you need some guidance.
Conventions Used in This Book
While writing this book, we used a few conventions to make your life just a 
bit easier. Here’s what you can expect:
 
 We use italics when we define a word or phrase that’s important to 
understanding a topic. And when we get especially excited, we may 
throw in some italics for extra emphasis.
 
 When you see text in bold, you can expect it to be either a step in a 
numbered list or a key word in a bulleted list.
 
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.

Investing in an Uncertain Economy For Dummies 
 
 When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to 
break across two lines of text. If that happened, know that we haven’t 
put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So 
when using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you 
see in this book and ignore the line break.
 
 Gray shaded boxes, otherwise known as sidebars, contain interesting but 
nonessential information. Feel free to skip ’em if you’re short on time.
Foolish Assumptions
To provide the tools and advice you need, we made some of the following 
assumptions:
 
 You recognize the need to become more informed about the financial 
markets and your personal finances. You don’t want to become a victim 
of self-serving sales pitches, and you need answers now.
 
 You have some interest in taking a more active and productive role in 
managing your personal financial life, or you at least want to make sure 
you don’t do anything really stupid or get ripped off.
 
 You have access to the Internet, whether at home, work, or your local library.
How This Book Is Organized
Investing in an Uncertain Economy For Dummies is organized into seven dis-
tinct parts, each covering a major area involving your financial life. Here’s a 
summary of what you can find in each part.
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation
Before you start pulling money out of current investments or pouring money 
into new ones, you should make sure you have the right mindset toward your 
finances, investments, and the market at large. This part gives you an histori-
cal perspective of market cycles, helps you assess your finances and goals, and 
reviews some financial strategies to help you get a good foundation in investing.
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and 
Accounts throughout the Economic Cycle
The investment marketplace offers lots of options — as well as futures, com-
modities, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, cash accounts,

 Introduction
retirement accounts, and more! This part gives you an overview of your choices 
and explains when certain types of vehicles or accounts may be right for you.
Part III: Demystifying Risk: Accumulating 
and Protecting Wealth
It’s easy to think that the only risk involved with investing is losing value 
when the market goes down. However, other risks — emotional reactions, 
inflation, job loss, and so on — are major financial risks you have to consider 
in your planning. In this part, you explore types of risk, gauge your risk tol-
erance, and discover how to design a portfolio that allows you to limit risk 
while still getting the returns you need to meet your goals.
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators
This part helps you save and accumulate money for your emergency fund, 
major purchases, and goals such as college education and retirement. It also 
outlines various investment vehicles and strategies tailored to how much 
investment experience you have.
Part V: Heading into Retirement
Your retirement savings may have to support you for 30 years or more, so 
this is one investment area you need to get right. In this part, you discover 
how to prepare for surprises such as needing long-term healthcare or having 
to assist aging parents or adult children. You examine employer retirement 
plans, Social Security, and other potential sources of retirement income. You 
also take a look at asset allocation and gauge whether you’re on track to have 
enough money during retirement.
Part VI: Living on Your Investment 
Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets
This part takes you into retirement, helping you maximize pension and/or 
Social Security benefits and reduce your taxes as you decide which retire-
ment accounts to use first. It also helps you develop a strategy for tapping 
into your assets and continuing to invest them so they offer you a steady 
stream of income while minimizing the risk that you’ll run out of money 
during your golden years.

Investing in an Uncertain Economy For Dummies 
Part VII: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a classic For Dummies part consisting of top-ten lists. In 
this part, you find ten tips for building a solid financial foundation and ten 
ways to minimize risk.
Icons Used in This Book
As you flip through this book, you can see a few different icons that draw 
your attention to specific issues or examples. Check them out:
 
If you’re looking for a time-saving tool or insider suggestion that you can use 
immediately, the text next to the Tip icon has what you want.
 
If you don’t read anything else, pay attention to the info next to this icon, 
which points out information that we just had to stress because it’s that 
important to your financial well-being.
 
This icon alerts you to common pitfalls and dangers that you have to be on 
the lookout for when managing your personal finances.
 
This icon marks ideas you should pay special attention to when the economy 
looks shaky or you’re really struggling.
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so you can go directly to the part or strategies that 
matter to you right now. Worried about debt and your credit score? Flip to 
Strategies #11 and #12. Need information on diversifying your stock portfo-
lio? Strategies #42 through #45 can help you out.
If you’re just beginning to get your financial house in order, we suggest you 
start with Part I and possibly work through to Part IV. If you’re getting closer 
to retirement, you may want to peruse Parts I and II and skip to Part V. If 
you’re already in retirement, Part VI is specifically for you.

Part I
Laying a Solid 
Foundation

In this part . . .
B
efore you make any investment decision, you can 
benefit by balancing current events with some his-
torical perspective. Life is full of uncertainties, so in this 
part, you get a thorough review of some personal financial 
planning strategies that’ll help you minimize or avoid 
many of the financial uncertainties you face.

#1
Keep Your Feet on the Ground
By Derek Lenington, CFP, and Dylan Ross, CFP
S
uccessful investors are grounded. They’re logical and disciplined, and 
they don’t let emotions drive investment decisions. Successful investors 
understand and embrace the idea that the economy is always uncertain; it may 
have seemed more certain in the past, but that’s with the benefit of hindsight.
The U.S. economy has cycled between good and bad times, and you can 
expect that trend to continue (see Strategy #2 for more historical perspec-
tive). Unless you think that trend will end and things will always be either 
good or bad forever, every bad period must be followed by a good period 
and every good stretch has to be followed by a bad one. The big unknown is 
how long each period will last.
People often focus on an unanswerable question: When are things going to 
turn around? When times are good, your investments do well and you hear 
rumors of bigger bonuses at work this year. The question of when it’ll all 
change seems less important, but the answer still remains uncertain. The 
question is much more pressing during the bad times, when investments 
haven’t performed well or talk of an economic recession picks up. However, if 
you embrace the fact that the economy is always uncertain, the strategies in 
this book can help you make better decisions about your investments.
This book is filled with information on the tactics, strategies, and steps you 
should take with your money. But this strategy is focused on how you — the 
key player in your financial life — need to prepare for and approach your 
finances. The following guidelines will help you ensure that your attitude, 
decisions, and behavior truly support your desire to invest successfully 
during uncertain times.
Invest in Yourself
You are your biggest asset, thanks to your ability to earn money, and you 
need to protect and develop that asset. This means more than the occasional 
doctor’s visit and a jog around the block. You can let yourself sink into a rut, 
afraid to move, or you can challenge yourself to move ahead and earn a new 
degree; seek out a new, potentially more rewarding job; or master new tech-
nologies and apply them in your professional and/or personal life.

8
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation
You may also need to retool your physical plant, so to speak — losing weight, 
improving your focus and energy level with exercise, or budgeting for addi-
tions to your wardrobe so you feel good about the way you look.
 
No matter your age, show a real interest in being a part of fast-paced change, 
or risk being considered a dinosaur (remember — they’re extinct). Not only 
do these steps better position you for the uncertainties of life discussed in 
Part I, but they also help you increase your value:
 
 Make yourself indispensable at work. See Strategy #4 for tips about 
beefing up your networking efforts, sharpening your skills or adding new 
ones, and going back to school.
 
 Exercise, eat well, and get enough sleep. Strength and flexibility, 
proper nourishment, and a good night’s sleep may increase your pro-
ductivity and help to keep your mind sharp.
 
 Be creditworthy. For tips on improving your credit and debt, see 
Strategies #10 and #11.
 
 Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize. Making more money sounds great, but 
at what expense? Take some time to get your priorities in order and find 
the balance that works for you. Think about family, sleep, and mental 
and physical health.
 
 Talk to someone. If your finances are causing you mental and/or emo-
tional stress — or distress — get help! A financial professional can help 
you take control of your finances and map out a plan for you to succeed. 
If financial concerns are only one of a number of issues causing you to 
feel overwhelmed, speaking with a counselor or other mental health pro-
fessional can help lighten that load, which will make everything on your 
plate more manageable.
Know Your Financial Situation
It’s impossible to make the best financial decisions without first under-
standing your current personal financial situation. You need to assess your 
strengths and weaknesses as well as the current economic environment. This 
check-up can produce anxiety — you have areas of relative strength and ones 
needing improvement — but that’s okay. What’s not okay is to avoid putting 
together a plan that improves the areas that need shoring up. (Part I of this 
book can help you assess your financial health across a range of important 
categories.)
 
If you need help with your self assessment or financial review, consider hiring 
a fee-only financial planner to help. Because fee-only planners don’t sell prod-
ucts or receive commission, their advice isn’t constrained to certain prod-
ucts and will be in your best interest. Membership organizations such as the 
National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (www.napfa.org) and 

9
  #1: Keep Your Feet on the Ground
the Garrett Planning Network (www.garrettplanningnetwork.com) are 
good resources. You can also check the Certified Financial Planner Board of 
Standards, Inc., (www.cfp.net) to make sure the planner you’ve selected is a 
CFP certificant, ensuring a minimum level of training and competency.
Strategies #9 through #15 can help you address areas that are often weak 
links, and Parts II and III can give you various tools and techniques you can 
use to make change happen. If you haven’t yet thought about retirement in 
a concrete way, Parts V and VI offer spending and investment strategies to 
reduce the risk you’ll outspend your resources.
Keep Your Emotions in Check
Fear and greed are two powerful emotions that influence your investment 
decisions for better or worse (usually for worse). Completely ignoring emo-
tions is a tall order for most folks. Remember that although worrying is okay 
at times, you have to work around these powerful emotions to be a success-
ful investor. Keep these tips in mind when managing your emotions:
 
 Acknowledge your emotions. Admit when you’re feeling fearful or 
greedy. Only by acknowledging your feelings can you guard against their 
influence on your actions. You can’t discount fear as an influence on 
your decisions until you first admit that you’re afraid.
 
 Don’t wait for the feelings of fear or greed to go away before you act. 
They may never completely vanish. This book can help you develop 
financial plans and strategies to guide your decision making. When your 
emotions surge, refer to this book to stay on course.
 
 Understand how emotions fit into the economic cycle. You probably 
feel best about investing when markets have been going up, up, up. The 
higher the recent increase, the better you may feel about putting you 
money in. But only people who already had their money in the market, 
before it started going up, got those big, attractive gains. They had their 
money in the market when it didn’t feel best.
 
 Remember, everyone’s in the same boat. If the economy is slowing 
down or contracting, it also impacts your neighbors, co-workers, other 
consumers, and producers. You’re not being left behind while everyone 
else is passing you by.
 
 Avoid people who try to exploit your feelings. Turn off the financial 
channels. Their programming is intended to play to your emotions to 
keep you tuned in. If you have to watch, remember that it’ll be sensa-
tionalized at times. News editors need to make the news sound exciting, 
even when it’s really not.
 
 Don’t dwell on things beyond your control. Instead, focus on what you 
can control. (See the next section.)

Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation
Control What You Can
Events that influence your personal financial situation fall into one of two 
categories: events that you can control and events you can’t. It’s important 
to recognize things that are out of your control, but don’t dwell on their 
outcomes. Focus on what you can control. You have no control over the fol-
lowing: inflation, tax increases, stock market returns, interest rates, and what 
others are doing. But here’s what you can control:
 
 How much you spend
 
 Your level of personal finance and investing knowledge
 
 Where you put your hard-earned money (see Part II for detail)
 
 How much risk you take (see Part III)
 
 How you react to what you can’t control
Put Your Goals in Writing
You may have heard the old saying “If it isn’t being measured, it probably 
won’t change; and if it does change, you probably won’t notice.” This holds 
true for financial goals, too. Part IV is all about setting and achieving goals, 
from buying a home to raising children and preparing for retirement. Setting 
realistic goals is important, but it’s equally important that you devise a 
system for tracking your progress. You’ll enjoy checking off your progress as 
you reach your milestones.
 
You may be tempted to give yourself a bit too much leeway in meeting your 
targets, so have someone keep you on track. You’ll benefit from finding an 
accountability coach to work with: a spouse, partner, or friend. Coaches don’t 
need to know every intimate detail, but they do need to know the following:
 
 Your goal
 
 The info you’ll be reporting
 
 How often you’ll give them an update
Offer to do the same in return — keep it fun and get started.

Realize That This Has Happened 
Before (And Will Happen Again)
By Debbra Dillon, CFP
U
ncertain economic times come and go. These times can be especially 
challenging if you aren’t prepared for them. No one knows exactly 
when a major economic event will occur or what it’ll look like, but if you’re 
prepared, you stand a good chance of weathering it.
When you’re preparing for uncertain economic times, understanding what’s 
happened in the past can help. History provides clues to help you avoid 
common mistakes made during challenging times. So what kinds of events 
create uncertain economic times, and what clues do they hold for you today? 
This strategy takes a look at three types of events that can unexpectedly 
affect your financial security.
Weathering Major Economic Events
Most major economic events, such as stock market crashes, happen when 
a normal economic cycle gets out of balance. Have you had the experience 
of looking forward to an extravagant dinner, and then as soon as dinner 
arrives, eating until you felt you’d burst? Afterward, you regret indulging and 
swear you won’t do it again, but after a while, you forget the uncomfortable 
experience and start making plans for another indulgent meal. This is how 
economic cycles work, too: You see periods of rapid growth often inspired 
by exciting technological advances. Occasionally, investors overindulge and 
a bubble develops. Unfortunately, when the bubble bursts, people have to 
suffer until things even out again.
Stock market bubbles and crashes
One of the most famous bubbles of the last century occurred in the so-called 
Roaring Twenties, which came to a startling end with the stock market crash 
of 1929. The overindulgence of credit and spending combined with wild 
speculation in the stock market led to the Great Depression, which lasted 

12
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation
about ten years. Will the U.S. experience another depression like the Great 
Depression? Who knows, but you can prepare yourself just in case. Here’s 
how to position yourself well:
 
 Steer clear of consumer debt. In the Great Depression, those in debt got 
hammered when it came time to pay up.
 
 Pay your mortgage off as soon as possible. Minimizing your mortgage 
debt is also a smart thing to do. Having too much debt — of any kind — 
puts you in jeopardy if times get really tough and you lose your income, 
run out of savings, and can’t borrow more money.
 
 Save for emergencies. Those with cash set aside are able to roll with 
the punches.
 
 Take advantage of future investment opportunities. Some people took 
advantage of lucrative investment opportunities — believe it or not, 
some people actually prospered during the Great Depression.
 
 Develop a broad skill set. Jobs were extremely hard to come by during 
the Depression, and those with a wide range of skills had an easier time 
finding employment.
Although depressions are rare, stock market bubbles and ensuing crashes 
are not. In fact, since the end of World War II, the United States has had 12 
occasions in which the stock market lost more than 20 percent of its value. 
But take heart; over that same period, the market gained 7,079 percent, in 
spite of the crashes.
Bubbles are surprisingly similar to each other. Take the dot-com bubble of 
the 1990s that burst in 2000. As in the 1920s, investors believed that easy 
riches could be had in the stock market. Internet and technology stock prices 
soared to dizzying heights until the bubble burst in March 2000 and the party 
ended. The dot-com bust didn’t lead to a depression, but it did do a lot of 
damage to people’s investments. Here’s how to avoid getting hurt when a 
stock market bubble bursts:
 
 Maintain a diversified portfolio. Investors who were seriously injured 
in the tech wreck had most of their money in dot-com and technology 
stocks. If you have a diversified portfolio and remain invested for the 
long term, don’t panic when a bubble bursts. Stay the course and let the 
market work things out.
 
 Avoid the next hot investment. Resist the urge to get caught up in the 
irrational exuberance of new technology.
Real estate bubbles and crashes
Bubbles aren’t limited to just the stock market. The housing bubble started 
in 2001 as speculators fled the stock market and set their sights on real 

13
 #2: Realize That This Has Happened Before (And Will Happen Again)
estate, sending home values up. When housing prices started to deflate, 
some homeowners found they owed more on their mortgage than their house 
was worth. As low introductory interest rates reset to higher rates, many 
homeowners found themselves unable to pay their mortgages. Foreclosures 
skyrocketed. When the bubble burst, it left a credit crisis unseen since the 
Great Depression. You’ll know the full effects of the 2007–2008 real estate 
burst when you read about it in the history books. To protect you from a real 
estate crash, do the following:
 
 Don’t rely on your mortgage lender or real estate agent to tell you 
how much house you can afford. Work out your budget and make sure 
you can afford the mortgage payment along with associated housing 
expenses.
 
 Put at least a 10-percent (preferably 20-percent) down payment on the 
home. Pass on zero–down payment financing. If you can’t afford a down 
payment, you likely can’t afford the home.
 
 If you don’t plan on being in a house for at least five years, don’t buy 
one. Rent instead. In most cases, breaking even on a home purchase 
takes at least five years due to the costs involved in buying and selling a 
home.
 
 Avoid using home equity lines of credit for consumer purchases. Use 
home equity lines of credit exclusively for emergency purposes.
 
 Don’t rely on a home equity line of credit as your sole source of emer-
gency funds. Keep your emergency funds in cash reserve accounts, 
like savings accounts or money market mutual funds. If, however, you 
deplete these accounts in a prolonged emergency, you can then turn to 
your home equity line of credit.
Rapidly rising commodity prices
Not all economic events are caused by speculative bubbles. The Arab Oil 
Embargo in 1973 forced gas prices to quadruple from 25 cents to over a 
dollar per gallon. People waited in line for gasoline for hours. The economy 
slipped into a recession, which led to a nasty decade of rising unemployment 
and double-digit inflation. Take these steps to prepare for periods of rapidly 
rising commodity prices:
 
 Consider economizing your energy use. Ride your bicycle or drive a fuel-
efficient car. Invest in energy-efficient appliances in your home.
 
 Maintain an emergency fund to cover unexpected price increases.
 
 Purchase staples in bulk.

14
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation
Standing Strong During Political Events
Political events are often unanticipated and shocking. Assassinations and ter-
rorist attacks can tempt you to panic. Historically, these types of events have 
caused only short-term economic uncertainty. Take John F. Kennedy’s assas-
sination on November 22, 1963. The market lost 3 percent on November 22 as 
people panicked and sold their stock. However, on November 26, the market 
not only recovered that tragic day’s losses but was actually up 4.5 percent. It 
pays to stay invested.
The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the 
Pentagon shocked the U.S. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 7.1 percent 
in one day and by the end of the week had fallen 14.3 percent, its biggest one-
week point drop in history. Fortunately, the Dow recovered its lost ground in 
two months. Here’s how to stay safe during an unexpected political event:
 
 Don’t panic. Knee-jerk reactions will almost always come back to 
haunt you.
 
 Maintain a diversified portfolio. This is the single best way to weather 
economic uncertainty.
Witnessing Global Conflicts
You may think that wars would have a negative impact on the economy, 
but actually, for the most part, the opposite has occurred. World War II was 
the most costly war in terms of government expenditures and human lives. 
Gearing up for and supporting the war actually produced a booming econ-
omy. The Korean War and the Persian Gulf War had similar effects, although 
a recession did follow the Gulf War in 1992.
On the other hand, the Vietnam War and the War on Terror have had rela-
tively negative effects on the economy. The Vietnam War lasted for 16 years, 
and the average return for the S&P 500 during that time period was a dismal 
3.91 percent. Likewise, the average return for the S&P 500 for 2001 through 
2007 was a depressing 3.02 percent. Here’s how to survive long periods of 
low market returns:
 
 Don’t depend on high investment returns when planning for your retire-
ment or other financial goals.
 
 Keep investing periodically throughout these periods.
 
 Include fixed-income investments, such as government bonds and cer-
tificates of deposit, in your portfolio.

Plan for Life’s Uncertainties
By Denisa Tova, CLU, ChFC, CFDP, CFP
I
t’s a bright, beautiful morning, and you walk outside, feeling on top of the 
world. You set your coffee cup on top of the car, and you realize that the 
cup is slanted. Either the horizon has changed or something’s wrong with 
your car. You look down, and suddenly you’re not having such a great day. 
You have a flat tire.
Or it’s a bright, beautiful morning, and your telephone rings. Your real estate 
agent tells you the property on the lake that you’ve wanted for years has just 
been put on the market. Now you’re really feeling on top of the world. But a 
thought crosses your mind: Do you have enough money set aside? It’s such 
short notice!
Life can throw you curves that may be frustrations or opportunities. But life 
doesn’t always pick the best time for whatever’s happening in the financial 
markets. In this strategy, you discover how to make sure your savings are 
ready — even if the market isn’t.
Keep an Eye on What’s Going On
For years, the market may grow with gusto and vigor and then suddenly turn 
south. Likewise, many of the goals that you plan for throughout your life — 
such as going to college, getting married, buying a house, having children, 
helping pay for your children’s education and weddings, and at long last 
enjoying your retirement — may suddenly turn out to be more expensive 
than you thought. Other factors can increase the uncertainty of reaching 
your goals, too. Consider the following:
 
 College costs are growing at nearly twice the current inflation rate.
 
 Companies are cutting back on or entirely cutting out their traditional 
defined benefit pension plans.
 
 New retirees may need 70 to 80 percent or more of their current income 
to maintain their standard of living.
 
 Healthcare costs are rising at twice the rate of inflation while the median 
annual income for a couple drops from $48,551 to $16,770 after retirement.

16
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation
 
 Social Security and Medicare both face cutting benefits at some point in 
the future.
 
 Unexpected events around the world can send inflation soaring at the 
same time the economy is slowing down or in a recession.
Good financial planning involves setting objectives, developing a plan to get 
from where you are to where you want to go, and then monitoring what’s 
happening and making adjustments when needed. Monitor such things as the 
national economy, your local economy, your job and your employer, your 
family situation, and your personal life. Part of your plan should include ways 
to deal with unexpected situations. Stay aware at all times of how each thing 
you monitor affects your planning; by doing so, you’re able to adjust your 
plan and keep heading in the right direction.
Motivate Yourself to Save 
and Develop a Plan
If you haven’t planned ahead like you need to, it’s never too late. You don’t 
have to become a recluse, take up basket weaving, or try hang gliding to 
relieve your troubled mind. Nor should you just work as long as you can and 
hope for the best or buy a lottery ticket each week.
Do yourself a big favor by starting to plan today. Planning means that you 
protect your future, live comfortably, and know your options.
Practically speaking, that means that you may need to motivate yourself to 
save money. Think of it this way: If you lost $20 down a drain in the road, 
would you recover? Would your life continue? Would you starve, or would 
you just have to buy less ice cream and fewer DVDs? How about $100? That’d 
be a harder hit, but you should still be able to withstand the blow.
If you haven’t thought before about what kinds of uncertainties can sabotage 
your financial goals or what unexpected opportunities might pop up, now’s 
the time to start thinking about them. And now’s the time to start saving your 
money for future contingencies rather than spending on stuff you can do 
without. The reality of life is that things like ice cream and DVDs are ways to 
throw your money down the drain. You know they’re fun to have, but think 
about the overwhelming anxiety that can occur when something bad hap-
pens or when you’re financially unprepared for a good opportunity. That 
anxiety far outweighs the benefits of seeing the latest movie or getting your 
chocolate fix.

17
 #3: Plan for Life’s Uncertainties
If saving and self-restraint are words that aren’t normally part of your vocabulary, 
you can motivate yourself to start saving and keep saving with these five steps:
 
1. Adjust your attitude.
 
 When you save money, think of it as buying your future.
 
2. Give thought to all the life events that may be possible and decide 
which ones you want to be a part of your life.
 
 Those life events may be starting a business, buying a house or vacation 
home, traveling, or doing other activities that bring balance to your life.
 
3. Create two funds and start to save money for your goals.
 
 Make sure you have the following funds:
 
• An emergency fund (see Strategy #10 for details on a rainy-day 
fund)
 
• A make-my-life-great fund (see Strategy #13 for more on setting 
goals)
 
4. Build a portfolio, even if you’re still in debt.
 
 Why? Because you’ll do whatever is necessary to keep afloat financially, 
so you’re already motivated to pay those credit card bills. Keep paying 
them and start saving toward your life goals.
 
5. Don’t let anything intimidate you.
 
 It doesn’t matter how small the amounts you save seem at first. 
Remember that they’ll grow over time.
 
If all the details of planning seem overwhelming, seek professional help. 
You can find a Certified Financial Planner in your area by searching at 
www.cfp.net or by going through the Garrett Planning Network at www.
garrettplanningnetwork.com.
Finally, remember that putting money aside and into your checking, sav-
ings, or money market accounts isn’t enough (for more on cash investments, 
see Strategy #16). These accounts are fine to park cash that you may need 
in the short-term, say within three to five years, but they’re poor choices 
to fund retirement needs 10, 20, or even 30 years in the future. To make all 
your financial sacrifices worth the trouble, you need to invest the money you 
set aside in one or more portfolios (depending on the length of time to each 
goal). This book discusses investment types and how to build a portfolio in 
Parts II, III, IV, and V.

Protect Your Ability to Earn Income
By Gwen Gepfert
I
n today’s uncertain economy, job changes are sometimes forced on 
people when companies go out of business, lay off employees due to cost 
savings measures, or just downsize due to competitive pressures. Take the 
following quiz to see whether you’re prepared to face the next round of cuts:
 
 Have you conducted a recent (and honest!) assessment of your 
strengths and weaknesses at work?
 
 Have you recently reviewed your job description to make sure that 
you’re exceeding in your job responsibilities?
 
 Do you hear about jobs that are available in other companies but aren’t 
advertised?
 
 When your co-workers leave your company to take a new job, do they 
recommend you for any open positions in their new company?
 
 Have you found easy ways to gain further education or training in your 
chosen career?
If you didn’t answer yes to all these questions, perhaps you’re not as secure 
in your current job as you imagine or as well prepared to make a job change. 
Your career and financial goals are too important to leave in the hands of 
your employer. Don’t let yourself be surprised or unprepared. Instead, con-
centrate on meeting the recommendations in this strategy.
Make Yourself Indispensible
No one is 100 percent indispensable, but you should strive to become an 
employee that your company would have difficulty replacing. Not only does 
this strategy reduce the likelihood of your receiving a layoff notification, but it 
also puts you in the driver’s seat in terms of potential promotions, raises, and 
other workforce benefits. Here are some ways to become almost irreplaceable:
 
 Take initiative. Take on new responsibilities outside of your current job 
description. Bring your manager solutions, not new problems. Jump in 
to help your company when staff vacancies occur.

19
 #4: Protect Your Ability to Earn Income
 
 Keep your skills up-to-date. Stay current in your field of knowledge. 
Read industry magazines and reports, monitor pending legislation and 
technology advancements, and learn new software that can make you 
more efficient.
 
 Develop an impeccable reputation of dependability. Do your home-
work and be prepared for meetings and projects. Meet deadlines. Be 
punctual. Take responsibility for your actions and mistakes to highlight 
your professional integrity.
 
 Be a considerate and positive team player. Maintain a positive attitude 
and don’t keep company with complainers or naysayers. Be nice to your 
co-workers and support them. Prove yourself to be trustworthy and 
someone for inexperienced members of your organization to look up to.
 
It takes a lot of hard work to establish a positive reputation, but it’s fairly easy 
to develop a negative one. Pay attention to how others perceive you and listen 
openly to performance feedback. Take prompt measures to fix any issues that 
have resulted in your being viewed as less than a model employee.
Boost Your Networking Skills
One crucial skill during uncertain economic times is your ability to network. 
Professional relationships can be a great source of referrals to potential job 
openings. Don’t let shyness get in your way of building a strong list of per-
sonal contacts. Follow these simple steps:
 
 Always be open to meeting new people. Start conversations with 
strangers, and don’t forget to exchange business cards. Join profes-
sional organizations and go to meetings to develop a wider range of 
contacts.
 
 Keep your contact information organized and easily accessible. You 
never know when you may need to ask someone to make an introduc-
tion for you into a company. Consider creating a database or special file 
of contacts. Be sure to keep in touch so you can stay abreast of changes 
in their career as well as contact information.
 
 Never burn bridges when you leave a job. Previous co-workers or 
supervisors can provide great leads to potential jobs as well as provide 
informal personal references.
 
 Write articles for trade or industry periodicals. Not only is it fun to 
see your name in print, but you also increase your professional profile 
within your industry.

20
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation
 
 Remember that networking is a two-way street. Your professional rela-
tionships can be a great asset to you throughout your career, but don’t 
drop the ball when someone asks you for help.
 
 Don’t forget to thank your contacts for their help. A personalized 
thank-you note goes a long way to show your appreciation for the help 
you received. Remember that you may need their help again someday.
 
Many open jobs are filled by word of mouth. Most employers are more com-
fortable hiring applicants who are recommended by trusted employees or 
partners versus hiring qualified candidates who just walk in from the street. 
Make sure your contacts are recommending you for these jobs!
 
Even if you’re content in your job, always keep your eyes open for new and 
better opportunities. Many of the best career opportunities come when you’re 
least expecting them. In case you want to respond to a sudden opportunity, 
make sure your resume is up to date and relevant. (Resumes For Dummies, 
5th Edition, written by Joyce Lain Kennedy and published by Wiley, contains 
many helpful hints for preparing your resume.)
Broaden Your Skill Set
Today’s most effective employees don’t allow life’s circumstances to get in 
the way of their full income potential. These individuals embrace the concept 
of lifelong learning, finding this journey both rewarding and enjoyable. Make 
a conscious effort to develop your own plan for continuing to learn and grow 
in your job. These simple steps allow you to be better prepared for your next 
job opportunity:
 
 Conduct a personal skill review. Check your last company performance 
evaluation and make sure you’re actively improving noted areas of weak-
ness. Compare your skills to those required by new jobs you may pursue — 
the Internet is a great resource for conducting both skill and salary 
research.
 
 Develop a career path. Create a roadmap that can take you from your 
current job to your dream job. Break it into a series of realistic baby 
steps. Document the skills required to take you from today’s job to 
tomorrow’s.
 
 Capitalize on your natural skills and interests. When people do what 
they love, success becomes a natural byproduct. Build on your strengths 
by finding ways to improve your skills in your current position.
 
 Act now, while you’re still employed. Having the right skills and quali-
fications for any position you apply for is essential, so start developing 
those new skills or get the training while you’re still employed.

21
 #4: Protect Your Ability to Earn Income
 
 Take advantage of easily accessible training tools. There are many 
simple ways to gain additional training; you just need to look for them. 
They include the following:
 
• Reading business books and training manuals
 
• Watching training videos
 
• Attending industry seminars and conferences
 
• Researching industry topics on the Internet
 
• Learning from a mentor
 
• Attending adult education classes
 
• Downloading podcasts to your MP3 player and listening to them in 
your car or while you exercise
Go Back to School
Whether you’re going back to school to gain a competitive edge in the job 
market, obtaining additional education to keep current with changes in your 
field, or working toward your dream job, have a plan to choose the right 
school:
 
1. Select a certification or degree that’s widely recognized.
 
2. Pick an accredited school.
 
3. Decide how you want to attend classes.
 
4. Leave no stone unturned when looking for financial assistance.
 
Ask your human resources office whether your company offers a tuition assis-
tance program or whether you’ll be reimbursed for all or a portion of your 
tuition. Visit your school’s financial aid officer to see whether you’re eligible 
for any low cost loans, assistanceships, fellowships, scholarships, or grants. 
Research private grants or scholarships. Depending on your family income 
level, you may qualify for the Hope Credit or Lifetime Learning Credit (see 
www.irs.ustreas.gov/taxtopics/tc605.html). Also prepare a free 
application for federal student aid at www.fafsa.ed.gov; it can’t hurt to give 
it a try!

Assess Your Medical Insurance
By Helga Cuthbert, CFP
C
hoosing the right healthcare insurance coverage can be daunting and 
complex. The many different models all have unique features. To get the 
coverage you need at the best value, assess your situation, know the jargon 
of the industry and the plans offered, and then determine what works best 
for you.
Know the Lingo
Health plan documents are full of jargon, but don’t be intimidated. Here are 
some helpful definitions of terms you may come across:
 
 Cap: The maximum amount the insurance company will pay over a 
lifetime
 
 Claim form: A form that either you or your healthcare provider must 
complete and send to the insurance company to receive payment for 
services rendered
 
 Coinsurance: Percentage of the healthcare bill you have to pay after the 
deductible
 
 Co-payment (or co-pay): Out-of-pocket charge for a visit to the doctor or 
hospital
 
 Covered expenses: Those expenses the insurance company agrees to 
pay for; not all expenses are covered by the plan
 
 Customary fee: The amount most healthcare providers charge for a par-
ticular service; sometimes called usual and customary
 
 Deductible: Out-of-pocket expenses before the insurance plan begins 
paying
 
 Exclusion: Services not covered by the insurance company
 
 In-network: The insurance company selects this list of healthcare pro-
viders you can choose from to avoid higher costs
 
 Maximum out-of-pocket expenses: The most you have to pay in a year 
for deductibles and coinsurance

23
 #5: Assess Your Medical Insurance
 
 Out-of-network: Licensed healthcare providers who aren’t on the in-
network list
 
 Premium: Annual cost of the insurance coverage
 
 Third-party payer: Anyone, other than you, who pays for your care
Examine the Types of Healthcare Plans
The two basic types of health insurance plans are traditional care and man-
aged care. The following sections give you the details you need to distinguish 
between the two.
Traditional care plans
Traditional care insurance is also known as fee for services or indemnity 
plans. Traditional plans have the following features:
 
 You generally pay higher out-of-pocket expenses at the time of service, 
including expenses up to a set deductible limit.
 
 After meeting deductible limits, you share the bill with the insurance 
company. For example, you may pay 20 percent while the insurance 
company pays 80 percent. You continue sharing the bill until you reach 
your maximum out-of-pocket expenses; then the insurance company 
pays 100 percent of your expenses up to its cap.
 
 You may be responsible for keeping track of expenses and submitting 
requests for reimbursement from the insurance company.
 
 The insurance company pays for only usual and customary expenses. 
Any additional charges are your responsibility.
 
 Not all insurance companies offer wellness or preventative care with 
this type of plan.
 
 The insurance company usually has few restrictions on which medical 
providers, including specialists, you use.
 
 If your plan is considered a catastrophic or high-deductible major medi-
cal health plan, it will have lower annual premiums than a plan with a 
lower deductible.
 
Traditional plans are becoming increasingly scarce as insurance companies 
move to the managed care plans outlined in the following section.

24
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
Managed care plans
Managed care health plans involve an arrangement between the insurance 
company and a select network of healthcare providers. These providers are 
referred to as in-network providers. Most of these plans cover wellness care 
or preventative care — such as well-baby care, doctor visits, and mammo-
grams — at varying levels.
Three basic categories of managed care are Preferred Provider (PPO), Point of 
Service (POS), and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO).
PPO
A PPO allows you the most flexibility to choose your healthcare providers 
within the managed care options. For that flexibility you or your employer 
will pay higher costs for insurance than you would with a POS or HMO.
Following are some features of PPO plans:
 
 Although your co-pay is usually small, you may have deductibles. If you 
go outside the network, your co-pay is generally higher and you’re likely 
to pay a larger portion of the bill yourself.
 
 You can usually see a specialist without getting preapproval from your 
primary care physician, as long as your specialist is in-network. Going 
to a specialist out-of-network raises any co-pay amount and your total 
costs.
 
 If you go out-of-network, you may have to submit claims forms.
POS
POS plans are similar to PPO plans, but you have to choose an in-network 
primary care physician who manages your care and refers you to a specialist 
when needed.
Following are some additional features of POS plans:
 
 Insurance premiums for POS plans are typically lower than with a PPO 
and higher than an HMO.
 
 If you choose to see a specialist without being referred by your primary 
care physician, you pay more in out-of-pocket expenses.
 
 You may have to file your own claims forms unless you’re being treated 
by your primary care physician.
 
 Out-of-network providers can be much more expensive. You’ll likely pay 
10 percent more out-of-pocket to see an out-of-network provider than 
you would if you went in-network.

HMO
HMO plans are designed to provide you with quality healthcare at the lowest 
price. To manage costs, HMOs drastically limit your options for healthcare 
providers. But they do value preventative healthcare. They realize that pre-
vention is cheaper than treatment. Following are some HMO features:
 
 They usually have the lowest premiums.
 
 These plans are least flexible in the selection of service providers.
 
 Patients must choose an in-network primary care physician who controls 
referrals. You can’t refer yourself to a specialist or go out-of-network 
without paying the full cost of the service. And think twice before running 
to the emergency room. If the reason for your visit isn’t deemed an emer-
gency by your HMO, you could get stuck with the bill.
Ask Yourself Some Questions
Now that you know the ins and outs of the various plans, here are some ques-
tions to ask before choosing a plan for you and your family:
 
 Do you currently have doctors you want to continue visiting, and do 
you want the freedom of choosing other doctors if additional care is 
required? If so, avoid HMOs altogether. PPO and POS plans can work, but 
traditional care plans are best because they allow maximum flexibility.
 
 Are you aware of any upcoming medical events, like surgery or start-
ing a family? If you’re thinking of switching plans, make sure preexisting 
problems or maternity costs are covered. Find out whether there’s a 
waiting period before coverage begins.
 
 Do you have children entering college? Again, HMOs may not be your 
best option. Check your PPO and POS plans to see whether any physi-
cians and hospitals in the college area are acceptable to the network. 
Out-of-network expenses can be prohibitive.
 
 Do you plan on having periodic wellness checkups? HMOs are your 
best bet financially because wellness checkups are usually encouraged 
with no additional co-pays. Traditional care plans often don’t cover 
regular checkups, so all costs must come out-of-pocket until you reach 
the full deductible. PPO and POS plans usually require a co-payment for 
regular checkups, flu shots, and blood tests.
 
 Do you hate filling out claims and keeping receipts? A managed care 
plan is probably best for you, assuming that you’re willing to stay in-
network. Traditional care plans are often reimbursable plans in which 
you pay costs upfront and then submit paperwork for reimbursement.

Assess Your Disability Insurance
By Neil Vannoy, MBA
D
isability insurance (DI) can help alleviate the financial burden by replac-
ing a portion of your income if you become disabled. Be prepared for 
the uncertain economic times that could result from a disability by taking 
time to assess your DI coverage.
 
Disability insurance protects your ability to earn a living. Especially in uncer-
tain economic times, don’t underestimate the importance of insuring your 
paycheck.
The Nuts and Bolts of 
Disability Insurance
Following is a rundown of what you need to know about disability insurance:
 
 What’s covered: Most DI policies cover disabilities that result from 
accidents, though some also cover disabilities resulting from illness. 
Because younger people are more likely to become disabled from an 
accident and older people are more likely to become disabled from an 
illness, you need to know what kind of coverage your policy provides.
 
 How much coverage: Benefits are usually between 40 and 70 percent of 
your income. Why don’t insurance companies cover a higher percentage 
of your income? Well, how much incentive would you have to recover 
and return to work if you could earn the same amount watching TV?
 
 Qualifying for payments: Before you can collect benefits from your DI 
policy, you have to satisfy the elimination period, or waiting period. This 
is the insurance company’s way of making sure you’re really disabled 
before they go through the trouble of sending you money. The elimina-
tion period varies with each policy. It also works like a deductible, keep-
ing premiums lower.

27
 #6: Assess Your Disability Insurance
 
 How long payments last: DI policies can have either a short- or long-
term benefit period. Short-term policies usually pay benefits for three to 
six months, although some provide benefits for up to two years. The 
elimination period for short-term policies generally ranges from 1 to 14 
days.
 
 The benefit period for long-term policies can range from a few years to 
the rest of your life. The most popular benefit period for long-term poli-
cies is to age 65. The elimination period for long-term policies ranges 
from 30 to 365 days.
Look Under the Hood of a DI Policy
Here are some details to pay attention to — you can find them in the policy 
itself or as riders (optional amendments added to the policy).
Defining disability
So who decides whether you’re disabled? The insurance company, of course, 
so it’s important to know the definition of disability that’s in your policy:
 
 Own occupation: By this definition, you’re disabled if you can’t perform 
the duties of your usual job, even if you could do some other kind of 
work.
 
 Any occupation: You’re considered disabled only if you can’t work at 
any job that you’re qualified for by education, training, and experience.
 
 Total disability: You’re disabled only if you’re unable to work at any job 
at all. Yikes! You may be able to operate the timer on a deep fryer at a 
fast food restaurant, but would you want to? Try to get another defini-
tion of disability in your DI policy.
Tacking on riders
You may want to consider putting some of these additional provisions on 
your policy:
 
 Cost of living adjustment (COLA): This rider increases your benefit of 
your policy with inflation up to a maximum that you elect, generally 
from 4 to 10 percent. The benefit continues to increase every year that 
you remain disabled. This rider is extremely important, especially when 
you’re younger.

28
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
 
 Automatic increase: This rider usually allows for a total benefit increase 
of 20 to 25 percent over the first three to five years of the policy. Your 
premiums go up with the benefit.
 
 Future increase option (FIO): If you qualify for only a small amount of 
disability coverage now but expect to be making big bucks later in your 
career, you can guarantee that you can increase your coverage later, 
regardless of your health, by selecting the future increase option. This 
rider allows benefit increases — usually up to age 55 — by providing 
proof of higher income. You won’t have to prove insurability to get the 
increase!
 
 Social Security offset: This rider supplements your disability benefit 
if Social Security doesn’t pay the Maximum Family Benefit and if no 
benefits are payable under a State Disability Insurance program. It also 
supplements your disability benefit if Social Security pays no benefits 
and benefits are payable under a State Disability Insurance program.
 
 Waiver of premium: This rider waives any premiums while you’re dis-
abled. There’s a three-month elimination period, but premiums that 
were paid during the elimination period are generally refunded.
 
 Residual benefit (partial disability): This benefit allows you to return 
to work part-time while continuing to receive a portion of your benefits. 
Most policies require a minimum loss in earnings (such as a 20-percent 
reduction) to qualify for residual benefits.
Choosing renewability provisions
All DI policies contain renewability provisions that explain how your cover-
age will continue. Most policies are one of the following:
 
 Guaranteed renewable: The insurance company will continue to renew 
the policy, but the premiums can be increased for an entire group of 
policyholders (for instance it may be increased by state or occupational 
class).
 
 Non-cancelable and guaranteed renewable: The insurance company 
can’t cancel or raise the premiums.
 
 Conditionally renewable: Policies can be renewed at the insurer’s dis-
cretion. Unless you believe your insurance company has a big heart and 
loves you, you should stay away from these policies!
Purchase Your Policies
Many employers offer group coverage without a medical exam if you sign 
up during the initial enrollment period. Some preexisting conditions may be 

29
 #6: Assess Your Disability Insurance
excluded from group coverage for up to two years. Group DI is generally less 
expensive than an individual policy because most employers pay a portion of 
the premium. Some plans have a portability option that allows you to convert 
your group coverage to an individual policy when you leave your job.
You can purchase individual disability insurance directly from an insurance 
company or through an insurance broker. Unlike group insurance, you have 
to go through underwriting to get the policy. One of the greatest benefits of 
individual DI is that changes in your health, employment, or occupational 
class don’t affect your coverage after the policy is issued. Even if you become 
uninsurable in the future or switch to a risky occupation, your individual 
policy remains in force as long as you keep paying the premiums.
The higher the chance you could become disabled and the larger the benefit, 
the higher the premium. To see all the factors that go into it, check out the 
following chart:
Factor 
How It Affects the Premium
Age 
Premiums increase with age.
Gender 
 Women are at greater risk of disability than men, 
so their premiums are higher.
Occupation 
Riskier occupations have higher premiums.
Elimination period 
 You get your money faster with a shorter 
elimination period, but you also pay a higher 
premium.
Benefit amount 
 The more the potential benefit amount, the 
higher the premium.
Riders 
Adding riders increases the premium.
Definition of disability 
 Policies with more favorable definitions of dis-
ability (for instance, own occupation) have 
higher premiums than policies with less favor-
able definitions.
Renewability provision 
 The more guarantees about renewability, the 
higher the premium. (For instance, a non-
cancelable and guaranteed renewable policy has 
a higher premium than a conditionally renewable 
policy.)
 
Don’t forget about taxes! If you pay the premiums for your policy, the benefits 
you receive are generally tax-free. If your employer paid part or all of the pre-
miums, part or all of the benefits are taxable.

Assess Your Long-Term Care 
Insurance
By Louise Schroeder, CFP
I
nsurance policies probably aren’t on your list of fun reading material. 
They’re hard to understand, and as a result, very few people read them 
or know what to expect until they file a claim. But with long-term care (LTC) 
insurance, understanding the policy terms is critical to help you plan for the 
uncertainty of your later years.
Understand the Basics: General 
Policy Information
Check your insurance company’s financial rating, not only when you buy but 
also every year thereafter. Selecting a financially strong insurance company 
increases the likelihood of benefit payments when you need them, especially 
during periods of economic uncertainty. Businesses that rate insurance com-
panies include A.M. Best, Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, Fitch, and Weiss. Look 
for a rating that’s strong, excellent, or superior. 
Also know whether your policy is tax-qualified or non-tax-qualified. Depending 
on your age each year, the premiums for a tax-qualified policy may be partially 
or fully deductible as an itemized deduction on your income tax return; also, 
your benefit payments aren’t considered taxable income. Both of these bene-
fits can save you money. Policies sold today are generally tax-qualified, but the 
IRS hasn’t ruled on older, non-tax-qualified policies, so it’s uncertain whether 
their premiums and benefits receive the same treatment.
Likewise, make sure your policy is renewable. Policies sold today are renew-
able, but if you have an older policy, ask about this.
Also ask what your options are if the insurance company increases your pre-
mium and you can no longer afford it. Many companies have increased pre-
miums on one or more existing policies. Although you may purchase a policy 
from a company that has never raised premiums, you have no guarantee that 

31
 #7: Assess Your Long-Term Care Insurance
it won’t happen in the future. Ask whether premiums will be waived while 
you receive benefits.
 
Consider whether you could afford the premium if it were to increase by 30 
percent or more. Also, ask how you’d pay if you encounter financial difficulty. 
Unless you choose to pay premiums over a shorter period of time, such as ten 
years or until age 65, you’ll pay premiums until you start receiving benefits. 
Shorter premium payment periods greatly increase the premium paid.
Be clear on where your policy covers care. Most current policies cover care 
in a skilled nursing facility, an assisted living facility, a home (yours or that of 
someone you live with), an adult day care facility, a hospice home, or other 
living arrangements listed in the policy. Continuing care retirement communi-
ties include independent living, assisted living, and a skilled nursing unit, so 
you want a policy that offers comprehensive coverage.
If you plan to remain at home for as long as possible, be familiar with your 
policy’s respite care benefit. Check how many days per year are allowed for 
your caregiver to take a break, and what your options are for where respite 
care can be provided. If you do have to move to a care facility, know the 
number of days your policy will pay for reserving your room if you have to be 
in a medical facility or if you’ll be temporarily absent for other reasons.
Know How You Qualify for Benefits
The age of your LTC insurance policy determines the requirements for 
receiving benefits. Policies issued after 2000 generally require that you need 
substantial assistance with at least two of six activities of daily living, which 
include eating, bathing, dressing, transferring (from a bed to a chair or wheel-
chair), toileting (using the toilet), and managing incontinence.
Otherwise, you must need substantial supervision due to cognitive impair-
ment. Policies issued earlier than 2000 often have more lenient requirements.
The definitions of substantial assistance and substantial supervision are impor-
tant, too. These definitions vary widely in older policies and are much more 
consistent in newer policies. If these definitions don’t appear in your policy, 
contact the company.
Review Policy Conditions
Know who will write your plan of care. Many policies specify a certified home 
health practitioner of your choosing. Some policies make a care coordinator 

32
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
available. This person is usually paid directly or indirectly by the insurance 
company.
Some insurance companies offer incentives, such as a reduced or waived 
waiting period, if you use their care coordinator. And some companies actu-
ally penalize you if you don’t use their care coordinator by reducing certain 
benefits or eliminating a benefit. Be sure to understand the terms of your 
policy. If incentives are offered, find out what the additional premium would 
be if they were added as a rider. The insurance company has to make up 
these costs somewhere.
Select and Purchase Benefits
Your selection of LTC insurance benefits should be a part of a detailed long-
term care plan. The amount of the daily (or weekly or monthly) benefit you 
select should consider what services the policy does or doesn’t cover and 
where you receive those services. Your choice should also factor in other 
resources you will (or won’t) have. See Strategy #63 for more information.
Understand benefit payment
Know how much of your daily benefit will be paid. Here are some common 
options:
 
 Payment of the full benefit regardless of the actual expenses incurred: 
Newer policies may offer this as a rider that increases your premium. 
The trade-off is less use of your resources in the future.
 
 Payment of actual expenses up to the amount of the benefit: If actual 
expenses are less, the difference stays in the policy and may increase 
the amount of time over which benefits will be paid.
 
 Payment of the going rate for the service being billed: Find out how 
the going rate is determined. Is it the rate for the same service within the 
same care facility? Within the town, city, state, or region? The danger is 
a benefit less than the actual expense incurred.
The length of time you choose to receive benefits is important. Most policies 
offer benefit periods ranging from just one year up to as long as lifetime. The 
longer the time period, the larger the premium. However, the premium dif-
ference for a ten-year policy versus a lifetime policy is usually fairly small. 
Some policies may divide the benefits period into a specified number of years 
of care at home and a specified number of years in a facility. You have more 
flexibility with a benefit period that covers unlimited care in all places.

33
 #7: Assess Your Long-Term Care Insurance
Another important benefit is the waiting period. After you need care, this is 
how many days you wait before expenses are covered by your benefits. It’s 
similar to a deductible on other types of insurance. Waiting periods can run 
from 0 to 365 days or longer. The longer the period, the lower your premium. 
The higher inflation rate for long-term care may make a shorter waiting 
period a wise choice.
 
To make a more-informed decision, compare extra premium payments over 
the number of years until you may need long-term care to the cost of 30 or 60 
days of care today inflated over the same time period.
Maintain flexibility
For maximum flexibility and control, be sure the benefit amount is the same 
whether you receive care at home, in an assisted-living residence, or in a 
skilled-nursing residence. Some policies offer a 100-percent benefit for care 
in a skilled-nursing home and a reduced amount for care in your home. This 
factor may force a move to a care facility sooner than necessary.
Some policies have separate waiting periods for care at home, in an assisted-
living residence, and at a skilled nursing residence. Be sure you have to meet the 
waiting period only once during your lifetime. This applies to situations when 
you may receive care for a while and then not need care for a period of time.
Consider Inflation Protection
Long-term care insurance is something you may not use for many years, so 
consider inflation protection. Policies generally include this as a rider for an 
additional premium. Common benefits include the following:
 
 Simple inflation protection: Your daily benefit and total benefit 
amounts increase each year by a percentage that’s applied to the origi-
nal amount. 
 
 Compound inflation protection: Your benefit increases by a percentage 
each year that’s applied to the amount of the past year’s benefit. That 
means benefits will rise higher than with single inflation protection.
 
 Additional purchase inflation protection: You have an option to pur-
chase additional benefit increments periodically at prevailing rates for 
your age. Be sure you understand all conditions related to accepting or 
not accepting the increase in benefit.

Assess Your Life Insurance
By Neil Vannoy, MBA
O
ne of the most uncertain times for a family can be after the unexpected 
death of a loved one — especially someone the family depended on for 
financial support. Reviewing your life insurance coverage can help ensure 
your loved ones are protected if something happens to you.
Calculate Needed Coverage
Two simple methods to estimating your life insurance needs are the income 
replacement approach and the needs approach.
Income replacement approach
The income replacement approach to estimating life insurance needs has you 
predict how much you’ll earn from now until you retire. Here’s the formula:
Life insurance needs = annual income × years until retirement
For example, suppose Gail is 35 years old and plans on retiring in 30 years 
at age 65. She currently earns $65,000 per year. Gail’s life insurance needs = 
$1,950,000 (or $65,000 × 30).
Although the income replacement approach is great for a rough estimate, it 
doesn’t account for raises you may receive or for inflation.
Needs approach
The needs approach, which takes into account the short- and long-term 
needs of your beneficiaries, is more accurate than the income replacement 
approach and is the method used by most professionals. Here’s the formula:
Life insurance needs = money required for short- and long-term needs – 
available financial resources

35
 #8: Assess Your Life Insurance
 
When using this approach, be as accurate as possible. Inflation will affect the 
future value of your beneficiaries’ needs. Consider contacting a fee-only advi-
sor if you want help using the needs approach.
Compare Current Life Insurance 
Coverage to Your Calculated Need
After you know how much life insurance coverage you need, compare that 
amount to your current coverage. If you’re currently underinsured, you have 
two options:
 
 Replace your current life insurance policy (or policies) with a single 
policy. Most life insurance policies offer breakpoints (discounts) when 
you purchase large amounts of coverage, usually making it less expen-
sive to have one large policy rather than several small ones.
 
 Buy an additional policy. The cost of insurance increases as you age, 
so in some cases, purchasing an additional policy may be less expensive 
than replacing an old policy.
If you discover you have too much coverage, consider the following:
 
 Think about your future needs. If you foresee new kids, debts, or big 
raises on the horizon, or if your health has changed, you may want to 
hang on to what you have.
 
 If you’re sure you don’t need all your life insurance, you can usually 
reduce or simply cancel a policy. If you have a term policy, contact the 
agent about reducing the coverage or just stop paying the premium. 
If you do need part of the coverage, compare the cost of the reduced 
policy to your options on the market.
 
 If you have a permanent policy — either whole life or universal life 
— ask your agent for the net surrender value. This is the amount of 
your cash value that you get to keep after surrender charges. If you’re 
reducing coverage, there may still be a charge to your cash value, even 
though you’re keeping the policy. You may find that you’re better off 
keeping the policy, at least until the surrender charges no longer apply.
 
If you decide to replace an existing life insurance policy, never cancel your 
existing policy until you’ve obtained replacement insurance. Additionally, 
each state requires disclosure forms to anyone replacing existing life insur-
ance, so read them carefully.

36
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
Pick the Right Type of Life Insurance 
for Your Situation
There are two types of life insurance policies: term and permanent. Think term 
for a temporary need and permanent for needs that’ll last for your lifetime.
Term life insurance
Term life insurance covers a certain period of time, typically 10, 15, 20, or 30 
years. Consider matching the term of the policy to specific milestones, such 
as when children leave home, when college is paid for, or when you retire. 
You pay for the policy for the entire period. At the end of the term, the policy 
expires, just like auto or homeowner’s insurance. (For a higher premium, 
some term policies will return all premiums paid if no benefits are paid 
during the entire term.)
Term coverage costs less than permanent because it’s temporary and very 
few policies actually result in claims (that is, most are cancelled or expire). 
The lower cost of term insurance makes it a great choice if you have a limited 
budget and need a lot of coverage, but you don’t need permanent coverage.
Because term insurance expires, you may want a policy that allows you to 
renew the policy for an additional term or to switch to a permanent policy 
before the policy terminates:
 
 Renewable term insurance allows you to renew the policy at the end of 
the term without providing proof of insurability, although the premiums 
will increase because you’ll be renewing at a higher age.
 
 Non-renewable term insurance is less expensive than renewable term 
insurance because it automatically expires at the end of the term.
 
 Convertible term insurance allows you to convert term insurance to a 
permanent policy before the end of the term. Premiums on the perma-
nent policy are based on your age when you convert. This is a great way 
to secure low-cost coverage now and have the option to switch to a per-
manent insurance later.
 
 Non-convertible term insurance is less expensive than convertible term 
insurance because it doesn’t give you the right to convert it to a perma-
nent policy.

37
 #8: Assess Your Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance
Permanent life insurance doesn’t expire after a specific term, making it a 
good choice if you want to leave money to your kids, cover estate taxes, 
fund a charity, or ensure additional financial security for your loved ones. 
Permanent policies include an investment portion, referred to as the cash 
value. Premiums on permanent policies are higher than term premiums. 
A portion of each premium covers the cost of the life insurance and other 
policy expenses; the rest is credited to the cash value.
The life insurance cost is low at first, so most of the premium will be credited 
to the cash value in the early years. Less and less of the premium is credited 
to cash value as the cost of insurance increases with age. In most cases, if 
you pay enough premiums into your policy over a long time period, the cash 
value will be large enough to cover future premiums. Table 8-1 shows the 
three primary types of permanent life insurance policies and compares some 
of their features.

Feature a separate account in which you 
choose among subaccounts, similar to mutual 
funds; returns depend on what you select, 
though additional fees for subaccount manag-
ers make costs in a VUL higher than in other 
permanent policies
For most permanent policies, you can borrow against the cash value; any 
loans outstanding at time of death are deducted from the proceeds. UL poli-
cies allow you to withdraw from your cash value with no interest charges.
Unlike whole life policies, UL policies are completely transparent, meaning 
that the cost of insurance, expenses, and investment earnings are disclosed. 
And you can change the face value. Decreasing the face value is simple, but 
increasing the policy requires proof of insurability. In addition, you can 
select between two death benefit options:

38
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
 
 Option 1 (or A): The death benefit remains level.
 
 Option 2 (or B): The death benefit increases with the cash value.
 
Permanent policies are complex, so be sure to work with an agent who can 
help you understand the policy type that’s best for your situation.
Purchase Your Life Insurance
Calculate the amount of life insurance coverage you need, determine whether 
to increase your current coverage, and pick the best type of policy for your 
needs. Now it’s time to actually get the coverage. You can choose between an 
individual or group policy.
Opt into a group policy
Most employers provide group life insurance without underwriting (a medical 
exam to show evidence of insurability). In fact, employers can provide up to 
$50,000 of life insurance as a tax-free benefit to employees. Group insurance 
is a great option if you have health problems that would keep you from being 
approved for an individual policy.
Most group life insurance policies can be converted to individual policies 
without proof of good health when or if you leave your job, but a converted 
policy may be more expensive than an individual policy because you don’t 
have to prove insurability.
Go it alone with an individual policy
Individual policies are purchased directly from a life insurance company 
or through an insurance broker. Unlike group insurance, you can select the 
insurance company, the policy, and the coverage amount.
One of the greatest benefits of individual policies is portability. You don’t 
have to worry about losing coverage if you change jobs. And changes in your 
health don’t affect your coverage after the policy is issued. Consider an indi-
vidual policy for the bulk of your life insurance needs to ensure continued 
coverage regardless of changes in your employment or health. Use employer-
provided group life insurance to supplement your coverage.

Take Stock of Your Current 
Financial Picture
By Cheryl Krueger
F
inding a good path to your destination is difficult if you don’t know where 
you’re starting. During uncertain economic times, one of the first steps 
to meeting your major financial goals is to find out where you are now. A net 
worth statement is a great tool to find out where you are financially. As soon as 
you know where you are, you can compare that to where you want to be.
Prepare a Net Worth Statement
You may think of what you own and what you owe as the most important 
parts of your financial life, but it’s the combination of the two that truly mat-
ters. If you have $1 million in assets, that sounds like a lot. But what if you 
also owe $930,000 in mortgages, student loans, and credit card debt? The 
difference between your assets and your liabilities is your net worth, which is 
what gives you stability in times of financial uncertainty.
You can think of your current net worth statement as the You Are Here 
sticker on your financial map. Your net worth statement summarizes what 
you own, what you owe, and what would be left if you paid off everything you 
owed. Assets include money, investments, your house and furniture, your 
car, other real estate, and anything else you own. Liabilities include your 
mortgage, car loan, other loans, what you owe on your credit cards or other 
accounts, and any other amounts you owe to others. Here’s how to find your 
net worth:
Net worth = assets – liabilities
To meet many of your financial goals, you need to increase your net worth, 
either by increasing the amount of assets you have or by reducing your liabil-
ities. A regular review of your net worth statement tells you a lot about how 
you’re progressing. For example, you’ll be able to see the following:

40
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
 
 If you’re increasing your assets through saving or decreasing your 
assets through spending
 
 Whether your invested assets are growing at the rate you expect
 
 How you’re progressing toward eliminating your debt
 
 Whether you’re drawing down your assets too quickly during retirement 
or whether you’re able to afford that month-long European cruise after 
all
Preparing the net worth statement isn’t difficult; it just takes a bit of time and 
access to your financial statements. If you use personal finance software like 
Quicken or Microsoft Money, much of your net worth statement is available 
to you already. Figure 9-1 shows a sample net worth statement.

 #9: Take Stock of Your Current Financial Picture
Use the Net Worth Statement 
to Reach Your Goals
Tracking your net worth over a period of time can help you weather the ups 
and downs of an uncertain economy. By looking at the big picture, you don’t 
get as discouraged when an investment stumbles if other investments are 
still gaining in value. Knowing that a bump in the road doesn’t mean you’ll 
never reach your goal can help get you back on track to meeting your long-
term financial goals.
How does this work? Don’t simply complete one net worth statement and call 
it a day. Here’s how to look at your net worth:
 
1. Commit to how frequently you’ll calculate your net worth.
 
 This can be quarterly, semiannually, or annually. More frequently than 
quarterly is overkill; less frequently than annually may put you far off 
course when you do review your position.
 
2. Calculate your initial net worth.
 
3. Calculate your net worth at the next calculation period.
 
4. Compare the changes in assets, liabilities, and overall net worth.
 
 Are you getting closer to your goals or farther away from them? Make it 
a point to understand the general direction of each category. Are your 
assets lower now because your investments are down with the market? 
Or are your investments down while the market is up? Are you spending 
more than you’re earning and depleting your assets to cover your living 
expenses?
 
5. Identify where you have control over improving your financial direc-
tion.
 
6. Plan actions to increase your net worth before the next review period.
Tracking your net worth periodically through the ups and downs in the econ-
omy can help you to keep from losing sight of the financial progress you’re 
making.
Assess Your Current Location
So where are you on the financial roadmap? Knowing where you are and how 
you’re progressing toward your goals of building assets or paying down debt 
helps you focus on your financial resources and obligations. Consider each of 
the following three levels and find out which one best describes your finan-
cial situation.

42
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
Level 1: Shaky
Are you always feeling off-balance in your financial life? You’re at the Shaky 
level if one or more of these statements apply to you:
 
 Your employment or retirement income sources don’t provide regular 
and sustainable income.
 
 You’re unable to save any part of your income.
 
 You need to use credit to provide for regular living expenses (food, rent 
or house payment, and so on).
 
 You have significant debt payments.
 
 Your net worth is decreasing year to year.
If you’re Shaky, it’s difficult to weather any financial environment, let alone 
an uncertain one. Shaky individuals need to either increase their income or 
decrease their expenses, fast. Sometimes, you may need to take an extreme 
action to increase your financial stability, such as selling your home to pro-
duce a more manageable housing expense; selling a nice but too-expensive 
car; getting a second job; or going back to work if you’ve taken time off. Pay 
particular attention to Strategy #4 and Strategy #11.
Level 2: Stable
Stable individuals feel comfortable about today but may not be prepared for 
any changes in the future. If you’re a Stable individual, many of these state-
ments describe you:
 
 You have regular and sustainable income.
 
 You’re able to break even or even save a little every month.
 
 You have auto and homeowner’s (or renter’s) insurance but no other 
significant insurance.
 
 You don’t have significant amounts of consumer debt.
 
 You don’t know how much money you need for retirement.
 
 Your net worth is level or slowly increasing.
If you’re a Stable individual, you may be setting yourself up for some tough 
times if things get turbulent. Because you’re not struggling to get from pay-
check to paycheck, you feel okay about your current location on the financial 
map, but a single devastating event can send you off course. It’s time to move 
to the next level, where your net worth is increasing noticeably every year (or 
if you’re retired, continuing to increase or at least stay at a level that’ll meet 
your needs). For now, make sure you read the strategies in Part I of this book.

43
 #9: Take Stock of Your Current Financial Picture
Level 3: Secure
If you’re a Secure individual, you not only live within your means today but 
also plan for the future. The following statements describe you:
 
 You have a cash account with at least three months of expenses to use 
in case of financial emergency.
 
 You know your most significant financial risks and have plans to deal 
with the unexpected.
 
 You save for major purchases, such as automobiles and college educa-
tion, to reduce or eliminate borrowing for them.
 
 You have a growing retirement portfolio (or if retired, you have a plan 
to invest and spend down your portfolio). You know how much money 
you’ll need for a comfortable retirement.
 
 Your net worth is increasing regularly toward your ultimate goals.
Secure individuals have the best ability to weather the ups and downs of 
an uncertain economy. But even Secure individuals have some areas where 
they could improve their planning for volatile times. If you’re in the Secure 
category, make sure you read through Parts II and III, and read the strategies 
from Parts IV through VI that most apply to you now.

Save
By Kim Jones, CFP
L
ikely lurking somewhere in your past (or present) is a grandmother who 
nagged you about saving money. Perhaps she didn’t nag. But at the very 
least she probably counseled, advised, suggested, instructed, and just plain 
told you to save.
For most children, the future is tomorrow morning. But for the savvy saver 
who listened to grandmother, the future is that rainy day when you need cash 
but your current income isn’t enough to cover the unexpected downpour.
You can be certain a rainy day will arrive; you just can’t be certain when.
Just Save It
You can find as many ways to save as you can to spend your money. And no 
matter how much your paycheck increases, you’ll probably have no trouble 
finding more things to buy with the extra money.
So what’s a hard-working gal or guy to do? Follow these two rules:
 
 Rule #1: Just do it
 
 Rule #2: Pay yourself first
You can’t spend what you don’t have. That’s why you set aside a portion of 
your paycheck each month and then spend what’s left. If you find this con-
cept painful, play a game with yourself. Tell yourself that you’ll just try it for 
a month or two.
Some folks call this strategy, “Set it and forget it.” First you set it, and then 
you forget it. And soon you’ll be on your way to feeling smug about that tidy 
sum in the bank.

45
 #10: Save
Decide Where to Put that 
Rainy-Day Nest Egg
Common advice from financial gurus is to sock away an emergency reserve 
of three to six months worth of living expenses in easily accessible savings. 
That way you won’t put yourself in a bind by having to ask Uncle Henry for a 
loan (yikes!) or by borrowing too much on credit cards when a budget crisis 
crops up. Even worse would be to liquidate a long-term investment account 
such as your 401(k) or an IRA (which will cost you not only income tax on the 
amount withdrawn, but also a 10-percent penalty!).
 
Your reserve account should be:
 
 Readily available on short notice
 
 Relatively safe
 
 Earning interest or dividends
You could put your dollars in a piggy bank. But a piggy bank doesn’t pay 
interest and, let’s face it, those piggy banks are so cute and easy to raid! 
Instead, put the money in a bank money market account or money market 
mutual fund. Have your credit union or bank directly debit your paycheck or 
checking account before you have a chance to spend the money. The bank 
will be delighted to do it, and you’ll get excited seeing your rainy-day fund 
grow each payday. You’ll also be able to heave a sigh of relief (rather than 
cringe) the next time an unexpected expense comes up.
Make Room for More Savings
Want to know the most important, most brilliant financial tip that exists in 
the world today? Spend less than you make.
If you automate those rainy-day savings (also a good strategy for long-term 
savings such as your IRA), you spend less than you make without having to 
think about it.
Suppose you determine that you want to amass a $7,500 nest egg (three 
months of expenses at $2,500 per month). At 3 percent interest, saving $200 
per month will allow you to reach your $7,500 goal in three years.

46
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
Perhaps you’re still insisting that there’s simply no room in your budget for 
savings. Well, sometimes you just have to eat those Brussels sprouts. Take a 
look at what you’re spending on things that aren’t absolutely essential, that 
don’t match your life goals, or that don’t give your life pleasure. Keep track 
of your spending for several weeks. Carry a little log book in your pocket and 
write down everything you spend. After several weeks, take out the log book 
and your regular monthly bills. Look at where your money has been going. 
(It’s helpful when doing this exercise to have a glass of wine or your favorite 
mug of tea by your side.)
What to ponder:
 
 Do you need a landline phone and a cellphone?
 
 Do you need to buy books or is the library a better choice?
 
 Do you shop in bulk and waste half of what you buy when buying 
smaller quantities of just what you need would be more cost-effective? 
(Buying less can be helpful to the waistline, too.)
 
 Can you host a potluck with friends instead of meeting them at a restau-
rant?
 
 Can you (heaven forbid) make your own coffee at home?
 
 Could you live in a modest home?
 
 Could you buy a gently-used car rather than the latest new model?
 
 Do you have subscriptions to magazines you never read or health club 
memberships you never use?
 
The idea here is not to feel deprived, but rather to make conscious spending 
decisions. Looking closely at where you’re spending your money can help you 
make decisions about where to cut so that you can free up those savings for 
the emergency fund without feeling bereft.
Hey, you may find that the joy of watching your savings grow far exceeds the 
momentary pleasure of an impulse purchase.
 
If you need a little boost, here’s one to try. The next time you pay some-
thing off, whether it’s a small credit card balance or a car payment, continue 
making the payment. Only now, make the payment to that rainy-day account. 
You likely won’t notice anything other than the size of the pay-yourself-first 
account increasing.
To further inspire yourself, post a bar graph of your goal on your refrigerator. 
Mark your progress on it so you can congratulate yourself every day.

Manage Your Debt
By Rick DeChaineau, CSA, CRPC, CFP
T
hink of your lifetime income and earnings as a pipeline that flows from 
when you start making money to the last day of your life. Along the way, 
various faucets in the pipeline open and divert money to pay for needs (such 
as living expenses, a home purchase, furniture, and transportation) and 
wants (like big-screen TVs, vacations, a fishing boat, and more). For items 
you buy using debt — mortgages, loans, credit card purchases — the faucet 
opens wider and runs longer because you’re paying not only for the item but 
also for interest. The result is that you have to either work longer to earn 
more money to repay the debt or scale back on your goals.
When uncertain economic times occur, the amount of debt you’ve accumu-
lated can magnify the threat to your financial well-being. After you sign on for 
a debt, you no longer control that faucet. If something unexpected occurs, 
you have less cash flow and fewer options. This strategy explains how to 
close those faucets and keep the pipeline from running dry.
Avoid Bad Debt
The best way to keep your income pipeline filled is by avoiding unneces-
sary debt. Not only does setting aside money for future expenses save you 
the cost of debt interest payments, but it can also earn money for you if you 
invest in an interest-bearing account. As you save, you help fill your pipeline 
instead of draining it!
Putting off purchases until you’ve saved enough also gives you an additional 
reserve beyond your emergency fund (see Strategy #10). For example, if 
you’re saving money for a new barbecue, you can instead use those funds to 
replace a clothes dryer that tumbled its last towel or any other unexpected 
expense that exceeds your emergency fund.
But like most people, you can’t afford to pay cash for everything. Buying your 
home most likely required a mortgage. Buying cars, furniture, and appliances 
may involve financing. When you can’t pay cash for high-cost items, you need 
to borrow at least some of the amount needed for your purchase.

48
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
 
Four criteria determine whether debt is good or bad. Before taking on debt, 
ask yourself the following questions. If the answer to all four questions is yes, 
you’re signing up for good debt:
 
 Is it a need? If dependable transportation is a requirement for your job, 
buying a car to replace one that’s on its last legs is clearly a need. But 
if you have a working TV and those ads for big-screen flat-panel models 
are making your mouth water, you’re looking at a want — which leads to 
bad debt.
 
 Note: Where you live is important for your quality of life, so although 
you can live in an apartment, you may choose to buy a home to provide 
a more desirable environment, which would qualify as a need on the 
scorecard.
 
 Do you need to buy it before you can save up for it? Consider the 
timing. You’re looking at good debt if your car is beyond repair and you 
need dependable transportation as soon as possible. If the big-screen 
TV is on sale this weekend, you can wait. (Do you think they’ll get more 
expensive as time goes on?)
 
 Can you afford the payment? If the payment fits in your budget, you 
won’t have to cut back on other needs. That’s good debt. If you can’t 
afford it, you’ll have to cut back on some newly defined “extras” — like 
gas, food, and braces for the kids.
 
 Are the financing terms okay? Check the
 
• Rate
 
• Terms
 
• Prepayment penalties (which should be none)
 
 With good debt, you may have checked with your bank, credit union, 
and so on, so you know the interest rate is competitive and the length of 
the car loan isn’t longer than 48 months. You’re into bad debt if you use 
the in-store financing offered by the salesperson to buy the TV, getting 
saddled with an early-payment penalty.
 
Saving up for a future expenditure keeps you in control of your money. By 
signing up for debt, you give away that control. Avoiding bad debt keeps more 
money in your income pipeline going towards your needs, wants, and other 
goals.
Dump Debt Sooner
Few things both make you feel good and improve your financial situation as 
much as paying off debt! The sooner you can shut off those debt faucets, the 
longer your income pipeline will stay filled.

49
 #11: Manage Your Debt
Reduce your rates
Your first step in dealing with existing debt is seeking to reduce your interest 
rates. Here’s how:
 
 You may have gotten your home mortgage when rates were much higher — 
check on the rate you can get by refinancing.
 
 Call your credit card companies and ask for a lower rate. Tell them 
about lower-rate offers you’ve gotten in the mail. Do this at least once a 
year.
 
 Check with your bank or credit union to see whether you can refinance 
your car loan at a lower rate. Consider the cost of refinancing and 
whether it’s worth the lower payment you may get.
When checking on lower-rate refinancing, ask the same questions about 
terms and prepayment penalties that you would when looking for good debt.
Accelerate your payments
As soon as you’re paying the lowest rates available, you want to start accel-
erating debt payments to get out of debt sooner. Whether it’s old bad debt 
you got before reading this book or good debt, the less interest you pay, the 
better. The order in which you eliminate your debts depends on the type of 
account and how its interest is calculated.
 
Here’s the usual priority order for paying off debt:
 
1. Credit cards and other revolving consumer accounts
 
2. Auto, furniture, and appliance loans
 
3. Boat and RV loans
 
4. Home equity loans
 
5. Home equity lines of credit (HELOC)
 
6. Student loans
 
7. Home mortgages
You can most efficiently pay off your debts by applying any extra amount to 
just one account at a time (usually the one with the highest interest rate and 
smallest balance). As soon as that first account is paid off, accelerate pay-
ments on account number 2 by applying the full amount you’d been paying 
on account number 1 (basic payment plus the extra amount). As each debt is 
paid off, keep rolling the full amount being paid to the next debt account.

You can find a free debt-reduction calculator that helps you see how much 
interest you’ll save and helps you pick which debt to pay off first at www.
whatsthecost.com — it lets you do calculations in U.S. dollars, euros, or 
British pounds.
 
As soon as a credit card account is paid off, don’t close it — just cut up the 
card. Closing an account you’ve paid off hurts your credit score by reducing 
the total amount of credit you have available.

Improve Your Credit Score
By Derek Lenington, CFP
A
lthough your credit score is a factor in determining your mortgage rate, 
your credit score also influences rates you get on credit cards and car 
loans. It can also have an impact on your homeowner’s and car insurance 
rates, and it may even be considered when you apply for a job! Here are some 
tips on improving your score.
Get a Free Credit Report
Your credit score is only as good as your credit report, and getting a copy 
is both easy and free. The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires 
each of the three major credit reporting companies, Equifax, Experian, and 
TransUnion, to provide you an annual report at no cost. You can request it in 
one of three ways:
 
 Online at www.annualcreditreport.com
 
 By telephone at 877-322-8228
 
 By mail at Annual Credit Report Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 
30348-5281
Reports are limited to once from each company every 12 months. Otherwise, 
you pay a fee of $10 per report.
In addition to your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth, 
be prepared to provide previous addresses if you’ve moved in the last two 
years as well as at least one piece of personal information only you would 
know, such as a regular monthly payment amount on a mortgage or auto 
loan.
 
AnnualCreditReport.com is set up by the three major credit reporting compa-
nies, and it’s the only authorized Web site that exists. Other sites may offer 
a similar service but do so in an attempt to sell you unnecessary services or 
collect personal information. The official site will never solicit you or sell your 
name or information.

52
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
Understand Your Credit History
After you have your report, focus on the five main components that comprise 
your credit history:
 
 Personal information: This includes your name (as well as former 
names), current and past addresses, Social Security information, and 
employment history, often with salary information. This information is 
collected from previous credit applications and is often incomplete or 
inaccurate.
 
 Whether you’re single, married, divorced, or separated, your credit his-
tory should include information only about you. Spousal information 
should be included only when you’re both legally obligated to pay on a 
listed debt or if you’re both permitted to use a particular account.
 
 Your personal information doesn’t contain information about your 
religious preference, age, net worth, race, political affiliation, medical 
history, criminal record, or any other personal information not directly 
related to credit.
 
 Monthly account information: This section includes information from 
financial institutions including major credit card issuers, major depart-
ment stores, and other creditors you pay on a monthly basis. The infor-
mation includes credit limit, current balance, maximum amount ever 
borrowed, payment history (whether you pay on time or take 30, 60, 90, 
or more days to make a payment), date opened, and any write-offs or 
collection actions ever taken.
 
 Account information reported only when delinquent or in default: 
Creditors such as utilities, insurance companies, doctors and lawyers 
and other professionals, smaller retailers, and some property manage-
ment companies report only when an account is past due or collection 
proceedings have begun. For this info to be included in your report, the 
creditor must report this information within 90 days of taking collection 
action. This date is then used to start the seven-year clock, during which 
this very negative information can remain on your report.
 
 Public records: All three credit reporting companies pay data collection 
companies to pull information from governmental agencies. This is infor-
mation anyone can obtain through public records such as court filings 
(lawsuits, divorces, judgments, and liens), foreclosures, and bankrupt-
cies. More recently, it also includes child support enforcement delin-
quencies.
 
 Inquiries: Inquiries may be soft or hard. Soft inquiries aren’t reported or 
of concern to potential creditors. This category includes
 
• Requests you make of your own report

53
 #12: Improve Your Credit Score
 
• Inquiries that are part of unsolicited, preapproved credit card 
offers
 
• Periodic reviews of your credit history conducted by current 
creditors
 
 The second type, hard inquiries, includes inquiries made when you apply 
for credit of any sort. These inquiries can negatively impact your credit 
history. Too many hard inquiries makes it look as if you’re applying for 
credit wherever and whenever you can, so obtaining credit becomes 
more difficult.
 
 Minimize hard inquiries by not signing any form that allows a creditor 
to look at your credit if you’re just casually shopping for a car or to refi-
nance your mortgage.
Keep the Good, Fix the Bad
After you read and understand what’s on your credit report, your next steps 
are to build on the existing good information and to minimize or eliminate the 
negative.
Fix all errors and omissions
You have the right to dispute the accuracy or completeness of any item 
in your report. The credit reporting companies are required to update the 
status, or delete unverifiable information, within 30 days of receiving your 
request. Use the Request for Reinvestigation form that’s provided with your 
credit report. If not provided, you may obtain one from the agency’s Web 
site. Using these forms speeds up the process. Enclose copies of documents 
that support your claim.
 
When sending supporting evidence with your Request for Reinvestigation 
form, never send the original documents, and always track your submissions 
by using certified mail with return receipt requested or a similar service.
If you don’t receive a satisfactory or timely response, contact the creditor 
directly and demand that your claim be investigated, copying the credit 
reporting agency. Here’s the contact information for the three main credit 
reporting agencies:

54
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
Equifax
Phone 800-685-1111
Web site www.equifax.com
Experian
Phone 888-397-3742
Web site www.experian.com
TransUnion
Phone 877-322-8228
Web site www.transunion.com
You may also want to contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if you’re 
still not satisfied, so make sure to keep copies of all correspondence to and 
from the credit reporting companies and creditors. You may file a complaint 
against a credit agency directly with the FTC online at www.ftc.gov/ftc/
bcppriv.htm — or call the FTC at 877-382-4357.
 
Avoid credit repair clinics. At best, they don’t do anything you can’t do your-
self. At worst, these firms charge outrageous fees and suggest potentially ille-
gal practices.
 
You’re allowed a brief statement (100 words or less) explaining any disputed 
information in your report, but your statement can’t just explain factually 
correct but negative information; you can use this statement only to dispute 
errors. However, statements to the credit reporting companies are rarely 
effective. It’s usually best to explain negative information directly to a poten-
tial creditor.
Add good information to your report
Yes, you can request that each of the three agencies add information to your 
file. Although they’re not required to do so, they often do if the info can be 
verified. Focus on missing positive account histories, even if the account is 
closed. Also add information that explains or corrects potentially negative 
information.
 
Creditors care most about demonstrated payment responsibility. Account 
diversity also matters, as does the extent of historical credit, so an old credit 
card payment history is well worth the effort to add to your report.
Add missing information
 
Often, you find an account’s positive credit history missing on only one or 
two of the three credit reporting companies. Send a copy of the correct report 
from the agency with the complete information to the agencies missing it. 
Include a brief cover letter explaining your request. Copies of monthly state-
ments from the missing creditor make it more likely the information will be 
added.

55
 #12: Improve Your Credit Score
Missing or incomplete information on current and prior employers or resi-
dences can make it difficult for potential creditors to verify information or 
obtain a sufficient profile to make a favorable determination. This is particu-
larly important if the job or address change has happened in the last two to 
three years.
Don’t assume the information you’ve corrected or added will be permanently 
changed on your report. Sometimes your corrections inadvertently disap-
pear. Review your report at least annually and more frequently if you know 
you’ll be applying for a large amount of credit sooner than that.
Keep a good mix of accounts
Don’t close all your old accounts. A variety of accounts over a long period 
of time and with proven patterns of borrowing and full repayment creates a 
favorable credit profile. Closing unused credit accounts decreases your utili-
zation: your ratio of total debt outstanding to available debt. Potential credi-
tors like to see low utilization.
Opening a bunch of new accounts solely to improve this ratio, however, is 
also a bad idea. The mix of newer and older accounts helps determine your 
overall creditworthiness. A number of new accounts opened over a short 
period of time negatively impacts your file.

Set and Prioritize Financial Goals
By Abigail Pons, MBA, CFP
I
f you don’t take time to set financial goals, you tend to deal with issues 
haphazardly, addressing whatever happens to bubble up at the time. For 
example, without a plan, a leaky roof can easily cause vacation prospects to 
slip away; however, proper goal-setting can allow you to visit Niagara Falls 
without ending up with your own personal waterfall in the living room.
Consider the following reasons to invest some time in setting financial goals:
 
 You achieve financial peace of mind.
 
 You gain the power of living within your means.
 
 Time is your friend, allowing you to put away less money over longer 
periods of time.
 
 Your goals are free to change over time.
This section helps you put your goals in place and start working toward 
them.
Get Started
Although setting personal financial goals doesn’t require an advanced 
degree, it does take some consideration (and maybe a cup of coffee). Most 
people have limited resources and have to be honest about what’s most 
important in life. Become your own Personal Finance Project Manager, and 
start by getting it all down on paper:
 
1. Make a list of all your goals.
 
 Write it all down — new refrigerator, new roof, new car, vacations and 
travel, retirement, college funding, and so on. Don’t forget the goals that 
you take for granted. For instance, if you have a five-year loan for your 
car, you committed to the goal of owning the car at the end of five years 
by taking out that loan. Take the time you need to make sure your list is 
complete.

57
 #13: Set and Prioritize Financial Goals
 
2. Attach a price tag to each goal.
 
 You need to know how much each goal costs in light of your budget and 
other goals. Do this before prioritizing, because sometimes the cost of a 
goal becomes a deciding factor in setting those priorities.
 
 Short-term goals are easier to address because the costs are much more 
predictable. For example, if you’re hoping to buy a new car outright in 
two years, you can be pretty sure that the current cost of the vehicle, 
plus a reasonable adjustment for two years of inflation, will be a realistic 
estimate.
 
 For longer-term goals, such as retirement and college savings, setting a 
price tag can be tricky. Check out the college cost calculator at saving-
forcollege.com and see Strategy #54 and Strategy #55 for good infor-
mation about accumulating adequate funds for retirement.
 
3. Prioritize your goals.
 
 When you have a good feel for the cost of your goals, list them in order 
of importance to you. Prioritizing brings a great deal of perspective to 
the process. You may find that some goals become unimportant enough 
that you remove them altogether. Or you may make some important life-
style decisions, such as buying a used car instead of a new one, in order 
to achieve a goal more meaningful to you. Don’t be discouraged by cost 
(for example, the cost of retirement) — just realize that it’s important to 
get planning now so you can consistently chip away at it over time.
 
4. Assign a tentative timetable to your goals and visualize how much 
they’ll cost at various points in your life.
 
 Consider the scale of a big, long-term goal, such as retirement, against 
smaller goals, such as vehicle purchases and travel. And don’t forget the 
effect of inflation over time. 
Compare Short-Term and 
Long-Term Goals
There are some big differences in how you handle and invest for short-term 
and long-term goals. This section lays them out for you.
Short-term goals
Generally, you want to achieve short-term goals in the next five years. They 
may include the following:

 Taking a vacation
Keep your savings for short-term goals in liquid investments. Liquid invest-
ments can quickly and easily be converted to cash; examples include
 
 Savings accounts
 
 Money market accounts or mutual funds
 
 Short-term CDs with staggered maturities
You don’t want to invest in anything that may significantly drop in value, 
such as an individual stock, leaving you with less cash at the very time you 
need it.
 
Leave some money in your emergency cash reserves. The money you’re 
directing toward short-term goals should be in addition to your rainy-day 
fund, an in-case-of-emergency account that can support you for three to six 
months. Like savings for short-term goals, your emergency cash reserves 
should be invested in highly liquid, easily accessible investments. (See 
Strategy #9 to make sure you’re covered.)
Long-term goals
Long-term goals are usually more than five years away. Most people have just 
a few long-term goals, such as retirement, college education funding, or start-
ing their own business in ten years.
Several factors make long-term goal planning tricky:
 
 Inflation: It’ll certainly occur, but you can’t possibly know at what rate.
 
 Investment returns: You can’t be certain how much your investments 
will make over long periods of time.
 
 Taxes: They can go up or down.
 
 Changing costs of your goal: Many factors can affect the cost of your 
long-term goals, making the price tag a moving target. Will you have 
Social Security or a pension payment during retirement? What will medi-
cal expenses look like?

 #13: Set and Prioritize Financial Goals
There’s simply no way to know these things, so you have to make reasonable 
assumptions about them with current information. Generally, with long-term 
goals, it’s best to err on the conservative side — assume that inflation and 
taxes will be higher, that investment returns will be lower than those in the 
last few decades, and that you’ll face larger medical costs in retirement.
 
The good news? Because your long-term goals are far into the future, you can 
take more risk in pursuit of higher return with your investments for long-term 
goals. And here’s even better news: Uncertain economic environments can 
present long-term investment opportunities. The important thing is to stay the 
course with your investment plan.
Put Your Plans in Motion
After you set your goals and know what you want to do with your money, 
actually putting that money to work toward your goals is the essential next 
step. Here are some tips:
 
 Pay yourself first. You’ve no doubt heard it before, but it’s good, reli-
able wisdom: You have to pay yourself first, or your money will find 
someplace else to go, without fail. If you want to achieve a financial goal, 
you have to make a payment toward that goal.
 
 Keep the money separate from spendable funds. One of the added ben-
efits of retirement accounts is that they’re set aside from your everyday 
household funds. Accessing your retirement accounts is a hassle, and 
if you do it too early, you may pay a penalty. For other goals, keeping 
money mentally separate from your disposable funds may be harder. 
Consider keeping funds for other goals in a separate earmarked account 
to make it less tempting to raid.
 
 Automate. One of the great things about the modern, high-tech financial 
world is the ability to automate money transfers. Not only is it easier 
to pay your mortgage and credit card payments on time, but you can 
also set up automatic monthly transfers to your savings or investment 
accounts. This is important because it removes the decision-making pro-
cess from the picture and enables you to pay the most important person 
first — yourself!
 
After you define your goals and have a plan to achieve them, continue to 
revisit and reevaluate them on a regular basis. Give special attention to those 
moving-target long-term goals. If your current spending on short-term goals is 
maxing out your budget, you may be sabotaging progress toward your long-
term goals. Make sure you review your priorities regularly.

Don’t Let Your Money Beliefs 
Sabotage Your Goals
By Diane Blackwelder, CFP
S
elf-knowledge is power. To avoid sabotaging your financial goals, partic-
ularly in rough times, self-awareness and flexibility are essential. You’re 
not likely to change your money personality, but by acknowledging your 
strengths and weaknesses, you can change your tactics and achieve financial 
success.
Know Your Money Personality (And the 
Weaknesses That Come with It)
Some finance professionals may say, “Who needs a financial plan? All you 
need to do is spend less than you make and invest the rest.” Sounds simple, 
right? So why is it so difficult to execute? Most of us know how to get ahead 
financially, but we’re handicapped by our own counterproductive ideas.
Everyone has a belief system surrounding money. Some people mirror the 
beliefs of their parents, while others adopt completely opposite attitudes. 
Identifying your money personality is the first step in understanding how 
your beliefs may be affecting your bottom line.
Here are three basic money personality types:
 
 Spenders
 
 Savers
 
 Procrastinators
Don’t worry — no money personality is better than the others. Most people 
have a little of each. But when facing uncertain times, idiosyncrasies can 
raise their ugly heads.

61
 #14: Don’t Let Your Money Beliefs Sabotage Your Goals
Spenders
You’ve likely heard the saying, “Keeping up with the Joneses.” Well, spenders 
are the Joneses. They live in the right house, live in the right neighborhood, 
drive a shiny new car, and are most likely buried under a mountain of debt.
Spenders live by the mantra, “I deserve it.” They live in the moment and 
consider money a measure of success. Ironically, spenders feel frustrated 
because they have no money in the bank. And during uncertain times, spend-
ers may feel a crunch from their overexuberance.
Do you often reward yourself by buying new shoes or a new toy? Is there 
more month left than paycheck? Do you vow each year to start a savings 
plan?
 
Everyone splurges once in a while. But when spending undermines your finan-
cial security, today or in the future, it’s time to get a grip. Consider the follow-
ing tactics:
 
 Freeze your credit cards — literally. Take your credit cards and freeze 
them in a cup of water. It may sound silly, but waiting for your credit 
card to thaw will take the spontaneity out of splurging. If you prefer a 
less extreme measure, adopt a cooling-off policy; don’t allow yourself to 
purchase a single item over a preset limit, say $50, without waiting 24 
hours.
 
 Think about tomorrow. Preparing a financial to-do list will help priori-
tize spending. Suppose your goal is to have $5,000 in the bank by year-
end. Set up automatic drafts from your checking to savings, and invest 
in yourself. Before you make an expensive purchase, ask yourself, “Will 
this purchase mean something to me in a year?”
Savers
The term penny pincher comes to mind when describing a saver. Savers clip 
coupons, live on strict budgets, feel guilty when making major purchases, 
and find great joy in watching their bank accounts grow.
Savers, unlike spenders, have a hard time living in the moment. A saver often 
refrains from taking a vacation or replacing his 10-year-old car. The saver’s 
motto is, “Safety is king.” A saver would rather bury his money in the back-
yard than risk losing a penny. Negative economic news is particularly worri-
some to the saver.
Would friends and family describe you as cheap? Do you feel you’ll never 
have enough money? Has it been years since you bought a new suit or gown 
(after all, ’80’s fashions are coming back!)?

62
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
 
As far as financial security goes, there are worse things than being a saver. 
However, in all things there must be moderation. If you’re a saver, try to 
remember the following:
 
 Risk is not a four letter word. Take more risk with your money in 
exchange for greater rewards. Investing your money in a diversified 
portfolio will make your money work as hard as you do. Investing is a 
long-term proposition. Don’t let hiccups in the market distract you from 
your goals.
 
 Relax. Review your financial goals. After you establish your needs and 
find ways to make your money work harder for you, give yourself per-
mission to enjoy the rest. Instead of researching bargain prices on toilet 
paper, spend your time planning a much-deserved vacation.
Procrastinators
Spenders and savers are on the extreme ends of the money personality 
spectrum. Procrastinators, on the other hand, live with their heads in the 
sand. Walk into a procrastinator’s house and you’re likely to find stacks of 
unopened mail. Procrastinators are overwhelmed by financial matters and 
will do almost anything to avoid them.
Procrastinators spend a fair amount of time worrying about money, but they 
seem unable to act. They put off paying bills, enrolling in their company’s 
retirement plan, setting goals, and even filing their taxes. During uncertain 
times a procrastinator will justify putting off any financial decision.
Do you file an extension for your taxes every year? Do you wait until a collec-
tion agency calls before you pay your doctor’s bill? Would you rather have a 
root canal than balance your checkbook?
 
Many people put off today what they can do tomorrow. When it comes to 
money, procrastinating can harm not only your credit, but also your financial 
security. If you find yourself trending this way, take the following actions:
 
 Install safety nets. Automate as much of your financial affairs as pos-
sible. Setting up automatic bill payment and regular transfers to your 
investment accounts will ensure that you get it done.
 
 Feather your nest. Make an effort to learn more about financial plan-
ning. Enroll in a personal finance class at a local community college 
or read personal finance books. By investing in yourself and building 
knowledge, you’ll be better prepared to weather financial storms.

63
 #14: Don’t Let Your Money Beliefs Sabotage Your Goals
Work to Improve Yourself
After you know what kind of money personality you have, and you under-
stand where that type of personality may fall short, you can begin to make 
improvements. In addition to addressing the specific personality-related 
shortcomings mentioned previously, try the following:
 
 Find an accountability partner. Share the responsibilities of manag-
ing your money with your spouse, significant other, or a professional. 
Having an accountability partner will keep your weaknesses in check 
and build on your strengths.
 
 Think small. Don’t expect an overnight reversal of your belief system. 
Start with small steps, like taking a class or preparing a to-do list. Minor 
changes often bring big results.

Avoid Common Mistakes 
in a Down Market
By Warren McIntyre, CFP, and Richard Weimert, MBA, CFP
U
nfortunately, investment markets don’t always go up. As a matter of 
fact, the U.S. stock market has declined about one-third of the time 
since 1926. Seeing the value of your investments go down can often be emo-
tional, but the markets have produced consistent increases in value over 
very long periods and through all kinds of challenges. Here are some things 
to focus on when the inevitable down periods occur.
Keep Cool
Don’t let a market slump make you do something you’ll regret later or derail 
your investment program. When the going gets tough, the urge to bail out 
of stocks can be strong. But panicking can wreck an investment plan faster 
than anything. Being out of the market won’t allow you to keep up with rising 
costs of living. In addition, repurchasing later may result in a cycle of buying 
high and selling low. If you haven’t developed a long-term investment plan, 
do it now. If you have, review it to make sure it still reflects your financial 
goals (see Strategy #13).
Here are some things to consider when markets are rocky:
 
 Communicate with your financial advisor, if you have one. Financial 
advisors earn their keep in turbulent times, and a good one will be able 
to walk you through the holdings in your portfolio and reaffirm your 
investment strategy.
 
 Do nothing. Sometimes doing nothing is preferable to action. Try leav-
ing your account statements unopened for a while. When you look at 
them every three months or so, you may find the account values are 
higher than you thought, especially if you’re adding to them on a regular 
basis.

65
 #15: Avoid Common Mistakes in a Down Market
 
 Don’t watch, listen to, or read too much commentary. During a down-
turn, the news media has plenty of disheartening stories. The talking 
heads and bloggers are there for infotainment, not to make you money.
 
 Act less like a day trader and more like legendary investors Warren 
Buffet and John Bogle. They see market madness as normal and transitory 
and take advantage of opportunities in the hard times. Check your stomach 
for risk. If a big dip invokes too much anxiety, consider putting a larger pro-
portion of your portfolio in less risky assets, like bonds and even cash. But 
be sure that doing so doesn’t jeopardize your long-term goals.
Stick to the Basics
Market turmoil causes investors to question their own judgment and seek 
different approaches, but the only thing investors really need to do is follow 
some fundamental principles. Consider the following:
 
 Invest in securities and use strategies you can easily understand and 
that have withstood the test of time. The subprime mortgage crisis and 
the collapse of Enron are examples of strategies that failed because some 
very smart people couldn’t control their complex schemes. Be sure you 
understand your investments, including risks, fees, and other costs.
 
 Make sure you’re well-diversified globally. The U.S. isn’t the only 
market in the world, and every day we become more dependent on a 
global economy. See Strategies #39 through #46 for strategies and asset 
allocations that will make your portfolio less risky.
 
 Use mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Unless you have at least 
$500,000 to invest and the time and expertise to monitor individual 
securities closely, you’ll be better off with well-chosen mutual funds or 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). (See Strategies #20 and #22 for the ins 
and outs of these investment vehicles.) The value of an individual stock 
or bond can go to zero, but a mutual fund is usually so diversified that 
losses are temporary. To reduce risk, limit any single stock or bond to 
no more than 10 percent of the portfolio. Be conscious of too much over-
lap in individual securities or in styles of funds in your portfolio. Your 
advisor or online tools can help you analyze the portfolio.
 
 The 10-percent rule especially applies to employer stock. High concen-
tration in employer stock is one of the most common mistakes made by 
401(k) participants. Be aware of how much company stock you hold in 
all your various portfolios. With your employment and potential retire-
ment benefits already aligned with the fortunes of your company, limit-
ing personal exposure in your company’s stock is best.

66
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
 
 Keep costs in mind. High costs are magnified when returns are low. Self-
directed investors can minimize costs by using index funds and ETFs. If 
you need or want an advisor, don’t be afraid to ask how the advisor is 
compensated and about the expenses of the products used.
 
Uncertain economies and markets make adjusting your portfolio even more 
important. Many proprietary products handcuff investors by imposing heavy 
surrender charges or exit fees. Annuities are the most common offenders, but 
other illiquid investments, such as limited partnerships, can keep you from 
making the necessary changes.
Be Savvy
Beyond the basics, a smart investor can employ a variety of strategies to 
cope with adverse market conditions. Give some of these strategies a try:
 
 Pay down debt. The return on investment by paying off a loan is equal 
to the interest rate charged — but unlike other investments, the return 
is guaranteed. Even paying down a mortgage (often considered good 
debt) may be the best investment you can make in a down market.
 
 Invest for total return (the combination of growth and income), not 
just income. Down markets often coincide with sluggish economic con-
ditions. Income investors feel the squeeze when rates on CDs and other 
income investments drift lower and lower. Invest for the highest total 
return consistent with your risk tolerance and then take distributions as 
needed.
 
 Continue to invest the same amount of money on a consistent basis, 
be it weekly, monthly, or quarterly. By sticking with the program in 
good times and bad, and increasing the amounts of your contributions 
when you can, you can build wealth regardless of market conditions.
 
 Automate your savings program. Participants in 401(k) plans enjoy 
both automatic investing and dollar-cost averaging, but most financial 
institutions will arrange similar systematic investing in other types of 
accounts.
 
 Use target maturity and life-cycle funds. These funds-of-funds provide a 
complete portfolio rebalanced automatically, ensuring broad diversifica-
tion and effortless investing.

67
 #15: Avoid Common Mistakes in a Down Market
Take Advantage of the Turmoil
You can’t control what happens in the markets, but you can turn market 
turbulence into opportunities. Consider actions like these during market 
declines:
 
 Buy more. A decline in prices means investments are on sale. If you’re 
saving and adding to your accounts, you should be delighted with a 
down market. You want the value of your holdings to be higher when 
you retire or when you need them — it doesn’t matter so much what 
they’re worth now.
 
 Rebalance your portfolio at least annually. Market declines can cause 
your allocations to stray far from your target. To get your portfolio back 
in line, you buy what’s gone down and sell what’s gone up. Buy low, sell 
high.
 
 Harvest your tax losses. Tax-loss harvesting (selling assets in which you 
have a taxable loss and replacing them with other nearly identical secu-
rities) is a great and legal way to take advantage of the tax code. Just be 
careful to avoid wash sales — basically, the IRS will disallow your loss if 
you buy back the same security within 30 days of selling it. This includes 
mutual funds. You can, however, buy similar mutual funds; for example, 
if you sell a large cap value fund, you can buy another large value fund 
immediately, as long as it isn’t the same fund you just sold.
 
 Convert traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs. When you convert from a tra-
ditional IRA to a Roth IRA you must pay the income taxes now. But you 
won’t owe taxes later. If converting to a Roth is beneficial for you, it 
makes sense to do it when the account balance is lower because your 
immediate tax bill will be lower.
 
Don’t fixate on income taxes. Fear of paying taxes has prevented more people 
from taking necessary actions than just about any other reason. If your analy-
sis suggests that selling is required, don’t let the tax consequences stand in 
the way. Besides, with special rates for long-term capital gains, the tax bill may 
be lower than you think.

Use Non-Investment Options 
to Improve Your Finances
By Will Humphrey
E
very day the media bombards you with information about the stock 
market, leading economic indicators, and other financial news. Although 
all this info may be important to somebody somewhere, you want to make 
the most of the money you have that’s not invested in the market. Your 
checkbook, not the Dow or NASDAQ, is the bottom line you deal with every 
day. By focusing on your checkbook, you can improve your bottom line. 
Moreover, gaining control of your personal finances can ensure that you have 
money to invest in the first place.
 
Devoting time and effort to organizing and prioritizing your spending gives 
you better control of your money, helps you reach your goals, and provides 
peace of mind during uncertain times: You know where your money is going 
and you stay in control.
Keep Track of Your Money
If you’re like most people, you don’t know where all your money goes. You 
have a lot of ways to buy things these days, from debit cards and credit cards 
to paper checks and cash. With online access to your bank account, you may 
not even balance your checkbook!
Having all these ways to spend makes it hard to keep track of your spending 
each month. But if you’re going to take charge of your finances, you need to 
know. Money that disappears is lost forever and can’t be saved or invested or 
used to help make the car payment.
You have plenty of options for tracking your money, ranging from low-tech to 
high-tech. Whatever option you choose, you need to track your spending for 
a full month. Don’t try to recreate all your spending from a previous month 
because you won’t recall everything you spent.

69
 #16: Use Non-Investment Options to Improve Your Finances
Write it all down
One option to keep track of your spending is to use good old 3-x-5-inch index 
cards to record spending:
 
 List all your monthly automatic drafts from your bank account on card 1 
(mortgage payment, car payment, and so on)
 
 List all your regular monthly checks on card 2 (utilities, cable, phone, 
and so on)
 
 List all your other spending on card 3, including purchases at the gro-
cery store, restaurant meals, gasoline, a jolt of caffeine from the coffee 
shop, all those items from big box stores and warehouse clubs, and so 
on. Purchases made without even thinking about them are the ones that 
really add up.
 
Both you and your spouse or partner must track purchases if you’re going to 
get a real handle on your spending.
Many online tools can also help you track your spending. You can find exam-
ples of these tools at www.mint.com and www.mvelopes.com. Quicken and 
Microsoft Money have software that you can use for this same purpose.
Categorize and discuss your results
At the end of the month, take your index cards (or spreadsheets) and sort 
your purchases into categories. You can choose to have a few or many cat-
egories, but the more specific you are, the better you’ll be able to tell where 
your money is going. You’ll likely be surprised at the totals you see for some 
categories.
 
You can make sorting your expenses pay off more easily by dividing items into 
wants and needs. Keeping your priorities in mind can help you resist the siren 
song of around-the-clock advertising.
Now that you can see where the money is going, you and your spouse or 
partner can decide whether your spending is in line with your priorities. This 
may well require a heart-to-heart conversation about what’s truly impor-
tant. You both have to recognize that your spending (and saving) should be 
brought in line with your goals. This conversation may not be easy, but focus 
on the long-term benefit of the exercise, keeping in mind the positive impact 
it’ll have on your financial well-being.

70
Part I: Laying a Solid Foundation 
Use Automatic Payments to Take 
Control of Your Money
You can employ some of the same services that make it easier to spend (elec-
tronic payments, online bill-pay, and so on) to ensure your spending and 
savings stay in line with your priorities. The following steps take advantage 
of automated payments to get you started. Because most people budget by 
bank balance rather than on an item-by-item budget, you and your spouse or 
partner will have to adjust your spending to avoid emptying your everyday 
account:
 
1. Choose a primary bank or credit union account where your paycheck 
will be deposited.
 
2. Establish at least one savings account to save for your emergency fund 
and important goals.
 
3. Open another checking account for everyday spending.
 
 Using cash, debit cards, or checks, here’s where all the spending that 
you have at least some control over — such as food, gas, coffee, dining 
out, and entertainment — will come from.
 
4. From your primary account, set up automatic payments.
 
 Automatic payments should go to the following:
 
• Needs, including rent or mortgage, utilities, and insurance
 
• Contributions to your savings account for your emergency fund 
and important goals
 
• Contributions to your everyday spending account; the amount 
transferred to this account each payday is the balance after first 
covering your needs and savings
Although you can fine-tune this system (for instance, by having an additional 
separate account to pay for gas), you can see the intent from this example.
Turn to Financial Professionals for 
Guidance and Accountability
You’re obviously someone who’s ready to take charge of your finances or are 
looking for reassurance that you’re making solid financial decisions in uncer-
tain economic times. Consider taking the next step, which is to engage finan-
cial professionals to provide additional guidance to ensure your financial 
well-being. If you haven’t already done so, give serious thought to developing 

71
 #16: Use Non-Investment Options to Improve Your Finances
a professional relationship with these professionals. The fees they charge will 
likely be money well-spent because their advice can save you money both in 
the short term (immediately in some instances) and in the long term. Here’s 
how you may benefit from their services:
 
 Certified Financial Planner: Studies have shown that individuals with a 
financial plan in place have more success in growing their net worth and 
meeting financial goals compared to those lacking a plan. Simply stated, 
if you don’t have goals that you’re aiming for with big-ticket items 
(retirement funding, primary residence purchase, buying a vacation 
home, college funding, inheritance planning, and the like), you’re leaving 
things to chance. You can think of a financial planner as a fiscal fitness 
coach.
 
 Certified public accountant: By engaging a CPA to complete tax plan-
ning and tax returns for you, you’ll likely reduce the money you shell out 
to the local, state, and federal governments at tax time.
 
 Estate planning attorney: A will is only one of several documents nec-
essary to protect you, your spouse or partner, and other loved ones in 
the event of your death or incapacity. A competent attorney can help 
you develop a plan and create the legal instruments needed should bad 
things happen.

Include Cash Reserves: Savings, 
CDs, and Money Market Accounts
By Paul Dolce, MBA, CFP
Y
ou may think of cash as the comfort food of investing. When things get 
dicey, you feel like pulling your money out of investments and moving it 
to where it’ll be safe. Maybe you simply can’t stand the thought of watching 
your investments decrease in value, a frequent problem in times of economic 
uncertainty. Having an investment strategy that holds up in good times and 
bad can help overcome those concerns. And cash is one component of every 
good investment strategy.
You can use cash for a variety of things, including the following:
 
 Your emergency fund: Use emergency funds to cover unexpected 
expenses.
 
 Short-term goals: These include goals that are less than five years away, 
such as saving for a car or a down payment on a house.
 
 Investment stability: Include cash investments in your investment strat-
egy as a core investment (primary holding) and to reduce volatility (a 
measure of how rapidly the value of your portfolio goes up and down).
 
 Temporary component: You can also use cash as a temporary compo-
nent of portfolios meant for long-term goals. You may hold cash in these 
portfolios for a variety of reasons, including the following:
 
• You’ve sold an investment and a suitable replacement isn’t imme-
diately available.
 
• You want available cash so you can take advantage of an antici-
pated investment opportunity.
 
• You need to take income from your account, so you have to keep 
a portion of it in cash for safety. You don’t want to have to sell an 
investment at an inopportune time so you can take income out of 
your portfolio.

76
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle 
Your Cash-Equivalent Savings Options
Savings accounts, CDs, and money market accounts are three vehicles that 
you can employ to ensure that your cash is working for you. Generically 
called cash equivalents, each of these investments has been designed with 
safety in mind — in other words, their value remains relatively stable.
Savings accounts
Savings accounts offered by banking and thrift institutions are safe, very safe. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures savings accounts 
at member institutions up to $100,000 per depositor. And certain retirement 
savings accounts, such as IRAs, are insured up $250,000.
Savings accounts are liquid, too. This means you can pull your money out 
whenever you need it without having to worry about early withdrawal fees, 
gains, losses, or other complications that often come with other investments.
 
Savings accounts also have a downside: They pay low interest rates. When 
interest rates in the general economy decline, interest rates paid on savings 
accounts can be downright pathetic and may not even keep up with inflation. 
If inflation is increasing the cost of the things you buy by 3 percent each year 
and your savings account is paying you only 1 percent in interest, the pur-
chasing power of the money in your savings account is actually declining by 
2 percent per year. It actually costs you money to keep your funds in a safe 
account.
 
Online savings accounts, such as ING Direct (www.ingdirect.com) and 
HSBC Direct (www.hsbcdirect.com), offer FDIC-insured savings that typi-
cally yield a bit more interest than regular bank savings accounts. Because 
these institutions don’t have physical branch buildings and staff and because 
all activity is conducted online, their expenses can be lower. To use them, 
simply open an account at their Web site and then fund the account by initiat-
ing an online electronic transfer from your regular savings institution to your 
new account. You can transfer money back whenever you want to in the same 
manner. You can also pay many of your bills electronically from these online 
savings accounts. This can even save you money in postage!
 
Keep money in savings accounts only for your ultra short-term needs, such as 
your emergency fund or that down payment you’re making next month. You 
have better options available for your longer-term investments.

77
 #17: Include Cash Reserves: Savings, CDs, and Money Market Accounts
Certificates of deposit
Certificates of deposits, or CDs, are offered by the same institutions that offer 
savings accounts. CDs are FDIC-insured, so they’re safe like savings accounts. 
However, they generally pay slightly higher interest rates than savings 
accounts.
CDs can offer both safety and higher rates because they aren’t as liquid as 
savings accounts. CDs have predetermined maturity terms, typically ranging 
anywhere from six months to two years or longer. When you buy a CD, you 
should plan to keep it until the end of its term. If you redeem your CD before 
it matures, you may have to pay an early withdrawal penalty or forfeit a por-
tion of the interest you earned.
 
A bank’s CD rates may be negotiable. Banks often offer special rates to attract 
funds from investors like you. Shop around on the Internet or by phone to find 
the best rates in your area. If they’re better than your bank’s rates, talk to an 
investment specialist at your bank and ask her to match the better rate — it 
can’t hurt to ask. Just like any other business, banks don’t like to lose cus-
tomers, and they’ll sometimes do what it takes to keep you from taking your 
money elsewhere.
Money market accounts
Although they aren’t FDIC-insured, money market accounts combine some of 
the best features of savings accounts and CDs.
Like savings accounts, money market accounts are liquid. You can write 
checks on them and take your cash out anytime you want; you don’t have a 
waiting period like you do with CDs. Restrictions, however, may include mini-
mum check size, how many checks you can write per month, or minimum 
account balances you have to maintain to get the best rates and/or avoid 
monthly fees.
Money market accounts offer better interest rates than savings accounts. 
Sometimes the rates aren’t quite as attractive as those for CDs, but you have 
access to your money anytime you want; you don’t get that with a CD.
You can open a money market account at most banks and institutions that 
offer savings accounts and CDs. Many mutual fund companies also offer 
money market accounts. Money market mutual funds frequently offer even 
better rates than bank money market accounts, so be sure to do some check-
ing before you invest.

Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle 
An added feature of money market mutual funds is that they invest your 
money in a variety of investments. For example, you can purchase municipal 
money market mutual funds (also called munis) in which your earnings will 
be exempt from federal and possibly even state taxes. Or you can choose a 
U.S. Treasury money market fund that invests only in rock-solid government 
securities. Be sure to read the fine print in the brochure or prospectus.
So Which One Is Right for You?
When you’re choosing the type of cash accounts to use, consider the following:
 
 Your investment strategy
 
 When you may need your money
 
 The current rate of inflation and whether the interest rate will keep up 
with inflation
 
 Your comfort with using Internet institutions versus your local bank
 
 Your familiarity with mutual fund companies
 
 How easily you can access your money
 
 What restrictions and limitations are associated with each type of cash 
account
 
When times are tough and markets are going down, keep your short-term cash 
needs in mind. If you know you’re going to need cold, hard cash sometime in 
the next couple of years, keep that amount in a nice, safe cash option. Keeping 
short-term money in long-term securities like stocks and bonds is flirting with 
disaster.

Government Bonds: Should You 
Loan Uncle Sam Your Money?
By Michael Oswalt, CPA
T
hroughout U.S. history, individuals have had the opportunity to “invest 
in America” through the purchase of U.S. government securities. U.S. 
Treasury securities are simply IOUs from good ol’ Uncle Sam. When you buy 
a Treasury security, you’re lending money to the federal government for a 
specified period of time. Uncle Sam borrows money in a number of ways; the 
most common are savings bonds, Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury 
bonds, and agency bonds.
 
The best way to purchase the securities outlined in this chapter is directly 
from the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Web site (www.treasurydirect.
gov). You have no fees and no commissions when you buy or sell direct. You 
can also purchase the marketable securities through your broker, but be pre-
pared to pay a minimal fee for the transaction.
During uncertain economic times, part of your portfolio should be striving for 
predictability, safety, and liquidity. For these objectives, government securi-
ties historically have reached the mark. Read on.
U.S. Savings Bonds: Tried-and-True
Savings bonds are nonmarketable securities, which means that when you pur-
chase the bonds, they’re registered to you and you can’t sell them to another 
investor through the financial markets. Uncle Sam offers two types of these 
bonds, Series EE and Series I, which are backed by the full faith and credit of 
the U.S. government and are considered the safest of all investments. Here’s 
more info on each type:
 
 Series EE bonds: These bonds earn a fixed rate of return set by the U.S. 
Treasury. They’re accrual bonds, which means the interest accumulates 
and is compounded semiannually (rather than being paid to the owner 
as it’s earned each month). If you hold one of these bonds, you receive 
the interest when you redeem the bonds.

80
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
 
 Series I bonds: The interest you earn from I bonds comes in two parts:
 
• A fixed-rate component established when you purchase the bond
 
• A second component that’s equal to the rate of inflation, adjusted 
semiannually (based on the consumer price index for March and 
September)
 
 Although the fixed-rate interest component for Series I bonds is low, 
these bonds help protect you against inflation. If inflation goes up, so 
does the interest rate you earn because the variable-rate portion is 
adjusted every six months; for example, when the fixed-rate component 
is 2 percent and the inflation adjustment is 5 percent, an investment in a 
Series I bond is guaranteed to return 7 percent. But remember, the total 
interest rate can also go down as the inflation adjustment decreases.
For both bonds, the purchase limit is $5,000 per Social Security number 
for each calendar year. You can easily purchase and redeem the bonds in 
electronic format through the Department of the Treasury’s Web site (www.
treasurydirect.gov). If you purchase the bonds electronically, you can 
get any denomination of $25 or more, including penny increments. The pur-
chase price is equal to the face value.
You can also purchase the bonds in paper form through various financial 
institutions and payroll savings plans. Paper I bonds are offered in denomi-
nations of $50, $75, $100, $200, $500, $1000, and $5,000; they’re purchased 
for their face value. However, you can get paper versions of EE bonds at half 
their face value; they’ll be worth face value at maturity. Paper EE bonds are 
offered in denominations of $50, $75, $100, $200, $500, $1000, $5,000, and 
$10,000.
The interest on both bonds compounds semiannually for 30 years, but you 
don’t have to hold the bonds for that long. You can redeem the bonds after 
12 months, but you pay a three-month interest penalty if you redeem the 
bonds within five years of the purchase date.
As for tax treatment, U.S. savings bonds are exempt from state and local 
income tax. Federal income tax on interest earned can be deferred until 
redemption or final maturity, whichever occurs first. Tax benefits are avail-
able when you use the bonds for education purposes.
Gimme a “T!” Treasury Securities
Most of Uncle Sam’s debt is made up of marketable (tradable) securities: 
Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and TIPS. Like savings 
bonds, each of these securities is backed by the full faith and credit of the 
government:

81
 #18: Government Bonds: Should You Loan Uncle Sam Your Money?
 
 Treasury bills (T-bills): T-bills are short-term, highly liquid securities 
that mature in one year or less. They’re similar to a savings account 
or a money market fund. You can buy them at less than face value and 
receive the full face amount when the bill matures.
 
 Treasury notes (T-notes): T-notes are intermediate-term investments 
with maturities of more than one year but less than ten years. You can 
probably expect to earn a somewhat higher interest rate on T-notes than 
on T-bills. The notes pay interest every six months. They’re the most 
popular Treasury securities because they offer a good mix of the safety 
of short-term investments and the higher yields of long-term bonds. 
Investors often use them to fund specific future expenses, such as col-
lege or retirement income.
 
 Treasury bonds (T-bonds): T-bonds are long-term investments with 
terms between 10 and 30 years; they pay interest every six months. 
Because they’re long-term issues (and investors assume more risk with 
a fixed-income, long-term investment), they typically pay a higher inter-
est rate than T-notes or T-bills.
 
 Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS): TIPS are government-
issued bonds whose principal amount adjusts to the rate of inflation. 
Both the interest payment and the principal face value of TIPS are 
affected by changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Because the 
principal is indexed to the CPI, if the index rises during periods of infla-
tion, your principal and interest are guaranteed to increase; therefore, 
the real purchasing power of the investment keeps pace with the rate of 
inflation. If deflation (a reduction in the general level of prices) occurs, 
TIPS are guaranteed to pay at maturity the greater of the original face 
value of the bond or the inflation-adjusted value. So what’s the down-
side? Because of their built-in inflation protection feature, the interest 
rate on TIPS tends to be lower than on other Treasury notes or bonds.
 
 When you invest in TIPS, you pay taxes on the income generated and the 
principal that accrues with inflation. A way to avoid paying income tax 
before you receive any income is to hold TIPS in an IRA.
Government-Sponsored Enterprises and 
Agency Bonds
A number of U.S. government agencies and various government-sponsored 
enterprises (GSEs) issue debt securities. Technically, these securities 
aren’t backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government; they rank 
one notch below U.S. Treasury issues in terms of safety. But because these 
government agencies play such a valuable role in the U.S. economy, the 
government isn’t likely to allow one of its agencies to default on these debt 
obligations. GSEs and federal agencies issue securities that, due to their lack 

82
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
of explicit guarantees, generally provide higher yields than Treasury securi-
ties do. Pick up a copy of Bond Investing For Dummies, by Russell Wild, for 
greater detail on agency bonds.
 
Bond investments, in general, don’t move in tandem with stock investments, 
so including a mix of bonds in an investment portfolio gives you a powerful 
tool in an uncertain economy: diversification. A mix of intermediate- or long-
term Treasury and agency bonds can provide a steady stream of essentially 
credit risk–free income.
Does Uncle Sam Equal Risk-Free?
Because Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S govern-
ment, they’re considered to have essentially no credit risk. Only a monumen-
tal event or combination of events — such as war, government scandal, or a 
collapse of the economy — would prevent the U.S. government from repaying 
its debts. If these events occur, the government has the power to increase 
taxes and print additional money if the need arises. So you have almost no 
credit risk, but you do have other types of risks, just as you would with any 
type of fixed-rate security. Here are the major risks:
 
 Interest-rate risk: This is the risk that a bond’s value will fall when inter-
est rates go up. If you keep your bond until it matures, you’ll receive all 
the principal and interest you expected. However, if you need to sell 
your security before it matures and interest rates have gone up, you’ll 
probably have to sell it for less than you paid for it.
 
 Inflation risk: This is the risk that a bond’s return won’t keep up with 
inflation. This risk is a special concern for government bond holders; the 
longer the term of the bond, the greater the risk. Because lending Uncle 
Sam money involves no credit risk, the return is lower than it would be 
on higher-risk investments. If the U.S. economy is experiencing a period 
of inflation, the purchasing power of the dollar declines and so does 
the real value of your bond. TIPS and I bonds provide unique inflation 
adjustment features that help reduce this inflation risk.

Decide Whether Fixed Annuities 
Are Right for You
By Buz Livingston, CFP
D
oes an income stream that lasts a lifetime sound appealing? Adding a 
fixed annuity to your investment mix guarantees you won’t outlive your 
nest egg during uncertain times. An annuity is a promise from an insurance 
company to send you, the annuitant, payments for the rest of your life. If you 
live a long time, you win; a premature death means the insurance company 
wins.
Annuities come in two distinct flavors: fixed and variable. Fixed annuity pay-
ments remain constant. With a variable annuity, the payment changes as the 
annuity’s underlying value fluctuates. This strategy covers fixed annuities; for 
the lowdown on variable annuities, turn to Strategy #22.
Weigh the Pros and Cons
A fixed annuity isn’t suitable for everyone. Like other investment options, 
fixed annuities have their fair share of pros and cons.
Good reasons to buy a fixed annuity
The perfect candidate for a fixed annuity is an older investor in good health 
who has a family history of longevity and who is more interested in spending 
his or her money than passing it to heirs. If you want to spend the last dime, 
an annuity is just the ticket. Following are some other reasons to buy a fixed 
annuity:

84
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts throughout the Economic Cycle
 
 Generating income: One of the best reasons to buy a fixed annuity is 
having more money to spend. In some instances, an annuity can gener-
ate more income than a bond portfolio. For instance, a $100,000 bond 
portfolio at 4.5 percent interest may give a single, 70-year-old female 
an annual income of $4,500. But if she instead opts for a $100,000 
immediate annuity, she may rake in $8191.56, over 82 percent more a 
year. (However, if this individual dies with the $100,000 bond portfolio, 
$100,000 goes to her heirs. If she dies with this immediate annuity, the 
income stops and there’s nothing to leave to the heirs.)
 
 Building your pension: With the demise of traditional, defined benefit 
pension plans, you may find the security of lifetime income attractive.
 
 Freeing money for other investment: Retirees can use fixed annuity 
payments to cover basic living expenses, allowing the stock portion of 
their portfolios to be invested more aggressively.
 
 Paycheck replacement: Consider a fixed annuity as a way to replace 
your paycheck.
 
 Deferring taxes: If you’re not eligible for a Roth IRA contribution or are 
making the maximum contributions to your retirement account, a fixed 
annuity is an option for tax-deferred growth.
 
 Protecting Medicaid benefits: In some states, annuities aren’t subject 
to creditor claims or considered assets for Medicaid qualification pur-
poses. Discuss asset protection and Medicaid planning with an attorney 
to determine whether a fixed annuity is appropriate for you.
 
 Replacing a life insurance policy you no longer need: If you own a life 
insurance policy with cash value, consider a tax-deferred 1035 exchange 
to get a fixed annuity contract without immediate tax ramifications.
 
 Replacing an underperforming annuity: You can replace an existing, 
poorly performing annuity by initiating a 1035 exchange for a new and 
improved version. But be wary. Unscrupulous salespeople often encour-
age 1035 exchanges but gloss over additional surrender charges on the 
new annuity. Make sure you understand the implications of any new sur-
render charges resulting from a 1035 exchange.
 
Never put all your assets into a fixed annuity. Make sure you’re buying an 
annuity from a highly rated insurance company, and always buy a no-load 
annuity with low annual expenses and zero to low surrender charges.
Reasons not to buy a fixed annuity
High commissions can inspire zealous salespeople to tout the benefits of 
fixed annuities while glossing over the limitations. Many states require suit-
ability disclosures. Here are some of the risks:

85
 #19: Decide Whether Fixed Annuities Are Right for You
 
 Conservative returns: Fixed annuities are conservative investments. Be 
suspicious when someone touts an above-average return.
 
 Relatively young age: Fixed annuities generally work better for older 
folks; you should be in or near retirement. The older you are, the higher 
your payment will be.
 
 Heirs: Buying an annuity leaves less for your heirs to inherit unless you 
purchase a rider, but the rider results in a lower monthly payment. Your 
heirs also don’t receive the benefit of a step up in basis should you die 
before you begin annuity payments. They may be subject to substantial 
income taxes.
 
 Inflation risks: Purchasing an annuity means you’re locking in for the 
rest of your life, so unless you purchase an inflation rider, which will 
reduce your payments, the payments from a fixed annuity remain the 
same. Many years of high inflation can erode your purchasing power.
 
 Health: If you’re in poor health, a fixed annuity is a bad idea. Remember, 
an annuity is “living insurance” because it pays more the longer you live. 
If you die shortly after buying an annuity, the insurance company wins.
 
 Withdrawal penalties: Withdrawals before you reach age 591/2 trigger 
a penalty. Also, annuities often charge a fee for any redemption during 
the beginning of the contract (called the surrender period). Don’t buy an 
annuity unless you’re absolutely certain you won’t need the funds as a 
lump sum for something like medical expenses.
 
 Make sure you understand how surrender charges are calculated. 
Generally, surrender fees decline the longer you own the annuity. For 
example, a five-year surrender charge may levy a 5 percent penalty in 
year one, 4 percent in year two, and so on.
 
An equity-indexed annuity (EIA) is a fixed annuity guaranteeing a minimum rate 
of return tied to an equity index such as the S&P 500. This is an illusory sales 
pitch. High fees, exaggerated returns, and long surrender periods make EIAs 
uniformly inappropriate. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has 
issued a special alert regarding equity indexed annuities (www.sec.gov).
Choose a Payment Schedule
In terms of payment schedules, you can choose from two types of fixed 
annuities:
 
 Immediate: Payments can start anytime within 13 months. You can 
transfer a lump sum of money into an immediate annuity and turn on the 
tap to start receiving guaranteed income for life.

86
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts throughout the Economic Cycle
 
 Deferred: The payment start date depends on your contract. The longer 
you delay, the greater the payment. Deferred annuities are inappropri-
ate for most investors. The only reason to have a deferred annuity is 
to shelter income taxes, and you can do that in many less expensive 
ways. However, if you’re planning to annuitize soon but not quite yet, a 
deferred annuity may make sense.
Select Any Riders for Your Contract
As with any insurance policy, riders are available on fixed annuities during 
the payout phase. They’re set terms added to the basic contract. Popular 
riders include the following:
 
 Return of premium or installment refund: Gives your beneficiary up 
to the full amount invested should you die before receiving payments 
equaling your initial investment
 
 Specific term guarantee (term certain): Locks in a number of years that 
the annuity will pay the annuitant or beneficiary
 
 Spousal benefit: Lets the surviving spouse receive the benefit; a 50 
percent spousal benefit is a popular option, but surviving spouses often 
find this amount is insufficient
 
 Inflation protection: Increases the monthly payment every year; the 
annuitant can select the level of inflation protection, from 1 to 3 percent
 
If you invest primarily in fixed income instruments such as bonds or CDs, con-
sider an inflation-protected annuity. Otherwise, a diversified stock portfolio 
offers a better choice for inflation protection.
 
Insurance companies aren’t charities, so riders on annuities aren’t free. All 
riders reduce your payments. For example, a 20-year guarantee offers a lower 
payment than a 10-year guarantee. And if you choose a 2 percent inflation 
rider, your monthly payment will be lower than with a 1 percent rider.

Simplify with Target-Date Funds
By Derek Kennedy, CFP
W
hen your employer asks you to pick the investments in your retire-
ment account, you may feel you’re in for a tough decision — almost 
as if you had to choose only one kind of ice cream for the rest of your life. 
The usual reaction to the ice cream question is to respond with your favor-
ite flavor. But like the clever kid who chooses Neapolitan — chocolate, 
vanilla, and strawberry in a single carton — you can choose a fund that’s 
the Neapolitan of the investment world, allowing you many flavors of funds 
within a single package.
Target-date funds — also known as life-cycle funds, target retirement funds, 
target maturity funds, and age-based funds — are mutual funds whose assets 
change based on your age. Because a target-date fund invests in other mutual 
funds, it’s known as a fund of funds. These funds are a big hit with defined 
contribution retirement plans like 401(k)s. Employers and employees both 
love their simplicity, ease of use, and built-in variety.
One-Stop Shopping for a Diversified 
Retirement Portfolio
Target-date funds typically invest in a mix of other mutual funds to create an asset 
allocation consistent with the length of time an investor has until retirement, as 
designated by the date in the fund’s name, such as XYZ Target 2030 Fund.
These funds are generally offered by large mutual fund families who manage 
the underlying funds, including Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price. 
Managers automatically rebalance the mix of funds over time so the asset 
allocation continues to reflect your proximity to retirement. The mix of funds 
within the target-date fund is more aggressive for younger investors and 
becomes more conservative for older investors.
 
Don’t confuse a life-cycle fund with a lifestyle fund, also known as a target-risk 
fund or risk-based fund. These funds are also typically fund of funds, but they 
offer a static asset allocation. Although automatic rebalancing does occur, the 
asset mix doesn’t change as you get closer to retirement. Target-risk funds 
usually come in three varieties: aggressive, moderate, and conservative. 
They’re intended to correspond with an individual’s risk tolerance.

88
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle 
The Upside of Target-Date Funds
Target-date funds can be beneficial in uncertain times, even if you’re an expe-
rienced investor and even if you don’t intend to use them as your core retire-
ment savings. For instance, with small accounts, the automatic rebalancing 
feature may help save on the trading fees you’d pay on individual funds if you 
were to rebalance them yourself. These fees can be a significant drag on per-
formance in accounts with small balances. Also, because most mutual funds 
require minimum initial investments, target-date funds give you the benefits 
of diversification in accounts not large enough to fund the investment mini-
mums of multiple individual mutual funds.
 
Target-date funds can be an important investment tool in uncertain economic 
times because they keep you focused on saving rather than worrying about 
investment choices. They allocate and maintain your investment with your 
retirement date in mind. The ability to maintain an appropriate asset alloca-
tion and avoid emotional reactions to market conditions and uncertainty may 
be the single most important thing that you can do for your investment portfo-
lio over the long haul.
Great Isn’t Necessarily Perfect: The 
Downside of Target-Date Funds
Like any investment, target-date funds have tradeoffs and issues relating to 
personal situations and preferences. Here are some to be aware of:
 
 Target-date funds aren’t personalized. The asset allocations are 
designed to be generally appropriate for people of a certain age or dis-
tance from retirement. That allocation may not be consistent with your 
own risk tolerance or financial situation. If you expect to retire in 2032, 
should you select the target 2030 fund or the target 2035 fund? Most 
target-date funds target age 65 for your retirement, but what if you plan 
to work longer than that? What if, due to other sources of retirement 
income, you don’t intend to start accessing the money in your 401(k) for 
many years beyond your retirement date?
 
 Funds with the same target dates offered by different companies often 
have different initial allocations, may change allocations over time differ-
ently, and may have different allocations after they reach their target at 
retirement.

89
 #20: Simplify with Target-Date Funds
 
 Target-date funds can be difficult to integrate with other parts of your 
investment portfolio.
 
 Target-date funds are already diversified. Investors are often tempted to 
add other investments to their account because they know that diversi-
fication is important and having just one mutual fund feels wrong. Don’t 
give in to the lure. Doing so can undermine your asset allocation and 
defeat the purpose you have for using a target-date fund.
 
 The underlying funds may not include exposure to as much of an asset 
class or as many asset classes as you may like.
However, for ease of use and the potential to get it mostly right, target-date 
funds can be a fantastic option.
Evaluate Your Options
A target-date fund may be a one-stop-shop, but it’s not a one-time decision. Here 
are some ideas to keep in mind when evaluating which fund is right for you:
 
 Consider whether the internal asset allocation and progression is con-
sistent with your needs, and compare allocations among various fund 
managers.
 
 Consider the fees. Target-date fund fees are based on the fees of their 
underlying assets, and though not typical, some managers may charge 
an additional management fee on top of those.
 
 Consider the track record and performance of the underlying funds. 
Some target-date funds are based on a mix of index funds, and others 
rely on actively managed mutual funds. Which type of funds suits you 
best?
No matter which fund you choose, monitor the fund’s asset allocation and 
compare it to your own evolving preferences over time. And as with any 
investment, you should continue to monitor the fees and performance of the 
underlying funds at least annually to make sure that everything is on track.

Invest in Mutual Funds
By Bruce Sneed, MBA, CFP
M
utual funds are an established way to invest in an uncertain economy. 
At their core, mutual funds are merely a collection of shares of individ-
ual companies’ stock, possibly corporate or government bonds, and maybe 
some cash. By owning shares in a mutual fund, you actually own a few shares 
in dozens or possibly hundreds of different stocks or bonds.
Reap the Benefits of Mutual 
Fund Investment
People invest in mutual funds for four fundamental reasons: professional 
management, diversification, convenience, and marketability. The following 
sections outline these benefits, which make mutual funds most attractive 
when capital markets are unusually volatile.
Professional management
Mutual funds offer professional management of your money. These manag-
ers have the training and resources to keep abreast of and adjust to market 
changes. Unfortunately, fund managers don’t have a crystal ball giving them 
the ability to foresee the future; don’t expect your manager to keep you com-
pletely out of harm’s way.
Fund managers are required by law to select and manage fund holdings in 
accordance with the fund’s investment objectives and policies, as described 
in the fund’s prospectus. These objectives may be designed to minimize your 
risk exposure.
Diversification: Spreading out the risk
Mutual funds help eliminate some of the risk involved in investing in indi-
vidual stocks and bonds by giving you shares in many different assets. 
Remember Enron or MCI? How did that work out for employees who based 

91

their futures on company stock? Mutual funds also reduce your cost of diver-
sifying by sharing transaction costs with other shareholders.
Although every mutual fund buys many securities, the funds themselves 
come in a wide variety of styles and classifications. Some mutual funds spe-
cialize in growth, some in value. Some invest in U.S. markets, others in foreign 
markets. Some invest only in bonds, others in a blend of stocks and bonds. 
A well diversified portfolio invests across many styles and types of mutual 
funds. See Strategies #39 through #46 for information about asset allocation 
and diversifying your overall holdings.
 
Read the prospectus summary and annual report. Sometimes the titles of 
mutual funds can be misleading. A fund with the word growth in its title 
doesn’t have to be fully invested in growth stocks. Also, your mutual fund 
manager’s investment style can drift, especially in turbulent markets.
Convenience
The convenience of mutual funds begins with the initial purchase and con-
tinues with investments, withdrawals, reinvestment of dividends and capital 
gains, record-keeping, and tax reporting. Mutual funds make it easy and inex-
pensive to dollar-cost average (invest regular amounts of money at regular 
intervals). This strategy is especially beneficial when markets are highly vola-
tile — you end up buying more shares when costs are low. You can usually 
find everything you need to read, see, or do at a fund’s Web site; otherwise, 
call the fund company.
Marketability
Marketability means you can easily buy or sell mutual fund shares. Unlike 
owning a house, you may be able to quickly exchange shares in a mutual 
fund for another investment or cash. Marketability gives you the flexibility to 
create and maintain a diversified portfolio.
Choose from Types of Funds
There are two major types of funds:
 
 Open-end funds: These are the most common type of mutual funds. You 
purchase and redeem the shares of open-end investment companies 
each day at their current net asset values (NAV) plus sales charges or 
minus redemption fees, if any. The NAV is calculated at the end of each 
day based on the value of the fund’s underlying securities (stocks and/
or bonds). There’s no limit to the number of shares that can be issued.

92
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
 
 Closed-end funds: Like open-end funds, closed-end funds buy many dif-
ferent stocks or bonds. But these make an initial public offering (IPO) of 
a specific number of shares and then trade on the stock exchange — simi-
lar to common stocks — at either a premium or discount to their NAV. 
Their market price fluctuates throughout the day based on supply and 
demand. Closed-end funds can be more volatile because they may have 
less trading volume then a similar open-ended fund.
 
Because the initial offering price of a closed-end fund includes a sales commis-
sion, the shares are issued at a premium over the invested assets. However 
after the IPO is completed, closed-end funds often trade at a discount. 
Therefore, it makes sense to forego purchasing new offerings of closed-end 
funds. Instead, you should consider purchasing shares when they become 
available on the stock exchange at a discount from their net asset value. Table 
21-1 summarizes the differences between closed-end and open-end funds.

Choose the Level of Management: Trying 
to Meet or Beat the Market
Mutual funds may be either index funds or managed funds. Index funds buy a 
set collection of securities and mostly leave the portfolio alone, earning you 
investment returns as the underlying values of the stocks or bonds you hold 
appreciate. Active fund managers select securities in an attempt to beat the 
market or achieve a better risk-adjusted return than the market. However, 
they put a dent in your earnings by charging higher annual management fees.

 #21: Invest in Mutual Funds
Index funds
Index funds are popular because they’re inexpensive, easy to understand, 
and give you a return similar to the market your index fund is designed to 
track. Because of their popularity, mutual fund companies continue to bring 
several varieties of index funds to market. Funds are indexed to all types 
of assets and subsequently have all kinds of investment styles, expected 
returns, risk, and expenses.
Stock index mutual funds invest in a particular segment of the financial 
market, such as the S&P 500 Stock Index, or in the entire market, such as the 
Wilshire 5000 Total Stock Market Index. Their objective is to simply match 
the market returns of that index by investing in the securities in the index. 
Index funds typically have very low expenses.
 
Common stock index funds can take you on a rough ride in a volatile market. 
Because the fund is usually fully invested and doesn’t maintain substantial 
cash reserves, it’s fully exposed to market ups and downs. However, over the 
long term, stock indexing is a sensible investment strategy.
Bond index funds work a little differently, but the basic objectives are the 
same: Try to match market returns and keep expenses low. Bonds aren’t as 
liquid as stocks, so transaction costs are a bit higher and it’s harder to match 
the benchmark. The standard benchmark is the Lehman Brothers Aggregate 
Bond Index, which comprises all investment grade bonds. You may find it 
suitable to invest in a fund targeting this index if you have an intermediate-
term investment horizon.
Actively managed funds
Actively managed funds attempt to deliver returns greater than that of the 
overall market or aim for lower returns with less volatility. Fund managers 
use a myriad of factors to analyze the economy, industry sectors, and spe-
cific companies. Some managers consistently outperform the market on a 
risk-adjusted basis, but studies show that the majority don’t. Managed funds 
tend to be higher cost than index funds because of the cost of maintaining a 
research staff and because of more frequent trading.
Some managed funds have low correlation to the market (maybe because 
they have substantial cash) and therefore hold up pretty well in a downturn 
but don’t do so well when the market rebounds. Others use leverage to mag-
nify the volatility both on the upside and the downside. Most actively man-
aged funds fall somewhere in the middle.

Pick the Funds That Meet Your Needs
 
After you decide to invest in mutual funds, check out these tips on selecting 
the right funds for your situation:
 
 Understand your investment objectives, time horizon, and tolerance 
for risk. If you’re investing for retirement or college more than ten 
years away, you want to use common stock funds, which can outpace 
inflation. For shorter-term objectives, less volatile short-term bond 
funds or money market mutual funds are more appropriate. Regardless, 
never assume more risk than is necessary to meet your objectives. See 
Strategy #40.
 
 Decide whether you want to be an active or passive fund investor 
(or both). There are thousands of fund choices and many variables to 
consider, including the fund company, portfolio manager, portfolio char-
acteristics, cost of ownership, and past performance relative to peer 
groups. If looking at all these variables seems like too much work, then 
passive investing through common stock index funds may be for you.
 
 Be sure you want to buy bond funds, not individual bonds. A bond 
fund has a substantially fixed maturity, so you’re always exposed to a 
certain level of principal risk no matter how long you hold the fund; the 
maturity of a bond, however, declines steadily, and your principal risk 
declines each year you hold the bond. Here’s how to decide what’s right 
for you:
 
• If you want to maintain a fixed stream of interest income payments, 
buy individual bonds.
 
• If you don’t have enough assets to buy a diversified portfolio of 
bonds (Strategy #27), you’re best off with a bond mutual fund.
 
• If you don’t want to analyze bond fund criteria, select a bond index 
mutual fund.
 
 Pay attention to the fund fees. Some funds have upfront fees, called 
front-loads, which are really commissions that go to the sales force or 
companies. Others have redemption fees, called rear-end loads, charged 
when you sell your fund. Still others nick you for a small percentage 
every year that you own the fund as an additional load.

Hedge Your Bets with Variable 
Annuities
By Cheryl Krueger
T
ake a fixed annuity, add control over investment options, sprinkle in 
some guarantees, and what do you have? A variable annuity. Variable 
annuities have many of the same characteristics of fixed annuities (see 
Strategy #19), including tax deferral and the potential for lifetime income. But 
unlike fixed annuities, variable annuities allow the policyholder to choose the 
investments that determine the return instead of relying on an insurer’s inter-
est return.
Because the variable annuity is an insurance product, it can provide guaran-
tees that aren’t available in mutual funds, making this product attractive in 
uncertain times. Many of these guarantee features appeal to clients looking to 
benefit from market returns while limiting their risk of losing money.
Understand the Basic Variable Annuity
Like fixed annuities, variable annuities come in two forms: deferred and 
immediate. (Refer to “Get Assured Income in Retirement” later in this strat-
egy for more information on immediate annuities.) A deferred variable annuity 
essentially looks like a mutual fund account.
When you buy a variable annuity, you select from a limited list of investment 
funds provided by the company. Your variable annuity account value reflects 
both gains and losses of the selected investment funds, so you can end up 
with losses in your variable annuity account. All variable annuities have the 
following characteristics:
 
 Tax deferral on the amount left in accumulation
 
 No federal limits on contributions

96
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle 
 
 Funds that are kept separate from the insurer’s other assets, so they’re 
not subject to the claims of the company’s creditors or other customers 
of the variable annuity company
 
 Earnings subject to a 10-percent penalty tax if withdrawn prior to 
age 591/2
 
Be aware of the various expenses that a variable annuity charges:
 
 Surrender charges: If you withdraw from your annuity within the first 
several years of your payment, the company may keep a certain percent-
age of the initial premium as a surrender charge. These charges gener-
ally start at around 7 percent and decrease by 1 percent per year.
 
 Fund management fees: These fees, which go to the investment man-
ager, are a percentage of the account balance. They may vary from 0.25 
percent to over 1.00 percent per year, depending on your choice of 
investment funds.
 
 Mortality and expense charge: The insurer charges this fee to cover its 
expenses and to provide any insurance benefits such as death benefit 
guarantees and guaranteed withdrawal benefits. These charges can vary 
from 0.50 percent to over 1.00 percent annually.
 
 Policy fees: Insurers may charge a flat fee per contract, typically 
around $30.
Look into Riders Designed 
to Reduce Risk
Variable annuities can provide guarantees that mutual funds can’t. Twenty 
years ago, the typical variable deferred annuity had a simple guarantee: the 
return of your premium to your heirs if you died. But now, you can find many 
different options to choose from. If you want protection from declines in the 
markets, these riders may appeal to you.
Use your annuity for retirement income
Annuities are retirement investments, so it’s not surprising that insurers 
have started to enhance variable annuities to provide protection against 
declines. Here are some of the more common riders:

97
 #22: Hedge Your Bets with Variable Annuities
 
 Guaranteed minimum income benefit: With this benefit, your retire-
ment income is based on the value of your annuity account or on your 
initial premium accumulated at some interest rate (usually 4 to 6 per-
cent), whichever is greater. The benefit applies only if you
 
• Keep your deferred annuity for a period of time (five to ten years).
 
• Use the annuity for retirement income benefits, or annuitization 
(receiving regular payments at regular intervals for either a life-
time or a specific period of time).
 
 Many insurers cap the growth at 2.5 to 3 times the original premium.
 
 Guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits: If you have this rider, you 
can withdraw a percentage of your account value every year and not 
outlive your withdrawals. This rider is an alternative to annuitization, 
and it provides protection against decreasing account values during 
your retirement.
These guarantees are designed to appeal to investors who are loss averse, 
and variations appear continuously. Unfortunately, they’re an expensive 
addition to an annuity contract. Keep in mind that with any of these riders, 
you’re buying insurance — and there’s a good chance you won’t collect just 
as you won’t collect on your auto insurance if you’re a good driver. Rather 
than fully benefiting from increasing markets, you’re paying an annual fee to 
get a floor on your losses.
 
If you have money to invest, don’t get sold on the appeal of annuity guaran-
tees alone. If you do buy, be prepared to have your money invested for at least 
ten years. Never put all your savings into an annuity contract. In most cases, 
you should keep IRA and other retirement plan money out of annuities. Read 
your contract and prospectus, and remember that you have ten days after you 
get your contract to change your mind.
Finally, note that the insurance company provides the guarantees, even 
though your assets are in a separate account of the insurance company. 
Make sure you’re dealing with a highly rated company. For insurance com-
pany ratings, go to www.ambest.com; make sure your insurer is rated excel-
lent or higher.
Pass your annuity on to heirs
If you’re going to pass your annuity on to heirs, the guaranteed minimum 
death benefit (GMDB) should appeal to you. This rider is still available in its 
original “return of premium” form; as a matter of fact, most annuities con-
tinue to include the cost of this benefit in their basic mortality and expense 

98
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle 
charge. For an additional cost, you can buy guarantees that lock in death 
benefits at a higher rate. Different policies have different ways of determining 
the amount of the guarantee, and charges vary.
 
The tax benefits of annuities make them more attractive as a retirement vehi-
cle than as a way to transfer money to your heirs. Annuities don’t get a step 
up in basis on death, so your heirs will owe income tax on all your deferred 
earnings. If you want to use your annuity money during your lifetime, don’t 
pay for an accelerating death benefit guarantee.
Make sure you get your 
annuity money back
The guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB) promises that you’ll 
get your money back if you keep the annuity for a certain number of years, 
usually ten. If you’re not comfortable with downside investment risk and 
you’re a good candidate for an annuity purchase, you may find this feature 
attractive. The typical annual cost is 0.20 to 0.30 percent.
Get Assured Income in Retirement
You may wonder how long your retirement nest egg will last. An immediate 
annuity (so named because payments start immediately) guarantees that you 
won’t outlive your income. With a fixed immediate annuity, payments gener-
ally remain level, which means that after a few years, inflation eats away at 
your income. A variable immediate annuity uses market investment returns 
to (hopefully) provide an increasing benefit stream.
With a variable annuity, benefits are initially based on an assumed interest 
rate (AIR). This rate is usually in the range of 3 to 6 percent. You may get a 
choice of rates, or the insurer may have a single rate available. The higher 
the AIR, the higher the initial benefit. If your selected portfolio yields more 
than the AIR, your benefit will increase. If your yield is less, your benefit will 
decrease.
Look for variable annuities with low fees. Select a lower AIR so you’ll have 
more upside potential. And see whether your company offers a leveling ben-
efit so your payments change only annually rather than every month.

99
 #22: Hedge Your Bets with Variable Annuities
Manage Your Variable Annuity
When you bought your variable annuity, did you decide to just let it accumu-
late and not look at the balance? You need to review a variable annuity peri-
odically, just like any investment. A variable annuity account value fluctuates 
in the same way the market fluctuates. Here are some tips for managing your 
existing variable annuity:
 
 Don’t forget to include your variable annuity as you consider your 
portfolio allocation. When you allocate your investments, pick the best 
funds available in your variable annuity and then see how they fit within 
your overall portfolio. Make sure your financial planner knows what 
investments you have inside your annuity so he or she can consider 
them in the overall allocation.
 
 Know your annuity expenses. If you’ve had your annuity contract for 
more than a few years, you may be paying too much in mortality and 
expense charges. Today, you can buy a variable annuity with Vanguard, 
Fidelity, or other low-cost providers that have total fees as low as 0.58 
percent annually, rather than the 2.37-percent average annual fee. If 
you’re beyond the surrender charge period, you can roll your existing 
annuity into a new annuity without taxes by using a 1035 exchange.
 
 Beware of salespeople who tell you your annuity has matured. If 
you have a variable annuity with high expenses, transfer those funds 
to a new annuity only after you’ve reviewed the expenses, surrender 
charges, and funds available in the new product. Call your insurance 
company directly if you have questions about the maturity (or any 
other) provisions in your current variable annuity contract.
 
 If you’re not rebalancing your variable annuity to keep your alloca-
tions in line, check whether your insurer offers an automatic rebalanc-
ing program. These programs are usually free — you just sign up and 
choose whether to rebalance quarterly, semiannually, or annually.

Invest in Exchange-Traded Funds 
(ETFs)
By Charles Levin, CPA
E
xchange-traded funds, also known as ETFs, have been around since 
1993, but their popularity has mushroomed in the last several years. An 
ETF is simply a basket of stocks or bonds that you purchase just like shares 
of stock. However, with a single investment in an ETF, you own a piece of 
dozens if not hundreds of different stocks (or bonds). Unlike index mutual 
funds, ETFs trade on a stock exchange, so you can buy and sell them just like 
you buy and sell stocks.
The oldest and most popular ETFs track very broad, well-known indexes such 
as the S&P 500 Stock Index. However, a wide variety of methodologies has 
emerged for creating new indexes that are tracked by ETFs, ranging from the 
straightforward to the very complex.
During uncertain economic times, when financial markets tend to exhibit 
much greater volatility, maintaining discipline takes on even greater 
importance. ETFs can make it easy for you to implement and maintain this 
restraint. But you need to know enough about the universe of ETFs to use 
them wisely. (Part II has several strategies to help you understand risks asso-
ciated with investing, assess your risk tolerance, and allocate your assets to 
minimize risk.)
ETFs versus Index Funds: 
Which Should You Buy?
Index mutual funds and ETFs, especially those ETFs that track broad indexes, 
have many similarities. However, their structural differences — where they’re 
traded, how they’re priced, and so on — can mean that one or the other is a 
better choice for investors in different situations. (See Strategy #21 for more 
on index funds.)
Table 23-1 lists the key structural features of ETFs and index funds.

So should you invest in ETFs or index funds? Here are some guidelines:
 
 If you’re going to be making smaller, periodic investments, such as when 
you have an amount regularly withdrawn from your bank account or 
withheld from your paycheck for your company’s 401(k) plan, you’re 
likely better off using an index fund purchased directly from a mutual 
fund company to avoid paying commissions every time.
 
 If you’re going to be making a single or occasional investment, then the 
impact of the commissions won’t matter much over time. The next prior-
ity is then to compare the fees being charged by ETFs and index funds 
following the same index. ETFs often have lower fees, which can mean 
a great deal over time and is especially important during uncertain eco-
nomic times.
In the end, the decision can come down to how often you’ll be adding to or 
withdrawing from your investment.

102

Evaluate ETFs
You definitely need to do some research before investing in ETFs. A great 
resource is Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies. You can also find a great 
deal of information about ETFs on the Internet. Here are some useful sites:
 
 Morningstar.com: www.morningstar.com/Cover/ETF.html
 
 Yahoo! Finance: finance.yahoo.com/etf
 
 The American Stock Exchange: amex.com
In addition, brokerage firm Web sites and many mutual fund company Web 
sites provide a wealth of information on ETFs.
 
When evaluating ETFs, you should focus on these areas:
 
 The index the ETF tracks: Understand what the index consists of and 
the rules it follows in selecting and weighting the securities it holds.
 
 How long the ETF and/or its underlying index have been in existence: 
You want to buy an ETF that has a track record. If possible, you should 
also review how the index has performed in good times and bad.
 
 The company that manages the ETF: Review how long the company has 
been managing ETFs in general and how long it’s been managing the par-
ticular ETF you’re looking at.
 
 How accurately the ETF has tracked its underlying index: You can find 
reports that show the performance of the ETF over various time periods 
versus its index. If the ETF has been run effectively, the only difference 
between the performance of the ETF and the underlying index should be 
the fees charged by the ETF.
 
 The ETF’s expense ratios: The greater the ETF’s assets, the more 
straightforward its investing strategy, and the more prominent and well-
known its underlying index, the lower the expenses are likely to be. You 
should also compare the expense ratios of ETFs that follow the same 
index. Some have lower fees than others.
Develop an ETF Strategy
Especially in difficult economic times, you need to stick to the basics when 
investing. Develop an asset allocation that makes sense based on your finan-
cial goals, your time horizon for investing, and your capacity for risk. Using 
ETFs that track broad market indexes gives you wide diversification. Include 
indexes such as the following, which are all widely used, highly diversified 
indexes that have been in existence for a long time:

103
 #23: Invest in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
 
 S&P 500: Large company U.S. stocks
 
 Wilshire 5000: All U.S. stocks
 
 Russell 2000: Small company U.S. stocks
 
 MSCI EAFE: Foreign stocks of countries with developed financial 
markets
 
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index: Foreign stocks of countries whose mar-
kets are less developed
 
 Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index: U.S. bonds
 
Some newer ETFs are much riskier than index funds and ETFs that invest in 
broad market indexes. The following types of ETFs are too risky to be sensibly 
used by the vast majority of investors, especially in these uncertain times:
 
 A number of the newer ETFs follow much narrower indexes that, for 
example, may track the stocks of a single country, industry, or commod-
ity (such as the price of oil). These ETFs tend to have much higher fees 
than those that track broad indexes, and these fees can greatly reduce 
the value of your portfolio over time. In addition, the more narrowly 
focused ETFs are often trying to capitalize on what’s been most recently 
the hot segment of the market, and you just may find yourself investing 
at exactly the wrong time.
 
 Some ETFs magnify the positive and negative returns of an index. For 
example, one ETF uses leverage, or borrowing, in order to generate twice 
the yield of the S&P 500. When the market is going up, this ETF greatly 
increases your gain. But if the market is down, your losses are magnified 
as well. If you choose to invest in one of the leveraged ETFs, be prepared 
for a wild ride through the ups and downs of its performance. Although 
the gains can be huge, so can the losses.
 
 You can also find ETFs that are structured to generate a gain equal to 
the amount the market or a specific market segment has lost.
 
Only the most sophisticated investors should short-sell ETFs. Short-selling, or 
shorting, is borrowing shares from a broker and then immediately selling them 
with the idea that you’ll buy the shares back at a lower price. You’re betting 
that the market is going to decline.

Diversify with Real Estate 
Investment Trusts
By Brian R. Smith, PhD
Y
ou don’t have to be a real estate tycoon or an investor with a high net 
worth to benefit from real estate. Many people first experience real 
estate investing when buying their first home. For some, a next step may be 
the purchase of another residential property or house.
But managing tenants, property, and cash flow can be burdensome. In addi-
tion, you have to be savvy when choosing location and negotiating terms and 
conditions. Furthermore, the cost and complexity of commercial real estate 
make it out of reach for most investors. If investing in real estate sounds 
daunting , real estate investment trusts (REITs) may be right for you. REITs 
are also a common asset class in many diversified portfolios.
Get to Know REITs
REITs are corporations that invest in real estate and pay out at least 90 per-
cent of their income in dividends. Some offer the potential for large dividends 
and trade on the public stock exchange. REITs are more liquid than tradi-
tional real estate investments in which you’re the landlord. In addition, inves-
tors don’t need to worry about negotiating, repairing, advertising, pricing, or 
selling.
Here are the three types of REITs:
 
 Equity: These REITs own and operate income-producing properties — 
such as apartment buildings, offices, shopping centers, self-storage facil-
ities, and industrial warehouses — and they engage in a wide range of 
real estate activities, including leasing, development, and management. 
They’re the largest and most widely known type of REIT.

105
 #24: Diversify with Real Estate Investment Trusts
 
 Mortgage: These REITs lend money directly to real estate owners and 
operators or extend credit indirectly through the acquisition of loans or 
mortgage-backed securities.
 
 Changes in interest rates and the possibility of defaults make mortgage 
REITs more volatile than equity REITs.
 
 Hybrid: These REITs both own properties and make loans to real estate 
owners and operators.
Table 24-1 describes the characteristics of publicly traded REITs.
Table 24-1 
How Publicly Traded REITs Measure Up
Characteristic
Description
Performance
The dividends are generally competitive when 
compared to those of investment-grade corpo-
rate bonds, Treasury bonds, and stocks. REITs 
can provide strong capital appreciation.
Taxation
Dividends are taxed as ordinary income; capi-
tal appreciation, as capital gains.
Liquidity
REITs trade like stocks on public exchanges. 
Transaction costs can be low when you use 
discount brokers.
Diversification
REITs have low correlation to other asset 
classes. You can purchase them in mutual 
funds of REITs, indexes, or as focused 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in particular 
sectors. Geographic diversity is an additional 
advantage.
Transparency
Reporting is done in compliance with SEC 
requirements for publicly listed securities.
Leverage
You can buy REITs, ETF REITs, or mutual 
fund REITs on margin in taxable brokerage 
accounts.
See Strategy #23 for more on exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
 
When REITs aren’t offered through public exchanges, investors may be 
restricted from selling shares (or units) in accordance with specified terms 
and conditions. These privately held REITs may offer higher dividends and the 
possibility of significant capital appreciation, but they may require high mini-
mum investments, lack transparency, and have diversification risks that are 
more difficult to understand.

106
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
Fit REITs into Your Portfolio
REITs — which aren’t strongly correlated with other asset classes, such as 
stocks or bonds — should comprise 3 to 10 percent of your total portfolio. Be 
aware that you may already own REITs in your stock portfolio. For example, 
the S&P 500 has approximately 2 percent in REITs.
For greater diversification, use mutual funds that own several different REITs. 
Some good no-load REIT funds include Fidelity Real Estate, Vanguard REIT 
Index, ProLogis, and Cohen & Steers Realty Shares.
REITs also offer an advantage that traditional rental real estate doesn’t: You 
can readily include REITs in your retirement account (for example, an IRA or 
Keogh).
 
So how do you value a REIT? Look at its net asset value (NAV), adjusted funds 
from operations (AFFO), and cash available for distribution (CAD). If you want 
to compare REITs to stocks, the price divided by the AFFO is roughly equiva-
lent to the P/E ratio for a stock (refer to Strategy #43 for more on P/E ratios):
REIT value = price ÷ adjusted funds from operations

Investment Trusts (www.nareit.com).

Consider a Separately 
Managed Account
By Thomas Arconti, CFP
F
or most investors, a well diversified portfolio of mutual funds and/
or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) serves them well throughout their 
lifetimes. However, you may have reason to want a professionally tailored 
portfolio.
Many studies show that low-cost, passive investing outperforms active 
investment management over the long haul. But in periods of uncertain eco-
nomic times, you may want to engage in a specific investment strategy that 
you believe will perform better under current conditions. Or you may simply 
take greater comfort in having a professional money manager at the helm. In 
that case, separately managed accounts (SMAs) may provide an alternative 
or complement to mutual-fund investing. Read on to discover more about 
these customized accounts.
Understand What SMAs Are
A separately managed account (SMA) is an investment portfolio that one or 
more professional money managers control on behalf of an individual or 
institution. Most often, large financial firms like banks, full-service brokerage 
houses, or fund companies are the ones who offer SMAs.
The account manager provides model portfolios based on selected invest-
ment criteria (such as large cap value, small company growth, and so on), 
but you can get a portfolio that’s customized to meet your particular needs, 
such as minimizing taxable distributions and generating income. An SMA 
can be comprised of stocks, bonds, cash, or other types of securities, and 
the account manager has discretion — the ability to buy or sell securities 
on your behalf — as long as the investment choices conform to the stated 
investment strategy.

108
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
Similar to hiring other professionals (such as an attorney or CPA), you hire 
an account manager to oversee and manage, on a day-to-day basis, either 
a portion of or your entire investment portfolio. You may confer with the 
account manager about your investment account, and at times you may 
direct the manager to take certain actions; but generally, you hire the man-
ager for his or her particular expertise, and you expect the manager to call 
the shots regarding investment decisions related to the managed account.
Weigh the Pros and Cons of SMAs
Like any type of investment product or service, SMAs have advantages and 
disadvantages. On the plus side, here’s what you get:
 
 Tax efficiency: Individual cost basis allows you to harvest capital gains 
and losses to minimize your capital gains tax liability. In other words, 
the SMA manager minimizes your taxable gains. With other taxable 
investments, you’d have to do it yourself.
 
 Professional management: Professional money managers conduct the 
research and analysis to make informed decisions on your behalf.
 
 Manager access: You can discuss the details of your investments and 
express any concerns or constraints you have with the account managers.
 
 Transparency: You always know what you’re invested in because your 
account statements list each individual holding, with number of shares, 
cost basis, and current values.
 
 Customization: You can include or exclude certain securities or entire 
sectors. For instance, if you’ve accumulated a concentrated position in 
your employer’s company stock, such as Intel, you can exclude Intel and 
similar technology stocks from your holdings.
 
 Liquidity: You can buy and sell individual securities as needed, as 
opposed to trading shares of a single fund (as is the case with mutual 
funds or ETFs).
Here are some of the disadvantages:
 
 High fees and minimum investments: SMAs typically come with high 
fees in order to provide the personalized service. The fees are usu-
ally charged as a percentage of assets under management (AUM) and 
can range from 1.0 to 3.0 percent. A minimum investment is generally 
required as well. 
 
 Manager options: Upwards of 25,000 asset managers are in the market-
place. You have to narrow the field and select the manager(s) who can 
provide a good fit for you and offer the best chance to achieve your 
financial goals.

 #25: Consider a Separately ManagedAccount
 
 Need for ongoing monitoring: You have to continually monitor the per-
formance of your manager(s) to determine relative performance to the 
market: Are the managers worth their fees? Are they staying true to their 
philosophy and approach? Is there style drift, such as buying growth 
companies in a value portfolio? What’s their trading frequency? Their 
compliance history?
Compare SMAs to Mutual Funds
The primary difference between a separately managed account and a mutual 
fund is that in an SMA, you actually own shares of the individual stocks in the 
portfolio. With mutual funds, you don’t individually own any of the underly-
ing shares that comprise that fund. Instead, the mutual fund company owns 
the shares and the investors share the benefits in common.
Table 25-1 provides a side-by-side comparison of the key features of SMAs 
and mutual funds.

Mutual Funds
Access to 
professional

Individual investors may have 
direct access to the account 
manager.
Individual investors have no 
direct access to fund manag-
ers.
Portfolio 
structure
Individuals can have a port-
folio customized to meet their 
specific needs and desires.
The portfolio is structured to 
meet the fund’s written invest-
ment strategy. No customiza-
tion is allowed.
Full invest-
ment capa-
bility
Investors can fully invest the 
account for maximum poten-
tial gain. The manager isn’t 
required to hold cash in the 
account.
Mutual funds usually hold cash 
to meet redemption require-
ments. If short on cash, man-
agers may be forced to sell 
holdings to meet the redemp-
tion demand.
Taxation
Can be tax efficient; by 
choosing when to buy or sell 
individual securities in the 
account, investors can har-
vest tax losses
Generally not tax efficient for 
individual investors because 
buying and selling deci-
sions are made on a global 
basis (Note: Some funds are 
designed and marketed as 
tax-managed funds. Others, 
such as index funds, tend to be 
inherently tax efficient.)

Separately Managed 
Accounts
Mutual Funds
Minimum 
investment 
require-
ments
SMAs have much higher 
minimum investment require-
ments than mutual funds. 
Minimums vary but usually 
begin at $100,000.
Most mutual funds have low 
minimums. They vary from as 
low as $50 to $10,000 or more 
on the high end.
Fees
Management fees vary but 
are usually significantly 
higher than those of mutual 
funds. Total fees include the 
management fee, brokerage 
costs, and account service 
fee. These can range from 
1.5% to 3% per year.
Management fees can range 
from as low as 0.2% for no-
load index funds to around 2% 
for actively managed funds. 
Brokerage fees and other 
costs must also be included. 
These additional fees can 
result in total costs of about 
0.3% to 3% per year.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have many of the same features as mutual 
funds, except ETFs are fully invested. They offer great tax efficiency and 
liquidity, with no minimum investment requirements and at a much lower 
cost than SMAs. For more on ETFs, see Strategy #23.
Examine the Types of SMAs
Just like mutual funds and ETFs, you can obtain separately managed 
accounts in many flavors. You may want a narrowly focused SMA that spe-
cializes in one investment style (such as international growth or large cap 
value). Or you can employ a strategy mixing small, mid, and large cap equi-
ties (an All-Cap Core Equity strategy) that’ll meet your needs for a diversified 
portfolio. Here are examples of how you may use each type of SMA:
 
 Single-style SMAs: Suppose you’ve accumulated a good core portfolio 
through your 401(k) at work. You also have a sizable taxable invest-
ment account. After reviewing your overall asset allocation, you realize 
you’re overweighted in growth company funds and have little exposure 
to large cap value companies. You’d like the ability to manage capital 
gains and losses in your taxable account and also believe that in this 
market environment, an experienced asset manager could probably find 
good investment opportunities in the value arena. You research sepa-
rate account managers who specialize in large cap value portfolios and 
choose one to manage this account for you.

111
 #25: Consider a Separately ManagedAccount
 
 Multiple-style SMAs: You’re a detail-oriented person who prefers a more 
hands-on approach to investing and likes the ongoing personal service 
offered by SMAs. You decide to put your full portfolio in the hands of 
experts with whom you can confer. To get a diversified, balanced portfo-
lio, you need a multiple-style SMA. Here are two approaches:
 
• You hire an account manager who serves as the general contrac-
tor and then hires subaccount managers, each with his or her own 
style and sector expertise. This type of multiple-style managed 
account often requires higher minimum investments (perhaps in 
the $250,000 category) to achieve proper diversification.
 
• You find a single account manager who offers a broad-based, diver-
sified portfolio of varying asset classes.
Invest in SMAs Wisely
If you think SMAs may be a viable investment option, do the following:
 
 Define your investment goals and guidelines (see Strategy #13).
 
 Compare SMA investing to ETF or mutual fund investing to make sure 
SMAs are the right choice for you. (In other words, do you need a 
custom tailored suit, or will off-the-rack suit you fine?)
 
 Conduct due diligence to find the right managers for you. Be sure to 
review Form ADV Schedule H. This form, which is required for all man-
aged accounts, describes the SMAs objectives and expenses.
 
 If you search hard, you can find lower cost alternatives to traditional 
SMAs by hiring asset managers that use very low cost, no-load mutual 
funds and/or ETFs in the portfolio instead of individual stocks. These 
managers may charge a fee of 0.25 to 0.50 percent for their services. 
When combined with the expense ratios of the individual holdings in the 
portfolio, the total overall management fee could still remain well under 
1.0 percent.
 
 Regularly monitor the performance of your investment managers to 
confirm they’re continuing to meet your objectives and are providing 
benefits in excess of their fees.
 
Although you can direct the account manger to make changes to your SMA, 
second guessing or micromanaging the investment decisions isn’t a good idea. 
After all, you’re paying for the managers’ expertise with the assumption that 
they can produce better results than you. Agree on the investment strategy 
upfront and indentify any constraints you have. Then let the account manager 
make future decisions within those parameters.

Invest in Individual Stocks
By Herb Montgomery, CFP
I
nvesting in individual stocks can be fun and profitable, but it’s not a walk 
in the park. It also exposes you to higher risks. Start out small, don’t 
invest more than you can lose, and research!
Do Some Serious Soul-Searching
If you’re going to take the plunge and begin investing in individual stocks, a 
question-and-answer period with yourself is in order. Write down the ques-
tions as well as the answers to avoid any finger-pointing if things don’t go as 
planned.
Are you willing to be an investor rather 
than a trader?
An investor purchases shares in a company that he or she knows something 
about and plans to hold these shares to reap the benefits of a successful 
company. An investor expects both long-term growth in share value as well 
as the payment of dividends along the way. A trader buys shares of stock in 
a company, expecting the price of the stock to rise rapidly so he or she can 
cash out with a quick gain.
 
Historically, investors are more successful than traders over long periods of 
time. An investor isn’t hit with short-term capital gains, trading commissions, 
and most importantly, the inability to successfully time the market. Investing 
on a whim or a hot tip isn’t investing; it’s gambling. Save the gambling for casi-
nos, not your brokerage account.
Investors also need discipline, which includes a systematic approach to 
taking profits and realizing losses. Don’t get caught up in the emotion of 
the moment. Don’t fall so in love with a stock on the rise that you refuse to 
sell when it starts to drop. Be willing to admit your mistakes and sell a loser 
before it becomes next to worthless. Remember some of the darling stocks 
of the past that plunged rapidly while their investors stubbornly held on to 
them.

113
 #26: Invest in Individual Stocks
How much money are you willing to lose?
Yes, it’s possible to lose every cent you put into the stock market! If you have 
a certain amount of cash that you’re willing to risk losing completely, identify 
the amount, write it down, and don’t exceed it.
Also remember the importance of diversification. One argument for invest-
ing through mutual funds is that mutual funds can pool money and purchase 
a wide variety of stocks or bonds. You need to invest in a wide variety of 
stocks as well. Avoid having more than 10 percent of your total portfolio in 
any one stock. Also avoid buying too many similar stocks. If you own only 
technology stocks, for example, and technology goes through a rough patch, 
like it did in 2001 and 2002, you could lose most of your investment. If you 
can’t diversify sufficiently, consider mutual funds. See Strategies #41 through 
#46 for more on diversification.
How much time and money can you 
commit to research?
A full-time job, spouse, children, elderly parent, house, and yard may all com-
pete for your time. Because the time spent researching companies directly 
affects your success in the stock market, be sure you realize that time spent 
researching is time taken from your other activities.
If you think you can pick a winning stock, good luck. People choose good 
stocks all the time, but the good choices are usually the result of good, thor-
ough research. Note that even full-time professionals choose stinkers — think 
Enron, Lucent, and MCI. The stinkers are often impulse buys or just changing 
markets.
Research Before and After You Invest
If you’re still convinced that buying individual stocks is for you, here’s how 
to approach the work required. Assuming you have the time to do all the 
research, this section guides you in choosing companies and stocks to invest 
in and then managing those investments.
Spend some time with annual reports
You need to think about the following characteristics of the companies 
you’re interested in:

114
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts throughout the Economic Cycle 
 
 Free cash flow: What’s left after the bills are paid
 
 Returns on equity: How much the company made on the money 
invested in it
 
 Returns on assets: How much the company made by using the assets it 
owns
 
 Net margins: How much the company made from every dollar of sales
Each of these items is readily available in the financial results section of the 
company’s annual report. Of course, this type of research isn’t for the faint of 
heart or the easily distracted. Never attempt to read an annual report while 
driving or operating heavy machinery!
These days, annual and quarterly reports are available on every company 
Web site. Or you can call a company’s headquarters and someone there will 
be happy to mail you an annual report. But don’t get carried away by the 
pretty pictures. Look closely at the financials. Identifying trends is impor-
tant. Have the returns on equity been growing for the past few years? Are net 
margins consistently growing? Be sure to check the footnotes to make sure a 
growth spurt (or loss) wasn’t caused by a one-time factor. Note: One year of 
great financials following several years of poor financials isn’t necessarily a 
trend.
Follow some general research advice
Here are rules to consider when doing your own research:
 
 Use an independent research firm, someone with absolutely no financial 
interest in any of the companies under consideration for investment.
 
 Look at the competition. Who’s growing faster? Who has better finan-
cials? Who has more new products in the pipeline?
 
 Calculate how much the company is worth. Buy a stock only if you can 
get it at discount to its fair value; you need some wiggle room if the 
stock price begins to slide.
 
 Pick companies for the long term. Remember that you’re an investor, 
not a trader. Look for companies with solid financials and good growth 
prospects for the next five to ten years. Traders are hoping for that one 
big inning. Investors are looking for a championship.
 
 Sell at the right time. The right time depends on the company. If the fun-
damentals have changed and you probably wouldn’t purchase the stock 
presently, it’s time to sell. Perhaps the stock has performed well, but its 
price is now too high to justify further growth. Or maybe there’s been a 
change in the economy and the company’s products aren’t as desirable 

115
 #26: Invest in Individual Stocks
as they once were, or maybe competition has stepped in. Any of these 
factors could trigger a sale. However, if all the reasons you purchased 
the stock in the first place still apply, keep it. Sometimes even the best 
companies experience temporary setbacks.
 
Don’t let any one stock position grow to more than 10 to 12 percent of your 
entire portfolio.
Know where to find good information
There are numerous free and paid services that can be useful when you’re 
trying to decide whether a company is suitable to invest in at a given point 
in time. Are these sources always right? No, but if you’re not willing or lack 
the time to do the research, their picks will undoubtedly be better than just 
shooting from the hip. Here are some sources:
 
 Your brokerage account, whether it’s with a wire house or discount 
broker, has several offerings, either paid services or free with your 
account. Many have stock screens where you enter your criteria and 
eliminate companies that don’t interest you.
 
 Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) has mountains of information 
about companies — and best of all, it’s free.
 
 Standard & Poor’s (www.standardandpoors.com) is one of the major 
independent research firms that provides accurate, unbiased informa-
tion to the public. Many good brokerage firms provide S&P’s analyst 
reports to compare opinions with the brokerage’s own analysts.
 
 Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) is a favorite research site for 
professionals as well as do-it-yourselfers. Their free site is a good place 
to start, though the Premium Membership (which is quite reasonable) 
gets you into the screens and more in-depth analysis. They also have 
several different newsletters both in print and online.
“Expert stock pickers” also put out paid newsletters. Some of them have 
pretty good track records; some are legends only in their own minds. Most of 
them probably generate more income from selling newsletters then they do 
from picking successful stocks. (If they’re so good at picking stocks, why do 
they need to sell newsletters?)
The Five Rules For Successful Stock Investing, by Pat Dorsey, Director of Stock 
Analysis at Morningstar (Wiley), and The Ultimate Dividend Playbook, by Josh 
Peters, CFA Editor of Morningstar Dividend Investor (Wiley), may be helpful 
in both your research and your individual stock selection.

Invest in Individual Bonds
By John Vyge, CFP
I
n uncertain times, reducing the volatility of your investment portfolio 
should be your top priority. Adding individual bonds to your portfolio is a 
great way to minimize volatility. Although stocks and stock mutual funds can 
fluctuate wildly every time a TV commentator announces “what’s going to 
happen next,” individual bonds can be your portfolio’s Rock of Gibraltar.
Understand Bond Basics
A bond is a debt obligation from an issuer, usually a government or corpora-
tion. Governments and corporations issue bonds to raise money to build 
bridges, schools, hospitals, and new factories. They’re borrowing money from 
you, the bond investor. If you hold an individual bond until it matures, you’ll 
receive the face value of the bond along with fixed interest payments — as long 
as the issuer doesn’t default.
The less likely the borrower is to default on payments to you, the less risky 
the bond; and the less risky the bond, the lower the interest rate the bor-
rower is willing to pay you. In the case of corporate bonds, usually the riski-
est of all bonds, bond holders still have priority over the shareholders of the 
company. In other words, if a company goes out of business, any assets of 
the company are used up in the following order:
 
1. Creditors
 
2. Bond holders
 
3. Preferred stock holders
 
4. Common stock holders
Bond types
Bonds are issues by local, state, and federal governments; government agen-
cies; and corporations. You can typically invest in the types of bonds shown 
in Table 27-1. (See Strategy #18 for more about Treasury and agency bonds.)

117
 # 27: Invest in Individual Bonds
Table 27-1 
Bond Types and Risks
Bond Type

Treasury
U.S. government
They pay interest semiannually and are 
considered to be credit-risk free.
Agency
Government-
sponsored entities 
such as FNMA, 
GNMA, and FHLM
They pay a slightly higher return than 
Treasuries because they’re not quite as 
secure and may fluctuate more in value.
Municipal 
($5,000 
minimum 
investment)
State and local 
governments
They pay lower interest rates but are 
generally tax-exempt, so the after-tax 
return is attractive to many investors. 
The two main types are general obliga-
tion bonds and revenue bonds; general 
obligation bonds are safer than revenue 
bonds but often pay a lower interest rate.
Corporate 
($1,000 
minimum 
investment)
Corporations, to 
pay for corporate 
projects
They attract investors who seek the 
higher yields in exchange for a higher 
risk of default.
Some corporate, municipal, and government agency bonds offer additional 
risk in that they can be called, or redeemed, by the issuer at full face value 
prior to the due date. You therefore miss out on some interest payments.
 
So how do you decide which type of bond to hold? In a nutshell, if you’re look-
ing for the highest level of security, Treasury bonds are for you. Need a tax 
break? Municipal bonds are exempt from federal tax and can be exempt from 
state and local tax if you reside where the bonds are issued. Looking for the 
highest income? Corporate bonds are usually your best bet.
Your return on investment: Yields, 
yields, and more yields
Why buy a bond when you can just put your money into a savings account or 
money market account? Well, savings account interest can fluctuate up and 
down, but bond interest is fixed. Here are four ways of looking at the return 
you get from a bond:

118
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle 
 
 Coupon interest: Bonds pay you a stream of periodic interest payments, 
called coupons, semiannually.
 
 Current yield: The return you get paid annually, in the form of coupons, 
based on the initial price you paid for the bond, is called the current 
yield.
 
 Face value: Face value, or par, is the dollar amount that’ll be returned to 
you when your bond matures. Most bonds are issued with a face value 
of $1,000. However, you may purchase a bond for more or less than its 
face value. The bond matures at face value, so any extra premium you 
paid reduces your yield to maturity; but if you purchased the bond at a 
discount, your yield to maturity is higher than the coupon rate.
 
 Yield to maturity (YTM): YTM is the actual rate of return you receive on 
a bond investment, if you hold the bond until it matures.
 
You need to be earning a yield that’s higher than inflation. To combat infla-
tion, the Treasury now offers ten-year Treasury inflation-protected securities 
(TIPS). In exchange for a lower coupon interest payment, the face value of 
a TIPS bond gets adjusted semiannually to reflect inflation. Indirectly, this 
adjustment actually increases your coupon payment because the coupon itself 
is based on the inflation-adjusted face value.
Tax treatment
Tax treatment varies, depending on the type of bond:
 
 Treasury and agency bond interest is subject to ordinary federal income 
tax but is exempt from state and local taxes.
 
 Municipal bond interest is generally exempt from federal tax, though 
certain types of municipal bonds, such as passive activity bonds, can trig-
ger the dreaded alternative minimum tax.
 
 Residents of the state where the bond is issued can avoid state and local 
taxes. Check your state for specific tax implications.
 
 Income from corporate bonds is taxed as ordinary income.
 
Pay attention to taxes when choosing bonds. Municipal bonds should never 
be in an IRA because they’re already tax exempt; instead, use corporate bonds 
because of their higher taxable yield. If you’re in a very high tax bracket, 
arrange the overall portfolio so that most of the corporate bonds and other 
high-yielding securities are inside tax-sheltered accounts, such as employer 
sponsored retirement plans and IRAs, while keeping municipal bonds and 
stocks in the taxable accounts.

 # 27: Invest in Individual Bonds
Climb the Bond Ladder in 
Uncertain Times
When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; and when interest rates fall, bond 
prices rise. Longer term bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes, 
but as a bond maturity date gets closer, it fluctuates less in price.
 
Changes in interest rates can wreak havoc on the value of your bonds. 
Furthermore, tying your money up for long periods of time at one interest rate 
means you may miss out on higher interest rates in a rising interest rate envi-
ronment. One strategy to combat this problem is to use a bond ladder, which 
consists of short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term bonds. As each indi-
vidual bond matures, you invest the cash you receive from the maturing bond 
into new long-term bonds or the highest-yielding bonds available at the time.
Buying bonds
Bonds are available individually through discount brokers, full service bro-
kers, and bond brokers (companies that specialize in individual bonds). Each 
of these providers can design an individual bond portfolio to meet your 
needs. Just call their fixed income department.
To build a diversified bond portfolio, you should probably have at least 
$50,000 to start. Otherwise, stick with a low-cost bond fund from a discount 
broker. For more on building a diversified bond portfolio, see Strategy #46.
Comparing yields: A not-so-taxing endeavor
When you buy a municipal bond, the promised 
yield is often lower than that of other types of 
bonds. That’s because in exchange for a lower 
yield, you don’t have to pay federal tax on the 
interest you receive. So how can you compare 
the yield on a municipal bond to that of another 
bond? You have to calculate something called 
the tax equivalent yield (TEY):
 
 TEY = municipal yield ÷ (1 – your marginal 
tax rate)
(Note: Check your tax return for your marginal 
tax rate.) The result in this formula is a number 
that you can use to compare municipal bonds 
to other bonds that are subject to federal taxes, 
such as Treasury, agency, and corporate 
bonds.

120
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle 
For commission-free trades, you can purchase U.S. Treasury bonds directly 
from the government (www.treasurydirect.gov).
Reviewing bond ratings
Just as you get a personal credit rating, municipal and corporate bonds are 
rated, too. Bond rating services, such as S&P and Moody’s, analyze and rate 
the financial security of the issuing company or agency. Even though bond 
ratings can be wrong (even some of Enron’s bond ratings were investment 
grade in the months leading up to its collapse), they’re a starting point. 
Choose from two categories of bonds:
 
 Investment grade bonds: Bonds rated at this level have a relatively low 
risk of default. S&P rates investment grade bonds at BBB or higher, and 
Moody’s uses Baa or higher.
 
 Speculative grade bonds: Bonds rated at this level have a relatively high 
risk of default. They’re also called junk bonds. S&P uses BB or lower, 
and Moody’s uses Ba or lower.
Treasury bonds aren’t rated (they’re assumed to have no risk of default), and 
agencies generally receive the highest rating available.
 
If a bond’s rating is changed for the worse due to the profitability or credit rating 
of the company, the bond’s market value may go down. This doesn’t change the 
amount you’ll receive if you hold the bond to maturity or the amount of interest 
you’re paid because these amounts are based on the face value of the bond, but 
it can be a problem if you need to sell the bond prematurely.

Hedge with Options
By Gigi Turbow Marx, MBA
H
ow many times have you heard the mantra that stocks outperform all 
other assets in the long term? Unfortunately, many retiree wannabes 
are finding out the hard way that the long term can be really long.
The most important reason to hedge is that waiting for the long term isn’t 
always an option. Investment success comes from careful risk management, 
which means minimizing losses, not from being a genius stock picker. Broad 
diversification among asset classes should be your first line of risk manage-
ment defense (see Strategy #40). But hedging provides you with a Plan B, and 
having a back-up plan is definitely the best plan in uncertain times! The strat-
egy explains how to use options to hedge.
Know the Options Basics
Options are a derivative product. Very simply, that means their value is 
derived from something else. If you buy or sell options on an asset such as a 
stock or exchange-traded fund (defined as the underlying asset), the price of 
the option is going to move with that stock or index in a fairly well-defined 
relationship. That relationship allows you to use options to track price 
changes in the underlying asset for a fraction of the cost.
Understand how options work
Here are some useful options-related terms you should be familiar with:
 
 Premium: The premium is the price of the option.
 
 Strike (exercise) price: This is price at which you agree to buy or sell 
the underlying asset if the option is exercised.
 
 Expiration: The date on which the option ceases to exist; all rights and 
obligations conferred by the option contract terminate when the option 
expires.
 
 Contract size: One contract is equal to 100 shares of the underlying 
asset.

122
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle 
Any options contract gives rights to the buyer and commits the seller to 
obligations. Options also come in two varieties, calls and puts, depending on 
whether the buyer wants the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset. 
Table 28-1 shows how these rights and obligations break down.
Table 28-1 
Rights and Obligations of Options Contracts
Buyer or Seller of the 
Option
Calls
Puts
Option holder (buyer)
By buying a call option, 
the holder purchases 
the right to buy the 
underlying asset at the 
strike price.
By buying a put option, 
the holder purchases the 
right to sell the underlying 
asset at the strike price.
Option writer (seller)
By selling a call option, 
the writer commits to 
selling the underly-
ing asset at the strike 
price.
By selling a put option, the 
writer commits to buying 
the underlying asset at the 
strike price.
 
Perhaps the single most important concept for you to master about options is 
the following one: Options have a limited life.
Unlike your core portfolio holdings, options expire, and when they do, they 
no longer have value and no longer exist. That may actually be your goal. If 
it’s not, you can liquidate an option position or roll it over to another strike 
price or another time period. The important point is that you must do it 
before the expiration. This underscores the point that hedging requires an 
economic point of view and active oversight.
Look at how you can use options to hedge
You can use options for the following reasons:
 
 To protect your portfolio 
 
 To generate additional income
 
 For speculation/leverage
A 2008 Charles Schwab study of options trading found that, contrary to 
popular perception, only one in four traders surveyed indicated market 
speculation was their leading reason to trade options. Three-quarters of the 
respondents used options with the goal of generating income or hedging for 
risk management.

123
 #28: Hedge with Options
Okay, but how do you actually use this stuff? In this limited space, I can 
barely scratch the surface of useful ways to apply options, but the follow-
ing example may give you some ideas. Consider the unpleasant situation in 
which one of your ETFs has fallen 20 percent over the past year. In theory, 
you know that you should try to buy more to reduce your average cost and 
rebalance your holdings. In reality, you have little cash and even less stom-
ach for further losses.
If you have only $5,000, you could use the whole amount to buy 50 shares of 
your now-$100 stock today. Alternatively, you could purchase call options — 
the right to buy that stock — for less money and buy yourself some time to 
see whether the situation worsens or improves before you commit to buying 
more stock.
Say you already own 400 shares. You decide to buy four call contracts at a $95 
strike price to reduce your cost basis more effectively. You see that you can 
buy options that expire in four months for a premium cost of $7 a share, cost-
ing a total of $2,800 ($7 per share × 100 shares per contract × 4 contracts).
If your analysis is correct and the stock recovers to $105, you’ve locked in 
the right to buy up to 400 shares at a cost of the strike price ($95) plus the 
premium ($7), or $102 per share in total — $3 less than market price.
But what if you really want to add only 50 shares to your position? By selling 
350 shares in the stock market at $105 and exercising your contracts to buy 
400 shares, you’ll get your 50 shares. You’ll also get a $1,050 gain on the stock 
you don’t want to keep ($3 × 350)! That’s a gain you can use to replenish your 
cash account or to repair another investment. (And that’s why they call them 
options, Virginia!)
What if your analysis is wrong and the stock keeps dropping? Again, the 
value of your options will move in tandem with the underlying asset — that 
is, down. But you’ve limited the potential loss on your investment strategy 
because you can’t lose more than the ($2,800) premium you paid, and you’ve 
still got some cash left to consider a new strategy.
Do Your Homework
Options trading is a game of strategy similar to competitive chess or sports. 
It’s versatile but complex, so make sure you do your homework and research 
the risks and returns of any strategy you want to pursue.

Start with the Options Industry Council (OIC) Web site (www.888options.
com): The council is comprised of all the U.S. options exchanges plus the 
Options Clearing Corporation. It has a vested interest in protecting the good 
reputation of its market, and that means it has a vested interest in protecting 
you, the investor.
 
You’ve probably seen those car ads where they warn “Professional driver 
on a closed track: Do not attempt.” If you’re an aspiring do-it-yourselfer, 
use the Options Industry Council’s (OIC’s) version of a closed track 
(www.888options.com) — they offer a virtual trading tool that allows you to 
practice with electronic money before you put real money at risk!
One visit to the OIC Web site should convince you that you don’t need to pay 
lots of money for an options newsletter. The resources available through the 
OIC are comprehensive, approved by regulated compliance departments, and 
free of charge.
 
Newsletter vendors, whether covering options or any other investment, aren’t 
regulated. They can consequently make all sorts of ungrounded claims about 
potential investment returns without fear of scrutiny or sanctions. Until you 
know enough to evaluate which newsletters are reputable, stick with the OIC 
for education and a registered investment advisor or SEC-regulated broker 
dealer for implementation.
Take Your First Steps
You may be shocked to discover that you can’t just decide that you’d like 
to try a little options trading one day and go place an order. You first have 
to apply to your brokerage firm for trading authorization. There are mul-
tiple levels of authorization, and you have to graduate through the ranks. 
Demonstrate financial capacity and reasonable care at conservative strate-
gies, and they’ll approve you for more complex strategies. Believe me — 
they’re doing you a favor because they’ve seen the roadkill. Here are some 
other important rules of the road for novices:
 
 Start with the asset or market you understand best. Options trading is 
complex, so make sure you’re familiar with the underlying assets.
 
 Start small. Just because you have $5,000 doesn’t mean you should 
spend it all in one place! Options provide a lot of leverage for a wee bit 
of cash, but it works in both directions — gains and losses.

Invest in Commodities
By Robert Friedland, PhD
A
ny resource whose quality is easily measured can be, and most likely is, 
a commodity. Common commodities include the following:
 
 Nonrenewable energy such as oil or natural gas
 
 Agricultural products such as cocoa, coffee, corn, cotton, orange juice, 
soybeans, sugar, and wheat
 
 Livestock such as cattle or hogs
 
 Timber
 
 Metals such as copper, gold, nickel, platinum, silver, and zinc
Commodity values have cycles different from those of stocks and bonds. 
They also provide protection from inflation, particularly unexpected infla-
tion. Unexpected or accelerating inflation tends to reduce the value of stocks 
and bonds. But when the primary source of this inflation is the cost of raw 
inputs — that is, commodities — the value of commodities also rises.
Although commodities themselves are traded in both local and global mar-
kets, the global trading of commodity derivatives plays a huge role in com-
modity pricing. Derivative is a fancy name for a contract that derives its 
value from something tangible. Common types of derivatives are futures con-
tracts, forwards contracts, options contracts (see Strategy #28), and swaps. 
(For more information on derivatives, see the latest edition of Investing For 
Dummies, by Eric Tyson [Wiley].) Although handling a contract is less smelly 
than handling a pork belly, the real purpose of derivatives is to reduce busi-
ness risk.
When you buy stock, you’re buying part of a company. When you buy a bond, 
you’re buying part of the debt issued by that company or government. When 
you buy a commodity, you’re buying the raw input into the production of 
everything that’s produced. Including commodities in your portfolio enables 
you to diversify your risks in a unique way. You can share in the growth of 
the global economy and hedge against inflation.

Lock in a Price with 
Commodities Futures
Commodities markets are essential for those who grow, raise, or extract com-
modities and for businesses that use these resources in their production. For 
instance, a farmer decides which crops and/or livestock to raise, in part, by 
comparing anticipated costs to expected market prices. Although the farmer 
can reasonably estimate production costs in advance, he or she has no way 
of knowing what the sale price of the crop will be at harvest. Buying a futures 
contract allows the farmer to get someone to commit to a purchase price 
well ahead of time.
How do commodities futures work?
A futures contract is an obligation to either sell or buy a particular commodity 
at a specific price on a specific day. For instance, a farmer can go to the com-
modities exchange and purchase a contract to sell wheat at a specific price 
and date in the future. This contract reflects both the farmer’s willingness to 
deliver the wheat at a specific price and the willingness of a buyer to pay that 
price. A likely buyer is a company that mills wheat into flour. The company 
needs to plan its production and market the flour to its customers, such as 
bakeries, so the company wants to lock in the price it’ll pay for the wheat it’ll 
need in the future.
If, by the time the crop comes to harvest, the market price (spot price) is 
lower than the contractual price, the farmer will be glad he or she entered 
into this contract. The miller, however, won’t be so happy, because that com-
pany will be obligated to buy the wheat for more than the market price.
This contract eliminates some risks to each business, but the derivatives 
market helps further. If the miller can anticipate a drop in the wheat price 
below the contractual price, it’ll try to sell its contract ahead of time. If, on the 
other hand, the market price for this crop turns out to be higher than the con-
tractual price, the tables turn and now the farmer may try to sell the contract 
in advance. However, the miller and the farmer wouldn’t be able to find buyers 
without a larger marketplace. This is where investors like you come in.
Most commodity investors aren’t interested in or capable of taking posses-
sion of or delivering the commodity. After all, where would you store 20 tons 
of frozen trimmed pork bellies or 1,000 barrels of crude oil or 25,000 pounds 
of copper? Investors are, however, interested in making a profit, and they 

127
 #29: Invest in Commodities
consider a variety of factors when deciding how much to pay the farmer or 
miller for the contract. The investor makes judgments concerning weather, 
infectious disease, accidents, fire, supply, political changes (such as nation-
alization, revolution, or democratization), currency exchange rates, and the 
actions of other buyers and sellers. Successful commodity investors have to 
make buy/sell decisions based on all these factors and perhaps more.
Why invest in commodities?
Assume that a barrel of sweet grade light crude oil is $150. What if you pur-
chased a contract six months ago for $25,000, allowing you to buy 1,000 bar-
rels of oil for $50 per barrel today? You could use this contract to purchase 
the oil for $50,000 and turn around and sell it for $150,000, pocketing $75,000 
($100,000 minus the contract price of $25,000 — before taxes, shipping, han-
dling, and storage charges). Moreover, if you were savvy enough to have 
used your margin account, you may have used only $12,500 of your own 
money to increase your wealth by $75,000 for just one contract. Not bad!
You probably don’t want to take delivery of the oil, but someone in the 
market does, and that person would be willing to pay you for your contract 
to get the better oil price. The closer you get to the contract date, the more 
likely someone will be willing to pay close to $100,000 for your contract.
How to Invest in Commodities
You can invest in commodities in multiple ways:
 
 Purchase or sell futures contracts. This is the purest way to gain expo-
sure but volatility can be high. (See the preceding sections for details on 
futures contracts.) Some investors try to mitigate some of this volatility 
by buying and selling commodity futures indexes, which bundle related 
commodities.
 
 Buy shares in royalty trusts, which are special trusts that receive 
income or profits from the commodity. These trusts can pay high 
dividends, particularly because the trusts don’t pay corporate income 
taxes. The trust also offers tax advantages by distributing proportionate 
shares of its depreciation and depletion allowances.
 
 Buy commodities through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds 
(ETFs). These funds often have different investment strategies, so be 
sure to read and understand the prospectus before investing. Using a 
mutual fund (see Strategy #21) gives you professional investment man-
agers, dramatically increases your diversification for a small price, and 
gives you the convenience of one mutual fund purchase rather than an 
array of futures contracts.

128
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
 
 ETFs (see Strategy #23) have similar advantages but are more likely to 
simply mirror a particular index of commodity futures. As a result, the 
ETF’s management costs may be less than those of a mutual fund. ETFs, 
however, can be traded just like stocks.
 
 Buy traditional stocks or bonds of companies in the business of growing, 
raising, or extracting a commodity. A popular approach is to purchase 
shares in a mutual fund or ETF — often called a specialty fund — that 
focuses on companies that fit a particular commodities theme. But holding 
the stock of a group of companies in a specialty fund isn’t the same as pur-
chasing the commodity. Odds are the company stock will move in concert 
with the rest of the stock market and, depending on what else the company 
does or owns, won’t be a strong hedge against inflation.
 
Although you want exposure to commodities, this exposure — either pure 
or indirect — should be a relatively small share of your investment portfolio. 
Don’t invest in commodity futures, or index-commodity futures, unless you’re 
willing to invest the time and effort to study and follow that specific commod-
ity market closely.

Consider Short-Selling
By Neil Vannoy, MBA
A
s of this writing, General Motors stock has fallen to levels not seen 
since the mid-1950s. More than half of the company’s value was lost in 
the first six months of 2008 alone. What does this mean to you? It means that 
if you hold GM stock, you’ve probably lost money — even if you’ve held the 
stock for 50 years!
Maybe you saw it coming, so you sold all your GM stock. Selling would have 
kept you from losing money, but what if you wanted to make money instead 
of just protecting yourself from losses? After all, what happened to GM could 
happen to another company, especially during difficult economic times. 
Short-selling is a strategy that can help you make money when a company, or 
the economy as a whole, faces uncertain economic times.
Sell High and Buy Low for 
Fun and Profit
Short-selling involves selling a stock you don’t actually own in order to profit 
from a decline in price. So when you short a stock, you want the value to drop.
When you short a stock, you borrow shares from your broker through a 
margin account and immediately sell them on the open market. The proceeds 
are then deposited into your account.
Eventually you repurchase the shares and return them to your broker to 
close out the short position. Your goal is to pay less to buy back the shares 
than you received from selling them. If you do, you get to keep the difference! 
Here’s an example:
 
1. XYZ stock is trading at $25 per share. You think the true value is around 
$15 per share. You decide to speculate that the price of XYZ will decline, 
so you sell short 100 shares of XYZ stock at $25 per share.
 
2. Your broker loans you 100 shares, you sell them on the open market, 
and the $2,500 in proceeds is deposited into your account. (100 shares × 
$25 per share = $2,500).

130
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
 
3. Two weeks later, XYZ stock declines to $19 per share. You purchase 100 
shares to return to your broker at $19 per share.
Your profit from the transaction is $600. ($2,500 from the sale of XYZ – $1,900 
to repurchase XYZ).
 
This example doesn’t account for the commissions and fees that apply in the 
real world!
You don’t necessarily need to master short-selling yourself to incorporate a 
short-selling strategy in your portfolio. Some mutual funds, called long-short 
funds, use short-selling as a part of their active strategy. Walk carefully with 
these funds though. Make sure you understand and are comfortable with 
both the strategy and fees.
Now for the Bad News: It’s Not So Easy
Sounds easy, right? Well, before you start short-selling your way to untold 
fortunes, there are a few things you should know.
 
Short-selling is a speculative strategy with significant risks and may not be 
appropriate for most investors.
History shows that stocks appreciate
Using history as a guide, the long-term trend for stocks is positive. Although 
the market drops or trades sideways (moves up and down within a limited 
range) at times, stocks have appreciated more than any other asset classes 
over long time periods. Although you have no guarantee that this trend will 
continue, be aware that short-selling involves going against this powerful 
trend!
You risk unlimited loss for a limited gain
The potential gain from short-selling is limited to the cash you receive from 
selling the stock, while the potential loss is unlimited. Recall the $2,500 you 
received from selling XYZ in the example earlier in this strategy. The most 
you could make from the transaction is $2,500, but XYZ would have to go 
bankrupt for you to be able to keep the entire amount.
But what happens if the price of XYZ stock begins to skyrocket after you sell 
the shares short? You’re responsible for purchasing the 100 shares of XYZ 
stock to close the short position no matter what the price!

131
 #30: Consider Short-Selling
Although an unlimited loss is really possible only in theory, be aware that the 
price could easily double or triple before you have the chance to repurchase 
the shares. This is especially true for stocks of small companies, or stocks 
that are thinly traded (which means they don’t have a high volume of shares 
that are regularly traded).
In this scenario, if the price of XYZ stock doubles after you sell short, you 
have to buy back 100 shares at $50 per share. You spend $5,000 to buy the 
same stock you sold for $2,500. You lose $2,500 and that’s before you add in 
commission fees and the interest you have to pay for the period of time until 
you close the short position.
You pay interest on losses
A margin account is required for short-selling (see Strategy #31 for more 
information about margin accounts). If you sell a stock short, and the price 
of that stock begins to increase, your broker will move money from the cash 
balance of your account to cover the losses. A margin balance will be created 
if you don’t have sufficient cash to cover the position, and you’ll begin to 
accrue interest charges on the margin balance. So you could not only suffer 
a loss from your short position, but also end up paying interest for the privi-
lege of losing money!
Learn the Lingo
This section covers the lingo you’ll need to know if you dabble in short-sell-
ing or if you just want to impress your friends at cocktail parties!
Selling, shorting, selling short, going short, short
These terms are used somewhat interchangeably to describe an investor 
who’s engaged in short-selling. Selling, shorting, selling short, and going short 
are used before an investment position is established, and short is used to 
describe the position after the fact. (Note that buying, going long, and long are 
the opposite of these terms.)
Again, assume you think XYZ is overvalued. You could say you’re considering 
“selling XYZ,” “shorting XYZ,” “selling XYZ short,” or “going short XYZ.” After 
you establish a short position in XYZ, you simply say you’re “short XYZ.”
Bull and bear markets
The terms bull market and bear market are most commonly used to describe 
the stock market, but they can be used to describe any investment market 
(such as the bond market, commodity market, or currency market). Security 
prices in bull markets are increasing or expected to increase; prices are falling 

132
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
or expected to fall in bear markets. Likewise, a bull is an investor who thinks a 
market will rise. A bear is an investor who thinks a market will fall. Short-sellers 
are considered bearish because they expect the price of the security to fall.
Short interest
Short interest refers to a specific security’s total number of shares that have 
been sold short. When short interest increases, many investors believe it’s 
a bearish indicator. For example, if the short interest in XYZ stock increases 
from 2 percent to 6 percent of outstanding shares, it would appear that more 
investors are expecting the price of XYZ to fall.
Covering
Investors who sell a security short eventually have to cover, or buy back, 
their position. For example, if you short 100 shares of XYZ stock, you later 
cover the position by purchasing 100 shares.
Short squeeze
No, this has nothing to do with getting pinched on a crowded subway! A short 
squeeze occurs when a rapid increase in the price of a stock leads short-
sellers to cover their positions. This increased demand, combined with a lack 
of supply, causes the price of the stock to continue upward, compelling more 
and more short-sellers to cover their positions.
Days to cover (short interest ratio)
Days to cover (also known as short interest ratio) gives you an idea of the 
future buying pressure on a stock from short-sellers who will eventually have 
to cover their positions. This ratio measures the short interest in a stock rela-
tive to its average daily volume (the average number of shares that exchange 
hands in a day). The longer the days to cover for a security, the greater the 
chance of a short squeeze. The formula for days to cover is:
Days to cover = current short interest ÷ average daily share volume
Called away
A short position is established by using borrowed shares of a security, 
and your broker retains the right to redeem these shares at any time. If the 
original owner redeems the shares, and your broker can’t find replacement 
shares, you may have the shares called away from you. This means you have 
to cover your position immediately, regardless of market price.

Use Caution When 
Buying on Margin
By Neil Vannoy, MBA
B
uying on margin is similar to buying a home. In home-buying, borrow-
ing money increases your purchasing power and allows you to buy a 
larger home than you could otherwise afford. Margin is basically a loan from 
your brokerage firm, and buying on margin allows you to purchase more of a 
security — such as a stock or a bond — than you could on your own.
Know How It Works: Everything’s 
Bigger with Margin
Investors buy on margin to increase their returns. Because margin gives you the 
ability to buy more stock with less money, an increase in the price of the stock 
leads to a larger gain than if you hadn’t used margin. Here’s an example: Assume 
you pay cash for stock worth $5,000 and that stock appreciates to $5,500. That 
represents a 10-percent return on your $5,000 investment. Not bad. Now assume 
you make the same investment by using $2,500 of your money and $2,500 that 
you borrow from your brokerage firm. The same $500 appreciation would be a 
20-percent return on your $2,500 investment ($500 gain ÷ $2,500 investment = 20 
percent). Much better! But keep in mind that you have to pay interest to your 
brokerage firm for the privilege of borrowing its money.
 
Be aware that margin is a double-edged sword. Buying stocks on margin is 
great when prices go up, but remember that stocks don’t always appreciate. 
Any loss on a stock purchased on margin is magnified just like gains are mag-
nified. Buying on margin in a volatile market is risky!
Understand the Details
To buy securities with borrowed money, you need a margin account at your 
brokerage firm.

134
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts throughout the Economic Cycle
Minimum and initial margin
Before trading on margin, you have to meet margin requirements set by the 
Federal Reserve Board (the Fed), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 
(FINRA), and your brokerage company. The Fed and FINRA establish the mini-
mums, but your brokerage company can have stricter requirements.
Minimum margin is the minimum deposit required to open a margin account, 
and it’s the lesser of $2,000 or 100 percent of the purchase price. Initial 
margin is the maximum amount your brokerage firm can lend to you to pur-
chase securities, and it’s currently 50 percent of the purchase price. You can 
meet the minimum and initial margin requirements by depositing cash or 
securities into your margin account.
For example, assume you want to purchase $3,600 of ABC stock on margin. 
You’re required to deposit $2,000 into the account, and your brokerage firm 
loans you $1,600 ($3,600 purchase price – $2,000 minimum margin = $1,600 
margin loan).
Maintenance margin
After you purchase a security, the Fed, FINRA, and your brokerage firm 
require you to keep a minimum amount of equity in your account. This is 
called the maintenance margin. The minimum maintenance margin is 25 per-
cent of the total value of the securities in your margin account, but your bro-
kerage firm may have higher minimums, especially for risky securities. You 
can meet the maintenance margin requirement by depositing cash or securi-
ties into your margin account.
For example, assume you purchase $10,000 of XYZ stock on margin by depos-
iting $5,000 in cash into your account and borrowing $5,000 on margin. Your 
equity in the account is $5,000 ($10,000 market value of XYZ – $5,000 margin 
loan = $5,000 equity). If the value of XYZ falls to $8,000, the equity in your 
account falls to $3,000 ($8,000 market value of XYZ – $5,000 margin loan = 
$3,000 equity). If your firm has a 25-percent maintenance margin require-
ment ($2,000 in this example), your account would still be in good standing. 
However, if your firm has a 40-percent maintenance margin requirement 
($3,200 in this example), you wouldn’t have enough equity in your account 
and would need to deposit more cash or securities to increase the equity up 
to or above the maintenance margin.
Margin call
You may receive a margin call from your brokerage firm asking you to deposit 
more cash or securities if the equity in your margin account falls below 
the maintenance requirement. If you don’t meet the call, your firm will sell 

135
 #31: Use Caution When Buying on Margin
enough securities in your account to increase the equity up to the mainte-
nance requirement. Be aware that your broker isn’t required to notify you 
that your account has fallen below the maintenance requirement or to con-
tact you before selling your securities!
Margin rate
The margin rate is the interest rate you pay to purchase securities on margin. 
Margin rates are based on the broker’s call rate, which is the interest rate 
that brokerage firms pay to banks for financing margin loans. The margin rate 
will likely be quoted as the broker’s call rate (or base rate) plus or minus a 
margin (for example, “base rate less 0.50%” or “broker’s call plus 1.00%”). Be 
aware that margin rates are variable, so they can change at any time!
Recognize the Risks
Here’s a summary of the issues you should consider before buying on 
margin:
 
 Stocks don’t always increase in value. Buying on margin will magnify 
your loss if a stock declines in value.
 
 You can lose more money than you deposit. If the securities you pur-
chase on margin decline in value, you may be required to deposit addi-
tional funds or sell some of your securities.
 
 Your brokerage firm can force the sale of securities in your account. 
If you can’t deposit more money to meet a margin call, your brokerage 
firm can force you to sell securities to meet the maintenance margin.
 
 Your brokerage firm can sell your securities without contacting you. 
Your brokerage firm has the right to sell your securities to meet the 
maintenance margin without contacting you first. And you may not get a 
chance to decide which securities are sold.
 
 You’re not entitled to more time to meet a margin call. Your firm may 
extend the time to meet a margin call under certain circumstances.
 
 Your brokerage firm can increase the maintenance margin at any 
time. Changes in the maintenance margin take effect immediately and 
may cause a margin call if you don’t meet the new requirements.
 
 You’ll pay interest even if you lose money. Interest is charged on your 
margin balance whether or not you make or lose money on the trade.

Get the Most Out of Your Taxable 
Accounts
By Kevin Sale, ChFC, CFP
A
 taxable account is simply any account whose use doesn’t give you a tax 
advantage. It can be a savings account, checking account, brokerage 
account, mutual fund account, or many others. The key is that income and 
gains generated by the investments held within the account are taxed.
Most people use taxable accounts almost daily for one main reason: they’re 
flexible. Generally, there are no restrictions or penalties to their use. Any 
restrictions or penalties that do exist are tied to your investment choice, not 
your account.
 
Taxable accounts are good bets for everyday use or as a temporary holding 
spot while you determine your approach. They may also make sense as a part 
of a more complex tax strategy because taxable accounts may provide tax 
diversification for your portfolio.
Diversify Your Holdings
Social Security and Medicare projections are grim, yet income tax rates are at 
historic lows. Change may be on the horizon. Then again, income tax rates could 
remain stable for some time. Much depends on the outcome of political races. 
The only thing that’s clear is that your future income tax rate is uncertain.
As you choose your taxable accounts, the solution is to tax diversify. 
Different types of accounts have different tax consequences, and because 
your future tax rate is uncertain, it makes sense to have at least some of your 
assets in each of the three major tax buckets:
 
 Pre-tax — 401(k) and traditional IRA: Here you’re betting your tax rate 
in retirement will be less than your tax rate now. In retirement, the ideal 
time to draw funds is in years where your income need is lower or you 
have deductions that reduce your taxable income.

137
 #32: Getting the Most Out of Your Taxable Accounts
 
 Post-tax — Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA: With Roth accounts, you make 
the opposite bet: Your tax rate now is less than it’ll be in retirement. 
When withdrawals from your tax-deferred account will place you into a 
higher tax bracket, you can pull money from your Roth account instead 
for tax-free income, keeping yourself in a lower tax bracket.
 
 Taxable — long-term capital gains: Taxable accounts aren’t a gamble 
on income tax rates, but they provide flexibility in drawing cash in 
retirement. Under current law, gains are taxed at just 15 percent when 
realized after one year, and unrealized gains aren’t taxed at all. You 
should use taxable accounts to generate growth with unrealized capi-
tal gains. (A gain is realized when you sell an investment at a profit; if 
the investment has gained value but hasn’t been sold, then the gain is 
unrealized.)
 
 Taxable accounts can potentially provide “tax-free” income in retire-
ment. In years with capital losses, you can offset your realized gains with 
those losses and take the cash tax-free. You may even be able to deduct 
up to $3,000 of losses against your income.
 
Using taxable accounts to tax diversify your holdings makes the most sense 
when you’ve already contributed the maximum to tax-advantaged vehicles. 
The added flexibility of a taxable account is unlikely to outweigh tax-advan-
taged growth for a long-term investment.
Know the Different Types 
of Taxable Accounts
You can invest in three basic types of taxable accounts:
 
 Individual: An account established for one person
 
 Joint: Any account owned by two or more people
 
 Custodial: An account created for the benefit of a minor
Going solo with individual accounts
If you’re not married, the individual account will likely be the type of account 
you use. With an individual account, you’re the sole owner and have com-
plete decision-making authority. In the event of your death, the proceeds 
from an individual account pass to your estate.

Married couples or related persons typically use joint accounts for conve-
nient access so they can manage their financial affairs together. You don’t 
have to be married or related, however, to use a joint account. Table 32-1 
shows the two most common types of joint accounts.

one’s stake
Each owner can sell, will, 
or gift his or her stake to 
another.
At death, the decedent’s share 
of the account passes to the 
surviving owners equally.
Taking care with custodial accounts
Custodial accounts are accounts established for the benefit of a minor and 
are generally opened under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or the 
Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA). The minor is considered the owner 
of the account, but a custodian must be in place to manage the account.
All funds transferred to the account are considered irrevocable gifts and 
must be used for the minor’s benefit. When the minor reaches the age of 
majority, the recipient can do what he or she wants with the funds.
 
Custodial accounts provide irrevocable gifts to a minor. If you act as custo-
dian, you’ll manage the funds for the minor’s benefit until the minor reaches 
the age of majority and receives full authority over the funds.

Invest in Individual Retirement 
Accounts (IRAs)
By Kevin Sale, ChFC, CFP
I
nvesting in IRAs can be a great way to save in a tax-advantaged manner. 
They’re often used to complement or replace retirement savings at work, 
and Roth IRAs provide a means to tax-diversify your portfolio. Read on to dis-
cover how to use IRAs to increase your savings and fortify your nest egg.
Types of Individual IRAs
IRAs come in two main types:
 
 Traditional: In a traditional IRA, you don’t pay any taxes on the income 
and gains you generate until you withdraw them; all withdrawals will 
be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. Annual contributions may or 
may not be tax-deductible, depending on your circumstances.
 
 Roth: With the Roth IRA, you make contributions on an after-tax basis. 
The income and gains you generate are never taxed; you can make with-
drawals tax-free as long as you’re over 59½   and the account has been 
open for more than five years.
 
 Because you’ve already paid taxes, you can also remove your contribu-
tions or basis tax-free at any time. But if you convert money from a tra-
ditional (or SEP or SIMPLE) IRA to your Roth, you have to wait five years 
before withdrawing those converted funds tax-free.
Contribution Limits
Here are the 2008 IRA contribution limits for both Roth and traditional IRAs:
 
 Regular contribution: $5,000
 
 Catch-up contribution (for those 50 and older): $1,000

Table 33-1 presents the income limits for Roth IRAs for 2008. Note that if your 
AGI is within the phase-out range, you may make a partial contribution (for 
example, if you’re halfway, you can make half the contribution).

To Roth or Not to Roth
When you run the numbers using the same assumptions for each type of 
account, traditional and Roth IRAs are mathematically equal. In other words, 
if your income tax rate remains the same, you end up with the same amount 
of after-tax dollars in retirement — regardless of whether you take taxes out 
before or after you put your money in the IRA.
For example, assume you’re in the 15-percent tax bracket and you have 
$5,000 to contribute. Whether you put the $5,000 into a traditional IRA and 
pay 15 percent in taxes on a withdrawal or you put the after-tax equivalent 
of $4,250 ($5,000 – 15 percent = $750) into a Roth IRA, you’ll have the same 
amount of after-tax dollars in retirement.
 
You do get a built-in advantage with a Roth IRA in terms of contribution limits. 
The maximum contribution for both Roth and traditional IRAs is the same; 
however, because you can withdraw the Roth dollars tax-free, the dollars you 
put into to a Roth are worth more than the dollars you put into a traditional 
IRA. On an after-tax basis, you can save more money with a Roth than with a 
traditional IRA.
So what’s all the fuss about? Just go with the Roth, right? Unfortunately, 
it’s not that simple. Yes, assuming all things are equal, the Roth is a slightly 
better option only because you can save more on an after-tax basis. However, 
the Roth or traditional IRA decision comes down to a question of taxation: 
Do you expect your current income tax rate to be higher or lower than your 
income tax rate when you withdraw the money?

142
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
 
 Generally, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than 
when you make your contribution, the traditional IRA is the better 
option. You effectively defer your taxes until they’re at a lower rate.
 
 If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you withdraw the 
money, the Roth IRA is the better deal. Here, you lock in your lower tax 
rate and avoid paying taxes at your future higher tax rate.
This decision may seem straightforward, but determining whether your tax 
rate at withdrawal will be higher or lower than today may be harder than you 
think. Consider these factors:
 
 Changing tax rates: Most people make the mistake of assuming that 
today’s tax rates are the same tax rates they’ll have in retirement. But 
considering that income tax rates are at an historical low, you may find 
yourself with a lower income but an equal or higher tax rate.
 
 Career path: Although you don’t always anticipate it, many career paths 
are filled with twists and turns. Are you sure about your future income?
 
 Size of your nest egg: If you’re a super-saver, you may live on a higher 
income in retirement. On the other hand, a small nest egg may fund only 
a portion of the income you take home today.
 
 A murky future outlook: Much can change, and making accurate 
assumptions about the next 20 to 30 years is difficult.
 
Because the future is uncertain, it’s impossible to know whether a Roth or 
a traditional IRA will be better for you. You may be better off hedging your 
bets and saving in both tax-deferred (traditional IRA) and after-tax (Roth IRA) 
vehicles. This strategy is often described as tax diversification.
Don’t forget that you may already be saving in a tax-deferred manner through 
your 401(k) or other retirement plan at work. So after looking at all the 
options, a Roth IRA may trump a traditional IRA if for no other reason than 
it’s the only available option for saving on an after-tax basis — assuming your 
employer doesn’t offer a Roth 401(k) option.
 
If cash is tight and you feel uncomfortable locking away your money in a 
retirement vehicle with hefty penalties for early withdrawal, a Roth IRA may 
be for you; you can still save in a tax-advantaged manner, but you can with-
draw your contributions (not your gains) at any time penalty- and tax-free.
Converting to Roth
If your adjusted gross income (regardless of filing status) is below $100,000, 
you can convert traditional IRA assets to Roth IRA assets without penalty. 

143
 #33: Invest in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
Unfortunately, you still have to pay income tax on the assets converted, but 
you would’ve done that eventually, anyway. Converting now can help you tax 
diversify.
If your adjusted gross income is above $100,000, don’t worry. In 2010, the 
income limit for conversions is lifted. Anyone can convert traditional IRA 
assets to Roth assets (although it may not make sense tax-wise).
Even better, the changes going into effect in 2010 provide two additional 
perks:
 
 Taxes are deferred to 2011 and 2012. Converting a large balance to 
a Roth IRA will generate a sizeable tax bill, but Congress lessened the 
burden by allowing the income tax you must pay to be split between 
2011 and 2012. If you expect your 2010 tax bracket to be lower than your 
future bracket, you can still recognize all the income in 2010.
 
 You can sidestep the income limit. Although an income limit on Roth 
contributions will still technically exist before and after 2010, you can 
easily sidestep that limit. You can contribute to a nondeductible IRA 
(see the next section) and then convert it to a Roth. Before going this 
route, make sure you understand the tax rules, especially if you have 
IRAs funded with both deductible and nondeductible contributions, 
because income tax will be due on the proportionate share of deductible 
contributions (for all your IRAs, not just your nondeductible IRAs).
Nondeductible IRAs
A nondeductible IRA is a bit of a misnomer because it really describes con-
tributions to a traditional IRA that aren’t tax-deductible. You lose the tax-
deduction either because you’ve exceeded the annual limit for contributions 
or because your income exceeds the limit for that year.
The primary benefit of nondeductible IRA contributions is tax-deferred 
growth of earnings. The problem is that withdrawn earnings are taxed at 
ordinary income rates, possibly as high as 35 percent. This holds true even 
for what would otherwise be long-term capital gains, which would be taxed at 
only 15 percent in a taxable account.
 
Outside of using a nondeductible IRA to sidestep contribution limits on a Roth 
IRA, contributing to an IRA on a nondeductible basis is rarely a good strategy. 
Before contributing to a nondeductible IRA, be sure you’ve exhausted other 
more advantageous investment vehicles, such as your employer’s retirement 
plan, a traditional or Roth IRA, and the 529 college savings plan. You’ll also 
want to weigh the benefits of saving in a plain old taxable account.w

Make the Most of Your Employer 
Retirement Accounts
By Barbara Camaglia, MBA, CFP, CFS, CPA
Y
our eyes may glaze over at retirement-plan numbers — 401(k), 403(b), 
457 — but you want to be sure you understand yours. For most 
people, an employer-sponsored plan is crucial to accumulating enough for 
retirement.
The information here, which emphasizes the general rules rather than the 
exceptions, is intended to give you a basic understanding of employer retire-
ment plans and some ways to make the most of them. Your employer can 
provide information on the specific provisions of your plan. Check with 
your financial planner and/or tax advisor on the state of current laws before 
making significant changes, withdrawals, and so on.
 
You have investment risk in your retirement plan. Manage this risk by working 
these accounts into your overall asset allocation and paying attention to the 
costs and performance of your investments in the plan.
Know Your Plans
401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans are governed by three sets of rules: Internal 
Revenue Service Code sections, other federal laws such as ERISA (Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act), and an employer’s optional elections. 
Check with your tax advisor and human resources department to be sure you 
understand the features of your plan.
401(k) and 403(b)
401(k) plans are established by private-sector, for-profit employers. The 
employer decides whether its plan allows loans, hardship distributions, and 
Roth 401(k) contributions. 403(b) plans are similar to 401(k) plans but are 
found in public educational organizations, nonprofit organizations, and some 
religious organizations.

145
 # 34: Make the Most of Your Employer Retirement Accounts
457
457 plans are most commonly government or private-sector deferred-
compensation plans:
 
 Government: A state or local government offers the government 457 
plan. These plans received a makeover from the Economic Growth and 
Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Pension Protection Act, 
and now they work much like 401(k)s.
 
 The 457 plan lets government employees put away more pre-tax money 
to supplement their pensions and other retirement savings. It isn’t sub-
ject to creditor claims of the employer, and funds must be set aside in 
a separate annuity or trust. The government plan may allow you to use 
money from your 457 account to purchase service credits to increase 
pension benefits. Contribution limits equal the employee deferral-contri-
bution limits of 401(k)s ($15,500 as of this writing).
 
 Private-sector: The private-sector 457 plan serves as an additional way 
to defer compensation and taxes after you maximize contributions to 
a 401(k). To get the additional tax benefits, you have a substantial risk 
of forfeiture, which means you have a real risk of loss. These funds are 
subject to the creditor claims of the employer. If you have one of these 
plans, you can save more on a tax-deferred basis, even after you’ve 
deferred your maximum amount in a 401(k). You don’t have a 10-percent 
penalty for withdrawals before age 591/2. The funds are taxed as ordinary 
income when you receive them.
 
Use the government 457 plan to supplement your pension; use the private-
sector 457 plan when you want to defer more than your 401(k) allows. 
Understand that with a private-sector 457, your money isn’t as secure because 
it’s subject to creditors’ claims against your employer.
Get Money into Your Accounts
So how do you invest money in your retirement plan? You have a few 
options:
 
 You contribute the funds through salary deferrals.
 
 Your employer contributes the funds.
 
 You have investment earnings in a retirement account.
 
 You roll another retirement account into the plan.

146
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
Employee contributions
You usually make your employee contributions before tax. Federal, state, 
and local income taxes apply when the contributions are distributed to you. 
Social Security taxes on your contributions aren’t deferred. If you make post-
tax contributions, you’re usually taxed only on the earnings in the account 
upon distribution.
Your employer may allow Roth 401(k) or 403(b) contributions. (At the time 
of this writing, a bill allowing government 457 Roth contributions is pending.) 
You make Roth contributions after tax, and the earnings on Roth contribu-
tions should be tax-free. If Roth contributions are allowed, you can make 
your employee contributions Roth contributions, pre-tax contributions, or 
some of each.
 
In deciding whether to make Roth contributions, consider your tax rate now 
and in retirement. If your marginal rate in retirement will be significantly 
lower, pre-tax contributions may be preferable. If you think overall rates are 
likely to increase significantly, consider Roth contributions.
Employer contributions
Many 401(k) plans have an employer match based on a formula or per-
centage. For example, perhaps an employer matches $0.50 for each $1 the 
employee contributes, up to a maximum of 6 percent of the employee’s 
salary. This is free money, and you should take advantage of it. 403(b) plans 
may or may not have matching contributions. Employers can match contribu-
tions to a Roth account, but they must match the funds on a pre-tax basis. 
They can’t make contributions into the designated Roth account. Here are a 
couple of tips:
 
 If your employer matches contributions, contribute at least as much as 
needed to get the entire employer match.
 
 Consider contributing enough to receive the match and then funding 
an IRA. Then continue contributions to the plan up to the maximum 
allowed, if you have enough income.
Investment earnings
The choices your employer made limit the investment options in your employer 
plan. Think of it as your menu. When choosing, consider the following:

147
 # 34: Make the Most of Your Employer Retirement Accounts
 
 Don’t put too large of a percentage of your assets into your employer’s 
stock. Every individual stock you own is subject to company risk, which 
is compounded when the company is your employer.
 
 Look at your employer plan as part of your total portfolio. Choose plan 
investments that fit within your overall asset allocation and complement 
investments in your IRA and other accounts.
 
 Fees and other costs cut into your return. Look for investments with low 
fees and operating expenses.
Rollovers
Generally, employees can transfer employer plan account balances to 
another employer plan or to an IRA when they leave a job, without tax or 
penalty, regardless of age. However, if you don’t transfer your balance as 
a trustee-to-trustee transfer, the plan customarily withholds 20 percent for 
taxes. Make sure your rollover is a trustee-to-trustee transfer if possible.
Prepare to Take Funds Out
When funds come out of employer plans, they’re usually subject to ordinary 
income tax unless they’re rolled over to an individual retirement account 
(IRA) or if an exception applies. (Also see Strategy #74 for more information.)
Usual distributions
Distributions are subject to ordinary income tax and can be subject to a 
10-percent penalty tax unless they’re qualifying distributions. You can take 
qualifying distributions only after age 59½   unless one of the following applies:
 
 Disability
 
 Death
 
 A qualified domestic relations order (divorce)
 
 A distribution covering medical expenses in excess of 7.5 percent of 
adjusted gross income (AGI)
 
 Separation from employment at age 55 or older
 
 Victim of a specific natural disaster (designated by the federal 
government)
 
 Other (check with the IRS)

148
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
NUA of employer stock in a 401(k)
If you have company stock in your plan and the stock is eligible, you may be 
able to take advantage of special tax rules. Basically, if the stock value has 
grown substantially, net unrealized appreciation (NUA) rules allow you to pay 
regular tax only on the original cost when the stock comes out of the plan 
and capital gains tax on the balance upon the sale of the stock. Any gain in 
value over your basis will be taxed at capital gains rates when you eventually 
sell the shares. Long-term capital gains rates are currently lower than the 
ordinary income tax rates for most people.
If you’re eligible and if you and your tax advisor determine it’s worth doing, 
you must take a lump-sum distribution of your retirement-plan within one cal-
endar year. The account is split into a taxable account that receives the com-
pany stock, while the balance of the account (everything that’s not employer 
stock) may be transferred into an IRA or other tax-deferred plan.
Withdrawals and loans in hard times
If you need money, you can explore these options to withdraw funds from 
your retirement plan:
 
 Hardship withdrawals: An employer may allow hardship distributions, 
but if it isn’t a qualifying distribution, the 10-percent penalty applies.
 
 Taking plan loans: Although some plans allow loans, taking one is typi-
cally a bad idea. If you invest properly, you’re likely to earn more in the 
account over the loan period than you’d pay in loan interest. Reducing 
your investment returns during the loan period can make a big differ-
ence later. You’ll also be repaying the loan with post-tax money, which 
will ultimately be taxed again when you withdraw the money.
 
Bankruptcy protection is a critical reason not to take out a loan against plan 
assets. An employer retirement plan often protects your assets in the event of 
your bankruptcy, so if you take money out of the plan, you could be making 
an exempt asset nonexempt. Plans receive protection if they’re covered under 
applicable federal statutes, such as being ERISA qualified, protected by the 
Bankruptcy Abuse Protection and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, or pro-
tected by the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Some states have applicable state 
statutes. Check with an attorney for applicability of statutes to your plan(s).
What if your company is in trouble and declares bankruptcy? Retirement 
funds in 401(k), 403(b), and government 457 plans are generally protected 
against your employer’s creditors’ claims. Consult with an advisor for the 
specifics on your plan and current laws. This doesn’t protect against declines 
in the plan’s investments.

Choose a Self-Employment 
Retirement Account
By Roland Mariano, CPA
O
pening a retirement plan is a big decision for every business, espe-
cially for the self-employed. Even in uncertain times, the benefits out-
weigh the costs. This section explains retirement plans for yourself and any 
employees.
Self-Employment Retirement Plans
As a self-employed individual or small-business owner, you can choose from 
the SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, individual 401(k), or Roth IRA.
SEP (simplified employee pension) IRA
A simplified employee pension (SEP) is a low-cost plan for the small business 
owner. These plans are easy to establish and have practically no IRS filing 
requirements. SEPs use IRAs as the trustee/custodian for the contributions.
The amount to contribute on behalf of an employee is 25 percent of the 
employee’s wages or $46,000, whichever is less (2008 limit). The employer’s 
contribution to the SEP-IRA must be uniform for all employees. For you, the 
self-employed individual/owner, the maximum percentage is 20 percent of 
your net self-employment income adjusted (see IRS Publication 560).
SEP-IRAs can be either fiscal year or calendar year, and you don’t have to 
contribute to the SEP-IRA every year. New businesses considering setting up 
a SEP-IRA can wait as late as the due date of their tax return, including exten-
sions. So a Schedule C (Form 1040) filer can wait until October 15 of the fol-
lowing year to open and fund a SEP-IRA.

150
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
 
If you have employees and you want to maximize your contribution versus 
your employees’, you may be able to allocate contributions through a method 
called Social Security integration if your plan provides this option. You can do 
this if your earnings are greater than the Social Security wage base or $102,000 
(2008). See your financial advisor for more on this computation and ask 
whether this provision is offered in the plan document.
For more information, IRS Publication 4333, “SEP Retirement Plans for 
Small Businesses,” is a useful guide. Visit www.irs.gov or call the Internal 
Revenue Service at 800-829-3676.
SIMPLE (savings incentive 
match plan) IRA
Any business can set up a SIMPLE IRA if it has fewer than 100 employees and 
no other retirement plan in place. Under this plan, both the employer and 
employee contribute to an IRA. Employee contributions are pre-tax salary 
deferrals. Employees can contribute 100 percent of their salary or up to a 
maximum of $10,500 (for 2008). If the employee is age 50 or older, he or she is 
entitled to put away an additional $2,500 (called catch-up).
As the employer, you can fund the employee SIMPLE-IRAs in two ways:
 
 Matching contribution: The employer matches salary contributions 
dollar-for-dollar up to 3 percent of wages (with a maximum match of 
$10,500). The employer may choose to limit this to 1 percent for any two 
years in a five-year period.
 
 Non-elective contribution: The employer contributes a fixed 2 percent 
of wages (up to $4,600, or $230,000 × 2%) to all eligible participants, 
whether the employee makes contributions from his or her salary or 
not.
See IRS Publication 4334 for more information on the SIMPLE IRA. Note: 
Individuals deferring up to $2,000 of their salary may be entitled to a tax 
credit on their individual return; please see your tax advisor.
SIMPLE IRAs must be maintained on a calendar year basis. October 1 is the 
deadline to set up a SIMPLE IRA plan. If you’re a new employer after October 
1, you can still set up the plan, but do so as soon as possible. The IRS will 
allow this (see your tax advisor regarding IRS Notice 98-4, K-1).

151
 #35: Choose a Self-Employment Retirement Account
Individual 401(k)
If your business is a sole proprietorship, a corporation with no employees 
besides you and your spouse, or a partnership with no employees, then an 
individual 401(k) is an appropriate retirement vehicle. You can put away more 
for retirement with an individual 401(k) than you can with the SEP-IRA or 
SIMPLE IRA. The individual 401(k) allows you to contribute in two components:
 
 Salary deferral of $15,500 (for 2008) plus a catch-up contribution of 
$5,000 if you’re age 50 or older
 
 A profit-sharing contribution limited to 25 percent of compensation; 
the contribution is limited to 20 percent of compensation for the self-
employed individual
 
Here are some points to note about the individual 401(k):
 
 Plan loans are allowed (50 percent of the account balance or $50,000, 
whichever is less). But check with the financial institution to make sure 
the plan document includes this provision.
 
 You need to make your salary reduction choice by December 31.
 
 This plan has a 401(k) feature, so think about the annual limit. It’s 
$15,500 (for 2008), so if you participate in another 401(k) plan and you 
put away $9,000, you can defer only $6,500 under the individual 401(k) 
plan.
 
 An individual 401(k) is designed for the owner and spouse only. If you 
expect to hire additional full-time employees, you shouldn’t consider an 
individual 401(k) plan.
 
 An individual 401k plan is subject to filing IRS Form 5500EZ. But great 
news! You’re not required to file this form until the account balance 
reaches $250,000.
Roth IRA
As long as you’ve earned income, you can set up a Roth IRA. Earnings are tax 
free, unlike in a regular IRA. No deduction is allowed on the individual tax 
return for Roth contributions. Also, the law allows you to contribute to this 
type of plan even after you reach age 701/2, the age at which you have to begin 
taking distributions from your retirement account.

152
Part II: Using Investment Vehicles and Accounts Throughout the Economic Cycle
You can contribute the annual limit of $5,000, plus $1,000 (for 2008) if you’re 
age 50 and older. How much of this you can contribute is affected by the self-
employed individual’s adjusted gross income.
Decide Which Plan to Open
Your objective is usually to start with the cheapest plan that’ll allow you to 
put away the most money into a retirement plan. The number of employees 
who qualify for your business’s retirement plan affects overall cost. Table

Understand Investment Risks
By Michael Knight, CFP
S
ome risks can certainly be avoided; others cannot. The only certainty 
in investing — and probably in life — is uncertainty, and if you find that 
to be a little scary, you’re in good company. Investing features risk, which 
means that preparing for long-term goals like retirement can really be an 
adventure. It’s like a Lewis and Clark expedition: You may not be able to 
anticipate every step of the way, but you’ll reach your destination if you 
understand the risks and you prepare for this long and exciting adventure.
With investing, it’s easy to think that the only risk involves watching your 
investments lose their value when the market goes down. However, other 
risks — emotion, inflation, outliving your assets, and holding investments 
that you don’t understand — are lurking in the shadows. These risks become 
less scary if you understand them better and develop a plan to deal with 
them.
Emotional Risks
The biggest threat to your financial freedom may be you. When the market 
went through its painful three-year downturn beginning in 2000, many inves-
tors decided to run for the exits and then missed out on the solid returns of 
the next five years. Fear and greed tend to drive markets, and it’s easy to suc-
cumb to either of these powerful emotions. The worst thing that you can do 
is react to what happened in the market today or yesterday. You need a big 
windshield and a small rearview mirror.
 
Take a long-term, disciplined, and consistent approach to investing with an 
understanding that market volatility is to be expected.
If you know yourself and if you know how you’ve reacted in the past, you’re 
in a better position to invest in a way that is right for you. Here’s what to do:
 
 Understand your risk tolerance (see Strategy #38).
 
 The best plans are based on clear and specific goals, so use the help of a 
fee-only advisor to help develop an investment plan that fits your finan-
cial and emotional needs.

156
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
 
 During times of uncertainty, look at your monthly statements, but don’t 
check your investments daily and don’t panic. Stick to your plan.
Threats of Inflation
One reason you invest is to keep pace with inflation and shield you from lost 
purchasing power. When you invest for a long-term goal, such as retirement, 
you need to think about the impact inflation will have over 30 or 40 years.
The longer the time period, the more inflation will erode your buying power. 
With 4 percent inflation a year, $1.00 today will buy just 30 cents worth of 
goods or services in 30 years. In other words, at an annual 4 percent inflation 
rate, $100,000 set aside today for retirement will be worth just $30,800 30 
years from now. If inflation jumps to 5 percent, your $100,000 will be worth 
$23,000 in 30 years. Now that’s scary.
Another negative affect of inflation is that it reduces the value of long-term 
bonds as interest rates rise. This includes government bonds that may be 
backed by the federal government but are subject to a decrease in value 
when interest rates go up.
 
Here are some ways to protect yourself from inflation:
 
 The best strategy is to invest for long-term growth and inflation protec-
tion with a diversified mixture of stocks and high-quality short term 
bonds. For more information, check out Strategy #41.
 
 Invest in a diversified mix of investments that includes both U.S. and 
international stocks.
 
 When interest rates are rising, use high-quality short-term bond funds 
and high-quality money market accounts.
 
 To protect against unexpected inflation, invest a small portion of your 
investments in Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). You can 
easily do this with a mutual fund that invests in TIPS.
Roller Coaster: Market Volatility
Volatility is a measure of how much a security rises or falls within a short 
period of time. Low volatility is best because the greater the volatility, the 
more difficult it is to achieve your goals.

157
 #36: Understand Investment Risks
Many investors felt the pain of extreme volatility when the technology bubble 
burst in 2000. For example, one technology mutual fund, the Janus Venture 
Fund, fell 60 percent between March 2000 and February 2001. This means 
that $10,000 invested on March 1, 2000, was worth just $4,000 a year later. 
Returning to the $10,000 original investment would require a 150-percent gain.
 
You can reduce the risk of big, volatile swings in the value of your investments 
through diversification. And because volatility seems to diminish over time, 
carefully consider how soon you’ll need your money when making investment 
choices. Here are a couple of strategies:
 
 If you’ll need a certain amount of cash within the next five years, don’t 
invest it in stocks. Use money market funds, CDs, and high-quality short-
term bond funds instead.
 
 Avoid concentrated investments in any one company or market sector. 
This includes your employer’s stock, which should be limited to no 
more than 10 percent of your investments.
The Risk of Outliving Your Money
One of life’s greatest uncertainties is how long you’ll live. Retire at 65, and 
you could live 30 years or more without a paycheck, running the risk of 
depleting your nest egg. Consider a married couple, both age 59 and non-
smokers: There’s a 50 percent chance that one of them will live to age 92 and 
a 30 percent chance that one of them will live to age 95.
 
One of the best strategies is to prepare now for a long retirement by saving 
more and spending less. It also helps to plan ahead and think about ways to 
generate income during retirement. Understand your current and future cash 
flow needs.
If your cash flow plan includes a way to separate fixed and discretionary 
expenses, you’ll be able to adapt to the unexpected. Here’s how:
 
 Expense control is essential, so look for a system for tracking expenses. 
Personal finance software programs like Quicken or Microsoft Money 
are good options. You can also find free templates with a personal 
budget worksheet and a family monthly budget planner on the Microsoft 
Office Web site (office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates).
 
 Be careful about withdrawal rates. One rule of thumb is that you 
shouldn’t be withdrawing more than 4 percent from your savings and 
investments during the initial years of your retirement.

158
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
 
 Consider a fixed annuity with a portion of your savings, say 25 percent, 
but wait until you’re approaching age 70 to invest in it. (Read Strategy 
#19 to find out more about fixed annuities.)
 
 Delay collecting Social Security until at least your full retirement age and 
even as late as 70 if possible.
 
 Plan ahead so you can generate some income in retirement. A part-time 
job can be fun and take some pressure off your investments.
The Risk of Making Investments 
You Don’t Understand
Investments are sometimes complicated because they’re designed to be good 
for the company selling the product rather than for you. Make sure you do 
some research and know what you’re buying. Find out what penalties you 
may face if you want to get your money back.
 
Understand the compensation policies for salespersons. If you’re dealing with 
investment products sold by banks, brokerage firms, or insurance companies, 
watch out for a potential conflict of interest. The person representing the insti-
tution is receiving a salary and often commissions from guiding you to a short 
list of products that produce income for the institution. To avoid this risk, 
follow these tips:
 
 Don’t invest in products you don’t understand.
 
 Be sure you know how the salesperson or advisor across the table is 
being paid.
 
 Use a fee-only advisor willing to provide you with a written statement 
that says that loyalty to you is the top priority.

Sort Through an 
Investment’s Return
By Jean Keener
E
ver opened up your 401(k) statement and found yourself wondering, “Is 
this good?” Or seen the sales commissions being charged each time you 
invest in your mutual fund and thought, “How are these affecting my retire-
ment savings?” But as you start thinking about all the percentages, ratios, 
and math involved in answering these questions, your eyes glaze over, and 
suddenly tomorrow sounds like a much better time to start answering these 
questions.
Well, in reality, you deal with return on investment daily in your life. It can 
be a question of how much effort you’d have to invest to lose 10 pounds. Or 
whether it’s worth the time required to cut carrots and put them in small 
bags for school lunches to save the money on preassembled snack packs. 
You make these decisions constantly in a split second based on your priori-
ties, knowledge, and resources of time, money, or energy.
Assessing financial return on investment really isn’t much different. Figuring 
out your returns takes just a couple of minutes. This can mean a better retire-
ment, a cooler vacation, or more money to spend on the things you really 
care about.
Calculate Your Return
The return is how much money you made or lost on an investment. You look 
at how much you invested and the total amount it’s worth now. The differ-
ence in these amounts is your absolute return — either positive or negative.
Holding period return
Holding period return shows you the absolute return over the entire time you 
owned the investment, whether that’s three months, a year, ten years, or 
some other time period. Here’s how to calculate the holding period return:

160
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
Total worth of investment now – money invested = holding period return
 
With the holding-period-return formula, don’t forget any dividends or other 
income received from your investment. If you reinvested the income, it’s auto-
matically included. If you didn’t reinvest, you need to add the income to what 
your investment is worth now to calculate an accurate return.
After you figure out the dollar amount you made or lost (hopefully made!), 
you can convert it to a percentage. Percentages allow you to compare dif-
ferent investments to each other regardless of the dollar amount of money 
invested. Here’s how to calculate your percentage return:
Holding period return ÷ money invested × 100 = percentage return
Annualized return
The rubber really meets the road with annualized returns. If a couple buys 
a house for $100,000 and sells it ten years later for $130,000, they may think 
they earned a really great return. They made $30,000, or 30 percent, accord-
ing to the formula in the preceding section. But think about what that actu-
ally equates to each year.
Calculating annualized returns requires more math than holding period 
return because of compound interest. Each year, your investment’s 
increase in value is based not only on the original investment amount but 
also on all the interest or increase in value gained in earlier years. Financial 
planners use software or a financial calculator to calculate annualized 
returns; no one does this manually. For the $100,000 house that sees a 
30-percent holding period return over ten years, the annualized return 
comes out to 2.66 percent.
 
You can eyeball annualized return with this shortcut:
Percentage return (of holding period) ÷ number of years = ballpark annu-
alized return
With the house example, the annualized return comes out to 3 percent when 
you use the shortcut method. (Just remember that this shortcut isn’t exact.)
You can also use online calculators to get exact annualized return figures. If an 
online calculator asks for the present value, enter the value of the investment at 
the beginning. Future value is the value of the investment at the end. Some good 
online calculators are available at www.moneychimp.com, www.bankrate.com, 

161
 #37: Sort Through an Investment’s Return 
and finance.yahoo.com (do a search for “compound interest calculator” for 
other options).
 
Don’t forget the effect of expenses when calculating your returns. Here are the 
most common expenses:
 
 Real estate: Take into account commissions, property taxes, and inter-
est on your mortgage, among other expenses. If you’re calculating 
returns on your primary residence, also take into account that you need 
a place to live, so you would’ve been paying rent if you hadn’t been 
paying your mortgage.
 
 Mutual funds, stocks, or bonds: Include any commissions or manage-
ment fees as part the initial cost of your investment. If you’re not sure 
whether you’re paying commissions, you probably are. Ask for no-load 
funds if you want to avoid commissions, and be sure to understand how 
your advisor is being compensated.
Identify Good versus Bad Returns
After you calculate your annualized return, you’re ready to determine 
whether your results are up to par. Three basic factors show you whether 
your returns are doing their job. The importance of each depends on your 
personal circumstances.
Achieving your goals
The first question you need to ask is whether this investment is returning 
enough to achieve your goals (see Strategy #13 for info on setting financial 
goals). When you set a goal to retire in 15 years, you make several assump-
tions about how much money you’ll be saving and what kind of return you’ll 
be earning on your savings. In financial jargon, this is your required rate of 
return. A required rate of return varies by individual, depending on the 
following:
 
 The length of time the money will be invested
 
 Your tolerance for risk
 
 Other options available to you as investment vehicles

162
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
If your investment is meeting your required rate of return, great! If not, you 
can adjust your goals, seek a better-performing investment, or take on more 
risk.
Beating the benchmark
How does your investment’s return compare to its peers? In some years, a 
2-percent return for a particular mutual fund is pretty good. In other years, a 
2-percent return for the same mutual fund is terrible. It all depends on what 
other comparable funds did that year.
 
To accurately compare an investment to its peers, determine what the rel-
evant benchmark is. You can usually find information on the benchmark and 
the average performance of similar funds on your brokerage’s Web site. Here’s 
how to define peers of various investments:
 
 Stocks: Compare with other companies of similar size in the same 
industry.
 
 Bonds: Compare with other bonds of similar maturity dates and credit 
ratings.
 
 Real estate: Compare real estate appreciation or depreciation in simi-
lar neighborhoods in the same or other markets. Sites such as www.
zillow.com or www.realtytimes.com are good sources for market 
comparisons.
 
 Mutual funds: Three industry standard benchmarks are based on the 
size of company a mutual fund invests in:
 
• Large cap: S&P 500
 
• Mid cap: S&P 400
 
• Small cap: Russell 2000
 
Look for choices that have consistently performed at or above their bench-
mark, but beware — you shouldn’t jump to a fund just because it’s had a really 
terrific year and wildly outperforms its comparison fund. You also shouldn’t 
automatically dump a fund because of one bad quarter or year. A lot of inves-
tors chase returns, but when you do, you have a good chance of buying high 
and selling low rather than the other way around.

Assess Your Ability 
to Absorb Losses
By Ben Jennings, CPA/PFS, CFP
E
very investment exposes you to some type of risk. Although you should 
consider each type of risk, the one that seems to dominate during 
uncertain times is shrinking portfolio values — what most people call “losing 
money.” But if you have a well-diversified, long-term portfolio, you should 
look at portfolio declines as temporary. The long-term reality is that you 
won’t lose all your money, contrary to what it feels like during volatile 
markets.
Over time, you’ll have investment experiences that differ from your expecta-
tions; the real issue is how much and for how long. If the temporary losses 
exceed your willingness to maintain your strategy, you’re likely to take 
actions such as abandoning stocks in favor of cash; or you may fail to take 
actions such as rebalancing the portfolio. Both paths result in worse long-
term investment results than if you had a more stable, less anxiety-producing 
portfolio in the first place.
Evaluating your ability and willingness to maintain your portfolio strategy 
during downturns is critical. Here are two primary considerations:
 
 Making sure your expectations are realistic
 
 Knowing what your likely response will be in various scenarios
This strategy discusses realistic expectations and helps you gauge your risk 
capacity, risk tolerance, and risk requirements.
Line Up Your Expectations with Reality
Suppose you love coffee, grunge music, boating, and salmon. You consider 
moving to Seattle, but you’ve heard the rain is awful. You do some research 
and discover that Seattle gets fewer inches of rain than Houston. So this 
means Seattle’s climate is pretty much like Houston’s, right? Not so fast! 

164
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
Average rainfall doesn’t give the complete picture. To get a realistic view of 
Seattle’s climate, you have to consider multiple perspectives (in this case, 
frequency of rain as well as amount). You may love living in the Northwest — 
millions do — but the odds go down if you don’t have appropriate expecta-
tions before moving there.
In a similar way, looking at average returns in the stock market doesn’t pro-
vide a reliable perspective on actual stock market behavior. For example, you 
may know that the long-term average return for the U.S. stock market is close 
to 10 percent. However, since 1926, investors have experienced negative 
annual returns about 30 percent of the time — temporary periods of loss for 
long-term investors.
Investing in stocks and simply expecting a 10-percent average return is like 
moving to Seattle and expecting it to be less rainy than Houston: Although it 
may be technically true, your actual experience will differ. A well-diversified 
long-term portfolio often shows declines in particular asset classes as well as 
overall declines.
Evaluate Your Risk Profile
When you have realistic expectations of market behavior, you’re ready to 
implement an investment strategy. When determining your portfolio alloca-
tions, consider at least three perspectives:
 
 Risk capacity: How much risk should you take, assuming a worst-case 
scenario? Take the following into account:
 
• Your age and how many income-earning years you expect to have 
left
 
• Your ability to insure against risks to your financial security
 
• Your net worth
 
• Your expenses covered by future incomes not related to invest-
ments, such as pensions and Social Security
 
• Your family situation
 
 Risk tolerance: How much risk can you take? Consider your ability to 
stick with your investment plan without lying awake at night. Your emo-
tional reaction to volatility is much more of a trait (a long-term charac-
teristic) than a state (a temporary response). Though your reaction to 
volatility may change as you gain investing experience, it’s also related 
to how you’re wired.

165
 #38: Assess Your Ability to Absorb Losses
 
 Free online questionnaires from mutual fund companies and brokerages 
can help you assess this aspect of your personality. Alternatively, an 
Australian company, FinaMetrica, offers two Web-based assessments for 
a fee (www.myrisktolerance.com).
 
 Risk required: How much risk must you take? The answer depends on 
your goals and objectives and on how much time you have to achieve 
them. Remember, your objective isn’t necessarily to earn the highest 
return but rather to have the greatest likelihood of accomplishing your 
goals. It makes no sense to tolerate more risk and volatility than you 
need simply for the sake of potentially higher returns. Strive to plan for 
enough — not more — and your investments won’t be cause for sleep-
less nights.
These three perspectives together make up your risk profile. Your portfolio 
design should be based on the lowest level of volatility indicated by these 
three elements.

Create a Portfolio You 
Can Grow and Consume
By Katherine Holden, ChFC, CFP
C
reating a financial portfolio may feel daunting. A portfolio that’s 
designed for simultaneous savings and withdrawals is challenging to put 
together, but growing a portfolio and consuming a portfolio at the same time 
is possible. The key is to divide your portfolio into sections that are depen-
dent on when you’ll need the funds.
Develop Goals with Varying Time Periods
Investment goals are generally either short-term or long-term. For a short-
term goal, you save and invest money to be used within one to five years. In 
this situation, you want to grow your savings, but you’re equally concerned 
about protecting what you’re putting away because you’ll need to spend it 
within a short time. You have much less tolerance for risk in your investment 
choices.
Longer-term goals may be 10 or 30 years in the future, so you’ll be setting 
aside money regularly, growing it, and then using it either all at once or over 
a period of time. Your goal may be to save a sizeable down payment to buy 
a house; you’ll use all your savings at one time in this scenario. You may 
choose to assume a higher level of risk because you have more time to reach 
your goal. But the closer you get to your goal, the less risk you want to take.
Or your goal may be to put money away for your children’s college educa-
tion. You’ll be saving over 18 to 22 years if you start at the birth of each child, 
and you’ll likely spend those savings over four to eight or ten years (depend-
ing on how many children you have).

167
 #39: Create a Portfolio You Can Grow and Consume
Create the Portfolios
This strategy offers you four examples of short-term versus long-term goals 
to show you how investment choices may vary. Suppose you want to pur-
chase a refrigerator, buy a car, save a down payment for a house, and fund a 
two-year trip around the world 20 years from now. You can reach these goals 
by investing the money differently for each.
 
Start with a list of the items you want to purchase or fund and prioritize them. 
These are your goals. Prioritizing your goals helps you decide which goals 
to fund and which ones to delay funding when you experience tough financial 
times.
Think about the cost of each goal and your time frame for each. You may
 
 Use one account to save for all four goals.
 
 Use several accounts based on the time to complete your goals.
 
 Use separate accounts for each goal.
Be sure to consider the account and transaction fees that your brokerage firm 
charges. Using one account for all four goals may end up being confusing when 
you try to track what amount and which investments are linked to each goal.
Goal #1: Save $1,200 for a fridge in a year
 
For money you need soon, carefully choose the savings vehicle. Avoid stocks! 
If the stock market is down, you won’t have the funds you need for the pur-
chase.
Consider an FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insured account, 
such as a savings or money market account, at a bank or credit union. 
Accounts are insured up to $100,000 per depositor; individual and joint 
accounts are insured separately. Or you can use a money market mutual 
fund, which isn’t insured (see Strategy #17 for more information). Research 
interest rates at bankrate.com.
If the refrigerator you want to buy in a year currently costs $1,200, how much 
should you save per month? Here’s how it breaks down:
Ultra Short-Term Savings
You need $1,248 ($1,200 adjusted for one year of 4 percent inflation).
Save $100/month (assuming a return of 3 percent).

168
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
You’re primarily saving for this purchase out of your current income while 
earning only a small return on your savings. But your focus is on preserving 
your savings because you’ll be using it all on this purchase.
Goal #2: Save $5,000 for a deposit on a 
car in three years
Because you don’t need the money in this example for three years, you may 
be willing to accept a slight risk, although there’s no guarantee you’ll be 
rewarded with a higher return. After evaluating the current bond market, you 
could invest in a short-term high-quality bond mutual fund for the first two 
years. Then transfer your savings and contributions to a money market fund 
for the last 12 months. How much should you save per month?
Short-Term Savings
You need $5,624 ($5,000 adjusted for three years of 4-percent inflation).
Save $138/month (assuming a 4.45-percent return compounded monthly).
 
Set up an automatic withdrawal from your checking account into your car–
down payment account. It’ll save you time and ensure you save every month.
You’re still funding the majority of the car down payment from your cur-
rent income, but you’re also trying to achieve a small amount of growth by 
accepting a small amount of risk. If uncertainty in the economy creeps in, you 
may want to transfer your savings to a money market account sooner.
Goal #3: Save $60,000 for a down pay-
ment on a house in ten years
Because the time period in this house example is longer than in the previous 
examples, you can take on more risk with diversified investments in large- 
and small-cap value equities, international equities (developed countries), 
short- and intermediate-term high quality bonds, and real estate mutual 
funds. Be sure to diversify and not limit yourself to one or two holdings.
Long-Term Savings
You need $88,815 ($60,000 adjusted for ten years of 4-percent inflation).
Save $406/month (assuming a diversified portfolio with approximately 50 
percent equity and 50 percent fixed income with an average annual rate 
of return of 8 percent).

169
 #39: Create a Portfolio You Can Grow and Consume
As with the first two goals, you’ll use all your savings at one time when making 
the down payment. So you may choose to get more conservative with your 
investment choices when you’re two to three years away from your goal. 
Monitor economic forecasts on a regular basis so you can make adjustments to 
a more conservative allocation if things are becoming more uncertain.
Goal #4: Save $300,000 for a two-year 
world trip in 20 years
Because you won’t need the funds in this world-trip example for 20 years, you 
can assume even more risk with a diversified portfolio of large- and small-
cap value and growth equities, international equities (developed countries), 
short- and intermediate-term investment-grade and government bonds, and 
real estate mutual funds.
Extra Long-Term Savings
You need $657,337 ($300,000 adjusted for 20 years of 4-percent inflation).
Save $755/month (assuming a diversified portfolio with approximately 60 
percent equity and 40 percent fixed income with an average annual rate 
of return of 9 percent).
This goal differs from the first three because you’ll be using your savings 
over a period of two years to fund your travel and living expenses. As with 
Goal #3, you may choose to use a more conservative allocation when you’re 
within a couple of years of meeting your goal. When you’re consuming your 
savings, you’ll want to continue to pursue a conservative amount of growth 
and keep a certain percentage of your portfolio available as cash. Because 
this goal covers 20 years, you can be almost certain of experiencing eco-
nomic ups and downs. Track what’s happening with the economy on a regu-
lar basis. Good, sound investing practices can help you ride out the down 
periods.
Altogether, the examples show setting aside $1,399 each month for the first 
year. As you achieve each goal, the savings you need per month drops, allow-
ing for additional goals. For the long-term goals, remember to make your 
asset allocation more conservative in the last several years.

Allocate Your Assets to 
Minimize Risk
By Deidra Fulton, CFP
B
uilding a portfolio is like cooking: You start with several basic ingredi-
ents, and the way you combine them can lead to something delicious or 
a hard, inedible mess. You may use all your ingredients or only a few. Or you 
may use most of them but in varying amounts. This strategy describes how 
to best allocate your assets for the most appetizing result: maximum returns 
with minimum risk.
Combine Asset Classes
Multiple asset classes in your portfolio can improve returns and decrease 
volatility. Large-cap U.S. stocks, real estate, and bonds are a few examples of 
different asset classes.
 
Here are some ideas about asset classes to keep in mind:
 
 Different asset classes perform differently during the same time period. 
When large-cap stocks are performing poorly, performance results from 
bonds may be stellar.
 
 You can’t predict the best- and worst-performing asset class. Investment 
results are unpredictable — as is life! Over the last 30 years, all asset 
classes have had their day and then some.
 
 Combining multiple asset classes can help reduce risk within a portfolio; how-
ever, risk can’t be totally eliminated. Losses will occur occasionally. The goal 
for a well-diversified portfolio is that losses be small and infrequent.
If you diversify by investing across multiple asset classes, you needn’t worry 
about which asset class is the best performer this week or this month. Here’s 
how to get the best combination.

171
 #40: Allocate Your Assets to Minimize Risk
Look for low correlation
Good investors seek asset classes with low correlation to each other. 
Correlation is a measure of the relationship, if any, between the returns of 
different asset classes. If they move in the same direction, they’re positively 
correlated; asset classes that move in opposite directions are negatively cor-
related.
In Table 40-1, the higher the number, the stronger the correlation. You can 
see from this table that large-cap stocks are most closely correlated with 
small-cap stocks, because they generally move in the same market direction.
Note that large-cap stocks are positively correlated with every other asset 
category in Table 40-1. However, this isn’t the case with all other asset 
classes. For example, international stocks and small-cap stocks are negatively 
correlated with intermediate government bonds and Treasury bills, though in 
varying degrees.
 
Using combinations of asset classes that have low or negative correlation 
with most other holdings within a portfolio should improve performance and 
reduce volatility.

Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
Watch out for asset class volatility
Keep in mind that some asset classes are more volatile than others. Their 
potential for higher returns can be appealing, yet those higher returns also 
bring greater potential for major losses. Think of this cooking metaphor: A 
little chile pepper can add a wonderful taste, but too much of it can ruin the 
dish. So it is with investing. Use the more volatile asset classes sparingly.
Consider your time horizon
Generally speaking, the shorter the time horizon, the more conservative the 
investments should be because you have less time to recover from a market 
downturn. For example, if your son will be entering college in two years and 
you’ve saved $50,000 for college expenses, you should keep the majority of 
that $50,000 in less volatile holdings, such as cash or bonds.
If you leave the majority of the $50,000 in aggressive stock holdings, your risk 
is much greater because your funds will be subject to much higher volatil-
ity and declining values during that two-year period. The value of the funds 
could decrease just at the time you need the money.

Rebalance Your Asset Allocation
By Deidra Fulton, CFP
R
ebalancing is the process of modifying subsequent allocations back to 
target weightings. In its simplest form, rebalancing involves selling some 
of the holdings in asset classes that have become overweighted and using the 
proceeds for buying additional holdings in underweighted categories.
Reasons to Rebalance
Asset classes perform differently over given time periods, just as do indi-
vidual investments. When the economy is performing well and credit is easily 
attainable, smaller and mid-sized capitalization companies may perform 
especially well. Large-cap companies — with their stronger balance sheets 
and greater diversification — may have the edge during periods with tighter 
credit and greater economic uncertainty. Bonds may hold a distinct advan-
tage during recessionary periods. And international stocks may have an edge 
during periods when the domestic economy is pressured.
Here’s why you should rebalance:
 
 Distorted allocations: Initially established asset allocations may become 
distorted over time and need occasional adjustments.
 
 Risk: Balanced diversification can help minimize risk. Although it’s 
tempting to let a high flyer remain unbridled, doing so increases risk in 
the long run.
 
 Improved returns over time: Rebalancing helps minimize your portfo-
lio’s overall risk and improve returns over time.
You can choose one of several criteria as a standard for rebalancing:
 
 Time period: This method uses some predetermined interval of the cal-
endar as the trigger for rebalancing, typically quarterly, semiannually, 
or annually. Asset class allocations are adjusted back to original target 
weightings at the selected calendar interval.

174
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
 
 Absolute percentage weighting: This method employs a simple stan-
dard for making future modifications: Rebalance at any point in the 
future when the actual asset class weightings have shifted from the 
original target allocations. Note that this method may result in almost 
constant rebalancing of your holdings — not to mention incurring higher 
trading costs — due to the continual movement of markets as a whole.
 
 Tolerance window range: This method allows for some judgment in 
deciding whether to rebalance. For example, you may have a threshold 
of 3 percent as your criteria for a tolerance window. If the weighting 
is more than 3 percent above or below your target weighting, you 
rebalance.
 
 Combination: For example, you can combine both a percentage toler-
ance window and an annual calendar interval. In that case, you may 
rebalance once a year if any holding is more than 3 percent off the origi-
nal target.
Ways to Rebalance
There’s no single correct approach for rebalancing. Regardless of the rebal-
ancing method you use, you need to regularly review and adjust your port-
folio’s asset allocations to maintain proper diversification and reduce risk. 
Here are some common methods:
 
 Sell and purchase: Sell your overweighted investments and purchase 
underweighted ones.
 
 Withdraw or invest: Take regular withdrawals from overweighted cat-
egories or direct future investments to underweighted asset classes.
 
 Redirect: Redirect payouts, such as dividends or capital gain distribu-
tions, from holdings in overweighted asset classes to investments in 
underweighted asset categories.
 
During an uncertain economy, thinking about rebalancing may be even more 
difficult. Your gut instincts may be to cut and run. But to make money in the 
long term, it’s essential to stick to the discipline. When the stock market is fall-
ing rapidly, selling bonds and buying stocks may just be the right thing to do 
because suddenly your portfolio is more heavily weighted in bonds and stocks 
are relatively cheap. Conversely, when the stock market is soaring, it’s time 
to sell off some of your winners and buy bonds. Remember the old adage: Buy 
low and sell high. Sticking to the rebalancing discipline can help you accumu-
late wealth and hang on to it.

175
 #41: Rebalance Your Asset Allocation 
An Example of Rebalancing in Action
This section presents an example of rebalancing. Suppose your target asset 
class allocations are the following:
 
 Large cap stocks: 30 percent
 
 Small cap stocks: 15 percent
 
 International stocks: 25 percent
 
 Long-term government bonds: 5 percent
 
 Intermediate-term government bonds: 10 percent
 
 U.S. Treasury bills: 15 percent
Assume you invested $100,000 at the beginning of 2005 and you rebalance 
annually, using a 3-percent tolerance window. Table 41-1 shows your original 
asset category weightings and the amounts invested by asset class.

Diversify Your Stock 
Portfolio by Size
By David McPherson
Y
ou can break down stocks into an almost endless number of categories. 
You can find growth stocks and value stocks, blue chips and orphans, 
industrials and financials. The list goes on and on. But the basic starting 
point is market capitalization, or size; that is, how much is a company worth? 
How big is it?
Using the market-capitalization measure, stocks are categorized into three 
broad groups: large caps, mid caps, and small caps. These terms frequently 
appear in the names of mutual funds that focus on particular segments of the 
stock market.
In this strategy, you look at one of the best ways to ease the uncertainty of 
investing in good times and bad: being sure your portfolio includes portions 
of large caps, mid caps, and small caps. This type of diversification can help 
you capture the strong performance of one category and offset the declines 
in another. For most individual investors, the best way to diversify by cap 
size is through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rather than 
individual stocks. (See Strategy #21 for info on mutual funds; Strategy #23 
discusses ETFs.)
Know the Market Cap Categories
The market-capitalization measure that people use to categorize stocks as 
large caps, mid caps, or small caps is a simple calculation that involves mul-
tiplying the number of outstanding shares in a company by the price of a 
single share. For example, a company with 100 million shares worth $10 each 
has a market capitalization of $1 billion.

179
 #42: Diversify Your Stock Portfolio by Size
In defining market cap categories, different institutions use different stan-
dards that can change with market conditions. But in general, sizes are 
defined in the following manner:
 
 Large cap: These stocks represent the largest companies trading on 
Wall Street and usually feature companies with market capitalization 
of $5 billion or more. They include some of the best-known compa-
nies in the United States, such as General Electric, Microsoft, and 
Bank of America. They also include lesser known companies such as 
Schlumberger Ltd., an oil-field services company, and Avery Dennison 
Corp., a label maker.
 
 This category accounts for about three-quarters of the overall U.S. 
stock market in terms of value. A frequently used gauge of U.S. large cap 
stocks is the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, or S&P 500.
 
 Mid cap: This category encompasses stocks that fall within a market 
capitalization range of $2 billion to $5 billion. Though considered 
medium size by Wall Street, a number of nationally known companies 
such as 3Com Corp., American Eagle Outfitters, and Netflix, Inc., are mid 
caps. Mid cap benchmarks include the Standard & Poor’s MidCap 400 
Index and the Russell Midcap Index.
 
 Small cap: This group encompasses publicly traded companies with 
market capitalizations of less than $2 billion. Though they account for 
only about 10 percent of the U.S. stock market in dollar value, small 
caps make up the majority of the nation’s publicly traded companies. 
Chances are you recognize few of the names on this list — they include 
U.S. Concrete, Inc., Kosan Biosciences, Inc., and Illumina, Inc.
 
 A subcategory of small caps known as micro caps makes up the smallest 
of the small in terms of market capitalization. The definition of a micro 
cap varies widely, with some people starting at a market capitalization 
of $500 million or less. Others use a $100 million starting point. Either 
way, these are the riskiest of stocks and are best avoided by most indi-
vidual investors. Many micro caps qualify as penny stocks because their 
shares regularly trade for less than $1.
Get the Right Mix in Your Portfolio
Different types of investors may be drawn to one category over another based 
on the traits of large caps, mid caps, and small caps, particularly in times of 
market turmoil. See Table 42-1 to see how the stock categories compare.

Under most circumstances, you should own a little bit of each category to 
counter the uncertainty that surrounds money and markets. The right mix 
of large caps, mid caps, and small caps depends on your risk tolerance, 
goals, and circumstances. Traditional asset allocation models call for higher 
portions of large caps and smaller portions of mid and small caps. More-
aggressive investors who seek higher returns and can withstand the volatility 
may want to allocate larger shares to mid caps and small caps.
 
If you’re seeking diversification and simplicity at the same time, consider a 
total stock market fund or an extended market index fund. A total stock market 
fund invests in large, mid, and small caps in proportion to their overall repre-
sentation in the market — that is, large caps make up about 75 percent of the 
fund. An extended market fund replicates the mid and small cap markets in a 
single fund but leaves out the large cap companies. Both options reduce the 
number of holdings needed to diversify your portfolio and simplify the invest-
ing process. The trade-off is that you have less flexibility in overweighting or 
underweighting a given category.

Diversify Your Stock Portfolio 
by Valuation
By David Anderson, CFA
I
n uncertain times, which is better — growth investing or value investing? 
Everyone agrees that the purchase price of an investment ought to repre-
sent good value; that is, the anticipated return should justify the associated 
risk. However, good value doesn’t have a universal definition; it becomes 
obvious only after the fact.
Undaunted, the ever intrepid consultants divide the universe of investment 
managers into three style categories: value, growth, and a combination of 
the two labeled blend or core. This strategy explains how value and growth 
investing compares and advises you on how to protect yourself from manic 
changes in the market.
Value versus Growth: Taking 
Lessons from History
So what’s the difference between value and growth investors?
 
 Value investors generally look backward at history. They examine 
financial statements to estimate an intrinsic value of a stock and com-
pare it to the current price. If the current price is significantly lower 
than the estimated intrinsic value, the value investor purchases the 
stock, anticipating that other investors will recognize the disparity 
and their purchases will drive up the market price so that it equals or 
exceeds the estimated intrinsic value. The fly in the ointment is getting 
everyone to agree on the definition of intrinsic value.
 
 Growth investors look forward. They postulate that companies growing 
at above-average rates will provide above-average returns. Generally, 
the higher the anticipated growth rate, the more investors are willing to 
pay. The fly in their ointment is the realization of that growth. For the 
stock price to appreciate, the company has to achieve the growth 
expectations.

183
#43: Diversify Your Stock Portfolio by Valuation
 
 A growth investor’s most disconcerting moment is discovering that 
a stock declined 10 percent in one day because the company’s earn-
ings missed analysts’ forecasts by 5 cents. Wiping out 10 percent of 
the market value for such a minor shortfall seems awfully excessive. 
However, the strong reaction suggests that investors believe the com-
pany’s growth rate has hit a turning point and will begin to slow.
A value stock’s earnings typically fluctuate with the economy; these stocks 
tend to do well when the economy is accelerating out of a recession. Growth 
stocks are expected to be impervious to economic fluctuations. However, 
what makes economic sense can be trumped by Wall Street’s propensity for 
manias. Read on.
Growth manias
Wall Street’s mantra is “anything worth doing is worth overdoing,” and 
growth versus value is no exception. In the uncertain times of the last 40 
years, growth-stock investing has twice been taken to extremes. In the early 
1970s, Wall Street became enamored with one-decision stocks: Companies 
such as IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid were projected to grow at above-average 
rates indefinitely, and analysts believed that stock valuation was irrelevant. 
Investors merely had to make the one decision to purchase and hold. Of 
course, they were blindsided by the 1970s inflation that drove up expenses 
faster than revenues. Rather than growing, profits declined and so did stock 
prices, as much as 80 to 90 percent in many cases.
In the second episode of growth stock mania, the advent of the Internet 
drove huge demands for technology products. On top of that, as the year 
2000 approached, corporations had to deal with the dreaded Y2K issue 
and the fear of global software malfunctions. It was a perfect storm for the 
demand of technology products and services. However, January 1, 2000, 
came and went, leaving behind a tremendous supply of unneeded products 
and services. The result? Stock price declines of 80 to 90 percent for many.
Value manias
Value stocks aren’t immune to manias. The value sector contains a large per-
centage of bank and financial services stocks. The inflation of the 1970s gen-
erated a lot of real estate lending by banks and savings and loans. However, 
when Congress shortened the real estate depreciation schedules in 1986, 
many real estate projects became untenable. Stock prices of major banks 
declined as much as 75 percent from 1989 to 1990.

184
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
Because value-oriented stocks sat out the growth stock mania of the late 
1990s, they didn’t have major gains to surrender in the bear market of 2000 
to 2002. However, they made up for it by funding the mania in housing prices 
from 2004 to 2007. After the marginal buyers were sucked in with teaser 
adjustable-rate mortgages, no was one left to buy. Supply overwhelmed 
demand, which in turn started the decline in home prices. Financial panic 
ensued when bonds backed by shaky mortgages turned bad as housing 
prices declined. Again, stock prices declined dramatically.
However, one segment of the value-oriented universe did extremely well 
through the housing debacle of 2007 to 2008. Energy and commodity prices 
soared beyond anyone’s wildest expectations. Ten years ago, the price of oil 
was scraping $10 per barrel. The low prices of the late 1990s caused oil com-
panies to de-emphasize finding new energy sources because of the low return 
on investment. But as demand from emerging nations such as China and 
India increased, supply couldn’t keep up with demand, and energy and com-
modity prices skyrocketed along with their associated stock. But high energy 
prices sow the seeds of their own decline. At some point, the economic dislo-
cations caused by higher energy prices will overwhelm the growth in demand 
for energy, and prices will decline. The only question is when.
Find the Right Balance 
and Avoid Manias
 
Should you invest in growth funds or value funds in uncertain times? 
Fortunately, you don’t have to choose one over the other. Managing your port-
folio can be a matter of shifting the emphasis as you participate in growth and 
value funds as well as blended funds:
 
 Emphasize growth funds when economic growth is slowing.
 
 Emphasize value funds when the economy begins to accelerate. These 
periods are usually accompanied by a steep yield curve, when short-
term interest rates are much lower than long-term rates. Banks are a 
large component of the value sector, so a steep yield curve usually pre-
cedes higher bank profits.
 
How do you approach the value-growth question and protect yourself from 
manias? Here are some guidelines:

185
#43: Diversify Your Stock Portfolio by Valuation
 
 When purchasing either kind of fund, examine how well the current 
portfolio manager navigated debacles of the past. Keep in mind, how-
ever, that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results.
 
 Don’t believe the hype. Exercise common sense. Investment manage-
ment is a closed world, and managers feed off of one another. When an 
investment theme looks extreme, head for the exits; if it looks too good 
to be true, it probably is.
 
 Read a mutual fund’s annual and semiannual reports to get a sense of 
the fund management’s thinking. Watch out for language that echoes 
some of the more hyperbolic language used by the talking heads on the 
business news channels.
 
 Examine a fund’s holdings for style drift. In the late 1990s, value man-
agers suffered because their funds were dramatically underperform-
ing their growth counterparts. In desperation, value managers added 
growth stocks to improve performance. Unfortunately, many did this at 
the market peak, which caused their value funds to decline like a growth 
fund in the following bear market. Value funds that remained true to 
their style performed much better in the bear market of 2000 to 2002.
 
In all cases, develop your own investment policy with a target asset mix based 
on your tolerance for risk (see Strategy #38 for information on assessing your 
risk tolerance). Rebalance your portfolio when asset-class weightings expe-
rience significant gains and declines. The decision to emphasize growth or 
value stocks or funds should be only a nuance in a long-term strategy of diver-
sification that matches your investing goals with your risk tolerance.

Diversify Your Stock Portfolio 
by Country
By Corry Sheffler, MBA, CFP, CFE
T
oday’s investment world probably isn’t the same as it was for your 
parents. You live in a global economy, as reflected in your investment 
options.
Domestic markets are the equity investments in your own country, and for-
eign markets are all the equity investments found outside your country. This 
strategy shows you ways to diversify your investment portfolio by investing 
in foreign markets.
Get Your Feet Wet in Foreign Waters
A global portfolio is a more diversified portfolio, so over time, it tempers 
your overall volatility. Being globally diversified in troubled economic times 
is especially important because when the U.S. market is struggling, other 
markets are often soaring. For example, while the domestic U.S. stocks 
soared during the late 1990s, many foreign markets were in the doldrums. 
Conversely, while U.S. stocks languished or returned less than double-digit 
gains from 2003 to 2007, foreign markets had outstanding performance. 
Portfolios that lacked foreign stocks lagged far behind those that did. 
Diversification and rebalancing are the perfect way to ensure that, on aver-
age, you’re buying low and selling high.
Here are several ways to gain exposure to countries outside the United States:
 
 Invest in multinational companies.
 
 Invest directly in the stocks of foreign countries.
 
 Buy mutual funds that invest in foreign stocks.
 
 Buy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that specialize in non-U.S. markets. 
(For info on ETFs, see Strategy #23.)
 
 Buy global funds that invest in domestic U.S. as well as non-U.S. equities.

187
 #44: Diversify Your Stock Portfolio by Country
 
For most people, investing in these markets through mutual funds and ETFs is 
best. If you don’t have the time to research your mutual funds, consider hiring 
a fee-only financial planner to help you decide — or rely entirely on index 
funds. Also see Strategy #40 for more on tempering risk.
Decide How Much to Invest
How much of your investment portfolio should be in non-U.S. equities? To 
make this decision, do the following:
 
 Determine what portion of your total portfolio should be in equities in 
general.
 
 Determine your personal risk tolerance.
 
 Accept that by investing in foreign markets, you’ll be taking on more 
short-term risk.
 
 Realize that you’re taking on some currency risk because the total 
return on foreign investments includes not only the underlying invest-
ment but also the foreign currency exchange gains or losses during the 
investment holding period.
 
For the stock portion of your portfolio, experts vary in their opinions on how 
much of your investments should be domestic or foreign. Still, depending on 
your stage in life, a good rule of thumb is to invest between 10 and 15 percent 
of your portfolio in non-U.S. equities.
Diversify within Your Foreign Allocation
Just as in your domestic investments, you want to have the appropriate allo-
cations between large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap investments. Here are a 
variety of ways to go:
 
 Invest in funds that specialize in an individual country, such as Canada, 
China, or Japan.
 
 Invest in funds that specialize in regions like Latin America or Europe, 
Australasia, and the Far East (EAFE) (Note: Australasia includes Australia 
and New Zealand.)
 
 Invest in an investment fund or ETF that captures a good part of foreign 
markets, such as a total market index or a World (Excluding U.S.) SPDR 
(Standard & Poor’s Depository Receipt).

188
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
In foreign markets, investing in both developed and emerging markets is also 
important. Think of this as the difference between domestic large-cap and 
small-cap stocks:
 
 Developed markets: Like large-cap domestic stocks, developed mar-
kets are more established than emerging markets. Developed markets 
are considered less risky than emerging markets. Examples include 
Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
 
 Emerging markets: Emerging markets are more like the rapid-growth 
domestic small-cap stocks. Emerging market stocks are newer to the 
global investing scene. Examples include Mexico, South Korea, and 
Taiwan.
 
The bulk of your foreign investments should be in developed markets, with a 
small percentage, perhaps 2 to 5 percent, in emerging markets. Like country-
specific or regional markets, developed and emerging market stocks can be 
bought individually, through mutual funds, or through ETFs.

Diversify Your Portfolio by Industry
By Robert Friedland, PhD
W
hen buying a share of stock in a company, you buy into a particular 
industry. For a well-diversified stock portfolio, consider not only the 
size, valuation, and geographical coverage of the companies (see Strategies 
#42, #43, and #44) but also the industries. A portfolio of large and small capi-
talized firms allocated nicely between growth and value stocks in the same 
industry does little to diversify a portfolio. Predicting which industries will 
best weather an economic storm is nearly impossible, so the best long-term 
strategy is a portfolio broadly diversified across industries.
Industry: A Concept of Shared Risks
An industry reflects the collection of businesses that comprise a particular 
sector of the economy. The sector includes competitors of the firm in which 
you own stock and many related companies, such as companies that sell to 
and buy from the company whose stock you own.
An industry reflects a group of different businesses whose financial fortune 
or demise is likely linked. These links may be in shared labor markets, related 
regulations, a common purpose, or a shared technology. Hence, changes in 
technology, government regulations, or the marketplace may fundamentally 
change the business of the company you own.
 
Industry boundaries aren’t straightforward. More importantly, many compa-
nies do business in more than one industry. Many automobile manufacturers, 
for example, are also in the financial services industry. A few automobile man-
ufacturers also make jet engines. At least one jet engine company also makes 
medical equipment.

190
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
Understand the Industry Life Cycle
Industries, as well as the firms in them, evolve and change. Major evolution-
ary leaps are often marked by a technological or scientific advancement. 
Rapid growth within the industry often follows. Eventually, industry-wide 
growth may decline. Finally, the industry reaches a period of maturity and 
sometimes overall decline. Of course, firms enter the industry at different 
stages in the life cycle, so there can be considerable diversification of size 
and valuation among different firms in the same industry.
Products of some industries are vulnerable to the normal movements of the 
overall economy. Industries that move in the same direction with the econ-
omy are considered cyclical. Industries that move in the opposite direction 
are considered countercyclical. The extent to which an industry is cyclical or 
countercyclical creates a relationship between the stock price and the busi-
ness cycle.
Use Sector Funds to Add 
Exposure to an Industry
Adding exposure to a particular industry sector is easier than ever. By pur-
chasing either a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on a 
specific sector (see Strategies #21 and #23), you gain concentrated exposure 
to an industry through one investment. Often called sector funds, specialty 
funds, or single industry funds, they provide a cost-efficient and effective 
avenue for buying a large number of companies within a specific industry. 
Purchasing or selling sector funds enables someone with an already diversi-
fied portfolio to quickly add or reduce exposure to a specific sector.
 
Sector funds alone aren’t well-diversified investments. A single event affecting 
the industry may quickly decrease the value of the sector fund. However, the 
volatility of a sector fund is likely to be less than the volatility of just one or 
two companies in that industry sector.
Know How Sectors Fit into 
the Economic Cycle
The inevitable contractions in the economy result in loss of employment for 
many and fear of job loss for many more. Fortunately, every contraction has 
been followed by an expansion, which means new jobs, less fear of losing 

191
 #45: Diversify Your Portfolio by Industry
a job, and less anxiety about spending to replace durable goods or expand 
inventory or equipment. These contractions and expansions cause stock 
prices to rise and fall.
Many investors manage their portfolios by moving in and out of certain 
industry sectors based on their assessment of the economic cycle. Their 
goal is to buy at the low point of a contraction and sell at the high point of an 
expansion:
 
1. When they believe the market has bottomed out, they buy in the finan-
cial and transportation industries when those industries are at their 
expected lows and expansion is on the horizon.
 
2. As the economy improves and heads toward a peak, the capital goods 
industries appreciate.
 
3. Soon thereafter, the basic industries appreciate, followed by precious 
metals and the energy sector.
 
4. At the peak, the only way to go is down into a contraction! Now, noncyc-
lical and consumer goods — such as food, cosmetics, and healthcare — 
look good.
 
5. As the economy moves deeper into contraction, utility and consumer 
cyclical sector goods look more attractive — until just about the time 
the economy hits the bottom and the cycle begins anew.
Unfortunately, knowing just where the economy is in the business cycle isn’t 
easy. People can speculate, sound knowledgeable, and even be correct about 
it by accident. Knowing when the economy has hit the peak or the bottom is 
like driving on a road you’ve never seen before while looking in the rearview 
mirror. You can easily see where you came from, but knowing what lies 
ahead is impossible.
 
If you buy individual stocks, buy companies in industries you understand. If 
you buy mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, pay attention to your portfo-
lio’s overall allocation to a given industry.

Diversify Your Bond Portfolio
By Jennifer Luzzatto, CFA, CFP
M
ost investors can best buy the bond portion of their portfolios by 
purchasing bond mutual funds. Because the best prices on bonds are 
usually in very large increments (think $1,000,000 per purchase), individuals 
benefit from being able to participate in a pool of professionally managed 
funds invested in the bond market. (For information on individual bonds, see 
Strategy #27.) Your approach to diversifying your bond portfolio depends 
upon whether you’re in the accumulation phase or the retirement phase of 
your life.
 
Bond fund returns are especially sensitive to the fees of mutual funds because 
they typically don’t see the high returns of stock funds. Keep an eye out for 
expense ratios of less than 0.30 percent.
Advice for Early- and 
Mid-Life Accumulators
Early- and mid-life accumulators can benefit from exposure to all parts of the 
bond market. Because of their long time horizon, they don’t have to be as 
defensive against hard times in the investment cycle. An early accumulator 
should invest bond money as follows:
 
 Short-term bond fund: 35 percent
 
 Intermediate-term bond fund: 35 percent
 
 Inflation-protected securities: 20 percent
 
 High-yield bonds: 10 percent
Different sources define short-, intermediate-, and long-term differently. But 
generally, short-term bonds have maturity dates of five years or less, intermediate-
term bonds have maturities of five to ten years, and long-term bonds have stated 
maturities that are longer than ten years. Inflation-protected securities are a 
relatively new type of security and are generally called TIPS (Treasury Inflation 

193
 #46: Diversify Your Bond Portfolio
Protected Securities — see Strategy #18). High-yield bonds are usually less cred-
itworthy, which means they have to pay a higher rate to attract investors. These 
investments are riskier, but they can be appropriate for accumulators because 
the long-term horizons can temper the risk.
In this section, you discover how to allocate your bond investment if you 
have ten or more years until retirement.
Let returns and volatility direct allocation
Standard deviation is one way of measuring the volatility of bonds and other 
securities. A standard deviation of 4 percent means that historically, the 
actual returns of a given security class have ranged from 4 percent below the 
category average to 4 percent higher. The lower the standard deviation, the 
lower the volatility and therefore the lower the market risk.
Table 46-1 shows that shorter-term bonds have lower volatility and that long-
term, mortgage, and high-yield bonds have greater volatility. For a long time 
horizon, an ideal allocation is a blend of short-term bonds, intermediate-term 
bonds, and in some cases, mortgage bonds.

As an individual investor, you don’t get enough additional return from pur-
chasing long-term bonds over intermediate-term bonds, given the dramatic 
rise in volatility for long-term bonds. Long-term bonds are generally better 
suited for businesses such as insurance companies that need to match the 
maturities of their assets with their liabilities. High-yield bonds can at times 
be appropriate in an individual portfolio, but their risk and return profile fits 
more into a stock allocation than bond allocation.

194
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
Set up an ideal allocation among bonds
For most investors, an appropriate bond allocation puts equal amounts of 
money in short-term and intermediate-term bonds, as Table 46-2 shows.

Unless you need to invest in tax-exempt bonds, the short- and intermediate-
term bond funds should be invested in Treasuries, agencies, corporate bonds, 
and mortgages. You want exposure to all parts of the bond market with these 
funds. (For info on government bonds and Treasuries, see Strategy #18.)
Table 46-3 shows a slightly more aggressive bond allocation that includes 
mortgage bonds. If mortgage bonds are appropriate for your portfolio given 
your risk profile, Government National Mortgage Association bonds, or 
GNMA bonds (sometimes referred to as Ginnie Maes), are preferable. GNMA 
is a U.S. federal government agency that issues bonds to fund housing loans. 
Other government agencies issue bonds, but only GNMA bonds are backed 
by the full faith and credit of the U.S. federal government. This makes them 
similar in credit quality to Treasury bonds, although their coupon (the 
amount of interest paid) and maturity structure is different.

 #46: Diversify Your Bond Portfolio
 
If you go aggressive and invest in high-yield bonds, remember that high-yield 
bonds tend to be the most volatile. When times get rough, hold off allocating 
more money to these bonds until the storm begins to blow over. It’s impos-
sible to know when things may turn around, so don’t abandon your high-yield 
funds completely — just don’t add new funds until the crisis of the day is no 
longer on the front page.
Bond quality
The quality of the bond also affects bond volatility. The higher the bond 
is rated, the less sensitive it’ll be to uncertain economic times. Table 46-4 
explains the ratings of two of the largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s 
and Moody’s.
If you’re an accumulator with a higher risk tolerance and a number of years 
before retirement, some lower-quality bonds may be appropriate. The higher 
yield and growth opportunities of lower-rated bonds come at the expense 
of more risk. If you’re an investor with a shorter time frame, this risk may 
be unacceptable, so your mixture of bonds should tend toward the higher-
quality side.

Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
Advice for Almost-Retirees and Retirees
If you plan to retire in about one to three years, your time horizon is a bit 
shorter, but by no means short! Inflation may be your biggest enemy because 
the cost of living will most likely exceed your income after a few years of 
retirement. Stocks and stock funds can help take care of the dreaded effects 
of inflation, but you should use your bond portfolio to hold down the vola-
tility of the overall portfolio. Thus, you need to be a bit more conservative. 
Your bond portfolio should look like this:
 
 Short-term bond fund: 45 percent
 
 Intermediate-term bond fund: 35 percent
 
 Inflation-protected securities: 20 percent
This bond allocation should be sustainable throughout most of your retire-
ment years. After it’s clear you’re in your final years and that your current 
assets will sustain you for the rest of your life, a 100-percent short-term bond 
allocation is advisable.
 
Short-term bond funds suffer the least in turbulent times. So if in doubt, go 
short! But remember that you may be giving up growth or yield if you put too 
much in or stay in the short-term arena too long.

Diversify Your Portfolio with 
Alternative Vehicles
By Kevin O’Reilly
I
n unpredictable times, knowing that your portfolio is well-diversified is 
comforting. So besides diversifying among different flavors of traditional 
investments such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, why not consider dif-
ferent investments altogether? So-called alternative investments can perform 
very differently from stocks and bonds. This strategy discusses some of 
these alternative investments, which span a broad set of choices: Common 
vehicles include real estate, private equity, and hedge funds.
Private Equity: Some Privacy, Please
Most people understand that public companies raise money by issuing stock 
that’s bought and sold on exchanges. Less well-known are the various ways 
that owners of private companies secure capital to grow their businesses. 
They do this through private equity. You have to have significant assets and/
or income to participate in this arena.
Private equity vehicles are generally required by law to accept money only 
from individuals who are accredited investors. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) defines an accredited investor as one of the following:
 
 A person who has individual net worth, or joint net worth with his or her 
spouse, that exceeds $1 million at the time of the purchase
 
 A person with income exceeding $200,000 in each of the two most recent 
years, or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years, 
and a reasonable expectation of the same income level
Investing in private equity can be very lucrative. For example, Table 47-1 
shows historical returns for Thomson Financial’s U.S. Private Equity 
Performance Index (PEPI). However, the range of private equity investments 
is broad, and the return can vary significantly. Investing in this manner can 
be complex and frustrating. A financial advisor can help with the how-to as 
well as suitability issues.

Hedge Your Bets with Hedge Funds
Hedge funds — which are designed to maximize gains while minimizing 
risks — employ many different strategies in pursuit of superior returns. For 
instance, they may be made up of assets that don’t move in the same direc-
tion as traditional investments, or they may be short-selling those assets.
You can’t look at hedge funds as a homogenous asset class, because they’re 
lightly regulated and invest in a broad spectrum of vehicles to meet a wide 
range of objectives. Nonetheless, looking at the overall performance of hedge 
funds over time, they clearly stack up well against more traditional invest-
ments. As Table 47-2 indicates, hedge funds can provide a solid alternative 
during periods of poor stock market performance.

Like private equity (see the preceding section), hedge funds come with steep 
requirements, and you have to be an accredited investor to participate.
Fortunately, one approach brings hedge funds within reach of a broader 
group of investors: the fund of funds (FoF). The managers of these funds of 
funds wade through the sea of hedge fund information to identify a handful of 
hedge funds that, together, may best meet your stated objective. They then 
bundle these various hedge funds into a single investment vehicle, which 
they offer to the public.

199
 #47: Diversify Your Portfolio with Alternative Vehicles
 
Investing in a fund of funds can be very expensive. The underlying hedge 
funds themselves may charge something along the lines of 1 percent plus 20 
percent of the profits of the fund. If you’re investing through a fund of funds, 
the manager of that fund will charge up to 1.5 percent of assets plus 10 percent 
of their profits. Note, however, that despite the high fees, investors who can 
afford to invest in a hedge fund may benefit from the diversification a fund of 
funds provides.
Seek Diversification with Real Estate
Don’t let recent housing market slides scare you away from real estate invest-
ing. Depending on where you invest, long term returns can be attractive. For 
investors who have much of their retirement savings in the stock market 
through an employer’s 401(k) plan or IRAs, real estate investing can offer 
good diversification.
Get in it for the long haul
Single-family rental housing can be a solid hedge against an uncertain 
future — just make sure you view the investment as a long-term proposition. 
If you purchase a rental house tomorrow and the economy experiences a 
period of significant inflation, your investment will likely appreciate at a rate 
at least close to inflation. The rent you collect will also grow with inflation 
while your mortgage payments remain static.
The idea that all real estate is local is a cliché in the industry — and it’s true! 
Even in the recent real estate debacle, some U.S. housing markets rose in 
value. In less extreme examples, it’s common for some markets to rise while 
others fall, regardless of what happens in the overall economy and stock 
market.
Proceed with caution with 
residential real estate
You may have several reasons to think twice about investing in residential 
real estate:
 
 Housing isn’t liquid.
 
 This is a hands-on investment. Houses require maintenance, and rent 
needs collecting. You need to perform upkeep to prepare the house for 
new renters. You can hire a management company to perform these ser-
vices for you, but this expense comes out of your profits.

200
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
 
 Renters are short-term visitors in your house. You can protect yourself 
through security deposits and lease provisions, but it’s unlikely that 
your investment will be treated as gently as if your renters owned it.
 
 Rent checks don’t always arrive as stipulated by the rental contract. 
Sometimes, rent checks bounce. People choose to rent for many differ-
ent reasons, but the fact is that renters are sometimes renters simply 
because they’re unable to buy a home for cash flow and/or credit score 
reasons. You can mitigate these problems by carefully screening rent-
ers, but that’ll reduce your market for potential renters.
If you still think residential real estate investing is for you, check out Real 
Estate Investing For Dummies (Wiley).
Commercialize with corporate buildings
Commercial real estate is an option for real estate investors. Although far 
from certain, rent checks tend to be a bit more reliable coming from estab-
lished corporate entities rather than individuals. Typically, a third party han-
dles management of the property, making the investment easier to deal with 
on a day to day basis. On the other hand, you have to pay for that property 
management, which eats into your returns.
The commercial real estate market is more efficient than the residential 
market. Investments are typically valued based on the capitalization rate 
(cap rate), which is simply the net cash flow divided by the investment cost. 
Prevailing cap rates change over time, but finding bargain prices in commer-
cial real estate is less common than it is in residential properties. In short, 
people buy and sell houses for many different reasons, only some of which 
are profit-oriented; however, profit motive is generally the biggest driver for 
commercial real estate transactions. 
Look to REITs
Perhaps the easiest way to diversify your portfolio with real estate is through 
real estate investment trusts (REITs). Think of REITs as mutual funds that 
invest in real estate. Numerous specialty REITs invest in apartment buildings, 
strip malls, and office buildings.
Historically, REITs haven’t correlated to the stock market. They’ve moved 
in the same direction as equity markets less than 50 percent of the time. See 
Strategy #24 for a more thorough review of investing in REITs and how they 
may fit into your portfolio.

Employ a Conservative Portfolio
By Peggy Creveling, CFA
W
hat is a conservative portfolio? Is it what you need? This strategy 
delves into the building blocks used in designing a conservative port-
folio, highlights the historical returns and risk profile of each component, 
and provides you with guidance on developing a conservative portfolio that’ll 
serve you through all economic climates.
Determine Whether a Conservative 
Portfolio Is Right for You
You should consider a conservative portfolio if the following applies:
 
 You need the money in the next five to ten years. For goals less than 
five years away, you want to avoid exposure to the markets. The risk 
of a loss is too high. Instead, use a money market account, CD, or ultra 
short-term bond fund to finance short-term goals.
 
 You’re unable to bear much risk. If you can’t accept the consequences 
of your investments’ not producing results in the time period needed, 
you can’t bear much risk. For example, a retiree dependent on invest-
ments for essential living expenses can’t accept much risk, but one who 
has covered those living expenses with pensions, Social Security, and/or 
annuities can afford to take more risk.
 
 You’re an inexperienced investor. Almost all people overestimate their 
ability to handle market volatility. If you don’t have much investment 
experience, start conservatively. You’ll be less likely to sell your portfo-
lio when the market drops.
 
 You’re averse to risk (market volatility). If dips in your portfolio keep 
you up at night, stick with a more conservative portfolio. You’ll sleep 
better and be better off than if you were outside your comfort zone.

202
Part III: Demystifying Risk - Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
 
Although less volatile than a more-aggressive portfolio, a conservative portfo-
lio can still produce negative returns in any given year, or in rarer instances, 
for more than one year in a row. And of course, the trade-off for lower volatil-
ity is lesser returns.
Decide Which Asset Classes to Use
An enormous number of asset classes are available. Many, however, don’t 
belong in a conservative portfolio. Table 48-1 gives examples of the more 
traditional asset classes for a variety of increasingly complex portfolios. 
If you’re just starting out, stay with the simple portfolio; as your nest egg 
grows, add additional asset classes as illustrated in the more-complex and 
complex portfolios.

Increasing the number of asset classes potentially increases your long-term 
return while decreasing volatility. After 8 to 12 asset classes, the value of 
adding additional asset classes actually diminishes. You need to weigh the 
additional benefit against the increased management complexity.
Know How Much to Allocate 
to Each Asset Class
The split between fixed income (bonds) and equity (stocks) has the biggest 
impact on the likely long-term returns and volatility. There’s no one right 
answer, but because the goal is a less volatile portfolio, the range for cash 
and fixed income should be about 55 to 80 percent. Equity and alternative 
investments should fill in the remaining 20 to 45 percent.
 
To further lower volatility, consider swapping riskier asset classes (which 
have a higher standard deviation) for less-risky asset classes under the broad 
bond/equity split. For example, use intermediate-term bonds instead of long-
term bonds, large-cap stocks instead of small-cap, and so on.
The following table provides data on various asset classes. Use this informa-
tion to decide how conservative you need or want to be.
 
Consider breaking your investments into a number of mini-portfolios, each 
with an allocation suited for that particular time frame and objective. You’ll 
remove much of the stress of trying to fund a number of diverse goals from 
the same portfolio.

Employ a Moderate Portfolio
By Peggy Creveling, CFA
T
he moderate portfolio shifts up the risk, volatility, and return scale when 
compared with the conservative portfolio, including perhaps more years 
of loss and an increased chance of multi-year losses. The reward for bearing 
more risk is the increased chance of a higher long-term return when com-
pared with the conservative portfolio (refer to Strategy #48). The difference 
between an expected return of 9.94 percent for a moderate portfolio and 8.96 
percent for a more conservative one may not look like much, but it can really 
add up. Figure 49-1 shows the range of possible values that $100,000 invested 
in a moderate and conservative portfolio may earn over time. In the long 
term, the moderate portfolio’s expected or mid value is higher than that of 
the more conservative portfolio, and the potential range of values is wider.
Choose to Create a Moderate Portfolio
A moderate portfolio is appropriate if you meet the following criteria:
 
 You won’t need the money for about ten years. In general, the longer 
time horizon allows you to add more equity and other risky assets, 
which should increase your long-term return. With a longer time frame, 
extreme up and down years tend to cancel each other out, and your 
return will trend much closer to the expected long-run return.
 
 You have increased ability to bear risk. Someone in his 20s or 30s with 
decades of earnings ahead of him — and not dependent on income from 
the portfolio — can afford more risk in search of a higher return than 
a retiree with her working years behind her. Similarly, a retiree with 
adequate health and long-term care insurance and a hefty retirement 
pension can bear more risk than a retiree dependant on his portfolio to 
fund essential expenses.
 
 You can tolerate a moderate amount of market volatility. You already 
have some experience in the market and are comfortable with some 
volatility, but you’re unwilling to accept the more extreme movements 
that come with a more aggressive portfolio. For example, a moderate 
portfolio with an expected annual long-term return of 9.6 percent may be 
expected to return between 1.8 and 17.4 percent two-thirds of the time.

assuming returns are log normally distributed. Portfolios are expected to earn above the lower boundary 90% of 
the time and below the upper boundary 90% of the time.
Construct a Moderate Portfolio
Building a moderate portfolio follows the same process as constructing the 
conservative portfolio. You use the same asset classes for the level of portfo-
lio complexity you prefer (see Strategy #48); only the weightings change.
 
Keeping equity and alternative investments in the 45-to-65-percent range, and 
cash and fixed income investments in the 35-to-55-percent range, is a good 
idea.
The same steps apply as with the conservative portfolio:

208
Part III: Demystifying Risk — Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
 
1. Keep the overall split between equity and fixed income within the 
ranges for a moderate portfolio as specified in the following table.
 
2. Balance the number of asset classes with the size of your portfolio and 
your ability to manage it.
 
 Having more than 8 to 12 isn’t necessary.
 
3. Allocate funds to the various asset classes within the ranges indicated 
in the table, depending on how much risk you’re willing to take in the 
attempt to earn a higher return.
 
 Focus on overall portfolio performance. By design, you’ll always have 
some asset classes in your portfolio doing better than others. The 
impact of having some investments zigging while others are zagging 
lowers overall portfolio volatility and potentially increases portfolio 
return. (See Strategy #40 for more on diversification.)
 
4. Choose one or two mutual funds for each asset class, depending on 
the size of your portfolio.
 
 If most active fund managers have trouble beating the market or their 
respective benchmarks in a one-year period, what chance do they have 
of beating their benchmark over longer periods? And what chance do 
you have of choosing that manager ahead of time? By choosing pas-
sively managed funds (index funds and exchange-traded funds) over 
actively managed ones, you may improve your chances of earning the 
market return over the long run. See Strategies #21 and #23 for details.
 
5. Rebalance periodically back to your target allocation.
 
 In volatile markets in particular, ensure you don’t stray too far from your 
target weightings. This may mean you have to sell assets that are doing 
well and buy those that are doing poorly, but you’ll be well positioned 
when the market recovers because you’ve bought low and sold high 
along the way.
The following table gives suggested asset class percentages.

Note the Historical Performance 
of Moderate Portfolios
We provide two examples of moderate portfolios. The first portfolio illus-
trates a moderately conservative allocation using both 6 and 12 asset classes, 
and the second example shows the same historical results for a portfolio that 
has more opportunity for growth. The key statistics are shown on the bottom 
line — you want the highest return with the lowest amount of volatility (as 
measured by standard deviation) for your personal comfort level.
Note that the additional asset classes in the more complex portfolio result 
in a higher expected return and lower standard deviation in both cases, 
although the simple portfolio captures most of the benefits of diversification.

Employ an Aggressive Portfolio
By Peggy Creveling, CFA
A
n aggressive portfolio bears nearly the full brunt of market volatility 
in an attempt to achieve higher long-term returns. There’ll be more 
years of losses and more periods of multi-year losses, countered by some 
extremely good years of positive returns. You’ll need to stomach large swings 
in the value of your portfolio, sometimes on a daily basis, without losing your 
nerve and bailing out on your portfolio. Your returns in any one year can 
vary widely, but the longer you hold the portfolio, the closer your return will 
approach the long-run expected return.
Is a portfolio that’s earning only 1 to 2 percent more than a less volatile one 
worth the stress and anxiety? Over the long haul, yes. That additional 1 to 
2 percent doesn’t seem like much on its own, but compounded over a 20- to 
30-year time period, the impact can be huge, as shown in Figure 50-1. For 
longer time periods, an aggressive portfolio is likely to do better than more 
conservative ones. The trick is having the ability to stay invested for long 
periods despite the turmoil you’ll most likely experience. In this strategy, you 
explore aggressive portfolios.
 
Don’t forget about mutual fund fees. You can sometimes add nearly 1 percent 
to your return by simply swapping your high-cost actively managed fund for a 
low-cost index fund or exchange-traded fund — and you don’t need to take on 
any additional risk to get it.

Know Whether an Aggressive 
Portfolio Is Right for You
Consider an aggressive portfolio only if you meet the following conditions:
 
 You have a long time horizon. You need the extremely bad and 
good years to cancel each other out and settle around the longer-run 
expected return.
 
 With an aggressive portfolio, the long run should be 15 to 20 years or 
more. Anything shorter and your returns may be significantly lower than 
your expected return.
 
 You have a high capacity to bear risk. In other words, you can weather 
the storm financially if your investments don’t work out within the time 
period expected. This may be because your goal is flexible or because 
you have a way to make up the shortfall by adding savings, extending 
the time period, or funding the goal from another source.

213
 #50: Employ an Aggressive Portfolio
 
 You’re an experienced investor and know that you can stomach a 
lot of volatility. The returns of an aggressive portfolio in any one year 
may vary widely. If you’ve invested during a prolonged period of market 
uncertainty before, you have a good idea of how you’ll react when 
the financial media starts churning out stories of impending financial 
Armageddon. If you stuck through past periods without panicking and 
selling out, an aggressive portfolio allocation may be for you.
 
An aggressive portfolio isn’t appropriate for all goals — the risk of shortfall 
is too high. Using an aggressive portfolio to fund college for your 13-year-
old wouldn’t be a good idea, but it may be appropriate for a younger person 
saving for retirement or even a retiree whose living expenses are covered by a 
pension or other income and is growing the portfolio to pass on to heirs.
If you’re dependent on income from your portfolio, the risks of an aggres-
sive portfolio may be unbearable. Making regular withdrawals, especially in 
years of bad returns, can devastate your portfolio and your life (see Strategy 
#68 for details). On the other hand, if you have an emergency fund in place, 
you have adequate health and long-term care insurance, and your essential 
living expenses are covered by Social Security, pensions, or other sources of 
income (not part-time work), then you may be able to take some additional 
risk with your portfolio. If you’re primarily dependent on your portfolio to 
cover your basic living expenses, you don’t.
 
In a household where more than one person is affected by the investment 
decisions, both need to be comfortable with the portfolio’s level of volatility. 
Go with the risk tolerance level of the more conservative person.
Constructing an Aggressive Portfolio
Building an aggressive portfolio follows the same process as building moder-
ate and conservative portfolios. You use the same asset classes for the level 
of portfolio complexity you prefer (see Strategy #48); only the weightings 
change.
An aggressive portfolio has a greater percentage invested in equity and 
alternative holdings and a lower percentage in fixed income. Experts suggest 
keeping equity and alternative investments in the 70-to-90-percent range and 
fixed income investments in the 10-to-30-percent range.
The same steps apply as with the conservative and moderate portfolios:

214
Part III: Demystifying Risk — Accumulating and Protecting Wealth 
 
1. Keep the overall split between the broad fixed income, equity, and 
alternative asset classes within the ranges shown in the following 
table.
 
2. Balance the number of asset classes with the size of your portfolio and 
your ability to manage it.
 
 Use no more than 8 to 12.
 
3. Allocate funds to each selected asset within the suggested ranges, 
ensuring that the total doesn’t exceed the recommended range for the 
broader asset classes (fixed income, equity, or alternative).
 
 Consider index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for each asset 
class to keep fees low. (See Strategies #21 and #23 for more on these 
funds.)
This table gives you some idea of how to split out the asset classes.

Save for Emergencies
By Dylan Ross, CFP
E
ven if you’ve never had to quickly come up with money for something 
you weren’t expecting, you always face the possibility of needing 
money in an emergency. Emergencies are unplanned expenses that require 
more money than you can cover with your paycheck, even if you cut some 
expenses until next payday. When you don’t have enough in savings, emer-
gencies can put you in debt or deeper in debt. An emergency fund helps pro-
tect your finances.
Unexpected expenses may be one-time or recurring. Potential uses for emer-
gency funds include car repairs, paying bills if you’re out of work, large medi-
cal costs, insurance deductibles, critical home repairs, legal defense fees, 
travel to attend a funeral, natural disasters, and so on.
Figure How Much to Set Aside
At an absolute minimum, set aside enough money in your emergency fund 
to pay for at least three to six months of basic living expenses (the regular 
and essential expenses you must pay to live). These expenses don’t include 
discretionary items like entertainment, dining out, or spa treatments. Keep 
at least six months of basic living expenses in your emergency fund if you’re 
single or living on one income, or if one income in your two-income house-
hold varies a lot from month to month or isn’t secure.
 
Your emergency fund does more than just cover expenses in case you lose 
your job, so resist the temptation to keep a smaller emergency fund if your job 
is stable or if you think you could find work quickly if you’re laid off. Basing 
the size of your emergency fund on monthly expenses establishes a guideline, 
but the fund covers other emergencies, even while you’re employed.
If you anticipate more frequent or more severe emergencies than three to six 
months of basic living expenses can cover, increase the size of your emer-
gency fund. For example, you may need a larger emergency fund if

 Your job security is questionable.
 
 You’re about to have a baby or purchase a new home.
 
 You have numerous, aging household appliances.
 
 You drive an older car.
 
 You live in an area prone to severe weather, earthquakes, or other 
disasters.
 
 You engage in activities that may result in frequent trips to the emer-
gency room, doctor’s office, or the first aid aisle of your local pharmacy.
 
Your emergency fund is handy when you need to make insurance co-payments 
or pay for charges not covered by a health, dental, or vision plan. Sometimes 
you may need cash until you’re reimbursed by an insurance company or flex-
ible spending account. Consider any unreimbursed medical expenses from the 
past few years when deciding whether to increase your emergency fund.
 
If you’re feeling especially uncertain, add to the size of your emergency fund. 
You can always reduce it after you’re through the rough patch.
 
When purchasing household appliances, decline the offers for extended war-
rantees and add that money to your emergency fund instead. If you self-war-
ranty several appliances, you spread out the risk of needing to repair any one 
of them. If you don’t need to make repairs, you get to keep the money!
Handle Your Emergency Fund with Care
The tricky thing about financial emergencies is that you don’t know what 
they’ll be, when they’ll happen, or how much you’ll need in order to cope 
until you can recover. All these unknowns make your emergency fund an 
important part of your financial profile and one that you should treat with 
special attention and care.
Make your fund a high priority
The harder you think it is to come up with money for an emergency fund, the 
more you need one. If coming up with money to start an emergency fund now 
will be a sacrifice, imagine how tough it will be when you have to pay for the 
costs of an emergency situation.

 #51: Save for Emergencies
If you’re trying to pay off credit cards or high-interest loans, start with an 
emergency fund that could cover one month of basic living expenses. After you 
save one month of expenses, put extra money toward your debt payments. 
When your debt is paid off, build your emergency fund as quickly as possible. 
Otherwise, a sudden emergency could send you right back into the red.
Keep your fund liquid
Keep your emergency fund in cash types of investments (see Strategy #17 for 
more on cash investments). This money should be quickly available with no 
risk of decreasing in value at any time. An emergency fund is self-insurance, 
not an investment. You want your money to be accessible, but you also want 
to earn some interest on it so that you offset inflation at least partially, if not 
completely. The next section tells you where to invest your money.
Invest your fund
Some places to keep your emergency fund savings include the following:
 
 High-yielding direct savings accounts: Online savings accounts often 
pay a higher than average interest rate. You can, and should, establish 
an electronic transfer link (called an ACH or Automated Clearing House 
link) to your checking account.
 
 Savings and money market accounts: These are interest-bearing 
accounts at banks or credit unions. Being able to electronically transfer 
money to your checking account is best.
 
 Money market funds: Not to be confused with money market accounts, 
these are funds offered by mutual fund companies and brokerage firms. 
You redeem fund shares to get cash out. Some accounts allow you to 
write checks to access the cash.
 
 Interest-bearing checking accounts: These accounts may pay less inter-
est than savings accounts.
 
 Certificates of deposit (CDs): These banking deposits guarantee a spe-
cific interest rate if you hold them for a specified period of time. They 
aren’t an ideal place to keep emergency fund money because you usu-
ally have to pay a penalty to get your money out early.

222
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
When deciding where to keep your emergency funds, make sure you know 
how and when you can access your cash. Can you get to your money after 
business hours? What about on weekends and holidays? Can you use checks, 
an ATM, or a debit or check card? Also, make sure you’re comfortable with 
whether or not the account is insured.
 
Don’t use available credit as an emergency fund! Credit cards and home equity 
lines of credit could serve as a backup to your emergency funds in the event 
of a catastrophe, but the whole idea of an emergency fund is to keep you from 
adding debt. Some emergencies could affect your ability to make minimum 
debt payments, and missed payments, late penalties, and finance charges can 
easily snowball out of control.
 
Keep a small amount of cash (enough for some groceries or to get out of town 
in an evacuation) stashed away at home for emergencies. During local emer-
gencies like storms and blackouts, nearby merchants may not accept checks 
or be able to process credit and debit cards.
Use your fund wisely when the time comes
 
Create a plan for dealing with emergencies. Prioritize what expenses you 
could cut or reduce in an emergency. Know what you have to do, whom you 
have to call, and how long it will take to cancel unnecessary services. Write it 
all down and keep it somewhere you can find it when you need it.
Sooner or later you’ll have a large, unexpected expense you can’t cover with 
your paycheck. First, decide whether it’s a real emergency. Do you need to 
spend the money right now? Can you make do until you can save up to meet 
the expense? Your answer may be influenced by other events. For example, 
if your dishwasher bites the dust, you may decide to save up for a new one 
while you handwash dishes because of layoff rumors at work.
When you face a real emergency, access only the minimum amount of money 
necessary to get you through the emergency. Cut any unnecessary expenses 
and direct any available income toward your emergency before accessing the 
emergency fund. When the emergency is over, rebuild your emergency fund 
as quickly as possible, before reinstating nonessential expenses.

Provide for Large Expenses
By Eileen Freiburger, CFP
I
n a perfect world, you’d have funds saved long before you needed them 
for a large outlay. However, the world isn’t perfect, and national or local 
economic uncertainty can challenge your purchase decisions. Having a plan 
or a set of guidelines for funding large purchases can help you make better 
decisions when the time comes. An obvious decision with large expenses is 
to delay the purchase until the economy turns around. However, with careful 
planning ahead of time, that may not be your only choice. Read on for some 
options.
Buying a Car
Whether you buy a car every three years or drive the one you have until it 
falls apart, you generally know well ahead of time that you’ll make this pur-
chase. Because ego and emotions often influence the decision of which car to 
purchase, developing guidelines for yourself can keep you from buying a car 
that’s more than you can afford — one that may create a debt crisis when the 
economy gets tough.
Do your prep work
Start with a review of your current assets. Do you have enough saved in a car 
fund to pay cash for the car? If not, review your current spending. If you take 
out a loan to buy the car, how much monthly payment can you add to your 
current expenses? Choose an amount that you can afford not only now but 
also if your finances get tough.
 
If you know today that you’ll be replacing a car in the future, start saving 
toward the down payment. (See Strategy #17 for information on where to 
invest your savings.) Because you’ll use this money within a short time and 
won’t have time to recover from a dip in the stock market, you need to invest 
these funds in a way that protects what you’re putting aside and provides 
modest growth.

Next, comparison shop. Here are some useful Web sites:
 
 Edmunds: www.edmunds.com
 
 Kelly Blue Book: www.kbb.com
 
 CarBuyingTips.com: www.carbuyingtips.com
For the vehicle you’re considering, research the retail price as well as each 
dealer’s invoice price and whether the dealer may be receiving incentives or 
rebates on that vehicle. Knowing this information beforehand can help you 
choose a dealer and give you a stronger negotiating position. That’ll also help 
you reduce your total cost, as well as your loan payment. Do this step for 
both new and used cars.
 
Because car values depreciate quickly, buying a two- to three-year-old used 
car with a service warranty may make the most financial sense for getting the 
best bang for your buck.
Pay for your car
You have three options for buying a car:
 
 Save and pay outright.
 
 Prearrange a loan.
 
 Use dealer financing.
Having a sizable down payment saved may help you obtain better terms on 
a loan. Also, check your credit score at www.myfico.com because it’ll affect 
the loan terms you’re offered and therefore the monthly payment you’ll 
make. You also want to check your credit report; see Strategy #12.
You can use www.bankrate.com to see what the loan rates are nationally 
and in your area. Shop local lending institutions for their rates, check the 
interest rate each dealer offers, and compare all rates to find the lowest.

Getting a House
Whether to buy or rent is a major financial decision. For a worksheet to com-
pare the pros and cons of owning a home — as well as worksheets on mort-
gages and the like — see Personal Finance Workbook For Dummies, by Sheryl 
Garrett (Wiley).
Determine your tax savings
If you own a house and you itemize deductions on your tax return, you can 
deduct your property taxes and the interest from your mortgage payment. 
Look at this savings as money that can be put into your emergency fund or 
into savings for another large purchase.
For example, suppose you have a $250,000 30-year mortgage at a 6-percent 
interest rate and your property taxes are 1 percent of your home value. The 
total interest paid over the first year (assuming you bought on January 1) is 
$14,916, and your property taxes are $2,500. If you’re in the 28-percent tax 
bracket, this would give you a $17,416 tax deduction and result in a tax sav-
ings of $4,876.
Decide what can you afford
You need to have both feet on the ground when you figure out what kind of 
monthly house payments you can afford.
 
Don’t buy a house that’s more than you can afford just because the initial 
monthly payments look affordable, and don’t rely on a lender to tell you what 
an affordable monthly payment is.
Be sure you understand all the terms and conditions of the type of mortgage 
you’re committing to, especially if the interest rate will be level for the length 
of the loan or if it’ll vary and under what conditions. Loans that are interest-
only for a limited period of time or that have a variable interest rate can 
create great financial problems during financially difficult times.
Note how long you’ll stay in the house and whether you can afford this loan into 
retirement. If you plan to live in this house for a long time, look seriously at a 
fixed-rate mortgage payable over 15, 20, or 30 years. Table 52-2 gives you an idea 
of what your monthly payment could be on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.

Taking on higher monthly expenses than you should can quickly put you in 
debt and expose you to the risk of losing everything during bad times, so ask 
yourself these tough questions:
 
 How much down payment do you need to make? And do you have the 
cash to do so? If your credit is average or below average expect to need 
a down payment of 10 percent in most situations, unless you qualify for 
an FHA or VA loan. They require less of a down payment and are more 
lenient on credit scores. Before you go shopping for a home, obtain a 
pre-approval letter from your lender.
 
 What mortgage payment, property taxes, and insurance premiums fit 
into your current budget?
 
 Would you be able to make these payments if you were laid off, lost your 
job, or had an extended illness and couldn’t work?
 
 Does the house need any repair or remodeling and if so, how soon? Will 
those costs be included in your mortgage?
 
 With these new expenses, can you still afford to contribute to your 
retirement accounts? Do you still have sufficient emergency cash 
reserves? Will you be able to put a reasonable monthly savings amount 
toward your children’s college education?
For help with mortgage decisions, rates, and tutorials for home purchases 
and loan considerations, www.mgtprofessor.com is a wonderful source.
Doing Home Repairs and Remodeling
Your options for financing home repairs, updates, and additions can present 
a challenge. You may choose to borrow the money you need by using a fixed- 
or variable-rate home equity line of credit or a second mortgage. Or you may 

227
 #52: Provide for Large Expenses
consider refinancing your current loan for a larger amount and take cash out. 
Or you may decide to use money you’ve set aside for taking advantage of 
opportunities that may come up. First consider the following:
 
 A home equity line of credit gives you ongoing access to money. But 
after you tap into a line of credit, the payments add up. Also, keep in 
mind these are interest-only loans. Ask your lender to confirm what pay-
ment you’d make and how long it would take you to pay it off. Don’t kid 
yourself; $40,000 at 5-percent interest and a $166.66 payment per month 
sounds reasonable, right? But this payment means the loan is never 
going away during your lifetime. By adding another $100 for a $266.66 
payment, you still have more than 19 years before you pay the loan in 
full. Know the payoff schedule before you commit!
 
 Home equity loans are also home loans, but with a fixed loan amount 
and a monthly payment plan. The amount of the loan is generally based 
on a percentage of the amount of equity you have in your home. If your 
home has appreciated in value, this loan can be a way to access that 
appreciation and use it to improve the value of your home even more. 
However, you should be fully aware of what’s happening with the values 
of homes in your area, and whether they’re currently moving up or 
down, as well as what’s been happening over the last several years.
 
 Refinancing your mortgage for a larger amount and using the extra 
cash for home updates works for many consumers. Are you planning to 
stay in your house? Can you absorb the higher fixed costs? Look at this 
financing option with an eye toward the future. But note that when home 
prices are depreciating, many home owners won’t qualify for refinancing 
due to tightened credit and income requirements. This option may not 
be viable during tough times.
 
 Before refinancing, determine the new loan amount you owe and the 
repayment schedule. Could you buy a new house for less that has all the 
features you want to add? Fees to refinance are usually around 1 percent 
of the new loan amount. Is it worth it? Can your budget, livelihood, and 
future retirement handle the new payments? Don’t make this decision 
lightly; it’s very possible that you’ll have a loan well past retirement on 
a significantly higher balance than you may have anticipated. Don’t rush 
into this option without reviewing the financial merits ahead of time.

Develop a Plan to 
Provide for Children
By Eileen Freiburger, CFP
M
ost of the considerable costs of raising children are blended in with 
your everyday living expenses, such as housing, food, clothing, trans-
portation, healthcare, and childcare. However, you can plan for several large 
expenses. This strategy tells you how to make sure you’re ready.
Having a Baby
Having a baby isn’t always a planned event — surprises do happen! The cost of 
delivering a baby ranges from $7,500 to $10,000. Even with medical insurance, 
you’ll pay deductibles, co-insurance percentages, and co-pays. (See Strategy #5 
for information on medical insurance.) Plan ahead by doing the following:
 
 Contact your insurance company to find out the process for filing your 
claims and what you need to do when preparing to check into the 
hospital.
 
 Find out how long it takes for the hospital to file insurance claims.
 
 Ask your insurance company how long it takes to pay claims after 
they’re filed. You need to know whether you’ll be responsible for 
any payments before your insurance company has paid its portion 
of all expenses. Determine when you have to pay your portion of the 
expenses.
You can then figure out how much money you want to set aside ahead of 
time so that even if there are economic troubles at the time your baby is 
born, you’ll be able to pay your bills.
 
If you aren’t covered by medical insurance and don’t have sufficient savings, 
you can work with the doctor’s office and the hospital on a payment plan. You 
may also want to check out local or county health care clinics to see whether 
prenatal care is available. If you qualify, Medicaid may be available.

229
 #53: Develop a Plan to Provide for Children
Having a baby may raise other financial questions, including the following
 
 When will Mom stop working?
 
 Will Mom and/or Dad stay home with the baby?
 
 Will Mom and/or Dad return to work? If so, when?
 
 Will anyone’s career plans change?
Having an emergency fund large enough to cover three to six months’ worth 
of living expenses can help to cover changes in jobs, time off, and loss of 
wages.
Setting Aside Pretax Dollars 
for Medical Expenses
According to a survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the estimated 
cost of raising one child from birth through age 17 ranges from $125,000 
to $250,000 (in 2001 dollars). Based on an inflation rate of 3.5 percent, this 
amount becomes $160,000 to $318,000 in 2008 dollars. Finding ways to reduce 
your expenses can help whether times are good or bad.
 
Take advantage of available flex saving accounts (FSA); these enable you to 
set aside pretax money from your paycheck for medical, dental, vision, and 
dependent care expenses, all of which add up very quickly. For example, an 
average family may have to pay for the following:
Category 
Cost
15–20 doctor visits/year at a co-pay of $30 
$450 to $600
Two sets of glasses 
$300 to $800
Four dentist visits, out of pocket 
$200 to $500
10–20 chiropractor visits at $75 each 
$750 to $1,500
Annual medical prescription co-pays 
$1,000 to $2,000
Total 
$2,700 to $5,400
This family may potentially spend $2,700 to $5,400 annually.
You don’t pay income taxes on money distributed from your FSA. For this 
example, if the contribution limit is $3,000 and your income tax rate is 33 per-
cent, you’d save $990 per year by using an FSA. That savings can be money 
that you add to your contributions to your employer’s retirement plan or an 
IRA. In tough economic times, you can use those savings to help cover other 
expenses.

230
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
 
If your employer offers an FSA, save your medical, dental, vision, and depen-
dent care receipts to file for reimbursement. Compare your potential expenses 
to the limit you can put into an FSA, and make sure you use the entire amount 
you’ve withheld; you lose any amount you don’t claim.
Saving for College
As you save for your kids’ college, start as soon as possible with regular 
contributions. How much to save may be your first question. A calculator on 
www.savingforcollege.com came up with the estimates in Table 53-1. 
The example is based on an annual cost of $20,000 ($80,000 total for four 
years in today’s dollars) with school costs increasing by 6 percent and a 
portfolio with an after-tax return of 7 percent. In these estimates, parents will 
pay 100 percent of expenses.

Many parents are comfortable funding part of their children’s college educa-
tion and letting the kids pay for part of it. Two common ways to save for col-
lege today are the 529 college savings plan and the education savings account.
 
Students are expected to contribute a larger percent of their assets than their 
parents are, so some people recommend that you save in your name instead 
of your child’s. You can save in normal, taxable accounts.
529 college savings plans
Every state offers a 529 college savings plan. These plans vary widely. For example, 
the total contribution varies from just over $200,000 to more than $300,000. States 
use different investment companies to administer their plans, and investment 
choices vary widely. You can use any state’s plan, but most offer a state income 
tax deduction on contributions only for residents. Obtain a description of 
each state’s plan that you’re considering (www.savingforcollege.com 
enables easy comparison of several plans at a time). Be very careful to evalu-
ate the expenses of each plan you consider — both plan and mutual fund 
expenses. When you withdraw money to pay for qualified college expenses, 
it’s tax-free.

231
 #53: Develop a Plan to Provide for Children
Education savings accounts
In a Coverdell education savings account (ESA), families may currently deposit 
$2,000 per year for each child under age 18. Contributions are not tax-deduct-
ible, but earnings accumulate tax-free, and no taxes are due on withdrawal 
for qualified expenses for tuition, fees, books, equipment, and room and 
board. The ESA is phased out for individuals and families with adjusted gross 
incomes between preset limits. Investing an ESA should be the same as you’d 
do within a 529 college savings plan in which you choose the mix of mutual 
funds. However, with an ESA, you have total control over the mutual funds 
you select because you choose the investment firm where you set up the 
account. You can set up an ESA with any discount broker, mutual fund com-
pany, and the like.
Loans
If you have to limit what you can save for college, one way to pay for college 
is with student loans. To qualify for loans, you submit a Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application. You should do this as soon as pos-
sible in January during your child’s senior year. You can find more informa-
tion at the following Web sites: www.fafsa.ed.gov, www.myrichuncle.
com, and www.finaid.org.
Education tax credits
If you’re already paying for education costs, you’ll likely be able to claim a 
credit on your income tax return. The two education tax credit programs are 
the HOPE Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning credit.
The $1,800 HOPE Scholarship credit equals 100 percent of the first $1,200 
of tuition and fees and 50 percent of the second $1,200 (the amounts will be 
indexed for inflation).
The Lifetime Learning credit is another option. Whether your student attends 
an eligible institution full time or part time, the credit is 20 percent of the 
first $10,000 (up to $2,000 per return) for eligible students in your family. The 
credit is reduced if your modified adjusted gross income is between certain 
income limits.
 
The Hope and Lifetime Learning Credits can’t be used for the same student.

Save for Retirement Regardless of 
the Shape of the Economy
By Christine Falvello, MS, CFP
W
hat could be more gratifying than faithfully making your retirement 
contributions month after month and year after year while the value 
of your plan increases? Each good day in the market brings you closer to 
your retirement dreams. Making those contributions is easy when you’re 
watching your account grow.
But what about when the economy’s not so strong? In an uncertain economy, 
the financial markets can appear to be going nowhere, and your retirement 
plan seems to be sleeping. You keep pumping in your money and your plan 
repays you with a value that stays the same. Or even more nerve-wracking, 
you watch the value sink. You ask yourself, “Why should I keep giving my 
hard-earned money to this ungrateful retirement plan that doesn’t reward me 
by growing?” This strategy explains why.
Buy Low: A Sale’s the Best Time to Shop
Imagine that instead of an uncertain economy, the reverse is true. The 
economy is humming along as you continue to save; with few bad days in the 
market, your account grows nicely. How gratifying! The markets may even be 
doing so well that your family, friends, and colleagues talk about how they’re 
investing and freely share that advice with you.
Now look at how investors behave in an uncertain economy. You know uncer-
tain markets can be volatile and decrease in value, sometimes a lot. Those 
same people talk about ending retirement savings. Some may even change 
their investments to cash, figuring they’ll wait for the market to bottom out 
and then jump back in. They assume they’ll know the right time to start 
investing again. You may have even thought about doing this yourself.
This isn’t a smart move. Here’s why:

233
 #54: Save for Retirement Regardless of the Shape of the Economy
 
 Even the experts don’t know when the market will hit a real bottom and 
start to move back up. If the experts don’t know, how will you?
 
 On certain days throughout the history of the stock market, the market 
rallied quickly and dramatically. Those who were in cash and missed a 
key day had portfolio returns lowered, sometimes significantly. Out of 
the market, they got back in, often at higher prices.
Those who simply stopped making retirement plan contributions missed a 
great sale. And it’s the right of all Americans, after all, to buy things on sale.
 
By continuing to save when the market is down, you purchase more shares for 
your money. When things improve, the additional shares you bought on sale 
increase the value of your account even more.
Take Five Steps to Retirement 
Accumulation
Here are five simple steps you can follow in any market to make your retire-
ment dream a reality:
 
1. Save and invest regularly.
 
 If you can, set up automatic payroll deductions for retirement contribu-
tions. If you don’t have a retirement plan where you work, open an IRA 
(or a Roth IRA, if you qualify). Use a discount brokerage firm to save 
fees, and set up a monthly fund transfer from checking into your new 
account.
 
 If you’re self-employed, you have several retirement plan options, and 
some are fairly simple to open. They’re often available through discount 
brokerage firms. Just be wary of bank and insurance plans that have 
high fees.
 
2. Start saving early.
 
 The earlier you save, the more you’ll enjoy the power of compounding. 
For example, a 30-year-old who invests $200 a month for four years at 
an 8-percent return will have $62,000 at age 55. A 40-year-old who saves 
$800 a month at the same return for four years will have $57,000 at age 
55. The 40-year-old saved twice as much and had less money at 55. 
Remember, starting sooner means saving smarter.

234
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
 
3. Maximize contributions to qualified retirement accounts.
 
 Always max out your retirement plan contributions. It’ll give you more 
flexibility about when you can retire, and your retirement income will be 
higher. If you can save more than the maximum allowed, open an IRA, 
preferably a Roth IRA. If you can still save more after maxing out your 
IRA contributions, save in a taxable individual brokerage account.
 
 Don’t forget about the tax advantage to retirement plan contributions. 
Your federally taxable income for the year is reduced by the amount 
you contribute to your plan, so you’ll pay less income tax. Think of it as 
having Uncle Sam subsidize part of your retirement savings plan!
 
4. Make sure your portfolio is diversified.
 
 The old saying about not putting all your eggs in one basket is true in 
investing. Own a mix of different assets. Make sure you own a mix of 
stocks, bonds, and to a lesser extent, cash. Your stocks should include 
growth and value, as well as shares of large, medium, and small compa-
nies. For bonds, think about using a laddered bond strategy — short-, 
intermediate-, and long-term. Also, if your plan offers a stable value fund 
with a guaranteed interest rate, consider including it as an investment 
choice. A stable value fund will perform like a bond in your portfolio, 
stabilizing part of its value.
 
5. Choose good investments.
 
 Make sure your investments are financially sound and perform well com-
pared to other investments of the same type. If returns are compared to 
an index, look for funds that perform at least as well as that index.
 
If your retirement plan offers company stock or a company stock fund, limit it 
to 5 percent of your overall retirement plan. If your company does poorly, you 
risk not only your job but also the value of your retirement plan.

Determine How Much Money Is 
Enough for the Rest of Your Life
By Garry Good, MBA
T
hink of your retirement as the most expensive purchase decision you’ll 
ever make. Even more daunting: You have only one chance to get it right. 
A wrong decision has implications for the rest of your life. Before pulling the 
plug on a career and current income stream, develop a clear image of what 
you’re buying and how much it’s going to cost.
So what’s a good retirement worth these days? How much do you need for 
the rest of your life? To solve this dilemma, the following formula should be 
useful:
“Rest of life” cost = (annual expenses – retirement income) × 
(life expectancy – retirement age)
In this formula, retirement income includes Social Security and/or pensions, 
and annual expenses should be adjusted for inflation.
The following sections look at these variables and discuss strategies you can 
use to take advantage of the variables you do control and manage the risk 
created by factors beyond it. Note: This simplified equation merely identifies 
the key factors involved and illustrates the basic concept of retirement plan-
ning; you need more actual number crunching to figure out that magic retire-
ment number.
Create a Fact-Based Retirement Budget
How can you really predict your expenses over the remainder of your life-
time? Believe it or not, this is one area where you have considerable control. 
The following process can enable you to allocate enough funds to withstand 
the ups and downs of your retirement years:

236
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
 
1. Establish a current budget based on actual expense data.
 
 Five or six months’ worth of data should be sufficient, but be sure the 
period you choose is representative of your average spending patterns.
 
2. Develop a reliable post-retirement budget.
 
 Don’t factor in inflation. While focusing on the future, simply conduct a 
line-by-line review of your expenses:
 
• Look for expenses that’ll be reduced or eliminated at retirement 
(work clothes, commuting expenses, professional dues, and so on).
 
• Identify spending categories that are likely to increase, such as 
healthcare.
 
• Add a budget line for unforeseen expenses. You don’t know exactly 
what or when, but count on the fact that unforeseen expenses will 
occur — auto repairs, appliance repairs or replacement, general 
home maintenance, and so on.
 
• Envision your retirement on a day-to-day basis. What have you 
been looking forward to? How do you see yourself spending all that 
free time? Chances are this time won’t really be free.
 
When you make budget cuts during the planning process, you leave no room 
to compensate later for events that are beyond your control. People tend 
to adopt optimistic assumptions to trick their plans into telling them what 
they want to believe. For example, to make an earlier retirement look viable, 
you may rationalize that you can easily get by with less. Making a deliberate 
choice to reduce your lifestyle can be a legitimate component of retirement 
planning — but only if you’ll remain committed. Ideally, your budget should 
include expenses that you can trim to stay on track even in the face of change.
 
Imagine that you’re retired and the economy isn’t cooperating with your well-
crafted plan. Inflation is heating up. The stock market (and your portfolio) 
is taking a dive. These events are all beyond your control. The good news? 
With appropriate planning, you can mitigate the damages. This is the time to 
beat your budget. You can tighten your belt by choosing to eliminate or delay 
selected activities — as long as these expenses were in your original plan.
Limit Your Reliance on the Unknown
After you estimate your retirement expenses, you can deduct any retirement 
income that you’ll receive from Social Security and employer-paid pensions 
to determine your actual (net) cash flow needs. The balance will have to 
come from your personal retirement savings.

237
 #55: Determine How Much Money Is Enough for the Rest of Your Life
Social Security and pensions provide a valuable hedge against longev-
ity because they promise an income stream that’ll last as long as you do. 
Unfortunately, you have little control over these fixed income sources. But 
although the future solvency of Social Security is out of your hands, you do 
have a say in how much you rely on this “guaranteed” source of income.
Every year, you’re provided a current estimate of your future monthly Social 
Security benefit. Most experts agree that this estimate is fairly reliable for 
those who are nearing retirement. But what if your retirement is years away? 
You can reasonably assume that the younger you are (and further from 
retirement), the greater the risk that your eventual payment will be reduced.
 
A proactive decision to adjust your Social Security expectations downward, 
based on age, can limit the downside risk to your planning assumptions. The 
following chart provides an example you may want to adopt:
Age 
Expected Benefit
65 
100%
60 
88%

75%

62%
45 
50%
40 
38%
35 
25%
30 
12%

0%
Although time (years to retirement) may reduce your confidence in future 
benefits, time (and the principle of compounding) is also your biggest ally in 
accumulating money to supplement Social Security and any pension income 
you may have in retirement.
Estimate Your Life Expectancy — 
Then Plan to Live Longer
Fortunately, most people aren’t born with an expiration date tattooed on 
their bottoms. Count your blessings. This is one uncertainty you should 
embrace! At the same time, the risk of longevity is one of the greatest chal-
lenges you face in retirement planning.

238
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
 
Plan to live longer than you expect to live. Consider this: The average person 
has a 50 percent chance of exceeding life expectancy. In other words, planning 
for your expected life results in a fifty-fifty chance of running out of money too 
soon.
What type of longevity should you plan for? This depends largely on how 
much risk you’re willing to assume. The current life expectancy for a 65-year-
old American is about 83 years. You can see this individual’s likelihood of 
surpassing additional milestones in the following chart from the National 
Center for Health Statistics:
Age Reached 
Likelihood (Percent)
Age 83 
50%
Age 85 
44%
Age 90 
25%
Age 95 
10%
Age 100 
3%
Making financial provisions for your life expectancy plus 17 years doesn’t 
even guarantee success! On the other hand, you may be reluctant to fund 
this contingency, fearing your financial sacrifice could be wasted if you live 
a normal life or happen to die prematurely. Think of longevity planning as 
buying insurance with an interesting twist: Insurance compensates you for a 
loss, but longevity planning pays off when you win!
Make the Final Call: When to Retire
 
Whereas life expectancy is the great unknown, the timing of your retirement 
(health permitting) is a decision that belongs to you. This call has the poten-
tial to stabilize your plan or jeopardize your financial life. Make an active deci-
sion considering all options and implications. Don’t retire simply by default.
When contemplating retirement, ask yourself the following questions:
 
 Are you really prepared financially for a secure retirement?
 
 Would you still want to retire if you were very happy with your job? 
Your boss? Your employer? Your career?
Sometimes a retirement goal is merely an escape from a bad situation. If you 
still enjoy working (though not necessarily at your current job), you should 
consider a job or career change instead — or simply focus on doing your cur-
rent job better. To expand your options and retire on your terms, invest in 
yourself through continuous education, network to tune in to new opportuni-
ties, and embrace change throughout your working life.

Strategies for Beginning Investors
By Robert Oliver, CFA, CFP
I
f you’re just getting started investing, you may wonder whether you 
should put any of your hard-earned money at risk during a period of eco-
nomic uncertainty. You’re not alone. Even the most experienced investors 
become uneasy when the economy stumbles and their portfolios hiccup.
However, some fundamental truths of investing will serve you well no matter 
the state of the economy. So don’t be daunted by the thought of getting 
started in a period of economic uncertainty. Some of the best buying oppor-
tunities come during economic turmoil.
Pay No Attention to Timing Predictions
Before investing, the first and perhaps most important concept to under-
stand is that no one can consistently or regularly predict peaks and troughs 
of economic or market trends. Yet many investment managers and informa-
tion services claim they can, and they ramp up their marketing during peri-
ods of bearish economies. Keep in mind that if someone could regularly time 
markets or economic cycles, there’d be no need to sell the knowledge.
 
Focus on low-cost, buy-and-hold investment strategies and disregard market 
timing services that claim to predict market trends.
Instead of trying to decide the best time to move your money in and out of 
the market, spend your time and energy researching and understanding the 
cost of investments.
Consider Costs and Index Funds
For any investment you own or consider owning, you should understand two 
key elements of cost:

240
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
 
 Transaction costs: How much it costs to buy and sell an investment; bro-
kerage and sales commissions fall into this category
 
 Holding costs: How much you’re charged annually for holding the 
investment; mutual fund expense ratios are the most common example
For most people, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are the 
best way to invest in securities. You can find fund expense data and other 
fund details on the Internet at morningstar.com or finance.yahoo.com.
One way to easily reduce the cost of your investments is by using passively 
managed funds, also known as index funds. Instead of trying to beat the 
return of a specific benchmark, such as the S&P 500, an index fund’s goal is to 
mirror the return of its benchmark. An index fund can charge a low expense 
ratio because its managers don’t spend time and money trying to determine 
the best companies within its benchmark. Actively managed funds, which do 
try to beat their respective benchmarks, pass along the cost of research to 
you — the investor — in the form of higher expense ratios.
You may wonder whether you’d be better off paying more for an actively 
managed fund that more than makes up for the higher fee with a higher 
return. If your name is Nostradamus, this may be a good plan. You could look 
into the future and see which funds are going to have superior returns and 
invest in them. In the real world, the only information you have is the past 
performance of funds, and research has shown that past performance is a 
poor predictor of future return. In other words, you have no way to know 
which actively managed funds will be worth the additional price of admis-
sion. The only thing you do know with a great deal of certainty is that you’ll 
pay more to invest in an actively managed fund than you would an index 
fund.
 
Keep most of your mutual fund expense ratios below 1 percent, and use no-
load index funds whenever possible to keep costs low. Low expenses are espe-
cially important or when markets are struggling.
Determine Your Asset Allocation
The cost of your investments is important, but research shows that over 90 
percent of your portfolio’s return will be determined by asset allocation — 
the process of determining how much you invest in each type of investment 
or asset class, such as stocks, bonds, and cash. To determine which asset 
classes are appropriate for you, consider the following:

241
 #56: Strategies for Beginning Investors
 
 Your risk tolerance: Quantify the loss you can sustain in your portfo-
lio’s value before you change investments. Because most investors don’t 
have a good sense of their tolerance for loss until they actually experi-
ence it, uncertain and volatile markets generally provide a clearer pic-
ture of risk tolerance than consistently increasing markets. Ask yourself 
what you would do if your portfolio lost 10 percent, 20 percent, or 30 
percent, and choose your asset allocation accordingly.
 
 Your goals and time horizon: Why are you investing? When do you 
need your money? You may be building a nest egg for retirement or 
saving for your next vacation. The time between today and when you 
need your investment is your time horizon. If you’re just starting your 
career and retirement nest egg, decades will pass before you’ll need the 
money. Therefore, you can stand to wade through periods of volatil-
ity and take on more risk. However, if you’re saving for a vacation six 
months from now, you may not want to put your vacation in jeopardy 
by investing your vacation savings in risky stocks. Generally, you should 
invest less of your portfolio in stocks as your time horizon shortens.
Allocate assets for short-term goals
If you want to invest some money that you plan to use in ten years or less, be 
careful how much you invest in volatile asset classes like stocks. If you plan 
to use the money in one year or less, such as for next summer’s vacation, 
avoid investing in stocks altogether.
 
Use cash-like investment vehicles — such as savings accounts, money market 
accounts and funds, and certificates of deposit (CDs) — for money you’ll need 
to use within a year. For more on cash vehicles, see Strategy #17.
As your time horizon lengthens, you can begin to invest a portion of your 
portfolio in stocks. In The Intelligent Asset Allocator (McGraw-Hill), financial 
theorist William Bernstein recommends investing no more than ten times 
the number of years you’ll be invested in stocks. For example, if you’ll need 
the money in three years, you should invest no more than 30 percent of your 
portfolio in stocks with the remainder invested in bonds and cash. This is a 
good rule of thumb, but you probably shouldn’t invest more than 80 percent 
of your portfolio in stocks even if you won’t need the money for ten years.
 
Avoid using tax-deferred accounts such as an IRA or 401(k) for short-term goals 
if you plan to use the money before you can take penalty-free withdrawals.

242
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
Allocate assets for long-term goals
Although many people want to be saving for short-term goals such as a trip 
to the Bahamas, the reality is that whatever savings you can afford should go 
toward retirement savings, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. For 
most beginning investors, retirement is at least ten years away.
With those factors in mind, Table 56-1 provides sample portfolios for retire-
ment savings for investors with moderate risk tolerance.

Investors with a higher tolerance for risk may increase their overall exposure 
to stocks and riskier asset classes, such as high-yield bonds and real estate, 
but more-conservative investors would reduce their exposure to them.
Generally, you should invest in tax-deferred accounts for long-term savings. If 
you have limited dollars to invest, find out whether your employer-sponsored 
plan, such as a 401(k) or 403(b), provides a match on the dollars that you 
invest. If so, contribute at least enough to maximize the match.
 
After you determine your target portfolio and invest accordingly, rebalance 
your portfolio back to its target percentages annually. This discipline forces 
you to stay invested during the year and then to sell the asset classes that have 
done well (sell high) and buy those that have underperformed (buy low) at 
year-end. It also helps you remove emotions from your investment decisions. 
For ideas on asset allocation and rebalancing, see Strategies #40 and #41.

Investors

nvesting when you’re just getting started can be intimidating, especially 
in an uncertain economy. You face a tough balancing act. You can’t ignore 
important long-term goals such as retirement or college. Maybe you’re trying 
to bulk up reserves while paying off a credit card, too. But relax — you can 
build an investment plan that gets you up and running with confidence.
Getting Started
To begin building an investment plan, you need the following:
 
 A budget with dollars earmarked to invest
 
 Specific goals, with costs, due dates, and savings requirements for each 
(see Strategy #13 for help with this)
Your projected timeline helps determine how much risk you can take so you 
can choose the right investments. A goal chart, such as the one in Table 57-1, 
helps you focus on the key element of the time horizon for each objective.

Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
Matching Investment Types 
to Your Time Table
With the investment industry so anxious to sell stuff, people have come up 
with a dazzling number of products — so many that it’s sometimes hard 
for even the experts to sort through all the options. So what’ll it be? Hedge 
funds? Commodity futures? The mattress?
For most purposes, investments can be broken down into three categories:
 
 Stocks: Stocks are shares of ownership in a company that entitle you to 
part of the profits, and they produce the biggest returns. But they also 
carry the most risk. They go up and down in value more frequently. The 
swings, called volatility, are greater than in bonds and cash, too.
 
 Bonds: Bonds represent a debt that a company or government owes 
you, the investor. They give you more modest returns but a smoother 
ride than stocks. The company or government that issues the bonds 
agrees to pay interest and to return the principal.
 
 Cash: In investment terms, cash is a short-term store of value that’s 
accessible, safe, and can pay interest. Cash doesn’t change in value 
very much. The amount of risk to your principal is little or none, but 
the downside is that cash gives low returns. (Refer to Strategy #17 for 
details on the types of cash accounts available.)
Risk is the amount of volatility in returns over a given period — in other 
words, how drastically the value of your investment goes up and down. High 
risk generally leads to a higher return, but lower risk ensures the funds you 
need in the short term don’t disappear just when you need them. So for your 
emergency fund (see Strategy #9), a low-risk fund such as cash is the best 
bet. For a retirement that may be 30 or more years off but will require a sub-
stantial pile of money, more stocks are a good choice. Bonds are a great fit 
for a goal coming due in an intermediate period of time.
 
Risk is a normal and even healthy part of the market cycle, and avoiding all 
risk isn’t an option. Investments that are too conservative may mean you’re 
just trading the risk of gut-wrenching market gyrations for the equally scary 
prospect of having to move in with your adult children. For long-term goals, 
get comfortable with investment risk and stay the course (but review your 
portfolio annually to make sure you’re still on track).
In any economy, you should tie your investment decisions to when the 
money must be available. Check out Table 57-2, which matches time tables 
with acceptable levels of risk.

Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
Building a Foundational Portfolio
No one can reliably predict the markets. But because investment requires 
being in the markets, it’s important to control what you can so you limit 
potential losses. The things within your control include the following:
 
 Allocation: Allocation is the portion of your treasure in each of the big 
three: stocks, bonds, and cash.
 
 Diversification: Diversification means owning enough different invest-
ment positions in each asset category.
 
 Costs: High investment expenses can eat away at your hard-earned dough.
As a beginning investor, you need just a few — or maybe even just one — 
investment vehicles to hit all your asset classes and to be diversified. And 
you don’t want to pay big expenses and commissions. Mutual funds — invest-
ment companies that sell shares to the public, pool their money, and buy a 
large number of various stocks or bonds — are the best choice for beginning 
investors because they offer automatic diversification.
 
Mutual funds can be either actively or passively managed. Actively managed 
funds have managers who try to beat the market by stock picking and market 
timing. Index funds own shares of an entire sector, hoping to passively match 
the market. Fans of indexing believe that markets move randomly, so active 
managers can’t accurately and consistently predict the direction or timing of 
markets. And because active management has higher costs, index funds may 
have a leg up. (For more on mutual funds, see Strategy #21.)
Following are a couple of ideas for foundational portfolios:
 
 One-stop shopping: A number of fund companies now offer life cycle, 
target date, or asset allocation funds that include large and small U.S. 
stocks, international stocks, bonds, and cash in one bucket. Some are 
geared for a particular objective, such as retirement or college, ratchet-
ing back the riskier assets as the goal approaches. Others cater to spe-
cific asset mixes, from conservative to aggressive. These plug-and-play 
funds are good options if your funds are limited or if you just like the 
convenience. Look for one using index funds.
 
 Simple index fund portfolio: For beginning investors who want more 
leeway on allocations, try the following:
 
• Total U.S. stock market index
 
• Total U.S. bond market index
 
• Total international (non-U.S.) stock market index
 
 Plunking 40 percent each into the U.S. stock and bond funds and 20 per-
cent into the international fund can provide a moderate investor with 
broad diversification and a great start toward building long-term wealth. 
See Part III for strategies on getting the asset mix that’s right for you.

aybe you just got the invitation to your 30-year high school reunion. 
Or perhaps the gray is showing around your temples. Whether you 
like it or not, you’re getting older, and just as you (hopefully) mature, your 
investment strategy should, too.
Parts I and II of this book address building a secure foundation and employ-
ing different investment tactics, and Strategy #57 demonstrates the use of 
three basic portfolio building blocks: mutual funds covering international 
stocks, U.S. large companies, and bonds. Now, this strategy addresses addi-
tional investments to help further diversify and maximize your returns.
You don’t have to be eligible for AARP membership to be an intermediate 
investor, but here are some asset classes you need to include as your portfo-
lio grows:
 
 U.S. small company stock mutual funds
 
 Emerging market stock mutual funds
 
 International small company stock mutual funds
 
 Real estate investment trusts (REITs)
 
 High-yield bond funds
 
 Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)
 
 International bond mutual funds
This strategy also discusses a couple of other options — micro-cap stocks 
and commodities — and gives you some general investment tips.

248
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
Own It: Equity Asset Classes
Equity asset classes are groups of stocks that have similar characteristics 
and perform the same in the marketplace. Here are the next four asset 
classes to add to your portfolio:
 
 U.S. small company stocks: U.S. small caps make up the first asset class 
you should add to your mix. Over the last 80 years, the U.S. Small Cap 
Index has outperformed the S&P 500, earning 12.2 percent annually 
versus the S&P’s 10.4 percent. The tradeoff is volatility because the 
prices of small companies can swing dramatically in comparison to their 
larger counterparts.
 
 Emerging markets: These assets may make sense for a small portion of 
your portfolio, but their volatility is even more dramatic than small com-
pany U.S. stocks. For instance, the MSCI Emerging Market Index was up 
over 66 percent in 1999 and down over 30 percent the very next year.
 
 International small company stocks: Like their stateside cousins, inter-
national small cap stocks are more unpredictable than stocks of larger 
companies.
 
 Real estate investment trusts (REITs): From 2004 to 2006, REITs gar-
nered returns of 31, 12, and 35 percent, as measured by the NAREIT 
(National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts) Index. With the 
downturn in real estate in 2007, the index lost over 15 percent.
 
Emerging market stocks, international small company stocks, and REITs all 
can add a little punch to your portfolio, but they’re also extremely volatile. 
Never let them reach a double-digit allocation in your portfolio. Experts rec-
ommend a higher allocation to large company stocks versus small company 
stocks.
Why include these additional investments? The answer is simple: diversifi-
cation. In 2001, the S&P 500 was down almost 12 percent while the NAREIT 
Index was up almost 14 percent. The next year, the S&P was up 28.66 percent 
and the Russell 2000 (which measures small cap U.S. stocks) was up 47.25 
percent.
 
Successful investors don’t chase the highest performing asset class from one 
year to the next. Instead, they use investments that perform differently under 
the same economic conditions. In doing so, they diversify their portfolio and 
lower their risk.

249
 #58: Strategies for Intermediate Investors
Lend It: Bond Asset Classes
As with stocks, investors benefit by including different types of bonds or 
fixed income in their portfolio. Dissimilar asset classes of bonds perform in 
distinct ways:
 
 High-yield bonds (junk bonds): These pay higher yields and sometimes 
pay capital gains.
 
 Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS): TIPS provide stability 
during periods of high inflation.
 
 International bond funds: These funds allow an investor to profit from 
changes in the value of the dollar and fluctuations in overseas interest 
rates.
 
The best way to add these asset classes is through low-cost index funds or 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs — see Strategy #23). Unfortunately, none exist 
for high-yield bonds. Instead, consider Vanguard’s High-Yield Bond Fund. For 
international bond exposure, consider State Street’s recently released SPYR 
International Treasury Bond ETF (BSX).
Risk It: Other Asset Classes for the 
Intermediate Investor
Intermediate investors with high risk tolerance may want to consider two 
additional asset classes: micro-cap stocks and commodities. Micro-cap stocks 
are the smallest stocks trading in the U.S. stock market. They provide diversi-
fication but are also extremely volatile. Only the most aggressive and sophis-
ticated investor should own this asset class. Bridgeway Funds has an index 
fund that tracks micro-cap stocks (BRSIX), and iShares has an ETF that tracks 
the Russell Micro-cap Index.
You may face uncertain times, but one thing is certain: Commodities fre-
quently perform very well in periods of uncertainty. PIMCO and Oppenheimer 
have long-established mutual funds that track specific indexes. Investors 
also can use an ETF from iShares that tracks the GSCI Commodity Trust. This 
index and the two mutual funds invest in a basket of diverse commodities 
such as oil, agricultural products, and precious metals. Avoid investing in 
only one type of commodity.

Micro-cap stocks and commodities are among the most volatile of asset 
classes. Make sure your risk tolerance is suitable for either of them.
Follow It: Advice for 
Intermediate Investors
Investment decisions aren’t easy for intermediate investors. You have plenty 
of opportunities but also a fair amount of risk. These tips may help:
 
 Don’t limit your investments to your company’s retirement plan. Most 
people begin investing via their employer’s 401(k) plan. If that’s all 
you have, it’s not sufficient. Intermediate stage investors should have 
investments in taxable accounts (see Strategy #32) to take advantage of 
long-term capital gains rates and in Roth IRAs (Strategy #33) because 
qualified distributions aren’t taxed.
 
 Use 529 college savings plans for children or grandchildren. 
Distributions for “qualified higher education expenses” are completely 
tax-free. Plus, 529 plans aren’t controlled by the student, so you don’t 
have to worry about the money going for pizza and beer. Students 
submit receipts for reimbursement to verify expenses, so you can use a 
529 plan to teach young adults money management skills. In uncertain 
economic times, that talent can’t be overemphasized. (See Strategy #53 
for more on college saving.)
 
 Some states allow college tuition to be purchased at today’s dollars 
using pre-paid tuition programs. This can help you hedge against rising 
college costs.
 
 Make sure your insurance is appropriate. You’ve worked hard to build 
a nest-egg — don’t lose it! Not everyone needs or can afford long-term 
care insurance. However, everyone needs to plan for the possibility of 
long-term care (Strategy #7 can give you details). Your life, disability, 
and liability coverage should be suitable.
 
 Avoid mutual funds and ETFs that are country-specific (such as 
Brazil or China) or sector-specific (such as healthcare or technology). 
Diversifying reduces risk, so don’t concentrate your investments. Make 
sure you have adequate cash reserves for emergencies.

Investments for 
Intermediate-Stage Investors
By Thomas Arconti, CFP
Y
ou’ve now been investing for a while. You have your asset allocation in 
place and have already rebalanced your portfolio a few times. You know 
the ups and downs of the stock market and even feel comfortable with the 
swings in the value of your portfolio. Now, like that basic food recipe you’ve 
cooked countless times, you’re ready to kick it up a notch.
Supplement Your Core Portfolio: 
The Satellite Approach
As you look to add additional investments to your portfolio, the first thing 
to remember is not to dismantle your well-balanced, diversified portfolio. 
Instead, consider this your core portfolio — the one to hold for the long term 
and that will continue to stand the test of time. Supplement your core portfo-
lio with one or more satellite portfolios, made up of more narrowly focused 
holdings that you believe will enhance your overall risk/return profile.
The satellite portfolios can be constructed with mutual funds or exchange-
traded funds (ETFs). Some examples of satellite funds include the following:
 
 Commodity funds
 
 Emerging market bond funds
 
 Foreign currency funds
 
 High-yield bond funds
 
 Long/short funds
 
 Mega or micro cap funds
 
 Preferred stocks
 
 Real estate investment trusts (REITs) of varying kinds
 
 Sector funds

252
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
When investing in sector funds, keep the following in mind:
 
 If the sector is already hot, it’s probably too late.
 
 Know the sector weighting in your core portfolio; choose something that 
may be missing or underrepresented in your core. (Refer to Strategies 
#48 through #50 for more on sector weighting.)
 
 Be aware of the typically higher management fees and any short-term 
redemption fees.
 
 Be prepared to pay closer attention to the sector funds on an ongoing 
basis; you need to know when to get out.
Uncertain economic times create anxiety about overall market performance, 
but they also provide opportunities. The challenge is to assess what’s hap-
pening now, predict what’s likely to happen, and select an investment that 
may profit from the upcoming changes — no easy task and not something to 
make large bets on. Use only a small percentage of your investable funds in 
your satellites; this percentage should be an amount that you can comfort-
ably risk.
Invest in the next hot sector
Sector funds are mutual funds or ETFs that invest only in companies belong-
ing to the same industry. You can choose from hundreds of sectors; some 
can be narrowly focused on a subsector of a particular industry (for example, 
Fidelity Select Medical Equipment [FSMEX] is a subsector of healthcare, 
investing mainly in companies involved in the development, manufacture, 
and sale of medical equipment and devices).
Here’s a small sampling of some of the sectors you can invest in:
 
 Biotechnology
 
 Consumer discretionary
 
 Consumer staples
 
 Defense and aerospace
 
 Financials
 
 Gaming
 
 Healthcare
 
 Information technology
 
 Nanotechnology
 
 Oil and gas exploration
 
 Real estate
 
 Solar energy
 
 Transportation
 
 Utilities
 
 Water resources

253
 #59: Investments for Intermediate-Stage Investors
 
Not sure you can predict which sectors may come into favor? Consider a 
sector rotation fund and leave it to professional money managers. They may 
not choose any better than you would, but at least you’re transferring the 
research to others. Of course, you’ll pay higher fund management fees. Some 
examples of sector rotation funds are Claymore/Zacks Sector Rotation ETF 
(XRO) and Rydex Sector Rotation (RYISX).
Invest in long/short funds
In an uncertain economy, stocks go up and down. Sophisticated inves-
tors have long employed strategies to take advantage of both movements, 
through short selling, options, and hedge funds (see Strategies #27 through 
#30 for more info). As an intermediate investor, you can tiptoe into this arena 
with long/short mutual funds or ETFs (sometimes also referred to as market 
neutral or 130/30 funds). Basically, the fund manager buys some stocks she 
anticipates will go up (long positions) and sells (actually borrows and sells) 
other stocks she anticipates will go down (short positions). Long/short funds 
may be a good diversifier in a down economy.
When investing in long/short funds, keep the following in mind:
 
 Minimum purchase requirements may be high.
 
 Returns may be mediocre at best when the overall market is good.
 
 Be aware of the typically higher management fees and any short-term 
redemption fees.
 
 These funds will have higher turnovers and subsequently higher tax 
consequences.
 
 These funds are relatively new and don’t have long track records.
Some examples of long/short funds include Hussman Strategic Growth 
(HSGFX), Fidelity 130/30 Large Cap (FOTTX), and Powershare S&P 500 Buy/
Write (PBP).
Bet on the value of currencies
As the overall U.S. economy rises and declines, the value of the U.S. dollar 
rises and declines in relation to other currencies. You can purchase mutual 
funds or ETFs that track a single currency, such as the Swiss franc, or that 
track several currencies. If you think the U.S. dollar is weakening relative to 
the euro, you could profit by purchasing an ETF like the CurrencyShares Euro 
Trust (FXE) or a mutual fund like the Merck Hard Currency Fund (MERKX), 
which invests in multiple currencies. If you think the strength of the U.S. 
dollar is on the rise, you could consider the Powershares DB U.S. Dollar 
Bullish (UUP).

254
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
When investing in currency funds, keep these points in mind:
 
 You need to be concerned with economies and market factors in two 
or more countries (the U.S. and all the foreign currency countries 
involved).
 
 You may be introducing new types of risk into your portfolio. Examples 
include political issues, trade deficits, interest rates, and national 
debts — both at home and abroad.
 
 Current events may drastically affect currency rates in a matter of days.
 
Currency funds are usually a zero sum game, meaning one side wins at the 
expense of the other. Accurately predicting whether the value of the U.S. 
dollar will rise or fall, and investing accordingly, is important.
Add an income-producing satellite
Perhaps you’re content with your core portfolio and merely want additional 
income. Accomplish this goal with investments beyond the traditional fixed-
income holdings in your core. Intermediate-level, income-producing invest-
ments may include the following:
 
 Municipal bonds (held in taxable accounts only): These bonds usually 
pay a lower interest rate than corporate or agency bonds, but they’re 
generally safe (check credit ratings). The income is free of federal 
income tax and possibly state income tax. Check the tax equivalent yield 
(TEY) to make a sound comparison.
 
 High-yield bonds (a nice way of saying junk bonds): These bonds 
typically pay more interest than investment-grade bonds, but they also 
carry a higher degree of default risk.
 
 Preferred stocks: These securities are somewhat of a cross between a 
stock and a bond. They generally pay a relatively high yield in the form 
of quarterly dividends.
 
 High-grade corporate or government agency bonds: The quality and 
interest rates paid by these bonds vary by their credit ratings, length of 
their term, and the general interest-rate market.
When investing in bonds or preferred stock, you should
 
 Become familiar with the credit ratings issued by Moody’s and Standard 
& Poor’s (Aaa/AAA = the best, C/D = the worst).
 
 Understand the effect that buying a bond at a discount, at par, or at a 
premium has on your expected yield to maturity (YTM).
 
 Be aware of call features associated with your bond.

255
 #59: Investments for Intermediate-Stage Investors
 
 Diversify your investment among several income-producing holdings to 
reduce risk.
Increase Your Tolerance for Risk
 
New investments in your portfolio bring new risks as well. Continue to analyze 
the risk/reward profile of any new investment and fully understand its place in 
your portfolio. Follow this advice:
 
 Knowledge is power, so go beyond the basics and commit to learning 
as much as you can about the interactions between your investments. 
Develop a good understanding of risk and performance measure-
ments, such as standard deviation, beta, correlation, alpha, and the 
Sharpe index. Know where your aggregate portfolio falls on the Efficient 
Frontier.
 
 Don’t go it alone. Get a buddy or mentor with the same interests in 
investing. Bounce ideas, concerns, and new knowledge off one another. 
Things are often more easily understood when you have a sounding 
board and two heads thinking about an issue instead of one. Better yet, 
join or start an investment club.
 
 History often repeats itself, so take some time to gain historical per-
spective of the U.S. economy and the stock market. Look specifically 
at difficult periods in U.S. history (see Strategy #2) and find out how the 
market performed leading into it, during it, and afterward.
 
 Seek a professional opinion. Find an hourly, fee-only financial advisor 
in your area to provide a second opinion. The fee may well be worth the 
validation of your assumptions or the discovery of hidden issues.

Take Advantage of Retirement 
Plan Catch-Up Provisions
By Brooke Salvini, CPA/PFS, CCPS
W
ho says nothing good comes with age? If you turn 50 by the end of 
the calendar year (or are already 50+), you have an opportunity to 
make a significant difference in your retirement savings by taking advantage 
of the catch-up provisions the IRS has given you for your 50th birthday.
Catch Up with Age-50 Allowances
Taking advantage of the age-50 catch-up provisions can really add up over 
time. For example, if you contribute an additional $5,000 to your retirement 
plan at the beginning of each year from ages 50 to 65 and you make a modest 
return of 5 percent, you’ll have an additional $113,287 in your retirement sav-
ings account at age 65. That’s nothing to sneeze at.
Go beyond the annual limit
The catch-up provisions detailed in Table 60-1 effectively increases the maximum 
contribution to most retirement plans and IRAs for people 50 and older. You make 
the catch-up allowance in addition to the annual employee-plus-employer limit.

 #60: Take Advantage of Retirement Plan Catch-Up Provisions
In other words, if your employer contributes to your retirement plan through 
profit sharing, matching, or bonuses, the total contributions can reach the 
combined employee-plus-employer limit ($46,000 for 2008). But if you’re 50 
and you use your age-50 catch-up allowance, you and your employer together 
can actually contribute a total of $51,000 — or $48,500 if your plan is a 
SIMPLE 401(k) — to your retirement plan. Wow!
Note: The age-50 catch-up is available for 457(b) plans only if they’re govern-
mental. If you work for a nongovernmental organization that offers a 457(b) 
plan, you can still take advantage of the special catch-up provision described 
later in the section titled “457(b): Last three years before retirement.”
Deal with multiple retirement plans
If you participate in more than one retirement plan, either at the same or dif-
ferent employers, you can make only one age-50 catch-up contribution for all 
your plans combined (except for 457(b) plans). Here are a few examples:
 
 Two 401(k)s: You’re 50 years old, have two part-time jobs, and partici-
pate in the 401(k) plans of two employers. You must apply the age-50 
catch-up allowance to both plans together. That is, you can’t contribute 
more than $5,000 catch-up contributions in total between the two plans.
 
 A 457(b) and plus a different plan: Your employer offers a 401(k) and 
457(b) plan. You participate in both plans. The catch-up limits are 
applied to these plans separately. In 2008, you can defer an additional 
$5,000 catch-up to both your 401(k) and 457(b) plans for a total of 
$10,000 extra retirement savings.
 
 Two 457(b)s: You’re 50 years old, work for two separate employers, and 
participate in the 457(b) plan of each employer. You apply the age-50 
catch-up allowance to both plans together. This means that in 2008, 
you can’t contribute more than $5,000 in total catch-up contributions 
between the two 457(b) plans.
Play Catch-Up with Special Provisions 
for 457(b) and 403(b) Plans
If you participate in either a 457(b) or a 403(b) retirement plan through your 
employer, you should be familiar with a couple of special catch-up provisions 
that aren’t related to turning age 50. Taking advantage of these 457(b) and 
403(b) catch-up provisions can play an important part in securing your retire-
ment savings against the inevitable uncertainties of these (and most other) 
economic times.

258
Part IV: Investing for Accumulators 
457(b): Last three years before retirement
The 457(b) has a special rule saying that for the three years prior to normal 
retirement age (as defined by your employer), you can increase your salary 
deferrals by up to twice the regular limit — up to $31,000 in 2008 — to make 
up for previous years in which you didn’t contribute the full deferral.
If you’re also eligible for the age-50 catch-up, you can choose either the spe-
cial rule or the age-50, whichever gives you the higher catch-up in any year. 
Compare these examples:
 
 High “unused contributions”: You’re 62 and you intend to retire at 65, 
the normal retirement age at your company. Throughout the years, you 
haven’t maximized your 457(b) retirement plan contributions, so you 
have $75,000 of “unused contributions” available for this calculation. In 
2008, you can contribute $31,000 to your 457(b) retirement plan.
 
 Low “unused contributions”: You’re 66 and you plan to retire next 
year at 67. For the last two years, you’ve taken advantage of the special 
457(b) catch-up allowance, so you have only $4,000 of “unused contri-
butions” remaining for the calculation. In this case, you’d choose the 
age-50 catch-up allowance because it’s greater than the special catch-up 
provision.
403(b): Fifteen years of service
You’re eligible for a special $3,000 annual catch-up in your 403(b) (with a life-
time max per employer of $15,000) if you meet both of the following conditions:
 
 You have 15 years of service (not necessarily consecutive years) for the 
same hospital, health agency, public school system, or church.
 
 Your average annual contributions to all the retirement plans offered by 
this employer are less than $5,000 annually.
You can be eligible for both the 15-years-of-service and the age-50 catch-ups 
for a total allowable catch-up in 2008 of $8,000. The 15-years-of-service spe-
cial catch-up is included in the calculation of the employee-plus-employer 
limit ($46,000 in 2008). Compare these scenarios:

259
 #60: Take Advantage of Retirement Plan Catch-Up Provisions
 
 Employee contributions only: You’re 64 and have worked in the church 
office of your parish on and off over the past 25 years, for a total of 15 
years of service. During this time, you’ve never contributed more than 
$5,000 to the church 403(b) retirement plan in any one year. The church 
doesn’t contribute to your 403(b) plan. In 2008, you’re eligible to con-
tribute $8,000 in catch-up contributions — $3,000 special catch-up and 
$5,000 age-50 catch-up — in addition to a regular contribution of $15,500.
 
 Employee-plus-employer contributions: Same facts as in the first 
example, except the church has contributed $28,500 to your plan. Your 
special catch-up contribution is limited to $2,000 because it’s included in 
the calculation of the employee-plus-employer maximum addition limit 
($46,000 for 2008). You can still contribute your age-50 catch-up for a 
combined addition of $51,000.

Be Prepared to Fund Large 
Expenses
By Corry Sheffler, MBA, CFP, CFE
Y
our retirement looms on the horizon. Are you dreaming of that little 
cabin on the lake? Maybe you’re planning to buy a boat and cruise the 
coast. Are your golf clubs going to get a workout on the nation’s premier 
courses?
If you’re thinking about how to fund such large expenses, you’re taking an 
excellent first step! Now — during your peak earning years — is the time to 
look ahead and prepare for those big pre- and post-retirement expenditures.
This strategy tells you how to determine how much you’ll need, how much to 
put away to reach your goal, and where you can put it to grow along the way. 
Because of the appearance of the first large sandwich generation — those 
who face caring for both aging parents and their own children — you also see 
some specific planning information on those topics.
Figure Out How Much You May 
Need and How to Get It
Many large expenses come with a known price tag: what they cost today. 
However, inflation will likely increase that cost when it’s time to buy. Use an 
inflation calculator such as the one from Bankrate.com (www.bankrate.
com/brm/calculators/savings/inflation_calculator.asp) to 
determine the future cost of a large expense.
The cost of some large expenses, such as long-term care or medical 
expenses, are more difficult to estimate. But again, your first step should 
be to find out what something costs today. This may involve a number of 
assumptions, but you have to start somewhere. For example, to plan for in-
home care for elderly parents, you can check with local service providers for 
current costs. Account for inflation based on when you estimate care may 
begin, and you have your target amount.

264
Part V: Heading into Retirement
This section explains how to figure out what you need to reach your goal and 
helps you decide whether to save that money or invest it.
Calculate periodic savings
To figure out how much you need to save, you need to know at least three of 
the following four items:
 
 How much money you’ll need (remember to account for inflation)
 
 When you’ll need it
 
 How much you’ll earn on the money you save
 
 How much you can save, either today and/or each month until you 
reach your goal
With this information in hand, you can use one of the following online cal-
culators to determine what you need to reach your goal: dinkytown.net/
java/Savings.html or apps.finra.org/investor_Information/
Calculators/1/SavingsCalc.aspx.
 
Money you don’t spend now is money saved, but money you do spend now is 
lost savings.
Decide whether to invest or save
When you know how much you need to sock away, the next step is deciding 
where to put that money to make it grow. If your time horizon is short, say 
six years or less, consider an FDIC-insured high-yield savings account, money 
market account, or certificate of deposit (CD) (see Strategy #17). A good site 
to shop for rates is www.bankrate.com. Online banks typically offer the 
best rates, and most are FDIC-insured.
If you have a longer time horizon before you need the money, the higher 
expected returns of balanced or growth-and-income no-load mutual funds 
may make more sense. (See Strategy #21 for more on mutual funds.)
 
As you approach the time when you’ll need this money, shift your invested 
money into savings. Otherwise, if the market drops shortly before you need 
the money, you may not have enough for your goal.

265
 #61: Be Prepared to Fund Large Expenses
Prepare to Assist Family
You may face large expenses if your parents or children need financial help. 
If you plan and save well, and if your finances are secure, you may be in a 
position to offer that help. Extra money gives you the option of helping your 
parents, kids, or both if they need it. Consider the following:
 
 Adult children: As you approach retirement, you may see a need to 
help your adult children. Their issues may include job loss, house fore-
closure, divorce, or health problems. Some people give money to their 
children with no strings attached. Others loan their children money. If 
you opt for a loan, companies that manage loans between relatives, such 
as Virgin Money (www.virginmoneyus.com), may help.
 
 Elderly parents: Besides offering financial support, you may eventually 
need to run all of your parents’ financial affairs. If that happens, con-
sider the services of a financial planner. A financial planner can help you 
understand the complete financial picture as well as estate matters.
 
Keep lines of communication open to be aware of any pending financial issues 
with your adult children or your parents. If you anticipate your help being 
needed, you can estimate an amount as a savings goal. Communicating with 
your kids and parents about money can give you a picture of their situations 
and may allow you to help them avoid bad financial decisions as well as deter-
mine whether they may need help in the future.

Consider Working in Retirement
By Cynthia Freedman
S
ome people discover retirement isn’t what they anticipated, leaving 
them bored and constantly underfoot around the house. And studies 
show that older people who stay physically and mentally active have longer, 
happier, and healthier lives. Your emotional well-being can also improve as 
you engage with other people, make new friends, and become a part of your 
workplace community.
Personal fulfillment is just one reason to consider returning to work. For 
others, reentering the workforce provides a number of concrete benefits, 
especially in uncertain economic times:
 
 Income: Maybe you were downsized unexpectedly or your portfolio 
has lost value. Working in retirement can help make up the shortfall. 
Working part-time during retirement means you can reduce or delay 
withdrawals from your retirement nest egg. Earning $20,000 a year in 
retirement is the equivalent of withdrawing a safe 4 percent per year 
from a $500,000 nest egg. And if income isn’t a pressing issue, working 
can boost your standard of living and provide a little more money to live 
that life of leisure you’ve always wanted.
 
 Health insurance: If you’re looking for help on the insurance front, 
seek out employers that include part-timers in their group health plan. 
Healthcare expenses often rise during retirement years, and Medicare 
requires co-payments and deductibles and may not cover all your medi-
cal costs. You need a Medicare supplemental policy (at an additional 
fee) to help pay some of the healthcare costs not covered under the 
original Medicare plan.
 
 You’re not eligible for Medicare coverage until you’re age 65. Although 
you may be able to continue your existing group health insurance under 
COBRA for up to 18 months, you’ll lose any employer subsidy. Your 
only option may be an expensive individual policy. Getting a job with an 
employer who offers a group health plan benefit can cover that gap in 
your healthcare. Check with the benefits administrator of your employer 
to see how your group health insurance coordinates with Medicare.

267
 #62: Consider Working in Retirement
Note the Drawbacks
Even if you want to go back to work, getting pack on payroll may not be your 
best option. Here’s why:
 
 Current pension benefits: If you’re receiving an ongoing pension ben-
efit, receiving employment income from another source may affect your 
benefit. Check with the pension benefit administrator to see what the 
impact will be. (This isn’t an issue if you received a single lump-sum pen-
sion benefit.)
 
 Leisure time: If you’re still working, you can’t take off on a trip whenever 
you feel like it; you have to comply with the schedule constraints of your 
workplace. And when the holidays arrive, you may be the one who has 
to tend the store while your boss is home with his family.
 
 Taxes: If your job provides you with a high enough salary, you may be 
pushed into a higher income tax bracket. Contact a CPA, Enrolled Agent, 
or other qualified tax professional to see what impact working in retire-
ment will have on your taxes.
 
 As soon as you hit age 70½  , you have to start taking your IRA Required 
Minimum Distributions (RMD), whether you’re working or not. These 
distributions are taxed as ordinary income and are added to your other 
income when computing your total taxable income. And if you’re receiv-
ing Social Security benefits, up to 85 percent of those benefits may 
become taxable, depending on your other income. Also, if you haven’t 
yet reached your full Social Security retirement age, your Social Security 
benefit is reduced if your earnings are above a certain threshold.
If returning to the workforce isn’t essential for your budget, consider vol-
unteering. Many seniors gain the satisfaction of knowing they’ve made a 
significant impact on someone’s life when they work in areas such as sports, 
tutoring programs for youth, or a women’s shelter.
Make the Transition
So you’ve decided you want to work, but you don’t want to go back to the 
same old grind you retired from, and you don’t want to become a greeter at 
the local big box store. What should you do?
 
 Consider your likes and dislikes. Do you like to be with people, or do 
you like to work alone? Are you more productive when you focus on a 
single task, or do you need variety throughout your day? What social 
or philanthropic causes excite you? What hobbies are you passionate 
about?

 Assess your skills and strengths. Think about your job skills in general 
terms to help you see how the skills can transfer to other industries. For 
example, an effective teacher may become a corporate trainer. Also con-
sider personal skills. Are you organized? Do you speak well in front of 
groups?
 
 Realistically consider your physical limitations. Certain jobs may not 
be physically appropriate. Some older people start to lose their mental 
acuity and find it more difficult to learn new procedures, use a com-
puter, or remember where specific items are located. (And your boss 
may not appreciate it if you need to take a nap every afternoon!)
For info about possible careers, see the Department of Labor Occupational 
Outlook Handbook (www.bls.gov/OCO), which lists training and education 
needed, earnings, expected job prospects, what workers do, and working 
conditions.
After you decide what you want to do, you can gear up to reenter the work-
force:
 
 Network. Join a professional organization. E-mail friends and family, tell-
ing them about your plans and asking them whether they know of any 
openings or if they can introduce you to someone who works in your 
target field.
 
 Gain any needed training or experience before you start the job. 
Check course offerings at local colleges or an online university. 
Volunteering, interning, and working through a temp agency are all great 
ways to get experience.
 
 Polish your resume. Many books and articles discuss how to write a 
resume, what to expect in job interviews, and other job search issues. 
(Check out Resumes For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Joyce Lain Kennedy 
[Wiley] or visit www.dummies.com.)
After you find that dream job, enjoy. And remember that at some point, you’ll 
be able to walk away from this job, too, and resume that date with leisure 
time.

Provide for Potential Long-Term 
Care Expenses
By Louise Schroeder, CFP
R
emember being in high school when becoming a senior was some-
thing you happily anticipated? You looked forward to the rest of your 
life and all the wonderful possibilities you could imagine. Sure, you may 
have felt some uncertainty and a bit of trepidation, but mostly excitement. 
Thinking this same way can make a real difference when you prepare for the 
senior years of your life — regardless of the current economic environment. 
Planning to make these years the best years of your life helps you focus on all 
the possibilities that can be open to you.
Improve Your Home
The next part of your prevention plan involves looking at your home as if you 
were currently disabled. Most people would prefer to be cared for in their 
own homes. But most homes, sadly, aren’t equipped to assist with functional 
limitations, such as being in a wheelchair or using a walker to get around. 
Home modifications can help you live independently for a longer time, as well 
as make caring for you easier if and when you need assistance. For example, 
you may consider more complex structural renovations like widening hall-
ways to 4 feet, widening exterior and interior doorways to 3 feet, renovating 
your bathroom by putting in a walk-in shower or bathtub, or installing a stair-
way chair-lift system.
Learning at this stage in your life about potential home modifications to make 
your home more comfortable in the future provides you with a few advantages:
 
 You may want to complete some modifications before you retire, and 
pay for them with current income. Changes can be as simple as adding 
grab bars where needed and changing round doorknobs to the lever 
style.

270
Part V: Heading into Retirement
 
 You may want to cover larger projects by using specific assets to 
finance the costs. Learning about these potential costs can help you in 
setting aside certain assets to preserve, and invest more conservatively, 
for use whenever you may have a need.
 
This part of your prevention plan should also involve learning about assistive 
technology devices. Hundreds of devices and systems are available to help 
individuals with disabling limitations to continue to function on their own. 
Information from the National Council on Disability says that 80 percent of 
elderly people who used assistive technology were able to reduce their depen-
dence on others. You can learn more about assistive technology programs in 
your state at www.resna.org/content/index.php?pid=133.
Review Your Options for Paying 
for Long-Term Care
How are people paying for their long-term care costs these days? A 2006 
study by the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging 
showed these results for the financing of long-term care (in nursing homes, 
assisted living facilities, and at home):
 
 52 percent received unpaid care from family and friends (the “I’ll go live 
with my kids” approach)
 
 20 percent paid with Medicaid
 
 15 percent paid out-of-pocket
 
 8 percent paid with Medicare and other public programs
 
 5 percent paid with private long-term care insurance (discussed later in 
this strategy) and other private resources
The following sections look at each of these financing possibilities so you can 
understand better the consequences of relying on each resource, especially 
in light of the demands baby boomers will place on all resources, public and 
private.
Moving in with the kids
“I’ll just go live with my kids.” How many people you know have made this 
statement when talking about long-term care? What they don’t realize is that 
caregivers end up bearing costs, whether care takes place in the individual’s 
home or in the adult child’s home.

271
 #63: Provide for Potential Long-Term Care Expenses
The financial impact is currently an average loss of $660,000 over the care-
giver’s lifetime due to lost promotions and raises, loss of benefits (especially 
retirement plan contributions), and increased sick days due to caregiver 
stress–related health problems. Donated care by your family and friends is 
an important resource, but planning well ahead of time to include additional 
resources as part of your plan can reduce the impact — physically, emotion-
ally, and financially — on them.
Medicaid and Medicare
Medicare and Medicaid should be considered limited resources, especially 
10 to 15 years from now. Medicare pays only for long-term care related to an 
illness or injury that you’re expected to recover from. When you’re no longer 
improving, Medicare stops paying. Medicaid is intended to provide care for 
people with very low incomes and very limited assets. You can visit with 
your local Medicaid office to find out whether that may be an option for you. 
Keep in mind that when baby boomers reach their mid- to late-80s, demands 
on government programs and services will likely be unsustainable.
 
Some government services and programs that are currently available to indi-
viduals who need long-term care services aren’t restricted by income and 
asset limitations. An excellent resource is the nearest Aging and Disability 
Resource Center, if your state has one. If not, contact your nearest Area 
Agency on Aging office. These agencies can tell you what services are avail-
able in your living area. These offices are a part of the federal Administration 
on Aging network. You can find contact information and locations at www.
eldercare.gov.
Saving on your own
Some long-term care expenses either will occur before you’ll qualify for long-
term care insurance benefits or won’t be covered by long-term care insur-
ance. Setting aside a portion of your own assets to pay for these expenses 
will provide you with more control over your quality of life in your later 
years. It will also provide you with a level of comfort when facing the uncer-
tainty surrounding this potential financial need.
Although you should use a more conservative asset allocation when invest-
ing these assets, inflation will be a large factor in developing your investment 
strategy. When you’re determining what average annual rate of return you 
want to try to achieve for these investments, look at the inflation rate associ-
ated with long-term care costs. Inflation for these costs is higher than the 
general inflation rate (currently at 6 percent versus 4 percent for general 
inflation). For asset allocation suggestions, see Strategy #79.

272
Part V: Heading into Retirement
Purchasing long-term care insurance
Having long-term care insurance provides you with a level of financial flex-
ibility (see Strategy #7 for more information on the ins and outs of this type 
of insurance). But what you may consider “long-term care expenses” may not 
meet the insurance company’s definition. So you need to do your homework.
When long-term care insurance pays
Long-term care policies pay benefits only when you need substantial assis-
tance with at least two activities of daily living or substantial supervision due 
to mental impairment for 90 days or longer. These activities include:
 
 Eating
 
 Dressing
 
 Bathing
 
 Transferring (from a bed to a chair or wheelchair)
 
 Toileting (using the toilet)
 
 Managing incontinence
When long-term care insurance doesn’t pay
Later in life, many people need assistance — on a regular basis — that 
doesn’t reach the level of incapacitation covered by insurance. These kinds 
of limitations often require assistance with daily activities that are unrelated 
to personal care, such as:
 
 Preparing meals
 
 Home maintenance, inside and outside
 
 Laundry
 
 Help with managing money, investments, and legal decisions
 
 Transportation
 
 Shopping
 
 Making and traveling to and from appointments
 
 Taking medications correctly
 
You’ll pay for a lot of your long-term care out of your own pocket. Your suc-
cess in doing so depends on careful planning for retirement to make sure you 
have enough assets to cover your potential costs.

Use Your Home as a 
Source of Income
By JamesTaylor, CFP, and Robert Friedland, PhD
Y
our home is more than just the place where you hang your hat and raise 
your family. It’s one of your biggest investments and an important part 
of the foundation of your financial security. For most people, paying for a 
home takes decades. But when you’ve accumulated a lot of equity or have 
paid off the mortgage, your home could start paying you back. This strategy 
shows you how.
Have the Lender Pay You 
with a Reverse Mortgage
If you have a home, you probably had a mo                                                    
rtgage. In a forward mortgage, you pay the lender every month. With a 
reverse mortgage, the lender pays you! You have a choice of a lump sum, a 
monthly payment, or a line of credit with which you can take out funds when 
needed. Any combination of these choices is also an option.
You don’t have to meet any medical, income, or credit requirements, and 
there’s no income tax liability; however, the amount of the loan increases 
each month because interest accrues on the loan balance. In addition, you 
have to keep the home maintained and insured, and all real estate taxes must 
be paid. The home remains in your name, and no repayment is required until 
maturity of the loan. Maturity occurs
 
 When the last borrower no longer resides in the home due to death or 
sale of the home
 
 When the last surviving borrower fails to live in the home for 12 con-
secutive months

274
Part V: Heading into Retirement
Getting a federally-insured reverse mortgage
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured 
reverse mortgages, also called home equity 
conversion mortgages (HECM), are limited to 
HUD’s 203(b) borrowing limits for your county. 
In 2008, these limits ranged between $200,160 
and $362,790.
To obtain an FHA-insured reverse mortgage, 
you have to be at least 62 and occupy and own 
the house (or owe so little that it’ll be paid off 
with the proceeds of the reverse mortgage). 
Single family homes, cooperatives, and mobile 
homes may be eligible for reverse mortgages 
if they meet HUD standards. The borrower, 
however, must meet with an approved reverse 
mortgage counselor.
Most reverse mortgages allow a six-month period after maturity for repay-
ment and/or sale of the property. Naturally, if the loan isn’t paid off, the 
lender owns the home.
Reverse mortgages are insured either in the private market or by federal, 
state, or local governments. The vast majority of reverse mortgages are fed-
erally insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). A few states, 
such as Connecticut and Montana, have state-insured reverse mortgages, and 
a few local governments throughout the country also have programs. Private 
or proprietary reverse mortgages are available nearly everywhere.
State and local government reverse mortgages are often the least expensive, 
and private reverse mortgages — which often offer the highest borrowing 
amount — cost the most. The interest rate is likely to be higher along with 
the insurance premiums.
What does a reverse mortgage cost? They ain’t cheap! Here’s an example cost 
estimate:
 
 Origination fee: 2 percent of the value of the home or $2,000, whichever 
is less
 
 Appraisal fee: $350 to $500
 
 Credit report fee (to verify whether there are any liens against the 
property): $20
 
 Flood certification fee (is the home in a flood zone?): $20
 
 Recording fees: $75 to $225
 
 Title insurance: $500 or more
 
 Pest inspection: $75 to $150
 
 Survey: $250 to $750 (although you can sometimes use a recent survey)
 
 Escrow and settlement fees: $150 to $450

275
 #64: Use Your Home as a Source of Income
 
 Document preparation fees: $75 to $150
 
 Closing costs: Whatever is common in your area with regular 
mortgages
 
The total cost begins around $4,250 and goes up depending on the value 
of the home. You may pay these costs with proceeds of the loan. These 
high costs should make a reverse mortgage an option of last resort.
Some advisors encourage eligible seniors to get a reverse mortgage 
and put all the proceeds into an annuity. This offers the advantage of a 
guaranteed income for life, whereas monthly income from the reverse 
mortgage can run out before the borrower dies. In addition, the reverse 
mortgage lender can charge up to $35 per payment to the home owner. 
However, the annuity can have income tax consequences. Furthermore, 
the costs of the fees and commissions of the combined reverse mort-
gage and annuity can exceed 20 percent of the funds available.
 
Good sources of information on reverse mortgages include the following:

hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hecm/rmtopten.cfm
 
 AARP: www.aarp.org/money/revmort
Keep Property Rights with a Grantor-
Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)
If you have an estate consisting of real or personal property that has 
appreciated rapidly, you can establish a grantor-retained annuity trust 
Keeping it in the family: A couple more reverse 
mortgage options
You may consider arranging your own reverse 
mortgage with a family member who has the 
resources to provide you the stream of income 
you need. That family member would place a lien 
against your home — just as any other lender 
would — to protect his or her “investment” 
when you eventually pass away or the home 
is sold.
Here’s a similar alternative: If a family member 
is willing and able to purchase your home, he or 
she can make mortgage payments to you and 
let you live in your home as long as you want.

276
Part V: Heading into Retirement
(GRAT) or a grantor-retained unitrust (GRUT). With both, you retain rights to 
your property, get income from the property, and minimize or even eliminate 
taxes when you die. These trusts, however, aren’t for the faint-hearted or 
most middle-income families. They’re irrevocable (meaning you can’t change 
your mind) and require that you have other sources of income besides the 
income generated from the trust.
These trusts are considered grantor retained because you retain access to the 
earnings for a defined period of time. You transfer your property (real and/
or personal) into the trust when you set it up and receive income during the 
retained trust period. These payments can be a fixed amount (GRAT) or can 
vary annually based on the trust’s assets (GRUT). During the trust period, you 
receive taxable payments. At the end of this fixed period, the payments stop 
and any property remaining in the trust passes to your trust’s beneficiaries.
 
The payouts you receive from a GRAT or GRUT reduce the size of the trust, 
enabling you (the grantor) to bypass gifting limits and lessen tax consequences 
from highly appreciated assets such as your home, commercial property, or 
equities. Therefore, you need income and income-producing assets outside 
the GRAT or GRUT to pay trust taxes during the trust period and to provide 
income after the property has moved from the trust to your beneficiaries.
Although you may have good reasons to establish an irrevocable trust, you 
also face some risks:
 
 Dying before the term of the trust expires: If you set up the GRAT 
for five years but die after one, all property remaining in the trust is 
included in your federal estate-tax calculation. Not only do you lose 
the tax advantage for setting up the GRAT, but the cost of creating and 
administering the GRAT is also wasted.
 
 Needing trust assets to appreciate: If assets don’t appreciate at rates 
similar to government bond rates — or if they depreciate — you get no 
tax savings. Be sure to have a diversified portfolio in the trust.
GRATs and GRUTs are sophisticated estate planning techniques, so get the 
help of specialized estate planning attorneys.

Make the Best Use of Your 
Retirement Plan
By Robert Friedland, PhD
I
f you’ve been working for many years, you’ve probably changed employ-
ers a few times. Each employer may have had a retirement plan; some 
may have had more than one. One or more may even have had a post-retire-
ment health plan. Now is the time to be sure you’ll get all the benefits you’re 
entitled to when you retire.
Defined Benefit and Defined 
Contribution: What’s the Difference?
The array of plan types is staggering, but most qualified retirement plans fit 
into one of two basic types. People often refer to both types of plans as pen-
sions, but one is really a pension and the other is a tax-deferred savings plan. 
The pension plan is a defined benefit plan, and the tax-deferred savings plan 
is a defined contribution plan. See Strategy #34 for more info on qualified 
plans.
 
 Defined benefit: In a defined benefit pension plan, the pension benefit 
is defined by a specific formula. The formula determines your pension 
benefit. Formulas vary, but most are based on the number of years you 
worked and your salary.
 
 Defined contribution: In a defined contribution plan, your retirement 
benefit is defined by the contributions made to the plan and the growth 
of those contributions over time. If you didn’t contribute very much, 
didn’t contribute regularly, and didn’t maintain a diversified portfolio, 
or if you contributed sporadically, your retirement benefit may not be as 
large as it could’ve been. This strategy covers catch-up provisions later 
on; they were created just for this situation and recently enacted into law.

278
Part V: Heading into Retirement
Stake Your Pension Claim
If you worked many years for a company that provided a defined benefit 
plan, you’re likely eligible for a pension benefit. If you left after a few years, 
you may have gotten a check from the pension plan. That check effectively 
ended your future pension benefit. (We hope you put it into an IRA.) If you 
didn’t receive a check or lump-sum distribution, your former employer may 
be on the hook to start sending you monthly checks when you reach the age 
defined in that plan. You just need to let the employer know when and where 
to send the check.
If you’ve been getting updates from this employer or the pension plan admin-
istrators, they know you’re out there. If you no longer receive those updates, 
or if you never received them and are fairly sure you were participating in the 
defined benefit pension plan (and didn’t receive a lump-sum distribution), 
let your former employer know you’re getting ready to receive your monthly 
checks.
Because your former employer may not remember you hanging out by the 
water cooler, you may need to refresh their memories. Before you contact 
them, do a bit of homework. Look through those piles of paperwork for info 
on the company defined benefit plan and for evidence that you worked there. 
That old pay stub may work, as will the W-2 you filed with your taxes. If they 
still don’t believe you, you may need to hire a lawyer to help you make your 
claim.
Tabulate Your Defined 
Contribution Accounts
Defined contribution plans come with a lot of clever names like 401(k), 
Money Purchase Plan, 403(b), 457(b), TSA (tax-sheltered annuity), SEP (sim-
plified employee pension), SARSEP (salary reduction simplified employee 
pension), SIMPLE (savings incentive match plan for employees), and stock 
bonus plans, to name just a few. Although these plans have important distinc-
tions — particularly to your employer — from your perspective they tend to 
operate in the same way.
You — the employee — now have a key role. You choose whether and when 
to start participating in the plan, how much to contribute (typically through 
payroll deferral and subject to annual limits), and how to invest your contri-
butions among the choices provided in the plan. Some employers also con-
tribute something, usually matching a fraction of your contributions.

279
 #65: Make the Best Use of Your Retirement Plan
If you had a defined contribution account with a former employer, the account 
is still yours. Depending on the plan design, the employer contributions 
(matches) to your account may also be yours. With some plans, you get to 
keep the employer matching regardless of how long you worked for them 
(immediate vesting); with others, you get to keep employer contributions after 
working there three years (cliff vesting) or six years (incremental vesting).
When you left the company, you may have been able to leave the money 
invested where it was (if the balance was large enough), or you could’ve 
moved that money (or “rolled over”) to another employer plan or to an indi-
vidual retirement account (IRA). Either way, you should be receiving regular 
statements (at least quarterly) informing you of the value of your account 
holdings. If you’ve moved and stopped receiving statements at some point, 
check your old account documents to submit your current address. You 
don’t want to lose money because the plan administrator can’t locate you. 
If you haven’t included the money from old employers and accounts in your 
ongoing monitoring and asset allocation, now is the time to include those 
funds in your investment planning.
Maximize Your Benefits for 
Defined Benefit Plans
If you’re in a defined benefit plan, be sure you understand how the benefit 
formula works. Generally, defined benefit plans are designed to retain com-
pany-specific skills under the assumption that it takes time to acquire the 
necessary skills that the employer values but that older workers are eventu-
ally too expensive. Consequently, benefit formulas tend to reward workers 
more during the years employers see your skills as being the most valuable. 
This may be, for example, after five years but before 18 years. Continuing 
with this example, after the fifth year, each year of service will result in a sig-
nificant increase in the promised monthly pension amount until the 17th year 
of service. Subsequently, each additional year of service doesn’t contribute 
as much of an increase in monthly benefits as in the previous years. Knowing 
how this formula works may help you decide when to retire.
In doing your homework on former employer plans, you may discover that 
you have a former employer for whom a few more years of service will make 
a substantial difference in your monthly checks. You may want to consider 
employment with this former employer so you can increase your years of ser-
vice and, therefore, your monthly pension.

280
Part V: Heading into Retirement
If you’re already collecting benefits from a former employer and you have 
sufficient savings, you may want to consider paying the benefits back. Some 
employers, and public employers in particular, let you in effect buy service 
credits. When you’re older, your life expectancy is shorter, and therefore the 
monthly benefits will be higher. This will be particularly beneficial if you’re in 
excellent health and were fortunate to have long-lived parents and long-lived 
grandparents.
Maximize Your Benefits for 
Defined Contribution Plans
You can’t add years of service to a former employer’s defined contribution 
plan, but you should make sure you’re getting the full matching contribution 
from your current employer. Check with human resources to ensure you’re 
deferring enough of your pay to at least get the full employer match. If your 
plan is relatively low cost with decent investment options, contribute as 
much as you can. In most cases, funding a Roth IRA is a better choice after 
you’ve deferred enough to get the employer match.
In 2008, federal law limited your 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), Roth 401(k), Roth 
403(b), and other SARSEP-type plan contributions to the lower of 100 percent 
of compensation or $15,500. However, starting in the year in which you turn 
50, you can catch up by contributing another $5,000 per year. For SIMPLE 
401(k) plans and SIMPLE IRA plans, the 2008 limits are the lower of $10,500 
or 100 percent of your compensation, but if you’re age 50 or older, you can 
make additional catch-up contributions of $2,500 per year.
 
Contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k) starting the year you reach 
age 50 and continuing until age 67 is likely to add more than $650,000 to your 
retirement savings.
Contributing to your defined contribution plan doesn’t mean you can’t also 
contribute to an individual retirement account (IRA). You may not be able to 
deduct those contributions, but at least the earnings will be compounding 
tax-deferred or even tax-free (if you have a Roth IRA). For more details on 
defined contribution plans and IRAs, check out Strategies #33, #34, and #35.
Before you retire, be sure you know what your retirement benefits will be, 
not only from your current employer but also from all your former employ-
ers. In the meantime, keep making those monthly contributions, especially 
while the market is moving down or sideways.

Understand Retirement Resources
By Janice Swenor, MBA, CFP
W
hen people retired in the 1970s, their sources of retirement income 
were few. They may have had a nice pension and Social Security. 
Their medical care was covered by Medicare and perhaps a company-spon-
sored supplemental plan. Boy, have things changed! Employer pension plans 
are being replaced by retirement plans to which both employers and employ-
ees contribute. Social Security and Medicare both face financial problems in 
the future. So what are your retirement resources, and how do you plan for 
them so you don’t sink in retirement? This strategy has you covered.
Collect Social Security
Even in the best of times, uncertainty pervades the Social Security system. 
Planning for your retirement gets more difficult the younger you are, because 
projections show the system running short of funds in the decades ahead. 
Today, Social Security replaces between 20 and 40 percent of what a retiree 
earned before retirement. Changes in 1983 resulted in a range of full-retire-
ment ages (65 to 67) for those born in 1938 and later.
Review your statement
Grab your most recent Social Security statement. You should receive one 
annually a few months before your birthday. If you don’t have one, or if you 
notice earnings discrepancies, contact your local Social Security office imme-
diately. On your annual statement, you’ll find your projected benefit for age 
62, for your full retirement age (65 to 67), and for age 70.
If your spouse hasn’t worked or earns considerably less than you do, he or 
she will receive half of your benefit or his or her estimated benefit, whichever 
is higher. The same applies if you divorce after ten or more years of marriage 
and your spouse hasn’t remarried.

282
Part V: Heading into Retirement
Make some plans
By 2041, Social Security benefits will fall if current funding problems aren’t 
addressed. How much should you count on when planning your retirement? 
Here are some guidelines:
 
 If you’re under 40, assume you won’t receive any of your retirement 
benefit.
 
 If you’re between 40 and 60, assume you’ll receive 50 percent of your 
benefit.
 
 If you’re 60 or over, assume you’ll receive all of your benefit.
These guidelines will change if Congress passes legislation to improve the 
financial strength of Social Security. When that happens, adjust your plan 
accordingly.
Know what your benefits are
The following circumstances can affect your Social Security benefits:
 
 If you retire at age 62 or before your full retirement age (FRA) and choose 
to take your Social Security benefit then, it’ll be permanently reduced 
based on the number of months until your FRA.
 
 If you continue to earn an income while drawing Social Security before 
your FRA and the amount is over the permitted limit, you’ll be required 
to pay back some or all of your benefit.
 
 Your Social Security benefits may be taxable, up to 85 percent. If your 
total income is above the limit for a single individual or for a couple, 
you’ll pay income tax.
 
 If you work or have worked for an employer who doesn’t withhold Social 
Security tax and who has a pension plan, your benefits may be reduced 
or eliminated due to the Windfall Elimination Program (WEP) or the 
Government Pension Offset (GPO).
Visit your nearest Social Security office or go to the Social Security Web site 
at www.ssa.gov to find answers to individual questions.
Wade through Medicare and Medicaid
Medicare is a federal government health insurance program targeting U.S. citi-
zens and permanent residents 65 and older, those under age 65 with certain 
disabilities, and those of any age with end-stage renal disease; Medicaid, on

the other hand, is a federal medical insurance program administered by each 
state. It targets financially needy people. Limits are placed on the income 
and amount of assets an individual or couple may have in order to qualify 
for Medicaid benefits. Medicare and Medicaid aren’t specifically sources of 
income, but you can use these resources to pay for expenses you incur.

Medicare doesn’t cover a number of items and services, such as deductibles, 
co-insurance, co-payments, yearly physicals, hearing aids, foot care, insu-
lin, long-term care, and so on. To help pay out-of-pocket costs, consider a 
Medigap policy and a long-term care policy. Remember, though, that these 
policies typically cover only one person, so if you and your spouse both want 
coverage, you each need a policy. An alternative is a Medicare Advantage 
Plan, which combines Part A and Part B and sometimes Part D. These plans 
are managed by private insurance companies approved by Medicare. They 
can charge different deductibles, co-payments, or co-insurance.

284
Part V: Heading into Retirement
You have to enroll in Medicare three months prior to turning 65. If you wait, 
your premium may go up 10 percent for each 12-month period that you 
could’ve had it but didn’t. If you’re still covered by your employer’s health 
plan, you can delay coverage, but you still need to sign up.
 
Medicare is in worse financial condition than Social Security. Major changes in 
benefits and/or costs are likely to occur in the near future.
Know Your Employer Pension Plans
Employer pension plans are becoming a rarity as employers change to other 
types of retirement plans. If your employer still offers one, understanding 
your payout options is important. Your income benefit is generally based on 
a formula that includes the number of years of employment, a final average 
salary, and a percentage-of-income replacement factor.
Common payout options include the following:
 
 A single life benefit: This option pays the largest amount over your 
single lifetime. Upon your death, the benefit stops and your surviving 
spouse receives nothing.
 
 A reduced benefit guaranteed for a fixed number of years: Upon your 
death, your spouse receives the benefit for any remaining years left on 
the guarantee period.
 
 A reduced benefit guaranteed over your lifetime and your spouse’s: 
The benefit paid to your spouse on your death may remain the same or 
be reduced.
At retirement, you and your spouse have to sign a waiver if the option you 
choose will result in your spouse’s receiving a reduction in income that may 
have a significant impact on his or her standard of living.
 
Before retirement, you may want to consider a life insurance policy to replace 
any loss of income to your spouse, depending on the payout option you 
choose. Evaluate whether the premium for the insurance makes sense in com-
parison to the additional income you may receive. Make sure the insurance is 
in place prior to signing the release.
Also ask the following questions about your pension:
 
 Is your pension plan integrated with Social Security? Will collecting 
Social Security reduce the amount of your pension benefit?
 
 How financially sound is your pension plan? Can it meet its promised 
benefits, and if so, how far into the future?

285
 #66: Understand Retirement Resources
 
 Will you receive a yearly cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) during 
retirement?
 
 If your employer doesn’t withhold Social Security tax, will your 
Social Security benefits be reduced or eliminated due to the Windfall 
Elimination Provision (WEP) or the Government Pension Offset (GPO)?
Use Personal Retirement Accounts
Depending on your current age, personal retirement and taxable accounts 
may be your only retirement income sources. If you’ve been contributing to 
these accounts on a regular basis, you hope you’ll have enough by the time 
you retire. How much you can plan to withdraw after you retire depends on 
when you retire and your asset allocation before and during retirement.
Be aware of these two important age limits that apply to qualified employer 
retirement plans, such as 401(k) and 403(b) plans, and to traditional IRAs:
 
 Before age 591/2, you’ll pay a penalty for withdrawing money from your 
account, except in special circumstances.
 
 Upon reaching age 701/2, you generally need to start taking an annual 
required minimum distribution (RMD).
For additional information on retirement plans, see Strategies #33, #34, and 
#35. For more info on investment strategies before and after retirement, see 
Strategies #56 through #59.
Collect Income from Continued 
Employment or Self-Employment
The definition of retirement has changed over the last 20 years. Retirement 
is often about having the financial freedom to do what you want. This may 
mean working part time, opening a small business, or working full time at a 
job you love.
 
If you’re planning to work past your full retirement age, remember that health 
issues may derail your plan. Make sure that by a specific age, such as 65 or 67, 
you’re set financially regardless of whether you decide to work. This target 
age will vary depending on your current health and family history.

Make Sure You’re 
Accumulating Enough
By Ben Jennings, CPA/PFS, CFP
N
aval aviators (think Top Gun) have a tough job: landing a jet that’s 
moving at 150 mph and buffeted by wind and turbulence in a space 
20 feet wide and 135 feet long on a carrier deck that’s possibly heaving in 
stormy seas and always moving away at an angle. One tool they depend on 
is a lens reflecting a colored light (the ball) up the target glide slope to the 
ship’s flight deck.
Preparing for retirement during an uncertain economy can make you feel like 
one of those pilots. Experiencing market volatility is stressful. The founda-
tional questions to ask are “Am I still on track to have enough?” and “How 
much will be enough?”
Determine How Much Is Enough
The answer to how much is enough depends, of course, on the answer to 
another question: Enough for what?
Estimate retirement spending needs
You can estimate your retirement spending needs by using a couple of 
approaches: top-down or bottom-up.
Top-down
Common rules of thumb assume some replacement ratio, a percentage of your 
pre-retirement income that will cover your spending needs in retirement. 
Think of this as the top-down approach. The replacement ratio is easy to cal-
culate, but you need to think carefully about adjusting it to your situation.

287
 #67: Make Sure You’re Accumulating Enough
Replacement ratios often use 70 to 80 percent of pre-retirement gross 
income. This lower amount reflects that during retirement, you won’t have to 
allocate money for retirement savings, a mortgage you paid off before retire-
ment, payroll taxes, and so on.
Bottom-up
A more refined method for estimating retirement needs is the bottom-up 
approach: Start with your expenses now and consider how they may change 
in retirement.
Some expenses will, of course, go down:
 
 Your mortgage will hopefully be paid off before retirement, but costs 
such as property taxes will continue.
 
 If you have kids, you know how much money they required.
 
 You don’t typically need life and disability insurance in retirement.
On the other hand, you have additional costs to consider:
 
 You may want to spend more on travel, entertainment, or hobbies.
 
 Medical insurance previously paid by your employer is a new addition 
to your budget.
 
 Household services and maintenance you do or did yourself may need 
to be outsourced at some point.
 
 Whether or not you use insurance to help, you need some way to 
account for potential long-term care expenses (see Strategy #63).
Finally, make sure you consider costs you’ll incur only periodically:
 
 Long-term home maintenance is a big one. Think about roof replace-
ment, painting, major appliance replacement, and so on. A common 
guideline for annual costs is 1 percent or more of the home’s value.
 
 You’ll want to replace your car from time to time.
 
 You may have to pay for special family events, such as weddings, that 
fall during your retirement years.
Convert current spending targets 
to future dollars
Whatever your estimated expenses may be, they’re likely to cost more in 
ten years than they do now. So far, you’ve probably thought of your future 
expenses in today’s dollars. Now you need to adjust for inflation.

288
Part V: Heading into Retirement 
You may want to use one of the following two approaches. First, you may use 
an average rate of increase over time. Be aware, though, that prices for goods 
and services consumed by Americans over age 62 can be significantly more 
than average.
Alternatively, you can look at the specific mix of expenses you anticipate in 
retirement and consider how these may change over time to create your per-
sonal inflation rate:
 
 A few may stay about the same (long-term care insurance premiums, any 
mortgage repayments remaining in retirement).
 
 Most will increase about with general inflation.
 
 Others will go up much faster than inflation. For example, medical costs 
generally have been going up at about twice the rate of general inflation.
Table 67-1 lists multipliers for various periods of time until retirement, 
assuming average inflation rates of 3 or 4 percent:

For example, suppose you’re 15 years from retirement, anticipate a 3-percent 
average annual inflation, and determine you’ll need $30,000 in today’s dol-
lars. Multiply $30,000 by 1.56, and you see that at 3-percent inflation, your 
expenses will be $46,800 by the time you reach retirement.
Calculate the assets required
After you determine your total expenses to be covered each year, subtract 
the portion that future income sources (such as a pension or Social Security) 
will provide during retirement.

289
 #67: Make Sure You’re Accumulating Enough
A good tool for determining future Social Security income is your annual 
Social Security statement. The benefit amounts on these statements are in 
today’s dollars, so just subtract the estimated benefit from your spending 
target before multiplying by the inflation factor in Table 67-1.
If you use the top-down approach (see the earlier “Estimate retirement 
spending needs” section), remember that this federal program is designed to 
favor lower-income earners — the social part of Social Security. One reason 
is the assumption that lower-income earners have reduced opportunities to 
save and invest during their working lives (so if you do have the opportunity, 
you need to take it!).
The Social Security Administration estimated in 2007 that a couple, both 65 
years old and with a single earner, would receive benefits replacing between 
40 percent (assuming high earnings of $86,046) and 60 percent (assuming 
medium earnings of $38,726) of their pre-retirement income. This estimate 
seems pretty optimistic; you’d be better off assuming Social Security will 
replace 25 percent of your pre-retirement family income.
Now you’re ready to determine the number:
 
1. Determine either a certain percentage of your pre-retirement income 
or calculate the specific expenses that add up to your desired amount 
in dollars.
 
 For example, perhaps you need 50 percent of your pre-retirement 
income of $60,000, which would be $30,000. (See the “Estimate retire-
ment spending needs” section.)
 
2. Convert that dollar amount to a likely equivalent in future dollars.
 
 For example, maybe your $30,000 needs to grow to $46,800 by the time 
you retire. (See “Convert current spending targets to future dollars.”)
 
3. Reduce your retirement need by the amount to be provided by Social 
Security.
 
 For example, if Social Security will cover $11,700, or 25 percent of your 
$46,800, you have to fund $35,100 from your savings.
 
4. Multiply that number by 20 and write it down; then multiply it by 25 
and write that down.
 
 This step calculates the upper and lower ends of the target range for 
your investment accumulation for retirement. The 20 and 25 factors 
result from several historical studies that found that initial withdrawal 
rates between approximately 4 and 5 percent can sustain withdrawals 
over at least 30 years.

290
Part V: Heading into Retirement 
 
 For example, suppose you determine you need $35,100 in the first year 
of your retirement. Multiply that by 20 for a result of about $700,000. 
Multiply by 25, and the result is $875,000. This means $700,000 to 
$875,000 is a good range for total savings. You can withdraw $35,100 
from your investments in the first year of retirement, adjust that amount 
annually for inflation, and have a high degree of confidence you won’t 
run out of money during a 30-year retirement.
Figure Out Whether You’re On Track
After you know how much is enough, you have to figure out whether you’re 
saving enough to get you there. You need to know the following:
 
 Your current savings: Include IRAs, 401(k)s, and taxable and other 
investment assets. You probably shouldn’t include your home equity or 
other assets that you can’t convert to cash in retirement.
 
 How much your investments should earn: Keep in mind that many 
market observers may be anticipating investment returns below the 
long-term historical average in the next few years. For additional con-
siderations, see the nearby sidebar, “Where all the returns are below 
average.”
 
 How much you’re saving each year: This includes not only salary defer-
rals and after-tax savings but also any employer contributions to your 
retirement account.
Also consider whether your savings are increasing each year. This tends to 
be automatic if you’re saving a percentage of your income, but you may need 
to evaluate this number if you target a specific dollar amount each year. If 
your savings aren’t increasing annually, do you anticipate saving more later 
(for example, when the kids are out of college)?
 
If you find you need to save more, increase savings by directing at least a 
portion of your pay raises to savings. This can be a more comfortable way of 
gradually adjusting your lifestyle to a sustainable level.
By far the easiest way to evaluate needed savings is to use one of the many 
Web-based investment calculators. The investment goal calculator at www.
dinkytown.net/java/InvestmentVariables.html is good. Note: 
Because you express your investment goal in future dollars in this book, you 
don’t need to account for inflation again and can assume 0-percent inflation 
as a calculator input.
Compare the result from your online calculator to the target you previously 
determined, and you’ll have some idea whether you’re on the right track 
amid the market turbulence.

Allocate Assets at the Current 
Stage of Your Life
By Garry Good, MBA
Y
our investment mix should always reflect your financial objectives, 
time horizon, and risk tolerance. A well-designed portfolio has to be 
aggressive enough to achieve your financial goals while minimizing the risk of 
having to sell assets during a bear market.
Take this windmill analogy: Suppose you own a windmill that pumps water 
from a well. This windmill has two gears. In low gear, the mill rotates with 
even the slightest breeze — pumping 100 gallons of water every day — slow 
but steady, never more, never less. In high gear, the windmill pumps water 
at a much faster space — up to 1,000 gallons per day. However, running the 
pump in high gear takes a very stiff wind — the windmill may go days without 
pumping a single drop. Still, over an extended period of time, high gear can 
always be counted on to average at least 200 gallons per day.
Now consider the following scenarios:
 
 You have a 10,000 gallon tank available to collect and store water from 
your well. Which gear would you select to run your mill?
 
 Your storage tank holds only 500 gallons. Also, your essential water 
needs are a minimum of 100 gallons per day. Is it time to shift gears?
Just as you can select the gear that best matches your storage tank capacity, 
you have to select the asset mix to match your time horizon.
Like a pump in high gear, an aggressive asset allocation is unpredictable in 
the short-term but will deliver maximum output given adequate time. Like 
the large storage tank, time serves as the buffer against uncertainty. Lose this 
buffer, and you’re left with no choice: You have to downshift into a slower, 
more reliable gear: a more-conservative investment allocation. This strategy 
tells you how and when to make the switch as you approach retirement.

292
Part V: Heading into Retirement
Decide When to Switch to a More 
Conservative Asset Allocation
How do you know when to start downshifting your portfolio? And how much 
change is required? Before answering, you have one more factor to consider: 
your tolerance for short-term risk. The next three sections cover aggressive, 
moderate, and conservative investors.
Aggressive investor
For an aggressive investor (with a high risk tolerance), a transition path for 
your portfolio may look something like Figure 68-1.
Upon retirement, you’ll need a reliable income stream — something an 
aggressive portfolio isn’t optimally designed to do. This calls for a less 
volatile asset mix, but you can’t wait until retirement to flip the switch. 
Converting an aggressive portfolio into income-distribution mode takes a 
more extensive change. Start the transition early — ten years prior to retire-
ment — to avoid forced selling of securities during a bear market. Keep in 
mind that market cycles sometimes last several years.

As you make this transition, note that your personal risk tolerance hasn’t 
changed. You may be tempted to keep the throttle wide open with higher-risk 
investments; however, you have to let your time horizon trump your attitude 
about risk.
In the final stage of the process, you’ll need to convert enough funds into 
cash-like instruments to cover retirement expenses over a one- or two-year 
period. This reserve may seem excessive, but it provides a buffer, giving you 
more control over when to liquidate assets for income.
Moderate investor
As a moderate investor, you can stomach a loss — within limits — but a more 
balanced portfolio helps you sleep better at night. After you’ve developed a 
moderate portfolio, your transition path to retirement should be a breeze. 
Compared to the aggressive investor, the required changes are less severe 
and can begin later. Remember — your risk tolerance has already reduced 
the volatility in your portfolio. Start the process five years before retiring, as 
Figure 68-2 illustrates.

Conservative investor
As the conservative investor, you enjoy watching the money flow while the 
market goes strong. Then the money stops coming in — and you go a while 
without. You begin to think, what if the money flow never starts up again? 
Do you need a different investment? Does this sound familiar? If so, you can’t 
handle high gear! And your portfolio should look like Figure 68-3.
In this case, your risk tolerance takes precedence over time horizon as a con-
trolling factor in your portfolio design. You may not even need to change the 
pace — you’re already in first gear. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with 
that. A portfolio that exceeds your risk tolerance is like an accident waiting to 
happen. During a bear market, you’ll be pressured to sabotage your plan by 
selling off assets at precisely the wrong time.
 
A highly conservative asset allocation 30 years before retirement may make it 
impossible to amass enough wealth for a comfortable retirement. Make sure 
you have realistic expectations and that your investment returns will be ade-
quate to achieve your goals. If not, you may be tempted to play catch-up and 
assume too much risk later on.

 #68: Allocate Assets at the Current Stage of Your Life 
Transition to a More Conservative 
Asset Allocation
As soon as you have an appropriate transition path for your portfolio, you 
need a plan to manage the process. Here are some suggestions.
Use new contributions to revise the asset mix
If you’re making significant contributions to your retirement savings, you can 
change your portfolio’s asset allocation by simply applying a more conserva-
tive mix to all new investments.
Consider the following example: Your current age is 50, and you plan to retire 
in 15 years. You have $800,000 in current savings, 80 percent of which is equi-
ties ($640,000) and 20 percent of which is fixed income ($160,000). Your goal 
is to steadily transition your asset allocation to a 76-24 split in five years. 
Your annual contributions, including employer match, total $24,000 per year. 
The solution? Designate a 50-50 allocation to all new savings. In five years, 
your overall portfolio (ignoring growth) will stand at $700,000 equities (76 
percent) and $220,000 fixed income (24 percent).
Modify your rebalancing plan
One way to change your asset allocation is to incorporate a shift in your 
asset mix while carrying out a typical portfolio rebalancing program. 
Normally, rebalancing involves swapping funds to restore a portfolio to your 
original asset allocation targets. Some investors may choose to rebalance on 
some regular basis — annually is usually sufficient.
Alternatively, you can establish a predetermined deviation trigger, which 
signals the need to rebalance. For example, if your desired mix is 60-40, you 
can opt to rebalance whenever your allocation in equities either exceeds 65 
percent or falls below 55 percent.
Sometimes during a market decline, your portfolio may even self-adjust to a 
more conservative allocation. In this event, a corrective change may not be 
required and you can avoid selling equities during a down cycle. Conversely, 
you may see equity allocation increase during a period of market growth. 
This provides a win-win opportunity to benefit from market timing — you’ll 
be selling appreciated stock to reduce your asset allocation below its prior 
level.
Strategy #77 names a rebalancing plan that can take you through retirement.

Minimize Your Portfolio Risk
By William Keffer, ChFC, CFP
You may be bearing down on retirement with a full head of steam. It’s 
going to be a fast-paced schedule of skydiving, casino trips, and adven-
ture travel for you, right? When it comes to your retirement nest egg, how-
ever, you may want to check some of that adventure mentality at the door. 
Without the right amount of risk in your portfolio and a clear idea of your 
needs, you may find yourself having to ratchet back your recreation plans — 
not because you’re physically unable but because you can’t afford them. In 
this strategy, you discover how to handle investment risks.
Assess Your Need for Income
You can’t assess the risks to your portfolio if you don’t know for sure what 
you need to live on. Therefore, your first step is to assess how much income 
you’ll likely need in retirement.
Identify your basic needs foundation
If you were building a house, would you start by figuring out what kind of 
doorknobs and decorative lighting you wanted? Hopefully, your first concerns 
would be a solid foundation and structural design. The foundation of a solid 
retirement income plan involves knowing your basic living expenses, especially 
in uncertain times. Even if you’re fortunate enough to have substantial savings, 
it’s important to know at a detailed level your basic ongoing living costs.
The old rule of needing 70 to 80 percent of your current income during 
retirement may or may not apply to you. Do you pay significant job-related 
expenses like commuting costs, clothing, or professional fees? Yes, these will 
go down, but things like medical and long-term care insurance and travel and 
leisure costs will probably go up.
Accept the importance of a (yawn) budget
Fact is, everyone’s needs are different, and needs differ from wants and 
luxuries. Thinking about what you could live without isn’t fun, but it’s worth 

297
 #69: Minimize Your Portfolio Risk
taking the time to identify precisely what you need to live on so you can find 
a way to get a secure income stream or safe assets to support it.
This is where a budget comes in. Look through recent credit card and bank 
statements. Enter your must-have monthly expenses on a worksheet. Budget 
tools are available in most personal finance software, or you can do an online 
search for “budgeting terms.” After you enter your current numbers, do a retire-
ment version. Think through it item by item. If your monthly need is greater than 
your monthly income, the difference must come from your portfolio.
Assess Your Need for Liquidity
Having enough accessible liquid assets on hand when major needs arise is 
critical, not only to your mental stability but also to protecting your portfolio 
in uncertain markets. The last thing you want to do is to sell assets in a down 
market to cover living expenses or a vacation.
 
Retirement budgeting starts with knowing what you need and when you need 
it. Basic expenses come first. Make sure you plan for other major expenditures 
outside your regular budget, such as car replacements, home maintenance 
projects, or maybe leisure travel. A goal tree that identifies these major liquid-
ity events can help.
Make Sure the Funds Are There
When you know your needs, work on protecting the nest egg you’ve accumu-
lated. This section explains how to limit investment risks and make sure the 
money will be available when you need it.
Increase returns while decreasing risk
 
In an uncertain market, the key to managing risk is diversification. By combin-
ing different types of investments, you can get the major benefit of diversifica-
tion: a relatively high rate of growth, with smaller fluctuations in total value 
from year to year.
The most common measure of investment risk is called standard deviation. 
Standard deviation measures volatility, or how much annual returns deviate 
from average returns. High volatility means the security’s value goes drasti-
cally up or down from one year to the next. Consider two baseball players: 
They have the same number of total bases, but one hits singles every time, 
while the other swings for the fences, striking out a lot, but also hitting more 
home runs. Same average, different standard deviation.

Standard deviation — and growth potential — differs for different types of 
securities:
 
 Stocks, which produce the highest long-term returns, have higher stan-
dard deviations than bonds.
 
 Small company stocks are more volatile but grow more than large com-
pany stocks.
 
 International company stocks, especially those from emerging markets 
like India and China, have even higher returns and standard deviations.
The neat thing for investors is that the returns produced by these different 
types of investments don’t move in the same direction at the same time. Their 
returns aren’t correlated. So when stocks are down, bonds may be up. When 
U.S. markets are in the doghouse, Asian companies’ stocks may be booming.
Investing in non-correlated securities produces reduced volatility (or risk) and 
higher returns. Say you have half your money in a U.S. stock fund and the other 
half in a bond fund. Although the return on the portfolio is simply the average 
returns of the two funds, the standard deviation, or risk, of the two combined 
is less than the average of the two funds’ individual standard deviations.
Manage other risks to your portfolio
In addition to volatility of individual securities, you also face risks related to 
your life span, market changes, and more. Table 69-1 explains how to mini-
mize risks.

Manage Your Qualified Retirement 
Plan Investments
By Kathy Hankard
T
raditionally, retirement was a pension plan courtesy of your employer. 
These days, that’s rarely the case. Most folks are responsible for fund-
ing their own retirement (with some assistance from Social Security)  — and 
that’s just what qualified retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and 
more, were designed to do.
Maybe you’ve been putting money away in your retirement plan for years. 
And maybe you’ve paid attention to how the money was invested — or 
maybe not. Now’s the time to take stock of what you have, determine what 
you need, and make a plan to get there.
Figure Out What You Have
To determine whether you have enough saved (or whether you’re on track to 
save enough), you first need to know how much you have. Add up the follow-
ing (and see Strategy #66 for more on retirement income):
 
 The vested balance in your current employer plan (if you’re not 100 per-
cent vested, you’re not entitled to the full balance — if you quit tomor-
row, how much would you get?)
 
 Money still lingering in an old employer plan
 
 Money in IRAs (traditional or Roth)
 
 Money in regular, taxable accounts earmarked for retirement
For example, perhaps you have $400,000 in your employer plan, $50,000 in an 
old plan, $25,000 in an IRA, and $25,000 in other accounts. That gives you a 
total of $500,000.

301
 #70: Manage Your Qualified Retirement Plan Investments
Calculate What You Need
Determining how much you have is a lot easier than figuring out how much 
you’ll need. There are a gazillion variables, but follow these steps to get a 
rough idea:
 
1. Determine current living expenses.
 
 How much money do you spend each year? If you have no idea, take a 
look at your tax return and W2. Subtract your actual taxes paid (federal, 
state, and FICA) from your income. Then subtract any money saved. The 
remainder is being spent. Here’s an example:
 
 $100,000 income – $20,000 taxes – $10,000 savings = $70,000
 
2. Figure out retirement living expenses.
 
 Do you think you’ll spend more or less in retirement? Adjust the answer 
from Step 1 accordingly. (You can say less only if you really plan to 
change your lifestyle — but health care costs will probably take care of 
that). A paid-off mortgage is a legitimate reason for reduced expenses.
 
 $70,000 current living expenses – $12,000 paid off mortgage = 
$58,000
 
3. Determine what you need to provide annually from savings.
 
 Subtract your projected Social Security benefit (per your most recent 
statement) from the answer to Step 2. Also subtract any pensions or 
other income that’ll continue in retirement. That’s how much money 
you’ll need to provide each year to fund your retirement.
 
 $58,000 retirement living expenses – $20,000 S.S. benefit = $38,000
 
4. Take 4 percent of the total you’ve saved.
 
 Use the calculation from the preceding section. The answer is how much 
your savings could probably provide for you annually.
 
 4% × $500,000 = $20,000
 
5. Determine your savings shortage.
 
 Take the difference between Step 3 and Step 4, and multiply it by 25. 
That’s about how much more you need to save to fund your retirement.
 
 ($38,000 – $20,000) × 25 = $450,000

302
Part V: Heading into Retirement
Consolidate Old Plan Assets
If you have money in an old employer plan, you want to roll it into an IRA in 
most cases. Why? The employer plan probably has a limited set of invest-
ment options, and it likely has additional fees that you wouldn’t have to pay 
in an IRA. An IRA has the same tax-deferral benefit.
You can open an IRA at a discount brokerage or a no-load mutual fund com-
pany, such as Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price. Note that you can’t roll 
over your current qualified employer plan until you actually quit working for 
that employer.
 
Here are some precautions to take when doing a rollover:
 
 Be aware that if you do the IRA rollover with a broker, you’ll be charged 
a commission — up to 5.875 percent of your total account value. Just be 
sure you ask and know exactly what you’re paying.
 
 Be sure you do a direct rollover from your employer plan to your new 
IRA, or you’ll risk owing income tax on the entire amount. Just triple-
check with the employer and the new IRA custodian to ensure your 
rollover is direct. Ideally, the employer and the new custodian will coop-
erate and do a trustee-to-trustee transfer — so you never actually have 
access to the money — and therefore can’t be taxed or penalized. You 
never want a rollover IRA check paid directly to you.
 
 Don’t invest your IRA rollover in an annuity. The major reason to own 
an annuity is for tax-deferral. Your retirement accounts are already tax-
deferred, so don’t pay the extra costs associated with an annuity.
 
If you have highly appreciated employer stock in a 401(k), a tax strategy 
known as net unrealized appreciation (NUA) may reduce your tax burden. See 
Strategy #34 for more information. This strategy is complex, so make sure you 
consult a financial professional.
 
If you were born before 1936, you may be able to use special ten-year averag-
ing and possibly capital gains treatment on a lump sum distribution from your 
employer plan. This could result in significant tax benefits and may override 
the advantages of rolling over your qualified plan into an IRA.

Invest to Supplement 
Income Needs
By Kevin Brosious, MBA, CPA, CFP
O
ne of the best ways to save for retirement is through automatic payroll 
deductions into tax-advantaged retirement plans. These retirement 
plans are often called qualified because of their special tax status. Examples 
include 401(k)s, IRAs, and SEP IRAs. Because of the special tax status, you’re 
limited on how much you can contribute. Consequently, many people have a 
significant percentage of their assets outside qualified plans.
For these savings, the goal is to invest in a tax-efficient way while maximizing 
portfolio growth. Accumulating funds is one thing; keeping them from the tax 
collector is quite another. This strategy explains how to do both.
Invest with an Eye on the Tax Man
Keep any cash you’ll need in three or fewer years in short-term, low volatility 
investments like short-term CDs or money market funds.
 
You should be aware of investments that’ll harm your portfolio’s long-term 
return if you include them in taxable accounts. If you’re in a high marginal fed-
eral tax bracket, here’s a plan:
 
 Put a portion of the money you’ll need in three years or less into munici-
pal bond funds. These funds are usually tax-free at the federal level, with 
some funds also tax-free at the state and local level (triple tax-free).
 
 Avoid real estate investment trusts (REITs) and Treasury inflation-
protected securities (TIPS). These investments can throw off high tax-
able dividends. If these investments are appropriate for your portfolio, 
hold them in qualified accounts. If possible, hold bonds and bond funds 
in qualified plans, too, because they also generate high tax income.

304
Part V: Heading into Retirement
 
 Use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) instead of mutual funds because the 
latter have mandatory taxable distributions. If you have to use mutual 
funds, research carefully to see which funds perform best after taxes.
 
 Use individual stocks only if you can broadly diversify your portfolio 
and if you have the time and expertise to pick stocks.
To compare the tax-free yield to an equivalent after-tax investment, divide 
the return of the tax-free investment by 1 minus your marginal tax rate. For 
example, suppose you’re in the 38-percent combined state and federal tax 
bracket and that an intermediate-term tax-free bond fund currently yields 3 
percent. The after-tax equivalent yield is calculated as follows:
3 percent ÷ (1 – 38%) = 4.84% equivalent after-tax return
If a taxable bond or bond fund beats that 4.84 percent, invest there instead.
Use Equity Funds for Taxable 
Investments
In most cases, equity funds are more appropriate for the taxable portion 
of your portfolio than bond funds. Equity fund returns, which include both 
capital gains and dividends, are taxed at a maximum federal tax rate of 15 
percent (if held for one year or more) and can go as low as zero for taxpay-
ers in the 15-percent or lower bracket. Of course, if you’re a retired investor 
who’s currently drawing down your portfolio, keep two to three years’ worth 
of required funds in short-term investment vehicles.
Skipping REITs and TIPS in taxable accounts
REITs and TIPs are outstanding investment 
choices for most investors but only for quali-
fied plans. REIT dividends are nonqualifying 
dividends, so if you hold them in a taxable 
account, they’re taxed at ordinary income tax 
rates rather than the maximum dividend tax rate 
of 15 percent.
TIPS pay semiannual interest, and the prin-
cipal is continuously adjusted by an amount 
equal to the consumer price index (CPI). The 
principal adjustment is payable only when the 
bond matures, but you owe tax annually on this 
adjustment. So if you hold TIPS inside a taxable 
account instead of a tax-advantaged account, 
you’ll pay tax on the “phantom” income (princi-
pal adjustment) even though you won’t receive 
any distribution of funds.

305
 #71: Invest to Supplement Income Needs
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are often a better choice than traditional 
mutual funds in a taxable portfolio, especially if you’re an equity investor. 
ETFs trade on an exchange, like a stock. In most instances, they’re designed 
to track the performance of an index. ETFs invest in stocks, bonds, commodi-
ties, and even currency exchanges. ETFs behave like mutual funds in many 
ways and also have a couple of advantages:
 
 Tax advantages: ETFs have a considerable tax advantage over mutual 
funds, which is critical when investing outside tax-advantaged accounts. 
ETFs trade like stock and have similar tax consequences. Unlike most 
mutual funds, which must declare capital gains on an annual basis, 
triggering tax consequences for the investor, capital gains on ETFs are 
typically declared only on the sale of the security. So, like stock, most 
capital gains (and the associated tax consequence for those gains) can 
be deferred indefinitely until you want to sell your ETF shares. This 
tax deferral helps you realize greater compounding and return on your 
investment.
 
 Low cost: ETFs have low annual expenses and no sales fees. Because 
ETFs trade like a stock, you don’t pay a load when purchasing. You do 
pay normal trading commissions. In addition, ETFs offer some of the 
lowest annual management expenses in the industry.
 
 Considering that more than 75 percent of mutual funds can’t match the 
performance of their benchmark index, an ETF is a sensible choice for 
many investors.
After-tax contributions to a 401(k) plan
One investment option is to contribute more to your 401(k) plan. As of this 
writing, individuals can contribute up to $15,500 pre-tax money per year to 
their 401(k) or 403(b) plans (or $20,500 if they’re age 50 or over). In addition, 
they can make post-tax contributions up to $46,000 per year.
However, you’re better served by making post-tax contributions into ETFs 
because any distributions from a 401(k) or 403(b) plan are taxed at ordinary 
income tax rates, versus 15-percent maximum tax rate for capital gains and 
dividend distributions from your post-tax ETFs. And you have no mandatory 
minimum distribution required from your post-tax contributions into your 
ETFs. The same logic applies to funding a nondeductible IRA versus making 
post-tax contributions into ETFs.

Benefits Timing: Make Social 
Security Work for You
By Tom Nowak, CFP
U
nlike most investments, your contributions to Social Security weren’t 
exactly voluntary. That tiny issue aside, a great way to make Social 
Security work for you is to look at it as an investment. Some of the consider-
ations in analyzing investments are evaluating risk, looking at the tax angles, 
contemplating your time horizon, and controlling your emotions. But one of 
the most critical decisions in investing is when to buy and when to sell.
The good news is that your buy decision has already been made: You’re in 
the program or you aren’t. The bad news? The sell decision takes some seri-
ous thought. For Social Security, the sell decision is choosing the date you 
begin to take benefits. This date may be as early as your 62nd birthday or as 
late as your 70th birthday. Of course, up until age 70, the later you wait to 
begin taking benefits, the higher your monthly benefit will be.
Social Security is designed to provide for you in your old age. The built-in 
incentives to delay starting benefits are significant. Financial planners often 
provide a source-of-income chart in their planning reports. In many cases, 
the Social Security component grows to become the largest single source of 
income in one’s later years because Social Security payments have an annual 
cost of living adjustment. Other income sources either don’t keep up with 
inflation or simply get spent down.
In this strategy, you discover factors that go into the decision of when to 
start collecting. Note: As with other investments, Social Security decisions 
are not one-size-fits-all. The government-sponsored Web site www.ssa.gov 
is chock full of information that you should become familiar with.
 
You don’t have to apply for Social Security benefits and retire at the same 
time. Look at your overall plan for income to see what’s in your long-term best 
interest. See Strategy #66 for more information on how to make all your retire-
ment income work together.

310
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
Look at the Tax Angles
As with other investments, one of the secrets of success is to understand the 
tax benefits and the tax traps. Look at the big picture to develop a strategy 
that avoids unnecessary taxes (as the saying goes, it’s not what you earn; it’s 
what you keep — legally). Here are two particular considerations to keep in 
mind:
 
 If you start taking your Social Security payout too early, before your 
full retirement age (between ages 65 and 67, depending upon your year 
of birth), you’ll be subject to a 50 percent tax on earned income above 
the allowed limit for the year. In 2008, this limit is $13,560. (Check out 
Working after Retirement For Dummies, by Lita Epstein, for more 
information.)
 
 Social Security benefits may be taxable if your other income — includ-
ing pensions, wages, interest, and dividends — plus half of your Social 
Security exceeds a base amount of $25,000 for singles or $32,000 for mar-
ried couples. The tax may be anywhere from 50 to 85 percent of your 
Social Security benefit, depending on how much you exceed the base 
amount.
You can view delaying Social Security benefits as a deferred-income strategy, 
with the goal of maximizing ultimate return and peace of mind as well.
 
Sometimes things just don’t seem to work out. If your nest egg has lost signifi-
cant value, you may have to work longer to give it a chance to grow back. If 
you can’t work full time, consider part-time work. If you can’t work at all, you 
probably can’t consider delaying your Social Security benefit. See Strategy #76 
for ideas on how to allocate your remaining assets for this stage of your life.
If looking at the IRS tax tables makes your eyes glaze over, that’s understand-
able. Just be sure to talk to your tax preparer and financial planner before 
filing for benefits.
Contemplate Your Time Horizon
The purpose of your Social Security income stream is to provide income 
when you’re older and in less of a position to earn wage income. With any 
luck, you’re in good enough health to be more concerned about running out 
of money than breath. But consider your health when deciding when to begin 
taking Social Security benefits:

311
 #72: Benefits Timing: Make Social Security Work for You
 
 If your doctor is constantly giving you a hard time about a growing 
number of risk factors, maybe you’re a good candidate for taking ben-
efits as soon as possible (typically age 62).
 
 If there’s a reasonable chance that you’ll live past 80 (“the new 60”), you 
should consider delaying benefits for what’ll seem like a long time — to 
age 66, 67, or even 70.
 
Even if you don’t expect to live into your 90s, waiting to start your Social 
Security benefits until age 70 can have a significant effect if you die before 
your spouse, particularly if your lifetime earnings were much higher than 
your spouse’s. When you die, your spouse has the choice of continuing with 
his or her own Social Security benefit or choosing to take the benefits of the 
deceased spouse. Obviously, if your spouse outlives you by many years or 
even decades, this can really add up.
Control Your Emotions
Finding reasons to make an emotional decision is easy, especially when it 
comes to money. Given that over 30 million retirees are currently receiv-
ing Social Security payments, there are plenty of stories out there to latch 
onto. If you’re facing a Social Security payout decision in the next five to ten 
years and already thinking of one of the following reasons for taking an early 
payout, investigate further:
 
 You don’t think you’re likely to live past the break-even age or aver-
age life expectancy. According to government data, about one out of 
four 65-year-olds alive today will make it past age 90. One out of ten will 
celebrate a 95th birthday. Consider the role your Social Security check 
may play in your future.
 
 The break-even age is the point at which the higher benefits from wait-
ing until age 70 becomes more than the money you received by starting 
early. For example, suppose you’d get $11,000 per year at age 62, but 
you’d get $20,000 per year by waiting until age 70. That means that you 
received $88,000 by the time you were 70, and the break-even is age 79 
($88,000 divided by the difference between $11,000 and $20,000 is about 
9). If you live beyond age 79, all things being equal, you would be better 
off waiting until age 70 to begin your benefits. 
 
 You don’t trust the government to continue paying benefits — maybe 
you’ll buy an annuity instead. If the government runs into trouble, how 
do you think company- or insurance industry–guaranteed income prom-
ises will fare, keeping in mind that they’d be holding a lot of government 
bonds in their portfolios?

312
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
 
 Future benefits may be linked to your total income, so take this into 
consideration if you anticipate having a high lifetime income. If a couple 
thousand dollars per month is a big part of your upcoming retirement 
income plans, then you’ll probably fly under the income limits.
 
 You’ll take the payout early and invest it to get a better return. Nifty 
idea, but not thrifty. If you can afford to take the investment risk that’d 
be necessary to beat the rate of return you get by waiting, you probably 
don’t need to take Social Security early and wouldn’t want to for tax 
reasons. If your full retirement age is 67 (that is, if you were born after 
1960), your monthly benefits are reduced by about 30 percent. If you 
were born between 1943 and 1959, you get an additional bonus of 8 per-
cent per year by delaying your start date past your full retirement age. 
There isn’t a low- to no-risk investment strategy around that can deliver 
those rates of return.
 
 You don’t want to take withdrawals from your IRAs too soon — they 
need to grow. Yes, taking Social Security early may allow your IRA to 
grow for a few years longer. But after that, the smaller government 
check will probably require even larger IRA withdrawals.
 
 Ouch! You already started taking benefits early and wish you’d 
waited. Isn’t it too late? Go to your Social Security office or www.ssa.
gov and use Form 521, Request for Withdrawal of Application, to turn 
the clock back. You can actually halt your current benefits and, after 
paying back all you’ve received interest-free, have them restarted at a 
higher rate, reflecting your current age.
 
All the preceding scenarios are well and good, but for many, many people, the 
argument for cashing in on Social Security early is much simpler and much 
more emotional: They really need the money now. And that’s a great reason. 
However, consider one point: You’ll probably really, really need the larger 
amount later, so try to postpone benefits as long as possible. Each month 
you delay between the ages of 62 and 70, the amount you receive for the rest 
of your life goes up. Future inflation can add to your regret over a premature 
starting point. Consider that in 1979, 1980, and 1981, annual cost of living 
increases were 9.9 percent, 14.3 percent, and 11.2 percent, respectively.

Get the Most Out of Your Pension
By Liane Warcup, CFP
M
ost people who are nearing retirement and have an employer pen-
sion are looking forward to a monthly paycheck. Unfortunately, many 
of those people are fuzzy on the details. More than 44 million workers from 
a variety of industries (including teachers, state and federal employees, 
construction and manufacturing workers, financial services employees, and 
many more) can expect pension income during retirement. Each person’s 
benefits will be different depending on
 
 The employer’s formula for determining benefits
 
 Whether cost of living adjustments are included
 
 Which distribution option is selected
 
 When benefits begin for the retiree
During times of economic uncertainty, understanding and protecting your 
pension income are doubly important, because during hard times, many 
companies lay off workers or force workers into early retirement. If you’re 
prematurely forced out of your job along with many others, replacement jobs 
can be scarce. You may have to take your pension earlier than you want to or 
earlier than is optimal.
Take a Look at Your Pension
Answer yes or no to the following questions to see how much you know 
about your personal pension:
 
 I have a recent pension benefit statement and I understand what it says.
 
 I know whether my pension includes cost of living adjustments.
 
 I know what distribution (payment) options are available.
 
 I know how soon/late I can begin drawing my pension.
 
 I know whether my pension provides a disability payment.
 
 I know my pension’s survivor benefits.

314
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
If you answered no to any of these questions, don’t just sit there — talk to 
your employer to find out what your pension will do for you.
Meanwhile, read on for the basics to understand why knowing your options 
is so important, especially in difficult times.
Determine Your Benefits
Somewhere in all those documents you glanced at and then filed (or possibly 
threw away) when you were hired, you can find a formula for calculating your 
estimated pension benefit. If you can’t find this paperwork (called a summary 
plan description), request a copy from your human resources department for 
your records. One of the most common benefit formulas is based on the total 
number of years of service multiplied by a percentage of an average of your 
final years of earnings. Usually, the longer you work at the same company, 
the larger your current income and the larger your pension income during 
retirement.
Before you get too excited about this pension income, keep in mind that 
employers usually design pension benefits to replace about 40 to 60 percent 
of income, anticipating that Social Security benefits and private savings will 
cover the difference.
 
Ask for a pension benefit statement from your employer if you haven’t 
received one in the last year. This statement should be provided annually and 
should summarize your pension benefit.
Consider Cost of Living 
Adjustments (COLA)
Receiving a regular income for the rest of your life sounds like a good deal. 
But does the dollar amount increase each year to compensate for inflation? If 
it does, stand up and cheer. You have a pension that should keep up with the 
rising costs of goods and services. Table 73-1 shows the increasing value of a 
pension with a cost of living adjustment (COLA). As you can see, a little COLA 
in your pension makes a big difference over time.

If you don’t already know, find out whether your pension includes cost of 
living adjustments. This has grave implications on how much money you 
need to save outside of pension plans for your future retirement. If your 
expenses already outweigh the combined expected income from your pension 
and Social Security, and if your pension doesn’t have a COLA, the disparity 
between income and expenses is going to grow rapidly over time. You’ll have 
to make up for that disparity with your savings and other assets.
Know Your Distribution Options (How 
Much Money and for How Long?)
When you’re ready to retire, you may have several pension payment options 
to consider. Here are the most common:
 
 Single life annuity: You receive monthly income payments for your 
life only. So if you’re married and you die shortly after you retire, your 
dearly beloved gets to deal with the loss of you and your pension unless 
you have a hefty life insurance policy to make up the difference. This is 
the largest payment option available. With some pension plans, this is 
the only option available.
 
 Single life period certain: Payments continue at least for your lifespan 
or a set number of years (usually 10 or 20 years), whichever is longer. 
The amount of this payment is less than for the single life annuity 
because of the guaranteed payment stream for a set number of years.
 
 Joint and survivor annuity: You receive reduced monthly income pay-
ments for life. When you die, your spouse receives a survivor benefit for 
life (usually 50, 75, or 100 percent of your payment).
 
 Lump sum payout: Your employer converts your monthly retirement 
benefit into a single lump sum payment. If this is an option, you may 
even get to choose between a full lump sum payment and a partial lump 
sum combined with a reduced annuity option. Here are some additional 
issues to ponder:

316
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
 
• You should roll this lump sum into an IRA to defer taxes. If you 
don’t roll your lump sum into an IRA, you pay taxes on the entire 
amount paid out to you. And if you’re younger than 591/2 and you 
don’t roll the funds into an IRA, you’ll likely pay a 10-percent pen-
alty in addition to regular income taxes on the lump sum amount. 
(Exceptions include retiring at age 55 or later, disability, certain 
medical expenses, and more — consult IRS publication 575, an 
accountant, or a financial planner for details.)
 
• If you choose the lump sum, make sure your retiree health insur-
ance coverage (if any) won’t change.
 
• Your lump sum rollover to an IRA must be invested just like all 
your other financial assets.
 
• You can purchase your own low-cost annuity with all or part of 
this money, but make sure that any annuity you pick is at least as 
good as the pension annuity you’ve turned down, especially if your 
pension has a COLA. However, it’s highly unlikely that a commer-
cial annuity can compete with your company pension regarding 
the size of monthly payments and the Pension Benefit Guarantee 
Corporation (PBGC) guarantee that’s available for qualified pen-
sion plans.
 
• Don’t even be tempted to go on a crazy spending spree and 
deplete your nest egg.
So which distribution option should you take? This decision requires you to 
evaluate your entire retirement income picture. At least consider the following:
 
 How much Social Security income you’ll receive
 
 When to begin your Social Security payments
 
 How much, if any, your pension will offset some of your Social Security 
benefit
 
 How much you’ve accumulated in your personal savings and investment 
accounts
 
 Your estimate of your retirement living expenses
 
 If you die, how dependent your spouse will be on your pension
 
Your choice of payment options is permanent (no pressure!). If these choices 
make your head spin, consult with a financial planner or two for some pension 
planning advice. See Strategies #54 and #55 for more information on accumu-
lating money for retirement and making sure it lasts a lifetime (or two).

 #73: Get the Most Out of Your Pension
Get Your Money at the Right Time
Although many pensions are designed to begin paying at age 65, some plans 
give you a range of choices. Pension benefits may be available as early as age 
55 or any time after you retire. Early pension payments will be smaller than 
if you wait until your normal retirement age (much like early Social Security 
benefits are reduced). Sometimes you may have great reasons to take advan-
tage of an early payout; examples include locking in healthcare benefits or 
ensuring a larger survivor benefit.
Some pensions allow you to delay taking payment until long after your retire-
ment. You may find this hard to believe, but some people actually decide 
to delay their pension payments. People who delay are usually still in the 
workforce and have earnings pushing them into a higher tax bracket than 
their future retirement tax bracket. They may wait until they’re fully retired 
because they don’t need the pension income while they’re still working, and 
they don’t want to pay the higher taxes. Plus, the monthly pension benefit 
increases with age.
 
Find out when your pension is available to you. Check with your employer or read 
the summary plan document to see when you can start your pension payments.
Other pieces of the pension puzzle
The following issues may crop up depending on 
your situation:
  Incapacitation: Find out what the rules are 
if you become disabled before retirement. 
Some pensions, including Social Security, 
provide a benefit usually up until age 65, 
when the regular pension benefit begins.
  Survivorship: What happens to your pen-
sion if you die just before you retire? Will 
your spouse have a pension benefit? How 
much? If your personal retirement plan is 
dependent on your pension income, the 
survivorship question is crucial! If your plan 
doesn’t have decent pre-retirement survi-
vor benefits, you may need to increase your 
life insurance to cover this risk.

Understand Your Employer 
Retirement Plan
By Brooke Salvini, CPA/PFS, CCPS
D
id you save money in a favorite piggy bank when you were a child? Do 
you remember the exciting day you finally got to shake out the bank, 
count your savings, and decide how to spend your money? As a new retiree, 
you’re turning your bank upside down. You still need to be diligent about 
rebalancing , making smart investment choices, and managing expenses. But 
you also need to know the ins and outs of shaking loose your retirement sav-
ings so you pay minimum taxes and no penalties. This strategy explains how.
Read Up and Talk about It
First, get a copy of your plan summary document, either from your human 
resources department or benefits coordinator or from a download on your 
company Web site.
The next step is to schedule an appointment with your human resources 
department. Ask to have your withdrawal choices fully explained, including 
possible consequences — that is, taxes and penalties — based on your cur-
rent age and employment status (retirement isn’t necessarily the same as 
not working, especially if you’re a baby boomer breaking all past retirement 
notions).
 
Your company’s plan may or may not mirror the current tax laws regarding 
employer retirement plans.
This is also the right time to meet with your financial advisor. Your advisor 
can help you sort through the various withdrawal options for your retirement 
savings based your personal goals and needs.

Answer These Questions before 
You Break the Bank
Especially in uncertain economic environments, you should answer these 
questions before tapping into your retirement savings:
 
 What’s your current age?
 
 What are your hopes and dreams for retirement?
 
 What are your other sources of retirement income?
 
 How long do you need your savings to last?
 
 How much do you need to live comfortably every month?
 
 Do you have an immediate need for a lump sum of money?
Don’t expect to answer these questions in five minutes. Everyone 
has a unique vision of the perfect retirement. A variety of online cal-
culators and resources, such as 360 Degrees of Financial Literacy 
(www.360financialliteracy.org), can help you answer these questions.
Important ages to keep in mind when planning withdrawals include the 
following:
 
 Age 50: Age 50 is the same as age 55 for some types of public safety 
employees. (If you work in a public service capacity, check with your 
plan administrator or tax preparer to see whether you qualify).
 
 Age 55: If you leave your job between 55 and 591/2, you don’t pay a 10 
percent early withdrawal penalty on 401(k)s and other qualified retire-
ment savings (not including IRAs).
 
 Age 591/2: The 10 percent early withdrawal penalty expires. (Note: But to 
withdraw savings from a 457(b), you have to retire or turn 701/2).
 
 Age 62: This is the earliest age you can obtain Social Security benefits.
 
 Age 701/2 + April 1: Here, you begin required minimum distributions 
(RMDs) from employer plans and IRAs (except Roth IRAs). If you’re still 
working and own less than 5 percent of the company, you can delay 
RMDs from your current employer’s qualified plans. (Note: Not all plans 
allow you to delay RMDs.)
 
Even though you avoid the 10 percent penalty with proper planning, income 
taxes will always be payable on retirement savings withdrawals except for 
Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s.

320
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
Know Your Options when Leaving a Job
Most near retirees are bombarded with a laundry list of important decisions 
regarding the future. This can be overwhelming, but don’t let that stop you 
from making smart choices about the savings you’ve accumulated in the 
company retirement plan. The next sections cover the three options to con-
sider for your savings when leaving employment.
Leave your money in your employer 
retirement savings plan
If the plan allows and you’re very satisfied with the available investment 
choices and performance, leave your money right where it is. You can always 
roll your money to an IRA later.
This is also a good choice if you need maximum protection from creditors 
because of potential lawsuits, bankruptcy, or other situations. Asset protec-
tion for qualified retirement plans is more comprehensive than for IRAs. 
Borrowing from an IRA isn’t permitted, so if this is an important option for 
you, leave your money in your existing plan (or roll your savings into a new 
employer’s plan).
Also take retirement age into account. At age 55, withdrawals from qualified 
plans aren’t subject to the 10 percent early withdrawal penalty if you’re no 
longer employed by the company. With an IRA, you have to wait until age 
591/2 to avoid this penalty.
Take a lump sum (or partial) distribution
 
A lump sum distribution is almost always a bad idea. Because income taxes 
are due on all distributions (lump sum or partial), a large lump sum distribu-
tion will likely force you into a higher tax bracket. This should be your choice 
of last resort. However, if this is your only way to pay a major expense, you 
can take a portion of your savings as a lump sum distribution and roll the bal-
ance of your savings into an IRA.
If you own highly appreciated company stock in your retirement plan, you 
can benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates on the net unrealized appre-
ciation (NUA) on the stock. You pay ordinary income tax at the time of with-
drawal on the cost of the stock, but when you sell the stock, the NUA is taxed 
at the more favorable long-term capital gains rate. NUA is a complex tax issue 
that you should discuss with an accountant or other professional.

321
 #74: Understand Your Employer Retirement Plan
Roll your money into an IRA
Most of the time, rolling your retirement plan savings into an IRA is best. IRAs 
have greater flexibility both with investment choices and withdrawal options. 
(See Strategy #75 for info on IRA withdrawal options).
 
The most important thing to remember about a rollover is to request a direct 
trustee-to-trustee transfer. A direct trustee-to-trustee rollover saves you from 
unexpected and potentially nasty tax consequences. If you receive the check 
made out to your new IRA trustee (this happens fairly often), don’t worry; this 
is still a direct rollover — just forward the check on to your new trustee.
Cha-ching! Shaking the Bank
You’ve decided where to stash your retirement savings, but how much and 
when should you withdraw? In an uncertain economy, that’s the million-dollar 
question. The longer you can allow your retirement plan savings to grow 
tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roth contributions), the better.
Many new retirees mistakenly overspend in the early years. Don’t deprive 
yourself, but remember that your retirement could be 30 to 40 years. The 
cost of the health care you’ll probably need in later retirement continues to 
increase faster than most other expenses.
 
Determining the correct withdrawal rate for your situation requires many con-
siderations, but a general rule is to withdraw no more than 4 percent of your 
total savings in any one year. If your investment returns are poor in a particu-
lar year, you should revise this percentage downward. And conversely, you 
can revise your withdrawal upward if you make great returns one year.
Timing your withdrawals from one tax year to the next provides another 
opportunity to reduce income taxes. For example, if you have unusually 
high medical expenses in a particular calendar year that qualify as itemized 
deductions, you may want to take some of your retirement withdrawls in 
December instead of waiting until January as a way of balancing your income 
and expenses.
The benefits of tax deferral don’t last forever. On April 1 of the year after 
you turn 701/2, you have to begin required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 
employer retirement plans and IRAs. However, if you’re working at age 701/2 
and you’re not more than a 5 percent owner of the company, you can post-
pone RMDs in that employer’s qualified retirement plan until you retire a 
second time, but you have to take RMDs from all other retirement accounts.

Take Stock of Your Individual 
Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
By Rick DeChaineau, CSA, CRPC, CFP
A
fter all those years of biting the bullet to put money in your individual 
retirement account (IRA), it’s finally time to begin taking money out. 
But that’s not as easy as withdrawing the amount you want when you want it. 
This strategy tells you how IRA withdrawals are taxed (or not) and gives you 
advice on how to best manage your IRA accounts.
Know the Taxes on Withdrawals
Knowing the basics of how IRA withdrawals are taxed can save you money as 
you deal with uncertainties during your retirement.
Traditional IRA withdrawals
You can take withdrawals from a traditional IRA without penalty after you 
reach age 591/2. You can also take withdrawals before then without penalty 
under special circumstances. You’re required to take withdrawals by April 1 
of the year following the year you reach age 701/2. To avoid taking two distri-
butions in one year, take the first distribution in the year you reach 701/2 and 
your second distribution the following year.
Your IRA will hold one of the following:
 
 Only pre-tax contributions: If you didn’t pay income tax on your contri-
bution in the year you made it, you made it pre-tax.
 
 Only after-tax contributions: If you did pay income tax on the contribu-
tion in the year you made it, you made it after-tax.
 
 Both pre-tax and after-tax contributions: If you have an IRA to which 
you made both pre-tax and after-tax contributions, you have to track 
both separately so you know how much of the growth is attributed to 
each portion.

323
  #75: Take Stock of Your Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
If your traditional IRA contains only pre-tax contributions, you pay ordinary 
income-tax rates on the entire amount you take out at the time of withdrawal. 
This includes both the contribution amount and the tax-deferred growth.
If some or all of your IRA includes after-tax contributions, your withdrawals 
from the after-tax portion of your IRA (or a separate after-tax IRA) will be a 
proportionate mix of taxable and tax-free money. Here’s an example: Suppose 
you have a traditional IRA with $10,000 of post-tax contributions (your basis). 
During 2007, you withdrew $10,000. On December 31, 2007, your balance was 
$90,000.
On IRS Form 8606 (where you report after-tax contributions and calculate 
how much of your distributions/conversions are taxable) you’re asked to 
total your year-end balance and any distributions or Roth IRA conversions 
for the year. For 2007, your total was $100,000 ($90,000 balance plus the 
$10,000 distribution).
Because your $10,000 of pre-tax money (cost basis) in the IRA is 10 percent 
of the year-end total (of $100,000), 10 percent of your distribution will be tax-
free ($10,000 × 0.1 = $1,000) and the other $9,000 will be taxable. Your pre-tax 
contributions (cost basis) in the IRA are reduced by the $1,000 tax-free distri-
bution and now total $9,000.
 
The IRS doesn’t care whether you have one or a dozen IRA accounts. It looks 
at all your IRA money (traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE) as one big IRA for pur-
poses of determining the proportion that’s tax-free.
Roth IRA withdrawals
Roth IRAs have three big advantages over traditional IRAs. They have no 
mandatory age at which you must start taking withdrawals, so if you don’t 
need the income, you may never take a withdrawal during your lifetime. The 
second advantage is that qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. 
Third, you don’t have to withdraw a required minimum amount at age 701/2.
Two sets of criteria determine whether a withdrawal from your Roth IRA is a 
qualified withdrawal. First, the distribution must be one of the following:
 
 Made on or after the date you turn 591/2
 
 Made to your beneficiary after you die
 
 Made to you after you become disabled within the IRS definition
 
 Used to pay for qualified first-time homebuyer expenses

324
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
Second, the five-tax-year rule must be met. This means that you have to wait 
five years from the year in which you made your first contribution before you 
can withdraw the earnings on your contributions without penalty.
You can withdraw the amount of your contributions from a Roth IRA at any 
time.
Match Account Contents 
with Tax Treatment
During retirement, your IRA and Roth IRA will likely hold only a portion of 
your retirement assets. Your first step in managing your taxable income is to 
ensure the right assets are in the right accounts. This assumes you already 
have various types of other taxable investment accounts. Do not pull money 
out of an IRA just to create the other account types.
 
Because your traditional IRA withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income, 
you’ll want to hold ordinary-income assets, such as bonds, CDs, and so on, in 
your IRA.
Your personal (taxable) accounts should hold investments that are eligible 
to be taxed at the (currently) lower long-term capital gain and qualified divi-
dend rates. Examples of these investments include stocks and equity mutual 
funds. Tax-free assets, such as tax-free municipal bonds, also belong in your 
personal account.
If you intend for your children to someday inherit your Roth, you can invest 
more aggressively in your Roth account.
Balance Your Account Actions 
for Minimal Tax Impact
If you want to pay the least amount of income tax in retirement (doesn’t 
everyone?), you may want to balance taxable income from your personal 
account with income from tax-exempt assets. If you need more income than 
you’re receiving from your employer retirement plan and your IRA withdraw-
als, you may want to balance that taxable income with withdrawals from your 
Roth IRA. You don’t want to prematurely take out money that can otherwise 
continue to grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Finding the right balance takes 
some planning.

325
  #75: Take Stock of Your Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
The following steps help you figure out how to best integrate IRA and Roth 
IRA withdrawals with the rest of your income:
 
1. Figure out how much income you’ll need each year.
 
 See Strategy #55 for details.
 
2. Identify how much income you’ll receive from various non-IRA 
sources, such as your
 
• Pension
 
• 401(k), SIMPLE, SEP
 
• Deferred compensation plan
 
• Annuity
 
• Rental property
 
• Personal (non-qualified) investments
 
• Other
 
 Do you have a shortfall? If so, how much will you need to withdraw from 
your IRA/Roth IRA each year? When you’re 701/2 and older, you’ll be 
required to take a minimum amount of distribution from your qualified 
retirement plan assets and your traditional IRA. These distributions will 
be counted as part of your taxable income.
 
3. Tally how much of that income is taxable and what your tax 
bracket is.
 
4. Determine the mix of traditional IRA (taxable) and Roth IRA (tax-free) 
income to withdraw, keeping in mind the amount of your required 
minimum distribution, if applicable.
 
 If you don’t need to tap your traditional IRA for current income, look 
at what effect the required minimum distributions (RMDs) will have on 
your taxes when you turn 701/2. If you have a large IRA balance, taking 
withdrawals before 701/2, or converting amounts to a Roth IRA to reduce 
your RMDs later, may make sense.
Whatever your current situation, review these estimates annually because 
tax laws and your investment balances change.

326
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
To Convert or Not to Convert? 
That Is the Question
As of the writing of this book, you’re allowed to convert money from the 
following accounts into a Roth IRA if your modified adjusted gross income 
(MAGI) isn’t more than $100,000:
 
 IRA
 
 Qualified pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan (including a 401(k) 
plan)
 
 Tax-sheltered annuity (403(b) plan)
 
 Deferred compensation plan of a state or local government (section 
457(b) plan)
 
 Pension
Beginning in 2010, this income limit is lifted, and you’ll be able to convert 
money from your IRA to a Roth no matter how much you make. You’ll even 
be able to spread the taxes on the conversion between 2011 and 2012!
But wait! Converting traditional IRA money to a Roth means you’ll pay tax on 
the converted amount now to get tax-free withdrawals later. Is this a good 
idea? As you know from figuring out how to balance your traditional IRA and 
Roth withdrawals, your tax brackets — now and when you’re taking required 
minimum distributions (RMDs) — will drive this decision.
If, when you start taking RMDs, you estimate you’ll be in the same tax bracket 
or lower than you’re in now, don’t convert. However, experts feel that tax 
rates are unlikely to go lower and very likely will go up in the future, which 
makes converting to a Roth IRA more attractive.
 
If you’re able to reduce your future tax bracket by withdrawing or converting 
to a Roth now — without pushing yourself into a higher bracket by doing so — 
do it!
With money in a Roth IRA, you’ll have the tools to manage your IRAs to mini-
mize your tax bill. This is a big benefit in uncertain times.

Use Your Taxable, Partially 
Taxable, and Non-Taxable 
Investments Wisely
By Jeff Alderfer, CFP, AIF
A
fter you spend a lifetime accumulating a tidy nest egg, you get to figure 
out how to spend it. It’s not as simple as just buying all you need and 
some of what you want. You need to pay attention to which investments you 
spend now, which you spend later, and which you’re going to leave to your 
children. What’s more, uncertain times can affect taxes as well as investing, 
so you need a plan that considers both. Without one, you’re probably going 
to give more money to Uncle Sam than you need to. So in this strategy, you 
discover how to spend the money you’ve invested while minimizing the taxes 
you have to pay.
Separate Your Money into Tax Buckets
Sometimes it’s easier to explain finances by using a bucket brigade rather 
than a spreadsheet. If you’re like most people, your investment buckets are 
scattered about: an IRA here, a couple of old 401(k)s there, a taxable broker-
age account, a money market account, and maybe an annuity. And here’s 
where the bucket concept makes things easier: Don’t think about all the dif-
ferent accounts you have — just think about which tax bucket your money is 
in. Following are the only three tax buckets:
 
 Bucket #1, the tax-free bucket: This bucket contains all the accounts 
that will never be taxed. Specifically, this bucket includes Roth IRAs and 
Roth 401(k)s. No matter how much money you take out of this bucket in 
retirement, you won’t have to pay income taxes on it.
 
 Because this bucket contains only tax-free money, you can take out as 
much or as little as you want in retirement, with no tax liability.

328
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
 
 Bucket #2, the tax-deferred bucket: The taxes have been deferred for 
the accounts in this bucket. Some specific accounts include traditional 
IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, tax-deferred annuities (variable and fixed), 457(b) 
plans, and some other more exotic retirement accounts. See Strategies 
#33, #34, and #35 for more information about retirement accounts.
 
 In general, any money you withdraw from your traditional IRA, 401(k), 
403(b), or annuity is taxed as ordinary income, so you’re taxed in what-
ever federal tax bracket you’re part of (as determined by your family 
income). If you’ve made non-deductible contributions to your traditional 
IRAs or 401(k)s, these contributions will be taxed only on the growth, 
because you’ve already paid taxes on the contributions. If you have any 
of these hybrids, be sure you carefully document the contributions. But 
in general, plan on paying income taxes on any withdrawals from any 
account in the tax-deferred bucket.
 
 Bucket #3, the taxable bucket: This bucket contains accounts that 
receive no special tax treatment, and it includes brokerage accounts, 
money market accounts, and savings accounts. Here you pay taxes as 
you go, on a yearly basis.
 
 The rules for taxation are the same as they were during your working 
years — that is, long-term capital gains and dividends are currently 
taxed at the more favorable rate of 15 percent. (See Strategy #32 for a 
more thorough explanation of taxable investments.)
 
Consolidating all the accounts within each bucket makes your life consider-
ably easier. For example, you can roll all your 401(k)s and traditional IRAs 
(inside Bucket #2) into a single, monster, traditional IRA. Not only does this 
strategy make it easier to track your investments, but it also reduces the bliz-
zard of paperwork you receive for each of the smaller, individual accounts. 
Taking this step doesn’t change your tax liability, but it does make your life 
simpler!
Spend the Money in Your Buckets
After you figure out which tax bucket holds each of your investments, it’s 
time for the fun part: How should you spend your money? Here’s a good gen-
eral guideline:
 
 Bucket #1, the tax-free bucket: Use the money in this bucket last. It’ll 
never be taxed, and if you never get around to spending it, your heirs 
can spend it tax-free as well.

329
 #76: Use Your Taxable, Partially Taxable, and Non-Taxable Investments Wisely
 
 Bucket #2, the tax-deferred bucket: Okay, pay attention here. Years 
ago, financial advisors used to recommend that you leave your tax-
deferred accounts untouched as long as possible to let them compound 
free of taxes. However, given the very real prospect of higher tax rates 
in the future, drawing down these funds sooner rather than later may 
be beneficial — even though this advice goes against the conventional 
wisdom of deferring taxes as long as possible (the mantra of all Certified 
Public Accountants). Drawing money from this bucket gives you the 
added benefit of reducing the amount of your nest egg that will be sub-
ject to required minimum distributions (RMDs) when you turn 701/2.
 
 Bucket #3, the taxable bucket: Although tax rates are likely to climb in 
the future, capital gains taxes (those taxes that are due when you sell an 
investment) are likely to remain lower than ordinary income taxes. And 
these assets receive a “stepped up” basis when you die, so if you never 
get around to them, your heirs can likely enjoy more favorable taxation 
as well.
 
To hedge your bets (or “diversify your risk” in financial planner–speak) in 
uncertain times, plan to initially take money out of Bucket #2 and Bucket #3 
each year of your retirement. One clever way to apply this strategy is to draw 
from your tax-deferred (Bucket #2) accounts first, until reaching the upper 
limit of your current federal tax bracket (remember to include any taxable 
Social Security payments), and then draw the remainder of your spending 
from your taxable accounts in Bucket #3 (taxed at the more favorable long-
term capital gains rate). This way, you’re maxing out the lower tax bracket 
with Bucket #2 and then using Bucket #3 to round out your spending needs.
Here’s a brief example:
Total funds available in retirement:
Tax Bucket #1: $100,000 in a Roth IRA
Tax Bucket #2: $100,000 in a traditional IRA
Tax Bucket #3: $100,000 in a brokerage account
Total funds needed: $12,000 per year
Assume your pension/Social Security income puts you just $7,000 below the 
top of the 15-percent federal tax bracket. Using this strategy, you withdraw 
$7,000 from your traditional IRA, which fills up that 15-percent tax bracket. 
Then, to provide the rest of the money you need, you sell $5,000 worth of 
your brokerage account assets — on which you owe just 15 percent of the 
capital gains. If you were to instead withdraw the entire $12,000 from your 
traditional IRA, that extra $5,000 would be taxed at the rate of 25 percent.

Let Your Kids Spend the Money: 
Estate Planning Issues
Although some people hope to pass on just as they feed their very last dollar 
into the vending machine, they’ll probably have at least some money left 
over when they go. Current estate laws treat each tax bucket differently. 
Here’s a snapshot:
 
 The tax-free bucket: One of the best reasons to leave money in Bucket 
#1 for as long as possible is this: When you pass, your heirs won’t have 
to pay any income taxes on any of the money from this bucket. They’ll 
have to withdraw the inherited funds over their remaining lifetime(s), 
but the money will be tax-free!
 
 The tax-deferred bucket: If your heirs inherit any money from Bucket 
#2, they’ll have to pay ordinary income taxes on any money they with-
draw. The rate they pay depends on their individual tax brackets when 
they withdraw the funds. So if you have two kids and two IRAs (one tra-
ditional, one Roth), consider how you can fairly divide them up.
 
 The taxable bucket: Taxable investments have an extra bonus. When 
you die, the value of these assets will be “stepped up” to the value at 
your date of death. Then, when your heirs eventually sell the assets, 
they’ll be taxed only on the increase in value since your death. As an 
added bonus, they’ll be taxed at the more favorable long-term capital 
gains rate, currently 15 percent. Thus, if you have any highly appreci-
ated assets, you may want to hold on to them, if possible, and let the 
kids inherit them.

Allocate Assets in the Active 
Stage of Retirement
By Kay Conheady, CFP
W
ith good health, you’ll be active and living independently for the 
majority of your retirement. You may plan to travel, spend time with 
family and friends, pursue your favorite hobbies, volunteer, or even start 
your own business. To fund those dreams, you now need to structure your 
nest egg to provide regular income that meets the following criteria:
 
 It adequately supplements pension and/or Social Security income to 
fund your desired standard of living.
 
 It’ll be there in both good and uncertain economic time periods through-
out your retirement.
 
 It lasts as long as you need it to.
This strategy explains how to get your portfolio management off to a good 
start as you begin tapping into your nest egg.
Understand Retirement Uncertainty
Knowing which uncertainties will impact the success of your retirement can 
help you better plan and manage your assets and your income. Here are sev-
eral risks you need to consider:
 
 Longevity risk: The risk that you’ll run out of dollars before you run out 
of breaths
 
 Inflation risk: The risk that the cost of everything will go up faster than 
your income

332
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
 
 Market risk: The risk that you’ll have to sell investments when they’re 
down in value in order to produce needed income
 
 Timing risk: The risk that you’ll experience large investment losses in 
the first three to five years of retirement
Your best defense is to hold off on retiring until you have a comprehensive 
plan to protect against these four risks. Asset allocation is your primary tool 
to manage them. Monitoring your plan and making periodic adjustments is 
also part of the process.
Decide Whether to Use Annuities
Allocating some of your nest egg to an immediate annuity creates a stream of 
income you can’t outlive. Such a strategy can help overcome longevity risk. 
(For info on fixed and variable annuities, see Strategies #19 and #22.) If you’re 
married, buy a joint and survivor benefit so the surviving spouse will con-
tinue to receive income.
 
Before putting your all or a portion of you nest egg into an annuity, even one 
that’ll keep pace with inflation and fully fund your desired standard of living, 
understand that with an annuity, you give your money to an insurance com-
pany in exchange for the promise of a lifetime income. Once initiated, or annui-
tized, annuity income can’t be stopped or changed, even if you no longer need 
that income or need additional money for unexpected expenses. Be sure to 
read the annuity policy and ask questions about how the policy works.
Deciding how much of your nest egg to allocate to an annuity is a real chal-
lenge. You have to assess the following to make a wise decision:
 
 The probability that you’ll burn through your assets prematurely
 
 Your tolerance for investment risk
 
 The long-term trend of the stock market
 
If the probability of exhausting your assets prematurely is high, your tolerance 
for investment risk is low, or the stock market appears to be peaking or in the 
early stages of a downswing, consider allocating 60 to 80 percent of your nest 
egg to an immediate annuity.

333
 #77: Allocate Assets in the Active Stage of Retirement
Allocate Your Nest Egg to 
Stocks, Bonds, and Cash
Longevity and inflation risk mandate that you allocate at least some of your 
nest egg to risky assets — stocks and bonds. These assets can help you stay 
ahead of inflation, although their returns aren’t guaranteed. At the same time, 
investing in stocks and bonds can increase the uncertainties that may cause 
your accounts to decrease in value. This section explains how to find — and 
keep — the right balance.
Decide on your target balance
 
The first asset allocation decision you have to make is how much to invest in 
stocks versus bonds and/or cash. As an early stage retiree, a reasonable cash-
bond-stock allocation is to keep
 
 Three years’ worth of annual income in cash
 
 Three to five years’ worth in bonds
 
 The rest in stocks
Using this strategy provides you with income for seven years. You get the 
opportunity to sell stocks when they’re up in order to replace cash and bond 
assets that are used up by income withdrawals. Meanwhile, the bonds and 
cash investments help protect you against the large losses the stock market 
occasionally delivers. Bonds often provide positive returns when stocks are 
performing negatively, which helps reduce the negative impact on your total 
investment portfolio.
 
In early retirement, an allocation of 45 to 60 percent of your portfolio in stocks 
is reasonable. Allocating more than 60 percent to stocks in the early stages of 
retirement increases the risk of experiencing large losses, and allocating less 
than 45 percent increases the risk of depleting your portfolio due to feeble 
growth.
Diversify your investments
After you choose your overall allocation, you have to actually choose your 
investments. Here are few bond suggestions:

334
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
 
 Diversify and buy lots of different types of bonds, keeping your invest-
ment in high-yield bonds relatively low.
 
 The majority of your bonds should be intermediate maturity — between 
five and ten years. Avoid owning too many bonds or bond funds with 
maturity dates longer than ten years because these tend to fluctuate in 
value more dramatically than intermediate- and short-term bonds.
 
 Consider putting 15 to 40 percent of your bond allocation in bonds 
designed to provide inflation protection. (See Strategy #18 for more 
information.)
Your stocks should make up 60 percent or less of your total portfolio. As you 
choose stocks, make sure you adequately diversify into the different classes 
of stocks, including the following (see Strategies #42 through #45 for more 
info on diversifying your stock portfolio):
 
 Domestic and foreign
 
 Small and large cap
 
 Growth and value
 
Generally, growth stocks tend to be riskier than value stocks, international 
stocks tend to be riskier than domestic stocks, and small company stocks 
tend to be riskier than large company stocks.
For the cash portion of this portfolio, pursue the highest interest rates avail-
able, short of tying up your money in long-maturity CDs. Check out Strategy 
#17 to help you decide which cash savings vehicles to use during retirement.
Rebalance your investment portfolio
Because you’ll be regularly depleting the cash portion of your investment 
portfolio, you need to periodically adjust the amounts you have in bonds 
and stocks so that the percentage of each in your total portfolio equals your 
target asset allocation.
 
Rebalancing within a taxable account can have potentially expensive tax rami-
fications. For taxable accounts, you may want to seek the help of a financial 
advisor who’s experienced in retirement investing and taxation.
However, rebalancing within a 401(k) or IRA has no immediate tax ramifica-
tions, so the decision to rebalance is much simpler. For early stage retirees 
who’ve allocated three years of nest-egg withdrawals to cash and another 
five years to bonds, the concern is when to replenish the cash reserve. Here 
are three principles to remember for rebalancing:

335
 #77: Allocate Assets in the Active Stage of Retirement
 
 Cash: Replenish your cash stash at least every two years back to the 
three-year amount. To increase your cash, liquidate bond assets when 
stocks have performed poorly or use stock assets if they’ve done well.
 
 Bonds: Replenish your allocation to bonds back up to three to five 
years’ worth of living expenses when the amount falls below two years’ 
worth. If your bond portfolio exceeds five years’ worth of withdrawals, 
divert assets first to cash and then to stocks to reestablish the target 
balance.
 
 Stock: Make sure your stock allocation stays between 45 and 60 percent 
of your total portfolio. It’s better to have more than five to seven years’ 
worth of living expenses in bonds and cash if necessary to keep your 
stock allocation in check.
 
If you find that you can no longer maintain at least 45 percent of your portfolio 
in stocks after restocking your cash and bond reserves, this is a red flag that 
you may be consuming your nest egg too quickly. Do a comprehensive review 
of your retirement income plan to see what adjustments you need to make.
If you experience large losses in the first two to five years of retirement, you 
need to redesign your retirement income plan. You may want to reconsider 
the role of immediate annuities in your plan. Seek help from an experienced 
financial planner if your confidence is shaken.

Allocate Your Assets for the 
Slow-Down Stage of Retirement
By Kay Conheady, CFP
I
f you’ve been taking income from your nest egg for a while, it may no 
longer be growing at a rate that outpaces or even equals inflation. 
Your annual withdrawals have likely steadily grown to meet your inflating 
expenses, which may have doubled since the beginning of your retirement.
Reevaluate and determine whether you need to change the asset allocation of 
your investment portfolio. To intelligently assess your asset allocation, first 
do the following:
 
 Review your health and prospects for longevity (and those of your 
spouse).
 
 Review how well your nest egg has been doing and whether you can 
expect it to last as long as you do.
 
 Re-estimate your future expenses for
 
• Everyday living
 
• Healthcare and the potential need for long-term care
 
• Unmet retirement dreams
 
 Revisit your goals for leaving an inheritance to your heirs.
 
 Assess your ability and desire to continue managing your investments.
After you do this review, you should have all the insights you need to make 
good asset allocation decisions.
Revisit the Four Elements of 
Retirement Uncertainty
Strategy #77 discusses four elements of retirement uncertainty. Three of the 
four are still important for those in the slow-down stage of retirement:

337
 #78: Allocate Your Assets for the Slow-Down Stage of Retirement
 
 Longevity risk: Your updated retirement income plan can tell you 
whether this challenge is still a major consideration for you. Evaluating 
whether you’ll outlive your money is a bit easier at this stage because 
you’re planning for inflation, investment returns, and living expenses for 
fewer years.
 
 Inflation risk: As you revise your retirement income plan, pay special 
attention to inflation trends for the goods and services you need going 
forward — especially healthcare, long-term care, major home mainte-
nance or remodeling, and other large periodic expenses.
 
 Market risk: Your asset allocation strategy for your updated retirement 
income plan will continue to address the risk that you’ll have to sell 
investments when they’re down.
Large investment losses that occur during early retirement are compounded 
over time, so avoiding them is imperative; however, when you’re well into 
retirement, timing risk isn’t a major concern anymore.
Next, look at the key asset allocation decisions you first explored in active 
retirement (refer to Strategy #77 for details).
Rethink Income Annuities
If you decided against the purchase of an immediate annuity during the 
active stage of your retirement, you may want to reconsider your decision 
now. If your updated retirement income plan indicates that you face a high 
probability of living longer than your assets will last, an immediate annuity 
may provide the lifelong income that meets your needs.
Next, decide whether to purchase an annuity with an income stream that 
increases each year to protect against inflation. Because you face fewer years 
of compounding inflation than you did when you first retired, an annually 
increasing income isn’t as essential as it was then. Look at the current rate 
of inflation to see whether it’s been trending up or down over the last sev-
eral years. And look at the rate of inflation for healthcare and long-term care 
services; these costs increase by a higher rate than the cost of normal goods 
and services.
Assess the value of immediate-income annuities in regard to your current 
financial realities and goals. If you can afford to purchase the amount of annu-
ity income you need, including an inflation benefit, you reduce the impact 
of the other three elements of retirement uncertainty. You may place a high 
value on the peace of mind you get from a guaranteed income.

338
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
If you can’t afford to purchase the level of income you need with inflation 
protection, evaluate how close you can come to meeting your current needs 
if you avoid the additional cost of the inflation protection. And if you decide 
against investing in an income annuity, you need to continue to invest wisely. 
See Strategies #19 and #22 for more on annuities.
Examine Your Stock, Bond, and Cash 
Asset Allocations
As you enter the slow-down stage of retirement, determine whether and how 
you should change your investment portfolio to better suit your circum-
stances.
 
When thinking about your asset allocation for the slow-down stage of retire-
ment, keep the following in mind:
 
 Cash and bonds: Your first concern is still to secure the cash flow you 
need over the next eight or so years; set this amount aside in cash and 
bonds.
 
 Stocks: Depending on your age and life expectancy, you may want to go 
from seeking inflation-beating investment returns to achieving inflation-
matching investment returns. This method allows you to reduce your 
allocation to stock investments within your portfolio. Reducing your 
overall stock holdings to 35 to 40 percent of your portfolio is perfectly 
reasonable.
All the principles of rebalancing discussed in Strategy #77 still apply. In fact, 
you should be even more vigilant and disciplined here because you have less 
time to make up for mistakes. Replenish the cash with your profits from the 
stocks as you get them so you’re protected when the markets disappoint.
For the most part, the advice about bonds and bond funds from Strategy #77 
holds. Look for bonds that seek to provide inflation-matching returns (or 
better); your bond allocation should include 50 to 60 percent of these bonds. 
Keep a portion of your stocks in all the major categories, but favor the more-
conservative categories of U.S. (versus foreign), large company (versus small 
company), and value (versus growth) stocks.

Allocate Your Assets During 
the Late Stage of Life
By Kay Conheady, CFP
H
opefully, you’re able to continue living independently during your 
later years. If, however, you need help taking all your medications on 
schedule, getting up and going in the morning, fixing your meals, or maintain-
ing your home, consider long-term care. Whether you receive this care in 
your own home, an assisted living residence, or a skilled nursing home, your 
outflow of cash is likely to increase considerably, and you may be more con-
cerned than ever about outliving your assets.
Now is a good time for a financial review. Your nest egg has probably been 
slowly shrinking as you’ve been withdrawing an ever-increasing income to 
keep up with inflation. You may have reached the point where you’re taking 
withdrawals of income faster than your nest egg is growing. With good plan-
ning and investment management, you’ve been able to survive ups and 
downs in the economy; but if the cost of long-term care is now the most 
pressing uncertainty you face, this strategy can help.
Assess Your Assistance Needs
Before focusing on your investments and whether you need to make changes 
to your allocation strategy, assess your situation:
 
 Determine what your needs for assistance are.
 
 Figure out who’s available and willing to be involved with your care. 
Family? Friends? Acquaintances?
 
 Determine what kinds of care should be provided by professionals.
 
 Investigate available federal and state government programs and what 
kinds of services they provide.
 
 Determine how your living environment does and doesn’t support your 
continuing to live where you are.
 
 Look at what kinds of modifications to your home or what kinds of tech-
nology would help you to remain where you are.

340
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
 
 Look at other living alternatives and compare the cost of staying where 
you are to the cost of living in another environment.
Use this information to determine whether your income sources will con-
tinue to cover your living expenses (and your spouse’s) and whether you can 
cover long-term care expenses with your income. Then figure out how much 
more you need from other resources to meet your needs. Other resources 
may include the following:
 
 Medicare and/or Medicaid, depending on the services you need, your 
health status, and whether you qualify financially for Medicaid
 
 Long-term care insurance benefits if you have such a policy and meet 
the requirements for receiving benefits (see Strategy #7)
 
 Annuities or life insurance that includes benefits to cover long-term care 
if you meet the requirements for receiving benefits
 
 The equity you’ve built up in your home
Tailor Your Asset Allocation 
Strategy to Your Savings
You need to keep at least three years’ worth of upcoming living expenses 
in cash and replenish it at least every two years. Factor in the cost of long-
term care that other resources can’t cover. If you’re still in your home, factor 
in any large expenses for home modifications and/or assistive technology 
devices or systems.
After you calculate how much to allocate to your cash stash, you’ll know how 
much of your nest egg is left over. Explore your asset allocation challenges 
by analyzing the two common scenarios outlined here.
Scenario 1: Your nest egg is modest 
relative to your anticipated needs
If you determine that your nest egg is adequate relative to your anticipated 
future income needs, you can now
 
 Sell your riskier investment holdings
 
 Buy securities such as CDs and bonds (especially inflation-tracking 
bonds) that have relatively stable values

341
  #79: Allocate Your Assets During the Late Stage of Life
 
At later stages of life, the potential reward of investing in risky assets is no 
longer worth the risk. The higher returns you may enjoy from risky invest-
ments won’t significantly extend how long your nest egg lasts, but investment 
losses, large or small, can significantly shorten it.
Scenario 2: Your nest egg is sizable 
relative to your anticipated needs
If you have plenty of available resources, consider yourself fortunate! Then 
consider the following:
 
 You’re free to continue to invest for growth to build your legacy for 
heirs and charitable intentions.
 
 Assets reserved for your remaining needs should be invested conser-
vatively, whereas assets you anticipate passing on to your heirs can be 
invested up to 100 percent in stocks. A good asset allocation may be 20 
to 30 percent stocks, 30 to 40 percent bonds, and 30 to 40 percent cash.
 
 Rebalancing and vigilance are still necessary.
Get Help with Long-Term Care Planning
Working with a financial planning professional who’s knowledgeable about 
planning for and financing long-term care may be helpful. (For more info on 
long-term care, see Strategy #63.)
Look for the following local resources to work with when planning for your 
long-term care needs:
 
 Area agency on aging: Your local area agency on aging can help you 
find nearby programs and services that can meet some of your needs.
 
 Medicaid office: Medicaid offices can help if your resources are dwin-
dling and you suspect you may need to rely on Medicaid to pay for 
services. Work with your local office well ahead of time so you know cur-
rent qualification requirements and can best plan how to meet them.
You can find more information from the U.S. Administration on Aging, 
Department of Health and Human Services, at www.eldercare.gov or

Preserve Assets to Pass 
on to Your Heirs
By John Vyge, CFP
I
f you want to leave assets to your heirs, you have to balance your need 
for current income with preserving your assets. If you play it too safe, 
your portfolio won’t keep pace with inflation. If you take too much risk, wild 
fluctuations in the stock market may shrink your nest egg. After you put your 
assets in the right place, then you can implement wealth preservation strate-
gies to guide your future financial decisions.
Put Your Assets in the Right Place
One way to preserve assets for your heirs is to draw retirement income from 
fixed-income securities. Having a sufficient base of these types of assets, 
which aren’t subject to the fluctuations of the stock market, allows you to 
put other assets in more growth-oriented investments. Here are some fixed-
income options:
 
 Individual bonds: Individual bonds provide regular interest payments, but 
you need to be willing to hold the bonds until they mature. Bond mutual 
funds also pay interest regularly, but they fluctuate in value, so you have 
no guarantee you’ll have a specific amount on a specific date. Consult an 
investment advisor before building a bond portfolio. (Also read Strategy 
#18 on government bonds and Strategy #27 on individual bonds.)
 
 Certificates of deposit (CDs): A CD is one of the safest ways to earn 
interest and avoid loss of principal. However, a CD often pays an interest 
rate that’s less than the inflation rate. (For more information on CDs, see 
Strategy #17.)
 
 Money market accounts: A bank money market account may pay a 
slightly higher rate of interest than some CDs, but it still may not protect 
against inflation. Mutual fund companies offer a variety of money market 
funds, which also pay interest regularly. (For more information on how 
these accounts and funds work, see Strategy #17.)

343
 #80: Preserve Assets to Pass on to Your Heirs
Also consider the value of tax-deferred accounts. Not only do tax-deferred 
retirement accounts save you from current taxes, but they can also protect 
you in the event of bankruptcy.
Draw Down Your Assets Wisely
At some point, you’re probably going to need to spend some of that money 
you’ve saved and invested over the years. The whole point of putting that 
money away was to enjoy it during retirement, right? This section offers 
some tips on how you can spend your money wisely while protecting the bal-
ance for your heirs.
Whose time horizon? Asset allocation
The appropriate mix of equity and fixed-income investments is important. 
The assets you’ll use for retirement income will be targeted for income and 
safety of principal. A smaller percentage will be geared towards growth (you 
may live a long time!).
If you have enough to see you through retirement (including possible emer-
gencies and long-term care), you can allocate the remainder based on your 
heirs’ time horizons. If you’ll be leaving money to young grandchildren with 
years before college, you can invest that money more aggressively. If your 
heirs are adults with financial pressures, put the money in more stable 
investments.
What comes first? Redemption order
Choosing the accounts from which to withdraw money can make a difference 
in what’s left for your heirs. Here are some guidelines:
 
 If you have taxable accounts, balance the preservation-for-heirs goal 
against how much you’ll pay in taxes along the way. Investments in a 
taxable account may receive an increase in cost basis when they pass to 
your heirs. This may enable your heirs to sell these investments and pay 
little or no capital gains tax.
 
 If you have a very large IRA, 401(k), or other tax-deferred account, you 
may want to delay taking income until your required beginning date 
after you reach age 701/2 and then take only the required minimum distri-
bution. If the transfer is structured properly, IRAs can pass to heirs who 
can then take income out over their lifetimes.

344
Part VI: Living on Your Investment Earnings and Drawing Down Your Assets 
 
 Your Roth IRA is a wonderful vehicle for your heirs to receive because it 
provides tax-free growth and withdrawals. But remember, the Roth IRA 
beneficiary has to take withdrawals based on his or her life expectancy, 
so all the money can’t be left to continue to grow.
 
If you have no Roth IRA because you never qualified for one, a law allows 
anyone at any income level to convert traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs in 2010. 
Although you’ll pay tax on the taxable portion of the IRA, you can spread the 
tax liability over 2011 and 2012 under certain conditions. Be sure to calculate 
the tax cost of converting to a Roth IRA before making the move.
Plan Your Estate
When you die, your estate will be decreased by your existing debt, final 
expenses (medical, burial, and so on), attorney’s/probate fees, and maybe 
estate taxes. You can minimize or avoid some of these costs, depending on 
the estate planning strategies and documents you use. You should consult a 
competent estate planning attorney before acting, but knowing some of your 
options can help you start the planning process now.
Estate and gift taxes
Most people won’t end up paying any federal estate tax under the current 
system. But given the uncertainty of estate tax laws after 2010, planning between 
now and then can be challenging. Basic information includes the following:
 
 Unlimited marital deduction: You can give an unlimited amount to 
your spouse, free of estate and gift taxes. However, when the remaining 
spouse dies, the estate may be subject to federal and/or estate taxes, 
depending on the size of the estate at his or her death.
 
 Annual gifting: You can give up to $12,000 per year per person to as 
many people as you like, without triggering any gift tax.
 
 Lifetime exclusion: Up to $2,000,000 of your estate is exempt from 
Federal Estate Tax in 2008. This exemption amount increases to 
$3,500,000 in 2009 and will be unlimited in 2010 for one year only. 
Congress has been working on legislation to provide permanent estate 
and gift tax rules before 2010. According to 2008 laws, up to $1 million in 
gifts during your life are also exempt from Federal Gift Tax.

345
 #80: Preserve Assets to Pass on to Your Heirs
Probate
Probate is a process used to validate your will and make sure your wishes are 
carried out. Your estate pays the costs, which can run as high as 5 to 6 per-
cent or more of your gross estate at death, depending on where you live.
 
Owning property within a revocable living trust can avoid the costs of probate 
and may leave more assets for your heirs. Work with an estate-planning attor-
ney to see what your options are.
Family limited partnerships
If you own assets such as real estate or business interests that you believe 
are going to grow, you may consider using a family limited partnership. A 
family limited partnership consists of general partners and limited partners, 
all of whom are family members. The general partners — typically you and 
your spouse if you’re married — run the partnership. The limited partners, 
your heirs, have an ownership interest in the assets held by the partnership 
but have no control over any of the assets while you’re alive.
When you die, your heirs become the general partners and take control of 
the assets. If the partnership is structured properly, only today’s value of 
those assets will be included in your taxable estate at death. Work with an 
experienced estate-planning attorney if you’re interested in this tactic.
Life insurance
If you want to ensure that you leave an inheritance to your heirs, life insur-
ance may be a good solution. Or if you have a sizeable estate that may be 
subject to estate taxes, life insurance may fulfill your needs.
 
To avoid having the insurance benefit included in your taxable estate, consult 
an attorney about the benefits of using an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT). 
By having an ILIT own the life insurance, the death benefit can be excluded 
from your taxable estate at death and provide money to pay estate taxes.

Know Which Types of Investments 
You Need for Retirement Income
By Martha Schilling, AAMS, CRPC, ETSC, CSA
W
hen you get to retirement, you have a little wiggle room in your life-
style. You’ve paid down debt, the children are out on their own, and 
now is the time for golf, leisure, and other hobbies. Make sure you manage 
your income, because taking money out of equities or other investments on a 
periodic basis without having a plan can reduce your portfolio by as much as 
50 percent in a volatile market.
In this strategy, you find out how to segment your funds into categories for 
near-term, mid-term, and long-term availability. You want safety for now, bal-
ance for the near future, and continued growth for later. This mix helps you 
weather current and future volatility with the least impact on your funds over 
the long term.
Keep Safe Investments for 
What You Need Now
After you determine your fixed and variable monthly expenses (see Strategy 
#40 for assistance), figure out how much money you’ll need after collecting 
Social Security, pension, and annuities. Knowing your expected shortfall 
helps you determine how much you need to take from your portfolio each 
month. When you know how much you need, you can determine how much 
risk to take and what kinds of securities you need to invest in.
Any money you need within two to three years shouldn’t be in stocks. Use 
money market funds, short-term bond funds, CDs, and U.S. Treasury bills and 
notes for near-term spending. (See Strategies #17 and #18 for more on these 
types of investments.) As you spend down these assets, replenish them with 
the funds from your mid-term assets. This safety net keeps you from having

 #81: Know Which Types of Investments You Need for Retirement Income
Maintain Your Balance
The mid-term segment of your plan should be the balanced portion of your 
portfolio. It should have laddered bonds that mature as needed or bond 
funds/exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide monthly income. Include 
higher-yielding real estate investment trusts (REITs), preferred securities, 
and dividend-paying stocks or stock mutual funds. The income from these 
vehicles pours into your money markets to replenish the short-term funds 
you’re drawing down.
Go for Growth for Longer-Term Needs
With the remainder of your funds, maintain a well-diversified portfolio that 
includes the major asset classes in U.S., international, and emerging market 
equities to reap the rewards of alternating classification stars. Use this 
growth to periodically replenish the securities you use for the mid-term seg-
ment. Think of your investments as having a waterfall or cascading effect. As 
the pool at the bottom gets drained, you pour out a little from the top-growth 
tier into the mid-term pool, which overflows into the pool on the bottom. 
Allow the funds at the top to continue to grow as you spend down other 
assets, and you provide an inflation-protected income stream for your later 
use in retirement. When times are tough for stocks, you can always use up 
the mid-term securities a little faster than you’d like. That gives you time to 
wait for the stock market to rebound, thus avoiding selling into a bad market.
 
Employer-sponsored retirement accounts such as 401(k) and 403(b) plans 
often have high annual fees and limited choices. A trustee-to-trustee rollover 
to an IRA with a discount broker can give you better investment options and 
lower costs. Determine your target percentages and rebalance annually.
Always Think “Tax Return”
One overlying consideration at all three investment levels is taxation. 
Distributions from Roth IRAs and income from municipal bonds are tax-
exempt. On the other hand, distributions from traditional IRAs are subject to 
ordinary income tax liability, which is currently as high as 35 percent. Taxable 
accounts face favorable long-term capital gains rates, which are currently 15 
percent. You should manage your distributions to minimize the tax bite.

Ten Tips for Building a Solid 
Financial Foundation
G
etting your financial household in order once and for all helps prepare 
you financially for all the potentialities you may face in your lifetime. 
With a solid financial foundation, you can withstand just about every bout of 
market turmoil or financial crisis that may be heading your way. Here’s how 
to set yourself up for success:
 
 Establish adequate cash reserves. In the event of a downturn in the 
markets, a family emergency, or loss of income, nothing is as comforting 
as having adequate cash reserves to get you through those rough times.
 
 Invest in your ability to earn money. One of the biggest — if not the 
biggest — assets you have is your ability to earn money. In uncertain 
times, invest in yourself. Continue to sharpen your axe, whether you’re 
securely employed, between jobs, temporarily retired, or permanently 
retired. Often, the easiest way to reduce the stress and strain on your 
investment nest egg is to continue to earn money, even for a short 
period of time.
 
 Give yourself credit. Managing your debt wisely — by minimizing or 
eliminating debt — reduces personal and financial stress. Building an 
excellent credit history provides you with options to access money if 
and when you need it.
 
 Insure your income. If you’re not yet retired, make sure you have 
adequate disability insurance. If you need your paycheck to survive, 
you need disability insurance, just in case you can’t earn that paycheck 
due to a prolonged illness or injury. If others (such as your spouse or 
family) depend on your income, you also need adequate life insurance to 
replace your income if you die prematurely.
 
 Provide for healthcare expenses. Make sure you have medical insur-
ance and consider whether long-term care insurance is right for you.
 
 Cover your assets. Periodically review your homeowner’s or renter’s 
insurance, automobile insurance, and liability insurance to make sure 
you’re adequately insured.

352
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
 Diversify your investment portfolio. One of the best things you can do 
to minimize the majority of investment risks is to effectively diversify 
your portfolio.
 
 Monitor and rebalance. After you establish the proper diversification 
for your investment portfolio, spend a little time on it once or twice a 
year. Make sure you’re monitoring your investment portfolio’s perfor-
mance relative to its peers on a risk-adjusted basis, and be sure to rebal-
ance your portfolio back to your original target allocation.
 
 Plan for certainties in life. Many of the major events that occur in your 
life shouldn’t come as surprises. Maybe the timing is a surprise, but the 
event itself shouldn’t blindside you. Think about these potential events. 
Is your car on its last leg? Do you have children who you want to help 
through college? Would you like to be able to retire and maintain your 
standard of living someday? These events are near certainties. The 
details or timing may be fuzzy, but these events will most likely occur. 
Prepare in advance — as much as possible — for these eventualities.
 
 Get help. If you’re unsure of where to turn for personal help and direc-
tion about your personal financial situation, be proactive. Get help 
sooner rather than later. With time on your side, you have many more 
options.

Ten Tips to Minimize Risk
Y
ou face a variety of risks in your financial life. Some of these risks can 
and should be avoided. Others can be transferred to an insurance com-
pany. And some risks are a normal part of your investing life. The following 
list identifies the primary risks and the most common suggestions of ways 
you can best handle these risks:
 
 Understand risk. Possibly the best thing you can do for yourself is 
understand investment and financial risks and discover which ones can 
be transferred through insurance and which ones may be minimized 
by different investment strategies. Understand history and plan for the 
future.
 
 Be aware of volatility in the financial markets. Check your risk profile 
and select a portfolio allocation that lets you tolerate all market cli-
mates. Then diversify your portfolio across a broad mix of investments 
that aren’t all subject to the same risks.
 
 Watch out for inflation. Invest in equities (stocks, mutual funds, or 
exchange-traded funds) that tend to do well during inflationary periods, 
such as consumer staples (toothpaste and toilet paper), energy, real 
estate, and alcohol and tobacco. Put some of your fixed income alloca-
tion into Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS).
 
 Set goals. Determine where you are now and what you need to realize 
your goals. Periodically review your status and make adjustments as 
necessary.
 
 Have a plan for unexpected expenses. Even the best of plans can be 
derailed by unexpected financial issues. Think through all the potential 
what-if scenarios in your life and explore how you can best handle these 
issues. Adequate cash reserves, ample liquidity, a steady income, and 
good insurance can get you through the majority of life’s financial 
emergencies.
 
 Maintain liquidity and flexibility. Avoid unnecessary expenses. Avoid 
all consumer debt, and build up a comfortable emergency reserve. Have 
a line of credit available for true emergencies only. Maintain a great 
credit score.

354
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
 Control costs. When you think of investments, keep in mind three pri-
mary factors that influence total returns:
 
• The returns provided by the markets
 
• Income taxes
 
• Investment expenses
 
 The latter two factors can make up a significant chunk of your total 
return. You have little control over what the markets provide; however, 
you have a great amount of influence over the taxation and expenses on 
your investments. Exercise that control!
 
 Make sure your retirement money lasts. As for the risk of outliving your 
money, you have a few options. You may be able to accumulate gobs 
of money so this isn’t a concern. For everyone else, strongly consider 
working and postponing Social Security retirement benefits until full 
retirement age, or better yet, age 70. If you’re lucky enough to have a 
defined benefit pension plan, do the same. If you don’t have a pension 
plan, consider taking a portion of your nest egg at retirement and pur-
chasing an immediate annuity to provide you with guaranteed income 
for the rest of your life. Long-term healthcare can also devastate your 
finances, so consider buying long-term care insurance.
 
 Wisely tap into retirement income. Have a plan for drawing down your 
assets in retirement (see Part VI). This plan can help you minimize taxes, 
make sure money is available to fund the distributions, and maximize 
any remainder for your heirs.
 
 Hedge your risks. Investors often achieve hedging by purchasing insur-
ance to protect themselves from risks they can’t afford to bear; how-
ever, insurance isn’t available or appropriate for all risks that you face 
in your financial life. Hedge most of your financial risk with insurance. In 
select circumstances, you may want to hedge a portion of your invest-
ment portfolio with stock options (see Strategy #28).
