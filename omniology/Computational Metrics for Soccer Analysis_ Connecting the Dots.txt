SpringerBriefs present concise summaries of cutting-edge research and practical
applications across a wide spectrum of ﬁelds. Featuring compact volumes of 50–
125 pages, the series covers a range of content from professional to academic.
Typical publications can be:
• A timely report of state-of-the art methods
• An introduction to or a manual for the application of mathematical or computer
techniques
• A bridge between new research results, as published in journal articles
• A snapshot of a hot or emerging topic
• An in-depth case study
• A presentation of core concepts that students must understand in order to make
independent contributions
SpringerBriefs are characterized by fast, global electronic dissemination,
standard publishing contracts, standardized manuscript preparation and formatting
guidelines, and expedited production schedules.
On the one hand, SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology are
devoted to the publication of fundamentals and applications within the different
classical engineering disciplines as well as in interdisciplinary ﬁelds that recently
emerged between these areas. On the other hand, as the boundary separating
fundamental research and applied technology is more and more dissolving, this
series is particularly open to trans-disciplinary topics between fundamental science
and engineering.

Chapter 1
Brief Review About Computational Metrics
Used in Team Sports
Abstract The purpose of this chapter is to analyze how position data have been
used in the aim of match analysis. A brief related work will present the main mea-
sures and results that come from soccer analysis based on georeferencing. Individual
measures that characterize the time-motion proﬁle, tactical behavior, predictability,
stability and spatial exploration of players will be discussed. Collective measures
that represent the Geometrical Center and team’s dispersion will be also presented
during this chapter. The main evidences that resulted from these measures will be
brieﬂy discussed.

Using the Dots to Characterize Individual Behavior:
Related Work
Tracking systems have been used to follow the instantaneous positions of soccer
players in both training and game situations [6]. These tracking systems determine
the position of a player in a Cartesian coordinate system [35, 41], representing each
player as a dot. Multicamera semi-automatic systems, local position measurement
technology and global positioning system technology are the most used options to
quickly record and process the data of players’ positions on a pitch [3].
The wide use of these tracking systems provided new possibilities of analysis in
the case of soccer. New applications and techniques are now used to determine and
estimate individual and collective performance of players and teams [20]. Sports
sciences are now capable of using the knowledge from scientiﬁc areas such as math-
ematics, physics, computer science and engineering to objectively measure perfor-
mance, adjust training plans and make better decisions during a match [10].
The most common application of position data to support the daily practice of
coaches and sport scientists is the calculus of time-motion proﬁles of players during
training sessions and matches [5]. By using time-motion proﬁles, it is possible to

determinate the external load of players during their activities, namely measuring
walking, jogging, running, striding and sprinting distances and characterizing the
high-intensity activities as accelerations and decelerations [31]. Individualization of
these data provides immediate and signiﬁcant information regarding training loads
and the impact on each player [33]. Moreover, motion-analysis also allows to deter-
mine the extent of fatigue experienced by players during competitions and identify
the variance of performance during the season [6].
Position data have also been used to analyze the behavior of players [16, 39, 41].
Players and the ball were tracked in a single match as a case-study [41]. In that study,
it was observed that all players, except the goalkeeper, follow the movements of the
ball more closely in the longitudinal axis than in the lateral one [41]. However, in
the same study it was found that the ball changed direction in the lateral axis with
more frequency than in longitudinal one.
The variability of movements has also been analyzed through the use of Kol-
mogorov Entropy, Sample Entropy or Approximate Entropy [24]. Such approach
allows for the identiﬁcation of positional variability of a player in a time-series and
to understand the regularity of their movements during the game [39]. The informa-
tion of a position in a histogram can also be measured in its variability by using the
Shannon Entropy [17].
In a single-match case study it was found that the higher values of Approximate
Entropy and Shannon Entropy were found in midﬁelders [17]. In an alternative
application, it was found that increasing the pitch size (as a task constraint) would
result in a decrease of variability, thus the individual player zone was smaller [39].
The exploration of the pitch can be another interesting use of position data in
soccer. In a study that analyzed the inﬂuence of pitch area-restrictions on tactical
behavior, it was found that the Spatial Exploration Index can be higher under free-
spacing conditions [29].
As possible to identify, position data provide a lot of possibilities to analyze the
motion of players and characterize the behaviors in different scenarios. The use
of such approaches may provide information to adjust Small Sided Games (SSGs)
(smaller versions of soccer games) [14] and to add speciﬁc task constraints that may
help in the re-adjustment of individual tactical behavior [19]. The use of position
data to characterize individual behavior is growing and for that reason the major
applications have not been published, so far.
However,notonlyindividualbehaviorcanbemeasuredbyusingpositiondata.The
synchronization with an individual opponent (dyad), with teammates (cooperation)
or with the opponents (opposition) is another possibility, used to objectively measure
and determine patterns of interaction. Based on that, Sect.1.2 will brieﬂy present the
related work about the use of position data to characterize the collective behavior of
players during the games.

Measuring the Collective Behavior Based
on Data-Position: Related Work
Interaction between teammates can be interpreted and measured in many different
ways [20]. Traditional and new approaches to the match analysis provide new insight
about the information that can be used to characterize the teams and their process
of cooperation and opposition with other teams [40]. For that reason, the analysis
can be done on an intra-level, to characterize the networking of a team, or on an
inter-level, to identify the “rapport de forces” (balance of strengths) [30].
Collective organization can be understood as a dynamic process that emerges
from the context based on the constraints of the match [34]. The interactions among
teammates may be measured with a position data analysis [10]. In a spatio-temporal
analysis we may identify the synchronization of teammates and the shapes of the
team in different playing scenarios [2].
Some measures based on position data have been proposed to classify the col-
lective behavior of teams and to identify the synchronization with the opponents
[20, 40]. The classiﬁcation of the measures can be based on their aim [1]: (i) team
center; (ii) team dispersion; (iii) team synchronization; and (iv) division of labor
within teams.
Measures that analyze the team center aim at identifying the Geometrical Center
of a set of dots (in this case, the players of a team) [9]. Three different approaches
have been conducted to compute the Geometrical Center of a team: (i) the centroid,
that represents the exact Geometrical Center of the dots (players), excluding the
goalkeeper [27]; (ii) the weighted centroid, which considers all players but requires
the position of the ball to attribute weights to the position of each player in order
to compute the centroid [7]; and (iii) the centroid considering the middle of the
two farthest players [32]. The team center has been used to identify the variance of
the middle point of a team during the match, to analyze the in-phase relationships
between centroids of both teams and to identify the oscillations of centroids in critical
moments (e.g., shots, goals) [2, 13, 27, 38].
The purpose of team dispersion is to objectively measure the expansion of a team
and the areas covered by the players [28]. Usually, the dispersion of the teammates
depends both on the match and ball possession statuses [18]. A higher dispersion
of teammates can be observed in attacking moments than in defensive ones [36].
Different measures based on position data have been proposed: (i) Stretch Index,
which can be described as the mean dispersion of the players, considering the Geo-
metrical Center [21, 41]; (ii) weighted Stretch Index, which considers the dispersion
of the players to the weighted centroid [7]; (iii) team’s spread, which also consid-
ers the overall dispersion of all players [36]; (iv) Surface Area, which represents
the area of a polygon constituted by all teammates [22, 27]; (v) effective area of
play, which only considers the effective triangulations made by teammates [13]; (vi)
playing area, which represents the area of maximum width and length of a team, in
each instant [26]; (vii) team length and width, which measures the dispersion in both

axes [23]; and (viii) defensive play area and triangulations, which measures the area
covered by each sector of a team during defensive moments [12].
The main results of team’s dispersion revealed that teams occupy a bigger area
while in possession of the ball than in defensive moments [11]. Moreover, some
studies found that bigger areas occupied in defensive moments are associated with
critical moments such as suffered shots or goals [36]. The analysis of the synchro-
nization about the covered areas of both teams revealed a tendency to an in-phase
relationship, with the exception of short periods of anti-phase [37]. These exceptions
of anti-phase were associated with critical moments (e.g., shots and goals) [37].
The analysis of variability of these covered areas also revealed a tendency to be
more regular throughout the match, with a higher variability in the ﬁrst minutes of
the game [22]. The comparison with performance variables suggests that teams cover
greater areas against weaker teams [4] and that areas are bigger in drawing matches
than in losing or winning matches [11]. Finally, the triangulations made between
midﬁelders occupy a greater area than those between the other playing roles [15].
Different measures based on position data have been proposed to identify the
properties of teams and the behaviors of players. The major ranges have been used
to classify the division of labor among players [41]. The main evidences suggest
that defenders increase the individual covered area in attacking moments and that
forwards increase the areas in defending moments [20]. Voronoi diagrams have also
been used to characterize the spatial behavior of players and teams [25].
The axes “drawn” by the defensive, midﬁeld and forward sectors were also ana-
lyzed by a speciﬁc measure [8]. The Sectorial Lines measure represents the line of a
set of dots (players) in a speciﬁc region of a team. The synchronization of these three
lines (defensive, midﬁeld and forward) was small, thus suggesting an independent
angular positioning between sectors during attacking and defensive moments [8].
As possible to identify, all these collective measures provide an interesting
approach to the analysis of the match and may reveal some patterns of interac-
tion between teammates and between teams, which can be determinant to optimize
the training process and to make informed decisions about the strategy to adopt in a
game.
The following sections will discuss the usability of these measures in match analy-
sis and how to compute them in a dedicated software called Ultimate Performance
Analysis Tool (uPATO).

How to Use the Dots to Analyze the Behavior
and the Collective Organization
Abstract Position data can be obtained from different approaches and techniques.
Based on that, the aim of this chapter is to brieﬂy present the main methods that have
been used to track players during the games and training sessions and to discuss which
kind of information can be used to analyze the individual and collective behavior.
The introduction to the uPATO software will be also executed. This software allows
to import position data from multi-camera tracking systems or Global Positioning
System (GPS) and to compute tactical and collective measures representing group
behavior.

Following the Players? Tracking Systems to Determine
the Data Position
Tracking the movement of players during a match has become a common practice
in sports [6]. The use of position data of players allows coaches to better understand
the performance of players and of the team, giving them a competitive advantage
over other teams. From position data, it is possible to calculate different metrics,
both individual and collective, that give a better comprehension on training exercises
and real game situations performance. From these measurements, match dynamics
and team dependencies and coordination (both intra-team and inter-team) can be
analyzed, as well as tactical patterns and their changes with regard to game moments,
giving coaches and teams a powerful tool for performance analysis and data for
metrics calculation [11].
Different tracking mechanisms and systems exist, each with their advantages
and disadvantages. From multiple camera systems to local position systems or GPS
systems, it is possible to track the position of players with good accuracy, and extract
position data on every measured instant across a deﬁned time interval. From the data,
it is possible to calculate metrics and extrapolate information on the players and the
team, which allows for a more comprehensive analysis of a game [12].

How to Use the Dots to Analyze the Behavior and the Collective Organization
The following sections give some insight on different tracking systems for the
position of players on set time instants.
2.1.1
Camera Systems
Camera systems record live footage of a game, which is then processed to detect
each player on the ﬁeld. Object detection can be made with different procedures,
such as background subtraction or shape detection. From this, it is then possible to
obtain location data of the players for that frame, which represents a time instant.
For improving coverage of the ﬁeld, some systems utilize multiple cameras, placed
at different angles, where each camera covers an area of the ﬁeld [12]. Another
possibility is the use of rotating and zoom-enabled cameras (such as Pan-Tilt-Zoom
(PTZ) cameras) [7, 8]. The full camera set captures the entire playing ﬁeld. Captured
frames are either fused ﬁrst for detection, or ﬁrst individually analyzed on each
camera, and then the detected players on each camera are joined. From the detected
players, tracking algorithms are used to compute the movement of the players across
frames and, from there, calculate the positions of each player across the frames.
Camera systems provide some signiﬁcant advantages over other tracking methods,
mainly the possibility of tracking ofﬁcial games, since players are not allowed to
have devices on them during these matches. Some systems, such as DatatraX and
Feedbacksport, allow for cameras to be moved to different ﬁelds, but the majority of
camerasystemsrequireaﬁxedinstallation,meaningthatteamsonlyhavedataontheir
home matches [6]. However, these systems also have some issues and disadvantages,
mainly in terms of occlusion, change in light conditions, the need to install and
calibrate cameras, the computational weight of the image processing and the time it
takes to have all data registered [6].
2.1.2
GPS Systems
Global Positioning System is most commonly used in military or commercial appli-
cations for location tracking and orientation. It is a system composed of 27 satellites,
orbiting the Earth. Time information is sent from the satellites to a GPS receiver, and
through time comparison (of the clock on the satellites with the clock on the receiver)
a position is triangulated. A minimum of four satellites is required to triangulate the
position accurately [9, 10].
This systemcanalsobeadoptedas apositiondatatrackingdevicefor players. Each
player is accompanied by a GPS receiver, which tracks its position at every measured
instant. With this, it is possible to measure performance in sports in less restricted
environments, and analyze real game situations through the gathered data [10]. Some
systems also add other sensors to the GPS receiver, to track physiological data, such
as heart rate or hydration.

2.1 Following the Players? Tracking Systems to Determine the Data Position
9
Previous GPS units had several disadvantages when compared to other architec-
tures, due to high acquisition cost, lack of precision and low report frequency, which
made it difﬁcult to gather reliable speed and acceleration data. Nowadays, most GPS
devices have improved on these previous points, but maintain other disadvantages,
such as the size of the devices, battery life, the amount of data generated due to
the better reporting rate, and the inability to use GPS indoors, making the system
unusable in indoor sports. GPS remains heavily dependant on satellite connection,
making even outdoors unreliable in certain low coverage situations.
GPS devices have an average reliability on reported distance, which is reduced
with the increase of velocity or changes in direction. When measuring longer move-
ments, in time and distance, the error in measurement stays below 5%, but when
measuring sprints the error can be as high as 77% for a 10m sprint on a 1Hz GPS
device (1Hz signiﬁes that one report is made each second) [4].
GPS devices have other advantages though. They are not affected by lighting
conditions, and can track players even when grouped up. They are also portable, not
being restricted to a single ﬁeld, and require practically no setup when compared
with camera-based systems.
GPS tracking was the used method for the position data of players used on the
uPATO framework, with recourse to GPS units (10Hz, Accelerometer 1kHz, Field-
Wiz, Paudex, Switzerland).
2.1.3
Other Systems
Other types of tracking systems exist, albeit not as popular as the ones presented in the
previous sections. The ﬁrst methods used for capture were through the recording of
the match, and then manually measuring and annotating positions and movements,
and comparing with videotaped movements of players (e.g., sprinting) to provide
some measures of calibration and comparison [6]. Other, more recent techniques,
include, for example, the TrakPerformance (Sportstec, Warriewood, NSW, Australia)
system, where a pen is used on a drawing tablet to register the movement of a single
player on the ﬁeld [6], or the Local Position Measurement (LPM) system (Inmotio
Object tracking v2.6.9.545, 45Hz, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), where players wear
a vest transmitter and several base stations are placed to capture the signals of the
vests [5]. The ﬁrst system has the advantage of being highly portable, inexpensive and
usable virtually on any ﬁeld, but it can only track one player, requires continuous
operation and is dependent on the skill of who is registering the movement. The
second system has the advantage of being usable both indoors and outdoors, when
compared with a traditional GPS, but requires installation of the base stations and is,
therefore, not portable between ﬁelds.

2.2
Introducing the uPATO Software: From GPSs to Data
Import
The uPATO is a tool developed with the objective of providing users with an easy
way for analyzing the performance of players at a collective and individual level, in
team sports. It is composed of three major modules: a GPS module for analyzing
GPS data, a module for analyzing matrices containing data from passes and goals
and a module providing representations for comparing metrics. The subject of this
book focuses on position data, thus centering the discussion around this tool’s GPS
module and omitting the other two modules.
The GPS data is organized and stored in a database, which requires the installation
of MySQL, creation of a database and conﬁguration of a user with access to it. In order
to access the database and its data, the application presents a login menu, requiring
the introduction of the username and password previously conﬁgured. After the login
menu, the user has access to all the functions of the module: introduce/import data,
calculate metrics and process data, visualize representations of the metrics and game
animations.
The ﬁrst step is then importing data to the database for future processing and
consulting. An overview of the importation process is described in Sect.2.2.1. While
Sect.2.2.2 brieﬂy introduces the process of calculating the available metrics in this
tool and Sect.2.2.3 discusses how the results are presented to the user and how they
become available for exportation.
2.2.1
Importing Data
A database was designed with team sports in mind, being organized into the following
main tables:
• Location—consists in a ﬁeld or location where a game took place;
• Team—consists in a team of players;
• Game—a combination of two teams, a location and a date;
• Player—each of the players;
• Data—the location of a player at each instant during a game.
Before importing data into the system, the involving structure needs to be created,
including the location, teams, game and player. Each of these entities is created in
a separate menu, through the submission of a speciﬁc form such as the one shown
in Fig.2.1, used in the submission of a new ﬁeld (or location). In this case, the user
ﬁlls the form with a name and, either with the width and height of the ﬁeld, or with
the GPS coordinates of the four corners of the ﬁeld. The order of the corners does
not matter, as long as they are inserted following any circular direction.
Another example of a form is displayed in Fig.2.2 for the creation of a new player.
In this case the required data include the name, number, position and team.

2.2 Introducing the uPATO Software: From GPSs to Data Import

The system currently recognizes four different ﬁle formats of GPS data: the ﬁrst
two are similar, with the ﬁle describing the positions of a single player, where each
row contains the instant of time and the position of that player (ﬁle formats obtained
from the FieldWiz system [1]). The only difference between the two ﬁle formats is
that one of them contains an initial matrix with the dimensions of the ﬁeld before
the rows with the actual data; the three other ﬁle formats include data from multiple
players in a single ﬁle. One of them contains, in each row, the instant, position
and name of the corresponding player (multiple players per ﬁle) and the other one
describes ﬁles where each row contains an instant and the positions of a set of players
in that instant (multiple players per row) (which is the ﬁle format used in the Johan
system [2]).

Fig. 2.3 Image of the form used in the importation of new data in one of the multiple players per
ﬁle format recognized
Data from the TraXports system [3] are also recognized by the uPATO, even
though its data isn’t GPS based.
The introduction of data is divided into individual and multiple data formats,
displaying a form for the selection of the game, player and speciﬁc ﬁle format in the
ﬁrst case and game, team and speciﬁc ﬁle format in the second. Fig.2.3 presents the
form used in the importation of data from a ﬁle from one of the multiple players per
ﬁle format recognized, as previously described.
2.2.2
Processing Data
After inserting the data into the system, the user is able to calculate several metrics
on the data. The uPATO divides metrics into two different sets: collective metrics,
which involve data from all the players in a team; and individual metrics, referring
to metrics calculated on the speciﬁc data of a player. A complete list of the metrics
available for computing is presented in Appendix A.
In order to calculate the available metrics, two menus are available, one for each
type, containing a speciﬁc form for selecting the data for processing, with the remain-
ing steps being performed automatically by the system.

Results and Representations
When the calculation of the metrics is complete, representations are created with
the results and presented to the user. The presented data is available for exportation
at the press of a button, saving all data into .csv ﬁles and the representations into
image ﬁles. With the data in .csv ﬁles, they can then be imported and analyzed in other
systems or, in some cases, depending on the format, be passed to the data comparison
module, which will then create barplots or boxplots of the data, allowing for a visual
comparison and analysis.
Another function provided by uPATO is the creation of game animations with the
position data of players. This option is available through the submission of a form
selecting the data of interest, in the Game Animation menu. The game animation
presents an animation of the selected period of time, where each player is represented
by a dot positioned accordingly in the ﬁeld and updated in real time. The animation
also calculates most collective metrics, allowing users to visualize these metrics and
some of their values at the same time as watching the game.

Individual Metrics to Characterize
the Players
Abstract The purpose of this chapter is to present the individual measures that can
be computed in the uPATO software. Each measure will be presented with a deﬁnition
and case-studies to discuss the data and how results can be interpreted. Time-motion
proﬁle (including distances at different speeds), Shannon Entropy, Longitudinal and
Lateral Displacements to the goal and variability, Kolmogorov Entropy and Spatial
Exploration Index will be presented and discussed in this chapter. The case studies
presented involve two ﬁve-player teams in an SSG considering only the space of half
pitch (68m goal-to-goal and 52m side-to-side) and another eleven-player team in a
match considering the space of the entire ﬁeld (106.744m goal-to-goal and 66.611m
side-to-side) even though only playing in half pitch.

Time-Motion Proﬁle
3.1.1
Basic Concepts
From the position data of a player, it is possible to compute both the distance covered
between two measurements and the velocity at which that distance was covered. It
is then possible to segment the covered distance in regard to the type of movement,
based on the velocity of the player.
Deﬁnition 3.1 [19] Let P be a set of points where each point represents the position
of a player on each measured time instant. The average velocity of a player is obtained
through the following equation:
V =

(x1 −x0)2 + (y1 −y0)2
t
,
(3.1)
where (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) represent two consecutive positions of a player, and t
represents the time interval between the measurements of the two points.

Individual Metrics to Characterize the Players
Deﬁnition 3.2 [17] The distance covered by a player with a given type of movement
is calculated through the following equation:
Dist =
 
(x1 −x0)2 + (y1 −y0)2,
(3.2)
where the average velocity calculated between (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is within the
threshold of the type of movement.
Remark 3.1 The separation of the distances covered by the player when walking,
jogging, running and sprinting is deﬁned by velocity thresholds. The chosen thresh-
olds are deﬁned in [13].

General Interpretation
Time-motion analysis can be used to characterize the activity proﬁle of players during
matches and training sessions [5]. Typically, these analyses measure the distances
made at different speeds and acceleration thresholds [2]. However, the customizabil-
ity of speed thresholds afforded by GPS software resulted in a wide range of different
speed zones and thresholds, thus being difﬁcult to demarcate and compare different
locomotor activities between studies [8]. A recent brief review proposed the fol-
lowing speed thresholds, in km h−1, for moderate-, high-, very-high-speed running
and sprint [15]: [0; 5[, [5; 10[, [10; 15[, [15; 20[ and [25; +∞[, respectively. In the
case of uPATO software [6] the thresholds, in km h−1, are: [0; 7[ (walking); [7; 14[
(jogging); [14; 20[ (running); and [20; +∞[ (sprinting).
The use of absolute measures (total distance (m) in each speed threshold) or rela-
tive measures (e.g., m min−1) may also be important in the moment of interpretation.
Relative measures may provide a more accurate reﬂection of match intensity than
total distance covered, which only provides information about the volume [8]. This
option of pace (m min−1) can be visualized in the uPATO software.
The use of Time-motion analysis may help in characterizing the external load of
trainingsessionsandmatchesonplayersandfacilitatecoachdecisionmaking[4].The
analysis can be made by absolute or cohort-speciﬁc speed zones (player-independent)
or individualizing the thresholds by player according to his ﬁtness level [1]. The
use of individual ﬁtness levels make possible to determine the dose response in
competition situations and adjust the analysis to the individualized evolution during
the season [15].

3.2
Shannon Entropy
3.2.1
Basic Concepts
Shannon Entropy is calculated based on a player’s position. The entropy represents
how static or dynamic a player’s positioning on the ﬁeld is. Higher values are related
to a greater dispersion of the player on the ﬁeld (e.g., midﬁelders present higher
entropy values) while lower values represent a player with a more ﬁxed position on
the ﬁeld (e.g., a goalkeeper).
Deﬁnition 3.3 [7] Let pi be the probability mass function. Shannon Entropy is given
by the following formula:
E = −

i
pilog2pi.
(3.3)
Deﬁnition 3.4 [7] The probability mass function is given by:
pi = hi
Nc
,
(3.4)
where hi represents the histogram entry of intensity value i and Nc is the number of
total cells of the ﬁeld (in this implementation, the number of cells is given by the
area of the ﬁeld, in m2).

3.2.3
General Interpretation
Heat maps represent the spatial distribution of a player considering the time spent
in a speciﬁc position, thus being the frequency distribution of a player in the soccer
pitch [7]. The Shannon Entropy can be used to classify heat maps, thus providing
information about the spatial variability of the players in the pitch [7].
A value near 0 (zero) of Shannon Entropy suggests that the distribution is restricted
and that the position of the player can be easily predicted [18]. On the other hand,
higher values of Shannon Entropy indicate a more homogeneous distribution on the
soccer pitch (uniform distribution), thus suggesting a high variability and that player
is more unpredictable [18].
This measure can be used to identify the inﬂuence of different tasks during training
sessions in the variability of the players. Moreover, the Shannon Entropy can measure
the variability of position of players during the matches and classify the predictability
of these players on their playing roles. Coaches may use this information, about
the variability, to organize speciﬁc tasks that contribute to regulate the positioning
behavior of players and to monitor the individualized evolution during a season.

Longitudinal and Lateral Displacements to the Goal
and Variability
3.3.1
Basic Concepts
From the movement of a player across a set time interval, the angle between the
player and the perpendicular line to the middle point of the goal can be calculated for
every instant on the time interval, giving the angle to that line for the player. From
the movement of the player it is also possible to calculate the displacement trajectory
of the player in relation to the goal after a set time interval, these angles are best
explained in Fig.3.5.
Deﬁnition 3.5 [3, 10] Given a time-series of N instants, where each sample forms
a pair of position coordinates, (x, y), and given a time interval of displacement mea-
surements, T, the displacement angle of the movement of the player during the time
interval T is given by:
A = arccos

Fig. 3.5 Scheme for displacement angle and angle to goal calculation. The angle to goal of positions
P1, P2 and Q1 is given by the angles a, a2 and b, respectively. These angles are calculated taking
into consideration the axes x′ and y′. This makes the angles to goal vary between 90◦and 0◦for
player to the left of the perpendicular line to the goal, and between 0◦and −90◦for players located
to the right. As an example, a and a2 will have values in the 0◦to −90◦range, while b will have a
value in the 0◦to 90◦range. The displacement angle between two position of a player, P1 and P2,
is represented as angle c. The axes taken into consideration on the calculation are axes x′′ and y′′.
This angle can vary between −180◦and 180◦

23
where p1 is the vector deﬁned between the position of the player at the beggining
and end of the time interval T, and vg is the vector deﬁned by the starting position
of the player and the middle point of the goal.
Deﬁnition 3.6 [3, 10] Given a time-series of N instants, the angle, A, between the
line deﬁned by the player position on an instant i and the middle point of the goal
and the perpendicular line to the middle point of the goal is calculated as follows:
A = arctan(mpos),
(3.6)
where mpos is the slope of the line deﬁned by the player position on instant i and the
middle point of the goal. The slope is obtained by the following equation:
mpos = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
,
(3.7)
where (x1, y1) is the position of the player on instant i and (x2, y2) is the position of
the middle point of the goal.

Real Life Examples
The results obtained by three players in the SSG for the Longitudinal and Lateral
Displacements are presented in Table3.9 with intervals of 10s and Angle to Goal in
Table3.10 with intervals of 0.1s.

General Interpretation
Theplayer’spositioncanbeassociatedwiththeopponent’sgoalbasedonhisposition.
This measure considers the variation in the pitch and allows coaches to understand the
instantaneous variability of player. The measure will be useful for speciﬁc analysis to
the shots or goals. Long-term analysis cannot provide real information for coaches.
Longitudinal (goal-to-goal) and Lateral Displacement (side-to-side) trajectories of
players can be associated with the middle point of goal line [12]. The distance of the
players to the goal is measured and the displacement can be tracked instantaneously
by considering the referencing point in the middle of the goal line.

3.3 Longitudinal and Lateral Displacements to the Goal and Variability
25
This measure can be used to identify the variability of displacements made by
players in speciﬁc critical moments (e.g., attacking building, defensive organization).
Moreover, it can also be used to classify the collective synchronization in Longitu-
dinal and Lateral Displacements during critical moments. The capacity to move
simultaneously based on teammates’ displacements can be determinant in speciﬁc
moments, trying to ensure a cohesive structure and the unit [9].
3.4
Kolmogorov Entropy
The variability of a player across a game can be estimated through the Kolmogorov
Entropy, giving a comparison mean between players in terms of positioning on the
ﬁeld, with higher values being associated with players that occupy larger areas of
the ﬁeld in the match.

i (ε) can be given by:
Cm
i (ε) =

N −m + 1,
(3.8)
where Nj = {number of x(j) such that d(x(i), x(j)) ≤ε} and the distance between
x(i) and x(j) is given by:
d(x(i), x(j)) =

k=1,2,...,m |u(i + k −1) −u(j + k −1)|.

General Interpretation
The positioning variability considering a given time-series can be estimated by using
the Kolmogorov Entropy [7]. The variation in the players’ trajectories during the
periods of the game can be used to classify the regularity of players in keeping a
position or in occupying certain areas of play.
The Kolmogorov Entropy can be also used to analyze the variability of a set of
collective measures such as center of the game, Stretch Index or Surface Area [11].

Individual Metrics to Characterize the Players
This entropy measure belongs to the non-linear statistics and can provide information
about the regularity of individual and collective values.
Three main thresholds must be considered in the data interpretation of Kol-
mogorov Entropy [16]: ˜0 (periodic function); 0.1 (chaotic system); and 1.5 random
time series.

Spatial Exploration Index
3.5.1
Basic Concepts
From the position data, by measuring the average difference between a player’s aver-
age position and its actual position on each measured instant, the Spatial Exploration
Index is obtained.
Deﬁnition 3.9 [14] The Spatial Exploration Index of a player is given by:
SEI =
N
i

(xi −xm)2 + (yi −ym)2
N
,
(3.12)
where N represents the number of time instants for which the Spatial Exploration
Index is being calculated, (xm, ym) the mean position of the player over the time
period and (xi, yi) the position of the player on instant i.

General Interpretation
The Spatial Exploration Index was introduced as a novel measure to classify the
exploration of a player’s trajectory on the soccer pitch [14]. This measure uses the
mean pitch position and the distance of all position time-series to identify how far a
player goes beyond their “mean” point.
The values will vary based on the area of the soccer pitch and the positioning
role of the player. However, this measure can be used to identify which formats of
play and speciﬁc tasks may be used to improve the exploration of the soccer pitch or
to restrict the movement of players. The classiﬁcation of Spatial Exploration Index
in different playing scenarios may help coaches make decisions about the occupied
zone of the player and of ways to improve the movements on the soccer pitch.

Metrics to Measure the Center of the Team
Abstract This chapter discusses a set of metrics involving the Geometrical Cen-
ter (or centroid) of one or both teams. Each section describes a different metric,
including the associated formulae and deﬁnitions, representations if valid, and an
interpretation on what the metric can convey the user. The following measures will
be presented: Geometrical Center; Longitudinal and Lateral Inter-team Distances;
Time Delay between teams’ movements and Coupling Strength. The case studies
presented involve two ﬁve-player teams in an SSG considering only the space of half
pitch (68m goal-to-goal and 52m side-to-side) and another eleven-player team in a
match considering the space of the entire ﬁeld (106.744m goal-to-goal and 66.611m
side-to-side) even though only playing in half pitch.

where N represents the number of players in the team, pxk(i) the position along the
longitudinal axis for player k in instant i, and pyk(i) the position along the vertical
axis for player k in instant i.

4.1 Geometrical Center
35
4.1.3
General Interpretation
The Geometrical Center represents the middle point of a team [3]. Centroid, wcen-
troid or team’s center have been also used as synonymous of Geometrical Center [5,
7, 9]. The Geometrical Center based on the Euclidian distance of the dots (players)
provides useful information about the oscillation of the middle point of the team
during the match and in speciﬁc circumstances [1]. In some cases the Geometrical
Center has been used to identify the intra- and inter-team coordination tendencies in
a temporal series [6], namely to monitor the in- and anti-phase relationships between
Geometrical Centers from both teams [1, 3, 6]. In such analysis, some studies sug-
gested that non-synchronization of geometrical centers is associated with critical
moments [1, 5].
The Geometrical Center can be used by coaches to identify the speciﬁc position of
the middle point of the team during defensive and attacking moments and associate
such point with the Geometrical Center of the opponent team. Moreover, it can be
used to control the distances of the farthest players to the center of the team. The
association of the Geometrical Center with the oscillation of the ball can be also
useful to check the capacity of the team to move collectively based on the position
of the ball.
4.2
Longitudinal and Lateral Inter-team Distances
4.2.1
Basic Concepts
The different inter-team distances can be calculated through the difference between
the positions of the geometrical centers of the two teams.
Deﬁnition 4.2 [6] The instantaneous Longitudinal Inter-team Distance can be cal-
culated by the following equation:
iLoID = |xt1 −xt2|,
(4.2)
where xtk, k = 1, 2, represents the x coordinate of the Geometrical Center of team k
on the calculated instant.
Deﬁnition 4.3 [6] The instantaneous Lateral Inter-team Distance is given by the
following equation:
iLaID = |yt1 −yt2|,
(4.3)
where ytk, k = 1, 2, represents the y coordinate of the Geometrical Center of team k
on the calculated instant.

36
4
Metrics to Measure the Center of the Team
Deﬁnition 4.4 [6] The instantaneous total Inter-team Distance is given by the fol-
lowing equation:
iID =

(xt1 −xt2)2 + (yt1 −yt2)2,
(4.4)
where (xtk, ytk), k = 1, 2, represents the coordinates of the Geometrical Center of
team k on the calculated instant.
Deﬁnition 4.5 [6] The average Inter-team Distance can be calculated through the
following equation:
ID =
N
t=1 iID(t)
N
,
(4.5)
where iID(t) is the Inter-team Distance on a given instant t, and N the total of mea-
sured time instants. The same equation can be adapted for the average Longitudinal
and Lateral Inter-team Distances, by replacing iID(t) with iLoID(t) or iLaID(t),
respectively.

of 30s and for the entire 3min in Table4.4.
A screenshot of a representation of the total Inter-team Distance captured from
the uPATO software is displayed in Fig.4.2.
No results are presented for the match because this metric required the existence
of data from both teams, which is not available in the evaluated match.

4.2.3
General Interpretation
The association between geometrical centers of both teams can be used to classify
the synchronization during positional attacking, counter attack or defensive pressure.
Longitudinal and Lateral Inter-team Distances represent the distance between Geo-
metrical Centers of both teams in the two axes [6]. In the study conducted by the
authors of this measure [6] a 3-sec window was implemented to monitor the capacity
of this measure to anticipate critical match events.
The variability of the distance between both Geometrical Centers depends on
contextual factors. However, this can be useful to assess which game situations
approach or distance teams. Moreover, coaches can use such measure to classify
the inﬂuence of speciﬁc small-sided and conditioned games in the spatio-temporal
relationship. The classiﬁcation of speciﬁc defensive (defensive ’block’ or defensive
transition) or attacking moments (positional attack or counter-attack) can be also
made using this measure of distance in longitudinal and lateral axes.
4.3
Time Delay Between Teams’ Movements
4.3.1
Basic Concepts
The Time Delay between two teams is the time difference a team takes to adjust to a
change of positioning of the other team. This is approached by measuring the time it
takes for the Geometrical Center of a team to approach the other team’s center after
its movement.

Metrics to Measure the Center of the Team
Deﬁnition 4.6 [2, 8] Given a time-series with N measurements, where gmt1 and
gmt2 sets of points representing the Geometrical Center of each team across the
time-series, a window size w, a time lag τ on the integer interval −τmax ≤τ ≤τmax
and a time index i, a pair of time windows, Wx and Wy can be selected from the
time-series, for each coordinate of the Geometrical Center. The time windows are
given by:
Wx =

{xi, xi+1, xi+2, ..., xi+wmax}
if τ ≤0
{xi−τ, xi+1−τ, xi+2−τ, ..., xi+wmax−τ}
if τ > 0
(4.6)
Wy =

{yi+τ, yi+1+τ, yi+2+τ, ..., yi+wmax+τ}
if τ < 0
{yi, yi+1, yi+2, ..., yi+wmax}


i=1

,
(4.8)
where μ(Wx) and μ(Wy) are the mean of Wx and Wy, and sd(Wx) and sd(Wy) are
the standard deviation of Wx and Wy.
Deﬁnition 4.8 [8] Given the cross-correlation values for the different time windows
of τ lag, the Time Delay for each instant is given by the following equation:
TD(i) = max

r(Wx, Wy)(i)
	
,
(4.9)
where i represents the time instant of the time-series of N length.
To better represent the tendency of the time delays over a period of time, the
graphs exempliﬁed in Fig.4.3 are created through the use of Fourier Series and
linear regressions.

Metrics to Measure the Center of the Team
No results are presented for the match because this metric required the existence
of data from both teams, which is not available in the evaluated match.
4.3.3
General Interpretation
The Time Delay can be measured in longitudinal (goal-to-goal) and lateral (side-to-
side) directions. This measure assesses the existing Time Delay between both teams’
movements using the Geometrical Center [8]. The measure quantiﬁes the delay of
teams in adjusting to each other’s movements in both axes [8]. In the study that
proposed this measure it was found that in the majority (≈80%) of the cases the
teams adjusted the geometrical centers in less than 0.5s in the longitudinal axis [8].
More time was veriﬁed in lateral axis [8].
This measure can be used to identify longer periods (>0.5s) of no-synchronization
thatcanresultincriticalmoments(e.g.,shots,goals,counter-attacks).Theassociation
of shots/goals suffered and made can be performed to improve the usefulness of this
measure to anticipate critical events. Moreover, this measure can be used to identify
the evolution of synchronism in different periods of the match. Finally, coaches may
use this information to design games that promote smaller or longer periods of delay
and to adjust the team with real playing scenarios.
4.4
Coupling Strength
4.4.1
Basic Concepts
The Coupling Strength is calculated as the cross-correlation between the movement
of the two teams, according to their Geometrical Centers.
Deﬁnition 4.10 [2, 8] Given a time-series with N measurements, where gmt1 and
gmt2 sets of points representing the Geometrical Center of each team across the time-
series, a window size wmax, a time lag τ on the integer interval −τmax ≤τ ≤τmax
and a time index i, a pair of time windows, Wx and Wy can be selected from the
time-series, for each coordinate of the Geometrical Center. The time windows are
given by:
Wx =

{xi, xi+1, xi+2, ...xi+wmax}
if τ ≤0
{xi−τ, xi+1−τ, xi+2−τ, ...xi+wmax−τ}
if τ > 0
(4.13)
Wy =

{yi+τ, yi+1+τ, yi+2+τ, ...yi+wmax+τ}
if τ < 0
{yi, yi+1, yi+2, ...yi+wmax}
if τ > 0
(4.14)

4.4 Coupling Strength
41
Deﬁnition 4.11 [2, 8] From the time windows, the cross-correlation between the
time windows can be deﬁned as:
r(Wx, Wy) =
1
wmax
wmax

i=1
(Wxi −μ(Wx))(Wyi −μ(Wy))
sd(Wx)sd(Wy)
,
(4.15)
where μ(Wx) and μ(Wy) are the mean of Wx and Wy, and sd(Wx) and sd(Wy) are
the standard deviation of Wx and Wy. The Coupling Strength between the teams is
the cross-correlation value at zero-lags, when τ = 0.

for the entire 3min in Table4.8.

4.4.3
General Interpretation
The Coupling Strength was proposed to quantify the degree of coordination/ synchro-
nization of both teams’ movements in both axes (longitudinal and lateral) [8]. This
measure represents an association between the Geometrical Centers of both teams.
In the unique study conducted with this measure, 80% of the time it was veriﬁed a

Coupling Strength between 0.9 and 1s, in longitudinal axis [8]. Smaller percentage
of the time was veriﬁed in the lateral axis. Therefore, the Coupling Strength showed
that both teams were highly synchronous for most of the match time [8].
This measure can be used to identify the time spent in synchronization between
teams and to characterize the capacity of a team to adjust to the other. Moreover,
can be used to identify critical moments of the match that may contribute to increase
or decrease the Coupling Strength of the teams. Finally, different small-sided and
conditioned games lead to different Coupling Strengths and for that reason coaches
can use such information to work the capacity of the team to synchronize with other
or only to test the development of Coupling Strength of two teams during the match.

Measuring the Dispersion of the Players
Abstract The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the concepts of dispersion
in the aim of soccer analysis. A set of different measures have been proposed to
identify the level of dispersion between teammates and between opponents. Based on
that, a summary of the dispersion measures, deﬁnitions, interpretation and graphical
visualizationwillbepresentedonthischapter.ThemeasuresofStretchIndex,Surface
Area, Team Length and Team Width and lpwratio will be introduced throughout
the chapter. The case studies presented involve two ﬁve-player teams in an SSG
considering only the space of half pitch (68m goal-to-goal and 52m side-to-side)
and another eleven-player team in a match considering the space of the entire ﬁeld
(106.744 m goal-to-goal and 66.611m side-to-side) even though only playing in half
pitch.

Stretch Index
5.1.1
Basic Concepts
The Stretch Index of a team is calculated as the average distance of a team’s players
and the Geometrical Center, giving a notion of the compactness of the team.
Deﬁnition 5.1 [1] The Stretch Index, considering both axes, at a given instant t can
be calculated by:
SI(t) =
N
k

(pxk(t) −Cx(t))2 + pyk(t) −Cy(t))2
N
,
(5.1)
where C(t) represents the Geometrical Center of the team, N the number of players
in the team, Pxk(t) the position along the longitudinal axis for player k at instant t,
and Pyk(t) the position along the vertical axis for player k in instant t.

Deﬁnition 5.2 [1] The Stretch Index on a single axis, for a given instant t, is given
by the following expression:
SIx(t) =
N

k
|(pxk(t) −Cx(t))2)|,
(5.2)
where Cx(t) represents the x coordinate for the Geometrical Center at instant t and
Pxk(t) the position along the longitudinal axis for player k at instant t.
Remark 5.1 The same formula is applicable for the calculation along the vertical
axis, only replacing Pxk(t) for Pyk(t) and Cx(t) for Cy(t).
Deﬁnition 5.3 [1] The average values of the Stretch Index both for the coordinates,
along the two axes and for each axis separately, is given by the following equation:
SI =
N
k SI(t)
Nt

(5.3)
where Nt represents the total number of time instants measured.
Remark 5.2 This same formula is applicable for SIx and SIy, by replacing SI(t) for
SIx(t) or SIy(t), respectively.

Measuring the Dispersion of the Players
5.1.3
General Interpretation
Stretch Index was introduced in basketball to measure the expansion and contraction
of space, in both axes (longitudinal and lateral), demonstrated by a team during
a match [2]. This measure represents the mean deviation of each teammate to the
geometrical center [2, 3]. Stretch Index is also known as radius [4].
Dispersion of the players depends on contextual variables and mostly on the
moment of the game (with or without possession of the ball) [5]. Dispersion is greater
in attacking moments (with possession of the ball) and smaller in defensive pressure
(without possession of the ball), in the case of soccer [6]. This follows the main idea
that in attacking moments it is necessary to spread the players to attract the opponents
towards the outside of the middle and in defensive moments it is necessary to keep
the teammates closer to guarantee fewer spaces for opponent’s penetration [7].
This measure works in longitudinal, lateral and/or global, thus different informa-
tion can be used. In the case of the Stretch Index for the longitudinal axis it can be
computed to measure speciﬁc situations of counter attacks in which a greater disper-
sion in goal-to-goal direction can be observed. In the other hand, greater dispersions
are found in side-to-side during positional attack (ball circulation). Considering the
defensive moments, both axes will drastically decrease in comparison to attacking
moments. However, longitudinal dispersion can be used to classify the defensive
pressure against positional attacks in which large values of dispersion may suggest
that forward teammates are too far away from the defensive colleagues.

Surface Area
5.2.1
Basic Concepts
The Surface Area of a team is calculated as the area of the polygon deﬁned as the
convex polygon with the least number of vertices that can encompass all of the
teams’s players, and where the potential vertices are deﬁned as the positions of the
players.
Deﬁnition 5.4 [8, 9] Given a set of points, the following algorithm is applied to
deﬁne the Convex Hull:

Deﬁnition 5.5 [9, 10] Given the coordinates of the n vertices that compose the
Convex Hull of the team, the Surface Area is given by the following equation:
SA = |(x1y2 −y1x2) + (x2y3 −x3y2) + · · · + (xny1 −x1yn)|

(5.4)
where (xi, yi) are the coordinates of the ith vertex of the Convex Hull.

5.2.3
General Interpretation
SurfaceArearepresentstheareaofapolygonconstitutedbyallteammates(dots)[11].
The measure can be deﬁned as the total space covered by a team considering the area
within the convex hull [9]. The Surface Area measures the contraction and expansion
of teams across the soccer match, as does the Stretch Index [3]. However, this measure
represents all the area covered by the team, while the Stretch Index only measures
the mean deviation to the Geometrical Center of the team.
Typically, the area of the teams is signiﬁcantly bigger in possession of the ball
than without possession [3, 5]. Moreover, the variability of Surface Area decreases
across the game [4, 12], thus suggesting a stabilization of the team in attacking and
defensive moments.
In a study conducted in elite Spanish soccer teams values between 800 and 2800
m2 inattackingand[1000; 2000]m2 indefensivemomentswerefound[13].Valuesin
attackingvariedbetween1638and1831m2 inpossessionoftheballand[1277; 1369]
m2 without possession in an elite Portuguese team [14].
The visualization of Surface Area can help coaches identify the space between
sectors (defensive, middle and forward) and the dispersion of the team in speciﬁc
moments. The generated triangulations can provide an immediate analysis of the col-
lective behavior, particularly in moments of positional attack and defensive ‘block’.
5.3
Team Length and Team Width
5.3.1
Basic Concepts
The Team Length and Width is deﬁned by its most advanced and rear players for the
length, and its rightmost and leftmost players for the length.
Deﬁnition 5.6 [4] Given a set of points for team player positioning along a time-
series of length N, P, and where Px and Py represent the set of longitudinal and lateral
coordinates for every player of the team on every measured time instant, the Team
Length and Team Width on a given time instant i can be calculated as follows:
tl(i) = max(Px(i)) −min(Px(i))
(5.5)
tw(i) = max(Py(i)) −min(Py(i)),
(5.6)
where tl represents the Team Length, tw represents the Team Width and (Px(i), Py(i))
represents the set of coordinates of the team’s players in instant i.

5.3.3
General Interpretation
The Team Length represents the maximum length of a team considering the minimum
and maximum position of a player in the longitudinal (goal-to-goal) direction [4]. The
same application is applied in the case of Team Width (side-to-side) [4]. Therefore,
the length and width measures provide information about how stretched are the two
farthest players of a team in longitudinal and lateral directions.
Coaches can use this information to understand the optimal distances to readjust
some tactical tasks in training sessions based on usual length and width found in
ofﬁcial matches. An interesting approach used the width and length to suggest spe-
ciﬁc sizes to work positional attack and counter-attack in small-sided games [15].
Moreover, coaches can compare the length and width in different moments of the
match and identify in which moments the extreme size can be associated with critical
moments (e.g., shots, goals).
5.4
Length per Width Ratio
5.4.1
Basic Concepts
The ratio between a team’s length and width is the Length per Width Ratio (lpwratio)
of that team.
Deﬁnition 5.7 [16] Given tl and tw as the Team Length and Team Width of a team
on a given instant, the lpwratio of a team is given by the following equation:
lpwratio = tl
tw
.

The authors of this measure argue that small variations of this measure may suggest
a team’s higher adherence to width and concentration on “principles of play” [16].
In the other hand, large variations of this ratio may suggest a more individual and
less collectively coordinated approach to the soccer game [16].
Coaches can use this measure to classify the teams in different moments of the
match. Some teams will tend to play in counter-attack, thus increasing the length
and reducing the width. In the other hand, teams that opt to attack with circulation

of the ball will have increased width and reduced the length. This relationship will
help to understand some patterns of play. The same case can be applied for defensive
moments in which teams that opt to defend in ‘block’ closer to the goal will present
decreased length and teams that opt to extend the defensive ‘block’ for middle or
forward zones of the pitch will have increased length.

Measuring the Tactical Behavior
Abstract Tactical information can be determinant to use position data and measures
in the aim of match analysis. By using information about collective behavior and tac-
tics it is possible to re-organize tasks or even make decisions during matches. These
measures are not limited to the space (as centroid or team’s dispersion) but can also
provide information on how teammates interact in the speciﬁcity of game and in line
with tactical principles. Deﬁnitions, graphical visualization, interpretation and case-
studies will be presented on this chapter for the following measures: Inter-player
Context, Teams’ Separateness, Directional Correlation Delay, Intra-team Coordina-
tion Tendencies, Sectorial Lines, Inter-axes of the team, Dominant Region, Major
Ranges and Identiﬁcation of Team’s Formations. The case studies presented involve
two ﬁve-player teams in an SSG considering only the space of half pitch (68 m goal-
to-goal and 52m side-to-side) and another eleven-player team in a match considering
the space of the entire ﬁeld (106.744 m goal-to-goal and 66.611m side-to-side) even
though only playing in half pitch.

General Interpretation
The Inter-player Context represents the positional changes of players with respect
to all other players, thus being the relative position with respect to teammates and
opponents [25]. The Inter-player Context proposed has nine possible contexts [25]:
(i) “Rear teammate between advanced opponent and own goal”; (ii) “Intermedi-
ate teammate between advanced opponent and own goal”; (iii) “Advanced team-
mate between advanced opponent and own goal”; (iv) “Rear teammate between
advanced and rear opponent”; (v) “Intermediate teammate between advanced and
rear opponent”; (vi) “Advanced teammate between advanced and rear opponent”;
(vii) “Rear teammate between rear opponent and the opposing goal”; (viii) “Inter-
mediate teammate between rear opponent and the opposing goal”; (ix) “Advanced
teammate between rare opponent and the opposing goal”.
This measure can be used to classify the positioning of a given player consider-
ing the teammates and the opponents and to determine the percentage of time and
frequency of time spent at different playing contexts. This measure can help coaches
understand the inﬂuence of small-sided and constrained games or similar tasks in
the development of speciﬁc tactical behavior of players. Moreover, the information

about the player’s contexts can provide opportunities to optimize the behavior in next
occasions.
6.2
Teams’ Separateness
6.2.1
Basic Concepts
Teams’ Separateness is calculated as the sum of the distances between each of the
team’s players and their closest opponents.
Deﬁnition 6.2 [27] Given a time-series of length N with position data on each
player of each team, and where each team is composed of Nteam players, the Teams’
Separateness, TS, can be calculated as follows:
TS =

(6.1)
such that d(i) =

where (xj(i), yj(i)) represents the positions of player j in instant i, where j is always
a player of the ﬁrst team, and (xk(i), yk(i)) represents the positions of player k in
instant i, where k is always a player of the second team.

6.2.3
General Interpretation
The Teams’ Separateness quantiﬁes the degree of free movement each team has avail-
able and estimates the amount of space separating the players of both teams [27]. This
can be measured by using the average distance between all players and their closest
opponent, being interpreted as the average radius of action free of opponents [27].
In the original study conducted in different SSG it were found no signiﬁcant
changes in the Teams’ Separateness between different formats of the game (3 vs. 3,
4 vs. 4 and 5 vs. 5) [27]. Such results did not conﬁrm the idea that the reduction of
relative space of player decreases the distance values to immediate opponent players.
Teams’ Separateness can be used by coaches to make decisions about which
formats of play and pitch size must be designed to ensure greater or smaller free
spaces without opponents. In speciﬁc circumstances such as in the last third of the
pitch or in the scoring box it is required to develop the capacity to play in small
spaces as best as possible. For these cases, the Teams’ Separateness will be smaller
and the coach may organize tasks that replicate such context. In the other hand, in the
ﬁrst third of the pitch there are more space to organize the circulation of the ball and

6.2 Teams’ Separateness
59
for that reason the free space is greater and coaches may use such values to adjust
training tasks according to the values of the Teams’ Separateness.
6.3
Directional Correlation Delay
6.3.1
Basic Concepts
The Directional Correlation Delay is the delay that exists between the movements
of a pair of players. It is calculated by selecting the delay where the correlation of
players from the pair is maximum, within a selected time interval.
Deﬁnition 6.3 [21] The Directional Correlation function (Cij(τ)) in a given period
of time, with a delay τ, between two players of a team, is calculated as follows:
Cij(τ) = ⟨−→
vi (t).−→
vj (t + τ)⟩,
(6.2)
where −→
vi (t) is the normalized velocity vector of player i in instant t, and −→
vj (t + τ) is
the normalized velocity vector of player j in instant t + τ. ⟨. . . ⟩represents an average
over time, for each instant t in that period of time.
Deﬁnition 6.4 The Directional Correlation delay (τ ∗
ij) in a given period of time is
determined by:
τ ∗
ij = arg max
τ∈[−w,w]
(Cij(τ))
(6.3)
where Cij(τ) is the Directional Correlation function and w is the number of seconds
of the player j that should be analyzed before and after the current instant.
Remark 6.1 In terms of implementation, the time interval was converted from con-
tinuous to discrete:
τ ∗
ij =
arg max
τ∈{−w,−w+ϵ,...,w−ϵ,w}
(Cij(τ))
(6.4)
using w = 1 and ϵ = 0.1.

in Table6.3. Empty cells represent invalid possibilities (diagonal of the table) or

Measuring the Tactical Behavior
6.3.3
General Interpretation
Directional Correlation Delay measures the delay between a movement and this
“copied” movement from another player. This measure comes from the study of
leaders in bird ﬂocks [21]. The pairwise comparison allows to measure the direc-
tional leader-follower network during the match. The delay can either be positive or
negative, with a positive delay meaning the ﬁrst player is the leader, the one who
performs the “original” movement, and a negative delay that it is the second player
who is the leader.
In the same team it is possible to verify which players are more engaged with
the teammates or with opponents and which ones act more independently of the
remaining players. This can be interesting to classify the individual proﬁle of players.
Some of players may have the proﬁle of leaders and others of followers.
This analysis can be determinant in youth teams to identify which teammates can
promote the organization of the team. Moreover, in the case of the sectors (defensive,
middle or forward) it is possible to identify the players that guide the colleagues in
defensive and attacking movements.
6.4
Intra-team Coordination Tendencies
6.4.1
Basic Concepts
The Intra-team Coordination Tendencies of a team can be calculated by the percent-
age of time spent in-phase between each pair of players, which can be calculated
through the relative phase between a pair of players on the same instant, which are
then clustered through the k-means method into three clusters: high synchronization,
intermediate synchronization and low synchronization.
Deﬁnition 6.5 [4] Given a time-series of length N, where each player has N posi-
tion tuples of their position on each measured time instant, denoted as xi, i =
0, 1, . . . , N −1, the Discrete Hilbert Transform (DHT) of this time-series, Hi, is
a sequence Hi, i = 0, 1, . . . , N −1 deﬁned by the following equation:
Hi =

2
N

ν=0,2,4... fνcoth(ν −i) π
N

2
N

ν=1,3,5... fνcoth(ν −i) π
N
if i is even,
(6.5)
where coth(α) is the hyperbolic cotangent.
Deﬁnition 6.6 [23] The relative phase between two signals, (t), is given by the
following formula:
(t) = arctan
H1(t)s2(t) −s1(t)H2(t)
s1(t)s2(t) −H1(t)H2(t)
	
,
(6.6)

6.4 Intra-team Coordination Tendencies
63
where si(t) is the signal i and Hi(t) its DHT.
Deﬁnition 6.7 [9] If the phase is between −30◦and 30◦, the signals are considered
to be in-phase. The total time period in-phase, , between a player pair is given
by the following equation:
 =
t
i=1
[i ∈{0, 1, . . . , t −1} : −30◦< (i) < 30◦].
(6.7)
Deﬁnition 6.8 The Intra-team Coordination Tendencies of a team is determined by:
ICT = 
t ∗100,
(6.8)
where t is the interval of time being analyzed.
Deﬁnition 6.9 [19] Given a set of player pairs and their in-phase time-periods,
the k-means clustering algorithm classiﬁes the Intra-Team Coordination Tendencies
between pairs. The following formula speciﬁes the objective of k-means clustering:
arg
min
k

i=1

x∈Si
||x −μi||2,
(6.9)
where Si are the sets formed by the clustering algorithm, and x the observations, in
this case, the  of the player pairs.
Remark 6.2 In this case, considering we have three clusters: high, intermediate and
low synchronization between players, k = 3.

−30◦and 30◦of relative phase was used to classify the sharing goals [9]. Intra-team
Coordination Tendencies are measured at lateral and longitudinal directions.
The study of Intra-Team Coordination performed in 20 professional players
revealed that central and lateral defenders were highly synchronized in lateral direc-
tion but little in longitudinal direction [9]. Speciﬁc clusters may emerge from context
and the sectors of the team may contribute to high dependency between teammates.
The coordination between sectors cannot be as high as intra-sector.
This measure can quantify the capacity of players to be coordinate in speciﬁc
moments of the match and to classify the dependency between teammates. The
intra-sector coordination in lateral or longitudinal displacement is highly important to
build a solid team. The Intra-team Coordination Tendencies can be used to measure a
capacity to move synchronously. Moreover, coaches can make decisions about which
formation and group of players may contribute to a higher level of synchronization.
6.5
Sectorial Lines
6.5.1
Basic Concepts
The Sectorial Lines are lines that represent the regions of action of each role: defend-
ers, midﬁelders and attackers. The line is the ﬁrst degree polynomial that minimizes
the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the polynomial and the players’ posi-
tions [5]. A line is deﬁned by the expression y = α + βx, which can be calculated
using a simple linear regression applied to the coordinates of the players performing
that role, given in Deﬁnition 6.10.

and β using the following equations:
β =

i=1(xi −x)(yi −y)
N
i=1(xi −x)2
(6.10)
α = y −βx,
(6.11)
where x is the average of the values of x, and similarly y is the average of the values
of y.
6.5.2
Real Life Examples
The distance between two Sectorial Lines was calculated by the differences of value
of x in the y position corresponding to the center of the ﬁeld, as illustrated in Fig.6.4.
The results obtained by Team A in the match are presented in Table6.9 with
intervals of 30s represented in Table6.10.
No results are presented for the teams in the SSG because this metric required the
existence of a ﬁxed role for each player, which is a ﬂexible feature in SSGs.

General Interpretation
The Sectorial Lines deﬁne the three main lines of a team [5]: (i) defensive; (ii) middle;
and (iii) forward. This measure allows to identify how close are the sectors of the
team and how coordinate they are. The original study veriﬁed that small values of
coordination were found between Sectorial Lines of the team [5].
This measure represents one of the main observations made by coaches in top view
analysis: the distance between ‘lines’. The lines are the lateral displacements of the
players from a sector (defensive, middle or forward). During defensive moments, the
lines must be close to avoid signiﬁcant spaces between them. Great spaces between
lines may allow the opponent team to penetrate with the ball and exploit the free
space to move forward.
Small values of distance between Sectorial Lines are expected in defensive
moments. On the other hand, the attacking moments will lead to a greater disper-
sion mainly between forward and middle line. Coaches can use the information of
the distance between lines to characterize the defensive efﬁcacy of the team during
matches and to develop tasks that promote similar spaces in training sessions.

Principal Axes of the Team
6.6.1
Basic Concepts
From the position data of a team’s players, the point cloud formed by the players’
positions in a time instant has two principal axes that can be calculated from the
eigenvectors of the point cloud. These axes can be calculated for the entire team, or
for each sector separately, using only position data of the players of a single sector.
Preposition 6.1
[1, 6] Given a symmetric real matrix, A ∈Rn×n:
1. all eigenvalues of A are real;
2. all eigenvectors of A are real;
3. if all eigenvalues of A are distinct, then their eigenvectors are orthogonal.
Deﬁnition 6.11
[1] Let A be a matrix of order n. The vector u ∈Rn\{0} is an
eigenvector of A if there exists a scalar λ such that:
Au = λu.
(6.12)
Then, λ is an eigenvalue of A associated to the eigenvector u.
Deﬁnition 6.12 [2, 8, 13, 15, 28] Given a time-series of length N containing the
positions of each player on every measured instant, the variance-covariance matrix
of the data, M ∈R2×2, can be described as follows:
M =

 var(x) cov(x, y)
cov(x, y) var(y)

,
(6.13)
where var(x) =
1
N−1
N
i=1(xi −x)2 and cov(x, y) =
1
N−1
N
i=1(xi −x)(yi −y).
If the nonzero eigenvalues of M are distinct, then the orthogonal eigenvectors of M
deﬁne the direction of the Principal Axes of the team, and the length of the Principal
Axes is given by the following equation:
Li =

λi × ||ui||, i = 1, 2.
(6.14)
Remark 6.3 In this case, the eigenvalues of M ∈R2×2 are found through the follow-
ing equation:
det(M −λI2) = 0,
(6.15)
where the λ ∈R are the eigenvalues of M and I2 ∈R2×2 is the identity matrix of
order 2.
From each different nonzero eigenvalue, λi ∈R, i = 1, 2, of M, the corresponding
eigenvector, ui ∈R2, i = 1, 2 is given as the solution of the following equation:
Mui = λiui.
(6.16)

6.6 Principal Axes of the Team

Remark 6.4 The distance between the center of the Principal axes of two teams can
be calculated as the Inter-team Distance, presented in Sect. 4.2.
6.6.2
Real Life Examples
A screenshot of a representation of the Inter-axes captured from the uPATO software
is displayed in Fig.6.5.
6.6.3
General Interpretation
A set of dots can have a center of gravity and its two Principal Axes [13]. In the
original articles that proposed this measure, the aim was to classify the positioning
of defense considering the opponent’s team [13, 18]. The oscillation of both axes
may represent the notion of ’block’ or ’in pursuit’ for the defense [12, 18]. The
orientation of the axes indicates the direction of greater variance of position of the
players of the team. This is better exempliﬁed in Fig. 6.6, where the two axes point
towards the direction of greater variance of the data. the length of the axes is double
the length of the component vector calculated through 6.14, with L being the length
of each extremity to the intersection point.
In the case of no classiﬁcation of attack or defense, this measure can be readjusted
to classify the interactions between Sectorial Lines.

axes visible for both teams in the example SSG

Measuring the Tactical Behavior
Fig. 6.6 Example scheme of the Principal Axes of a point cloud. The largest axis points towards
the direction of the greater dispersion of data, while the second axis is orthogonal to the ﬁrst, and
points towards the second largest dispersion
Moreover, Principal Axes can be also analyzed by sectors. It can be possible
to identify the variation of distances between the intersection of the defensive and
attacking axes of both teams or between middle axes. This may provide useful infor-
mation to identify the behavior of the lines in speciﬁc situations. Some teams will
opt to approximate the forward line to the opponent’s defensive line, while others
will try to be far to gain some space. The relationship between middle axes will also
be important to understand the dynamic in attacking and defensive moments.

Dominant Region
6.7.1
Basic Concepts
The playing ﬁeld is divided in length × width squares, where each square has 1m2
of area. Each square is attributed to the player with the least euclidean distance to it.
The set of squares belonging to a player deﬁne their Dominant Region.
Deﬁnition 6.13 [24] Given a time-series of length N containing the positions of each
player on every measured instant, and dividing the ﬁeld of play in length × width

squares, the Dominant Region of a player p on instant t is given by the following
equation:
DRp(t) =

,
(6.17)
in which d(si,j, k) =

(xsi,j −poskx(t))2 + (ysi,j −posky(t))2, and where s is the set
of all squares that make up the ﬁeld of play, si,j the square on position (i, j) of the
ﬁeld, and (poskx, posky) the position of player k.
Deﬁnition 6.14 [24] Given a set of N squares, deﬁning the Dominant Region of a
player, the area of the Dominant Region is given by:
DMArea =

Deﬁnition 6.15 [24] Given a set of Dominant Region areas, DMa, containing the
different Dominant Region areas of each player of a team, the area of the Dominant
Region of a team is given by:
DMteam =
Nplayers

Real Life Examples

No results are presented for the match because this metric required the existence
of data from both teams, which is not available in the evaluated match.
6.7.3
General Interpretation
The Voronoi region can be used to classify the spatial territory of a player [29].
This measure allows to quantify the spatial partitioning of the pitch area into cells,
each associated with players according to their positions [11]. The cells result from
applying the concept of nearest-neighbor rule in which each player is associated
to all parts of the pitch that are nearer to that player than to any other player [11,

comparing the spatial pattern formed by the players and the oscillations of spatial
occupation of players in speciﬁc moments of the game [10].
Moreover, the observation of individual spatial regions can characterize the capac-
ity and dominance of players during the match and quantify the zones of inﬂuence

73
of each player. The collective measure may also determine the territorial inﬂuence
of the team during the game and to monitor which zones are more controlled by a
team. This measure can help to classify the patterns of spatial occupation of teams
and more speciﬁcally of players.
6.8
Major Ranges
6.8.1
Basic Concepts
The Major Range of each player is deﬁned as an ellipse centered on its average
position, with its axes deﬁned as the standard deviation of the player’s movement.
Deﬁnition 6.16 [31] Given a time-series of length N containing the positions of
each player on every measured instant, the Major Ranges of the team are the ellipses
deﬁned, for each player of the team, by the following equation:
(x −x)2
σ2x
+ (y −y)2
σ2y
= 1,
(6.20)
where (x, y) is the average position of a player during the time-series and σ represents
the standard deviation of the player’s position during the time series.

General Interpretation
The Major Ranges approach was introduced in a soccer case study [31]. This measure
contributes to assess the division of labor between players in a team [7]. As described
by Duarte et al. [7] “the predominant area of each individual’s interventions during
performance is deﬁned by an ellipse centered at the 2-dimensional mean location of
each performer, with semi-axes being the standard deviations in X and Y directions,
respectively”.
This measure represents the range of a player during different periods of the
match and may provide important information about variations of spatial occupation
in different scenarios. It can be also assessed the coordination between teammates
during the performance and identify if the patterns of spread or contract may be
associated between playing roles. Task constraints (e.g., opponents, goal, match
status, possession of the ball) may inﬂuence the variations of Major Ranges in the
players. The variation of the ellipses in longitudinal or lateral axes may also indicate
some patterns to explore different playing styles in defensive and attacking phases.
In attacking moments, an ellipse with prominence in longitudinal axis may indicate
a tendency to exploit the direct playing style. In the other hand, a higher range in
lateral axis may indicate that the team varies the zone of play by using circulation
of the ball. The variation of the ellipse in different periods of the match can be also
useful to identify how team’s behave over the match in their playing style.

Identify Team’s Formations
6.9.1
Basic Concepts
From the position data of a team’s players, and taking into account the roles deﬁned
for each player initially, by taking the average position of a player on a given role,
and forming a cost matrix based on the distance of a player to a role, the Hungarian
Method can be applied to ﬁnd the minimum cost for attributing each role to a player,
based on its current position.

76
6
Measuring the Tactical Behavior
Deﬁnition 6.17 [3] Given a time-series of length N containing the positions of each
player on every measured instant, the cost matrix of a player occupying each role, in
each instant, can be calculated as follows:
CM =
⎡
⎢⎣
d(pos1, posp1) ... d(pos1, pospk)
...
...
...
d(posi, posp1) ... d(posi, pospk)
⎤
⎥⎦,
(6.21)
where d(p, q) represents the euclidean distance between two points, p and q, and
posi represents the average position of the player associated with role i, and pospk
represents the position of player k in an instant.
Deﬁnition 6.18 [3, 17] Given a cost matrix CM, the minimum cost for each player
occupying a speciﬁc position p can be given by the following algorithm:
Algorithm 3: Hungarian Method to ﬁnd the minimum cost for assigning of each
player to each position.
Subtract the smallest entry in each row from all the entries of its row.
1
Subtract the smallest entry in each column from all the entries of its column.
2
Draw lines through appropriate rows and columns so that all the zero entries of the cost
3
matrix are covered and the minimum number of such lines is used.
Test for Optimality:(i) If the minimum number of covering lines is n, an optimal assignment
4
of zeros is possible and the algorithm is ﬁnished. (ii) If the minimum number of covering
lines is less than n, an optimal assignment of zeros is not yet possible. In that case, proceed
to Step 5.
Determine the smallest entry not covered by any line. Subtract this entry from each
5
uncovered row, and then add it to each covered column. Return to Step 3.
6.9.2
Real Life Examples
The results obtained by Team A in the match are presented in Table6.15 with intervals
of 0.1s.
6.9.3
General Interpretation
The aim of team’s formation is to classify the regular playing position of players in
speciﬁc periods or moments of the match [14]. An approach on soccer preprocessed
the trajectories of players and segmented the positions into game phases [3, 30].
Another approach was made in ﬁeld hockey [20].
This measure can be used to visualize the most recurrent position of players in
periods of the match and based on the status of possession. Moreover, coaches can

use this information to classify the formation of the team and the variations that
emerge during the match. The opponents can be also classiﬁed by this measure,
thus providing information about the spatial mean spatial territory of players and
the numeric relationship by sectors. However, it is important to highlight that this
measure only represents a static position and other dynamic measures must be used
to identify the territory and the typical movements of the players.
