Project 2010 For Dummies

Introduction
P
roject management probably started back when a few cave dwellers got 
together and figured out how to work as a team to bag a wooly mam-
moth for their Sunday dinner. Some fellow — I’ll call him Ogg — probably 
took the lead as the very first project manager. He drew things in the dirt 
with a stick to help his team members understand the strategy of the hunt, 
and communicated with them in ughs and grunts. Unlike you, he had no boss 
to report to, no budget, and no deadlines (lucky Ogg), but the fundamental 
spirit of a project was there.
Over the years, project management has evolved as a discipline that involves 
sophisticated analyses and techniques, projections, tracking of time and 
money, and reporting. Project management software — which has been 
around only about 25 years or so — has brought a new face and functionality 
to project management that would have left our friend Ogg ughless.
About This Book
Microsoft Office Project 2010, the most recent incarnation of the world’s 
most popular project management software, offers a tremendous wealth of 
functionality to users. However, it’s probably not like any other software 
you’ve ever used, so mastering it can seem a daunting process. One trick is 
to understand how its features relate to what you do every day as a project 
manager. Another is to get someone like me to tell you all about its features 
and how to use them.
In Microsoft Office Project 2010 For Dummies, my goal is to help you explore 
all that Project offers, providing information on relevant project manage-
ment concepts while also offering specific procedures to build and track your 
Project plans. But more importantly, I offer advice on how to make all these 
features and procedures mesh with what you already know as a project man-
ager to make the transition easier.
Foolish Assumptions
I’ve made some assumptions about you, gentle reader. I figure that you 
are computer literate and know how to use a mouse, a keyboard, software 
menus, and toolbars. I assume that you know how to use most common 

2
Project 2010 For Dummies 
Windows functions (such as the Clipboard) as well as many basic software 
functions (such as selecting text and dragging and dropping things with your 
mouse).
I do not assume that you’ve used Project or any other project management 
software before. If you’re new to Project, you’ll find what you need to get 
up to speed, including information on how Project works, finding your way 
around Project’s interface, and building your first Project plan. If you’ve used 
an earlier version of Project, you’ll find out about Project 2010 and all the 
new features it provides.
Conventions Used in This Book
I should explain a few odds and ends to make using this book easier:
 
✓ Web site addresses, known as URLs, are shown in monofont, like this: 
www.microsoft.com.
 
✓ Ribbon commands are given in the order in which you select the tab and 
command (without the group), for example, “Choose Project➪Project 
Information.” (For more on Project’s new Ribbon, see Chapter 2.)
 
✓ Options in dialog boxes use initial caps even if they aren’t capitalized on 
your screen to make it easier to identify them in sentences. For example, 
what appears as Show summary tasks in the Options dialog box will 
appear as Show Summary Tasks in this book.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is designed to help you begin to use Microsoft Office Project 2010 
to plan, build, and track progress on projects, keeping in mind tried-and-true 
project management practices and principles. I divided the book into logical 
parts that follow the process of building and tracking a typical project plan.
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project
Part I explains what Project 2010 can do for you as well as what types of 
input you have to provide to use it successfully on your projects. You’ll get 
your first glimpse of Project views and discover how to navigate around 
them. You’ll begin to build Project plans by making calendar settings, build-
ing a task outline, and then entering timing and timing relationships for those 
tasks.

3
 Introduction
Part II: People Who Need People
Part II is the Project resources section: You discover all you need to know 
about creating and assigning work resources, material resources, and fixed 
costs to tasks in a project. You also discover how using resources on your 
project relates to the costs you accrue over time.
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper . . .
Up to now, you’ve been mapping out your project plan. Now it’s time to see 
whether that plan meets your needs in terms of budget and timing. Project 
offers a whole toolbox to help you modify resource assignments and task 
timing to trim your costs and meet your deadlines so that you can finalize 
your plan. You also get briefed on how to modify the format of items in your 
project to make your plan look as polished as possible, both on-screen and in 
print.
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: 
Staying on Track
As any experienced project manager knows, projects just about never 
happen the way you thought they would. In this part, you save a picture of 
your plan — a baseline — and then begin to track actual activity against your 
plan. You also take a look at methods of reporting your progress, and how to 
get back on track when you find yourself derailed. In the final chapter, I pro-
vide advice on how to use what you glean from your projects to make better 
planning choices going forward.
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects
With all that Project Professional has to offer the enterprise via its Project 
Server and Project Web App (also called Project Web Application; formerly 
called Project Web Access) functionalities and SharePoint online services, 
you can share documents online with your project team, have team members 
report their work time, and even integrate Project information with Outlook. 
This part shows you the basics of what Project Server can do, and how to use 
Project Web App from both the managers’ and users’ perspective.

Project 2010 For Dummies 
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Ten seems to be a handy number of items for humans to put into lists, so 
this part gives you two such lists: Ten Golden Rules of Project Management 
and Ten Project Management Software Products to Explore. The first of these 
chapters tells you about some dos and don’ts that can save you a lot of grief 
when you’re using Project for the first time (or the fifth time, for that matter). 
The second offers a look at some add-on products and complementary soft-
ware products that bring even more functionality to Microsoft Office Project.
What You’re Not to Read
First, you don’t have to read this book from front to back unless you really 
want to. If you want to just get information about a certain topic, you can 
open this book to any chapter and get the information you need.
That said, I have structured the book to move from some basic concepts that 
equip you to understand how Project works through the steps involved in 
building a typical project. If you have an overpowering need to find out the 
whole shebang, you can start at the beginning and work your way through 
the book to build your first Project plan.
Icons Used in This Book
One picture is worth . . . well, you know. That’s why For Dummies books use 
icons to give you a visual clue as to what’s going on. Essentially, icons call 
your attention to bits of special information that may very well make your life 
easier. Following are the icons used in this book.
 
Remember icons signal either a pertinent fact that relates to what you’re read-
ing at the time (but is also mentioned elsewhere in the book) or a reiteration 
of a particularly important piece of information that’s, well, worth repeating.
 
Tips are the advice columns of computer books: They offer sage advice, a bit 
more information about a topic under discussion that may be of interest, or 
ways to do things a bit more efficiently.

5
 Introduction
 
Warning icons spell trouble with a capital T: When you see a warning, read it. 
If you’re not careful, you might do something at this point that could cause 
disaster.
Where to Go from Here
It’s time to take what you’ve learned in the project management school of 
hard knocks and jump into the world of Microsoft Office Project 2010. When 
you do, you’ll be rewarded with a wealth of tools and information that help 
you to manage your projects much more efficiently.
Here’s where you step out of the world of cave-dweller project management 
and into the brave, new world of Microsoft Office Project 2010.
This book is accompanied by a companion Web site filled with project man-
agement goodies, including links to project management add-on software 
and some example Microsoft Project files that you can experiment with. To 
access this book’s Web site, point your Web browser to www.dummies.com/

W
elcome to the world of computerized project management with 
Microsoft Project. If you’ve never used project management software, 
you’re entering a brave, new world. It’s like walking from the office of 25 
years ago — with no fax, voicemail, or e-mail — into the office of today with 
its wealth of high-tech devices.
Everything you used to do with handwritten to-do lists, word processors, and 
spreadsheets all magically comes together in Project. However, this transi-
tion won’t come in a moment, and you need a basic understanding of what 
project management software can do to get you up to speed. If you’ve used 
previous versions of Project, this little overview can help you refresh your 
memory as well as ease you into a few of the new features of Project 2010.
So, even if you’re a seasoned project manager, take a minute to review this 
chapter. It provides the foundation for how you’ll work with Project from 
here on.

10
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
The ABCs of Project Management
You probably handle projects day in and day out. Some are obvious, because 
your boss named them so that any fool would know that they’re projects: 
the Acme Drilling Project or the Network Expansion IT Project, for exam-
ple. Others are less obvious, such as that speech thing you have to do on 
Saturday for your professional association or washing the dog.
If you need to organize a company holiday party, it’s a project. If you were 
handed a three-year Earth-exploration initiative to find oil in Iowa, coordinate 
subcontractors and government permits, and work with a team of 300 people, 
that’s definitely a project. Yes, even that speech you have to present is a 
project because it has certain characteristics.
Understanding what your projects, large or small, have in common is the 
basis of understanding what Project can do for you. All projects have
 
✓ An overall goal and unique deliverables
 
✓ A project manager
 
✓ Individual tasks to be performed between a specific starting point and 
ending point
 
✓ Timing for those tasks to be completed (such as three hours, three days, 
or three months)
 
✓ Timing relationships between those tasks (for example, you can’t put a 
new manufacturing process in place until you train people in how to use 
the process)
 
✓ Resources (people, equipment, facilities, and supplies, for example) to 
accomplish the work
 
✓ A budget (the costs associated with those people, equipment, facilities, 
and supplies)
Project management is simply the process of managing all the elements of a 
project, whether that project is large or small.
The three Ts: Tasks, timing, and 
dependencies (well, two Ts and a D)
As Lewis Carroll said, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will 
get you there.” So, first things first: You have to understand the goal of your 
project so that you can begin to build the tasks that have to be performed to 
get you there.

11
 Chapter 1: Project Management: What It Is, and Why You Should Care
A task is simply one of those items you used to scribble on your handwritten 
to-do lists, such as Write final report or Apply for permits. Tasks are typically 
organized into phases (appropriate stages) in Project, arranged in an outline-
like structure, as you can see in the project shown in Figure 1-1. Because 
timing is essential in any project, Project helps you set up and view the 
timing relationships among tasks.
 
Figure 1-1: 
You’ll prob-
ably spend 
most of 
your time in 
Project in 
outline-like 
Gantt Chart 
view.
 
Becoming a task master
A task can be as broad or as detailed as you like. For example, you can create 
a single task to research your competition, or you can create a project phase 
that consists of a summary task and subtasks below it. For example, the sum-
mary task may be Competitive Research, with the subtasks Researching 
Online Business Databases, Assembling Company Annual Reports, and 
Reviewing Competitive Product Lines.
 
Adding tasks to a Project file doesn’t cost you a thing (except a nanobit of 
memory), so a project can have as many tasks and as many phases as you like. 
You simply use the outlining structure in Project to indent various levels of 
tasks. The more deeply indented in an outline a task is, the more detailed the 
task.

12
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
One handy thing about this outlining structure is that you can roll up all the 
timing and cost data from the subtasks within your phases into summary-
level tasks. Three sequential subtasks that take a day each to complete and 
cost you $200 apiece result in a summary task that spans three days and 
costs $600. You can view your project at various levels of detail or get auto-
matic tallies of timing and costs if you prefer to simply view the summary 
level of tasks.
 
For more about defining and creating tasks, check out Chapter 4.
All in the timing
They say that timing is everything: Rome wasn’t built in a day, a stitch in time 
saves nine, and don’t even ask me about how long it takes to get to retire-
ment. The importance of timing applies to Project tasks, too. Almost all tasks 
have timing — referred to as duration — which is the amount of time needed 
to complete the task.
The only tasks without duration are milestones. A milestone — in most 
cases — is a task of zero duration. In essence, it simply marks a moment in 
time that must be reflected in your Project outline. Typical milestones are the 
approval of a brochure design and flipping the switch to start up an assembly 
line. Such tasks don’t involve any real work or effort, but they must be com-
pleted for the project to move ahead.
 
Project doesn’t provide magic formulas for duration: You assign duration 
based on your own experience and judgment. Does designing a product pack-
age take three days or three weeks? Will obtaining a building permit happen 
in a day or a month? (Remember that you’re dealing with city hall, so think 
before you answer!) Project isn’t an oracle: You have to provide facts, figures, 
and educated guesses to build your Project schedule. After that information is 
entered, though, Project can do some wonderful things to help you maintain 
your schedule and monitor your progress.
Task dependencies
The final piece in the puzzle of how long your project will take is the concept 
of dependencies, or the timing relationships among tasks. If you have a sched-
ule that includes ten tasks that all begin at the same time, your entire project 
will take as long as the longest task (see Figure 1-2).
After you define and implement timing relationships among tasks, your 
schedule can stretch over time like a long rubber band. For example, one 
task may begin only after another is finished. Another task can start halfway 
through the preceding task. The second task cannot start until a week after 
the first task is finished. Only after you start to assign these relationships can 
you begin to see a project’s timing as related to not just each task’s duration 
but also the specific ways in which the tasks relate to each other.

13
 Chapter 1: Project Management: What It Is, and Why You Should Care
 
Figure 1-2: 
This sched-
ule includes 
tasks with 
timing but 
no depen-
dencies.
 
Here are some examples of dependencies:
 
✓ You can’t begin to use a new piece of equipment until you install it.
 
✓ You must wait for a freshly poured concrete foundation to dry before 
you can begin to build on it.
 
✓ You can’t start to ship a new drug product until the FDA approves it.
Figure 1-3 shows a project plan where each task’s duration and the depen-
dencies among tasks have been established, enabling Project to calculate the 
resulting overall timing of the project.
One other brief note about the timing of tasks: In addition to applying depen-
dencies to tasks, you can apply constraints. For example, say that you don’t 
want to start shipping your new cake flavor until you get the ad for it in your 
holiday catalog, so you set a dependency between those two events. You can 
also set a constraint that says that you must start producing the cakes no 
later than November 3. In this case, if you don’t make the catalog deadline, 
the product will still ship on November 3; that task will not be allowed to slip 
its constraint because of this dependency relationship.

14
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 1-3: 
This sched-
ule includes 
tasks with 
both timing 
and depen-
dencies.
 
You can find out more about constraints in Chapter 4 and about the fine art 
of managing dependencies in Chapter 6.
Lining up your resources
When people first use Project, some get a bit confused about resources. 
Resources aren’t just people: A resource can be a piece of equipment you 
rent, a meeting room that you have to pay an hourly fee to use, or a box of 
nails or a software program you have to buy.
Project allows three kinds of resources: work resources, material resources, 
and cost resources. A work resource is charged by how many hours or days 
the resource (often human) works on a task. A material resource, such as 
sewing supplies or steel, is charged by a per-use cost or by a unit of measure-
ment (such as square yards or linear feet or tons). A cost resource has a spe-
cific cost each time you use it. That may vary from task to task. For example, 
a professional conference pass for one event may be $250, and a pass for the 
next conference may be $500. This cost doesn’t vary by how much time you 
spend at the conference, but it may vary depending on other external factors. 
So you can create a resource named Conference Pass and assign it to differ-
ent tasks at different amounts.

15
 Chapter 1: Project Management: What It Is, and Why You Should Care
Some resources, such as people, perform their work according to a working 
calendar. If a person works an 8-hour day and you assign him to a task that 
takes 24 hours to complete, that person has to put in three workdays to com-
plete the task. In comparison, someone with a 12-hour workday takes only 
two days to complete the same task. In addition, you can set working and 
nonworking days for your human resources, which accommodates variations 
such as 4-day weeks or shift work.
 
You can set different rates for resources, such as a standard hourly rate. 
Project applies the appropriate rate based on each resource’s calendar and 
work assigned. For more about resources and costs, see Chapter 7.
Several views in Project let you see information about resources and how 
their assignments to tasks have an effect on project costs. Figure 1-4 shows 
you the Resource sheet, which has columns of information about resources 
and their costs.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Resources 
charged at 
a rate per 
hour are the 
basis of how 
Project tal-
lies costs.
 
 
Here’s one other important thing you should know about resources: They 
tend to have conflicts. No, I’m not talking about conference room brawls 
(although that happens). These conflicts have to do with assigned resources 
that become overallocated for their available work time. For example, if you 
assign one poor soul to three 8-hour tasks that must all happen on the same 

16
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
day — and in the same eight hours — Project has features that do everything 
but jump up on your desk and set off an alarm to warn you of the conflict. 
(Luckily, Project also provides tools that help you resolve those conflicts.)
Spreading the news
I’m one of those people who need instant gratification. One of the first things 
I ask about learning how to use any new software product is, “What’s in it for 
me?” Until now, I’ve told you about the type of information you have to put 
into Project: information about tasks, task dependencies, and resources. But 
isn’t it about time you got something back from Project? Of course it is.
You finally reached one of the big payoffs for entering all that information: 
reporting. After you enter your information, Project offers a wealth of viewing 
and reporting options to help you review your project and communicate your 
progress to your project team, clients, and management.
You can generate predesigned reports based on information in your sched-
ule or simply print any of the views you can display in Project. Project 2010 
offers a set of basic reports and visual reports. Figures 1-5 and 1-6 show you 
just two of the reporting options available in Project.

Planning to keep things on track
Projects aren’t frozen in amber like some organizational mosquito: They go 
through more changes than a politician’s platform in a campaign year. That’s 
where Project’s capability to make changes to your project data comes in 
handy.
After you build all your tasks, give them durations and dependencies, and 
assign all your resources and costs, you set a baseline. A baseline is a snap-
shot of your project at the moment you feel your plan is final, you’ve gotten 
all the required approvals, and you’re ready to proceed with the project. 
After you set a baseline, you record some activity on your tasks. Then you 
can compare that actual activity with your baseline because Project saves 
both sets of data in your schedule.
Tracking activity in your project involves recording the actual timing of tasks 
and recording the time that your resources have spent on those tasks, as well 
as recording actual costs. You can then display Project views that show you 
how far off you are at any time (compared with your baseline) in terms of the 
actual timing of tasks and the cost of your project.

18
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Whether you have good news or bad, you can use reports to show your boss 
how things are going compared with how you thought they would go. Then, 
after you peel your boss off the ceiling, you can use many more Project tools 
to make adjustments to get everything back on track.
The Role of the Project Manager
Although understanding the role (let alone the usefulness) of some manag-
ers isn’t always easy, it’s always easy to spot the value of a project manager. 
This person creates the master plan for a project and tries to ensure that it 
gets implemented successfully. Along the way, this key person uses skills and 
methods that have evolved over time, always seeking to manage how things 
get done and generally keeping schedules on track.
 
A real pro project manager may have a degree in project management or 
a professional certification. For example, if you see the initials PMP beside 
someone’s name, that person has achieved the Project Management 
Professional certification from the Project Management Institute, the leading 
global organization establishing project management standards and creden-
tials and offering educational and other resources in the field.
What exactly does a project manager do?
A project manager isn’t always the highest authority in a project; often that 
role belongs to whomever manages the project manager, up to and including 
members of senior management. Rather, the project manager is the person 
on the front lines who makes sure that the parts of the project come together 
and assumes hands-on responsibility for successes as well as failures.
 
In project management parlance, the person who champions (and has the ulti-
mate responsibility for) a project is the project sponsor.
A project manager manages these essential pieces of a project:
 
✓ The project plan or schedule: This is what you create with Microsoft 
Project. It includes the estimated steps and associated timing and costs 
involved in reaching the project goal.
 
✓ Resources: Managing resources involves resolving resource conflicts 
and building consensus as well as assigning resources and tracking their 
activities on the project. This part of the job also involves managing 
nonhuman resources, such as materials and equipment.
 
✓ Communication with the project team, management, and customers: 
Communicating the project’s status to everyone who has a legitimate 
stake in its success (stakeholders) is a key responsibility.

19
 Chapter 1: Project Management: What It Is, and Why You Should Care
 
Although a project manager may work for a project sponsor, the project often 
also has a customer for whom the end product is produced. That customer can 
be outside the project manager’s own company, or within.
Understanding the dreaded 
triple constraint
You’ve seen the signs at the copy store or the auto repair place: You can 
have it fast, cheap, or done well; pick two. That, my friend, is the triple con-
straint of project management in a nutshell.
In a project, you have timing, resources (which are essentially costs), 
and quality of the product or service produced at the end of the project. 
Microsoft Project helps you manage the resources and timing of your project. 
The quality of your project is often affected directly by how well you manage 
them. If you add time, costs increase because resources are working longer 
hours at a certain wage. If you take away resources, you save money, but this 
can affect quality — and so on.
Coming to a logical balance of time, money, and quality is at the core of what 
a good project manager does throughout the life of a project.
Applying tried-and-true methodologies
Microsoft Project incorporates some scheduling and tracking tools that are 
the result of many years of developing project management methods. A few 
of these are worth noting:
 
✓ The Gantt chart (shown in Gantt Chart view of Figure 1-7), which is the 
main view of Project, shows you a spreadsheet with columns of data along 
with a graphical representation of the tasks in the project arranged along 
a horizontal timeline. By reviewing the data in the columns (such as task 
name, start date, finish date, and resources assigned to tasks), you can 
understand the parameters of each task and see its timing in the graphical 
area. Being able to view all this information on one page helps you under-
stand what’s happening in your project in terms of time and costs.
 
✓ The Network Diagram (also called a logic diagram), shown in Figure 
1-8, is essentially the Microsoft version of a PERT chart. PERT (Program 
Evaluation and Review Technique) was developed during the construc-
tion of the Polaris submarine in the 1950s. This mostly graphical represen-
tation of the tasks in your project reflects the flow of work in your project 
rather than the literal timing of tasks. This view helps you to see how 
one task flows into another and to get a sense of where you are — not so 
much in time, but rather in terms of the work you have to accomplish.

 Chapter 1: Project Management: What It Is, and Why You Should Care
 
✓ Risk management is a central part of project management because, 
frankly, projects are chock-full of risk. You run the risk that your 
resources won’t perform, that materials will arrive late, that your cus-
tomer will change all the parameters of the project halfway through — 
well, you get the picture.
 
 Risk management is the art of anticipating risks, ranking them from most 
to least likely, and determining strategies to prevent the most likely ones 
from occurring. Project helps you with risk management by allowing 
you to try out what-if scenarios: You can change the start date or length 
of a task or phase of tasks (for example) and see just what that change 
does to your schedule, such as the delays, cost overruns, and resource 
conflicts that might occur in such a scenario, down to the last hour and 
penny. Having this kind of information at your fingertips makes risk man-
agement easier and (almost) painless.
 
✓ Resource management consists of using resources wisely. A good project 
manager finds the right resource for the job, assigns that person a reason-
able workload, stays alert for shifts in the schedule that cause that resource 
to be overbooked, and during the life of the project makes adjustments that 
keep all resources most productive. In Project, tools are available, such as 
a resource graph (traditionally called a histogram) and the resource usage 
chart (shown in Figure 1-9), which reflects resource workload.

22
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
 Figure 1-9 also shows an exclamation point icon (indicator) that tells you 
that one resource needs help, which might involve using resource level-
ing, a calculation that automatically reschedules resources to resolve 
overbooking. Resource leveling can enable you to manage resources 
much more effectively. You can see how overbooked the PR Manager is 
on two dates.
 
You can use codes for resources that designate skill levels or abilities so that 
finding the right resource for each job is as simple as performing a search.
From To-Do List to Hard Drive
If you’re reading from start to finish in this chapter, you’re probably shaking 
your head and saying, “Boy, handwritten to-do lists look pretty good right 
now. Beats creating hundreds of tasks, assigning them durations, establishing 
dependencies among them, creating resources, entering resource calendar 
and rate information, assigning resources and costs to tasks, entering activity 
performed on tasks . . .” and so on.
Well, you’re right and wrong about that. You do have to enter a lot of infor-
mation into Project to get the benefit of its features. But you can also get a lot 
out of Project.
Getting up to speed with Project
Take a moment to look at some of the wonderful things Project can do for 
you. This list describes why you (or your company) bought it and why you’re 
investing your time to read this book.
With Project, you enjoy the following benefits:
 
✓ Project automatically calculates costs and timing for you based on your 
input. You can quickly recalculate what-if scenarios to solve resource 
conflicts, get your costs within budget, or meet your final deadline.
 
✓ Project offers views and reports that, with the click of a button, make a 
wealth of information available to you and those you report to. You no 
longer have to manually build a report on total costs to date to meet a 
last-minute request from your boss. If she wants to know total costs to 
date, you can just print your Tracking Gantt view with the Cost table dis-
played or print the Budget report. See Chapter 16 for information about 
reporting.

 Chapter 1: Project Management: What It Is, and Why You Should Care
 
✓ You can use built-in templates to get a head start on your project. 
Project templates are prebuilt plans for a typical business project, such 
as commercial construction, an engineering project, a new product roll-
out, software development, or an office move. See the section “Starting 
with templates,” later in this chapter, for more about this time-saving 
feature.
 
 You likely do similar types of projects all the time. After you create one 
project, you use it as a template for future projects.
 
✓ You can create resources for your project according to information you 
already created in your Outlook Address Book. You can even create 
one set of company resources and give access to every project manager 
in the company (see Chapters 18 and 19 for how to set up centralized 
enterprise resources).
 
✓ A number of tools in Project use complex algorithms (that you couldn’t 
even begin to figure out) to do such tasks as level resource assignments 
to solve resource conflicts, filter tasks by various criteria, model what-if 
scenarios, and calculate in dollars the value of work performed to date.
Collaborating with your 
project team online
You can take advantage of all the Internet has to offer by using Project 
features to collaborate with others. In fact, Project is part of the world of 
Enterprise Project Management (EPM), where easily sharing ideas, informa-
tion, and documents across your enterprise becomes possible.
For example, Project allows you to e-mail a project plan to team members 
and others, either as a Project file or as PDF document. You can post docu-
ments to online server locations and ask for team input.
The Professional version of Project offers the ability to work with Project 
Server and Project Web App (also called Project Web Application; formerly 
known as Project Web Access), which enhance workgroup collaboration. 
You can take advantage of an online project center and resource center with 
areas for discussions, progress tracking, document exchange, and more.
 
Part V of this book, “Working with Enterprise Projects,” looks at how to 
take advantage of the enterprise-wide features of Project Server and Project 
Web App.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Getting Started
As Shakespeare said, “In delay there lies no plenty.” I don’t know about 
you, but I need all the plenty I can get, so it’s time to jump in and start using 
Project.
You have two choices when starting a new project. You can build a project 
from scratch by entering individual task and resource details, or you can use 
a project template that already contains data related to your industry or the 
type of project you’re doing.
Starting from scratch
When you open Project 2010, you see a blank project file on-screen. You can 
start building your new project directly in this blank schedule. Starting to 
create a new project usually involves entering some general project informa-
tion and then adding some task information.
 
You can open a new, blank project schedule at any time by choosing File➪
New, clicking the Blank Project icon under Available Templates, and then 
clicking Create. (The File tab is located in the upper-left corner of the Project 
screen.)
 
You need to enter much more information in addition to general project infor-
mation and tasks to build a complete project, as you discover in the next few 
chapters. Entering general project information and task information is your 
usual starting point, however.
Tell Project about your project
With a blank project open, a logical first step is to enter some general project 
information, such as the project start date. To do so, click the Project tab on 
the Ribbon and click Project Information in the Properties group. (You find 
out more about the Ribbon in the next chapter.) The Project Information 
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-10.
Here’s what you can do in this dialog box:
 
✓ Set the start date for the project. Good project managers always plan in 
advance. If you’re not sure when the project will start, set the start date 
about a month from today. Then, after you build some tasks and have 
a better handle on the entire length of your project, you can come back 
and set a real start date. Project automatically recalculates dates for all 
tasks with dependencies when you do.

25
 Chapter 1: Project Management: What It Is, and Why You Should Care
 
Figure 1-10: 
Use the 
Project 
Information 
dialog box 
for some 
basic proj-
ect settings.
 
 
✓ Set the finish date for the project. Especially if you have a drop-dead 
date (an attention-getting term!) beyond which the project cannot 
wander and still reach on-time completion, you can set the finish date. In 
such a case, be sure to look at the next setting in this list — and change 
it accordingly.
 
✓ Schedule from the start or finish of the project. Most projects work 
forward from the start date. However, if you have an absolute drop-
dead date for the end of your project (for example, if you’re organizing 
a sports event that must occur on New Year’s Day next year), you may 
want to set the finish date and then work backward to fit all your tasks 
into the allotted length of time. (Because under certain circumstances 
this method schedules tasks as late as possible, it can be tricky to use 
it and get an accurate schedule.) If you change this setting to Project 
Finish Date, the Finish Date field becomes available.
 
✓ Set the current date. Project can fill in the current date according to 
your computer calendar. Or, you can choose another date if you like, 
but that usually doesn’t make much sense unless you’re in a different 
time zone from where the project will occur.
 
✓ Set a status date. By default, no status date is set for the project. You 
use a status date when you’re tracking the progress of your project at 
regular intervals. If you set a status date, your computer assumes that 
any activity you record in your project is being tracked as of this date. 
(This is particularly important to ensure Project accurately calculates 
some values, such as the ultra-wonky earned value, a statistic I explain 
to you in Chapter 14.) You can find out more about this feature in 
Chapters 12, 13, and 14.

26
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
✓ Set the working calendar for your project. You have three default 
choices: Standard, Night Shift, and 24 Hours. Base your choice on the 
working habits of your organization. For example, if your company uses 
resources in three shifts per day — a total of 24 hours of straight work-
ing time — and all those shifts would contribute work to your project, 
choose 24 Hours. If you use a day shift and a night shift, choose Night 
Shift. If you work a standard 8-hour day, choose Standard. (Most proj-
ects use a standard calendar with a typical 8-hour workday.)
 
 Calendars can get a little confusing. A project calendar that you set in 
this dialog box indicates what the usual workday is like in your com-
pany, but you can set up individual calendars for each resource you 
create. You can then more easily accommodate both shift workers 
and nine-to-fivers in the same schedule. See Chapter 3 for more about 
resource calendars.
 
✓ Assign a priority to your project. Assigning a priority (such as 500 
for high priority or 100 for a lower priority) can be especially useful if 
you use the same resources across several projects. With your priori-
ties set on all projects, Project tools can then automatically reallocate 
resources.
 
You can also create custom project information fields for your organization in 
the Enterprise Custom Fields section of this dialog box. For example, you may 
want a field that explains which department in the company is running the 
project.
Clicking the Statistics button in this dialog box presents an overview of your 
project, as shown in Figure 1-11.
 
Figure 1-11: 
You can 
view a sum-
mary of 
calculations 
about the 
project.
 
Perusing the project schedule
After you choose settings in the Project Information dialog box and then click 
the OK button, you’re faced with a blank Project schedule, as shown in Figure 
1-12. As a writer, I can tell you that nothing is as daunting — or as inspiring — 
as facing a blank page. It’s the canvas on which you create your Project plan.

File tab, Ribbon, and Timeline
Sheet
Chart area
In Figure 1-12, you see Gantt Chart view. You discover more about various 
views in Chapter 2. For now, note the following:
 
✓ File tab, Ribbon, and Timeline: These tools are part of the new inter-
face for Project 2010. You find out more about using them in Chapter 2.
 
✓ Sheet: The left side of the view is the sheet or sheet pane. You can use 
this spreadsheet interface to enter, edit, and view information about 
your project.
 
✓ Chart area: The chart area on the right reflects your task information 
graphically as soon as you begin to add tasks:
 
• Gantt bars in this area indicate the duration and timing of tasks in 
addition to the progress you record on them.
 
• The timescale — the indications of time increments across the top 
of the chart area — helps you interpret the timing of each task bar. 
You can adjust the increments to show your project in larger or 
smaller increments of time. Figure 1-12, for example, shows incre-
ments in days.

28
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
You start building a project by entering tasks. Simply click a cell in the Task 
Name column of the sheet section and then type the name. You can enter and 
edit details of a task by entering information directly into various columns 
(which you can display in many views) or by double-clicking the task name 
in the sheet to access the Task Information dialog box (see Figure 1-13). I get 
into more detail about entering task information in Chapter 2.
 
Figure 1-13:

ous tabs in

Starting with templates
Reinventing the wheel has never been one of my favorite sports, so I’m grate-
ful that Microsoft provides some convenient project templates through the 
online site Office.com. These include projects by type, for example, an engi-
neering project or office move. Templates already have many tasks appropri-
ate to the task type created for you.
Templates typically contain sample tasks broken into logical phases, with 
task durations and dependencies in place. The templates from Microsoft 
often include resources, but you can create your own resources as well as 
use, edit, or delete the ones provided.
You can open a template from the Backstage view, a new location in Project 
2010 where you create and manage Project files. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New.
 
 The Available Templates screen appears, as shown in Figure 1-14.
 
2. Click the a category icon in the Office.com Templates section, then 
click a category icon if necessary. Or, click More Templates and 
then click a category. 
 
 The templates in that category appear.

29
 Chapter 1: Project Management: What It Is, and Why You Should Care
 
Figure 1-14: 
Open a 
template 
from the

Backstage.
 
 
3. Click a template to display a preview.
 
 As shown in Figure 1-15, a preview of the selected template appears at 
the far right.
 
4. When you find the template you want to use, click Download.
 
 The template opens in Project template format (MPT). You can then use 
the Save As command on the File tab to save the file as a regular Project 
file (the correct type will be selected automatically) with a new name. 
From there, you can delete tasks, move tasks around, or add tasks as 
necessary for your project.
 
 After opening a template, be sure to check its project information 
(choose Project➪Project Information) to make sure that the Start Date 
and Calendar options are set as you want.
 
If you modify a file and think that you might use that set of tasks again for 
future projects, consider saving the file as a custom template. Just choose 
File➪Save As, and then select Project Template in the Save as Type list.
Note that after you download a template, you can select it without download-
ing it again. To do so, choose File➪New, click My Templates at the top of 
the Available Templates screen, and then double-click the template in the 
Personal Templates tab of the New dialog box.

Saving a Project for Posterity
Saving Project files works just as saving does in most other software you’ve 
used. Here’s a reminder.
To save a Project file that you haven’t saved before, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 You can choose Save instead if you created the project from scratch 
rather than from a template.
 
2. Use the navigation pane at the left (Windows 7 and Vista) or the Save 
In list (Windows XP) to locate the folder where you want to save the 
file; then click to select it.
 
3. In the File Name text box, type a name for the project.
 
4. Click the Save button.
 
It’s good organizational practice to create a folder for your project where you 
save in one place not only your Project files but also supporting documents, 
e-mails, and other items. You can create a new folder from within the Save As 
dialog box by clicking the New Folder button.

Getting Help from Project
If you can get to work without mishap and turn on your computer, you 
probably know how to use a help system in software, too. Table 1-1 offers a 
rundown of the types of help you can find in Project 2010 when you click the 
Help button just above the right end of the Ribbon or when you press F1.

The Best-Laid Plans
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the benefits of Project’s new interface
▶ Finding your way around Project
▶ Exploring Project views
▶ Personalizing views for your needs
H
omer (not Simpson — the other one) once said, “The evil plan is most 
harmful to the planner.” In the interest of helping you avoid the evils of 
bad planning, take a moment to get comfortable with various aspects of con-
trolling Project and moving around in your Project plan.
The file that you create in Project is called a Project plan, or schedule. This 
plan is like a multidimensional chess game from Star Trek, with a plethora of 
data about various aspects of your project as well as graphical representa-
tions of that information.
To see that information, Project provides more views than the Grand Canyon. 
These views help you observe the structure of your plan and see the prog-
ress in your project. Project also offers many ways to move around and dis-
play different information in your views. Navigating Project and displaying 
(and modifying) its views are the topics covered in this chapter.
Project 2010’s New Interface
When Microsoft updated the navigation structure in the 2007 editions of 
the core Office apps like Word and Excel, it left Project stuck with drab old 
menus. With the 2010 version, Project finally gets the makeover it was wait-
ing for. The following sections describe how to “work it” when you need to 
choose commands and work with files.

34
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Using the Ribbon
The Ribbon dresses up the top of Project’s screen with a colorful collection 
of buttons for commands and settings, as shown in Figure 2-1. The Ribbon 
improves on the old menu system because you can see a variety of com-
mands on-screen at once and make many selections with a single click.
 
Figure 2-1: 
The Ribbon 
makes com-
mands and 
settings 
easier to 
find.
 
Quick Access Toolbar
File tab
Groups
Tabs
Minimize the Ribbon button
The Ribbon includes tabs that organize commands based on a particular 
activity. If you want to work with resource information, chances are you’ll 
find the command or setting you want on the Resource tab. Some tabs come 
and go as needed. For example, the Gantt Chart Tools Format tab shown in 
Figure 2-1 appears only when Gantt Chart view is displayed. Each tab places 
related choices together in groups. Say you wanted to format a cell on the 
sheet. Chances are you’d find the format choice you need in the Font group 
shown in Figure 2-1.
When a button on the Ribbon has a down arrow beside or below it, clicking 
that arrow opens a menu with additional choices. In most cases, you can 
click either the button itself to give the command directly, or click the down 
arrow to check out your other options.
 
Throughout the book, I use the ➪ symbol to point you to the right command 
or choice on the Ribbon. For example, “Choose Project➪Visual Reports” 
means “Click the Project tab on the Ribbon, and then click Visual Reports.”
If you can’t make it through the day without using the keyboard to give com-
mands, no worries. Press the Alt key, and KeyTips appear on the Ribbon. 
Press the letter key for the tab you need, and then press the key for the 
desired choice on the tab. If a KeyTip contains two characters, as in T1, press 
the key for the first character and then the one for the second character. 
Press the Esc key to back up anytime.
 
Press Ctrl+F1 or click the Minimize the Ribbon button (Figure 2-1) to hide and 
redisplay the Ribbon.

35
 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans
Above and to the left of the Ribbon is a small toolbar called the Quick Access 
Toolbar. It appears on-screen at all times and initially contains the Save, 
Undo, and Redo buttons. To add more buttons, click the down arrow at the 
right end of the toolbar and click a button to hide or display in the menu. 
Don’t see the command you want? Click More Commands near the bottom of 
the menu to discover the other commands you can add.
The Backstage view
The stylish green button at the left end of the Ribbon is called the File tab. 
Clicking it opens the Backstage view, where you find the choices for working 
with files and changing options in Project. As shown in Figure 2-2, the main 
choices in the Backstage view are listed along the left. Clicking some of the 
choices, such as Open, displays a dialog box or performs an action immedi-
ately. In other cases, selecting a command in the Backstage view gives you 
a list of additional choices or a graphical screen for completing the action 
you want. Clicking Recent displays a list of recently used files you may want 
to reopen. Clicking Print displays a screen where you can choose settings to 
preview the printout (Figure 2-2).

36
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Use the Exit command at the bottom of the list to shut down Project. If you 
display the Backstage view and want to return to working with your project, 
click the File tab again or one of the other Ribbon tabs.
Finding commonly used commands
Want to see what you can do right now with any item on the screen? Right-
click the item and Project displays both a shortcut menu and a mini-toolbar. 
They present only the commands and choices for working on what you 
clicked, so you don’t have to bother with the Ribbon. When I click on a Gantt 
bar, for example, the choices shown in Figure 2-3 appear. The choices for 
clicking a cell on the sheet would be different. You can either use one of the 
commands that appear or press Esc or click elsewhere to bail out.

Navigating Project
For each project plan file you create, Project essentially builds an extensive 
database of information. The different views in Project enable you to zero in 
on different combinations of the data you need. Having a lot of views from 
which to observe your project information is great, but all those views don’t 
do you any good if you don’t know how to get from one to the other or how 
to move around in a view after you find it.
Changing views
You can move from one view to another in Project by using the Task and 
View tabs on the Ribbon. Clicking the bottom part (with the down arrow) of 
the Gantt Chart button at the left of the Task tab displays a menu of Project’s 
13 most used views, as shown in Figure 2-4, as well as any custom views you 
create. Simply click any view listed to display that view. In case it’s not obvi-
ous, clicking the top part of the Gantt Chart button redisplays Gantt Chart 
view.

37
 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans
 
Figure 2-4: 
The View 
choices 
on the 
Task tab.
 
Clicking the View tab on the Ribbon gives you alternate choices for selecting 
a view and more, as shown in Figure 2-5. The Task Views group at the far left 
enables you to select Gantt Chart, Task Usage, Network Diagram, Calendar, 
and Timeline views. The Resource Views group enables you to select the 
Team Planner, Resource Usage, Resource Sheet, or other resource views. 
The other groups on the tab offer choices for adjusting the view and the data 
shown. You can zoom a view to see it better or sort the data shown in the 
view, for starters.

The lower-right corner of the Project window includes buttons for jumping 
directly to Gantt Chart, Task Usage, Team Planner, and Resource Sheet views.

38
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
In addition to the views you can display via the Task or View tabs, you may 
need to use one of the dozen or so other views as you work through your 
project. To display views not directly available via the Ribbon, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click either the Task or View tab on the Ribbon.
 
2. Click the bottom part of the Gantt Chart button.
 
3. Click More Views at the bottom of the menu.
 
 The More Views dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-6.
 
Figure 2-6: 
More than 
two dozen 
views are 
available for 
display in 
Project.
 
 
4. Use the scroll bar to locate the view you want.
 
5. Select the view you want and click the Apply button.
 
If you liked the View bar that was available in earlier versions of Project, you 
can still use it. Right-click the gray bar at the left side of Project and choose 
View Bar to display it. Right-click the View bar and choose View Bar to hide it 
again.
Scrolling around
The simplest views, such as Calendar view, have a single pane, with horizon-
tal and vertical scroll bars. Other views, such as Resource Usage view (see 
Figure 2-7), have two panes. In that case, each pane has its own horizontal 
scroll bar; they share the vertical scroll bar, so the panes move up and down 
together.
In most views with two panes, the pane to the left is called the sheet, which is 
a spreadsheet-like interface with columns of information. To the right of this 
view is the chart. The chart uses bars, symbols, and lines to represent each 
task in your project and the dependency relationships among them.

39
 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans
 
Figure 2-7: 
Multiple 
panes of 
information 
maximize 
space in 
many views.
 
At the top of the chart area is the timescale. This tool is used as a scale 
against which you can interpret the timing of the taskbars. To see your plan 
in greater or lesser timing detail, you can modify the time units used in the 
timescale. For example, you can look at your tasks in detail over days or in a 
broader overview in months. Figure 2-8 shows a two-pane view with a sheet, 
chart, and timescale.
 
See the “Changing the timescale” section, later in this chapter, to find out how 
to change the time increments displayed in the timescale.
By using the horizontal scroll bars in each pane, you can view additional 
columns or additional time periods in any pane with a timescale. Timescale 
panes cover the life of the project; in longer projects, you can scroll through 
years of time.
Use these different methods to work with scroll bars:
 
✓ Drag the scroll box on a scroll bar until you reach the location in the 
pane that you want to look at. When you drag the scroll box to move 
through a timescale display, the date display indicates where you are at 
any time in your scrolling calendar. Release the mouse button when the 
date display matches the date you want to view.

✓ Click to the left or right of the horizontal scroll box to move one page 
at a time. Note that a page in this instance is controlled to some extent 
by how you resize a given pane. For example, with a timescale pane 
and a timescale set to weeks, you move one week at a time. In a sheet 
pane that displays three columns, you move to the next (or preceding) 
column.
 
✓ Click the right or left arrow at either end of a scroll bar to move in 
smaller increments. With a sheet pane, you move about one-half column 
per click. In a timescale view with weeks displayed, you move about one 
day at a time.
Getting to a specific spot in your plan
To reach a particular area of your Project plan, you can also use the Go To 
feature, which you use by pressing the F5 key. With Go To, you can enter 
either of two items in the Go To dialog box when you want to find a task:

41
 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans
 
✓ A date from a drop-down calendar
 
✓ A task ID
You can also click the Scroll to Task button on the Task tab of the Ribbon (or 
press Ctrl+Shift+F5) to scroll the chart pane of the view to show the taskbar 
for a selected task in the sheet pane.
 
The task ID is assigned automatically when you create tasks; this number pro-
vides a unique identifier for tasks in the plan.
A Project with a View
Views organize information so that you can get to it in logical ways. Because 
of the complexity of information in a typical Project plan, Project offers many 
views for slicing and dicing the information. If an average word processing 
document is as complex as a cookie, your average Project plan is more like a 
five-tier wedding cake adorned with intricate flowers and garlands in delicate 
swirls of sugary icing.
A Project plan holds information about the following:
 
✓ Resources: The resource name, resource type, rate per hour, overtime 
rate, department, cost per use, and more
 
✓ Tasks: The task name, duration, start and finish dates, assigned 
resources, costs, constraints, and dependencies, for example
 
✓ Assignments: The information about which resources will be completing 
which tasks, including hours of work, units of effort, and remaining work
 
✓ Project timing and progress: Several types of calendars, project start

baseline information, critical path information, and more
 
✓ Financial information: Earned value, time and cost variance, and pro-

Want to get closer? In every view, you can use the Zoom command on the 
View tab to see more or less detail in your schedule. Read more about using 
the Zoom button in the sidebar “Zooming in and out,” later in this chapter.
Finding out how to use the many Project views to enter, edit, look at, and ana-
lyze Project data is important. Don’t worry that you’ll be overwhelmed: After 
a while, using all those views is . . . well, a piece of cake.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Home base: Gantt Chart view
Gantt Chart view is like a favorite room in your house, the place where most 
people end up. It’s the view that appears first when you open a new project. 
This view, shown in Figure 2-9, is a combination of spreadsheet data and a 
graphical representation of tasks; it offers a wealth of information in one place.
 
Figure 2-9: 
Gantt Chart 
view can 
display any 
combination 
of columns 
of data that 
you want.
 
Gantt Chart view has two major sections: the sheet pane on the left and 
the chart pane on the right. This view is an electronic version of the origi-
nal Gantt chart, developed by engineer Henry L. Gantt in 1917 to deal with 
production-control projects in manufacturing. (See? Invent a project manage-
ment tool, and you too can become immortal.)
In Gantt Chart view (and any view with a sheet pane), you can change what 
information is shown in the sheet by using tables. Tables are preset combi-
nations of columns (fields) of data that you can easily display by choosing 
View➪Tables and then choosing a table (such as Entry or Cost) from the 
menu that appears.
 
You can also customize the column display for any table by displaying or 
hiding individual columns of data one by one. (See the section “Displaying dif-
ferent columns,” later in this chapter, for information about this procedure.)

 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans
The resourceful views: Resource 
Sheet and Team Planner
Resource Sheet view, shown in Figure 2-10, is where you add the resources 
that will be handling the work for your project. Because this simple view con-
tains only a sheet, you should feel right at home in it. You can type entries 
in cells and use the Tab and arrow keys to move around. Chapter 7 digs in 
to what each of the fields of this view is for, and how to set up your resource 
and cost info the right way.
 
Figure 2-10: 
Add project 
resources 
in Resource 
Sheet view.
 
Even though it’s tough to avoid overbooking resources when you have a 
project jamming too much to do in too little time, the Professional Edition 
of Project 2010 adds even more help for dealing with that issue. New Team 
Planner view, shown in Figure 2-11, shows you what each team member is 
scheduled to work on, and when. You can change an assignment simply by 
dragging it from one resource to another. Voilà! Assignment problems solved. 
You find out more about this view in Chapter 9.

Getting your timing down 
with the Timeline
Your manager and the project’s client may not want to see every detail in 
your grand plan. If you need to share project information with a person whose 
eyes glaze over easily, meet your new best friend — the Project 2010 Timeline. 
The Timeline appears in its own small pane by default with some of the other 
views. It gives a simplified picture of the entire schedule. When used with a 
view like the Gantt Chart, as shown in Figure 2-12, the portions of the schedule 
that aren’t visible in the chart pane are shaded. You can also display individual 
tasks on the Timeline as needed, and more. Chapter 16 delves in to how to 
work with the Timeline and use it as a communication tool.
Going with the flow: Network 
Diagram view
Another view that you’re likely to use often is Network Diagram view, which 
is shown in Figure 2-13. The organization of information represents the 

45
 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans
workflow in your project, with a series of task boxes. The boxes include 
dependency lines running between them to reflect the sequence of tasks (see 
Chapter 6 for more about dependency relationships). You read this view 
from left to right, with the earlier tasks on the left flowing into later tasks and 
subtasks to the right. Tasks that happen in the same time frame are aligned 
vertically above each other. Tasks with an X through them have been marked 
as complete.
 
Figure 2-12: 
Timeline 
view covers 
the whole 
schedule.
 
 
Traditionally called a PERT chart, this method of diagramming workflow was 
developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s for use in building the 
Polaris submarine.
Network Diagram view has no timescale because the view isn’t used to see 
specific timing but rather to see the general order of tasks in a plan. However, 
each task box holds specific timing information about each task, such as the 
start date, finish date, and duration. (You can customize the information in 
the task boxes, as described in the section “Customizing Views,” later in this 
chapter.) Timeline view, by default, appears along the top of this view.

Calling up Calendar view
Who can conceive of creating a schedule without opening a calendar? This 
familiar view of time is one of the many views offered in Project. Calendar 
view, as shown in Figure 2-14, looks like a monthly wall calendar, with boxes 
that represent days on a calendar in rows that represent the days in a week.
You can modify Calendar view to display as many weeks as you need by 
clicking the Custom button and changing the Number of Weeks setting in 
the Zoom dialog box. Calendar view also includes a timescale that you can 
modify to show a 7-day or 5-day week and shading to indicate working and 
nonworking days based on a selected base or resource calendar.
 
More than two dozen views are built in to Project. You encounter many more 
as you work through specific elements of Project in this book.

 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans

(or even

Customizing Views
Just when you thought you were starting to get a handle on the two dozen or 
so views available in Project, I dazzle you with even more possibilities: Every 
one of those views can be customized to show different information. Now the 
possible view variations become astronomical.
You can customize every view in Project to show different information; for 
example, you can choose to show different columns of information in spread-
sheets, different labels in Network Diagram boxes or taskbars, or different 
sets of data in graph views. You can modify the size of panes of information 
and adjust the timescale.
Why all this flexibility with what you see on-screen? At various times in 
a project, you need to focus on different aspects of your tasks. Having a 
problem with costs? Take a look at Resource Usage view and insert several 
columns of cost information, such as resource rates and total actual costs. 
Is your plan taking longer than the Hundred Years’ War? You may want to 
display Tracking Gantt view and look at a bunch of columns with timing and 
dependency data or examine the project’s critical path in the chart pane. 

48
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Need to display more of the sheet area so that you can read those columns 
without having to scroll? You can do that, too. In the following sections, you 
find out how to do all the things you need to do to show a variety of informa-
tion in each view.
Working with view panes
In addition to Gantt Chart view, several other views have two panes, such as 
Task Usage, Tracking Gantt, and Resource Usage. When the Timeline appears 
with a view, it appears in a third horizontal pane at the top. You can modify the 
information that you see in the sheet pane as well as the scale for timing in the 
chart pane. You can also display information near taskbars in the chart pane.
Resizing a pane
In views that show more than one pane, you can reduce or enlarge each 
pane. This capability helps you see more information in one area, depending 
on your focus at the time.
 
The overall area taken up by the panes is constant, so when you enlarge one 
pane, you reduce the size of the other.
Follow these steps to change the size of a pane in a view:
 
1. Place your mouse pointer over the edge of a pane.
 
2. When you see a pointer that’s a line with two arrows (one pointing left 
and one pointing right, as shown in Figure 2-15), drag:
 
• Dragging to the left enlarges the pane on the right.
 
• Dragging to the right enlarges the pane on the left.
 
• Dragging up or down changes the size of the Timeline pane versus 
the area available for the rest of the view.
 
Figure 2-15:

mouse 
pointer over 
the edge of 
a pane and 
drag when 
you see this 
pointer to 
resize the 
pane.

 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans
 
3. Release the mouse button.
 
 The panes are resized.
Changing the timescale
I wish I could tell you that Project actually lets you change time and give your 
project lots more of it, but it doesn’t. What it does allow you to do is modify 
the timescale to display your plan in larger or smaller time increments.
A timescale consists of a possible total of three tiers, as you can see in Figure 
2-16. You can use the tiers to display different time increments. For example, 
the top tier can mark off months, while the middle tier marks off weeks and 
the bottom tier marks off days. This variety of detail lets you easily observe 
overall task length as well as points in time during the life of the task. You 
can use all three tiers, only the middle tier, or the middle and bottom tiers.
 
Figure 2-16: 
The tim-
escale is 
comprised 
of three 
tiers, so you 
can view 
time from 
several 
directions.
 
You can modify the units of time and the alignment of each tier and also 
include tick lines to mark the beginning of each increment on the timescale. 
You also have the option to include or not include nonworking time on the 
timescale. For example, if you include an indication of nonworking time on a 
project for which weekends are nonworking, Saturdays and Sundays are indi-
cated by a shaded area in the display, which can make a useful visual divider 
between weeks.
You can also display text labels near taskbars and change what data is 
included. Labels can be placed above, below, inside, or to the left or right of 
the taskbars. Especially in projects where you display many columns of data 
and a lengthy schedule, a taskbar can be placed far to the right of the sheet 
pane data. You can then include information, such as task name or start date, 
alongside the taskbar to help you read your plan more easily.

50
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
To modify the timescale, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the timescale in any view that contains one and then 
choose Timescale.
 
 The Timescale dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 2-16.)
 
2. Click a tier tab and select a style for Units, Label, and Align.
 
3. Set the count.
 
 For example, if your Units choice is weeks and you change the Count 
option to 2, the timescale appears in two-week increments.
 
4. If you don’t want to display a certain tier, select One Tiers or Two 
Tiers from the Show drop-down list (in the Timescale Options section).
 
5. If you want Project to use fiscal year notation in the timescale, select 
the Use Fiscal Year check box.
 
 For example, if your 2010 fiscal year begins July 1, 2010, 2011 is used on 
all months in the fiscal year. The fiscal year is set in the Options dialog 
box on the Calendar tab.
 
6. To show marks at the beginning of each unit of time, select the Tick 
Lines check box.
 
7. Repeat Steps 2–6 for each tier you want to modify.
 
8. Click the Non-working Time tab.
 
9. In the Draw options, select the one you prefer.
 
 Your choices are to have the shaded area for nonworking time appear 
behind taskbars or in front of them, or just not appear.
 
10. In the Color or Pattern list, select different options for the shading 
format.
 
11. Click the Calendar setting and select a different calendar to base the 
timescale on.
 
 You can find out more about calendar choices in Chapter 3.
 
12. Click the OK button to save your new settings, which apply only to the 
timescale for the currently displayed view.
 
You can use the Size setting on the three tier tabs to shrink the display pro-
portionately to get more information on your screen or the printed page.

 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans
Displaying different columns
Each spreadsheet view has certain default columns of data that are stored 
in tables. Gantt Chart view with the Tracking table displayed, for example, 
has data related to the progress of tasks. The Resource sheet contains many 
columns of data about resources that can be useful for entering new resource 
information. In addition to displaying predefined tables of columns, you can 
modify any spreadsheet table to display any columns you like.
Follow this procedure to show selected columns of data:
 
1. Scroll the table to the right, and click the Add New Column column 
heading.
 
 A list of available columns appears, as shown in Figure 2-17.
 
2. In the list, select the field that contains the information you want to 
include. (Typing the first letter of the field name scrolls the list more 
quickly.)
 
3. If you want to enter a different title for the field, right-click and 
choose Field Settings. Type the name in the Title box and click the OK 
button.
 
 The title in the current view appears in the column heading for this field.
 
4. Move the mouse pointer over the column heading, and drag the 
column to the left to the position you want in the table.
 
To hide a column, right-click its heading in the sheet pane and then choose 
Hide Column. Or, to insert a column at a particular location, right-click the 
column heading that’s currently at that location and choose Insert Column.
Zooming in and out
One way to modify your display for any Project 
view is to use the Zoom menu on the View tab 
of the Ribbon. This feature shows you a longer 
or shorter period of time in your project without 
you needing to change the timescale settings 
manually. When you need to see several years 
at a time in your project, for example, click 
Zoom and then Zoom Out several times until you 
fit as many months or years as you like in the 
view. You can also choose Zoom at the bottom 
of the menu and specify periods of time to dis-
play in the Zoom dialog box, or even choose 
to have the entire project appear on-screen. 
Another quick but less precise way to zoom is 
to use the Zoom slider at the lower-right corner 
of the Project window. Drag it left to zoom out 
and right to zoom in.

52
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 2-17: 
Here you 
can select 
new col-
umns to

You can also display preset tables of sheet data, such as Tracking for record-
ing activity on tasks or Entry for entering new task information. You do this 
by simply choosing View➪Tables and then clicking the name of the table you 
want to display.
Modifying the contents of the 
Network Diagram boxes
When you first display Network Diagram view, you see boxes of various 
types, one for each task in your project. You can change the information con-
tained in those boxes and change the box formatting.
By default, a typical subtask contains the task name, task ID, start date, finish 
date, duration, and resource names. For a milestone, you get only the mile-
stone date, milestone name, and task ID number.
 
See Chapter 4 for more about adding information about tasks and milestones.
Different categories of tasks (such as critical or noncritical) can contain differ-
ent information, and you can change the information contained in any indi-
vidual box or category of boxes.

53
 Chapter 2: The Best-Laid Plans
Changing what’s in the box
Sometimes you want to see information about task timing; other times, you 
focus on other issues, such as resources. To accommodate these various 
information needs, Network Diagram view allows you to use various tem-
plates for what’s contained in the diagram boxes.
To modify the information included in these boxes, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click anywhere in Network Diagram view outside any box and 
then choose Box Styles.
 
 The Box Styles dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-18.
 
Figure 2-18: 
You can use 
templates 
of data for 
Network 
Diagram 
view task 
boxes.
 
 
2. In the Style Settings For list, select a task category.
 
3. To modify the data included in the task boxes, select a different tem-
plate from the Data Template list.
 
 You can choose additional templates (and edit any template to include 
whatever data you like) by clicking the More Templates button.
 
 A preview of the data included in the template appears in the Preview 
area.
 
4. Click the OK button to save the new template.
 
You can also apply different templates to each box separately by right-clicking 
a box (rather than clicking outside a box), choosing Format Box, selecting a 
different template from the Data Template drop-down list, and then clicking 
the OK button.

54
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Making boxes pretty
Are you the creative type? Don’t like the shape or color of the boxes in the 
Network Diagram boxes? Want to add shading to the background of the 
boxes? Project lets you do all that and more.
Follow these steps to modify the format of Network Diagram boxes:
 
1. Right-click anywhere in Network Diagram view outside any box and 
then choose Box Styles.
 
 The Box Styles dialog box appears (refer to Figure 2-18).
 
2. Click the Shape drop-down list and select a different shape from the 
list that appears.
 
3. Click the Color drop-down list in the Border section and select a dif-
ferent color from the list of colors.
 
 Note: This choice specifies the color of the line that forms the box, not a 
background color. For that, see Step 5 of this list.
 
4. Click the Width drop-down list and select a line width from those 
displayed.
 
5. Click the Color drop-down list in the Background section and select a 
color for the background that fills the inside of each box.
 
6. Click the Pattern drop-down list and select a pattern of lines to fill the 
interior of each box.
 
 Combinations of some patterns and colors in backgrounds can make the 
text in the box difficult to read, so look at the preview in this dialog box 
to be sure that the combination works.
 
7. Click the OK button to save the new settings.
 
You can also format individual boxes by right-clicking a box, choosing Format 
Box, and then making the settings outlined in this set of steps.
Resetting the view
Most changes you make in a view hang around as long as you want them to. 
But if you’ve made so many changes that the view is kind of a mess, you can 
reset it at any time. Click the Task tab on the Ribbon, click the bottom of the 
Gantt Chart button, and click Reset to Default. Now the view will revert to the 
default view.

M
ost people live their lives based on clocks and calendars. Think about 
it: You wake up, and your first thoughts are about what day it is, what 
time it is, and whether it’s a working day.
You have a familiar definition for what your typical workday is, whether 
you’re a 9-to-5 kind of person or your particular job calls for you to work 
from midnight to 8 a.m. You also vary from that routine now and then by put-
ting in a 12-hour marathon in a crunch or slipping away after half a day to go 
fishing on a nice summer day.
Project 2010 calendars are sort of like your life in that they set some stan-
dards for a typical working time and then allow for variation. Unlike you, 
Project 2010 has several types of calendars to account for.
Mastering Base, Project, Resource, 
and Task Calendars
Bear with me because I won’t kid you: Mastering the four calendars in Project 
2010 can be tricky. Understanding how calendars work in Project 2010, 
however, is essential to mastering the software. Tasks are scheduled and 
resources are assigned based on the calendar settings that you make. Thus, 

56
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
the costs accumulated by resource work hours won’t be accurate if you don’t 
understand your calendar settings from the get-go.
 
Because the use of the term project can get confusing as it refers to the soft-
ware, your project plan, and one of the calendar types (the Project calendar), 
I need to explain the terminology I use in this chapter. I use Project 2010 when 
referring to the software itself, Project calendar when referring to the calendar, 
and just plain project when talking about your project plan.
How calendars work
Here’s the lowdown on the role of each of the four calendars in Project 2010 
(with more in the next section about how they interact with each other):
 
✓ Base calendar: This is the calendar template that all other calendars are 
built on top of. Three Base calendars are available: Standard, 24 Hours, 
and Night Shift. (You read more about them shortly.)
 
✓ Project calendar: This is the default calendar for scheduling. This is 
where you choose which Base calendar template this particular project 
should use.
 
✓ Resource calendar: This combines the Base calendar settings with any 
exceptions (nonworking times) that you set for a particular resource.
 
✓ Task calendar: This is where you can set exceptions for a particular 
task.
When you create tasks and assign resources to work on them, Project 2010 
has to base that work on a timing standard. For example, if you say that a 
task should be completed in one workday, Project 2010 knows that a workday 
means 8 hours (or 12 hours or whatever) because that’s how you set up a 
standard workday in your Project calendar. Likewise, suppose that you assign 
a resource to put in two weeks of work on a task in a company that uses a stan-
dard five-day workweek. If that resource’s own calendar is set for a standard 
four-day workweek, the two weeks of work put in by that resource defer to the 
timing of the Resource calendar for a total of only eight workdays.
 
The nature of a task can have an effect on resource time. A two-week, effort-
driven task isn’t complete until its resources have put in two weeks (accord-
ing to the Project or Task calendar) of effort. Find out more about effort-driven 
tasks in Chapter 4.
Not everyone in a company works the same schedule, and not every task can 
be performed in the same eight-hour workday. To deal with the variations in 

57
 Chapter 3: Mark It on Your Calendar
schedules that occur in most workforces, Project 2010 offers various calen-
dar settings. As I mention earlier in this chapter, Project, Resource, and Task 
calendars can be set to use one of three Base calendar templates built into 
Project 2010. The three Base calendar templates are as follows:
 
✓ Standard: The default setting. Sets a working day as 8 a.m.–5 p.m. with 
an hour for lunch and a five-day, Monday–Friday workweek.
 
✓ 24 Hours: Allows work to go on around the clock every day of the week.
 
✓ Night Shift: Sets the working time as 11 p.m.–8 a.m. with an hour for 
dinner and a six-night, Monday–Saturday workweek. Working times for a 
Night Shift calendar are shown in Figure 3-1.
 
Check out the explanation at the right in Figure 3-1; it explains the different 
hours of work available for the selected date.
 
Figure 3-1: 
Different 
hours are 
shaded in 
the calendar 
display.
 
 
You can modify the three Base calendar templates and create new templates 
from them. See the section “Do It Yourself: Creating a Custom Calendar 
Template,” later in this chapter.

58
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
How one calendar relates to another
All calendars in your project are controlled, by default, by the Project cal-
endar setting. Here’s the tricky part, though: When you change a Task or 
Resource calendar (this type of change is referred to as an exception), you 
have to understand which setting takes precedence.
Here’s how this precedence thing works:
 
✓ With no other settings made, the Base calendar template you select for 
the Project calendar when you first create the project controls the work-
ing times and days of all tasks and resources.
 
✓ If you make changes in the working hours for a resource, those settings 
take precedence over the Project calendar for that resource when you 
assign it to a task. Likewise, if you assign a different Base calendar for a 
task, that calendar takes precedence over the Project calendar for that 
task.
 
✓ If you apply one calendar to a resource and a different calendar to a task 
that the resource is assigned to, Project 2010 uses only common hours 
to schedule the resource. For example, if the Task calendar allows work 
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the Resource calendar allows work from 6 a.m. 
to 2 p.m., the resource works from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., which is the only 
period the calendars have in common.
 
✓ You can set a task to ignore Resource calendar settings by opening the 
Task Information dialog box (double-click the task name in Gantt Chart 
view) and selecting the Scheduling Ignores Resource Calendars check 
box on the Advanced tab. (This setting isn’t available if the Task cal-
endar is set to None.) You might make this setting if you know that all 
resources are required to be involved in a task (such as a quarterly com-
pany meeting), regardless of their usual work hours.
Calendar Options and Working Times
Just when you thought that you were out of the woods, I’ll throw two more 
timing elements at you — calendar options and working times.
Calendar options are used to change the standards for a working day, week, 
and year. If you set a Project calendar to Standard (by default, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
five days a week), for example, the Calendar tab of the Options dialog box 
is where you can designate which five days are working days or modify the 
working hours to 9 a.m.–6 p.m.

59
 Chapter 3: Mark It on Your Calendar
Working time is used to adjust the time available for work on a particular date 
or days. Suppose that you make a change to the calendar options so that 
you have 8-hour days and 32-hour workweeks. You should also check your 
working time and be sure that you specify three days of the seven-day week 
should be nonworking to jibe with the 32-hour week. If you want to set a cer-
tain date as nonworking for your project, such as your company offsite meet-
ing day, you can do that with the working time settings.
 
If you use Project Server for enterprise-wide project management, you can 
make settings in the Enterprise Global Template, which sets the working time 
for all projects across your company. See Chapter 18 for more about enter-
prise settings.
 
It is best to change all calendar options and make working time changes before 
you add any tasks to your project. This ensures that the project will be sched-
uled accurately from the get-go. Also, you have to change the calendar options 
and calendar settings for every new project file you create.
Setting calendar options
When you make changes to a Resource or Task calendar, you simply adjust 
the times that a resource is available to work or the time during which a task 
occurs. You don’t change the length of a typical workday for the project. A 
day is still eight hours long if that’s the Project calendar setting, even if you 
say that a task that takes place on that day uses the 24-hour Base calendar 
template.
If you want to change the length of a typical workday to ten hours rather 
than eight, for example, you must do so on the Calendar tab of the Options 
dialog box.
Follow these steps to modify the calendar options:
 
1. Choose File➪Options.
 
 The Project Options dialog box appears.
 
2. Click Schedule, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
 You can also display these settings by clicking the Options button in the 
Change Working Time dialog box. Read about the settings there in the 
following section.
 
3. From the Week Starts On drop-down list, choose a day.
 
4. To modify the start of your fiscal year, select the month you want from 
the Fiscal Year Starts In drop-down list.

If your company uses these settings for most projects, you can click the Set as 
Default button on the Calendar tab of the Options dialog box to make your set-
tings the default settings for any new project you create.
Setting exceptions to working times
If you want to change the available working hours for a particular day (such 
as December 24), you use the working time settings. For example, if you want 
the day before Christmas to be a half day, you can modify the working time 

61
 Chapter 3: Mark It on Your Calendar
settings for that day; then any resources assigned to a task on this date put in 
only one-half day of work. You also use these settings to specify global work-
ing and nonworking days to match the calendar options settings.
Here’s how to change working times:
 
1. Choose Project➪Change Working Time.
 
 The Change Working Time dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-3.
 
Figure 3-3: 
The working 
times you 
set here for 
your project 
should cor-
respond to 
settings in 
the calendar 
options.
 
 
2. In the Click on a Day to See Its Working Times calendar section, click 
the day you want to change.
 
3. Click the Exceptions tab to display it; then click the Name cell in a 
blank row, type a name for the exception, and press Enter.
 
4. Click the exception name you just entered, and then click the Details 
button.
 
 The Details box for this exception appears (see Figure 3-4).
 
5. Select either the Nonworking or Working Times radio button.

62
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 3-4: 
Modify the 
settings for 
the default 
calendar.
 
 
6. Enter a time range in the From and To fields.
 
 If you want to set nonconsecutive hours (for example, to build in a lunch 
break), you have to put two or more sets of numbers here (such as 8 to 
12 and 1 to 5).
 
7. Select a recurrence pattern and then set an interval in the Recur 
Every x time period field.
 
 For example, if you select Weekly and click the arrows to set the interval 
field to 3, this pattern recurs every three weeks.
 
8. Set the range of recurrence.
 
 You can do this step by entering Start and End By dates or by selecting 
the End After radio button and setting the number of occurrences there.
 
9. Click the OK button twice to close the dialog boxes and save your 
changes.
 
The Nondefault Work Week legend item that you find in the Change Working 
Time dialog box (refer to Figure 3-3) designates working time that isn’t part of 
the working time established by the Base calendar template for this calendar.
Setting the Project Calendar and Other 
Essential Project Information
The first calendar that you should specify for your project is the Project 
calendar. You set the Project calendar in the Project Information dialog 
box (shown in Figure 3-5), which you can display at any time by choosing 

63
 Chapter 3: Mark It on Your Calendar
Project➪Project Information. At a minimum, you also should specify the start 
date for the project in this dialog box. Project assumes you’re planning your 
project in advance — as any good project manager does — so you need to 
tell it the date from which it should start scheduling the project’s tasks.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Your choice 
of calendars 
includes 
one of these 
three Base 
calendar 
templates.
 
Here are the settings that you can make in the Project Information dialog box:
 
✓ Calendar: Select the Base calendar template to use for the Project calen-
dar from this drop-down list. I list this setting first because it’s the only 
one you have to deal with when you start a new project.
 
✓ Start Date and Finish Date: For a project scheduled forward from the 
start date (see the next bullet), enter only the start date. Or, if you 
schedule backward from the finish date, enter a finish date. See more 
about these settings in Chapter 4.
 
✓ Schedule From: You can choose to have tasks scheduled backward from 
the finish date or forward from the start date. Most folks go forward 
from the start date.
 
✓ Current Date: By default, this setting matches your computer clock 
setting. However, you can change this so that it does not match your 
computer clock setting. Changing this date is useful for looking at what-if 
scenarios or for tracking progress as of a certain date in the past.
 
✓ Status Date: You typically set this to the current date to track the prog-
ress on your project. When tracking, you usually want to see the status 
of your project as of now, so you don’t really need to deal with this 
setting. However, if you want to track as of the end of a fiscal period or 
another time frame, you can change this to track the status of your tasks 
as of any other date.

64
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
✓ Priority: This field is useful if your organization has many projects and 
you create links among them. If you use a tool such as resource leveling 
(see Chapter 10 for more about this topic) to resolve conflicts, it can 
consider this project priority setting when making its calculations about 
what to delay and what to keep on track.
Modifying Task Calendars
You can set a Task calendar to use a different Base calendar template than 
the one you selected for the Project calendar. Doing so takes precedence 
over the Project calendar for that task. Suppose that you select the Standard 
calendar template for a project and a 24 Hours Task calendar template. If 
you then specify that the task has a duration of one day, it’s one 24-hour day 
(assuming that the resources assigned also use a calendar allowing for a 
24-hour schedule).
To modify the settings for a Task calendar, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the task name.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced tab.
 
3. From the Calendar drop-down list, choose a different Base calendar, 
as shown in Figure 3-6.
 
Figure 3-6: 
You can 
apply any 
of the three 
calendar 
types to 
tasks in your 
project.
 
 
4. Click the OK button to save your new calendar setting.

65
 Chapter 3: Mark It on Your Calendar
 
If a resource assigned to this task has a modified calendar, that resource 
works only during the specific hours that the Task calendar and Resource cal-
endar have in common.
Making Resource Calendar Settings
Even the most resourceful resources have only so many hours in a day to 
work. When you have to deal with variations in resource schedules, consider 
modifying the Resource calendars.
Which resources get calendars?
Projects can have three types of resource: work, material, and cost. You can 
read more about these in Chapter 7. For now, you should know that only one 
resource type — the work resource — has its own calendar. That’s because 
material resources are charged not by time worked but rather by units used, 
and a cost resource gets assigned a set cost that also doesn’t relate to any 
time worked on a task.
You can change the Base calendar template for each work resource and set 
specific dates as working or nonworking. These exceptions take precedence 
over your Project and Task calendars, and control when a specific resource 
can work.
 
I have one word of caution about modifying Resource calendars: Unless a 
resource truly has a unique working schedule, don’t change its Base calendar 
template. For example, if a resource usually works a day shift but works a 
night shift for only a few days during the life of the project, don’t change that 
resource’s Base calendar template to Night Shift. If one person works from 
10 a.m. to 7 p.m. because the company allows him to, you probably don’t 
have to vary his schedule from the typical 8-to-5 work schedule that’s set in 
the Project calendar because he puts in eight hours a day like everyone else. 
Unless your project deals with the most detailed level of time, where hours 
and not days are the typical units of measure for tasks, making these types of 
changes is more work than it’s worth.
Making the change to a 
resource’s calendar
To modify a resource’s calendar settings, follow these steps:
 
1. Display a view that includes a resource column, such as the Resource 
Sheet view.

66
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
 Just select the view from the drop-down list that appears when you click 
the bottom of the Gantt Chart button on the Task tab of the Ribbon. 
Chapter 1 covers how to display different views.
 
2. Double-click a resource name.
 
 The Resource Information dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the Change Working Time button on the General tab to display 
the Change Working Time dialog box, shown in Figure 3-7.
 
 
The Exceptions and Work Weeks tabs have settings that are identical to 
the ones in the Change Working Time dialog box I discuss for tasks, but 
changes made here affect this resource rather than the task.
 
Figure 3-7: 
Making 
changes 
here 
affects this 
resource.
 
 
4. In the Click on a Day to See Its Working Times calendar section, click 
the day that you want to change.
 
5. Click the Work Weeks tab to display it; then click a blank row, enter a 
name for the exception, and press Enter.
 
 If you want to edit the default work week for all weeks of the year, leave 
[Default] selected instead. If you want to mark a single holiday, use the 
Exceptions tab instead.

67
 Chapter 3: Mark It on Your Calendar
 
6. Click back on the exception you just created, and click the Details 
button.
 
 The Details dialog box for this exception appears (see Figure 3-8).
 
Figure 3-8: 
Set a 
workweek 
exception 
for a calen-
dar, such as

7. Select the day(s) to modify in the Select Day(s) list at the left.
 
 You can click the first day and then Shift+click to select a range of adja-
cent days. Or, Ctrl+click to select nonadjacent days.
 
8. Select either the Set Days to Nonworking Time or the Set Day(s) to 
These Specific Working Times radio button.
 
9. If you chose the latter option in Step 8, enter a time range in the From 
and To fields.
 
 To delete a row in the From and To area, click the row number and 
press Delete.
 
 
If you want to set nonconsecutive hours (for example, to build in a lunch 
break), you have to put two or more sets of numbers here (such as 8 to 
12 and 1 to 5).
 
10. Click the OK button.
 
11. Set the range of recurrence.
 
 You can do this by changing the start and finish dates on the row for the 
exception, pressing Tab to finish each entry.
 
12. Click the OK button to close the Change Working Time dialog box and 
save your changes.
 
Can resources work overtime even if their calendars say that they’re 9-to-
5’ers? Yes, but you have to tell Project 2010 to schedule overtime work. You 
can also set a different rate to be charged for overtime work for that resource. 
To find out more about overtime, see Chapter 8.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Do It Yourself: Creating a Custom 
Calendar Template
If you ever wanted to make your own time, here’s your chance. Although 
Project 2010’s three Base calendar templates probably cover most work-
ing situations, you might want to create your own calendar template. For 
example, if your project involves a telemarketing initiative and most proj-
ect resources work six hours, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. (that’s when they 
all call me!), it may be useful to create a new calendar template named 
Telemarketing. Another reason to create a custom template is that Project’s 
three calendars have no holidays specified. At a minimum, you may need 
to ensure that company holidays are indicated in the calendar you use to 
ensure that Project accurately schedules around those dates.
If you want to save some time when creating a template (and time is what 
this chapter is all about), start with an existing Base calendar template that 
most closely fits your needs. Then, modify it as you like by making changes 
to the working times and calendar options (see the section “Calendar Options 
and Working Times,” earlier in this chapter) to make sure that they’re in 
agreement. After you create a new calendar template, it’s available for you to 
apply in all three calendars: Project, Task, and Resource.
 
Because the Project calendar is the basis of your entire project, it should 
represent the most common working schedule in your project. If only some 
resources in your project work odd hours, change the Resource calendars and 
not the Project calendar.
Follow these steps to create a new calendar template:
 
1. Choose Project➪Change Working Time.
 
 The Change Working Time dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Create New Calendar button.
 
 The Create New Base Calendar dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-9.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Start your 
new calen-
dar here.
 
 
3. In the Name box, type a unique name for the new calendar.

69
 Chapter 3: Mark It on Your Calendar
 
4. Select either the Create New Base Calendar or the Make a Copy of x 
Calendar radio button. Then select an existing Base calendar from the 
list to base your calendar template on.
 
 
If you choose Create New Base Calendar, Project creates a copy of the 
Standard calendar with a new name. If you choose Make a Copy Of 
and select 24 Hours or Night Shift, your new calendar is based on that 
choice. Whichever you choose, it’s your starting point, and you can 
make changes to make the calendar unique after making this choice.
 
5. Click the OK button to return to the Change Working Time dialog box.
 
 Now you make changes to the working time for the new calendar 
template.
 
6. Click the OK button to save the new calendar settings.
 
If you haven’t already done so, be sure to change the calendar options to 
match the working times of the custom calendar you created. You can do this 
from the Change Working Time dialog box using its Options button.
Sharing Copies of Calendars
You can make a calendar available for all projects by using the Organizer. 
The Organizer serves as the control center for custom items such as calen-
dars that you create in your project files. With the Organizer, you can copy 
a custom calendar from one project file into another. Or, you can copy a 
custom calendar into Global.MPT, the behind-the-scenes template that pro-
vides default settings to every new, blank project file you create.
 
You can use regular Windows file copying methods to copy the Global.
MPT file from one user’s system to another’s. Then, all the custom items, like 
custom calendars stored in Global.MPT, become available to the other user. 
This method is especially useful when you want the project managers in your 
company to be using a consistent calendar.
To copy a calendar from one project to another, follow this procedure:
 
1. Open the project to which you want to copy a calendar and the project 
file that holds the custom calendar to copy.
 
2. Choose File➪Info.
 
 The Backstage view opens.
 
3. Click the Organizer button.
 
 The Organizer dialog box appears.
 
4. Click the Calendars tab, as shown in Figure 3-10.

70
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 3-10: 
You can 
copy your 
calendar to 
other 
projects.
 
 
5. From the Calendars Available In drop-down list (lower left), select the 
Project 2010 file that contains the calendar you want to copy.
 
6. In the Calendars Available In drop-down list (lower right), choose 
whether you want to make the calendar available in another currently 
open project (by selecting that project) or the Global template (by 
selecting Global.MPT).
 
7. In the list on the left, click the calendar you want to copy and then 
click the Copy button.
 
 The calendar is copied to the current project.
 
8. If you want to give the calendar a different name, make sure that it is 
selected in the list, click the Rename button, type a new name in the 
Rename dialog box that appears, and then click the OK button.
 
9. Close the Organizer by clicking the Close button (the X) in the upper-
right corner.
 
Here are a few pointers about copying calendars from project to project:
 
✓ Make sure that the name you give the calendar is descriptive. 
Providing an appropriate name helps you remember the calendar’s gen-
eral parameters.
 
✓ If your company has standard calendars, try having one resource 
create and disseminate them. If ten versions of a management calendar 
float around and you grab the wrong one, it can cause problems.
 
✓ Put the project manager’s initials in each calendar template name you 
create. That way, you know which ones you created.

A
 project manager is, by necessity, a taskmaster because tasks form 
the to-do list of your project. Tasks incorporate the What, When, Who, 
and Where information of your plan. Resources work on a project by getting 
assigned to tasks. The timing of tasks and the relationships between them 
form the schedule for your project. By tracking the activity on tasks, you can 
see the progress of your project over time.
You can create tasks in a few different ways: by typing information in the 
sheet area of Gantt Chart view (or any other view that displays information 
in columns) or by using the Task Information dialog box. You can also import 
tasks from Outlook or Excel.
You have to make some choices when you create tasks. For example, you 
have to determine and specify settings for a task that control its timing and 
its priority, as well as certain constraints regarding how its timing may or 
may not shift during the life of your project.
In this chapter, you find out all about tasks and the various settings that give 
each task its own, unique personality.

72
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
User-Controlled Scheduling: 
Manual versus Automatic
One of the most valuable aspects offered by Project has traditionally been 
its ability to recalculate task schedules when you change the project start 
or a change to one task’s schedule affects one or more dependent (linked) 
tasks. This powerful behavior saves the project manager — a.k.a. you — from 
having to rethink and reenter dates to rescheduled tasks throughout your 
project.
But flipsides to the benefits of automation always exist, and in the case of 
project scheduling, straight-up automation can lead to unwanted schedule 
changes based on machine thinking and not human expertise.
To keep the great things about automation that makes scheduling less time 
consuming while allowing project managers to retain schedule control when 
needed, Project 2010 introduces user-controlled scheduling.
With user-controlled scheduling, you can select a scheduling mode for each 
task:
 
✓ With automatically scheduled or autoscheduled tasks, Project continues 
to use its old method of calculating task schedules for you based on the 
project start date and task dependencies.
 
✓ With manually scheduled tasks, Project enables you to skip entering the 
duration and dates and specify them at a later time. You can alternately 
enter information about the duration or dates, as in the example shown 
in Figure 4-1. When you do enter the duration and dates, Project fixes 
the schedule for the task and does not move it unless you do so manu-
ally. (The manually scheduled tasks will move if you reschedule the 
entire project, in most cases.) The Gantt bars for manually scheduled 
tasks also differ in appearance from those for automatically scheduled 
tasks.

and autos-
cheduled 
tasks.

73
 Chapter 4: A Tisket, a Task Kit
 
One difference between the current version’s autoscheduling and the default 
scheduling used in previous versions of Project is that effort-driven schedul-
ing is now turned off by default for new tasks. You find out more about effort-
driven scheduling in the section “1 + 1 = 1⁄2: Effort-Driven Tasks,” later in this 
chapter.
Your project file can have all manually scheduled tasks, all autoscheduled 
tasks, or any mix of the two. By default, all tasks you create will use the man-
ually scheduled mode.
You can either change the task mode for the project overall, or for any indi-
vidual task, as follows:
 
✓ To change the mode for all new tasks, choose Task, click Mode in the 
Tasks group, and then click Auto Schedule or Manually Schedule on the 
menu, as shown in Figure 4-2. Or, you can click New Tasks at the left end 
of the status bar at the bottom of the project.
 
Figure 4-2: 
You can 
change the 
task mode 
for schedul-
ing new 
tasks.
 
 
✓ To change the task mode for an individual new task or a task that 
you’ve previously entered into the schedule, click the Task tab on the 
Ribbon and then click either Manually Schedule or Auto Schedule in 
the Schedule group. Or, in the sheet, click the Task Mode cell for the 
task, click the drop-down arrow that appears, and click either Manually 
Scheduled or Auto Scheduled in the drop-down list.
From there, work with information for the task as described in the rest of this 
chapter. Chapter 6 also provides more of the scoop on how manually sched-
uled tasks with dependencies behave.
 
If Ribbon buttons that you need for a particular action such as choosing the 
task mode are disabled, you’re probably in the wrong view. For example, 
many task-related buttons become disabled if you change to a view that’s pri-
marily for working with resource information. If a button you need for a task-
related activity is inactive, try switching back to Gantt Chart view.

74
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
You will need to balance the desires of your inner control freak versus your 
need to be an efficient project manager in determining how often to use 
manual scheduling. While manual scheduling prevents Project from moving 
tasks that you want to stay put in the schedule, it also means you have the 
potential to need to edit the schedules for dozens of dependent tasks in a long 
or complicated project. The best balance — particularly for beginning project 
managers — may be to use manual scheduling sparingly.
Tackling Your First Task
The first step in creating tasks is to identify the individual action items in 
your project. Then you can create each of those steps as individual tasks in 
Project.
After you create some tasks, you begin to build some structure to your to-do 
list by creating phases that consist of summary tasks with subtasks below 
them in an outline structure. For example, you may have a summary task 
named Permits with two subtasks: Submit Application and Pay Fees.
 
You can find out how to organize tasks into outlines in Chapter 5. All you have 
to focus on in the following sections is making the settings that are required to 
simply create tasks.
Identifying what makes up a task
Determining all the settings that characterize a task is a bit more complicated 
than writing an item on a to-do list. Think of each task in your project as a 
record — like a database record that lists a person’s name, address, birth-
day, and shoe size. In a similar way, a task in Project contains data about that 
task: not only a task name but also other vital data about how that task fits 
into your project.
To create a task, you enter information such as the following:
 
✓ Task name
 
✓ Task duration
 
✓ Task type
 
✓ Task priority
 
✓ Constraints for scheduling the task
Some settings, such as task type (fixed units) and priority (none), can often 
be left at the default settings. Others, such as task duration, almost always 
require some input from you.

75
 Chapter 4: A Tisket, a Task Kit
Pretty much everything that you enter about a task (except the task name 
and resources assigned to the task) involves how the task timing is con-
trolled. Several of these settings work in combination, with Project perform-
ing complex algorithms to set the timing of the task according to the value 
of each setting. Other elements, such as the task finish date, don’t determine 
timing but rather cause Project to display a symbol in the Indicator column 
(the column to the right of the task number column with a small blue circle 
containing an i at the top) to alert you when a task has moved beyond its 
estimated deadline.
 
You can also specify a unique Task calendar in the Task Information dialog 
box; calendars are covered in Chapter 3.
Creating a task
You can create a task, on the simplest level, by entering a name for it. You 
can fill in the details of task duration and task type, for example, at the same 
time or later.
You can enter task names in three ways:
 
✓ Enter names in a Gantt Chart task sheet pane.
 
✓ Enter names in a Task Information dialog box via Gantt Chart view.
 
✓ Import tasks from Excel or Outlook.
Generating tasks in Gantt Chart view
Many people who work on lengthy projects find that entering all task names 
in the sheet pane of Gantt Chart view is the quickest and easiest way to go. 
You can simply enter one task name in the Task Name column, press the 
Enter or down arrow on your keyboard to move to the next blank row, enter 
another task, and so on.
Follow these simple steps to enter a task in Gantt Chart view, after choosing 
the task scheduling method, if applicable:
 
1. In the Task Name column, click a blank cell.
 
2. Type a task name (see Figure 4-3).
 
 You can edit what you type by pressing the Delete or Backspace key to 
clear characters.
 
3. Press the down arrow to move to the next cell in the column and then 
type the next task name.
 
 
When you move to the next task cell, Project automatically assigns a 
sequential task number in the far-left column. This number, called the 
task ID number, is a handy way to identify tasks in larger schedules.

76
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 4-3: 
Enter the 
new task 
name right 
on the task 
sheet.
 
 
4. Repeat Step 3 until you enter all task names.
 
5. Use the Task Mode column to change the task scheduling mode for 
any task that won’t be using the default method.
 
 
You can display whatever columns you like in Gantt Chart view to enter 
additional task information, such as the task type. To display additional 
columns, use the Add New Column column at the far right of the sheet, 
as I describe in Chapter 2.
 
 
The Gantt Chart view’s default Entry table offers the most common task 
information columns. To work with task information in other tables, 
choose View➪Tables and then click the desired table name.
Producing tasks via the Task Information dialog box
If dialog boxes provide the kind of centralized information form that fits 
the way you like to work, consider using the Task Information dialog box to 
enter, well, task information. The series of tabs in this dialog box contain all 
the information about a task.
Follow these steps to create a task via the Task Information dialog box:
 
1. In the Task Name column, double-click a blank cell.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-4. The 
General and Advanced tabs in this dialog box contain various timing set-
tings for the task.
 
2. In the Name field, type a task name.
 
3. Click the OK button to save the new task.
 
 The task name appears in Gantt Chart view in the cell you clicked in Step 1.
 
4. Press the down arrow key to move to the next cell.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1–4 to add as many tasks as you like.
As you name tasks, try to the keep task names in your project both descrip-
tive and unique. However, if you can’t make all the names unique (for exam-
ple, you have three tasks named Hire Staff), you can use the automatically 
assigned task number or the work breakdown structure (WBS) code (see 
Chapter 5) to identify tasks; these numbers are always unique for each task.

tings here.
 
 
To insert a task anywhere within the list of tasks in Project, click a task name 
cell where you want the new task to appear, and press the Insert key on the 
keyboard.
Importing tasks from Outlook
After you get started thinking about what has to be accomplished in your 
project, tasks are like rabbits breeding. What might start as a series of simple 
to-do tasks in Outlook often becomes a full-fledged project with hundreds 
of tasks. When that happens, you’ll be glad to know that Microsoft provides 
an easy-to-use import feature that puts the tasks you create in Outlook into 
Project.
Although the Project import-mapping feature allows you to map fields in a file 
created in another application to fields in Project to import data, the process 
can be tedious. The Import Outlook Tasks feature is essentially an import 
map that’s preset to work with Outlook task fields.
Follow these steps to import Outlook tasks into Project:
 
1. Open the plan that you want to insert tasks into, or open a new project 
(choose File➪New, click Blank Project, and click Create).
 
2. Click the Task tab of the Ribbon, click the bottom part (with the 
down arrow) of the Task button in the Insert group, and click Import 
Outlook Tasks.
 
3. If a Microsoft Outlook warning message box appears, click Allow.
 
 The Import Outlook Tasks dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-5.
 
4. Select the check box beside each task you want to import, or click the 
Select All button to import all Outlook tasks.

By default, Outlook keeps tasks in a Tasks folder. Selecting the check 
box for the Folder: Tasks item is another way to select all tasks in 
Outlook.
 
5. Click the OK button.
 
 The tasks are imported and appear at the end of your list of tasks with 
change highlighting applied.
When you import tasks from Outlook, the task name, any task duration, and 
any task notes are brought over. If a task in Outlook has no duration and you 
have set autoschedule as the project task mode, Project creates the task with 
an estimated one-day time frame.
 
Project 2010 enhances Outlook integration that goes way beyond importing 
tasks. See Chapter 19 for more information.
Importing an Excel task list
I am a firm believer that you should make things easy on yourself. If you like 
to noodle around with your task list for a project in Excel, you shouldn’t have 
to retype everything into Project to build a Project plan. For that reason, 
Microsoft has provided a Microsoft Project Task List Import Template in 
Excel. This template can be opened from the selection of sample templates in 
Backstage view in Excel 2010.
The template provides two Excel worksheets, as shown in Figure 4-6, in 
which you can enter tasks and assigned resources (the second sheet pres-
ents template help) and then export that data from Excel to Project. (A more 
complex template also available in the Excel sample templates, Microsoft 
Project Plan Import Export Template, has three sheets where you can enter 
data plus a fourth info sheet.)

Follow these steps to use this template:
 
1. In Excel 2010, open the template called Microsoft Project Task List 
Import Template.
 
 In Excel, you click the File tab and click New, click Sample Templates 
under Available Templates, and then double-click the icon for the task 
list template.
 
2. Fill in information about Tasks, Resources, and Dates in the appropri-
ate columns, and then save the file.
 
3. Open Project and choose File➪Open.
 
 The Open dialog box appears.
 
4. Choose Excel Workbook from the file type list to the right of the File 
Name box.
 
5. Locate the Excel file you just saved from the template, click it, and 
then click Open.
 
 The Import Wizard appears.
 
6. Click the Next button to begin the wizard.
 
7. Choose the Use Existing Map radio button, and then click the Next 
button.

8. On the next wizard screen, choose Default Task Information in the 
Choose a Map for Your Data list, and then click the Next button.
 
9. On the next wizard screen, choose the method for importing the file 
and then click the Next button.
 
 You can import the file As a New Project, to Append the Data to the 
Active Project, or to Merge the Data into the Active Project. If you 
choose the third option, you have to create a merge key that delineates 
how the data should merge with existing tasks.
 
10. On the next wizard screen, leave the suggested settings for Tasks and 
Import Includes Headers selected and then click the Next button.
 
11. Open the Source Worksheet Name list at the top, and click Task_
Table, the name of the worksheet that holds the data.
 
12. Review the mapping on the next wizard screen, and fix any issues by 
selecting the appropriate fields in the From and To columns.
 
13. Click the Finish button.
 
 The project appears with whatever tasks, resources, and assignment 
information you entered in a project plan format.
Linking to tasks that live somewhere else
You can insert hyperlinks in a project outline, which provides a handy way to 
quickly open another project (or any other type of file you link to, such as a 
Word file).
If desired, you can insert a hyperlink and create a task that you can use to 
represent the timing or costs of another project or subproject in your plan. 
However, you have to enter timing and cost information yourself — it isn’t 
brought over from the hyperlinked project. (Hyperlinks are more often 
used to link to documentation for an existing task, so consider whether this 
approach is the best practice for your needs.)
To insert a hyperlink to another Project file in your project, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Type the name for the new task in a blank task name cell.
 
2. Right-click the new task name cell for which you want the hyperlinked 
task to appear.
 
3. Choose Hyperlink.
 
 The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
4. In the Text to Display box, type the text that you want to appear for 
the hyperlink.
 
 Make sure that this text makes clear what information is being 
summarized.

5. In the Link To area, click the Existing File or Web Page icon.
 
 You can link to a document of any type or to a Web page.
 
6. In the Look In list, locate and select the file to which you want to 
insert a hyperlink.
 
7. Click the OK button.
 
 The link text is inserted, and a hyperlink symbol appears in the Indicator 
field. You can simply click that link symbol to open the other file.
Inserting one project into another
You can also insert tasks from one project into another. You accomplish this 
by inserting an entire, existing project into another project. The project that is 
inserted is known as a subproject. This method is useful when various project 
team members manage different phases of a larger project. The capability to 
assemble subprojects in one place allows you to create a master schedule from 
which you can view, all in one place, all the pieces of a larger, more complex 
project. If you use this procedure, it’s best to create a pool of resources that 
you make available to all the subprojects for resource assignment consistency.
Follow these steps to insert another Project file into your plan:
 
1. In Gantt Chart view, select the task in your task list above which you 
want the other project to be inserted.
 
2. Choose Project➪Subproject.
 
 The Subproject command is in the Insert group. The Insert Project 
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
3. Using the navigation pane and file list, locate the file that you want to 
insert and click it to select it.
 
4. If you want to link to the other file so that any updates to it are 
reflected in the copy of the project you’re inserting, make sure that 
the Link to Project check box is selected.

5. Click the Insert button to insert the file.
 
 The inserted project appears above the task you selected when you 
began the insert process.
 
The inserted project’s highest-level task appears at the level of the task you 
selected when you inserted the project, with all other tasks below it in outline 
order. If you need to, use the Indent and Outdent tools on the Formatting tool-
bar (arrows pointing to the left and right, respectively) to place the inserted 
tasks at the appropriate level in your project. You can find out more about 
how to organize tasks into outlines in Chapter 5.
You’re in It for the Duration
In projects, as in life, timing is everything. Timing in your projects starts with 
the durations that you assign to tasks. Although Project helps you see the 
effect of the timing of your tasks on the overall length of your plan, it can’t 
tell you how much time each task will take; that’s up to you.
Estimating the duration of tasks isn’t always easy; it has to be based on your 
experience with similar tasks and your knowledge of the specifics of your 
project.

83
 Chapter 4: A Tisket, a Task Kit
 
If you often do projects with similar tasks, consider saving a copy of your 
schedule as a template that you can use in the future, thereby saving yourself 
the effort of reestimating durations every time you start a similar project. Find 
out about saving templates in Chapter 17.
Tasks come in all flavors: 
Identifying task types
Before you begin to enter task durations, you need to be aware of the three 
task types. These types have an effect on how Project schedules the work 
of a task using the automatic scheduling mode after you begin assigning 
resources.
Essentially, your choice of task type determines which element of the task 
doesn’t vary when you make changes to the task:
 
✓ Fixed Duration: This task type takes a set amount of time to complete, 
no matter how many resources you add to the mix. For example, a test 
on a substance that requires that you leave the test running for 24 hours 
has a fixed duration, even if you add 20 scientists to oversee the test.
 
✓ Fixed Units: This is the default task type. With this task type, when you 
assign resources to a task with a certain number of units (hours of work 
expressed as a percentage of their working day), the resources’ assign-
ments don’t change, even if you change the duration of the task and the 
work amount.
 
✓ Fixed Work: The number of resource hours assigned to the task deter-
mines its length. If you set the duration of a Fixed Work task at 40 hours, 
for example, and assign two resources to work 20 hours each (simulta-
neously) at units of 100 percent, the task will be completed in 20 hours. 
If you take away one of those resources, the single resource must put 
in 40 hours at units of 100 percent to complete the task. Understanding 
how the choice of task type causes your task timing or resource assign-
ments to fluctuate is an important part of creating an efficient project.
Follow these steps to set the task type:
 
1. Double-click a task.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced tab, if necessary, to display it (see Figure 4-9).
 
3. Choose one of the three options from the Task Type list (see the pre-
ceding list of choices).
 
4. Click the OK button.

84
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 4-9: 
Set the task 
type here.
 
 
You can also display the Type column in a Gantt Chart sheet and make this 
setting there.
Setting task duration
Most tasks in a project have a duration, whether it’s ten minutes or a year or 
something in between. (For milestone tasks, which generally have no dura-
tion, see the next section.) Deciding how finely to break down your tasks can 
affect how efficiently you track progress on those tasks: Tasks that wander 
on for a year are usually too broad, and tasks that take ten minutes are too 
narrow. Whatever your best guess at task duration is, Project can accommo-
date you.
 
If your project is to run a one-day event, getting to the level of ten-minute 
tasks might make sense. In most projects, however, such finely detailed timing 
doesn’t make sense because it defeats the point of all the tracking and report-
ing features of Project. (That’s true unless you have people tracking their 
progress minute by minute, but in that case, what else would they have time 
to do?) On the flip side, creating a 12-month-long task suggests that you may 
be defining your project too broadly to accurately keep track of all that can 
happen in a year.
As with all task information, you can enter a duration in a Gantt Chart sheet 
(see the section “Generating tasks in Gantt Chart view,” earlier in this chap-
ter) or in the Task Information dialog box. Follow these steps to enter a dura-
tion by using the dialog box:
 
1. Double-click a task to display the Task Information dialog box.
 
2. If necessary, click the General tab to display it (refer to Figure 4-4).

85
 Chapter 4: A Tisket, a Task Kit
 
3. In the Duration box, use the spinner arrows to increase or decrease 
the duration.
 
4. If the current duration units aren’t appropriate (for example, days 
when you want hours), type a new duration in the Duration box.
 
 New tasks are created with an estimated duration of one day unless you 
change the duration. You can use the following abbreviations for various 
time units:
 
• m: Minutes
 
• h: Hours
 
• d: Days
 
• w: Weeks
 
• mo: Months
 
 
Don’t assume that changing the start and finish dates of a task changes 
its duration — it doesn’t. You have to manually change the duration; if 
you don’t, your project plan will not be what you intend it to be.
 
5. Click the OK button to accept the duration setting.
 
If you aren’t sure about the timing of a particular task and want to alert people 
to your lack of certainty or if you need a way to find such tasks and enter more 
solid timing when you have better information, select the Estimated check box 
(on the General tab) when you enter the duration. Then apply a filter for tasks 
with estimated durations (see Chapter 15 for more about using filters).
Setting tasks with no duration: Milestones
I mention in the preceding section that almost all tasks have durations; the 
exception is a milestone — a task with no duration. (Now, that’s the type I 
like to be assigned to.) In fact, milestones are less like tasks than they are 
like signposts that mark moments in time. Examples of milestones are the 
approval of a prototype (although the deliberations to make that decision 
might have taken months) and the completion of a phase of tests.
Some people include tasks such as Design Complete or Testing Complete at 
the end of each phase of their project. They can then create timing relation-
ships to the moment of completion — for example, allowing the production 
of a drug to proceed after the testing and approval is complete. Such mile-
stones also alert you and your team members to a moment of progress in 
your project that can help to keep the team motivated.

86
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
New tasks are created with an estimated duration of one day unless you enter 
a duration. To create a milestone, you indicate that the task has zero duration. 
The quickest way to do that is to simply type 0 in the Duration column in 
Gantt Chart view. Or, you can click the Advanced tab of the Task Information 
dialog box (refer to Figure 4-9) and select the Mark Task as Milestone check 
box. When you do, the milestone is designated in Gantt Chart view with a 
black diamond shape rather than a task bar. Use this latter method for any 
milestone that does have a duration but that you want to mark as a milestone 
anyway; its milestone marker will be charted at the end of the duration period 
on the Gantt chart.
Showing up again and again: 
Recurring tasks
Some tasks occur repeatedly in projects. For example, attending a monthly 
project debriefing or generating a quarterly project report is considered a 
recurring task.
No one wants to create all the tasks for the monthly debriefing in a project 
that will take a year to complete. Instead, you can designate the recurrence, 
and Project automatically creates the 12 tasks for you.
Here’s how you create a recurring task:
 
1. Click the Task tab on the Ribbon, click the bottom part of the Task 
button (with the down arrow) in the Insert group, and then click 
Recurring Task.
 
 The Recurring Task Information dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 4-10.
 
Figure 4-10: 
When you 
enter this 
informa-
tion, Project 
creates 
multiple 
occurrences 
of a task 
automati-
cally.
 
 
2. In the Task Name box, type a name for the task.

87
 Chapter 4: A Tisket, a Task Kit
 
3. In the Duration box, click the spinner arrows to set a duration or type 
a duration, such as 10d for 10 days. Edit the abbreviation to specify a 
different time unit, if needed.
 
 
You can read about the abbreviations you can use for units of duration — 
such as h for hours — in the earlier section “Setting task duration.”
 
4. Select a recurrence pattern by selecting the Daily, Weekly, Monthly, 
or Yearly option.
 
 What you select here provides different options for the rest of the recur-
rence pattern.
 
5. Depending on the selections offered to you, make choices for the rest 
of the pattern.
 
 For example, if you select the Weekly option, you must choose a Recur 
Every x Week(s) On setting and then choose a day such as Friday. Or, if 
you select Monthly, you must specify which day of every month the task 
is to recur.
 
6. In the Range of Recurrence area, type a date in the Start box. Then 
select and fill in either the End After or End By option.
 
 For example, you might start on January 1 and end after 12 occurrences 
to create a task that occurs every month for a year.
 
7. Click the OK button to save the recurring task.
If your settings cause a task to fall on a nonworking day (for example, if you 
choose to meet on the eighth day of every month and the eighth day is a 
Sunday in one of those months), a dialog box appears, asking you how to 
handle this situation. You can choose not to create the task, or you can let 
Project adjust the day to the next working day in that period.
 
To assign resources to a recurring task, you have to assign the resources to 
the individual recurrences, not the “summary” recurring task. If you assign 
resources to the summary recurring task, Project will not calculate the hours 
of work correctly.
Starting and Pausing Tasks
When most people start using Project, one of the first things they try to 
do is enter a start date for every task in their project. After all, you always 
include dates when you write a to-do list, right? Well, for one thing, you’re 
jumping the gun — and missing out on one of the great strengths of project 
management software: the capability to schedule tasks for you according to 
sometimes-complex combinations of factors, such as dependencies between 
tasks and task constraints. By allowing Project to determine the start date of 
a task, you allow it to make adjustments automatically when changes occur.

88
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
If you enter a task duration and don’t enter a start date for an automatically 
scheduled task, that task starts by default as soon as possible after the proj-
ect start date you set in the Project Information dialog box, based on any 
dependencies you set up between tasks. For manually scheduled tasks, you 
do eventually have to specify a start date to set the beginning schedule for 
the task.
Typically, to establish a task’s start date, you look for something in the proj-
ect that would dictate its timing. For example, if you don’t want construction 
to begin until you obtain permits, set a dependency between the permits task 
and the construction task in such a way that construction can’t start before 
the permit task ends.
Certain tasks, however, must start on a specific date. Examples are a holiday, 
an annual meeting, or the start of the fishing season.
 
Project sets the finish date of a task based on when that task starts as well as 
the task duration. If a task must finish on a certain date, however, you can set 
a finish date and let Project determine the start date.
Entering the task start date
Setting a start date or a finish date for a task applies a kind of constraint on 
it that can override dependency relationships or other timing factors. Task 
constraints, discussed in the upcoming “Controlling Timing with Constraints” 
section, are the preferred way to force a task to start or end on a certain day. 
If you determine, however, that a particular task must begin or end on a set 
date no matter what, you can enter a specific start or finish date. Setting the 
start or finish date is simple.
To enter a start or finish date for a task, simply follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click a task.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the General tab if it’s not already displayed; refer to Figure 4-4.
 
3. Click the arrow on the Start or Finish box.
 
 A calendar appears.
 
4. Click a date to select it, or click the forward or backward arrow to 
move to a different month and select a date.
 
 If the current date is the date you want, use the shortcut of clicking the 
Today button on the drop-down calendar.
 
5. Click the OK button.

89
 Chapter 4: A Tisket, a Task Kit
 
Setting a start date isn’t quite as strong a factor in how Project determines 
timing as applying the Must Start On constraint. You can find out more about 
how constraints work in the “Controlling Timing with Constraints” section, 
later in this chapter.
Taking a break: Splitting tasks
Did you ever start something — your taxes, for example — and find that you 
just had to drop everything before you were done and go do something else? 
(In the case of taxes, I usually need a break for a good cry.)
It’s the same in projects. Sometimes tasks start and then you have to put 
them on hold before they can start again later — for example, if you experi-
ence a work shutdown due to labor negotiations. Or, perhaps you can antici-
pate a delay in the course of a task and want to structure it that way when 
you create it. In that case, you can use a Project feature to split a task so that 
a second or third portion starts at a later date, with no activity between. You 
can place as many splits in a task as you like.
Follow these steps to split a task:
 
1. Click the Split Task button in the Schedule group on the Task tab of 
the Ribbon.
 
 A box appears, as shown in Figure 4-11. The box provides a readout to 
guide you as you set the start date for the continuation of the task.
 
2. Move the mouse pointer over the task bar on the Gantt chart and 
adjust the pointer’s position until the box displays the date where you 
want to start the split for the task, and then drag right until the box 
contains the date on which you want the task to begin again.
 
3. Release the mouse button.
 
 The task is split.
 
You can rejoin a split task by placing your mouse over the taskbar until the 
move cursor appears and then dragging the split taskbar back to join with the 
other portion of the taskbar.
 
Don’t use the split-task approach to put an artificial hold on a task until some 
other task is complete. Suppose that you start testing a product but then have 
to wait for final approval before finalizing the test results. In that case, you 
should create a Testing task, a Final Approval milestone, and a Finalize Test 
Results task — and then create dependency relationships among them. That 
way, if one task runs late, your final task shifts along with it instead of being 
set in stone (as a split task can be).

start date

tinuation of 
the task.
 
1 + 1 = 1/2: Effort-Driven Tasks
When you hear the word effort in Project, you can think work. For a task 
that is automatically scheduled, you also can set it up to be effort driven, 
which means that if you adjust resource assignments, the duration might 
change but the number of hours of effort (work) resources needed to put in 
to complete the task stays the same. (Effort-driven scheduling is not avail-
able at all for manually scheduled tasks.) When you add or delete a resource 
assignment on an effort-driven task, work is spread around equally among 
resources.
Here’s how an effort-driven task works. Suppose that you have a two-day task 
to set up a computer network in a new office. You assign one resource to the 
task, working 8 hours a day, so it will take 16 hours to complete the work 
(two 8-hour days). If you then assign a second resource, the task no longer 
takes two days because the hours of effort required will be completed more 
quickly by the two people working simultaneously — in this case, in one 
8-hour period.
Behind the scenes, effort-driven scheduling uses the formula D=W/U (dura-
tion equals work divided by units) to work this “magic.” After you make the 
first assignment, any time you add or remove more people (units), Project 
recalculates the duration accordingly.

91
 Chapter 4: A Tisket, a Task Kit
 
If you assign multiple resources at once when you make the first assignment 
to the task, Project does not adjust the task duration, even when effort-driven 
scheduling is enabled for the task. Effort-driven scheduling only kicks in when 
you add additional resources after assigning the first one(s).
An example of a task that is not effort driven is attending a daylong seminar. 
No matter how many people attend or how many people are present, the 
seminar takes one day to complete.
Effort Driven is a simple check box choice on the Advanced tab in the Task 
Information dialog box (refer to Figure 4-9). Select this check box to enable 
or disable the Effort Driven setting; it’s not selected by default. When you 
clear this setting, the same task that you set to run two days takes two days, 
no matter how much effort your resources put in. In other words, adding 
resources doesn’t cause the task to be completed sooner.
Controlling Timing with Constraints
A constraint is more than something you’re forced to live with, such as dan-
druff or noisy neighbors. In Project, constraints are timing conditions that 
control an automatically scheduled task. You tell Project what, if anything, 
to constrain for each task. Because manually scheduled tasks must follow 
the start and finish dates you specify for them, they are already de facto 
constrained.
Understanding how constraints work
When you create a task and set it to be automatically scheduled, the As Soon 
As Possible constraint is selected by default. In other words, the task starts 
as soon as the project starts, assuming that no dependencies with other 
tasks exist that would delay its start.
Task start and finish dates — working with dependencies, the task type, the 
Effort Driven setting, and constraints — set the timing of each task. However, 
when Project performs calculations to try to save you time in a project that’s 
running late, it considers constraints to be the most sacred timing settings. 
For example, if you set a constraint that a task must finish on a certain date, 
Project shifts around almost any other task in a schedule in recalculating 
timing before it suggests that that task might finish on another date.
 
Here’s a word to the wise: Use constraints only when you absolutely need to 
force a task’s timing.
Table 4-1 lists all the constraints and shows an explanation of their effects on 
your task’s timing.

92
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Table 4-1 
Task Constraints
Constraint
Effect
As Soon As Possible
The default setting; the task starts as early in the sched-
ule as possible based on dependencies and the project 
start date.
As Late As Possible
The task occurs as late as possible in your schedule, 
based on dependencies and the project finish date.
Finish No Earlier Than
The end of the task cannot occur any earlier than the 
date you specify.
Finish No Later Than
The end of the task cannot occur any later than the date 
you specify.
Must Finish On
The task must finish on an absolute date.
Must Start On
The task must start on an absolute date.
Start No Earlier Than
The task cannot start any earlier than the date you 
specify.
Start No Later Than
The task cannot start any later than the date you specify.
Establishing constraints
You can set only one constraint for a task. Setting a constraint involves 
selecting the type of constraint you want in the Task Information dialog box. 
Some constraints work together with a date you choose. For example, if you 
want a task to start no later than a certain date, you need to select a date by 
which the task must start. Other settings, such as As Soon As Possible, work 
off a different date — in this case, the start date you set for the whole project 
or any dependency relationships you set up with other tasks. (See Chapter 6 
for more about dependency relationships.)
To set a task constraint, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click a task.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced tab; refer to Figure 4-9.
 
3. Select a constraint from the Constraint Type list.
 
4. If the constraint requires a date, select one from the Constraint Date 
list.
 
5. Click the OK button to save the settings.

93
 Chapter 4: A Tisket, a Task Kit
Setting a deadline
I don’t know about you, but sometimes I think deadlines were made to be 
overlooked. Project agrees because, strictly speaking, deadlines aren’t con-
straints (although the setting for the deadline is in the Constraint Task area 
of the Task Information dialog box, on the Advanced tab). Deadlines aren’t 
the same as constraints because they don’t force the timing of your task 
schedules. If you set a deadline, it simply causes Project to display a symbol 
in the Indicator column if the task has run past the deadline to alert you so 
that you can panic (I mean, take action) appropriately.
To set a deadline, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click a task.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced tab; refer to Figure 4-9.
 
3. Click the arrow in the Deadline field to display a calendar, and then 
select a date.
 
 If necessary, use the forward or backward arrow to move to a different 
month.
 
4. Click the OK button to save the deadline setting.
 
You can also display a deadline column in your Gantt Chart sheet pane to 
enter the deadline or to show yourself and others what your targeted deadline 
date is.
Deleting Tasks and Using Inactive Tasks
If your style is to go into a lot of planning detail for everything you do, you 
may tend to overanalyze and add more tasks than you really need to track in 
a project plan. In such cases, when you’re refining the project plan, you may 
decide that you need to delete a task or two to tighten up the plan. To delete 
a task, click its row (Task ID) number at the left side of the sheet and press 
Delete.
 
Project doesn’t display a warning or ask you to confirm deleting a task, so 
make sure that you really mean it when you press Delete. If you screw up, 
press Ctrl+Z immediately to reinstate the deleted task. Also, be sure to check 
that any task dependencies (links) adjust as needed after you delete the task.

94
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
The Professional Edition of Project 2010 includes a new twist on deleting a 
task. You can instead mark a task as inactive. Doing this leaves the task vis-
ible in the plan, but strikes it out in the task sheet and on the Gantt chart, as 
shown in Figure 4-12. If any automatically scheduled tasks were dependent 
on the inactive task, Project ignores the now-inactive task when calculating 
the schedules for those other tasks. Leaving an inactive task in the schedule 
provides another opportunity to track and document what happened. For 
example, you can add a note explaining why the task was removed, such as 
if the deliverables for the project were reduced, eliminating the need for cer-
tain tasks.
Follow these steps to mark a task as inactive:
 
1. In Gantt Chart view, select the task to make inactive.
 
2. Click the Inactivate button in the Schedule group on the Task tab of 
the Ribbon.
 
 Project immediately reformats the task as inactive.

Making a Task Note
Despite the wealth of information that you can enter about a task and its 
timing, not everything can be said with settings. That’s why every task 
includes an area to enter notes. You may use this feature, for example, 
to enter some background information about changes in timing or other 
changes that occur during the schedule, or to list vendor contact information 
relevant to the task.
To enter task notes, do the following:
 
1. Double-click a task.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click to select the Notes tab (as shown in Figure 4-13).
 
Figure 4-13: 
Enter useful 
information 
about the 
task here.
 
 
3. In the Notes area, type any information you like.
 
 You can enter contact information, notes about resources, or other 
useful information about the task.
 
4. Format the note.
 
 Click the buttons at the top of the Notes area to change the font. You 
can also
 
• Left-align, center, or right-align text
 
• Format text as a bulleted list
 
• Insert an object
 
5. Click the OK button to save the note(s).

Saving Your Project — and Your Tasks
After you have some tasks in your project, don’t lose ’em! It’s a good idea to 
save your project regularly.
You save a Project file by using the same process you’ve used hundreds of 
times to save files in other software applications.
If you’ve previously saved and named the file, just click the Save button on 
the Quick Access toolbar or choose File➪Save. No muss, no fuss — your 
changes are preserved.
If you want to save changes to a previously saved Project file by using a dif-
ferent filename or file format (for example saving as an Excel spreadsheet or 
a Project template), choose File➪Save As and provide a new filename or file 
type at the bottom of the Save As dialog box.
To save a Project file under a new name, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-14. If you use other 
software, you’ve probably seen this dialog box about 2 million times.
 
Figure 4-14: 
Save your 
project with 
a new name 
here.
 
 
2. From the navigation pane, locate the folder in which you want to save 
the file.

 Chapter 4: A Tisket, a Task Kit
 
3. In the File Name box, type a name.
 
4. Click the Save button.
 
If you want to share your file with others and you have Project Server set up in 
your organization, you can do so by using Project Web App to publish the file 
online. See Chapter 19 for the lowdown on this useful collaborative tool.
Task Information in Action: Planning 
Your Next Space Launch
If you want to tie together all the task-setting information covered in this 
chapter, you can look at it in the context of a specific project. Suppose that 
you’re managing a space shuttle launch and you have these main tasks:
 
✓ Train personnel
 
✓ Launch public relations
 
✓ Check equipment
 
✓ Launch operation
Under the public relations task, suppose that you have three subtasks:
 
✓ Write press releases
 
✓ Hold press conference
 
✓ Set up interviews with astronauts
Your first step is to choose a task mode for each task. You can decide which 
tasks should be scheduled manually and which need to be scheduled 
automatically.
Next, set durations for each task. They’re determined to a great extent by 
your experience with similar projects, but suppose that you determine that 
writing press releases will take two days, a press conference will take two 
hours, and setting up interviews will take three days. You enter these dura-
tions in one of two locations: in the Durations column or in each individual 
Task Information dialog box.
Moving on, you have to determine the task types. Write Press Releases is an 
effort-driven, fixed-work task. (If you get somebody to help you, it takes less 
time to complete the work.) Hold Press Conference, on the other hand, has a 
fixed timing (after two hours, you cut off the press); in this case, it’s a fixed-
duration task. Finally, Set Up Interviews with Astronauts could be a fixed-
units task: It takes a certain number of hours to make all the phone calls and 

98
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
arrangements, but when the arrangements are done, you may still want the 
resources available for confirmations or to deal with changes. With a fixed-
units task (which is the Project default), completing the number of units of 
work doesn’t change the resource hours you assigned.
Finally, what constraints may you apply to these tasks? Although I’m not a 
fan of applying too many constraints to any project, here are a couple of 
possibilities:
 
✓ The press conference might take place no later than the task to launch 
the shuttle. After the shuttle has left Earth, the press conference to brief 
the press on the mission must already have been completed.
 
✓ You could set the interviews with astronauts so that they must start on 
the day before the launch — when the members of the media hold the 
most interest in the event and the astronauts are still available.
If, in the end, the entire launch is scrubbed because of unexpected weather 
or a faulty hatch door, won’t you be glad that you used the Project depen-
dency structure to cause all tasks to move out when you change the start 
date for the project for the sixth time?

ertain things bring order to the universe: clocks, stop signs, and out-
lines, to name just a few. Whereas clocks bring order to time and stop 
signs bring order to rush hour, outlines bring order to information by impos-
ing a hierarchy. An outline breaks down one idea or topic or category of 
information into smaller units with some logical sequence.
Project uses an outline structure to organize tasks in your project, as well 
as tools and functionality to help you build, reorganize, and view the outline 
structure. Learning how to create an outline is something you did back in 
Mrs. Plotkin’s fourth-grade English class, and now, showing you how to use 
an outline to organize the many tasks in your project is my job. Welcome to 
Outlining 101.
Summary Tasks and Subtasks
When you take a look at a project outline, such as the one shown in Figure 
5-1, you see that it organizes tasks into levels; each level represents a phase 
of your project. A task that has other tasks indented below it in this outline 
structure is a parent task, or summary task. The tasks indented below it are 
child tasks, or subtasks. Summary tasks are indicated in bold in your Project 
outline. You can tell when a summary task has a family of subtasks clinging to 
its skirts: When a subtask is hidden, a little plus-sign symbol is displayed next 
to its summary task. When you click the plus sign, the task expands to show 
its whole clan of subtasks.

100
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 5-1: 
A project 
outline is a 
collection 
of subtasks 
nested 
within sum-
mary tasks.
 
You can build several of these little families of tasks to represent project 
phases in your outline. Think of a project outline as a set of little wooden 
nesting dolls, with each successively smaller doll representing a deeper level 
of detail. The highest-level task is the outer doll, which is the biggest of the 
bunch. The next doll in the group is a little smaller, just as the next level of 
tasks in an outline reflects a little narrower level of detail, and so on, right 
down to the littlest baby doll. The largest task in a project may be Build New 
Plant, and the smallest detailed task may be Empty Dumpster, with a whole 
lot of tasks in between.
Project phases
All information about a family of tasks (that is, a phase of your project) is 
rolled up into its highest-level summary task. Therefore, any task with sub-
tasks has no timing or cost information of its own: It usually gets its total 
duration and cost from the sum of its parts.
You can, though, assign resources and costs to a summary task; for example, 
you might assign a project manager for an entire phase of tasks. However, a 
summary task also includes the total of the costs of any tasks below it.

101
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Outline in Line
This roll-up functionality is cumulative: The lowest-level task rolls up to its 
parent, which might roll up into another summary task, which rolls up (for 
example) into a project summary task. Any task with tasks below it gets 
its duration and cost information from its subtasks, no matter how deeply 
nested it may be in the hierarchy.
 
The structure of phases in an outline is also useful when you need to reorga-
nize an outline: When you move a summary task, all its subtasks come right 
along for the ride!
If a summary task is manually scheduled, the roll-up functionality doesn’t 
work, and Project will display warnings telling you so. The Gantt bar for the 
summary task will have a red warning bar that shows you the calculated 
duration for the subtasks when they don’t match up with the summary task’s 
duration. The summary task’s Finish field entry will also have a red squiggly 
underline to indicate a potential scheduling problem. To deal with this situa-
tion, you can change the summary task to use auto scheduling, in which case 
it will calculate roll-up data correctly. If you want the summary task to con-
tinue to be manually scheduled, you can edit its finish date or use the Task 
Inspector as described in Chapter 10 to fix the summary task schedule.
How many levels can you go?
You have no practical limit on how many levels of tasks you can create in an 
outline. Project enables you to indent to more levels of detail than you’ll need 
for all but the most complex schedules. Remember, though: At some point, 
you have to deal with assigning timing and resources to each of these tasks — 
and then track their progress. Too much detail can make your project plan 
difficult to manage. For example, if your project is a few months long, you 
don’t want to be tracking to a level where activities last only minutes or (in 
most cases) hours.
Also, if you find that you build in three, four, or five levels of detail through-
out your plan, consider that you might really be building several projects at a 
time. Having too many levels suggests that a few of these project phases may 
be more manageable if you break them off and make them projects on their 
own — with their own project managers. Unless you want the maintenance of 
your Project plan to become a project in and of itself, don’t overdo the level 
of detail in your outline; two or three levels are usually sufficient.
The One-and-Only Project Summary Task
Just as a ship has only one captain, only one task summarizes all other tasks 
in each project. I strongly suggest that you display the project summary task, 
which represents the highest (least detailed) level of information and is often 

102
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
simply the title of the project, such as New Product Rollout or Space Shuttle 
Launch. When you tell Project to display the project summary task, every 
task in the project falls under it in the outline, as shown in Figure 5-2. You can 
see in the figure that task 0, New Fitness Center Staffing, is the project sum-
mary task. Notice that the bar for the project summary task on the chart is 
gray, while the bars for regular summary tasks are black.
When you think about it, an upper-level headline in an outline is the sum of 
its parts; the headline reflects the overall topic for all the items below it. The 
project summary task takes this concept a step further: This task rolls up all 
the actual data from other tasks into one line item. Thus, the project summary 
task’s duration reflects the duration of the entire project. From a monetary 
angle, the project summary task’s total cost reflects the total costs for the 
entire project. Figures like these can be handy to have at your fingertips — 
and that’s one value of a summary task.
 
If you’re confused about the length of your summary task, remember that the 
summary task duration is the difference between the earliest task start date 
and latest task end date. However, nonworking days aren’t counted in the 
summary task duration. The length of the summary task, therefore, equals the 
number of days of work over the course of the subtasks, not the number of 
calendar days between the start of the first task and end of the last.

103
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Outline in Line
Not everyone uses project summary tasks. You can simply create, at the 
highest level of your outline, tasks that represent major project phases — 
with subphases and subtasks below them — and not create one task that’s 
higher in the order than all others. However, my advice is to always have a 
project summary task, for two reasons:
 
✓ You can quickly view totals for the project at a glance in the columns 
of data in Gantt Chart view and other views.
 
✓ You can place a link to your project summary task in another project 
so that all data for one project is reflected in another. For example, 
if you create five schedules for new product launches in your com-
pany, you can easily create a master schedule for all company product 
launches by linking to the project summary tasks in each of the projects. 
(Neat, huh?)
As you build your project, you can easily create a project summary task 
yourself (indent other tasks beneath it) or use a Project feature to generate 
one automatically at any time — even after you build all the phases of your 
project. To have Project automatically display a project summary task, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Options.
 
 The Project Options dialog box appears.
 
2. Click Advanced in the list at the left to display the advanced options.
 
3. Scroll down until you can see the Display Options for This Project 
section.
 
4. Select the Show Project Summary Task option.
 
5. Click the OK button to display the upper-level task.
 
You also can use the Ribbon to display or hide the project summary task. In 
Gantt Chart view, click the Gantt Chart Tools Format contextual tab. Then, in 
the Show/Hide group, click the Project Summary Task check box.
Structuring the Project’s Outline
If you already read the first few pages of this chapter, your tantalizing 
glimpse of how outlines work in Project has doubtlessly left you eager to 
start building your own, but project outlines take a little up-front thought. 
You have to settle two important matters about your project before you start 
building a logical project outline:

104
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
✓ The goal: What do you want to achieve at the completion of your proj-
ect? Is your goal to manage an entire space shuttle mission? Then you 
need as many tasks as it takes to get from here to splashdown. If your 
goal is only to launch the space shuttle, however, your focus is nar-
rower, and the level of detail of certain tasks will probably be different.
 
✓ The scope: Scope is a little more specific than the goal. Do you want 
to build a new warehouse from scratch, outfit it with equipment and 
furniture, and deal with moving people into their offices by December 1 
within a budget of $20 million? Or, is the scope of your project to hook 
up the computer network by November 1 within a budget of $50,000? 
Understanding what your overall deliverables are helps you further 
define where to start and stop your project.
 
To help you to sketch the early draft of your project, Project lets you create a 
proposal schedule with major deliverables and no specific tasks. See Chapter 
6 for more about deliverables and proposals.
Look around your own office: You’ll be surprised to find that many projects 
that go off track never had a clear goal. In fact, entering project data into 
project management software is a waste of time if you don’t know what your 
mission is. Go ahead: Ask three people working on the same project in your 
company to state the goal of the project. I would bet the farm that you get 
three different answers. For an IT project, for example, the IT director might 
tell you the goal is to reduce tech support calls, the project manager might 
say the goal is to upgrade all server software to the latest version, and the 
technician might specify that the goal is to get all the software installed by 
next Thursday. (Sound familiar?)
To define a goal and scope for your project, answer these questions:
 
✓ For a goal:
 
• What will be different when the project is complete?
 
• What will the project achieve or deliver? Will a building be built, a 
workforce trained, or a space shuttle launched?
 
✓ For the scope:
 
• What will the project cost?
 
• How many people will be involved?
 
• Whom does the project affect: A workgroup, division, company, or 
clients?
 
• What deadlines does the project have?

105
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Outline in Line
Everything but the kitchen 
sink: What to include
After you have a clear picture of your project goal and the scope of the work 
to be done, you can begin to think about what your outline should contain. 
For example, here’s the first of three approaches to an outline of tasks for 
planning a company party:
 
I. Send invitations
 
II. Reserve Conference Room B
 
III. Order food
Perhaps a little more detail would be helpful:
 
I. Company Christmas party
 
 A. 
Invitations
 
  
1. 
Design invitations
 
  
2.

1. 
And so on . . .
Which one of these outlines is best for this project? That depends on how 
complex these arrangements are — and on how narrowly you define the 
project. Are you planning the entire year of company events or only one 
party? How many people will perform the tasks and over what period of time? 
Will one person research, budget, and hire the caterers in a single hour? If 
so, a single task — Hire Caterer — may be enough. Will one person do the 
research, another set the budget, and another hire the caterer — and might 
these tasks be separated by days (or even weeks)? If so, having several tasks 
may be the way to go.
If one task must happen before another can start, you may have to break 
down the tasks to reflect the causality between certain events. For example, 
if you can’t begin a new manufacturing process before people are trained, it’s 
probably not prudent to lump training and the implementation of the new 
process into a single task.

107
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Outline in Line
 
Too little detail may let some tasks slip through the cracks, while too much 
detail may cause your project team to be inefficient, spending more time 
reporting progress and breaking down activities than doing the work. Here’s 
the bottom line: When you understand the scope of your project and the rela-
tionship of each task as you create your project outline, you’re likely to build 
in the right level of detail.
Building the outline
People approach building a project outline in different ways. Some create all 
the tasks they can think of in random order and then promote and demote 
tasks to different levels and move them around to appear in the correct 
order. Other people create upper-level tasks first and then go back and fill in 
details below each task. Still other people work one phase at a time, by creat-
ing one upper-level task and filling in every possible task underneath it. Then 
they go on to the next phase and create every task under that, and so on.
The approach that you use depends to some extent on how you think. Some 
people think chronologically, and others group like information. You eventu-
ally have to deal with all levels of structure in your final outline, but which 
level you tackle first is up to you.
Moving Tasks All around Your Outline
You discover how to create tasks in Chapter 4. In the following sections, you 
move those tasks around to create the outline structure. If you use any word 
processing outlining feature, this stuff is pretty easy. If this is new turf for 
you, it’s still easy!
The outdent-and-indent shuffle
Outdenting and indenting are the functions that you use to move tasks to 
higher or lower levels of detail in your outline. In some software programs, 
these terms are promoting and demoting, respectively:
 
✓ Outdenting a task moves it up a level in the outline (literally shifting it 
to the left in the outline). When outdented, a task is moved to a higher 
level of detail; in other words, it’s less detailed. Because the top-level 
tasks are already at the highest level, you can’t outdent them.
 
✓ Indenting a task moves it down a level in the outline (literally indenting 
the task to the right in the outline) and puts it at a deeper level of detail. 
Whenever you indent one or more tasks, the task above becomes the 
summary task.

108
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
You use tools in the Schedule group of the Task tab of the Ribbon (shown in 
Figure 5-3) to outdent and indent tasks in a project outline. The Outdent Task 
tool has is a left-facing arrow; the Indent Task tool has a right-facing arrow.
 
You can outdent and indent tasks from several different views, even Network 
Diagram view. However, seeing the effect in Network Diagram view is tricky, 
and I recommend using Gantt Chart view when manipulating tasks in an out-
line structure.
 
If you use an outlining feature in other software, you may be tempted to press 
Tab to indent a task in an outline and Shift+Tab to outdent a task. In Project, 
though, don’t use these methods. It doesn’t cause disaster, but it doesn’t do 
you much good either. It only moves your cursor from one column to the 
other in a columnar view (like Gantt Chart view). And in Network Diagram 
view, it moves the cursor from field to field in a single task box.
To outdent or indent a task, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that the task that will become the summary task (the task 
above any task you indent) is set to be automatically scheduled if 
that’s what you want.

Click these 
tools to 
move a task 
in or out in 
the outline.
 
Outdent Task and Indent Task tools

109
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Outline in Line
 
 See the section “Using a Manually Scheduled Summary Task to Plan from 
the Top Down,” later in this chapter, to find out more about why this 
makes a difference.
 
2. Click a task in a columnar view to select it.
 
3. Click the Outdent Tasks or Indent Tasks button according to what 
action you want to take.
 
 If the tasks you are indenting are autoscheduled, Project may convert 
the summary task above to be an autoscheduled task if it was previously 
manually scheduled. Always check to ensure that the summary task 
behaves as you wanted and expected when you indent tasks.
 
You can build the outline even faster by indenting multiple tasks at once. 
Drag to select multiple task IDs and then indent them. You can also use the 
standard Shift+click and Ctrl+click selection methods to select multiple tasks 
in a Project outline. Shift+click the task IDs to select contiguous tasks, and use 
Ctrl+click to select discrete tasks.
Moving tasks up and down
A maxim of project management says that things change: Tasks that you 
thought you could do early on can’t happen yet because the people, materi-
als, or money are in short supply. Or, a task that you thought you couldn’t 
start until next July gets bumped up in priority when your customer changes 
his mind (again) about deliverables. Because of this changeability, when you 
enter tasks in a project outline, odds are that you’ll need to move those tasks 
around at some point. You can move subtasks to other phases of the outline 
by simply dragging them.
You should understand that moving a task can change its outline level. A task 
retains its level in the outline only when you move the task to follow a task 
at the same level. (Okay, there’s an exception, which I get to in a minute.) 
Comparatively, if you move a lower-level task to a section of tasks at a higher 
level — for example, move a third-level task to a section of second-level tasks — 
the moved task takes on the level of the task preceding it. And the converse 
is true when you move a higher-level task to follow a lower-level task.
The exception I hinted at happens when you move a lower-level task to follow 
a summary task. For example, a second-level task that you move to immedi-
ately follow a summary task stays at the second level rather than taking on 
the summary task level of the task that now precedes it because there’s only 
one summary task.

Using the drag-and-drop method
If you ask me, drag-and-drop is to computing what the remote control is to 
television. It’s a quick, no-brainer method of moving stuff around in software 
that just makes life simpler. Here’s an example: The quickest way to move a 
task in an outline is to use the drag-and-drop method.
To move a task up and down with the drag-and-drop method, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Display a columnar view, such as Gantt Chart view.
 
2. Select a task by clicking its task ID number.
 
3. Drag the task to where you want it to appear in the outline.
 
 A gray line appears, indicating the new task position, as shown in 
Figure 5-4.
 
4. When the gray line is located where you want to insert the task, 
release the mouse button.
 
 The task appears in its new location. If you want the task to be at a dif-
ferent level of the outline, you can now indent or outdent it as needed.

 Chapter 5: Getting Your Outline in Line
 
As for indenting tasks, you can select multiple tasks and then move or copy 
them.
Using the cut-and-paste (or copy-and-paste) method
Dragging and dropping works fine in most cases, but in very large projects — 
with a few hundred or more tasks, for example — this method can be like 
dragging a peanut to Tibet: It’s not the process; it’s the distance you have to 
travel.
In a larger outline, simply use the cut-and-paste method to move tasks:
 
1. Select a task by clicking its task ID number.
 
2. Click the Cut button in the Clipboard group on the Task tab.
 
 The task is removed from its current location and placed on the 
Windows Clipboard.
 
3. Scroll to display the location where you want the task to appear.
 
4. Click the task after which you want to insert the task.
 
5. Click the top part of the Paste button, also on the Task tab.
If you want to insert a copy of a task in a project outline, you can follow the 
preceding steps and click Copy rather than Cut.
 
If you’re cutting and copying only a single cell and not a whole task, click in 
the cell rather than clicking the task ID number.
Using a Manually Scheduled Summary 
Task to Plan from the Top Down
It’s the nature of the beast when you’re a project manager to be put on the 
spot, starting from the beginning of the planning process. Stakeholders often 
want to see the plan in advance, but you often haven’t yet had the opportu-
nity to flesh out how hundreds of tasks are going to flow. And you don’t want 
to put bad information out there and be held accountable for it later.
Under the automatic method of scheduling, which as you may know is the 
only method available in previous Project versions, Project calculates each 
summary task schedule based on the schedules for its subtasks. Sure, you 
can fudge it and create a schedule with tasks representing summary tasks 
and durations, but you have to be pretty careful in reworking such a file to 
ensure that it matches with the timings you originally presented.

112
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Project 2010’s new manual scheduling method, which I introduce in Chapter 
4, enables you to sketch out a project from the top down by selecting when 
you want each summary task to occur. You can then add in subtasks as 
needed under a summary task, and the manual scheduling prevents the sum-
mary task from moving. You don’t have to add all the subtasks at once. Just 
add them as the details become available.
And, as shown in Figure 5-5, subtasks like the “Kick off meeting” task even can 
be outside the overall schedule for the summary task, something that isn’t 
possible with autoscheduling. The lower rollup bar for the summary task 
extends to the left of the black summary bar to show that a subtask is outside 
the summary task schedule. Only three subtasks have been added so far for 
the first summary task in Figure 5-5. The other four summary tasks, numbers 
5 through 8, have been scheduled but don’t yet have subtasks added.
Creating manually scheduled summary tasks is just a variation of basic task-
creation techniques. Follow these steps:
 
1. Create the task that you want to be the summary task, leaving it set as 
a manually scheduled task.
 
2. Enter the duration for the summary task.

you to add

ule subtasks

113
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Outline in Line
 
3. Set the start for the summary task, either by entering a date in the 
Start column or by dragging its bar to the right on the chart to move it 
to the desired time frame.
 
 Repeat Steps 1–3 as needed to create other summary tasks. Continue 
with the remaining steps for adding subtasks either now or at any later 
time.
 
4. Add tasks below the summary task, setting their scheduling method 
and duration as desired.
 
5. Select and indent the subtasks.
 
 The manually scheduled summary task’s Gantt bar changes to a sum-
mary bar, and the rollup bar appears to reflect the current subtasks.
 
To insert a task, such as a task between two manually scheduled summary 
tasks, click the location where you want the new task to appear and press 
Insert.
 
In Chapter 4, I recommend that beginning project managers consider stick-
ing with autoscheduling to take advantage of Project’s powerful scheduling 
capabilities and to reduce the degree to which individual tasks need to be 
rescheduled manually when the schedule changes. The same gentle reminder 
applies here. When you’re deciding whether to use automatically scheduled 
summary tasks or manually scheduled summary tasks, keep your longer-term 
management and tracking needs in mind. Manually scheduled summary tasks 
don’t reschedule if their subtasks change, meaning that you may have to edit 
summary tasks to match. It’s perfectly appropriate to use manually scheduled 
summary tasks only when needed, and lean toward using mostly autosched-
uled summary tasks.
Now You See It, Now You Don’t: 
Collapsing and Expanding Tasks
Since caveman days (or whenever the first fourth-grade teacher taught the 
first set of kids how to outline their book reports), outlines have allowed you 
to focus on different levels of detail. Outlines do this on paper by essentially 
ordering information so that you can more easily focus on the level of infor-
mation you need and ignore the rest.
With the invention of computer outlining, the capability to focus on only cer-
tain portions of an outline comes into its own because you can easily open 
and close an outline to show or hide different levels of information — or 
entire sections of your outline. The minus symbol (–) next to the “Prepare 
Print Materials” summary task shown in Figure 5-6 indicates that all subtasks 
below it are displayed.

114
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 5-6: 
This project 
outline 
shows you 
details of 
just one 
phase of the 
project.
 
This capability means that you can hide all but the upper level of tasks in 
a project to give your manager an overview of progress. Or, you can close 
every phase of your project except the one in progress so that your team 
can focus on just those tasks in a status meeting. Or, you can close most of 
your outline so that jumping to a late phase of a very large schedule doesn’t 
involve more scroll work than a Baroque fireplace.
 
A summary task with all tasks displayed has a minus sign to its left. A sum-
mary task with hidden subtasks sports a plus sign to its left. All summary 
tasks are indicated in bold in the project outline. When a summary task has 
a minus sign next to it, you can select the summary task and do one of three 
things:
 
✓ Click the minus sign to hide all subtasks.
 
✓ Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Show Outline button in the 
Data group, and then click Hide Subtasks.
 
✓ Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Outline button in the Data 
group, and then click the level of detail you want to leave open in the 
entire outline, as shown in Figure 5-7. (For example, you can click 
Outline Level 1 for only the highest level in the outline to show the 
fewest details.)

When a summary task has a plus sign next to it, you can select the summary 
task and do one of three things:
 
✓ Click the plus sign to display one level of subtasks.
 
✓ Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Show Outline button in the 
Data group, and then click Show Subtasks.
 
✓ Click the View tab on the Ribbon, click the Show Outline button in the 
Data group, and click the level of the outline you want to reveal for the 
entire outline.
 
To quickly reveal all subtasks in a project, click the Show Outline button and 
then click All Subtasks.
Cracking the WBS Code
Some codes are used for disguising things (think of The DaVinci Code). In 
Project 2010, however, codes are used to make the elements of a project 
easier to identify. These codes — work breakdown structure (WBS) codes — 
can be generated automatically to give a unique identity to each task in your 
project by its order in the project outline.

116
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
For example, say the third phase of a project has nine subtasks, and the 
ninth subtask also has subtasks. The WBS code for its third subtask is 3.9.3. 
This code helps you identify all tasks that belong to Phase 3, no matter at 
what level of the outline they might lie, as shown in Figure 5-8. Quite simply, 
assigning a WBS code to an outline helps you to identify the location of indi-
vidual tasks in the outline so that people can find and reference them easily. 
This concept is similar to how page numbers in a book’s table of contents 
help you go right to a specific page.
 
Figure 5-8: 
To work by 
the num-
bers, display 
the WBS 
codes.
 
RBS: Kind of like WBS, but for people
If you use the Enterprise Global template, you 
can make use of the RBS (resource break-
down structure) field, which is a way of ranking 
resources in your organization. RBS represents 
the organizational structure for resources. 
RBS codes assigned by the project manager 
or enterprise administrator can help you to 
streamline the process of granting permissions 
to access online data or to filter for resources 
at a certain level in your organization. The 
Resource Substitution Wizard also makes use 
of RBS levels in their calculations. You can 
also use the Group feature to group tasks by 
the resource hierarchy of assignments. After 
an administrator with the ability to modify the 
Enterprise Global template sets the RBS field, 
everybody and their brother (in your enterprise) 
can view it. All these tasks require Project 
Server, so see Chapter 18 for more about RBS.

117
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Outline in Line
 
The United States government often requires that subcontractors use this 
type of code, so companies doing business with the government should find 
this automatic application of a WBS code useful.
Standard WBS code uses numbers for each level of the code. You can also 
create custom codes that provide a few options for how the code is defined. 
Read how in the upcoming section “Customizing the code.”
Displaying a WBS code
Here’s the good news: You don’t really have to create a WBS code per se 
because the very structure of your outline creates the code. All you have to 
do is display it. To do that, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Gantt Chart button on the Task tab of the Ribbon.
 
 Gantt Chart view appears.
 
2. Right-click any column heading and then choose Insert Column.
 
 The list of available fields appears.
 
3. Type a W to scroll down the list, and then click WBS.
 
 The WBS column is displayed. If you add a task, or move, promote, or 
demote a task in your project outline, the WBS code is updated 
automatically.
Customizing the code
For the fourth task under the second phase of the first phase in the project, 
the WBS code would look like this, by default:
1.2.4
Such off-the-rack WBS code often works just fine for projects. For those 
times when you want to make changes, however, Project 2010 allows you to 
modify the code to use a prefix — the name of your project, a client ID, or 
your department number, for example — and to vary the use of numerals or 
letters to indicate the various levels of your code structure. An example of a 
customized code is shown in Figure 5-9.
The elements used to make up the code are code masks. You can specify the 
following choices for WBS code masks:
 
✓ Project Code Prefix enables you to add a project identifier that appears 
at the beginning of each of the codes.

118
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 5-9: 
Customized 
WBS codes 
can help 
you identify 
your tasks 
by catego-
ries such as 
year, divi-
sion, client, 
or company.
 
 
✓ Numbers (Ordered) uses a numerical code.
 
✓ Uppercase Letters (Ordered) uses letter codes (such as A, B, and C 
to correspond to the first, second, and third phases of a project) with 
uppercase formatting.
 
✓ Lowercase Letters (Ordered) also uses letters but with lowercase 
formatting.
 
✓ Characters (Unordered) is used for combinations of letters and num-
bers. This choice generates an asterisk; you can replace the asterisk 
with whatever characters you like in a columnar view.
To customize a WBS code, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Project➪WBS➪Define Code.
 
 The WBS Code Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-10.
 
 
Project offers a Code Preview field so that you can see what your 
changes will do as you make them.
 
2. In the Project Code Prefix box, type a prefix.
 
3. Click at the top of the Sequence column and then select a mask for the 
first level.

119
 Chapter 5: Getting Your Outline in Line
 
Figure 5-10: 
The Code 
Preview 
field lets 
you pre-
view your 
changes.
 
 
4. Click the Length column and then select a length for the mask 
sequence that corresponds to the number of tasks you expect to have 
at that level.
 
 Each number represents a single character. If you choose 4, for example, 
your first task at this level is numbered 0001. If you aren’t sure, leave the 
default choice of Any, which allows any length.
 
5. Click under the Separator column and then select a separator.
 
 The choices are a period, hyphen, plus sign, or forward slash.
 
6. To define WBS code elements for additional levels of your outline, 
repeat Steps 3–5.
 
7. When you’re finished, click the OK button to save the new code.
 
The essential point of a WBS code is to provide a unique identifier for each 
task in your project. The WBS Code Definition dialog box offers the Verify 
Uniqueness of New WBS Codes option, which is active by default. If you turn 
off this option, you aren’t alerted if you insert, for example, a subproject that 
contains duplicate WBS numbers.
 
If you don’t want Project 2010 to automatically add a custom WBS code when 
you insert new tasks, deselect the Generate WBS Code for New Task check 
box in the WBS Code Definition dialog box. If you later want to renumber all 
tasks to accommodate new tasks, changes, and subprojects you’ve inserted, 
choose Project➪WBS➪Renumber. This technique can be useful if you want to 
try what-if scenarios and don’t want all your tasks to change.

▶ Examining workflow in Gantt Chart and Network Diagram views
I
magine this: If you create a hundred tasks and leave their default con-
straints so that they start as soon as possible and have no dependencies, 
all those tasks start on the project start date and occur simultaneously. The 
project consisting of a hundred tasks takes exactly as long to complete as the 
longest task.
Wander back over here to reality for a moment. When was the last time that 
every task in your project could be performed at the same time? When did 
you last have enough resources to even begin to make that feasible? When 
did you ever have a set of tasks in which not a single task had to be com-
pleted before another could start? Imagine what would happen if you poured 
a building’s foundation before you got the building permit. Or, consider the 
chaos if you tried to train your employees to use a new piece of equipment 
before the equipment even arrived.
The reality is that tasks in a project don’t all start at the same time. To reflect 
that reality in a Project plan, you have to build in a timing logic. That logic 
consists of setting dependency links between tasks. Dependencies are timing 
relationships between tasks — for example, when one task depends on the 
completion of another. Dependencies are caused by either
 
✓ The nature of the tasks: You can’t frame a house, for example, until its 
concrete foundation is dry; otherwise, the building will sink.
 
✓ A lack of available resources: Your operations manager can’t attend 
two plant inspections simultaneously.

122
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
How Tasks Become Codependent
In Chapter 4, I mention that you shouldn’t set task start dates very often 
because projects are fluid — they change and grow faster than bad guys 
come at you in the average computer game. If you build in timing logic rather 
than assign specific dates to tasks, Project can reflect changes by adjusting 
your project based on that logic.
If the task of getting materials in-house is delayed by a week, for example, 
the dependent task of starting the manufacturing process moves out a week 
automatically. You can note the change when you’re tracking activity in your 
plan, and Project makes adjustments accordingly. The alternative is to go in 
and change the start date of just about every task in your schedule every time 
a task is running late — you don’t even want to think about doing that!
Dependent tasks: Which comes first?
As with human relationships, every dependency relationship involves roles: 
Every task is either a predecessor or a successor. Any two tasks with a timing 
relationship can be a predecessor-successor pair, even if the timing of the 
two tasks overlaps or they’re set to happen concurrently. The important 
point to remember is that the predecessor task’s schedule has an impact on 
when the successor task is scheduled, particularly under the autoscheduling 
method.
Figure 6-1 shows you how the taskbars in Gantt Chart view graphically depict 
the predecessors and successors in dependency relationships between tasks. 
Notice how taskbars represent the relationship when a task starts after (or 
during the life of) another task. Also notice the lines drawn between tasks: 
These lines indicate dependency links.
 
Here’s some important advice about dependencies, so listen up: You can have 
more than one dependency link to a task, but don’t overdo it. Many people 
who are new to Project make the mistake of building every logical timing 
relationship that could exist. If things change and the dependencies have to 
be deleted or changed (for example, to shorten a schedule), the web of depen-
dencies starts to get convoluted — and can easily create a nightmare.
For example, you must complete the tasks of obtaining a permit and pouring 
a foundation for a building before you can start framing it. However, if you set 
up a dependency between obtaining the permit and pouring the foundation, 
setting a dependency from foundation to framing is sufficient to establish the 
correct timing. Because you can’t start pouring the foundation until you have 
a permit and you can’t frame until you pour the foundation, framing cannot 
start before you have a permit.

123
 Chapter 6: Timing Is Everything
 
Figure 6-1: 
In this view, 
dependency 
relation-
ships are 
shown by 
the lines 
between

You don’t have to use dependencies to prevent resources from working on 
two tasks simultaneously. When you set the availability for resources and 
assign them to two tasks happening at the same time, you can use tools such 
as the new Team Planner view (see Chapter 9) and resource leveling (dis-
cussed in Chapter 10) rather than establish a dependency that forces one task 
to happen after another. This feature delays tasks whose scheduling causes a 
resource overallocation. See Chapters 9 and 10 for more about how resource 
assignments affect task timing.
Dependency types
You can establish four types of dependency links: finish-to-start, start-to-
finish, start-to-start, and finish-to-finish. Using these types efficiently can 
mean the difference between a project that finishes on time and one that is 
still limping along long after you retire.
 
In Chapter 4, I cover task constraints and priorities. These settings work in 
concert with dependencies to determine the ultimate timing of tasks in your 
project.

124
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Here’s how the four dependency types work:
 
✓ Finish-to-start: A finish-to-start dependency is the most common type of 
dependency link. In this relationship, the predecessor task must be com-
pleted before the successor task can start. When you create a depen-
dency, the default setting is finish-to-start.
 
 An example of a finish-to-start dependency is when you must complete 
the Calculate Quantities task before you can begin the Order Supplies 
task. Figure 6-2 shows those two tasks (and others) with the finish-to-
start relationship indicated by a successor taskbar that starts where the 
predecessor taskbar leaves off.
 
✓ Start-to-finish: In a start-to-finish dependency, the successor task can 
finish only after the predecessor task has started. If the predecessor is 
delayed, the successor task can’t finish.
 
 Suppose that you’re planning the building of a new cruise ship. You may 
start selling tickets for the ship’s maiden voyage while the ship is being 
built, and you don’t want to stop selling tickets until the ship is ready 
to leave. So, the predecessor task is Ship Ready for First Voyage (a mile-
stone), and the successor is Sell Tickets for Maiden Voyage. If the ship 
isn’t ready, you can keep selling tickets. When the ship is ready to go, 
the ticket windows close, and that task can finish. Bon voyage!
 
Figure 6-2: 
Where one 
task ends, 
the taskbar 
for the other 
begins.
 

125
 Chapter 6: Timing Is Everything
 
✓ Start-to-start: Start-to-start means what it says: Two tasks can start 
simultaneously. For example, if you are preparing to install a walkway, 
determining the pattern in which you want to lay pavers may affect the 
quantity of pavers ordered.
 
 Figure 6-3 accordingly shows the start-to-start relationship between the 
Calculate Quantities and Determine Pattern tasks.
 
✓ Finish-to-finish: Finish-to-finish has nothing to do with warm relations 
between citizens of Finland. Finish-to-finish means that (you guessed it) 
two tasks must finish at the same time.
 
 Suppose that you’re preparing an annual report for your adventure-
travel company. You have to obtain photographs of travel destinations 
and have the brochure copy laid out. You need both items in hand 
before you can forward the report to the printer. If you set a finish-to-
finish dependency between these two tasks, you allow both tasks the 
greatest length of time to be completed. (Why have the photos sitting 
around for four weeks, for example, when the copy isn’t ready?)

to-start 
relationship

126
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Allowing for Murphy’s Law: 
Lag and lead time
Dependencies can get a little more complex than simply applying the four 
types of dependency links I describe in the preceding section. You can use 
lag time or lead time to fine-tune your timing relationships:
 
✓ Lag time occurs when you add time to the start or finish of a predeces-
sor task; lag time causes a gap in timing. For example, you almost always 
have a period of time between when you order supplies for a project 
and when you receive them. Figure 6-4 shows the lag time scheduled 
between the Order Supplies and Receive Supplies tasks.
 
✓ Lead time is created when you subtract time from the start or finish of 
the predecessor; lead time causes an overlap between two tasks.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Note the 
lag time 
between 
the finish of 
the Order 
Supplies 
task and 
the start of 
the Receive 
Supplies 
task.
 

127
 Chapter 6: Timing Is Everything
Here are a couple of additional examples:
 
✓ You want to launch a new toy product into the market and set up a 
start-to-start dependency relationship between the Begin Print Media 
Advertising predecessor task and the Begin TV and Radio Advertising 
successor task in your project. In a simple start-to-start relationship, 
both tasks start at the same time. If you want the TV and radio ads to 
come out a week after the print ads begin, though, you build in a week 
of lag time to the start-to-start relationship where Begin Print Media 
Advertising is the predecessor and Begin TV and Radio Advertising is 
the successor. TV and Radio ads will now start one week after print ads 
begin to appear.
 
✓ In a project to train a new set of volunteer docents to give tours of a 
historic mansion, suppose that you create a finish-to-start relationship 
between the two tasks Locate Recruits and Train Recruits. However, to 
save time in your project, you decide to incorporate two days of lead 
time — that is, allow the training of the earliest hires to start before all 
the recruits are hired. In that case, you essentially deduct time from 
the finish-to-start relationship that allows you to start training two days 
before the finish of the Locate Recruits predecessor.
Making the Dependency Connection
Making dependency relationships is simple. You simply create a dependency, 
make settings to select the dependency type, and build in any lag or lead 
time. The tricky part comes in understanding how each type of dependency 
affects your plan when your project goes live and you start to record actual 
activity that resources perform on tasks.
Adding the missing (dependency) link
When you create a dependency, by default, it’s a finish-to-start relationship: 
One task must finish before another can start. If that’s just the kind of depen-
dency you want, that’s all there is to it. If not, after you create this link, you 
can edit it to change the dependency type or to build in lag or lead time.
To establish a simple finish-to-start link, follow these steps:
 
1. Display Gantt Chart view and make sure that the two tasks you want 
to link are visible.
 
 You may have to collapse some tasks in your project or use the Zoom 
button on the View tab to fit more tasks on your screen.

128
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
2. Click the predecessor taskbar and drag your mouse pointer to the suc-
cessor taskbar.
 
 As you drag, a box appears, as shown in Figure 6-5, and the mouse 
pointer changes to the shape of a little chain link.
 
3. When the readout indicates the task number you want to link to, 
release your mouse button.
You can also establish a finish-to-start relationship by clicking the predeces-
sor, pressing Ctrl, and then clicking the successor task; then just click the 
Link Tasks button in the Schedule group of the Task tab.
 
It’s best practice to link only subtasks, which represent the actual work per-
formed, not the summary tasks. The Ctrl+click method is helpful for skipping 
over summary tasks when selecting tasks for linking. Also, whether you use 
the mouse to drag between tasks or the Link Tasks button, the task selected 
first always becomes the predecessor.

pointer is

 Chapter 6: Timing Is Everything
To establish a link in the Task Information dialog box or modify an existing 
relationship, make note of the task ID number of the predecessor task and 
then follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the successor task.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Predecessors tab, as shown in Figure 6-6.
 
 On this tab, you can build as many dependency relationships as you 
like.
 
Figure 6-6:

3. In the ID field, type a task ID number for the predecessor task.
 
 Alternately, you can select the task from the Task Name drop-down list. 
To display this list, click the next blank Task Name cell, and then click 
the drop-down list arrow that appears.
 
4. Press Tab.
 
 The task name and the default finish-to-start dependency type with 0d 
(no days, the default unit of time) of lag time are entered automatically.
 
5. Click the Type field and click the arrow that appears to display the 
dependency types, and then click the appropriate dependency for 
your situation.
 
6. If you want to add lag or lead time, click the Lag field and use the 
spinner arrows that appear to set the amount of time.
 
 Click up to a positive number for lag time or down to a negative number 
for lead time.
 
7. Repeat Steps 3–6 to establish additional dependency relationships.

130
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
8. When you’re finished, click the OK button to save the dependencies.
 
 The Gantt chart displays your dependencies with lines and arrows, as 
shown in the project displayed in Figure 6-7.
 
Most dependency links are between tasks that are reasonably close to each 
other in the Project outline. However, if you have to link tasks that don’t fit on 
a single screen of information, the dragging method can be tricky. In that case, 
use the successor Task Information dialog box to create the relationship by 
entering the predecessor task ID number or name.

Extending your reach with 
external dependencies
No person is an island — and no project exists in isolation. Many times, 
another project you’re managing or another project going on somewhere else 
in your organization affects your project. Perhaps resources or facilities are 
shared, or perhaps the timing of tasks in other projects affects the timing of 
tasks in yours. For example, if your project is to plan the opening of a new 
store, you may have to create a dependency from your Begin Move-In task to 
the Final Building Inspection Complete task in someone else’s construction 
project.

131
 Chapter 6: Timing Is Everything
To deal with this balancing act, you can create a linked task that represents 
the timing of the other project (or of a particular task in it). This is also called 
creating a cross-project link. Make sure that both the file with the predeces-
sor task and the file with the successor task are open. Identify the filename 
and task ID (row) number for the predecessor task. Then, switch to the file 
with the successor task and open the Task Information dialog box for the 
successor task, as just described. Click in the ID column on a blank row. Type 
the predecessor filename, a backslash, and then the predecessor task ID 
number, as in Annual Report Project\4. Then press Tab to complete the entry. 
The linked task from the other file shows up in the list as shown in Figure 6-8. 
In the Gantt chart, that external successor appears in gray, so you know that 
it doesn’t really “live” in the current schedule file.
 
Figure 6-8: 
The task 
ID refers to 
an external 
task.
 
 
You can also insert an entire project and add a link to it so that updates to the 
other file are reflected in your plan automatically.
When linked dependencies don’t do a thing
If you want to set up important project dates 
and set up dependencies among them but you 
don’t want those dates to cause any delay in 
your project (as a linked task might do), try 
using deliverables. First introduced in Project 
Professional 2007, deliverables are important 
dates in your project that you can use to build 
a proposal for your project before you even 
begin to add tasks. You can publish deliverables 
and report on them. They offer an alternative 
way to audit changes among several projects. 
Deliverables, which are essentially a Windows 
SharePoint Server list accessed through 
Project Web App, provide a tool that you can 
use to control the effect of dependencies on 
your schedule. See Chapters 18 and 19 for more 
about Project Web App.

Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
Understanding that things change: 
Deleting dependencies
Just like the latest trend in fashion, dependencies in a project can suddenly 
change. For example, sometimes they’re no longer needed because of a shift 
in resources or overall project timing. When you need to get rid of a depen-
dency, you can undo what you did in either the Gantt Chart or the Task 
Information dialog box.
With Gantt Chart view displayed, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the two tasks whose dependency you want to delete.
 
• For two adjacent tasks: Drag to select their ID numbers.
 
• For nonadjacent tasks: Click one task, press and hold Ctrl, and 
then click a nonadjacent task.
 
2. Click the Unlink Tasks button in the Tasks group of the Task tab.
 
Be careful when you use this method: If you click only one task and then click 
the Unlink Tasks button, you get a somewhat drastic result: All dependency 
relationships for that task are removed.
To remove dependency relationships in the Task Information dialog box, 
here’s the drill:
 
1. Double-click a successor task name.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Predecessors tab to display it.
 
3. Click the Type box for the dependency that you want to delete.
 
 A list of dependency types appears, as shown in Figure 6-9.
 
Figure 6-9: 
You can 
use this tab 
to create 
and delete 
dependency 
links.
 

133
 Chapter 6: Timing Is Everything
 
4. Choose None.
 
5. Click the OK button to save the change.
 
 The dependency line on the Gantt chart is gone; the next time you open 
that Task Information dialog box, the dependency is gone, too.
 
Change Highlighting clearly shows the effect on your schedule of making 
dependency and other schedule changes. Any tasks affected by adding or 
deleting a dependency now have either their start or finish date columns high-
lighted in the sheet pane, depending on which date the change affected.
Taking a Look at the Task Dependencies
Project provides several ways to view dependencies in your project. The 
method you choose probably relates to how you visualize data, so there’s no 
absolute right or wrong way here!
You may have already seen the dependency link lines that appear in the 
Gantt chart (refer to Figure 6-7). Another great way to see the flow of depen-
dencies is in Network Diagram view. This workflow view uses similar lines 
and arrows to reveal dependency relationships, but it allows you to get a dif-
ferent perspective on them.
 
You can display the Task Inspector pane (click Inspect in the Tasks group 
of the Task tab) to see a list of everything in the schedule that’s driving the 
timing of a selected task, including predecessors. For more about the Task 
Inspector feature, see Chapter 10.
Figure 6-10 shows Network Diagram view of a landscaping project. Notice 
that each task has a node containing its vital statistics. Between the nodes 
are lines that reveal dependency relationships among tasks. Although you 
can’t see the effect in this black-and-white image, any task dependency links 
on the critical path are displayed in red by default, and noncritical tasks are 
displayed in blue. (Critical-path tasks have no slack: They can’t be delayed 
without delaying the entire project.)
 
A neat trick in Network Diagram view is to edit the layout to show link labels. 
(Right-click outside any task nodes, choose Layout, and then select the Show 
Link Labels check box.) A code, such as FS for finish-to-start, is displayed to 
explain the type of dependency that each dependency line represents, as 
shown in Figure 6-10.

134
Part I: Setting the Stage for Project 
 
Figure 6-10: 
Following 
the flow of 
dependency 
lines is a 
bit easier 
in Network 
Diagram 
view.
 
You can also display columns that itemize, by task ID number, successors 
or predecessors for each task in any view with a sheet area, such as Gantt 
Chart view. Figure 6-11 shows Gantt Chart view for a project with successor 
and predecessor columns displayed. These columns also display a notation 
of any type of dependency other than the default finish-to-start type and any 
lead or lag time using percentages or lengths of time. For example, 6FS+7 
days is a finish-to-start link to task 6, with lag time set so that the successor 
begins 7 days after the predecessor task finishes. Successors and predeces-
sors without added notations represent default finish-to-start links with no 
lead or lag time.
 
You can also edit the contents of Network Diagram nodes to include predeces-
sor and successor data.

ere’s where you get to know Project resources — 
human and otherwise — and understand how to 
orchestrate people, material, and other assets most effec-
tively to dispatch your project’s tasks. This part also

how to use new and old tools to make resource assign-
ments most effectively.

Chapter 7
Optimizing Your Resources
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding work and material resources
▶ Creating resources to get your project done
▶ Using resource groups and shared resources
▶ Dealing with resource calendar settings
P
rojects are like giant water coolers — they’re gathering places for 
people. Projects also utilize equipment and materials. Those people, 
equipment, and materials are your project resources.
Unlike water coolers (you can take an analogy only so far), resources are also 
the means by which Project tallies up costs in your plan. Assign a resource 
to work for ten hours on a task, give that resource an hourly rate of $20, 
and you’ve just added a $200 cost to your project. Create a resource called 
cement, give it a unit cost of $200, and assign ten units (for example, ten tons 
of cement), and you’ve added a whopping $2,000 to the bottom line.
Using resources wisely in Project doesn’t involve only assigning them a cost. 
Rather, it’s a delicate art of combining the right resource with the right skills 
and assigning that resource to put in the right amount of time (or units) for 
tasks. And you have to do this all without overbooking anyone at any point in 
your schedule.
Because they affect timing and costs, resources are a big deal in Project. For that 
reason, many tools are available to help you create resources, make settings for 
how and when they’ll work, assign them to tasks, manage costs, and manipulate 
their workload. The first step in working with resources is to create them and 
enter certain information about them. That’s what this chapter is all about.
Resources: People, Places, and Things
Many people hear the word resources and think of people. Well, people are 
indeed a frequently used project resource, but they’re not the whole story. 
Resources can also be equipment that you rent or buy as well as materials, 

140
Part II: People Who Need People 
such as paper clips or scrap iron. You can even create resources that repre-
sent facilities you have to rent by the hour, such as a laboratory or a meet-
ing space, or costs that aren’t necessarily consistent. For example, you can 
create a resource named Plant Visit and assign it a cost of $400, which covers 
the airfare, hotel, and rental car charges for the visit.
Here are some typical and not-so-typical project resources:
 
✓ Engineers
 
✓ Trade-show fee
 
✓ Office supplies
 
✓ Hotel ballroom
 
✓ Administrative assistants
 
✓ Rocket fuel
 
✓ Speaker fees
 
✓ Furniture
 
✓ Computer software
 
✓ Printing services
 
✓ Graphic designers
 
✓ Prototype design
You get the picture. Resources can be practically anything or anyone that 
you use to complete your project.
Becoming Resource-Full
After you create and organize the tasks in your project, the next typical step 
is to create resources. You can also borrow resources that have been cre-
ated by others and assign them to your project. Before you start creating 
resources willy-nilly, though, you must understand how they affect your 
project.
Understanding resources
The key to understanding resources is to realize that resources in Project 
equal costs. If you want to account for costs in your project — such as a 
person putting in hours working on a task, computers that you have to buy, 
or fees for services — you must create resources and assign them to one or 
more tasks. When you do, you can see the resulting costs in the Total Cost 
column of the Cost table in Gantt Chart view, as shown in Figure 7-1.

141
 Chapter 7: Optimizing Your Resources
 
Figure 7-1: 
Tasks with 
assigned 
resources 
show the 
associated 
total costs 
in the Total 
Cost column 
of the Cost 
table.
 
 
One other way to add costs to a project is to use a fixed cost. Fixed costs 
are not assigned through resources because they don’t accumulate costs by 
hours of work, units used, or on another frequent basis. Instead, a fixed cost is 
a set cost applied directly to an individual task, such as a contract fee for an 
outside vendor. (For more on fixed costs, see Chapter 8.)
 
If a cost is not task-specific — such as a flat $10,000 consulting fee to a firm 
that’s advising you on an overall project — you can create and assign a 
resource or fixed cost to the project summary task.
After you create the resources that Project uses to tally your project costs, 
you need to manage the workflow for any resource that has limited time 
availability for your project. You create resources that are available so many 
hours per day and so many days per week. For example, one person may be 
available 50 percent of the time, or 20 hours in a 40-hour workweek, while 
another may be available full time (40 hours). When you assign those kinds 
of resources to your project, you can use various views, reports, and tools to 
see whether any resource is overbooked at any point during your project. You 
can also see whether people are sitting around twiddling their thumbs when 
they may be available to help out on another task. You can even account for 
resources that work on multiple projects across your organization and make 
sure that they’re being used efficiently. Views such as Resource Usage view 
(as shown in Figure 7-2) help you visualize resource working time in your proj-
ect. (In Chapter 9, you discover another view — Team Planner — that helps 
you visualize and work with assignments in a more fluid and easy way.)

142
Part II: People Who Need People 
 
Figure 7-2: 
You can 
see total 
hours on 
the project 
by resource 
and an 
itemization 
of the hours 
assigned 
task by task 
for that 
resource.
 
Finally, you need to understand that the number of resources you assign 
to work on a task will usually have an effect on the duration of that task. In 
other words, if you have a certain amount of work to perform but few people 
to do that work, a typical task takes longer to finish than if you had scads of 
folks.
 
The task type determines whether a task’s duration changes based on the 
number of resources assigned to it. Take a look at Chapter 4 for more about 
task types.
Resource types: Work, material, and cost
Although people and things come in all shapes and sizes, only three types 
of resources exist as far as Project is concerned: work resources, material 
resources, and cost resources:
 
✓ Work resources are typically (but not always) people. They can’t be 
depleted but can be reassigned. Their costs are generally associated 
with the amount of work time they put in, usually at an hourly rate. A 
work resource also can have a cost per use (Cost/Use), which is a cost 
added on each time you assign the resource. For example, a plumber 
may charge a travel fee (the cost/use) plus an hourly rate. Work 

143
 Chapter 7: Optimizing Your Resources
resources are assigned to tasks based on a Working Time calendar (as 
shown in Figure 7-3), where you specify their working and nonworking 
hours. You can select one of three base calendars or a custom calendar 
that you’ve created and then modify specific working hours.
 
Figure 7-3: 
Work 
resources 
are 
assigned 
to tasks 
based on 
a Working 
Time 
calendar. 
 
✓ Material resources have a unit cost, and they also do not consume 
working hours. For that reason, this type of resource has no calendar, 
and you make no settings for working and nonworking time.
 
✓ Cost resources have no cost associated with them initially. This type of 
resource gives you the flexibility to specify the applicable cost each time 
you use the resource. Calendars and units of work or unit costs have 
nothing to do with the amount such resources add to the bottom line of 
your project.
A typical work resource is a person working eight hours a day at a standard 
rate of $20 per hour and an overtime rate of $30 per hour. Another example 
of a work resource is a meeting facility available only eight hours a day at an 
hourly rate. Even though it’s not a person, the meeting facility would proba-
bly be created as a working resource because it has limited “working” hours.
 
The three kinds of calendars are Project, Task, and Resource. Calendars, their 
settings, and how those settings interact are discussed at some length in 
Chapter 3.

144
Part II: People Who Need People 
A typical material resource is any material — such as steel, rubber, paper or 
books, chairs, and shoes — assigned to a task with an associated unit cost. 
For example, a resource called Books with a unit price of $12.95, assigned to 
a task called Computer Training at ten units, accrues a cost of $129.50 to the 
task.
An example of a cost resource is a Bike Messenger resource, whose fee may 
be $25 for one delivery task and $35 for another. Other common examples of 
resources that would fall into the cost resource category include air travel, 
hotel costs, or cab fare. Another example of a cost resource is anyone who 
performs a service for a fee where working time is not an issue. A speaker 
who presents at a conference for a fee of $1,000 but whose working calendar 
and time are not your concern may be created as a material resource with a 
unit cost of $1,000, or simply added as a fixed cost to the project.
 
Deciding which resource type to use when adding an external vendor or 
equipment resource to the project can be tricky. If you do not want to add 
hours of work to the project when that resource is being used, do not set the 
resource up as a work resource. Use a cost resource or fixed-cost approach 
instead.
How resources affect task timing
Under Project 2010’s new defaults, effort-driven scheduling is turned off 
for both manually and autoscheduled tasks. So, no matter how many work 
resources you assign, the task duration stays the same, and Project piles on 
more hours of work for the task, to reflect more effort.
Enterprise or local?
If your organization has you choose resources 
from an organization-wide group, you can 
assign enterprise resources to your project. To 
assign resources created for your enterprise 
when connected to Project Server with Project 
Professional 2010, you use the Build Team from 
Enterprise command, which you can find by 
clicking the Add Resources button in the Insert 
group of the Resource tab on the Ribbon. This 
command is available to you only if you are 
nicely set up on a network with Project Server 
in place. (See Chapter 18 for more about Project 
Server.)
To set up so-called local or nonenterprise 
resources, you simply create your own 
resource list in your projects; these resources 
are not available to other project managers.

145
 Chapter 7: Optimizing Your Resources
However, there are cases where, for a fixed-unit or fixed-work task type, you 
want the addition or removal of resources assigned to the task to have an 
impact on the time it takes to complete the task. In essence, the old saying 
that “two heads are better than one” may be modified to “two heads are 
faster than one.”
Here’s an example: Suppose that one person is assigned to the Dig Ditch task, 
which should take four hours of effort. Two people assigned to the Dig Ditch 
task will finish the job in two hours because two hours are being worked 
by each resource simultaneously, which achieves four hours of effort in 
half the time. To make scheduling for a task work this way, you have to first 
change the task to an autoscheduled task using the Auto Schedule button in 
the Schedule group of the Task tab. Then, you have to turn on effort-driven 
scheduling by double-clicking the task, clicking the Advance tab in the Task 
Information dialog box, selecting the Effort Driven check box, and then click-
ing the OK button.
 
One BIG word of warning here: Assigning additional people to tasks doesn’t 
always cut work time down proportionately, even though that’s how Project 
calculates it. When you have more people, you have more meetings, memos, 
duplicated effort, conflicts, and so on. If you add more resources to a task, you 
may consider upping the amount of effort required to complete that task to 
account for inevitable workgroup inefficiencies.
Estimating resource requirements
You usually know how many material resources it takes to complete a task: In 
most cases, you can calculate the number of pounds, tons, yards, and so on 
with a standard formula. But how do you know how much effort it will take 
on the part of work resources to complete the tasks in your project?
As with many aspects of information you put into a Project plan, this judg-
ment rests to a great degree on your own experience with similar tasks and 
resources. Still, remember these guidelines:
 
✓ Skill counts. A less skilled or experienced resource is likely to take more 
time to finish something.
 
✓ History repeats itself. Look at previous projects and tasks. If you’ve 
tracked people’s time, you can probably see how much effort was 
required to complete various types of tasks on other projects and draw 
parallels to your project.
 
✓ Ask and you shall receive. Ask the resources themselves how long they 
think it will take. Then add 10 percent to that time to cover yourself!

146
Part II: People Who Need People 
Committed versus proposed resources
If you’ve ever asked somebody to work on your project and gotten a half-
hearted, “Well, maybe, if I have time, if my manager says it’s okay, if it falls on 
a leap year . . .” in response, you may well ask: So is that resource available 
or not? It’s not always easy to tell. How can Project help? One feature is the 
capability to designate a resource as either proposed or committed. You can 
use the Booking Type field on the General tab in the Resource Information 
dialog box to make this setting. To open the Resource Information dialog 
box, go to Resource Sheet view and double-click the resource. Or, click the 
Resource tab and click Resource Information in the Properties group.
What does this setting do? Well, if you’re not quite sure about a resource’s 
commitment to your project, you call that resource proposed. Then you can 
display the Booking Type column in a resource view (such as the Resource 
Sheet) and keep track of resources you may have to firm up as you get closer 
to finalizing your project plan.
The Birth of a Resource
When a person is born, someone fills out a birth certificate. Creating 
a resource in Project involves filling out a form, too. On the Resource 
Information form, you enter information, such as the resource name, rate per 
hour or cost per use, and availability. You can also enter optional informa-
tion, such as the group (company workgroup) the resource belongs to or the 
resource’s e-mail address.
You can create a resource as a single person or thing, a generic resource 
(that is, a skill set with no person attached, such as Assistant or Engineer), or 
even a group of several resources that work together.
Creating one at a time
On the simplest level, you create a resource — whether it’s a person, a piece 
of equipment, or a material — as a single entity. In this case, you’re thinking 
of a particular person, or meeting room, or piece of equipment. You create 
the resource by entering information in the Resource Information dialog box.
 
Another method for entering resource information is to display Resource 
Sheet view and enter information in the columns included there. This is often 
a faster way to create several resources at once, and you can even paste 
resources copied from another source such as an Excel spreadsheet into this 
view.

147
 Chapter 7: Optimizing Your Resources
When you create a resource, you must at a minimum type the resource name, 
but you can also include as much information as you want. Some people 
prefer to create all the resources first and deal with contact and cost informa-
tion at a later stage.
 
I show you how to add the cost information for resources in more detail in 
Chapter 8.
To create a resource, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the bottom of the Gantt Chart button on the Task tab of the 
Ribbon, and click Resource Sheet.
 
2. Double-click a blank Resource Name cell.
 
 The Resource Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-4.
 
Figure 7-4: 
These 
four tabs 
can hold a 
wealth of 
information 
about any 
resource.
 
 
3. In the Resource Name box, type a name.
 
4. From the Type box, choose Work, Material, or Cost.
 
 The settings available to you differ slightly depending on what you 
choose. For example, a material resource won’t have the Email box avail-
able, and a work or cost resource won’t have the Material Label box 
available.
 
5. For a material resource, enter a description of the units in the Material 
Label box.
 
 For example, you might enter pounds for a Flour resource or tons for a 
Steel resource.

148
Part II: People Who Need People 
 
6. In the Initials box, type an abbreviation or initials for the resource.
 
 If you don’t enter anything here, the first letter of the resource name is 
inserted when you save the resource.
 
7. Continue to enter any information you want to include for the 
resource.
 
 That information may include an e-mail address, the group (a depart-
ment, division, or workgroup, for example), Booking Type (Proposed or 
Committed), or Code (such as a cost center code).
 
 If you enter information in the Group box, you can then use the Filter, 
Sort, and Group By features to look at sets of resources. See Chapter 10 
for more about filtering and working with groups.
 
8. Click the OK button to save the new resource.
Identifying resources before 
you know their names
 
In the planning stages of a project, you’ll often find that all your resources 
aren’t assembled. Sometimes even well into the project, you don’t know what 
resource you’ll be using; you know only that you need a resource with a cer-
tain skill set to complete upcoming tasks. In that case, you may be better off 
creating some resources as generic resources.
If you want to create a generic resource, you should give it a name that 
describes its skill, such as Engineer, Designer, or even Meeting Space (as 
opposed to a specific resource named Conference Room B). Then, in the 
Resource Information dialog box, be sure to select the Generic check box.
You can then display a Yes/No column titled Generic to identify these 
resources, and you can create a resource filter to filter for a Yes or No entry 
in the Generic column to filter resources by this characteristic.
No formula takes the Generic setting into account in recalculating your sched-
ule based on resource availability. However, many people find this setting 
useful in long-range planning and in situations where they aren’t responsible 
for specific resource assignments (for example, assigning a temporary worker 
to a task when the specific worker will be chosen by the temp agency).
You can replace a generic resource name with the name of the actual 
resource added to your project. For example, if you entered Engineer 1 as a 
resource, you could replace it with Jim Taylor, the engineer you snagged for 
the work. To make the switch, go to Resource Sheet view, click the Resource 
Name field cell for the resource, type the new name, and press Enter. Don’t 
worry if you’ve already assigned the generic resource to tasks in the project. 
Project will update all the assignments with the new name.

149
 Chapter 7: Optimizing Your Resources
 
When working with generic resources and Project Server, you may need to do 
a little more work, such as specifying unique custom fields required by your 
organization. Specify such information on the Custom Fields tab of the 
Resource Information dialog box.
Throwing more warm bodies at a task
Although you’ll probably have little use for chain gangs in your project, they 
exemplify the principle of a resource that represents multiple resources. 
Rather than assigning people one by one to some tasks, you’ll want to assign 
a group of people who typically work together. Being able to make one 
assignment of a consolidated resource rather than several separate resources 
and assignments can be a timesaver in larger projects.
Here’s an example of a consolidated resource: Suppose that you’re man-
aging a project to get a new Web site up and running. You have four Web 
designers of equal skill at your disposal, so you create a resource named 
Web Designers. You can assign Web Designers to a task at 400 percent and 
have all four designers working at once. Or, you can assign the Web Designer 
resource to work on a task at 100 percent, thereby assigning one resource to 
it. The percentage of an assignment is its units setting.
No special setting is used to designate a multiple resource. However, you 
may want to include some indication of the number of resources in the 
resource name. For example, you can name your designer resource Four 
Web Designers (if you know the Web design group consists of four people) or 
Web Design Group. What really defines this type of resource is the maximum 
assignment units; 400 percent would indicate four resources in the group.
 
Assigning a resource at less than 100 percent units creates a part-time 
assignment.
Sharing Resources
Many organizations have lots of projects going on at the same time. Some, 
such as a project to organize an office move, are the only project of its type 
happening in a company. Others, such as a building design project in an 
architectural firm, will happen simultaneously with several other similar 
projects and draw on many of the same resources, such as architects and 
draftspeople.
When an organization has projects of a similar nature going on at the same 
time, creating centralized resources is useful. This can save you time because 
you don’t have to create resources when they already exist. It can also help 
to track resources across projects.

150
Part II: People Who Need People 
Another timesaving Project feature allows you to pull existing resources from 
a company address book or your own Address Book in Outlook.
In the swim: Drawing on resource pools
If you use Project throughout your company, it can be beneficial to create a 
centralized repository of common resources and allow project managers to 
assign those resources to their various projects. This collection of resources 
is a resource pool. By using a resource pool, you can get a more realistic idea 
of how busy resources are across all projects at any point in time.
 
Don’t confuse a resource pool with enterprise resources, which require that 
you have Project 2010 Professional, Project Server 2010, and Microsoft Office 
Project Web App set up. With all this in place (see Chapters 18 and 19 for 
more about enterprise projects), you can track and assign resources across 
an entire enterprise. A resource pool, on the other hand, is simply a Project 
file that contains only a list of resources in the Resource Sheet view, and that 
is saved on a shared network drive for your workgroup or on your company 
server. Anyone with access to the resource pool file can assign the resources 
it contains to projects. A resource pool saves everybody the trouble of repeat-
edly creating these resources in their individual projects.
Both individual resources and generic resources can be created in a blank 
project as a resource pool and saved to an accessible location on your com-
pany network. Then, any project manager can call on those resources for 
his or her own projects; those projects are then referred to as sharer files 
because they share resources from the resource pool. For example, if you 
have a pool of maintenance people that everyone in your manufacturing 
company assigns to projects, create a Project file called Resource Pools and 
then create all the resources to share in the Resource Sheet view. Or, you 
can create a resource pool file called CEO and let all the people managing 
projects that require the CEO’s involvement assign him or her from that cen-
tral location. Then use the resource-sharing tools in Project to assign these 
resources to your plan.
 
You also can use the View tab to change to Resource Sheet view. On that tab, 
click the Resource Sheet button in the Resource Views group.
When anyone makes resource assignments in a sharer file, that information is 
also saved in the resource pool file. Then, anyone can use that file to look at 
resource allocations across all projects in the organization.
To access a resource that’s available to your entire organization, follow this 
procedure:
 
1. Open the resource pool file, and then open the file that will be the 
sharer file.

151
 Chapter 7: Optimizing Your Resources
 
2. Working in the sharer file, choose Resource➪Resource Pool➪Share 
Resources.
 
 The Share Resources dialog box appears.
 
3. Specify the resources for the project.
 
 If you want to specify that a project will use only its own resources (the 
default), select the Use Own Resources option. If you want to share 
resources, select the Use Resources option (see Figure 7-5) and then 
choose a project in the From list.
 
Figure 7-5: 
When many 
people rely 
on the same 
resources in 
a company, 
sharing 
resources 
becomes a 
good idea. 
 
4. Specify what Project should do when a conflicting resource setting, 
such as the resource base calendar, exists.
 
 If your project’s setting will take precedence, select the Sharer Takes 
Precedence option. If you want the pool setting to rule, select Pool

5. Click the OK button to complete the process.
 
 All resources in the specified resource pool are added to your own proj-
ect’s resource list, ready to be assigned to tasks.
After you add a shared resource to your project, you can update shared 
resource information. You would want to do this in case the person who 
maintains those shared resources has made a change, such as upping 
the resource’s rate per hour. To do this, choose Resource➪Resource 
Sharing➪Refresh Resource Pool.
 
If you combine separate projects into one master project at any point, Project 
allows you to have duplicated resources. If you link the combined projects 
and then delete a duplicate resource in the master project, it’s deleted in the 
subproject as well. A better practice is to have all the separate projects share 
resources from a resource pool so that no duplicate resources exist when you 
create the master project file.

Importing resources from Outlook
If you’re like I am, you’ve spent months or years building your list of e-mail 
contacts in Outlook. You might as well have a way to leverage all that work: 
Project supplies this in its capability to pull resources from Outlook.
 
You must have Outlook specified as your default e-mail program for this to 
work. Do that by opening Outlook; when you’re asked whether you want it to 
be your default program, say yes.
When you insert one or more Outlook resources in your project, they’re 
added to your project list, taking the resource name and e-mail address as 
they exist in the Outlook Address Book. The default first-letter initial and 
work type is also preassigned. You can then add any details you like to the 
resource.
To insert resources from your Outlook Address Book, display Resource Sheet 
view and then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Resource➪Add Resources➪Address Book.
 
 The Select Resources dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the desired resource in the Name list.
Drowning in the resource pool
Drawing resources from resource pools saves 
you time because you don’t have to re-create 
those resources again and again. However, 
should you track your resource’s time in the 
resource pool file to see whether the resource 
is overbooked? Most projects in the real world 
use resources that are not solely dedicated to 
a single project. New users of Project often get 
confused because almost every person work-
ing on their projects puts in time on other work, 
from general communication with coworkers 
and clients to efforts put in on other projects. 
Should they build resource pools to account 
for time shared among several projects at one 
time?
Generally speaking, it would be chaos to try to 
track every minute of all your resources’ days 
to see whether they’re working 100 percent or 
50 percent on your tasks or are being shared 
among multiple projects. Ask yourself this ques-
tion: When this resource works on a task in your 
project, “Will he or she put his entire focus on 
that task at that time?” If so, you may not need 
to fool around with tracking shared resources 
across many projects. Especially on shorter 
tasks, not trying to micromanage the efforts 
of your resources outside of your own project 
usually works just fine. If, on the other hand, you 
have resources who work only half time or split 
their time between two projects routinely, con-
sider using shared resource tools to keep track 
of those resources across projects.

3. Click Add to place the selected name in the Resources list.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to add all the resource names that you want to 
import to your project.
 
5. When you’re finished, click the OK button.
The names now appear in your project resource list, ready for you to add 
additional information.
Say, When Do These Guys Work?
In Chapter 3, you can read all about calendars, including Project, Task, and 
Resource calendars. Now that you’re working with resources, it’s worth a 
closer look at how Resource calendars work.
At first, the resources use the calendar that you assigned to the project: 
Standard, Night Shift, or 24 Hours. (You can also create custom calendars.)
 
✓ Standard is a typical 9-to-5 workday and a five-day workweek.
 
✓ Night Shift is an eight-hour work day, scheduled between 11 p.m. and 8 
a.m., with an hour off for a meal, from Monday through Friday.
 
✓ The 24 Hours base calendar shows just what it says: 24 hours per day, 7 
days per week.
Later on, you can change the schedule for your Resource calendar. For exam-
ple, you can specify working hours, such as 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 5 
p.m. for a standard eight-hour day, or 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. 
for a variation on that eight-hour day. Finally, you can select specific days 
when a resource is not available (for example, when someone will be on vaca-
tion, at an offsite seminar, or busy with another commitment) and mark them 
as nonworking.
 
Avoid micromanaging nonworking time for your resources because it can 
leave you no time to manage anything. For example, if someone is taking 
off half a day to go to a doctor’s appointment, it’s probably not necessary 
to block a day off. However, if a resource is taking a two-week vacation or a 
three-month sabbatical, it’s probably useful to modify that resource’s 
calendar.
To make all these settings, double-click the resource in Resource Sheet 
view to open its Resource Information dialog box and then click the Change 
Working Time button on the General tab (refer to Figure 7-4). The Change 
Working Time dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7-6.

Now That I’ve Got ’Em, How 
Do I Manage ’Em?
Before I leave the topic of resources, I’d be remiss if I didn’t tell you a bit 
about the vital project management skill of resource management. Here, in a 
nutshell, is your nickel tour of the art of managing the people who will make 
your project happen.
Acquiring the right resources
Just like an award-winning performance in a movie begins with casting the 
right actor, resource management starts with finding the right resources for 
your tasks. What makes a resource is a combination of factors. The right 
resource for a task is somebody who has
 
✓ The right skills for the task at hand (or who is trainable, if training is 
part of your budget)
 
✓ Enough time available to complete the task according to your schedule
 
✓ The ability to commit to the project (This sometimes involves getting 
another manager’s buy-in, so make sure that you’re building a supply of 
favor chips as needed.)
 
✓ A cost that fits in your budget
Although this list covers the basic requirements, consider other details, 
such as whether the resource is set up to work with the project team, and 
whether the technology to communicate and share documents is available 
(see Chapters 18 and 19 for more about this). Also, give some thought to how 
well each resource you choose will work as part of the team, and whether the 
resource can be considered dependable.
In Project, you have several ways to flag and find resources, categorizing 
them by skill or other criteria:
 
✓ Use the Resource Notes tab of the Resource Information dialog box 
to record information about a resource’s skills and abilities. Then use 
the Find feature to search note fields for words such as highly skilled, 
dependable, and trainable.
 
✓ Use the Code field in the Resource Information form to rank resources 
by skill, cost, or ability to work well with others.
 
✓ Create custom fields for resources to note specific skills and search for 
resources by those skills.

157
 Chapter 7: Optimizing Your Resources
 
Sometimes it’s worthwhile to consider using a less-experienced, cheaper 
resource to save money — just be sure to factor in the time and money 
needed for any training required.
Balancing workload
Another important part of resource management is managing the assignment 
of resources so that nobody is as overbooked as a CPA at tax time. Although 
occasional overtime is expected of most workers, constant overtime causes 
burnout and poor work quality. Keep in mind that a less skilled worker will 
take longer to do a task than a skilled worker. Take that into account when 
scheduling the time that resource might need to complete his or her work.
 
You get the scoop about making resource assignments in Chapter 9, and you 
read more about resolving resource overallocation in Chapter 10.
You can do three main things to stay aware of resource workload when work-
ing with Project:
 
✓ Keep an eye on your Project plan. Various tools, such as Resource 
Graph view (as shown in Figure 7-9), allow you to spot overbooking on 
tasks. Access these and other key resource views either via the bottom 
of the Gantt Chart button on the Task tab or in the Resource Views 
group of the View tab.
 
✓ Track the workload of individual resources. When tracking activity on 
tasks, you will receive an accounting from resources (see Chapter 13 for 
how to gather this accounting) about the actual time they’re spending 
on tasks. Notice the people who have to constantly put in overtime to 
keep their heads above water.
 
✓ Ask people. That’s right. This isn’t a feature of Project, but it’s an old-
fashioned communications device that works amazingly well. Check in 
with resources often and ask whether things are going okay — includ-
ing whether your human resources are being run ragged. Then help 
those who are overworked by modifying your schedule or adding other 
resources to help.
Managing conflict gracefully
Although the fine art of managing people and the conflicts they seem to get 
into is beyond the scope of a book on Microsoft Project, this topic is worth a 
word to the wise. Conflict resolution is a necessary skill for project managers. 
It involves creating an environment of cooperation and respect, building con-
sensus (agreement) among team members, and encouraging honest 
communication.

As a project manager, you can set up well-designed communications tools 
(such as frequent status meetings or reports) so that people stay in touch 
throughout your project. You can also make a point of staying alert to con-
flict — and nipping it in the bud. (A conflict ignored will only fester and 
become something worse.) Try to keep the focus of discussions on the proj-
ect goal, not on personalities.
In Chapter 16, I tell you all about designing and generating reports in Project 
that help you keep your resources in the loop. Chapter 18 provides several 
tools to help resources communicate clearly with each other, which can help 
you avoid misunderstandings.

Chapter 8
What’s All This Gonna Cost?
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how costs accrue
▶ Establishing work resource rates
▶ Specifying unit costs
▶ Adding fixed costs
▶ Allowing for overtime
▶ Estimating resource availability
▶ Working with budget resources
T
here’s no such thing as a free lunch — and if you use Project to track 
costs, there’s no such thing as a free resource because Project uses 
resources working on tasks as a way of calculating most of the costs of your 
project.
When you set up a resource, you specify a work resource rate (by default, 
this rate is tallied up per hour) or a material resource per use cost. You can 
also create cost resources, that is, a variable cost that isn’t calculated using 
a per-use or hourly rate but may be used several times in a project, such as 
travel expenses.
Some other factors come into play as well, such as how many hours a day a 
resource is available to work and any overtime rates. At the end of the day, 
all these settings come together to put you over — or under — budget.
In this chapter, you explore the relationship between resources and costs 
and also find out how to set resource standard and overtime rates, create 
fixed costs, and set the availability of resources on individual tasks in your 
project.

Mary, Mary, How Do Your Costs Accrue?
Project helps to account for costs on your various tasks with a combination 
of costs per hour, costs per use, costs per unit, fixed costs, and costs for spe-
cific assignments of cost resources. Before you begin to flesh out cost infor-
mation about your resources, you have to understand how these calculations 
work.
You’ll have two main pictures of the budget in your project: one at the 
moment you freeze your original plan (a baseline plan) and the ongoing 
picture of actual costs that comes from the activity and material usage you 
record as your project moves along. You record a certain amount of work 
effort on tasks, and tasks with resources assigned to them then run up costs 
based on the effort expended or units of materials used.
It all adds up
The best way to understand how costs add up in your project is to look at 
an example. John Smith (that’s not his real name) is managing a project that 
involves the building of a new gourmet ice-cream packaging plant. John has 
created a task called Install Ice-Cream Mixers. Here are the costs John antici-
pates for that task:
 
✓ About ten person-hours of effort to do the installation
 
✓ A cost per use of $500 paid to the mixer manufacturer to oversee the 
installation and train workers on the machine
 
✓ Twenty pounds of ice-cream ingredients to test the mixers
 
✓ $150 in shipping expenses for the mixers and supplies
 
✓ A fixed cost of $2,500 for the mixers themselves
The ten hours of effort will be expended by work resources. The total cost 
for the ten hours is a calculation: 10 × the resource rate. If the resource rate 
is $20, this cost totals $200. If two resources work on the task, one at a rate of 
$20 and one at a rate of $30, then (with effort-driven scheduling turned off by 
default) Project adds 20 hours of effort between them, and the resulting cost 
is $500.
The cost per use of $500 is a fee to the manufacturer, which is also created as 
a work resource. This cost won’t change based on the number of resources 
or the time involved.
The cost for 20 pounds of ice cream (any flavor you like) is calculated as 20 
× the unit cost of the ice-cream ingredients. If the unit cost is $2, this cost 
would be $40.

161
 Chapter 8: What’s All This Gonna Cost?
Shipping the new equipment and ice cream supplies to you will result in a 
charge of $150. You created Shipping as a cost resource, because there is no 
associated work, and you may have different shipping costs to apply to other 
tasks in the project.
Finally, you entered the $2,500 cost for the mixers themselves separately, as 
a fixed cost in the Cost table of Gantt Chart view.
And that’s how costs are assigned and how they add up on your projects.
 
You can create and assign resources that have no associated costs. For exam-
ple, if you want your boss to be available to review status reports but your 
company doesn’t require that your boss be charged to your project, you can 
simply use those resource assignments to remind you about the need for your 
boss’s availability on that day or at that time.
When will this hit the bottom line?
In business, you rarely get to choose when you pay your own bills. In Project, 
however, you can choose when your costs hit your budget.
Resources can be set to accrue at the start or end of the task that they’re 
associated with or to be prorated throughout the life of the task. So, if a 
three-month-long task begins April 1, a $90 cost resource could be added 
to your actual costs to date on day 1, on day 90, or at a dollar per day until 
the end of the task. Use the Accrue At field in Resource Sheet view or on the 
Costs tab of the Resource Information dialog box to set the accrual method.
This isn’t exactly a purely realistic reflection of how you have to pay for 
costs, because face it: Most bills come due 30 days after they hit your desk. 
It’s more a factor of when you want that cost to show up for the purposes of 
tracking costs and reporting expenses on your project.
It All Adds Up: Specifying 
Cost Info in Your Project
Most projects involve a combination of cost types: cost, work, and material. 
You have to do your homework before you can enter the information at the 
task or resource level. You have to find out the fixed costs as well as the 
hourly or unit rates for all your resources.
During the planning stages, you may not be able to anticipate exactly what 
a particular cost will be or know every resource’s rates. If you have to, build 
the resource or fixed cost with your best estimate. That way, at least some 

162
Part II: People Who Need People 
cost will be reflected in your plan, and you can go back to enter more accu-
rate information as soon as you know it.
 
Use a field in your Resource Sheet, such as Code, to designate resources as 
having estimated rates or costs so that you can easily go back to those tasks 
and update the estimates as your plan progresses.
You can’t avoid fixed costs
Maybe it’s that huge fee for the consulting company your boss insisted you 
use, even though you knew that the report wouldn’t tell you a thing you 
didn’t already know. Or perhaps it’s the $2,000 for a laptop computer you 
talked your boss into getting you so that you could manage your project 
when you’re on the road. Whatever it is, it’s a cost that won’t change no 
matter how many hours the task goes on or how many people work on the 
task. It has no unit cost or rate per hour, and no actual hours of work will be 
tracked. It’s a fixed cost.
You can specify a cost like this by creating a resource with a Cost type. Every 
time you assign the resource to a task, you specify the cost associated with it.
You can also simply enter a fixed cost associated with a task without having 
to create and assign a cost resource to it. To do so, you can use the Cost 
table in the sheet of Gantt Chart view.
 
Tables are preset column combinations that make entering certain information 
in a sheet pane easier.
Follow these steps to enter a fixed cost for a task:
 
1. Display the project in Gantt Chart view.
 
2. Choose View➪Tables➪Cost.
 
 The table of columns appears, as shown in Figure 8-1.
 
3. Click the Fixed Cost column for the task to which you want to assign 
the cost and then enter the amount.
That’s all there is to it, but because you can enter only one fixed-cost amount 
for a task, you should also enter a task note where you can itemize fixed 
costs if you have more than one. Note also that the default fixed-cost accrual 
method is prorated; if you prefer to have your fixed costs hit your budget at 
the start or end of a task, use the Fixed Cost Accrual column in this table to 
select another option.

When resources get paid per 
hour and tack on fees
Whether it’s minimum wage or the astronomical fees your lawyer charges 
you every time you sneeze, most people get paid something per hour. To rep-
resent most people involved in your project, you create work resources and 
charge them to your project at an hourly rate. Some resources also charge an 
additional flat fee for each use. For example, a plumber may charge a base fee 
of $75 and then add the cost per hour. That flat fee is a cost per use, added 
each time you assign the resource to a task, no matter how many hours are 
involved in completing the task.
After a resource has an hourly rate, when you then enter the estimate of how 
many hours that person will work on each task that he’s assigned to, Project 
totals his estimated costs in your plan and adds any cost per use. When you 
track actual effort expended on tasks, a calculation of actual effort times the 
hourly rate plus any cost per use returns actual costs.

164
Part II: People Who Need People 
 
By comparing estimated costs and actual costs, you get an ongoing picture of 
whether your project is on track.
To set resource rates per hour and cost per use for a work resource, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Display Resource Sheet view.
 
2. Click the Std. Rate column for the resource to which you want to 
assign a cost.
 
3. Type a dollar amount.
 
 If you’re entering a rate for a unit other than hours, type a slash (/) and 
then the unit (for example, year or month).
 
4. Press Tab twice to move to the Cost/Use column.
 
5. Type a dollar amount.
 
 This amount is the flat fee amount that will be added each time you 
assign the resource to a task.
 
6. Press Tab.
 
 The entry is completed.
Note that you can also make cost-rate entries in the Resource Information 
dialog box. The Costs tab of this dialog box, which is shown in Figure 8-2, 
offers a Standard Rate, an Overtime Rate, and a Per Use Cost column.
 
Figure 8-2: 
You can 
set several 
rates for a 
resource.
 

165
 Chapter 8: What’s All This Gonna Cost?
In addition, five tabs labeled A through E allow you to enter different rates 
for the resource. By using the Effective Date column, a resource could work 
for several months at one rate and then start working at a different rate on a 
preset date. This helps you account for periodic raises or seasonal shifts in 
rates (for example, paying a premium for construction resources in months 
with better weather when they are more in demand).
If you use ten gallons at $2 per gallon . . .
This one may feel like a problem from your high school algebra class. (So 
many gallons of water in a bathtub with a leak . . .) Well, if you weren’t that 
great at algebra, you’ll be glad to hear that Project makes a pretty straightfor-
ward calculation to arrive at the cost for using a material resource.
When you assign a work resource to a task, Project multiplies its standard 
hourly rate by the hours of work for the assignment. But material resources 
don’t have hours of work. You pay for them by the unit quantity, not by the 
hour. So, when you set up a material resource, you specify a standard rate 
for a single unit (per yard, or ton, or gallon, for example) and assign so many 
units to each task. The cost is tallied by the number of units times the cost 
per use. (Technically speaking, you also can assign a cost per use for a mate-
rial resource, but you’ll probably encounter few instances where you need to 
do so.)
To assign a standard unit rate for a material resource, follow these steps:
 
1. Display Resource Sheet view.
 
2. If you haven’t already done so, click the Material Label column for 
that resource and then type a unit name (such as gallon).
 
3. Click the Std. Rate column for the resource you want to set and then 
type a dollar amount (such as the cost per gallon).
 
4. Press Enter or Tab to finish your entry.
Note that you can also use the Resource Information dialog box to enter up 
to five standard unit rates with effective dates to account for fluctuations in 
unit cost over the life of your project.
Making allowances for overtime
Overtime is a fact of life: It’s great for people who earn it, albeit hard on the 
project manager with a budget. If you have resources that shift into earn-
ing overdrive after so many working hours, you can enter an overtime rate 

166
Part II: People Who Need People 
for them. The good news is that you as project manager retain control over 
whether the overtime rate is used in the project budget. You have to autho-
rize overtime on an assignment-by-assignment basis. I explore that little trick 
in Chapter 13.
To enter an overtime rate for a resource, follow this procedure:
 
1. Display Resource Sheet view.
 
2. Click the Ovt. Rate column for the resource.
 
3. Type an amount.
 
4. Press Enter or Tab.
 
 The entry is completed.
It’s an Availability Thing
Lots of Project features deal with resources — in particular, helping you 
spot resource overallocation. Overallocation is a calculation involving the 
resource’s calendar and availability.
So, consider Monica Melendez, an engineer who works a standard eight-hour 
day based on her calendar. Monica is assigned to the Write Final Report task 
at 50 percent of her availability and to the Create Design Specs task — which 
occurs at the same time as the report task — at 100 percent of her availabil-
ity. Monica is now working at 150 percent of her availability, or 12 hours per 
day. Poor Monica is overbooked.
By default, a resource is assigned to a task at 100-percent availability (or 
units), but you can modify that if you know that a resource will be assigned 
to several tasks and is likely to put in only part of that person’s time over the 
course of a task.
Setting availability
Availability is easier to estimate for some resources than for others. A man-
ager isn’t likely to give an entire day to any single task because he has to deal 
with all the people who report to him. Or, she has to sign authorizations, go 
to meetings concerning various projects, work on budgets, and so on. With a 
production worker, it may be simpler to pin down availability to a single task: 
If one manufacturing job is going through the line for three days and one 
person is working on the line all that time, it’s closer to the mark to say that 
he or she is working on that task full-time.

167
 Chapter 8: What’s All This Gonna Cost?
One big mistake that new users of Project make is to micro-think availability. 
Of course, no one actually spends eight hours every day on a single task in 
one project. People spend part of their days reading e-mail about company 
holidays, chatting with coworkers, and answering phone calls about non-
project-related stuff (you know — J Lo’s love life, UFOs landing at the U.N., 
the usual). A resource may spend seven hours on a task one day but only 
three the next. Don’t get hung up on a day-by-day resource schedule in esti-
mating availability. If over the life of a task, the person is pretty much devoted 
to it, 100-percent availability is a good setting. If that person will put in only, 
say, five days of work on a ten-day task, that’s 50-percent availability, whether 
she works four hours per day for ten days or five full days at any point.
 
The Units (availability) setting is there to help you spot the overbooking of a 
resource who may work on multiple tasks at the same time in a project schedule.
To set default resource units to specify availability, follow these steps:
 
1. Display Resource Sheet view.
 
2. Click the Max. (Max. Units) column for the resource.
 
3. Type a number representing the percentage of the time the resource is 
available to work on the project.
 
 For example, type 33 for a resource who’s available one-third of the 
time or 400 for a resource who can provide four workers full-time (that 
is, entries greater than 100% represent resources that will be provid-
ing a group or team to handle assignments). The most common entry 
here (the default entry) is 100 for a single resource working full-time on 
assignments in the project.
 
4. Press Enter or Tab.
 
 The entry is completed.
When a resource comes and goes
In addition to being available only a certain percentage of the time for a proj-
ect, a resource may be available for only a certain period of time during the 
life of the project. This commonly happens when you use a resource that 
you’re borrowing from another department, or when you’re working with a 
freelancer who has to squeeze your project in between two others. Another 
scenario may be a resource who’s available half-time for the first few days 
of the project and then full-time for the rest of the project. In that case, you 
enter a date range in the Available From and Available To columns of the 
Resource Availability area in the Resource Information dialog box (see Figure

Adding It Up: How Your Settings 
Affect Your Budget
In Chapter 9, you explore assigning resources to tasks. But to help round out 
this discussion of costs, you should know that in addition to a resource cost 
per hour and a resource base calendar and availability, you assign resources 

169
 Chapter 8: What’s All This Gonna Cost?
to tasks at certain units (percentages for work resources and quantity con-
sumed to for material resources). All these factors work together in calculat-
ing the cost of the resource when assigned to tasks.
Don’t worry about the calculations — Project does those for you. That’s the 
beauty of entering information in Project: After you make settings for your 
resources, Project does the work of tallying and showing total costs to you in 
views, such as the Cost table of Gantt Chart view shown in Figure 8-4.
For example, suppose that you want to assign a mechanic to a task. Here are 
the specifics:
Base calendar: Night Shift (eight hours, six days per week, between 11 
p.m. and 8 a.m.)
Cost per hour: $20
Overtime cost: $30
Availability: 100 percent
Assigned to a two-day task: 50 percent
What is the cost of this resource? Here’s how it works: Two days at half-time 
availability based on an eight-hour calendar is a total of eight hours (four hours 
per day). The resource incurs no overtime, so the cost is 8 × $20, or $160.

level give 
you a quick

170
Part II: People Who Need People 
Change two settings for the same resource, and see what you get:
Assigned to a two-day task: 150 percent
Overtime authorized: 8 hours
Now the resource is working 12 hours per day (150 percent of 8 hours) over 
two days. With 16 total hours at the standard rate ($20) and 8 hours of over-
time ($30), this person will cost $560.
Creating a Custom Text Field
The tables Project offers for sheet views often restrict you to particular types 
of entries. For example, you have to enter a numerical value in any cost-
related field. Project offers a number of placeholder fields that you can cus-
tomize for your own purposes and add into any task or resource table. There 
are text, cost, number, flag, and other types of fields that you can customize. 
A neat shortcut is to create a custom field with a lookup table.
A lookup table allows you to create a drop-down list of values in to select 
from for a custom field. That is, when you click on a cell in the field, you can 
then click the drop-down list arrow that appears an select from one of the 
predefined entries. Say that you want to add a field that indicates whether 
a resource has completed training. Creating a custom field with the lookup 
table offering the possible entries Yes, No, and Partial can make your data 
entry faster and also help prevent data-entry mistakes that could occur if the 
field had no restrictions. By default, only the entries in the lookup table may 
be entered for the field.
To create and use a custom text field with a lookup table, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the task or resource-oriented view, and then display the table 
that you want to customize.
 
 You display tables by choosing View➪Tables and selecting one from the 
list that appears.
 
2. Right-click any field column heading and choose Custom Fields from 
the shortcut menu that appears.
 
 The Custom Fields dialog box appears.
 
3. After selecting another of the placeholder fields in the Field list, if 
needed, click Rename.
 
4. Type a name for the field in the Rename Field dialog box, and click 
the OK button.

171

6. Enter a the possible value (text for a text field, a dollar amount for a 
cost field, and so on) in the Value column.
 
 Optionally, enter a description for each value in the Description column.
 
7. Repeat Step 6 to enter additional values for this field.
 
8. To set one of the entries as the default for the field, select the Use a 
Value from the Table as the Default Entry for the Field check box, 
click the desired value in the list, and click the Set Default button.
 
9. Click the Close button and then click OK to save the list and close all 
dialog boxes.
 
10. Add the field to the desired location in the table (refer to Chapter 2).

To create a different type of custom field, select the desired field type from the 
Type drop-down list of the Custom Fields dialog box after Step 2 of the previ-
ous procedure.
Working with Budgets
You can specify a resource as a budget resource by selecting the Budget 
check box in the Resource Information dialog box (see Figure 8-8). You then 
assign these resources to the project’s single summary task (the project sum-
mary task, task 0). Using budget resources, you can display fields that allow 
you to compare budgeted work with planned work. (Believe me, you often 
see a difference.) For example, you may have $10,000 budgeted for computer 
programmer time, and you may have planned to use $11,450 of resource work 
for programming. The budget setting can help you compare these amounts 
as you add and delete resources from various tasks.
 
Figure 8-8: 
Creating 
a budget

Select this option
If you assign a budget resource, you use Task Usage view or Resource Usage 
view to enter a work amount for that resource. You can view budgeted work 
by displaying the Budget Work field. Note that this field reflects only material 
and work resource type costs. You can display and use the Budget Cost field 
to view the budgeted amount for cost resource types.
Setting up and using budget information is a lengthy, but worthwhile, pro-
cess. If you want to delve in to the particulars, review the “Create a Budget 
for Your Project” topic in Project Help.

Chapter 9
Assigning Resources 
to Get Things Done
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how assigning resources affects task timing
▶ Making resource assignments
▶ Checking resource availability
▶ Using Team Planner view
▶ Notifying team members of their assignments
Y
ou may have entered a cost per hour (or per use) for every resource in 
your project, but those resources won’t cost you a thing — or, for that 
matter, get anything done — until you assign them to tasks.
When you do begin making assignments, several interesting things happen. Not 
only will your budget start to swell, but in some cases, your tasks may actually 
change duration. You may also start to see evidence of people who are over-
booked on several tasks that happen around the same time. Understanding 
how those results occur is key to making intelligent assignments.
However, your work won’t be over even when everything about your assign-
ments looks hunky-dory. That’s when you have to communicate the assign-
ments to your team and make sure that each resource agrees to take them 
on. If they don’t, it’s back to the assignment drawing board.
In fact, assigning resources is something of an ongoing process throughout 
your project. As usual, Project provides the tools to help you manage this 
entire process relatively painlessly.

176
Part II: People Who Need People 
You’d Be Surprised What Assignments 
Can Do to Your Timing
For autoscheduled tasks, the three task types (as I describe in Chapter 4) 
are fixed units, fixed work, and fixed duration. Each defines the relationship 
that balances a task’s duration, the work required to complete the task, and 
resource assignment units.
Your selection of task type — in combination with a setting that determines 
whether a task is effort-driven — has an effect on the timing of your tasks 
relative to your resource assignments. A formula behind the scenes does all 
the calculations for you.
For manually scheduled tasks, you can ignore this whole discussion for the 
most part. You can’t work with the task type or effort-driven setting for man-
ually scheduled tasks.
Pinning down your type
Essentially, task types specify what will remain constant in a task when you 
add work resources to it or remove work resources from it after making 
the initial resource assignment. Although this whole work, duration, and 
resource assignment percentage calculation can be complicated, you need to 
understand it if you want Project to accurately determine task durations in 
your plan according to resource assignments.
The default task type is fixed units. With a fixed-units task, the task dura-
tion you enter and the resource effort (work) assigned to that task jointly 
determine the timing of the task. With this task type, the assignment units 
you specify for your resources won’t change, even if the number of hours 
required to complete the task shrinks or grows.
With a fixed-units task, if you increase the duration of Task A from two to 
three days, your resources will continue to work on it at the assigned units 
for the specified duration; Project increases the Work amount accordingly. 
When you add or take away resources and you’ve enabled the effort-driven 
setting for the task (more on this shortly), Project changes the task duration 
accordingly, based on the assignment units you specify.
The fixed-work task type, on the other hand, takes a specified number of 
work units to be completed. A one-day task requires eight hours to be com-
pleted (assuming a Standard calendar). This type of task by default is effort-
driven and changes its duration in response to the number of resource units 
you assign.

177
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources to Get Things Done
With a fixed-work task, resource assignments may change in response to a 
work change. For example, suppose that Task A takes four days to complete 
when one person is assigned; with a fixed-work task, the same task takes only 
two days when two people are assigned. Project doesn’t modify the total 
hours of work required to complete the task, but it does modify the hours of 
work scheduled for each resource, based on assignment units, to complete 
that work within the specified time frame. So, if you increase the duration of 
Task A, resource assignment units (and thus assigned hours per day) shrink 
in response to maintain the same total number of hours. If you reduce the 
time to complete Task A, resource assignments increase to complete the 
unchanged amount of work hours in less time.
 
A fixed-duration task does not vary its length, no matter what resource assign-
ments you make.
With a fixed-duration task, Task A will take four days. If you assign additional 
resources or remove resources, the task still takes four days. When the task 
is not effort driven, more or fewer total hours of work will be added. If you 
enable the effort-driven setting, the hours assigned to each resource will 
change because the assignment units will change.
Figure 9-1 shows the same autoscheduled task with the three different types 
specified and with effort-driven scheduling enabled for two of them. Each 
task was created with a four-day duration and one resource at 100 percent. 
Then an additional resource was added at 100 percent. Note the resulting 
change — or lack of change — with each type and how the hours of work are 
assigned. The fixed-duration task didn’t change duration but did add more 
hours when not effort driven or reduce resource assignments when effort 
driven. The fixed-units task kept resource assignments constant at 100 
percent — and reduced the task duration when effort driven. Fixed work 
was accomplished faster, and the work (32 hours) stayed constant.
When effort is in the driver’s seat
Project’s complex calculation of work, task duration, and assignment units 
involves not only task types but also the effort-driven setting. (In Figure 9-1, 
the effort-driven setting is active for some of the tasks.)
With the effort-driven setting turned on, if you add resources to a task, 
Project distributes the specified work equally among them and may change 
the task duration according to the total resource effort, depending on the 
task type.

Figure 9-1: 
Select the 
task type

and enable

For the fixed-duration and fixed-units task types, Project assumes (by default) 
that each task is not effort driven. You can turn on the effort-driven setting 
if desired if you choose the fixed-duration or fixed-units task type. With the 
fixed-work task type selected, the effort-driven setting is turned on automati-
cally and can’t be turned off.
Follow these steps to change the settings for an effort-driven task:
 
1. Double-click a task.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Advanced tab, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
3. To turn off the effort-driven setting, deselect the Effort Driven 
check box.
 
 The effort-driven setting is on by default.
 
4. Click the OK button to save the new setting.

179
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources to Get Things Done
 
Figure 9-2: 
The effort-
driven 
setting is

Suppose Task calendars prevail?
One other setting on the Advanced tab of the Task Information dialog box, 
Scheduling Ignores Resource Calendars, has an effect on how resources are 
scheduled when you make task assignments. You can instruct Project to 
let the Task calendar override any Resource calendar setting for resources 
assigned to it. Then, for example, if a task is set to use the Standard calendar 
and a resource assigned to it uses a Night Shift calendar, that resource will 
work standard hours on that task.
 
In some situations, certain calendar settings won’t be available. Chapters 3 
and 7 provide details about how all kinds of Resource calendar settings work if 
you need a refresher course about this.
Use this setting to provide some timing flexibility in your task: for example, if 
someone who normally works the night shift will be called on to attend a two-
day seminar that takes place during standard working hours.
Finding the Right Resource
Sometimes no one in the world can perform a certain task like Albert, and 
you’ll get Albert to do that job if it kills you. Other times, just about anyone 
could handle the work.
If any Tom, Dick, or Mary with a certain skill level (or a certain rate per hour) 
will do, you can use Project features to find the right resource and make sure 
that he or she has enough time to take on just one more task.

180
Part II: People Who Need People 
Needed: One good resource willing to work
You’ve probably used the Find feature in other software to find a word or 
phrase or number. That’s child’s play compared with Project’s Find feature, 
which can find you a backhoe, a corporate jet, or even a person! You can use 
Project’s Find feature to look for resources with certain rates or in a certain 
workgroup. You can search for resources by their initials, their maximum 
assignment units, their standard or overtime rate, and so on.
For example, you may need to find a resource whose standard rate is less 
than $50 per hour. Or, you may want to find someone who can put in extra 
work on a task, so you search for any resource whose maximum units are 
greater than 100 percent. (In other words, the resource can put in a longer-
than-usual day before he or she is considered overallocated.) Perhaps you 
need to find a material resource that is a chemical measured in gallons, but 
you can’t remember the exact chemical name. In that case, you can search 
for resources whose material label includes the word gallons.
 
To find resource information, you must be working in a resource-oriented 
view. To find task information, you must be working in the task-oriented view.
First display any resource view and then follow these steps to find resources 
in Project:
 
1. On the Task tab, click Find in the Editing group.
 
 The Find dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Searching 
combines

some ele-
ment in a 
particular 
field that

certain 
criterion.
 
 
2. In the Find What box, type the text you want to find.
 
 For example, type 50 if you want to search for a resource with a stan-
dard rate of $50 per hour or less, or laboratory if you want to find a 
resource whose material label contains that word.

181
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources to Get Things Done
 
3. From the Look in Field list, choose the name of the field that you want 
to search in.
 
 For example, to search for resources that have a maximum unit assign-
ment percentage of more than 100 percent, choose the Max Units field 
here. Or, choose Standard Rate to search based on the resource’s hourly 
rate.
 
4. In the Test box, select a criterion.
 
 For maximum units of more than 100 percent, for example, this choice 
would be Is Greater Than. Or, for a rate less than $50 per hour, this 
choice would be Is Less Than.
 
5. If you prefer to search backward from your current location (that is, 
the currently selected cell in the task list) instead of forward, choose 
Up from the Search box.
 
6. If you want to match the case of the text, select the Match Case 
check box.
 
7. To begin the search, click the Find Next button.
 
8. Continue to click Find Next until you find the instance you’re looking for.
You can also use the Find feature to find and replace an entry. For example, 
if your Manufacturing department (MFG) changes its name to Production 
(PDTN), you can search the Group field for the code MFG. In the Find dialog 
box, click the Replace button, and type PDTN in the Replace With box, as 
shown in Figure 9-4. Then click the Replace button to replace each instance 
one by one or click the Replace All button to replace every instance of that 
entry in that field, wherever it occurs in your project.

Part II: People Who Need People 
Custom fields: It’s a skill
When assigning resources, you often need to take a person’s skills into 
account. If a person with less skill or experience could work on a particular 
task (and save you money because he or she has a lower rate per hour), 
wouldn’t it be nice to be able to find such resources easily?
Well, Project doesn’t include a Skill field, but it does allow you to add fields 
of your own. You can use these fields for anything, but one great way to use 
them is to code your resources by skill level. You can use a rating system 
such as A, B, and C, or use terms such as Exp for an experienced worker and 
Beg for a beginning-level worker.
Here’s how to add a custom field:
 
1. Display the Resource Sheet (or whatever sheet you want to view the 
custom field in).
 
2. Scroll to the right, and click the Add New Column column heading.
 
3. Type a name for the field, and press Enter.
You can enter whatever you like in this column for each resource in your 
project. Then you can search for specific entries in that field using the Find 
feature, or turn on a filter to display only resources with a certain skill level 
in that field. (Read more about filters in Chapter 10.)
 
The custom field created using the above method actually uses one of the Text 
1 through Text 30 placeholder fields available for you to customize. You can 
customize other types of placeholder fields, such as cost fields. To access more 
custom fields, right-click a field column heading, and click Custom Fields.
 
Some organizations designate custom fields for certain company information 
such as an accounting code or vendor rating. If you have a Project administra-
tor who is in charge of these enterprise-wide standards, check with him or her 
before you choose a custom field to designate skill level.
A Useful Assignation
If you understand how task types and effort-driven scheduling can affect your 
tasks’ timing, you’ve fought 95 percent of the battle in assigning resources. 
The rest is just the software equivalent of paperwork. First, you have to 
create resources before you can assign them. (If you haven’t, wander to 
Chapters 7 and 8 for a refresher course.) After you create resources, you 

183
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources to Get Things Done
can use a couple of methods to assign them to tasks and also specify the 
resource assignment units. These assignment units differ slightly between 
work resources and material and cost resources, however, so read on.
Determining work material and cost-
resource assignment units
Work resources, which are typically people, are assigned to a task using a 
percentage: for example, 100 percent, 50 percent, or 150 percent. When you 
assign a resource at a percentage, the assignment is based on the Resource 
calendar. A resource with a Standard calendar will put in eight hours a day if 
you assign it at 100-percent assignment units. Theoretically, a resource with 
a 24-hour calendar will work a grueling 24 hours a day at 100 percent (and 
probably fall right over) or 12 hours at 50 percent.
A material resource is assigned in units, such as gallons, consulting sessions, 
yards, or tons. When you assign a material resource to a task, you designate 
how many units of that resource will go to that task.
A cost resource is one that incurs a variable cost every time you assign it. 
For example, if you create a cost resource called Permit Fee, every time 
you assign a permit fee to a task, you can designate the actual cost for that 
assignment, whether it’s $25 or $125.
 
Note that cost and material resource units are not part of the entire work-unit-
duration calculation that can cause work resource assignments to change task 
durations.
Making your assignments
You have three main methods of making resource assignments in Project 
(although there are other methods you can use working in various views):
 
✓ Select resources from the Resources tab of the Task Information 
dialog box
 
✓ Enter resource information in the Resource column in the Entry table 
(displayed in Gantt Chart view)
 
✓ Use the Assign Resources dialog box
You need to work in a task-based view, such as Gantt Chart view, to make the 
assignments.

184
Part II: People Who Need People 
Which method you use depends to some extent on your own preferences, but 
generally speaking, here are some parameters for using each method:
 
✓ When you use the Resource column, you’re assigning at a default 100 
percent assignment. If you want to assign a different percentage, don’t 
use this method. It’s also harder to use this method if you need to assign 
multiple resources.
 
✓ Use the Assign Resources dialog box if you may want to replace one 
resource with another (there’s a handy Replace feature in this dialog 
box) or if you want to filter the list of available resources by a criterion 
(for example, resources with a cost of less than a specified amount). 
This is very useful for making multiple resource assignments.
 
✓ Work in the Task Information dialog box if it’s helpful to have task 
details (such as task type or the constraints contained on other tabs of 
this dialog box) handy when you make the assignment.
Picking resources from the Resource column
You can use this method to add resources in a resource column, whether 
from Gantt Chart view or Tracking Gantt view.
 
Even though it lists tasks in its sheet pane and can even display a Resource 
column, Task Usage view cannot be used to add resource assignments.
Follow these steps to assign resources at a default percentage:
 
1. Display Gantt Chart view by clicking the Gantt Chart button on the 
Task or View tab of the Ribbon.
 
2. Choose View➪Tables➪Entry.
 
3. Click in the Resource Names column for the task on which you want to 
make a resource assignment.
 
 An arrow appears at the end of the cell.
 
4. Click the arrow to display a list of resources.
 
5. Click the resource you want to assign.
 
 The resource name appears in the Resource column, assigned at 100 
percent.
 
You can always change the assignment units later by opening the Task 
Information dialog box and changing the assignment units on the 
Resources tab.

185
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources to Get Things Done
Using the Assign Resources dialog box
To assign a work or material resource to a task, you can select a task and 
then use the Assign Resources dialog box to make assignments. This is an 
easy method to use for assigning material and cost resources. To use the 
Assign Resources dialog box, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Assign Resources button in the Assignments group of the 
Resource tab on the Ribbon.
 
 The Assign Resources dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-5.
 
Figure 9-5: 
Every 
resource 
you’ve 
created is 
shown in 
this list.
 
 
2. Click a task to select it.
 
 The Assign Resources dialog box can remain open while you select tasks 
in the task list. This enables you to make assignments to a variety of 
tasks without the need to close and reopen the dialog box repeatedly.
 
3. Click the Units column for the work or material resource you want to 
assign. Click the Cost column for the cost resource you want to assign.
 
4. Specify the assignment units or cost for the resource.
 
 Click the spinner arrows in the box to increase or decrease the setting. 
For a work resource, change the percentage units in 50-percent incre-
ments by clicking the arrows; or, simply type a percentage. For a mate-
rial resource, use the spinner arrows in the Units column to increase or 
decrease the unit assignment, or type in a number of units. For a cost 
resource, type in the expected cost for that particular assignment.
 
5. Click the Assign button.
 
6. Repeat Steps 2–5 to add all resources.

186
Part II: People Who Need People 
 
7. If you want to replace one resource with another, click an assigned 
resource (indicated with a check mark), click the Replace button, 
select another name on the list, set its units, and click OK.
 
8. Click the Close button to save all the assignments.
Adding assignments in the Task Information dialog box
Finally, you can assign resources on the Resources tab of any Task 
Information dialog box by following these steps:
 
1. Double-click a task name in Gantt Chart view.
 
 The Task Information dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Resources tab to display it.
 
3. Click in a blank Resource Name box and then click the arrow that 
appears at the right side of the box.
 
 A drop-down list of resources appears.
 
4. Click the resource you want to assign.
 
5. For a work or material resource, click the Units column and use the 
spinner arrows to set an assignment percentage. For a cost resource, 
click the Cost column and enter the cost.
 
 If you’re assigning a material resource, the Units default is a single unit. 
(If your units are pounds, the default assignment is 1 lb.) Use the spinner 
arrows in the Unit field or type a value there to assign additional mate-
rial units.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3–5 to assign additional resources.
 
7. Click the OK button.
Getting the contour that’s right for you
When you make a work resource assignment, Project spreads the work out 
evenly over the life of the task. However, you can modify the level of work that 
goes on during the life of an auto-scheduled task — called a work contour — so 
that more work takes place near the beginning, middle, or end of the task.
For example, if you know that the people on a task to install a new computer 
network will have to spend some time up front studying the manuals and 
reviewing the schematics for the wiring before they can begin to make measur-
able progress on the installation, you may use a late-peaking contour. Or, if you 
know that people are likely to put in a lot of work up front on a survey — and 
then sit back and wait for the results to come in — you may choose an early-
peaking contour.

187
 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources to Get Things Done
Using a different contour on a particular resource’s task assignment could 
free that resource to work on a second task that occurs during the life of the 
first task. This can help you resolve a resource conflict.
 
The contour you select will have slightly different effects depending on the 
task type. Trust me: Most project managers don’t even want to try to under-
stand this complex equation. Simply try a different contour and see whether 
it solves your problem and doesn’t make too dramatic a change to your task 
duration or other resource assignments.
To set a task’s contour, follow these steps:
 
1. Display Task Usage view.
 
 This view shows resource assignments by task.
 
2. Double-click a resource assignment.
 
 The Assignment Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-6.
 
Figure 9-6: 
This is a 
handy sum-
mary of all 
information 
about a 
resource’s 
assignment 
on a task.
 
 
3. From the Work Contour box, choose one of the preset patterns.
 
4. Click the OK button to save the setting.
 
 A symbol for the contour pattern is displayed in the Indicator column 
for the resource.
 
 If none of these patterns fits your situation, you can manually modify a 
resource’s work by changing the number of hours the resource puts in 
day by day on a task in Task Usage view.
Before you save, make sure that your modifications add up to the number of 
hours you want, or you could inadvertently change the resource’s assignment.

Part II: People Who Need People 
 
Resource Usage view is useful for reviewing resource assignments at this 
stage. This view gives a side-by-side comparison between a single resource’s 
workload and all the tasks going on during a particular time period in your 
project.
A Helpful Planner
One thing you may notice after making resource assignments is that a little 
person icon appears as an indicator beside some tasks in Gantt Chart view. 
If you switch to a resource-oriented view, you may see that some resource 
names now display in red. These changes are Project’s little way of telling 
you that you are starting to overbook resources in the plan.
The Professional Edition of Project 2010 offers a new view called Team 
Planner that you can use to make sure that you’ve spread the work among 
resources in a manageable way. This view enables you to move assignments 
among resources, assign tasks that haven’t been assigned, and even schedule 
tasks that haven’t been scheduled. Figure 9-7 shows Team Planner view.

 Chapter 9: Assigning Resources to Get Things Done
 
Team Planner view is just one of the tools you can use to deal with over-
booked resources. Chapter 10 presents even more methods for fixing work-
load issues.
As you can see in Figure 9-7, when two tasks assigned to a resource overlap 
and cause the resource to be overbooked (or overallocated), thin red bars 
appear above and below the overbooked period. The view also shows you 
any tasks that are unassigned or don’t have enough schedule information to 
be scheduled.
To change to Team Planner view, click the bottom half of the Gantt Chart 
button on the Task tab of the Ribbon and then click Team Planner. Or, if 
you’re working on the Resource tab, click the Team Planner button at the 
far left. To view unassigned tasks, drag the bar at the bottom that shows the 
number of unassigned tasks up, dropping it to split the view as desired.
From there, you can drag and drop to correct a number of schedule issues, 
and you can use the following techniques in any combination:
 
✓ To fix a resource overallocation: Drag one of the overlapping tasks to 
the left or right to change its schedule. If you want to reassign the task 
to another resource, drag the task up or down to that resource.
 
✓ To assign an unassigned task: Drag the task up to the row for the 
resource to which you want to assign the task.
 
✓ To schedule an unscheduled task: Drag the task to the right, onto the 
timescale portion of the view, and then drop the task into the desired 
schedule position.
 
Dragging horizontally in Team Planner view changes the task schedule, while 
dragging vertically from one resource to another changes the task assignment.
Communicating an Assignment 
to Your Team
After you work out all your resource assignments on paper, see whether your 
ideas will work for your resources’ schedules.
Of course, you should check to see who is available for your project. And 
because things can change in the time it takes to work out your plan and 
make assignments, make sure that your resources are committed to you 
before you commit yourself to a final plan.

190
Part II: People Who Need People 
 
If you use Project Server and Project Web App with Project, you can use col-
laborative tools to publish assignments to a server, where people can review 
them and accept or decline. For more on Project Web App, see Chapters 18 
and 19.
You can send your entire project plan to resources as an e-mail attachment 
or just send selected tasks. You can also generate a resource assignment 
report and send that to people so that they can review their assignments in 
detail.
It’s in the e-mail
E-mail can be a project manager’s best friend. You can use it to communicate 
throughout the life of your project and to send your project plan for review 
at various stages. One of those stages is the point at which you want your 
resources to commit to their task assignments. You can send your project as 
an e-mail attachment so that resources can review the assignments you’ve 
mapped out and give you their feedback.
To send a project as an e-mail attachment, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Share➪Send as Attachment➪Send as Attachment.
 
 An e-mail form is displayed, as shown in Figure 9-8.
 
2. Fill in a subject and write your e-mail message.
 
3. Click the Send button to send the message.
 
To help you track e-mails to resources on your project, set your e-mail pro-
gram to provide return receipts when messages are received or read.
Going the Project Web App route
Project Web App allows you to do a lot of com-
municating and interacting with your team 
online, including notifying people of assign-
ments, allowing them to see your Project plan 
(even if they don’t have Project installed), and 
requesting status reports. You can also use 
features of Project Web App to view resource 
availability, build a resource team from an 
enterprise resource pool, and review resource 
assignments across projects. Chapters 18 and 
19 give you an overview of Project Web App, 
which requires that your organization have 
Project Server installed. If your organization 
decides to implement this enterprise approach 
to project management, it can make your life 
much easier!

Report your findings
Remember the days when you read a report on paper, instead of on your 
computer screen? Those days aren’t gone: In lots of situations, a printed 
report is your best bet for clear communication about your project.
You can use several assignment reports to inform your human resources of 
their assignments on projects. To help you, the four assignment report types 
provide the following information:
 
✓ Who Does What report: Provides a list of tasks organized by resource 
with total work hours, number of days delay from the original schedule, 
and start and finish dates. It also reflects a total number of work hours 
for a resource on all tasks in the project.
 
✓ Who Does What When report: Shows a calendar that lists tasks orga-
nized by time period with resource assignment totals.
 
✓ To-Do List report: Generated for a single resource (not all resources, as 
with the other report types) week by week in a project. It lists the task 
names, durations, start and finish dates, and predecessor tasks by task 
number.
 
✓ Overallocated Resources report: Shows resource assignments for 
human resources who are overbooked on tasks during the project, 
including total hours, unit assignments, total hours of work on each 
task, and any delay from the original schedule.

hen you’ve charted a course for your project, it’s 
time for the critical eye: Does your project plan 
pass muster in terms of budget and timing? If not, you 
can use the built-in Project tools to tinker with resource 
assignments, adjust task timing, trim costs, and meet 
deadlines. Result: a better final plan. You also get a look 
at modifying how items in your project are formatted, 
including calling out the critical tasks in the plan. After 
all, a polished presentation, whether on-screen or in 
print, is invaluable.

A
s they say, the best-laid schemes of mice and project managers go oft 
awry (or is that “gang aft agley?”), and your plans are no different. After 
you take your best shot at laying out your project plan, creating every task, 
and assigning every resource — and you think you’re ready to start your 
project — think again.
A close look at almost any plan will reveal some issues that you should 
resolve before you begin working on your first task. These may include a 
schedule that ends a month after your desired finish date, human resources 
who are assigned to work 36-hour days, or a budget that exceeds the national 
debt. (Details, details . . .)
But even if you don’t see any glaring problems in the areas of time, workload, 
or money, you should do a few things to make sure that your project is as 
realistic as possible before you commit to it. So take a moment to give your 
project the once-over.

198
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
Everything Filters to the Bottom Line
A first step in making sure that your plan is solid is simply looking at it from a 
few different perspectives. It’s like walking around a car to see all its features 
before you fork over the down payment. Filters help you get that kind of 
perspective.
Two major problem areas that filters can help you examine at this stage are
 
✓ Overallocated resources: These are resources working more than the 
number of hours you specified.
 
✓ Tasks on a critical path: A critical path consists of the series of tasks in 
your project that must happen on time for the project to meet its final 
finish date. (Chapter 11 shows you how to format the critical path in 
Gantt Chart view.)
 
 Any task that has slack — that is, any length of time that it could be 
delayed without delaying the entire project’s timing — is not on the 
critical path. If your project has little in the way of slack, any delays that 
occur are likely to derail your project.
Predesigned filters
Filters are like the Zoom feature in your word processor: They give you a 
closer look at various aspects of your plan and help you spot clues about 
problems (such as overallocated resources). You can set a filter to high-
light tasks or resources that meet certain criteria or to remove any tasks or 
resources from view that don’t meet such criteria.
Project provides predesigned filters that you can simply turn on for tasks or 
resources, using criteria such as the following:
 
✓ Tasks with a cost greater than a specified amount
 
✓ Tasks on the critical path
 
✓ Tasks that occur within a certain date range
 
✓ Milestone tasks
 
✓ Tasks that use resources in a resource group
 
✓ Tasks with overallocated resources
 
Several filters, such as Slipping Tasks and Overbudget Work, help you spot 
problems after you’ve finalized your plan and are tracking actual progress. 
(See Chapter 13 for more about tracking.)

199
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
You can access filters in a couple of ways. When you use the Filter drop-
down list, you choose from a list of built-in filters. The filters act to remove 
any tasks from view that don’t meet specified criteria.
To turn on such filters from the View tab of the Ribbon, follow these steps:
 
1. Display a resource view (such as Resource Sheet view) to filter for 
resources or a task view (such as Gantt Chart view) to filter for tasks.
 
2. Click the Filter list in the Data group of the View tab and then choose 
a criterion.
 
 The Filter list is a drop-down list; when no filter is applied, All Tasks 
or All Resources appears in the list. If you choose a filter that requires 
input, you’ll see a dialog box such as the one shown in Figure 10-1. 
Otherwise, the filter is applied immediately and removes from view any 
resources or tasks that don’t match your criteria.
 
Figure 10-1: 
Some filters 
require you 
to enter 
parameters.
 
 
3. If a dialog box is displayed, fill in the information and then click the 
OK button.
 
 The filter is applied.
To redisplay all tasks or resources, click Filter on the View tab and then click 
[No Filter].
Putting AutoFilter to work
Project 2010 has an AutoFilter feature that’s turned on by default for all new 
schedule files. Arrows appear at the head of columns in the currently dis-
played sheet. Click the arrow for the Resource Names column (for example), 
and the name of every resource assigned to tasks in your project is listed in 
alphabetical order, along with other filtering and sorting choices. See Figure 
10-2 for an example. In the AutoFilter list for a column, click check boxes to 
control which items appear on-screen. Checked items appear, and unchecked 
items are hidden by the filter. If you want to display few items, clear the 
Select All check box first to deselect all the items and then click the check 
boxes for the individual items to show to reselect them.

200
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
 
Figure 10-2: 
Deselect 
the check 
box beside 
any item to 
hide it.
 
You can also choose the Filters choice from an AutoFilter menu to access 
predefined filters or click Custom and create a custom filter. For example, 
Figure 10-3 shows the predefined Is Greater Than filter that’s available for the 
cost-related fields in the Cost table. In this case, the filter will show any task 
with a Cost (Total Cost) greater than $5,000.
 
Figure 10-3: 
AutoFilter 
choices are 
specific to 
each field 
of informa-
tion in your 
sheet.
 
Follow these steps to use AutoFilter:
 
1. Display the view and table that contain the fields (columns) you want 
to filter.
 
 Arrows appear at the top of each column.
 
2. Click the arrow on the column that you want to filter.

201
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
 
3. Use either the list or the Filters submenu to select a filter.
 
 To use the list, you can first deselect the Select All check box and then 
click to reselect individual items to show. If you select Filters, you can 
click a predefined filter. For example, if you are filtering for task dura-
tion, in the Duration column, you can choose 1 day or less, Between 1 
Day and 1 Week, or 1 Week or Longer; or you can choose another of the 
listed filters and then specify filter criteria. The Clear Filter from Field 
Name choice removes a previously-applied filter.
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 All tasks or resources that don’t meet your criteria disappear.
 
If you want to apply a highlight to each item that meets your filter criteria 
rather than remove nonmatching items from view, use the Highlight list in the 
Data group of the View tab.
Do-it-yourself filters
You don’t have to use predesigned filters: You can get creative and design 
your own filters. To define a new filter, you specify a field name, a test, and a 
value.
For example, the following filters for any task on the critical path:
Critical (field name) Equals (test) Yes (value)
You can also include additional qualifiers to the filter. The following filters for 
tasks that are both on the critical path and have a baseline cost of more than 
$5,000:
Critical (field name) Equals (test) Yes (value)
and
Baseline Cost (field name) Is Greater Than (test) 5000 (value)
Here’s how to build your own filter definition:
 
1. Choose View➪Filter➪More Filters.
 
 The More Filters dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-4.
 
2. Select either the Task or Resource option to specify which list of filters 
you want the new filter to be included in.
 
3. Click the New button.
 
 The Filter Definition dialog box appears.

202
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
 
Figure 10-4: 
This dialog 
box lists all 
available fil-
ters, built-in 
and custom.
 
 
4. In the Name field, type a name for the filter.
 
5. Click the first line of the Field Name column, and then click the down 
arrow that appears to display the list of choices, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
Figure 10-5: 
Give your 
new filter a 
name that 
describes 
what it 
does.
 
Click this arrow
 
6. Click a field name to select it.
 
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for the Test and Value(s) columns.
 
• Test is a condition that must be met, such as does not equal or is 
greater than.
 
• Value(s) is either a value you enter (such as a specific date or 
cost) or a predetermined value (such as baseline cost).
 
8. If you want to enter a qualifier, such as a dollar amount, click the 
entry box above the column headings and then type the amount at the 
end of the filter definition.
 
 For example, if you choose Cost for the field name and Equals for the 
test, you may enter the number 5000 at the end of the definition in the 
entry box.

203
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
 
9. If you want to add another condition, choose And or Or from the And/
Or column and then make choices for the next set of Field Name, Test, 
and Value(s) boxes.
 
 Note that you can cut and paste rows of settings you’ve made to rear-
range them in the list, or use the Copy Row or Delete Row button to per-
form those actions for filters with several lines of criteria.
 
10. If you want the new filter to be shown in the list when you click the 
Filter list on the View tab, select the Show in Menu check box.
 
11. Click the Save button to save the new filter and then click Apply to 
apply the filter to your plan.
 
You can click the Organizer button in the More Filters dialog box to copy fil-
ters you’ve created in one Project file to another file.
Gathering Info in Groups
Remember those groups you used to hang out with in high school? (I’m sure 
you were part of the cool group!) Groups helped you see the underlying order 
of your adolescent hierarchy. Project lets you group things, too. The Group 
feature essentially allows you to organize information by certain criteria. For 
example, you can use the Group feature if you want to see resources orga-
nized by work group, or you may organize tasks by their duration, shortest to 
longest.
Organizing tasks or resources in this way may help you spot a potential 
problem in your project: for example, if you find that the majority of your 
resources at project startup are unskilled or that most of the tasks at the end 
of your project are on the critical path. Like filters, groups come predefined, 
or you can create custom groups. Groups have an outlining-like functionality 
as well. You can collapse and expand groups to better zero in on the tasks or 
resources you want to examine more closely.
Applying predefined groups
Predefined groups are quick and easy to apply and cover a host of common 
requirements in projects. Follow these steps to apply a predefined group 
structure to your project:
 
1. Display either a resource view (such as Resource Sheet view) to group 
resources or a task view (such as Gantt Chart view) to group tasks.

204
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
 
2. On the View tab, click the Group By list in the Data group and then 
choose a criterion.
 
 The information is organized according to your selection. Figure 10-6 
shows an example. In it, Resource Usage view has been grouped by 
resource type, and assignments for some of the Work resources have 
been collapsed.
 
Figure 10-6: 
Organizing 
tasks to 
show only 
tasks in 
progress 
provides 
this view of 
your project.
 
To redisplay all tasks or resources in their original order, click the arrow in 
the Group list on the View tab to display the list and click [No Group]. (When 
no group is applied, the Group box displays [No Group].)
Devising your own groups
Custom groups include three elements: a field name, a field type, and an 
order. For example, you may create a group that shows the field name 
(such as Baseline Work) and a field type (such as Tasks, Resources, or 
Assignments) in a certain order (Descending or Ascending). A group that 
shows Baseline Work for Tasks in Descending order, for example, would list 
tasks in order from the most work hours required to the least. Other settings 
you can make for groups control the format of the group’s appearance, such 
as the font used or a font color applied.

205
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
Follow these steps to create a custom group:
 
1. Choose View➪Group By➪More Groups.
 
 The More Groups dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-7.
 
Figure 10-7: 
This dia-
log box is 
organized 
by task- or 
resource-
oriented 
groups.
 
 
2. Select either Task or Resource to specify in which list of groups you 
want the new group to be included.
 
3. Click the New button.
 
 The Group Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-8.
 
Figure 10-8: 
Use your 
own groups 
to organize 
data.
 
 
4. In the Name field, type a name for the group.
 
5. Click the first line of the Field Name column, click the down arrow 
that appears to display the list of choices, and then click a field name 
to choose it.

206
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
 
6. Repeat Step 5 for the Field Type and Order columns.
 
 Note that if you want the Field Type option of grouping by assign-
ment rather than by resource or task, you must first select the Group 
Assignments, Not Tasks check box to make that field available to you. 
Otherwise, the Field Type of Task or Resource appears by default.
 
7. If you want to add another sorting criteria, click a Then By row and 
make choices for the Field Name, Field Type, and Order columns.
 
8. If you want the new group to be shown in the list when you click the 
Group box on the Formatting toolbar, select the Show in Menu 
check box.
 
9. Depending on the field name you’ve chosen, you can make settings 
for the font, cell background, and pattern to format your group.
 
 For example, the font and color of each duration group heading back in 
Figure 10-6 was determined by making choices from these three lists.
 
10. If you want to define intervals for the groups to be organized in, click 
the Define Group Intervals button.
 
 This displays the Define Group Intervals dialog box; use the settings 
here to set a starting time and an interval. For example, if the Group By 
criterion is Standard Rate and you select Interval as the Group On set-
ting and enter a Group Interval of 10.00, groupings would be in $10 inter-
vals (those making 0–$10 an hour in one grouping, those making $11–$20 
in another, and so on).
 
11. Click the Save button to save the new group and then click Apply to 
apply the group to your plan.
 
If you want to make changes to an existing predefined group, choose 
View➪Group By➪More Groups. In the More Groups dialog box, make sure 
that the group is selected and then click the Edit button. The Group Definition 
dialog box then appears so that you can edit all those settings for an existing 
group.
Figuring Out What’s Driving Your Project
With all the things going on in a project — perhaps hundreds of tasks, thou-
sands of dependencies, calendars, and so on — it can be hard to see why 
your project plan has turned out the way it has. Four features in Project 2010 
can help you to see what’s driving your project and make those all-important 
tweaks before you finalize your project plan:
 
✓ Task Inspector pane is a powerful feature that tells you what is driving 
the timing of tasks in your project, as well as identifies problems and 
suggests solutions.

207
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
 
✓ Task Warnings and Suggestions help you to identify possible schedule 
issues with manually scheduled tasks.
 
✓ Multiple Undo allows you to try different approaches and then undo 
several changes in a row.
 
✓ Change Highlighting helps you see the results of any change you make 
to your plan.
Inspecting tasks
When you play a game of golf, several factors affect your game. You may be 
getting a cold, the weather could be bad, or you could have been handed a 
defective club. (These are the reasons I give myself.) Likewise, the timing of 
every task in your project is affected by certain conditions called task driv-
ers. The Task Inspector pane can help you recognize these conditions, which 
could include the following:
 
✓ Actual Start Date or Assignments: You have entered an actual start 
date, or you have made a resource assignment to a task and the 
resource is not available.
 
✓ Calendars: You have assigned a different calendar to the task, resource, 
or both, and the calendar differences are causing a scheduling issue.
 
✓ Leveling Delay: If you turned on leveling to deal with resource overallo-
cations, it may have caused a delay on a task.
 
✓ Constraints: You apply a constraint to a task, such as forcing it to finish 
on a certain date.
 
✓ Summary Tasks: Summary tasks’ timing are driven by the timing of their 
child tasks or subtasks.
 
✓ Dependency Relationships: A predecessor task can cause changes in a 
task’s timing.
Even though you specify start and finish dates for manually scheduled tasks, 
you can use Task Inspector to check to ensure the task schedule you’ve 
established works in conjunction with other tasks. Project performs behind-
the-scenes calculations to determine when each manually scheduled task 
is likely to occur based on predecessors and how long it will take. If Project 
detects that the task is likely to get off track, it gives a warning about the 
potential problem and suggests a fix.
To display the Task Inspector pane, change to a task-oriented view such as 
Gantt Chart view and simply click the Inspect Task button in the Schedule 
group of the Task tab. The Task Inspector pane appears. Click the task that 
you want to inspect, and the pane explains the various conditions driving the 
selected task’s timing (see Figure 10-9). You can click another task to display 
its drivers and details. If the Task Inspector pane includes schedule change 

208
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
options like the two shown in Figure 10-9, you can click the button for a fix to 
apply it to the task. Click the Close button in the Task Inspector pane when 
you’re done.
 
Figure 10-9: 
The Task 
Inspector 
pane shows 
you the 
influences 
on your 
task’s 
timing.
 
Handling task warnings and suggestions
When you work with autoscheduled tasks, Project can reschedule them for 
you when you establish task dependencies. Because the start and finish dates 
for manually scheduled tasks are “hard wired,” Project loses the very useful 
ability to move them around when predecessor task schedules change. Even 
though it can’t automatically move manually scheduled tasks, Project per-
forms calculations about when each manually scheduled task should occur 
based on its links and other drivers. If Project finds that a potential schedul-
ing problem may occur with a manually scheduled task, it alerts you — even 
when the Task Inspector pane isn’t open.
These alerts come in the form of warnings and suggestions. Warnings appear 
as red wavy underlines, typically under the task finish date in the Finish 
column of the task sheet. Suggestions usually appear as green wavy under-
lines, typically under the task start date in the Start column. While warn-
ings represent real problems that are likely to cause the project to finish off 

209
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
schedule, suggestions give you ideas for optimizing the schedule, perhaps 
improving on your projected finish date.
 
Only schedule warnings appear by default. To view suggestions instead, click 
the drop-down arrow for the Inspect Task button in the Schedule group of the 
Task tab and then choose Show Suggestions.
If you’ve used Microsoft Word, these wavy underlines will look familiar, and 
you work with them just as you do in Word. Right-click the cell with the wavy 
underline to display a shortcut menu with options for addressing the potential 
schedule problem at the top, as shown in Figure 10-10. If you want to apply a 
schedule change option, click it on the shortcut menu. The available schedule 
change options for warnings are different than those for suggestions, and they 
will also vary depending on whether any overallocated resources are assigned 
to the task. Here’s a rundown of the choices you may see:
 
✓ Reschedule to Available Date: If an overallocated resource is assigned 
to the task, this choice reschedules all or part of the task to a time frame 
when the resource has availability to handle the work.
 
✓ Respect Links: This warning fix moves the task based on the timing of 
the predecessor task. In most cases, this fix moves the task later based 
on the predecessor task’s schedule.
 
✓ Switch to Auto Schedule: This warning fix typically appears for manu-
ally scheduled summary tasks. It also appears as a suggestion fix for 
subtasks. Choosing this schedule change causes the summary task to 
recalculate based on the rollup values of its subtasks. For subtasks, the 
switch typically means that the task can move earlier in the schedule, 
potentially improving the schedule for any successor tasks, too.
 
✓ Fix in Task Inspector: Clicking this choice opens the Task Inspector 
pane so that you can review the drivers and other scheduling factors for 
the task before choosing a schedule change.
 
Task schedule warnings and suggestions typically do not appear unless 
you’ve outlined the task list, creating summary tasks. Some of the warning and 
schedule calculations are based on summary task information. That’s why it 
remains a good practice to organize the schedule via outlining.
Undo, undo, undo
When Microsoft held a prerelease conference announcing new features in 
Project 2007, it touted Multiple Undo as the most requested feature and 
announced with glee that it had finally arrived.

Figure 10-10: 
Right-click 
a cell that 
shows a 
warning or 
suggestion 
underline.
 
Why is this feature such a big deal? Individual changes to anything in your 
project plan can have several effects. For that reason, undoing several 
actions in a row was a major technology challenge. If you want to try dif-
ferent scenarios that involve several changes to your project, you used to 
have to do an action and then undo it, then do the next action and undo it, 
and so on. This is time consuming and doesn’t allow you to see cumulative 
affects. Project 2010 continues to offer Multiple Undo so that you can try 
several changes and then undo the whole list of changes or a portion of them 
at once. Because you often want to try several changes when finalizing or 
making adjustments to a project — for example, changing the timing of sev-
eral tasks or the hourly rates of several resources — Multiple Undo is very 
handy.
 
You have to undo all your changes in order. For example, if you made five 
changes and you want to undo the fourth change, you have to undo changes 
one through four. To undo a change, click the down arrow of the Undo button 
on the Quick Access toolbar and then choose the change you want to undo 
(see Figure 10-11). That change and all others you performed subsequent to it 
are undone.

Highlighting changes
Another useful tool that you can use to see how changes you make to 
fine-tune your project schedule have an impact on your project is Change 
Highlighting. You can toggle this feature on and off by adding the Change 
Highlighting button to a custom Ribbon tab and then clicking it as needed 
on that tab. To customize the Ribbon, choose File➪Options. Click Customize 
Ribbon in the list at the right side of the Project Options dialog box. Click 
the New Tab button below the right list, and then use the Rename button to 
rename the New Tab (Custom) and New Group (Custom) items in the list as 
desired. Open the Choose Commands From list above the left list, and click 
All Commands. Then, drag Change Highlighting from the list of All Commands 
onto the custom group on your custom tab in the list at the right. Click the 
OK button to apply the change.
 
You can right-click a custom group in the right list and click Remove to delete 
it and its contents.

With Change Highlighting on — the default setting — each time you take any 
action to change your project’s schedule, a highlight appears on every task 
that the change has had an impact on (see Figure 10-12).

It’s About Time
We’ve all had this experience: Your boss asks you to commit to getting a 
project finished by a certain date. Your palms sweat, you get a sick feeling in 
the pit of your stomach, you add a week onto the finish target the boss sug-
gests to cover yourself, and then you promise to deliver the impossible. You 
hope you can do it. You want to do it. But can you do it?
Project allows you to feel much more confident about committing to a time 
frame because you can see how long all your tasks will take to complete. 
Before you go to your boss and make any promises, make sure that you’re 

213
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
comfortable with two things: the total time it takes to complete the project 
and the critical path (the longest series of tasks that must be completed on 
time for you to hit the overall project finish date).
The timing data for your project summary task tells you how long the entire 
project will take. Just display Gantt Chart view and look at the Duration, 
Start, and Finish columns. If your finish date doesn’t work, you’ll have to go 
back and modify some tasks.
You should also make sure that you have room for error. You can use filters 
and groups to identify the critical path in, for example, Gantt Chart view or 
Network Diagram view. If you judge that too many tasks are on the critical 
path, it’s wise to add some slack to the plan to allow for inevitable delays.
Giving yourself some slack
How many tasks should be on the critical path in your project, and how many 
should have some slack — that is, some time that they could be delayed 
without delaying the entire project? I wish I could give you a formula, but 
sadly, it’s not a science. Ideally, every task in your project should have slack 
because things can come up that you never expected, such as shortages of 
vital materials, asteroid strikes, and management turnover that places you 
in an entirely different department. If you add slack to every task, however, 
your project is probably going to go on into the next millennium. Figure 10-13 
shows a more typical scenario, with a mix of noncritical and critical tasks. 
(Jump ahead to Chapter 11 if you want to see how to format the critical path 
in Gantt Chart view.)
Some tasks have slack naturally because they occur during the life of a longer 
task (or a task followed by some lag time) with which they share similar 
dependencies. The shorter task could actually be delayed until the end of the 
longer task without delaying the project.
Think about this example: You can start installing the plumbing and electrical 
elements of a new office building as soon as the framing inspection is com-
plete. The plumbing takes two weeks, and the electrical work takes one week. 
The next task, mechanical inspection, can’t happen until both the plumb-
ing and electrical tasks are finished. The shorter of the two (electrical) has 
a week of slack because nothing else can happen until the dependent task, 
plumbing, is finished. However, if electrical runs one week late, the electri-
cal task becomes critical. Figure 10-14 shows a similar example, where Prep 
Work tasks can be finished days in advance of when ordered supplies will 
arrive.

215
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
These natural cases of slack occur in any project. In many cases, though, you 
have to build in slack. Slack can be added in a few ways.
First, you can simply inflate task durations. Add two days to the duration 
of all the tasks in your project, or go in and examine each task to figure out 
the risk of delay and pad each duration accordingly. This method is a little 
problematic, however, because when changes occur, you may have to go 
into many tasks and adjust durations to deal with a schedule that’s ahead or 
behind. You also have to keep track of exactly how much slack you built in to 
each task.
The second method is to add lag time after a task. Then if the task runs long, 
it’s less likely to bump the schedule of its successor tasks. The section called 
“Adding the missing (dependency) link” in Chapter 6 includes a step that 
shows you where to add lead or lag time for a task.
The final method of building in slack is the one I like best. You build one slack 
task or several slack tasks that occur throughout your project — say, one at 
the end of each phase of the project.
 
Now, there’s one must-do here, even if it seems obvious: Don’t call this task 
Slack. Nobody in a position of responsibility would be caught dead approving 
slack time for anybody. Give slack tasks appropriately respectable names that 
reflect useful (but admittedly, somewhat generic) activities — say, Engineering 
Analysis, Debriefing, or CYA Meeting. Then give the task a duration that pro-
vides breathing space for the other tasks in that phase. For example, at the 
end of a two-month phase of designing a new product package, you may add a 
task called Design Debriefing and make it one week long. (That way, if a sudden 
mandate for design tweaks comes out of nowhere, you’re covered.) Then 
create a dependency between that task and the last “real” task in the phase.
I’m not talking dishonesty here — just reality. In the real world, slack is indis-
pensable, because the typical project takes longer and costs more than origi-
nally projected.
As things slide in your project (and they will, trust me), you’ll spot that slack 
is being eaten up because the slack task is suddenly ending later than the 
date you’d wanted the phase to end. You can change the duration of the 
slack task, reflecting the fact that your slack is being used up. The duration 
of that task will give you a good indication of how much more time you have 
before the entire phase will go critical.
Doing it in less time
If you do your homework and add slack to tasks, you’re making your plan 
realistic, but the price you pay is that you’re adding time (and hourly work 
costs) to your project. What happens when your project finish date just 

216
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
won’t cut it with the powers-that-be? That’s when you have to try a few tac-
tics to chop your timing down to size.
Check your dependencies
The timing of your plan is determined, to a great extent, by the timing rela-
tionships you build among tasks, that is, by dependencies. So ask yourself, 
Did I build all my dependencies in the best way I could? Perhaps you didn’t 
start one task until another was finished, but you could actually start the 
second task two days before the end of its predecessor. Building in that kind 
of overlap can save you time.
 
Use the Task Inspector pane, covered in the earlier section of this chapter 
“Inspecting tasks,” to help you scope out dependencies.
Here’s an example: You created a finish-to-start relationship for the Do 
Research and Write Speech tasks, such that you could not start writing the 
speech until your research was finished. But is that true? Couldn’t you do 
a first draft of the speech starting three-fourths of the way through the 
research? Especially when you have two different resources working on 
those tasks, getting the second task going before the first is complete can 
save you time.
Over the life of a project with hundreds of tasks, adding that kind of overlap 
to even a few dozen tasks could save you a month of time or more!
 
You can take a refresher course in creating and changing dependencies in 
Chapter 6.
We could use some help here!
Another factor that drives timing is the availability of resources. Sometimes 
you set a dependency relationship where one task can’t start before another 
is over simply because the resources aren’t available until the predecessor 
task is over. Here are a few things to look for with resource-dependent timing:
 
✓ Maybe you delayed the start of a task because a resource wasn’t avail-
able. But could some other resource do the work? If so, switch resources 
and let the task start sooner.
 
✓ Project calculates the duration of some autoscheduled tasks (Fixed 
Work and Fixed Units with effort-driven scheduling) according to the 
number of resources available to do the work. If you add resources to 
those tasks, Project shortens their duration.
 
✓ If you assign a more skilled resource to some tasks, you may be able 
to reduce the hours of work required to complete the task because the 
skilled person will finish the work more quickly.

217
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
 
✓ Assigning more resources to tasks on the critical path can make those 
tasks shorter, which would tend to make the overall project schedule 
shorter.
 
✓ Could you hire an outside vendor to handle the work? If you have money 
but no time or resources, that’s sometimes a viable option.
 
Chapter 9 covers the mechanics of making and changing resource assignments.
Cut to the chase: Deleting some tasks and slashing slack
When all else fails, it’s time to cut some very specific corners. Can you skip 
some tasks, such as that final quality check, the one that occurs after the 
other three you already built in? Or should you pull back on some of the 
slack you’ve allowed yourself? Can you revisit the project’s goals with stake-
holders and perhaps reduce the project’s scope so that you can jettison 
tasks from the schedule?
 
Never, I repeat, never get rid of all the slack in your schedule. Otherwise, it will 
come back and haunt you like the Ghost of Christmas Past. Just tell your boss 
I said so.
Could you get some other project manager to handle some of your tasks for 
you with different sets of resources? If your buddy has a project that involves 
writing specs for a new product, could you convince him to also write the 
user’s manual, which was your responsibility in designing product packag-
ing? It’s worth a shot.
Getting It for Less
After you assign all your resources to tasks and set all your fixed costs, it’s 
time for sticker shock. Project will tally all those costs and show you the proj-
ect’s budget. But what if those numbers just won’t work? Here are some tips 
for trimming that bottom line:
 
✓ Use cheaper resources. Do you have a high-priced engineer on a task 
that could be performed by a junior engineer? Did you assign a high-
priced manager to supervise a task that could be handled by a lower-
priced line supervisor?
 
✓ Lower fixed costs. If you allowed for the travel costs associated with 
four plant visits, could you manage with only three? Could you book 
flights ahead of time and get cheaper airfares? Could you find a cheaper 
vendor for that piece of equipment you allocated $4,000 to buy? Or 
could you make do with the old equipment for just one more project?

218
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
 
✓ Cut down on the overtime. Are resources that earn overtime overal-
located? Try cutting down their hours or using resources on straight 
salary for those 14-hour days.
 
✓ Do it in less time. Resource costs are a factor of task durations, hourly 
wages, or number of units. If you change tasks so that fewer work hours 
are required to complete them, they’ll cost less. However, don’t be unre-
alistic about the time it will really take to get the work done.
 
The Budget report calculates the total projected costs for the project based 
on all the resource, assignment, and cost information you enter. Chapter 16 
reports on Project reports.
Your Resource Recourse
Before you finalize your plan, you should consider one final area: resource 
workload. As you went about assigning resources to tasks in your project, 
you probably created some situations where resources are working around 
the clock for days on end. It may look okay on paper, but in reality, it’s just 
not going to work.
Your first step is to see how to spot those overallocations. Then you have to 
give those poor folks some help!
Checking resource availability
To resolve issues with resource assignments, you have to first figure out 
where the problems lie. You can do that by taking a look at a few views that 
focus on resource assignments.
You can use some collaboration features of Project Web App to get resource 
availability information online. See Chapters 18 and 19 for more about work-
ing with Project Web App.
Resource Usage view (shown in Figure 10-15) and Resource Graph view 
(shown in Figure 10-16) are useful in helping you spot overbooked resources. 
In Resource Usage view, the overbooked resource appears in red and an 
exclamation mark indicator appears. In Resource Graph view, the graph bars 
appear in red for any allocation over 100% units (or the units allowed for the 
resource).

220
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
First, keep in mind that resources are flagged as overallocated in these 
Resource views based on their assignment percentage and calendars. A 
resource based on a standard eight-hour-day calendar, assigned at 100 
percent to a task, will work eight hours a day on it. If you assign that same 
resource at 50 percent to another task that happens at the same time, the 
resource will put in 12-hour days (8 plus 4) and be marked as overallocated.
In Resource Graph view, work is summarized in the Peak Units row at the 
bottom, and all work in the part of the bar graphic that’s above the 100-
percent mark is highlighted. In Resource Usage view, any overallocated 
resource has a yellow diamond with an exclamation point in the Indicator 
column. The total hours that the resource is working each day on his or her 
combined tasks are summarized on the line that lists the resource’s name.
Deleting or modifying a 
resource assignment
So, you discover that poor Henrietta is working 42 hours on Tuesday and 83 
hours on Friday. What to do?
You have a few options:
 
✓ Remove Henrietta from a few tasks to free up some time.
 
✓ Change Henrietta’s Resource calendar to allow for a longer workday, 
for example, 12 hours. Keep in mind that this means a 100-percent 
assignment will have Henrietta working 12 hours on any one task in a 
day. If you stretch a resource’s workday, you should probably reduce 
the resource’s assignments. For example, if someone frequently puts in 
16 hours on two tasks in one day (based on an 8-hour calendar) and two 
100-percent assignments, try changing to a 12-hour calendar and 50-
percent assignments (6 hours on each of the two tasks, totaling 12 hours 
a day). However, if the person typically works an 8-hour day and 12- or 
16-hour days are the exception, you shouldn’t change the resource’s 
base calendar because that will have an effect on all assignments for 
that resource. And if an overtime pay rate applies, don’t forget to autho-
rize (add) that overtime; see Chapter 13 for more about that!
 
 The two previous options may lengthen the tasks that the resource is 
assigned to, regardless of whether you remove the resource or reduce 
the resource’s assignment.
 
✓ Change Henrietta’s availability by upping her assignment units to 
more than 100 percent in the Resource Information dialog box. For 
example, if you enter 150% as her available units, you’re saying that it’s 
okay for her to work 12 hours a day, and Project will then consider her 
fair game and not overallocated until she exceeds that 12 hours.

221
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
 
✓ Use Team Planner view to shuffle some of Henrietta’s tasks to other 
resources. When you’re making the switch, Team Planner view gives you 
the best visibility about how changes impact the various resources.
 
✓ Ignore the problem. I don’t mean this facetiously: Sometimes someone 
working 14 hours for a day or two during the life of a project is accept-
able, and you don’t need to change the resource’s usual working allo-
cation to make that overwork indicator go away. (However, consider 
telling Henrietta it’s okay to order pizza on the company on those long 
workdays — and make sure that you don’t let them become the norm.) 
And if a resource is scheduled for even a few minutes more than her 
calendar allows, it will be flagged as overallocated. It is not worth your 
effort as project manager to attempt to resolve tiny overallocations that 
will not impact the project schedule in a meaningful way.
Quick and dirty rescheduling 
to beat overallocations
Gantt Chart view also clues you in about overbooked resources. When a task 
has an overallocated resource assigned, an overallocation icon that looks like 
a little person appears in the Indicator column. To fix the overallocation, you 
can right-click the icon and choose Reschedule to Available Date, as shown in 
Figure 10-17. This method reschedules all or part of the task to a period when 
the resource has availability to fix the overallocation, if possible. You can 
always undo the change if you disagree with its impact on the overall project 
schedule. This method can’t fix all overallocations, so if the icon remains 
after you choose Reschedule to Available Date, you’ll need to look at other 
methods to resolve the problem. Right-clicking the icon again and choosing 
Fix in Task Inspector enables the Task Inspector to give you ideas for fixing 
the overallocation.
Getting some help
When one person is overworked, it’s time to look for help. You can free 
resources in several ways.
For starters, you can assign someone to help on a task and thus reduce the 
overbooked resource assignment now that he or she is not needed for as 
many hours. Reduce the resource’s work assignment on one or more tasks — 
say, reducing 100-percent assignments to 50 percent. You do this in the Task 
Information dialog box on the Resources tab, as shown in Figure 10-18, or by 
selecting the task and clicking the Assign Resources tool to open the Assign 
Resources dialog box.

You can quickly check a work graph for any resource by clicking the Graphs 
button in the Assign Resources dialog box.

223
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
You’ll also find that by adding resources to some tasks, you’ll shorten the 
task duration. That means you may free your resource in time to eliminate a 
conflict with a later task in the project.
Try changing the work contour for the resource. By default, Project has a 
resource work on a task at the same level for the life of the task. You can 
modify the work contour, for example, so that a resource puts in the most 
effort at the start of a task, which frees the resource’s workload later when a 
conflict with another assignment might occur. See Chapter 9 for information 
about how to apply a work contour to a resource assignment.
Getting your resources level
Resource leveling sounds something like the St. Valentine’s Day massacre, but 
it’s not. It’s a calculation that Project goes through to try to resolve resource 
overallocation in your project. The feature works in two ways: by delaying 
a task until the overbooked resource frees up or by splitting tasks. Splitting 
a task involves (essentially) stopping it at some point, thereby freeing the 
resource, and then resuming it at a later time when the resource is available.
You can make such changes yourself or let Project do the calculation. Project 
will first delay tasks that involve overallocated resources to use up any avail-
able slack. When no more slack is available on these tasks, Project makes 
changes based on any priorities you’ve entered for tasks, dependency rela-
tionships that are affected, and task constraints (such as a Finish No Later 
Than constraint).
But don’t worry: You can turn on leveling to see what changes Project would 
make and then clear the leveling to reverse those actions if you don’t like the 
results.
To level the resources in your project, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Resource➪Leveling Options.
 
 The Resource Leveling dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-19.
 
2. Make a choice between allowing Project to do automatic or manual 
leveling:
 
• Automatic tells Project to level every time you change your plan.
 
• Manual requires that you go to the Resource Leveling dialog box 
and click the Level All button or use the Level All button on the 
Resource tab.
 
3. If you choose to level automatically, be sure to select the Clear 
Leveling Values before Leveling check box, if you want previous level-
ing actions to be reversed before you level the next time.

4. Set the leveling range to one of the following:
 
• Level Entire Project.
 
• Level <a date range>. Then fill in a date range by making choices in 
the From and To boxes.
 
5. From the Leveling Order drop-down list, click the down arrow and 
make a choice:
 
• Standard considers slack, dependencies, priorities, and 
constraints.
 
• ID Only delays or splits the task with the highest ID number, in 
other words, the last task in the project.
 
• Priority, Standard uses task priority as the first criterion in making 
choices to delay or split tasks (rather than using up slack).

225
 Chapter 10: Fine-Tuning Your Plan
 
6. Select any of the five check boxes at the bottom to control how Project 
will level:
 
• Level only within available slack: No critical tasks are delayed, and 
your current finish date for the project is retained.
 
• Leveling can adjust individual assignments on a task: This allows 
Project to remove or change assignments.
 
• Leveling can create splits in the remaining work: This can put some 
tasks on hold for a period of time until resources are freed up for 
work.
 
• Level resources with the proposed booking type: Booking type (pro-
posed or committed) relates to how firm you are in using that 
particular resource. Allowing resource leveling to consider a 
resource’s booking type means that committed resource assign-
ments are considered more sacred when Project goes about 
making changes than proposed assignments.
 
• Level manually scheduled tasks: This allows Project to move the 
task even if you’ve scheduled it manually.
 
7. Click the Level All button to have Project perform the leveling 
operation.
 
To reverse leveling, choose Resource➪Clear Leveling.
To level or not to level?
As both a process and a program feature, 
resource leveling has pros and cons. It can 
make changes that you may not want it to 
make — for example, taking a resource off a 
task where you absolutely need that person’s 
unique skills. It frequently delays your project’s 
finish date, which may not be acceptable to you 
(or your boss).
The safest setting for Resource Leveling — that 
is, the one that makes the least drastic changes 
to your timing — is to level only within slack. 
This setting may delay some tasks, but it won’t 
delay your project completion date.
If you just can’t live with everything Resource 
Leveling did, the capability to turn Resource 
Leveling on and off is your best ally. You can 
turn the feature on and look at the things it did 
to resolve resource problems, and then turn it 
off and manually institute the portions of the 
solution that work for you. Also remember that 
the Multiple Undo feature allows you to make 
several changes manually and undo them to get 
back to where you started.

226
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
Rescheduling the Project
From time to time, you really have to hit the brakes on a project. This happens 
when you set up an entire project plan, and just as you’re ready to get rolling, 
the project is put on hold. It may be due to lack of budget, changing priorities, 
having resources pulled to another project, or cold feet on the part of stake-
holders. It happens, but it also happens that projects have a way of coming 
back to life. The good news for you is that if the essential facts of the project, 
such as its scope and the resources you can use, haven’t changed, you can just 
reschedule the entire project to start from a later date rather than rebuilding 
the plan from scratch. This process reschedules both autoscheduled and man-
ually scheduled tasks, so you don’t even have to use your thinking cap.
 To reschedule your project, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Project➪Move Project.
 
 The Move Project dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-20.
 
Figure 10-20: 
You can 
reschedule 
an entire 
project that 
was put on

2. Enter the new project start date in the New Project Start Date box, or 
choose a date from the drop-down calendar.
 
3. Deselect the Move Deadlines check box if you want Project to skip 
moving any deadlines that are assigned to tasks.
 
4. Click the OK button.
Mixing Solutions Up
One final word about all the solutions suggested in this chapter to deal with 
time, cost, and overallocation problems: To be most successful, you’ll prob-
ably have to use a combination of all these methods. Solving these problems is 
often a trial-and-error process. Although you may initially look for one quick fix 
(who doesn’t?), in reality, the best solution may come through making a dozen 
small changes. Take the time to find the best combination for your project.

A
n old chestnut would have you believe that clothes make the man. Well, 
in the same spirit, sometimes the look of your schedule makes the proj-
ect. Having a project that looks good serves two purposes. One, it impresses 
people with your professionalism (sometimes to the point where they’ll over-
look a little cost overrun); second, it allows people looking at your project 
both on-screen and on hard copy to easily discern what the different boxes, 
bars, and lines indicate.
Project uses default formatting that’s pretty good in most cases. However, if 
you have certain company standards for reporting — say, representing base-
line data in yellow and actual data in blue, or more frequent gridlines to help 
your nearsighted CEO read Project reports more easily — Project has you 
covered.
Whatever you need, Project provides tremendous flexibility in formatting 
various elements in your plan.

228
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
Putting Your Best Foot Forward
Microsoft has decided to capitulate to the artist in all of us by allowing you to 
modify shapes, colors, patterns, and other graphic elements in your Project 
plans. This gives you great flexibility in determining how your plan looks.
 
When you print Project views (covered in Chapter 16), you can print a legend 
on every page. The legend helps those reading the plan understand the mean-
ing of the various colors and shapes that you set for elements.
One important thing to realize is that all the views and formatting choices 
that Project offers you aren’t confined to the screen. You can print your proj-
ect or reports. What displays on-screen when you print a view is what will 
print. So, knowing how to make all kinds of changes to what’s on your screen 
allows you to present information to team members, managers, vendors, and 
clients in hard copy too.
 
With all the improved methods of collaborating on projects, such as sharing 
documents via Project Web App, a visually appealing schedule can be seen by 
even more people across the Web.
Printing in color is useful because you can provide the full visual impact and 
nuance of the various colors used for graphic elements (such as task bars 
and indicators). If you print in black and white, you may find that certain 
colors that look good on-screen aren’t as distinct when you print. Being able 
to modify formatting allows your project to look good in both color and black 
and white, both on-screen and in print.
Getting to the Critical Stuff
The home-base view, Gantt Chart, doesn’t show the critical path by default. 
All the subtask task bars appear blue, no matter what the specifics are sur-
rounding the task. To give the critical path visibility, you can have the bars 
for critical paths appear in a nice, dark red. For example, in Figure 11-1, the 
tasks in the Planning summary group and most of the tasks in the Lay Pavers 
group are critical tasks, and they appear in red with the critical path 
highlighted.
Displaying the critical path is a snap. Simply click the Gantt Chart Tools 
Format contextual tab on the Ribbon, and then select the Critical Tasks check 
box in the Bar Styles group. Whenever Critical Tasks is checked, Project 
applies the special color to the critical task bars.

229

Formatting Task Bars
Task bars are the horizontal boxes that represent the timing of a task in the 
chart pane of Gantt Chart view. You can format each bar individually, change 
formatting settings for different types of task bars, or apply a new style that 
controls bar formatting for the entire chart.
You can change several things about task bars:
 
✓ The shape that appears at the start and end of the bar. You can change 
the shape’s type and color. Each end can be formatted differently.
 
✓ The shape, pattern, and color of the middle of the bar.
 
✓ The text that you can set to appear in five locations around the bar: 
left, right, above, below, or inside the bar. You can include text in any 
or all of these locations, but keep in mind that too many text items can 
quickly become impossible to read. As a rule, use just enough text to 
help readers of your plan identify information, especially on printouts 
of large schedules where a task may appear far to the right of the Task 
Name column that identifies it by name in the sheet area.

230
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
When you track progress on a task, a progress bar is superimposed on the 
task bar. You can format the shape, pattern, and color of the progress bar. 
The goal is to contrast the progress bar with the baseline task bar so that 
you can see both clearly.
 
By formatting task bars, you can help readers of your plan identify various ele-
ments, such as progress or milestones. If you make changes to individual task 
bars, people who are accustomed to Project’s standard formatting may have 
trouble reading your plan.
To create formatting settings for various types of task bars, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the chart area outside any single task bar and then choose 
Bar Styles.
 
 The Bar Styles dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-2.
 
Figure 11-2: 
You can 
modify the 
look of task 
bars and the 
text you dis-
play along 
with them.
 
 
2. In the spreadsheet, along the top in the Name column, click the type 
of task that you want to modify (Split, Progress, Milestone, and so on).
 
 For example, if you want to modify the styles used for all summary tasks, 
click Summary. The choices in the Bars tab in the bottom half of the 
dialog box change based on the task type that you click.
 
3. Click in the Show for . . . Tasks column for the task type you want to 
modify, and then select criteria for the task from the drop-down list 
that appears, such as Critical or Finished.

231
 Chapter 11: Making Your Project Look Good
 
4. Click the Bars tab to display it, if necessary, and then do the following:
 
a. Click any of the Shape lists to modify the shape of either end or the 
middle of the task bar.
 
 Shapes on either end may be an arrow, a diamond, or a circle. The 
shape in the middle consists of a bar of a certain width.
 
b. Click any of the Color lists to modify the color used on either end or 
in the middle of the task bar.
 
 Project now enables you to choose from various Theme Colors as 
in the other Office applications.
 
c. Click either of the Type lists to modify the type of formatting for the 
shape on either end of the task bar.
 
 This setting controls how such a shape is outlined: framed with 
a solid line, surrounded by a dashed line, or filled in with a solid 
color.
 
d. Click the Pattern list to select another pattern for the middle of 
the bar.
 
5. Click the Text tab (as shown in Figure 11-3), and then do the following:
 
a. Click any of the text locations.
 
 An arrow appears at the end of that line.
 
b. Click the arrow to display an alphabetical list of possible data that 
you can include, and then click a field name to select it.
 
c. Repeat Steps 6a and 6b to choose additional text locations.
 
6. Click the OK button to accept all new task bar settings.

in up to five 
locations in

232
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
If you want to make the same types of changes to an individual task bar 
rather than to all task bars of a certain type, right-click the task bar and then 
choose Format Bar. The Format Bar dialog box appears, offering the same 
Text and Bars tabs found in the Bar Styles dialog box, without the options at 
the top to select the type of item to format.
 
On the Gantt Chart Tools Format contextual tab, you can click the Format 
button in the Bar Styles group to find commands for formatting individual bars 
and bar styles.
Restyling Your Gantt Chart
Are the boring old red and blue Gantt bars cramping your style? Not to 
worry; you can try a new look, including a different color scheme and differ-
ing bar styles, by applying a new Gantt Chart style. Working in Gantt Chart 
view, just click the Gantt Chart Tools Format contextual tab. Then click the 
More drop-down button in the Gantt Chart Style group to display the avail-
able styles (see Figure 11-4). Click the style that you want, and Project refor-
mats the whole project. It doesn’t get much simpler!

233
 Chapter 11: Making Your Project Look Good
 
Folks often want to format the sheet portion of Gantt Chart view, too. After 
you select the cells to format, you can use some choices on the Gantt Chart 
Tools Format contextual tab to apply changes. For example, you can click Text 
Styles in the Format group to open a dialog box for changing text font, size, 
and more. Or, you can use the Wrap Text button in the Columns group to con-
trol whether or not text automatically wraps in a particular cell or column.
Formatting Task Boxes
Network Diagram task boxes use different shapes to help you spot different 
types of tasks:
 
✓ Summary tasks use a slightly slanted box shape and include a plus or 
minus symbol, depending on whether the summary task’s subtasks are 
hidden or displayed. Click the symbol to hide or display subtasks.
 
✓ Subtasks show up in simple rectangular boxes.
 
✓ Milestones are shown in diamond-shaped boxes with blue shading.
 
✓ Manually scheduled tasks have a diagonal pattern to distinguish them 
from autoscheduled tasks.
You can change the formatting of each task box individually or by type. To 
change the formatting of task boxes displayed in Network Diagram view, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Display Network Diagram view.
 
2. Right-click the task box that you want to change and then choose 
Format Box. Alternatively, right-click anywhere outside the task boxes 
and then choose Box Styles to change the formatting for all boxes of a 
certain style.
 
  The Format Box or Box Styles dialog box appears (as shown in Figure 11-5).
 
3. To modify the border style, make your selection in the Shape, Color, 
and Width lists.
 
4. To modify the background area inside the box, make a selection in 
the Color list, Pattern list, or both (at the bottom of the dialog box).
 
5. Click the OK button to save your new settings.
 
When you modify the formatting of individual boxes in Network Diagram view, 
the standard settings of slanted summary tasks and shaded milestones no 
longer serve as a visual guide to all tasks. If you make changes and decide that 
you’d like to put a task box back to its default setting, click the Reset button in 
the Format Box dialog box.

Adjusting the Layout
In addition to displaying particular columns and formatting task bars, you 
can make certain changes to the layout of your view. These options vary 
a great deal, depending on what view you’re working with. The layout of 
Calendar and Network Diagram views is quite different than the layout 
choices offered in Gantt Chart view, for example.
To display the Layout dialog box for a view, right-click the area (for example, 
the chart area of the Gantt Chart view) or anywhere in Calendar view or 
Network Diagram view, and then choose Layout from the menu that appears. 
The appropriate dialog box appears. Figures 11-6, 11-7, and 11-8 show the 
various layout choices available in the different views.

In general, the settings in these Layout dialog boxes deal with how the 
elements on the page are arranged and how dependency link lines are 
displayed.
Table 11-1 shows you the layout settings. You could probably spend a week 
toying with all of these settings to see what they look like, and I could spend 
a few days writing about the various options. The tools that Project offers to 
modify the formatting of elements such as task bars and task boxes provide 
wonderful flexibility.

 Chapter 11: Making Your Project Look Good
Now that you’ve seen the many options available for modifying view layouts, 
I have some advice: Stick with the default settings unless you have a specific 
reason to make a change (such as when you want to highlight certain types 
of information for a project presentation). When you don’t need that layout 
change anymore, go right back to the default settings. Or, if you want to make 
changes, make them globally across your organization and stick to them. 
That makes it much easier for those reading your project plan to interpret 
the different kinds of information presented in views. Generally speaking, if 
you tinker too often with the way that Project displays information, it just 
makes your own learning curve steeper — and confuses those who know 
Project’s default settings.
Modifying Gridlines
Just as phone numbers are broken up into several shorter sets of numbers 
to help you remember them, visual elements are often broken up to help you 
understand information in chunks. Tables use lines, calendars use boxes, 
football fields use yard lines, and so on.
Several views in Project include gridlines to indicate certain things, such 
as the break between weeks or the status date (that is, the date as of which 
progress has been tracked on a project). These lines help the reader of your 
plan discern intervals of time or breaks in information; for example, gridlines 
can be used to indicate major and minor column breaks. You can modify 
these gridlines in several ways, including changing the color and style of the 
lines and the interval at which they appear.
To modify gridlines, use the Gridlines dialog box, as follows:
 
1. Right-click any area of a view that contains a grid (for example, the 
chart area of Gantt Chart view or Calendar view) and then choose 
Gridlines.
 
 The Gridlines dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-9. Note that 
you also can display the Gantt Chart Tools Format contextual tab, click 
Gridlines in the Format group, and then click Gridlines to open the 
dialog box.
 
2. In the Line to Change list, click the gridline that you want to modify.
 
3. Use the Normal Type and Color lists to select a line style and color.

238
Part III: Well, It Looks Good on Paper… 
 
Figure 11-9: 
The possible 
lines you 
can change 
vary some-
what from 
one view to 
another.
 
 
4. If you want to use a contrasting color at various intervals in the grid to 
make it easier to read, do the following:
 
a. Select an interval at which to include a contrasting line.
 
 This setting is typically used with a different style or color from 
the Normal line setting to mark minor intervals for a grid. Note that 
not all types of gridlines can use contrasting intervals.
 
b. Choose the type and color of that line from the lists.
 
5. Click the OK button to save your settings.
 
You make choices for modifying gridlines one by one, and you have no Reset 
button to put these settings back the way they were. Also note that gridlines 
modified in one view don’t affect gridlines in any other view.
When a Picture Can Say It All
Words and numbers and task bars and task boxes are fine, but what if you 
want to add something of your own? For example, you may want to draw 
attention to a task by drawing a circle around it, or you may want to include a 
simple drawing to show a process or working relationship in your plan.
You can use a drawing tool on the Gantt Chart Tools Format contextual tab of 
the Ribbon to draw images in the chart area of Gantt Chart view. Follow these 
steps to add a drawing:
 
1. Display Gantt Chart view.
 
2. Choose Gantt Chart Tools Format➪Drawing.
 
 The menu of available shapes and commands appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-10.
 
3. Click the drawing tool that represents the type of object you want to 
draw, such as an oval or a rectangle.

239
 Chapter 11: Making Your Project Look Good
 
Figure 11-10: 
These 
drawing 
tools enable 
you to 
add basic 
shapes.
 
 
4. At the location on the chart where you want to draw the object, drag 
your mouse until the item is drawn approximately to the scale you want.
 
5. Release the mouse button.
 
When you draw an object over an element such as a task bar, the drawn 
object is solid white and covers up what’s beneath it. You have a couple of 
choices if you want the item underneath to show through:
 
✓ Right-click the object, choose Properties, and click None under Fill in the 
Format Drawing dialog box to remove the fill.
 
✓ Right-click the object, choose Arrange, and choose Send to Back to 
move the object behind the chart elements.
At this point, you have a few options:
 
✓ Add text: If you drew a text box, you can click in it and then type what-
ever text you like.
 
✓ Resize objects: Resize any object you’ve drawn by selecting it and then 
dragging any of the resize handles (little black boxes) around its edges 
outward to enlarge it or inward to shrink it.
 
✓ Move objects: Move the mouse over the object until the mouse pointer 
becomes a four-way arrow. Then drag the object elsewhere on the chart.

ect manager’s frustration, this part shows you how to 
save a baseline picture of your project and how to use it 
as you track the ongoing struggle between actual activity 
and your ideal plan. You get a look at tracking and report-
ing progress, see how to update the plan, pick up tips on 
how to get back on track if the project goes off the rails, 
and try out handy tools for using past data to make better 
future project plans.

W
hen you go on a diet (and I know you all have at one time or 
another!), you step on the scale the first day to check your weight. 
Then, as your diet progresses, you have a benchmark against which you can 
compare your dieting ups and downs.
Project doesn’t have a weight problem, but it does have a method of bench-
marking your project data so that you can compare the actual activity that 
takes place on your tasks against your original plan. This saved version of 
your plan data is called a baseline, and it includes all the information in your 
project, such as task timing, resource assignments, and costs.
Project also provides something called an interim plan, which is essentially a 
timing checklist. It includes only the actual start and finish dates of tasks as 
well as the estimated start and finish dates for tasks not yet started.
This chapter shows you when, why, and how to save a baseline and interim 
plan for your project.
All about Baselines
Saving a baseline is like freezing a mosquito in amber: It’s a permanent 
record of your estimates of time, money, and resource workload for your 
project at the moment when you consider your plan final and before you 

244
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
begin any activity. A baseline is saved in your original Project file and exists 
right alongside any actual activity that you record on your tasks.
You can use baselines to debrief yourself or your team at any point in a 
project. This is especially useful at the end of a project, when you can com-
pare what really happened against your best guesses of those many weeks, 
months, or even years ago. You can then become a much better user of 
Project, making more accurate estimates up front. You can also use a base-
line and the actual activity that you track against it to explain delays or cost 
overruns to employers or clients by using a wide variety of reports and 
printed views.
Finally, you can also save and clear baselines for only selected tasks. So, if 
one task is thrown way off track by a major change, you can modify your 
estimates for it and leave the rest of your baseline alone. Why throw out the 
baby with the bathwater?
What does a baseline look like?
Behind the scenes, some of the key data the baseline captures are baseline 
start, finish, duration, work, and cost information for each task. After you 
save a baseline and track some actual activity against it, you get baseline and 
actual sets of data as well as visual indications of actual data.
Figure 12-1 shows Gantt Chart view for a project that displays a check mark 
in the indicators column for every task marked as complete. The task bar for 
the task with completed work displays a black progress bar along the middle 
to illustrate the completion percentage. In the sheet area, you can display 
the Variance table, with columns of data to compare baseline estimates and 
actual activity, for example, baseline finish and actual finish.
Figure 12-2 shows Tracking Gantt view. This view is a little more complex. It 
presents data for each task as a pair of task bars, as follows:
 
✓ Thin gray bar: This shows the baseline schedule for the task.
 
✓ Upper solid bar: This shows the actual schedule for completed tasks.
 
✓ Upper shaded bar: This indicates the current schedule for any task that 
is partially complete or hasn’t started.
 
✓ Completion percentage: The marked or calculated completion percent-
age appears beside each task, as well as summary task bars.

You can change how different graphic elements are represented by reformat-
ting. See Chapter 11 for more about formatting task bars and task boxes.
How do I save a baseline?
You can save a baseline at any time by displaying the Set Baseline dialog box. 
One setting here — how Project rolls up data to summary tasks when you set 
a baseline for part of the tasks — requires a little explanation.
By default, after you save a baseline the first time, a summary task’s baseline 
data is updated if you make changes to a subtask below it, such as chang-
ing the schedule for or deleting a subtask. However, when you are saving 
the baseline for only a selection of tasks, you can change that functionality 
by making a choice about how the baseline rolls up data. You can choose to 
have modifications rolled up to all summary tasks or only from subtasks for 
any summary tasks that you select. This second option works only if you’ve 
selected summary tasks but not selected their subtasks.
You can save a baseline by following these steps:
 
1. To save a baseline for only certain tasks, select them by dragging over 
their task ID (row) numbers.
 
2. Choose Project➪Set Baseline➪Set Baseline.
 
 The Set Baseline dialog box appears with the Set Baseline option 
selected, as shown in Figure 12-3.
 
3. Select the Entire Project or the Selected Tasks radio button.
 
Figure 12-3: 
This dia-
log box is 
used for 
baselines 
and interim 
plans.
 

247
 Chapter 12: It All Begins with a Baseline
 
4. If you chose Selected Tasks in Step 3, make selections for how the 
baseline rolls up, or summarizes, changes to task data.
 
 You can have changed data summarized in all summary tasks or only for 
the summary tasks that you select.
 
5. Click the OK button to set the baseline.
What if I want more than one baseline?
I know you love to hear about features in Project 2010 that you may never 
take full advantage of. (Who doesn’t?) Here’s one: You can save your base-
line up to 11 times during the life of your project. That’s 11 potentially cata-
strophic events you can adjust for by resaving your baseline!
Although you may never use all 11 possible baselines, the ability to save mul-
tiple baselines can help you see the progress of your planning over the life 
of a longer project. They are also a sneaky but effective way of showing your 
boss that, yes, you really did anticipate that budget overrun, even though 
you didn’t include it in your original saved plan. (I’m not advocating this, but 
it works as long as your boss didn’t keep a copy of the original plan.) Just 
keep in mind that the more baselines you save, the larger your Project file 
becomes, and that can slow down performance.
The Set Baseline dialog box includes a list of these baselines, with the last 
date each was saved, as shown in Figure 12-4. When you save a baseline, you 
can save without overwriting an existing baseline by simply selecting another 
one of the baselines in this list before saving.
 
Figure 12-4: 
Each 
baseline 
to which 
you’ve

something

date in this

248
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
If you save multiple baselines or interim plans, you can view them by display-
ing columns in any sheet view for those plans. For example, if you want to 
display information for a baseline you saved with the name Baseline 7, you 
would insert the column named Baseline 7 in your Gantt Chart view sheet.
You can view multiple baselines at one time by displaying Multiple Baselines 
Gantt view.
 
When calculating variances (whether the schedule is early or late or costs are 
over or under), Project only uses the first baseline (the one named Baseline, 
not Baseline1) saved. So, if the project schedule and other parameters change 
dramatically, as when a project is put on hold and later revived, you will get 
more valid variance data by clearing and resetting the baseline, as I describe 
next.
How do I clear and reset a baseline?
Okay, if you read the first part of this chapter, you know that I said that a 
baseline is intended to be a frozen picture of your project plan that you keep 
sacrosanct and never change. Well, that’s the theory. In practice, things can 
happen that make an original baseline so obsolete that it’s less than useful. 
It’s not even worth keeping as one of your 11 possible baselines.
For example, if you have a project that takes four years from beginning to 
end, you may want to save a new baseline every year because costs go up or 
resources change. Then you can see incremental versions of your estimates 
that reflect the changes you made based on changes in the real world.
In contrast, consider that you start your project with a wonderful, well-
thought-out baseline plan, but a week later, the entire industry shuts down 
with a massive strike that goes on for three months. All your original esti-
mates of timing would be bogus, so it’s better to make adjustments to your 
plan, save a new baseline, and move ahead after the strike is resolved.
To clear an existing baseline, follow these steps:
 
1. To clear the baseline for only certain tasks, select them.
 
2. Choose Project➪Set Baseline➪Clear Baseline.
 
 The Clear Baseline dialog box appears with the Clear Baseline Plan 
option selected by default, as shown in Figure 12-5.
 
3. From the Clear Baseline Plan drop-down list, choose the baseline that 
you want to clear.

the entire project or the Selected Tasks radio button for selected tasks.
 
5. Click the OK button.
 
 The project baseline or selected tasks are cleared.
In the Interim
An interim plan is sort of like Baseline Lite. With an interim plan, you save 
only the actual start and finish dates of tasks that have had activity tracked 
on them as well as the baseline start and finish dates for all unstarted tasks.
Why save an interim plan rather than a baseline? An interim plan saves 
only timing information. If that’s all you need, why save all the data about 
resource assignments and costs and so on? (Keep in mind that you’ll end up 
with a huge file if you save a large number of baselines.)
Another issue with a baseline is that because there’s so much data, the base-
line can become obsolete at some point. An interim plan can be saved to 
record date changes but not overwrite your original baseline cost data.
Finally, although you’re allowed to save up to 11 baseline plans, if you need 
more than that, consider using some interim and some baseline data to 
expand the number of sets of data that you can save.
Do not go baseline and interim plan crazy. Even in a long project, saving too 
many sets of plans can get confusing. When you do save a plan, print a copy 
for your records and make a notation of when and why the plan was saved to 
help you keep track.

250
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Saving an interim plan
Interim plans and baselines are saved via the same dialog box. The difference 
is that with an interim plan, you have to specify where the data is coming 
from. For example, if you want to save the start and finish dates from your 
Baseline2 plan to the third interim plan, you copy from Baseline2 to Start/
Finish3. If you want the current scheduled start and finish dates for all tasks, 
choose to copy from Start/Finish.
If you want to change currently scheduled start and finish dates in a baseline 
but you don’t want to change all the other data typically saved in a baseline, 
you can copy from Start/Finish to the baseline plan that you want to change.
Follow these steps to save an interim plan:
 
1. To save an interim plan for only certain tasks, select them.
 
2. Choose Project➪Set Baseline➪Set Baseline.
 
 The Set Baseline dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-6.
 
Figure 12-6: 
You can 
copy set-
tings from 
any saved 
baseline to 
an interim 
plan.
 
 
3. Select the Set Interim Plan radio button.
 
4. From the Copy drop-down list box, select the set of data that you want 
to copy to the interim plan.
 
5. From the Into drop-down list box, select the fields in which you want 
to store the interim plan data.
 
6. Select the appropriate radio buttons to save the plan for the entire 
project or selected tasks.
 
7. If you choose to save the plan for selected tasks, use the check boxes 
to indicate how roll up baseline options should work.
 
8. Click the OK button to save the plan.

251
 Chapter 12: It All Begins with a Baseline
By using the Copy and Into fields in the Set Baseline dialog box, you can save 
up to ten interim plans based on baseline or actual data.
Clearing and resetting a plan
Ten interim plans may seem like a lot now, but in the thick of a busy and 
ever-changing project, it may actually end up falling short of what you need. 
Because you can save only ten interim plans, you may need to clear one at 
some point and resave it.
Project piggybacks baseline and interim plan settings, so you actually choose 
a Clear Baseline menu command to clear an interim plan. This can be fright-
ening to those who think that clicking a Clear Baseline command will send 
their baseline into oblivion. Don’t worry — it won’t!
To clear an interim plan, follow these steps:
 
1. To clear only some tasks in an interim plan, select them.
 
2. Choose Project➪Set Baseline➪Clear Baseline.
 
 The Clear Baseline dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-7.
 
Figure 12-7: 
Clear and 
reset interim 
plans as 
often as you 
like.
 
 
3. Select the Clear Interim Plan option, and then choose the plan that 
you want to clear from the accompanying list.
 
4. Click to clear the specified interim plan for the entire project or for 
any tasks you have selected.
 
5. Click the OK button to clear the plan.
You can now save a new set of information to that interim plan, if you like.
You may want to save a backup of various versions of your file with interim 
and baseline data. If you clear a baseline or an interim plan, that data is gone 
forever!

▶ Moving a task
▶ Consolidating multiple projects
A
fter a project moves out of the planning stage and into action, it’s like a 
constantly changing game in which there are rules, goals, and a general 
time frame, but no one really knows which team will win (and sometimes 
where the ball is) until it’s over.
Whether a task happens as planned or wanders off in an unexpected direc-
tion, your job at this stage of the game is to record that activity, an activity 
referred to as tracking.
Tracking starts when your team reports their activity on the project. Then 
you (or someone else assigned to deal with tracking) must manage inputting 
that activity task by task.
When you track activity, you’ll be amazed at what data Project returns to 
you. Some of it will be good news and some bad, but all of it is useful in man-
aging your project throughout its lifetime.
Gathering Your Data
The first step in tracking progress on your project is to get information about 
what’s been going on. The amount of data you collect will be determined by 
what you need to track and at what level of detail. For example, some people 
don’t even create and assign resources to tasks because they use Project 

254
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
only to create a timeline for their activities, not to manage resource time or 
tally costs. Others use resources and want to track their total work on tasks, 
just not to the level of detail that scrutinizes hourly work performed. For 
some people, simply marking one task 50 percent complete and another 100 
percent complete — and letting Project assume that all resources put in their 
estimated amount of work — is fine. Your tracking method is determined by 
the amount and type of information you need to monitor.
Therefore, the first thing you have to do is identify the best tracking method 
for you.
A method to your tracking madness
Microsoft has identified four tracking methods:
 
✓ Task-total method
 
✓ Task-timephased method
 
✓ Assignment-total method
 
✓ Assignment-timephased method
You can begin to understand these by looking at the difference between task 
and assignment tracking. You can track information at the task level, indicat-
ing total work or costs for the task up to the present or as of a status date 
you select. Or, you can track costs by resource assignment, which is the more 
detailed way of tracking.
For example, suppose that the Test Electrical Components task is estimated 
to take 12 hours of work, according to your project baseline. Three human 
resources — Engineer, Electrician, and Assistant — are assigned at 100 per-
cent of their time. Tracking by task, you can simply note that the task is 75 
percent complete, which translates into nine hours of work finished.
Project assumes that the three resources split that work equally. In reality, 
however, the Engineer put in one hour, the Electrician put in six, and the 
Assistant put in two. If you want more detailed tracking that shows you totals 
of work for each resource assignment and accurately tracks them, you would 
track the work at the resource-assignment level.
But here’s where the timephased variable comes in: Whether you choose to 
track work on a task or the work done by individual resources on the task, 
you can also track by specific time increments — which Microsoft calls time-
phased tracking.

255
 Chapter 13: On the Right Track
So, with the Test Electrical Components task, you can use a task approach of 
tracking nine hours of work to date or use a timephased approach to record 
those hours on a day-by-day basis. With a resource-assignment approach, 
you can go to the very deepest level of tracking detail by tracking each and 
every resource’s work hour by hour, day by day.
Finally, if you want Project to keep an eye on costs, be sure to track fixed 
costs and material used on each task.
Going door to door
How do you get all the information about what work has been performed, 
by whom, and when? Well, the first method is the one you’ve probably been 
using for years: Hunt down the people on your project and ask them. Ask 
them in the hallway, in your weekly one-on-one meeting, or over lunch. Give 
each person a call or have everyone turn in a form.
This isn’t rocket science, but you still have to determine up front what 
information you want, when you want it, and what form it should be in. The 
simpler you can keep manual reporting of progress on a project, the better, 
because people will actually do it. The more routine you can make it — such 
as every Friday, on a set form turned into the same person, and so on — the 
easier it will be.
If you need only a summary of where the task stands — say 25, 50, 75, or 
100 percent complete — have the person in charge of the task give you that 
informed estimate. If you need total hours put into a task to date, resources 
can summarize their hours for you. If you need a blow-by-blow, hour-by-
hour, day-by-day report, you’re likely to collect some form of timesheet from 
resources.
 
If your company is set up to use Project Server, you can use Project Web App 
to gather resource timesheets in one convenient location. (See Chapter 19 for 
more about how to do this.)
You can probably get information about fixed costs that have been incurred 
if you ask your accounting department for it, or by getting a copy of a pur-
chase order or receipt from the person who spent the money.
 
Consider a third-party add-on product such as Sage TimeSheet (http://
sagetimesheet.com) for reporting resource activity. You make TimeSheet 
available to every resource on the project. The resources record their work 
time on it, and you can use TimeSheet’s tools to automatically update your 
project. If you’re using Project Professional edition, TimeSheet’s features are 
incorporated into Project Web App.

256
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Where Does All This Information Go?
After you gather information about task progress, fixed costs, and resource 
hours, you can input that information in several ways. You can use various 
views and tables to enter information in sheets of data, you can input infor-
mation in the Task Information dialog box, or you can use the tracking tools 
in the Schedule group of the Task tab on the Ribbon.
Doing things with the tracking tools
Sometimes it seems like Microsoft provides a handy button for everything, so 
why should tracking be any different? You can use the tracking tools at the 
top of the Schedule group on the Task tab to perform updates on selected 
tasks in any sheet view. Figure 13-1 shows the tracking tools and other but-
tons in the Schedule group.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Select a 
task and 
click one 
of the 
tools along 
the top to 
update it.
 
Let your project make the rounds
You can use the Send as Attachment feature 
from Backstage view to send your project to 
others and have them update their own activity.
The challenge with this method is that you need 
to manually incorporate the changes from the 
various files into a single file. However, the 
Compare Projects feature can help you with 
this chore (see Chapter 17).
Generally, the best use of e-mail for updating 
projects is simply to have team members send 
an e-mail with their activity to the person updat-
ing the project and then let that person make all 
the changes in one central location.

257
 Chapter 13: On the Right Track
You can use these tools to make specific updates to selected tasks:
 
✓ By clicking a Percentage Complete tool (0% to 100%), you can quickly 
mark a task’s progress using a calculation of the percentage of hours of 
work completed.
 
✓ Selecting a task and clicking the Mark on Track tool automatically 
records activity to the status date as you scheduled in your baseline. 
(The later section “Progress as of when?” explains how to set the status 
date.)
 
✓ The Update Tasks tool, which you can find in the menu that appears 
when you click the down arrow beside Mark on Track, displays a dialog 
box that contains tracking fields that you may recognize from the Task 
Information dialog box as well as some other fields you can use for 
updating your project. For example, you can indicate whether a task’s 
actual scheduled varied from its baseline.
You can use a few more tools found elsewhere in Project to track and illus-
trate progress:
 
✓ The Update Project tool enables you to mark all the tasks in a project 
as complete through a status date. You also can use it to resched-
ule uncompleted work to a future time. The section “Update Project: 
Sweeping Changes for Dummies,” later in this chapter, explains how to 
perform overall updates.
 
✓ The Move Task tool in the Tasks group of the Task tab on the Ribbon 
enables you to reschedule all or part of a selected task. You can move a 
task forward or backward, or reschedule parts of it by the status date. 
The “Moving a Task” section, later in this chapter, explains how to use 
this tool.
 
✓ The Add Progress Line tool turns on a kind of drawing tool. When you 
right-click the chart in Gantt Chart view and click Progress Lines, you 
can use the Progress Lines dialog box that appears to set up progress 
lines at particular dates. A progress line indicates which tasks are ahead 
of schedule as well as which ones are behind schedule, by means of a 
vertical line that connects in-progress tasks.
For everything there is a view
By now, you probably know that Project has a view for everything you 
want to do. For example, Task Sheet view and Task Usage view (as shown 
in Figures 13-2 and 13-3, respectively) allow you to update either task or 
resource information easily. So many variations are available, you may think 
that Microsoft charged by the view!

259
 Chapter 13: On the Right Track
Depending on the method of tracking you need (see the section “A method 
to your tracking madness,” earlier in this chapter), different views serve 
different purposes. Table 13-1 shows the best view to use for each tracking 
method.

When you find the right view with the right columns displayed, entering 
tracking information is as simple as typing a number of hours, a dollar 
amount for fixed costs, or a start or finish date in the appropriate column for 
the task you’re updating.
Tracking Your Work for the Record
You need to input several types of information to track progress on your 
project. First, you have to tell Project as of when you want to track progress: 
By default, it records information as of the current date based on your com-
puter’s date and time settings. However, if you want to record progress as of, 
say, the end of your company’s quarter, you can do that, too.
You can record actual start and finish dates for tasks, the percentage of a 
task that is complete (for example, a task may be 75 percent complete), and 
actual work performed (that is, the number of hours that resources put in 
on each task). If you think that the task will take less or more time than you 
anticipated, based on progress to date, you can modify the remaining dura-
tion for the task. You can also enter units of materials used and fixed-cost 
information for expenditures incurred, such as equipment rental or consult-
ing fees.
Progress as of when?
If you don’t know what day of the week it is, you can’t very well gauge 
whether you’re making the right amount of headway through your week’s 
work. Well, tracking is like that: The first thing you have to do is establish a 
status date, that is, the date as of which you are tracking progress.

260
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
By default, Project uses the date and time setting of your computer as 
the date when you enter actual activity information. However, sometimes 
you’ll want to time-travel. For example, suppose that your boss asks for a 
report that shows the status of the project as of the last day of the quarter, 
December 31. You gathered all your resources’ timesheets up through that 
date, but you didn’t get around to inputting those updates until three days 
after the end of the quarter. You can deal with this situation by setting the 
status date in Project to December 31 and then entering your tracking data. 
Even better, some automated tracking tools work along with the status date. 
For example, if you know that all the tasks in the project were on schedule as 
of the status date, you can use the Update Project tool to mark all scheduled 
work as complete up to the status date.
After you set the status date and enter information, Project uses that date 
to make calculations such as earned value (the value of work completed to 
date). Also, any task-complete or percentage-complete information records 
as of that date and progress lines in the chart area reflect that timing. Any 
reports or printouts of views that you generate give a picture of the status of 
your project as of that date.
Here’s how to set the status date:
 
1. Click the Project tab, and then click the date below Status Date. The 
Status Date tool is in the Status group of the tab.
 
 The Status Date dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-4. When you 
first open this dialog box, it shows the current date from your system’s 
date and time settings.
 
Figure 13-4: 
Set the 
status date 
here.
 
 
2. In the Select Date field, click the down arrow to display the calendar.
 
3. If you want to set the status date in another month, use the right or 
left arrow at the top of the calendar to navigate to that month.
 
4. Click the date you want.
 
5. Click the OK button.
Now you’re ready to start inputting tracking data.

261
 Chapter 13: On the Right Track
It’s totally on track
If you make the rounds and find that a task was or will be on schedule as of 
your status date, you can use an easy new tool to mark the task as partially 
complete through the status date. Project calculates the completion percent-
age as of the status date and marks the completion percentage accordingly. 
To use this tool, just select the task(s) to update and then click Mark on 
Track in the Schedule group of the Task tab.
Percentage complete: How to tell?
When people ask me how to figure out whether a task is 25 percent, 50 
percent, or even 36.5 percent complete, I usually refer them to their own 
intuition. If your boss asks you how things are coming on that report, you 
typically go through a quick internal calculation and come back with a rough 
estimate with no problem. A rough estimate, based on your experience and 
the information your resources provide you about their progress, is often 
good enough.
You can also calculate percentage complete in more precise ways. For 
example, if you estimate that a task should take ten hours of effort and your 
resources report performing five hours of effort, you could say you’re 50 per-
cent there. But be careful. Just because people have spent half the allocated 
time doesn’t mean that they have accomplished half the work.
You could go by costs: If your original estimates said that your four 
resources assigned to a four-day task would tally $4,000 of costs and the time 
your resources report spending on the task adds up to $3,000, you could 
guess that the task is 75 percent finished. But again, just because you’ve 
spent three-quarters of the money doesn’t mean that you’ve accomplished 
three-quarters of what you set out to do.
When a task’s deliverable is measurable, that helps a lot. For example, if you 
have a task to produce 100 cars on the assembly line in four days and you’ve 
produced 25 cars, you may be about 25 percent finished with the task. Or, if 
you were supposed to install software on ten computers in a computer lab 
and you’ve installed it on five of them, that’s an easy 50 percent.
But not every task can be calculated so neatly. The best rule of thumb is 
to trust your instincts and review what your team is telling you about their 
progress.

262
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
The simplest and quickest way to update percent complete on a task is to 
click the task to select it in any task-related view, and then click the 0%, 25%, 
50%, 75%, or 100% button on the Task tab. Alternatively, you can double-
click any task to open the Task Information dialog box and then enter the 
percent complete on the General tab there. You can also select a task, open 
the Mark on Track drop-down list, and click Update Tasks to open the Update 
Tasks dialog box and make the change there. If you want to enter a percent-
age in increments other than 25 percent, you’ll have to enter it in the Task 
Information or Update Tasks dialog box or the Percent Complete column in 
any sheet view.
When did you start? When did you finish?
If you note that a task is complete and don’t enter an actual start date, 
Project (ever the optimist) assumes you started on time. If you didn’t start 
on time and you want to reflect the actual timing, you should modify the 
actual start date. If you finished late, you should enter the actual finish date. 
However, be aware that if you don’t modify the task duration and enter an 
earlier finish date, the start date will be calculated to have occurred earlier.
You have several options of where to track this information. You can use the 
Update Tasks dialog box (shown in Figure 13-5), which you can open via the 
Mark on Track drop-down list in the Schedule group on the Task tab. You can 
also display a sheet view with Actual Start and Actual Finish columns, such 
as Tracking Gantt or Gantt Chart view with the Tracking table displayed. 
Then use the drop-down calendar in the Actual Start or Actual Finish column 
to specify a date. If you need to change the actual start date, you must mark 
the task as partially complete first. When you need to change both the actual 
start and actual finish dates, mark the task as 100% complete before specify-
ing the dates.
Can tracking get too detailed?
Does it make sense to track 2.25 percent of 
progress every other day on a two-month task? 
Probably not. Except on the lengthiest tasks, 
entering a percentage more finely broken down 
than 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent complete prob-
ably isn’t worth it. That’s partly because tasks 
longer than a few weeks should probably be 
broken down into subtasks for ease of tracking, 
and partly because one of the main purposes 
of tracking is reporting. If your boss or board or 
client could really care less about when you hit 
your exact 33.75 percent-complete point, why 
track it?
On the other hand, if (for some reason known 
only to you) your project must include a six-
month task and you can’t break it into subtasks, 
you may use percentages such as 10, 20, 30, 40, 
50, and so on to prevent having to wait a month 
between updates with (apparently) no progress 
to show.

A few conditions could cause a warning message to appear when you enter an 
actual start or finish date: for example, if the actual start date falls before the 
start date for the project, or if it causes a conflict with a dependent task. When 
this warning message appears, you have the following options:
 
✓ Cancel the operation
 
✓ Force the conflict to exist (or the task to start) before the project starts
If you want to cancel the change, correct what’s causing the problem (for 
example, by modifying the project start date), and then go back and enter the 
actual information, you can. Or you can force the conflict, and let it stand.
John worked three hours; 
Maisie worked ten
If you want to get to the blow-by-blow level of tracking, you need to record 
exactly how many hours each resource put in on your tasks. This can be 
about as much fun as typing the New York City phone book into a database, 
but it has some benefits. After you track actual hours, you can get tallies of 
total hours put in by each resource in your project by day, week, or month. 
If you have to bill clients based on resource hours (for example, if you’re a 
lawyer), you have a clear record to refer to. If you’re tracking a budget in 
detail, resource hours multiplied by their individual rates will tally an accu-
rate accounting of costs as finely as day by day.
If you don’t enter specific hours, Project just calculates the hours of work 
done on the task as a percentage of the total hours assigned. It assumes that 
each person assigned to the task has completed the same percentage of 
work. For many people, that’s fine; for others, more detail is better. If you’re 
in the detail camp, specify actual resource hours as a total by task or day by 
day through the life of each task.

264
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
To enter resource hours, follow these steps:
 
1. Display Task Usage view.
 
2. Scroll down to locate the task you want to track and its resource 
assignments.
 
 Each assigned resource is listed on a separate row underneath the task 
name.
 
3. Enter the hours put in by the resource:
 
• If you want to enter only total hours: Insert the Actual Work column 
into the sheet by right-clicking a column, choosing Insert Column, 
and selecting the Actual Work column. Enter the total hours in the 
newly displayed column.
 
• If you want to enter hours on the task day by day: Right-click the 
chart pane, and then choose Actual Work to display the Act. Work 
row. Figure 13-6 shows this row displayed in the Task Usage view. 
Click the Act. Work cell for a day that the resource worked and 
enter a number. Repeat this for each day that the resource worked 
on that task.

activity day

265
 Chapter 13: On the Right Track
If the hours you enter for a resource total more or less than the baseline esti-
mate for that resource on that task, here’s what happens:
 
✓ When you enter an amount in the Act. Work row and press Enter, the 
Actual Work column total recalculates to reflect the total hours worked 
on that task.
 
✓ A little pencil symbol appears in the ID column for that task, indicating 
that the assignment has been edited.
 
✓ A person icon appears in the Indicators column to the left of the task 
name, indicating a resource overallocation.
You can change the entries in the Work column or timephased work row for 
a task or assignment. If you do so, Project changes the task schedule accord-
ingly. Then if you mark actual work, it will be tracked compared with the 
edited working hours.
 
Note that you can easily look up the total hours put in by each resource on 
the project by checking the summary number of work hours listed next to 
the resource in the Resource Name column of Resource Usage view, another 
handy view where you can track assignments.
Uh-oh, we’re into overtime
When you enter 16 hours of work on a single day for a resource, even though 
that resource is based on a calendar with an 8-hour day, Project doesn’t rec-
ognize any of those hours as overtime. This is one case where you have to 
lead Project by the hand and actually tell it to specify overtime work.
When you enter hours in the Overtime Work field, Project interprets that as 
the number of total work hours that are overtime hours. So, if you enter 16 
hours of work on a task in the Work column and then enter 4 in the Overtime 
Automating updates via SharePoint Server
If your organization uses SharePoint Server, you 
can publish the project as a SharePoint Server 
task list and then sync status updates that team 
members make back into your Project file. This 
process helps automate your tracking. You can 
publish and sync the task list by selecting Share 
in the Outspace. Chapter 18 discusses working 
with SharePoint in more detail.

266
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Work column, Project assumes that there were 12 hours of work at the stan-
dard resource rate and 4 hours at the overtime rate.
To enter overtime hours, follow these steps:
 
1. Display Resource Usage view.
 
2. Right-click a column heading and choose Insert Column.
 
 The list of columns appears.
 
3. Select Overtime Work in the list.
 
4. Click in the Overtime Work column for a specific assignment for a 
resource, and then use the spinner arrows to specify the overtime 
hours.
Note that if you specify overtime, Project assumes that effort-driven tasks are 
happening in a shorter duration. After all, if the task was to take three 8-hour 
days (24 hours of work) to complete and you recorded that the resource 
worked 12 hours for two days in a row, Project figures that all the effort got 
accomplished in less time. The duration for the task will actually shrink. If 
that’s not what happened, you have to go in and manually modify the task 
duration.
Specifying remaining durations 
for autoscheduled tasks
A lot of tracking information for autoscheduled tasks has a weird and won-
derful relationship in Project. For example, Project tries to help you by cal-
culating durations based on other entries you make, such as actual start and 
finish dates. In that particular case, Project figures out task duration accord-
ing to those dates. (This works in reverse, too: If you enter the task duration, 
Project recalculates the finish date to reflect it.)
Sometimes you want to enter a duration rather than have Project base it on 
other information you input. For example, you may have entered a start date 
and 20 hours of work on a task that had a baseline of 16 hours of work. What 
Project can’t know is that the scope of the task changed, and now the task 
is not complete and will also take another 20 hours of work. You have to tell 
Project about that.
To modify the duration of a task in progress or completed, follow these steps:
 
1. Display Gantt Chart view.
 
2. Choose View➪Tables➪Tracking.
 
 The Tracking table is displayed.

267
 Chapter 13: On the Right Track
 
3. Click in the Actual Duration column for the task you want to modify, 
and then use the arrows to adjust the actual duration up or down.
 
4. If you want to enter a remaining duration, click in the Rem. Dur. 
(Remaining Duration) column and type a number as well as an incre-
ment symbol.
 
 For example, you may type 25d (where d is the increment symbol for 
days).
 
If you enter a percentage of completion for a task and then modify the dura-
tion to differ from the baseline, Project automatically recalculates the per-
centage considered complete to reflect the new duration. So, if you enter 50% 
complete on a 10-hour task and then modify the actual duration to 20 hours, 
Project considers that 5 hours (50 percent of 10 hours) as only 25 percent of 
the 20 hours.
Entering fixed-cost updates
Fixed costs are costs that aren’t influenced by time, such as equipment pur-
chases and consulting fees. Compared with the calculations and interactions 
of percentage completions and start and finish dates for hourly resources, 
fixed-cost tracking will seem like simplicity itself!
Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Display Gantt Chart view.
 
2. Choose View➪Tables➪Cost.
 
 The Cost table is displayed.
 
3. Click in the Fixed Cost column for the task you want to update.
 
4. Type the fixed cost, or a total of several fixed costs, for the task.
That’s it! However, because Project lets you enter only one fixed-cost amount 
per task, consider adding a note to the task itemizing the costs that you’ve 
included in the total. Also, no baseline fixed-cost column is available, so to 
compare how your actual fixed costs outstripped your baseline estimates, 
you have to do a little math to find the difference between baseline costs and 
actual costs: Deduct nonfixed costs to get the variation in fixed costs.
 
Consider using some of the ten customizable Cost columns for itemized fixed-
cost entry. Rename one Equipment Purchase, another Facility Rental, and so 
on, and then enter those costs in those columns. Of course, these columns of 
data may not perform calculations such as rolling up total costs to the sum-
mary tasks in your project, but they’ll serve as a reminder about itemized 
fixed costs.

268
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
In Project 2010, you can designate a resource type as Cost and assign a cost 
every time you assign that resource. The Cost column calculation of total cost 
includes the amount spent for Cost resources on tasks. See Chapter 7 for more 
about resource types.
Moving a Task
If you’ve ever been involved in managing subcontractors for any type of con-
struction project, you’ve probably heard the dreaded words, “My current 
job is running long, so I’ll get to your job in about a week.” What you’d rather 
hear from subcontractors or any other type of resource is, “My schedule 
opened up, so I can start work on this assignment a week early.” Project 2010 
now makes it easier to reschedule an entire task or reschedule part of a task 
as of the status date.
Here’s how to use the new Move Task tool:
 
1. Display Gantt Chart view.
 
2. If the task is partially complete and you want to move its uncompleted 
portion, set a status date.
 
3. Select the task to move.
 
4. Click the Move Task button in the Tasks group on the Task tab.
 
 The choices for rescheduling the task appear, as shown in Figure 13-7.
 
5. Specify how to move the task:
 
• If you want to move it forward or back by a default amount: Click 1 
Day, 1 Week, or 4 Weeks under either Move Task Forward or Move 
Task Back.
 
• If you want to move the task by a custom time frame: Click the 
appropriate Custom choice, specify the number of working days 
by which to move the task in the dialog box that appears, and click 
the OK button.
 
• If you want to reschedule part of the task according to the status date: 
Click Incomplete Parts to Status Date to split the task and move the 
uncompleted portion to resume later, starting on the status date. 
Click Completed Parts to Status Date to split the task and move the 
completed portion earlier, before the status date.
 
• If you want to reschedule the task based on the availability of the 
assigned resources: Click the appropriate Custom choice, specify 
the number of working days by which to move the task in the 
dialog box that appears, and click OK.

Update Project: Sweeping 
Changes for Dummies
If it’s been a while since you tracked activity and you want to update your 
schedule, Update Project may be for you. It allows you to track chunks of 
activity for a period of time. Update Project works best, however, if most 
tasks happened pretty much on schedule.
This is not fine-tuned tracking: It’s akin to getting your bank balance, draw-
ing a line in your checkbook, and writing down that balance as gospel rather 
than accounting for your balance check by check. (If you’re like most of us, 
you’ve done this at least once.) Doing so assumes that all your checks and 
deposits probably tally with what the bank says as of that date; thus, going 
forward, you’re back on track.
Here are the setting choices Update Project offers you:
 
✓ Update Work as Complete Through: You can update your project 
through the status date you specify in this box in one of two ways. The 
Set 0% – 100% Complete setting lets Project figure out the percent 
complete on every task that should have begun by that time. By making 

270
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
this choice, you tell Project to assume that the tasks started and pro-
gressed exactly on time. The Set 0% or 100% Complete Only setting 
works a little differently. This setting says to Project, just record 100% 
complete on tasks that the baseline said would be complete by now, but 
leave all other tasks at 0% complete.
 
✓ Reschedule Uncompleted Work to Start After: This setting reschedules 
the portions of tasks that aren’t yet complete to start after the specified 
date.
To use Update Project, follow these steps:
 
1. Display Gantt Chart view.
 
2. To update only certain tasks, select them.
 
3. Choose Project➪Update Project.
 
 The Update Project dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-8.
 
Figure 13-8: 
You can 
update only 
selected 
tasks or the 
entire 
project.
 
 
4. Choose the Update method you prefer: Set 0% – 100% Complete or Set 
0% or 100% Complete Only.
 
5. If you want a status date other than the one shown or did not previ-
ously set a status date, set the date to use in the field in the upper-
right corner.
 
6. If you want Project to reschedule any work rather than updating work 
as complete, select the Reschedule Uncompleted Work to Start After 
option and then select a date from the list.
 
7. Choose whether you want these changes to apply to the entire project 
or only to selected tasks.
 
8. Click the OK button to save the settings and have Project make 
updates.
If you want, you can use Update Project to make some global changes, such 
as marking all tasks that should be complete according to baseline as 100 
percent complete. Then go in and perform more detailed task-by-task track-
ing on individual tasks that are only partially complete.

271
 Chapter 13: On the Right Track
Tracking Materials Usage
Tracking the amount of materials used on tasks involves tracking actual units 
at the material resource level. So, if you create a resource called rubber and 
assign it to the Manufacture Tires task at 500 tons, but you actually used 
only 450 tons (in other words, you made 450 tons of rubber streeeetch), you 
would enter the actual units used.
This situation is akin to the way you track work resource hours on tasks. To 
make it happen, just follow these steps:
 
1. Display Resource Usage view.
 
2. Locate the material resource in the list, and under the resource name, 
double-click the assignment for which you want to enter the actual 
units.
 
 The Assignment Information dialog box appears (see Figure 13-9).
 
Figure 13-9: 
You also 
can use the 
Assignment 
Information 
dialog box 
to enter 
actuals.
 
 
3. Click the Tracking tab.
 
4. Enter the actual units used in the Actual Work field.
 
5. Click the OK button.
If you need to enter actual units for multiple assignments, you can use the 
method I showed you earlier in the section “John worked three hours; Maisie 
worked ten.” Right-click the right side of the view and choose Actual Work 
to display the Act. Work row. You can then plug in your actual data there. 
Just keep in mind that if you assign the material resource of, say, 500 tons to 
a five-day task, Resource Usage view reflects that Project spread the usage 
out — 100 tons for each of the five days of the task. If you don’t care on what 
day of the task the materials were used, you can simply modify one of the set-
tings to be higher or lower to make up for any difference in actual usage.

272
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Tracking More Than One: 
Consolidated Projects
Often you’ll have either projects that are related in some fashion (such as 
sharing resources or having timing dependencies between them) or a series 
of smaller projects that make up a larger project. In that case, you can con-
solidate those separate projects into one file, either as a series of summary 
tasks or with all summary and subtasks included.
When you consolidate projects, you can choose to link to the source file. 
When you do, any changes to the source file are represented in the consoli-
dated file.
If it’s your job to keep track of the big picture, you have to understand how 
consolidated projects get updated.
Consolidating projects
Creating a consolidated project is sort of like going to a Chinese restaurant — 
one from Column A, one from Column B, and so on, until you build yourself a 
tasty meal. In Project, you open a blank file and then insert existing projects 
to build a satisfying master project plan.
The neat thing about consolidated projects is that you have some choices 
about how the consolidated project and the source files you insert in it inter-
act. For example, you can link to a source file so that changes made in the 
source file will be reflected in the consolidated project. This is a great tool 
for somebody who has to keep his or her eye on multiple phases or many 
smaller projects.
 
You can also create dependencies between inserted projects in the consoli-
dated file. If you have (for example) one project that can’t start until another 
one finishes, you can clearly see in the consolidated file how various separate 
projects in your organization have an impact on each other.
The other thing you can do to relate consolidated projects to their source 
files is to make your consolidated project a two-way street, allowing changes 
in it to be reflected in the source files. You can also make the choice to have 
the source files be read-only so that your changes won’t go mucking around 
with other people’s files — whichever suits your purposes.

273
 Chapter 13: On the Right Track
To create a consolidated file, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a blank Project file and display Gantt Chart view.
 
2. Click in the Task Name column.
 
 If you’re inserting multiple projects, click the row in which you want 
the inserted file(s) to appear. If you want to insert a project between 
existing tasks, click the task beneath where you want the project to be 
inserted.
 
3. Choose Project➪Subproject. Subproject is in the Insert group.
 
 The Insert Project dialog box, shown in Figure 13-10, appears.
 
Figure 13-10: 
Make 
choices 
about how 
your proj-
ects interact 
in this 
dialog box.
 
 
4. Using the navigation pane and file list, locate the Project file you want 
to insert and select it.
 
5. (Optional) Click the down arrow on the Insert button if you want to 
change the default Insert setting to Insert Read Only.
 
6. If you want to link the project in this file to the source file so that 
whenever you open the consolidated file it updates automatically, 
make sure that the Link to Project check box is selected.
 
7. Click the OK button.
 
 The project is inserted in your file with the summary task showing and 
all subtasks hidden. To display all tasks in the inserted project, just click 
the plus sign to the left of the summary task.

274
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
If you want to insert multiple subprojects, leave them all collapsed. This will 
ensure that they are all inserted at the topmost level of the outline in the con-
solidated project.
Updating consolidated projects
You have two ways to skin the cat called updating a consolidated project, and 
the one you use depends on whether you linked to the source files when you 
inserted them. If you linked the files and you inserted them without the read-
only setting, changes in source files are reflected in the consolidated file (and 
vice versa). Updating is simply a matter of making sure that all the files are 
available in their original linked locations (for example, in a folder on your 
network), and then Project updates automatically.
If you haven’t linked the files, changes in source files won’t be reflected in 
consolidated files, and the consolidated file information will have no effect 
on the source information. You may create such an unlinked consolidated 
file if you simply want to see a snapshot of how all projects are going at the 
moment, and you don’t want to run the risk of having your settings changing 
the source information. In this case, however, if you want to track progress, 
you have to create a new consolidated project or manually enter all updates.
 
After you insert projects in a file, you can move them around using the Cut 
and Paste tools. When you do, message windows may appear, offering you 
options to resolve any conflicts that may occur because of dependency links 
you’ve created between inserted projects.
Changing linking settings
Changing your mind is a project manager’s prerogative. So, if, after you have 
inserted a source file in a consolidated file, you find that you didn’t initially 
establish a link, you can go in and change that setting so that the files update 
each other automatically.
Follow these steps to make changes to the inserted project:
 
1. Open the consolidated file.
 
2. Display Gantt Chart view.
 
3. Double-click the task name of the inserted project you want to update.
 
 The Inserted Project Information dialog box appears (as shown in Figure 
13-11).

Observing Progress
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing what your progress looks like with indicators and task bars
▶ Seeing progress from various Project views
▶ Examining cost and time variances
▶ Understanding earned value
▶ Modifying calculation options
S
ome people use Project just to paint a pretty picture of what their proj-
ect will entail and then put the plan in a drawer. That’s a mistake. After 
you enter all your project data, save a baseline, and then track actual activity 
on your project, you get an amazing array of information back from Project 
that helps you to stay on time and on budget.
After you track some actual activity on tasks, Project allows you to view base-
line estimates right alongside your real-time plan. Project alerts you to tasks 
that are running late and also shows how the critical path shifts over time.
Project also provides detailed budget information. In fact, the information 
that you can get about your costs may just make your accounting depart-
ment’s heart sing. The information is detailed and uses terms that accoun-
tants love (such as earned value, cost variance, and budgeted cost of work 
performed, all translated in a later section of this chapter).
So keep that project file close at hand — and take a look at how Project can 
make you the most informed project manager in town.
Seeing Where Tasks Stand
You diligently entered resource work hours on tasks, recorded the percent-
age of progress on tasks, and entered fixed costs. Now what? Well, all that 

278
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
information has caused several calculations to go on — and updates to be 
reflected — in your project. It’s time to take a quick look at the changes that 
all your tracking has produced in your Project plan.
Getting an indication
A lot of information in Project just sits there waiting for you to hunt it down 
in obscure views or tables, but one tool that Project uses to practically jump 
up and down and say, “Look at this!” is indicator icons. You’ve seen these 
icons in the Indicator column and probably wondered what the heck they 
were for. Well, these little symbols give you a clue to important facts about 
each task, sometimes alerting you to problems or potential challenges.
Figure 14-1 shows several of these indicators, some of which relate to the 
results of tracking your project.
 
Figure 14-1: 
The check 
marks for 
tasks 2 
through 4 
mean that

plete. the 
paper icon

Indicator icons

279
 Chapter 14: A Project with a View: Observing Progress
 
If you see an unfamiliar indicator icon crop up in your project, hold your 
mouse pointer over the indicator. A box that describes its meaning appears. 
To get a list of Project icons and their meanings, go to Help, click the Index 
tab, and type icon in the Search box. Click Search and then click Indicator 
Fields.
Lines of progress
Progress lines offer an additional visual indicator of how you’re doing. As you 
can see in Figure 14-2, a progress line zigzags among tasks and forms, show-
ing left- or right-pointing peaks. These peaks indicate late or early tasks (cal-
culated according to the status date you set for tracking or another date that 
you specify). A progress line that points to the left of a task indicates that the 
task is running late. Progress lines that point to the right show that, wonder 
of wonders, you’re running ahead of schedule. (Treasure these: They don’t 
seem to appear often in projects!)

Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Displaying progress lines
By default, Project doesn’t display progress lines. You have to turn them on. 
And while you’re at it, you may as well specify when and how they appear. 
Here’s how to make settings for and display progress lines:
 
1. Display Gantt Chart view.
 
2. Right-click the chart portion of the view and choose Progress Lines.
 
 The Progress Lines dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-3.
 
Figure 14-3: 
These two 
tabs allow 
you to 
control just 
about every-
thing about 
progress 
lines.
 
 
3. If you want Project to always show a progress line for the current or 
status date, select the Display check box under Current Progress Line 
and then select At Project Status Date or At Current Date.
 
4. If you want progress lines to be displayed at set intervals, do the 
following:
 
a. Select the Display Progress Lines check box under Recurring 
Intervals, and then select Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.
 
b. Specify the interval settings.
 
 For example, if you select Weekly, you can choose every week, 
every other week, and so on, as well as which day of the week the 
line should be displayed for on the timescale. Figure 14-4 shows a 
project with progress lines at regular intervals.
 
5. Choose whether you want to display progress lines beginning at the 
Project start or on another date.
 
 To use the Project start date, simply select the Project Start option in 
the Begin At section of the dialog box. To select an alternate start date, 
select the second option and then select a date from the calendar drop-
down list.

281

6. If you want to display a progress line on a specific date, select the 
Display check box under Selected Progress Lines and then choose a 
date from the Progress Line Dates drop-down calendar.
 
 You can make this setting for multiple dates by clicking subsequent lines 
in this list and selecting additional dates.
 
 You can choose to display progress lines in relation to actual or baseline 
information.
 
 If a task has been tracked to show 50 percent complete and you choose 
to have Project display progress lines based on actual information, the 
peak appears relative to the 50 percent actual line, not the complete 
baseline task bar.
 
7. Click the OK button to save your settings.
Formatting progress lines
In keeping with the almost mind-boggling array of formatting options that Project 
makes available to you, you can modify how progress lines are formatted.
As with any changes to formatting, you’re tampering with the way Project 
codes visual information for readers. You should be cautious about making 
formatting changes that cause your plan to be difficult to read for those who 
are used to Project’s default formatting.

282
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
To modify progress-line formatting, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the chart portion of the view in Gantt Chart view and 
choose Progress Lines.
 
2. Click the Line Styles tab, if necessary, to display the options shown in 
Figure 14-5.
 
Figure 14-5: 
Select line 
styles and 
colors with 
these 
settings.
 
 
3. In the Progress Line Type display, click a line style sample.
 
4. In the Line Type fields, click a style from the samples shown.
 
 You can make two settings here: one for the current progress line and 
one for all other progress lines.
 
5. You can change the line color, progress point shape, and progress 
point color by making different choices in those boxes.
 
6. If you want a date to appear alongside each progress line, select the 
Show Date for Each Progress Line check box and then select a date 
from the Format field.
 
7. If you want to change the font used for the displayed date, click the 
Change Font button and make your changes.
 
8. Click the OK button to save your settings.
When worlds collide: Baseline versus actual
One of the most obvious ways to view the difference between your baseline 
estimates and what you’ve tracked in your project is through task bars. After 
you track some progress on tasks, the Gantt chart shows a black bar 

283
 Chapter 14: A Project with a View: Observing Progress
superimposed on the task bar that represents your baseline. For example, 
in Figure 14-6, Tasks 2 through 4 are complete; you can tell this by the solid 
black bar that extends the full length of the task bar. Task 6 is only partially 
complete; the black, actual task line only partially fills the duration for the 
task. Task 7 has no recorded activity on it; you see no black actual line, only 
the normal task bar.
 
Figure 14-6: 
The solid 
line on task 
bars repre-
sents actual 
activity in 
your project.
 
Studying by the Numbers
Visual indicators such as task bars and indicator icons are useful to alert 
you to delays or variances between estimated and actual performance, but 
they don’t provide any detailed information. To get the real lowdown on how 
far ahead (or behind) you are, down to the day or penny, you need to give 
the numbers a scan. The numbers that Project provides reveal much about 
whether you’re on schedule and within your budget.

284
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Two tables you can display in Gantt Chart view bring your situation into bold 
relief. The Cost table and Variance table provide information about dollars 
spent and variations in timing between baseline and actual activity.
The Cost table is shown in Figure 14-7. Here you can review data that com-
pares baseline estimates of fixed costs and actual costs. These two sets of 
data are presented side by side in columns. In the project shown in Figure 
14-7, the current total cost based on tracked information is $297,670 and 
your baseline estimate was $296,930, giving you a variance of $740 over your 
budget.
 
Figure 14-7: 
The 
Variance 
column 
shows the 
difference 
between 
the total 
cost and the 
baseline.
 
 
To display a table, choose View➪Tables and click the table name.
Figure 14-8 shows the Variance table. This table shows whether or not your 
scheduling is on track or has variances, much like the Cost table shows cost 
variances. It shows the variance between baseline start and finish dates and 

285
 Chapter 14: A Project with a View: Observing Progress
task durations, as well as the timing that actually occurred on tasks after 
your project got going.
 
Figure 14-8: 
Use this 
table to see 
what delays 
are doing
 to your 
schedule.
 
Another useful way to view variances is to show Tracking Gantt view. This 
view by default has two thin task bars for each task. The bottom, gray bar 
shows the baseline, while the top bar shows the current (scheduled) or 
actual (tracked) schedule. The color of the top bar will vary depending on 
whether it’s a critical task or not if auto scheduled, or whether it’s a manually 
scheduled task. As shown in Figure 14-9, Tracking Gantt view enables you to 
show and tell exactly where a project went off track or picked up steam.
 
If you created a slack task to help you deal with delays that may come up, 
the total variance shown here will tell you how many days you may have to 
deduct from the duration of the slack task to get back on track. Read more 
about making adjustments in your plan to deal with delays and cost overruns 
in Chapter 15 and about slack in Chapter 10.

Acronym Soup: BCWP, 
ACWP, EAC, and CV
In any view, you can insert several columns of data to give you some calcu-
lated analyses of what’s going on in your project budget. You also can find 
this information in the Earned Value report. Chapter 16 gives you the low-
down on reporting. Much of this data will mean more to an accountant than 
to most in-the-trenches project managers. If only to make your accountant 
feel more comfortable, you should become familiar with some of the most 
common calculations. Also, many organizations require information on these 
specific numbers in project reports:
 
✓ EV- Earned Value, formerly known as BCWP (budgeted cost of work 
performed): Earned value is essentially a calculation of the value of the 
work that you’ve completed expressed in dollars. For example, if a task 
has $2,000 of costs associated with it and you record that the task is 50 
percent complete, the earned value for that task is $1,000 (50 percent of 
the baseline estimated costs).
 
✓ ACWP (actual cost of work performed): This calculation looks at actual 
costs, including tracked resource hours or units expended on the task 

287
 Chapter 14: A Project with a View: Observing Progress
plus fixed costs. Whereas earned value looks at the baseline value of 
work, ACWP looks at actual tracked costs.
 
✓ EAC (estimate at completion): This is a total of all costs on a task. For a 
task in progress, EAC calculates the actual costs recorded to date plus 
the remaining baseline estimated costs.
 
✓ CV (cost variance): This represents the difference between planned costs 
(that is, costs included in the baseline for a task) and the combination of 
actual costs recorded to date plus any remaining estimated costs. This 
number is expressed as a negative number if you’re under budget and as 
a positive number if you’re like the rest of us (over budget).
Studying these numbers can help you see what it has cost to get where you 
are today on your project.
Calculations behind the Scenes
While you’re happily entering resource hours and fixed costs into your proj-
ect, Project is busy making calculations that can shift around task timing and 
resource workload in your plan. These calculations relate to how tasks are 
updated, how the critical path is determined, and how earned value is calcu-
lated. If you’re a control freak, you’ll be happy to know that you can, to some 
extent, control how Project goes about making these calculations.
 
Remember that the new Change Highlighting feature helps you see what effect 
an individual change has on your project. See Chapter 10 for more about this 
feature.
Going automatic or manual
By default, Project is on automatic as far as calculations go. When you make 
a change to your plan, Project recalculates totals, the critical path, and so on 
without you having to lift a finger. However, you can change that default set-
ting and have Project wait for you to initiate calculations manually. You do so 
in the Project Options dialog box (File➪Options), in the Schedule category. 
Figure 14-10 shows some of the settings available there.
If you change the Calculate Project After Each Edit setting to Off, you must 
click the Calculate Project button in the Schedule group on the Project tab of 
the Ribbon anytime you want Project to perform all its calculations. You also 
have the choice here of setting different modes for only the current project 
or for all open projects.

288
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track

option under 
Calculation

automatic 
recalcula-
tion.
 
So why would you choose to use manual calculation? You may want to make 
a lot of changes and not have Project take the milliseconds required to recal-
culate between each change, slowing your entry work. You can put things on 
manual, make all your changes, and then use the Calculate Project button to 
make all the changes at once.
In addition, because even with Change Highlighting on, it’s not always easy 
to spot all the items that have been recalculated when you make a series of 
changes, it may be easier to make all the changes in manual mode, print your 
Gantt Chart view, and then recalculate and compare the two. This approach 
shows you the cumulative calculations that occurred when all your changes 
were made so that you can see whether you’re happy with the revised plan. 
(This feature is especially useful for trying out what-if scenarios.)
 
In Project 2010, you can also take advantage of the Multiple Undo feature. This 
means that you can leave your calculations on automatic, make changes, and 
then undo them, thereby undoing the calculations in sequence. For more on 
Multiple Undo, see Chapter 10.
Earned-value options
You’ve probably spent many sleepless nights wondering, “What do the set-
tings I can make to the earned-value calculation do to my project?” Well, start 
by looking at Figure 14-11, which shows you the earned value calculation set-
tings in the Advanced category of the Project Options dialog box.

289
 Chapter 14: A Project with a View: Observing Progress
 
Figure 14-11: 
Here are 
two simple 
settings 
to use for 
calculat-
ing earned 
value.
 
The Default Task Earned Value Method setting provides two choices:
 
✓ % Complete: This setting calculates earned value using the percent com-
plete that you record on each task. This assumes that for a task that’s 
halfway complete, half the work hours have been used.
 
✓ Physical % Complete: Use this setting if you want to enter a percent of 
completion that is not based on a straight percent-complete calculation. 
For example, if you have a four-week task to complete a mail survey, 
50 percent of the effort may happen in the first 25 percent of the dura-
tion of the project: designing, printing, and mailing the survey. Nothing 
happens for two weeks while you wait for responses, and then you see 
a flurry of activity when the responses come back. So a straight calcu-
lation that 50 percent of the task is completed 50 percent of the way 
through wouldn’t be accurate. If your projects have a lot of tasks like 
this, you may consider changing your settings to use this method. Then, 
you can display the Physical % Complete column in your Gantt Chart 
sheet and enter what you consider more accurate percent-complete 
information for each task.
The second setting in the Earned Value Options for the Project section of 
the Project Options dialog box is the Baseline for Earned Value Calculation 
drop-down list. As I mention earlier, earned value is the value of work com-
pleted, expressed in dollars, according to the baseline: A $2,000 task at 50 
percent complete (for example) has a $1,000 earned value of work performed. 
Therefore, the baseline against which you calculate this value is hugely 
important. Choose any of the 11 possible baselines you may have saved in 

290
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
your project here. After you make these two choices, click OK to close the 
Project Options dialog box.
You should explore one more option in the Project Options dialog box that 
concerns earned value calculation. The Edits to Total Task % Complete Will 
Be Spread to the Status Date check box, which is not selected by default, 
affects how Project distributes changes in your schedule. If this option is left 
deselected, calculations go to the end of the duration of tasks in progress, 
rather than up to the status date or the current date. If you do select this 
option, calculations spread changes across your plan up to the status date or 
the current date, and no farther. Selecting this choice helps you see changes 
to your project in increments of time, rather than across the life of tasks in 
progress.
 
If I were you, I’d leave the Edits to Total Task % option deselected for the most 
accurate reflection of progress on your project.
How many critical paths are enough?
Three last Project Options settings that you may want to examine concern 
critical path calculations.
The Inserted Projects Are Calculated Like Summary Tasks option, near the 
bottom of the Schedule category, is straightforward. If you insert another 
project as a task in your project, selecting this setting allows Project to 
calculate one critical path for your entire project. If you don’t select it, any 
projects you insert are treated like outsiders — that is, they’re not taken into 
account in the master project’s critical-path calculations. If an inserted proj-
ect won’t have an effect on your project’s timing, you may want to deselect 
this option.
If following one project’s critical path is too tame for you, try getting critical 
with multiple paths. By selecting the Calculate Multiple Critical Paths check 
box, near the bottom of the Advanced category, you set up Project to calcu-
late a different critical path for each set of tasks in your project. Doing so can 
be helpful if you want to identify tasks that if delayed, will cause you to miss 
your final project deadline or the goals of a single phase in your project.
Finally, you can establish what puts a task on the critical path by specifying 
the number of days of slack critical tasks may have. By default, tasks with no 
slack are on the critical path. However, you can change this situation if you 
want to be alerted that tasks with only one day of slack are critical — figur-
ing that one day isn’t much padding and that these tasks are still in jeopardy. 
The Tasks Are Critical if Slack Is Less Than or Equal to (x) Days setting is 
found right below the Calculate Multiple Critical Paths check box in the 
Advanced category.

I
n almost every project, there comes a time when you feel like the floor 
dropped out from under you. Suddenly — and this one just snuck up on 
you — you’re $20,000 over budget. Or, you’re going to miss that drop-dead 
finish date by two weeks. All the aspirin in the world isn’t going to solve 
this one.
Of course, you have a general idea of what happened because you’re smart, 
you kept in touch with your team, and you have Project and all its columns of 
data. Still, somehow things are off track, and you need to take action at this 
point. First, you have to justify what occurred (abbreviated CYA), and then 
you have to fix things so that you can go forward and just maybe save your 
project, your job, or both.
How do you save the day when things go off track? What you have to do at 
this point involves analyzing your options and making some tough choices. 
This is stuff you did before you ever heard of Microsoft Project. However, 
Project can help you try some possible solutions and anticipate the likely 
results. After you decide what to do, you have to implement your solutions in 
Project.
Justifying Yourself: Notes, Baselines, 
and Interim Plans
If you’ve kept interim plans, multiple baselines, and task notes in Project, it’s 
much easier to explain how you got into this mess to the powers-that-be.

292
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Interim plans and multiple baselines demonstrate how you made adjustments 
when major changes or problems occurred. Using these two items indicates 
to your boss that you were on top of things all the way and probably kept 
him or her in the loop by generating printouts or reports reflecting major 
changes as they came up. (If you didn’t, print them now from the interim 
plans or baselines you saved along the way — and let them paint a picture of 
what happened.)
 
A baseline saves pertinent project data including start and finish dates, dura-
tion, work, and cost; an interim plan saves only the start and finish dates of 
tasks in the project. Chapter 12 deals with interim plans and baselines.
To view or print information from various baselines or interim plans, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Display Task Sheet view.
 
2. Scroll the sheet pane to the right and click the Add New Column 
column heading.
 
 The menu with the available fields appears, as shown in Figure 15-1.
 
Figure 15-1: 
Insert as 
many col-
umns as you 
like in any 
view with a 
sheet pane.
 
 
3. Scroll down, and click the field to insert.
 
 For example, you may choose Start 1-10 and Finish 1-10 for any one of 
your interim plans (or choose Baseline through Baseline 10 for baseline 
data).

293
 Chapter 15: You’re Behind: Now What?
 
4. If you need to, repeat Steps 2 and 3 to display additional columns. 
Click the OK button to display the column(s).
In addition to interim plans and baselines, task notes should include informa-
tion about resource performance on a task, vendor problems, or late deliv-
eries. Notes that are especially important to add are those you make when 
someone in authority over you has asked for a change and okayed more 
money or time to make that change. (Don’t worry, this hardly ever happens.)
 
Multiple Baselines Gantt view by default shows the first three baselines that 
you’ve saved — Baseline, Baseline1, and Baseline2. To show this view, click 
the Task tab, click the bottom portion of the Gantt Chart button, and click 
More Views on the menu. Click Multiple Baselines Gantt in the Views list of the 
More Views dialog box, and then click the Apply button. 
 
To add a note to a task, either display the Notes column in a task sheet 
pane or double-click a task and add the note on the Notes tab of the Task 
Information dialog box.
What If?
Just as you can get too close to a problem to see a solution, you can get too 
close to your project to recognize what you need to do. With Project’s filter-
ing and sorting features, though, you can slice and dice various aspects of 
your project a little differently to get a fresh perspective.
You can also use tools such as resource leveling to solve resource conflicts. 
Resource leveling may not always solve problems to your taste, but it’s a 
good way to let Project show you one what-if scenario that can solve most 
resource problems instantly.
 
See Chapter 10 for more information about how to use resource leveling.
Sorting things out
Sometimes when things won’t sort themselves out, it’s time to sort your 
tasks. Project allows you to sort tasks by several criteria, including start date, 
finish date, priority, and cost.
How can sorting help you? Well, here are a few examples:
 
✓ To cut costs: Consider sorting tasks by cost. Then you can focus on the 
most expensive tasks first to see whether there’s room to trim nice-to-
have-but-pricey items.

294
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
✓ To delete tasks to save time: Display tasks by priority, and then look at 
the low-priority tasks as the first candidates for the waste bin.
 
✓ To review task timing: Sort by duration in descending order to see the 
longest tasks first.
If you want to apply a preset sorting order, simply choose View➪Sort and 
then choose an option from the submenu, such as By Start Date or By Cost.
If you want to see additional sort criteria — or sort by more than one crite-
rion — follow these steps:
 
1. Choose View➪Sort➪Sort By.
 
 The Sort dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-2.
 
Figure 15-2: 
Sort by up 
to three 
criteria in 
ascending 
or descend-
ing order.
 
 
2. In the Sort By list, select a criterion.
 
3. Select either Ascending (to sort from lowest to highest) or Descending 
(to sort from highest to lowest).
 
 With a date field, the sorting order would be soonest to latest and latest 
to soonest, respectively; with a text field, alphabetical would be the 
order.
 
4. (Optional) If you want a second criterion, click the first Then By box 
and make a selection.
 
 For example, if you choose to sort first by Cost and then by Type, tasks 
are sorted from least expensive to most expensive, and then (within 
each cost level) by type (Fixed Duration, Fixed Units, and Fixed Work).
 
5. (Optional) If you want to add a third criterion, click the second Then 
By box and make a selection.
 
6. Click the Sort button.
To return to your original task order, choose View➪Sort➪By ID. Tasks are now 
back in task ID number order, which is Project’s standard sorting criterion.

295
 Chapter 15: You’re Behind: Now What?
Filtering
Chapter 10 deals with how you create and apply filters in Project. Now is a 
good time to call on your knowledge of those features. Especially in larger 
projects, where it’s not always easy to scan hundreds of tasks and notice 
which ones are running late or over budget, filters can home in on exactly 
where your trouble lies.
 
You can choose to have tasks that don’t meet filter criteria removed from 
your display or simply highlight tasks that meet the criteria on-screen.
Table 15-1 lists some filters that are useful when you’re trying to identify and 
solve problems with your schedule. The first six filters are task filters. The 
rest are resource filters.
Table 15-1 
Filters to Isolate Problems
Filter Name
What It Displays
Critical
Tasks in the project that must be completed according to 
schedule to make your final deadline (critical path)
Cost Overbudget
Tasks that exceed budgeted expenditures
Incomplete Tasks
Tasks that haven’t been marked as complete
Late/Overbudget 
Tasks Assigned To
Tasks assigned to a resource that you specify that are run-
ning later than their baseline estimate and are over budget
Should Start By
Tasks that should have started as of a specified date
Slipped/Late 
Progress
Tasks that are running late and have no progress recorded
Overallocated 
Resources
Tasks with resources assigned that are overbooked at some 
point during the life of the task
Slipping 
Assignments
Tasks that involve resource work that should have begun 
by now
Work Incomplete
Tasks that should have had all their work recorded by now
Work Overbudget
More work hours have been put in on the task than you had 
estimated
Don’t see all these choices in the More Filters dialog box? Remember, when 
you use this dialog box (choose View➪Filtered For➪More Filters), you have 
to enable the Task option to see task-related filters and the Resource option 
to see resource-related filters.
 
You may also consider exporting your Project information to a program such 
as Excel so that you can use analysis tools, such as pivot tables, to figure out 

296
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
what’s going on. If that idea excites you, you may want to check out Excel 
2007 Data Analysis For Dummies, by Stephen Nelson (published by Wiley). The 
Save As Type drop-down list at the bottom of the Project Save As dialog box 
enables you to choose the export format.
Examining the critical path
One of the most useful filters is the one called Critical. This displays or highlights 
all tasks that are on the critical path. If you’re running late, knowing which tasks 
can’t slip helps you identify where there is no room for delay — and, conversely, 
where you can delay noncritical tasks and still meet your deadline. You may use 
the Critical filter to help you determine how to free overallocated resources or 
get a task that’s running late back on track.
 
You can also ensure that the Gantt chart shows the Gantt bars for critical tasks 
in red. To do so, click the Gantt Chart Tools Format tab on the Ribbon and make 
sure that the Critical Tasks option is selected in the Bar Styles group.
You can look at the critical path in any Gantt Chart or Network Diagram view. 
Figure 15-3 shows Gantt Chart view of a project with the critical path high-
lighted using a highlight filter. Figure 15-4 shows Network Diagram view with 
the same filter applied.

If you need a closer look at task timing, consider modifying the timescale dis-
play to use smaller increments of time, such as days or hours. To do so, right-
click the timescale itself and then choose Timescale.
Use resource leveling one more time
If you performed manual resource leveling earlier in your project to solve 
resource conflicts, consider trying it again. With changes to tasks and 
tracked activity, resource leveling may give you some new options to solve 
conflicts.
If resource leveling is set to Automatic, Project automatically performs this 
calculation every time you modify your schedule. To see whether this is set 
to Automatic or Manual, choose Resource➪Leveling Options to open the 
Resource Leveling dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-5. If the Manual radio 
button is selected, click the Level All button to run resource leveling.

Here’s

What’s driving the timing of this task?
The Task Inspector feature allows you to review what is causing tasks to 
fall in a certain time frame, such as dependencies, a task calendar, or task 
constraints. You simply select a task and then click the Inspect button in the 
Tasks group of the Task tab, which displays a pane that lists all factors that 
affect the timing of that task.
By using this feature, which you can read more about in Chapter 10, you 
can determine whether a task that you’d like to happen earlier could do 
so if you remove some dependency or constraint affecting it. For example, 
early in your planning, you may have thought that the training task couldn’t 
start until all the equipment was delivered, but now that half the equipment 
is here, you realize that you could start the training now and complete it 
later. By understanding what is driving the timing of the task, you can better 
search for a solution if that timing is causing problems.
How Adding People or Time 
Affects Your Project
It’s part of corporate human nature to want to throw money and people 
at problems; in some cases, that instinct is on target. However, you don’t 
always have the ability to draw on endless supplies of resources or an end-
less amount of time to play with. Because of this, you may have to play 
around with a combination of options that involve time and resources.

299
 Chapter 15: You’re Behind: Now What?
Hurry up!
Saving time in Project means doing things faster or adjusting the timing of 
things to use up slack. You are likely to find that making this adjustment is 
like an intricate puzzle: Correct one thing, and something else pops up to 
cause you aggravation.
To accomplish work faster, you have two options:
 
✓ Get more people to help with tasks that are autoscheduled. Adding 
people adds money, so you may get back on track time-wise — but it will 
cost you.
 
✓ Modify the scope of tasks. Modifying the scope of the task may have an 
effect on its quality. If you do two inspections instead of three or you 
shorten your QA cycle by a week, you may run the risk of other types of 
problems down the road.
Changing the timing of tasks and shifting dependencies use up slack to make 
up for delays but may leave you with no wiggle room. The next time a prob-
lem comes up, you’ll be up against the wall with no slack to save you.
In reality, combining small modifications for both time and money is often 
what helps you save the day.
Throwing people at the problem
With effort-driven autoscheduled tasks, things get accomplished when the 
specified amount of effort is expended. So, a task with a duration of 3 days 
based on the Standard calendar requires 3 days × 8 hours per day to be com-
pleted (a total of 24 hours of effort). One resource performing this task work-
ing full time takes three days to complete it; three resources working full time 
take one day to complete 24 hours of work. When you add resources to such 
a task, Project automatically recalculates its duration.
 
If you want Project to reduce the duration of a task when you assign more 
work resources to it, the task must be autoscheduled and have effort-driven 
scheduling turned on, as well.
Changing how resources are assigned
Beyond simply adding resources to a task, you can also make modifications 
to existing assignments. On any given project, you may have dozens (or 
even hundreds) of resources working on tasks. All those people are working 

300
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
according to their working calendars, the percentage of resource time you 
assigned to particular tasks, and their ability to do the job. Take a look at 
how you assigned folks to begin with to see whether you could save some 
time or money by modifying those assignments.
You can modify assignments in several ways:
 
✓ If someone is working at, say, only 50 percent capacity on a task, con-
sider upping the person’s assignment units.
 
✓ If you have someone available who could perform a given task more 
quickly, switch resources on a task and then shorten its duration. 
Remember, the new Team Planner view can be helpful when making 
these types of switches.
 
✓ Consider having some people work overtime or be overbooked at vari-
ous points during the project. You may have modified an overbooked 
resource’s assignments earlier to get rid of a conflict, but now you find 
that there’s no choice but to have the resource work that occasional 12- 
or 14-hour day!
Remembering the consequences
Before you get carried away making changes to resources, think a minute. 
Adding resources to effort-driven autoscheduled tasks can shrink them, help-
ing your project get back on track. However, depending on the resources’ 
hourly rates, this approach may cost you more.
Remember that three people working on a task won’t necessarily geometri-
cally shrink the duration of the task. That’s because three people have to 
coordinate their efforts, hold meetings, and generally do the things people 
do when they interact that make their work a tad less efficient than when 
they work alone. If you add resources, Project shrinks the task geometrically: 
Consider going in and adding a little time to the task to accommodate the 
inefficiencies of multiple resources.
The other concern about adding resources to tasks is that it could cause 
more resource conflicts, with already-busy people getting overbooked on too 
many tasks that happen in the same time frame. If you have the resources 
and they have the skills and the time, though, beefing up the workforce is 
definitely one way to perform some tasks more quickly.

301
 Chapter 15: You’re Behind: Now What?
 
To add resources to a task, you can use the Resources tab in the Task 
Information dialog box or choose the task and click the Assign Resources 
button on the Resource tab of the Ribbon.
Shifting dependencies and task timing
Time is a project manager’s greatest enemy. There’s never enough time, and 
what time there is gets eaten up like a bag of chips in a room full of hungry 
Little Leaguers.
Here are some ways you can modify task timing to save time:
 
✓ Delete a task. You heard me. If a task represents a step that could be 
skipped and there’s no actual work tracked for it, just get rid of it. This 
doesn’t happen often, but sometimes — on rethinking your project — you 
realize that a few things aren’t necessary or have already been handled by 
someone else. If you’re using Project Professional, you also can mark the 
task as inactive. 
 
✓ Adjust dependencies. Couldn’t the revision of the manual start a few 
days before all the feedback comes back? Could the electrical and 
plumbing go on at the same time instead of one after the other (assum-
ing that the electrician and the plumber can stay out of each other’s 
way)? Use the Predecessors tab of the Task Information dialog box 
shown in Figure 15-6 to modify dependencies. In the Lag column, you 
can enter a negative number to allow tasks to overlap.
 
Figure 15-6: 
Review 
a task’s 
dependen-
cies here 
and modify 
lag to allow 
tasks to 
overlap.
 

302
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
✓ Modify constraints. Perhaps you set a task to start no earlier than the 
first of the year because you don’t want to spend money on it until the 
new fiscal year budget kicks in. To save time, consider whether you 
could allow it to start a week before the end of the year but bill the costs 
in January. Examine any constraints such as this — specifically, those 
created to verify the timing logic.
 
✓ Check external dependencies. If you’ve created an external link to a 
task in another project and set dependencies with tasks in your proj-
ect, check with the other project manager to see whether he or she can 
hurry up some tasks. Or, if the timing relationship isn’t absolutely criti-
cal, delete the link to the other project. It could be slowing you down 
more than you realize.
 
✓ Change the scheduling method or move the task. Remember that 
Project usually cannot automatically reschedule a task based on depen-
dency changes if the task is manually scheduled. You can either change 
the task to be autoscheduled using the Auto Schedule button in the 
Tasks group of the Task tab on the Ribbon, or you can select a manually 
scheduled task and then click the Respect Links button in the Schedule 
group of the Task tab to move it to its proper time frame. Or, you can 
use the Move drop-down list on the Task tab to reschedule a task to a 
particular earlier or future time, or to a time when resources are 
available.
 
If you’ve set resource leveling to automatic, Project may have delayed some 
tasks until overbooked resources are freed up. Choose Resource➪Leveling 
Options and change the setting to Manual.
When All Else Fails
Okay. You’ve monkeyed with resource assignments and shifted task depen-
dencies around to save time, and deleted tasks and assigned cheaper work-
ers to save money. Still, it’s not enough. This is the scenario where you have 
to say to your boss, “You can have it on time, you can have it on budget, or 
you can have quality work: Choose two.”
 
If your boss throws money at you, go ahead and add resources to tasks, as 
discussed in the earlier section “Throwing people at the problem.” If she opts 
for time or quality, read on.

303
 Chapter 15: You’re Behind: Now What?
All the time in the world
If your boss is willing to give you more time, grab it. When you do, you have 
to update your project in a few ways:
 
✓ Add to slack. If you have a Slack task, you can simply add to its dura-
tion, giving more waffle room to all other tasks. (See Chapter 10 for more 
about slack.)
 
✓ Modify task durations. Take tasks that are running late and give them 
more time to be accomplished. In Project, this means increasing their 
durations or pushing out their start dates to a later time.
 
✓ Review your task constraints. If you specified that some tasks couldn’t 
finish any later than a certain date but now you’re moving your project 
finish date out three months, you may be able to remove or adjust those 
original constraints accordingly.
After you work in the extra time provided to you, make sure that the new 
timing of tasks doesn’t cause new resource conflicts, review Resource Graph 
view, and then reset your baseline to reflect the new schedule. You reset 
a baseline by choosing Project➪Set Baseline➪Set Baseline. When asked 
whether you’re sure that you want to overwrite the existing baseline, reply 
Yes. Or, choose Baseline 1-10 in the Save Baseline dialog box to save to a dif-
ferent baseline and preserve the original.
 
Don’t forget to inform your team members of the new timing and provide them 
with an updated version of your plan. You can do that easily using Project 
Web App, which I discuss in Chapters 18 and 19.
And now for something 
completely different
If your manager tells you to cut some corners and sacrifice quality, you have 
license to modify the scope of the project. You can cut out some tasks that 
may ensure higher quality, such as a final proofreading of the employee 
manual. You can hire cheaper workers. You can use cheaper paper or com-
puter equipment.
In Project, this means you have to do the following:
 
✓ Take less steps: Delete tasks. (Click the ID of the task in Gantt Chart

Professional.

✓ Use less expensive resources: Delete one set of resource assignments 
and assign other resources to tasks in the Assign Resources dialog box.
 
✓ Use less expensive materials: Change the unit price for material 
resources you’ve created in Resource Sheet view, as shown in Figure 
15-7. Or, shop around for better pricing on items that are set up as cost 
resources, and enter the lower prices for tasks to which you’ve assigned 
those resources using the Cost column of the Assign Resources dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 15-8.
You can also take a more sweeping approach: Just redefine the goal of the 
project. If your goal was to launch a new product line, perhaps you can 
modify your goal to simply manage the design of the new product and then 
leave the launch to a later date or another project manager. If you were sup-
posed to produce 10,000 widgets, could your company get along with 7,500? 
To make such changes, you may have to slice and dice entire phases of your 
project — or even start from scratch and build a new plan.

Consider saving your revised project plan with a new name to give you a head 
start. Clear the baseline (choose Project➪Set Baseline➪Clear Baseline), make 
your modifications, and then save a new baseline.
What Does Project Have 
to Say about This?
One final word of caution: When you take certain steps, such as deleting 
tasks or modifying dependency relationships, your action may just cause 
Project to alert you to a potential problem you hadn’t thought of. If that hap-
pens, Project shows you a Planning Wizard dialog box like the one shown in 
Figure 15-9. If you make changes on your own instead of using the Planning 
Wizard, you may be more apt to back yourself into a problem situation.

task takes

These dialog boxes offer you options — typically to go ahead and proceed, to 
cancel, or to proceed but with some modification. Read these alerts carefully 
and consider the pros and cons of what will happen if you proceed.

H
ere it is. The big payoff. The reward you get for inputting all those task 
names, entering all those resource hourly rates, and tracking activity 
on dozens of tasks during those late-hour sessions in the first hectic weeks of 
your project. You finally get to print a report or other data, getting something 
tangible out of Project that you can hand out at meetings and use to impress 
your boss.
Reports help you communicate about your project, conveying information 
about the schedule, resource assignments, how costs are accumulating, and 
what activities are in progress or coming up soon. You can take advantage 
of built-in reports or customize those reports to include the data that’s most 
relevant to you. Project 2010 includes Visual Reports, which offers graphic 
possibilities to help paint a picture of your progress. Other features, such 
as the ability to customize and copy Timeline view and other features in the 
project, enable you to incorporate Project data in reports in other programs.
Knowing that you’ll want to impress people, Project also makes it possible to 
apply certain formatting settings to reports and to add drawings to help get 
your point across.

Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Off the Rack: Standard Reports
Standard reports are already designed for you, offering a lot of choices 
regarding the information you can include. You don’t have to do much more 
than click a few buttons to generate them. Essentially, you select a category 
of report, choose a specific report, and print it. If the plain-vanilla version of a 
report isn’t quite right, you can modify standard reports in a variety of ways.
 
You can also print any view in Project; just display the view and click the Print 
button. The entire project is printed in whatever view you have on-screen at 
the time. Or, you can choose File➪Print. In the Print dialog box that appears, 
you can choose to print only certain pages of your project or only a specific 
date range from the timescale. Any filters or grouping that you’ve applied 
shows in the printed document.
What’s available
Project has five categories of standard reports: Overview, Current, Costs, 
Assignments, and Workload. Each category contains several predesigned 
reports (as you can see in the Overview Reports dialog box, shown in Figure 
16-1), for a total of 22 standard reports.
 
Figure 16-1: 
From the 
Overview 
category, 
you can 
choose 
one of five 
reports.
 
Standard reports vary in content, format (for example, a table versus a 
columnar report), and sometimes page orientation (landscape or portrait). 
You can edit each report to change its name, the time period it covers, the 
table of information that it’s based on, and filters applied to it. You can also 
sort information as you generate the report and add formatting, such as bor-
ders or gridlines.

309
 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
Going with the standard
Any of the standard reports are simplicity itself. You could practically create 
one in your sleep.
 
Better yet, you could create a macro to generate your reports with a single-
keystroke shortcut (read more about macros in Chapter 17).
Follow these steps to generate any standard report:
 
1. Choose Project➪Reports.
 
 The Reports dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-2. All five catego-
ries of reports, plus a custom report category, are accessible through 
the Reports dialog box.
 
Figure 16-2: 
Choose a 
report style 
here.
 
 
2. Click the category of standard report you want, and then click the 
Select button.
 
 A dialog box named after the category of report you selected appears 
(refer to Figure 16-1).
 
3. Click one of the standard reports shown here, and then click the 
Select button.
 
 A preview of the report, like the one of Unstarted Tasks shown in Figure 
16-3, appears on Backstage view.
 
4. To print, click the large Print button above the print options in the 
center of the window.
 
 You can also click Page Setup to change page settings or use the choices 
under Settings to change how your report previews.

310
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
Figure 16-3: 
Click the 
report 
preview to 
zoom in so 
that you 
can read its 
details.
 
 
Clicking another tab returns you to the previous view. You have to start all 
over again if you do this.
When you click Print, an additional dialog box appears for some reports, 
asking for a date range or other data specific to that report.
A standard report, with a twist
Some people are happy with the cookie-cutter standard reports that Project 
provides; others like to add their own spin to their reports. That’s okay 
because even though standard reports are prebuilt, you can still get under 
the hood and tinker a little.
You can edit three categories of modifications for a standard report:
 
✓ Definition: This includes the report name, the time period, the table 
of information, any filters applied, and whether summary tasks should 
appear.
 
✓ Details: Details can be included for tasks (such as notes or predeces-
sors) and for resource assignments (such as notes or cost). You can also 
choose to show totals and add a border around the report or gridlines 
between details.

311
 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
 
✓ Sort: You can sort by up to three criteria in ascending or descending 
order.
When modifying standard reports to create a custom report, you’ll encoun-
ter some variations. For example, when you try to edit a Project Summary 
report, all you get is a text formatting dialog box. However, the majority of 
reports are edited through one dialog box, as shown in the procedure that 
follows.
To edit a standard report, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Project➪Reports.
 
 The Reports dialog box appears.
 
2. Click Custom and then click Select.
 
3. Click a specific report and then click Copy.
 
 Depending on the type of report you chose, the Resource Report, Task 
Report, or Crosstab Report dialog box appears. The settings in these 
dialog boxes are the same except for some default choices (for example, 
which filter is applied). Figure 16-4 shows a Task Report dialog box.
 
Figure 16-4: 
You can 
make three 
tabs’ worth 
of settings.
 
 
4. Click the Definition tab, if it’s not already displayed, and make your 
selections:
 
a. Select the contents of the Name field and type a name for the new 
report.
 
b. In the Period box, choose the period of time you want the report to 
reflect.
 
 If you choose an increment of time from the Period field, such as 
week (rather than choosing Entire Project), you can set the Count 
counter to reflect the number of increments. For example, you 
may set Count to 3 for three weeks, which provides a report on the 
project covering data in three-week increments.

312
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
c. If you’d like a different table of information to be included, make a 
choice from the Table field.
 
 If you don’t change this setting, the table currently displayed in the 
project is used.
 
d. If you want to apply a filter to tasks, choose one from the Filter field.
 
 To highlight tasks that match the filter’s criteria, rather than 
simply exclude those tasks that don’t meet the criteria from the 
report, select the Highlight check box.
 
5. Click the Details tab (as shown in Figure 16-5) and make your 
selections:
 
a. Select various check boxes to include different types of information, 
such as task notes or resource assignment costs.
 
b. If you want a border around these elements, select the Border around 
Details check box.
 
c. If you want gridlines in the report, select the Gridlines between 
Details check box.
 
 This gives your report more of the appearance of a table.
 
d. To include totals of dollar amounts or hours, select Show Totals. If 
you use a currency other than dollars, you can set that by choosing 
Tools➪Options and setting the currency on the View tab.
 
Figure 16-5: 
Some 
of these 
options may 
be selected 
already, 
depending 
on the 
standard 
report 
you’re 
editing. 
 
6. Click the Sort tab and make your selections:
 
a. In the Sort By field, click a sort criterion, and then select either 
Ascending or Descending to choose a sort order.
 
b. If you want to sort by additional criteria, repeat Step 6a with the Then 
By boxes.

313
 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
 
7. Click the OK button to save your settings.
 
8. In the Reports dialog box, click the Select button to generate the 
report preview.
 
You can find more details about sorting in Chapter 15.
Crosstabs: A different animal
Crosstab reports present slightly different settings when you edit them. 
Figure 16-6 shows the Definition tab of the Crosstab Report dialog box. A 
crosstab report tabulates a unique piece of data relative to column and row 
definitions. Essentially, the cell formed by the column and row intersection 
represents the unique data.
 
Figure 16-6: 
Here you 
have to 
choose 
which three 
elements 
define the 
crosstab.
 
For example, you may have columns that list days and rows that list 
resources. The piece of information where the column and row intersects is 
resource work on a particular day. The report shows the hours of work by 
each resource day by day.
When you edit a crosstab, you define the column, the row, and the piece of 
data being compared. On the Details tab of the Crosstab Report dialog box, 
you can make settings such as whether to include row or column totals, to 
insert gridlines, and to display values of 0.
A Custom Job
Not impressed with the standard reports? Or perhaps none of those reports 
quite fits your information needs? That’s okay. You can create as many 
custom reports as your heart desires.

314
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
A custom report starts with a report type, which can be task, resource, 
monthly calendar, or crosstab. After you choose that basic category, you 
simply work with the same Reports dialog box that you use to edit a standard 
report.
Follow these steps to create a custom report:
 
1. Choose Project➪Reports.
 
 The Reports dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Custom category and then click Select.
 
 The Custom Reports dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-7. You 
have two options: Edit an existing report or create a new custom report.
 
Figure 16-7: 
The Custom 
Reports 
dialog box 
lets you 
start with an 
existing set 
of data.
 
 
3. Decide whether you want to base your custom report on an existing 
report or create a new report, and proceed accordingly:
 
a. If you want to base your custom report on an existing report: Choose 
a report in the Reports list and then click the Copy button.
 
b. If you want to create a report that’s not based on any other report: 
Click the New button, click one of the categories in the dialog box 
that appears, and then click the OK button.
 
4. In the Report dialog box, make choices to define your new report and 
then click the OK button.
 
 The choices in this dialog box are discussed in detail in the section “A 
standard report, with a twist,” earlier in this chapter.
 
If you create a custom report based on an existing report, be sure to give it a 
unique name.

 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
Get a New Perspective on 
Data with Visual Reports
If you just love the capabilities that PivotTable reports in Excel and Visio 
offer, you’ll be glad to know that the same capability has come to Project 
2010 in the form of Visual Reports. Pivot tables allow you to view data from a 
variety of perspectives beyond the Project standard report capabilities. Pivot 
tables offer perspectives that are especially useful for data analysis.
The Visual Reports feature allows you to select the fields you want to view 
and to modify your reports on the fly.
Getting an overview of what’s available
Project offers six categories of Visual Reports as well as custom reports that 
you can build yourself. Some are based on timephased data (data distributed 
over time, such as allocations of resource time or costs), and some aren’t. 
The report categories include
 
✓ Task Usage: Based on timephased data for tasks, this category of 
reports gives you a peek at information such as cash flow and earned 
value over time.
 
✓ Resource Usage: Based on timephased resource data, these reports 
include cash flow, resource availability, resource costs, and resource 
work data.
 
✓ Assignment Usage: Also based on timephased data, this category of 
reports provides information in areas such as baseline versus actual 
costs and baseline versus actual work.
 
✓ Task Summary, Resource Summary, and Assignment Summary: These 
three categories of reports provide diagram views of a variety of work 
and cost data. These three categories are not based on timephased data.
Creating a Visual Report
Generating a Visual Report is simplicity itself: You simply choose a report, 
decide whether you want to generate it in Excel or Visio, and view or print 
the report.

316
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Depending on whether you are running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Office 
and Project, you may need to install other software to get visual reports to 
work. As of this writing, one add on that is required is the Microsoft SQL 
Server 2008 Analysis Services 10.0 OLE DB Provider, a free download from 
www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx. Visit the Microsoft 
Project page at www.office.microsoft.com/project to get more infor-
mation if you hare having trouble using Visual Reports.
 
If you want to customize a Visual Report, you need some knowledge of pivot 
tables in Excel or Visio. Because covering pivot tables in those products is 
beyond the scope of this book, I heartily recommend Excel 2010 For Dummies 
(by Greg Harvey) and Visio 2007 For Dummies (by John Paul Mueller) (both 
published by Wiley).
Follow these steps to generate a standard Visual Report:
 
1. Choose Project➪Visual Reports.
 
 The Visual Reports dialog box appears (see Figure 16-8).
 
2. Use the check boxes in the Show Report Templates Created In area to 
specify whether the dialog box should show reports available in Excel 
or Visio.
 
Figure 16-8: 
The Visual 
Reports 
dialog 
box offers 
several cat-
egories of 
reports.
 

317
 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
 
3. Click a report on the All tab to select it.
 
4. Click the View button.
 
 The report is generated in the selected application (see Figure 16-9).
 
Figure 16-9:

baseline 
costs.
 
 
You can modify the Visual Reports templates or create your own templates 
by using the New Template and Edit Template buttons in the Visual Reports 
dialog box. Editing a template allows you to add or remove fields from it. 
Creating a new template involves specifying the format (Excel or Visio), choos-
ing the data you want to report on, and selecting the fields to include.
Spiffing Things Up
These days, image is everything. You and your project may be judged to 
some extent by how professional your printed information looks. Even if your 
project is a million dollars over budget and four months behind, making your 
reports or other printouts look good can make delivering bad news easier.

318
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
To create impressive documents, make sure that you cross the ts of format-
ting text and dot the is of visual design.
Using graphics in Project
Wouldn’t your company logo look spiffy in the header of your report? Or 
what about including a picture of the new product box in Gantt Chart view of 
your New Product Launch project?
Graphics can add visual information or just plain make your plan look nicer. 
You can insert graphics in your project file by using three methods. You can
 
✓ Cut and paste a graphic from another file. A graphic you cut and paste 
essentially can’t be edited by you in Project.
 
✓ Insert a link to an existing graphics file. Linking keeps your Project file 
smaller.
 
✓ Embed a graphic. Embedding lets you edit the graphic’s contents in 
Project, using the tools of an image program such as Paint.
You can’t add graphics willy-nilly, however. You can add graphics in only a 
few places: the chart pane of any Gantt Chart view, a task note, a resource 
note, or a header, footer, or legend used in reports or printouts of views.
For example, you may put pictures of resources in the resource note field so 
that you can remember who’s who. Or you may include a photo of your cor-
porate headquarters in the header of your report.
 
Remember, graphics swell the size of your Project file like a sponge in a pail 
of water. If you’re thinking of using a lot of graphics, be sure that they don’t 
detract from the main information in your printouts. Or, try linking to them 
instead of inserting them in the file.
If you want to insert an existing graphics file in a notes box, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open the Notes tab of the Task Information or Resource Information 
dialog box.
 
2. Click the Insert Object button.
 
 The Insert Object dialog box (Figure 16-10) or an Insert Picture dialog 
box appears.
 
3. Choose the Create from File option.
 
4. Click the Browse button to locate the file.

319
 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
 
Figure 16-10: 
Browse to 
locate a file 
on a net-
work or your 
hard drive.
 
 
5. To link to the file, select the Link check box and then click the OK 
button.
 
 If you don’t select this option, the object is embedded in your file.
 
6. To insert the object as an icon, select the Display as Icon check box.
 
 When you display the object as an icon, those viewing your project on a 
computer can click the icon to view the picture.
 
7. Click the OK button.
 
 The image appears in the location you selected in Step 1.
If you want to insert an existing graphics file in a header or footer, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open the header or footer tab of Page Setup (see the later section 
“Working with Page Setup”).
 
2. Click the Insert Picture button.
 
 The Insert Picture dialog box appears.
 
3. Navigate to the folder that holds the file to insert.
 
4. Click the file.
 
5. Click the Open button.
 
 The image appears in the header or footer.
If you want to insert a new graphic that you create on the fly into a note 
instead of inserting an existing graphics file, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Insert Object dialog box, select the Create New option.
 
2. From the Object Type list, choose the type of object that you want to 
insert.
 
 For example, you might select Bitmap Image or Microsoft Visio Drawing.

320
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
3. If you want to insert the object as an icon, select the Display as Icon 
check box.
 
 When you display the object as an icon, those viewing your project on a 
computer can click the icon to view the picture.
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 You see a blank object box, along with tools, similar to the one in Paint 
shown in Figure 16-11.
 
Figure 16-11: 
Create a 
graphic 
here.
 
 
5. Use the tools of the program from which you inserted an object to 
make, draw, insert, or format the new graphic object.
 
 When you close this window, you go back to your Project file.
You also can place a graphic object from a compatible program on the Gantt 
chart. To get it done, follow these steps:
 
1. Open or create the graphic in its source program, such as Paint.
 
2. Select the entire object.
 
 You can often press Ctrl+A or use a Select All command to select an 
entire object.
 
3. Copy the selected graphic by pressing Ctrl+C.

321
 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
 
4. Display the Gantt Chart or Tracking Gantt view in Project, and press 
Ctrl+V.
 
 The object is pasted on the chart.
 
5. Drag the object to the desired location and resize it.
 
 You can use the resizing handles that appear to change the object’s 
size or shape. Figure 16-12 shows an example graphic pasted onto the 
Tracking Gantt chart.

Formatting reports
You probably cut your computing teeth by formatting text in word proces-
sors, so formatting reports will be a breeze. You have all the usual formatting 
options available to you whenever you generate a report in Project.
As with any other business document, your goal in formatting text should be 
readability. Remember, in addition to dealing with neat columns of data, you 
also may be dealing with labels of dates or resource names wedged alongside 

322
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
task bars in the chart pane. Keep the following points in mind when format-
ting Project text:
 
✓ Font: Choose simple sans serif fonts, such as Arial.
 
 If you’re publishing your project on the Web, consider using Verdana, 
which is a font created for readability online.
 
✓ Color: Will the printout be in color or black and white? Will the use of 
too many colors become confusing for the reader? Will certain colors, 
such as yellow, be difficult to read?
 
✓ Font size: Use a font size that is readable, without making it so big that 
the task bar labels become too crowded.
 
✓ Effects: Avoid text effects that can make some text difficult to read (such 
as bold, italic, or underlining). Use such effects only to call attention to a 
few elements of your project.
To edit report text, just follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Project➪Reports.
 
 The Reports dialog box appears.
 
2. Click a report category and then click the Select button.
 
3. In the Reports category dialog box that appears, click the specific 
report that you want to generate.
 
4. Click the Edit button.
 
 The specific report dialog box opens. With some reports, the Text Styles 
dialog box opens at this point because you can change no other settings 
in those reports. If this happens, skip Step 5 and proceed with Step 6.
 
5. Click the Text button.
 
 The Report Text dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 16-13.
 
6. In the Item to Change box, click the item that you want to format.
 
7. Make your selections in the Font, Font Style, Size, and Color fields.
 
8. If you want to format another item, select it in the Item to Change box 
and repeat Step 7.
 
9. When you’re finished, click the OK button.
 
10. To view the report in preview, click the Select button.

Call the Printer!
The proof of the report is in the printing, but you should see to several 
adjustments before you click that button to print. With Project, it’s not just 
margins or page orientation that you need to set (although you do have to 
set those, too). You can also put useful information in headers and foot-
ers as well as set legends that help your reader understand the many bars, 
diamonds, and other graphic elements that many Project views and reports 
display.
Working with Page Setup
The Page Setup dialog box can be used to control printouts of both reports 
and any currently displayed Project view. You can get to this dialog box in a 
few different ways:
 
✓ To make settings for printing the current view: Choose File➪Print➪
Page Setup.
 
✓ To modify the page setup for a report: Select Page Setup from the 
Backstage preview of the report. Choose Project➪Reports, double-click 
a report category, and then click a specific report. When you click the 
Select button to generate a specific report, the print preview appears. 
Click the Page Setup link that appears there.
The Page Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-14, contains six tabs. In the 
case of reports, all tabs may not be available to you. For example, reports 

324
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
don’t contain graphic elements such as task bars, so you can’t set a legend 
to appear on them. Also, you have access to the View tab only when you’re 
printing the currently displayed view.
 
Figure 16-14: 
You can 
control 
how your 
document is 
laid out and 
printed.
 
When size is important
The Page tab contains some basic page settings that determine the orienta-
tion, the paper size, and the way the contents are scaled to fit the page. By 
making these settings, you influence how much can fit on each page and how 
many pages long your document will be.
Here are the choices you have on this tab (shown in Figure 16-14):
 
✓ Portrait or Landscape orientation: No doubt you’ve dealt with these 
before. Portrait is set up like the Mona Lisa with the short edge of the 
paper running across the top of the page. Landscape is when the long 
edge of the paper runs across the top instead.
 
✓ Scaling: You can use the Adjust To or Fit To settings. The Adjust To set-
ting is based on a percentage of the original size. The Fit To setting gives 
you some control over scaling to fit to the width of a single page or the 
height of a single page.
 
✓ Other: This area is a catchall for two options: Paper Size and First Page 
Number. All the standard choices for paper size are available in the 
Paper Size list, including index cards and envelopes. First Page Number 
can be left as Auto (in which case the first page is numbered 1, the 
second page is 2, and so on), or you can enter another number there 
yourself.

 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
Keeping things within the margins
I won’t bore you by defining what a margin is. However, I will remind you that 
margins serve the dual purpose of controlling how much information can 
fit on each page and also creating a border of white space that frames your 
document (making it cleaner looking and easier to read).
To set margins using the Page Setup dialog box, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Margins tab, which is shown in Figure 16-15.
 
 As you modify margin settings, the preview shows you where they will 
appear on your page.
 
Figure 16-15: 
Indicate 
margin set-
tings here.
 
 
2. Use the arrows to set the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right margins.
 
 Click the up arrow for a wider margin and the down arrow for a nar-
rower margin.
 
3. If you want a border that represents the margin, use the Borders 
Around options.
 
 Here you can choose to print a border on every page, on only outer 
pages (prints a border on the first and last pages only — available only 
when printing a Network Diagram view), or on none of the pages.
 
Setting margins to be less than 1⁄4 inch (.25") could cause your printed output 
to be cut off because printers can only print just so close to the edge of a 
page.

Putting all the right stuff in headers and footers
Throughout the life of a project, you’ll print many versions of your project, 
many reports, and many types of information using various tables. Headers 
and footers are great features to help you and your readers keep track of all 
this information.
You can use the Header (as shown in Figure 16-16) and Footer tabs of the 
Page Setup dialog box to set and preview header (top) and footer (bottom) 
contents.
 
Figure 16-16: 
The Header 
and Footer 
tabs are 
identical.
 
Here are the settings you can make on these tabs:
 
✓ Text location: Specify that the text you enter is to appear on the left, at 
the center, or to the right of the header or footer by clicking the corre-
sponding tab and then typing the text.
 
✓ Format text: Use the tool buttons, or quickly insert such things as the 
page number, the date, or a picture file.
 
✓ Select standard text: Insert additional text by using the General and 
Project Fields lists. The General list includes such things as Total Page 
Count, Project Title, and Company Name. The Project Fields list includes 
all the fields available in Project. You may use these to alert the reader 
to key fields to review or the nature of the printout. To add General or 
Project Fields items, select them from their respective lists and then 
click the Add button to add them to the Left, Center, or Right tab.
 
After you get familiar with reports, you may discover that some of them omit 
header and footer information that you consider important, such as the name 
of the resource for whom you’re generating a to-do list. Take advantage of 
custom headers and footers whenever you need to fill in that kind of blank.

327
 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
Working with a legend
A legend acts as a guide to the meanings of various graphic elements, as 
shown in Figure 16-17. The Legend tab bears a striking resemblance to the 
Header and Footer tabs, except that the legend is generated automatically, so 
all you can specify here is the text that fits in the box to the left of the legend.
 
Figure 16-17: 
The legend 
is printed 
automati-
cally, but 
you can 
insert infor-
mation in 
the box to 
the left of it.
 
The Legend tab of the Page Setup dialog box has only two settings that differ 
from the Header and Footer tabs:
 
✓ You can print the legend on every page or on a separate legend page, or 
you can decide to not print a legend.
 
✓ You can establish the width of the text area of the legend (the area 
where you can insert elements such as the page number or the date).
 
Unlike a header or footer, where you have to enter something to have any-
thing appear, a legend prints by default. If you don’t want a legend to print, 
click this tab and then set the Legend On option to None.
What to print?
If you’re printing a currently displayed view, the View tab of the Page Setup 
dialog box is available to you, as shown in Figure 16-18.
You can make the following settings here:
 
✓ Print All Sheet Columns: Prints every sheet column in the view, regard-
less of whether it’s currently visible on-screen. With this option not 
selected, only the columns that show in your view will print.
 
✓ Print First # Columns on All Pages: Allows you to control a specific 
number of columns to print.

328
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
✓ Print Notes: Prints every task, resource, and assignment note. These 
items are printed on a separate notes page.
 
✓ Print Blank Pages: Choose this setting if you want to print blank pages. 
For example, use this setting to print a page that represents a time in 
your project when no tasks are occurring. If you want a smaller number 
of pages in your printout, don’t choose this setting.
 
✓ Fit Timescale to End of Page: Scales the timescale to allow you to fit 
more of your project on the page.
 
✓ Print Row Totals for Values within Print Date Range: Adds a column 
that contains row totals. Pertains to printouts of Usage views.
 
✓ Print Column Totals: Adds a column that contains column totals. 
Pertains to printouts of Usage views.

able if 
you’re print-
ing a report.
 
Get a preview
Granted, although software print previews aren’t quite as exciting as movie 
previews, they help you get everything right before you print your project. 
When you choose a report or choose File➪Print to print a view, the preview 
automatically appears in the Backstage. The buttons at the lower-right corner 
of the preview enable you to modify the preview so that you can work with 
the settings more effectively.
You can use the buttons in the Backstage preview to do the following:
 
✓ Move around the pages of the report by using the first four arrow but-
tons, as well as the horizontal and vertical scroll bars.

329
 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
 
✓ View more detail by clicking the Actual Size button and then clicking the 
report.
 
✓ Focus on a single page or all the pages of your report by using the One 
Page and Multiple Pages buttons.
So Let’s Print!
Last but not least, here’s how to actually print that document for which 
you’ve made all the wonderful settings discussed in this chapter. For this, 
you need to deal with the print settings to the left of the preview in the 
Backstage. (See Figure 16-19 for a quick refresher.)
 
Figure 16-19: 
Control the 
printer, the 
number of 
copies, and 
what prints.
 
Here are the settings you encounter in this area:
 
✓ Click the Copies up arrow to print more copies or the down arrow to 
print fewer (but not less than 1).
 
✓ The Printer area of this dialog box indicates the printer you will use. You 
can choose a printer from the list and click the Printer Properties link to 
control printer settings such as color quality and paper source.

330
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
✓ The Settings area allows you to print the entire project or to select 
another option from the drop-down list so that you can print specific 
dates, print specific pages, or print custom dates and pages. The accom-
panying options change depending on your choice. You also can use the 
Settings drop-down list to specify whether to print notes, all sheet col-
umns, or the left column of pages only (to print only the leftmost column 
on every page).
 
✓ The remaining settings are for orientation and paper size, if you didn’t 
make those choices elsewhere.
After you make all your settings and you’re ready to print, just click the big 
Print button in the upper-left corner.

A Project Overview: The Timeline
Chapter 2 introduced you to the new Timeline view that appears by default at 
the top of some of Project’s other views, such as Gantt Chart view. You may 
have been wondering what the heck the Timeline is there for, and how you 
might use it. Here’s the lowdown on it.
Hiding and redisplaying the Timeline
The Timeline gives sort of a 10,000-ft. overview of the project schedule. It 
shows a graphical timeline spanning from the project’s start date to the end 
date, and it highlights the period of time currently shown on the main view, 
such as the specific dates shown on the Gantt chart. You can toggle the 
Timeline on and off as needed. To do so, click the View tab of the Ribbon and 
select the Timeline check box in the Split View group.
Adding tasks
The Timeline can give you even more detail when you add one or more sum-
mary or detail tasks to it. For example, consider that you have a couple of 
tasks assigned to an outside contractor and that you want to show them 

331
 Chapter 16: Spreading the News: Reporting
where their tasks fall in the context of the overall schedule. To do that, add 
the task or tasks to the Timeline. Simply right-click the task and choose Add 
to Timeline.
As shown in Figure 16-20, the current portion of the schedule is highlighted in 
a darker gray, with a schedule bar above it showing the start and finish dates 
for that period. Tasks added to the Timeline appear by default as a bar on the 
Timeline that shows the task name and schedule or a portion thereof.
 
Figure 16-20: 
The 
Timeline 
highlights 
the part of 
the sched-
ule shown 
in the view 
as well as 
added tasks.
 
To remove a task from the Timeline, right-click it on the Timeline and choose 
Remove from Timeline.
Copying the Timeline
Because that vendor you’re trying to coordinate with doesn’t use Project, 
you need to share the graphical Timeline information via another file format. 
Project builds in the special capability to take a snapshot of the Timeline so 
that you can paste it into an e-mail, presentation, or other program such as a 
word processor.

332
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Follow these steps to copy and use the Timeline:
 
1. Right-click the Timeline, choose Copy Timeline, and then click the 
desired format.
 
 The available format choices are For E-Mail, For Presentation, or Full 
Size.
 
2. Create the e-mail message or document where you want to use the 
Timeline image.
 
3. Position the insertion point where you want the Timeline image to 
appear.
 
4. Press Ctrl+V.
 
 The image appears in the message or document, as in the example 
shown in Figure 16-21.
 
Figure 16-21:

ture of the 
Timeline in

ments and

ication.
 
 
If you’re a fan of the Copy Picture feature in Project, it’s still available in 
Project 2010. Select the tasks to copy by dragging over their task IDs. Then 
click the drop-down arrow beside the Copy button in the Clipboard group of 
the Task tab. You can then click Copy Picture from the menu that appears.

Dressing Up Your Input and Output 
with Enhanced Copy and Paste
While it’s long been possible to copy and paste information to and from 
Project and other Office applications, sometimes the results were, well, a 
little messy. Now, copy and paste operations between the applications retain 
much more information. For example, when you copy tasks from Project and 
paste them into Word or Excel, you’ll automatically see outline-level format-
ting and column headings. And, formatting from information copied from 
another application into Project is retained. There’s no need to reinvent the 
wheel every time you need to copy data between apps — that’s a sweet, 
sweet thing.

H
ave you ever finished a project and then wondered how the heck 
everything ended up the way it did? The total budget numbers mysti-
cally appear to be several thousand dollars over estimate, you missed your 
final deadline by three weeks, and somewhere along the line, you lost track of 
three people who were supposed to be working on tasks. But you delivered 
your deliverables (somehow), and you can finally stuff your project file in the 
bottom of your drawer. Or can you?
Don’t think of Microsoft Project as just a giant electronic to-do list; rather, 
it’s a sophisticated tool that’s used to manage your projects. And the logical 
by-product of that management is a fantastic treasure trove of information 
that you can use to become a better Project user — and thus a better project 
manager.
After you send the last memo on your project and accept your last kudos or 
criticism from your boss, take a moment to look over your Project plan one 
more time.
Learning from Your Mistakes
When I teach classes in using project management software, people are often 
a bit overwhelmed at all that a product such as Project can do. They’re reel-
ing from all the data that they have to input as well as all the information 
that Project throws back at them. They can’t see straight for all the views, 
reports, tables, and filters that they can use to access information on their 
projects.

336
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Here’s the secret that I tell them: You won’t understand every nuance of your 
Project plan on your first project. You won’t even uncover all that Project 
can do on your second project. But gradually, as you master the ins and outs 
of Project and understand what you can get out of it, you’ll become better at 
absorbing all that information — and at understanding how it can help you 
avoid mistakes on your future projects.
The best way to gain that benefit is to review every project when it’s finished 
to see what you did right and what you did wrong. Then you can use what 
you discover to do better on your next project.
It was only an estimate
You know what they say: If you don’t study history, you’re doomed to repeat 
it. And repeating mistakes is the last thing you want to do where project man-
agement is concerned.
Consider these strategies to debrief yourself on what happened in your last 
project:
 
✓ Compare your original baseline plan against the final actual activity 
(as shown in Figure 17-1). Even if you created interim or baseline plans 
to adjust for drastic changes, look at the widest gap between what you 
expected to happen in your initial plan and what did happen. This can 
be the best way to see the areas where you tend to underestimate most 
or where changes in the project’s scope caused dramatic changes.
 
✓ Review the notes you made on your tasks to remind yourself of 
changes or problems that came up along the way. Insert the column 
named Notes on your Gantt Chart sheet and read through all the notes 
at one sitting.
 
✓ Note which resources delivered on their promises and which didn’t; if 
you manage some of them, provide them with constructive feedback. 
For those you don’t manage, keep some notes on hand about how well 
or how fast they worked and make future assignments with those notes 
in mind. Also note which outside vendors performed and which didn’t 
(and consider crossing the latter off your vendor list).
 
✓ Assess your own communications to others in saved e-mails or memos. 
Did you give your team enough information to perform effectively? Did you 
keep management informed about changes or problems in a timely way?
 
✓ Assess feedback from your boss, customers, and other stakeholders. 
Did any of the overall constraints, such as the project budget or deliv-
erables, change dramatically during the course of the project? Were the 
“end users” satisfied with the rate at which you completed the project 
and what was ultimately delivered? How effective was your team’s perfor-
mance in their eyes? Would they rely on you to lead such a project again?

Debrief your team
No project is the province of a single person. Even if no one else ever 
touched your Project plan, your team still provided input for that plan 
through the hours of activity they reported and the information they pro-
vided to you during the course of your project.
Consider these suggestions for refining your communications process:
 
✓ Ask people how the process of reporting actual activity worked. Did 
you use e-mail, schedule notes, route files, or use the Project Web App 
tools such as TimeSheet to gather resource information? Should you 
consider taking advantage of all the benefits of online collaboration for 
your next project?
 
✓ Would your team rate your communications as frequent and thorough 
enough? Did you share enough of your project with resources, or did 
you inundate them with too much information? Did you send an entire 
Project file to people regularly when a simple report on a specific aspect 
of the project would have served you and them better? Did your man-
agement team feel that your reporting on the project was sufficient for 
their needs? Should you learn to take more advantage of other software, 
such as Excel and Visio, accessed through Visual Reports?
 
✓ Did you integrate activity on various projects successfully so that 
resources weren’t overbooked or underutilized? If people on your 
team reported conflicts with other projects, consider using some special 
Project tools, such as creating a deliverable-based plan or developing a 
master project, which involves inserting several projects into a master 
plan so that you can link tasks between them and view resource con-
flicts across them.

338
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Comparing Versions of a Project
Some project managers prefer to save new versions of a project plan rather 
than working with interim plans. That approach can work, but it doesn’t 
enable all the project history to be captured in a single project file. No 
matter, Project’s Compare Versions feature enables it to show you the differ-
ences between two Project plan files. Those files can be either two different 
versions of the plan for one project or files for two separate projects that 
happen to be similar.
You can use this method either to review what happened on a completed 
project or to compare similar new projects as you’re building them. This 
feature has been enhanced in Project 2010. The finished comparison report 
shows you the project differences graphically and provides a legend to iden-
tify what the features in the report mean.
To compare two files in Project, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the file that you want to compare.
 
 The file that is active is considered the current project.
 
2. Choose Project➪Compare Projects.
 
 The Compare Project Versions dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-2.
 
3. If the file to compare doesn’t appear in the Compare the Current 
Project (filename) to This Previous drop-down list, use the Brows 
button select the appropriate file.
 
 The file you selected here is considered the previous project.
 
4. To compare tables other than the default tables shown, select the 
appropriate tables from the Task Table and Resource Table drop-
down lists.
 
5. Click the OK button.
 
6. If a message tells you there are too many columns to compare, click 
OK to continue.
 
 Project runs the comparison and displays the comparison report, as 
shown in Figure 17-3. The comparison report appears in the upper pane, 
and the individual project files show up in the two lower panes. The 
legend at the left shows what the symbols in the Indicators column of 
the report mean; for example, the Hire Realtor task (Task 2) has a plus 
indicator, so it appears only in the current project. On the Gantt chart, 
the narrow green bars represent the current project, and the blue bars 
represent the previous project.

7. Click Resource Comparison on the Compare Projects tab.
 
 The Comparison Report pane changes to display resource information.
 
8. Click Close Comparison on the Compare Projects tab.
 
 The comparison report file remains open.
 
9. Click the Close (X) button on the Legend for Comparison Report pane 
to close the pane.
 
10. Save the comparison report file if desired and then close it.
 
 Use the Save button on the Quick Access toolbar and name the file as 
desired.

Select files

here.
 
Debrief yourself?
Don’t forget to sit down and have a good talk 
with yourself about what went on during your 
project. Did your team give you the kind of 
information you needed to operate efficiently, 
or should you lay down more stringent ground 
rules for reporting in the next project? Were 
you swamped with work throughout the project, 
and would it be wise to find someone to make 
updating entries for you the next time around? 
Did management give you information about 
company changes in a timely way so that you 
could make adjustments to keep your project 
on schedule?
It’s often the case that in the heat of the proj-
ect battle, many of us don’t have time to stop 
and change processes or get the help we need. 
Review the notes you kept in the Project notes 
areas to see what types of snafus made you pull 
your hair out. Then institute changes before you 
begin the next project.

Building on Your Success
Although it’s human nature to focus on all the things that went wrong with a 
project, the fact is that you probably did many, many things right. So before 
you start planning your next project, take the good stuff and put it in a place 
where you can find it easily later.
Create a template
One option is to create a template. Templates are simply files that you save 
that contain certain settings. When you open a template, you can save it as a 
Project document with a new name and have all those settings already built in.
Project contains its own templates for common projects (see Chapter 1 for 
more about starting projects based on a template), but you can save any 
of your projects as templates. If you often use the same set of tasks in your 
projects — as people in many industries do — you’ll save yourself the time of 
creating all those tasks again.

341
 Chapter 17: Getting Better All the Time
 
If you work with Project Server and Project Web App on an enterprise level, 
consider adding templates on a global level for use across your company. See 
Chapters 18 and 19 for more about enterprise-level project management.
In addition to any tasks in the project, templates can contain any or all of the 
following information for those tasks:
 
✓ All the information for each baseline
 
✓ Actual values
 
✓ Rates for all resources
 
✓ Fixed costs
 
✓ Notations of tasks that you publish to Microsoft Project Web App
You can save all this information or only selected items. For example, if you 
created a lot of fixed costs (such as equipment) and resources with associ-
ated rates — and you’ll use those in most of your projects — you could save 
a template with only fixed costs and resource rates.
To save a file as a template, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the file you want to save and then choose File➪Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-4.
 
 Microsoft saves templates in a central folder called Templates.
 
Figure 17-4: 
Save a 
file as a 
template.
 

342
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
2. In the Save As Type list, click Project Template.
 
 Project selects the Templates folder as the Save In location, also illus-
trated at the top of Figure 17-4.
 
3. Click the Save button.
 
 The Save As Template dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-5.
 
 Choose which information about values and resource rates will be saved 
with all the tasks in the project in the template.
 
Figure 17-5: 
Save 
values and 
resource 
rates with 
the tasks in 
the project 
in a 
template.
 
 
4. Select the check boxes for the information that you want to have 
saved in the template.
 
5. Click the Save button.
 
 The file is saved in the template format with the MPT extension.
 
When you open a new project and want to use a saved template, click My 
Templates in Backstage view. The New dialog box appears, and any templates 
you’ve saved appear in the list on the Personal Templates tab. Just open the 
template, and then save it as a Project file with a new name.
Master the Organizer
Project has this marvelously flexible nature that allows you to customize 
a lot of things. For example, you can create your own tables of data to dis-
play in views that contain sheet panes. You can also create your own filters, 
reports, and calendars. If you have any kind of a life, you don’t want to spend 
your evenings re-creating all that stuff for your next project. Instead, use the 
Organizer to copy them to other Project files.

343
 Chapter 17: Getting Better All the Time
The Organizer allows you to take information in one file and copy it to 
another file. You can also rename the items. Some of the most commonly 
used types of items you can copy with Organizer include
 
✓ Calendars
 
✓ Forms
 
✓ Tables
 
✓ Reports
 
✓ Views
 
✓ Fields
 
✓ Groups
 
✓ Toolbars
 
✓ Filters
 
If you want a custom item that you’ve created in the current file to be available 
for use in all your Project plan files, use the Organizer to copy the item into 
the global template, Global.MPT. Some items are copied to the Organizer by 
default, but it never hurts to check and make sure something that you want to 
save is saved there.
Follow these steps to use the Organizer:
 
1. Open the project that you want to copy things from and the project 
that you want to copy things to.
 
2. In the file you want to copy to, choose File➪Info.
 
 Backstage view opens, showing overall file choices.
 
3. Click the Organize Global Template button.
 
 The Organizer dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-6.
 
Figure 17-6: 
You have 
nine tabs’ 
worth of 
stuff you 
can copy 
here!
 

344
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
 
4. Click the tab for the type of information you want to copy.
 
5. Choose the fie to copy from in the left [Items] Available In list at lower 
right.
 
 By default, Project selects the Global.MPT template for the list at left 
and the file from which you open the Organizer for the list at right. If 
you want to copy items from another open file, instead, choose it using 
the drop-down list below the right file’s list. (Depending on the tab you 
display, the drop-down list may be called Views Available In, Groups 
Available In, Reports Available In, and so on.)
 
6. Click an item in the list on the right that you want to include in the 
Global.MPT file on the left and then click the Copy button.
 
 The item appears in the list on the left.
 
7. (Optional) To rename a custom item that you’ve created
 
a. Click it and then click the Rename button.
 
b. In the Rename dialog box that appears, enter a new name and then 
click the OK button.
 
8. To copy additional items on the same tab, repeat Step 6.
 
9. To copy an item on a different tab, repeat Steps 4–8.
 
10. When you finish copying items from one file to another, click the 
Close (X) button in the upper-right corner.
 
 It’s not a good practice to rename default items in the Organizer. This 
can cause errors and malfunctions, such as the inability to display a par-
ticular view.
 
 All the items are copied, and the Organizer dialog box closes.
Handy little timesavers: Macros
If you were paying attention, you noticed a lot of activities in your project 
that you did again, and again, and again. No, I’m not talking about all those 
cups of coffee you downed in the wee hours. I’m talking about things such as 
generating a weekly report or inserting your five department projects into a 
single master schedule, once every quarter, to review resource allocations.
You don’t have to reinvent the wheel to perform actions such as these. 
Instead, you can create a macro — a combination of keystrokes, text entries, 
and so on that you can record and play back anytime you like.

345
 Chapter 17: Getting Better All the Time
For example, suppose that you generate and print a report on current activi-
ties every week. Doing so requires the following keystrokes and entries:
 
1. Choose Project➪Reports.
 
2. Click Cost.
 
3. Click Select.
 
4. Click Overbudget Tasks.
 
5. Click Select.
 
6. Click the File tab.
 
7. Click Print to display the print choices in Backstage view.
 
8. Click Print to print the report.
Time after time, you have to go through an eight-step process. But after these 
steps are recorded, that process is reduced to one step when you play back 
the macro:
 
1. Start your macro.
 
One great use I’ve seen for macros is to copy a range of tasks that is repeated 
numerous times in my project — for example, a Q&A procedure that’s repeated 
ten times throughout a project. In recording the macro, just select the absolute 
range and copy it, and go to the first blank task and paste it, ten times. While the 
macro’s running, you can go get yourself another cup of coffee.
Displaying the Developer tab
The tools for working with macros appear on a Ribbon tab that doesn’t nor-
mally appear: the Developer tab. Use Project’s options, accessible via the 
Outspace, to show and hide this tab as needed.
Here’s how you display (or hide) the Developer tab:
 
1. Choose File➪Options.
 
 The Project Options dialog box appears.
 
2. Choose Customize Ribbon in the list at the left.
 
 The Customize the Ribbon options appear.
 
3. Select the Developer check box in the Main tabs list at the right (see 
Figure 17-7).
 
 When the box is selected, the Developer tab appears in Project. Coming 
back and deselecting the check box hides the Developer tab.
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 The Developer tab appears (or is hidden) as specified.

Recording a macro
Recording a macro is a simple process: You just start recording, do what-
ever you usually do to perform the action, and then stop recording. You 
run macros by selecting them from a list of macros or by using a keystroke 
shortcut. You can also edit them if you need a slightly different series of key-
strokes for a slightly altered sequence of steps.
Here’s how you record a macro:
 
1. Choose Developer➪Record Macro.
 
 The Record Macro dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-8. Macros 
that you record can be played back by using a shortcut key that you 
designate here.
 
2. In the Macro Name box, type a name.
 
 Make the name descriptive of what the macro does.
 
3. In the Shortcut Key box, type a letter (numbers or symbols don’t 
work).
 
 When you press Ctrl plus that key, the macro plays back.

347
 Chapter 17: Getting Better All the Time
 
Figure 17-8: 
Designate a 
shortcut 
key here.
 
 
4. If you like, edit or add to the description of the macro.
 
 This is especially useful if you think others will use it.
 
5. Select whether row and column references will be relative or 
absolute:
 
• Relative references: If you select (say) the task in the third row dis-
played in a sheet and perform an action on it, Project selects the 
task in the third row whenever you run the macro.
 
• Absolute references: Project selects a specific, named task, no 
matter what row it occupies.
 
6. Click the OK button to begin recording.
 
 Every mouse selection or keystroke that you make during this time 
becomes part of the macro.
 
7. After you complete your steps, choose Developer➪Stop Recording.
 
Here are some points to keep in mind about recording macros:
 
✓ Naming: Macro names have to start with a letter and can’t contain 
spaces. Use the underscore to separate words in a macro name 
(Overbudget_Report, for example).
 
✓ Keystroke presets: Several keystroke shortcuts are already reserved 
by Project for use with built-in functions. For example, pressing Ctrl+K 
inserts a hyperlink. Project displays a message that tells you this if you 
choose such a shortcut and then gives you an opportunity to choose 
another letter or number.
 
✓ Entering unique information: If what you record includes entering 
specific information (such as a name or a date range), you’re presented 
with a prompt box into which you enter new information when you run 
the macro — even if you entered information while recording the macro.

348
Part IV: Avoiding Disaster: Staying on Track 
Running and editing macros
To run a macro, your best bet is to use the shortcut key that you entered 
when you created it. (See the preceding section.) This two-keystroke combi-
nation runs the macro, pausing for you to fill in any requested information.
Alternatively, you can do the following:
 
1. Choose Developer➪View Macros.
 
2. Choose a macro in the list of macros shown in the Macros dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 17-9.
 
Figure 17-9: 
The Macros 
dialog box 
lists all 
available 
macros in 
any open 
projects.
 
 
3. Click the Run button.
To edit a macro, you may want to simply rerecord it, which is sometimes the 
quickest way to do it. If you prefer to edit it instead, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Developer➪View Macros.
 
2. In the Macros dialog box that appears, choose the macro that you 
want to modify and then click the Edit button.
 
 The Microsoft Visual Basic editor opens; your macro is displayed in 
Visual Basic code, as shown in Figure 17-10. Visual Basic code uses cer-
tain syntax to code keystrokes and text entry.
 
• To edit the code:
 
 You can edit this code just as you edit text in a word processor–
generated document. Although you have to be familiar with 
the Visual Basic for Applications programming language to 
make most changes, you can make some edits without being a 

349
 Chapter 17: Getting Better All the Time
programmer. For example, any items in quotes are text entries 
or names of things, such as reports. For example, it’s pretty easy 
to change a macro that generates the report named “Tasks 
Starting Soon” so that it generates the report “Tasks in 
Progress”. Just replace the existing report name (within the 
quotation marks) with the new report name.
 
• To delete something within the code:
 
 If you want to delete a piece of the process, you can usually figure 
that out from the code. For example, if you see the line If proj-
ect is empty, alert the user and end the macro and 
you don’t want the macro to include that step, just select it and 
press Delete.
 
Monkeying around with Visual Basic for anything much more complex could 
mess up your macro. Because I don’t want to write another book on Visual 
Basic at this point, I suggest that you keep your life and mine simple: Delete 
the first macro and walk through the procedure again, rerecording it as a new 
macro.

macro here.

Working with 
Enterprise Projects

In this part . . .
H
ere’s where Project Professional comes into its 
own: Serving the enterprise via Project Server and 
Project Web Application, you can get some serious online 
collaboration going. You can share documents online with 
your team, get perspective on your organization’s 
resource pool to make efficient assignments, and get your 
human resources to report their work time. This part 
gives you a glimpse of what Project Server and Project 
Web Application can do if your organization decides to go 
the enterprise route with Project, and it also covers how 
to publish and sync information with SharePoint Server.

Chapter 18
Project Web App for the 
Project Manager
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding Project Server and Project Web App
▶ Looking at the tools Project Web App makes available to you
▶ Reviewing resource availability and assignments
▶ Building a team of resources in the Resource Center
▶ Requesting status reports from Project team members
▶ Sharing documents with your team
I
f you think that Project Server is like an add-on applet (a tiny application) 
that works with Project, you’re wrong. It’s actually a full-fledged software 
product that enables you to take your project — and all its accompanying 
resources, tracking, and reporting — into the world of the Internet.
Project Server comprises two main components: the Project Server that 
manages project data and Project Web App (also called Project Web 
Application), the browser-like interface that connects you and others to 
the project information.
Note: To make life simple, I mostly simply refer to Project Web App going 
forward because that’s the interface and set of tools you’ll be working with. 
However, Project Web App is useless without Project Server: Before you can 
actually perform the steps in this chapter and use Project Web App, some-
body must install Project Server on your company network and configure it 
for your company’s standards and requirements. This usually requires that 
IT-type people stay up nights installing and configuring software and that 
another team of people design the implementation. After all that is accom-
plished, you can actually perform the steps listed here and not just read 
about them. Also note that Project Web App used to be called Project Web 
Access, and depending on how your company’s environment is ultimately set 
up, your screens may look slightly different than the ones in this chapter and 
the next and may still read Project Web Access.

354
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
With Project Web App (which works only with the Professional edition of 
Microsoft Project), you can enhance communications, interactions, and 
documentation for each and every project you undertake. This chapter looks 
at who should use Project Web App as well as how it can help any project 
manager.
Figuring Out Whether Project 
Server Is for You
Just as you don’t need a Hummer to run to the corner grocery store for milk 
once a week, Project Server and Project Web App can be too high-powered 
a solution for some organizations. Implementing Project Server and Project 
Web App involves not only money for product licenses but also requires 
some other specific commitments:
 
✓ The need for project managers to be using the more expensive 
Professional edition of Project (Project Standard cannot connect to 
Project Server)
 
✓ Time to install and configure it
 
✓ Effort to standardize how Project is used across your organization
 
✓ Time and money to train people to use the tools
 
✓ Ongoing maintenance of the Project Server database
Therefore, before you jump in with both feet to the Project Server world, you 
should be sure that the benefits of using it outweigh the effort required.
Project Server is useful to organizations that have an enterprise orientation, 
which means that they make the effort to centralize information online in some 
fashion so that it’s standardized and available throughout the company.
Typically, this scenario is worthwhile for mid- to large-sized companies that 
manage several projects at once across departments or disciplines. The fea-
tures accessed through Project Web App provide the managers of these com-
panies with a way to orchestrate resources more efficiently and also get a 
broad perspective on the efficiency and success of their project management 
efforts across the organization.
 
If you have Project Professional 2010 and your organization has a SharePoint 
Server (or SharePoint Server access), you can take advantage of some proj-
ect collaboration without using Project Server and Project Web App. Project 
Professional 2010 enables you to publish a project task list to SharePoint 
Server. Resources can provide their task updates via the SharePoint location, 
and then you can sync those changes back into your project plan. You also 

355
 Chapter 18: Project Web App for the Project Manager
can publish the entire project file to SharePoint to make it available to other 
users. If a project plan has already been sketched out as a SharePoint task 
list, you can import that list and use it to create a new project plan file. The 
benefits of using a Project Server and Project Web App solution include the 
following:
 
✓ Standard formats, reports, and resource information that can be 
accessed and shared by all project managers for consistency among 
multiple projects
 
✓ The ability to see, on an enterprise-wide level, how resources are being 
allocated so that you can assign resources with an eye to the big picture
 
✓ A perspective on all the projects in the company, which can help man-
agement prioritize and strategize overall enterprise efforts
 
✓ A greater capability to collaborate among projects
 
✓ The ability to make all project information for the company available 
online through a company intranet
 
✓ The ability to take advantage of SharePoint functionality to monitor and 
communicate information about a project’s workflow for its entire life 
cycle, if your organization requires a workflow orientation
 
✓ More efficient methods for resources to track their time on project tasks 
without requiring anyone to reenter the information in Project
If you have a company LAN or intranet, you can set up Project Server and 
Project Web App to deliver all these benefits and more.
 
Not every member of your team has to have Project installed to interact with 
projects on Project Server. Team members only need access to your LAN or 
intranet, access to Project Web App, and appropriate network permissions.
The downsides to Project Server with Project Web App include the following:
 
✓ The cost for licenses
 
✓ The time to install and maintain the server as well as to train users
 
✓ The need for all project managers and team members to agree to and 
adhere to a particular process and procedures before committing to 
Project Server
 
✓ The need to ensure that projects are handled in a uniform way across 
your enterprise (If you don’t do this, the information you receive 
through Project Server may be inaccurate and out of date.)
 
If your most tech-savvy person whom you will call on to install and configure 
Project Server needs some help, I recommend that you take a look at Microsoft 
Project 2010 Bible (published by Wiley). Author Elaine Marmel does a stellar 
job of walking you through Project Server issues (which I say not because 
she’s a friend or a fellow Wiley author, but because she’s just plain good!).

356
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
Getting a Handle on What You Can Do 
with Project Server and Project Web App
Way back when the Internet didn’t exist, companies had to share informa-
tion by passing around memos. The guy in Manufacturing had no idea what 
the people in Sales were up to until a handwritten purchase order was hand-
delivered to his desk and he realized that he didn’t have enough products on 
hand to fill the order.
Computer networks and the Internet changed all that. Suddenly, information 
could be shared in centralized online repositories. People could communicate 
instantly through e-mail. An action in one part of the company could instantly 
be seen in another, and that group could respond and act accordingly.
In a sense, Project Web App is to Project what the Internet is to stan-
dard business operations. Project Web App works with Microsoft Project 
Professional to provide the centralized information and communications that 
can keep projects on track in our I-need-it-now world.
Project Web App gives you an online Project Center that can be used by 
people in your project to
 
✓ Stay ahead of the curve, by viewing daily tasks and requests on the 
Project Web App Home page, as shown in Figure 18-1.
 
✓ Communicate online, exchanging updates on progress and sending sug-
gested new tasks to project managers.
 
✓ Make, view, and accept or decline task assignments from a standard-
ized resource pool.
 
✓ Update activity on tasks by using a timesheet interface (as shown in 
Figure 18-2).
 
✓ Send and request status reports and review project information.
 
✓ Manage project documents, creating and comparing multiple versions 
of projects and setting up document libraries.
 
✓ Attach important documents to a project. For example, you might 
include a goal statement or Excel budget file with your project for others 
to view online.
 
✓ Create and refine draft projects. This feature allows you to begin to 
build your project ideas before you’re ready to commit the time to build-
ing a full-blown project plan. Team members can also submit project 
proposals, which are a different feature that can be used by team mem-
bers as well as project managers.

Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
Planning to Use Project Server 
and Project Web App
Before your administrator begins to install Project Server, you have to sit 
down and do some thinking about how you’ll use it in your organization. 
During the installation process, you have to make some design choices based 
on how you want to use the product.
 
Tools for using Project Professional become available to you when Project 
Server is installed and you have set up your Project Server account in Project. 
This enables you to perform some of your work right from your copy of Project 
Professional. For example, you can create, manage, and sync deliverables using 
a tool that becomes available in the Insert group of the Task tab on the Ribbon.
Get a team together
First figure out who at your organization should be part of this process. For 
example, you’ll probably need senior management input, end user (the people 
on your project teams) input, the experience and expertise of all the project 
managers in your company who use the enterprise features, and somebody 
(or three or four somebodies) from your IT department who actually have to 
set the thing up.
As with most network-oriented computing, everybody has a role to play and 
has to be set up to use features on the network based on that role. Project 
Server provides a user model with three types of participants, providing vari-
ous information and access requirements accordingly:
 
✓ Managers, who oversee the day-to-day operations of a project
 
✓ Team members, who perform the work on the project
 
✓ Executives, such as clients, senior management, and other stakeholders 
who require regular updating on project progress, often across several 
projects in an organization
You should analyze how these roles relate to the functions in your project 
teams and work with your IT folks to set up Project Server permissions 
accordingly.
Gather information
Next, set up a process to research and come to an agreement on all the 
enterprise-wide information you need to enter into Project Server, such as 

359
 Chapter 18: Project Web App for the Project Manager
resources, their rates, and their calendars of availability; WBS (work break-
down structure) code structure; standard report formats; custom fields you’d 
like to include in the Project Server Enterprise Global Template (kind of like 
the Global Template in Project 2010, but available online); and filters, views, 
tables, and so on.
The key word in this planning process is standardization. By standardiz-
ing the information in your projects and making that information available 
online, you increase efficiency in building projects and provide mechanisms 
for comparing projects in an apples-to-apples way.
Standardize processes
Pay special attention to the reporting process that different people use on 
their projects. Standardizing reporting processes and formats ensures that 
those who read reports about multiple projects can easily and quickly under-
stand what they’re looking at. Also, determine how project performance will 
be assessed. For example, the way in which earned value is used in creating 
tasks produces different measures of progress on projects.
 
You can bone up on reporting by going to Chapter 16.
Coordinate with IT
Finally, work with your IT people to identify the Project Server features that 
you want to use in your organization. For example, if maintaining an online 
discussion is important to your company, you may want to create discussion 
boards on your Project Web App site.
Don’t forget the training!
Project Web App requires that different people 
in your organization learn new tricks. Your IT 
people need time to get up to speed on set-
ting up and maintaining the project on Project 
Server. Project managers have to learn to use 
the timesheet reports to track projects. Team 
members require some training on the status 
report and timesheet features in Project Web 
App. Build in time and money to your imple-
mentation process to make effective training 
happen.

360
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
Planning for problems
One final word about implementing Project Server and Project Web App at 
your organization: Because you will now be sharing resources and informa-
tion with others on a daily basis, put a little thought into how you’ll deal with 
problems when they come up. For example, what happens if you want to use 
a resource but another project manager already has that resource assigned 
to a project? Or, how do various project managers make use of tools, such as 
resource leveling, to resolve resource conflicts?
 
Make sure that everybody understands the rules of etiquette involved in work-
ing in an enterprise-wide fashion, sharing people, equipment, and information.
Looking Over the Project Web App Tools
So what goodies become available to you after your organization has been 
through the somewhat daunting task of getting everything set up? It’s time 
for a closer look at how you’ll use specific Project Web App features in your 
projects.
 
Chapter 19 goes into more detail about how end users make use of various 
Project Web App features.
Getting set up
Before you can begin, you have to create a Project Server account. You can 
do this by following these steps:
 
1. In Project Professional, click the File tab, click Info, and then click the 
Manage Accounts button next to Project Server Accounts.
 
2. Click the Add Button in the Project Server Accounts dialog box to 
enter your account information.
 
3. After you create the account, exit and restart Project to log on to the 
server.
 
4. Now you can create and save a project file, and then click the File tab 
and use the Publish command in Backstage view to publish that proj-
ect to the server.
Figure 18-3 shows a published project in Project Web App. Ask your IT guy or 
gal for some help on this, such as providing you with the proper server URL 
and advising you on how you should access that server. Or, again, I recom-
mend Microsoft Project 2010 Bible, by Elaine Marmel, if you feel like tackling 
this on your own.

361
 Chapter 18: Project Web App for the Project Manager
Once you’ve published a project to Project Server, the project is listed in the 
Project Center that you can open in Project Web App by click Project Center 
under Projects in the Quick Launch Pane at the left side of Project Web App. 
Once you open a project from there, you can work with task schedules much 
as you would in Project.
 
Figure 18-3: 
Here’s how 
your project 
could look in 
Project 
Web App.
 
Make assignments
Because the main focus of Project Web App is to help you interact with 
your team members, one of its most useful features is the capability to post 
resource assignments and delegate work on tasks.
When you add resources to projects, they come from the Enterprise Resource 
Pool. This central repository of resources ensures consistency of resource cal-
endars, rates, and so on across your company’s projects. Adding the resources 
from this pool to your project (using the Build Team dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 18-4) makes them available to assign to your project tasks and also lets 
you see where resources are overbooked on multiple projects.

362
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
 
Figure 18-4: 
The Build 
Team dialog 
box makes it 
easy to add 
resources to 
your project.
 
From the Resource Center, you can also view resource assignments and avail-
ability to help you plan your resource strategy. Figure 18-5 shows the current 
assignments for one resource — a very busy guy!
After you make assignments and publish the assignments, the folks on your 
team can see their new assignments on their Project Web App Home page, 
and may receive e-mail notifications if your organization sets up Project that 
way. Team members can reassign assignments to others on the team if that 
feature is enabled. Then, the team member can review and approve status 
reports on work performed on the task before sending those reports on to 
the project manager.
 
Of course, you don’t want everyone on a project to be able to pass the buck 
when it comes to assignments: The administrator can set Project Server up so 
that only the project manager has control over who is assigned to tasks in a 
project.
Track your progress
In Chapter 13, I tell you all about gathering resource-activity information and 
entering it in your Project file to track progress. This can be a somewhat 
tedious process. Wouldn’t it be nice if your resources could just enter their 
work in timesheets that could be automatically imported into Project to do 
your tracking for you? Well, I have a surprise for you.

363
 Chapter 18: Project Web App for the Project Manager
One huge perk to using Project Web App is the functionality that it gives your 
team members to track their activity on tasks and also report their progress 
to you online. Project managers can request updates or send reminders 
shortly before updates are due.
Team members can use the Microsoft Project Web App interface to enter 
actual activity into a timesheet. Web App communicates directly with 
Project on the project manager’s computer. As the project manager, you can 
then make manual updates to your project plan or let Project make its own 
updates automatically. You can also generate task update requests to help 
you remind your team to keep you apprised of their activity and progress.
 
You can find out how to use features such as the tracking sheet in Chapter 19.
 
Figure 18-5: 
Viewing

data in a

Figure out what’s going on with status reports
You can design and request status reports, which are essentially forms that 
the people on your project can complete to explain the status of their tasks. 
These aren’t used to track and record actual work performed. Instead, they 
help team members describe various issues that come up and indicate how 
the tasks are progressing. Figure 18-6 shows one of the forms used to set up a 
status report.

364
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
 
Figure 18-6: 
You specify 
exactly 
what you 
want to see 
in a status 
report.
 
You can request status reports and then work with your team’s responses. 
One of the nice things about status reports for you, as a project manager, is 
that you can assemble all the individual reports into a complete status report 
for the project. Then you can make that report available to shareholders to 
update them on the latest news.
Working with the Gang Online
The following sections get you hands-on with Project Web App, where you 
can try some of its tools for team interaction. This isn’t an exhaustive run-
down of all Project Web App has to offer, but it does get you working with the 
interface and exploring the tools it offers. Depending on your projects and 
your organization, you may take advantage of many other options.
Check resource availability and 
assignments and add resources
One of the really cool things about Project Server is how it empowers project 
managers to make resource assignments in a way that takes into account 

365
 Chapter 18: Project Web App for the Project Manager
one set of shared resources across a whole organization. The Enterprise 
Resource Pool, which the Project Server administrator from your IT group 
can set up, can show the resources that have been identified as available to 
work on your project based on what are known as RBS (Resource Breakdown 
Structure) codes used to organize resources by function. By using the 
Enterprise Resource Pool, you can make assignments without having to re-
create entries for all your resources every time you create a project.
Here are the steps involved in adding resources through Project Web App:
 
1. Log on to Project Web App, and click Project Center in the Quick 
Launch pane at the left.
 
 Project displays the Project Center.
 
2. Click the project name.
 
 Project details appear.
 
3. On the Project Web App ribbon, click the Project tab and then click 
Build Team in the Navigate group.
 
 The Project Web App screen that appears shows you a list of resources 
available to your project on the left side of the Build Team page (see 
Figure 18-7). The right side of this page lists the resources that already 
work on your project.
 
Figure 18-7: 
The 
resources 
here are 
determined 
by the 
person who 
administers

setup.
 

366
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
 
4. Select a check box to choose a resource in the left list.
 
5. Click the Add button.
 
6. Click the Save & Close button on the Team tab.
 
7.  To view assignments or availability for a resource, click to place a 
check mark beside the resource name in the list at the left, and then 
click either the Resource Assignments or Resource Availability button 
in the Navigate group of the Team tab on the Ribbon.
 
 Refer to Figure 18-5 to see how reported assignment information looks. 
Figure 18-8 shows you how the reported resource availability informa-
tion looks.
 
While viewing assignments, you can quickly view the taskbar for any task by 
clicking it and then clicking the Scroll to Task button.
Once you’ve added the resources to the project using the process I just 
explained, you can make assignments in Project just as you normally would. 
The enterprise resources appear in Resource Sheet view. Then, you can 
republish the Project, which updates the Enterprise Resource Pool with the 
assignments you just made.

 Chapter 18: Project Web App for the Project Manager
Request a status report
In an ideal world, every resource on your project would report to you faith-
fully on his or her progress (and the news would all be good). In reality, 
the news is often not so good, but there’s nothing Project or I can do about 
that. However, Project Web App does provide a way for you to design status 
reports — and regularly nudge your team to submit them to you.
You can design a status report and also request that your team submit these 
reports at intervals by using a handy wizard.
To request a status report, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Project Web App Home page, click the Status Reports link 
under Resources in the Quick Launch pane.
 
 The Status Reports page appears.
 
2. In the Requests section, choose New➪New Request.
 
 The Status Report Request page appears.
 
3. Complete the form by entering a report name, the frequency that the 
report should be submitted to you, the start date for the report, and 
the resources you want to have send it to you.
 
4. In the last area of the report titled Sections, click the Insert Section 
button and type a name for the new section.
 
 Repeat this for every section you want to be included in the report. 
Refer to Figure 18-9.
 
5. Click the Send button.
 
 The request for the report is sent to each of the resources you
indicated.
Share documents
One other great use of Project Web App is as a place to share docu-
ments with your team. Project Server can do this because it’s built on the 
SharePoint Server collaboration platform. The Project Server administrator 
must create a workspace for the project to enable document sharing. In some 

368
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
cases, the project manager will have proper permission to set up a work-
space when publishing the project, as well. Follow these steps to work with 
shared documents:
 
1. Click the Project Center link in the Quick Launch pane.
 
2. Click in the Information column beside your project. Then, on the 
Projects tab of the Ribbon, click Project Site in the Navigate group.
 
 If a site exists for the project, a page for accessing SharePoint features 
appears.
 
3. In the Quick Launch pane at left, click the Project Documents link to 
view the list of documents that are shared by the team.
 
 The list of documents appears, as shown in Figure 18-10.
 
4. You have a couple of options at this point:
 
• Click Add New Document. Use the Upload Document dialog box that

have the room to fully do it justice in this book. Fortunately, the interface 
and tools are easy to use, and the Help information is actually quite helpful.

Project Web App for 
the Team Member
In This Chapter
▶ Using Timesheet to enter actual work
▶ Looking at your assignments
▶ Sending task updates
▶ Sending a status report
P
roject Web App is a marvelous tool for project managers to make 
assignments, track progress, and communicate, but it also offers great 
advantages to project team members.
Essentially, you can think of Project Web App as a metaphorical two-way 
street. That is, project managers can post projects, notify resources of 
assignments, and request status reports, but the members of your project 
team can also initiate actions. For example, they can record the time they’ve 
spent on tasks, take a look at project information, send status reports to man-
agers, and set up alerts and reminders to keep them on top of their 
commitments.
Seeing Project Web App from 
the User’s Perspective
Logging on to Project Server using Project Web App is as easy as browsing 
to a Web page. Your project manager can give each team member the URL 
for the Web database. Then, you can open Internet Explorer, type the URL in 
the address box, and press Enter. Your Project Web App Home page appears, 
and will look similar to the one in Figure 19-1. The actual appearance of the 
Home page will vary depending on security and customization features set up 
in your organization.

You can also use the links in the Quick Launch pane along the left side of the 
screen to move around the site.
By using the various categories in the Quick Launch pane, you can accom-
plish many things, including entering the hours you have spent on tasks, 
viewing project information, getting reminders of what is coming due (or is 
overdue), and communicating with other resources on your project.
 
For information about the features of Project Web App that are useful to a 
project manager, see Chapter 18.

Viewing Your Assignments
After the project manager publishes the project and assignments, you will 
see an alert on your home page if any of the new assignments apply to you. 
You can click the link there or click Tasks under My Work to go to the My 
Assignments page, as shown in Figure 19-2. To find out more about a par-
ticular task, click the task name. The task info appears on the assignment 
details page, like the one shown in Figure 19-3. If you want to enter informa-
tion about work on individual tasks, you can do so in the locations shown in 
Figure 19-2 and 19-3.

Reporting Work Completed
Okay, put aside your project manager hat (if you have one) and imagine for a 
moment that you’re working on a project team. Your project manager — I’ll 
call him Milt — has assigned you to tasks, and you have deadlines (way too 
many in your humble opinion) to meet.
My Timesheet view, which you access through Project Web App, enables you 
to view your tasks and enter information about the actual time you spent on 
them. (Project Web App also offers a second view called My Work, where you 
also can fill in your timesheet information.) Milt can check your timesheet 
and track your progress automatically.
Here’s how to get to My Timesheet view:
 
1. Click Timesheet under My Work in the Quick Launch pane.
 
2. On the Timesheet tab of the Project Web App ribbon, click View in the 
Data group and click My Timesheet.
 
 My Timesheet view appears, as shown in Figure 19-4.

375
 Chapter 19: Project Web App for the Team Member
 
Figure 19-4: 
My 
Timesheet 
view.
 
As you can see in Figure 19-4, My Timesheet view looks something like a 
spreadsheet. To enter work on tasks, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Actual row cell for the task and date you want to update.
 
 If you need to go to the timesheet for another period to fill it out, click 
the Select Period button in the Period group on the Timesheet tab of the 
Ribbon.
 
2. Enter the actual time you spent on a task on that particular day.
 
 Use a number (such as 3, for three hours) in the appropriate date field.
 
3. In the Submit group of the Timesheet tab, click the Save button.
 
 You use Steps 1–3 as many times as needed to fill in your work for the 
period of time represented by the timesheet. You can enter your work 
information as you go or enter it all during a single sit-down. No matter 
which method you choose, when you’ve entered all the work you did for 
the period of time that the timesheet covers, you then need to submit 
the timesheet for approval.

376
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
 
4. In the Submit group of the Timesheet tab, click the Send Timesheet 
button.
 
 If you click the Send Timesheet button, a dialog box appears asking 
you to choose the person you want to submit the timesheet to. Use the 
Browse feature to choose the person and then click the OK button to 
send the timesheet.
 
After you click the Save button, the changes that you make in the timesheet 
get stored in the Project Server database, but they haven’t been used to 
update the project yet. That’s up to Milt, your faithful project manager. 
Clicking the Send Timesheet button causes Project Web App to send an e-mail 
to your manager, who can accept or reject the updates in the project. Milt, the 
project manager, can log on to Project Web App and then click the link under 
Approvals in his list of Reminders. All timesheets are displayed. Milt can 
accept or reject these as needed.
Viewing Project Information
Project team members often don’t have Project itself loaded on their comput-
ers, so they need a way to view the project plan. They can do that by using 
Project Web App. (Viewing project information works pretty much the same 
whether you’re wearing a project manager or a team member hat.)
To view a project, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Project Center link in the Quick Launch pane.
 
 All the projects you have access to — usually the ones you have assign-
ments in — are displayed, as shown in the example in Figure 19-5. This 
is the default view, Projects by Phase, for the Project Center. You can 
use the Views list box in the Projects tab Data group to navigate to other 
views, if you need to.
 
2a. To find a project, click the icon in the Information column on the left 
and then click Scroll to Project in the Zoom group of the Projects tab 
of the Ribbon.
 
 or
 
2b. To see assignment details, click a task name.

Sending Task Work Updates
Your My Assignments page and timesheet are two of the locations from 
which you can submit status updates after you’ve recorded work on tasks. 
First, click to select a check box to the left of the name of any task for which 
you want to send an update. Then click the Send Status button in the Submit 
group on the Tasks or Timesheet tab of the Ribbon. Finally, specify whether 
to send only selected updates.
Sending Status Reports
Chapter 18 explains how the project manager can send a status report 
request, which is a gentle reminder for resources to provide information 
about how things are going with assignments. Status report requests appear 
among your reminders. You can either respond to a status report request, 
or if you’re proactive (and I know that you are), send an unsolicited status 
report to the project manager.

378
Part V: Working with Enterprise Projects 
You work with status reports on the Status Reports page, as shown in Figure 
19-6. To get there, click the Status Reports link under Resources in the Quick 
Launch pane. To respond to a report that’s been requested, click the status 
report link. Or, to create your own report, click the Submit Unrequested 
Report button. Then use the form that appears, as shown in Figure 19-7, to 
specify what information appears in the report and which resources, if any, 
will receive a copy. Then click the Send button.

can do with project documents and how to access them.

In this part . . .
T
en fingers, ten toes — things that come in tens are 
just a natural! This part gives you two handy lists of 
ten: Ten Golden Rules of Project Management and Ten 
Project Management Software Products to Explore. The 
first of these chapters offers new users of Project (as well 
as seasoned veterans) some pointers on getting your 
project to perform. The second chapter looks at add-on 
products and supplemental software to enhance 
Microsoft Project.

Chapter 20
Ten Golden Rules of Project 
Management
In This Chapter
▶ Putting good project management practices to work using Microsoft Project
▶ Creating and tracking Project schedules more efficiently
▶ Learning from your mistakes
Y
ou’ve heard this one: You can have your deliverable on time, on budget, 
or done right: Choose two. That’s an example of some traditional proj-
ect management wisdom. But how does that wisdom translate to the use of 
project management software?
Well, it’s simple: If you assign additional resources to a Project schedule, you 
add costs and time to your schedule because resources have costs attached 
and can work only according to their work calendars. So, clearly, making 
changes that may improve quality — such as adding more or higher-priced 
resources — affects the time and money needed for your project. That adage 
about time being money is still true, but now you can clearly see the effect 
that one action has on other aspects of your project (especially if something 
you do tinkers with time or money) — and it’s all visible in Project’s many 
views and reports.
So what project management adages should you be aware of as you begin to 
use Project? Here are ten to tack up on your office wall.

384
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Bite Off More Than 
You Can Manage
As I mention elsewhere in this book (see Chapter 1), you must have an 
understanding of the goal of your project as well as the scope of its activi-
ties before you start to build a Project schedule. Don’t plan a full marketing 
campaign if all you can anticipate at this point is what the market-research 
phase will look like. Because the additional elements of an actual market-
ing campaign hinge on that market research, do first things first: Build your 
project in phases. That way, you’ll have less reworking of later tasks that 
simply couldn’t be anticipated when you began. You’ll also have less need to 
manipulate the baseline for those later tasks: If they’re too far in the future, 
by the time you get there, their time demands won’t look anything like what 
you originally set aside for them.
 
Don’t set tasks that are far in the future in stone too early in the game.
Here are some Project features that help you with this process:
 
✓ The capability to combine subprojects into a master project with linking
 
✓ Network Diagram view, which helps you visualize phases of your project 
graphically
 
✓ The flexible nature of Project outlines, which allow you to hide or dis-
play different phases of a project
 
See Chapter 5 for more about the best ways to manipulate outlines.
Get Your Ducks in a Row
Before you start creating your project, do your homework. If you don’t have 
all the information that you need when you sit down at your computer to 
work with Project, you’ll find yourself constantly stopping, mid-plan, and run-
ning off to find that information. This isn’t a very efficient way to work.
Here are some things to research before you sit down to build a project 
schedule:
 
✓ Basic reality check: Based on your experience managing similar proj-
ects over time, are the deliverables, budget, and preliminary schedule 
for the project within reason? Do you need to discuss changes to the 
scope and budget to avoid a project that’s not realistic to begin with?

385
 Chapter 20: Ten Golden Rules of Project Management
 
✓ Resource information: For people, this includes the full name, contact 
information, manager and manager’s contact information, skills, cost, 
schedule, and timing conflicts. For equipment or facilities, find out their 
availability and cost.
 
✓ Team structure: Does everyone do his or her own tracking, or does 
someone else on the team input everyone’s progress? Who updates the 
schedule for changes? Who gets copies of which reports? Should your 
team have access to the master schedule online? Does everyone on the 
team have the technology to communicate using collaborative features 
such as Project Web App?
 
✓ Management expectations: Does management expect to see basic 
reports on a regular basis? Would they prefer that you use Visual 
Reports, instead? Do you need to get budget approval at various phases 
in your project planning; if so, from whom? Are cross-enterprise inter-
ests involved that require you to report to or get approval from multiple 
sources? (See Chapter 16 for the lowdown on reports.)
 
✓ Company policies: These include company work policies regarding 
resource hours and overtime, the holiday calendar, how your company 
charges overhead costs or markups to projects, and what information 
can — and can’t — be shared with clients or vendors.
 
The enterprise resource features in Project 2010 help you call on company 
information stored on your server, such as obtaining a list of enterprise 
resources, for consistency across projects.
Now you’re ready to sit down and start inputting a Project project! (Is there 
an echo in here?)
Plan for Murphy
You know he’s out there: Murphy and his darn law! Most projects don’t 
happen on time or on budget. This is especially true of lengthier and more 
complex projects. Your job is to do the most accurate planning that you 
can — and make prudent adjustments whenever a wrench is thrown into 
the works. Project gives you lots of tools to do that. But beyond all the auto-
mated features of Project, you can anticipate change by planning for it.
The critical path in a project is indeed critical. Every wise project manager 
builds extra time, and even extra money, into schedules. When the project 
comes in but a week late and $5,000 over budget, only the project manager 
knows that it was really four weeks later and $25,000 costlier than what the 
first schedule — the one with no allowance for Murphy — reflected. I intro-
duce you to the critical path in Chapter 6 and show you how to display it in 
Chapter 11. 

386
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Add time to the duration of every task if possible to account for shifts in sched-
ule. Also add a resource to every phase of your project to pad your budget just 
a bit to help you deal with overages. If you want to introduce schedule-padding 
time without adding resource costs, use lag time between tasks.
 
Instead of a work or material resource, use the cost resource type to add a 
set amount to a task or phase. You can even name the extra cost resource 
Murphy, if you like!
Don’t Put Off until Tomorrow
Project management software can make many aspects of your life easier, but 
the thing that overwhelms most people when they begin to use Project is the 
amount of time spent inputting data and keeping it up to date. True, those 
tasks can be cumbersome, but what you can get back from those automated 
updating and reporting capabilities more than makes up for the up-front work.
 
Don’t forget about the capability to import tasks from Outlook into Project. 
This helps speed up some of that data entry in the planning phase.
However, if you don’t tend to the task of tracking progress on a project, you 
can wind up behind the proverbial eight ball. Track just as often as you can — 
at least once a week. This not only saves you from facing a mountain of track-
ing data to be entered, but it also means that you and your team can see the 
true picture of your project at any point in time. That way, you can promptly 
spot disaster coming and make adjustments accordingly.
Delegate, Delegate, Delegate!
Don’t try to do everything on a project yourself. Although creating and main-
taining your Project file on your own might seem to give you more control, 
doing so is just about impossible in larger projects. Of course, you don’t want 
dozens of people going in and making changes to your plan because you run 
the risk of losing track of who did what and when. However, a few simple 
practices make a few fingers in the project pie helpful, not harmful:
 
✓ Designate one person whose mission is to enter all tracking data into the 
master file for you. Or, you can automate tracking by using the Request 
Progress Information feature.
 
✓ Break your project into a few subprojects and assign people whom you 
trust to act as managers of those phases. Let them deal with their own 
tracking and adjustments, and then assemble the phase projects into a 
master project so that you can monitor their changes.

387
 Chapter 20: Ten Golden Rules of Project Management
 
✓ Enlist the help of your IS/IT person(s) to set up Project Server with 
Project Web App to provide enhanced collaborative features and share 
documents with your team.
 
✓ Set uniform procedures for your team up front. Don’t have one person 
report time on an interoffice memo sheet, somebody else e-mail you his 
progress, and others stick the work they did on tasks into the timesheet 
willy-nilly. Work up a strategy that uses Project features to communicate 
consistently.
 
If you work in a large enterprise, begin practicing enterprise project manage-
ment techniques right away. By setting up portfolios of projects and designat-
ing resource pools, you can collaborate with other project managers for the 
most efficient processes. See Chapter 19 for more about how to do this.
CYA (Document!)
Everyone knows the project management adage to CYA, but Project makes it 
a lot easier. Try using these features to document the details of your project:
 
✓ Use the Notes area for both tasks and resources to make a record 
of background information, changes, or special issues (as shown in 
Figure 20-1). (See Chapter 4.)
 
✓ Use the e-mailing feature of Project to send schedules to people for 
review. This builds an electronic paper trail of where information went 
and who responded. (See Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Customize reports to incorporate all pertinent information and help you 
document trends and changes. (See Chapter 16.)
 
Figure 20-1: 
Keep
 track of 
changes to 
personnel, 
budget, and 
timing in 
task notes.
 

388
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Try using the new Visual Reports to paint the picture of project status 
for visually inclined stakeholders. (See Chapter 16.)
 
✓ Save multiple versions of your project, especially if you make changes 
to your baseline in later versions. This provides a record of every step 
in your project planning, which you can refer to when questions arise 
down the road. (See Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Share updates to your plan through Project Web App so that nobody 
can say he or she was out of the loop when some important change 
came down. (See Chapter 18.)
Keep Your Team in the Loop
I’ve worked in offices where I spent more time wrestling with whom to keep 
informed about what than I did working. If I didn’t include marketing and 
finance in every e-mail on a new product launch, I’d be called on the carpet 
the next day, or (worse) some vital action step would fall through the cracks 
because someone didn’t know he or she was supposed to take action. Try 
these methods of keeping communication channels open:
 
✓ Use Project features that allow you to integrate with Outlook or other 
e-mail programs to send Project files or other communications.
 
✓ Build address lists in your e-mail program that are specific to your proj-
ect team so that every message goes to everyone, every time.
 
✓ Review progress with your team by meeting regularly, whether in 
person, over the phone, in an online chat area, or by using meeting soft-
ware. Make sure that each team member has the latest version of the 
Project schedule to refer to during these meetings.
 
✓ In the Share choices in the Outspace, use the Sync with Tasks List or 
Save to SharePoint commands to post the latest project information to a 
SharePoint server so that others know what’s going on.
 
✓ Display the work breakdown structure code on reports so that you can 
easily refer to specific tasks in large projects without confusion.
Measure Success
When you begin your project, you should have an idea of what constitutes 
success and know a way to measure that success. Success can involve attain-
ing many goals, such as
 
✓ Customer satisfaction
 
✓ Management satisfaction

389
 Chapter 20: Ten Golden Rules of Project Management
 
✓ Being on budget
 
✓ Being on time
When you start your project planning, know how you’ll measure your suc-
cess. Will success in budgeting mean that you don’t exceed your original 
estimates by more than 10 percent? Will your project be considered on time 
if you worked the estimated amount of weeks on it minus a two-month period 
when you went on hold for a union strike, or is the total working time less 
important than meeting a specific deadline? How will you measure customer 
satisfaction? Will management satisfaction be a done deal if you get a promo-
tion or if your division receives more funding? Does a successful product 
launch include high sales figures after the launch, or was your project suc-
cessful merely because you got it out the door?
Place milestones in your project (as shown in Figure 20-2) that reflect the 
achievement of each type of success. When you reach each milestone, you 
can pat your team on the back. Knowing what success looks like helps you 
motivate your team to get there.
 
Figure 20-2: 
Milestones 
provide 
markers 
along the 
way that 
give your 
team a 
feeling of

ment.
 
Have a Flexible Strategy
Stuff happens. There’s never been a project that didn’t require accommoda-
tions for surprises along the way. The mark of a good project manager is that 
he or she is alert to these changes and makes adjustments to deal with them 
quickly.
This isn’t always easy: It’s really, really hard to be the messenger bearing bad 
news. However, avoiding a problem in your project, hoping it will go away, 
has a nasty habit of snowballing. The following tools can help you stay alert 
to changes and make adjustments:

390
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ The Resource Substitution Wizard with Project Server helps you make 
changes when the one resource you counted on suddenly wins the lot-
tery and disappears.
 
✓ The Change Highlighting feature can help you see where changes to 
your schedule pay off in a trimmer budget or faster schedule.
 
✓ Turn on critical path formatting (see Figure 20-3) to see the critical path 
of your project and track how much slack you have left. Adjusting tasks 
to efficiently use up their slack can keep you on schedule in a crisis.
 
Remember that Project 2010 offers features to help you try what-if scenarios 
and determine what’s driving the timing of tasks (see Chapter 15). Use these 
to figure out the best way to proceed.

Learn from Your Mistakes
One of the greatest gifts that Project offers you is the capability to look back 
after you complete a project so that you can learn from your mistakes. You 
can review your original schedule and every version after that to see how 
well you estimated time and money and figure out how to do it better.
By using records of your project, you can spot trends. Where do you always 
seem to miss on timing? Do you always allow way too little time on market 
research and way too much time for Q&A? Do you always forget to budget 
for temporary help during rush times, or do you overstaff early on when you 
could get by with fewer people?
Use the wealth of information in Project schedules to educate yourself on 
your own strengths and weaknesses as a project planner and manager and to 
get better with each project you take on.

Software Products to Explore

▶ Discovering software that integrates with Project-generated plans
▶ Reviewing separate software products that help project managers with project-related 
tasks
I
f you’ve followed this book to this point, you’ve probably figured out by 
now that project management software — just like a project manager — 
wears a lot of hats. Microsoft Office Project does everything from allowing 
you to create tasks and assign resources to tracking progress, analyzing cost 
overruns, and analyzing scheduling conflicts. It handles graphics, complex 
calculations, and interactions with the Web.
Software designers always have to make trade-offs among features, decid-
ing which ones to include and how much functionality to give each feature. 
Most Project features do everything you need, but others are less complete. 
Some features may not quite get the job done as well as a more specialized 
tool that you can use in conjunction with Project. Third-party software part-
ners work with Microsoft to create add-on software to provide Project with 
greater functionality: for example, generating a greater variety of graphic 
reports. In other cases, software handles specialized functions that Project 
doesn’t incorporate, such as managing the hundreds of drawings involved in 
construction projects.
Consider this the when-two-heads-are-better-than-one chapter. This chapter 
describes ten interesting software tools that you can use with Project. Most 
of the makers of these tools offer some kind of free demo of their product on 
company Web sites. Plenty of products are out there, so use this chapter as a 
starting point as you consider ways to extend Project’s functionality.

DecisionEdge Chart and Report Products 
Enhance Project’s Own Tools
The business intelligence software DecisionEdge for Microsoft Office Project 
(www.decisionedge.com) offers reporting and graphics that add func-
tionality to Project. You can use these tools to help you visualize resource 
challenges, get a handle on your project schedule status, and gauge how well 
you’re performing.
Go to the DecisionEdge Web site to see a sample gallery of charts and reports 
that use a variety of graphic effects and colors to get your message across. 
Check out the Dashboard charts, which show a combination of several differ-
ent charts in one report; these help your executives get a one-glance over-
view of your progress.
Even with the more graphical options in Project’s new Visual Reports 
feature, you can benefit from the more advanced graphics capabilities of 
DecisionEdge’s products.
Cobra Squeezes the Most 
from Cost/Earned Value
Deltek (www.deltek.com), which makes its own complete project manage-
ment package called Deltek Open Plan, also produces Deltek Cobra, a cost/
earned value management software package that you can use with Project 
plans. Cobra tools offer functionality in estimating, what-if modeling of costs, 
and budget forecasting based on information in your Project schedule. I espe-
cially like the multiple-rate files feature that makes it easy to juggle several 
resource rates within a single project.
Cobra not only allows you to define certain budget calculations yourself, but 
it also offers more flexibility than some of Project’s costing features. In addi-
tion, the Chart Template Designer lets you play around with a variety of 3-D 
charts, which you can manipulate and rotate in several ways, expanding your 
options for presenting Project data in three dimensions.

MindManuals (www.mindjet.com) offers Mindjet MindManager, which is 
a software product that helps you get your team thinking together in cre-
ative ways. This visual mapping software is touted as a visual thinking tool. 
MindManager is also offered in a couple of specialized editions for CPAs 
and sales professionals, and even has an iPhone version, Mindjet 
for iPhone.
MindManager maps allow you to attach files, connect to RSS feeds, and more. 
After you organize your ideas and information, you can use these details as

Innate Integrates Projects 
Large and Small
Innate Timesheets and Innate Resource Management from Innate 
Management Systems (www.innateus.com) are especially helpful if you’re 
juggling multiple projects that range from small to large. You can use Innate 
to manage the human resources who work on smaller projects in your organi-
zation and are also busy on larger projects that you plan in Microsoft Project. 
Innate Timesheets can group resources in various useful ways.
The Innate Resource Management helps you scope out resource avail-
ability and prioritize resource assignments. Innate Timesheets is tracking 
software, but it offers more than Project does in this area. You can do pro-
ductivity comparisons across several tasks or projects. You can also tap 
in to sophisticated billing systems and integrate project information with 
accounting and payroll systems in ways that enhance Project 2010 budget-
tracking features.

PlanView Models Your 
Workforce Capacity
PlanView, Inc. (www.planview.com) produces the software product 
PlanView Enterprise Portfolio Management, which helps you sort through the 
various layers in your organization. The role-modeling features in PlanView 
allow you to analyze and manage risk, give priorities to strategies, and set up 
scenarios to prepare for inevitable emergencies in your project.
The PlanView Project Portfolio Management product focuses on specific 
project work, featuring easy-to-use dashboards for managing your project 
portfolios.
PlanView is closely integrated with Microsoft Project, so you can share 
information about processes and people on a project between the two 
products. PlanView templates can also be used to give you a head start on 
your Project plan.
Tenrox Streamlines Business Processes
The buzzword today is enterprise, and Tenrox (www.tenrox.com) puts the 
focus on business processes, such as performance analysis, resource plan-
ning, purchasing, and revenue and cost accounting. One of the best uses of 
this software for the Microsoft Project user is as a bridge to various enter-
prise and accounting packages such as SAP and ADP Payroll.
Project Portfolio Management and Professional Services Automation for ser-
vice delivery and invoicing are Web-based solutions that can be very useful 
in a geographically diverse project team setting. You should take a look at 
these packages also if you have a need for RFI, quotation, and evaluation 
functions in your projects. Tenrox also offers a set of proposal management 
tools to help you get the project off the ground in the first place.

 Chapter 21: Ten Project Management Software Products to Explore
Project KickStart Gives Your 
Project a Head Start
Project KickStart from Experience In Software (www.experienceware.com) 
is a simple-to-use program with a wizard-like approach that helps you lay 
the groundwork for small to midsize projects. If you need a little help getting 
started with a project, you can create your plan here in 30 minutes or less 
and then use the hot link to port information to Microsoft Project.
Project KickStart is designed to help you figure out your project strategy as you 
come up with a list of tasks. Planning icons remind you to map the goals of your 
project and plan for obstacles. Libraries of typical goals and challenges make 
building them into your plan simple, and you can add your own specific com-
pany or industry phrases to the libraries. Links to Outlook, Word, and Excel 
also offer you some flexibility in sharing information among the Office family of 
products, which includes Project. Check out the free trial download and online 
demo to get an idea of what Project KickStart can do for your projects.
Project Manager’s Assistant Organizes 
Drawings for Construction Projects
Originally created for the construction industry, Project Manager’s Assistant, 
CS Project Lite, and CS Project Professional from Crest Software (www.
crestsoft.com) are useful for any industry that uses a lot of drawings.
Essentially, Project Manager’s Assistant helps you track drawings, issue copies, 
develop production plans, and manage changes over the life of the project. 
Although the product doesn’t integrate directly with Project, it’s an additional 
software product that might prove useful to many project managers — and 
it does integrate with any ODBC (open database connectivity) database. The 
other two products provide project management capabilities.
Graphic designers and new product designers who generate drawings can 
catalog them here. If you manage scientific or engineering projects, you may 
also find this software useful for managing schematics or diagrams. By plac-
ing links to this database in your Project plan, you can make this information 
available to your project team.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
TeamTrack Solves Mission-Critical Issues
TeamTrack from Serena Software, Inc. (www.serena.com) helps you identify 
problems and defects that may crop up in your processes — and find solu-
tions. The software allows you to create visual maps for your processes and 
share that data among your team members. The Web focus here means that 
people can get to the process data online without having Project running.
One nice feature of this software is that it notifies you when a problem occurs 
or deadlines have passed without activity. TeamTrack even helps you iden-
tify issues that may arise when “nontalking” systems communicate. In other 
words, if you integrate two pieces of software to share data and data comes 
into Project that causes a problem, you won’t even know it because you’re 
not inputting it. TeamTrack flags such problems to help you avoid missing a 
critical situation before it’s too late.
Serena’s Web site offers a free evaluation download and online case studies 
to help you decide whether TeamTrack is right for you.
EPK-Suite Eases Portfolio 
Mangement Chores
EPK-Suite from EPK Group (www.epkgroup.com) is built on Project Server 
and Windows SharePoint Services platforms and integrates through Project 
Web App, so this technology works seamlessly with Project.
EPK-Suite offers portfolio management, resource and capacity planning, 
timesheets, and collaboration features with an easy-to-use interface. Check 
out the new features in version 4, including Web-based planning and resource 
request/planning tools.
