About the Authors
Tee Morris: Tee Morris is an instructor at EEI Communications, based out of
the Washington DC/Virginia/Maryland metro area, and teaches various appli-
cations in graphic design and video editing; he also teaches Podcasting for
Government and Corporate Business. When he is not working as a freelance
artist and instructor, Tee writes science fiction and fantasy; his writing career
began with his 2002 historical epic fantasy, MOREVI The Chronicles of Rafe &
Askana, published by Dragon Moon Press. His other works include MOREVI’s
highly anticipated sequel Legacy of MOREVI: Book One of the Arathellean Wars
and Billibub Baddings and The Case of The Singing Sword, a spoof of both fan-
tasy and hard-boiled detective novels that received an Honorable Mention for
ForeWord Magazine’s Book of the Year and was a finalist for the Independent
Publisher’s Best Science Fiction and Fantasy book. It was the podcast of his
debut novel that led to this team-up with Evo Terra in Podcasting For Dummies.
Find out more about Tee Morris at www.teemorris.com.
Evo Terra: Evo is the poster child for Type A personalities the world over.
Washed-up musician, tree-hugging herbalist, heretical-but-ordained minister,
talk-radio personality, advertising executive and technology innovator, all
wrapped up in one single-serving package. In the podcasting world, Evo
tends to infect others with the podcasting bug, from budding show hosts to
the people behind the scenes finding new uses for podcast technologies. 
He hosts three different podcasts, Slice of Scifi (sliceofscifi.com), the
Dragon Page Cover to Cover, and Wingin’ It! (dragonpage.com) and is help-
ing authors podcast their works to the masses at Podiobooks.com.
He currently resides in Cottonwood, Arizona, with his wife Sheila and his son
NJ. Neither of which have a podcast. Yet. 


Authors’ Acknowledgments
Due to the complexity of the issue and the incredible growth in the commu-
nity, it will be impossible to properly express our thanks to all the parties
who were of great help with this book. So with that . . .
To our editors Steve and Kim: Thanks for letting our own voices shine through
while making both of us better writers in the end. And as for the multitude of
other editors and proofers on this project: thanks. We hope we entertained
you along the way.
To our wives, Sheila and Natalie: Thanks for not strangling us for our constant
“Oh! We’ve got to add that to the book!” moments. We both deeply appreciate
the averted gazes of death when we answered that no, unfortunately we would
not be coming to bed and that yes we did realize it was three o’clock in the
morning.
To the podcasters that provided not only inspiration, but also camaraderie and
friendship along the way. Through listening to you all and talking to many,
you served as a constant reminder of why we were pouring our hearts and
souls into this text. 
Evo would like to personally express his gratitude to the TSFPN podcasters
for their continued encouragement. Also, he’d like to personally recommend
Cake and Soul Coughing, which provided external energy and drive when it
was in low supply.
Tee suggests The Anime Radio Nook on Live 365.com, Paul Oakenfold, and
the Battlestar Galactica soundtracks by Richard Gibbs and Bear McCreary for
reserve power during all-night rewrites. And a big thank you to his coauthor,
Evo Terra, for covering his back, challenging his opinions, keeping him honest,
and still being a best friend, even at the end of this project. (See . . . I told you
we wouldn’t kill each other!)
Finally, a special nod to Michael R. Mennenga for passing along that e-mail
on October 12, 2004, that opened a door to a world of time-shifting, kick ass
mystic ninjas, and science fiction and fantasy geeks around the world inter-
ested in what we have to offer.

Foreword
A
year ago we were just like you . . . and then we became podcasting
superstars! 
Drew came home in August of 2004 in a full-blown nerd frenzy, raving about
how audio blogs and RSS were going to change communication as we know it.
I pretended to understand and feigned interest as he spoke on and on, but
when I listened to his first audio blog post, it finally clicked — he was onto
something. I quickly jumped on board to prevent him from nerding it up too
much and thus the Dawn and Drew Show! was born. 
The term “podcasting” wasn’t coined until a short while later, but the idea
remains the same: If you have a message, record it using simple software and
inexpensive equipment and then publish it to the Web for the world to hear.
We have listeners on every continent and get feedback from around the globe,
and we do it all from the living room of our Wisconsin farmhouse — sometimes
in our pajamas. We’re still using the same $20 USB microphone and GarageBand
software from Apple, so we’re a perfect example that you don’t need a lot of
money to get started in podcasting. But the very best thing about podcasting
is that anyone can do it! When we started, there weren’t any how-to books on
the subject, but now Podcasting For Dummies has made it easy for you to get
your own podcast started. There is no censorship, no FCC, and no radio exec-
utives to tell you what to say — there are no rules. Podcasting is all about
self-expression. So start podcasting now — fame and fortune may await you. 
We’ve always had a great time making the Dawn and Drew Show! and now we’re
able to do it full time. It’s the great podcasting dream come true, and if we can
do it, so can you!

Podcasting For Dummies 
xviii

Introduction
M
aybe you’ve been casually surfing the Web or perusing your newspaper
when the word “podcasting” has popped up. Steadily, like a building
wave that would make champion surfers salivate with delight, the term has
popped up again and again — and your curiosity continues to pique as the
word “podcasting” echoes in your ears and remains in the back of your mind
as a riddle wrapped in an enigma, super-sized with a side of fries and a diet
soda to go.
Podcasting For Dummies is the answer to that super-sized riddle-enigma
combo, and it even comes complete with a special prize. Beginning with 
the question at the forefront of your mind — What is podcasting? — this 
book takes you through the fastest-growing technological movement on
the Internet. By the time you reach the end of this book, the basics will be
in place to get you, your voice, and your message heard around the world —
and you can even have a bit of fun along the way.
About This Book
“So what are you up to, Tee?”
“I’m currently podcasting my first novel, a swashbuckling tale that carries
our heroes . . .”
“Uh . . . what is a podcast?”
Asked by best friends and lifetime technologists, this question continues to
crop up over and over again, immediately after the word “podcast” lands in
a casual conversation. Just the word “podcasting” carries an air of geekiness
about it — and behold, the habitual technophobes suddenly clasp their hands
to their ears and run away screaming in horror lest they confront yet another
technical matter. Too bad. If they only knew how technical it really isn’t. When
you peel back the covers and fancy-schmancy tech-talk, it’s a pretty simple
process to make your own podcast. You just need someone pointing the way
and illuminating your path.
This is why we are here: to be that candle in the dark, helping you navigate a
world where anyone can do anything, provided they have the tools, the drive,

and the passion. You don’t need to be a techno-wizard or a super-geek — 
you need no wad of tape holding your glasses together; your shirt tail need
not stick out from your fly. Anyone can do what we show you in this book.
Anyone can take a thought or an opinion, make an audio file expressing 
that opinion, and distribute this idea worldwide. Anyone can capture the
attention of a few hundred — or a few thousand — people around the world
through MP3 players hiding in computers, strapped around biceps, jouncing
in pockets, or hooked up to car stereos.
Anyone can podcast.
Podcasting, from recording to online hosting, can be done on a variety of 
budgets, ranging from frugal to Fortune 500. You can podcast about literally
anything — including podcasting for its own sake. As blogging gave the anony-
mous, the famous, the “almost-famous,” and the “used-to-be famous” a voice
in politics, religion, and everyday life, podcasting adds volume and tone to
that voice. Words on a page are often misconstrued because it’s difficult to
catch the subtle meanings and innuendos hidden within text. But when those
words are actually spoken aloud, the sender’s interpretation is clear, concise,
and leaves little room for doubt when the message is delivered.
Podcasting is many things to many people — but at its most basic, it’s a 
surprisingly simple and powerful technology. What it means boils down to
a single person: you. Some liken it to radio (at least online radio), but it can
do — and be — so much more. Podcasting is a new method of communica-
tion, transmitting your voice and its message around the world without using
public airwaves, connecting the Global Village in ways that the creators of
the Internet, RSS, and MP3 compression would probably never have dreamed.
It is the unique and the hard-to-find content that can’t find a place on com-
mercial, college, or public access radio.
You are about to embark on an exciting adventure into undiscovered terri-
tory, and here you will find out that podcasting is all these things, and so
much more.
How to Use This Book
Podcasting For Dummies should be these things to all who pick up and read it
(whether straight through or by jumping around in the chapters):
 A user-friendly guide in how to listen, produce, and distribute podcasts
 A terrific reference for choosing the right hardware and software to put
together a sharp-sounding podcast
2
Podcasting For Dummies 

 The starting point for the person who knows nothing about audio edit-
ing, recording, creating RSS feeds, hosting blogs, or turning a computer
into a recording studio
 A handy go-to “think tank” for any beginning podcaster who’s hungry for
new ideas on what goes into a good podcast and fresh points of view
 A really fun read
There will be plenty of answers in these pages, and if you find our answers too
elementary, we give you plenty of points-of-reference to research on your own
time. We don’t claim to have all the solutions, quick fixes, and resolutions to
all possible podcasting queries, but we do present to you the basic building
blocks and first steps for beginning a podcast. As with any For Dummies book,
our responsibility is to give you the foundation on which to build. That’s what
we have done our level best to accomplish: Bestow upon you the enchanted
stuff that makes a podcast happen.
This book was written as a linear path from the conceptualization stages to the
final publication of your work. However, not everyone needs to read the book
from page one. If you’ve already gotten your feet wet with the various aspects
of podcasting, jump around from section to section and read the parts that you
need. We provide plenty of guides back to other relevant chapters for when the
going gets murky.
Conventions Used in This Book
When you go through this book, you’re going to see a few Ú symbols, the
occasional ➪, and even a few things typed in a completely different
style.
There is a method to this madness, and those methods are conventions
found throughout this book and other For Dummies titles.
When we refer to keyboard shortcuts for Macintosh or Windows, we desig-
nate them with (Mac) or (Windows). For Macintosh shortcuts, instead of
using that funky cloverleaf symbol, we use the Apple symbol (found on the
Command key) and the corresponding letter. For Windows shortcuts, we 
use the abbreviation for the Control key and the corresponding letter. So 
the shortcut for Select All looks like this: Ú+A (Mac) / Ctrl+A (Windows).
If keyboard shortcuts are not your thing and you want to know where the
commands reside on menus, we use a command arrow (➪) to help guide 
you through menus and submenus. So, going back to the earlier example, 
the command for Select All in the application’s menu is Edit➪Select All.

Introduction

When we offer up URLs (Web site addresses) of various podcasts, resources,
and audio equipment vendors, or when we have you creating RSS feeds for
podcatchers such as iTunes, iPodder, or iPodderX, we use this particular
typeface.
Bold Assumptions
We assume that you have a computer, a lot of curiosity, and a desire to pod-
cast. We could care less about whether you’re using a Mac, a PC, Linux, Unix,
or two Dixie cups connected with string. In podcasting, the operating system
just makes the computer go. We’re here to provide the tools for creating a
podcast, regardless of what OS you’re running.
Okay, maybe the two Dixie cups connected with string would be a challenge.
We both recommend that if you don’t have a computer for podcasting, get
one. That’s an essential.
If you know nothing about audio production, this book will also serve as a fine
primer in how to record, edit, and produce audio on your computer, as well as
accessorize your Mac or Windows PC with mixing boards, professional-grade
microphones, and audio-engineering software that will give you a basic look at
this creative field. You can hang on to this title as a handy reference, geared
for audio in podcasting. Again, our book is a starting point, and (ahem) a fine
starting point at that.
With everything that goes into podcasting, there are some things this book is
not now, nor will ever be, about. Here’s the short list:
 We’re not out to make you into an übergeek in RSS or XML (but we give
you all you need to make things work — even get you iTunes-ready).
 We figure that if you get ahold of Audacity, GarageBand, Audio Hijack
Pro, Soundtrack, or Audition, you can take it from there (but we give you
overviews of those programs and a few basic editing examples).
 We’re not out to teach you how to use an MP3 player such as an iPod, an
iRiver, or a Zen Micro product.
For that matter — to dispel one of the biggest misconceptions of podcasting —
you will not be told to run out and get an iPod. You do not need an iPod to 
podcast.
If you are looking for a resource that will teach you RSS, take a look at
Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies by Ellen Finkelstein 
(published by Wiley).

Podcasting For Dummies 

If you are looking for a resource that will teach you audio editing on your
computer, take a look at PC Recording Studios For Dummies by Jeff Strong.
While the title does refer to “PC” by name, the book opens with the statement
“Whether you use a Windows or Macintosh computer for your home recording
studio, your system of choice employs much of the same basic technology . . .”
and carries on its dual-platform attitude from beginning to end. That’s our
kind of approach.
If you are looking for a terrific start to the podcasting experience, then — in
the words of the last knight guarding the Holy Grail in Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade — “You have chosen wisely.”
How This Book Is Organized
Now that we’ve told exactly what this book is not, we give you a quick
overview as to what this book exactly is. And yeah, we’re going to keep the
overview brief because we figure you’re anxious to get started. But the fact
that you’re reading this passage also tells us you don’t want to miss a detail,
so here’s a quick bird’s-eye view of what we do in Podcasting For Dummies.
Part I: Podcasting on a 
Worldwide Frequency
This is a great part for both kinds of podcasters — those who want to par-
ticipate, and those who just want to listen. We pay heed to the evolution of
podcasting from the blogging movement, and then try to explain, in the sim-
plest terms (as if to someone completely unfamiliar with all things technical),
exactly what podcasting is.
In other words, we use pop-culture references.
Part I also goes into the bare-bones basics of how a podcast happens, how to
get podcasts from the Internet to your computer, and how to host a podcast
yourself — ending up with a few places online that offer podcast feeds you
can visit to sample the experience — and (later on) let the world know “Hey,
I’ve got a podcast, too!”
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with 
the Sound of Podcasting
Consider this section of the book part-Inside the Actor’s Studio, part-Tech 
TV, part-WKRP (with your host, Dr. Johnny Fever . . . boooouuugaaar!!!). But
5
Introduction

instead of (pod)casting you into the wilderness to stumble through personal
rants and raves, verbally trip over yourself in interviews, and post podcasts
so raw that your listeners’ ears bleed, we offer up some techniques the pros
use in broadcasting. Podcasting may be the grass-roots movement of home-
spun telecommunications, but that doesn’t mean it has to sound that way
(unless, of course, you want it to sound that way). From preshow prep to 
setting your volume levels to the basics of audio editing, this is the part 
that polishes your podcast.
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great
Recording of Your Voice. Now What?
The audio file you’ve just created is now silently staring back at you from
your monitor (unless you’re listening to it on your computer’s music player,
in which case it’s just defiantly talking back at you!), and you haven’t a clue
what your next step is. We cover the last-minute details, and then walk you
through the process of getting your podcast online, finding the right Web-
hosting packages for podcasts, and getting a good working handle on the 
RSS and XML used in podcast feeds.
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the 
News about Your Podcast
“I wanna beeee a part of it. Podcasting, babeeeee . . .
If I can get on Daily Source,
Then I’ll have no remorse for pod—cast—in . . . podcasting . . .”
Sorry. Sinatra moment.
Anyway, you’ve got the podcast recorded, edited, and online, now you need
to let people know you’ve got this great podcast just waiting for them — and
that is what we explore in Part IV. With the power of publicity — from free-of-
charge word-of-mouth (arguably the most effective) to investment in Google
Adwords (arguably the most coverage for your dollar), you have a wide array
of options to choose from when you’re ready to announce your presence to
the podcasting community.
Part V: Pod-sibilities to 
Consider for Your Show
The question of why one should podcast is as important as how to podcast.
We cover some basic rationales that many folks have for sitting behind a
6
Podcasting For Dummies 

microphone, pouring heart, soul, and pocket change into their craft each and
every day, week, or month. These questions have no right or wrong answers,
but our hope is that this section offers pointers to guide you safely through
the thought process behind podcasting.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Perhaps the toughest chapters to write were these: the For Dummies trade-
mark Part of Tens chapters. So don’t skip them because we’ll be über-miffed
if you fail to appreciate how hard we busted our humps to get these chapters
done!
Right — so what do we give you in our Part of Tens? We give you a list of the
ten people who made (and/or currently make) podcasting the hottest com-
munications trend to come down the pike since the invention of the Internet.
We also offer suggestions for the beginning podcaster — such as what kind of
podcasts should be on your MP3 player, just to give you an idea of what’s out
there, how they sound, and how you can benefit from them. Finally, our Part
of Tens closes with the great debate: Podcasting versus Radio. Is radio dead?
Is podcasting just another fad? Read . . . and then you decide.
About the Companion Podcast
In some cases, a For Dummies book comes with a companion Web site hosted
by the good people at www.dummies.com. Podcasting For Dummies is the first
book in the For Dummies series (and could be the world’s first do-it-yourself
book) to come with a companion podcast. Go to your browser and surf to
www.dummies.com/go/podcastingfd and follow the instructions there to
get free weekly audio commentary from Tee Morris (and maybe Evo Terra, if
time and podcasting schedules allow) about concepts in this book explored
in greater detail, from the difference between good and bad edits, when too
much reverb is too much, and the variety of methods you can use to record 
a podcast.
Icons Used in This Book
So you’re trekking through the book, making some real progress with devel-
oping your podcast when suddenly these little icons leap out, grab you by
the throat, and wrestle you to the ground. (Who would have thought pod-
casting was so action-packed, like a Connery-Bond movie, huh?) What do 
all these little drawings mean? Glad you asked . . .
7
Introduction

When we’re in the middle of a discussion and suddenly we have one of those
“Say, that reminds me . . .” moments, we give you one of these tips. They’re
handy little extras that are good to know and might even make your podcast
sound a little tighter than average.
If that “Say, that reminds me . . .” moment is more than a handy little nugget 
of information and closer to a “Seriously, you can’t forget this part!” factoid, 
we mark it with a Remember icon. You’re going to want to play close atten-
tion to these puppies. They will save you a lot of grief in the future.
Sometimes we interrupt our train of thought with a “Time out, Sparky . . .”
moment — and this is where we ask for your completely undivided attention.
The Warnings are exactly that: flashing lights, ah-ooga horns, dire portents.
They’re reminders not to try this at home, disclaimers that if you do this we
can’t be held responsible, and advice for avoiding situations where that earlier-
mentioned knight from The Last Crusade looks at you and says, “You chose
poorly.”
These icons can illuminate those “So how does this widget really work . . . ?”
moments you may have as you read Podcasting For Dummies. You can
regard them as cool trivia to impress friends with at parties, or surprise the
techno-geeks at the Help Desk who believe they know everything already.
The Technical Stuff icons can give you a deeper understanding of what
the wizard is doing behind the curtain, making you all the more apt as a 
podcaster.
Where to Go from Here
At this point, many For Dummies authors say something snappy, clever, or
even a bit snarky. We save our best tongue-and-cheek material for the pages
inside, so let’s take a more serious approach . . .
We suggest heading to where you’re planning to record your podcast or just
plant yourself in front of a computer where you plan to download podcasts
for listening. Start with Chapter 1 where you’re given a few links to check out,
some suggestions on applications for downloading podcasts, and directories
to look up where you can find Tee’s podcast, Evo’s (many) podcasts, and
other podcasts that can educate, inspire, and enlighten your ears with origi-
nal content.
Where do we go from here? Up and out, my friends. Up and out . . .

odcasting is (depending on who’s describing it)
either taking the world by storm or providing an
interesting diversion. If neither of those, it falls some-
where in between. Whatever it is, we like it, and we think
you will too. In this first part, we peel back the covers and
go beyond the hype to talk about what this technology is
and exactly what you need to do to become involved with
it — from soup to nuts.

S
ometimes the invention that makes the biggest impact on our daily 
lives isn’t an invention at all, but the convergence of existing technolo-
gies, processes, and ideas. Podcasting may be the perfect example of that
principle — and it’s changing the relationship people have with their radios,
music collections, books, education, and more.
The podcasting movement is actually a spin-off of another communications
boom: personal Weblogs, commonly referred to as blogs. Blogs sprang up
right and left, providing non-programmers and designers a clean, elegant
interface that left many on the technology side wondering why they hadn’t
thought of it sooner. Everyday people could now chronicle their lives, hopes,
dreams, and fears, and show them to anyone who cared to read. And oddly
enough, people did care to read — and still do.
Podcasting combines the instant information exchange of blogging with
audio files that can be played on a computer or MP3 player. When you make
your podcast publicly available on the World Wide Web, you are exposing
your craft to anyone with a personal computer and a broadband Internet con-
nection. To put that in perspective, the Computer Industry Almanac predicts
the global online population will top 1.2 billion users by 2006. In the United
States, broadband connections are now more popular than dial-up. And to
top it all off, portable players are surging in popularity, with over 22 million
adult owners.
This chapter is for podcasters (those making the content) and podcatchers
(those listening to the content) alike. We cover the basic steps to record a
podcast and lay out the basics of what you need to do to tune in a podcast.

Deciding Whether Podcasting Is for You
Technically speaking, podcasting is the distribution of specially encoded multi-
media content to subscribed personal computers via the RSS 2.0 protocol.
Whew! Allow us to translate that into common-speak:
Podcasting allows you to listen to stuff you want to hear, whenever and
wherever you want.
Podcasting turns the tables on broadcast schedules, allowing the listener to
choose not only what to listen to, but also when. And because podcasts are
transferred via the Internet, the power to create an audio program isn’t lim-
ited to those with access to a radio transmitter. This section covers other
reasons podcasting is probably for you.
You want to deliver audio 
content on a regular basis
Sure, you can post your audio content on a blog if you have one. Many blog-
gers who do that (called audiobloggers) record audio segments and insert
them as links into the text of their blog posts. Readers of the blog then down-
load the files at their leisure. However, audio blogs require the readers to
manually select the content they wish to download. What sets podcasting
apart from blogging is that podcasting automates that process. A listener
who subscribes to your podcast is subscribed to all of your content, when-
ever it’s available. No need to go back to the site to see what’s new!
You want to reach beyond 
the boundaries of radio
In radio, the number of people who can listen to a show is limited by the
power of the transmitter pumping out the signal. Podcasting doesn’t use radio
signals, transmitters, or receivers — at least not in the classic sense. Podcasts
use the World Wide Web as a delivery system, opening up a potential audience
that could extend to the entire planet.
No rules exist (yet, anyway) to regulate the creation of podcast content. In
fact, neither the FCC nor any other regulatory body for any other government
holds jurisdiction over podcasts. If that seems astounding, remember that
podcasters are not using the public airwaves to deliver the message.
12
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

Just because the FCC doesn’t have jurisdiction, you’re not exempt from the 
law or — perhaps more importantly — immune to lawsuits. You’re personally
responsible for anything you say, do, or condone on your show. Additionally, the
rules concerning airplay of licensed music, the distribution of copyrighted
material, and the legalities of recording telephone conversations all apply. Pay
close attention to the relevant sections in Chapter 5 to avoid some serious 
consequences. When it comes to the legalities, ignorance is not bliss.
Narrowcasting (the practice of delivering content to a select group) distin-
guishes podcasting from traditional forms of broadcast communication, such
as radio. Where a radio station broadly casts its signal to anyone who hap-
pens to be within the radius of the signal, podcasts narrowly cast content to
people who have made the overt decision to listen.
You have something to say
Podcasters as a general rule produce content that likely holds appeal for only a
select group of listeners. Podcasts start with an idea, something that you have
the desire and knowledge, either real or imaginary, to talk about. Add to that a
bit of drive, a do-it-yourself-ishness, and an inability to take no for an answer.
The point is to say what you want to say, to those who want to hear it.
13
Chapter 1: Getting the Scoop on Podcasting
What’s in a name, when the name is podcasting?
As with most items that make their way into the
conventional lexicon of speech, the precise ori-
gins and meaning behind podcasting are some-
what clouded. While the domain podcast.com
was originally registered back in 2002 (nothing
was ever done with it, as far as we know), and
Ben Hammersley suggested that and many
other terms in February 2004 (www.guardian.
co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1145689
,00.html), it’s generally accepted in the
podosphere that the first person to use the term
as a reference to the activity we now know 
as podcasting was Dannie Gregoire on
September 15, 2004 (groups.yahoo.com/
group/ipodder-dev/message/41). While
some assert the name has connotations to the
popular iPod device created by Apple, Dannie
didn’t have that in mind when the phrase was
coined. Regardless of the intentions, the term
has been backronymed (that is, treated like an
acronym and applied to a variety of plausible
existing meanings). Of all the possibilities, we
prefer Personal On-Demand narrowcasting (not
broadcasting), which shortens nicely to pod-
casting. But of course, you can choose
whichever one makes sense to you.
Granted, the podcasting phenomenon was in part
fueled by the wildly popular iPod portable audio
device, but no evidence suggests that the two
were related when the name was coined. And (as
one of your authors, Evo, stoutly maintains),
“Because I don’t even own an iPod, yet am quite
obviously a podcaster, I see no reason for the
association to continue to be made.” Harrumph.

Podcasts can be about anything and be enjoyed by just about anyone. The
topics covered don’t have to be earth-shattering or life-changing. You have to
follow a few rules, but even then you can break most of them.
Some of the most popular podcasts are created by everyday people who sit
in front of their computers for a few nights a week and just speak their minds,
hearts, and souls. Some are focused on niche topics; others are more broad-
based. Quite a few are seemingly put together at random, perhaps moments
before the recording started.
You want to hear from your listeners
I’ve heard more than one podcaster comment on the fact that they get, well . . .
comments. For some reason (which we’ll let the social anthropologists of the
future puzzle out), podcast listeners are more likely to provide feedback to 
the podcasts they listen to than radio show listeners are likely to e-mail their
thoughts to the show host. That’s probably traceable to the personal nature of
selecting a podcast. Podcasts offer their listeners — and makers — more con-
trol, options, and intimacy than traditional broadcast media can. Of course,
the radio is much harder to talk back to than a computer with an Internet 
connection and e-mail (which remains the killer app).
When you ask for feedback, you’re likely to get it — and from unusual places.
Because geography doesn’t limit the distance your podcast can travel, you
may find yourself with listeners in faraway and exotic places. And this feed-
back isn’t always going to be “Wow, great podcast!” Listeners will be honest
with you when you invite feedback.
If you’re starting to get the idea that podcasting is revolutionary, ground-
breaking, and possibly a major component of social upheaval, great. But 
not all podcasts are so deep. In fact, many of them are just plain fun!
Creating a Podcast
There are two schools of thought when it comes to creating a podcast: The 
“I need the latest and greatest equipment in order to capture that crisp, clear
sound of the broadcasting industry” school of thought, and the “Hey, my com-
puter came with a microphone, and I’ve got this cool recording software already
installed” school of thought. Both are equally valid positions, and there are 
a lot of secondary schools in-between. The question is how far you’re willing
to go.
But let’s dispel something right off the bat about podcasting: You’re not
reprogramming your operating system, you’re not hacking into the Internal
Revenue Service’s database, and you’re not setting up a wireless computer
14
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

network with tinfoil from a chewing gum wrapper, a shoestring, and your 
belt — regardless if MacGyver showed you how. Podcasting, as mentioned
earlier, is not rocket science. In fact, here’s a quick rundown of how you 
podcast:
1. Record audio and convert it to a download-friendly format.
2. Create a simple but specialized text file that describes your audio file.
3. Upload everything to the Web.
Yes, yes, yes, if it were that simple, then why is this book so thick? Well, we
admit that this list does gloss over a few details, but a podcast — in its most
streamlined, raw presentation — is that simple. The details of putting together
a podcast start in Chapter 2 and wrap up in Chapter 5; then Chapters 6 and 9
walk you through all the geek-speak you need to accomplish the podcast.
Looking for the bare necessities
You need a few things before starting your first podcast, many of which you
can probably find on your own computer:
 A microphone: Take a look at your computer. Right now, regardless of
whether you have a laptop or desktop model, Windows or Macintosh,
your computer probably has a microphone built into it — or a jack for
plugging in an external mic, and maybe even an included external mic
packaged somewhere with the manuals, cables, and such.
Position the microphone to a comfortable spot on your desk or table. If
you’re using a laptop, position the laptop to a comfortable spot on your
desk or table (make sure you know where the built-in microphone is in
the laptop’s housing).
Usually the built-in microphone in a laptop is located close to the edge
of the keyboard or near the laptop’s speakers. Some models tuck it in at
the center point of the monitor’s base. Consult your user’s manual to
find out where the microphone is hidden on your machine.
 Recording software: Check out the software that came with your com-
puter. You know, all those extra CDs that you filed away, thinking, “I’ll
check those out sometime.” Well, the time has arrived to flip through
them. You probably have some sort of audio-recording software loaded
on your computer, such as RecordIt (Windows) or iMovie (which comes
pre-installed with many new Macs and can record voice as well as video).
If you don’t already have the appropriate software, here’s a fast way to
get it: Download the version of Audacity that fits your operating system
(at audacity.sourceforge.net), shown in Figure 1-1. (Oh, yeah . . .
it’s free.)
15
Chapter 1: Getting the Scoop on Podcasting

 An audio card: Make sure your computer has the hardware it needs to
handle audio recording and the drivers to run the hardware.
Some desktop computers come with a very elementary audio card built
into the motherboard. Before you run out to your local computer vendor
and spring for an audio card, check your computer to see whether it can
already handle basic voice recording.
For tips on choosing the right mic, software, and audio card, be sure to check
out Chapter 2.
Getting and setting up the hardware and software needed to record is a start.
The next step is using it.
Recording your first podcast
When you have your computer set up and your microphone working, it’s time
to start recording. Take a deep breath and then follow these steps:
1. Jot down a few notes on what you want to talk about.
Nothing too fancy — just make an outline that includes remarks about
who you are and what you want to talk about. Use these notes to keep
yourself on track.

Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

All this — the checking of your computer, jotting down notes, and setting
up your recording area — is called preshow prep, discussed in depth in
Chapter 3 by other podcasters who have their own ways of approaching
pre-show prep (all of which can give you some starting points).
2. Click the Record button in your recording software and go for as long
as it takes for you to get through your notes.
We recommend keeping your first recording to no more than 20 minutes.
That may seem like a lot of time, but it will fly by.
3. Give a nice little sign-off (like “Take care of yourselves! See you next
month.”) and click the Stop button.
4. Choose File➪Save As and give your project a name.
Now bask in the warmth of creative accomplishment.
Compressing your audio files
If you’re using an application other than Audacity, you may need to make
your recording into an MP3 file. Many audio players that come with comput-
ers offer the capability to create MP3 files, but if your audio player doesn’t
read or compress audio recordings to MP3 files, you can keep it fed by down-
loading iTunes from www.apple.com/itunes. Check out iTunes in Figure 1-2.
(Even though it’s an Apple product, a Windows version is available as well.)

Chapter 1: Getting the Scoop on Podcasting

After you install iTunes, follow these steps to convert your audio file:
1. Choose File➪Add File to Library.
Or you can press Ú+O (Mac) or Ctrl+O (Windows).
2. Browse for the audio file you want to convert and then click Open.
Your file is now in the iTunes Library.
3. Find the audio file in the iTunes Library and click to select it.
4. Choose Advanced➪Convert Selection to MP3.
Your file is converted to the MP3 format (see Figure 1-3).
Congratulations — you just recorded your first podcast. At least the audio
part of it.
Transferring your audio to the Web
An audio file sitting on your desktop, regardless of how earth-shattering the
contents may be, is not a podcast. Nope, not by a long shot. You have to get 
it up on the World Wide Web and provide a way for listeners’ podcatchers to
grab that tasty file for later consumption.

If you already have a Web server for your blog, company Web site, or 
personal site, this process can be as easy as creating a new folder and 
transferring your newly created audio file to your server via your FTP client
of choice.
If that last paragraph left you puzzled and you’re wondering what kind of
mess you’ve gotten yourself into . . . relax. We don’t leave you hanging out 
in the wind. Chapter 7 covers everything you need to know about choosing 
a Web host for your podcast media files.
Note that we called your audio a podcast media file. Podcasting isn’t just
about audio. On the contrary, you can podcast any sort of media file you like,
even video. Although this book focuses on audio files, you could use all the
tips we give here to handle other types of media files.
After you post the media file, you need to create a specially formatted text file,
usually XML (Extensible Markup Language, explained in detail in Chapter 9),
and move it up to your Web server. This file describes where to find the media
file you just placed on your Web server. This is your podcast feed, and the
special format you use for your text is called RSS 2.0. Listeners to your pod-
cast can subscribe to your show by placing a link to this podcast feed in their
podcatching client.
Yes, we know . . . this sounds really complicated. But we assure you it’s not.
Some hosting companies such as Libsyn (www.libsyn.com) specialize in
taking the technological “bite” out of podcasting so you can focus on creating
your best-sounding show. With Libsyn (shown in Figure 1-4), moving your
audio files to the Web server is as simple as pushing a few buttons, and the
creation of the RSS 2.0 podcast feed and even the accompanying Web page
are automatic.
If you want to take more control over your Web site, podcast media files, and
their corresponding RSS 2.0 feed, turn to the latter chapters of Part III. In those
pages, we walk you through some essentials — not only how to upload a file
but also how to easily generate your RSS 2.0 file using a variety of tools.
Grabbing listeners
With media files in place and an RSS 2.0 feed ready for podcatcher consump-
tion, you’re officially a podcaster. Of course, that doesn’t mean a lot if you’re
the only person who knows about your podcast. You need to spread the word
to let others know that you exist and that you have something pretty darn
important to say.
19
Chapter 1: Getting the Scoop on Podcasting

Creating show notes
Before you pick up a bullhorn, slap a sandwich board over yourself, and start
walking down the street (virtually, anyway), you have to make sure you’re
descriptive enough to captivate those who reach your Web site. First, you’re
going to want to describe the contents of your show to casual online passers-
by in hopes of getting them to listen to what you have to say.
You can easily glance at a blog and get the gist of a conversation, but an
audio file requires active listening to understand, and it’s quite difficult to
skim. In effect, you’re asking people to make an investment of their time in 
listening to you talk, read a story, or play music. You need some compelling
text on a Web page to hook them.
Descriptions of podcast episodes are called show notes, and they are
designed to quickly showcase or highlight the relevant and pertinent con-
tents of the audio file itself. A verbatim transcript of your show isn’t a good
idea, but we do recommend more than simply saying “a show about my day.”
Chapter 8 discusses ways to create your show notes and offers tips and
tricks to give them some punch. (Refer to Figure 1-4 for an example of what
show notes look like on a Web browser.)
Getting listed in directories
When you have a ready media file and a solid set of show notes, you’re ready
to take your podcast message to the masses. You can get listed on some
directories and podcast-listing sites, such as Podcast Pickle and iPodder.org
Figure 1-4:

Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

(explained later in this chapter). Potential listeners visit literally dozens of
Web sites as they seek out new content, and getting yourself listed on as
many as possible can help bring in more new listeners to your program.
A huge listener base is a double-edged sword: More demand for your product
means more of a demand on you and the resources necessary to keep your
podcast up and running. We recommend working on your craft and your
skills, as well as getting a good handle on the personal and technological
requirements of podcasting, before you embark on a huge marketing cam-
paign. Part IV has more details about marketing.
Part IV spends a lot of time talking about the various ways you can attract
more listeners to your show and ways to respond to the ideas and feedback
that your listeners inevitably provide. Many podcasters are surprised at the
sheer volume of comments they receive from their listeners — but when you
consider how personal podcasting is (compared to traditional forms of media
distribution), that’s really not surprising at all.
Now that we’ve finally busted pesky myths about podcasting and given 
you an honest warning about listener demand, we’re going to give a quick
overview of various applications that get MP3 files from Web servers to 
personal players.
Catching a Cast with Your 
Podcatching Client
So you have the MP3 file, some XML, and accompanying show notes. You’re
all set, but ask yourself, “How do podcasts get from the Web to my computer?”
To access all this great, new content, you need a podcatcher, an application
that looks at various RSS feeds, finds the new stuff, and transfers it from the
Internet to your computer automatically. Take a look at some of the different
podcatching clients available for your podcasting needs.
You may think you need an iPod for all kinds of reasons, but you really don’t
need one to podcast. Allow us to state that again: You do not need an iPod to
listen to or create a podcast. As long as you have an MP3 player — be it an
application on a Mac, an application on a PC, or a portable device you can
unplug and take with you — you possess the capability to listen to podcasts.
Depending on the MP3 player, you may even be able to create your podcast
on the device as well — but to listen, all you need is a device that can play
audio files.

Chapter 1: Getting the Scoop on Podcasting

The catcher that started it all: iPodder
iPodder (shown in Figure 1-5) was created by Adam Curry (yes, the former
MTV VJ and no, we’re not kidding). It promotes itself as an open-source (free
to use) application that downloads audio files from RSS feeds of your choice
directly to your Mac or PC. You can then sync your portable player with your
computer’s media player, and now you’re podcasting-on-the-go.
Download iPodder from ipodder.sourceforge.net. After you install it, sub-
scribing to feeds is a simple process. Follow these steps if you don’t have a
specific podcast in mind:
1. Click the Podcast Directory tab.
iPodder comes preloaded with a variety of the more popular directories
of podcasts.
2. Navigate through the directory structure.
Click the name of the directory to see the choices offered. In some
cases, you may need to click a subdirectory to see additional podcasts.

3. Double-click the name of a podcast.
You can also single-click the name of the podcast and then click the Add
button near the top.
4. Click Save.
That’s it! You’ve just subscribed to your first podcast with iPodder.
Of course, you don’t have to navigate through the list of podcasts. Follow
these steps if you have a specific podcast in mind:
1. Click the little green button with a plus symbol on it.
You find this button on the Subscriptions panel.
2. Type the URL of the feed in the Add a Feed window.
Hopefully, you copied the URL and can simply paste it in. If not, be very
careful with your typing!
Congrats! You now know how to use iPodder to subscribe to any podcasts
you happen to come across in the future.
Stepping up your game with iPodderX
Shortly after iPodder came on the scene, developers August Trometer and
Ray Slakinski raised the bar for podcatching clients across both platforms
with their own creation iPodderX (shown in Figure 1-6), a podcatching client
(also known by its more geeky name, an aggregator) that promised to do a lot
more than just download audio files. And it delivers.
iPodderX (available for download at www.ipodderx.com) began modestly
enough as a simple aggregator but now offers the following features:
 Accesses and displays all HTML, links, and images that accompany the
podcast post (called show notes).
 Retrieves any enclosed media file, not just MP3 files.
 Manages files for both iTunes and iPhoto, via Playlist Builder.
 Offers SmartSpace, a feature that deletes old podcasts from your hard
drive according to the parameters you set. (It also has a safeguard fea-
ture that allows you to recover any deleted podcasts you want to
archive.)
23
Chapter 1: Getting the Scoop on Podcasting

Though originally this aggregator was available only to Mac users, iPodderX
is now available for Windows users as well, making it an affordable option for
people looking for a podcatcher that goes above and beyond the simple
downloading of MP3 files.
To subscribe to a podcast using iPodderX, simply follow these steps when
you’ve identified a podcast you want to subscribe to:
1. In your browser, Control+click (Mac) or right-click (Windows) the pod-
cast link and choose Options➪Copy Link.
2. In iPodderX, click the Add a Subscription Feed icon.
This icon looks like a newspaper with a plus sign and is located in the
top-left corner of the iPodder interface, as shown in Figure 1-6.
The Subscription window appears, showing the link you copied (in Step 1)
filled in the Subscription Feed URL box.
3. Click the Downloads tab.
4. Choose to download the most recent podcast or all available files
from the File Catch Up drop-down menu.

5. Enter the name of the show in the Custom Folder/Playlist text box.
Dragon Page Cover to Cover, as well as Area 51 and EarthCore by Scott
Sigler, are examples.
6. Click the Add button.
iPodderX automatically checks the feed and begins downloading 
content.
The 800-pound gorilla called iTunes
With the launch of iTunes v4.9, podcasting went from what the geeks were
doing in the basement of the Science Building to the next wave of innovation
on the Internet (which was, of course, developed by the geeks in the base-
ment of the Science Building). As always, a step into the mainstream market
brought some dismay; the hardcore, independent podcasters considered
this a sad day for podcasting as corporate entities (sponsored by Disney,
ESPN, BBC, and so on) dominated the iTunes Music Store podcast directory
(shown in Figure 1-7). What about the indie podcasts — the ones that started
it all? Would they be forgotten? Go unnoticed? Languish unsubscribed? Well,
at first, it seemed that many of the original groundbreakers that the podcast-
ing community knew and loved (The Dawn and Drew Show, Tokyo Calling,
Catholic Insider, Slice of Scifi) might get lost in the stampede. But not yet, as
it turns out.
Apple’s iTunes (available for download at www.itunes.com) works as a pod-
catching client. It lends an automatic hand to those who don’t know where 
to find aggregators, where to find blogs that host podcasts, and which pod-
cast directories list the shows that fit their needs and desires — now they 
too can enjoy a wide range of podcast choices.
With iTunes, podcasting reached into the mainstream markets around the
world. (And if that doesn’t make you go “Wow!” consider this: On August 4,
2005, iTunes launched in Japan. Within four days, the iTunes Music Store 
had 1 million downloads. Sony’s own MP3 download service averages under
500,000 downloads a month.) Instead of dealing with third-party applications,
Apple iTunes is a one-stop shop for all your podcasting needs.
It gets even better: Subscribing to a podcast with iTunes is just as easy as
with the iPodder and iPodderX methods. Follow these steps to do so:
1. In the iTunes Music Store, click the Podcasts link located in the top
section of the left column.
You can also click the Podcast icon located in the center of the Featured
Artists section.
25
Chapter 1: Getting the Scoop on Podcasting

2. Find the podcast of your choice.
You can do that by clicking its name in the iTunes Music Store or by per-
forming a search using the iTunes Music/Podcast search engine in the
top-right corner of the iTunes screen.
3. When you get to the podcast page (and available podcasts) in iTunes,
click the Subscribe button.
If you’re using iTunes for the first time to subscribe to a feed, you get a
confirmation message. You can select the Do Not Ask About Subscribing
Again option to avoid this message.
iTunes immediately takes you from the Music Store to your Podcasts list
and gives you the progress of the download.
After your podcast has finished downloading, you can create a playlist for
your podcast and organize your downloads accordingly.
Options, options, and more options
Of course, everyone’s tastes and styles are different, and there are plenty
more options for podcatching clients. Maybe you’re using Mac, Windows, or
an entirely different operating system. Maybe you don’t want to install any
Figure 1-7:

26
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

new software on your system, or maybe you just like to be different. Hey,
that’s okay! You too can be a podcast listener:
 Doppler: Designed exclusively for the Windows platform, Doppler
(dopplerradio.net) has a strong contingent of dedicated users who
are perfectly happy with the features it offers. Additionally, it seems to
be a pretty rock-solid piece of software, and it’s available for free.
 Nimiq: Nimiq (nimiq.nl) has been described as an exercise in simplic-
ity. It does what it does (that is, download podcast media files) very
well. Some folks looking for advanced features (such as downloading
BitTorrent files) are switching from iPodder to this little jewel.
 Odeo: But what if you can’t (or don’t want to) install podcatching soft-
ware on your system? Odeo (odeo.com) allows you to subscribe to any
podcast in its directory without putting any software on your desktop.
Instead, podcast media files are assembled and made available so you
can listen to them at the click of a button.
 Podnova: Podnova (podnova.com) is another service that tracks pod-
cast content, yet doesn’t require you to download any software to your
desktop. As with Odeo, you have the option to download some software
so files can be transferred to your MP3 player, but it’s nice to know that
some services don’t require this step.
We’ve glossed over quite a few advanced features of Odeo and Podnova, 
and probably have not done justice to Nimiq or Doppler. And of course, 
additional clients and services provide similar-yet-distinct capabilities. But
an attempt at a comprehensive list would be instantly obsolete, so this quick
list simply offers a rough idea of how far the limits of podcasting currently
extend. Bottom line: At this point, you should easily be able to subscribe to
the podcasts of your choice.
Now that you’ve got your podcatching client, it’s now time to take a good
listen as to what is happening in the podcasting community. Many podcatch-
ing clients have internal directories of podcasts, accessing their listings from
another directory or listing site maintained elsewhere on the Internet. Other
aggregators maintain their own lists based on how many listeners have used
their podcatcher to subscribe to particular shows.
So where are these directories? Fire up your browser and, as Edgar Winter
says, “Come on and take a free ride. . . .”
As you can see, it’s pretty darn easy to find podcasts — and to fill up your
player of choice pretty quickly. Listen to some shows for inspiration. When
you find one that makes you think, “I can do a podcast at least that good,”
consider it an invitation to do just that. (Good thing you’ve got this book.)
27
Chapter 1: Getting the Scoop on Podcasting

Quest for Podcasts
If you’re going to podcast (and with you picking up this book, it’s a safe
assumption that the interest is strong), it’s a good idea to take a look around
the podcasting community and see what other podcasters are doing. We give
you a few places to get started in this section — directories, podcast-listing
services, and even podcast-specific search engines. (Check out the various
sources mentioned in Chapter 10 as well.)
iPodder.org
The directory that started it all, iPodder.org (ipodder.org), is a volunteer-
supported directory of podcasts. It consists of various categories managed
by individuals with particular interests in given categories.
iPodder.org is a bare-bones site. You won’t find detailed descriptions about
the podcasts, sample episodes, or any sort of ratings. Instead, you find many
direct links to podcast feeds — and those can easily be fed to your pod-
catcher of choice. Find the category you like, start subscribing, and then
listen.
iPodder is very much an open directory. Not only can anyone contribute
shows, but also programmers with OPML experience can repurpose the con-
tents of the directory into applications and other directory services. Because
of this capability, most of the podcaster directories use the information in
iPodder.org to help build (at least in part) their own directories of podcasts.
Podcast Alley
If iPodder.org was the first place to hang your podcasting hat, Podcast Alley
(podcastalley.com) is the first place to boast, brand, and generally beat
your chest about it. With incredibly active forums, detailed descriptions 
of podcasts, and individual episodes — plus the majority of all podcasters
clamoring to get their listeners to “VOTE FOR ME ON PODCAST ALLEY THIS
MONTH!” — it’s no wonder that Podcast Alley is the most active podcast 
listing and ratings service to date.
Along with iPodder.org, Podcast Alley is owned by PodShow, the family of pod-
casts and services produced by Adam Curry and crew. This close affiliation
with podcasting services and the podcasts themselves has some podcaster
pundits crying foul. While we agree this provides fertile ground for some 
less-than-ethical activities when it comes to promoting podcasts, we honestly
haven’t seen that sort of thing going on.
28
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

Podcast Pickle
Gary Leland and the crew at Podcast Pickle (podcastpickle.com) take a
slightly different approach for listeners to find the podcasts they’re looking
for. Their best innovation, in our opinion, is the Favorites listing. Rather than
rely on voting as a measure of popularity, the Pickle allows registered mem-
bers to mark as many shows as they like as their favorites. The more people
who have marked a show as Favorite, the higher up on the Favorites list a
podcast is. A neat idea!
But that’s a lot like a popularity contest; you have no way to judge how well
you might like a show just because a bunch of other people do. That’s why
Podcast Pickle also allows you to browse by category or search for relevant
keywords that mean something to you. Like Podcast Alley, it also has an
active forum section where you can see what other folks are saying about a
particular podcast before you subscribe.
Yahoo.com Audio search
Browsing through lists and weighing your options, using the relative popular-
ity of shows as a measuring stick, are great starting points — but this is the
Internet we’re talking about here. When you’re looking for something in
cyberspace, you likely do one thing first: Run a search.
In late summer 2005, Yahoo! rolled out its audio-specific search engine at
audio.search.yahoo.com. While Yahoo! wasn’t the first in the space (see
Chapter 10 for other options), it certainly has the potential to be the biggest,
having been a pioneer in search-based technology for years.
There are so many directories for podcasts that Rob Walch of podCast411 has
put together a “directory of directories” (podcast411.com/page2.html). As
of this writing, 66 different directories are listed!

ow that you’re effectively hip as to what podcasting is and what it’s all
about, you need to start building your studio. This studio can come in a
variety of shapes, sizes, and price tags. What you’re thinking about doing —
podcasting — is like any hobby you pursue. If it’s something to pass the time
and try out to see if you like it, then perhaps you’ll want to keep your setup
simple. If you find yourself tapping into a passion you did not know was deep
inside you, you might want to upgrade to bigger, better, and badder equipment.
If you suddenly decide you — yes, you — are the greatest new sensation
to hit the podcasting arena since Adam Curry, you’ll quickly find yourself
soundproofing the basement and looking at industry-standard equipment
that might require some extra homework to master.
This is the beauty of podcasting. In the long run, it doesn’t matter if your pod-
casting studio is an iPod with a plug-in microphone or comprised of the latest
mixing boards, audio software, and recording equipment. Both approaches to
podcasting work and are successfully implemented on a variety of podcasts.
So which one works best for what you have in mind? That’s what we take a
look at in this chapter, discussing the options, advantages, and disadvantages
of each setup.

Finding the Right Mic
It’s surprisingly easy and affordable to make your computer podcast-capable.
Your first order of business is to find the right mic. If you already have a
microphone built in to your laptop (and you don’t mind starting out basic),
you can just download Audacity (described later in the chapter) and take
advantage of its free cost. That’s all there is to it! (For openers, anyway.)
However, if your desktop computer didn’t come with a mic (or you’re just not
happy hunching over your laptop like Quasimodo), you’re going to want to
shop around for a new microphone. When shopping for a mic, consider the
following criteria:
 What’s your price range? In many cases, especially with “cheap” mics,
you get what you pay for in quality of construction and range of capabili-
ties. You want the most affordable model of microphone that will do the
job for you and your podcast.
 Do you plan to use the mic primarily in the studio or on location?
A high-end shockmounted model isn’t the best choice for a walk in the
park, and a lapel mic might not provide you with the quality of sound
expected for an in-studio podcast. Before you purchase your mic, con-
sider your podcasting location needs.
 What do you want this mic to do? Record sound? Yeah, okay, but what
kind and in what surroundings? Some mics offer ease of handling for
interviews. Some are good at snagging specific outdoor sounds. Others
may be better at capturing live music. You need to consider multipur-
pose mics, guest mics, and on-location recording devices, or any kind 
of condition your podcast provides for you.
The sections that follow give you the lowdown on the mic that’s right for
your budget.
Mics on the cheap
Most of the economical microphones on the market utilize USB (Universal
Serial Bus) hookups. Figure 2-1 shows two types of USB plugs, which you may
have used for attaching a digital camera or an MP3 player. You can go online
to any of the computer equipment retailers and type USB microphones in
their respective search engines. Make sure you include USB, because a search
for microphones can bring up many more alternatives, including video cam-
eras, high-end mics (which we talk about next), and other devices that might
be way out of your budget.
32
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

High end is relative. Professional recording studios can spend hundreds of
dollars on a single microphone. Fortunately, the MP3 format isn’t so finicky;
as a rule, high end for a podcasting mic tops out at less than $100.
When shopping for microphones, you’ll hear a lot of terminology like omnidi-
rectional and unidirectional. These multisyllabic words may look cool to type
and are impressive to say; but when you read them or they are spoken to
you, they can be a little intimidating. We’re going to demystify many of these
terms and explain how effective these various mic types are for podcasting.
Omnidirectional mics
Most microphones that come preinstalled in laptops are omnidirectional —
they pick up sounds from all directions at once. The iPod accessory iTalk
(from Griffin Technologies, starting at around $32) is an omnidirectional
microphone. Omnidirectional mics pick up your voice, along with the televi-
sion in the background, the traffic outside, the rustling of clothes, the ceiling
fan . . . basically if it makes noise and is within range of the mic, it’s recorded.
While omnidirectional mics are ideal for soundseeing tours such as Tokyo
Calling (tokyocalling.org/) or Bicyclemark’s Communiqué (www.bicycle
mark.org/), they may not be ideal for all in-studio podcasting because they
don’t respond to sound with quality — even when your mouth is so close
that your lips brush against the mic’s screen. They tend to add a sharp, tinny
quality to your voice and cut out on harsh, sudden sounds such as consonants
(especially ps and ts). That’s partly because basic omnidirectional mics vary
widely in quality and partly because of the limits imposed by their construc-
tion. The built-in models, for instance, are sometimes crammed into leftover
nooks in their devices, where they are awkward to use and can pick up inter-
nal noise. It’s no wonder they tend to be tiny and lo-fi.
Unidirectional mics
Unidirectional mics, unlike their omnidirectional brethren, pick up sound from
only one direction: the direction they’re pointing in. If you want to know
Figure 2-1:
The USB
ports and
connectors
on both the
computer
and the mic.
33
Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

exactly what a unidirectional mic is and what it can do, take a look at the Brian
DePalma film, Blow Out. John Travolta plays a foley artist, a guy who collects
random sound effects and then sweetens them for particular moments in what-
ever film he’s working on. One night, he takes a stroll through the park with 
a “gun microphone,” a type of unidirectional mic that only picks up sounds
located where it is pointing. This microphone is so particular that it concen-
trates on recording along the line of sight — so it records not only the sound 
of a tire blowing out but also the gunshot that causes it to happen.
Blow Out hinges on what a unidirectional microphone does: record sounds
from one direction only. And this is what makes the unidirectional mic such
an important piece of equipment in your podcast. This type of mic is a good
choice for podcasting because surrounding sounds are filtered out and only
the sound directed to it is picked up. For in-studio podcasting, interviews,
and quality recording, unidirectional microphones are the best option.
One omnidirectional mic that we recommend is the eMic (www.gembird.us/
html/emic.htm). It currently retails for about $25.99 and is compatible with
both the Mac and Windows platforms. Find a USB port on your Mac or PC,
plug in this microphone, and push a button. Your microphone is on and ready
for recording.
When shopping for a good unidirectional USB microphone, you’ll want to
make sure the accessory detail mentions that it has noise-canceling technol-
ogy, which filters out background noise. You’ll want your USB microphone to
do this, especially if you’re planning to do interviews or record on-location
commentary. Of course, if you’re constantly on the go with your podcast,
whether you’re using an iPod with iTalk or a digital audio recorder, this type
of filter is nonexistent (so far anyway).
You might be tempted to purchase a USB headset when you purchase your
new mic. Okay, hands-free convenience is a plus, but having a headset
grouped with your microphone isn’t all you need to monitor yourself auto-
matically as you record. To self-monitor your own voice, you need software
that offers you an on-screen mixer, a mixing board, or the ability to monitor
yourself as you record.
Investing in a high-end mic
Remember the opening of The Blues Brothers? Jake (John Belushi) turns to
Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) after looking over the “new used” car his brother is
driving, and asks him what happened to their Cadillac. “I traded it,” Elwood
replies, “for a microphone.” Jake leans forward, a little stunned. “You traded
the Bluesmobile . . . for a microphone?!?” Then, on reflection, he nods. “All
right, I can see that.”

Nothing like a movie analogy to drive home a point, but . . . don’t offer up
your car for trade just yet. There are plenty of high-quality microphones out
there that pick up nuances and details that a simple USB microphone doesn’t
and are still affordable.
What sets these microphones apart from their USB counterparts (described
in the previous section) is they are cardioid (heart-shaped) in their pickup
pattern, as shown in Figure 2-2. They pick up sound from a wider area than
the USB unidirectional microphone can but narrower than what an omnidi-
rectional mic takes in. They’re also the mics most widely used for stage 
productions. Higher-end versions of these microphones are so sensitive
that they come with shockmounts — spring-loaded frames that “suspend”
the mic when attached to a microphone stand, providing better reception
while reducing any noise or vibration from your microphone stand. Think of
a shockmount as a shock absorber for your mic.
These shockmounted mics also capture sound better than unidirectional USB
mics because they interpret sound in a slightly separate fashion. Condenser
microphones are constructed with two plates, one fixed and the other vibrated
by sound. The distance between the fixed plate and vibrating one changes
based on the incoming acoustics, and varying electrical currents become inter-
preted as voice. The end result: Condenser mics (because they emulate how
human vocal chords work) can reproduce a more genuine representation of
vocals, acoustic instruments, and ambiance, making them the ideal micro-
phones for in-studio podcasts. Figure 2-3 shows a condenser microphone.
We recommend the MXL 990 Cardioid Condenser Mic with Shockmount
(www.mxlmics.com), which retails for around $70.

Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

When you purchase a higher-end microphone, keep in mind that you proba-
bly will receive no instruction manual, no additional cables for hook up, a
jack that does not fit into your computer, and no stand. That’s because you’re
upgrading to professional equipment. The manufacturer is assuming that you
already have the tools, bells and whistles, and extra do-dads to make this mic
work for you. For the lowdown on what accessories you need to hook up
your new mic to your computer, check out the “Accessorize! Accessorize!
Accessorize!” section later in this chapter.

The phantom (power) of the podcast
You might notice that some mics (such as the
MXL described in this chapter) are phantom
powered — their connection to the mixer pro-
vides them with all the power they need. This is
a very good thing and can save you a lot of
money and headaches in the future. Condenser
mics need an extra little electrical kick to
receive audio at their full potential. You can use
batteries to power those mics, but when they
start to die, so does your recording quality. (A
word to the wise: Always check your mic’s bat-
tery level before you interview and have fresh
batteries on hand.) Because phantom power
comes from the mixing board through the cable
connecting to the mic, it supplies a constant
boost — no battery worries.

Expanding Your Studio
If you’re podcasting on a shoestring budget, all you really need is a basic
microphone and some audio software (several types of which are described
in this chapter) to record. But if you have the financial resources and the
desire, you can expand your computer’s audio setup by making the invest-
ment in a mixing board, a new audio card, and additional accessories, as
described in the following sections.
Podcasts well with others: Mixing boards
Along with a microphone stand (which can set you back no more than $8 or
thereabouts), you need a mixing board, such as the Behringer Eurorack UB802
Mixer shown in Figure 2-4. You see mixing boards at rock concerts and in
“behind the scenes” documentaries for film and the recording industry. They
come in all shapes and sizes, and this section looks at a good typical starter
unit that offers features for the podcaster working solo or with friends. What a
mixing board does for your podcast is open up the recording options, such as
multiple microphones, recording acoustic instruments, and balancing sound
to emphasize one voice over another or balance both seamlessly.

Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

First off, let’s demystify this contraption called the mixing board. The easiest
way to look at a mixing board is you’re partitioning your computer into differ-
ent recording studios, but instead of calling them studios, we are calling these
partitions tracks.
A simple mixing board provides two mono tracks and two stereo tracks, and
you can use any of those tracks for input or output of audio signals — the
unit’s outrageously versatile. If you’re podcasting solo or with a friend, you
can hook up two condenser mics so you won’t have to huddle around the
same microphone or slide it back and forth as you take turns speaking.
You may also be wondering about all those wacky knobs on a mixing board.
These knobs deal with various frequencies in your voice and can deepen,
sharpen, or soften the qualities of your voice, and perhaps even help filter
out surrounding white noise (which is the sound of an empty room and noth-
ing more, unless you’re psychic . . .). The knobs on the mixing board that are
your primary concern are the white ones that control your volume or levels,
as the board labels them. The higher the level, the more input signal your
voice gains when recording. If one of your tracks is being used for output, 
the level dictates how loud the playback through your headphones is.
Heavy-metal legends Spinal Tap may prefer sound equipment that “goes to 11,”
but cranking your mixing board way up and leaving it that way won’t do your
podcast much good. The best way to handle sound is to set your levels before
podcasting. That is what is going on when you see roadies at a concert do a
mic check. The oh-so-familiar “Check one, check two, check-check-check . . .”
is one way of setting your levels, but a better method is just rambling on as if
you were podcasting, and then adjusting your sound levels according to your
recording application’s volume unit (VU) meter. For more on setting levels, hop
to Chapter 4 for all the details.
Accessorize! Accessorize! Accessorize! 
A microphone and a mixing board are just the beginning when it comes to
putting together your audio suite. You now need, as Martha Stewart would no
doubt tell you if she were helping you with this process, to add in the final
touches. Now when it comes to accessories, Martha might make suggestions
like a doily for the mic stand or a sweet, hand-knitted cover for the mixer.
When we talk about accessories, we have something different in mind. Here
are some optional add-on’s that will help you produce a rock solid podcast:
 Headphones: After shelling out $50 for a mixing board, you might also
want to think about purchasing a nice pair of headphones. Headphones
help you monitor yourself as you speak. That may seem a little indul-
gent, but by hearing your voice, you can catch before playback any odd
trip-ups, slurred words, or missed pronunciations. 
38
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

Another advantage with headphones is they have better sound quality
than your computer’s speakers as well as reduce ambient noise around
you. There are those Bose Noise Reduction stereo headphones you see
advertised on television, but if you want to keep it simple, pick up a
good pair of headphones for around $30. They’ll work just as well for a
podcast. Make sure the headphone cable ends in a 1⁄4-inch stereo male
jack (as shown in Figure 2-5); that’s what plugs in to your mixing board.
 Cords: As mentioned in the “Investing in a high-end mic” section earlier
in the chapter, your newfangled microphone may arrive without any
cords — and buying the wrong cord can be easy if you don’t know jack
(so to speak). So check the mic’s connector before you buy. With high-end
condenser mics, the connectors aren’t the typical RCA prongs; instead,
you use a three-prong connection: a 3-pin XLR male plug. It connects to a
3-pin XLR female plug, as shown in Figure 2-6.
To plug a microphone into your mixer, you want to specify a 3-pin XLR-to-
XLR male-to-female cord; the female end connects to the mic, the male
end to the mixer. This adds another $9 to $15 to your outlay, depending
on the length of the cord. (If your mixer has 1⁄4-inch mic inputs, you can
get a 3-pin XLR female-to-1⁄4-inch male, but XLR-to-XLR yields better
results — provided your mixer has the needed female XLR jack.)

Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

 Microphone windscreens: Go to Radio Shack or any music store and
ask for microphone windscreens (shown in Figure 2-7). You may pick up a
bag of five (all different colors) for less than $10. Windscreens reduce
that amateurish-sounding popping and hissing on consonants, and cut
out some ambient noise the microphone would otherwise pick up.
It’s in the cards: Purchasing 
and installing an audio card
At the core of this podcasting recipe is your computer. Apples and Windows,
Mac and PCs, there is no bias here. So don’t let the screen captures from the
sweet Mac Daddy setup throw you. To quote the creepy medium from
Poltergeist, “All are welcome! ALL ARE WELCOME! Go into the light. . . .”
This audio investment may still need one more ingredient that completes the
connection to your Mac or PC: an audio card. Sure, digital audio equipment
tends to come with a FireWire or USB port these days, but if your mixing
board doesn’t have one (and some still don’t), and your microphone doesn’t
look like it’ll connect to any ports that look familiar on your computer, you
probably need an audio card.
There is a difference between a sound card and an audio card. A sound card
allows your Mac or PC to play and record basic sound. This isn’t the highest
quality of sound in many cases, and the sound card that came with your Mac
or PC is built primarily to play music and those goofy alert sounds. Audio

cards, on the other hand, allow you to output to other external devices and
provide ports for input such as hi-fi components, mixing boards, and MIDI
keyboards. Audio cards also generate higher quality output than default
sound cards.
Audio cards are designed to fit into PCI slots (those empty slots inside
your computer) and offer red-and-white female jacks similar to the back of
stereo components. It’s no surprise then that they are RCA jacks, as shown in
Figure 2-8. These jacks control the left and right channels of sound coming
in and out of your hi-fi equipment. After you’ve installed the audio card in an
available PCI slot in your computer, you’ve given it the same capabilities.
Finding the right PCI audio card
When shopping for a PCI audio card, keep the following points in mind:
 Make sure the audio card is compatible with your computer’s operating
system in the version your machine uses. Just because the card says
it’s Macintosh- or Windows-compatible doesn’t make it a shoe-in for
Windows XP or Mac OS X Tiger. Check the card manufacturer’s Web 
site and find out whether you need to download the latest driver for 
the card. The driver helps the computer recognize this new card in 
its PCI slot and set up an interface with it.
 Make sure the card offers at least two sets of analog jacks (the red-and-
white RCA jacks described in the preceding section).
For our money, one cost-effective card for podcasting is the Audiophile 2496
PCI Digital Audio Card from M-Audio (www.m-audio.com); it costs around
$99. This simple, basic audio card (shown in Figure 2-9) offers two Analog In
and two Analog Out jacks. The M-Audio driver that comes included may need
to be upgraded after you purchase the card (new, improved drivers are always
coming out). Refer to the manufacturer’s Web site for details.

Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

Installing a PCI audio card into your computer
Now, it’s a pretty safe bet that some of you out there have opened up your
computer and installed a wide variety of stuff — internal hard drives, CD or
DVD drives, and of course, audio cards — with never a worry, hardly a con-
cern. Right?
But some of you may imagine confronting the forbidden interior of your 
computer and suddenly have a tough time reading this page as the book
starts shaking in your trembling hands. (Just kidding. Of course we are.) If
you worry about doing expensive damage to the innards of your computer
(heck, we’ve known people who won’t even look in there lest they break
something), breathe easy: You’re about to find out just how easy (and safe) 
it is to upgrade your computer. Make sure you have three things handy —
this book, a Phillips-head screwdriver, and something metallic to touch —
and you can save yourself a few bucks on upgrade fees.
For those of you iMac users who are trying to figure out where your PCI slots
are, sorry, but it’s no use pulling out your hair in frustration. iMacs don’t
have any PCI slots. While inexpensive and super-sleek in their design, iMacs
were built for affordability, not expansion.
To install an audio card into your Mac or PC desktop computer, follow these
steps:
1. Shut down your computer.

iRiver: The new players in podcasting
The idea of “podcasting to go” had a lot of limits
hemming it in at one time, ranging from how
mobile the studio could be to figuring out
whether the right conditions existed for an iMic
to pick up the podcaster’s voice clearly. This
was before the arrival of the iRiver — a light-
weight, unobtrusive, all-in-one solution for
portable-podcast recording.
All the products created by iRiver (www.
iriveramerica.com) specialize in playback
of MP3 files, providing stiff competition for
Apple’s iPod, but with iRiver’s ultra-portable
players, the company is targeting many of the
podcasters who specialize in soundseeing
tours. Starting at under $100, the iRiver records
up to 16 hours of voice with its built-in micro-
phone, recording directly into an MP3 format, at
32 kHz. (Its latest model, the T-series, offers a
full-color display, extended battery life, and
faster exchange of music from computer to
player. Unfortunately the T-10 operates only on
the Windows XP operating system. For Mac and
other Windows platform users, the iRiver iFP-
series pictured here is still the model of choice.)
Weighing no more than a set of car keys and
coming with a sport arm band or neck strap, the
iRiver has taken the podosphere by storm,
becoming the must-have, one-step solution to
portable podcasting. Recordings can immedi-
ately be imported into Audacity and edited for
podcasting purposes, making iRiver a very
appealing option if you want to take your show
outside your studio or (for first-time podcasters)
give your podcasting talents a try before making
an investment in a full-blown audio studio.

2. Unplug any peripheral components (power supply, external hard
drives, monitors, and so on).
Clear a space and pull your computer out into the open so you have
room to work.
3. Open up your computer.
On your PC, unscrew the casing from the back and slide it off.
For the Mac, lift the side-switch and lower the motherboard (Mac G4), or
slide the casing away from its housing (Mac G5).
When the housing is exposed, there is a danger of static electricity jump-
ing between you, your tools, and your computer. A small static spark
won’t do more to you than sting a little, but it can easily fry your entire
hard drive. Now that we’ve put a Biblical fear into you, calm down. Simply
find that grounded metallic item we told you to have on hand and touch it.
If possible, try the next few steps with one hand on the metallic item and
the other with the Phillips-head screwdriver to ensure you’re grounded.
4. Unscrew from the housing the metal shields located next to the avail-
able PCI slot where you’re going to install your audio card, as shown
in Figure 2-10.
Figure 2-10:
This
diagram
illustrates
how to
unscrew
one of the
metal
shields 
from the
unoccupied
PCI slot.
44
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

Set the screws aside (you’ll need them in a few moments), and place the
metal shield in whatever box you use to keep the “extra unused parts” of
your computer.
5. Line up the audio card with the PCI slot and push it into the PCI slot
until the card snaps into place.
You need both hands for this step, so let go of that metallic object we
mentioned earlier.
6. With the screw taken from the slot shield (and another hand on the
metallic object used for grounding), secure the audio card into the slot.
7. Replace the housing of your computer.
8. Put the unit back into its place, reconnect all accessories, and note
which audio jacks are In and Out.
9. Plug the corresponding RCA cables into your audio card and mixing
board.
10. Start up your computer.
Now comes the part where you install or download and install drivers into
your computer so it recognizes and activates the card as part of its opera-
tions. With your computer seeing the hardware and what it has to work with,
all you need now is some software.
The steps depicted here work for a desktop model. For you laptop podcast-
ers who would like to take advantage of a mixing board, your options are not
only limited, but also often less cost-effective. One option is to invest in an
audio PCMIA card. Some exist, but the majority of them are built for MIDI
devices. Another option is to hook up a Canopus Analog-to-DV converter to
your FireWire/IEEE-1394 port (you can find out more about these devices at
www.canopus.us/) and use only the audio jacks for the feed. Griffin and 
M-Audio accessories can record analog audio through either USB or 
FireWire ports.
The Audacity of That GarageBand 
and Its Audio Hijack Pro: 
Audio-Editing Software
After you have your recording equipment in place, plugged in, and running,
it’s time to take a look at audio-editing software packages. These are the appli-
cations that help you take that block of audio marble and chisel the podcast
that is hidden within it.
45
Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

As with digital photo editors, DVD authoring software, and word processors,
software for audio comes in all sizes and all costs, ranging from free to
roughly an entire paycheck (or three). Like any software package, the lower
the cost, the simpler the product and the easier it is to understand, navigate,
and use for recording. However, as the software grows more complex (and
expensive), the features that offer advantages for pro-level work become
abundantly clear. The following sections run down some of the software that
might be right for you.
Audacity: Who says you can’t 
get something for nothing?
Audacity (shown in Figure 2-11) is a piece of software that quickly became
a podcaster’s best friend. It’s easy to see why; it’s free and simple to use.
It’s available for downloading at audacity.sourceforge.net.
Designed by volunteers who simply wanted to “give back to the Internet”
something cool, Audacity was initially designed for a variety of audio capabil-
ities such as importing, mixing, editing, and exporting audio. For podcasters,
it provides an optimum tool for recording voice straight off a computer.
Another big plus with Audacity is its compatibility with Windows, Macintosh,
and Linux. (We want to send a big thank you to the volunteers who went out
of their way to show that yes, software can be made available for any plat-
form, provided the creators are driven enough to make it happen!)
But what can a free piece of software do? Well, for openers, Audacity . . .
 Records live audio through microphones or mixer channels
 Can record up to 16 channels at once
 Imports various sound formats for editing and remixing
 Exports final projects to WAV, AIFF, AU, and MP3s
 Grants the user unlimited Undo and Redo commands
 Can create an unlimited number of audio tracks
 Removes static, hiss, hum, and other constant background noises
 Offers effects such as Echo, Phaser, Wahwah, Reverse (and these effects
are expandable via third-party plug-ins)
 Records at an audio quality of up to 96 kHz
And then there’s a serious bonus: Audacity can digitize analog audio from
cassette tapes and vinyl records, a feature found in many commercial audio-
editing software packages. For a free piece of software, this is one impressive
download.
46
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

Make sure you access the right URL. Remember that the Web site for Audacity
is audacity.sourceforge.net and not www.audacity.com. If you happen 
to type in the latter address, you find yourself at Audacity, Inc., a Seattle,
Washington–based janitorial service.
Audacity is an excellent piece of software for the basics, but what if you desire
more control over the capabilities and features of your audio-editing package?
Are you looking for more recording options, additional audio filters, built-in
multitrack recording and pre-recorded music loops? (Gads, what some people
will do to set a mood or a tone for a podcast.) Coming right up . . .
Cakewalk for the PC: This 
podcasting stuff is easy!
The Cakewalk application (www.cakewalk.com) comes in various shapes and
sizes, but the PC podcaster is likely to have two favorite flavors: Cakewalk
Home Studio 2 and Home Studio 2XL. Cakewalk Home Studio 2 (which retails
for around $99) offers the extra bells and whistles that Audacity doesn’t,
while Home Studio 2 XL (around $159) offers even more features than Home
Studio 2.
Figure 2-11:

Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

Cakewalk (shown in Figure 2-12) offers its users some serious goodies:
 Support for Project5, Kinetic, Reason, and other ReWire synths
 Simultaneous recording of unlimited audio and MIDI tracks for multi-
channel audio cards
 Recording up to 24-bit/96 kHz audio
 Mixing of real-time audio and MIDI effects
 Support for MP3, WAV, WMA, and MIDI files
The software package includes additional applications for musicians (such as
Notation and EDIROL Virtual Sound Canvas DXi) that allow users to compose,
print, and produce music loops and original music beds. Of course, if your
musical talent doesn’t extend much beyond your CD collection or iTunes
playlists, then Home Studio 2XL is a better investment, simply for the addi-
tional CD: PowerFX Dyad DXi Sampler & Sample Library. Between the easy
audio editing and engineering (with Dyad DXi) and the collection of original
audio samples, it’s a breeze to compose your own themes and music loops.

Cakewalk is a popular audio package for the PC, but what about Mac users?
For those of us in the minority of the computer world, it’s always a frustra-
tion to hear software developers say, “No, we won’t be making this product
available for Mac users.” Sometimes we seem to be denied the coolest
toys and utilities because they just aren’t offered for our operating system
(maybe a penalty for thinking differently, but still . . .).
Apparently Steve Jobs and his crew heard about this injustice, and shortly
after the iPod took off came a gem that made it more-than-cool to be a Mac
user — especially one who’s into podcasting. We Mac-using podcasters call
this gem GarageBand, introduced to you in the next section.
GarageBand: Moby in your Mac!
With hundreds of music loops that can easily switch from one instrument to
another, GarageBand (shown in Figure 2-13) makes royalty-free music easy-to-
compose. Many of the loops are editable and, with a bit of tweaking, can set
the right mood for your podcast. With the release of iLife ’05, GarageBand is
now up to version 2 and has a few new additions (and one blessed repair) to
enhance its initial version:
 The multitrack recording feature can handle eight tracks at once.
 You can see a display of the music, with actual notation, in real time.
 You can change the tempo and key of user-recorded instruments at any
time during the editing process.
 You can save the recordings as loops in the GarageBand library.
Perhaps the biggest gripe about GarageBand — shared by those whose pod-
casts got a bit lengthy (ahem — hearty) — is this slick application’s refusal to
edit and apply dynamic audio effects past the 30-minute (999-measure) mark.
For some inexplicable reason, GarageBand editing capabilities stop there,
forcing podcasters to break up their extended shows into segments and then
reassemble the finished products in another application. (We begrudgingly
do this and then mix additional music segues and other recorded segments 
in Apple’s Final Cut Express. We then export only the audio, ending with a
dandy AIFF file that’s ready for MP3 compression in iTunes. More on com-
pression and final touches in Chapter 6.) For our purposes, however, this
time limit on the editing is minor when compared to the convenience of
GarageBand’s interface and its robust capabilities.
Upgrading from GarageBand to GarageBand 2 means purchasing the com-
plete iLife ’05 package, starting at $79.99. There is no separate upgrade for
GarageBand, but the good news is that the new GarageBand also includes the
latest versions of iPhoto, iTunes, iMovie, and iDVD, each of which is a terrific
application in its own right.
49
Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

GarageBand’s most appealing asset is its hundreds of sampled instruments
available in loops. You can easily edit and splice together these loops with
other loops to create original music beds of whatever length you choose. Pre-
recorded beds range from Asian drum ensembles to Norwegian Folk Fiddles
to Blues Harmonica; these ensembles are easily incorporated with editable
loops of Classic Rock piano, Southern Rock, or Emotional Piano reminiscent
of films like Love Story and Sense and Sensibility.
GarageBand also provides a capability — with many (not all) of the 
samplings — to create your own musical theme. Sure, some instruments
may sound better than others, but you might — with a bit of trial and 
error — create an original melody that serves as the best royalty-free
intro and exit for your podcast.
If you’re planning to do a bit of composing in GarageBand, be warned. Much
like working with video in Final Cut Express, GarageBand is a lot of fun but can
easily soak up your free time that you would normally dedicate to recording.
So if you need to get in touch with your inner Mozart, set aside a good-size
pocket of time to put together your desired riffs. You have many to choose
from; as with podcasting, it’s best not to rush the process.

Following the Apple archetype, GarageBand is easy to tinker with, navigate,
and understand within a short span of time. Plenty of terrific books are avail-
able for mastering all the nuances of GarageBand, including GarageBand For
Dummies by “Dr. Mac” himself, Bob LeVitus (Wiley). We cannot praise this
application enough — and with expansion packs (called Jam Packs) that add
instruments, riffs, and loops to your GarageBand and start at $100 each, this
unassuming software offers a lot to the podcaster.
Audio Hijack Pro: Good software 
with a bad-boy attitude
If you’re not interested in the musicality of GarageBand (or any of the other
applications offered in iLife), Mac users have another handy application for
recording podcasts and it comes with features not found in Audacity. This
renegade of audio software is called Audio Hijack Pro (www.rogueamoeba.
com/audiohijackpro).
What makes Audio Hijack Pro unique is its ability to record audio from nearly
any source — not only coming in from microphones and musical instruments,
but also from Internet streaming audio of any kind, including live audio chats
from Skype and iChat!
Audio Hijack sports the familiar features that Audacity, GarageBand, and
Cakewalk possess — such as converting analog music to digital, preparing
MP3 files specifically for podcasting (by adding ID3 tags, setting bandwidth,
and so on), and supporting audio formats such as WAV, AIFF, and MP3. The
latest version of Audio Hijack offers some appealing capabilities:
 Record to AAC and Apple Lossless (ALAC) formats
 Customize with AppleScript

Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go
GarageBand’s Preferences
We’re particularly keen on GarageBand’s
Preferences, which let you organize your final
AIFF files in an iTunes playlist. When you’re done
with that particular recording session (what
GarageBand refers to as a “song” although your
podcast probably is primarily spoken-word voice
tracks), choose File➪Export to iTunes. The file is
then exported in AIFF and immediately dropped
into the playlist you named in GarageBand,
where it’s tagged with your name (or podcasting
ID) and the “album” (which, in the case of the
podcaster can be anything from the show title
itself to the air date of the show). See Chapter 6
for details on adding ID3 tags.

 Has built-in CD burning
 Can record AM/FM radio input sources
 Supports various radio accessories for your computer such as Griffin’s
RadioSHARK and D-Link’s DSB-R100
 Can rip and record all audio through AHP’s System Audio Input Source
 Edits and engineers input from multiple applications via the Application
Mixer plug-in
 AHP’s New Recording Bin organizes and previews audio files
Retailing for about $32 (less than half the cost of the iLife package), Audio
Hijack Pro is quickly becoming a popular application for Macintosh podcast-
ers and prides itself in being a rule-breaker. It’s a non-Apple product that can
record in Apple’s audio-compression formats, burn CDs (so you can skip
iTunes), and easily record streaming audio signals that tend to elude other
audio-recording-and-editing software. Keep a sharp eye on this new player;
it’s craving a niche for itself in the podcasting community.
We have a green light, and all systems are go! After you get your software in
place, test your set up to make sure everything works. Take a look at your
application’s preferences so that your sound input and output are going
through your audio card, pod up the channel on the mixing board that your
microphone is connected to, listen to yourself through your headphones, and
you’re all set and ready to record your podcast.
The Sky’s the Limit: Big-Budget Software
If you’re lucky enough to have unlimited funds and resources to build your
podcasting studio, this section on software is for you. A majority of podcasts
are working on the bare-bones plan, and so far the investment in the equip-
ment we’ve recommended is for a budget of under $500 — provided you feel
like making an investment in a professional microphone, mixing board, or soft-
ware. Remember, what makes a good podcast is the same whether you’re on a
budget of $0, $500, or $Ridiculous. The difference is in the sound you can get.
For the commercial broadcaster venturing into podcasting, sound quality is
crucial as your reputation and experience are now being “socially tested.” Do
you not bother with the details, or raise the quality bar? Commercial podcast-
ing will demand nothing less than the best in audio quality.
But when shopping online, you see mixing boards, audio cards, and micro-
phones of all shapes, sizes, and sensitivities. You’ll also see a wide variety 
of accessories — including mic stands, windscreens, “popper stoppers,” 
52
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

and other add-ons that can improve your quality of recording (or at least look
very cool in your office). Depending on your budget, you can purchase and
set up the higher-end audio hardware, depending on the future you foresee
for your podcast.
Podcasting is still a new field, but if you want to push its envelope and have
the bucks, high-end audio software gives you full control over every aspect 
of the audio you’re recording.
At one time, a favorite software application of broadcasting professionals was
CoolEdit. But when Adobe Systems purchased it and repackaged the software
as Adobe Audition (shown in Figure 2-14), it got even better. Audition is offered
as a competitive upgrade at $250.00; a full stand-alone version is available at
$299.99, or you can get it as part of the Adobe Video Collection Version 2.5 at
$999.99. Audition’s features are, at a glance, nothing short of awesome:
 128 tracks available to the user
 Can record 32 different sources simultaneously
 Offers 50 digital sound effects to enhance your audio tracks
 Rips, edits, and saves audio from video and other audio sources
Figure 2-14:

53
Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

 Provides 5,000 royalty-free loops that can be easily edited and compiled
to create your own music beds
 Offers integrated CD burning for audio
 Restores analog audio signals (from vinyl and cassette recordings) for
digital playback quality
 Can separate vocal and instrumental tracks from imported music
sources
What makes Audition so appealing to heavily engineered productions such 
as Slice of Scifi (sliceofscifi.com) and Area 51 (area51show.com) is the
complete control users have over the audio. Audition gives you dominion
over pitch, wavelength, time-stretching, background-noise removal, and
Dolby 5.1 stereo output, making it a staple in the digital audio industry.
Audition runs exclusively on the Windows platform, but Mac users have an
equal (in cost, features, and control over the audio) called Soundtrack Pro.
Gluing It Together with XML and RSS
So far in this chapter we’ve talked about the hardware (mics and mixers) 
and the software (GarageBand and Audacity) necessary to record audio and
create the podcast media file. That’s the fun and creative part for most folks.
But to make your recording a podcast, you need to get your hands dirty on
the tedious and technical parts, and add two more three-letter acronyms to
your vocabulary: XML and RSS.
RSS is a “flavor” of XML. For all you coding geeks out there, please bear with
us; we’ll be using RSS and XML as interchangeable terms in this section.
Chapter 9 plunges rather deeply into RSS 2.0, but here we give a fast
overview of where the RSS 2.0 feed fits into the podcasting equation.
We’ve helped dozens of non-technical podcasters get started — and in nearly
every case, the XML/RSS step is the biggest source of confusion. So rather
than serve up technology mumbo-jumbo, we’re going to talk about Star Trek
geeks and trained monkeys. (Say what?)
Consider this: Star Trek geeks know everything about their passion in life —
Star Trek. Perhaps you’ve seen other forms of geekiness expressed toward
other public icons — say, Apple computers or The Beatles. But you know the
type of person we’re talking about, right?
54
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

As a podcaster, you need a program that acts like a Star Trek geek. Your vir-
tual STG has a single job: To boldly know everything there is to know about
your podcast — and to flip happily into data-dump mode every time some-
one drops by to see what’s new.
And the trained monkey? Well, podcast listeners don’t have time to drop by
and check on each and every podcaster they want to hear. So they employ a
trained monkey and tell him exactly which Star Trek geeks to check with —
and how often. When an STG has something new to say, the trained monkey
comes back to his owner with the specifics. (And they said nobody could tie
Star Trek, monkeys, and podcasting together. Ha!)
Here the role of the STG is filled by the RSS 2.0 file created by the podcaster —
and the trained monkey is actually the podcatching client (iPodderX, for
example) used by the listener.
As a podcaster, your job is not only to create your RSS 2.0 file, but also to make
sure you keep that file updated and current each time you make available a
new podcast media file. Lucky for you (and all of us), plenty of software solu-
tions make this step a breeze.
55
Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go
It’s all about the <enclosure>, baby
If you already have a blog, you’re probably
already generating an XML file — or have the
capability to do so. Although podcatching
clients can read this existing XML feed, the feed
needs to include the <enclosure> tag in
order for podcasting to work.
Dave Winer invented the <enclosure> tag in
early 2001 for the purpose of embedding links to
large audio, video, or other “rich media” ele-
ments into an RSS/XML feed. At the time, Dave
and Adam Curry were trying to solve the click-
and-wait problems inherent in big files such as
audio and video. Typically, if a user clicked a link
to a 30MB file, several minutes would drag by
before the file was completely downloaded to
the user’s hard drive and was usable. Not a good
user experience, regardless of what’s in the file.
With the advent of the <enclosure> RSS ele-
ment, users could subscribe to places where
they expected large files as a regular occur-
rence and move the downloading of those files
to the early hours of the morning, when the
users were snug in bed and a ten-minute down-
load was no big deal.
Of course, users back then had to be technically
savvy to take advantage of this new RSS element.
It wasn’t until the summer of 2004 that Adam
Curry wrote the first iPodder application — 
a simple, user-friendly desktop program that
extracted enclosed media files from RSS 2.0
feeds. And behold! Podcasting was born.

Simplify the process and get a blog!
If you’re looking to spend the least amount of time dinking around with your
RSS 2.0 feed, look no further than the popular blogging software solutions.
Blogs are easy to set up, are often free, and ease the process of generating
and updating of RSS 2.0 files (they do it automatically).
You can choose from dozens of blog software packages, each with a variety of
bells and whistles that are designed to make your updates (including your RSS
2.0 file) as easy and/or customizable as possible. For a crash course, check out
Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies and Buzz Marketing with Blogs
For Dummies (both published by Wiley); they can help you choose which blog
software might be right for you. Meanwhile, here are a few options to consider:
 Movable Type (www.sixapart.com/movabletype): Evo has been using
Movable Type, shown in Figure 2-15, for the past three years and has
found it to be easy to use, extendable to fit his ever-changing needs, and
robust enough to handle significant traffic loads. And with the easy to
install MT-Enclosures plug-in, making your RSS 2.0 into a podcast feed is
as simple as adding a link to your file.
Movable Type 3.17 is available as a free download, or you can get the
licensed version for $69.95, which entitles you to technical support and
other benefits. It’s available as a hosted model, where Movable Type
takes care of the installation, or in a do-it-yourself model, where you
arrange for hosting and installation on your own servers. Movable Type
can boost your show’s distribution — and a companion blog is available
for show notes and additional postings.
 WordPress (wordpress.org): Another popular blogging solution,
WordPress has some advantages. Not only is it easy to install and get
running, but it also supports podcasting out of the box. Oh, and it’s free.
(Yeah. Free. Big plus there.) However, WordPress does not have a hosted
model. But don’t fret; many hosting companies offer packages that have
WordPress preinstalled.
 Blogger (www.blogger.com): Blogger holds the distinction of being one
of the first and most widely used blogging systems on the block. It’s only
available in a hosted model and is still the de-facto standard for most of
the blogging world. Free from cost and any setup confusion, Blogger is
also limited in its functionality and customizability. While it does allow
you to create an RSS 2.0 template, it won’t allow you to include the pod-
cast media file. Several workaround solutions exist, but know that your
Blogger account won’t allow you to podcast without some work.
 Libsyn (libsyn.com): Don’t be surprised if Liberated Syndication turns
up quite a lot in this book. Libsyn is a combined blog/hosting company
specifically designed for podcasting. While it may not address all your
needs, its ease of use and all-in-one nature should not be passed up.
Turnkey hosting plans start at $4.95 per month.

FeedBurner turns any blog into a podcast
Rick Klau and the folks at FeedBurner deserve a
nod for their dedication to a podcasting approach
that’s 100 percent For Dummies–friendly. With a
free FeedBurner account, any blogger can con-
vert an existing RSS, Atom, or other syndication
feed to a podcast-ready feed in three simple
steps:
1. Sign up for a free FeedBurner account at
www.feedburner.com.
Free is good.
2. Burn your existing feed.
Enter the URL of your blog’s feed into the
easy-to-use interface.
3. Select Smart Cast from the Additional
Services menu.
FeedBurner then converts podcast media 
file links into an embedded <enclosures>
element in a new feed.
That’s it! You now have a new podcast-ready
RSS 2.0 feed.
FeedBurner is now watching your original blog
feed. The next time you make a post and include
a link to a media file (MP3, WAV, . . . whatever),
your new FeedBurner feed automatically does
the behind-the-scenes magic necessary to get
the <enclosure> tag pointing at the file you
referenced in your post. While your original
feed (maybe www.FishingAlaska.com/
index.xml) doesn’t change, your new feed-
burner feed (perhaps feeds.feedburner.
com/FishingAlaska) is now podcast-friendly
and ready to be served to podcatching clients.

Fine. Do it without a blog.
Blogs are great if you want to include text and other information along with
your podcast. But if you’re enough of a purist that you want your podcast to
stand on its own without a supporting Web site, that’s okay, too.
A place to put your show notes — and a home for your podcast, where folks
can get your e-mail address or other pieces of data they may not catch on the
show — is a really good idea. If you’re confident that you prefer your podcast
to stand on its own and exist only as an RSS 2.0 file, these options may be
what you’re looking for. If you’re not sure, we suggest avoiding this route.
Take a closer look at some of these Web sites to provide a home for your pod-
cast, sans blog. With these services, your podcast is simply an RSS file and an
accompanying MP3 file, making show notes, additional comments, and hyper-
links a bit of a challenge; but you can podcast without a blog if you please,
and here’s where you do that:
 Audioblog.com (www.audioblog.com): For $4.95 per month, Audioblog
lets you record, host, and publish MP3 files, generating a custom RSS 2.0
file for you automatically. No blog or hosting company is required. In fact,
these folks even came up with a way to record and upload your audio
file right in your browser — no recording software required. This is a
great option if you want to test the waters of podcasting without making
a huge investment of time or money.
 Podcastamatic (bradley.chicago.il.us/projects/podcastamatic/):
Podcastamatic automates the creation of an RSS 2.0 file based on the
contents of a folder on a Web server. It’s not for the technical neophyte,
you understand, but if you already have a Web server and don’t really
want to run blogging software of any flavor, this is a solid option.
Once installed and configured on your server, Podcastamatic watches a
particular folder for new MP3 files you upload. When it detects changes
to the folder, it generates a new RSS 2.0 file. It even creates or populates
an HTML page if you so desire.
 Feeder (reinventedsoftware.com/feeder/): Feeder provides a
simple interface that gives a lot of flexibility to podcasters who already
maintain an active site. You fill it out, and it cranks out an RSS 2.0 file
that’s ready to be uploaded to the server. Very easy, full featured, and
self-contained, it’s popular among many podcasters. It’s for Macs only,
and it’s a steal at $29.95.
Doing it by hand
What? Are you crazy? No, seriously — generating an XML file in RSS 2.0
format isn’t overly difficult, but it’s extremely easy to mess up! Sure, you
58
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

could open up Notepad or BBEdit, download a few examples, and generate
your own code, but we advise against it.
However, some code warriors — in the same vein of hand-coding HTML,
JavaScript, and other markup languages — insist on composing their own
code from the ground up (you glutton for punishment, you). You’ll want to
jump ahead to Chapter 9 for an in-depth look at writing a simple RSS 2.0 feed.
We also recommend getting extremely comfortable with Syndicating Web Sites
with RSS Feeds For Dummies (or at least keeping a copy under your pillow);
it goes into more detail on these topics.
You can find the full technical specifications for RSS 2.0 (among other places)
at feedvalidator.org/docs/rss2.html.
Finding a Host for Your Podcast
Unless you’ve already got hosting taken care of — either from a pre-existing
relationship or from one of the solutions we list earlier — you’re going to
need a place on the Web to put your stuff. You know — your podcast media
files, RSS 2.0 file, and show notes for your podcast. You also need a way to get
them up there.
Getting a hosting provider is a breeze, with hundreds of companies all vying
for your $9.95 fee each month. The good news is that all this competition has
brought down the cost of hosting packages significantly. The bad news is that
you have to go through a lot of clutter to reach the right selection.
This section covers the basic needs for most beginning podcasts and men-
tions a few pitfalls to watch out for. In Chapter 7, we get into the process of
actually moving your files to your host.
Don’t rush into a hosting agreement just yet. We suggest reading the rest of
this chapter as well as Chapter 7 before forking over your credit card. We
cover lots of good information that can help you narrow down your choices.
When you’re comparing hosting plans, try not to get bogged down in the
number of e-mail addresses, MySQL databases, subdomains, and the like. All
of those features have their own purposes, but as a podcaster, you have only
two worries: how many podcasts the site can hold and how much bandwidth
you get.
59
Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

Size does matter
Podcast media files are big. Unlike bloggers, podcasters eat up server space.
Where simple text files and a few images take up a relatively small space,
podcast media files tend to be in the 3MB to 30MB range.
Here some suggestions for zeroing in on what you need storage-space-wise:
 Think about how many podcasts you want to keep online, and plan
accordingly.
 Consider the amount of server space you’ll need to host your blogging
software, databases, text, and image files. For example, Evo is using
315MB of space for just one of his podcasts, and he doesn’t even host
the podcast media files on that server! Of course, he’s been building his
Web site for three years and didn’t get to that level overnight.
Podcasters should look for hosting plans that include at least 1000MB of stor-
age space. As of this writing, several host providers charge less than $10 per
month for that much space, and more.
Bandwidth demystified
Of equal importance to storage space is bandwidth, an elusive and often-
misunderstood attribute of Web hosting that is critical to podcasters.
Bandwidth refers to the online space needed to handle the amount of stuff
you push out of your Web site every month. The bigger the files, the more
bandwidth consumed. Compounding the problem, the more requests for the
files, the more bandwidth consumed.
For instance, take a look at the bandwidth for Evo’s podcast, Slice of Scifi.
The graphic representation in Figure 2-16 shows not only the amount of 
information exchanged (read: downloads) but also the rising demands on
bandwidth. After a while, the Web host will have to consider when it’s time to
allocate a larger bandwidth package to handle your show — and that means
more cash outlay for you.
And therein lies the trouble for podcasters. Most podcasters want more 
listeners — and that means more podcatching clients requesting the pod-
cast media files. Bottom line: The more popular your show gets, the more
bandwidth being consumed every month.
60
Part I: Podcasting on a Worldwide Frequency 

To simplify, pretend that you produce one show each week, and your show
requires 10MB of bandwidth. You publish the show on Monday, and your 100
subscribers receive your show that evening. You’ve just consumed 1000MB 
of bandwidth (100 × 10MB) for that week. But next week, more people have
found out about your incredibly amazing show, and now you have 200 sub-
scribers. Next Monday, your bandwidth increases to 2000MB, which gets
added to your previous week’s total to bring you up to 3000MB.
Yep, you’re up to a larger scheme of things — where you have to start think-
ing in GB (gigs). And to streamline the math, we used 1000MB per GB, as
opposed to the more correct 1024.
But those extra 100 subscribers? They weren’t satisfied with just the last
show. They also download the previous week’s show, tacking on an extra 
1GB of bandwidth. Now you’re at 4GB for the month.
Next week, you’re even more popular. Now you have 500 subscribers. Everyone
gets the first file (which costs you 5GB), and 300 of them are getting the previ-
ous two weeks’ files (300 × 2 × 10MB), which rings you up for and extra 6GB.
You’re now at (4 + 5 + 6) 15GB for the month. See how things stack up?
Figure 2-16:

width for

61
Chapter 2: Getting the Gadgets That Make a Podcast Go

It’s not uncommon for Evo’s podcasts to pull down over 250GB of transfer —
and that is only with about 1,500 subscribers. For shows with tens of thousands
of subscribers, the bandwidth consumption is in the terabytes of data.
It’s difficult to estimate how much bandwidth you’ll need for your podcast
because it’s hard to guess how many people might be interested in your
show. Chapter 7 offers some real-world tips on figuring out what your band-
width requirements might be.
As a general rule, the longer your podcast episodes, the more bandwidth you
need. If you plan on a five-minute bi-weekly podcast, you have less to worry
about than someone contemplating a thrice-weekly hour long show. The latter
podcaster will be quite concerned with how to manage bandwidth because it
will be an issue with even a small subscriber base.
There are ways to avoid the issue of bandwidth, or at least make it less of
a concern for even the podcaster with large ambitions — as well as files.
Chapter 7 talks about some podcast-specific and some advanced hosting
options. Even if you don’t think you’ll have to worry about bandwidth, it’s 
a section to pay close attention to because you’ll likely be more popular —
and perhaps more wordy — than you think.

A
podcast starts with a simple audio recording.
Whether you are recording your voice or splicing

along the way.

une to a classical radio station (and when we refer to “classics” here, we
mean Beethoven and Haydn, not the Beatles and Hendrix) and listen to
the DJs — oh, sorry, the on-air personalities — featured there. You’ll notice
that they’re all speaking slowly and articulately, mellowed and obviously
relaxed by the melodic creations of greats such as Mozart, Wagner, and Joel.
(Yes, Billy Joel’s got a classical album — a pretty good one, too!) While the
on-air personalities of your local classical music station all sound alike, they
sound dramatically different from the wacky Morning Zoo guys on your con-
temporary hits radio station who sound as if they are on their eighth cup of
espresso.
When you hear people talk about finding your voice in broadcasting, that is
what they mean. You come to an understanding of what your average audi-
ence wants (and to some degree, expects), and then you meet that need.
This chapter helps you determine what voice and personality you want to
come across when podcasting.
Then you find out what you need to do to get ready for the show. This chap-
ter shows you what to do to prepare for smooth and easy podcasts that (one
can hope) will be glitch-free during the recording process. Preshow prep is
not only important, but also essential in making a feed worth catching. Even
the most spontaneous of podcasts follows a logical progression and general
direction and remains focused on the podcast’s intent.

Choosing a Unique Topic 
for Your Podcast
Before you can think about putting together a podcast, you need to decide
on what topic you want to cover. At the time of this writing, a sample of what
people were podcasting (according to PodcastAlley.com) — listed by genre
(topic area) from most to least common — looked like this:
 1,534 Music/Radio
 1,135 General
 921 Technology
 491 Comedy
 483 Religion/Inspiration
 486 Cultural/Political
 240 News
 207 Business
 253 Sports
 209 Education
 157 Movies/Films
 114 Health/Fitness
 57 Food and Drink
 60 Video Podcasts
 3 Travel
 37 Environment
That’s a total of 6,388 podcasts — an increase of 4,082 over a six-month
period. This averages out to roughly 41 new podcasts going online every 
day. And these numbers don’t include shows registered with Podcast.net,
Podcastpickle.com, or other popular podcast directories.
The first thing to understand about podcasts is that this activity isn’t all about
being “number one” in your chosen podcast genre. Granted, some podcasts
(and podcasting personalities) do vie for top honors on various polls and top
ten lists. But instead of worrying about garnering ratings (a topic that’s cov-
ered in Chapter 11), think about what will make your podcast uniquely worth
your effort and your listeners’ time. Here are some ways you can create a
unique podcast:
66
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

 Study other podcasts. Before you can figure out what will make your
podcast unique, you may want to check out some other podcasts. The
best way to find out what makes a podcast worthwhile is to sign up for 
a few feeds that pique your curiosity.
Listen to these feeds for a few weeks (provided they’re weekly) and jot
down what you like and don’t like about them. From the notes you take,
you might find your angle. Keep in mind that downloading and listening
to other podcasts should be educational and constructive, not a raid-for-
fodder for your own show.
Don’t openly steal content, SFX, or content structure from another pod-
cast. (Approach it as you would someone’s Web site. It’s okay to be
inspired, as long as you don’t openly and outwardly make your podcast
a carbon copy of your inspiration’s work.) Also try to avoid open criti-
cism of another podcast in your own; degrading someone else’s work is
no way to better yours. Try to stay on the pod-sitive side.
 Pick a topic you know. Whether you have decided to take on the topic of
music, religion, or technology, the best way to make your podcast unique
is to find an angle you’re comfortable with (Polka: The Misunderstood
Music, Great Travesties of Sports History, Forgotten Greats of Science
Fiction). There is also the possibility that your initial show may inspire 
an additional angle so unique that you will have to start another podcast
specifically to address that audience.
 Speak with confidence. A trick in making a podcast work is to speak
confidently about your topic. No one is going to believe in what you have
to say if you don’t believe in yourself. It may take a few podcasts to find
a groove, or you might hit the ground running and have a podcast that
immediately takes off. Just speak with conviction. This is your podcast.
Allow yourself to shine.
The content you bring to the Internet — regardless of what genre it falls
under — is unique because it is your podcast. It is your voice, your angle,
and your approach to whatever intent you pursue. Provided you maintain a
high confidence level and, above all else, genuinely enjoy what you’re doing,
people will tune in and talk to other listeners about what you’re podcasting.
Finding Your Voice
The broadcasting industry might not want to admit to this, but podcasting
and commercial radio share a lot in common. In the early days of what is now
a major radio genre, talk shows were reserved for National Public Radio and
news stations. In general, they were pretty dry and lackluster, bringing their
listeners the news, weather, and daily topics that affected the world — but
nothing particularly unusual or exciting.
67
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

Then a guy named Howard Stern came along and changed everything in this
once-tiny niche! You can love him, you can hate him — you can claim to hate
him when secretly you love him — but Stern completely turned around what
was considered AM-only programming. Now talk radio is big business. Some
of its personalities are just out to entertain (Don & Mike, Ron & Fez), others
are using it to voice their own political viewpoints (Rush Limbaugh leaning to
the right stereo channel while Al Franken favors the left), and then we have
the bottom-of-the-barrel personalities (insert your least favorite on-air loud-
mouths here) who turn you off talk radio and on to podcasting!
A majority of podcasting is just that: talk radio. Actually, a more accurate
description would be “homespun talk audio” because radio is broadcast 
while podcasting is narrowcast. Each podcast has a different personality 
and appeals to a different market. Finding your voice is one of the most chal-
lenging obstacles that you (as a once-and-future podcaster) must clear.
Even if your podcast’s aim is entertainment, you have a message you want
to convey. That message will influence the voice you adopt for your podcast.
If you’re podcasting an audio blog about life, its challenges, and the ups and
downs that one encounters, then maybe a soft tone — relaxed and somewhat
pensive — would be appropriate. But if you decide to go political — and let’s
say you are the Angry Young Man who is fed up with the current state of
bureaucracy — then it’s time to fine-tune the edginess of your voice. That’s
what you need for a podcast of this nature.
After you discover the passion your podcast is centered around (see the pre-
ceding section for tips on how to do that), here are some ways to find your
voice:
 Record your voice and then listen to what it sounds like. It astounds
me how many people hate listening to their recorded voice. It’s a fear
and abhorrence akin to getting up in front of people and speaking. When
finding your voice, though, you need to hear what your current voice
sounds like first. Write a paragraph on your show’s subject. Then read it
aloud a few times and find a rhythm in your words. Expect the following:
• Talking too fast
• Swallowing words like to, in, and small, one-syllable words
• Ignoring commas, thereby creating one long, run-on thought
• Lip-smacking, heavy breathing, and the unavoidable ahs and ums
Some of these problems can be edited out (see Chapter 5), but you
should grow accustomed to hearing your own voice because you will
hear yourself again and again . . . and again . . . during the editing
process. The more familiar you are with how your voice sounds, the
easier you can edit your podcasts and evaluate them before going
online.
68
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

 Play around with the rhythm of your speech. You don’t have to be an
actor to podcast, but you can apply some basics of acting when you’re
recording. One of these basics, as one of Tee’s acting professors told
him, is to “Make a meal of your words.” This means to play around with
the rhythm of your speech. When you want to make a point, slow down.
If you’re feeling a tad smarmy, then pick up the pace. Above all, be relaxed
and make sure you don’t sound too contrived or melodramatic.
 Develop your podcasting personality. After you know what you sound
like when you record, here is where you develop your podcasting person-
ality. Is your persona going to be light, fun, and informal, or something
a little edgy and jaded? Is your message taking an angle of marketing,
politics, or religion? Or are you podcasting a love of music, science, or
your Macintosh?
Deciding Whether You Need 
an Outline or Script
What method works best for you? A full script and hours of prep time, or a
single note card and two clicks of the mouse — one for Record and another
for Stop? Both approaches work, depending on the podcaster’s personality. It
could be said that there’s little difference between a writer and a podcaster.
Some writers prefer to use an outline when putting together a short story or
novel; others merely take an idea, a few points, and a direction, and then let
their fingers work across the keyboard.
If you decide to work with a script, it’s a good idea to invest some time into
preshow prep (simple preparation for what you’re going to say and how
you’re going to deliver it). Depending on your podcast, though, prep time
may vary. Here are a few examples of how dramatically different prep time
can be for different podcasting situations:
 For her podcast Geek Fu Action Grip, Mur Lafferty showcases every
week an essay of her own dry witticisms and irreverent look at the
world. She spends an hour writing and rehearsing her material. If she
incorporates material from other resources, she might need to tack on
another half hour. That’s pretty efficient preshow prep for a podcast of
15 to 25 minutes.
 On the opposite side of the production spectrum is Area 51, a fully
scripted one-hour podcast that features comedic bits, polished 
banter between hosts Douglas Scott and Bobby Black, and extremely
professional-sounding production quality. (See Figure 3-1.) Area 51’s
69
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

preshow prep begins with producer Marc Rose scripting comedy bits
while recording host segments. “Because of the nature of this show, the
Douglas and Bobby segments are improvised then cleaned up in editing.”
The average preshow prep time for the Area 51 crew, according to Rose,
ranges from two to three days.
A PureCastMedia.com podcast
These are two very different approaches: one for a 15-minute solo podcast
and another for a one-hour production, complete with full cast and special
effects. Both are popular podcasts that consistently run smoothly thanks to
appropriate preshow prep. So how far should your prep go technically? That
depends on what your podcast needs. Outlines and scripts can keep you on
track with what you want to say, serving as roadmaps to keep you moving
smoothly from Point A to Point B.
Both of these approaches to preshow prep work, but if you have never done
any kind of planning like this, the secret to efficient preshow prep can be
boiled down to three disciplines that podcasters follow:
 Habit: Many podcasters, especially podcasters emerging from corporate
offices, prepare for podcasts in the same manner as business presenta-
tions. They jot down essential points on note cards to keep the podcast
on track, but the points are the only material they write beforehand.

Organizational skills from the workplace can be easily applied to the
podosphere. For example, Nicole Simon, in her day job as a consultant,
gives presentations on various marketing strategies. Nicole’s day-to-day
job — addressing a roomful of people armed with only a single index
card of key points — is easily applied to her preshow-prep practices for
her podcast, Useful Sounds. With a collection of ideas and topics gathered
between podcasts, she begins her one-take recording with a handful of
points serving as a guideline.
 Talent: Some podcasters are truly the Evel Knievels of the podosphere,
firing up their mics and recording in one take. These podcasters tend to
have backgrounds in live entertainment, deciding in a moment’s time
when a change of delivery is required. This is a talent of quick thinking,
and while it keeps material spontaneous and fresh, it is a talent that
must be developed with time.
For example, Dan Klass is the demented mind behind the sharp and sar-
castic podcast, The Bitterest Pill. His show is completely improvised. No
prep time. Not a list of key points in sight. How can he do this? Dan’s is a
special breed of bravery: He’s a professional stand-up comedian.
 Passion: This is a driving force with a majority of podcasters that keeps
their podcasts spur-of-the-moment. With enough drive, inspiration, and
confidence in their message, they keep their prep time to a minimum
because it isn’t a chore but a form of recreation.
For example, Jesse Obstbaum’s podcast The Mousepod is all Disney, all
the time. “My prep time is under an hour, assuming I’m not doing an
interview for the show. I quickly jot down a bunch of ideas — probably
twice as many as I need for the show — and then I have lots of books
and articles about Disney,” Jesse states about his preshow planning. He
then lets his passion for Walt, Mickey, Goofy, Donald, and the gang drive
him easily through 30 minutes (in some cases, an hour).
Choosing a Method for 
Recording Interviews
In your search to find the podcast that best reflects you, communicates the
message you want to send out to the world, and makes the impression you
want to make (among the thousands of podcasts being uploaded), you con-
clude that the best way to give your viewpoint credence is to bring in guests.
Yes, along with Charlie Rose, Barbara Walters, and Tom Green, you’re going
to hold interviews.
Your podcast just got a bit more technically complicated.
71
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

Taping phone calls
Many times, interviews — particularly with authorities and luminaries in the
field you’re podcasting about — will be held over the phone. Do a Google
search for the term “telephone recording devices,” and you’ll find a wide
array of machines out there that will record, even in a digital format. What
you choose depends on how much moola you’re willing to spend:
 Cassette recorders: These economical recording devices utilize micro
or standard tape cassettes, leaving it up to the podcaster to solve the
problem in getting the conversation from analog device to computer.
The simplest way of digitally capturing the interview is to simply play
back the conversation and use an external microphone in front of the
device’s speaker to record the playback. That’s a simple and cost-effective
method, but it may not yield the highest sound quality.
 Digital recorders: On the opposite end of equipment cost and quality
are digital recorders. You can attach them to a telephone (in the same
manner as an answering machine), record over 20 hours of conversa-
tion, and then easily transfer the sound from device to computer via a
USB port.
 Analog-to-digital hybrid recorders: Software applications such as
CallCorder for the PC (for just under $40 from www.callcorder.com) 
or Phone Valet for the Mac (an investment of about $119 from www.
parliant.com) turn your computer into the recorder. Using either a
standard modem or another hook-up device (in the case of some soft-
ware packages, it comes included), your telephone and your computer
are connected. When the call comes in or when you make the call, you
can then ask for permission to record the conversation (again, some
software does this automatically) and then bring the phone call directly
into your computer in the format of your choosing.
You can find these recorders and software packages at your local electronics
store or online at a wide variety of prices.
Recording conversations with Skype
If you have never heard of Skype, do yourself a favor: Surf over to www.skype.
com and familiarize yourself with the new application that turns telecommuni-
cations on its ear. Skype is “free Internet telephony,” something akin to iChat’s/
AOL IM’s Audio mode. It’s more stable and, in some instances, provides clearer
reception. What makes Skype more appealing to Internet users than iChat/AOL
is the expandability of the application. You can record Skype conversations
with various methods and use downloadable software to monitor levels and
volume as you record (as detailed on www.raggedcastle.com/webcrumbs/
archives/003724.html). Figure 3-2 shows an example setup that provides
the ability to record Skype calls for editing into a podcast.
72
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

For Macintosh users, an easier solution for recording Skype calls is an appli-
cation that is built specifically for the capturing and enhancement of audio:
Audio Hijack Pro from Rogue Amoeba (www.rogueamoeba.com). Costing only
$32.00, Audio Hijack Pro offers clear capturing of Skype conversations in the
format and quality of your choosing, and the setup is easy.
Recording Skype calls using Audio Hijack Pro
With Audio Hijack Pro, Mac users can capture Skype conversations in an
editable format by setting a few simple preferences. Your Skype recording
settings are then saved for future use; you don’t have to reset them each
time.
You can give Audio Hijack a test run by downloading a fully working demo at
www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/ and recording a quick test chat.
After upgrading to Pro, your settings remain in the application’s preferences.
Follow these steps to record:
1. In the Recording Bin, click Default System Input (a microphone read-
ing the current default audio input and output settings) to select it. In
the lower-right corner of the window, make sure the Input tab is
selected.
2. Confirm that the Input Device is Default System Input and that the
Output Device is Default System Output.
This should match your Skype audio input/output settings.

3. Click the Recording tab in the lower-right corner of the window 
and make changes as needed. These are your options (as shown in
Figure 3-3):
• Change the format of your audio file (advisable if you want to edit
the audio in your application of choice).
• Designate a location for captured audio, filenaming conventions,
and whether or not you wish to incorporate any script commands.
• Incorporate ID3 tags (advisable if you are going straight to
MP3/podcasting content).
Note that when you change the Title in the Tags section of the Recording
window, your Default System Input changes to whatever you have
named it.
4. Click the Effects tab in the bottom-right corner of the window.
5. Click inside the first Click Here to Insert Effect area and choose
4FX Effect➪Application Mixer.
The Application Mixer opens, as shown in Figure 3-4. It gives you the abil-
ity to “hijack” or record incoming audio from the selected application.
6. Click the Select button and choose Skype.

By default, the crossfade is set at 50%. The crossfade can be regarded as a
gain or input signal strength ruler, giving more signal dominance to either
the source recording signal or the application recording signal. If your
voice is coming in loud and clear but your Skype caller is not, try adjust-
ing the crossfade a few notches towards the application, giving Skype
more dominance. Although you can adjust levels in post-production and
easily re-record your questions and edit them in, it is more difficult to do
when your interview has already been recorded. When recording Skype
interviews, it is best to record with the Skype signal strong.
7. In the Application Mixer, click the Hijack button and then close the
window.
Skype automatically launches.
8. In the Audio Hijack Pro main window, click the Hijack button and the
Record button, and then place your Skype call (see Figure 3-5).
You’re recording!
As stated next in this chapter, there are legal restrictions concerning
the recording of telephone/Skype calls, and these restrictions vary from
country to country, state to state, and region to region. Compliance with
these laws is the responsibility of the podcaster. Always ask for permis-
sion (or better yet, get it in writing) before recording phone calls.
9. When you’re done, click to turn off the Hijack and Record buttons in
the main window. Then go into the Application Mixer and turn off the
Hijack feature there.

When you’re ready for your next interview, simply repeat Steps 7 through 9
and start recording!
The Audio Hijack free demo is a fully working version of Audio Hijack Pro
with a failsafe built in to it in order to make it (and keep it) a demonstration
application. After ten minutes of recording, the sound is slowly replaced by
static. Upgrading to Audio Hijack Pro provides you with a fully working version
of the software, granting you the ability to record hours of Skype calls in the
format of your choice.
Recording Skype calls using SkypeOut
SkypeOut is a built-in feature that comes with Skype and gives you, the Skype
user, the ability to dial a telephone number (either LAN or mobile) and use
Skype to talk to that person at two cents a minute. Oh, and this charge is for
all calls, anywhere in the world.
Follow these steps to start using SkypeOut:
1. Go to My Account and login using your Skype username and login.
Links are provided on the My Skype tab in Skype’s startup window or
online at the Skype Store, located at www.skype.com/go/store/.
2. Look for the message SkypeOut is not active (assuming you have
not activated SkypeOut yet) and click the Buy SkypeOut Credit link.

3. Select the credit package you want (usually listed in euros in incre-
ments of ten, but each package lists the details of what you’re buying)
and then purchase it by using PayPal or any major credit card.
Your SkypeOut account is activated.
When your credit is at $0, your SkypeOut goes inactive. Simply purchase
another block of credit to reactivate it.
4. Return to Skype and click the Dial tab.
Skype opens a numeric keypad emulating a telephone, as shown in
Figure 3-6.
5. Enter a phone number and click the green Call button.
6. Record the phone call by using either Audio Hijack Pro or Gizmo
(both of which are described in this chapter).
SkypeOut credits have a shelf life of 180 days after your last SkypeOut call. So
if you go three months between calls, you might find that your credit is gone
and your SkypeOut feature is inactive. If this happens or if you run out of
credit, repeat Steps 1 through 3 to put credit back into your account and
reactivate SkypeOut.

Ensuring trouble-free recordings
When it comes to recording telephone conversations, here are a few points to
keep in mind before asking the first question:
 Get permission to record telephone conversations, even if the interview
is prearranged. Laws (both federal and state) prohibit the recording of
conversations without permission, and further restrictions limit broadcast-
ing these conversations. If you plan to record and podcast a conversation,
get the subject’s consent beforehand, both verbally and in written com-
munication (even e-mail) to make sure your legal issues are covered.
78
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
The Gizmo project: A new recording option
Affordable and hacker-safe solutions for pod-
casters seem harder to find for the PC and Linux
podcasters out there. However, a new player is
stepping into the area, offering a free alterna-
tive to Skype, and this new gizmo for your com-
puter is simply called . . . Gizmo. Available for
download at 
www.gizmoproject.com,
Gizmo is an intuitive, multiplatform VoIP (Voice
Over Internet Protocol) application (much like
Skype) offering additional features that Skype
lacks. One of these additional features is the
ability to record conversations and save them in
WAV format. Gizmo also informs both parties in
the call that the phone conversation is being
recorded and when recording stops.
If you are not podcasting with a Mac and are
looking for an efficient and easy way to record
interviews, take a good look at Gizmo, the latest
option offered by the Internet to make over-the-
phone interviews cost effective for start-up
podcasts.

 Test the equipment before the interview to make sure it works and have
a backup plan in case something goes wrong. If you have arranged a
phone-in (or Skype-in) interview with someone for your podcast — say,
a favorite indie musician or a local politician — prepare for the interview
the day before (or a few days before): Skype (or phone) a friend to conduct
a mock interview and make sure the recording setup not only works but
also sounds good.
Bandwidth demands increase the more people you conference through
your computer. Reception will be affected, so if you know more than one
person will be conferenced into this interview, it’s a good idea to test
how many people you can effectively conference in one call.
And while this may sound a bit pessimistic, be ready for things to go wrong.
Guests might not show up for interviews, and new high-tech toys, if not given
a proper pre-interview shakedown, may not come through. Prepare to have
plenty of topics to discuss on your own, and then your podcast can continue
following a quick disclaimer. In podcasting, sticking to a regular schedule is
reassuring to your listeners because they know you will offer new feeds con-
sistently and punctually.
Prepping Your Green Room for Guests
A guest could be your dad, your mother-in-law, your best friend, or the man
on the street. It could also be the friend of a friend who can get you on the
phone with your favorite author, actor, or athlete, but now you have a second
party to worry about. Regardless of who your guests are, even if they’re the
fastest of friends, working completely outline-free is no longer an option. Pull
together a few questions, organize a direction and tempo for your podcast,
and leave yourself some breathing room for impromptu or interesting off-
topic tangents to emerge.
Welcoming in-studio guests
Removing the “technical difficulties” element usually means either taking the
show to the guests or bringing the guests to the show. This kind of interview
not only is the most fun to do, but also gives you direct contact with the sub-
ject so you can observe body language, facial expressions, and reactions to
questions and answers.
79
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

When you have guests visit your facilities, which if you’re a podcaster will
probably be your house, make them feel at home. Offer them something to
drink. Offer to take them on a tour of your humble abode. Introduce them to
your family. The point is to be polite. You don’t have to cook dinner for them,
but offering a hint of hospitality, be it a glass of water (or a beer, if you’ve
ever worked closely with The Dragon Page crew), is a nice touch.
If you’re having in-studio interviews, it’s also a good idea to get your home
and yourself ready to receive guests. Sure, Tee has recorded quite a few pod-
casts in his pajamas, but because he’s reading a book for his podcast, he’s
allowed. If fantasy and science fiction authors Terry Brooks and Catherine
Asaro ever come over to his house for an interview, don’t think he’d be 
greeting them in his Joe Boxer jammies with his Guinness slippers keeping
his feet warm.
Okay, maybe he would greet them wearing the Guinness slippers, but he
would be bathed and dressed and have his teeth brushed and hair combed.
The key word here is guest. Treat them as such. Be cool, be pleasant, be nice.
And if you’re a guest on someone else’s podcast, the same rules apply. Don’t
prop your feet up on the furniture, don’t demand hospitality, and don’t be a
jerk during the interview.
The in-studio visit is an audition for both guest and host. If the guest is abra-
sive, abusive, and just plain rude, chances are the guest will never be invited
back, no matter how well the previous interview goes. If a host asks unap-
proved questions, continues to pry into personal matters that have nothing
to do with the interview, or seems determined to take over the interview
spotlight as if trying to impress the guest, said guest may never return, even
if extended an invitation. (Later in this chapter, we talk about the do’s and
don’ts of interviewing.)
Meeting guests on their own turf
Be cool, be pleasant, be nice. These same rules apply when you take your
podcast on the road. You are now practicing — for the lack of a better term —
guerilla journalism, ambushing unsuspecting people on the street with 
questions that may not strike you as hard and probing but could be to
people who don’t expect them.
A good approach in getting good interviews is to ask permission of your
guests, be they passers-by or experts and authorities in the general vicinity,
to interview them. Shoving a microphone in someone’s face and blurting out
a question is hardly a great way to introduce yourself and your podcast to
the world. If the guest you wish to interview has a handler or liaison, it’s good
protocol to follow the suggestions and advice of the guest’s staff.
80
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

When interviewing people on the street or in the moment, there are some
easy ways to identify yourself. Michael Butler of the Rock and Roll Geek Show
(rockandrollgeek.podshow.com/) uses a mic cube (the classic cube that
usually has a logo identifying a network, a show, or an organization affiliated
with the interviewer) around his microphone. There is also the simple greeting,
“Hi, do I have your permission to record this for a podcast?” (Be prepared to
explain what a podcast is, or you could always fudge it and say “broadcast.”
Keep the greeting simple!)
Just as with the phone and Skype interviews, first test and check your equip-
ment. You are now out of the controlled environment of your home studio;
you have to deal with surrounding ambient noise and how well your inter-
view is recording in the midst of uncontrolled background variables. Set up
your equipment; power up your laptop, mixing board, and mics; and record a
few words. Then play back your tests and set your levels accordingly. When
you have your setup running, you’re ready to get your interviews.
Preparing for Interviews
There is an approach that all interviewers, be they Barbara Walters or
Howard Stern, should take in talking to guests — a simple, basic plan 
in how to ask the questions that garner the best responses.
Surefire routes to happy, 
conversational guests
Chances are if you’re new to podcasting, you have never held an interview
quite like this — an interpersonal, casual chat that could get a bit thought-
provoking or downright controversial, depending on your podcast’s subject
matter. The interview may be arranged by you, or it may be prearranged for
you, but if you think what reporters do is easy, it isn’t. There is a science to it,
and here are just a few tips to take to heart so you can hold a good, engaging
interview:
 Know who you’re talking to and what to talk about. With interviewer
Jana Oliver, host of two shows on Leisure Talk Radio (recently making
the jump to the podosphere), the sheer number of guests she interviews
can cause a problem: trying to find the time to read all her guests’ books.
So she does a different kind of homework on her guests. “If my guest wrote
a book about Charlemagne, I will go online and do my own research into
the topic. This has two effects: (1) I sound like I have a clue what I’m
talking about and (2) It allows me to ask better questions.”
81
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

It’s also a good idea to visit guests’ Web sites (provided they have ’em).
You don’t have to be an expert on their subject matter, but you should
be familiar with it so you know in what direction to take the interview.
 Have your questions follow a logical progression. Say you’re interview-
ing an independent filmmaker who is working on a horror movie. A good
progression for your interview would be something like this:
• What made you want to shoot a horror movie?
• What makes a really good horror film?
• Who inspired you in this genre?
• In your opinion, what is the scariest film ever made?
You’ll notice these questions are all based around filmmaking, beginning
with the director’s choice and ending with a director’s choice. The pro-
gression of this interview starts specific on the current work and then
broadens to a wider perspective. Most interviews should follow a pro-
gression like this, or can start on a very broad viewpoint and slowly
become more specific to the guest’s expertise.
 Prepare twice as many questions than you’ll need. Some interviews
you hear grind to a halt for no other reason than the interviewer
believed that the guest would talk his head off on the first question. 
It is certain you are in for a bumpy ride when you ask a guest, “So has
this been a pleasant experience for you?” and the guest replies, “Yes.”
(Yeah, this is going to get painful.)
Write down a series of questions that could fill up your podcast with
brief, one-or-two-word answers. This way, if you find yourself struggling,
you have a hidden stockpile of questions to call upon. If after a few yes
and no answers, you can always fall back on the “would you expand a bit
on that please?” question.
 Never worry about asking a stupid question. When asking questions
that may sound obvious or frequently asked, remember: Chances are,
your audience has never heard them answered before. Okay, maybe a
writer has been asked time and again, “Where do your ideas come from?”
or a politician has heard, “So, when did you first start in politics?” often.
When you have a guest present for a podcast, there’s no such thing as a
stupid question; what’s really dumb is not to ask a question that you
think isn’t worth the guest’s time. He or she may be champing at the bit
in hopes you will ask it.
So these are just a few things to keep in mind when putting together your
questions for an interview. But before you start percolating and dream up a
few questions based on the preceding tips, stop and think about the interviews
you’ve listened to where things suddenly head south. Usually the interviewer
ambushes the guest or tries to dig into something that is either out of the
guest’s scope or none of the interviewer’s business. We’ve piled up the typi-
cal gaffes in a prime example of a good interview gone bad. Stay tuned.

Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

Surefire routes to outraged, 
uncooperative guests
Every podcaster should know how to turn a pleasant conversation sour (uh,
this is a satire and not a recipe, okay?); the following blunders should do it:
 Ask inappropriate questions. Keep in mind your podcast is not 60 Minutes,
20/20, or even Jerry Springer. If you want to fire off “hard-hitting-tell-all-
mudslinging” questions, think about who your audience is, who you are
talking to, and if the question is within the ability of the guest to answer
honestly and openly. If not, an awkward moment may be the least of
your worries.
Inappropriate can also mean irrelevant, wacky, off-the-wall, and far-
too-personal questions. For instance, Hugo and World Fantasy Award-
winning author Neil Gaiman, during a question-and-answer session 
with a ballroom full of people, was asked completely out of the blue: 
“Mr. Gaiman, what is your best score in bowling?”
Gaiman looked at the con attendee, somewhat baffled, and then replied
awkwardly, “Well, um, I can’t really answer that question because I . . .
don’t . . . bowl. Never been bowling. Don’t know how. So . . . ummm . . .
sorry.”
Maybe silly, overly candid questions work for shock jocks, but when you
have an opportunity to interview people you respect in your field of
interest, do you really want to ask them something like, “Boxers, briefs,
or none of the above?” Think about what you’re going to ask before you
actually do.
 Continue to pursue answers to inappropriate questions. If a question
has been deemed inappropriate by a guest, don’t continue to ask it.
Move on to the next question and continue forward into the interview.
Podcasts are by no means an arena for browbeating guests into submis-
sion till they break down in tears and cough up the ugly, sordid details of
their lives. If this is the intent of your podcast, then you’ve picked up the
wrong book; you need to get Psychotherapy For Dummies.
Are there exceptions to this exception? We would say, yes, depending on
the content of your podcast. Let’s say after reading — and enjoying —
Podcasting For Dummies, you decide you want to become the Tom Green
of podcasting. Of course, if you’re after irreverent material for your show
and push that envelope as far as you can, your guests may or may not
want to play along — especially if they don’t get the joke. If that’s the
case, expect your guests to get up and walk away. Even in the most idyl-
lic situations, guests can (and do) reserve the right to do that.
83
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

 Turn the interview into the Me show. Please remember that the spot-
light belongs to your guest. Yes, it is your podcast, but when a guest is
introduced into the mix, you are surrendering control of the show to him
or her, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Let guests enjoy the spot-
light; your audience will appreciate them for being there, which adds a
new dimension to your feed.
One final note on interviews: We have heard some guests say, “I’m doing
these interviewers a favor by going on to their show.” And we’ve been told 
by other show hosts, “We’re doing you a great favor with this chance to
showcase your work on our show.”
Both of these opinions are not just arrogant, they are just flat-out wrong.
The reality is that host and guest are working together to create a synergy.
The interviewer has a chance to earn a wider audience and display mastery
of journalistic techniques. The guest has a chance to get into the public eye,
stay in the public eye, and talk about the next big thing they have coming in
sight of said public eye. Working together, guest and host create a seamless
promotional machine for one another.
If you decide to take on the art of the interview, keep these rules in mind; you
and your guests will have your best chance to work together to create some-
thing special.
Determining a Length for Your Show
If you’ve been using this chapter to develop your podcast, you’ve made seri-
ous progress by this point. Here’s a quick checklist:
 You have a voice appropriate and fitting for your show’s intent.
 You have considered how much preparation your individual feed needs —
whether that’s a detailed outline and intricate scripts, or a basic list of
points to encourage improvisation and spontaneity.
 You have taken a closer look at interviews: the prep involved, how to
approach guests — questions to ask and questions to avoid.
Now you’re ready to podcast, right? The show is all set. The guest will be call-
ing you later tonight. Your questions are set up in front of the microphone
and organized, moving from broad questions about your guest’s field to the
specifics your guest is out promoting. Time to hit the Record button and start
talking — yes?
Well, no. Have you thought about how long your show’s episode is going
to run?
84
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

The hidden value of the short podcast
There are many podcasts that run under ten minutes where hosts deliver their
message and then sign off only moments after you thought they signed on. On
average — and this is more like an understood average, not really a scientific,
detailed study of all the podcasts out there — a podcast runs between 20 to
30 minutes per episode. So what about these ten-minute vignettes? Does size
matter? Does time matter? (Woah. Deep.) Is there such a thing as too short a
podcast?
Here are some advantages in offering a short podcast:
 Shorter production time: Production time is reduced from a week-long
project to a single afternoon of planning, talking, editing, and mixing.
With a quick and simplified production schedule, delivering a podcast
on a regular basis — say, every two weeks, weekly, or twice a week — is
easier.
 Fast downloads: You can be assured — no matter what specs you com-
press your audio file down to — that your podcast subscribers always
have fast and efficient downloads.
 Easy to stay on target: If you limit yourself to a running time of less than
ten minutes, you force yourself to stick to the intent (and the immediate
message) of your podcast. There’s no room for in-depth chat, sponta-
neous banter, or tangents to explore. You hit the red button and remain
on target from beginning to end, keeping your podcast strictly focused
on the facts. Shakespeare said, “Brevity is the soul of wit.” Considering
his words, ol’ Bill would probably have podcast under 15 minutes if he
were alive today.
Nothing wrong with keeping a podcast short and sweet. In fact, you might
gain more subscribers who appreciate your efficiency.
A little length won’t kill you
Now with that slick and fancy quote from the Bard about brevity, you might
think, “Shakespeare said that?! Before or after Hamlet?” That’s a good point
because Shakespeare did, in fact, have a number of his characters say, “My
lord, I will be brief . . .” and then launch into three-to-four-page monologues.
So what if Shakespeare decided to be brief in his podcast? Would he get any
subscribers if his show ran longer than half an hour? What if he broke the 
60-minute ceiling? Would the Podcast Police shut down his show?
85
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

Podcatchers (like iTunes, iPodder Lemon, and iPodderX) and subscribers, on
reading your show notes and descriptions, should be able to figure out the
average running time of your show. On a particular topic, some podcasts can
easily fill two or even three hours. It’s hard to believe even avid podcast audi-
ences would want to sit and wait for such a mammoth download, but huge
productions have some definite advantages:
 If the show is an interview, you have anywhere from two to three hours
with an authority. It’s something like having a one-on-one session stored
on your computer or MP3 player. From marketing shows like G’day World
or science shows like Slacker Astronomy, if a guest or authority is part of
the podcast, you can rest assured your podcast will go a little longer than
30 minutes — and sometimes it should.
 You’re allowed verbal breathing room. Discussion stretching past the
30-minute mark allows you and your co-hosts or guests to break off into
loosely related banter, widening your podcast’s focus and sparking dis-
cussion that can lead in other directions.
The cost of podcasts longer than 30 minutes is in bandwidth and file-storage —
issues that smaller podcasts rarely, if ever, have to deal with. See Chapter 7 for
a discussion of the bandwidth demands on your server.
Finding that happy medium
Is there such a thing as middle ground in the almost-completely undiscovered
territory that is podcasting? How can you find a happy medium if podcasters
can’t agree on a standard running time?
The happy medium for your podcast should be a sense of expectancy or 
consistency. For example, in Tee’s podcast of MOREVI: The Chronicles of
Rafe & Askana, the running times for each chapter are across the board —
the shortest is 20 minutes, 12 seconds, and the longest weighs in at a whopping
1 hour, 13 minutes, 24 seconds. The audience for MOREVI, however, under-
stands this is a podiobook, an audiobook being podcast in a serialized format.
Readers understand that chapters vary in size with a printed book, so it’s
no surprise when a podiobook follows suit. Some of the podcasts are short,
sweet, and a quick bridge between one plotline and another. Other chapters
reveal a new plot twist or introduce new characters, meaning that some
length is in order.

Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button
The SciFi channel has struck gold with an inno-
vative approach on an old favorite from the ’70s:
Battlestar Galactica. With a new cast, a new
look, and some gender-bending on the charac-
ters Boomer and Starbuck, the successful
series rounds off a solid night of science fiction.
Galactica in every episode takes delight in
taking chances and challenging boundaries. 
In that spirit of taking chances (as well as 
being interested in reaching new audiences),
Executive Producer Ronald D. Moore and
SciFi.com decided to host a podcast: two hour-
long episodes, similar to director commentaries
on DVDs, providing an inside look at season
one’s finale “Kobal’s Last Gleaming.”
An hour inside Ron Moore’s head? That’s a sci-
fi geek’s dream come to life. But two?! Season
one of Battlestar Galactica was so successful
that its premiere, “33,” won Science Fiction’s
highest honor — the Hugo — for Best Short
Form Dramatic Presentation. The companion
podcast of Battlestar Galactica was so suc-
cessful that SciFi brought it back for repeat
episodes and is currently running it with season
two. Moore’s casual chat lasts an hour (well
beyond the average running time for a podcast
. . . not that anyone subscribing cares) and pro-
vides inside stories on how improvisational the
actors can be on the set, delves into the deci-
sion process behind shooting schedules, and
notes that Ron Moore doesn’t have a problem
referring to über-intense actor/director Edward
James Olmos as “Eddie.” Keeping the produc-
tion values to the basics, Galactica’s compan-
ion podcast adds a new dimension to the
military SciFi epic by taking fans behind-the-
scenes and into the imagination of its creator.
Podcast Galactica

Podiobooks aren’t the only place that variable length works. If your podcast
deals in do-it-yourself home improvement, then explaining the construction
of a bookshelf will be a far shorter show than one about adding an extension
to your deck.
Give yourself some time to develop your show, your voice, and your direction.
(You may just be finding out about the elements in this chapter. Developing
them will take some time, trial, and error.) If you build some consistency and
expectation for your audience, it’s easier to introduce a little variation (even
a happy medium) into your running time.
Right, then. Are your vocal cords warmed up? Is that glass of ice water within
reach? Do you have a guest holding on Skype? After duly considering this
map of what it takes to build a podcast that people will want to listen to, it’s
showtime: Take a deep breath, organize your notes one more time, and then
exhale. (Always remember to exhale.) Time to click that intimidating red
button and do your thing: It’s time to record.
I Hear Music (And It Sounds 
like Police Sirens!)
In creating your own podcast, something that will give your show an extra
punch or just a tiny zest is the right kind of music. Both of us are musicians
(although Evo’s the hipper one because he does the whole rock-and-roll
thing. Tee is more into the classics: Wagner, Rimsky-Corsakov, Gershwin, and
Ellington), and we both appreciate and understand the power of music and
what it can bring to a podcast.
We also understand and appreciate the law. While you may think it is cool to
“stick it to the man” and thumb your nose at Corporate America, the law is
the law, and there are serious rules to follow when featuring that favorite
song of yours as a theme to your podcast.
We want to make this clear as polished crystal — we are not lawyers. We’re
podcasters. We have looked up the law on certain matters so we know and
understand what we’re talking about, but we are not lawyers. We can tell you
about the law, and we can give a few simple definitions of it, but we are not
giving out legal advice. If you need a legal call on a matter concerning your
podcast — whether it is concerning the First Amendment, copyright issues,
or slander — please consult a lawyer.

Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

The powers that be
The Internet, in the eyes of the government, is still regarded as a digital Wild
West, an unknown territory that has avoided regulation for many years,
granting those who use it a true, self-governed entity where ideas, cultures,
and concepts can be expressed without any filtering or editing, unless it
comes from the users themselves.
Does this mean we podcasters are free to do as we please? Well, no, not by 
a long shot. Although no specific laws are on the books (yet) — other than
anti-spam regulations governing Internet usage — there are some rules and
regulations that even podcasts must follow. There are also organizations 
that both broadcasters and podcasters must pay attention to.
The following organizations all have a say in the destiny of podcasting, and it
is only going to benefit you as a podcaster to understand how their legislation,
activities, and actions are going to affect you.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
If you listen to Howard Stern, watch CBS News, or tuned in the infamous 2004
Super Bowl Halftime Show with Janet Jackson’s “wardrobe malfunction,” then
you know about the FCC. This commission is the watchdog of anything and
everything that gets out to the public via mass communications. The FCC keeps
an eye on technology development, monopolies in the telecommunications
industry, and regulating standards for telecommunications in the United States
and its territories.
With all the good the FCC does in preventing monopolies, encouraging tech-
nological advancements, and upholding broadcasting standards, the FCC is
most commonly known for enforcing decency laws, infuriating many artists
and performers who describe it as a form of censorship. George Carlin even
went so far as to write several routines based on the “seven dirty words” he
could not say (he’s way past two dozen now) to illustrate how the kibosh has
expanded over the years to include words and concepts.
For podcasters, the FCC cannot regulate what is said (yet) because it does not
consider the Internet a broadcasting medium. However, given recent legislation
to reduce spam (junk e-mail) and the growing popularity of podcasting among
mainstream broadcasters (such as Clear Channel and the SciFi channel), it may
not be long before the law catches up with technology.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
Sean Fanning. Does that name ring a bell? Sadly, it was Fanning who lost his
battle against the RIAA when he contested that his file-sharing application, a
89
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

tiny piece of software called Napster, in no way infringed on copyright laws
and was not promoting music piracy. The RIAA led the charge in shutting
down the original Napster Web site and continues to protect property rights
of its members — as well as review new and pending laws, regulations, and
policies at the state and federal level.
The RIAA will have a definite say as to why you cannot use a selected piece of
music for your podcast. Simply put, it’s not your music. Sure, you bought the
CD and you own that CD, but the music you listen to is under the condition
that you use it specifically for listening purposes only. (Didn’t realize there
were conditions involved, did you?) This means you cannot use it as your
own personal introduction music that people will associate with you. This
also means, no matter how appropriate your favorite song is, you cannot use
it as bed (background) music for your advertising. Unless you are granted
licenses and pay specific fees to the RIAA, you are in copyright violation
when playing music without permission.
One way of getting music for themes, background beds, and segues is to look
into what musicians and podcasters refer to as podsafe music. This is profes-
sionally produced music from independent artists who are offering their works
for podcasting use. The demand for podsafe music has been so high that the
Web site Podsafe Music Network (music.podshow.com) was launched, offering
a wide array of genres, artists, and musical works. Find out more about this
free service (shown in Figure 3-7), the conditions entailed in using podsafe
music, and what it can do to benefit your podcast.

Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
In addition to the big dogs who are passing the laws and legislation to restrain
your podcasting capabilities, there is a group out there (with science fiction
author and tech guru Cory Doctorow stepping forward as one of its more out-
spoken members) that looks out for you, the podcaster. The Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported organization working to protect the dig-
ital rights of the individual, to educate the media, lawmakers, and the public
on how technology affects their civil liberties, and uphold said civil liberties if
they are threatened.
A good example of EFF’s mission is its involvement in various legal cases con-
cerning URL domain registration and cybersquatters (individuals who buy
desired domains and then hold on to them, waiting for the highest bidder).
The EFF stands up for the rights of legitimate Web-site owners who happen
to own a domain that a larger corporation would desire to utilize.
The EFF, provided you have a strong case to contradict the findings of the
RIAA and the FCC, will stand up for you and give your voice a bit of power
when you’re standing up to a corporate legal machine.
Creative Commons (CC)
Founded in 2001, Creative Commons is a non-profit corporation dedicated to
helping the artist, the copyrighted material, and the individual who wishes
to use copyrighted material in a constructive manner but may not have the
resources to buy rights from groups like the RIAA.
Copyright protection is a double-edged sword for many in the artistic field.
On the positive side of a copyright, your work is protected so that no one 
can steal your work for their own personal profit, or if someone makes the
claim that you are simply ripping off their work, your copyright is proof that
your egg came before their chicken. That is the whole point of the copyright:
protection. The downside of this protection is that people now must go through
channels for approval to feature your words or your work in an educational
or referential manner; and while you are still given credit for the property fea-
tured, there is still a matter of approvals, fees for usage, and conditions that
must be met. Also, there are many contributors of the Internet who simply
want to share their work with others on no other terms but to contribute and
share with the world. Copyrights complicate this.
This complication of the digital copyright, protections, and desire to exchange
ideas, original creations, and concepts brought about the founding of the
Creative Commons (creativecommons.org). This organization (shown in
Figure 3-8) is dedicated to drafting and implementing licenses granting fair
use of copyrighted material via the Internet.
91
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

In the case of the podcaster, you want to offer your audio content to everyone,
not caring if listeners copy and distribute your MP3. As long as the listeners
give you credit, that’s all fine and good for you. CC can provide you with
licenses that aid you in letting people know your podcast is up for grabs as
long as others give credit where credit is due. CC provides these same licenses
for artists and musicians who would not mind at all if you used their music
for your podcast.
CC breaks down its licenses into four categories:
 Attribution: Grants permission for copying, distribution, display, and
performance of the original work and derivative works inspired from it,
provided credit to the artist(s) is given.
 Noncommercial: Grants permission for copying, distribution, display,
and performance of the original work and derivative works inspired from
it for noncommercial purposes only.
 No Derivative Works: Grants permission for copying, distribution, dis-
play, and performance of the original work only. No derivative works are
covered in this license category.
 Share Alike: Grants permission to others for distribution of derivative
works only. While the original work is not covered by this license, the
terms of this permission are similar to the No Derivative Works license.
Figure 3-8:

92
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

These four categories can be used as stand-alone licenses or can be mixed
and matched to fit the needs of the podcaster or the artist offering content
for the podcast.
The CC and its Web site give details, examples, and a FAQ page that answers
questions concerning the granting of licenses for use of protected content.
Just on the off-chance you do not find your answer on the Web site, it gives
contact information for its representatives. CC is a good group to know and
can open up opportunities for you to present new and innovative ideas and
works in your podcast.
I can name that tune . . . I wrote it!
Using almost anyone else’s music for your podcast can be an open invitation
for the RIAA to shut it down. This is primarily to protect the artist’s rights.
Think about it — how would you feel if you were enjoying a popular podcast,
receiving praise from all over the world, and while you’re thinking about
ways of taking the podcast to the next level, you turn on your radio and hear
your podcast being broadcast on a top-rated radio station. Soon, your pod-
cast is all the rage on the broadcasting airwaves — and you haven’t made
dollar one.
The same thing can be said for artists and their music. They work hard to
produce their work, and now podcasters are using their music to brand their
show, not bothering to compensate them for their efforts. Artists love to say
that they “do what we do for the love of the craft” — and many do — but in
the end, it’s their work — and artists have to pay the bills too.
So how can you use a piece of music without suffering the wrath of the RIAA
or FCC? Ask permission of the artist? Only if the artist owns the rights to the
music and the recordings. Otherwise, you also need to get written permission
from artists, musicians, record labels, producers. . . .
The best way to avoid the legal hassles is to avoid copyrighted material that
is not your own.
If you want to use published pieces that are not royalty-free, then ask the
artist directly (if you can) about getting permission to feature or use that
music on a regular basis. Compensation to the artist may come in the form of
a quick promotion at the beginning or end (or both) tags of the podcast. As
long as you have written permission from the artists and the artists have the
power to grant it (that is, haven’t signed the power over to their label or pub-
lisher), then you should be able to use their work to brand your show or 
93
Chapter 3: Before You Hit the Record Button

feature them on your podcast. (If you’re not sure whether you have the
appropriate permission, you may want to consult an attorney.) This is usually
acceptable with independent artists because, in many cases, they also own
the record label. Confirm this with artists. Otherwise, you run into the same
legal issues if you were to use music recorded by Queen, Switchfoot, or U2.
Why not offer up your podcast as a venue for the musician to sell his or her
work? Dave Slusher of Evil Genius Chronicles (www.evilgeniuschronicles.
org) has written permission from the Gentle Readers to use its music as
intro, exit, and background music for his podcast. In return, Dave eagerly 
promotes its CD Hi, Honey. This kind of promotion works well for the Gentle
Readers as well as artist Michelle Mallone (www.michellemalone.com). After
her music was featured on Dave’s podcast, her sales spiked — both through
her Web site and on iTunes!
I’ll take the First: Free 
speech versus slander
Words can (potentially, at least) get you in just as much trouble as music. The
legal definition of slander is a verbal form of defamation, or spoken words that
falsely and negatively reflect on one’s reputation.
So where does podcasting fit into all this? Well, the Internet is a kind of public
space. Think about it — before you open your mouth and begin a slam-fest on
someone you don’t like in the media or go on the personal attack with some-
one you work alongside, remember that your little rant is reaching MP3 players
around the world. Be sure — before you open your mouth to speak — that you
are not misquoting an article or merely assuming that your word is gospel. It
may sound like we’re going back to our original rules for interviewing guests,
but actually we’re going even further with this cautionary word: When express-
ing jaded opinions, have real evidence to back up what you say — and put up
or shut up!
It’s worth repeating here: If you have an in-studio guest, never lose sight of
that key word: guest. Be cool, be pleasant, be nice. Both of you — interviewer
and guest — are working together to create something special for the podcast.

Chapter 4
So What Are You Waiting For?
Record, Already!
In This Chapter
 Setting your levels and parameters
 Focusing on volume and projection
 Capturing ambient sound
 Pacing and clock management
 Going off on tangents
N
ow comes the part of podcasting you’ve been waiting for — recording.
This is it! You’ve got a high-performance or low-cost microphone point-
ing in the direction of your mouth, just waiting anxiously for you to begin
podcasting.
So what’s stopping you? Perhaps you have no clue how you sound to your
recording equipment, or perhaps you’re still trying to understand why your
smooth and sultry voice sounds distorted when recorded. The problem
could be in your audio application’s sound settings. Too much pep in the
voice, and you sound like Rob Zombie crooning a goth’s delight. Too little
amplification, and podcatchers would be better off if you just went out to
your front porch and shouted out your podcast’s content.
So before the podcast itself comes the process of setting levels and 
parameters — a fancy-schmancy way to say fiddling with knobs and sliders on
your mixing board or your audio-editing software to ensure that the signal
you’re sending through the microphone is loud and clear.
Did Your Sound Check Clear the Bank?
If you show up early enough for a rock concert, you see those roadies setting
up microphones, playfully waving to the crowd as they speak quickly into a

microphone “Check one, check two, check-check-check!” It’s a staple for rock-
and-rollers to do such a mic check because the fans expect it. Okay, maybe
the mic levels were set earlier that day, but it adds to the atmosphere to do
that “last-minute check” before the band hits the stage.
With podcasting, your own mic check should be more involved. In Chapter 3,
we recommended you perform a mic check just to assure yourself (and, if
applicable, your guests) that the equipment is working. The idea is not only
to confirm that your mic is picking up sound, but also to check the volume 
of the voices — yours, and the voices of anyone else involved in this podcast.
Understanding dB levels
Setting levels is quite easy, provided you know where your decibel (dB) input
levels are displayed on your software. The decibel unit is used to express the
intensity of sound, beginning at zero for the least perceptible sound to approx-
imately 130 for an intensely loud sound level. Your VU (Volume Unit) readout
measures how “hot” you are (that’s the power of your voice, not how good
you look) on the microphone. Audio signal strength (measured in decibels) is
the amount of power that goes into the signal — which affects how clearly it
can be heard and how hard it hits the ears. “Loud and clear” is good; too
much signal strength causes distortion, and that’s a pain to listen to.
In vintage radio and audio equipment, this dB display was the VU meter — the
little needle that bounced in response to your voice. Later, the needle was
replaced by lights that reacted when you spoke into a microphone, going
from green to yellow to orange to red. What they said was pretty easy to
translate:
 Green: Well, I can hear you, but wow, are you quiet!
 Yellow: I can hear you better, but you’re still kind of soft.
 Orange: Hey now, that’s a mighty fine voice you’ve got there.
 Red: Wow — that’s a powerful voice you’ve got there!
 Red with double bars: Why are you shouting?
With each application, VU meters will appear different (as you see with
Audacity in Figure 4-1), but they all serve the same purpose: to make sure
your content is heard clearly. Your aim, as you speak and watch the indica-
tors speak back, is to keep your dB levels bouncing in the high level (low red)
without lighting up those double bars. When you attain that average, your voice
is rising and falling within a balanced dynamic range of around 0 dB. In this
case, a big fat zero is a good thing. It means your audio equipment and your
voice are in balance so you can produce a strong signal without distortion.

Because microphones, audio-capture cards, and mixing boards all work at dif-
ferent sensitivity levels, it’s best to test your voice before you record. If your
levels are in the green, it means you’re loud enough to be heard by your equip-
ment, but still may be undermodulated, or so soft that people will have to
crank up the volume on their computers or portable MP3 players, consequently
blowing out their eardrums on their next podcast or CD. Undermodulated
voices tend to register into the negative dB numbers.

Calling in the crew
It’d be great to set your levels so “0 dB” is always
where your lights remain, but recording is a real-
world activity. Sometimes your meter may never
reach yellow, and other times it might hit the
double red bars. If your goal is to maintain per-
fect levels from the beginning to the end of a
recording session, an audio crew can work with
you in rehearsal and performance, adjusting
levels when you go loud and when you go soft. 
The downside of hiring a crew does mean an
added expense to producing your podcast. Even
if the crew is a collection of audio geek friends,
it can still cost you in sending out for a lot of
pizza every time you record. 

Overmodulated voices also tend to cause problems for listeners. They will
have their MP3 players set for a pleasant, comfortable volume . . . and sud-
denly your show begins with guns blazing and pipes blaring. As your levels
reach deep into the red, listeners fumble for their players and try to turn
down the sound so the program can be understandable through its own dis-
tortion. Sadly, the modulation is such a problem that your voice crackles and
growls as it tramples the volume limits of your recording equipment, even at
the lower volume.
In achieving a balance in your audio, you could spend the day setting and
resetting those levels in quest of dB nirvana. (That’s time spent, but not well
spent.) It makes more sense to practice till you get a pretty good sense of
what your best working level is and get comfortable speaking into a mic at
that level. Time to go mano-a-mano with setting the levels.
Setting your levels
Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to keep your levels in the
neighborhood of 0 dB, dipping and spiking when necessary. For podcasting,
consistency is key. Setting levels consists of only a few steps:
1. Begin talking into the mic about your podcast topic or plans.
This can be a scripted test read or just you talking off the top of your
head, speaking in the manner and mood of your podcast.
2. While you’re talking (or if you’re monitoring by playing back your
test takes), keep an eye on your dB levels.
If they’re spiking into the double-red/red area or remaining in the green,
then check your input volume settings on your mixing board or audio-
editing software.
3. Re-record your voice at the new settings.
Try to speak in the same manner and inflection as you did on the first
recording.
4. As you review the second take, watch the dB input levels and adjust
accordingly.
After you set your levels, make a note of the settings somewhere other than
your computer (using, say, a PDA or its retro ancestor — a legal pad and
pen), in case your preferences are lost or fiddled out of whack by somebody’s
child or best friend playing spaceship in your studio. (Yes, even adults enjoy
playing spaceship with really super-cool looking equipment!) That way, even
if something awful happens to your application’s preferences or your mixing
board, you always have your last known settings to reference.

Fire Sign Podcasting: Volume 
and Projection
Even if you never much felt like portraying Hamlet, podcasting is like acting:
You’re trying to captivate an audience. So here’s a time-honored actor’s tech-
nique, normally used for doing an aside or “focusing on the horizon” during
dialogue with other actors: Fire Sign Acting. It’s called that because the best
focal point to pick was the always-visible fire-exit sign (or vicinity) at the
back of the theater. Actors were trained to project their voices so the back
row could hear the dialogue as clearly as the front row, without anyone
having to screech or bellow.
If you’re wondering why you’d have to project your voice when a perfectly
good mic is sitting in front of you, remember that technology isn’t the be all
and end all solution. While Chapter 2 describes several models of microphones,
this chapter touts the art of setting levels, and a quality microphone (plus
some care with levels) helps a podcast immensely.
So will Fire Sign Podcasting.
Suppose, for example, you’re podcasting without the benefit of that MXL 990
Cardioid Condenser Mic with Shockmount you’ve been saving up for, and you’re
currently working with that modest Griffin Technologies iTalk (retail cost about
$39.99) handy — and you’re including several people besides yourself in this
podcast. Then the volume and projection of each voice is as important as it
would be in a mic-less theater.
Microphones such as the iTalk are inexpensive and easy to use (especially if
you’re recording podcasts on the move), but they have a very limited range.
If you don’t hold that mic close enough to your mouth, it may pick up more of
the surroundings and less of you. Also, mics like these don’t give you much
nuance to play with if you have to wrestle with the levels in post-production
(which can include tweaking less-than-perfect recordings to “sweeten” their
quality by using filters and output settings). Trying to balance levels in post-
production is similar to working with a bad scan in Photoshop: You can make
some improvements, but a bad scan is still a bad scan. The same thing can be
said for audio files. Moral: Know what your microphone can do, and use it to
provide the best original audio possible by (for example) having everyone in
the podcast speak directly into the mic within its range. Unless you’re all in a
football huddle, that means voice projection — Fire Sign Podcasting.
To improve your chances of creating files that need less tinkering in post-
production, you need to know how voice projection works. The techniques may
99
Chapter 4: So What Are You Waiting For? Record Already!

sound a little weird — okay, really weird — because normally most of us
don’t pay much attention to how we talk. But professional actors and voice
talent use these techniques (in varying styles and approaches), and they
work. They can make recording sessions, both in studio and on location, a
breeze. Here’s the drill:
1. Take a nice, deep breath allowing your stomach to push out a bit.
The action in pushing out your stomach gives your diaphragm (the curved
muscle separating the abdomen from the lung area) enough tension that
you can support your lungs’ current air supply and control exhaling. It
also gives your voice a little extra kick.
2. Hold the microphone you’re using (iTalk, eMic, whatever) a short dis-
tance away from your mouth and direct your voice to the microphone.
The difference between talking into the microphone and directing your
voice to it is focus:
• Talking into the microphone means you have your mouth closer to
the mic and are talking in a more conversational tone (while still
supporting your voice).
• Directing your voice to a microphone means the microphone isn’t
as close to you — instead of a conversational tone, you now have
to make your voice heard across an expanse.
So, instead of speaking into thin air in the vague direction of the mic (or
the person next to you), speak in the exact direction of the mic, pointing
your voice directly at the recording device (as shown in Figure 4-2). Even
if the mic isn’t omnidirectional, it can pick up your voice better this way.
3. Begin talking, using either scripted or improvised material, and
remember to talk a bit louder than usual because you’re competing
with background noise.
When talking, open your mouth a bit wider and slightly over-enunciate.
The distance between your mouth and the mic can play havoc with your
consonants; make sure they sound clear.
4. Play back your final file and tinker with it using your audio-editing
software package. (See Chapter 5 for the lowdown on editing.)
When you have a pretty clear idea of what will make this file sound
good, write down these settings on that same legal pad where you jot
down your studio levels, and make a note that your post-production
should start at these levels. Because every recording situation is differ-
ent, don’t expect your post-production process to use the same settings
as your field recordings.
100
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

In an ideal world, you could test this type of recording in the setting where
you’ll be podcasting, practicing voice projection and volume so traffic, crowd
noise, or boomy echoes don’t drown you out. If you have a chance to test-
record yourself in the setting you’ll be in (be it a hotel room, outdoors, or 
on location), do it. In practice, most podcasts-on-the-go never know where
they’ll wind up, but a dry run can help. You’ll be better prepared for post-
production if you take your portable equipment outside and try recording in
the midst of kids playing, weed-whackers whacking, and blustery days when
the wind is particularly strong.
And speaking of the background noise filtering in . . .
Noises Off: Capturing Ambient Noise
Part of the charm that is podcasting is just how varied the content is, as 
well as how spontaneous the shows tend to be when the record button is 
hit. Some podcasters believe that a “true” podcast (whatever that is!) must
record everything in one take and deliver its content to listeners completely
unedited. This supposed mark-of-authenticity includes any background noise
(also called ambient noise) you happen to capture while recording — you
know, rustling trees, birdcalls, pounding car stereos, jackhammers, the usual.

Chapter 4: So What Are You Waiting For? Record Already!

Identifying ambient noise 
you want to edit out
As we discuss in Chapter 5, how much you edit depends on what kind of con-
tent you’re presenting. For example, if you’re doing an off-the-cuff, off-the-wall
podcast about your life and a typical day in it, you may just grab the iTalk,
plug it into your iPod, and head out the door, recording every step along the
way. This kind of podcast can be (note we said can be) easiest to record.
You’re podcasting a slice of Americana . . . or Britanniana, if you’re in the
United Kingdom . . . or Australiana if you’re podcasting from Down Under.
Especially if your goal is to capture the look and feel of your culture, ambient
noise is not only welcomed, but desired. Up to a point.
Some podcasts cringe at the mere mention of ambient noise — podcasts 
like . . . well, like Tee’s. Since January 20, 2005, he’s been podcasting MOREVI:
The Chronicles of Rafe & Askana, a swashbuckling epic fantasy adventure 
featuring martial arts, nail-biting cliffhangers, dark sorcery, swordplay, and
a hint of romance to make things interesting. So imagine: He’s worked to
create a magical setting with voice, story, music, special effects . . . a world
completely shattered by real-world blunders like school buses, kids at recess,
UPS trucks, the Virginia Commuter Rail system, and air traffic from two nearby
airports. (Oh, and he became a dad in summer 2004. Even if you love the source
of the ambient noise, sometimes it just doesn’t fit what the podcast is trying
to do.)
For this sort of podcast, when you schedule recording sessions is the start of
your production. The rest is soundproofing and editing. On average, if you
record 30 minutes’ worth of material, you can usually expect to edit out 10 to
15 minutes on account of ambient noise (especially if you’re recording during
the day). If you live in a noisy neighborhood, figure out which times are qui-
etest and use those to record the imaginary bits that would suffer from
unwanted ambient noise. To continue reducing the intrusion of the outside
world and still maintain a budget, some creativity is in order, as we describe
in the next section.
Minimizing ambient noise
Truth be told, there really isn’t an easy solution to podcasting in a noisy world.
One not-so-cost-effective answer is to rent a studio and record your podcast
there. Unless you have a sponsor who will bankroll your costs, your “hobby”
could easily max out credit cards and cast a hungry eye upon your nest egg.
(Let’s not even go there.)
A somewhat-less-expensive option is to soundproof your home-based recording
room. That may sound simple, but it can involve a lot of home improvement
before you have one room in which you can be sure the only sound is yours.
102
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

And that’s seriously frowned upon if you’re renting an apartment. So, let’s
keep this affordable:
 Stuff towels under the door. It decreases the amount of sound from
inside your house filtering into your recording area.
 Keep the microphone as far away from your computer as possible; then
its fan (if audible) simply becomes part of the natural ambiance (also
known as white noise) for the podcasting room.
 Turn off any ceiling fans, floor heaters, additional air conditioners, or
room ionizers. The fewer appliances that are running, the less chance
exists of additional ambient sound being created.
 If you do encounter ambient noise that you don’t want in your podcast,
simply give it a few moments. Wait until the noise subsides, pause, and
then pick up your podcast a few lines before the interruption. That’s for
the sake of post-production: With a substantial gap in your podcast
activity, you can easily narrow down where your edits are needed.
When noise interferes with your podcast, leaving gaps of silence so you know
where to edit isn’t exactly a foolproof method. Always set aside enough time
to listen to your podcast — and really listen, not just play it back while you
clean the office or call a friend. Make sure levels are even, no segments are
repeated, and the final product is ready for uploading and posting.
Many podcasts rely on ambient noise to set a mood, but sometimes reality
just doesn’t cut it. If you want to put more craft into the setting for your pod-
cast, the ideas in this section should help you keep the background down to
a dull roar.
When holding podcasts-on-location, make sure the ambiance — be it a partic-
ularly busy crosswalk at a street corner, a frequented bar, or backstage at a
concert — does not overwhelm your voice. Background noise belongs in
(well, yeah) the background. Its intent is to set a tone for the aim of the 
podcast, not to become the podcast itself. It would also be a good idea, if
possible, to do a few test recordings in the space to see how much volume
you’ll need and how close to the mic you have to be in order to be heard.
Now Take Your Time and Hurry Up:
Pacing and Clock Management
Podcasts, whether short and sweet or epic and ambitious, all share some-
thing in common: the need for pacing. As a rule, you don’t want to blurt out
the aim or intent of your podcast in the opening five minutes and then pad
the remaining ten or 15 with fluff. Nor do you want to drone on and on (and
on . . .) till suddenly you have to rush frantically into why you’re podcasting
103
Chapter 4: So What Are You Waiting For? Record Already!

on this particular day about this particular topic. Give yourself ample time to
set the mood comfortably and competently, and make it to the intent without
dawdling. Why rush your moment in the spotlight? Enjoy your podcast, but
make certain you don’t overstay your welcome. The trick in pacing a podcast
is really understanding how much time you have to get your message across.
So the big question is how to really grasp how much time you really have.
Where to start?
You can start with the here and now: Find a clock, watch, or stopwatch and
for one minute (and only one minute) sit quietly and do nothing, say nothing,
and remain perfectly still. That one minute will feel like a short eternity. Now
imagine that one minute times 15. (No, no, no — do not repeat this exercise
for 15 minutes. There’s a fine line between an exercise and a complete waste
of time. . . .)
You have a good amount of time on your hands, so you should make certain
that in your podcast you take your time getting to the message. The journey
you take your listeners on doesn’t necessarily have to occupy all of 15 or
20 minutes, but you have time to play. That is the most important thing to
remember as you set your best podcasting pace.
Take the potato out of your 
mouth and enunciate
This following section is dedicated to Evo’s co-host of The Dragon Page,
Michael R. Mennenga. We love the guy, but, man, does he need to take a
breath, give himself a moment, and think before speaking. It’s rough enough
when your co-host is constantly riding you like a Triple Crown winner, but
when Bruce Campbell (Ash from the Evil Dead films, and Elvis from Bubba 
Ho-tep) puts you in your place, an intervention is in order.
And sometimes, all you need to sharpen your speech and your vocabulary is
to take a breath.
It is not out of the ordinary to fire up the mic and launch into your podcast
with enough energy and vitality to power a small shire in England. Nothing
wrong with that — until you go back and listen to yourself. Your words,
phrases, and thoughts are running together and forming one turbulent, muddy
stream of thought. Yes, that is your voice, but even you’re having a tough time
keeping up and understanding what the podcast is about and what the pod-
caster is saying . . . and you’re the podcaster!
One way of getting a grip on pacing yourself through a podcast is enunciation —
pronouncing your words distinctly, explaining your topic clearly — and there
is no better way to do that than to slow your speech slightly and listen 
104
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

carefully to certain consonants (for example, the t, s, and d sounds). In fact, 
it isn’t a bad idea to over-enunciate. In the excitement of recording, over-
enunciation actually forces you to slow down, clean up your pronunciation,
and make your voice easily understandable.
Speaking a few tongue-twisters before going on mic helps your enunciation,
as well as warms up your voice and prepares it for the podcast you’re about
to record. Here are some easy ones that emphasize the problem consonants
lost when speaking too quickly:
 Toot the tin trumpet, Tommy, in time.
 Pop prickly pickles past the peck of parsley.
 See sand slip silently through the sunlit seals.
 Will Wendy remember wrecking the white rocker?
If you perform a search online for tongue twisters, you can find a wide variety
of classic and original warm-ups for the voice. You can also take the twisters
you find and compose your own. Proper enunciation may help you set a com-
fortable pace and keep you from rushing through your presentation.
And now let’s take a break 
for station identification
Ever notice that certain podcasts suddenly break in with a show ID or take
some other marked break, and then (if they are lucky enough to have spon-
sors) play their sponsors’ spots? They’re trying to emulate — maybe make
themselves easily syndicated by — conventional radio. You know — the
broadcasting industry. Clock management is the careful, standardized inter-
ruption of a typical radio broadcast — usually every 15 minutes in a one-hour
slot — for such necessities as station identification, show identification,
public-service announcements, and (of course) commercials.
This opens up the great debate as to whether or not podcasting should
become a commercial venue, but tailoring a podcast for the broadcast air-
waves, or even scheduling in quarterly breaks in the hour, can actually work
in your favor.
Clock management usually works in this fashion during an hour:
 :00 — programming break, station identification, show ID, PSAs, 
advertisements
 :15 — programming break, PSAs, advertisements
105
Chapter 4: So What Are You Waiting For? Record Already!

 :30 — programming break, station identification, show ID, PSAs, 
advertisements
 :45 — programming break, PSAs, advertisements
These breaks vary in length, but can last anywhere from two minutes to five
minutes. While we list “show ID” (something like “You’re listening to Dragon
Page’s Cover to Cover with Michael and Evo . . .”) being at the top of the hour
and on the half-hour, you can really drop in a show ID anytime you feel like it.
Coming back from a break, you can ID yourself, just to remind people what
they’re listening to.
No surprise that this is where hardcore podcasters get a bit restless. They
find clock management and show ID redundant, if not frivolous. Why bother
to break or even drop in a show bumper? People have downloaded your feed
specifically. They know what they’re listening to, so what purpose does clock
management serve?
It all comes back to what you see for your podcast’s future. If you intend to
remain in the podosphere (as the aforementioned hardcore podcasters refer to
the community of podcasters and loyal listeners), then it really comes down
to your format, your way. No constraints from the FCC or RIAA. It’s just you,
the microphone, your listeners, and caution to the wind. However, if you set
your sights for the broadcast airwaves — be it AM, FM, or satellite radio —
then you have to format your show to fit the standards. This may not sound
like a challenge, but when Michael and Evo took their Dragon Page show from
a pre-recorded venue to a live call-in show, a jump that appeared no larger
than a hop actually became a leap, particularly in the dynamics between the
two of them and the pace of the show.
106
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 
Writing with experience
Tee’s coming to Podcasting For Dummies with
experiences from podcasting his debut novel and
contributing to other podcasts, but it’s the co-
writer of this book, Evo Terra, who continues to
apply many of the techniques discussed in this
chapter in the three shows Cover to Cover,
Wingin’ It, and Slice of Scifi. Along with Michael
R. Mennenga, these three shows not only con-
tinue to raise bars and set standards in podcast-
ing, but are enjoying successful jumps from
podcasting to broadcast radio.
Michael and Evo’s Cover to Cover already
adhered to the broadcasting standards of clock
management because it initially started as a
syndicated radio show. With the habit already
in place, their spinoff shows Wingin’ It and Slice
of Scifi were easy to work the same way. The
advantage to sticking with this format is their
shows are ready for the jump to standard
broadcast radio. At present, radio may seem
like a far jump from podcast, but the jump is pos-
sible as Cover to Cover now runs on XM
Satellite Radio.

Think about the possibilities of your podcast, and where you see yourself
with it several months (or years) down the road. Maybe a bit of management
and organization will aid your podcast in jumping to the airwaves.
Concerning Tangents, and Their 
Val — Oh, Look, a Butterfly!
It is hardly surprising that broadcasters who have no experience in broad-
casting will stray from their topic once the microphone goes hot, and then
lose themselves in the thickets and thorns of tangents. Defensive podcasters
claim that’s part of the charm of podcasting, but that charm fades as the
topic gets more serious. If (for example) you launch a podcast intent on
addressing the growing concern of television violence and wander into
American Idol trivia, don’t be surprised if your audience wanders away.
It’s worth repeating: Stay focused on the intent of your podcast. Remaining
true to your podcast’s intent is not just a matter of staying within your run-
ning time; it also makes clear to your listeners that yes, you have a message
and you will deliver it. You haven’t promised something substantial only to let
your mind and commentary wander aimlessly. When people listen, you want
them to feel assured that what they will hear is exactly what you’ve offered.
“Say, that reminds me of something . . .”
Of course, tangents can also be creative opportunities. You don’t necessarily
treat tangents as strictly verboten in podcasting. Say your commentary begins
with “Anyone notice how cell phones are no longer just cell phones but tiny
PDAs that can be easily monitored and hacked into?” and then suddenly break
off on a tangent about cell phone etiquette and the lack of manners it brings
out of people. This is a tangent that will keep your listeners engaged — and
that can count as much as staying on topic.
107
Chapter 4: So What Are You Waiting For? Record Already!
Podcasting amateur hour?
Broadcasting networks that present to the air-
waves (like it or not) talk-radio celebrities like
Sean Hannity, Howard Stern, and Rush (no, not
the kickin’ rock group from Canada, but the big
man of the Right Wing, Rush Limbaugh . . .) are
now taking their shows to the podosphere as a
way to market their shows and reach a wider,
worldwide audience.
Along with the talk-radio personalities, other
major players in broadcasting turning to pod-
casting as an alternative include ESPN, Disney,
the BBC, and ABC.

What if your podcast isn’t so structured, though? There’s nothing wrong with
hitting Record and forging ahead into the great unknown of the next 15 or
20 minutes, so long as you have an idea of where you want to go. If, say, your
podcast is about movies but your review of The Fantastic Four suddenly goes
into the decline of the comic book industry (regardless of the onslaught
of comic-books-to-film productions), then you still have a sense of focus.
However, if your review of The Fantastic Four wanders off into how your cat
is throwing up hairballs every time you podcast or that your car’s sunroof
chose to stop working, blah, blah, what the heck is going on here? Your audi-
ence may grow frustrated enough to stop listening. Tangents are terrific in
moderation, but put some reins on ’em and keep them at least (well, yeah)
tangentially related to the subject matter of your podcast.
“But getting back to what 
I was saying earlier . . .”
When you’re podcasting for 15 or 20 minutes (or longer . . .), it’s okay to take
the scenic route with your podcast, but make sure that you return to the
point you wanted to make in this particular (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly)
installment. The listener’s delight in podcasts is often the revelation that indi-
viduals who (in many cases) have never set foot in a recording studio can
produce entertaining, and even informative, shows. Sometimes meandering
back to the point is part of that delight.
For instance, a podcast might begin with something read in the headlines —
say, a new marketing strategy launched by Team Mobile to reach a wider
client base. This can lead to a variety of topics in the discussion, such as the
following:
 Multipurpose cell phones that play MP3s, video clips, text messages, or
(why not? maybe soon) podcasts
 Costs for services from various carriers
 Ways that carriers could bring down the costs of services
 Continued shortcomings and disappointments from the cell-phone
industry
But in the last five to ten minutes, a simple segue like “So, to recap our
thoughts on this bold marketing strategy from Deutch Telecomm and Team
Mobile . . .” can successfully steer you, or you and your co-hosts, back to
the aim and intent of your podcast. If you return deliberately from a tangent,
your listening audience arrives back at the point and knows the destination
as well as the scenery they went through to get there.
Get your listeners there and back again. Not only will they appreciate it, but
they will tell others about your podcast, and your subscribers will grow in
numbers.

 Adding bed music for a comfortable podcast
 Introducing intros and outros
A
lthough a high-tech activity like podcasting doesn’t exactly qualify as
quaint, “the charm of podcasting” is (as Steve Jobs describes it) a
Wayne’s World approach to broadcasting. In Wayne’s World, two Illinois
teenagers, Wayne and Garth, shoot a television show in Wayne’s basement.
They rock and roll their afternoons away for their local cable-access station,
all on the budget that their allowance (and perhaps the odd sponsor or two)
can swing.
Podcasts, much like Wayne’s World, are usually done on a shoestring budget
and shot in one take, with no editing. All the trip-ups and tangents are cap-
tured for posterity and sent out to MP3 players everywhere. This is part of
the homespun appeal that podcasting not only is known for, but prides itself
in nurturing as new and innovative podcasters enter the podosphere.
While podcasting purists may harbor animosity toward the editing process,
sometimes it makes all the difference between a listenable podcast and an
incoherent mess of senseless rambling. For example, you might want to elimi-
nate the sound of a train going by, or silence a cough that would otherwise
distract your listeners from a brilliant riposte. This chapter shows you how
to use editing to shape your podcast while retaining its natural atmosphere,
adding depth to that atmosphere with music, and then give the final touch to
your podcast’s format with an introduction and exit.
A Few Reasons to Consider Editing
Take a serious look at the script and the mood you want to convey with your
podcast. From there, you will be able to judge how intense your editing 

workload will be. The following list explains some instances where editing is
needed — and (trust us) your podcast will benefit from it:
 Ambient noise: As explained in Chapter 4, ambient noise is the natural
and spontaneously occurring noise you may pick up when recording
your podcast. In some productions, such as podiobooks (books podcast
one chapter at a time, in a serialized format), moods and atmospheres
must be maintained. In others — say, a sketch comedy like Area 51
(area51show.com) — continuity and clarity are established, requiring 
a certain amount of editing simply to control ambient noise. If you are
conducting an in-studio interview and suddenly a passing siren or the
rumble of a garbage truck makes it into your recording, the noise can
disrupt the momentum of the interview and distract the audience.
 Running times: Another good reason to edit your podcasts: running
times. You just wrapped your latest podcast with a great interview, and
you’re confident that you have plenty of material for your 30-minute
podcast. And then you check again and realize that you have recorded
over 90 minutes’ worth of interview. And you love all of it! Now here’s
where editing works in your favor. Your listeners expect 30 minutes, give
or take a segment or two, from your podcast. You could run the whole
thing, unedited, but that might test the patience of your audience (not to
mention their bandwidth and file storage). Or you could divide it into
two 45-minute interviews, breaking up the airplay of the interviews with
two smaller podcasts in-between the segments. In this approach to edit-
ing, everyone wins.
Editing can easily increase your productivity with podcasts. True, some
podcasters define “editing” as cutting and deleting material, but there’s
more to it. Editing can actually help you rescue discussions and content
that would otherwise be hard to shoehorn into one podcast.
 Scripted material: Some podcasters argue that the true podcast is done
in one take, but as podcasting matures as a medium, audiences grow
more and more demanding. Expectations for a podcast change when
your podcast includes scripted material. Editing is a necessity in these
situations. With dramatic readings and productions, moments of “ah”
and “um” should be edited out to maintain the clarity of the story, as
well as maintain the mood or atmosphere established in your reading.
With the rising popularity of audio literature in the podosphere, profes-
sionalism and performance are the keys to a good product — and usually
that means (yep) editing. If you feel that editing would mar the spontane-
ity of your podcast — but still want to present literature or other scripted
material — ask yourself how good you think Lord of the Rings would had
been if Ian McKellen or Viggo Mortensen did everything in one take.
Imagine their dialogue sounding like this:
Gandalf: Frodo . . . he, uuummm, grows closer to, you know, the end. I
wonder if, um, he’s, ahh . . . alive.
110
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

Aragorn: Ummm . . . what *sneezes suddenly — sniffle sniffle* . . . what
does your heart *ahem* tell you?
Not what we would call riveting drama. With scripted material, editing is
a must.
The Art of Editing
Editing out breaks, stammers, and trip-ups may sound easy, but there’s a sci-
ence to it. If you cut off too much from a clip, one word comes right on top 
of another, and you sound unnatural. There is also the problem of having
pauses that seem to last too long between thoughts. When you’re editing
voice, the key is to review, review, review.
There are lots of audio applications out there, each with its own way to edit
out stumbles and bumbles (and moments of silence to honor a lost thought). 
The same principles apply to all of those applications:
1. Find the unwanted content.
2. Give your clip a second or two of silence as leader or “play area”
between edits.
3. Review the edit, making sure it sounds smooth and natural; an effective
edit doesn’t sound like an edit.
But instead of talking about it, how about you do it? In this section, we go
into basic editing using GarageBand (www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/)
and Audacity (audacity.sourceforge.net) as examples. These are two
very common audio-editing software packages in podcasting, and both serve
as our benchmarks in how to create podcasts. If you’re using some other
audio-editing software package, the steps are similar enough for you to apply
to your own project.
Editing voice with GarageBand
You can use GarageBand to edit out awkward gaps of silence or eliminate
coughs and stammers from your podcast. To prepare for such edits, split
your audio into smaller segments in order to isolate the audio that you want
to remove. You do that by following these steps:
1. Determine where in the track you want to make the edit by clicking
and dragging the playhead to the beginning point of your edit.
Use the Time Display readout to see exactly how long the gap of silence
runs. The playhead tool is the triangle connected to a vertical red line.
When creating segments, you want to place this line at the beginning
and ending points of your edit. (See Figure 5-1 for details.)
111
Chapter 5: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!

2. Isolate the area that you want to delete: Move the playhead to where
you want the edit to begin, and then choose Edit➪Split to make the
first cut.
Figure 5-1 shows the first cut.
3. Now move your playhead to the location where you want the edit to
end. Then choose Edit➪Split to make your next cut.
As you edit, give yourself a second or two of silent “play area” at the
beginning and end of your edits. It makes the editing of two segments
sound like one continuous segment, and they’ll be a little easier to mix
together.
4. Single-click the segment between your two cuts and then press the
Delete key.
If you’re working with GarageBand for the first time, note that the first
track of audio is selected by default. To deselect the segment you’re
editing, single-click anywhere in the gray area underneath the track(s)
you’re working on.

5. To join the two remaining segments, click and drag the right-hand seg-
ment over the left-hand audio segment, overlapping the two (as shown
in Figure 5-2).
The selected segment overlaps and takes priority over the unselected
segment, effectively erasing any content there.
6. Click and drag the playhead to any point before the edit and hit the
Play button to review.
7. If the edit doesn’t sound natural, undo the changes (by choosing
Edit➪Undo Change of Position Region) and try again.
Because you’re allowed multiple undos in both versions of GarageBand,
you can step back in your project to begin at the first Split command.
If you want to find out more about GarageBand, I recommend Dr. Mac’s
GarageBand For Dummies. Bob Levitus gives you the grand tour and keeps
you in the know on how to work this terrific application.
Editing voice with Audacity
Audacity users can follow these steps to make a basic edit:
1. Find the segment that you want to edit.
To view the entire timeline of your project, click the Fit Project in
Window tool, shown here in the margin.
Figure 5-2:
To shorten
the silence,
move one

113
Chapter 5: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!

You can easily navigate between the segments of your timelines and the
project timeline as a whole with the Fit Project in Window and Fit Selection
in Window tools, located in the top-right section of the project window.
2. Click the Selection tool and then click and drag across the unwanted
segment.
The unwanted segment is highlighted, as shown in Figure 5-3.
Right about here would be a good opportunity to use the Fit Selection in
Window tool to make certain the selection border does not go into the
recorded content you want to keep.
3. Single-click the segment between your two cuts and then press the
Delete key (Mac) or the Backspace key (Windows).
You can also use Edit➪Cut or Ú+X (Mac)/Ctrl+X (Windows) to remove
the unwanted segment.
Do not use the Trim command (HERE’S THE COMMAND NOT TO USE:
Edit➪Trim or Ú+T for Mac/Ctrl+T for Windows). While you may think
you are trimming away unwanted content, this command works differ-
ently from the Ú+T command in GarageBand: As when you crop an
image, it trims off unselected material — leaving you with only the con-
tent you wanted to edit out. Ack!
Figure 5-3:

114

4. Review the clip. If the edit does not sound natural to you, undo the
changes via the menus (Edit➪Undo Change of Position Region) or Ú+Z
(Mac) or Ctrl+Z (Windows), and try again.
You are allowed multiple undos in Audacity, giving you the ability to
go back to the beginning point of your editing just in case you are not
happy with the sound of the edit.
Making Your Musical Bed (And Lying 
in It): Background Music
On listening to podcasts of people in interview situations or in round table
discussions, there can be a strange sense of isolation, especially if the con-
versation hits a pocket of dead air (when conversation or the signal stops),
and only silence is recorded or broadcast.
A few podcasters like to add a little bit of atmosphere in their individual pod-
cast with bed music — a background soundtrack that’s usually two to three
minutes long, and looped so it can play again and again throughout the pod-
cast, if desired. Sometimes the bed music will last only a minute or two into
the podcast when the hosts return from the break, and some hosts prefer to
keep it going from beginning to end, fading it out if they are bringing in any
other sources of audio (voice mail, other podcast promos, ads, and so on).
Regardless of how long the loop is, you must obtain permission from the artists
to use their music and give them audible credit — either at the beginning or
end of your podcast. These are conditions of Web sites such as PodSafe Music
Network (music.podshow.com/). Other options include using music loops
found in GarageBand, Audition, or Soundtrack.
115
Chapter 5: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!
Hate editing? Get real . . .
Are there exceptions to the rule? Absolutely! Yes,
a performance is at its best when your actors are
stammer-free, but back in 1938 there was a radio
drama that was chock-full of trip-ups, stutters,
and “fluffs” as Paul Jenkins of RevUp Review
(www.revupreview.co.uk) calls them. With
all this going against its production, the Mercury
Theatre terrified a nation with its adaptation of
H.G. Wells’ War of the Worlds, arguably the first
“reality-based” entertainment (well, a realistic
simulation of reality, anyway) unleashed on
America — the fluffs intensified the illusion of
reality. If your podcast is primarily entertainment
anchored in reality, then you can probably avoid
the arduous editing process. Again, it depends
on the content you’re podcasting.

As you add music as a background bed, incorporate sound effects, and bring
in pre-recorded audio from other sources (such as an iRiver or a Skype call),
the sound of your podcast gets more complex. Balance becomes not only
harder, but also more essential. (Note, for example, the various volume levels
of the multiple tracks in Figure 5-4.)
Finding the right balance
Bed music should add atmosphere to your podcast. That means finding a
proper balance between the talking of the hosts and the soundtrack. The 
following sections explain why you want to avoid music that’s too soft or 
too loud.
What is that noise?
If your music is too soft, your looped music could be mistaken for unwanted
ambient noise of someone listening to music in the next room. Or it could be
regarded as some kind of technical difficulty such as a stray signal bleeding
(another wireless audio signal accidentally being picked up by the same fre-
quency as your own wireless audio device) into the podcaster’s wireless
microphone. Music too indistinct to hear can be a distraction, particularly in
quiet moments or pauses in the conversation. Your audience might end up
hammering out e-mail after e-mail (asking what’s making that annoying noise)
or trying to figure out what that faint music in the background is.

them can be

Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

Could you speak up? I can’t hear you for the music . . .
When bed music is too loud, your voice is lost in the melody. Music, espe-
cially classical music and selections that rise and fall in intensity (like any
good Queen album), can be really tricky to mix into a conversation.
You do want to allow your audience to hear the music in the background, but
the music, if it is being used as background music, probably isn’t the point
of the podcast. It shouldn’t be so loud that you have to pump up your own
voice track to be heard.
Never sacrifice audio clarity so bed music can be heard and identified clearly.
If you want to showcase music, then showcase music properly. Otherwise,
your bed music should remain in the background as a setting, not in the fore-
front of your podcast.
Applying bed music the right way
When you’re setting audio levels, you want to find the best blend of music
and voice, ensuring one doesn’t overpower the other. Both tracks should
work together and not struggle for dominance. Always listen to your podcast
before uploading it to the Internet — review, review, review, and find that 
balance.
To avoid music that is either too soft or too loud, keep the following points in
mind as you apply the bed music:
 Experiment with levels for the music before you record voice. Watch
your VU meter and set your music between –11 to 16dB, depending on
the music or sound effects you are using.
 When you’re comfortable with the bed’s level, lay down a voice track
and see how your project’s overall levels look (as well as sound) on your
VU meter. Remember, your aim is to keep your voice in the “0” or red
area without overmodulating. With the music bed now behind your
voice, it’s much easier to hit the red without effort.
 Avoid “uneven” music, or music that suddenly dips low and then has
moments of sudden intensity. The best music-bed-friendly loops have an
even sound (whether driving and dramatic or laid-back and relaxed) and
an even level.
 Experiment with putting your music at the beginning and at the ending of
your podcast instead of throughout. In these cases, music beds announce
upcoming breaks and pauses in your podcast.

Setting volume levels for bed music
Each audio application has its own way to change volume dynamically — but
the basic process is the same. In the sections that follow, you find out how to
use GarageBand and Audacity to bring music into your podcast at full volume,
and then balance it to be just audible enough in the background.
Setting volume levels with GarageBand
Follow these steps to set volume levels with GarageBand:
1. Click to select the track icon (usually represented by a silhouette of a
person) that your voice resides on.
This selects all segments in this track only.
2. Click and drag your playhead to anywhere between five and ten sec-
onds into the project.
If you look at the Time Display in GarageBand and see a musical note in
the left corner, single-click it. Doing so switches the display out of Beats
and Measures mode and into Time mode.
3. Click and drag the beginning of your vocal track (your voice) to the
playhead.
You now have ten seconds of lead time between the beginning of the
timeline and your podcast.
4. In the Finder (or Explorer), open a window and find the music file you
want to use as your bed music. Click and drag the file into GarageBand,
just underneath your podcast track, as shown in Figure 5-5.

Setting a Gentle mood for his listeners
Dave Slusher of the Evil Genius Chronicles
(www.evilgeniuschronicles.org) show-
cases independent singers and songwriters
such as Michelle Malone, Arts & Sciences, and
The Gentle Readers, always asking permission
before featuring their works. His bed music, play-
ing from the beginning to the end of his podcasts,
comes from The Gentle Readers’ CD Hi Honey. To
show his appreciation for the permission, Dave
offers a special Evil Genius package that
includes a T-shirt promoting his show, bundled
with the Hi Honey CD. With this arrangement,
Dave and The Gentle Readers can both suc-
cessfully promote their works.

GarageBand allows you to import a variety of audio formats into its
tracks via the drag-and-drop method — but it won’t let you import or
incorporate MP3 files into a project. This is not necessarily a bad thing;
an MP3 file is a compressed file, similar to a JPEG file in digital photogra-
phy. Compressed files (film, photo, audio, whatever) are usually far from
ideal for editing. When using sound effects or bed music, use AIFF or
WAV files. Compressed audio files can be exported into AIFF or WAV files
easily via QuickTime Pro (available for both Windows and Mac).
5. Expand the new track of audio you just imported into the project by
single-clicking on the Expand Track (the upside-down triangle) tool
located in the collection of tools grouped with the music track.
You should see a thin blue line against a simple grid. This is your track
volume control. If your playhead is not at the ten-second mark, be sure to
put it there.
6. Click at the point where the playhead line and the volume control line
intersect.
You have now created a control point — a place you can click and drag to
change volume levels at various times. (See Figure 5-6.)

7. Move your playhead back two seconds to the eight-second mark. Also
at the eight-second mark, click the volume control to create another
control point.
8. Return to the first control point you created (in Step 6). Click, hold,
and drag the control point halfway between the bottom of the track-
volume partition and its current level.
You have just created a volume curve. Now the sound dips lower, 
allowing for a voiceover to be heard with music softly playing in the
background.
9. Move your playhead back to the ten-second mark, as shown in 
Figure 5-6.
Doing so completes your fade-down (the automatic fading of the music
to a subdued volume behind the voiceover).
10. Select the podcast track and click and drag your podcast segments to
where the content begins at the ten-second mark.
You now have a bed of music behind your podcast.
11. Bring the playhead back to the beginning and review your podcast.
Change the levels as needed to set the music at a level you think
works best.

Setting volume levels with Audacity
If you’re using Audacity, you can set volume levels by following these steps:
1. Activate the Selection tool and then click at the ten-second mark of
your timeline, placing an edit line there.
2. Click the Time Shift Tool button on the toolbar, shown in the margin.
The Time Shift tool takes an entire track of content and places it else-
where along the project’s timeline.
3. Single-click your audio and drag it to the edit line you created in 
Step 1.
4. Choose Project➪Import Audio and browse for the music file that you
want to use as bed music. Then select the file and click Open to begin
the import process.
Unlike GarageBand, Audacity does allow for importing or incorporating
MP3 files into a project. Just remember the earlier technical note that 
an MP3 file is a compressed file, similar to a JPEG file in digital photogra-
phy. When you’re editing — be it film, photo, or audio — you should 
not be working with compressed files (it’s just too easy to lose a bit too
much quality along the way). You can use them in Audacity, but do so 
at your own risk.
5. Click the Envelope Tool button on the toolbar.
The Envelope Tool allows you to dynamically control the audio levels
over a timeline. Clicking at the beginning of the audio track establishes
the first volume setting, and the second click (at the ten-second mark)
establishes the new volume level.
6. Select the track of recently imported music by single-clicking its name
on the left-hand side of the project window.
7. Click at the beginning of the music and then click at the point where
your podcast begins (the ten-second mark).
Two sets of points appear in your track of music.
8. Click and drag the second set of points to the 0.5dB mark.
You now have a fade-down of the music that maintains its subdued
volume behind the voiceover.
9. Activate the Selection tool, click at the beginning of the timeline, and
then click Play to review your podcast.
Now you can change the levels as needed to set the music at a level you
think works best.

Making an Entrance: Intros
Now that your podcast has a solid lead-in and a cue to fade out — or you
have a loop throughout your podcast that sets a tone — your podcast is
beginning to solidify. It’s establishing an identity for itself; be proud of the
way this podcast of yours is maturing.
But when the microphone comes on, do you always know what those first
words are going to be? For some listeners, you are about to make a first
impression. What do you want that first impression to be? Are you looking 
for something spontaneous every time, or do you want to create a familiar
greeting for you and your podcast that makes listeners feel like old friends?
It’s up to you, but think about how strong a first impression a cool intro can
make. Consider the ten simple words that became the signature introduc-
tions for George Lucas’ Star Wars saga:
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away . . .
This intro leaves an unforgettable first impression. But even if you’re not
vying to be the next George Lucas, the first impression is always important.
No matter who you are, this is a moment that can either establish you as a
personality (and a podcast) that people will enjoy and anxiously await from
episode to episode, or make winning over audiences a little harder. You want
the first impression to be fascinating, lasting . . . and positive.
Consistent, iconic intros can serve as a polished touch of preparation or a
subtle flair of professionalism. You are announcing to your audience that the
show is on the launchpad, you’re ready, and the journey is about to begin.
Theme music
How about a catchy theme? Just as television and motion picture themes
establish a thumbprint for themselves in pop culture, an opening theme — 
be it a favorite song (used with permission!) or an original composition — 
can be just the right intro for your podcast. Radio Daddy (radiodaddy.com)
provides quick and quirky theme songs (both opening and closing riffs) 
customized for your show. Earlier-mentioned software applications such 
as GarageBand, Cakewalk, Soundtrack, and Audition all offer royalty-free
loops that can be easily edited into your own podcast intro.
Intro greeting
Some podcasters use quick, snappy intro greetings for their podcasts. For
example, Adam Christianson opens every show with a heavy rock riff and the
122
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

salutation “Hey, Mac Geeks, it’s time for the MacCast, the show for Mac Geeks
by Mac Geeks . . .” that kicks off his podcast, The MacCast (www.maccast.
com). Others create an imaginative setting; for Michael and Evo’s Slice of Scifi
(sliceofscifi.com), the sultry voice of Deep Space Nine’s Chase Masterson
announces (in the style of a flight attendant), “Thank you for flying Trek United.
Please return your tray and seats into your upright positions. . . .” Whether
elaborately produced or just a simple welcome, a consistent greeting serves
to bring listeners into your corner of the podosphere.
The elements you’re looking for in a spoken introduction are
 The show’s name.
 The name(s) of the host(s).
 The location of the podcast.
 A tagline that identifies your show. (Here’s a good example from Slacker
Astronomy: “A podcast for astronomy and anything else that floats above
our heads.”)
Sit down and brainstorm a few ideas on how to introduce your particular
podcast. For example, try these approaches on for size:
 “Good morning, Planet Earth! You are listening to My Corner: A Slice of
Cyberspace, and I’m your host, Tee Morris . . .”
 “From Washington, D.C., welcome to My Corner: A Slice of Cyberspace.”
 “With a perspective on politics, technology, and life in general, it’s Tee
Morris with the My Corner podcast.”
As you see in these examples, you can mix and match the elements to drop
into an intro. Come up with what feels right for you and your podcast, and
stick with it. Once you’ve put together your greeting, you can either keep it
pre-recorded and use it as a drop-in (an isolated audio clip that you can use
repeatedly, either from podcast to podcast, or within a podcast) at the intro-
duction of your podcast, or you can script it and record it with each session.
Whatever method you choose, a greeting is another way of bringing your
audience into your 20 to 30 minutes (or five minutes to an hour and a half) 
of time on someone’s MP3 player.
Exit, Stage Left
Now that you have reached the end of your message or the time limit you 
have set for a podcast, what do you do now? Do you just say “Thanks, every-
one, see you next time . . .” or just a basic “’Bye,” and then it’s over? Or do you
want to go out with a bit of fanfare? Whatever you decide, an outro is much like
an intro — as simple or elaborate as you want to make it. Your outro is your
final word, closing statement, and grand finale. (At least for this podcast.)
123
Chapter 5: Cleanup, Podcast Aisle 7!

In practical terms, putting together an outro is no different from putting
together an intro — it’s the same approach, only you’re doing it at the end.
So review the earlier suggestions for intros and consider what seems a likely
direction for an outro.
Some podcasters figure there’s little more to think about for an outro than
what to say and how to present it. Sure, you could keep it simple — say “’Bye”
and switch off, no fuss, no script, just do it, done, and then upload. But other
podcasters see the outro as more like an art form. Before taking a shortcut 
to the end, check out the following sections for some ways to spiff up your
outro.
Leave the audience wanting more
Continuing your podcast to its final moments is a gutsy, confident, and excit-
ing outro, carrying your audience all the way to the final second. This is one
of the toughest ways to end a podcast, but if it’s done right, it can only make
your podcast better.
For example, all the Area 51 shows conclude with a quick-and-overly-peppy
commercial for the “Pink and Chewy Candy-Coated Bubble Gum Network”
(offering entertainment that sounds frighteningly close to what’s on the
major networks), the question “So, like, uh, how was that?” and the reply of
one guy applauding slowly, fading out to silence. With this exit, the crew at
Area 51 keeps the jokes flying right up to the last audible second. No plugs.
No endorsements. The show keeps going, and just when you think the show
is catching a second wind, it ends. The content continues right up to the end.
Catch phrase sign off
Your outro can be the final word from the host, and it should be your bow
during the curtain call. A signature farewell is a classy way of saying “This
podcast is a wrap. Thanks for listening.”
For example, throughout the years that journalist Walter Cronkite reported
the news to America, he always ended with the words, “And that’s the way it
is . . .” followed by the date. Evo has taken a similar approach with his intro
for The Dragon Page’s Cover to Cover: “Our work is done here.” On Slacker
Astronomy, one of the hosts signs off with, “For you, for fun, for the voices in
our heads.”
If you can’t think of anything overly clever, a consistent exit such as “This has
been my podcast. Thanks for listening . . .” works too.
124
Part II: The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Podcasting 

Credits roll
Another possibility for your outro could be a scripted list of credits: Web
sites where past shows can be downloaded, resources can be endorsed, 
and special thanks can be given to various supporters of your podcast.
When listing credits, take care that your list of thank-yous and acknowledg-
ments doesn’t ramble on for too long after every podcast. Some podcasters
reserve a full list of end credits for special podcasts, such as an “end-of-the-
season” or even “final” episode. By and large, a minute can serve as a good
length for ending credits — plenty of time to mention relevant Web sites, 
tuck in the obligatory “Tune in next week . . .” statement, and ask for a vote 
of support on your favorite podcast directory.
Coming soon to an MP3 player near you
Just as television shows drops teasers of what will be coming up next week,
podcasters can also give quick hints as to what is planned for future podcasts.
Mark Jeffrey’s The Pocket and The Pendant (pocketandpendant.com) and
Scott Sigler’s EarthCore (scottsigler.net) had already been pre-recorded
for the intent of podcasting. This gave both authors a terrific advantage to edit
together montages of audio clips and even record a quick synopsis of what
was to come in the next episode.
Previews for future podcasts tend to be difficult to plan — mainly because of
the spontaneous nature of podcasting that the medium prides itself on. Many
podcasters have no idea what will be on the agenda for their next show until
the day or even a few hours before recording, and other podcasters prefer to
start up the audio equipment and speak with no prep time for their latest
installment. For those podcasts that can provide glimpses of things to come,
this kind of outro serves as a commitment to their audience that there will be
more content coming through the RSS feed, and that programming is being
planned for future installments.
As mentioned with intros, your outro can use one of these approaches or
combine them. Find what best fits your podcast and stick with it. The more
consistent your podcast is, the more professional it will sound — spontaneous
but focused, right?

 Downsizing audio files with MP3 compression (getting 25 pounds of sugar into a

 Dissecting ID3 tags: They’re not just for music anymore
You’ve finished your final edit (and for those who think we’re skirting blas-
phemy whenever we use the “E” word, trust us — creativity sometimes
demands a sacrifice). At last you’re ready to compress your mondo-super-
sized AIFF or WAV file down to the format that inspires terror and indigestion
to RIAA representatives everywhere: MP3.
The MP3 format was designed to reduce the amount of data (via 10:1 com-
pression) required for digitized audio, while still retaining the quality of the
original recording. This type of audio is used for quick-and-easy file sharing
much to the chagrin of the music industry, and it is this “outlaw format” that
podcasting utilizes to get content efficiently from podcaster to podcatching
client. The MP3 format is the best way to keep the file small enough in size to
make it a quick and easy download. Although creating MP3s is a very quick
and easy process, you do need to make some tradeoffs between quality and
compression.
A Kilobit of Me, and a Whole Lot 
of You: Understanding Kbps
The compression process begins with proper Kbps (kilobits per second) set-
tings. Kbps is a method of measuring data transmission from one point to the
next. The higher the Kbps value, the more data being transferred between
two points. The more data being transferred per second, the better the qual-
ity of information. With each rate of data transfer (or, because you’re dealing

with sound, the audio bit rate) offered by recording applications, you can digi-
tally reproduce the various qualities of audio:
 8 Kbps (matching the vocal quality of a telephone conversation)
 32 Kbps (yielding audio quality similar to AM radio)
 96 Kbps (yielding audio quality similar to FM radio)
 128 Kbps (matching audio CD quality, and the most common Kbps used
for MP3 compression of music)
 1411 Kbps (maximum quality for CD audio, with stereo playback, 16-bit
audio quality, and modulation at 44.1 kHz)
You are not married to this listing of Kbps by any stretch of imagination.
Figure 6-1 shows what Audacity offers in its Preferences — plenty of variations
from five common settings. Tweak till you find the Kbps best suited for your
podcast.
It’s a tradeoff: The higher the bit rate, the larger your file size is — but the
smaller your bit rate, the lower your audio quality is. A good idea is to experi-
ment: Compress your podcast using one bit rate, save it that way, and then
change your bit rate to something higher (or lower), do the same, and play
back each clip to compare how they load and how they sound. Note any
changes in sound quality and file size. When you find that happy medium
between quality and compression, stick with that number for your current
and future podcasts.

Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

In this section, we’re changing bit rates using Audacity and iTunes. If you’re
using applications like Audition or Soundtrack, you can check your documen-
tation or online help to find out where you make these changes.
Changing bit rates in Audacity
Changing bit rates in Audacity is an easy and painless process. The only
hassle is that you have to know where to look in your Preferences and
where to look under which option. To deal with it, follow these steps:
1. Choose Audacity➪Preferences (Mac) or choose File➪Preferences
(Windows).
The Preferences window opens.
2. Choose the File Formats tab.
3. Select your desired bit rate from the Bit Rate drop-down list in the
MP3 Export Setup area (refer to Figure 6-1).
If the Bit Rate drop-down list is grayed out and you can’t make a selection, you
need to install the LAME Library first, as described next.
Here’s a funny thing about Audacity. It’s a great tool for creating MP3 files —
especially considering its price! — but Audacity can’t make MP3 files all by
itself. It recruits a little help from an exporting library file, a separate down-
load from Audacity itself. The LAME Library is not a huge download, but it’s a
bit of a hassle if you have been recording or are nearing the end, and now you
have to make another download. 
The good news about this extra step is that once you locate the LAME Library,
you don’t have to repeat this process again unless you move the library to
another location.
Here are the steps you need to follow to download and install LAME:
1. Download the LAME Library from audacity.sourceforge.net.
2. After you’ve downloaded the LAME Library, look for the LameLib file
(Mac) or lame_enc.dll file (Windows) and save it in your Audacity
program folder.
3. Repeat Steps 1 through 2 in the preceding step list.
4. Click the Find Library button.
The Export MP3 message window appears, as shown in Figure 6-2.
5. Click Yes in the message window.
If you click No, you return to Audacity’s main interface without installing
LAME.
131
Chapter 6: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It

6. Locate the LameLib file (Mac) or lame_enc.dll file (Windows) on
your hard drive.
If you saved the file in your Audacity program folder, choose Applications➪
Audacity folder (depending on what version you download) in the Finder
window (Mac) or My Computer➪(Main Drive)➪Programs➪Audacity
(Windows).
7. Select the file and click Open.
Changing bit rates in iTunes
If you’re having way too much fun editing your podcast in GarageBand, you
will notice that you have no options for exporting to MP3. In fact, you can’t
even import an MP3 into GarageBand for editing. That’s because GarageBand
prefers to work with full-sized AIFF or WAV files.
Notice, though, that GarageBand encourages a direct export to iTunes.
Apple’s plan is that you work your magic in GarageBand, and then perform
any final touches (such as compression and tagging) in iTunes. It’s a seam-
less relationship, and these two applications really play well together.
The release of podcast-friendly iTunes made compression and bit-rate changes
easy (though it required one more step than Audacity). Follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or choose Edit➪Preferences
(Windows).
The Preferences window opens.
2. In the Preferences window, choose Advanced➪Importing.
3. Choose Custom from the Settings drop-down menu.
The MP3 Encoder dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-3.

Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

4. Select your desired bit rate from the Stereo Bit Rate drop-down menu.
You can also choose to make your channels mono or stereo, and what
your sampling rate is. (See the upcoming section for more about sam-
pling rates.)
5. Click OK.
You return to the Importing tab. The default settings for your MP3 com-
pressions are now in the Details area.
Care for a Sample, Sir? 
(Audio Sample Rates)
After you have a grasp of bit rates, you’re ready to move on to sample rates.
This may strike you as a tad redundant, particularly when you see the list of
common audio-sample rates. A strange déjà vu makes you wonder whether
you’re in the real world or exist merely as part of the Matrix. No biggie —
sometimes technology is redundant.
As we discuss in the previous section, the bit rate is a measurement of how
much audio data is transferred between two points, such as the computer and
your headset. The sampling rate is a measurement of audio samples taken from 
a continuous signal (a signal of varying quantity, defined over a period of time)
in order to create a discrete signal (a signal made up of samples from a contin-
uous signal).
Figure 6-3:
The iTunes
options for
sampling
rates.
133
Chapter 6: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It

Think of a sampling rate like this. When you talk with a friend about how
good The Fantastic Four was and how cool it was to hear actor Michael Chiklis
say “It’s Clobberin’ Time!” — that is your continuous signal. Your words are
coming out effortlessly, and do so until you take a break either for a breath 
or to give your friend time to compare Fantastic Four to X-Men.
Your friend then says, “You should podcast your opinions of movies.” So you
buy Podcasting For Dummies by Tee Morris and Evo Terra (a good book, we
hear!), put together your studio, and then start recording thoughts on your
favorite movies. The microphone sends your voice as a signal to the computer’s
audio software and samples that particular segment until you hit the Stop
button. Whenever you hit Record, your computer samples your voice each
time it receives the signal — and then compiles all the separate samples to
create a continuous track of speech. The higher the sampling rate, the truer-
to-life the digital reproduction of your voice sounds.
The most common audio sampling rates found in MP3 encoders are
 8,000 Hz / 8 kHz (telephone-quality recording or lo-fi)
 22,050 Hz / 22 kHz (equal to AM radio transmission)
 32,000 Hz / 32 kHz (equal to FM radio transmission, minimum sound
quality on miniDV digital video camcorder)
 44,100 Hz / 44 kHz (audio-CD quality)
 48,000 Hz / 48 kHz (digital TV, DVD, films, maximum sound quality on
miniDV digital video camcorder, and professional-grade audio recording)
As with your audio recording applications, you have a range of bit rates 
available — and you can type in your own custom sampling rates.
Lower sampling rates mean smaller amounts of memory to store for your
MP3 files — but your overall quality takes a loss. As with bit rates, experi-
ment with several and find out which rate works best for you.
Changing sample rates in Audacity
Sample rates are located in the Preferences window and are extremely simple
to either change or customize to your podcast’s personal needs. Follow these
steps to customize sample rates in Audacity:
1. Choose Audacity➪Preferences (Mac). Choose File➪Preferences
(Windows).
The Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Quality tab.
134
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

3. Select your desired bit rate from the Default Sample Rate drop-down
menu (as shown in Figure 6-4), or enter your own custom sampling
rate by selecting the Other option and entering a number.
If you’re entering a custom sampling rate, make sure you enter the rate
in hertz (Hz) and not kilohertz (kHz). For example, if you decide your
sampling rate is 22.05 kHz, you have to enter 22050, not 22.
4. Click OK.
Changing sample rates in iTunes
iTunes makes the process of changing the sample rate easy — what else
would you expect from Apple? Follow these steps to change the sample
rate in iTunes:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac). Choose Edit➪Preferences
(Windows).
The Preferences window appears.
2. Choose Advanced➪Importing.
3. Select the Custom option from the Settings drop-down menu.
The iTunes MP3 Encoder dialog box opens (refer to Figure 6-3).
4. Select your desired sampling rate from the Sample Rate menu.

Chapter 6: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It

Apple loves to make things easy for its users, and we love that. However,
Apple sometimes takes out the “I did it MY WAY!” alternative and does
not allow for custom settings. Here, iTunes keeps this sampling to the
common settings, so you are given no leeway.
Note that Apple iTunes offers up your sampling rates at kilohertz (kHz),
a more common, recognizable presentation of a sampling rate. Again,
this is Apple looking out for you, keeping it to the basics.
5. Click OK.
You return to the Importing tab. The default settings for your MP3 com-
pressions are now visible in the Details area.
You can take a look at the podcasts your aggregator is pulling down and check
the settings. Check the MP3 Summaries in iTunes by pressing Ú+I (Mac) or
Ctrl+I (Windows). Settings may vary from file to file. As you work out the final
technical details of your podcast, make sure that one of them is the setting
that best suits your needs and (of course) your ear.
136
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
Setting the standard for a new kind 
of book, a new kind of podcast
When Podiobooks.com was launched, we knew
setting an audio standard for current and future
podcasters would be important. But what setting
could podcasters easily follow, and that listeners
would find comfortable? In the end, we looked to
The Dragon Page and its podcast (that is also
syndicated on XM Satellite Radio and AM/FM
radio stations) as a benchmark. Now, Podio-
books.com asks for the following parameters:
 64 Kbps
 22.050 kHz / 22,050 Hz
 Stereo
We haven’t yet discussed mono or stereo output
in this chapter, for one reason: It all depends on
the method you use for recording — and on
how you are listening:
 Mono: Mono is appropriate if you don’t have
stereo speakers or if your audio files were
recorded with one audio channel (that is,
one audio track). When it comes to file size,
mono files take up half the memory of stereo
files, therefore the download will be faster.
 Stereo: If you’re listening to your podcasts
with a portable MP3 player or stereo speak-
ers connected to a computer, then export to
Stereo. For iTunes users, an option is
offered in the MP3 Encoder’s Stereo Mode
called Joint Stereo. With this option, one
channel carries identical audio data pre-
sent on both channels, and the other chan-
nel carries unique audio data. At bit rates
below 128 Kbps, this approach may improve
the sound quality of converted audio.
When setting standards for Podiobooks.com,
The Dragon Page folks turned to its own, as this
new service is a spin-off of its initial podcasts,
Cover to Cover and Wingin’ It. Therefore, it
stands to reason that consistency between
shows and special presentations is paramount.
This is something to consider when setting
standards for yourself.

ID3 Tags: They’re Not Just 
for Music Anymore
Is it soup yet? Not quite yet. Adding ID3 tags is the final step before you can
upload the podcast to your Web site. This is the final detail (okay, batch of
details) that not only tells other podcasters who you are, but also tells listen-
ers what your podcast is all about, and which episode they’re listening to.
Because this is a final detail, we find that some podcasters either skip it or just
don’t care how they tag their podcasts. And there goes any hope for effectively
organizing their particular podcasts in your computer’s MP3 player. Maybe
some podcasters are unaware of where or how to identify their podcasts — 
or want to get their content out to the fans ASAP without taking the time to
implement these tags.
Whatever the case, we entreat you: Stop the madness, stop the insanity, 
and stop the monkeys. Proclaim your true self for the sake of MP3 players
everywhere — and implement your ID3 tags!
Tell me about yourself: All about ID3 tags
First created in 1996, ID3 tags were designed to be added to audio files in
order to have the artist, album, and track title displayed in a computer’s MP3
player when the file is played back. ID3 tags, in the early days, liked to crash
MP3 players. The MP3 tags are more stable than their earlier versions, and
now include composer, bit rate, and even genre.
Of course, another question that comes to mind is why would a podcaster
want to even bother with ID3 tags?
Take a look at a podcast you’re listening to, regardless of whether it’s on 
your portable MP3 player or the player on your desktop. Your podcatching
client probably organizes your various feeds by the date downloaded, either
with the most recent show at the bottom or at the top of your playlist,
depending on the player’s preferences. Each individual podcast has a title,
artist, and podcast title. If your MP3 player is particularly sophisticated, it
also displays artwork associated with your show.
Now hop from podcast to podcast in your MP3 player, and you can tell which
people care — or don’t — about identifying their shows. Some podcasts simply
use obscure numbers that could be a date, but when you hear two episodes of
the podcast back-to-back, you find out the number and the date read at the
intro of the show (provided there is one) don’t match up (confusing). With ID3
tags in place, you can now look at your portable MP3 player or your desktop
player to get an idea of what you are listening to.
137
Chapter 6: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It

ID3 tags can include the following:
 Name
 Artist
 Album
 Track Number
 Year
 BPM
 Composer
 Genre
 Comments
With these ID3 tags, you can now set apart individual podcasts from one
another, making each one unique but keeping it grouped with your podcast
show.
IDentity crisis: Making ID3 
tags work for podcasting
By now you have noticed that some of these ID3 tags really don’t work for
podcasting. Album? Track number? Composer? You’re podcasting, not pro-
ducing music. Your responsibility (as a podcaster) is to redefine the following
tags we have found useful for the podcasting medium:
 Name: This should be the name or number of your podcasting episode.
Examples are Area 51: Show #15 - Heir Check and Cover-to-Cover:
Show #160, Chapters 32-34 - Phalanx.
 Artist: This one is pretty self-explanatory. You’re the artist behind this
podcast, so let people know who you and your group are. Put in your
name (or at least the pseudonym you’re using as a podcaster) or the
name of your podcasting team. For example, Area 51, Michael & Evo,
Scott Sigler.
 Album: This tag may trip you up. It can be either the name of your
show or your show’s Web site. Good examples are Area51show.com,
The Dragon Page, EarthCore.
 Track Number: Purely optional, this ID3 tag allows you to make sure
your podcasts remain in some kind of sequential order. For Scott Sigler’s
EarthCore and the MOREVI podcast, the track numbers coincide with the
chapter numbers.
138
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

 Year: The year of your podcast.
 Composer: This one can be tricky if offered by your MP3 creator. You
can enter in your engineer’s name, or the originators of the material. For
example, MOREVI’s artist is listed as Tee Morris, but the composers are
Tee Morris & Lisa Lee because the original work was co-written.
 Genre: Recently, the Podcast genre was not offered in drop-down menus
of MP3 creators, but with the growing popularity of the medium, it is
becoming more and more of a common genre, now recognized by iTunes.
You can always list your podcast as Spoken Word or Comedy but don’t be
surprised if Podcast is not an offered option.
 Comments: Similar to comments you leave in XML, you can give a quick
two or three lines of show notes for your podcasts. It’s also a great place
to put in any copyright notices and special mentions.
Reminiscent of John Cleese’s aside in a Monty Python robbery sketch (“Adapt,
and improve. That’s the motto of the Round Table”), we podcasters must adapt
these ID3 tags to our podcasts to improve how they appear in our players.
On playback, the ID3 tags appear on the listeners’ interfaces, offering a quick
glance at the content of the podcast (as shown in Figure 6-5).

Creating and editing ID3 tags in Audacity
When you’re ready to create an ID3 tag, open Audacity and follow these
steps:
1. Choose Project➪Edit ID3 Tags.
The Edit ID3 Tags (for MP3 Exporting) window opens (shown in 
Figure 6-6). The ID3v2 option, by default, is already selected.
2. Fill in these fields:
• Title: The episode name or number
• Artist: The podcaster or name of the podcasting crew
• Album: The show’s name or Web site
• Track Number: The field is optional, unless numerical order is a
priority in your podcast
• Year: The podcast publication’s year
3. From the menu of numerous genres, select the option best suited to
your podcast.
Audacity doesn’t offer a Podcast option, but you can always select
Speech to indicate this is a non-musical podcast.
4. Give a quick, brief description of your podcast in the Comments field.
Do not make your “Comments” a long, detailed description of your pod-
cast’s content. Keep it simple and brief. For example, if The Dragon Page
were to write in comments for Show #174, it would not say “On this
show we interview Brandon Sanderson about his debut novel Elantris
Figure 6-6:
The Edit ID3
Tags (for

window in
Audacity.
140
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

and then turn our attention to Steve Alten’s latest novel, The Loch,” but
boil down this description to “Show 174 — Interviews with Brandon
Sanderson and Steve Alten.”
5. Click OK.
And that’s it — you’re done! The Audacity-generated MP3 is now tagged and
ready for uploading.
Creating and editing ID3 tags in iTunes
You can add a few more ID3 tags into iTunes than you can with Audacity, and
iTunes also gives you a bit more flexibility in customizing genres and even
incorporating artwork.
iTunes also makes adding and editing ID3 tags extremely easy. Follow these
steps:
1. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ú+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows).
The Info window appears, which gives you a summary of your MP3 file.
2. Fill in the following fields (shown in Figure 6-7):
• Name: The episode name or number.
• Artist: The name of the podcaster or podcasting crew.
• Year: The podcast publication’s year.
• Album: The show’s name or Web site.
• Track Number: This is optional, unless numerical order is a prior-
ity in your podcast.
• Composer: Fill in this field if you have a separate sound engineer, a
tech guru handling the editing, or if you’re doing the work yourself.
• Comments: A quick, brief version of show notes.
• Genre: Select one of the offered genres from the drop-down menu,
or you can select the genre in the field and type Podcast (or what-
ever genre you want to use to classify your work).
One of the cool bonuses of iTunes is how you can create custom
genres. Choose File➪Get Info➪Info and enter your own genre
there. Or go to the MP3 in your iTunes Library and single-click 
in the Genre column and edit the genre name. When you return 
to the Info window later, you can see your custom genre offered 
as an option on the Genre drop-down menu.
3. Take a last look at your ID3 tags to make sure everything is spelled
properly and listed the way you want it, and then click the Artwork tab.
141
Chapter 6: Shrink That Puppy and Slap a Label on It

4. Drag and drop a desired piece of artwork into the Artwork field. Or
click the Add button and find the artwork you want to have associ-
ated with your podcast.
If your logo is in a format that iTunes recognizes, it appears in the
Artwork field.
5. Click OK.
Figure 6-7:
So many
options are
available in

142
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
Art for art’s sake
Album artwork, commonly seen in many desk-
top MP3 players and now in iPods that display
photos, is a nice option for podcasters who
want to brand a podcast with a logo. Mur
Lafferty’s GeekFu Action Grip logo is an edgy,
anime-style caricature of our host. Then you
have Slice of Scifi’s Andorian within reach of a
classic radio microphone. These are icons
associated with their shows, and this kind of
branding is becoming more and more common
in podcasting, especially with the iTunes Music
Store becoming podcast friendly.
But what is the best way to make sure iTunes
(and for that matter, the iTunes Music Store’s
Podcast Catalog) will recognize your artwork?
Just make sure that your logo fits the following
parameters:
 300 x 300 pixels, both in width and height
 8-bit channel, RGB mode
 JPEG (.jpg) format
Keep in mind that when you compress your art-
work, overcompression can distort and deterio-
rate its visual quality. Some JPEG settings work
in numbers 1–10 or 0–100. As a rule, if you com-
press your logos no more than 5/50, your art-
work should retain visual quality.

Chapter 7
Move It on Up (To Your 
Web Server)
In This Chapter
 Moving podcast media files to your Web server
 Naming your files appropriately
 Keeping your FTP space neat and tidy
 Exploring advanced hosting options
You’ve managed to figure out what it is you wanted to say (or play), went
through the trials and tribulations of the editing process (or not), and
faithfully employed correct ID3 tagging (nonnegotiable). That’s great, but no
one is going to hear your contribution to the podcasting world until you put
your files up on the World Wide Web.
In Chapter 1, we cover the hosting provider selection process. In this chapter,
we take an extensive look at the mechanics of the process, including how to
appropriately name and organize your files. And if you expect a high number
of listeners, we walk you through some advanced hosting options that can
help keep your hosting fees at a manageable level.
Podcasters have a variety of options when it comes to moving files. Specialized
software is employed by many, and some podcast-specific hosting companies
make moving your files to the Web as simple as point and click. And for the
“old school” folks out there, text-based applications baked right in to the oper-
ating system might be the preferred method.
While they each do things differently, all of them help you accomplish the
same job — moving files from your personal computer to their new home
on the World Wide Web.

Uploading Your Files with FTP
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the method by which you can transfer files from
one destination to another over the Internet. You likely transfer files every day,
from your desktop to your documents folder, from an e-mail to your desktop,
or even MP3 files from your podcatching client to your MP3 player.
Transferring files to and from the Internet isn’t much different, at least on the
surface and even at any depth necessary for podcasters to ply their trade.
Lucky for us, specialty software exists to make this process even more simple.
In reality, FTPing files around has become as simple as drag and drop.
Some podcast hosting services, such as Liberated Syndication (libsyn.com),
make this simple process even simpler by providing a Web form to handle the
uploading of podcast files, as described later in the chapter in the “Uploading
to a Podcast-Specific Host” section. Browser-based systems certainly remove
the complexity for many, but it doesn’t hurt to understand the processes out-
lined in this chapter. Many experienced podcasters need more flexibility than
the limited functionality a browser-based FTP process allows.
Understanding the parts 
that make FTP work
Regardless of what software, forms, or other assistance you use to move files
around, the concept of FTP is the same. In this section, we identify each part
of the FTP process and show how they work together to get files from your
computer to your Web server.
FTP has been around for quite a while now. As such, archaic and seemingly
nonintuitive names abound from the start — such as the two computer sys-
tems involved: 
 Local host: The local host is the computer you are sitting in front of and
are initiating the file transfer from. If you’re using a laptop to connect to
your Web server, your laptop is the local host. If you’re at work, and are
logging in from a workstation, your office computer is the local host.
The local directory or local path is the folder on your local host that con-
tains the files you want to transfer. You can change local directories at
will, but most FTP programs have a default starting place. Feel free to
move around after that.
 Remote host: The remote host is the computer or Web server to which
you’ve connected. It’s likely the spot where you’re trying to get your
MP3 files to go so you can start podcasting.
144
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Not surprisingly, the remote host has its own remote directory (the folder
on the remote system where you drop your files). Again, you can change
or navigate through remote directories just as you can change the file
folders on your computer.
Making your connection
You need three pieces of information to initiate an FTP connection:
 The IP address or hostname of your Web server
 Login name
 Password
Your hosting company should have provided this information to you. If you
don’t have it handy, find it. You’re not going any farther without it.
All FTP programs do the same job in the same way, but have slightly different
methods of going about it. After you grasp the concept, using just about any
FTP client is a simple process. Here are the general steps you follow to set up
a connection in any FTP client:
1. Launch your FTP client and create a new connection.
Because this step is what FTP clients are designed to do, they usually
make this process very simple.
2. Enter the hostname of your Web server, username (login), and 
password.
This step identifies the remote system and shows you have access to
the files and folders it contains.
3. Connect.
Depending on the speed of your connection, the connection is estab-
lished in a matter of seconds.
For purposes of illustration, the following sections show you how to use
Cyberduck (cyberduck.ch/), a free and handy FTP program for the
Macintosh system, and SmartFTP (www.smartftp.com), a similar program
for the PC. You can find many FTP programs as freeware, shareware, and
shrink-wrapped software, for every brand of modern day operating system.
We picked these two for their ease-of-use and streamlined approach to get-
ting the job done, but you are encouraged to use the FTP program of your
choice.
145
Chapter 7: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)

Step by step with Cyberduck
Mac users can follow these steps to set up an FTP connection in Cyberduck:
1. Click New Connection in the upper-left-hand corner.
The Connect dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-1.
2. In the Server text box, enter the name of your server.
Depending on the requirements of your ISP, this name can be in the
format of ftp.mydomainname.com or perhaps simply my_domain_name.
com. And of course, you need to be sure and use the name of your Web
server. Chances are you don’t really own the domain my_domain_name.
com, right?
3. Leave the Path text box blank.
Every Web server is configured differently, and most ISPs have things
configured to put you in the appropriate place. Later, you may wish to
add something to this line so you don’t have to move around file folders
each time you connect.
4. Enter your username and password.
The hosting company should have provided this information. If your host-
ing company is the same company that is supplying your connection to
the Internet, it might be the same information you use to check your mail.
But if you toss some additional money each week at a hosting provider,
it’s likely something completely different.
Select the Add to Keychain option to store your username and password
for the next time you connect.
5. Click the Connect button in the lower-right corner.
If you entered things properly, you now see the file folders on your
remote Web server. If you didn’t, you get an error message or a login
failed dialog box. Correct what’s wrong, and try it again.
And when your connection is established, choose Bookmarks➪New Bookmark.
Give your newly created connection a catchy name, and simply double-click
the given name the next time you need to connect.
Step by step with SmartFTP
SmartFTP suffers a bit from toolbar overkill, but it certainly cuts down on the
number of steps for setting up an FTP connection:
1. On the Login toolbar (shown in Figure 7-2), enter your server name,
login name, and password.
Leave the port at 21 and leave the Anonymous check box deselected.
146
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

2. Press the Enter key.
A new window appears, and if you did things right, you’re now connected
to your Web server. If you entered something wrong, you get an error
message at the bottom of the new window. Correct your mistakes, and
try it again.
From here, you can now navigate through the folders on your Web server
much as you do on your computer’s hard drive. You can move up or down
the file system, finding the spot where you want to drop your podcast files.

Chapter 7: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)

A place on your Web server for your stuff
Logging in to your Web server for the first time can be an intimidating process.
In this section, we show you how to place your files in a location so you can
easily create links to your podcast files.
Don’t be intimidated by the odd directory names on your Web server. The
only one you really need to know is Public_html. Other hosts may call it
www or simply html. If you don’t have one of those three, poke around until
you find one that has a bunch of files in it that end in .html.
Look, but don’t touch. Going into folders doesn’t hurt anything, but doing
silly things such as deleting, renaming, and moving files you know nothing
about is a bad idea. All those strangely named folders do something, and
they’re likely necessary to make your Web site work right. Remember the
proverb “’Tis best to leave functioning Web servers lie . . .”
After you find your home (or root) directory, take a look around. You may see
lots of different files and a few folders. We show you how to add even more
files to this system, so now is a good time to think about organizing and
housekeeping.
Start by creating a special place to keep your podcast files. Making a new
folder exclusively for your podcast media files not only separates your pod-
casts from your other critical Web server files, but also allows you to quickly
see what is currently live and what needs to be cleaned up.
Unless you have unmetered bandwidth and unlimited server space (see the
sidebar for more details), you only want to keep a few of your more recent
podcast media files online. Evo only keeps the last four episodes of one of his
show online. It gets expensive to keep more than that available. Of course,
148
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 
Unmetered and unlimited explained
Okay, I guess we can’t throw out technical
terms without saying something about them:
 Unmetered bandwidth refers to the policies
of certain hosting companies, like Liberated
Syndication and Podlot (podlot.com), that
do not base their monthly charges on the
amount of files transferred (podcasts down-
loaded) each month.
 Unlimited server space is an even more elu-
sive option, and theoretically means you can
host one or 1,000 different podcast media
files on the Web server and be charged the
same flat fee. We don’t know of any hosting
company offering unlimited server space
currently, so you can stop salivating now.

your audience may love you so much they want to go back and listen to
every episode. As a podcaster, you have to balance what is good for your
fans and what is good for your pocketbook.
In your root directory, create a new folder called media. With Cyberduck, you
need to simply choose File➪New Folder, followed by entering the name in the
resulting dialog box. On SmartFTP, choose Commands➪New➪Folder and
enter the name.
After you create the new media folder, click (double-click for Cyberduck) the
name of the folder to open it. You’re now inside your totally empty media
folder, and ready to load it with your podcast media files.
Adopting an effective 
filenaming convention
In Chapter 6, we talk about the importance of “the little things,” such as ID3
tags. Equally important is how you decide to name your podcast media files.
In this section, we illustrate the importance, not only to you as a podcaster,
but also to your listening audience. While no hard and fast rules exist for
naming files, following some common conventions allows everyone to easily
find your podcasts.
A good naming convention of a podcast accomplishes the following:
 Easy sequential ordering: Files should not appear at random in your
directory. They should line up — first, second, third, and so on.
 “At a glance” recognition for your listeners: Calling a podcast media
file my media file doesn’t help very much. Calling it Bob’s Fencing
Podcast certainly does.
Here’s an example of a well-named podcast media file, if we do say so 
ourselves:
DPWI_012_052505.mp3
While the structure may not be obvious, this filename adheres to both rules
and even adds one more:
 DPWI: This abbreviation stands for (The) Dragon Page Wingin’ It!, one of
the many podcasts Evo produces each week. Starting off the filename
with these four letters organizes the files together in the media folder.
For listeners who can only see the filename on their MP3 player, they
can quickly recognize that files starting with these four letters belong to
his show.
149
Chapter 7: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)

 012: This is Episode 12 of his show. Referring to each show with a
sequential number is a good idea, giving you and your fans a common
reference point that is easier than “remember when you did that one
show with that one guy who said that funny thing? Man that was great!”
Having the episode number right after the name also ensures that the
files “stack up” right in the media folder, as well as in your listener’s
MP3 players.
 052505: The date Evo posted the live file. He uses 05 instead of 5 so that
dates from October (10), November (11) and December (12) don’t inter-
mingle with January (if he used 1 instead of 01).
Between each element, he adds an underscore (_) simply to provide a clear
distinction of each part for his eye, or anyone else’s eye who might look at
the filename.
Do not use any spaces or special characters in the naming of your files. Stick
with A-Z, 0-9, dashes, and underscores. Slashes (/, \), octothorps (#), amper-
sands (&), and others can and likely do cause problems when creating RSS 2.0
files or when clients are handling the files. If you want to space things out, use
underscores (for example, use My_Podcast.mp3 instead of My Podcast.mp3).
The following examples are from well-respected podcasters who all follow the
guidelines we set forth earlier:
 BP2005_05_27.mp3
 Area51show-2005-05-26.mp3
 cnMay27.mp3
 DSC-2005-05-26.mp3
Note how they identify the name of the podcast and provide a sequential way
of ordering the files. The year of the podcast ahead of month and day also
ensures that 2005 files are always grouped together. If they had used the
month first, as we traditionally think of dates in the United States, files would
be mixed based on the month they were released, regardless of the year.
If thinking that way seems a little too strange for you, do what Evo does. Stick
a sequential number in front of your date, and don’t worry about it.
Some podcasters (including Evo) have experienced intermit resetting of ID3
tags when renaming MP3 files. Be sure and re-check your ID3 tags if you
rename your file. After you establish a naming convention, this problem
rarely happens.
150
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Uploading your files
After you set up a folder for your podcast media files and decide on a file-
naming convention, you’re ready to move your freshly named files to the 
Web server.
Both Cyberduck and SmartFTP support drag-and-drop file transfers. If you’re
new to FTP, the FTP program interface may be easier for you to use.
For Cyberduck, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Upload.
2. Browse your system to find the podcast media file you want to upload.
3. Click the Upload button.
For SmartFTP, follow these steps:
1. Choose Commands➪Upload➪Direct➪Select Files.
2. Browse your system to find the podcast media file you want to upload.
3. Click the Open button.
Depending on the size of your file and the speed of your Internet connection,
the file may transfer in a matter of seconds or a matter of minutes. When
completed, the file appears in your FTP client and is ready to be linked in
your show notes and RSS 2.0 feed, as we discuss in Chapters 8 and 9.
Uploading to a Podcast-Specific Host
Podcast-specific hosting companies significantly simplify the uploading
process; many include Web-based forms that take the place of additional
computer programs to handle the uploading process. They also take care 
of archiving, RSS 2.0 creation, and even ID3 tagging.
While this Web-based uploading process is simple, we prefer the flexibility of
using an FTP client. Or maybe we’re old school . . .
For the purposes of illustration, we use an account with Liberated Syndication
(libsyn.com) for the examples. If you haven’t already, you need to sign up
with Libsyn and create your own account. Then follow these steps:
1. Log in to your account.
Enter your username and password and press the Login button.
2. Click the Settings tab to access your blog and podcast settings.
151
Chapter 7: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)

3. Enter the information for your blog and/or podcast. When you finish,
click the Save Changes button.
The blog settings are very simple — things like the name of your blog,
the e-mail address of the author, and what category you want it placed
in. Nothing here is mission critical, so fill it out however you want to see
it listed. You can always come back and change it later.
4. Click the Media Files tab.
If you’ve never uploaded any media files, no media files are listed.
5. Click the Upload Media button on the left navigation bar.
You’re taken to the upload page, as shown in Figure 7-3.
6. Click the Browse button, which is to the right of the HTTP Upload box.
The File Upload dialog box opens.
Note: HTTP upload is another name for form-based transfers.
7. Find the podcast media file you want to upload and either double-
click the file or click Open.
8. Click the Load File button.
Depending on the size of your file and the speed of your Internet connec-
tion, the page may refresh in a matter of seconds or a few minutes. After
completion, the screen refreshes, and your podcast media file displays.
Note also that the text box under Advanced Users contains a string of
RSS 2.0 code. Remember this spot, as we revisit it in Chapters 8 and 9.
Figure 7-3:

152
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

For those of you who like to try it before you buy it, Libsyn lets you log in 
to a demo account, move files around, and generally get a feel for how it
works before you sign up. Not that the very inexpensive monthly fees will
break most of you or anything. But it’s nice to know how your future home
might work.
Using Your Blogging Software to Upload
Many popular blogging tools, such as Movable Type and Word Press, allow
bloggers (and podcasters) to upload files without the need for special FTP
software, much like the HTTP process outlined in the previous section.
However, podcast media files often exceed the file size requirements for
these services. For this reason, we recommend not using your conventional
blogging software to handle your podcast media file uploads.
Consider that blogs are primarily used to communicate texts. While you can
easily extend the functionality of a blog to support and indeed power a pod-
cast, the site management tools are designed for text and images.
Movable Type, for example, has a file size limitation of 5MB. Unless you’re
posting two- or three-minute podcasts, you’ll likely exceed this limitation
on every file.
WordPress does allow file uploads, but not without editing the configuration
files, and setting the maximum file size and allowable file extensions. You can
upload, but it does take a significant amount of work that exceeds the scope
of this book.
Uploading with Command-Line FTP
(Speaking of Old School . . .)
We’ve talked about FTP clients and Web-based forms to handle the uploading
process for your podcast media files. Each option requires you to either down-
load some specialty software or make a selection of a hosting company that
offers HTTP transfers. There is another way . . .
Every PC and Mac user has a built-in FTP program. Neither is elegant nor
pretty, and is the antithesis of simplicity at first glance. But these built-in
tools are handy to know about, especially if you can’t install new programs
(library or shared-student computers may have this restriction) and/or your
hosting provider does not provide a Web-based HTTP transfer option.
153
Chapter 7: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)

We talk about command-line FTP in this section, and it comes with none of the
conveniences and assurances as the other options we covered earlier in this
chapter. But it is a sure-fire way to get your files up no matter where you are.
(Almost.)
Setting up a folder for your 
podcast media file
Before we get into the program itself, you need to move the podcast media
file to a staging area on your desktop. Follow these steps:
1. Create a new folder on your desktop.
We recommend naming your folder something like media or media staging.
2. Move your podcast media files to this folder.
Drag and drop the files from a new Finder window, My Documents, or
wherever you may have them stored.
Accessing Terminal on a Mac
If you’re a Mac user, follow these steps to use Terminal to access the podcast
files you want to upload:
1. From Applications, open the Utilities folder and activate Terminal.
A small window appears, reminiscent of old-time computers where
unstyled black text appeared on a white background, or vice versa.
Your graphical interface is gone, and you might as well move the mouse
out of your way for a bit; you won’t be using it.
2. Type cd Desktop/media at the flashing cursor prompt.
Your local directory changes to the media file staging area that contains
the podcast files you’re about to upload.
Be sure to substitute the name of your folder if you’ve named it some-
thing else beside media.
Jump ahead to the section “Uploading your files” to find out how to finish the
uploading process.
154
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Accessing the command prompt on a PC
PC users can follow these steps to use the command prompt to access their
podcast files:
1. From the Start menu, choose All Programs➪Accessories➪Command
Prompt.
A small window appears, reminiscent of old-time computers where
unstyled white text appeared on a black background, or vice versa. Your
graphical interface is gone, and you might as well get your hand off the
mouse for a bit; you won’t be using it.
2. Type cd Desktop\media at the flashing cursor prompt.
Your local directory changes to the media file staging area that contains
the podcast files you’re about to upload.
Be sure to substitute the name of your folder if you’ve named it some-
thing else beside media.
The backwards slash (\) is different than what you normally use when
typing Web addresses or URLs and is normally located above the large
Enter key on most keyboards. Using a forward slash (/) doesn’t work 
on a PC.
Now you’re ready to upload your files as described in the following section.
Uploading your files
After you access the podcast files you want to load (see the two preceding
sections), the uploading process is the same on a Mac or a PC. (Bet you never
thought you’d see that happen, huh?)
Follow these steps to upload your files:
1. Type ftp my_domain_name and press the Enter key.
For example, we typed ftp dragonpage.com, and then pressed Enter.
A variety of text appears in this window, followed by a prompt to enter
your name.
2. Type your username and press Enter.
If your username is accepted, you get some positively reaffirming text,
followed by another prompt.
3. Type your password and press Enter.
155
Chapter 7: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)

If you’ve typed your password correctly, several more lines of text
describing the server appear, followed by a new prompt. You’re now
connected to (and controlling) the remote server.
4. Type cd www and press Enter.
That step takes you to the root directory where your files are accessible
to Web browsers and podcatching clients. Depending on your server
configuration, it may be public html or simply html. You may need
to check with your ISP if neither of these works for your situation.
5. Create a media folder for your podcast media files.
Type mkdir media at the prompt and press Enter, followed by cd media
and press Enter to move to that folder. You’ve just created a connection
between your local media folder and your remote media folder.
6. Type put my_podcast_file.mp3 at the prompt.
Change the name of the file to reference the file in your local directory.
Type the name exactly as it appears, with proper capitalization, because
case is important.
That’s it! If you’ve done things properly, you’ve now placed your podcast
media files on the server and are ready to create your show notes and/or
create your RSS 2.0 file. You can exit the command line by typing quit, exit, 
or close, depending on the application.
Advanced Hosting Options
Many podcasters dream of being famous. As we indicate in the beginning of
the book, popularity is a double-edged sword in the world of podcasting.
Every time new subscribers add your feed to their podcatching clients, and
every time a new listener downloads your latest media file from your Web
site, your precious bandwidth begins to disappear.
Some forward-thinking podcast-specific hosting companies such as Liberated
Syndication provide unmetered bandwidth to podcasters, keeping the costs
down even when popularity finds its way to a podcaster’s front door.
But for others, switching hosting providers may not be a simple matter.
Companies, organizations, and educational institutions may have a complete
IT infrastructure, and the politics of not using in-house systems can come
with a cost that far exceeds the few dollars Libsyn charges.
Organizations such as these may have a large base of customers, contribu-
tors, and alumnae or students to draw their audience from and can expect to
156
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

have impressive numbers of listeners as soon as their podcasts are released.
A savvy IT professional understands the heavy load this new venue can place
on the existing servers and network architecture.
The following sections give an overview of two advanced hosting options
that are designed to lower the bandwidth load created by a successful pod-
cast. Because this book is designed with the beginning podcaster in mind, we
give you a general overview of these services.
BitTorrent
BitTorrent has come under fire recently as the MPAA and RIAA are stepping up
their efforts to reign in illegal file sharing of copyrighted material. Regardless
of the controversy surrounding the contents of the files being shared, this
technology presents a sound solution to the problem of intensive bandwidth.
But like all solutions, it’s not for everyone.
BitTorrent is the latest incarnation of peer-to-peer file sharing, where individ-
uals share files with one another, rather than downloading them from individual
Web sites. These files can be music, programs, videos — anything you can
think of.
For an in-depth discussion of the technologies that make BitTorrent work,
visit www.bittorrent.com. The technically savvy can find a plethora of
information on the various aspects of BitTorrent, from creating a tracker to
the protocol specification for encoding files. The rest of us can stare blankly
at the pages, unsure of how we got here — and why we came.
BitTorrent solves the bandwidth issue by replacing the traditional “big file
stored on one computer” model with a “big file sliced up into bite-sized
pieces shared among friends” paradigm. Allow us to explain.
If you want to get Dave Winer’s latest Morning Coffee Notes (morningcoffee
notes.com) podcast, your podcatcher pulls the file down from his server. If
your mother comes along next and also wants to download the file, she gets
it in the same way. And if your Uncle Charlie wants the file as well, he also
downloads it directly from Dave’s server. The burden is on Dave’s Web server
to push all that traffic down to every user.
If Dave used BitTorrent, things would be different:
1. Dave creates a small piece of code, called a .torrent file.
This file acts as the treasure map keeping all the pieces and parts (which
we’re about to get into) nice and organized for all the people who are
trying to get Dave’s latest show.
157
Chapter 7: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)

2. Dave posts this .torrent file to his Web site and includes it in his RSS
2.0 feed.
3. When you (and each member of your extended family) access this file
with your podcatching client, the .torrent file connects your computer
to a tracker, which keeps track of everyone trying to download this par-
ticular file.
4. Here’s where it gets interesting. By the time your uncle comes on board,
he’s actually pulling parts of Dave’s file from you and your mom, at the
same time you and your mom are actively downloading other parts of
the file from Dave’s server.
5. When Evo tries to download Dave’s file, the .torrent file and the tracker
work together to start sending him files from the three of you, as well as
Dave’s system.
The net result is that Dave spends less on bandwidth, and Evo gets a whole
bunch of simultaneous downloads of individual pieces of the file, which show
up on his computer faster than if he tried to download directly from Dave!
Complicated? You bet! But as you can see, BitTorrent is beneficial for every-
one. Well, that all depends.
You see, BitTorrent only works well when a lot of people are seeding the file
to others. If there are no seeds, files are downloaded at a standard rate, and
the whole thing is moot. So while it can be great to help distribute the load
for recently released podcasts that have a large subscriber base, it’s not as
helpful for archives of past shows, or podcasts that have a small subscriber
base.
As of this writing, only a handful of podcasters are using BitTorrent technol-
ogy to distribute their feeds. Creating the .torrent file and registering with 
a tracker is non-trivial, to say the least. Currently, developers are working on
solutions to lower the technical barriers that could allow more podcasters 
to use this very beneficial technology.
CoralCDN
Coral is a relatively new player in the content distribution network (CDN)
scene. Sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Coral reduces the
bandwidth load on podcasters by distributing and sharing podcast media
files throughout a network of caching servers around the world. Once a pod-
cast media file has been cached, it’s replicated throughout the network as
more downloaders request the file, theoretically causing the file to be
accessed from the origin Web server a single time.
158
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

This can be a great boon to podcasters who are on the receiving end of the
Slashdot effect. When a popular Web site — such as Slashdot (slashdot.org)
as the name indicates — points a link at your podcast, your bandwidth can
suffer a serious blow. If you’re using Coral to distribute your media files, you
can lessen that load by orders of magnitude, because the caching servers on
the Coral network, not your Web server, handle the distribution of the pod-
cast media files.
The Coral network has some innovative methods of internal load balancing
and intelligent redirect mechanisms to ensure a highly available network.
Podcasters are assured files are transmitted faithfully, and podcatchers
receive the subscribed episodes — even under heavy loads.
Any podcaster can start using Coral immediately. It requires no sign up, no
software to buy, and no server configurations to make.
You can modify server settings to automatically use Coral with your pod-
casts. Editing the configuration files in Apache server is a bit outside the
scope of this book, however. For more information, visit coralcdn.org.
Using Coral to distribute your podcast feeds is as simple as adding the follow-
ing to your media file URL:
.nyud.net:8090
Evo recently experimented with using Coral to distribute his Slice of Scifi pod-
casts. A generous donor was hosting this Web site, but increased awareness
in the podcasting community was causing it to be hit hard in the bandwidth
department. Prior to using Coral, his podcast files had links that looked like:
http://www.sliceofscifi.com/slicePod/Slice_009_052605.mp3
To have Coral cache the file and distribute it throughout its network, he
simply altered the filename:
http://www.sliceofscifi.com.nyud.net:8090/slicePod/Slice_009_
052605.mp3
So what happened when he did that? From the end listener’s point of view,
absolutely nothing. Both URLs access the file just fine. Only one came directly
from my Web server, and the other comes from a caching server on the Coral
network.
But podcasters can notice a big change. Evo’s Web stats program showed a
significant drop in the number of downloads for the show, as his Web server
is only sending the file to the Coral network and not to individual listeners.
159
Chapter 7: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)

For the next 12 hours, any requests for his media file were handled by one of
the many Coral caching servers instead of his Web server. If a request came
in after the initial 12 hours, the network re-examined his file to see if it had
changed and restarted the process all over again.
Coral is designed for static content. After you alter the URL to your podcast
media file, this file is served for the next 12 hours. If you suddenly realize you
forgot to put an ending tag on your file, had your levels set too low, or linked
your last confessional by mistake, the whole world (or at least your sub-
scribers) are going to know about it for the next 12 hours, and you can do
nothing to stop it. You can put your eyes back in your head now . . .
Many of your listeners who use their at-work connections to enjoy your show
may likely have problems accessing your episodes if you use Coral. Because of
some overly complicated Web server port configurations that you don’t need
to know about, many corporations inadvertently block access to the connec-
tion path (ports) Coral uses to distribute content. Remember how we said Evo
had recently experimented with Coral? He’s switched back. Too many e-mails
from listeners who could no longer listen. For Evo, Coral wasn’t worth the
bandwidth savings, and he decided to go with the unmetered plan of Libsyn
instead. If you are not expecting a huge at-work listener base, then Coral may
be worth the minimal loss of your listener base to save on your hosting fees.
Archiving Aging Media Files
Podcast media files are big. Earlier we suggested you keep only the most
recent shows online and in your RSS 2.0 feed. But your listeners likely won’t
care about server space and bandwidth issues. If they find a connection with
your podcast, some of them are going to want your older podcast media files
as well.
As a podcaster, you’re in a difficult position. On the one hand, you want to
keep your listeners happy and share your previous shows, music, art, voice,
and ideas with them. But unless you’re getting paid by the listener, happy 
listeners don’t pay your server costs. If listeners want your old files, they’ll
likely be sensitive to your constraints and happy to go through a few reasonable
hoops as long as they get what they need. Here are a few novel suggestions
on how to deal with this good-to-have problem:
 Set up a rotating archive feed.
 Use the Internet archive.
 Rent a new server and charge for access.
The follow sections explain these points in more detail.
160
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Set up a rotating archive feed
An archive feed takes a bit of dedication on your part. Unless you’re com-
pletely maxed out on your server space, you likely have room for one more
podcast media file. This method takes that unutilized space and puts it to
good use satisfying your hungry audience.
Every day or two, upload one of your previous files (because no podcasters
ever delete any of their own podcasts from their personal computer) to your
Web server and create a custom RSS 2.0 feed just for this file. We discuss how
to create RSS 2.0 feeds in Chapter 9. Meanwhile, on your regular podcast,
mention that you have a new feed created for archived shows and tell all
interested listeners to subscribe to that new feed as well. Repeat this process
every few days. You may wish to start from your first show so you don’t
forget where you’re at!
Use the Internet Archive
The Internet Archive (www.archive.org) is a 501(c)(3) organization dedi-
cated to the preservation of digital content. It provides the service free of
charge, but it has some catches:
 The archives are a community center. If your podcast is protected by
exclusive copyright, it can’t be contained in the archive. Creative
Commons licenses are allowed, however, and even recommended.
 Joining the Internet Archive is free, and there is no charge to hold your
content. Notice we said hold and not host. Think of the Internet Archive
as a library. Content is added to a library for the benefit of everybody.
Hosting companies are at your beck and call. Librarians are not.
 As a free service, it offers no guarantees of uptime and reliability. This
is a non-profit organization; so we suggest you don’t store your critical
podcast media files here. But storing previous editions is another matter
all together.
Rent a new server and charge for access
If your content has a good following, your listening audience may be willing
to pay for access to previous content. Several syndicated radio programs and
magazines take this approach now, providing the most recent episodes as a

Chapter 7: Move It on Up (To Your Web Server)

While this idea may smack in the face of the free nature of podcasts to date,
nothing is stopping you from making a “for fee” podcast feed where you can
house all your old episodes. The major podcatching clients iPodderX and
iPodder Lemon both support secure connections.
Chapter 13 covers more ways you can derive income from your podcast,
including paid subscriptions.

n the world of traditional broadcasting, programs and episodes are usually
self-sufficient. In other words, what you see (or hear) is what you get, and
accompanying documentation usually isn’t made available.
Not true in the podcasting world.
A good podcaster does more than simply talk about an article, band, recipe,
or upcoming event — he encourages listeners to get more information on the
subject. You can accomplish this via show notes, and they’re an effective tool
traditional broadcasters can only dream of.
Show notes are brief summaries of each podcast episode. They can take the
form of an outline, a bulleted list, or just a few sentences of text. In this chap-
ter, we show you how to effectively use show notes to enhance the listener
experience of your show and bring in additional traffic to your podcast
through search engines.
Getting additional traffic means additional bandwidth consumption, which
can cause issues. Flip to Chapter 7 for tips on ways to reduce the load on
your servers, or optional hosting plans that don’t charge for additional 
bandwidth.

Show Note Etiquette
Several schools of thought exist on how to approach show notes. Some say
you should be very brief, only using notes to hold URLs and other pieces of
important offline data that your listeners may not have had time to write
down as the show was playing.
Others suggest show notes should be filled with information on each and every
concept touched upon in the show. We prefer a more moderate approach,
and your personal tastes and style go a long way in determining what is right
for you.
Regardless of the length of your prose and the level of detail you wish to
explain, all podcasters should follow some basic rules of etiquette:
 Use intriguing and informative titles. Your title is your pitch; you’re a
huckster competing for the attention of listeners. Some listeners may
know all about you; others could be seeing something from you for the
first time. Include key words in your title that accurately and specifically
represent the contents of this episode, as well as generate some excite-
ment and make the episode sound interesting and intriguing to potential
listeners.
 Include links to all the locations mentioned in the podcast. If you’re
talking about a trip to the local museum, provide a link to the museum’s
Web site in your show notes. If you mention another podcast, link to it.
Good linking brings good karma, and it may provide some interesting and
potentially helpful “Hey you linked to me!” comments (and backlinks)
from others.
 Be concise. Remember, these are show notes and not show transcripts.
Leave the colorful anecdotes for the podcast media file and keep your
notes short and to the point.
Figure 8-1 displays how Robynn of the Projekt Podkast (projektpodkast.com)
uses show notes. The notes include plenty of backlinks and a brief sentence
about the conversation she had with the band members. A thing of beauty,
to be sure.
When we think of show note etiquette, we’re reminded of a commercial that
aired years ago for a small car company. The premise was “if everyone drove
one of our tiny cars, traffic congestion would vanish, the demand for fossil
fuels would drop, and the world would be a generally nicer place.”
We’re convinced that if every podcaster followed these three simple show
note guidelines, the podcasting world would be a better place. The impact on
traffic jams and oil consumption remains questionable, but one can dream . . .

Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Planning the Post
The amount of time you spend planning your show notes is inversely propor-
tional to the amount of time you spend during your show prep (see Chapter 3).
For those of you who forgot everything from your Algebra II class, allow us
to paraphrase: The more you prepare for your show, the less time you spend
working on the show notes.
Examine the notes you used when you recorded your podcast. Did you talk
about any Web sites? Find the URLs and make sure you spell them right. We
highly recommend the copy-and-paste technique for URLs, rather than rely-
ing on your typing skills, especially for lengthy URLs.
If you recorded and/or edited your show hours or days before you started
the notation process, replaying the media file with pen and paper at the
ready is a good idea. Look for need-to-know moments and jot them down as
the show plays. After it finishes, use a search engine to find additional URLs
you may wish to provide to your listeners on topics included in your show.
It’s all in the details
Now is a good time to figure out what level of detail you’re going to employ in
your show notes. Several factors can influence your decision, and audience
expectation and personal choice are among the more important.

165
Chapter 8: Posting Show Notes

Here’s a good rule: The deeper you dive in to a single topic, the less detailed
your notes need to be. That may sound counterintuitive, and please keep in
mind this is only a general rule and not cannon law. For example, if your pod-
cast episode features a 20-minute interview with Sir Arthur C. Clarke about
the symbolic differences between 2001: A Space Odyssey the novel and the
movie, you likely won’t have much more than a link to buy the book and/or
rent the movie.
Show note details serve two primary purposes:
 To act as a table of contents for the episode
 To allow listeners to skip ahead if they so chose
As the podcaster, you can decide how much or how little you embrace these
purposes. Here are some approaches that other podcasters have adopted:
 Add a time stamp. Some podcasters, such as Dawn and Drew (dawnand
drew.com), put the exact time stamp of when they change topics, which
is quite frequently. Time stamps can be quite helpful to your listeners if
you cover a wide range of topics in a given episode, and want to assist
possible listeners in jumping around.
 Write your show notes in complete sentences and paragraphs. Taking
cues from the world of blogging, many podcasters follow a similar
approach to Kris Smith of The Croncast (croncast.com). Kris writes 
his show notes in prose, using complete sentences and paragraphs in
place of bullet points and time stamps. This approach feels better to
potential readers, giving them a flavor of the show without having to
listen. However, we’ve also heard listeners complain that key elements
are difficult to find in this format.
 Create more than a one-line summary. Still other podcasters, such as
Dave Winer (morningcoffeenotes.com) take the opposite approach,
and post a simple one-liner that isn’t much more than a title. We suggest
new podcasters not follow his lead, as it doesn’t do much for helping
attract new listeners. Dave is a seminal figure in the world of podcasting
and gets most of his listeners because he’s Dave Winer, not because he
posts great show notes.
A picture is worth a thousand words
Some podcasters include a representative image or two in their show notes.
While random graphics only serve to increase your bandwidth consumption
and clutter your page, well-selected images can add flavor and dimension to
your show notes.
166
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Before you add an image to your post, keep in mind these three considerations:
 Is the image protected by copyright? Posting someone else’s creative
work without first securing permission (which may include royalties 
and fees) is stealing, pure and simple, and can land even the most well-
meaning podcaster in a heap of legal trouble.
 Can you link directly to the image, or do you need to copy it to your
server? Some sites, such as Amazon.com, allow you do link directly to
images as they sit on the Web site. These sites have a huge technology
infrastructure and can handle remote hosting images that appear on
other sites. But many smaller and personal sites can’t handle the load a
popular podcast or blog can put on their systems if they allowed direct
linking to their stored images. In these cases, copy the image to your
own server before adding it to your page. If you’re going to do this, it’s
good karma to provide an “image courtesy of . . .” link to the original
site. Again, this assumes you’ve received the appropriate permissions 
to copy the file. When in doubt, don’t.
 Does the image fit on your page? Images too small or too large aren’t
doing your listeners any favors. Make sure the image you select is the
right size. You can add width=x height=x declarations to your image
tags to control the size, but keep in mind that this distorts the image.
Previewing your post with resized images is a must. If your HTML is a
little rusty, check out HTML 4 For Dummies, by Ed Tittel and Mary
Burmeister (Wiley), for additional help.
We can’t stress enough how important it is that you not take, post, modify,
or use any image without the express permission of the copyright owners.
The act of someone posting an image to a Web site does not give you carte
blanche to use it as you see fit. When in doubt, leave it out.
Posting Your Show Notes
If you’ve planned and prepared, posting your podcast is easy. And if you’ve
decided for the minimalist approach or don’t really care to utilize show notes,
this process can go quickly as well.
In this section, we show you how to enter your show notes by using Movable
Type and Libsyn as examples. If you use another tool to make your posts, or
if you create your notes by hand, you still get value out of these examples as
we show you things to consider along the way.
167
Chapter 8: Posting Show Notes

Posting in Movable Type
Follow these steps to post show notes in Movable Type (www.movabletype.
org):
1. Create a new entry.
Click New Entry from the navigation bar or choose Main Menu➪Create
Entry.
2. In the Title text box, enter the title of your podcast.
We cover some titling tips in a moment. For now, simply enter a basic
description of what this episode is about. “Fishing trip to Alaska” for
example.
3. Chose the appropriate category for the podcast from the Primary
Category drop-down list.
Evo uses the highly descriptive Shows category to segregate podcast
entries from regular text entries for his blog. You may have a different
setup, so choose accordingly.
4. In the Entry Body text box, type your detailed show notes.
Follow a chronological order and list the various topics covered in your
show, one on each line. Be sure and add URLs to any Web sites you men-
tion. Movable Type makes this easy with the HTML editing buttons at
the top of the Entry Body box (see Figure 8-2).
These buttons may not display for you if you’re on a Mac and you use
Safari. Chances are, other browsers may not be able to display these but-
tons. If that happens to you, try Firefox (www.mozilla.org/products/
firefox).
Many podcasters use a hybrid approach to show notes, including gen-
eral notes in the Entry Body section, with more detailed notes, complete
with time stamps and links, in the Extended Entry section. This cuts
down on clutter for the resulting posts, while enabling those who wish
to access the more detailed nuts and bolts of a particular episode.
Others make extensive use of the Excerpt and Keywords sections. If 
you want to, go ahead!
5. Add the link to your podcast media file.
In Chapter 7, we show you how to move your podcast media files to a
server on the Web. Now we put that to good use.
a. On a new line, type a text description for your link.
This can be your choice, but to keep this simple we recommend
Download this show.
b. Highlight the portion of the text you want to link.
168
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

For illustration purposes, use your cursor to highlight this show on
the line of text you just created.
c. Create the link by clicking the hyperlink button, shown in Figure 8-2.
The Enter URL window appears, as shown in Figure 8-3.
d. Enter the URL of the podcast media file. Then click OK.
Don’t remove the http://. Type the full path to the file, such as
http://www.mysite.com/media/MS001_103105.mp3.
Your notes now contain a properly hyperlinked reference to your pod-
cast media files. Figure 8-4 shows a fully filled out New Entry window, 
utilizing the Extended Entry field as well.

Chapter 8: Posting Show Notes

In the next chapter, you find out about creating the RSS 2.0 feed so that
people can subscribe to your podcast. Assuming you’ve installed the
MT-Enclosures plug-in, Movable Type makes RSS feeds easy. Don’t worry
about it for now because we cover it in detail in Chapter 9.
6. Click the Preview button to see a sample of how the post will look
when it’s published.
Make sure you typed your URLs right and check your spelling and spac-
ing. If you see anything that needs fixing, click the Re-edit This Entry link
and make your corrections.
7. Click Save This Entry to publish the post.
The post is published to your site, and the process of creating your
properly constructed RSS 2.0 file is started (which we cover in depth
in Chapter 9).
8. Check your site.
Visiting your Web page is a good idea to make sure everything looks as
you expected it to. If it doesn’t, simply edit the post and resave your
changes.

Posting on Libsyn
Because Libsyn (www.libsyn.com) is a dedicated podcast hosting provider,
the steps are quite intuitive and a bit different than those used by bloggers.
1. To create a new post, click the podcast/blog tab or the link of the
same name from the main page.
2. Select the Podcast radio button.
Libsyn also allows text-only posts to the site. Great for times when you
want to post some text without a media file, such as to say “I’m on vaca-
tion for the next two weeks . . .”
3. Choose a category for your podcast from the Category drop-down list.
Categories on Libsyn work like they do with most blogging applications.
To keep this simple, choose Podcast from the list.
4. Enter a title for this episode.
We cover some titling tips later in this section. For now, simply enter a
basic description of what this episode is about — “Fishing trip to Alaska”
for example.
5. Skip the Post Image drop-down list for now.
Yes, you can put something in there if you must. But it’s not required.
See our earlier comments on using images in this chapter if you decide
you can’t live without one. (But you probably could . . .)
6. Enter the detailed show notes in the Post Body text box.
This is the appropriate place for your detailed show notes. Follow a
chronological order and list the various topics covered in your show,
one on each line. Be sure and add URLs to any Web sites you mention.
Simply typing the URL in this section isn’t quite as effective as providing
a true hyperlink. Making a hyperlink isn’t difficult, though it may look
that way to those not familiar with the mysteries of HTML.
Hyperlinks follow this convention:
<a href=”link/to/website/or/web/page”>Name of link</a>
Basically, you fill out what’s between the quotes, replace the name of the
link, and you’re done. Here are a few real-world examples:
<a href=”http://dragonpage.com”>The Dragon Page</a>
<a href=”http://teemorris.com/podcast”>Morevi podcast</a>
<a href=”http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/images.html”>Pictures from
Mars</a>
171
Chapter 8: Posting Show Notes

7. Chose your podcast media file from the drop-down list.
If you haven’t uploaded the show yet, Libsyn makes it easy. Simply click
the Browse button and navigate to the appropriate file in your media
folder (which we show how to set up in Chapter 7).
8. Select the Auto Ping check box.
This helps spread the word about your podcast, telling audio.weblogs.
com that a new episode of your show is ready. We talk more about pings
in Chapter 10.
Because Libsyn doesn’t allow you to preview your post first, we highly
recommend checking your spelling and double-checking your links
before you proceed. An ounce of prevention and all that. Figure 8-5
shows how your post looks on Libsyn before it is posted.
9. Click the Post button.
Libsyn makes it hard to screw up, requiring you to fill out the appropri-
ate fields before allowing you to continue. If you’re successful, you see a
nice green check box next to your brand new post.
10. Check your page.
Click the link to your show name and see how it looks in the real world.
Check your links, spelling, and layout. If it’s not the way you want it,
close the window and click the name of your post to edit it further.

Boosting Search Engine Rankings 
with Good Show Notes
One of the more tangible benefits of quality show notes is the impact they
can have on your listings within search engines. With the exception of brand-
new search engines such as Podscope (podscope.com), traditional search
engines cannot (yet) scan and index the contents of your podcast media files.
As such, you need to provide text for the search engine spiders and bots to
examine and evaluate for index inclusion.
We go into more detail about spiders and bots in Chapter 11. For now, you
just need to know that they are simply tools that search engines use to find
and present interesting information when people search for a particular
topic.
Podcasters can learn a lot of tips and tricks from bloggers and other Web site
owners on how to boost search engine rankings. Many include page-level
changes to positioning of elements, correct usage of headings, meta and image
tags, and backlinking techniques. All of that conversation is far beyond the
scope of this book. Grab a copy of Search Engine Optimization For Dummies by
Peter Kent (published by Wiley) and break out your code editor if you want to
make a bigger splash.
In this section, we show you some best practices to implement right away
that can make your notes (and podcast) more accessible to search engines —
and ultimately search engine users.
Loading up your titles
Search engines (and searchers) pay close attention to titles. You should con-
sider the title of your individual podcast episodes every bit as important as
the title of a given Web page.
Important as they are, most podcasters struggle with effective titles. The
biggest problem comes from confusing titles with descriptions. If your title
starts with “In this episode . . . ,” stop right there. You’re writing the descrip-
tion, not the title. A title is a string of well-chosen and crafted words that has
no room for superfluous baggage.
We find that the best titles come from a re-examination of your show notes. If
you haven’t made your notes yet, you may find coming up with a solid title
quite tough. Here’s the process we suggest:
1. Read your show notes and pull out the key elements, thoughts, or
themes covered on the show.
173
Chapter 8: Posting Show Notes

2. When you have your list of elements, try to boil each of them down to
a single word or phrase, if possible.
Think about the types of people who might be interested in the contents
of your show, and pick common words they are likely to search on.
Using the Alaskan fishing trip from earlier in this chapter, we’ve come up 
with the following completely made-up topics and themes from an imaginary
show:
 Sleeping in the Seattle airport while the flight was delayed
 Interesting discussion with 80 year-old angler during the flight
 Great success with a Tebo XR-123 Kevlar pole
 Seeing bears fishing in the same stream
 Discovering a great new recipe for salmon gumbo
 Mountain biking the last day
Okay, not the most interesting show on the planet (at least from our point of
view), but you see what you can do with that.
The first step is to figure out what’s important. Not just to you, but to your
listeners and potential listeners. If you’re a comedian, the airport delay and
the old man on the plane might be good places to start. If this is a more seri-
ous fishing show, the experience with the new pole and the aged angler are
the key points.
But if your show is a relatively serious outdoorsman show, and you’re trying
to entertain and attract like-minded anglers. Getting rid of the fluff is a good
idea. You can select the key points and boil them down to the following:
Ancient anglers, space-age fishing gear, and salmon gumbo from Alaska.
That’s a solid title, giving searchers a good tease of what they can expect.
Notice how it doesn’t cover everything and it shouldn’t try. That’s the job of
the description where you can go into even greater detail on those three ele-
ments, plus the many other things you talk about on the show.
The title also carries good keywords likely to be of interest to fishermen or
wanna-be-fisherman considering a trip to Alaska, looking for new equipment
(we have it on good authority fishermen call their equipment gear), and
maybe even those interested in wild game cooking.
Chances are, you know your audience much better than we do. Think about
how people are likely to search, and write your titles for that. Keep them
short, don’t try to cover everything, and employ more detailed descriptions
to carry the rest of your story.
174
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Soliciting backlinks
Backlinks are the Holy Grail of search engine optimization. A backlink is
simply a link from one Web site to another Web site. Sites that have a lot of
backlinks pointing to them are considered “more important” to the computers
that control how and where your site shows up on a search engine. In order
to get backlinks from others, you have to create links to their Web sites in
your show notes.
In the highly suspect Alaskan fishing trip we’ve used throughout this chapter,
you could link to several things, and a few that you really should link to. For
example, you could provide a link to the airline that messed up the flight, but
what’s the point? On the other hand, you most certainly want to create a link
to a place to buy or read more about the new gear, and likely would want to
link to the outfitter.
After you make the links and post the show, you need to start soliciting 
backlinks:
 Write to the Tebo corporation to tell them you’re posting a review of
one of its products. Getting big companies to link to you doesn’t always
happen, but sometimes it does. And getting backlinks from big popular
sites is very beneficial to your rankings.
 Send an e-mail to the outfitter you booked the trip with and maybe even
the hotel.
 Notify various fishing bloggers and podcasters about the new episode. It
only takes a few moments of your time and is information they would or
should welcome.
A fine line exists between asking for backlinks and spamming someone. Make
each e-mail personal, provide the exact link you want them to use, and tell
them why you think it’s important for them to link it. If you can’t think of a
good reason why that site should link to you, then you shouldn’t ask for it.
A Word on OPML Show Notes
Hang out in the podosphere long enough, and you’ll hear the cryptic acronym
OPML thrown around. OPML stands for Outline Processor Markup Language,
and it’s a big part of what makes up the infrastructure used in podcasting.
It’s the O in the acronym that matters most to viewers: outline. The output of
an OPML file (when used properly) looks like an outline, but with collapsible
sub-points under each main point. Programmers get all giddy at the last three
letters because you can pass it lots of information along with the hierarchical
arrangement of text.
175
Chapter 8: Posting Show Notes

OPML is both cool and powerful, but it’s also esoteric in shape (by definition)
and somewhat beyond the scope of this book. Still, it’s good to know what it
is and how the podcasting world uses it, even if you never implement it with
your podcast.
Most of the directories either import their data from or export their data to
OPML. When you look at a particular node in the iPodder.org directory, you’re
looking at information that is controlled by an OPML file. When you view the
list of podcasts in the iPodderX Top Picks directory, you’re viewing informa-
tion that came from an OPML file.
OPML has been breaking out from being a behind-the-scenes player for 
nearly as long as podcasting has been around. It’s been slow going, probably
because most podcasters don’t really see how creating OPML files can help
their podcasts.
In all likelihood, most podcasters never find themselves in a situation where
they’re creating OPML files for their shows. They’ll likely use it everyday, as
OMPL creation could be built in to various applications, but only a few folks
need to sit down and say “Well, it’s time to create my OPML file.”
OPML is a bit too technical for detailed discussion in this book, but it is
worth mentioning in this chapter because it makes up such a large part of 
the podcasting landscape, even if podcasters and podcast listeners never
notice it.
For more information on OPML, we recommend going straight to the master
himself, Dave Winer. He’s created a site just for OPML at www.opml.org. It’s
not for the neophyte or faint of heart. But if you have development in your
bones, you just might find some interesting applications for it.

Geeking Out on XML and RSS
In This Chapter
 Understanding RSS
 Creating good introductions
 Handling multi-format podcasts
You’ve entered the dark and murky waters of XML and RSS generation —
a region of the podcasting sea that strikes fear into the hearts of the
uninitiated, causes mild-mannered podcasting preachers to break out into
curse words that would make a sailor blush, and has soured more than one
would-be independent media producer on the whole prospect of podcasting.
Relax. For the most part, the trials and tribulations you might have heard
others had to go through are mostly overblown. If it were as hard as some
have made it out to be, there wouldn’t be as many podcasts as there are
available today. The XML-and-RSS step wasn’t designed to be complicated,
it’s just quirky in that direction, and it’s been tainted by the experiences of
a few who jumped in a little too fast, without a trusty guide to show them
the path.
This chapter shines a big bright spotlight on XML and RSS elements, showing
you that they aren’t as mean and scary as they’ve been made out to be. After
reading this chapter, you’ll have a solid strategy for generating your pod-
cast’s RSS 2.0 file, some options for dealing with multiple media files, and the
confidence to tweak your RSS file as you see fit.
You’re probably asking yourself: “Do I need to know all that”? Well, yes and
no. Granted, you’ll likely be using blogging software or some podcast-hosting
company that takes care of the RSS 2.0 feed for you. It’s still a good idea to
know what goes on under the hood, in our opinion.

Elements That Make the RSS Go ’Round
The main function of your RSS 2.0 file is to distribute your media files to
people who have subscribed to your podcast. RSS is nothing more than
“marked up” text with special tags. (For more about the technical aspects
of RSS, check out the nearby sidebar.) Here’s a sample RSS 2.0 feed:
<?xml version=”1.0”?>
<rss version=”2.0” xmlns:content=”http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/”
xmlns:itunes=”http://www.itunes.com/DTDs/Podcast-1.0.dtd”>
<channel>
<title>The Great Outdoors Podcast</title>

Getting a handle on TLAs (three-letter acronyms)
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.
“Markup” is a lot like what your teacher used to
do to your homework, only more useful: “mark-
ing up” a text file with some special tags that
control how the text is used by various applica-
tions, like a podcatching client. This is good
news for those of you without advanced
degrees in computer science: It’s text (in this
case, English or something a lot like it) that tells
other text how to present itself.
“Extensible” means developers can add addi-
tional tags beyond the original “set” that was
designed for XML. In other words, a developer
can add to the code base of XML, adapting it to
individual needs. Okay, feel free to forget that if
you want — you won’t have to worry about cre-
ating new tags, thanks to RSS 2.0.
RSS is a ‘“flavor” (modified version) of XML, and it
stands for Really Simple Syndication.(Syndication
is the process of getting the goods — whether
Web site update, news bulletin, or podcast — to
the intended audience.) Luckily for us podcasters,
XML was extended to RSS, which was further
extended to create RSS 2.0. And inside RSS 2.0 is
where you find the appropriate tags and elements
that make podcasts work.
You’ll hear podcasters use the terms XML and
RSS interchangeably. Sometimes they say the
version number (2.0) out loud and in print, other
times it’s simply implied. There is at least one
other version of XML that works with podcast-
ing: Atom. No, it’s not a TLA, because it has four
letters and it doesn’t stand for anything, but it is
a version of XML. The good news is that most
podcatching clients read either Atom or RSS 2.0
files; the differences between Atom and RSS 2.0
files are, for the purposes of this book, minimal.
In fact, advanced RSS 2.0 feeds often incorpo-
rate Atom elements, further blurring the differ-
ences between the two formats. To minimize
headaches, this chapter focuses on RSS 2.0 as
the preferred method of syndicating your pod-
cast to podcatching clients. And yes, iTunes
fans, we do cover the extra tags your pod-
catcher of choice has made us all deal with.
If you want an even deeper dive into the world
of RSS syndication — because you can do
some really cool stuff with it — we highly rec-
ommend Ellen Finkelstein’s Syndicating Web
Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies (Wiley

Okay, that’s a lot to digest in a single sitting. The next sections of the book
break it down into individual parts to show you how un-scary it really is.
If you’re currently using (or planning to use) software to generate your RSS
2.0 feed, it’ll take care of just about all this brouhaha for you. It’s still a good
idea, however, to have solid grasp of this section in the event you want to
make some modifications to your RSS 2.0 feed in the future. (Most podcasters
do, sooner or later.)
180
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Well, your “feed generator” may not be of much help with the iTunes-specific
stuff. iTunes burst on to the podcasting scene without much advanced notice
(read: ANY). And when it did, it came up with unique tags instead of reusing
what RSS 2.0 already provided. Take a good hard look at the tool you are using
to generate your RSS feed and see if it has any iTunes-specific tags. If not, you
may have to break out the manual and see how you can add them yourself.
It’s scarier than it sounds, trust us.
Do you have anything to declare?
All RSS 2.0 documents should start with a declaration statement. Think of this
declaration as working with a “Hello, my name is . . .” badge. This statement
identifies the contents of the file, allowing podcatching clients and other XML
parsers or readers to know what to expect and how to handle the contents.
Some declarations wear their hearts on their sleeves, some are terse, but all
RSS 2.0 documents do the initial honors with these first two lines of text:
<?xml version=”1.0”?>
<rss version=”2.0” xmlns:content=”http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/”
xmlns:itunes=”http://www.itunes.com/DTDs/Podcast-1.0.dtd”>
With those two lines of text, you’ve declared that the document is written in
XML version 1.0 and is of the special flavor RSS 2.0. Additionally, it calls out
two specialized namespaces, which we get into in a bit. You might want to
write those two lines on your forehead backward (metaphorically speaking,
of course) so you’ll always see ’em in the mirror as a reminder: They are what
you use to start every RSS 2.0 file you create as a podcaster.
A namespace is denoted by the xmlns: statement, followed by the URL of the
“home” of the namespace. In the preceding instance, we call the namespaces
for the encoded content module as well as iTunes tags. Purists will argue that
encoded content isn’t necessary and that even the iTunes tags are optional.
But they both go a long way toward getting your podcast listened to by the
most people.
What’s on this <channel>?
An RSS 2.0 document contains a single <channel> statement, complete with
lots of other information to help describe the channel. A channel can contain
multiple <item> statements, and each <item> can have lots of other informa-
tion to describe the individual item.
Okay, here’s a real-world example to clarify the issue: NBC is a “channel” on
your television. Depending on the day of the week and the time of the day,
various different “items” are made available for viewing. It’s not an accident
that podcasting works the same way.
181
Chapter 9: Geeking Out on XML and RSS

In the following sections, we examine the contents of the <channel> declara-
tion from the example at the beginning of the chapter. (We cover <item> tags
in the later section “Loading up on <items>s.”)
<title> tag
You use the <title> tag to hold the title of your channel or the title of your
overall podcast. Here’s the title from the example just given:
<title>The Great Outdoors Podcast</title>
This line of text says, “Here’s what’s inside me.” It never changes, unless you
decide to change the name of your podcast. Don’t abbreviate or shorten the
name unless you have a very good reason for doing that.
Almost every markup language uses this format of beginning and ending tags
encapsulated in angle brackets, or greater-than and less-than signs. The
ending tag uses the same name, but it’s preceded by a / character to tell the
software that the tag is now closed. In the example just given, you can think
of the code as talking to the podcatching client, along these lines: “(The next
thing you’ll read is the title.) The Great Outdoors Podcast (That was the
end of the title.)”
<link> entry
Here’s a good place to put a link that leads back to your Web site or blog. The
beauty of RSS and podcasting is that the listeners don’t have to be looking at
your Web page to listen to your show. This link allows them (through their
podcatching clients) an easy way to find your Web site if they so desire:
<link>http://www.mypodcast.com/</link>
<description> entry
Your description, much like your title, will rarely (if ever) change. Find a good
description for what your shows are about. The following example is pretty
poor (just kidding, okay?), so try to put in some words that truly identify
what your podcast is about:
<description>The best podcast on the planet. Period. With your host,
me!</description>
<webMaster> and <managingEditor> entries
The Webmaster is the person responsible for the technical accuracy of 
the information contained in the feed. The managing editor is the person
responsible for the messaging and content contained within the tags. For
most podcasters, these both reflect the same e-mail address. Note that 
the <managingEditor> tag requires a name in parentheses to follow the
e-mail address.
182
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Okay, maybe the words webMaster and managingEditor aren’t a perfect fit
with podcasting, but including an e-mail address for the person responsible
for this feed as well as the content is an excellent idea. We’ve e-mailed the
keepers of various feeds to report problems we’ve encountered with their
feeds — and each one has been very appreciative. Although having that infor-
mation can help improve the podcasting experience for everyone, many feeds
don’t provide contact information. If you make it easy for people to help you,
you’re ahead of the game. Include a valid e-mail address in your feed.
<webMaster>evo@mypodcast.com</webMaster>
<managingEditor>evo@mypodcast.com (Evo Terra)</managingEditor>
<pubDate> entry
At the <channel> level, this tag indicates the last time the feed was updated.
It is very important that you follow the correct convention when adding this
element — you can’t just put any old date in here.
Getting the <pubDate> (publication date) correct is terribly important, but it’s
often overlooked by podcasters in a hurry. Don’t fall into this trap. Include a
publication date and make sure you do it right:
<pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2005 12:02:28 -0800</pubDate>
The publication date is being utilized by more listing sites and directories as
a way to show fresh content. Don’t be stale; use the publication date.
The <pubDate> element must follow the RFC #822 guidelines (asg.web.cmu.
edu/rfc/rfc822.html), which are simply:
[day of week], [day of month] [month] [year] [24 hour time] [time zone (GMT)]
Simple as that may be, you have to follow the correct naming convention for
each of those elements. Table 9-1 shows how.

The day of the week is always expressed in double digits, adding a zero in
front of any single-digit numbers (for example, 03 instead of 3), and the
year is always expressed in four digits. (Well, at least it will be for the next
8,000 years or so, and then we’ll just have to do something different.)
The big stumbling block with <pubDate> tends to be the time and zone:
 The time should always be expressed in 24-hour or military time,
(HH:MM:SS). Again, add zeros in front if necessary (for example,
03:07:02 is correct).
 The time zone isn’t represented by everyday abbreviations such as PST.
Instead, it’s referenced from GMT, or Greenwich Mean Time. (That’s a
city in England where the International Date Line passes through, not 
a small village on the east coast of the United States.) Podcasters in
California are in either -0800 or -0700 (that’s 8 or 7 hours earlier than
GMT, respectively) depending on whether Daylight Saving Time is in
effect.
Don’t sweat the time stamp too hard. You should be changing the date every
time you put up a new episode, but even if you had to hard-code the time
stamp to 12:00:00 -0800, you wouldn’t have a problem with it. Chances
are, your RSS 2.0 is generated automatically, so time stamping should not be
an issue.
<category> entry
Though the original drafters of RSS 2.0 had something very specific in mind,
the <category> tag has become pretty much a free-for-all. If your podcast
has an industry-recognized category, use that. If not, make it up! That’s what
we did in our example:
<category>Outdoors</category>
184
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

<image> tag
This optional RSS tag provides a graphical representation of your podcast. 
It actually contains several subelements that further describe the image.
They are
 URL: The location of your image (in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format) on a
Web server.
 Width: The width of your image, up to 144 pixels.
 Height: The height of your image, up to 400 pixels.
 Title: This text describes the image, but most people just describe their
podcast again, because that’s what the image should do anyhow.
 Link: The link to your Web site — just because you needed to put that in
one more place. Can you say “overkill”?
All these elements, when used together, result in something very much
like this:
<image>
<url>http://mypodcast.com/images/logos/tDPWi100x86.jpg</url>
<width>100</width>
<height>86</height>
<title>The Great Outdoors Podcast</title>
<link>http://mypodcast.com</link>
</image>
<copyright> tag
Here’s where you can list the copyright information about your podcast. It’s
free-form text, so you’ll want to include all the narrative necessary to get
your copyright information across. We use Creative Commons (more on that
in Chapter 4) to retain some rights to our podcasts, yet allow for some addi-
tional freedom that is difficult with conventional “all rights reserved” notices.
<copyright>Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License</copyright>
<language> entry
While the file itself is written in the RSS 2.0 flavor of the RSS language, the
“human language” should also be declared:
<language>en-us</language>
If your podcast is not in English, see blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/
stories/storyReader$15 for the appropriate code to use in this section.
185
Chapter 9: Geeking Out on XML and RSS

<docs> entry
This is simply a link to the document that describes what RSS 2.0 is all about.
This entry is optional, but including it is considered good form. In the unlikely
event your feed is picked up by a developer who hasn’t adapted his applica-
tion to accept the RSS 2.0 standard, you’re being a good global citizen and
pointing him in the right direction. Think of this as the Rosetta Stone of your
podcast feed.
<docs>http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss</docs>
<itunes:subtitle> entry
This is what iTunes uses to populate the Description column of its applica-
tion. It should be a collection of a few choice words about your podcast. We
recommend simply mirroring the <title> tag.
<itunes:subtitle>The best podcast on the planet. Period. With your host,
Me!</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> entry
Apple says you have up to 4,000 words in this entry. This content is featured
prominently when your podcast is selected by someone interested in your
show. Sounds like a repeat of the <description> tag to us.
<itunes:summary>This podcast blows the doors off all other podcasts that have
ever come before or who will try afterwards. I’m not kidding. 
It’s that informative and earth shattering. You’ll see...
</itunes:summary>.
<itunes:owner> and <itunes:author> entries
On the surface, it may seem we’re repeating the same thing with <webMaster>
and <managingEditor> described earlier in this chapter . . . no, wait. This is
pretty much a repeat of that.
iTunes uses the <itunes:author> tag to power the Artist listing inside of
iTunes. <itunes:owner> doesn’t publicly display anywhere and is simply 
a way to identify who is responsible for the feed (much like the webMaster
tag, again). <itunes:owner> has two subelements: <itunes:name> and
<itunes:email>.
<itunes:owner>
<itunes:email>evo@mypodcast.com</itunes:email>
<itunes:name>Evo Terra</itunes:name>
</itunes:owner>
<itunes:author>Evo Terra</itunes:author>
186
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

<itunes:category> entries
Pay close attention here, folks, because this is another area that gets fouled
up more times than we care to count. You can’t make this one up — it has to
follow Apple iTunes categories.
Look at the categories inside of iTunes and find out where your podcast
belongs before starting this step. iTunes is a free download, and you have 
to install it in order to see what categories you have to choose from. Get it 
at www.apple.com/itunes/.
Some categories have subcategories, and both are handled a bit differently
when it comes to tagging. If you find a subcategory you belong to, you have
to identify not only the subcategory, but also the parent category as well. 
For this bogus feed we’ve built, we’ve selected a category/subcategory pair
as well as a category that has no subs so you can see how each is coded:
<itunes:category text=”International”>
<itunes:category text=”Canadian” />
</itunes:category>
<itunes:category text=”Sports” />
Notice how “Canadian” is nested between the beginning and ending tags
for “International”. Because “Sports” has no subcategory associated
with it, the tag has its ending / at the end of a tag, itself, just as you see with
“Canadian”.
<itunes:link> entry
Continuing to do its own thing, Apple ignored the RSS <image> tag and came
up with its own to better match the album art already used within iTunes.
This tag is made up of several different declarations, all of which you must
follow if you want your artwork to show up inside of iTunes:
 rel=”image”: This tells iTunes that the link in question is really an
image file. It’s not the most intuitive thing in the world, but you work
with what you have.
 type=”video/jpeg”: With this tag, iTunes knows that the image is a
JPEG. Bet you didn’t know that JPEG was originally used as a video
format. Neither did we. If you decide to use the PNG format, you need to
change the statement to type=”image/png”. Regardless of your format,
iTunes prefers images that are 300 pixels by 300 pixels in size.
 href=”[URL of your image]”: This is a link to the image.
 Yet another title-like statement: Make it easy on yourself and just use the
name of your podcast.
187
Chapter 9: Geeking Out on XML and RSS

When it’s all over with, you should have something that looks very much
like this:
<itunes:link rel=”image” type=”video/jpeg”
href=”http://mypodcast.com/images/logos/tDPWI300x300.jpg”>The
Great Outdoors Podcast</itunes:link>
<itunes:explicit> entry
Apple has a kid-friendly reputation to uphold. And because it already has a
huge 20-million-plus subscriber base, it doesn’t want to allow any unsavory
podcasts to fall into younger hands. Already having developed the <explicit>
tag for songs designed for mature audiences, Apple simply extended that tag to
the podcasting world.
Two possible values exist for this tag: yes or no. If you drop the F-bomb on
your show, fess up and put a yes value in this tag. If you’re so squeaky clean
that people could eat off your podcasting rig, you still include the tag, but
your value is no.
<itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit>
Loading up on <item>s
Now that the channel has been defined, it’s time to talk about the individual
items contained within the channel. An item is (in this case) an individual
podcast episode. If you have three shows available for download on your
Web site, you have three distinct <item> declarations in your file.
Chapter 8 sums up the pros and cons of making all your shows available. If
you have the server space and the bandwidth to handle it, go right ahead.
If not, you’ll want to include only the most recent podcasts in your feed. You
can control that with the items you include in your RSS 2.0 feed.
True to form, each of your podcast episodes starts off with the item declara-
tion: <item>.
<title> tag
Much like your channel, each <item> element also has a title. In this case, it’s
the title of the episode:
<title>TGOP 013 - Ancient anglers, space age fishing gear and salmon gumbo from
Alaska.</title>
Some podcasters prefer to put in some recurring text to identify their pod-
cast (in this case, TGOP); others choose not to. It really is a matter of choice.
188
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

After you decide on a naming convention for your podcast episodes, try and
stick with it. Listeners will grow comfortable with seeing your show display
on their MP3 players or computer folders in a certain way. If you randomly
change how you name your episodes, your audience may no longer recognize
the files as yours. While there is no rule against changing, you might want to
warn your audience before you do so.
<link> tag
Earlier in the chapter, we show you how to provide a link to your main podcast
Web site. Here you’re providing a link to the specific page where listeners can
find your show notes and other information about this particular episode:
<link>http://www.mypodcast.com/tgop013.html</link>
<comments> tag
If you collect and display comments from your listeners on particular 
episodes of your podcast, provide a link to that specific page. For many, 
the <comments> URL is the same as the <link> tag. In our example, it’s 
slightly different:
<comments>http://www.mypodcast.com/tgop13.html#comments</comments>
<description> tag
This tag works here in the <item> statement as it does in the <channel>
statement. It is used to provide detailed information about the episode. This
is the place for your show notes.
<description>Show Notes Cabin Fever Outfitters is the company that booked this
trip. Can’t recommend them highly enough! I had a great time

mountain bike. And you won’t want to miss my review of the Tebo

Great Outdoors Podcast Episode #13</description>
<guid> element
GUID stands for global unique identifier. Well, okay, global may not be the best
word here, but that’s what it is; don’t worry — you don’t have to pick some-
thing that’s one-of-a-kind-in-the-entire-universe. But you should pick something
that makes this entry unique to your RSS file. Here’s an example:
<guid isPermaLink=”false”>1808@http://www.mypodcast.com/</guid>
In this example, a sequential, non-repeating number is added to the beginning
of the URL of the Web site. Each time a new <item> goes in the file, the number
is incremented by one. This helps the podcatching clients figure out whether a
file is new. If a podcatching client has already seen the GUID for this particular
podcast, it doesn’t download the file. If it has never seen the GUID associated
with this podcast, it downloads the show.
189
Chapter 9: Geeking Out on XML and RSS

You can generate a GUID lots of ways. In reality, most people use a program
to help generate the RSS file, and the GUID is automatically taken care of. In
the event that it is not, you can just use the URL of the podcast media file for
this episode, assuming you use a good filenaming convention, and you don’t
plan on repeating the filename anytime in the future.
<pubDate> entry
This tag shows when the podcast episode was published. Just like in the
<channel> statement, make sure you follow the right convention. Assuming
you have more than one <item> in your feed, each item has its own different
<pubDate>.
<pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2005 12:02:28 -0800</pubDate>
<author> tag
This is simply the e-mail address of the person who created the content.
For most podcasters, this is the same in each <item> in the feed. But if you’re
making a compilation where you repurpose content created by others, you
may wish to put their e-mail address in here. The choice is yours.
<author>editor@mypodcast.com</author>
<enclosure> element
Chapter 2 provides a brief rundown of how the <enclosure> element makes
podcasting possible — but now (finally) we come to that sacred piece of
code. We hope you’re not too disappointed when you see how simple it is:
<enclosure url=”http://mypodcast.com/media/TGOP013_10312005.mp3”
length=”24849394” type=”audio/mpeg” />
Hardly seems worth the fuss, does it? Believe it or not, this is the main thing
that makes your podcasts automatically download to your listeners’ desk-
tops and MP3 players. The enclosure tag contains three elements:
 url: A link to the podcast media file.
 length: The length of the file. In this case, length is synonymous with
file size, expressed in bytes.
 type: The standard MIME type of the media file referenced in the link.
Podcasting works with a variety of media types. The example is for
audio files saved in MP3 format. You can enclose video files (and even
BitTorrent files), but to do that successfully, first you need to determine
the appropriate MIME type for your preferred media file.
<content:encoded> tag
Earlier we show you how to put your show notes in your feed by using the
<description> tag; this is just straight text, without any images, formatting,
190
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

or hyperlinks. The most correct way to include these extras is to use the
<content:encoded> tag.
Technically, the RSS 2.0 specifications allow you to place images, links, and
even text formatting inside the <description> tag. However, there is some
question as to how many of the podcatcher developers have allowed for that.
Be safe. Keep straight text in your <description> and use this new tag to
pass HTML.
You want good-quality show notes on your Web site and in your RSS feed —
complete with URLs that lead to the various Web sites. So it’s time to do
something special (okay, sneaky) to avoid breaking any XML laws.
XML is pretty picky about which characters are allowed and which ones
aren’t. After all, show notes are written to be read by a human being, not an
XML program — and human language just has a lot more stuff in it. If (for
example) you want to put in quotes, ampersands, apostrophes, and other
characters that are considered illegal inside XML, you have to use a Get Out
of Jail Free card in the form of this statement:
<![CDATA[]]>
The <![CDATA[]]> statement informs the XML reader that the contents con-
tained within the [ ] symbols are not XML and should not be treated as such.
Some older XML readers just skip such contents altogether. But every RSS
and XML reader we’ve seen switches over to HTML mode and displays the
information properly — links, images, and all. As it should be.
So if you really want your description to read: “‘There’s trouble & danger
ahead,’ said the Cap’n” — quirky, isn’t it? — you have two options:
XML-Encoded:
<description>&quot;&apos;There&apos;s trouble &amp; danger ahead&quot;, said the
Cap&apos;n&quot;</description>
Using CDATA:
<content:encoded><![CDATA[“‘There’s trouble & danger ahead’, said the
Cap’n”]]></content:encoded>
Now, which way are you going to choose? Both approaches give you the
same results. One probably gives you a headache.
You can go about escaping or encoding illegal characters inside your XML in
other ways. You can find more information about that in Syndicating Web Sites
with RSS Feeds For Dummies, or at
www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_encoding.asp
191
Chapter 9: Geeking Out on XML and RSS

For now, it’s easier to tell the XML reader to lighten up and deal with the text
as is.
<itunes:author> tag
You guessed it — yet another iTunes tag that looks amazingly like a standard
RSS 2.0 tag. Hey, we didn’t write the spec. We’re just telling you how to imple-
ment it.

The same rules apply here as did in the <channel> section. In this case, you
are describing a single episode of your show in both short and long versions,
respectively.

<itunes:summary> Show Notes Cabin Fever Outfitters is the company that booked
this trip. Can’t recommend them highly enough! I had a great time

<itunes:category> tags
Just as with the <channel> section, it’s important to get this right:
<itunes:category text=”International”>
<itunes:category text=”Canadian” />
</itunes:category>
<itunes:category text=”Sports” />
<itunes:duration> tag
Finally — something brand new with an iTunes-specific tag! Remember that
iTunes was originally a music distribution system. As such, the length of a
particular song displays next to the title. Podcasters too are asked to provide
this information. It follows the HH:MM:SS format.
If you use software to help build your file, you may not be able to figure out
the exact duration of your individual podcasts. iTunes has no way to verify
this data, so both of us have just been hard-coding a ballpark figure of our
average podcast length.
<itunes:duration>00:45:00</itunes:duration>
<itunes:explicit> tag
Here’s an implementation from iTunes that makes a lot of sense. If your pod-
cast normally doesn’t include any questionable language or subject matter, go
192
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

ahead and mark the channel with an explicit tag of no. However, if a particular
episode does get a little on the raunchy side, you can use this tag to mark just
the single episode.
Even if you know all your podcast episodes follow the same explicit label set
forth in the <channel>, you still need to include it here:
<itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit>
<itunes:keywords> tag
Adding one more layer of information about your show, iTunes allows you to
choose keywords that might pertain to your show. This can be very useful if
you cover a lot of ground in your podcasts and find it difficult to sum things
up in the <itunes:subtitle> tag.
Separate keywords by spaces and add in as many as you see fit:
<itunes:keywords>outdoors fishing Tebo salmon mountain biking</itunes:keywords>
Wrapping things up
As with any other markup language (and as indicated earlier in this chapter),
you have to close those declaration tags. The closing tag looks like this:
</item>
This tells the podcatching client that the end of the episode has been reached.
After you close your <item> tag, you can immediately add a second, and a
third, and so on. There is no limit to the number of <items> you can have
inside your RSS feed.
After you add all the episodes inside their own <item> </item> statement,
it’s time to finish the file:
</channel>
</rss>
These two lines of text bring to a close your <channel> declaration and mark
the end of the RSS 2.0 file itself.
You should have no further text after these two statements. This really is the
end of your file. If you have extra text hanging around after you close your
</rss> tag, delete it. Or better yet, figure out where you wanted to put it in
one of the elements listed here — and put it there.

Chapter 9: Geeking Out on XML and RSS

Tweaking the Contents
The main function of your RSS 2.0 file is to distribute your media files to the
various people who have subscribed to your feed. However, smart podcast-
ers recognize that a well-formed RSS feed can be employed for a wider range
of needs.
Making sure your episodes
don’t get skipped
Remember that subscribers to your feed have probably subscribed to other
feeds as well. As their time grows more precious — perhaps because some-
body subscribed to way too many feeds (who, us?) — they’re going to start
looking for clues from savvy podcasters to help them assign priorities to the
podcasts already downloaded on their systems and set up their listening day.
RSS feeds also work to promote your feed to people who are potential sub-
scribers. Various sites are now springing up to help podcast listeners find
potential podcasts. PodRazor (podrazor.com) is one such site. PodRazor
aggregates or combines RSS 2.0 feeds from as many podcasts as it can find
and uses them to populate its search engine. Searchers then type in their key-
words of choice, and PodRazer searches through thousands of podcast feeds
to find references to the entered keywords.
This process is much the same as that used by Google and Yahoo! so it wasn’t
a surprise when Yahoo! announced the capability to search through podcast
content. Google is probably not far behind. After all, searching is what they
do, and they are well aware of podcasting and its potential for growth.
Adding descriptive keywords
While all the elements of a well-formed RSS 2.0 file are important, it’s the
<title> and the <description> content that are the most useful for 
listeners — be they current or potential. As a podcaster, your job is to 
create descriptions and titles that are both relevant to your content and
intriguing to your listening audience.
As discussed in Chapter 8, keywords are important. Rather than making stuff
up again, this time we use real-world examples to illustrate the point. One of
your humble authors hosts several science-fiction-related podcasts. One of the
shows features interviews with authors who create the popular science-fiction
novels and short stories of today. Another show deals almost exclusively with
science-fiction television and movies; yet another has loose ties with sci-fi but
is really more about . . . well, whatever fits the podcaster’s mood.
194
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

Understanding that each of these shows appeals to a completely different
audience, the podcaster employs very different strategies when providing
information about these shows. But as different as these strategies are, they
follow a similar theme: Tell listeners what they want to hear.
No, we’re not suggesting you lie or stretch the truth about the content of
your podcasts. Instead, practice thinking like a listener. What do you think 
listeners want to hear? Then consider why you did this episode in the first
place: Who would be interested in listening, and why? After you figure all that
out, it’s time to start writing descriptive keywords, and adding them to your
<title> and <description> declarations.
Whether or not you heard it here first, the ability to change the contents of
your RSS file is critical to your success as a podcaster. Before you select a
hosting company or blogging software that manages your RSS 2.0 file for you,
ask some important questions about modifying that file. (By and large, we’d
say take a pass on companies that don’t allow do-it-yourself changes to your
RSS 2.0 file or template.)
Making Newcomers Feel Welcome
Think back to when you were a new podcast listener or, perhaps, consider
the last time you added a podcast to your podcatching client. Did you know
what you were getting yourself into? Perhaps someone recommended the
show to you, and you already had a feel for what it was you could expect.
But maybe not.
For a lot of new people just starting out as podcast listeners, there is a large
gulf of uncertainty and concern they have to get over before subscribing to a
new podcast. By subscribing to your feed, a listener is putting a significant
amount of trust in you, the podcaster. Don’t forget that podcasting means
your subscribers automatically receive any and all podcast media files you
make available, regardless of what’s in them or how big they are.
How large will these files be? How often will they be coming down? What
can I expect out of the content? Can I listen in front of my kids? Will the file
size overload my hard drive?
These and a slew of other questions invade the mind of every person think-
ing about taking the plunge and subscribing to your podcast. And these 
concerns stay on the minds of those who bit the bullet and subscribed
for at least the first few weeks. Your job, then, is to find ways to make
those listeners feel comfortable so they keep listening. Stay tuned (as it
were . . .)

Chapter 9: Geeking Out on XML and RSS

Creating an introductory podcast
Congratulations. Either by way of your skilled listings in directories and list-
ing sites (see Chapter 10) or from your incredibly good karma, a new listener
has just subscribed to your feed and is about to receive a first-ever podcast
media file from you.
Hold that thought a minute. Do you really want the most recent episode to be
the first thing this new listener hears? Depending on the format of your show,
that may not be the best doorway into the world of your podcast. It’s like a new
reader just discovering an author for the first time, with one big difference: In
this case, the “author” releases the work one chapter at a time — and what if
you (as an author) are currently on Chapter 12 of the saga?
Chapter 12 may not be the best place to start your podcast; a new listener
may not have enough information to get the most out of it. Many podcasts
seem to work in this “previously on . . .” format, where they grow comfortable
with their listeners, assuming the listeners have been following along for
some time. No knock there, just fact; personal attachment comes with pod-
casting, and it’s one goal that many podcasters wish to achieve. We have no
desire to see that involvement halt. But how is a new listener to catch up?
Rather than changing the format of your show, consider including an intro-
ductory episode to your podcast in your RSS 2.0 file. As of this writing, only a
handful of podcasters employ this method of offering a guiding hand to new
subscribers. (Look for that to change soon.)
Making this introductory podcast is simple. It looks like this:
1. Record your welcome message.
Don’t make this a major production; try to keep it short (ideally under
3 minutes). Discuss the major themes you cover on your show and why
you do what you do. If you need to give listeners any warnings, this is
the time and place to do it. Also, discuss how frequently you put out
new episodes and what time length you try to hit for your show. And of
course, give out your Web site address, e-mail, and any other contact
information. Even though listeners may not write that information down,
it shows you’re happy to get feedback from your audience.
2. Tag and upload this show as “Episode 000.”
You want to properly ID3-tag everything you put up for download, and
naming the show “000” or something similar sets it apart from your
normal episode rotation. This practice is critical for your current sub-
scribers because they’re going to get this welcome message too.
196
Part III: So You’ve Got This Great Recording of Your Voice. Now What? 

3. Create a static <item> in your RSS 2.0 feed as the first one in the list.
If you’re using your blog or hosting provider to create your RSS 2.0 on
the fly as you make new entries, you want to hard-code this item (type it
in by hand) right above your dynamic code. Use the sample code from
earlier in this chapter and modify the <item> elements as appropriate.
4. Resave your RSS 2.0 template and rebuild if necessary.
Your new RSS 2.0 file should now contain the introductory <item> tag as
a static element, always appearing ahead of your dynamic entries.
Understanding how it works
Because the <guid> tag is new, any podcatchers that check your RSS 2.0 
file for updates automatically download the new introductory media files.
Previous subscribers get the file as well. Some may listen, but most will trash
the intro files — it doesn’t matter, though. The new listeners are the ones
you’re especially interested in, and you’ve just given them a good understand-
ing of what your podcast is about. With luck, your introduction fits with their
assumptions of what your show was about, and they continue to subscribe.
And if they don’t? No problem. You don’t want to be wasting valuable (and
expensive) bandwidth on an audience who isn’t listening to your show.
“But won’t they keep downloading the same file?” No, they won’t — not if
their podcatching client is doing its job right. The <guid> tag works to tell
podcatching clients what’s been downloaded already and what’s brand new.
After a file has been downloaded, the podcatching client ignores that file
(assuming the <guid> and sometimes the <pubDate> don’t change). The
next day (or the next time the listener has the podcatching client check for
new stuff) the intro cast is skipped over, and the next file(s) on the list is
downloaded, never missing a beat!
Multiple-Show File Strategies
Some of you out there will catch the podcasting bug hard. It’s so easy to
create a podcast, you’ll want to do more. Soon you may find yourself doing
three shows a week, each with slightly different content and topics, each
appealing to a different audience.
You begin to hear from your listeners that Monday’s show is right up their
alley, but Wednesday’s coverage of different material isn’t their cup of tea.
You get plenty of e-mail and voice mail with the opposite viewpoint, and a
good many listeners say they love everything you’re doing. How can you
make all these people happy? Simple. Multiple feeds. 
197
Chapter 9: Geeking Out on XML and RSS

Slacker Astronomy (slackerastronomy.com) is a great example. It didn’t take
long for the creators of this podcast to branch out into two different formats.
Once a week, they create a podcast where they talk to the audience about
something new and exciting from the world of astronomy. They make it funny
and entertaining for anyone with even a passing interest in heavenly bodies. 
Early on, the creators attempted to do interviews on the show. However,
interviews tend to vary in length — and that’s tricky to fit into a regular
format. They started editing their interviews, using them as sound bites for
their show. That worked at first, but the creators weren’t satisfied for long.
They had these long and interesting conversations with astronomers that
just didn’t feel right edited down to 45-second sound bites. But they also
knew that shooting the cosmic breeze with an astronomer would be enter-
taining to a much smaller audience than their produced show.
The solution was simple: Produce two different feeds for the two different
types of shows. Their main feed still contains their weekly show. The second
feed, ingeniously titled Slacker Astronomy Extra, contains the occasional inter-
view, planning sessions, and a variety of other audio content that doesn’t fit the
bill of the main feed — or that the creators deem less appetizing to their gen-
eral audience but still worth putting out there. The hosts of Slacker Astronomy
cross-promote each feed; they mention to the listening audience of one feed
the current things happening on the other. The choice is now in the hands of
the listener. Subscribe to one or both?
When you’ve figured out how to customize your feed, it should be easy to
break out a second (or third) feed, isolating the content as appropriate. You
need to check the documentation of your blogging software or RSS-generation
tool to see what steps are necessary.

Chapter 10
Of Pings and Directories
In This Chapter
 Publicizing your podcast
 Sending pings to directories and listing sites
 Drawing in listeners from directories
I
t’s time to tell the world about you and your podcast — in other words,
generate some publicity. Luckily for you, the podcast audience is typically
pretty Internet-savvy, or at least has a broadband Internet connection, so you
don’t have to mail postcards, look for splashy photo-ops, or hire a personal
consultant to keep track of your social calendar.
In the world of podcasting, publicity means notifying various listing sites and
directories when you have new content available. Sometimes you can send
the notification automatically (we call that a ping); other times notification
requires some individual effort on your part. It’s worth the effort; listing sites
and directories are both critical to building your audience of listeners and
keeping that audience engaged — and subscribed. This chapter gets you
started using the available tools and offers tips for keeping the process
simple and making sure your podcast gets noticed.
Publicizing Your Podcast
Though it may not be intuitive at first glance, three parties are involved in the
“podcasting publicity triangle”:
 You, the podcaster
 Potential listeners
 Directories or listing sites that list podcasts

Just like most Web searchers, potential podcast listeners are looking for fresh
and recently updated podcasts. So this section shows you how to notify those
directories and listing sites — and in turn, your potential listeners — not only
that your podcast exists, but that you have fresh new content available for
their listening pleasure.
Directories and listing sites explained
Directories and listing sites serve an essential purpose: They attract new listen-
ers to your podcast. But each of them approaches the task in different ways:
 Directories: These Web sites keep a comprehensive database of pod-
casts. Podcast Alley (www.podcastalley.com) and Podcast Pickle
(podcastpickle.com), for example, both employ an easy-to-use inter-
face that allows potential listeners to browse through various categories
of interest — as well as do searches on topics, interests, or podcast
names.
 Listing sites: These Web sites — such as audio.weblogs.com or 
technorati.com — show the most recently updated podcasts or allow
episode-specific searches. Listing sites generally lack the structure of a
directory, and usually don’t combine together podcasts into easy-to-
browse categories. One listing service, Podscope (podscope.com), 
actually provides a way to search within the audio content of individual
podcast episodes.
Some listeners prefer the categorization of directories; others favor the person-
alization of a listing site. Your job as a podcaster is to use both types of sites
in the most effective way to bring potential listeners to your podcast.
Pinging for publicity
Pings are sent out by podcasters (or their corresponding Web sites) and are
picked up by listing sites and/or directories. Think of the ping as working like
a sonar blip from a submarine, and the listing site or directory as the receiv-
ing sonar operator. Pings are quite insubstantial, carrying a minimal amount
of data to the directory or site listing in question. 
When you ping a site, you’re telling the computer or program that runs the
recipient’s site that you have something new to offer and that the listing site
or directory should update its listing for your podcast. Sometimes this is han-
dled by the information contained in the ping itself. If not, the receiving site
may launch an agent or robot to investigate your Web site to discover what
information needs to be updated.
202
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

You can only ping directories and listing sites that are designed to accept
pings. It won’t do you any good to send a ping to your local congressman
or friendly media conglomerate unless the site has a directory specifically
designed to accept pings. That’s because pings update such directories and
listing sites, which are in turn visited by potential listeners seeking your new
or fresh content.
By themselves, pings won’t do much to get you new listeners. But when pings
work in concert with directories or other online listing services, they can be
an invaluable way to let potential listeners know you exist.
Sending Pings to Directories
and Listing Sites
The best way to send pings is automatically; you may even be able to ping a
whole list of sites at once. But if the software you use to power your podcast
doesn’t enable you to send out automatic pings, you can still do it manually,
which is a bit more time-consuming but gets the message out nonetheless.
The following sections help you decide which sites to ping and how to set up
the process with the various podcasting software available.
Choosing which sites to ping
Legions of listing sites and directories accept podcasters’ pings. For now,
here’s a list of places Evo pings every time he has an update for his podcasts
or blogs:
 rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping
 www.rpc.weblogs.com/RPC2
 ping.blo.gs/
 api.my.yahoo.com/RPC2

Chapter 10: Of Pings and Directories

Technology changes at an ever-increasing pace, so it’s highly likely that some
sites we’ve mentioned have been modified since the printing of this book.
Others will have been abandoned by their creators, and still more will have
been created. Spend some time searching for places to ping — and consider
joining a podcasting community (real or virtual) where you can ask others
about the listing sites and directories they ping.
Totally automatic pings
Most blogging software supports automatic pinging of sites. (In fact, Movable
Type comes preconfigured to ping many popular listing services and directo-
ries.) If you’re using blogging software to maintain your RSS feed (Chapter 9)
and/or show notes (Chapter 8), you can probably set it up to ping.
You’ll want to set up your site to ping relevant sites every time you have a
fresh podcast available. If you use show notes (which we highly recommend
in Chapter 8) to accompany your podcasts, you’ll want to set up your system
to send out pings whenever you publish these notes. (We get to all that in a
minute.)
If you don’t use show notes, but still use a blog post to update your RSS 2.0
feed with the <enclosure> tag (see Chapter 9), the same process should
apply. As a rule, you want to ping whenever you post and update.
When you update your blog, lots of moving parts come together, including the
sending out of pings. Here’s some of the automatic brouhaha that goes on:
 Text and links from the post are entered into the database.
 Templates assemble relevant database entries.
 Web pages are rebuilt to update all content with the information from
the templates.
 Archives are created/updated.
 Pings are initiated.
To make sure your blogging software is set up to ping, look inside your config-
uration settings. Here’s how to do that in some of the more popular programs:
 Movable Type: Choose Main Menu➪the name of your podcast➪
Configuration➪Preferences. Then, on the Preferences screen, click the
Publicity/Remote Interfaces/TrackBack link (shown in Figure 10-1).
 Blogger: You can find your configuration settings by choosing Settings➪
Publishing, as shown in Figure 10-2. Note that as of this writing, Blogger
is set up to ping only weblogs.com, which isn’t much publicity but it’s
still better than nothing.
204
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

 Libsyn: This basic blogging/hosting provider specifically for podcasters
is only moderately better than Blogger. You can configure settings by
choosing Blog Settings➪Advanced Settings➪Auto-ping, as shown in
Figure 10-3. Note that it’s set to ping only audio.weblogs.com. (That’s
as of this writing; it may be upgraded when a new release comes out.)
 TypePad: This program allows you to set up customized pings, but it
really puts you through the paces to find it. It’s buried in Create a
Post➪Customize the Display of This Page➪Post Screen Configuration➪
Custom➪Trackback URLs to Ping.
Pings are sometimes called trackbacks, although technically (and strictly) a
trackback is a different communications protocol used when someone men-
tions your post on his or her blog or Web site. But the concept is pretty darn
close, and we’re not splitting hairs over it.

Chapter 10: Of Pings and Directories

Be sure to follow the instructions for your particular interface for typing 
multiple ping destinations. Sometimes a hard carriage return (the Enter key)
is required, sometimes they can be joined by a comma. Like we said, pay
attention.
Pinging manually (if you must)
If you don’t use a blog to run your site or your software of choice doesn’t
allow either automation or customization of pings, you’re stuck with the
method employed by the pioneers: manual pinging.
Most sites that accept pings have a form to fill out when you have fresh content
available. Simple. Painless. But repetitive. Also necessary if you can’t automate.
Although the process differs for each site, here are the basic steps you follow:
1. Go to the site that you want to ping and find the page where the ping
form is contained.
Make a custom set of bookmarks in your browser to keep track of all the
places you need to ping. That way you shave off as much time as possible
when you make your posts.

206
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

2. Fill out the form.
Although each site has a slightly different form, most require the same
information. You need the URL of your RSS 2.0 feed at a minimum.
You might want to copy the URL of your podcast feed (by pressing Ctrl+C
or Ú+C) so you have it ready to drop into those forms. All these sites
require it, and if you’re likely to mistype something, this will be it. Just
don’t copy anything else to the Clipboard as long as you need that URL.
3. Click Submit when you’re done.
Most directories and listing sites validate all manual pings before updating
the podcast listings on their pages. This helps cut down on errors displayed
on their sites — and discourages spammers from sending out pings when
nothing on a podcast has been updated. If the directory can’t find your pod-
cast feed because you’ve misspelled the URL or nothing in your podcast feed
is new, then the directory or listing site invalidates your ping and doesn’t
update your listing. So be careful to spell (and type) the URL of your feed cor-
rectly. And (oh yeah) make sure you have something new in your RSS feed
before you send out a manual ping.
You’ll see various flavors of forms as you go about this process. Figure 10-4
shows the form on audio.weblogs.com, the granddaddy of them all.
Figure 10-4:

207
Chapter 10: Of Pings and Directories

Technorati.com has an even simpler ping form, shown in Figure 10-5. Your
RSS 2.0 feed should have a <title> listed in the <channel> declaration
already, so Technorati pulls the information from there instead of having
you type it. (If <title> and <channel> seem like a foreign language to you,
head to Chapter 9 for the lowdown on using these tags.)
Drawing In Listeners from Directories
Some directories get their information from pings to various sites around the
Internet. Many others periodically check your feed to see whether you have
any new podcasts to distribute. Regardless of which method a particular
directory employs, first you have to let the directory know your site exists
(well, yeah) and then do some basic maintenance on your listing from time to
time. The following sections explain how to find directories, list your pod-
cast, and keep your listing up to date.

Targeting your audience: Large or small?
Directories of all shapes and sizes, from uber-giants DMOZ and Yahoo! to a
small sports-only podcast directory, make up the current landscape. When
considering your approach to getting listed on various directories, think
about your goals and why you want to be listed.
Podcasting is narrowcasting — which is distinctly different from broadcasting.
A radio station’s livelihood depends on sending (some might say shoving) its
message to the widest possible segment of the population. That’s why radio
stations invest in taller towers, buy bigger transmitters, and put up billboards
over town — the more listeners they get, the more money they can make
from advertising.
Podcasting is somewhat different. In our world, the more listeners you get,
the bigger the drain on your resources and bandwidth. We’re not saying that’s
a bad thing. But understand that the amount of money and resources neces-
sary to maintain a subscriber base of 100,000 would break most of us, at least
with the current technology we employ.
So rather than go after the biggest number of listeners, podcasters are better
served by going after the biggest number of targeted listeners. You really
want only interested people listening to your show as “their” show. Sure,
broadcasters may say the same thing, but they might accept a fickle audience
as long as it’s huge (and tunes in enough to buy the sponsors’ stuff). After all,
listening to a radio program is as easy as clicking a button or turning a dial.
(If only podcasting were that easy . . . well, maybe someday. . . .)
Finding the latest and greatest directories
New directories are popping up quicker than acne on a 14-year-old choco-
holic, but with happier results: The creators of these directories have a
vested interest in getting the word out to the podcasting community.
Because podcasting is an online thing, the community of podcasters tends to
be an online thing, too. Various mailing lists, discussion boards (forums), and
even podcasts exist for the exclusive reason of bringing the latest news and
information about podcasting. To keep up on the latest happenings in the
podcasting world — including the latest directories — we suggest subscrib-
ing to some of the resources listed in Table 10-1.

Listing your podcast with directories
As of this writing, most directories are edited and controlled by sophisticated
wetware interfaces that come with their own inboard power systems, fuzzy-
logic and synaptic processors, and tend to have a penchant for chocolate-
coated goodies. (What’s with the chocolate references?) We call them human
beings, and they sit between you and your goal of getting listed in a directory.
Each directory has its own submission guidelines and processes. This early
in the game, directories are happy to take as many submissions as they can
get. But as podcasting grows in popularity, you can bet that many directories
will become quite picky about adding in new podcasts.
Getting your podcast listed may be as simple as sending an e-mail to the
editor of the directory. Others ask you to fill out an online form. Here’s an
example of one form-based submission you’ll want to do right away: Podcast
Alley. Take the tips and tricks you find out here and apply them to any other
directory you decide to seek a listing from.

Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

Follow these steps to submit your feed to Podcast Alley:
1. In the upper-left corner of Podcast Alley’s homepage (www.
podcastalley.com), click the Add Your Podcast link.
Directory editors spend a fair amount of time cleaning up duplicate
entries and deleting incorrect submissions. Please search the directory
to make sure your podcast isn’t already listed, and double-check your
entries for accuracy before submitting the form.
2. Enter the name of your podcast feed in the Title of Podcast box, as
shown in Figure 10-6.
This is likely the same name you’re using in your <title> feed in your
RSS feed. If not, think of a good reason why. Or go back and change your
title. Normally the two should match.
3. In the Podcast Web site box, enter the URL of your Web site — not
your RSS feed link, but the main Web site that houses your podcast.
This enables visitors to Podcast Alley to check out your Web site before
(or after) they subscribe.
Figure 10-6:

Alley.

Chapter 10: Of Pings and Directories

4. Enter the link to your RSS 2.0 feed in the Podcast Feed Link box.
Though we’ve said it before, it bears repeating: Double-check your link
for accuracy! The folks at Podcast Alley aren’t going to check your typing,
and you don’t want to send links off to the void, do you?
5. Enter the description of your podcast.
This is the area where a lot of new podcasters struggle. When writing
your description, write for impact! Identify the key concepts your show
is about — and write to them. You’ve got a limited amount of space to
get your point across, so be careful of tossing in extraneous words that
add more fluff than substance.
6. Enter your e-mail address.
This is useful in the event there are errors in the submission process, or
so you can be notified when your show is listed. And when you get that
e-mail, go back and make sure everything is correct!
7. Enter relevant keywords.
Not every directory allows this, but if yours does, take advantage of it.
Just as you picked out the key concepts before, identify relevant key-
words that people are likely to search on, and that you’d like to use to
promote your podcast. Yes, “Barbie” is likely a popular search term,
but if your podcast is about cooking mealworms for fun and profit, you
don’t want to target the audience that’s likely searching on “Barbie.”
The searcher will be (at least) disappointed that your podcast isn’t
about Barbie, and you’ll have just wasted precious (and expensive)
bandwidth on a one-time listener you didn’t really much want to attract
in the first place.
8. From the Pick a Genre drop-down list, select an appropriate genre for
your podcast.
In our opinion, this is the single biggest problem with directories: Genres
are either too broad or too specific. And in most cases, you can only
select one. So for now, grab the one you think comes closest to classify-
ing your site (and pretend you didn’t just get shoved into a box that
doesn’t quite fit).
9. Hit the Submit Podcast button, and you’re in business.
That’s it! Expect an e-mail in a few hours/days/weeks when your podcast
has been listed. Remember that it’s a good idea to return to Podcast
Alley and check for any mistakes or omissions. If you find some, follow
the instructions on the site to have them corrected.
212
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

Keeping your listing relevant
Every month or so (sometimes more, sometimes less), it’s a good idea to
revisit directories where you’re listed and make sure the content displayed
matches what you’re doing. To give you an idea of what to look for, here
are some reasons you might need to change your listing (or perhaps your 
categorization):
 You’ve expanded the focus of your podcast. For example, you started
a podcast about fishing boats, but have now branched out to cover 
environmental concerns for lakes, streams, and waterways.
 You’ve added a regular co-host to your show and would like to include
that person in your description.
 Your podcast has moved to a new server, and your RSS 2.0 feed has a 
different address.
 The directories have changed the way they handle your listing (this
does happen). For example, perhaps your fishing-boat show was listed
under Recreation, but now the directory has created a specific Fishing
subcategory. Does your show belong there instead?
Make a set of bookmarks just for your directory listings. Then, when you pay
your monthly visit to each of the sites, you’ll have them all handy in your
bookmark list.

Chapter 11
Speaking Directly to Your Peeps
In This Chapter
 Encouraging listener feedback
 Finding conversations on the Web
 Handling listener feedback
C
ommunication can be defined in a multitude of overly complex ways. For
the sake of argument (and not to copy each and every dictionary entry
we can find), we’ll define the term as
The exchange of information between two points.
Note that last part — between two points. To us, this implies a bi-directional
flow of information, to and from both parties.
If you’ve had the pleasure (note how well we can say that with a straight face)
of attending any productivity or team-building seminars, the presenters really
drive the message home: Effective communication is not a one-way street.
Here is one place where podcasting has a huge advantage over traditional
forms of media. Radio and television, by and large, are one-way forms of
information transfer. The show host talks, and you listen. Live radio (and a
handful of TV shows) changes that paradigm, allowing listeners to call in to
the show and be a part of it.
True communication is much easier for the podcaster than the traditional
media producer. In the short time podcasting has been around, podcasters
with experience in traditional broadcasting are reporting greater levels of
interaction with their audiences, in a much more immediate fashion with
greater quality of feedback. Chalk one more up to the podcasters — and the
podcatchers.
In this chapter, we show you some real-world examples of how to foster 
communication between you and your audience, touching on a variety of
methods and locations you probably haven’t considered.

Gathering Listener Feedback
It must be a natural human emotion to fear the opinions of others. Perhaps
it’s insecurity, but we think it has more to do with our culture’s constant rein-
forcement of the “How are you?” — “I’m fine. You?” — “Fine.” meaningless
chatter that precedes most of our conversations.
But something happens to that cultural crutch when it comes to podcasting.
Listeners, for whatever reason, are compelled to actually give real and 
meaningful criticism. And podcasters, for the most part, take to heart those
responses.
Of course, we’re speaking in general terms. Yes, there are flamers and jerks
out there with less than helpful answers at the ready. Podcasting can’t change
basic human nature for the ill-evolved, unfortunately.
Fostering good communication with your listening audience should be
approached in a multitude of ways, such as
 Comments on your blog
 Online discussion groups
 Forums
The savvy podcaster is constantly on the lookout for additional methods of
communication occurring outside his immediate control, such as forums,
chat rooms, discussion boards, and mailing lists. All of these avenues are dis-
cussed in detail in the sections that follow.
Comments on Your Blog
In an ideal world, all communication, feedback, rants, and raves about your
show would take place in a neat little box, keeping things nice and tidy for
you. But because that won’t happen, your best bet is to build a Web site that
both enables and encourages the communication in your own backyard.
In Chapters 8 and 9, we demonstrate how much simpler adding show notes
and generating RSS files is for those podcasters who use blogging software,
rather than those who try to do everything by hand. Well, here’s one more
feather in the cap of Movable Type, WordPress, and even Blogger: Feedback
mechanisms come pre-installed.
If you’re already using a blog, you usually don’t have to do anything special
to turn on the “talk back to me” feature. In fact, it’s a royal pain to make your
blog not accept comments from the outside world. So relax.
216
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

In the world of blogs, this feedback mechanism is referred to as comments.
Visit just about any blog you can find, read a post, and you’re likely to find a
small Comments link at the bottom. Figure 11-1 shows one example, though
the treatment varies widely from site to site.
Podcasters use comments to gather feedback from their listeners about spe-
cific shows. Hence, comments are closely tied with show notes (you can find
more on show notes in Chapter 8) about a particular episode.
Some podcasters get dozens of responses per episode; some get none. While
there is some relation to the size of your listening audience and the number
of comments you’re likely to receive, it really has more to do with the connec-
tion users feel they have with your podcast.
There’s an added benefit to enabling feedback about your episodes directly
on your Web site: Communication develops amongst the listening community
itself. Rather than talking to you, they start talking to each other, and the con-
versation takes on a life of its own. If this happens to you, don’t fret over it;
encourage it! Much like two co-workers chatting about last night’s The Daily
Show with Jon Stewart, two or more listeners using your Web site to talk to
each other about your show speaks to the attachment they feel to what you
have to say (or play).
Figure 11-1:

217
Chapter 11: Speaking Directly to Your Peeps

We recognize that not every podcaster is a blogger, and the technical require-
ments to install comment software on non-blog Web sites is well beyond the
scope of this book. Fortunately for us, people have been using the Web to talk
about the things they love (and hate) for much longer than blogs have been
popular.
Online Discussion Groups
Community forums, groups, and discussion lists allow for easy virtual commu-
nity building, enabling disparate people to share their thoughts and opinions
on a wide variety of subjects. A podcaster can find many free services that
help create places where listeners can post, share, and discuss their thoughts
and ideas online.
As easy as it is to create places for these types of conversations to occur, it’s
likely that someone else has already done it. Spend some quality time searching
the Internet for your name and your show. Maybe a devoted fan has already
done the not-so-heavy lifting for you.
While the number of free online discussion groups is legion, we’ve decided to
focus on two of the larger offerings: Yahoo! Groups and Google Groups. Both
are free to join and free to create, but both are supported by various forms of
advertising. There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch, as Heinlein said.
Yahoo! Groups
Yahoo! Groups has the distinction of being one of the oldest and most widely
used free discussion groups on the Net. While it may not have been first on
the block, it has stood the test of time, and many consider it the 800-pound
gorilla on the block. Yahoo! Groups also boasts of a huge user group, which
could help your fledgling group swell in size rapidly.
Setting up a group is quick and easy; just follow these steps:
1. Log in to Yahoo! Groups at groups.yahoo.com.
If you already have an account, enter your Yahoo! ID and password.
If you don’t have a Yahoo! ID yet, click the Sign Up link and follow the
simple instructions to get your free Yahoo! account.
2. To start a new group, click the Start a Group Now link in the middle
of the page.
If you’re returning to Yahoo! Groups, you’ll find a list of all the groups
you’ve either created or belong to on the left side of the page.
218
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

3. Select the appropriate category and subcategory for your group. Then
click the Place My Group Here button.
As you select categories, you will likely be presented with subcategories
to refine your group’s placement. Continue selecting links until you’ve
found the appropriate categorization for your group.
4. Enter the appropriate information in the Group Name, Group Email
Address, and Describe Your Group text boxes. When you’re finished,
click Continue.
See Figure 11-2 for an example of a page that’s been filled out.
The Group Email address is the e-mail address members of your group
will use to send messages to the entire group. You get to make up the
name of this e-mail address, though we suggest making it something
simple and easy to remember. Acronyms are a good idea here, as are any
abbreviations or secret words that your group members are likely to
remember.
5. Select which Yahoo! Profile and Email Address you want to be associ-
ated with this group.
Because you’re setting up the group, you will be the Owner (which gives
you phenomenal cosmic powers like kicking people out if they get out
of line). If you have multiple Yahoo! IDs, you need to associate only one of
those with this group. And if you have more than one e-mail address, the
interface needs to know where to send the mail.
Figure 11-2:
Yahoo!
Groups
allows you
to describe
your group
with a little
text, or a lot.
219
Chapter 11: Speaking Directly to Your Peeps

6. In the Word Verification text box, type the letters that are displayed in
the accompanying image.
Yahoo! Groups asks you to type the letters to help prevent e-mail spam —
which is a good thing, right? Oh, and it’s case-sensitive, so make sure you
use capital letters where appropriate.
7. When you’re done, click Continue.
That’s it! You’ve just created your group.
From here, you can set how much control and flexibility you wish to have over
the group, as well as the ease at which others can join. Yahoo! leaves some
things pretty open, yet locks down others. Be sure to follow the Customize
Your Group link to make sure that the settings are to your liking. If not,
change them!
When you’re happy with your group, click the Invite People to Join link, and
tell everyone you know about your new group. Well, maybe not everyone. But
you should tell the folks who might be interested.
Most people don’t “request” invitations. An invitation is something you send
out to notify people about an event or new service, in this case your Yahoo!
group. Sending an invitation to one or 1,000 people is likely an unsolicited
e-mail. Chances are, recipients are not expecting this mail from you. That
makes it look suspiciously like spam, and people are likely to just delete it.
When you send out your invitations, don’t send them to folks you don’t know
and make sure the mail is personal enough to let them know the message is
not spam from some faceless person.
Google Groups
Not to be outdone, Google has recently released a service similar to Yahoo!
Groups. Google is quickly becoming the dominant player in many online initia-
tives after its successful Gmail launch in early 2004. While Google Groups is
currently in beta (which means it may not be fully functional), it’s promising
to be a fine product. Here’s how to create a Google group:
1. Sign in to your Google account at groups.google.com.
If you’re already registered with Google, enter the e-mail address and
password already registered with Google.
If you don’t have a Google account, the sign-up process is free and easy.
2. Click Create a New Group on the left side of the screen.
Remember that Google Groups is currently in beta, and the position of
elements on the screen may change in future releases. The wording of the
link may change as well, but it should always be something easy to find
and recognize.
220
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

3. In the corresponding text boxes, type the Group Name, Group E-mail
Address, and Group Description.
The group e-mail address is the e-mail address members of your group
will use to send messages to the entire group. Google helps by suggesting
an e-mail address based on the name of your group. You can change the
e-mail name if you’re not happy with it.
4. Set the Access Level for your group.
If you want the maximum usage of your group, select the Public level. Of
course, you may have reasons to select a more restrictive access level,
and we’re certainly not going to stand in your way.
5. Click the Create My Group button.
You’ve now created your group and are all set to invite new members.
Google Groups makes this an integral step in the creation of the group,
whereas Yahoo! Groups makes it more of an option.
6. In the large text box at the top of the page, enter the e-mail addresses
of the people you’d like to have in your group. Then select the Add or
Invite option button, depending on what action you want to take.
It’s a better idea to invite people than to automatically add them to your
new group.
If you choose to automatically add the member to your group, e-mail
messages from group members will show up unannounced in the recipi-
ent’s mailbox, unless you told them to expect it. That’s spam, pure and
simple. Unless you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the person you
intend to add wants to be a member of your group, invite that person
instead. That gives them the option to join or not, and makes you a better
netizen.
7. Select a subscription type and write a welcome message. When you’re
finished, click Done.
The default subscription type is to have e-mail sent individually to mem-
bers that have joined your group. We suggest leaving this setting right
where it is and allowing the members to change their own personal pref-
erence at their discretion. Some prefer the Digest Form option, and some
prefer No E-mail at all. Leave it up to them.
Publicizing your group
After you create your online discussion group and send out your initial 
invitations, it’s time to spread the word! In Chapter 12, we go into a longer
conversation about publicizing you, your podcast, and everything you do to
support that. But for now, here are a few tips on how to increase membership
in your newly formed discussion group:
221
Chapter 11: Speaking Directly to Your Peeps

 Publish the group information on your Web site. Log in to your Google
or Yahoo! account to find the URL for your group home page and/or
your subscription e-mail address. Post this information prominently
on your podcast’s Web site.
 Add the group information to your signature line on outbound
e-mails. Let each e-mail you send out act as a mini-advertisement for
your discussion group. Provide a link to the home page as well as the
subscription e-mail address.
 Promote the group on your podcast. Find time to mention the group on
each episode of your podcast. Don’t make an entire show about why you
should join the group, but do talk about the ability to have stimulating
conversations with other listeners as well as yourself.
Focusing on Online Forums
For all their usefulness, discussion groups have their shortcomings, especially
when the topic of your show is complicated and multifaceted. This is com-
pounded by the time-shifting nature of podcasting, causing your listeners to
be a week or more behind schedule from one another. How are you going to
handle conversations that span timelines and topics? We suggest giving forums
a shot.
An online forum allows individuals to post their thoughts and ideas on a variety
of topics — at their own choosing. Through a concept known as threading,
multiple discussions can exist independently of all the others. Topics can get
buried quickly in a mailing list like those mentioned in the previous section.
Forums work differently, keeping all threads and topics available for clutter-
free commenting at any time.
Finding free, hosted forums
Many pre-configured forum hosting sites exist, but Delphi has been around
for about as long as any of them. Delphi makes it easy to create new forums
and attract new members. Just follow these steps:
1. Log in at www.delphiforums.com.
If you have a Delphi account, enter your username and password.
If you don’t have an account, it’s a simple matter to create a free account
with not much more than an e-mail address.
222
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

2. Click the Create a New Forum link in the upper-left corner of the page.
Delphi may show you a list of forums you might be interested in. How
the Delphi folks know this is beyond us. Do your best to ignore it and
look for the Create a New Forum link instead.
3. Enter the details of your free forum.
You’ll provide simple things, such as the name, description, and keywords
of your free forum.
We suggest making your Webtag (the end of the URL that Delphi will build
for you, like http://forums.delphiforums.com/akfishing) something
short and relevant to your podcast. Abbreviations or acronyms would
work well here. Also, don’t neglect to add keywords to the Keywords sec-
tion; completing it will help guide current Delphi members to your newly
created forum when they search for it.
4. Confirm your entries and then click the Continue button.
Check for typos and other errors before you click Continue.
5. Edit your welcome message and send out invitations.
Delphi provides a pre-packaged script for you to send to interested
people. You can leave it as is or rewrite it entirely, depending on your
needs.
Again, we raise the issue of how invitations might be seen as spam to
some. If you missed that discussion, check out the “Yahoo! Groups” 
section, earlier in the chapter.
That’s it! You can now customize your forum, start new posts, and spread the
word about your newly created forum. Much like discussion groups, you can
promote your forum by
 Posting the address on your Web site
 Adding the address to your e-mail signature line
 Mentioning the forum on each of your podcast episodes
Like discussion groups, forums take some time to build steam. Be persistent,
post every day, and constantly encourage your listeners to interact with you
and your podcast in this manner. But above all, be patient!
Purchasing software to take
more control of your forum
After a time, you may find yourself wishing for more control of your lively
forum. Perhaps you’d like to implement the look and feel (branding) of your
Web site on the forum, eliminate the advertisements you get with the free 
223
Chapter 11: Speaking Directly to Your Peeps

service, or more tightly integrate your forum into your overall Web presence.
When that happens, it’s time to think about installing some forum software
on your Web site.
Here we go with the tech stuff again. We’re not going to go into great detail on
how to install and configure forum software on your Web server. Hey, if we
sidestepped the whole “Install comments on your blog” issue, there’s no way
we’re going to open this can of worms. But we will give you some things to
think about when wrestling with the decision of using free forum software or
dropping some cash on one you can purchase.
There’s the old saying: Why should I pay for the cow when I get the milk for
free? Choosing between a free or paid solution depends on many factors, at
the top of which are your level of technical prowess and tolerance for down-
time. Like anything in life, there are tradeoffs with each option. Consider this
checklist:
 Are you comfortable editing PHP or Perl scripts?
 Do you have the ability to create new MySQL databases?
 Can you change the permissions of files and directories on your Web
server?
 Are you willing to continually seek out patches and updates to keep the
hackers out?
 Can you handle having your forum down for days on end while you
research the above?
 Do you want to field “I can’t remember my password” questions from
your listener base?
 What is the capitol of Estonia?
If you answered No to one or more of the preceding questions, you probably
aren’t ready to tackle installing your own forum software.
If you answered Yes to all the preceding questions — except for the last one,
and, by the way, the answer is Tallinn — you don’t mind getting your hands
dirty. We recommend finding out what forum software your hosting com-
pany already has pre-configured on your Web server, if any. If your hosting
company does not have a forum pre-configured for your system, start search-
ing through the multitude of options out there ready for downloading and
installing. Google is your friend. . . .
Seeking Out the Comments of Others
There’s an old saying about the best-laid plans of mice and men (they often go
awry). While there exists some doubt in our minds as to the reality of rodents
224
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

podcasting, we can say for certain that listeners of your show, both fan and foe,
will communicate about your show to others in a variety of formats and places
of which you have absolutely no control.
There are likely existing forums, chat rooms, discussion boards, and mailing
lists that deal with your particular podcasting topic. At some point, those
people will find out about your show and start listening. Current research
shows it takes these people exactly 3.7 seconds to post a review to the rest
of the masses. Welcome to the community of the Internet.
There are a variety of ways to keep your eyes and ears on these groups and
to find comments regarding your podcast. See the following sections for the
details.
Trying a general search
Is it just us, or don’t most people do a Google search for their own name at
least twice a week? Could be just us. But that’s a great way to see if people
are talking about you. Google has a gazillion pages in its search database and
constantly crawls a good percentage of the Web, finding interesting tidbits
and adding more data with each pass.
When you search, try various combinations. If your name is a common one,
such as John Smith, you’re probably going to get a lot of hits unrelated to you.
Try adding the topic of your show to the search for more relevant results. For
example, if your name is John Smith and you’re podcasting about underwater
basket weaving, type John Smith underwater basket weaving in the Google
search box. If your show name is unique, or at least uncommon, try using the
name of your show as a search term.
We realize that there are other search engines besides Google. Yahoo! produces
fine results, as do a few others. But for those who have neither the time nor the
inclination to experiment with a dozen search engines, we suggest these two.
Both syndicate their results to other lesser-known (but equally valid) search
engines. Together, they cover the vast majority (by some estimates about
90 percent) of the indexed pages online. But as we’ve said countless times
before, your mileage may vary. The same techniques we’ve outlined will work
well on just about any search engine you prefer.
Using specialty search engines
Search engines are great tools, but sometimes they search a bit too far and
wide for your tastes. Many specialty search engines have cropped up in the
past few years to cater to the needs of people looking to search a more
narrow set of criteria than “all Web pages on the entire planet.” Researchers,
225
Chapter 11: Speaking Directly to Your Peeps

academics, and students have had this level of access for a while. Now, sev-
eral services have been made public that may be of use to the podcaster
trying to find communications about his or her show.
Google News
In what might be the most narcissistic activity on the planet, Google allows
you to easily do a daily check of who is talking about you and your podcast
on the Internet with its Google Alerts free service. With this feature, you
receive an e-mail when a news article within Google News contains text
matching a text string of your choice, which is likely to be your name or the
name of your podcast.
Here’s how to set up a Google Alert:
1. Access the Google News section at news.google.com.
2. Click the News Alerts link in the left navigation bar.
3. Enter the search terms for the topic you want to monitor, the type of
results you want, and how often you want to receive results.
Just for example, you might wish to type in evo terra.
If you want to search beyond news or more than once a day, you can
change these default settings.
4. Enter your e-mail address.
If you’re already logged in to Google, you won’t see this step.
When Google finds matching terms, it sends you an e-mail notification
along with a link to the article.
Technorati
Technorati (technorati.com) is really more of a “buzz engine” than a search
engine. It focuses its concentration and power on blogs and news services
and does an exceptional job of ferreting out conversations about hot topics
of nearly any size.
With Technorati, you can search for keywords, key phrases, or specific URLs.
Many bloggers have found ways to pass the URLs of their blog posts to the
Technorati search engine, allowing them (and others) a quick way to take the
pulse of the community reaction to their words. While Technorati won’t search
through podcast audio yet, it’s a great way to find out if bloggers are discussing
the ideas and comments you put forth on your show.
226
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

Podscope
As of this writing, many podcasts talk about . . . other podcasts. Many don’t
adequately use show notes, which makes it difficult for search engine spiders
and bots to find the content.
Spiders and bots? Hey, Evo hosts a science fiction show, so this stuff comes
natural to him. Spiders follow links around the Internet, much like real spiders
follow the lines of silk on a web. Internet spiders report back on what they
find, whereas real spiders wrap up their prey for a tasty snack later. Bots
(derivative of robots) are automated scripts that act a lot like spiders, but
usually don’t “crawl” as far. Contrary to popular belief, bots do not have
optional laser attachments and have no desire to send muscle-bound cyborgs
from the future to FIND SARAH CONNOR!
But the fine folks at Podscope (podscope.com) have figured out a way around
that — searching the actual audio entry of the episode. Figure 11-3 shows a
recent result on searching for Lance Armstrong at Podscope. If the service
finds any show notes, they are brought back as search results.
However, the true coolness lies a bit deeper. Click the little + button to expand
your results, and then click the green “play” button to listen to a 10-second or
so audio clip that contains the search phrase in question. How very cool! You
can amuse yourself for hours with this little feature, puzzling over how we did
it. And rather than spoil it for you with a technical description of the technolo-
gies involved, we’re sticking with “magic” as the most relevant explanation.

Searching within a site or message board
As extensive and cool as search engines are, they can’t cover everything on
the Net. Not only are there physical limitations as to how wide of an area the
spiders and bots can cover, there are also self-imposed limitations set up by
Web site owners that inhibit a good indexing of the site.
Take forums for example. Earlier in this chapter, we mention that setting up
and installing your own forum is complicated and beyond the scope of this
book. By that same token, many who have managed to set up their forums
have done so in a manner that renders their internal pages invisible to the
spiders and bots of even the best engines.
When this happens, your only recourse is to hope that the forum has an internal
search engine. Most do, though some require registration to access this feature.
Figure 11-4 shows the search results we found by doing an internal search on
a popular discussion board that prohibits spiders and bots from indexing its
individual pages. None of these pages were indexed by Google or by Yahoo!.
Checking your server logs
Many of the comments you find about your show on various other Web sites
will contain a link back to your Web site, show notes, or even your XML feed.

When readers of those comments click the link left by the person who made
the comment, evidence of that visit is recorded by your Web server in a
server log.
Server logs are a nightmare to look at and really weren’t designed to be read
by human eyes. They contain massive blocks of text entries that record an
exhaustive list of data about the visitor, including IP address, date and time
of the visit, pages accessed, images seen, files downloaded, referring site, baro-
metric pressure. . . . Okay, we exaggerated on the last one, but you get the idea.
Most Web hosting companies allow a more user-friendly interface to help site
owners understand the information contained in the log file. Of greatest
importance to this chapter is the referrers section, sometimes called site
visits. These are the “footprints of others,” if you will — evidence that some-
one visited your site after being referred (clicking on a link) from another site.
You are at the mercy of your hosting provider when it comes to your options
for viewing server logs. Many of the podcast-specific and pre-configured blog
options don’t provide this level of detail. If you’ve configured your Web site
from scratch, you likely do have access but are stuck with the tool your host-
ing company provides.
Figures 11-5, 11-6, and 11-7 show three of the more popular server log analytics
programs (sometimes called Web stats) available from many hosting compa-
nies. Log in to your Web administration panel and look for any of these options.
If all else fails, call or e-mail your hosting company and ask how to access your
log analysis tools.

Some people spend hours every day looking over their server logs. Hey, that’s
your prerogative if you wish to head down that path. Be warned that obsession
with Web stats (“the numbers”) has been clinically proven to be detrimental to
personal hygiene, interpersonal communication skills, and marital bliss.
Now that you’ve found the comments. . . .
Look, we’re not your mother. We’re just a couple of guys imploring you to
actively communicate with your listeners, even if they comment about you
in other places. So get to communicating already!
 Blogs: If the comment came from a blog post or a comment on a blog
post, comment back! After that, make a note to come back and check a
day or two later. A great feedback loop could get started, and the last
thing you want to do is leave them hanging.
Some of the blog comments allow you to subscribe to the comment
thread, sending you an e-mail alert when someone posts after your post.
We strongly recommend using this tool because that little note you wrote
will likely get lost in the shuffle.
 Forums: The same advice holds true for discussion forums. We highly
recommend signing up on the forum where they are chatting about you
and becoming a regular poster. Most forums operate free of charge, so
your only investment is time. Posting regularly keeps your show on the
minds of the other people on the forum, almost guaranteeing that you’ll
gain additional listeners who are interested in what you have to say.
 News stories, official reviews, and other comments: Places that don’t
allow comments or additional direct feedback can be more challenging,
but should not be avoided. Find e-mail addresses for the people who
have written articles and let them know you saw what they wrote. Tell
them you’ll be mentioning their articles in an upcoming show. The more
often they listen, the more good press you’re likely to get from them.
When the comments are less than good
First, don’t panic.
Second, don’t respond. Not yet.
Third, let your blood pressure come down to a normal level.
Let’s face it. Anytime someone has any critical comments about us, we get an
emotional reaction. We call that being human, and it’s perfectly understandable
and quite literally impossible to suppress, unless you’re one of those aliens
from earlier in the chapter.
231
Chapter 11: Speaking Directly to Your Peeps

Once you’re calm and feeling a bit more detached, reread the comment and
plan your course of action. Here are some suggestions:
1. Reflect on the comment.
What does the comment say, really? Does the person make a valid point?
Is there an area of improvement you should make? If the comment was
specific, go back and re-listen to the show in question. Did you say what
the person said you did or stumble as bad as the person made it out to be?
You may need a different perspective, so feel free to get someone else
involved.
2. Once you fully understand the criticism, decide if you want to
respond or not.
Obviously, if a comment is in any way libelous, you may wish to seek
legal counsel before proceeding. If a comment is simply pure vitriol,
your best course may be to ignore it and go about your business.
But if you feel it’s necessary, reply. Just like any argument, it’s best to
keep things on a professional level with your words and mannerisms.
While it may be hard to not put it on a personal level, try not to do that.
It’s not going to help the situation.
3. If you decide to reply, consider how you will reply:
• Send an e-mail. If you send an e-mail, count on that e-mail being
posted right alongside the negative comment. There’s no guarantee
the person will keep your correspondence private. In fact, count on
the opposite. Whatever you say in a private e-mail should be some-
thing you would be willing to say in a more public forum.
• Get others to respond for you. We caution against coaching their
response, however. Instead, send your defender of choice a simple
e-mail with a link to the offending post and perhaps a link to your
episode in question, if applicable. Choose someone with a level
head, not your older sister who’ll punch anyone in the face who
tussles your hair on the playground.
But more than anything, grow from the experience. Understand that anything
you say in your podcast will be heard by a variety of people, with different
backgrounds, experiences, and expectations of the world. We’ve been on
both sides of this and can count many times where the negative comments
we received turned out to be some of the best feedback. We think we’re
better podcasters for it.
Feedback, good or bad, is only as constructive as you make it out to be.

Chapter 12
Fishing for Listeners
In This Chapter
 Getting your podcast ready for advertising
 Using paid advertising
 Taking advantage of free advertising
 Generating buzz about your podcast
A
s of this writing, there are over 10,000 podcasters. By some estimates,
over 200,000 people listen to various podcasts, though we believe the
actual number is somewhat higher still. However, that pales in comparison 
to the potential audience, somewhere in excess of 160 million people world-
wide with a broadband Internet connection. While the audience is large, 
the options for listeners are legion. How do you attract an audience to your
podcast?
In this chapter, we show you a variety of options that you may wish to use in
an effort to gain a larger listener base. Some cost you money, others cost you
time. But the end result should be exposing your podcast to the right people
at the right time.
Getting Your Podcast Ready
for Advertising
Whether you plan on spending real money or expending real energy, you
need to do some prep work before you start your campaign. Advertising cam-
paigns should not be rushed, but should be carefully planned and executed.
Failure to do so can not only be a huge waste of time and money, but also
may result in turning off potential listeners to your show, making it many
times more difficult to lure them back for a second chance.

Polishing your presentation
Most podcasters need a few shows under their belts before they hit their
stride. If you’re on podcast episode number three, you likely haven’t flushed
out your show. Granted, you may have been planning this for months on
end, or have previous experience behind the mic on another medium, or
have nailed it from the beginning. If so, great. But understand you are in the
minority.
While each person is different, we suggest giving yourself at least five full
shows to find the sweet spot for your show. Experimentation is part of the
format, so play with a few things along the way to see where your strengths
as well as your weaknesses are.
Checking on your bandwidth
In Chapter 7, we talk about the negative aspects of too large an audience.
Each new listener means more of your precious bandwidth is being con-
sumed. For podcasters with limited bandwidth, getting more listeners can 
be an expensive proposition.
If you’re using the services of Liberated Syndication (libsyn.com) or another
unmetered bandwidth podcast hosting company, this won’t be an issue for
you. See Chapter 7 for more information about these very affordable services.
Figure 12-1 shows the bandwidth usage for one of Evo’s shows, taken mid-July
2005. As you can see, his listeners have already consumed 256.65 gigabytes
(GB) of transfers for the month. Your hosting company should provide a simi-
lar status report in your control panel. If you’re unsure of where to look for it,
call or e-mail your hosting company’s support desk for more information.
Too many podcasters are often surprised when they run out of bandwidth.
We’re more surprised of how poor their math skills are. Suppose that you
have 100MB of monthly transfers allowed for your site. On the 10th of July,
you log in to your bandwidth stats page and see that you’re already at 60MB
for the month. Will you make it? Here are the formulas to figure this out:
Bandwidth consumed / number of days so far this month = Daily band-
width rate
Daily bandwidth rate × the total number of days in the month = Total
bandwidth needed
Now you plug in your numbers to find out your daily bandwidth rate:
60MB / 10 = 6MB
234
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

You’re consuming about 6MB per day. Now multiply this number (6MB) by the
number of days in the month (31) to get the total bandwidth you need for
the month:
6MB × 31 = 186MB
No, you will not be able to stay within your 100MB limit. You will be roughly
86MB over your 100MB plan.
That sounds — and is — simple, but real world numbers might be helpful.
In Evo’s case, the math is
256.65GB / 17 days = 15GB average daily transfer rate for July
15GB × 31 days = 465GB by the end of the month
As you can see, he needs 465GB of bandwidth to get through the month,
assuming his traffic stays steady and doesn’t increase. If his bandwidth ceiling
was 500GB, he’d need to think twice before starting an advertising campaign,
as he’d likely hit that ceiling, and his hosting provider would likely shut down
access to all those brand-new podcast listeners he just worked so hard to
get. Not a good way for anyone to spend his or her time.
As a good rule, you need to be utilizing less than 50 percent of your monthly
allotment of bandwidth before starting an advertising campaign. If you’re using
any more than that, you’ll run out of room and will have to seek alternative
hosting options before proceeding. We cover some of these alternative options
in Chapter 7.

Chapter 12: Fishing for Listeners

Figuring out your USP
USP is a marketing term, and it stands for unique selling proposition. While you
probably aren’t charging money to listen to your podcast, make no mistake
that you need to “sell it” to potential listeners if you’re considering advertising.
Why should a potential listener listen to your podcast? And more importantly,
how can you, as the podcast advertiser, present a message that makes a
potential listener want to listen?
Plenty of books, Web sites, seminars, and post-graduate-degree programs are
dedicated to the subtle nuances of advertising. We’re not suggesting you go
that far, obviously. But we do suggest you take a good, hard look at what you
produce every week, and come up with a short, concise, and consistent mes-
sage with which to promote your show.
Sometimes calling in help from the outside can be a good thing. Ask your
friends and family, or even your listeners, to come up with some key points
of why they listen to your show. We’re not talking about a catchy slogan or
jingle of the sort a Madison Avenue marketing firm might designate as the
“perfect” thing to attract new listeners, but rather plain English (or your lan-
guage of choice) ways to tell interested folks what your show is about and
why they should be listening.
Here’s an example. Evo produces three different science-fiction-focused radio
shows. Each has its own flavor, and its own USP. The best example is his
Dragon Page Cover to Cover. Early on, Evo and his partner focused on inter-
viewing science fiction and fantasy authors. This set the show apart from
other sci-fi shows that were interviewing various actors, discussing popular
TV shows and movies, and generally skipping over the literary aspects of 
science fiction. In fact, they decided that that last sentence summed up the
show: Literary concepts in science fiction and fantasy. And a USP was born.
We can’t give you a step-by-step outline on this one. Spend a few days on it.
Try it out on some folks first. When you find a message that fits, you’re ready
to proceed.
Exploring Various Advertising Options
In this section, we discuss some ways you can advertise to expose your 
podcast to a larger audience. Then later in the chapter, we talk about some
additional opportunities that go beyond simply buying advertising space.
236
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

Google AdWords
When it comes to exposing yourself to the largest possible audience, you
simply can’t beat the power of Google. More than just a search engine,
Google allows you to reach over 80 percent of all active Internet users with
targeted and relevant advertising. With Google AdWords (adwords.google.
com), you need to keep your advertising costs under control and reach a 
very specific audience.
How it works
Google AdWords allows you to place text ads or sponsored links at the top
and right side of Google search results pages, based on keywords that you
(and others) bid on. Additionally, its content distribution network allows
your text ads to appear on various Web sites related to the keywords for
which you have placed bids.
Google charges advertisers on a cost-per-click basis, and the cost of the click
is determined by how much Google is charging you for that click, not to exceed
your maximum bid amount. You can spend $5.00 per day, or $500,000 per month
on Google, showing the true scalability of the platform. Evo has been a power
user of Google for years, both personally and on behalf of his clients, and has
always found that Google delivers great results.
237
Chapter 12: Fishing for Listeners
Is advertising right for your podcast?
Before launching your advertising campaign,
apply some Jurassic Parklogic. In that movie, Jeff
Goldblum’s character chastises the dinosaur-
resurrecting mogul with “your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether or not they could, they
didn’t stop to think if they should.” Good advice for
podcasters and mad scientists alike.
For many, podcasting is a labor of love and not
a money-making proposition. As such, spending
too much money or time on advertising may
make a passion seem a heck of a lot more like a
job — and you already have one of those.
Some of the podcasts we enjoy the most, such
as Dave Slusher’s Evil Genius Chronicles (www.
evilgeniuschronicles.org), are very
vocal about not advertising and not working
toward a huge listener base. Dave makes a pod-
cast for one person — Dave Slusher. If other
folks hear about the podcast and decide to
listen, great — so long as they enjoy it and don’t
expect him to be something he’s not. Fame is a
double-edged sword — even the moderate
fame a popular podcaster can achieve. Before
long, e-mails and voice mails are flying in with
ideas, suggestions, and even mandates of how
you can make the show better — for them.
Don’t forget that fan is short for fanatic, and
fanatical people don’t always behave rationally.

Google provides a Traffic Estimator to its AdWords clients, helping them
understand what sort of traffic an advertiser might expect from a given set
of keywords.
The signup process for the AdWords product is simple and straightforward, so
we don’t go in detail about it in this book. Simply access adwords.google.
com, and Google takes you step by step through the sign-up process.
Using the service
When you first sign up for Google AdWords, start with a small investment. Even
for representatives of large companies looking to start their own podcast, don’t
go overboard on spending real dollars on advertising campaigns right off the
bat. Pick a modest number to start with, evaluate your results, and refine your
technique. After you have it figured out, then you can go hog-wild!
After you decide on a budget, you need to find keywords that fit within that
budget. Say, for example, your podcast is about fishing. For the keyword fish-
ing, Google estimates approximately 2,600 clicks per day. That’s a great traffic
number that any fledgling podcaster would love to have hitting their site
each day.
However, in order to get all those 2,600 clicks for fishing, Google says you’d
need to set your maximum bid at $2.50 per click so that your ad showed in a
good and competitive position against other people and companies advertis-
ing on the page. Google further estimates you would be charged an average of
$0.62 for each of those clicks, making your total daily budget over $1,600 per
day. Wow.
To help bring this cost down to a more manageable level, you need to get
more targeted with your keywords. Fishing is a rather broad term, so try a
few other combinations to see if you can find a cost within your budget.
Here are a few examples you might consider:
 salmon fishing: If you enter salmon fishing in the Traffic Estimator, you
get a more reasonable estimate of a total cost of $46.19 per day. However,
at that price tag, you’re only attracting 20 new people. Salmon fishing has
a much higher cost per click than fishing.
 fishing advice: A more economical approach is to bid on fishing advice.
Not as many big outfitters and organizations are willing to give advice
away, so they aren’t bidding on the keywords. Daily traffic isn’t much
more than 1 or 2 clicks per day, but the cost estimate is only $0.44 per
click. Now you’re into the world of reality.
All Google ads are bid-based, causing those who pay the highest amount of
money for a click to rise to the top. If you only want to spend $0.25 to get a
click, but the top bid on that keyword is already $4.50, you’re going to be way
down the list of advertisers.
238
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

Blogads
Advertising on blogs requires a different mindset than advertising on a search
engine. Blog readers, for the most part, have little love for advertising. They’re
looking for content they can’t get from the mainstream media outlets, or are
completely caught up by the cult of personality surrounding their bloggers of
choice.
Sounds like a perfect place to attract listeners to your podcast!
Blogads (blogads.com) is a fine example of one company that makes this
easier on the advertiser. While you can find literally hundreds of thousands of
blogs, Blogads has created a network of sorts, allowing you to place a single
ad on a multitude of blogs. That’s a whole lot easier than researching blogs,
negotiating prices individually, and creating and tracking ads for each one.
According to Blogads: “Warning: ads you’d run on sites like MSNBC.com may
underperform on blogs. Smart blogads join a community’s conversation
rather than shouting over it.” If you’re an independent podcast producer, you
should have no trouble creating ads that really speak to why people should
listen to your podcast. If you’re podcasting for a corporation, getting your
advertising department to speak in this language may be more difficult. Blog
Ads has some great examples of what does, as well as what doesn’t, work on
its network of sites.
Signing up for Blogads takes only a few minutes. You’re guided through the
process of creating a compelling image and using supporting text within the
ad. Prices range from $20 per week to over $5,000 per week, putting Blogads
in a price range for nearly anybody who is ready to spend some money
advertising his or her show.
Writing press releases
Some podcasters have had enormous success with press releases. When you
write and release a press release, it’s available to be picked up by a variety of
news sources. On the plus side, you have a lot of room inside a press release
to talk about your show. On the negative, you have no guarantee of who, if
anyone, will pick up and run your press release.
Writing an effective press release is a true art form. It has to appeal to both
the managing editor of the publication considering your release or building 
a story around it, and to John Q. Public who will be reading your release
(or article built from your release) in the publication.
239
Chapter 12: Fishing for Listeners

PR Newswire
PR Newswire (prwire.com) is the cream of the crop when it comes to online
and offline distribution of your press release. PR Newswire has the ability to
send your press release to thousands of media outlets, ranging from newsprint,
radio, Web sites, television, and more.
The company also provides editorial services for your press release, as well
as tips and tricks on how to write an effective release that is more likely to
get results. If you’re serious about getting the maximum exposure to your
show and are thinking about using a press release as part of your strategy,
PR Newswire is worth looking into.
However, many independent podcasters may find the cost prohibitive (around
$300 to start) and the registration process somewhat daunting. In a world
where online registration and upfront disclosure is commonplace, PR Newswire
follows a more traditional approach. Gaining access requires you to contact
your local bureau either via e-mail (information@prnewswire.com) or by
telephone. You can find a list at www.prnewswire.com/services/resources/
bureaus.shtml.
PRWeb
Considerably less archaic is PRWeb (prweb.com). This organization offers
paid and donation-based services, and boasts of a good number of media out-
lets. The main difference between the two organizations (other than cost and
the hassle-factor) is the quality of the distribution. PRWeb works to put your
press release in front of thousands of online media outlets. Offline media
sources may subscribe as well, but the primary distribution is online.
Not that that is a bad thing. After all, your podcast is an online service, and
you’re likely most effective reaching an audience who is already online. Both
of us have had various write-ups in both online and offline media, and we’ve
always received more traffic and attention to our Web sites from the online
sources.
We don’t want to make PRWeb sound somehow inferior to the traditional
sources of press release distribution. Far from it, actually. While the service
may not be as full featured, it can still be a great way to get your word out,
and one that is quite cost effective.
For $80, PRWeb distributes your press release (among many other things) in
Yahoo! News, a huge news source that is often referenced in the online com-
munity. Additionally, press releases at this level are reviewed by the PRWeb
editorial team, providing valuable feedback on ways to make your press
release more meaningful and more likely to be picked up by various other
news organizations around the Internet.

Advertising without Spending Money
Before you start throwing money toward an advertising campaign, consider
all the things you can do to spread the word about your podcast that don’t
require a financial investment. In fact, you probably should be doing these
things even if you plan on tossing out some cash for effect.
Optimizing your site for search engines
In Chapters 8 and 9, we give you several tips on how you can make your RSS
listings as well as your show notes more appealing to search engines. You can
employ similar methods to your entire Web site, so that it receives the maxi-
mum exposure and visibility to search engines.
For more information on optimizing your site, we highly recommend Search
Engine Optimization For Dummies by Peter Kent (published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc.). Additionally, Cre8asite Forums at cre8asiteforums.com
is an invaluable discussion board to keep up on the latest techniques on
keeping your Web site search engine friendly.
Submitting promos to other podcasts
Podcasting has been called by critics (even us) a great hall of mirrors, as it
seems that nearly every podcast spends a ridiculous portion of its time talking
about . . . other podcasts!
We think this is normal for an emerging medium, and something that is, for
the most part, accepted by the general podcasting audience. The podcasting
landscape isn’t shrinking anytime soon, and it’s so fractured that many listen-
ers are looking for their favorite podcasters to help steer them toward other
podcasts they may find interesting.
Not all podcasters do this. In fact, the majority of the corporate podcasts
must see other podcasts as competition, and are as likely to talk about
another podcast as a traditional broadcaster is to talk about another station
across town. Even some of the independent podcasters make a point not to
talk about other podcasts, simply because they don’t want to add to the hall
of mirrors effect.
241
Chapter 12: Fishing for Listeners

One of the more widespread ways podcasters talk about other podcasters is
with promos. A promo is a short (or long) audio clip that describes your
show. Other podcasts then insert this clip into their shows, or play it on the
air so to speak, thereby presenting your message to their subscribed and
downloading audiences.
Promos are a great way to let other folks know your podcast exists. Spend
some time listening to other podcasts and see if they’re playing promos.
When you find one that does, see what the average time for the promotion
turns out to be, and what type of content is being presented. Is it all serious
business, or is more light-hearted humor involved?
Some podcasters are really good at making promos, and are even offering to
make promos for free for other podcasters. A whole promo exchange indus-
try is cropping up, allowing podcasters to trade time with other podcasters,
each agreeing to run the other podcaster’s promo for a certain number of
weeks. Check out kiptronic.com and podcastpromos.com for details.
Recording your promo
Recording your own promo isn’t difficult, and we tend to enjoy the ones that
come from the voice of the podcaster. You’ve done the hard work by figuring
out what makes your podcast special; now you need to sit down and record
your promo. Here are a few tips:
 Write out your script.
Or don’t. Some folks are happy flying off the cuff. But in the interest of
time, we highly recommend putting some thoughts down on paper and
running through them out loud to see how long it takes. Most promos
are under a minute long, unless you have lots of great stuff to say.
 Add effects and music from your podcast.
If you use the same music (see Chapter 5) in your show each week, or
have some special sound effects that brand the show as yours, include
them in your promo. Effects are a great way to tie in your promotion to
your show, giving new listeners assurance they have subscribed to the
right place.
 Don’t forget your Web site URL!
Too many podcasters provide the link to their podcast feed. Useless, in
our opinions. Instead, repeat the URL of your Web site, where it should
be painfully simple to subscribe to the RSS feed for your podcast. Now
here’s to hoping you picked an easy-to-remember domain name!
242
Part IV: Start Spreadin’ the News about Your Podcast 

 Include a link to the promo on your Web site.
Recording a promo and sending it out to a few podcasts is great, but
what about all the other folks who you inspire to make their own pod-
cast? Chances are, if you put a link to your promo file on your Web site,
others will grab that file and include your promo in their shows. It’s also
a good repository for when you find another podcast you think might
want to run your promo. Save some e-mail bandwidth and send the link
to the file, rather than the file itself.
One final note on sending out promos: Ask. Unless the show specifically says
“submit your promos to us at . . . ,” be a good podcasting citizen and send the
podcaster a note asking if she’d like to run your promo. Requests that start off
with “I listen to your show every week because you . . .” are likely to get a better
response than those starting (and ending) with “Please run my promo.”
Giving interviews
Don’t forget that podcasting is the fastest growing medium we’ve seen . . .
ever! If your podcast covers a brand-new area of the world or addresses an
underserved market, folks are out there who want to talk with you about it.
Contact the publications, radio shows, Web sites, and other outlets that
cover the industry your podcast falls under. Send them your press release,
along with a personalized note telling them about your show and stating that
you’re happy to do an interview.
Interviews can be done in person, but most today are conducted over the
phone. A handful are conducted via e-mail. Preparing for an interview can
make the difference between a poor interview that never sees publication or
airtime and a well-delivered interview that keeps the audience — as well as
the interviewer — engaged and entertained.
Here are a few tips to make your interview go swimmingly:
 Eliminate the BS factor.
If you have only a passing interest in the subject for which you are trying
to pass yourself off as an expert, you’ll be quickly discovered, thrashed
repeatedly, and left out for the buzzards. The people who are interview-
ing you likely are already experts in their fields, so don’t try and come
off as something you are not. Be open and honest about your experi-
ence, and focus on why you’re doing the podcast.
243
Chapter 12: Fishing for Listeners

 Mention your Web site, over and over again.
Remember that the listeners, readers, or viewers you are being inter-
viewed in front of have no idea who you are and what you are about.
This is your chance to sell yourself and your podcast. If your interviewer
is good, he’ll give you ample opportunity to mention your Web site and
podcast. If not, it’s up to you. Look for chances to drop the name and
URL if necessary.
 Stay positive.
If the interviewer knows anything about podcasting, he’ll likely ask 
questions on the future of podcasting, the death of radio, amateur
versus professional, and all sorts of other controversial topics. Unless
your podcast is about podcasting, we recommend rising above the din.
This conversation doesn’t serve you or the listening/reading/viewing
audience well. Point out how your podcast addresses the issue, and
resist the temptation to get into an argument. Unless your podcast is
about arguing with interviewers, then go right ahead.
Generating buzz
All the processes we outline in this chapter are geared toward one thing: gen-
erating buzz for your podcast. The more folks you can get talking about your
show, the better off you are. We don’t buy the “any publicity is good publicity”
line, but we do think that “Hey have you heard about . . .?” conversations
amongst real people is the best form of advertising you can get.
Sometimes, you need to take the message to the masses. Find a discussion
group or online forum germane to your podcast’s area of interest and start
posting.
Don’t start out with “Hey, I’m new to the group and have this great podcast!”
Instead, listen to the conversation, comment on a few threads, and get folks
used to your voice before you hit them with the come-listen-to-my-podcast
pitch.
In fact, the best way to pitch your podcast is to never utter those words at
all. Instead, offer up things like “Last week on my podcast, I covered the very
thing you were talking about, Jill.” It shows you’re paying attention to the
conversation, and not just looking to spam a newsgroup or mailing list with
your podcast URL.
As we mention in Chapter 11 regarding e-mail, a very fine line exists between
tasteful self-promotion and outright spamming. Generating buzz is not the
same as advertising. Advertising has its place, but most forums don’t welcome
it. If you can’t decide if your post contains too much advertising or not, it
probably does. Discretion is the better part of valor, in this instance.

In this part . . .
A
s you can see in the parts and chapters leading up
to this one, podcasting is a breeze when you know
the right steps. But now comes the moment of truth: We
move away from the “how” questions and tackle “why” you
might want to podcast. Fame and fortune? Strength and
honor? Therapy and philanthropy? Fun with computers?
An alternative to a real social life? These all sound like
good reasons to us.

 Attracting advertisers and sponsors

 Building your media kit
T
hroughout this book, we show you novel and interesting ways to toss sig-
nificant amounts of coinage into the proverbial black hole of podcasting.
Let’s face it, this is a habit — and it likely should come with a warning from
the Surgeon General, or perhaps your accountant.
Hosting fees, bandwidth overages, shiny new microphones, music royalties
and licensing fees, phone charges, travel expenses . . . the hard and soft costs
of this little hobby of yours just might add up quickly.
That’s why this chapter shows you some ways to offset a portion (or all) of
these costs, and perhaps even add a few dollars to your pocket while you
explore your newfound passion. If you anticipate a large following, we’ll cover
some ideas you can use to make this your paying gig.
Being a podcaster is a lot like being an actor, writer, or movie star. A few select
individuals may make it big, but the bulk of the masses will be just getting by.
If you are reading this chapter first in hopes of getting a crash course in how
to “get rich quick” with your podcast, you are about to be disappointed. If not,
we can talk.
How Much Money Can You Make?
Most podcasters fall into one of three categories: small, medium, and large
(well, yeah). Because of the very low barrier-to-entry — in effect, almost
anyone can create a podcast — the smaller variety of podcaster will likely
make up the bulk of the community for the foreseeable future.

Here’s a closer look at the moneymaking opportunities for these three podcast
categories:
 Small: Having a small audience size does not exclude you from drawing a
revenue stream from your podcast. It likely limits the size of your poten-
tial revenues, but it doesn’t mean you can’t bring in at least some income.
Small is a relative term, and we’re not about to start tossing out audience-
size statistics to draw a clear demarcation between small and medium.
Small is also not a derogatory term; many podcasters enjoy the idea of
keeping their cast small. There is a certain comfort in the small podcasts,
a charm that some would say is diminished as the size of the podcast
increases.
 Medium: Podcasters who find themselves (or claim to be) in the medium
category may find that a larger listening audience affords them additional
opportunities. For instance, corporations and advertisers may be more
willing to consider placing ads or providing sponsorships to those shows
with more than a handful of dedicated listeners.
However, they also find themselves in a more competitive marketplace,
as other podcasters start fishing for monies to help offset their costs.
Stepping upward in the ranks also means stepping up the game, and
many podcasters find themselves in an unfamiliar place — trying to
develop media kits that boost their podcasts above the din raised by all
those other podcasts chasing the very same advertisers.
Creating an effective media kit, especially for a newly discovered market-
place such as podcasting, is actually a pretty important task (for more
about the why, what, and how-to, see “Developing a media kit,” later
in this chapter). We highly recommend the Podcast Brothers (feeds.
feedburner.com/PodcastBrothers) podcast to anyone looking for
ideas and ways to make money with podcasting. Tim and Emil Bourquin
produce this weekly show, covering the ins and the outs of making
money with your podcast.
 Large: Breaking this barrier at the far end of the size spectrum is an elite
set of podcasters who occupy the large category. When it comes to
making money with your podcast, size really does matter. Podcasts with
a huge audience base will likely find advertisers a lot easier to approach;
they can present listener numbers that are more like what the advertis-
ers are used to seeing in their more traditional media buys.
There aren’t that many really large podcasts out there — yet — so thus
far the playing field is still fairly open. Still, it’s no picnic for large pod-
casters; after all, they’re still narrowcasting, and they probably won’t
rake in as much as a nationally syndicated radio program. Don’t be sur-
prised, however, if you see that paradigm change. Podcasters have much
more flexibility than broadcasters, and arguably a closer relationship
with the audience.

Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

Convincing Advertisers
to Give You Money
If the idea of begging for money sounds rather repulsive, good. If you have to
resort to begging, you shouldn’t be asking at all. People will only part with their
cash if you give them a compelling reason. “Because I’m a poor podcaster” is
not a compelling reason.
249
Chapter 13: Show Me the Money
Does your podcast need to pay for itself?
“You spent how much on a new microphone?”
You’ll soon be hearing that, or a question just like
it with a different gizmo attached to the question
mark. Your non-podcasting friends, colleagues,
and perhaps even family will gaze in wonder at
your apparent lack of good judgment as you
seemingly spend money as if it grew on trees,
adding just one more piece to your previously
professed “perfect” podcasting setup.
How can you, in good conscience, justify this
outlay of cash without the financial backing of
someone else? Surely if no one is willing to pay
you to do this podcasting thing, you shouldn’t be
doing it at all, right?
In a word, wrong.
(Evo here.) As I write this, my 14-year-old son is
busy bouncing back and forth between his PS2
and his PC, about $3,000 in total investments. My
wife is on her laptop ($1,500) cropping recent
images taken with her new top-of-the-line pro-
sumer digital camera ($2,000). Next door, my
neighbor is up to his elbows in grease, changing
the rear seals (whatever those are) in his
“family fleet” of ATVs before a trip to the dunes
this weekend. He wins the prize, having no less
than $15,000 invested in his passion.
Each of these non-podcasting individuals, all of
whom are involved in the healthy pursuit of lib-
erty and happiness, constantly spend money on
their hobbies. My son thinks nothing of dropping
$50 of his (read: MY) money on a game every two
months. My wife now goes through at least two
color ink cartridges every month. And Jerry next
door has to burn through a few hundred dollars
of fuel, parts, and doctor bills each month.
If I were to poll each of these people, asking
them whether they had ever considered getting
someone to help pay for their various addic-
tions, they’d look at me as if I were from another
planet. Well, except my son. He’d just grin and
say, “But isn’t that you, Dad?”
Think of the amount of money you spend eating
out each week. Or for movie tickets, theater pre-
sentations, concerts, and/or bar tabs. These are
things you love and enjoy, not things you’re
trying to find others to pay for. Most podcasters
will spend no more than a hundred bucks a
month on their show, and that’s stretching it.
And for such a small investment that has such a
high personal payoff . . . do you need to be paid
off in cold hard cash to do it?
(Tee here.) And of course, never underestimate
the power and value of SPUs: Spousal
Permission Units. Flowers, a surprise trip to a
spa, and cooking dinner and cleaning house for
a month. It will surprise you how many SPUs a
little TLC can earn you for some killer podcast-
ing hardware!

Whether your goal is to gain sponsors or sell advertising spots, you have to
answer a very important question: What’s in it for them? Why should some-
one else make a financial contribution to your show? There are a multitude of
good reasons that you’ll need to uncover, understand, and be able to explain
if you hope to be successful in asking for funds to support your podcast.
Getting advertising money
Contrary to popular belief, there aren’t nearly enough corporations so bursting-
at-the-seams with unused advertising dollars that they’ll welcome you with
open arms when you approach them and say, “Hey! Wanna advertise on my
podcast?”
Most corporations have an advertising budget (as in, limit on what they can
spend). In nearly all circumstances, this budget is significantly smaller than
the range of potential places they might be advertising — so they’re looking
for bang-for-the-buck. As one of the would-be venues for their ads, you’re
competing with other forms of media — including outlets that already have
well-established pitches and presentations at the ready.
Before you start cold-calling possible advertisers, do a little homework: Spend
some time, energy, and money developing something your potential advertis-
ers can touch and see — a media kit, as described in the next section.
The big fish are very well armed in this pond. Large media outlets tend to
have large media kits that were developed with the assistance of large adver-
tising agencies that charged large sums of money for their expertise. The
small- to mid-size podcaster need not go this far. But you need something
more than just a burned CD of your latest episode.
Developing a media kit
A media kit is, in effect, a collection of marketing tools designed to awaken
potential advertisers to their crying need to shell out big bucks to support
your product (in this case, your podcast). The size of your media kit depends
on many factors, among which are how much you want to spend and how
much important stuff you think you have to say. It’s not size you’re striving
for here; it’s a compelling argument that you can present to your potential
advertisers.
Media kits are most certainly not one size fits all. Your media kit should be
representative of the actual feeling you try to produce on your podcast —
competent, real, not over-the-top glitzy. Consider it like a job interview: It’s
okay to comb your hair and put on a fresh shirt, but you wouldn’t send your
good-looking-but-ignorant roommate as a stand-in, would you? (Look what
happened to Cyrano.)
250
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

So here’s a practical list of dos and don’ts to keep in mind when considering
what to put in your media kit.
First off, the “Yes, go for it” list:
 Include accurate listener statistics. Well, as accurate as you can, anyway.
Include the total number of subscribers to your podcast feed; estimate
how many direct downloads an episode of your show attracts. If your
podcast is seeing great growth, include a chart that shows the increasing
numbers. (For more about listener statistics, see the handy nearby side-
bar, “Can you ever really know the size of your audience?”)
 Display your show schedule. If you update your podcast several times
a week or once a month, put up a calendar or schedule of when your
updates happen. If your show has no set schedule, be prepared to explain
your methodology of updates. Many advertisers expect some sort of con-
sistency (read: reliable exposure) from the places their ads are running.
 Provide demographic information. Some advertisers will want to know
the general make-up of your audience. The more detailed you can get,
the better. At a minimum, show a breakdown of gender, age range, and
household income level. These statistics can be difficult to gather, but
doing so increases your chances with many advertisers.
 Showcase your popularity. If you get 50 comments on each of your show
note entries, talk about it. Technorati (technorati.com) and Google
(www.google.com) can support any claims for the popularity of your
site. Print out any great testimonials showing your knowledge and exper-
tise in the field. Favorable comments from other known experts go a long
way, too!
And in the “No, no, a thousand times no” corner, we have . . . 
 Don’t artificially inflate your statistics. Grandmother always used to
say that lies just cause you to make bigger lies. Eventually you find your-
self with an advertiser who wants you to explain how you came up with
your numbers. Make sure you can support your claims.
 Don’t offer reduced pricing. Podcasting is a new medium, and you likely
haven’t had time to put things on sale yet. Pick a price you’re comfortable
with and justify why it’s worth it. Avoid discounting right off the bat; it
simply implies that you’re over-valuing your product. You can always
negotiate the price, but don’t try that in a media kit.
 Don’t include a copy of your entire show on CD. People like to know
what they are getting themselves into. Podcasters have a great opportu-
nity to offer that courtesy to potential advertisers — to let them listen
enough to sample the wares. Remember, however, that their time is lim-
ited. You may include entire episodes if you like, but you may find better
success by stitching together “best of” clips from your show; these take
less time to consume.
251
Chapter 13: Show Me the Money

 Don’t make a halfhearted effort. Okay, you don’t have to create a full-
blown presentation that would make the mavens of Madison Avenue
envious of your skill set. But we’re not talking Elmer’s glue and crayons
here, either. Treat it like a business; invest the right kind of time and money
to make your media kit look (and sound) as professional as you can.
When you have your content figured out, go buy a nice pretty binder. Or
better yet, order some custom ones online that feature your podcast logo,
slogan, and Web site address. You can get them online from VistaPrint
(www.vistaprint.com) if you want large quantities. For smaller runs, see
what your local office-supply or copy center can provide.
252
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
Can you ever really know the size 
of your audience?
Tracking down listener statistics is elusive —
and that’s quite an understatement. While many
of the podcasting pundits will tell you how
important understanding your audience size is
(especially when you’re trying to attract adver-
tisers and sponsors), it’s difficult for them to
agree on the best way to snag those numbers.
Web-server analysis tools are wholly unreliable
in this regard; after all, they weren’t designed
for this purpose. They can tell you how many
times your podcast episodes were requested,
but not how many of those requests were suc-
cessful. They can tell you how many times your
RSS 2.0 file was accessed, but provide you with
no tool to filter out requests made every five
minutes by the same obsessed podcatcher.
The most widely used model of determining
audience size is the bandwidth-division method.
This requires you, the podcaster, to know two
pieces of data: the average size of your podcast
media files and the total amount of data trans-
ferred in a given month. For example, suppose
your ISP reported that you transferred 350GB of
data in the month of May. Convert that to MB by
multiplying by 1024 (the numbers of megabytes
in a gigabyte) to get 358,400MB of data transfer.
Okay, suppose that during that month, you put up
four podcasts, each with a size of 10MB. Divide
the total number of transfers (358,400) by the
average size of your file (10MB) to get the “total”
number of accesses to that file — in this case
35,840. Finally, divide that number by the total
number of podcast media files released (4, in this
case). The answer (in theory, at least): You have
approximately 8,960 listeners to your show.
This number, however, does not take into
account the data transferred by your Web server
simply to run your Web site — say, images and
text. Nor is it helpful when your podcast media
files vary widely in size. And it still doesn’t factor
in those folks who downloaded 90 percent of
your show before the connection broke.
Podcast-specific hosting plans, such as Libsyn,
are trying out new statistical tools to get a better
handle on determining audience size. Their cal-
culations are much more complex than the divi-
sion method, but are drawing considerable fire
from the community of pundits.
Our advice is to find a method that seems to
work for you and stick with it. It’s the best you
can do . . . for now.

Establishing a rate sheet
And you thought you were headed into uncharted waters by just creating a
podcast? How about figuring out a fair price to charge for running advertising?
That’s by no means a science. Heck, it’s not even an art form at this stage! It’s
total guesswork — picking a number, throwing it out there, and seeing what
sticks.
Sometimes all you can do is put your best foot forward and make your pitch.
Talk to the advertiser about your dedicated audience, and how loyal it is to
your show. Breaking down the costs into per-listener numbers might help as
well. Whatever your approach, don’t try to compare your numbers with
those of traditional outlets the advertiser is already working with. Instead,
talk about how adding podcast advertising to the mix can enhance its current
efforts, allowing the company to reach an audience that has turned away
from traditional media sources in favor of this new medium.
Setting advertising limits
Podcasting is not radio, nor should it be. One of the many complaints about
radio is that it has become too commercial-saturated over the years.
Podcasting is currently being presented as an alternative to the same tired
stuff you hear on the radio. Do your part to keep it fresh — and keep the
commercial time to a minimum.
While no hard-and-fast rule exists (and some podcast audiences are more 
tolerant of commercials than others), one useful approach is to follow the
15/30 rule: For every 15 minutes of podcast content, you can run up to 30 sec-
onds of advertising. No, people aren’t sitting around with stopwatches ready
to hand out demerits if you play an ad before the 15-minute mark. This is
simply a general rule for trying to figure out how many commercials to run.
Of course, you can skirt this rule somewhat if you do something a bit differ-
ent with the advertising you run. But at that point you’re moving away from
traditional advertising and entering into the realm of sponsorships.
Getting a sponsor
Sponsorship and advertising are often used as interchangeable terms, but
they’re actually distinct approaches with different requirements. For the pur-
poses of this discussion, we consider sponsorship as a relationship you (the
podcaster) have worked out with an organization that regularly funds — and
has a vested interest in the success of — your show. (Obviously, you can’t
say that about all advertisers.)
253
Chapter 13: Show Me the Money

Sponsorships were popular — almost to the point of exclusivity — in the old
days of radio in the early 20th century. During that time, corporations would
actually create the various radio programs as an advertising vehicle — they
could even censor content if (for example) some writer goofed and had the
villain using the sponsor’s product. Modern-day advertising deals, which
allow a station or program to drop a 30-second ad into its already-established
programming, came into play much later; these days such deals dominate
the scene.
Traditional media sponsorships have all but disappeared, and their last bastion
can be found in the lucrative world of daytime television: They have morphed
into . . . the dreaded infomercial. No, we’re not suggesting that you turn your
podcast into an infomercial for anyone. However, if you are catering to a very
niche audience and a corporate entity can service the needs of your audience,
that angle may be worth considering.
Understand that obtaining a true sponsor for your show likely means you
give up some creative control. Instead of paying you a few dollars to run a
pre-produced ad, your sponsoring corporation underwrites your entire show,
or at least a significant portion of it. Rather than getting you to take a break
from your content while you talk about its product for a few moments, your
content becomes dedicated to talking about its product.
Two notable examples of this “pay-for-podcasting” model are the Disneyland
Resort podcast (disneyland.com/podcast) and the (albeit short-lived)
Heineken Music podcast (www.heinekenmusic.com). In both cases, the cor-
porations underwriting the program are heavily involved with the content.
If you’re thinking about approaching a corporation to underwrite your show,
you need to provide much of the same information necessary for securing
advertisers, as discussed earlier. In addition, you need to demonstrate how
your show can help bolster the success metrics of the corporation. “It’s a cool
show that your customers will love” probably won’t cut it.
There is no secret sauce that irresistibly attracts corporate sponsorship.
Each corporation has distinct goals and objectives. Any podcast trying to
solicit sponsorship would be well served to understand these goals and
objectives inside and out, and be prepared to clearly demonstrate how 
sponsoring a podcast can help the company achieve those goals.
Asking Your Listeners for Money
There is one group of potential financial backers out there who could care less
about your fancy media kit: your listeners. They couldn’t give a hoot about
your anticipated growth curve in subscribers or your ratio of direct download-
ers to feed-based audience. They do have a vested interest in your continuing
254
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

to produce the very best possible show, each and every episode — and they
are (usually) content to let you take the show in the direction you feel it
should go.
Sometimes your show is important enough to them that they’re willing to
pony up. That’s why the following section discusses some novel ways you
can go about soliciting your listeners for funds to help offset some of the
costs of creating a podcast.
Please don’t turn your podcast into a weekly telethon. Most people tolerate
the time when NPR goes into pledge-drive mode, but no one looks forward to
it. If you’re going to ask your audience for money, do it tactfully and as rarely
as possible. Please.
Gathering listener donations with PayPal
Some of your audience will so love your show that they’ll happily hand over
some of their hard-earned money — if you’ll only ask.
Asking for listeners’ support is a two-step process: First you ask for the
money, and then you provide an easy and convenient way for your listeners
to send you money. PayPal (www.paypal.com) has been handling small and
large Web-based transactions for years. A PayPal donation link can be fully
integrated in to your Web site with minimum hassle. Here’s how:
1. Log in to PayPal.
If you don’t have a PayPal account, click the Sign Up link at the top of
the page and follow the simple instructions. You need a valid credit card
to sign up.
As this book was written, PayPal modified the navigation of the following
pages. This chapter has been edited to reflect those changes, but please
note that the flow may be slightly different in the future. Regardless, the
steps you need to follow are basically the same.
2. From your Account Overview page, click the Merchant Tools tab.
The Merchant Tools section allows you to set up a variety of ways
people can send you money.
3. Click the Donations link in the Key Features box on the right side of
the page.
You may also find this link under Website Payments elsewhere on the
page.
4. Enter a donation name and donation ID in the appropriate text boxes.
For the donation name, enter the name of your podcast, followed by
Donation (for example, Bob’s Fishing Podcast - Donation). Use
the same information for the ID field.
255
Chapter 13: Show Me the Money

You can also use the ID field to denote multiple types of donations, or
donations for different shows in the event you produce more than one
podcast. You can put anything you want in this field, but keep in mind
that it will be visible to those making donations — so make sure it isn’t
something confusing.
5. Enter a set donation amount if you want.
If you want your listeners to donate a set amount, chose that amount
here. If you leave this field blank, your users will have to enter an
amount before they donate. You decide which is best for you. Also,
change the designated country if you’d like your currency to be some-
thing other than U.S. dollars.
If you’re familiar with using HTML forms, you can later add a suggested
donation amount, and allow your listeners to change the amount if they
desire. Get a copy of HTML For Dummies if you need help with editing
forms.
6. Select the style of Donation button you would like to use.
If you have a custom button, here’s the place to change it. If you don’t
have one, don’t worry. The default button works just fine on your Web
site, and you can always change it later if you want.
7. Set the encryption to No.
If you are confident you won’t want to change any of the settings given so
far, you may set the encryption to Yes. We prefer to leave it unencrypted,
so we can later edit any options without having to re-create a button from
scratch. Also, turning encryption off allows PayPal to create a simple-to-
use URL for your donation page that you can add to e-mails and show
notes.
8. After you fill in the fields on the Donations page (as shown in
Figure 13-1), click Create Button Now.
9. On the Add a Button to Your Website page, you have some decisions
to make about the custom HTML code for your button:
If you’re comfortable doing some minor editing of the HTML that makes
your Web site work, then copy the HTML you see in the first box — and
add it to your page.
If you think editing HTML is a little beyond you just now, then simply
copy the text in Link for Emails and include it in your show notes. You’ll
want to make it a hyperlink, so don’t just leave it like this:
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=evo%40dragonpage
%2ecom&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&charset=
UTF%2d8&charset=UTF%2d8
256
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

Instead, you want to enclose it with an <a href=””></a> tag and
include some descriptive text, like this:
<a href=”https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=evo%
40dragonpage%2ecom&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=
USD&charset=UTF%2d8&charset=UTF%2d8”>Donate to my show</a>
That should do it for the donation link.
Curious about what your donation page looks like to those who click the link?
Cut and paste the link into your browser and press Enter. If you want to
change the color scheme or add a logo, simply return to PayPal, choose
My Account➪Profile➪Custom Payment Pages, and set up a new style. It’s all
very point-and-click.
Selling stuff
Some podcasters offer merchandise for sale as a way to support their show
financially — T-shirts, hats, mugs, CDs, autographed pictures, you name it. If
it’s sellable, chances are some podcaster out there is selling it.

Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 
If you’re contemplating selling stuff via your podcast, you fall into one of two
groups:
 Those who have stuff to sell: Musicians, authors, artists, and craftspeople
fall into this category. For these podcasters, offering CDs, books, prints,
or other items to the listening audience can bring in significant revenue.
(Down the road, there’s no reason why it shouldn’t be possible to make a
living via podcasting — though nobody’s doing that just yet, as far as we
can tell.)
Once again, PayPal (www.paypal.com) can be very helpful in taking
away the technical hurdles for selling items online and integrating them
into your podcast and Web site. If you can master the process for setting
up online donations, you aren’t far from having PayPal work as your
entire online shopping cart. But this book is about podcasting, not about
PayPal. Luckily for you, Victoria Rosenberg and Marsha Collier have
already penned PayPal For Dummies.
 Those who need stuff to sell: For those podcasters who need stuff to
sell, CafePress (www.cafepress.com) is more than happy to step in and
offer its assistance. Remember the T-shirts and other stuff mentioned
earlier? You can go to the trouble of making those yourself, carrying an
inventory, and shipping the orders out as they trickle in — or you can let
CafePress take care of all that for you.
Setting up a CafePress storefront is a breeze, though it’s a highly config-
urable task, and how you set it up depends on what you want to sell. A
basic shop is free to set up and to use. Your listeners buy stuff with your
logo or design on it from the CafePress store, and CafePress pays you a
commission. It’s very simple, and requires only some quick setup infor-
mation from you to get started. Figure 13-2 shows a CafePress store for
The Dragon Page. It took about five minutes to set this up; CafePress
takes care of the rest.
Don’t expect to make huge tons of cash via CafePress. Unless you can con-
vince a large group of your listeners that they simply must have a $25 T-shirt
with your logo on it, we wouldn’t recommend quitting your day job just yet.
Fee-based subscriptions
Getting your listeners to donate a couple of bucks to you or buy your latest
CD is one thing, but getting them to shell out money for the privilege of listen-
ing to your show is another matter altogether.
Not that it isn’t a viable business model. For those of you with specialty con-
tent that people are already paying to hear, it can be a great way to expose
your information to a wider audience.

If you don’t have a pre-established following, this approach likely won’t help
you. If you do have a following, but have never required anyone to give you
money to hear what you have to offer, you may find yourself with less of a 
following afterwards. Use this option sparingly — and only if you really think
others are willing to give money to listen to your podcast.
One problem with charging people to access your podcast feed is that not all
podcatching clients support secure connections. Then not only do you have
to convince folks to pay you for the right to listen to your podcast, but you
also have to convince them to use a particular podcatcher so they can pay
you. Not very open and friendly — or likely to work well.
In an attempt to circumvent the issue, some podcasters may try giving out
the URL of the podcast feed only to those who have paid a fee. It doesn’t
take a rocket scientist to figure out how non-secure that option really is. An
address for an RSS feed is simply a link — something that’s pretty easy to
pass around till it gets posted on all sorts of Web sites.
There are options for secure RSS feeds, however. Implementing them gets
technical and complicated in a hurry, and goes beyond the scope of this
book. Instead, focus on building your show and making it the best you can.
After you have command of all the intricacies that go into creating a top-
notch podcast, then you can consider charging your audience a fee to listen.

In This Chapter
 Podcasting in the political arena
 Building an audience for your creative works
 Communities and tourism — soundseeing tour podcasts
“T
rue” podcasters bristle at the growing commercialization of podcast-
ing. With iTunes stepping into the podosphere and spotlighting many
corporate podcasts, the independent voices have voiced many concerns that
boil down to one: A “true” podcast is done for passion, not for profit. The move-
ment towards podcasting as a moneymaking venture goes against the grain of
a “true” podcast. The words, opinions, and emotions should all be aimed for
the listeners’ hearts and minds, not their wallets.
Well, yeah — and even as we cheer the sentiments of the purists, we have to
observe that sheer love of the medium isn’t all there is to it. Truth be told,
podcasting is the next great way to reach the consumer. It’s economical,
unobtrusive, and can be a great way to connect with your potential audience.
With time, patience, and nurturing, any mass-market technology — be it the
Internet, blogging, and yes, even podcasting — can be applied to promotion. For
example, Dave Slusher of the Evil Genius Chronicles (evilgeniuschronicles.
org), while very much against the big corporate machine (which, as he
observes, “dictates to the masses what they think they want to consume”)
is in fact a smaller-scale marketing machine for independent musicians,
presses, and films. His podcast features the work of musicians and writers
such as Michelle Malone, The Arts & Sciences, and Gentle Readers — and
each artist has a strong individual voice with Slusher. After all, both his show
and his show-related blog promote these artists’ endeavors, offering listeners
a whole new way to invest in their works.
Promotion and marketing in podcasting are still new to podcasting, and in
the eyes of larger corporations, podcasting is an unproven medium. Because
podcasting is “audio-on-demand,” there is no formal way to measure numbers,
feedback, and response in the same way radio and television advertisements
are tracked.

However, with Apple iTunes and its podcast subscriptions going from zero to
1 million in two days — match those numbers, J.K. Rowling! (Oh, wait a minute,
you did. Never mind . . . ) — the corporate world is starting to take notice, real-
izing that some independent podcasts are actually discovering new audiences
for their products (and broadening their existing audience) one MP3 at a time.
Podcasting and Politics
What some old-school politicians might once have snickered at, they’re start-
ing to take more seriously. The “podcasting fad” is beginning to catch the
attention of major political players, including some who may have scoffed at
blogging and even (if you can believe it) the Internet as ways to connect with
their constituencies. They’re starting to use podcasts to connect to the
people, and more importantly, to the young voters who can easily make or
break a victory at the polls.
What we’re defining in this section as a political podcast is a podcast hosted
by a political figure or an individual seeking a political office, not pseudo-
journalists, former comedic actors, or convicted felons spewing their opin-
ions for all to hear. Anytime a podcast goes public on the issues, its creator
walks a fine line between public servant and political commentator. The fol-
lowing podcasts all keep their content focused on the issues and less on what
they “feel” are the issues.
The first politician to use a politically themed podcast was John Edwards
(shown in Figure 14-1), the 2004 Democratic vice-presidential candidate.
Following the 2004 election, he launched One America Committee Podcast
with John Edwards. Found at www.johnedwards.com (also accessible via
www.oneamericacommittee.com), the podcast covers poverty, Internet law,
and environmental issues and encourages youth involvement in politics. Also
featured in this podcast is Elizabeth Edwards’ update on her current fight
against breast cancer and her efforts to raise awareness about the disease.
Edwards invited the world into his home with an intimate podcast that not
only gets political, but personal as well: “Elizabeth and I are both sitting here
at our kitchen table. The microphones are sitting on my four-year-old Jack’s
blanket that he sleeps with every night, so we feel very much at home, and
I hope you enjoy this discussion!”
If you’re a politician and you want to get in touch with the people (as a way to
respond when voters complain about poor communication with their represen-
tatives or the candidates running for office), why not invite the country into
your kitchen, offer them a cup of (virtual) coffee, and ask them to relax a bit?
The Edwards’s informal podcast humanizes them as public figures. Instead of
dishing up prepared statements from professional speechwriters, they can
offer American voters (and worldwide listeners) impromptu, candid, sincere
opinions on issues facing the country and the world.
262
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

Unlike other political commentary podcasts and talk-radio shows (for example,
Al Franken’s Air America, The Donkey Hunter, G. Gordon Liddy, Rush Limbaugh),
the One America Committee Podcast is a perspective on politics from some-
one with previous experience in holding an office, be it on Capitol Hill or in
City Hall.
Podcasting has now caught the attention of the govern-ator himself, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, who is now podcasting his weekly radio addresses (at 
features.governor.ca.gov/index.php/podcast). And the White House
has joined the podosphere with President Bush’s podcast (www.whitehouse.
gov/rss) of his weekly address to the country. In an interview with Business
Week, Democratic strategist Joe Trippi sees a time when podcasting will carry
the same impact and influence as blogs. “Podcasting is growing even faster
than blogging. I think podcasting is going to have a huge impact on the next
election cycle.”
When going political with a podcast (whether you’re running for the U.S.
Senate or podcasting your term as School Board representative), here are
a few things to keep in mind:
 Keep your podcast on a consistent weekly schedule. Monthly podcasts
don’t cut it; the tide of politics is in constant flux. Because time-shifting
(making use of the wee hours of the night) is part of what makes pod-
casting work, daily updates are less than practical; however, weekly

263
Chapter 14: Podcasting for Publicity

podcasts work well for ongoing political issues, and you can shape their
content to remain timely enough, week by week, to fit the podcasting
medium. Set a day for delivering your weekly message and stick to that
schedule.
 Focus on the issues, not the opinions. As mentioned before, a political
podcaster will always walk a fine line between public servant and politi-
cal commentator. John Edwards, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and President
George W. Bush all keep their podcasts focused on the issues. If they
were suddenly to start hammering away with opinion and commentary,
they’d become more like Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly, or Al Franken (whom
nobody elected). If you want politics as your podcast’s subject matter,
ask yourself whether you’re looking to help listeners understand the
issues accurately and take meaningful action, or whether you’re just rant-
ing and venting to entertain people who want their opinions reinforced. 
 Give your listeners a plan for action. When you cover the issues in your
podcast, provide possible solutions to the pressing matters of your com-
munity and your constituents. Whether you’re detailing blood drives or
fundraisers, or launching an awareness campaign for cancer research,
increase that divide between political figure and political commentator by
offering listeners ways they can get involved in the community and make
a difference.
Telling the World a Story,
One Podcast at a Time
The whole point behind promotion — be it for books, film, or other forms of
entertainment — is to win prospective target audiences (or build on existing
ones) with something new or a different take on a familiar commodity. For a
fraction of the cost of print advertisements and broadcast-media commer-
cials, podcasting opens up markets for your creative work — and can even
start to get your name into an international market. If you are an established
presence in the writing market (or any entertainment field), the fans you
have nurtured, with time, will not only eagerly support your podcast, but
also introduce your MP3s to reader groups, friends, and enthusiasts of the
subjects you’re writing about.
Allow us a personal account of the journey from podcasting fan to full-fledged
podcaster. When Podcasting For Dummies’ own Tee Morris was in the final
rewrites of Legacy of MOREVI (shown in Figure 14-2), his publisher made con-
tact online and said, “Okay, Tee, start thinking of neat promotional ideas for
Legacy.” Around this time, Evo and Michael, proprietors of The Dragon Page
(www.dragonpage.com), had started podcasting two shows — Cover to Cover
and Live Fire. Tee thoroughly enjoyed their podcasts and appreciated that
podcasting made the shows available on his time. As Tee considered all the
things he liked about podcasting, he began to consider recording MOREVI for
264
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

audio. After all, he’d been complimented several times on his live readings.
And as an actor who loved playing around with his Mac’s audio and video 
features, he figured . . . Why not?
So Tee called up Evo, and a plan began to form.
Cover art by Sans Talbot
The week of January 21, 2005, the Prologue of MOREVI: The Chronicles of Rafe &
Askana went online (www.teemorris.com/podcast) and so began a completely
new kind of promotion, different from what The Dragon Page had ever done
before: A chapter presented every Friday, as read by the author. Tee was unsure
what to think at first. Did a download necessarily mean a listener? He wondered,
“Who is listening? Is it generating interest in Legacy? Or in my other titles, for
that matter?”
The answer came after MOREVI’s conclusion — a review from SFFAudio.com,
a Web site featuring the latest releases in audio science fiction, fantasy, and

horror: “Swashbuckling action takes the main and heart-rending romance
builds slowly culminating right at the end . . . but though it might sound it,
MOREVI: The Chronicles of Rafe and Askana isn’t a traditional fantasy novel,
it is derring-do adventure set in a world that would fit well on a shelf next to
Eric Flint’s 1632verse alternate-history series . . . “ 
A traditional writer’s dilemma — balancing creative work against the work
you do to get heard or read — had taken on a new form. With all that time
and money invested in appropriate Web-host and audio equipment, could the
time and effort invested in a podcast be better spent writing another book?
The bigger question was, “Is a podcast of my novel really worthwhile?” 
With a spike in sales (which included a few international readers) via Amazon,
pre-orders for Legacy of MOREVI, and the sales at Westercon 58 in Calgary,
Alberta, Canada, Tee had an enthusiastic answer: Yes.
Podcasting can introduce your writings or your music to audiences world-
wide. For artists in more visual arts such as film, dance, painting, or sculpture,
podcasting can serve as an audio journal leading up to the premiere of your
work — or as a venue to promote your career. It’s an instant connection with
your audience, and a great way to build an audience by getting them to know
you on however intimate a level works best for you and your work. Planning a
strategy for this kind of promotion only helps your agenda:
 When podcasting for visual media, briefly describe the action for the
audience. In his hourly podcast for the SciFi Channel, Ron Moore adds
in his commentary on whichever episode of Battlestar Galactica happens
to be airing (www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast). He
does not take for granted, though, that people will always be watching
the episode along with its companion podcast. In only a few words and a
few seconds, he sets the scene of what’s happening in the episode, for
the sake of listeners who may listen to his podcast independently.
If you’re documenting your visual art, it will only take a moment to
describe what you’re doing. For the painter: “I am using green with just a
hint of black so we can make the eyes appear more unearthly, unnatural.”
For a dancer, “In reconstructing the Australian Aboriginal dance, you
must remain grounded and deep in your squats, more so than what is
normally seen in modern dance.” You don’t need to go into every minute
detail. Only a few words are needed to create a picture.
 For writers and musicians: edit, edit, edit. Awkward pauses, stammers,
and stumbled words are obstacles for a writer introducing his work to
the podosphere: They’ve gotta go! The approach is no different from
that of an independent musician who podcasts a rehearsal session or
a recording: You don’t want off-key instruments and vocalists missing
the high notes. Your podcasts need to sound sharp and clean. 
Musicians, no matter if it takes five takes or 50 takes, should have their
instruments in tune, lyrics clearly pronounced, and all notes sung on key.
Writers should enunciate, speak clearly, and (most importantly) enjoy
266
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

the manuscript. Each piece, whether music or printed word, should be
a performance that serves as your audition to a worldwide audience.
(While that may sound a bit nerve-wrecking, don’t think of it as walking
out on stage so much as building something fine to send out into the
world. Just have fun, and your audience will enjoy the ride with you.)
And if you need a refresher on the basics of editing, skip back to Chapter 5
for the primers on editing with Audacity and GarageBand. 
 Open or close your podcasts with a brief, off-script commentary. Scott
Sigler always kept his listeners on the edge of their seats with his pod-
cast of EarthCore (www.scottsigler.net), but he also connected with
his fans at the beginning of each episode, addressing them directly with
a brief message (less than five minutes). For example, he assured them
he wouldn’t hold the last chapter hostage, tantalized them with the
promise of a new podcast in the works, and announced the release
date of EarthCore in print. 
While Sigler does have a knack for action-packed storytelling, this connec-
tion with fans also helped people relate to the author, which added to the
intimate experience of a podiobook. Nothing is wrong with a quick “Thank
you for listening,” or even a brief “Here’s where I will be in the future for
signings . . . ” Let your audience know who you are, and they’ll show their
appreciation through their support of your current and future works. 
Keeping Good Company: Community
and Soundseeing-Tour Podcasts
Slice-of-life podcasts that encourage community among listeners and among
fans are podcasts for promotion. The promotion comes from word-of-mouth
advertising (“buzz”) that these podcasters generate from their thoughts,
comments, and opinions on their subject — be it traveling across Spain, daily
life in New York City, George Lucas’s Star Wars, or Joss Whedon’s Firefly.
Slice-of-life podcasts let the world into locations that listeners may be curious
about. After a few podcasts, you can even encourage listeners to experience
that corner of the-world-as-you-know-it.
Putting together a soundseeing tour
of your favorite destination
Rich Pav is your average, ordinary blogger, making his way through the not-so-
average or  ordinary Land of the Rising Sun. In Herro Flom Japan (www.herro
flomjapan.com), Rich frames his various travels and encounters with the
history, culture, and people of Japan in his own unique point of view.
267
Chapter 14: Podcasting for Publicity

According to his companion blog, Rich doesn’t consider his podcast to be a
true soundseeing tour — but his glimpses into Japan were compelling enough
for listeners to nominate Herro Flom Japan for the First Annual People’s
Choice Podcast Awards in that category.
Rich’s blog also offers some supportive advice to new podcasters: “I’m sure
there are lots of people who want to start their own podcast but a little voice
in their head says, ‘But what if people think I [stink] and they hate me?’ There
is no ‘if.’ Once your audience outgrows your circle of friends and family, some-
one out there is going to tell you just how bloody awful they think you are.
And the bigger you get, the louder they get. That’s the way it goes. You just
have to get used to it.”
Soundseeing tours are virtual walks down the sidewalks and side streets of a
foreign country and can promote the community of a city, region, or country
better than any brochure found in a travel agency.
Creating a podcast to bring 
together a community 
Community and tourism can go beyond a city or country. It can be based on a
shared interest. The Mousepod (mousepod.net), hosted by Jesse Obstbaum,
is a podcast by a Disney fan, for Disney fans (see Figure 14-3). Jesse’s 45- to 
60-minute podcast is a journey into fond memories (and sometimes harsh
truths) about the Walt Disney Corporation. He is not a fan who believes all is
perfect with the Worlds that Walt Built, but Jesse does look back with rever-
ence to the times when Walt Disney was still around, creating the characters
that kids everywhere (and the kids still inside the grown-ups) can now look
on and smile. Jesse also interviews Disney fans, asking about their favorite
memories, which can include a favorite movie, a memorable Wonderful World
of Disney, or a trip to Disneyland or Walt Disney World. What makes Jesse’s
podcast more of a community than the musings of one fan preaching to
Goofy’s choir are the listeners who are contributing content for the sake of
the show.
On the 50th Anniversary of Disneyland, fans of The Mousepod recorded and
submitted to Jesse’s Web site some slice-of-life moments from the Opening
Gala. Although Jesse was unable to be there to experience the celebrations,
these Mousepod fans banded together to become part of the podcast.
Jesse is not consciously assuming a spokesman role, but he is encouraging
other Disney fans to join him in his celebration of Disney fans — the same
community of fans who visit the park properties, buy the DVDs, and tell their
friends about their experiences.
268
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

Another way of bringing a community together is to ask listeners what they
think of various topics before recording your podcast, and then base your next
podcast on that feedback. This is the strategy that hosts Kade Hutchinson and
Kevin L. Pratt adopted for their podcast, alienEthOS: The Ethics of Sci-Fi (www.
alienethos.com), a different kind of science-fiction-and-fantasy podcast.
Instead of just talking about their favorite movies, books, or latest trends in
the genre, Kevin and Kade explore the ethical issues in science fiction movies,
TV shows, books, and comics.
Ethical issues? In science fiction and fantasy? Are these guys serious? Oh,
yeah — but they do manage to get in a few laughs along the way. (Kade does
a mean Dame Shirley Bassey impersonation.)
alienEthOS explores issues raised throughout science fiction and fantasy. For
example, how humanely should the human race regard — and treat — the
“new” Cylons on Battlestar Galactica? (It’s another way of asking, “What is
human and how should we treat each other?”) Or, for that matter, can Harry
Potter’s House Elves handle equal rights and freedoms — can a society have
a servant class and still be considered ethical?
The show also looks at the relevance of such questions to current headlines
and society and then extrapolates the message and meaning that fans can
take from it. alienEthOS describes itself as “a community-driven show with
comments and voice mails from our listeners,” which the hosts pull off by
petitioning responses from their audience on topics posted on their Web site.
From here, the podcast is built. Eventually, the hosts foresee Skype interviews
with authors, producers, and celebrities of the genre contributing content, as
well as simultaneous podcasting with one show podcasting the topic from
their perspective and alienEthOS taking its own slant on the same topic. But
no matter how far or fast this podcast evolves, the community and its opin-
ions will always remain its core focus.

Chapter 14: Podcasting for Publicity

Soundseeing tours and community podcasts cover a wide range of audiences.
Both approaches share a mindset and some “sound” production principles:
 Don’t rely on the environment to be the podcast. Part of a soundseeing
tour is the ambient noise. The atmosphere of a marketplace, the rumbling
of a train and various announcements to its commuters, and even the
traffic passing by builds the world (or the part of it you are presently
occupying) around you. But a soundseeing tour should not be you simply
walking through your local downtown or social hot spot, recording the
world passing you by. There should be commentary accompanying your
podcast because even though it is a window to your world, the podcast
centers on you as a walking frame of reference. You are the host. Your
thoughts, opinions, and observations are driving this podcast, and the
environment is working with you to create a complete picture. Feel free to
comment on what you see and allow yourself a chance to explore. Always
remember, the podcast is driven by, guided by, and centered around you.
 You are the host, but it’s not all about you. This may sound like we’re
contradicting the previous bullet point, but we are merely reminding you
that community-based podcasts should be about the community. Yes, there
is room for personal thoughts and commentary, but in small doses.
The podcast is about the community and how it interacts with the world
around you; that is what the content should focus on. Your podcast can
feature other members of the community who share the same opinions
as yours or even take opposing viewpoints (a spirited debate can liven
up your show). Just remember that the community-based or soundsee-
ing tour is not about you personally, but about how you see the world,
how that connects with the people around you in the community,
and how all that comes together in the pursuit of a common interest.
 Avoid the negative. Particularly with community-based podcasts such as
The Mousepod and The Signal (signal.serenityfirefly.com/signal.
php), it would be easy to turn a podcast into a gossip column or a per-
sonal rant against the very concept that brought the community into
being. While there is no law or ethic barring you from speaking out or
voicing concerns, a community is based on support. Whether you con-
sider yourself a fan of Harry Potter, Apple Computers, or Prince William
County, your goal in a community podcast is to remain positive and cele-
brate the benefits of being part of the cooperative spirit. If there is a
matter of concern in your community, then there’s room for debate and
action, and as with a political podcast, be sure to offer some possible 
solutions to these issues. 
Regardless of the kind of community you’re chronicling, your podcast should
work much like glue — helping to keep supporters together in the face of
problems (instead of just crying in your collective beer) and celebrating what
gives them joy. Reinforce that sense of community and keep your podcast
strong.

Chapter 15
Podcasting for Passion
In This Chapter
 Connecting with the passion of the cast
 Asking “Why do we do it?”
 Keeping the passion alive in your own podcast
O
ur mission from the beginning of this book has been to fill you in on
what a podcast is, demystify the technical aspects of getting your voice
heard on MP3 players around the world, and assure you that anyone with the
drive can get their message across with the right tools. But a podcast is empty
if you don’t have that drive or that passion to get your podcast up and run-
ning and keep it running — whether the episode goes out every week, every
other week, or monthly. We drop that word a lot in the previous chapters:
passion. What do we mean by “podcasting with passion”?
Okay, if you take the dictionary as a starting point, passion means a keen
interest in a particular subject or activity, or the object of somebody’s intense
interest or enthusiasm. You can have state-of-the-art audio equipment, hire
the most engaging vocal talent, and employ the best engineers, but that isn’t
what makes a podcast a podcast. The artists and creativity behind a podcast
make an investment — not simply financial or physical — and collect the
windfall in listener feedback and download stats.
Yes, a podcast can make money, promote a cause, or bring attention to social
issues, but without that passion, you might as well sit behind a microphone
and read the instruction manual to your mobile phone. Passion is what moti-
vates relative unknowns to slip on the headphones, step up to the microphone,
and let their words fly.
This chapter won’t presume to show you how to create, cultivate, or conjure
your own passion. It’s something you have, or you don’t, for a given topic —
and we suspect everybody has it for some topics. Instead, we offer some real-
world examples of how others apply their passions to podcasts — and some
tools to apply a little passion-power of your own.

The Philosophical Question for All
Podcasters: Why Do We Do It?
It’s going to come up sooner or later: Someone will question your motives,
rationale, and even sanity at your investment of so much time and energy into
this newfangled thing called podcasting. We highly recommend deep nonsensi-
cal answers such as “It’s because of the cheese” be returned to these people.
Then watch their eyes start to twitch. That never stops being funny.
Gaining perspective on passion
Mur Lafferty does not make a penny off her popular podcast, Geek Fu Action
Grip (geekfuactiongrip.com). Her plan — as a freelance writer for maga-
zines, gaming companies, and other print venues — is to make a living at
writing, eventually selling her first novel for publication. In addition to her
contribution to the Dragon Page’s Wingin’ It! (dragonpage.com), Geek Fu
Action Grip (shown in Figure 15-1) delivers original (and playfully witty)
essays that bring a smile to your face — along with a slightly different per-
spective on the world.
Logo created by Angi Shearstone
These essays showcase a unique and refined voice — and Mur is giving these
essays away for free! For free? What is she thinking? Wouldn’t Mur be making
a fortune selling these essays to magazines and newspapers? Conventional
wisdom (such as it is) would say so; some writers would scoff at her for giving
away quality work, or think it smarter if she “threw a bone” out for free and
saved her really good work for paying markets.
While it is always good to make money at what you love, what good is it to
offer your work for sale if no one knows what you’re capable of? Following the
same ethic, Mur offers original essays for Wingin’ It and then writes her own
Figure 15-1:

for Geek Fu Action Grip. “I wanted to contribute something to the podosphere
that wasn’t there already,” Mur says in response to the inspiration behind
Geek Fu Action Grip. “No one was reading essays, much less geek-oriented. I’ve
gotten a lot of good feedback, and now I like to take that feedback and make
the podcast better. I podcast because it’s a good outlet for my thoughts and
my writing. I’ve met some awesome people and it’s made my writing better.”
By offering to the world her essays, Mur not only sharpens her craft, but also
lays the groundwork for a fan base — a devout group of listeners who will
happily invest in her future works if they’re ever offered for a price. Her name
is also beginning to become more known in the writing and gaming circles,
and now her talents are attracting editors, landing her opportunities to write
for one of her favorite publications, Knights of the Dinner Table, and read
short stories aloud for The Escape Pod (escapepod.info).
But is future opportunity the only reason Mur podcasts?
Hardly. What makes Geek Fu Action Grip a delight to listen to is Mur’s enthusi-
asm behind every podcast. For the Durham, N.C. mother, gamer, writer, and 
all-around-geek, her podcasts serve as a catharsis for the random events in life
that catch her attention: “The knowledge that there are people who are looking
forward to my podcast really means a lot and does a lot to motivate me. I know
a lot of podcasters have had the problem of not receiving sufficient feedback. A
nice e-mail here and there really means a lot to keep people going. Also there’s
just the old ego thing — if I think I have something to say, I’ll podcast about it.”
Her “audio blogging” comes across more like a portable, personal, stand-up
comic — making light of something that the world is paying way too much
attention to, or poking a little fun at herself when she contradicts herself.
This enthusiasm comes out in her writing and in the delivery of her writing,
and it’s what makes Mur’s podcast an enjoyable ride with every new upload.
Whether Mur’s wisdom was planned from the start or not, it offers some
good take-aways for the budding podcaster:
 Always look for a unique angle. The last things we need are carbon
copies of other podcasts or (perish the thought) wacky morning DJs. If
your passion is commonplace, focus on a niche or small aspect that you
have the most knowledge about.
 Step beyond your comfort zone. No one expects you to be a trained
voice actor. All they expect is for you to talk about your passion with
authority and sincerity. Remember, you’re only trying to appeal to
people who care.
 Don’t get preachy. Passion and authority are fine, but don’t cross that
line into assuming you know more than everyone else. Unless you’re
putting together a sermon or series of lectures, speak in the common
tongue and with respect to your audience. If we want to be talked down
to, we can always tune in certain talk-radio hosts.

Chapter 15: Podcasting for Passion

Podcasting passion with a purpose
Speaking of fun and exciting (and, okay, escapist) rides, the EarthCore podcast
(scottsigler.net/earthcore) might have escaped notice had it not been
for the passion behind its production. True, its author (shown in Figure 15-1)
found a terrific hook when he described his science-fiction thriller as “24 meets
Predator” — but even his promotions convey the edge and vitality in his voice.
Scott Sigler — whose novel-in-installments is, hands down, the most success-
ful of the podiobooks initially offered by www.podiobooks.com — set out to
show that a book in audio format did not have to be a guy in a soundproof
booth simply reading the manuscript. “I podcast because it’s the perfect 
vehicle for serialized fiction,” Sigler says of his decision to podcast his debut
novel. He seeks not only to hook listeners with the format, but also to keep
them in suspense till next week’s episode: “My novels are long, with cliffhang-
ers at the end of each chapter. That’s designed to keep you turning the pages.
With podcasts, you just have to wait for the next episode.”

Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

Scott’s nostalgia for radio-style serials is not the only motivation behind his
podcast. “The amazing reaction I get from the listeners is the motivation,” 
he adds, acknowledging his loyal fan base. Scott Sigler’s avid listeners affec-
tionately refer to his podiobook as EarthCrack (probably because they’re
hooked), and keep him meeting those delivery deadlines for uploads and
even resort to bribes as they try to get a sneak peek at what’s coming up next
before other subscribed listeners hear it. “To know that my fiction has enter-
tained thousands of people, helped them escape from their day-to-day lives,
and just plain have some fun means the world to me. Is it a power trip? Sure!
But knowing that I’ve delivered a great story and entertained someone is a
fantastic feeling.”
Even if you aren’t putting out a podiobook (which we highly recommend),
Scott showcases some excellent attitudes and approaches that would serve
many podcasters well:
 Cultivate feedback. Don’t sit on your heels hoping someone will e-mail
you. Put together a contest, solicit information, and generally get out
there and ask people what they think.
 Respond in a timely manner. If you’re going to ask, you can’t ignore the
responses. When someone takes the time out of his or her busy sched-
ule to e-mail you feedback — positive or negative — be sure to respond.
Sooner rather than later, please.
 Have your audience spread the word. Who better to seek out people
who might like your podcast than those who already love what you do?
Assuming these people have friends, have them toss a little love your
way by getting their friends to listen. Ask them to burn your show onto
a CD and pass it around. Make it easy for others to listen!
Practice makes perfect passion
Then there are podcasters like Nicole Simon. No essays. No whirling blades of
blood-splattering death. Her podcasts are podcasts-for-the-sake-of-podcasting —
which make her voice (and others) familiar, if not yet wildly popular, in podcast-
ing circles. Embracing her title as “one of the sexiest voices in podcasting,”
Nicole Simon of www.useful-sounds.de sends out her occasional musings on
technology, podcasting, the Internet, and just about anything else that grabs her
attention. There is no agenda here. She does not have a book to promote, a writ-
ing career to launch, or even a desire to internationally network herself. This
native German speaker merely wishes to practice her English.
In episodes that last from 30 minutes to an hour, Nicole practices her skills of
grammar and vocabulary with her honest and open commentary. For Nicole,
her modest exercise in the English language was merely that: a modest exer-
cise. Then came the 2005 Reboot — a yearly conference (held in Copenhagen,
Denmark) that focuses on advances in the Internet, unconventional thinking
275
Chapter 15: Podcasting for Passion

centered around communication, and new advances in telecommunication.
Suddenly Nicole found herself an unexpected celebrity among the keynote
speakers, many of whom recognized her — and a few of whom were regular
listeners to her podcast.
Another aspect of Useful Sounds that keeps Nicole Simon podcasting is not
the notoriety — or even the bilingual feedback from her English- and German-
speaking listeners. It is merely the desire to broaden her own communication
skills. There is also a sincere joy in sharing with the world a look into her
world, voicing opinions on things that matter to her.
If you plan to use a podcast to practice something, here are a few tips to keep
in mind:
 Stop apologizing, already. Mention early in your podcast that you’re
new at this language/game/career and then get on with it. The idea is to
podcast about it, not belabor the fact that you are new.
 Don’t pretend to be something you are not. No one has all the answers
every time, and when you’re learning a skill, you’re going to make mis-
takes. Embrace them, laugh about them, and podcast them. But for
heaven’s sake, don’t try to cover them up because the real experts out
there will call you on it every time.
Passion comes in all shapes and sizes
Also never short on opinions — or providing glimpses into his corner of the
world(s) — is science-fiction author Paul S. Jenkins. (Or would he call what
he writes speculative fiction?) His bimonthly podcast RevUp Review (www.
rev-up-review.co.uk) — launched in March 2005 — provides listeners
with a review of books, movies, podcasts, and music. The RevUp Review is
not only a review of all things speculative, but also a revue of music available
at the Podsafe Music Network, soundseeing tours around his village and
around his home, and even a serialized presentation of his previously pub-
lished short stories. Is Paul trying to generate new interest in his own 
published works? Does he have an agenda in promoting the Podsafe Music
Network? There has to be an agenda here, doesn’t there?
Well, we don’t believe so. The RevUp Review (or “Revue,” depending on your
take on Paul’s approach) comes across as an hour with an old friend over a
pint at your local pub. Paul Jenkins’ passion comes through in the sincerity
behind his podcast — seasoned with a whimsical, almost mischievous,
approach. In one recent episode, Paul presented an alternative to the beer-
cast: a breadcast. The RevMaster (as he calls himself) welcomes the world
into his kitchen for a ten-minute segment of baking fresh bread, starting from
the beginning with measuring of water and breaking out the flour. Paul knows
this kind of soundseeing theater may not rivet action-addicts, but he isn’t
276
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

pressured to be aggressively entertaining all the time. You can hear in his
voice a genuine delight — in not only recording this culinary experience but
also sharing it with the world.
Paul’s approach to podcasting is easily adaptable for many:
 Don’t be afraid to explore new areas. Just because your podcast is
about fishing, it doesn’t mean that you can’t meander to rock climbing,
pickup-truck repair, or even the secret to marital bliss. Exploring new
areas can breathe new life into stale podcasts and even help you find
new areas of interest and expertise you didn’t even know you had.
 Keep it personal. If you’re going to go off on a tangent, make sure “you”
go along as well. Podcasting is as much a cult of personality as anything,
and your audience will forgive your wanderings if you take yourself, as
well as them, along for the ride.
Universal love for the podcast
What Paul, Mur, Scott, and Nicole all share in common is a true love for the
podcast. Mur could easily put her podcast on hold to finish writing. Paul could
give the Rev Up Review a hiatus if he wanted to go backpacking across his own
country or take the Chunnel and enjoy a holiday in Europe. Nicole might want
to pay a visit to the States, take in a bit of touring of her own. And Scott . . .
Well, in the case of Scott Sigler, we suspect that if he had stopped his podcast
of EarthCrack (oops, that’s EarthCore) before reaching the final chapter, the
legions of fans dedicated to his weekly adventure would have very well
crafted their own whirling blades of death, hunted him down, tied him to a
chair, and hit Record for him! (When you’ve got a jones, you’ve got a jones.)
But even if those fans weren’t there, Scott — along with podcasters like the
ones showcased here — would continue to record, produce, and upload
shows simply for the love of the podcast. These podcasters stand out in their
dedication — they apologize if a podcast doesn’t meet its promised schedule,
make the effort to improve production quality, and infuse enthusiasm into
every new show. It is this passion that brings the podcaster back to the
microphone and invites new podcasters (like you!) to take the host’s chair.
Holding Interest: Keeping a Podcast’s
Passion Alive
You have your podcast underway. You are planning to have a weekly show.
The first month in, you feel strong, confident. But this is all in the first four
episodes. How do you keep the momentum going? 
277
Chapter 15: Podcasting for Passion

In the early days of a podcast, you can easily see yourself continuing banter a
year from launch date — but remember, it’s 52 episodes you’re planning. Have
you taken into account sick days? Vacation? The occasional stumbling block
of inertia (“Do I really want to do a podcast today?”). Even the best bloggers
need to step away from their keyboards, recharge their own batteries, and
then jump back into their journaling. Personal health, well-being, and time to
edit postings if your postings need editing (and if you’re human, sometimes
they do) are factors you also must consider. Add in dealing with conditions
such as background noise and having to tax the strength of your voice, and
podcasting can become less of a joy and more like a chore or a second day
job. Plenty of podcasts begin strong out of the box, only to have their feeds
go silent, and remain so.
Even with passion, momentum is difficult to sustain. How do podcasters keep
that spark and drive alive? Well — as with the answers to “Why do we do it?” —
podcasters have a myriad of opinions and thoughts. Each show applies different
approaches and tactics to keep each new episode fresh; even amid diverse
topics, common threads can be found between all podcasts that provide the
momentum to forge ahead 50 episodes later.
Podcasting on puree: Mixing it up
After you rack up a few episodes of your podcast, take a look at its format.
How do you have it set up? Is it all commentary? What can you do to vary
the content?
Just because this is your first, second, third — or seventeenth, eighteenth, or
nineteenth — cast, it doesn’t mean you have set yourself in stone. (That’s
where you find the fossils of all sorts of creatures that didn’t manage to
evolve.) In this section, we look at ways to dodge that asteroid and keep your
show from suffering an extinction-level event.
Don’t be afraid to try different things with your podcast’s format. For example,
you might:
 Talk about a product, service, or idea that is only loosely related to your
normal focus.
 Interview a guest with a unique perspective on the focus of your show.
 Experiment with adding a co-host, even if only temporarily.
 Podcast from a “remote” location or from a “studio” if you normally do
remote shows.
The Dragon Page, hosted by one of your illustrious authors, has been in a near-
constant state of evolution since its inception nearly four years ago. It started
with a single host and acquired a second after eight shows. Things stayed con-
stant for a while, and then the hosts added a news segment to the show.
278
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

But news is too often (and too easily) boring, so one of the hosts ferreted out
the strangest news that was only loosely affiliated with the topic at hand —
science fiction and fantasy — and that was always a shock to the other host
(which tended to wake the episode right up). If that wasn’t strange enough,
they created a goofy little segment called “Feed the Dragon” where Michael,
Evo, and the occasional guest serve a person, organization, or even a concept
up for a sacrifice to an “in-studio dragon.”
Fast-forward through the years (time travel saves belaboring the point),
and we present a show that’s survived Internet radio, broadcast radio, live
remotes, and even podcasting. Your show may not have to go to elaborate
lengths to stay fresh, but it does need to heed the creed: Evolve or die.
Starting from scratch
Keeping the passion alive and well in one podcast can be found in variety —
and in allowing yourself to follow another passion in a second podcast. Okay,
that may double your workload, but it also keeps your perspectives fresh and
excited about what to focus on in upcoming podcasts.
If you have enough content to warrant a second podcast, don’t overload one
podcast with this new content; why burn out? If your gut instinct is telling
you to begin a second podcast, go for it. Variety, not only in a podcast’s 
original content but also between the different podcasts you create, can 
benefit both shows. Now, instead of the same old podcast every week, you
can allow yourself different avenues to explore — and maybe a whole new
audience.
Two real-world examples show how this can be done effectively. After focus-
ing on books and authors for so many years, Michael and Evo were looking
for new areas on which to focus and new listeners to attract. They found a
willing audience with — oddly enough — an unfilled niche (more like a huge
podcast hole): sci-fi TV and movies.
Attaching themselves to arguably the most enthusiastic of all fan crowds —
Star Trek geeks — Michael and Evo created Slice of Scifi (sliceofscifi.com),
a podcast-only show that quickly grew into an overnight success.
If you’re thinking about branching out with a new show, consider these tips:
 Take your audience with you. If you’re podcasting about lawn bowling,
yet hold a secret passion for seventh-century Gaelic text, expect only a
handful of folks to subscribe to both shows. However, if you move from
lawn bowling to a podcast on sports medicine, they may find the new
topic an easier pill to swallow.
279
Chapter 15: Podcasting for Passion

 Cross-promote. Even if your podcasts are quite close in scope, there will
be listeners to one who aren’t aware of the other. Although we caution
against turning one podcast into a giant commercial for the other, plug
the heck out of your other show. Within reason.
 Keep trying. Don’t expect to hit your stride in the new show by Episode 2.
You’ll have to try different formats, flavors, and ideas over there, just the
way you did to make your first show perfect. (Or is it? Maybe it’s getting a
little stale. Time to spruce that one up, too.)
It’s pretty safe to say that Mur Lafferty has carved out a niche for herself
with Geek Fu Action Grip, but even Mur is discovering that need to branch
out. Even as broad as her show is, certain topics in her life just don’t fit com-
fortably into her audio blog and essay show. In fact, she is finding one aspect
of her life — her daily pursuit of finishing her novel and landing a publishing
contract — difficult to cover in her current podcast. But the content for this
particular topic was accumulating, so Mur started up the I Should Be Writing
(shouldwrite.blogspot.com) podcast, which serves two passions: pod-
casting and writing.
I Should Be Writing is for writers who are all in the same boat as she is, rowing
like mad toward that elusive publishing contract while struggling to finish
that first novel. Here Mur addresses writers who feel her pain — and other
listeners who may be curious about people who write novels (and the
process behind the book) — and imparts what she’s learning in her quest to
complete that first draft. It is not a podcast on how to publish a novel but a
way of documenting the road to a publishing contract. Hopefully. Listeners
will keep track with Mur on daily word count, and (no doubt) will help keep
her honest about setting aside time for writing. Writers also working toward
that contract will benefit from hearing the true-life struggles of another writer
on the same path and may provide some insights. The balance among pas-
sion, creativity, and community is worth thinking about.
Mur’s efforts bring up two points especially worth mentioning:
 Your next podcast may be closer than you think. Keep a close eye on
your feedback; look for recurring themes that your audience likes to hear.
If it’s a broad enough topic and you can speak on it with authority, you
may be able to craft a show around audience suggestions instead of
having to sweat bullets to come up with something brand new every time.
 Look for the niche within the niche. If your main topic is broad, break it
out into chunks and see what needs further exploration. Granted, a deep
dive into the minutiae of a niche topic may reduce the size of your listen-
ing audience. But so what? This is about exploring your passion, not
about gaining market share. And (we promise) there’s always someone
else out there who will want you to delve even deeper into the obscure
topic you’ve just built an entire podcast around.
280
Part V: Pod-sibilities to Consider for Your Show 

Reinventing yourself
Apart from inventing a new podcast to keep the passion alive, another option
is to continuously reinvent your podcast to where audiences have no idea
what will be coming up next. Here are some ways that you can do that:
 Feature a different guest host each week
 Have contributors develop content for you
 Ask your listeners for topics
If you subscribe to Area 51 (area51show.com), you know what to expect —
splatter-style, envelope-pushing, completely bizarre commentary from the
cast and crew of this comedy review. When you plug into Requiem of the
Outcast (www.requiemoftheoutcast.com), it’s a safe bet that you’ll get an
earful of silliness, sarcasm, and satire, some of it inspired by adventures in
the Star Wars community. Listeners come to your podcast with a certain level
of expectation even though the content is new and fresh every time.
And then there’s the podcast Cyberpunk Radio (www.mental-escher.net/
cyberpunkradio), a podcast that continues to define, challenge, and then
completely reinvent itself on every cast. From the hosts of Mental-Escher, who
are based out of the San Francisco Bay area, Cyberpunk Radio is an intriguing
goulash of science fiction, virtual reality, surrealism, audio montages, and
social commentary . . . or is it? Even after several episodes you may not
know and like it anyway for its edgy and original take on podcasting, or you
may find the first few episodes a complete waste of space on your computer.
It’s not a podcast for everyone — a few episodes are hardly what you’d call
family-friendly — but how many creative minds are this committed to creat-
ing a world in the distant future of next week? The artists at Mental-Escher
conjure another world, another time — an alternate reality where machines
rule over man (though sadly they don’t look or act like the pretty people in
Battlestar Galactica).
The passion behind this podcast is the challenge to constantly reinvent the
content, creating unpredictable programming for the subscribers. Of course,
the risk in alienating your listeners who are seeking normalcy and standardiza-
tion in a podcast (to an extent) is ever present, but then again a podcast like
Cyberpunk Radio might not be for them. This type of podcasting is podcasting
for podcasting’s sake, and the podcasters themselves keep their passion alive
by continuously changing the format of their own show. Along with delivery
of new content, it’s an entirely different presentation of new content, part of
what makes Cyberpunk Radio an intriguing, if not mysterious, listen.
Re-invention for the sake of re-invention isn’t a bad idea, but it’s so twentieth-
century. You may find it a better idea to move forward with a plan. So here
are a few dos and don’ts — with the don’ts first.
281
Chapter 15: Podcasting for Passion

What NOT to do (ack! run away! run away!) . . .
 Don’t use shock-radio techniques. Hearing a podcaster drop a few words
that would make most grandmothers blush isn’t anything new, and it’s a
cheap way to get a laugh and attention. Neither of your authors has any
moral compunction against the more colorful aspects of the English lan-
guage, but try to use them sparingly, okay?
 Don’t go from kid-friendly to adults-only. If you’re unhappy being a
family show, give some advance notice so folks can unsubscribe. Hell
hath no fury like a mother scorned (or even unpleasantly surprised) . . . 
 Don’t get angry when you get dissenting e-mail. Not everyone will be
happy with your decision to change things around or to add a new 
segment. Deal with it and move on. You can’t please everyone — or 
“correct” their opinions — so don’t even try.
What to DO with all your might . . .
 Cast your net wide. Be open to a variety of new ideas and concepts, and
don’t be afraid to try them out on your audience. Your loyal listeners
will likely forgive you a few miscues along the way.
 Have a purpose for the change or addition. Find the common con-
nection with what your show has focused on before and talk to your
audience about it. You can do this before or after the “newness” goes
in the show, but your listeners will enjoy knowing the method behind
your madness.
 Encourage feedback about the change. When you do this, ask more
than “do you like it?” Find out if your audience feels differently about
your show, if they think it’s “fresher” or perhaps more appealing — and
why. The changes you put in place are designed to give your show a
boost; be sure and ask for confirmation that it actually happened!
If you find yourself in need of a break, there’s nothing wrong with taking some
time out. As a courtesy to those who are listening, however — whether it’s 20
or 20,000 — let them know you’re holding off on new episodes for a few weeks
so you can reorganize priorities, goals, and the whole momentum of your 
podcast to make it even more rewarding for them to listen to. The same cour-
tesy applies when you’ve had an unexpected illness: Give your listenership a
quick update on what happened; reassure them that your voice is back and
that your podcast is back. As passionate as you may be about a podcast,
always remember your health and your voice must come first. There’s nothing
wrong with missing a week or two of a podcast while you get back up to par.

Truth and Honesty in Podcasting
“To me, ultimately, martial art means honestly expressing yourself. Now it is
very difficult to do. I mean it is easy for me to put on a show and be cocky
and be flooded with a cocky feeling and then feel, then, like pretty cool . . .
and be blinded by it. Or I can show you some really fancy movement — but,
to express oneself honestly, not lying to oneself — and to express myself
honestly — that, my friend, is very hard to do.”
—Bruce Lee, from an interview on The Pierre Berton Show
When Tee was writing the first draft of this particular chapter, he had playing
in the background Bruce Lee: The Way of the Warrior, a (really cool) documen-
tary featuring recently discovered footage from his work-in-progress Game
of Death, rare commentary from The Dragon himself, and interview footage.
In one of the interviews came the preceding quote — a compelling moment
when Bruce Lee sums up, in his own words, what martial arts means from his
perspective. As Tee pondered his words, it struck him that Bruce was basi-
cally saying, Martial arts is all about keeping it real.
And (for whatever reason) he blurted out loud, “If Bruce Lee were alive today,
he would have a podcast!”
Part of the passion in a podcast is cultivating honesty with yourself and your
audience, and that honesty in your podcast is what keeps listeners coming
back. “To thine own self be true . . .” — one of Shakespeare’s most-quoted
lines from Hamlet — holds as true for podcasting as it has for every other
intensely personal creative activity; let it serve as a mantra that fires up your
drive to produce a terrific podcast. Honest passion, and honesty in general,
cannot be faked in a podcast as many podcasters are producing their audio
content without any other compensation save for ratings on Podcast Alley
and Podcast Pickle, some feedback from listeners, and perhaps the occa-
sional donation. On the larger scale, podcasters, regardless of their agendas
or goals, are on the podcasting scene because they want to be there, and if
that honesty in wanting to deliver new content is even remotely artificial, 
listeners will pick up on that and also lose interest in your podcast. 
It’s okay to ask yourself, before hitting Record or getting that first take into
Audacity or GarageBand, “Do I know for sure what I’m getting into?” — or
(more to the point), “Do I really want to do this?” — but never ask yourself
whether you can do this. That is not even a question to consider. Podcasting
encompasses and welcomes voices of all backgrounds, all professions, all
experience levels (be they professional, semiprofessional, or amateur). You
can do this — and you have as much right to as any of us. All you need is the
mic, the application, the feed, and the host. From there, it all rests on you.
283
Chapter 15: Podcasting for Passion

Podcasting is a commitment of time and resources — to yourself and to your
listeners. It’s a promise you make to bring to the podosphere the best content
you can produce — and with the right support, passion, and drive, your pod-
cast will evolve, mature, and move ahead with the same zeal that inspired
the first episode. Accomplishing this feat rests on remaining honest in your
desire to sit behind the microphone and produce your next show. If you’re
not sure about the answers to “Do I know for sure what I’m getting into?” or
“Do I really want to do this?” ask yourself, “If I don’t want to be here, then why
would listeners want to download and hear my latest episode?”
“To express myself honestly — that, my friend is very hard to do.” Oh yeah,
Bruce Lee would have produced an incredible podcast.

Because podcasting is likely to change drastically in the

of ideas, thoughts, and philosophies from the authors to
take along on your podcasting trek. Chapter 16 helps to
guide you in your selection of podcasts to listen to for

The Best of the Best. In the podosphere, these higher planes are commonly
referred to as The Pod Squad, Podcast Pickle’s Favorites, and Podcast Alley
Top Ten List.
Where to begin? Where to begin? We sat down, and each put together our
own top ten lists of podcasts. What we found was that one of us swore by
some podcasts the other had never heard of, and vice versa. We started won-
dering, “How are we going to narrow this list down and eventually get it to
ten?” Then we took a closer look at our lists and realized “Hey, we’ve got a
pattern going on here!” Between the two of us, we had a solid cross-section of
types of podcasts, not just in the way of genres but in production values. So
with a quick edit of the outline and a change of mindset, we present the Top
Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out.
There are other kinds of podcasts that were, perhaps, not showcased here,
but with these ten kinds of podcasts as a starting point, you can easily begin
to fill playlists and MP3 player space. Once comfortable with what you hear,
you can then follow the “Favorite Podcasts” links that your podcast’s compan-
ion blog offers. From this list given here, you can sample a wide cross-section
of audio content. Relax, download, and give your ears a treat.

Tech Podcasts
If you’re thinking about podcasting, you likely have a comfortable knowledge of
computers, Web-surfing, and blogging. But regardless of how technologically
savvy you are, you can never stop learning. That’s why your aggregator should
be catching at least one tech podcast.
The agenda for a tech podcast is (surprise!) technology — usually computer-
oriented. All geek, all the time. Geeks, nerds, wizards, and Tech Help gurus sit
behind a microphone and pull back the curtain on how your computer works,
how to make a podcast’s RSS feed better, and how to make your time behind
the keyboard more efficient.
Tech podcasts come delivered to you in a variety of skill levels and on a vari-
ety of topics:
 Macs: Some excellent podcasts for Mac users include MacCast (shown
in Figure 16-1 and available at www.maccast.com), Your Mac Life
Podcast (www.yourmaclife.com), or MacPhilly Almost Live (www.
macphilly.com).
 PCs: Typical PC User (typicalpcuser.biz/tpcu/) and Darn PC
(www.darnpc.com/wordpress/) focus on the Windows environment
and its latest updates and upgrades.
 General computing: Many of the tech podcasts out there like This Week
in Tech (or TWiT, as it is so lovingly referred as by its hosts and listeners,
available at www.twit.tv/) or HomeNetworkHelp.Info are generic in their
approach to operating systems, following a mindset that a computer is a
computer and the rest is mostly bells and whistles.
 Technology perspectives: The Girl on Tech (girlontech.blogspot.com)
or The Chris Pirillo Show (www.thechrispirilloshow.com) give personal
perspectives on technology in society and go beyond the geek-speak,
giving their own perspectives on issues and how technology can affect
just about everything.
Whichever podcast you feed into your podcatching client, find a tech podcast
that is right for you and either enjoy the new perspective, or allow yourself to
grow into your geekdom. There is a lot to learn out there about computers,
PDAs, Bluetooth, and other cool Q Branch gizmos that are available at your
local electronics store. When you have the basics down, these podcasts
allow you to unlock their potential and go beyond your expectations.

Podcasting is audio content on demand, and after taking a listen to what is
being offered on the radio, that is a very good thing. Maybe it’s a hazard of
getting older, but some of us just aren’t hearing anything on the air that’s all
that interesting or exciting . . . unless we happen to find an alternative station
that has a few up-and-coming bands we’ve not heard of, or independent musi-
cians who are looking for the big break.
The good news is that those maverick sounds are alive and well and doing
just fine in the 21st century, and they’re finding a new promotion channel
with podcasting.
Independent labels, where the artists also work as promoters, producers, and
holders-of-all-rights, have control over where their music plays, how often it is
played, and how much it costs you. Many indie musicians who are having trou-
ble getting exposure and radio airplay can grant permission for podcasters to
use their music. What does this cost the podcaster? A few moments of time
and a spot or two, such as, “This music is brought to you by . . .” and “Visit
this band online at w-w-w-dot . . . .” And in return, the musician is exposed to a
worldwide audience.

Chapter 16: Top Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out

Musicians such as The Gentle Readers (featured on Evil Genius Chronicles at
www.evilgeniuschronicles.org), The Transfer (featured on EarthCore at
www.scottsigler.net), and Fumitaka Anzai (featured on the Rev Up Review
at www.rev-up-review.co.uk) have all enjoyed the benefits and windfalls of
associating themselves with a podcast. Now indie musicians are turning to
podcasts that not only are dedicated to the broadcast of podsafe music, but
also spotlight independent musicians whose sound goes against the corpo-
rate music industry’s notion of “what the public wants.” Here are a few such
podcasts you may want to check out:
 Bandtrax (www.bandtrax.net): Bandtrax serves as a radio station for
the independent label. Artists are invited to submit music and sell CDs
on the Bandtrax Web site.
 The tartanpodcast (www.tartanpodcast.com): Podcasting from
Glasgow, Scotland, Mark Hunter showcases unsigned or independent
label music in order to win an audience for these new artists.
 LoveHouse Radio (www.lovehouseradio.com): Based out of
Richmond, Virginia, host P.D. Love took his love of music, his apprecia-
tion for the independent artist, and his everyday life and turned it into a
podcast that highlights featured artists on the Podsafe Music network.
Many of these podcasts work together on the Podsafe Music Network (music.
podshow.com) to offer the podosphere a one-stop location to find postcasts
that showcase the innovative and creative minds of independent music.
Science Podcasts
The approach to science made popular by scientists like Carl Sagan and pro-
fessional experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman (hosts of the Discovery
Channel’s Mythbusters) is rampant in the podosphere. Here are some science
podcasts that we recommend:
 Slacker Astronomy (slackerastronomy.com): If you have always won-
dered about what is really going on beyond our atmosphere, take a listen
to a podcast descendant of the Carl Sagan Cosmos concept. For those
who would never leave the planet without their attitude, Aaron Price,
Pamela Gay, and Travis Searle dubbed the show Slacker Astronomy.
 Skepticality (skepticality.com): This podcast looks deeper into the
news too weird for mainstream media, and takes a critical microscope to
the pseudoscience of the paranormal, the supernatural, close encounters,
and urban legends.
290
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 The Science Show (www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/): Australia’s
Robyn Williams looks at all aspects of science, ranging from biology to
chemistry to everyday applications of scientific achievements.
Science shows are good for you — like vegetables, only better. Not only can
you learn something new or broaden your scope in a field you may regard as
a hobby, but you can marvel at how the hosts demystify concepts once com-
prehensible only to Ph.D.s and keep the ideas easy to grasp.
Educational Podcasts
Why not broaden your horizons with educational podcasting? For example,
say you’ve always wanted to learn Spanish. You could shell out some bucks
for the “Teach Yourself Spanish” series, or you could to listen to the free pod-
cast Really Learn Spanish (its companion blog is located at radio.weblogs.
com/0142338/). Instructor Johan van Rooyen takes his unconventional
teaching methods (mastered over a seven-year stint with teaching English
in Spain) and turns them into a podcast that features “star pupils” as special
guests who are looking to become more comfortable in the language many
of us take in high school but forget by the time we leave college! (Imagine
ordering at a Mom-and-Pop taqueria . . . and getting it right.)
If you are not interested in learning another language, take a look at some of
the other subjects offered in the podosphere. Here are just a few examples
of what’s available:
 History: HistoryPodcast (historypodcast.blogspot.com) is completely
devoted to history for the lovers of history. This is a feed you will want
to subscribe to. Or if you do wish for a more specific era of discussion,
my most gracious lord, check out the Medieval Podcast (podcast.
medievalstudies.info/).
 Money management: If you’re looking for advice on managing your
money, check out Radio Economics (www.radioeconomics.com). Or if
you have a friend or family member getting ready for that next step in
education, try Student Financial Aid News (www.financialaidnews.
com/blog/index.htm).
There is a lot to learn from the world, and whether you’re tuning in to one of
the numerous podcasts sponsored by universities and colleges or to an enthu-
siast who wants to share and swap resources with you, all this continuing
education is available online, in audio, and at no charge.

Comedy Podcasts
There are times in life when you just need a good laugh. One of the joys of
podcasting is having those good laughs categorized, digitized, and waiting
for your call, whether it is on the computer or your favorite MP3 player.
Humor, though, is in the eye of the beholder — or in this case, the ear of the
listener. Performing a search on “Comedy Podcasts” offers you many, many
choices, ranging from kid-safe comedy to adults-only. Some of the earlier pod-
casts cited (such as Slacker Astronomy and Skepticality) pepper their podcasts
with humor (always good to add), but straight-up comedy podcasts are not
intended to do anything other than entertain and perhaps make you think.
These podcasts cover a wide spectrum of humor. Here are a few comedy 
podcasts that we enjoy:
 The Bitterest Pill (thebitterestpill.com): Perhaps you like your
humor dry, witty, and maybe just a touch smarmy. Dan Klass and his
podcast, The Bitterest Pill, should do the trick. With his background in
stand-up comedy, Dan’s delivery is edgy and relentless. He takes a
hard, cold look at the world and makes observations that you might
think but would not have the courage to express openly. Dan not only
gives you his opinions but also podcasts them for the world to hear.
 Requiem of the Outcast (www.requiemoftheoutcast.com/
wordpress/): If you’re looking for something closer to family-friendly
and pleasantly geeky, give Rich Sigfrit’s Requiem of the Outcast a listen.
While it’s mainly a podcast by Star Wars fans for Star Wars fans, Rich’s
slightly twisted talent in comedy sketch writing appears and manifests
itself as wacky, goofball fan humor that can make even the casual fan
of science fiction chuckle. If it ever wanders beyond the realm of family-
friendly content, Rich and his cohorts Ron and Jamie Garner let folks
know about up-and-coming situations that are not for the young or the
squeamish.
 Area 51 (www.area51show.com): This podcast comes at you with guns
blazing, and if you’re not wearing Kevlar, then you’re going to feel it the
following morning. Making Monty Python seem like Bear in the Big Blue
House, Area 51 strides up to the boundaries of good taste.
Area 51 is not about alien conspiracies or science fiction. It’s a completely
irreverent, slapstick, and sometimes-graphic comedy show that is many
things, but family-friendly is not one of them. If you like your comedy in-
your-face and intense and challenging notions of what you can and can’t
get away with, then you have found a friend in Area 51.

Husband and Wife Podcasts
Comedy is prevalent in all the various genres of podcasting, especially with
husband and wife podcasts. After all, sometimes you need humor to deal
with your spouse. You can find a variety of husband and wife podcasts, and
here are a few we recommend:
 Honeymooners-type humor: “Playfully blunt” is a great way to describe
this kind of husband-wife podcast for it is a glimpse into how spouses
interact with one another, and there is a spirit of fun shared between the
genders. It’s as if you were listening to The Honeymooners being podcast,
and no matter what is said, no matter what jibe is hurtled, no matter
who scores the most lethal blow to the ego, it always ends with a heart-
felt “Baby, you’re the greatest,” a dip, and a kiss. Here are a few you may
want to check out:
• Croncast (croncast.com)
• He Said / She Said (www.hesaidshesaidpodcast.com)
• Illinoise (www.illinoise.net)
 Married with Children-type humor: While the love is still there (after
all, the couple that podcasts together stays together), the conversations
in these podcasts can turn to extremely detailed tangents on nocturnal
activities, embarrassing moments with ex-girlfriends, and other subject
matter that could be considered racy, raunchy, and just plain wrong on
many levels. Here are some fun podcasts that fit this bill:
• The Dawn and Drew Show! (dawnanddrew.podshow.com)
• Keith and The Girl (www.keithandthegirl.com)
Always check the listings to see how “playfully blunt” couples (in either list)
can get in their podcasts. Dawn and Drew do give a disclaimer on their home
page, a brief and simple warning that maybe, just maybe, they will dare to
tread paths that few choose. Many podcasts that deal with mature themes
(a nice and proper way to say “sex”) post disclaimers on their podcasts’ Web
sites or in their blogs’ show notes.
Soundseeing Tour Podcasts
Podcasts offer their listeners (as well as their hosts) an audio gateway to the
world. In a soundseeing tour, the world is depicted in the (described) sights
and live sounds around the host, offering listeners a virtual visit. Usually
293
Chapter 16: Top Ten Types of Podcasts to Check Out

armed with an iRiver, podcast hosts take their listeners for a trip out into a
familiar environment, hold conversations, and interact with the world around
them, recording events in the same way a tourist fills up card upon card with
digital photos.
For example, Japan sports several soundseeing tours. Together, these five
podcasts span every corner of The Land of the Rising Sun:
 Planet Japan (www.planetjapan.org/podcast.html)
 Kobe Beef (kobe-beef.blogspot.com)
 Kyoto Podcast (homepage.mac.com/japanpodguides)
 Herro Flom Japan (www.herroflomjapan.com)
 Tokyo Calling (www.tokyocalling.org)
Part of the appeal in this handful of feeds is how each takes place in the same
country, but remains unique in its perspectives. With podcasts from Kobe,
Kyoto, and Shiraishi Island, subscribing to more than one podcast located in
the same country can give you a wider perspective than just one.
Other soundseeing tours include countries where hosts open the door to
their homes and take the world on a trip to the grocery store, a quick errand
into town, or (for the really lucky ones) a quick stop-off at the pub. Here is
just a sprinkling of these types of podcasts:
 Amsterdam: Bicyclemark’s Communiqué (www.bicyclemark.org/blog/)
 Canada: Island Podcasting (radio.weblogs.com/0145147/)
 Great Britain: The Definitive London Podcast (www.learnoutloud.com/
Catalog/Travel/-/The-Definitive-London-Podcast/6925) and
Perfect Path (www.perfectpath.co.uk)
 New Zealand: Kat’s Kiwi Podcast (katskiwipodcast.blogspot.com)
And in the same spirit of soundseeing tours comes its offspring: beercasts. In
a beercast, hosts fire up a recorder and capture for posterity and podcasting
purposes a night out with friends. Especially when everyone podcasting
orders a different brew, beercasts feature some of the most unique and 
hard-to-find microbrews along with insight on “what makes a good beer.”
Mmmmmmm . . . beeeeeercasts.
Serialized Novel/Short-Story Podcasts
When Tee stepped into podcasting, no author had yet set out to do what he
was planning: to serialize a novel in podcasts, from beginning to end. Twenty-
two chapters of MOREVI and a preview of Legacy of MOREVI, over a period of
23 weeks. But would anyone really want to listen?
294
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Wow — people did want to listen and continue to do so months after its con-
clusion! And now, other authors are beginning to discover the potential of
this exciting new way to promote their works, their unpublished material,
and (of course) themselves.
Podiobooks are podcast novels with the authors recording their works from
home. Alongside Tee’s swashbuckling epic fantasy, MOREVI (www.teemorris.
com/podcast/), others have come on board:
 The Pocket and the Pendant (markjeffrey.typepad.com): Mark
Jeffrey joined the podiobook genre with this young-adult science-fantasy
adventure.
 EarthCore (www.scottsigler.net): Scott Sigler performed this jugger-
naut rock-and-roll/science-fiction thriller.
These podiobooks led the charge that eventually led to Podiobooks.com (www.
podiobooks.com), a Web site (founded by your humble authors) dedicated to
offering podcast novels (and even nonfiction titles) from one reliable source.
Now, Podiobooks.com (shown in Figure 16-2) offers Paul Story’s Tom Corven
(www.dreamwords.com/TomCorven.htm), a podcast live from the Scottish
highlands. And it continues to field many queries from authors, both known
and unknown, in how to join the ranks of podcasting authors.

But what if podcast novels are too big a commitment? You can still get in a
fast “fiction fix” with these podcasts:
 Escape Pod (escapepod.info): This podcast offers its subscribers a
wide variety of previously published and brand-new short fiction, includ-
ing five-minute flash-fiction podcasts.
 The Seanachai (goodwordsrightorder.com): This podcast continues
to spin yarn upon yarn, tale upon tale, and moral upon moral in the Irish
tradition of storytelling.
Since the success of the first three podiobooks and the launch of Escape Pod
and The Seanachai, more and more writers are turning to podcasting for pro-
motion and distribution of their work. So curl up with a good MP3 player and
enjoy the free fiction that the podosphere has to offer.
Passionate Podcasts
There it is again! The P word — passion. Yes, yes, yes, there should be passion
in every podcast you listen to, but some do their thing simply as a celebra-
tion of something — a salute, dedication, or just plain declaration of love for
a sport, TV show, or another interest that (for whatever reason) matters to a
group of people. Here are some podcasts around such interests:
 The Signal (signal.serenityfirefly.com): If you take a look at
Podcast Alley’s Top Ten podcasts, you find a show up there called The
Signal. This podcast is a celebration of the prematurely cancelled sci-fi-
Western-adventure television show Firefly. The Signal is a podcast from
Firefly fans, for Firefly fans, and for people curious as to what the fuss is
all about. Eagerly counting down to the release of the television show’s
feature film, Serenity, The Signal continues to show support for an out-of-
this-world Western, its actors, and the crew behind-the-scenes.
 Zencast (www.zencast.org): This podcast explores Buddhist and Zen
teachings, features new age music artists, and teaches techniques in
meditation, aligning bio-energies, and spiritual enlightenment.
 Cubscast (cubscast.com): If you are less into achieving inner peace
and more into screaming from the cheap seats at Wrigley Field, then
Cubscast may be what you’re looking for. As of the writing of this book,
podcasts are available for the Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees,
the Oakland Athletics, and the new kids in the sport — the Washington
Nationals. There are podcasts for professional wrestling, football (both
American and European), and NASCAR, many of them fan-based, fan-
sponsored, and fan-hosted.
296
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Catholic Insider (www.catholicinsider.com): But what if your passion
is more rooted in the spiritual growth of your faith? Does God have a pod-
cast? (Pretty deep question, we know. . . .) Well, God does have someone
on the payroll, not only making the Top Ten lists but winning the People’s
Choice Award for Best Religious Podcast. The Catholic Insider (shown in
Figure 16-3), podcasting from The Netherlands, is hosted by Father
Roderick Vonhögen, Catholic priest of the Archdiocese of Utrecht. Not
only does he answer questions concerning faith, religion, and everyday
values, he also offers up commentary on Harry Potter and Star Wars.
A man of God. A sci-fi geek. Now that’s the makings of a fun podcast!
Podcasts about . . . Podcasting
It may sound redundant and feel a little odd to listen to a podcast about 
podcasting. It would be like tuning into an interview show for interviewers
interviewing other interviewers, or having an electrician come over to an
electrician’s house to fix faulty electric wiring. But why not?
 podCast411 (podcast411.com): On this podcast about podcasting,
Robert Walch picks the brains of podcasters from every genre, every
recording method, and every work ethic, and asks them “So how do you
do it?” and “Why do you do it?” The goal of podCast411 is to answer just
those questions — and to keep podcasters informed about what is cur-
rently playing in the podosphere. Featuring these podcasts lets other pod-
casters tune in, listen, and use what they hear to make their own podcasts
grow and improve.

of the world of podcasting, the portable media that offer ways of taking
podcasts on the road, and future trends that podcasting is leading busi-
nesses into. Again, two podcasters keep their attention on their passion
of podcasting, and keep their listeners and show producers in the know

Top Ten Most Influential People
in Podcasting
In This Chapter
 People who matter

n just over a year, the number of podcasts grew from a few dozen to over
10,000. Even if you’re running on “Internet time,” you have to consider that
a meteoric rise.
If you’re reading this book, you’re likely new to podcasting and might have
missed out on the trials and tribulations that went along with that huge
growth spurt. As with any sudden rise, select individuals proved themselves
to be instrumental to podcasting, as well as to other podcasters, during those
formative times all those long months ago.
The following list suggests ten (or so) of these individuals who will likely con-
tinue to influence the shape of things to come in the podcasting world. As
you read these names, try to remember that these are regular people like the
rest of us. True, some of them may seem larger than life (even in a field this
new), but all of them put their pants on one leg at a time — unless they’re
wearing skirts.
While we encourage you to make your own decisions, a wise budding pod-
caster or future podcast star would do well to take a listen to the wisdom/
information/rants put forth by this group. Often controversial and usually
informative, each of these people has a unique outlook on the world of pod-
casting. We’ve found each of them to be helpful guides in our own growth in
podcasting. But (as we’ve said probably way too many times in this book for
our editors’ tastes) your mileage may vary.

Dave Winer
Podcasting really wouldn’t be podcasting without the capability to enclose
files inside an RSS feed — and Dave Winer is the one who made that happen.
Without that extension of RSS, we’d all be downloading files in real time, 
wondering why anyone in their right mind would put up a 65MB file.
Dave is one of the more interesting characters in the world of podcasting.
In addition to his technical contributions, some would argue that Dave’s 
contributions to the spirit of podcasting are every bit as important.
As of this writing, Dave continues to produce Morning Coffee Notes
(morningcoffeenotes.com). This podcast sticks with relatively rough-
and-ready production values, but it’s worth checking out as a pioneering
approach. The use of music is pretty casual, which brings up an important
point for you ahead-of-the-curve types out there . . .
If you wind up incorporating a lot of music into your podcast — especially if
your ambition is to provide programming for a commercial market — make
sure you have copyright clearance for the music you use. (That clanking
chain you hear is The Ghost of Napster Past.)
Dave’s show features Dave, a portable recording device, and his surroundings.
Sometimes it’s a discussion about a piece of technology; sometimes it’s a con-
versation with an interesting individual. But listeners to Morning Coffee Notes
are always treated to thought-provoking opinions and ideas from one of the
progenitors of podcasting.
Dave is very much a “polarizing” individual with strong opinions he’s not
afraid to share. He doesn’t pull any punches, and you always get the truth as
he sees it. As is often true of strong opinions, the result is that some technol-
ogists bristle at the mention of his name, while others welcome his ability to
look at challenges and conventional wisdom from a new perspective. Yes, he
rambles — sometimes in directions that escape our personal interest or
clash with our opinions on various topics. But he’s Dave Winer, a voice worth
listening to. You can decide what to do with the information after that.
Adam Curry
In 1987, both of your authors were freshman in college and MTV (the icon of
the generation that remembers when they actually played music videos)
hired a new VJ named Adam Curry. Almost 20 years later, despite life experi-
ences, diplomas, and other strange changes and artistic ventures, it’s still
baffling to think that the same guy who was introducing the latest Madonna
video is now “the Podfather.”
300
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Adam Curry’s importance to the craft might be the single best example that
illustrates the “just-do-it” nature of podcasting. It was Adam Curry, not some
highly trained programmer, who hacked together the first podcatching client
program to harness the power of the recently created enclosed-media files in
RSS 2.0 feeds — and made them download during the computer’s off hours.
Since that time, Adam has become the most recognized (and arguably the
most popular) podcaster around. He continues to produce the Daily Source
Code (dailysourcecode.com), which was probably the first “podcast about
nothing.” Listeners never know quite what to expect; Adam could take them
on a tour of his kitchen, or discuss the latest round of talks that his company,
BoKu Communications, is having with some technology or content partner
that will change the shape of podcasting in the future. The proverbial potluck
show that contains its own inside joke.
Adam is definitely at the forefront of podcasting as a valid means of distribut-
ing content — and is attracting attention as a business model and an agent of
change in our world. It’s worth making time to listen to “the DSC” — even if
you fast-forward through the parts that don’t appeal to you — but we’ve all
received special permission to do just that from the Podfather, so you won’t
be swimming with the fishes anytime soon.
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates
To the best of our knowledge, neither of these two gentlemen have podcasts,
and you may be wondering why we’re listing them as influential. For those
who don’t collect the Mega-Corporation Trading Card set, Steve Jobs and
Bill Gates are the brains and founders of Apple and Microsoft, respectively.
The actions of their companies, via direct and indirect hardware and software
applications, have a distinct and unquestionable impact on the future of pod-
casting. It’s not a big leap to assume that without the huge consumer adoption
of the Apple iPod (which arguably has spurred sales of other portable audio-
file players), podcasting would not have spread at the incredible rate it has. As
of this writing, the latest version of iTunes is causing yet another explosion, as
more folks are discovering the simplicity (and joy) of listening to podcasts.
Because podcasts originate from, are transferred through, or wind up on a
personal computer, Microsoft is involved. However, its reach goes much far-
ther than the ubiquitous operating system — and could have a profound
impact on podcasting in the future. Microsoft products are everywhere —
from cellphones and PDAs to entire media centers and game consoles. Look
for this company to continue to turn out products that not only make use of
podcasting technology, but also to extend it in directions that directly benefit
its bottom line.
301
Chapter 17: Top Ten Most Influential People in Podcasting

As much as podcasting has been a bootstrap movement, the big guns are
coming. Heck, they are already here, changing the game as it’s forming. But
such is the nature of all technology. Of course, other technology companies
will exert their influence as well — but it’s worth remembering that market
forces are in play already, and will continue as podcasting progresses.
Doug Kaye
Doug Kaye is the driving force behind IT Conversations (www.
itconversations.com), a collection of podcasts and programs that
stay at the cutting edge of technology and innovation. With show hosts 
talking about everything from blogging to digital rights and new-media 
trailblazing, it’s easy to stay informed (though sometimes a challenge to
keep up) if you listen to one or (gods help you) all of the programs Doug
helps produce.
But Doug’s contribution to podcasting goes beyond simply assembling the
best high-tech people to create the latest conversations about IT innovation —
and providing them a vehicle for their thoughts. He’s actively seeking to capture
as many speakers, panel discussions, and conversations from various events
and expositions all over the world. There’s a vast amount of knowledge shared
in these venues, and Doug’s opinion is that too few people get a chance to hear
about it. He’s working hard to change that, by capturing those discussions as
they happen and making them part of the IT Conversations family of offerings.
In essence, he’ll be archiving this knowledge for future interested people.
(Should be quite a future.)
It’s a great plan, and one that takes an incredible amount of dedication. Doug
works closely with each of his show hosts to make sure their podcasts are
engaging, sound great, and are a joy for interested people to listen to.
Rob Walch
Every day or so, Rob releases another edition of podCast411 (podcast411.
com), each of which features an interview with another podcaster about . . .
podcasting. While that may sound a bit like high-tech navel-gazing, you might
be surprised at how worthy the content is to add to your already overloaded
subscription list.
Podcasters should be listening to Rob’s show because it’s about what they do.
Who better to learn new tips and tricks from than the people actually doing it
on their show every week? Most of the conversations stay focused at a fairly
high level, avoiding the “detail dump” that would turn most people off.
302
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Rob talks with other podcasters not only about how they podcast but also
why they do it. For every question about a microphone or particular piece
of hardware, Rob digs deeper into the goals of the show, the way the hosts
approach their craft, and what their hopes and dreams are.
It’s a fascinating show for anyone interesting in learning from others who are
constantly refining their shows. If you’re podcasting, you should be listening
to this one.
Nicole Simon
The denizens of middle management yearn for the day when they are handed
the key to the executive washroom. For podcasters, that day comes when the
first e-mail from Nicole Simon arrives.
Nicole has an insatiable appetite for podcasts, consuming so many that we’re
convinced she has multiple copies of herself listening simultaneously, and then
downloading all of them into one giant uber-Nicole. When the uber-Nicole
finds a podcast that she enjoys or thinks has promise, she’s more than happy
to give the podcaster some suggestions on ways to improve it.
Not only does she provide honest and direct feedback to the podcasters she
listens to, she helps keep the podcasting community in check — making sure
every podcaster considers the international component of what is said or
done on his or her show. Too often we get caught up in what “the govern-
ment” might do, or state that “new shows will be posted in the morning”
without specifying the time zone we occupy. Nicole is there to ask tough
questions such as, “to which government are you referring?” and “would that
be your morning, or my morning?”
She also produces her own podcast called Useful Sounds (www.useful-sounds.
de) and has what is commonly referred to as the sexiest voice in podcasting.
(Both of your authors agree.)
Dave Slusher
Dave Slusher is another early adopter of podcasting, creating the Evil Genius
Chronicles (www.evilgeniuschronicles.org) from Conway, South Carolina.
With a varied background that includes working with various IT startups and
hosting a nationally syndicated talk-radio program in the 1990s, Dave may
be the perfect blend of technology and talent. But that’s not what put him
on this list.
303
Chapter 17: Top Ten Most Influential People in Podcasting

Dave is the single best person at “keepin’ it real,” to borrow a “street” cliché.
When podcasters get too caught up in ratings, tracking downloads, various
awards, and whether they’re being fairly judged in their community, Dave
Slusher is right there to say, “Why the hell do you care what anyone else
thinks?”
Dave advocates the power of passion-for-what-you-do as the single biggest
motivation for podcasters. Podcasters should take that position to heart; it’s
easy to forgive a few technical miscues, or to turn the other cheek when a
podcaster is experimenting with a new format. But listeners can tell when
a podcaster is trying to be something “more” than he or she truly is, and
that’s a big turn-off. Heck, there’s already an entire radio spectrum dedicated
to that sort of thing.
Brian Ibbott
We put Brian on this list for two reasons. First, he’s one of the original music
podcasters and many of you readers are likely thinking of starting a music
podcast of your own. (Hey, lots of us wanted to be DJs when we were kids.)
More importantly, Brian is a music podcaster who is doing it right — and
doing it the legal way.
As mentioned in Chapter 3, podcasting licensed music legally is a challenge.
With his podcast Coverville (coverville.com), Brian has worked directly
with ASCAP, BMI, and other various organizations that hold the rights to
major-label music and songs. While many music podcasters are just a
process server away from a major lawsuit, Brian is sitting pretty.
Brian also serves as an example of how to create a niche podcast out of the
music you love and fill a void not covered by the traditional outlets. Brian
has a passion for cover songs, and has built a show completely around songs
that fit that bill. Not only that, but he’s taken it a step further, featuring
groups of cover songs that have a common thread and producing themed
episodes of his podcast. Simply brilliant — we don’t know of any radio sta-
tions or programs that provide this service.
So before you rush out to make the next hot music podcast, consider the
legal ramifications. And while you are pondering that, also ask whether your
future podcast sounds like the same stuff anyone can listen to over their
radios. Follow Brian’s lead, and give the world something different with
your podcast.

Ray Slakinski and August Trometer
Some folks might argue that when iTunes became a podcatching client, the
rest of the companies making alternative podcatching clients were doomed.
Well, though we don’t have a crystal ball or unlimited credit with The Psychic
Friends Network, we’d say hold the phone on that one.
Ray and August are more than just the creators of iPodderX (ipodderx.com).
These guys genuinely care about propelling podcasting forward, and they
walk the walk by building the tools and services necessary to keep up (and
help shape) the continually shifting nature of podcasting. These two guys are
true innovators and see their role in podcasting as something more than just
helping you pull MP3 files out of podcast feeds.
Historians tell us it was not the miners who made the gold rush of 1849, but
the companies that provided the picks and the shovels. Keep your eyes on
these guys; the picks and shovels they make are about to get very interesting.
Dave Chekan, Matt Hoopes, Marty
Mulligan, and Dave Mansueto
Podcasting sucks. Bandwidth, that is. A lot of it, as we discuss in Chapter 7.
Without these four guys (DMMD, as we like to call them), many podcasters
would have folded up shop long ago because they couldn’t afford to pay their
hosting bill.
DMMD gave the podcasting world Liberated Syndication (www.libsyn.com),
providing unbelievably cheap hosting and serving of podcast media files at a
time when subscribers were flocking toward podcasts like lemmings off the cliff.
Libsyn is helping to change the paradigm of bandwidth and media-file delivery
systems. Okay, nontechnical types may find it boring, scarily technical, and
incredibly complicated — but it’s a complete necessity for any podcaster who
receives a modicum of popularity. Luckily for everyone, these four guys make
it a breeze to keep your podcasts going when the wave hits.
As with any small company, they’ve weathered some rough spots along the
way. But DMMD are committed to sticking it out, and we hope podcasters con-
tinue to stand by them or other companies like theirs. Because the thought of
paying for incremental bandwidth is simply too scary to consider unless you
win the lottery.

Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting
Won’t Kill Radio
In This Chapter
 Freedom from the FCC: good and bad
 Too many choices
 Independent music versus pop music
 Staying in touch
A
nyone remember when you tuned in to MTV and actually saw music
videos? Good times, good times. If you ever want to throw out some fun
trivia, ask, “What was the first video to ever play on MTV and what group per-
formed in it?” The answer is the video for the song “Video Killed the Radio
Star” by the Buggles.
As goofy, chintzy, and utterly new wave as that song is, there was a bit of a
panic when MTV went on the air. All musicians suddenly had to contend with
something only a few performers — like Elton John, Meat Loaf, and ELO —
had ever considered: image. Record labels and producers had to add into
their budgets payrolls for directors, set designers, and scriptwriters. Radio
stations suddenly had to compete with television over — rock stars!
Listeners were listening to music on their TVs! What will become of the music
industry as we know it?!
Well, it’s 23 years later, and radio is still here. MTV now shows a variety of
programming, and very little of it includes music videos. Radio — much to
the contrary of what bean counters and consultants convince program 
directors — has survived MTV, Napster, Internet radio, and Howard Stern’s
announcement that he is jumping to satellite radio.
Now comes podcasting, and once again what many in the broadcasting indus-
try dismissed as the next wave of Internet radio is beginning to gain ground.
In less than six months, podcasting went from a feature in the Washington
Post Express (a free, sample newspaper distributed at rail stations) to a front-
page feature in The Washington Post!

For a new medium so easily disregarded, the radio industry is taking notice
and regarding podcasting as a threat. While it would be neat to think that yes,
podcasting is the people’s radio and will bring about the downfall of the radio
execs who believe they know what listeners really want, the radio industry
will not be closing its doors nor will it suffer multigazillion-dollar losses on
account of this grass-roots movement that is podcasting. No, the corporate
radio business will continue to stand strong and still smell as pretty as a red
rose in full bloom.
The Undiscovered Country:
Podcasting Awareness
Podcasting has celebrated a one-year anniversary (and what a lovely party it
was) and yet with coverage from the media, it is not uncommon to hear this
question: “What’s a podcast?”
Something like this happened to Evo when a mechanic at his local auto body
garage spotted his license plate, which reads, simply enough, PODCAST. The
mechanic asked, “What’s a podcast?” Evo went into the bare-bones explana-
tion of what a podcast is, how it works, and said, “It’s so simple to do, you
could go home, create a podcast, and have it online tomorrow!”
The mechanic’s reply: “Why would I want to do that?”
Podcasting is still in its infancy and will remain the great unknown until more
people realize:
 You don’t need an iPod to listen.
 It’s not dangerous to download an aggregator like iPodderX or Doppler.
 Once feeds are entered, it’s easy to collect and listen to podcasts, either
on your computer or your MP3 player.
When you use the word radio, even with the word satellite tacked in front of
it, people understand the concept and know what you are talking about. For
some, podcasting sounds too much like something geeks do for fun, but we’re
here to tell you that even geeks don’t know what podcasting is!
Radio has decades of history, ranging from Orson Welles’s War of the Worlds,
to Abbott and Costello, to FDR’s Fireside Chats, to Edward R. Murrow bring-
ing the news from London during World War II. Podcasting’s history includes
socialite Paris Hilton, The Shocker (from The Dawn and Drew Show!), and a
former MTV VJ who now refers to himself as “The Podfather” and his favorite
casts as “The Pod Squad.”
308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

It is the newness of podcasting, along with the comfort level and familiarity of
the general public (geeks included), that will keep radio in the forefront of
broadcasting audio content. Perhaps marketers see a potential here, and so
they should, but it will be a few more feeds, a few more articles in print media,
and a little more innovation before podcasting can truly unhinge radio.
Are You Sure You Want to Say That?:
Benefits of the FCC
The origins of George Carlin’s famous rant “The Seven Dirty Words You Can
Never Say on Television” stems from a routine appearing on the album
Indecent Exposure. The monologue was played on Pacifica radio station WBAI-
FM, bringing on the wrath of the Federal Communications Commission. Since
then, the FCC has kept a watchful eye on what is said and done on the public
airwaves of both television and radio.
Podcasting has remained out of the reach of the FCC, which gives podcasters
and their listeners carte blanche to say and do just about anything they want.
Some podcasts focus on sexuality of all kinds, and other podcasts let the
occasional obscenity slip by the producers. Across the podosphere, though,
there is an understood protocol that if you are doing a podcast that is meant
for adults and not young Web surfers, it is a good idea to let people know.
The lack of restraints and restrictions of the FCC, allowing podcasters to go
far beyond what is considered by the government as decent, is not only pod-
casting’s greatest strength but also its greatest weakness. Part of the appeal
of on-air personalities like Howard Stern is watching how far they are willing
to go in order to challenge the FCC. We have no doubt that Howard is going
to be a huge hit on SIRIUS satellite radio, but we also believe a good chunk of
his listenership and an even greater chunk of his appeal and mystique will
disappear. Without the restraints of the FCC, Stern can now cuss like a sailor,
go way above and beyond what can be heard on conventional radio, and not
care what he does or who he offends.
But here’s a more obvious way the FCC gives broadcast radio an advantage
over podcasting: You know that what you will listen to is deemed family safe
(within reason). That can’t always be said for podcasting. On your podcast,
if you’re swearing and producing content that’s nothing better than prere-
corded locker room talk, then you’re probably in the clear because people
know what to expect. However, if your podcast is on hobbies, politics, or
sports, don’t blindside your audience with profanity just because you can.
309
Chapter 18: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Won’t Kill Radio

So Many Podcasts, So Many Choices
An incredible thing about podcasting is how many choices listeners have in
the way of content. Podcasting offers thousands of various feeds (as shown
in Figure 18-1), ranging from general topics of interest to narrower topics that
appeal to more specialized audiences.

For mature audiences
Working blue is a term from stand-up comedy
where your subject matter and vocabulary are
strictly for adults. A great way to see the differ-
ences between working blue and not is to watch,
back to back, the stand-up films Bill Cosby’s
Himself and Eddie Murphy’s Raw. If you are
working blue in your podcast, it would be a good
idea to put in a disclaimer in the beginning of
your podcast. Another option is to give your pod-
casts ratings similar to the ratings assigned to
films. For an example of a podcast directory that
implements a movie-style rating system, go to
Podcast Pickle at www.podcastpickle.com.
With the freedom to rant, rave, and swear, few
podcasts out there work blue. An understood
rule of podcasting is not to swear just for swear-
ing’s sake, and in many instances, editing out
cuss words with sound effects can add a bit of
humor to an already funny podcast.

Conventional radio, however, has to vie for available airwaves and signal
strength as well as fulfill a specific demand in the area. Sure, you may have
choice in your listening area. For example, in the Washington, D.C., area, Tee
can either listen to DC101 or Arrow 94.7 if he wants to hear classic rock. If
both stations are playing music he’s not keen on, then Tee must weather the
storm and wait in the hopes of better programming. Podcasting, on the other
hand, grants the freedom to choose from a variety that radio, be it public air-
waves or satellite, could never deliver.
But is it possible to have too many choices? From a marketing perspective,
yes, there can be so many choices offered to a consumer that the brain can’t
process that much information all at once. Then there is an issue of time. Do
you have that much time in the day to listen to however many podcasts you
register for? When you are searching for the right sports channel, you can
more easily narrow down which show is best suited for your interests if
you have 20 sports shows to choose from on satellite radio, as opposed to
188 various sports podcasts.
So while choice and variety are good things, too much can be a little 
overwhelming.
Quality Versus Quantity
Podcasts cover a variety of topics with a variety of personalities. Some pod-
cast hosts are genuine, warm, and caring, giving you a glimpse inside of their
world. Other hosts are wise-cracking, crass, salt-of-the-earth loud-mouths
who are poking fun at the world while turning the mirror on themselves and
dealing their own fair share of ribbing. So with the variety of subject matter
comes an even wider variety of approaches and delivery. The same can also
be said for the audio quality of these podcasts.
Broadcast radio, including AM stations that lack the quality and power of FM
stations, can easily brag that its signal strength will always outperform the
power of the MP3, and to an extent that is true. It’s true until you start to
travel outside of the transmission area, and the signal begins to fizzle.
Weaker. Weaker. Then, much like a tense moment in a science-fiction movie as
the escape pod slowly tumbles into deep space, the signal eventually disap-
pears in a sea of static. If you have your favorite MP3 player plugged in to
your car, your signal will never fade!
Still, when in the signal range with broadcast radio, you have a strong, power-
ful transmission with terrific audio quality. As mentioned in Chapter 6, there 
is no set standard for podcasts. Podcasts are produced with anything from
professional-grade audio software and recording equipment to a 20-dollar
microphone and Audacity software. The producers of the podcast, usually the
hosts themselves, will compress the MP3 to provide the most efficient down-
load. Many times, this will mean the podcast itself is difficult to listen to.
311
Chapter 18: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Won’t Kill Radio

Without set standards for audio quality, you may find one podcast that covers
sports the way you like and how you like it, but it may also sound like the hosts
are talking in a tin can. Then you have the Official Curling Podcast — curling is
a sport that many people know little about (or barely understand) — but man,
does this podcast sound sweet! So until there are audio standards set in pod-
casting, it will be crap shoot as to how good a particular podcast will sound.
I Can’t Name That Tune:
Music in Podcasting
Music is a popular topic in podcasting. In fact, it is the most popular podcast
topic. At the time of this writing, 1,631 podcasts are listed in the Music/Radio
genre, with Technology coming in second at 1,001 registered podcasts. As
impressive and diverse as this may sound, hold your applause. As it was said
in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: “Things are not always as they seem.”
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is about as happy about
podcasting as it was about Napster. With recent lawsuits following file-sharing
technologies and the swapping of music files, legal teams are merely waiting to
hop into their fleet of Tumblers (thank you, Batman Begins) and hunt down
copyright offenders, and podcasting (in particular, music podcasts) has the
potential to be a favorite target of the RIAA.
If you want to podcast a tribute, for example, to Billy Joel — call it the Big
Shot Podcast: All Billy Joel. All the Time. — then you have to pay licensing
fees to the RIAA just as radio stations across the country do. These licensing
fees can be costly to the average podcaster. You can, however, play indepen-
dently published and produced music, provided you have permission from
the parties who hold rights to the music. In some cases, it is the record label,
and other times it is musician. With many independent musicians, the record
label and the musician are one and the same.
So if you want to play music that you don’t hear on the standard radio air-
waves, podcasting is a venue for you and your original music to be played to
an international audience. If you want to play the hottest new releases from
Coldplay, Switchfoot, and U2, you won’t be able to do it for free. Because
radio stations have the backing of corporate entities like Viacom, these fees
are simply chump change for them. For the podcaster, that fee could be spent
elsewhere . . . like rent.
312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

A Prerecorded Show, Recorded Live: Live
Remotes Versus Remote Podcasting
There are podcasts that you could consider slice-of-life podcasts. They’re
simply ambient noise of the world around them, recording a day in the life of
the podcaster and sharing it with the world. These remote podcasts can be
anything from a trip to the supermarket to the more-popular (and quite fun to
participate in) beercasts, where friends just sit around and sample the beers
of whatever establishment they are visiting. However, this is what separates
podcasting from streaming audio: Podcasts are all prerecorded.
Radio will always have the advantage of immediate content. Radio broadcasts
can bring live concerts, sporting events, and news to listeners as they happen.
Sure, podcasting can serve as an archive for legendary moments of sports or
history, but — while it is neat to hear Al Michaels scream out, “Do you believe
in miracles!?” — nothing can beat the moment itself, whether you are watching
it on television, listening to it on the radio, or fortunate enough to be there. The
same thing can be said for the climax of Roger Waters’s The Wall Live in Berlin
concert or the 2004 Boston Red Sox breaking the curse.
Companion podcasts are the closest we come to live podcasts. A companion
podcast is similar to Director’s Comments found on DVDs, commentary that
is meant to be listened to when either reading principal text or watching a
television show. Such is the case with Ronald D. Moore, creator and head
writer of the new Battlestar Galactica, and his companion podcast. Before
each episode, Moore hosts a show that you can listen to while you watch 
the episode that is currently airing. You could claim this is live, but the true
event itself (Battlestar Galactica) is prerecorded.
Radio will always have the advantage of transporting audiences to history as
it happens, keeping listeners in the know of current events, and delivering
content at that very moment. Satellite radio now solves the problem of limited
reception. Subscribers to satellite radio never have to worry about losing a
signal, staying with the live coverage from the beginning to the end.
Advertising: Show Me the Numbers
Because podcasting is such a new medium, potential advertisers will ask pod-
casters the same question they ask a radio station’s sales representative: “So,
what kind of numbers does your show pull in? How can I justify the cost of
running ads on your morning show?”
313
Chapter 18: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Won’t Kill Radio

The radio executive can pull out a ratings chart for his or her morning show
and tell the perspective advertiser that the show pulls in a 12 share, which
means 24,000 people are listening to the show. He can also break down the
ratings points into age and gender groups, to give the executive an idea of
what kind of listener tunes in.
The same situation with the podcaster is a slightly tougher sale. The podcaster
says, “We measure how well a show is doing by bandwidth and downloads.”
Already, the podcaster has probably lost the potential advertiser with the
word bandwidth. So the advertiser asks, “How many downloads do you have a
month?” He looks at the numbers and asks, “Is that men and women, 18–25?”
The podcaster doesn’t really know for sure. “Well, these folks are downloading
the show, but are you certain these people are listening?” Again, the podcaster
can’t answer for certain.
Advertisers want to know who your audience is and how your podcast can
make a difference in getting people to their business. True, a podcast —
unlike radio — reaches a much wider audience. A global one, in fact. But for
many businesses, reaching a global market is less important than reaching
a local market. You can measure your podcast’s downloads many different
ways, but when it comes to target groups (also known as demographics),
radio holds an advantage with the ratings system in place.
Podcasting will eventually refine the various methods of measuring listener-
ship and subscribers, and there are various scripts available that can be
downloaded and incorporated into feeds and Web pages and can produce
accurate numbers. But they are a far cry from the sophisticated ratings
books generated for radio stations and their programming. Until computer
programmers can come up with something more in-depth and easier for non-
technical types to understand, it will be radio’s ratings shares trumping the
podcast downloads.
My Corner of the World: Local News
It’s early morning rush hour and time to head out with a cup of joe, a break-
fast burrito, and your newspaper. You get into the car and plug in your MP3
player and listen to the latest installment of The Daily Source Code, a change
of pace from the local news station that is your usual morning fare. Only ten
minutes into your commute, you run into a traffic jam. Thirty minutes later,
you haven’t moved. So you switch to your radio and hear:
“And as we have been reporting all morning, the tractor trailer spilling
biohazardous waste has caused some strange mutation spreading from
car to car now trapped on the interstate. And it appears that some of the
drivers closest to the tanker are eating the other commuters . . .”
314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

You look up, just in time to see a small group of grey-skinned commuters with
freakily glowing eyes walking toward you. What a different morning it would
have been if you had listened to the radio and not your favorite podcast.
Broadcast radio has the potential to keep listeners informed with up-to-the-
moment local news, a distinct advantage that podcasting falls short in 
fulfilling.
If you’re trying to entice listeners to visit your community, traffic reports and
local headlines might not be what you want to use. Add to this the problem of
podcasting being unable to perform true live remotes, and the immediacy
and urgency of local issues, traffic reports, and weather forecasts is lost.
Local commercial and community-sponsored radio continues to fill a demand
that podcasting cannot: late-breaking news in the area.
So before plugging in your MP3 player for your morning drive, you might
want to tune in to your local news radio station first, just to avoid any apoca-
lyptic backups on the interstate.
10-4, Good Buddy: Satellite Radio versus
Podcasting with Professional Drivers
Satellite radio (XM and SIRIUS leading the charge) exclusively holds one
advantage over podcasting: continuous content.
At present, the biggest subscribers to satellite radio are people in professions
that involve driving — in particular, cross-country driving. Satellite radio
solves the problem of traditional AM/FM radio in that the signal is clean,
clear, and constant from one coast to the other. It is 24 hours of content that
continuously refreshes itself.
In a 14- to 16-hour nonstop trek across the country, satellite radio can offer
new and original programming. To achieve the same thing with podcasting,
you would have to program into a podcatching client at least 28 podcast feeds
(provided the podcasts are an average of 30 minutes in length), download
them, sync them with your portable MP3 player, and then take it on the road.
It is not impossible to have podcasts take you from one coast to the other
and back again, but as far as keeping the content original and new from
beginning to end, you are looking at an impressive collection of feeds 
numbering in the 30s to 40s. There is also a bit more work involved with 
podcasting in programming in the feeds, downloading, and then syncing
the casts. With satellite radio, the consumer simply has to turn on the unit.
315
Chapter 18: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Won’t Kill Radio

Audio for the People, By the People . . .
but Not Necessarily Embraced
by the People
To listen to a radio broadcast, you need a simple transistor radio, a power
supply, and a strong signal. Anyone can tune in, and you can listen anywhere
within the transmission signal.
To listen to a podcast, you need the following:
 A computer
 A power supply
 An Internet connection
 An aggregator/podcatching client to subscribe and automatically down-
load the audio content
 An MP3 player on the computer
All this is for listening to podcasts in the comfort of your own home. If you
want your podcasts to go, you need to invest in a portable MP3 player. Not
only is it an investment to podcast your own program, it can be an investment
to just listen to them.
Finally, the sad truth and reality of a podcast is that you can put one together
and tell your family about it, but that doesn’t mean that they’ll listen to it. If
your grandmother is particularly savvy, then she might download and have a
listen, but that is if your grandmother is really up on her latest Internet trends.
Otherwise, she’ll miss your podcast.
An advantage of radio is that you tell your family about your radio show. You
give them the station and broadcast time. They tune in.
Listeners need to have some familiarity with technology and some Internet
know-how to be able to set up their computers to receive feeds. While iTunes
has opened the door for podcasting to reach the general public, podcasters
are still working against the technophobia in receiving a podcast versus 
turning on a radio, tuning in, and listening.

Chapter 19
Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting
Will Kill (Or Seriously Dent) Radio
In This Chapter
 Reasons why podcasting rocks
 Reasons why radio doesn’t
“P
odcasting is just a fad.”
“This is nothing more than streaming audio, and that didn’t go anywhere.”
“I’ve listened to a few podcasts, and I’m not impressed.”
The poo-pooers of podcasting (hey, that sounds like a great band name) have
a plethora of reasons why podcasting will fail or never grow beyond the few
thousand shows we currently see. And even if the numbers of shows steadily
rise, radio and other forms of traditional broadcasting have nothing to fear.
Or do they?
Chapter 18 gives you many reasons why radio will continue to be radio for
the foreseeable future. In this chapter, we take the opposite vantage point.
While the title may be a bit — okay, a lot — of an exaggeration, we honestly
believe the powers-that-be in charge of the large corporate media conglomer-
ates (radio, to you citizens of the world) have been observing the podcasting
phenomenon for the past year with a weary eye.
Here are a few (ten, to be exact) reasons why.

Podcasters Don’t Need No 
Stinking Transmitters
The distance a terrestrial radio station can transmit a signal is dependent on
three things: tower height, transmitter strength, and FCC (or other appropri-
ate government body) regulations. The first two are physical limitations that
control how far a signal can travel. At some point, geography gets in the way,
or the signal-to-noise ratio simply gets too low to allow for continued recep-
tion. The latter controls the competitive environment, ensuring that stations
in different cities transmitting on the same frequency don’t have to worry
about their signals crossing over one another.
Podcasting is free from all those trappings. Instead of traveling in relation
to the topography of the land, podcasts travel along the topography of the
Internet. A signal released as a podcast in Arlington, Virginia, is just as
easy to pick up in Perth, Australia, as it is for someone 20 miles away in
Washington, D.C.
Syndicated radio programs rely on network relationships with various radio
stations, each one picking up and rebroadcasting the program to its local
area to achieve nationwide or sizeable regional coverage. Satellite radio natu-
rally doesn’t have those same limitations, but even it can’t boast of global
coverage unless it adds a few more multimillion-dollar satellites to its arsenal.
A podcast of exceptional quality and high personal appeal produced out of
northern Scotland, for example, can (and occasionally does) enjoy worldwide
distribution the moment the podcast is available online. Even the most popular
programs on the largest radio networks in the world cannot make this claim.
Reality check time: Just because folks all over the world can listen to your
podcast doesn’t mean that they will. And even if they all decide your program
is the best thing since sliced baklava, listening to your program still requires
a computer connection and device. So simmer down and get your head out of
the clouds.
Podcasting Is Outside of 88.1 and 107.9
(And 530 and 1690)
The FCC (or other regulating government agency) allows a radio station to
transmit on a specific frequency. That frequency falls somewhere between
the end points of the AM and FM radio dial. In other words, you can’t tune in
to 87.3 or 108.7 FM, and you wouldn’t hear anything if you could get your
little orange stick to move to 450 or 1710 AM.
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Really boring physics that you probably didn’t pay attention to in high school
tells us the number of frequencies has a limit between those two end points of
the spectrum. Rather than make you do the equations, trust us that no more
than about 200 radio stations are in any given area, split between the AM and
FM spectrum. Two hundred may sound like a lot of radio stations, and it is.
But due to a host of other incredibly mind-numbing physics issues and the
hard facts of economics, you’ll unlikely find that many choices in your area.
But pretend for a moment that money wasn’t an issue, and that station owners
were willing to take any slot they could get on the spectrum. Two hundred 
stations is a drop in the bucket when you consider how many podcasts you
can access on a local basis.
Can you say “unlimited”? Seriously. The Internet wasn’t designed with a hard
limit on the number of connections. When network traffic gets slow, the com-
panies that rely on those connections find ways to add more capacity. To our
knowledge, we aren’t in danger of filling up the Internet anytime soon.
Satellite radio and other forms of digital delivery change this, obviously.
However, while satellite radio allows for many more channels than terrestrial
radio offers, it still has very real limits. Ah, the freedom of zero spectrum!
The Rats Are Leaving the USS
Commercial Media
Though the mega-corp media companies will squirm to hear us say it, the pop-
ulous is spending less time with their radios, televisions, and newspapers. It’s
not that these staples of news and information are somehow less effective than
they were 50 years ago. People are discovering new, improved, and more inter-
active ways to get their content and are making the switch.
Do a quick Web search (hey look! another interactive media), and you can
find all the supporting documentation you need. In a 2004 report created by
the investment firm Thomas Weisel, researchers predicted the only media
channels with significant growth potential through the year 2007 would be inter-
active television (barely off the ground today), online (podcasting fits here),
home DVDs, and video games. Traditional media is all in decline or flat at best.
We can toss out a host of reasons for this exodus, but it all boils down to one
thing: more choices. We’re still stuck with a 24-hour clock, and try as we
might, we just can’t cram any more hours in the day. Leisure time for most
people is decreasing, so the ability to listen on the go is critical to many.
Podcasting will become even easier to listen to as the technology advances,
leaving the other forms of media consumption contemplating innovative
ways to become more portable. Maybe that’s why we are seeing so many
radio programs and newspapers starting to podcast.

Podcasters Don’t Have to Care
That Most People Don’t Care
Because of all the physical, legal, and economic limitations on traditional
broadcasters, they have to make every second of their programming day
count. And the only thing that counts is getting as many ears listening as
they possibly can.
When you try to appeal to the greatest number of people, the content often
gets watered down. You trade intensity for density, and are willing to sacrifice
important and compelling programs for those that require a little less thought
and are easily digestible.
As a natural result of this homogenization of radio, specialty and niche pro-
grams get pushed to the fringes of the clock, when listenership is already low
due to the human body’s sleep requirement. The station owner needs to fill the
time with something, and it’s a convenient way for him to say, “See? I carry cut-
ting edge and meaningful content.” He leaves out the “. . . at 4:00 a.m.” end of
the sentence.
But podcasting is all about the niche, because Podcast Land has no prime time.
No one has to make hard decisions about putting great, but laser-focused, pro-
grams in a bad time slot. Whether a show has 100 listeners or 100,000, it makes
no difference to the non-existent programming lineup. It’s a matter of personal
preference in the hands of the people listening, and no sacrifices are required
to appeal to anyone other than those who are interested in tuning in.
We Now Pause This Commercial 
for a Word from Our Sponsor
Commercial radio exists for a single purpose: to make money for the owners.
That’s what commercial means. It’s not about bringing more stimulating talk,
playing the best music, or doing something for the greater good. Now, if the
station owner can provide quality music, compelling conversations, or some-
how give back to the community while making money, great.
Radio stations make the majority of the money they need to pay the utility
bills and to provide employees a salary in one way: advertising. You might
think the on-air talent is the lifeblood of a radio station; we know it’s the sales
department.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

In the United States, one hour of clock time spent listening to commercial
radio gets you somewhere between 45 and 50 minutes of content. The other
10 to 15 minutes are spent trying to get you to buy the latest car, switch your
laundry detergent, or convince you to have a heart-to-heart with your doctor
about that unmentionable problem.
As radio listeners, we’re caught between two realities: The stations must run
commercials to pay their overhead, and we’ve become accustomed to an
oversaturation of commercials in our everyday lives. A few years back, most
talk and music stations made an effort to reduce the number of commercials
that aired in an hour. Did you notice? We didn’t either.
Podcasters, by and large, are more sensitive to the perception of too much
commercialization. Make no mistake — many podcasters want to get sponsors
for their programs and to run commercials to not only pay the bills but also
to make them money. But because advertisers have not yet flocked to the pod-
casters, podcasting has been more about the content than the sponsorships.
For now.
But honestly, we think this trend is likely to continue for a few reasons:
 Podcasting is a personal experience, and listeners can easily unsubscribe
and find something else if they perceive a podcaster is going overboard
with the commercials.
 Many podcasts will likely focus on narrowcasting to their audience. This
naturally limits not only the audience, but also the companies and orga-
nizations that wish to reach said audience with their particular message.
 The podcasting community demands it. Already we’re seeing commonly
agreed-to standards of acceptability on how many commercials to run
and how often to run them. The current standard of acceptability is a 
30-second commercial for every 15 minutes of programming. Of course,
no official body makes sure all podcasters adhere to this standard, and
certain podcasters exceed this limit.
But the community as a whole has seemed to have adopted a less-is-more
approach, and is very cognizant of the detriment over-commercialization of
this medium can have on a podcaster’s ability to reach a wider audience. That
may change in the future, and you’ll likely see corporate podcasts completely
ignore any standards the independent podcasts develop. But that’s okay.
Podcasting Can Extend Public Radio
Mention public radio to many people, and minds immediately turn to endless
classical music, dissertations on the status of the local wastewater treatment

Chapter 19: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Will Kill (Or Seriously Dent) Radio

plant, and in-depth analysis of the current political situation in Uzbekistan. It
seems that public radio is acting as a counter balance to the extreme sensa-
tionalism that is commercial radio by being anything but.
Say what you want about public radio, but we happen to like it. Unfortunately,
much of the special interest programming we enjoy isn’t on at a convenient
time. Similarly, we’ve heard great programs on other stations while traveling
around the country that simply aren’t available in our local area.
Podcasting can extend public radio, whether you take that literally or figura-
tively. Already, we’re seeing many public radio stations provide some of their
programming in podcast form, allowing listeners the freedom of time-shifting.
Additionally, we’re seeing many NPR-esque podcasts appear, again spreading
the feeling and spirit of public radio, minus the radio.
We’re sure plenty of sensationalistic and commercialized podcasts are in the
near future. But those are going to be in direct competition with the sensa-
tionalistic and commercial radio programs already on the airwaves. Because
public radio is less about competition and more about cooperation, you’ll
likely see a mutually beneficial relationship develop between the public
broadcasters and podcasters.
John Q. Public — Program Director
Program directors are the people responsible for what you hear on a station.
If it’s a music station, they pick (sometimes with lots of help and guidance
from the larger corporate body) the genre of music that’s played, and some-
times the individual tracks and artists. The same goes for talk radio and
sports radio. In a nutshell, if something makes it on the air, it passed across
the director’s desk for approval.
We’ve known quite a few program directors. Many of them have an uncanny
knack for selecting the hosts, programs, and style of entertainment that res-
onates soundly to the listeners in their community. But so far, none of them
have made a station we can listen to for more than a few hours straight.
This isn’t a negative comment about program directors, just an observation
about programming for one versus programming for many. While podcasting
networks have developed to provide listeners and subscribers with similar
or related content such as The SciFi Podcast Network (tsfpn.com), most
podcast listeners create their own programming lineup by way of their sub-
scription lists.
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The Niche Shall Inherit the Podcast
All the specialty and niche content shows that are currently beating them-
selves up and doing everything they can to get that 4:00 a.m. time slot will
discover and embrace podcasting by the end of 2006. We’re not saying they’ll
stop airing their programs over the radio, but they will find a bigger and more
dedicated audience via podcasting. Sure, you can likely still catch the show
at 4:00, but on the very good chance you’re catching some shut-eye, you’ll be
able to listen to it later, as time-shifted content.
Producing an independent syndicated radio program is hard work — especially
a quality podcast. But the latter has some benefits. The first is freedom — 
freedom from the FCC, freedom from a preset format clock that tells you
exactly how long your show can be, and even freedom from the real clock and
calendar in the time-shifted world.
Podcasters also don’t have to worry about keeping stations happy, nor do
they have to spend countless hours on the phone trying to convince new 
stations to carry their programming. We know more than one independently
produced syndicated program that has ceased all attempts at gaining new
stations simply because its listenership expands greater with podcasting. At
least one has taken it a step further and canceled its relationship with its pre-
vious network of stations. And why not, when it allows you to dump those
burdens and focus on building the best show you can? Sounds like a good
plan to us.
Welcome to Your Own Reality
All of us live in our own customized versions of reality, even though you may
not be conscious of it. Every day, you make choices that reinforce that reality.
You select one particular grocery store as the best even though you could
likely choose from five different stores. You choose a particular model of car
to buy based on who you want to be as much as any other choice. Your hair
style, the clothes you buy . . . it’s human nature.
Whether you do it for status, frugality, or to be good to the environment
doesn’t matter — just as whether it’s a good or bad choice doesn’t matter.
Unless you behave in a completely random pattern, you are reinforcing your
own reality with the choices you make.

Chapter 19: Top Ten Reasons Why Podcasting Will Kill (Or Seriously Dent) Radio

Podcasting gives you one more thing to add to the inventory of you and
who you project yourself to be. We’re sci-fi fans, and we listen to lots of sci-fi
podcasts. Sure we like them, but they also help to reaffirm who we consider
ourselves to be. Evo is into holistic health, thinks of himself as environmen-
tally responsible, and digs trippy world music with lots of freaky drums and
weird time signatures. Guess what sorts of shows are in his playlist? Tee loves
his anime, his sushi, and his martial arts. It is no surprise that his soundsee-
ing tours tend to be centered around the Land of the Rising Sun.
Radio can’t do this. Oh sure, you can make the assumption that all NPR listen-
ers are democrats, and everyone who tunes in to the local classic rock station
used to have a mullet. While that may be true in some cases, it’s likely not true
in all, simply due to the complexity of the human psyche. We’re complicated
guys, and we haven’t found a station that gets anywhere near summing us up.
But take a listen to some of the podcasts in our playlists, and you’re a few steps
closer to understanding where we’re coming from. Caution: The view from here
is a tad bit scary.
You Bought This Book, Didn’t You?
We end on the number-one reason podcasting will put a dent in radio: you.
We’re betting you have listened to the radio at least once in your life. We’ll go
out on a limb and say it was even more than that — a lot more. Yet here you
are, reading a book that shows you how to podcast. Even if you are just curi-
ous about this phenomenon, your actions speak volumes.
Hey, don’t get us wrong. We’re not assuming this book has some magical
power, or that you’re so stunned by the stellar quality of the writing that
you’ll rip the radio out of your car. But you must be looking for something
that radio is not, or by your perception, cannot provide you personally.
Maybe it’s one of the reasons outlined in this chapter. Perhaps podcasting
just sounds really fun, and you’d love to try it out. You sure can’t do that in
radio. But whatever the reason is, we hope you enjoy the journey of finding
your own voice in podcasting.
